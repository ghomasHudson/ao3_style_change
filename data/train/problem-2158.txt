He is on the verge of toppling forward when a clamorous bang fills the air, followed by a pained scream and a crying baby. His heart races too fast, his lungs heave too much with every gulping breath he forces himself to take, his legs almost giving out under the sheer weight of guilt and fear and horror, and he trembles. Trembles on the edge of the roof, the ground so close, so close.
John hums softly. Who knew Sherlock could be that much of a romantic? He buries his nose in the crook of Sherlock's neck, holding him close. "I wish there was some other way you could play for me."
Sherlock wanted to scream. He wanted to sit down with John and demand clarification. He wanted to know what was going on. If he just wasn’t enough for John anymore, then so be it, but he had to know, he
John’s mind buzzes. His heart seethes. “Exactly, so she could figure you out, to find your weaknesses, and then she went back to Sherrinford as though nothing happened!”
. Do we know each other?" John asked and sat down on the sand, apparently not intending to go back to his friends although he reassured them just a second ago.
Black. That’s all there is. He opens his eyes, but everything stays black. He blinks. No change. Has he lost his eyesight?
Sherlock turned away from him, but John rested his hands on his shoulder to stop him. “Sherlock, look at me, please.”
Molly comes round and looks happy. How can she be happy after what she had to go through? After what Sherlock had to put her through?
, … you’ve never been more wrong, love, because quite the opposite is true. I don’t know how I can make this up to you, but I swear, if you let me, I’ll try everything to show you– God, this really isn’t how I wanted it to go,” John looked into Sherlock’s eyes, “but no matter if you’re sad or happy or anything in-between, I’ll always want this, I’ll always want
The very thought filled his stomach with nausea and made his head spin. Taking a sip of the steaming liquid, he burned his tongue, but he ignored the sting and cherished the heat running down his throat and making him feel warm all over, defeating the cold that wanted to grab him by the scruff of his neck and drag him to the ground.
“The guilt turned into anger towards you because,” he laughs at how stupid he has been, “because I thought I
Sherlock whimpered in relief when he felt the warmth of the bottle on his belly. “John …” he breathed as his friend pulled the duvet up to Sherlock’s chin and wrapped another blanket around him afterwards. He looked at him and his eyes were so soft Sherlock got lost in them. “…nk you.”
His breaths were shallow, and he knew he was close, but it was just not enough yet. He was just a few more strokes away from release, but he needed more. God, it was agonising.
“You’re almost standing up straight,” John laughed heartily. “All right, then. Let’s try it with the ball.”
"John," he managed to croak, earning a relieved sigh from everyone who stood in front of him apparently. It was hard to locate.
“That’s it, just let go,” John rasps into Sherlock’s ear. His curls have against into his forehead, resting in a mixture of sweat and water from the bath.
"I love you, too, Sherlock." He leant forward, their foreheads touching lightly. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock's lips and carded his fingers through his curls. It was enough for his lids to fall slowly over his eyes one last time that night.
He sat up in bed and rested his face on his knees, violent shivers kept tormenting him and his stomach hurt as if someone had stabbed him.
John held him until the trembling wore off a little and then pulled him back into the pillows, drawing up the covers. Sherlock hesitantly rested his head on John’s shoulder as another arm folded protectively around him.
He fell into the lethargic state of boredom and melancholy, sulked on the sofa and was in a terrible mood most of the time since John had to spend all day at work, which only exacerbated the already atrocious situation.
»Mycroft will be here in about an hour,« Mrs Holmes told them. »He’s sitting in traffic on the M25 at the moment, so there’s still some time until we’ll all get together.«
“We have to get back to Baker Street. I have to–“ A stabbing pain shot through his head. His hands flew to his temples, trying to ease the ache, but it didn’t work the way he had hoped it would.
Sherlock tore off the wrapping paper and looked at the carton box, trying to deduce the content. It was middle size, bigger than he had expected. He opened it with careful fingers, as John had told him to.
Sherlock’s body froze. He shivered and trembled, but somehow he didn’t even take notice of that. A bomb could have gone off outside, a war could have been started, and all Sherlock would have taken in would have been John’s words, the tender tone of his voice, the more gentle caress of his hands now.
John’s tongue and lips and hands were everywhere. His nipples, his hip, his knee. He peppered the inside of his thigh with small kisses, nipping gently here and there. His kisses came closer and closer to his groin. Sherlock held his breath.
John laughed against his skin, conjuring a smile on Sherlock’s face. He buried his fingers in the soft strands of John’s hair and ran his fingertips over his scalp while he lost himself in John’s kisses and touches.
John pulls off with a smirk, hovering just above him. “I thought we’d established to stick to first names,” he echoes Sherlock’s words from just a few moments prior.
“Thanks, Greg,” Sherlock says and hangs up, ignoring both John's shocked face and the surprised intake of breath on the other end of the phone just before the line goes dead. Sherlock pulls up his e-mail app on his phone, a
Sherlock, of course, turns everything into a joke, and John has had enough jokes for the night, which is why he grabs Sherlock's collar and pushes him back through the aisle of the restaurant until Sherlock stumbles and lands on the floor with John on top of him.
»Yes. But don’t you think it’s really unfair of Princess Pirlipat’s father to just send him away because he turned into a Nutcracker?« Alison wanted to know.
His tongue darts out and he licks his lips that are already slightly swollen. "Let me hear it again," he asks, voice hoarse from earlier activities. "Please. Play the song again for me."
John didn't let go of his hand on the way home – a simple gesture that conjured a smile on his face which wouldn't fade with time.
"All of a sudden, there was Mum's favourite vase in his hands and he threw it in your direction." John finally looked up at him, reaching out to touch his cheek, running his fingers over his skin. He sat up and pressed his lips to Sherlock's. His chest ached. It ached so terribly with love for John and hate for the things his father had put him through. He hated that his father was still haunting him in his sleep even though he had been gone since John was sixteen.
But of course, John removed his hands just a moment later and walked around him to watch his movements. “Okay. Try to stretch as if you wanted to set the ball.”
He dreaded turning around and facing John, but he had to know. He wanted to hear what weighed heavily on his soul and he wanted to see whether he truly meant it.
He doesn't want to talk about the incident. Instead, he goes to Baker Street after work, the embarrassment still weighing on his shoulders.
“Because people have lied to me about important things all my life!” John answered desperately, … exasperatedly …
He got out of the tub before his skin started to wrinkle and dried himself off. He wrapped the towel around his hips, unlocked the door and stepped back into his room where he found John sitting on his bed, reading.
Their mocking voices wouldn’t stop haunting him. He wanted to scream and get up and threaten them with the gun he kept in his bedside table, but he was to weak to even move a muscle.
“You gave all your trumps. Very unwise,” Sherlock teased cheekily as he returned to his half to serve.
Obviously, John also wanted to spend time with his other friends, and while Sherlock played a role in John's life now, it didn't mean he was his main focus. Sherlock wondered if he wanted that to be the case and found no answer straight away.
He is right. But he cannot do anything about it. Not now. Not ever. Because Sherlock is dead, and that is an unchangeable fact.
It was frustrating. John made his way back into his mind no matter how hard he tried not to let him.
When the last note faded, John got up and applauded loudly. »Sherlock, that was … God, I have no words for it. It’s … I don’t know what to say.«
It's a mere brush of lips at first, a gentle press, but it's enough to make John's head spin. It feels as if the world is finally moving again, just at the speed of light.
John smiled a little, but not for very long. “She’s one year older than me,” he told him. “We never got on well, but I was always there for her, defending her in front of our parents. My mum had a hard time accepting she’s a lesbian. And my father, well, he never accepted it. Brought it up whenever he could and tried to make her feel ashamed. She told me first. When I was fifteen, I think. She always had my support, especially when she came out.”
“No, Sherlock. This is not over yet. I know this isn’t easy for you. Christ, it’s not easy for me either. But tell me … why do you think you have to do this alone?” John’s voice softened at the end of the sentence. The furrowed lines on his forehead eased gradually.
He thinks of Sherlock sitting there all night. Hesitating to come in? Too upset, so his initial plan faltered?
Sherlock reluctantly wrapped his arms around John's waist, but John offered, and he wasn't going to refuse. His fingers dug into the soft fabric of his shirt.
He didn’t know what on earth possessed him to actually get into a cab with her and be taken to the university’s biggest exam hall that the disco took place in. All he knew is that he would probably leave with his heart hanging heavy with disappointment and regret inside his chest. After all, it was a lost evening, wasn’t it …
Edit: 1st Feb 2020: This fic has not been abandoned, I'm currently working on the next chapters. So you've got something to look forward to (I hope) <3
“I would’ve thought the girls were crazy about you.” John still couldn’t believe it. He furrowed his brow and raised both eyebrows.
Sherlock let his hand wander over John’s chest, up to the side his neck where he found his pulse point, feeling the little hammering motion and realising that the even heartbeat was picking up now.
“I just mean, you won’t stop taking cases, I certainly wouldn’t want you to, and Mrs Hudson isn’t getting any younger either.”
»Perhaps St. Nicholas thought you’d appreciate a little treat since you have to endure all these horrible traditions. Besides you had a rough evening yesterday,« John answered calmly.
“Sherlock…” John took a deep breath to object. “We have to. She has to keep an eye on it in case it’s something serious.”
Sherlock’s hands flew to the fly of his trousers, but John’s hands stopped him once more. “Let me,” he whispered against Sherlock’s lips, brushing gently against them as he spoke. “We’ve got lots of time.”
“Sherlock …” John had fallen asleep in the chair once again, resting his head on his arms on the table in front of him. “What’s wrong?” He got up and knelt beside the bed, following Sherlock’s gaze.
The violin was packed away safely in its case. John only dared to open it once, to look at it. The delicate instrument held by delicate hands and played by talented fingers. He misses the quiet evenings at home. Violin music. Tchaikovsky has been John's favourite, and if he wasn't a complete idiot, ever since he had told Sherlock about it, he had played more of his pieces. John revels in the memory.
Sherlock looked tiredly at John. »I didn’t know you could sing,« he announced in a whisper; his voice was hoarse and his body was weaker than he’d expected.
All the while, John could neither keep quiet nor still. He could feel his legs tremble beside him. Sherlock would smile weren’t his mouth otherwise occupied.
Sherlock nods slowly, his eyes gleaming in the light falling through the windows despite the darkness. He pulls him closer, needing to hear that violent heartbeat, needing to know that at least one of the two people that still keep his world together is safe, even though ‘safe' is a state that never lasts very long.
Not only once did he wish that it were Sherlock's hair he has been caressing absentmindedly while they sat in front of the telly, watching a dull romantic comedy with a predictable ending. Not only once did he crave Sherlock's presence, just to hear his voice, his choice of words, his almost unintelligible speeches when he deduces something at a crime scene that seems obvious enough to himself and impossible to read for anyone else standing around. Not only once did he simply want him around, to play the violin for him after he has had a nightmare. Although his dreams of Sherlock have taken on a more intimate atmosphere rather than reminded him of the earth-shattering scene that he had to witness in front of Barts hospital, those did occur, too, once in a while, and Mary's comfort has never been enough.
“It’s not,” John assured him. His arm came up around his back and his shoulders until his hand was buried in his hair. “We all want to fit in somehow, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I think during that process, people create so many categories that make it hard for people to truly find out what or who they are. Once you know, it’s hard to accept change. At least that’s what it was like for me. I didn’t want to accept that I was both into women
“Hey, John!” another volleyball player called out. He was playing in John’s opponent team. That was the name of the short but muscular man with the deep blue eyes apparently. “You coming back anytime soon?"
Sherlock’s head rested comfortable on John’s scarred shoulder and his fingers traced the lines on John’s sweaty torso. “You.”
Sherlock nodded with a smile. He was still feeling slightly groggy, but sitting at home all day wasn’t going to change that either. Engaging in physical activity wasn’t going to do any harm, so he agreed to John’s plan.
“I’ve been such an idiot,” John whispers and only then realises he said it out loud. He takes another step forward. “I’m sorry. I should’ve realised. God, everything you’ve done for me and I–"
He didn’t remember much of the drive because his lids hang heavy over his eyes and he was glad they did. The speed of the people and objects moving around worsened his headache.
He feels two hands on his shoulders, pulling him closer. He gets up and lets himself be guided to Sherlock’s chest. He buries his face in Sherlock’s shoulder, wetting the fabric of his expensive shirt. This time he doesn’t cover his eyes with his hand. He closes his arms around Sherlock’s waist, his fists tightening at his sides, twisting the garment between his fingers.
"That explains why you barely turn up to classes," John chuckled, and Sherlock couldn't help but smile, too. "But yes, I can relate to that,” he smiled and emptied his tumbler. “I prefer a night out at the pub with friends over parties such as this.”
“Yes, I can see that,” John answered and shut him up with his mouth on his own. Next thing he knew was their aligned erections as he sank back against the pillows with a deep, low moan.
“I’m not shy about this!” Sherlock complained firmly, trying to look defiant and failing miserably, only widening John’s grin.
Instead he took in the prominent pecs, tanned skin and thin, golden hair lightly covering his chest. Swallowing hard, he met John's eyes. His smile was wide and his eyes crinkled. "I've noticed you stare before, just go ahead, love," he grinned softly.
“Let’s see how I’ll pay you back for this,” John grinned as he released his wrists and moved down his body, leaving a trail behind with his tongue. He took his cock into his mouth without any further ado and no warning, and it took all of Sherlock’s self-control not to scream.
When he saw Irene in her most sparkly attire that the world had ever seen, he almost slammed the door into her face, but Irene beat him to it and stepped inside before he could do anything untoward.
John laughed and shot Sherlock a dirty look. "You know how he is about his hair, doesn't leave the house till it's perfectly arranged."
John has to gulp, feeling how his own eyes are starting to water. Forgotten is his frustration, his anger from only moments ago.
He cannot quite believe he is actually leaving until he is standing on the pavement outside 221B, staring up at the closed door, Rosie cradled safely in his arms. If he were lucky enough, he could make it home before the rain would start pouring down. But knowing his luck, that definitely isn’t going to happen. He walks for at least ten minutes while heavy drops of water soak his and Rosie’s clothes. When he has almost lost all hope, a cab finally stops for him. He slumps down in the seat. Rosie is probably freezing.
The waves breaking on the pile of stones beneath the platform seemed to be a mirror image of the thoughts tumbling over each other in his mind. He shook his head again. This wouldn't happen. It was going to be fine, for God's sake. It was merely lots of complicated feelings caused by his hormones flying high and having the time of their lives in his body while he squirmed under the touches of the person who was responsible for all this in the first place. It was just chemicals. Just chemicals. Normal. Rational. Natural. It was only his body, feeling intensively.
"Uh … yes, of course!" John whips out his phone and taps a quick message to Molly. Briefly, he shudders at the memory of that dreadful dream sequence he had during the coma: the I love you said to the wrong person, the despair, his own hatred at that moment … he shakes his head to clear the cobwebs away and presses "send." The answer follows within seconds; Molly is happy to assist and awaits Sherlock in the lab.
"Oh, I can," she smiles with a sinister grimace. “Just watch me.” The gun still aimed at Sherlock, she takes a few steps to the side of the roof. “Well, how would baby Rosie like to go on the very first flight in her life, eh?”
John is not so lucky. Sleep will not relieve him from all the thoughts flooding his head and clouding his brain, growing louder and louder until it becomes almost unbearable. This is what Sherlock must feel like when the boredom overtakes him.
»I do have a good taste!« she stated clearly. John chuckled heartily when he saw her stern expression and told her to start the film once more.
As if he had guessed his thoughts, John pressed a little deeper until it was completely buried inside him, and a second finger was already eager to join the first. He pulled out and pushed back in with two at a time. The stretch felt unfamiliar but not unwelcome. He gasped at being opened like this, automatically pushing down onto John’s fingers, craving more. His cock rubbed against John’s belly, and the moan that escaped him was enough for John to increase his efforts. He turned them around so that Sherlock was on top of him, their cocks aligned and his fingers, somehow, still inside him.
When he meets Mary, the world seems a little brighter. If only a little. Her smile of comfort actually brings him peace, lets his mind settle and makes his reality appear a little less broken than it is.
Meanwhile, it was getting even colder in the flat and Sherlock had wrapped a blanket around his slim body. Huddling on the sofa, he tried not to let on he was freezing. He could not stop shivering, though, and John, being very observant today, noticed it of course.
John was right beside him. His hand was on his cheek then back on his sweaty forehead. “We have to lower your temperature,” he told him. He was in doctor-mode, Sherlock could tell. “I’ll prepare leg compresses.”
“Let’s get through the rest of this and get you well again.” The corners of John’s eyes crinkled a little when his grin widened, but then he turned serious. He was silent for a long moment before he spoke up once more.
He wants to punch him. To knock all air out of his chest, so he is left breathless and panting and quiet. Just quiet.
»I haven’t celebrated Christmas for years. Last year was no exception,« Sherlock murmured and was now looking for his mother’s favourite chocolate. Merci was so hard to find no matter which shop you went to, let alone Tesco or Morrison’s.
He remembered John's nightmare about his father, how badly he panicked when he had woken up, concerned about Sherlock's wellbeing. How must he have suffered in his childhood and youth under his father's alcoholic assaults? Had he ever hit him? Sherlock didn't dare to think about it. Merely knowing that he had endured enough under his terrible words and actions made his heart ache and his stomach turn.
“Morning,” he normally said, his voice still rough from sleeping, but to Sherlock, it always sounded endearing.
When he could walk properly again, he took him to their favourite ice cream parlour. John hadn't pointed out that he had actually won their little match, and he kept saying he didn't have to do this, not after what had happened, but Sherlock knew deep-down John was pleased. He wanted to lace their fingers together on the way, but he acknowledged this would spoil the atmosphere. John wasn't the type for this apparently, at least when it came to being with a bloke. Sherlock couldn't blame him; he had heard homophobic comments all his life, people always had assumed he was gay, judging from his clothing style, his hair, his appearance, and he had never corrected them. It simply hadn't been worth the effort and the trouble, as they wouldn't have believed him anyway. The jokes only would have become meaner, crueller and more dismissive. He hesitated to admit that they were right after all, that they knew it before he did because they were idiots, but he was also still figuring out what all this meant, what he was, who he was. Mainly, he wanted to focus on John, because when he was with John, he felt good and happy, and it seemed as if vice versa this was also the case. Making John happy was the most important thing, and forcing him to display affection publicly apparently provoked the opposite, and this was definitely unacceptable.
“It’s our variation for volleyball. You when you set the ball over the net to the other player, you try to make it to the other side as quickly as possible and set the ball back to the player on the side you just came from,” John explained as Greg, Mike and Bill moved on the court. “It’s fun.”
“Tell Mycroft to get the medication …” His voice was merely a whisper. “… and all the supplies you need.”
The grin still lingers on Sherlock’s lips. “Why do you have such a hard time accepting I don’t feel attracted to her?”
He’d often dreamt of this kind of thing. John being as far away as possible and not intending to come back. Sherlock disappointing John and John leaving without ever planning to return. John leaving him because he needed someone normal in his life, which was something Sherlock would never be able to give him. John dying in Sherlock’s arms on a case because he’s been ruthless and stupid again and hadn’t contemplated all the possibilities and now John was the one who had to suffer from the consequences.
Another small smile lingered on John’s lips. »Yes, she does refuse to at first, but they get to have their happy ending they deserve.«
“When I said we should stick to your plan, I didn’t mean it has to be now,” John answered soothingly and his hand continued to stroke his back gently.
“Oh shush, you will eat. You’ve been out all day.” She told him, taking out the plate of dinner she had saved for him and warmed it up.
He ran his hands through his hair. The alcohol was wearing off slightly, but he felt drunk nonetheless.
about being a mother. She took care of her whenever she needed her mummy. In the beginning, I couldn't even make her stop crying. You sometimes look at helpless parents whose child keeps wailing, drawing all the attention to them in public and you can't understand that they don't know what to do to make it better. You think you'd know what to do to stop your child from crying, but you don't.
John gave him a lewd look and smirked before he kissed him again for a long moment. “Only if you want to.”
John moaned into the kiss. He took Sherlock's bottom lip between his teeth as he had done earlier, and Sherlock realised this was his new favourite feeling. He nibbled and sucked, and the sensation caused eagerness to shoot through every vein in his body. He pulled John on top of him, feeling the comfortable weight on his chest and welcoming their new position because his hands could dive into John's jeans now and
Perhaps that is the reason why he asks her out for a coffee later that day. “Not the crappy one in the vending machine. There’s a Harris and Hoole just around the corner. If you’re up to it.”
Finding a present for his landlady wasn’t very difficult. Her apron was certainly from the Stone Age and even though she hand-stitched every hole, it was going to fall to pieces sooner or later.
John shakes his head, and his eyes crinkle as his lips curl into an impish smile. "Let me show you what I dabble in." With that, he presses his fingers in deeper until he reaches Sherlock's prostate.
“I have,” Sherlock counters, seeking the comfortable warmth radiating off John’s chest. “Quite well, too. Waking up to someone breathing next to you is an experience I’m not accustomed to but have no objections to whatsoever."
The sour taste soon faded, and everything he focused on was kissing back, playing with John's tongue, trying to keep up with its vigour –
“John …,” he gasped into the kiss, somehow managing to get out of his own shirt. Their pyjama bottoms presented a slightly bigger problem. Sherlock’s did anyway. John was sleeping in his boxer briefs. Too many layers were separating them, which was a problem that had to be eliminated immediately.
“I did. She’s in rehab, as you know, and tried to escape,” John sighed, sitting down opposite him on the kitchen table.
"It's about you, after all, so it can be nothing but marvellous," Sherlock breathes, kissing John softly. "But now that I was able to experience … this …" Another kiss. "There is more I need to add."
His senses were a little clouded from the alcohol, but just in the right way. The world has become fuzzy around the edges, almost dreamy as one feels just after waking up, but it was suitable for the occasion. It was simply a wonderful evening.
Sherlock smiles. It makes John’s heart soar and sing with happiness. They will be all right. Now that they have each other back, they will be all right. He can feel it.
“Flatterer,” Sherlock teased, and John laughed softly as his hands ran over his sides, making him squirm.
John nibbled at Sherlock’s bottom lip, educing a quiet and pleased sigh from him. He pressed him down into couch and their bodies welded together. A hand tugged at Sherlock’s curls, making him hum at the sensation.
There it was. Sherlock had known this was going to happen. "You don't have to stay here. It's too much trouble, I know–"
“There’s nothing to keep me here anymore,” Sherlock whispered, wanting to turn his head away from John again. He couldn’t bear the look on his face; the worry, the disappointment, the shock and the realisation.
Once they arrived at home, Sherlock changed into his pyjamas with some difficulty and then literally collapsed on his bed. His head met the pillow and he started snoring quietly about three seconds later. John left him with a fond smile and soon went to bed, too.
"There you go. Wasn't that hard, was it?" John smiled and handed him the blanket he had been carrying for him. "You're welcome," he told him in earnest now. "It was nothing."
But then he lets go of himself and reaches for his pants, tugging them down and off to have better access. He pulls up both knees, resting the soles of his feet flat on the mattress, letting his legs fall open as wide as he can. His pants no longer restrain him now.
Sherlock stirs a little as his breaths become shorter until he breathes in deeply and cranes his neck, turning around in John’s arms.
»I know. I’m not forcing you to help me decorate the flat, but of course you’re always welcome to,« John smiled warmly. »Just let me put up the fairy lights on the tree before you hang the bauble on it.«
Sherlock took a deep breath, not wanting to pull away just yet. John’s chest felt inviting and comfortable and if he had the choice, he would never let go again.
He reached for Sherlock's hands and removed them gently, pushing each button through its hole with steady fingers. He wasn't wearing a vest top underneath either, and so his chest gleamed in its perfection under the fabric. Sherlock marvelled at the sight. He had seen John's naked torso on various occasions, but never this close, never in a situation like this.
Sherlock had been on edge for the entirety of the day, mentally reprimanding himself whenever another thought about it started to make him nervous. There was absolutely no reason to. John had already seen truly every part of him, which is why Sherlock didn't know what the source of this sensation was that felt suspiciously similar to fear.
“Go back to sleep for a bit, all right?” he heard John ask as he sank back against the clean pillow.
“Sherlock …” He heard John budging closer and felt his hand on his shoulder a second later. “I’m sorry,” John said quietly and started kissing his neck.
Sherlock coughed. His chest was heaving from the pain and the physical exhaustion his arms and legs were currently enduring.
The whole incident hadn't happened far from Sherlock's house. Yet, still they found themselves running – if you could call it that. With John's aching back and Sherlock's legs that felt like flummery, it must have looked more like limping, but they couldn't risk the possibility of another unexpected attack.
“I can hear you, you know?” Sherlock’s voice echoes in the room, but his eyes don’t leave the microscope.
I hope you had as much fun reading as I had writing it, and if you enjoyed it, I'd love to hear what you think so far in the comments :)
“No, please, Sherlock, don’t try to defend my choices,” he pleads and leans forward onto his knees, looking at the space between their feet. “Hell, I didn’t even want to say any of this."
They said their goodbyes, and Sherlock walked back towards the beach, where he heard an all too familiar voice before he actually saw the person it belonged to.
John turns his head; the corners of his lips curl upwards. “I love you,” he breathes. “I love you.” His hands wander up to cup Sherlock’s face. He runs his fingers over those sharp cheekbones. “So much, and for so long.”
John smiled, leaning a bit closer again. Their lips were merely inches apart when they heard Sherlock’s grandma.
“Lovely,” John mutters under his breath. “Here, take her. Since I’m apparently not even capable of calming her down.”
He could feel John smile against his skin before he let his lips trail over his pecs, lower and lower to his belly, to the side over his pelvis until his chin brushed against the buttons of his shorts. Sherlock gasped silently when John’s fingers sneaked under his waistband to undo the button and to unzip him, pulling down the trousers. He lifted his hips for him to slip out of them more easily.
“Sherlock.” He wasn’t even out of breath. How the hell was this possible? “Shit, I’m sorry I didn’t take this seriously. Where is it?”
One of the girls who worked there, maybe in her mid-twenties, always grinned knowingly at them when they came in. She was the one who served them, winking at either him or John whenever she left the table to take other customers' orders. She never commented, but it was evident she knew.
About two hours after their arrival, Sherlock made his way through the mess on the dance floor to the men’s lavatory. He hadn’t caught sight of John or the others since Mike left the bar to find them and Sherlock supposed there was no need to go looking for them as the chances of actually finding anyone in his current state were virtually zero.
Sherlock presses kisses to John’s chin, the underside of his jaw, down to his neck and his collarbone. John’s fingers remain in the dark, messy mop of curly strands of hair. Sherlock gasps in pleasure whenever they grip his curls a little tighter. His tongue laps out and the small, innocent kisses turn into wet, open-mouthed ones.
He let his eyes fall closed, squeezing them shut in an attempt to hold back the tears. They wouldn’t fall when biting words and harmful touches of his classmates tried to break through his walls.
“No, it’s not,” John answered. Sherlock could feel his eyes on him. His gaze was intensive and hard to resist. "I'll make it up to you, I promise."
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock states matter-of-factly, reciprocating the smile. “Mrs Hudson is there when we need her, but she’s truly
"That is evidently a lie," Sherlock states, and in a second, he is back in full deduction-mode. He is leaning forward in his chair, eyes scanning John. "There is clearly something on your mind. It's pretty evident, and it's not very hard to spot your uneasiness. The way you are trying to set me up with people, the way you talked about 'lost chances' when I received Irene's text a couple of weeks ago, the way you almost interrogated me several times about my emotions and needs – John, for God's sake, if there is something on your mind, say it!"
Eventually, they wrapped themselves in their coats and scarves and stumbled out into the cold again. Later, they would not remember how they ended up in Sherlock’s tiny flat, kissing tipsily and hungrily as soon as the door fell shut them. Sherlock pulled away ultimately, and they practically fell up the stairs and into Sherlock’s bed.
He couldn’t risk another goodbye. Probably a proper one this time. He was confident this would be even worse than what they got because then it would turn from a maybe into a fact, an unmistakable truth. But then at least he could finally move on. He could stop thinking about him all the time. He refused to admit it to himself, but that was the case. He was thinking of him when he woke up, when he mindlessly stared into the sky, when he tried to focus on a household chore, when his eyes were fixed on words on a page that informed him about bee culture, when he seemed to be concentrated on different things, when he closed his eyes and willed his brain to just go to sleep. John was always present in the back of his mind. A maybe or the truth? He didn’t quite know what he preferred.
Sherlock swallowed, regretting every word he said. “No,” he told him immediately. “This is more than fine. It’s just – not exactly my area.”
"Where the hell have you been and why didn't you answer your bloody phone?" isn’t what he wants to say, but the words are quicker than he can control.
John watches as Sherlock's face hardens for a second, his lips tightening into a thin line. "Fine," he breathes out between tight-pressed lips. "Fine, then come along."
John drinks the rest of his tea and sets mug down on the table beside him. Bad decision. Now he doesn’t have anything to hold onto. “I thought I did the right thing,” he says, thinking of the wedding, Mary. God, the mess she had brought into their lives.
John leans into it for two seconds, merely wanting – needing the reassurance of not having to go through this alone. He already knows this of course, but convincing his brain is harder than convincing his heart.
“All right,” Mary said, the expression on her face was unreadable. “You’ll take him to a clinic, then?”
»Your face when you fell,« Sherlock laughed and tried to get up, failing to do so because John was on top of him and he was quite heavy, though not uncomfortably so.
John’s eyes seemed cold and his face almost closed off. Sherlock took a step towards him. “What’s wrong?” he asked.
John nods and steps back for Sherlock to head back up to their flat. He sees him take two steps at a time, sometimes three, while he struggles to keep his breathing even climbing up himself. When he reaches the top of the stairs, Sherlock is already talking rapidly on the phone. John has to steady himself on the back of his armchair or else he might topple over because his legs are shaking so much.
Groaning, he walked downstairs, had a quick breakfast and spent the rest of the morning in the bathroom. A hot shower certainly worked its wonders, and he decided to stay in there for just a bit longer than strictly necessary. The same went for fixing his hair in the mirror afterwards.
When Sherlock picked up Rosie from pre-school the following day, she already sputtered out exactly what kind of pumpkin she wanted. It had to be big, she kept repeating. And orange!
When their tongues found one another, Sherlock gasped and pulled back, his lips still on John’s. “Okay, maybe I do a bit,” he breathed, making John laugh quietly.
The sound causes a slight pang in his head, but the cradling caress on the back of his hand soothes it.
"An elderly people's home, maybe?" John suggests. "That'd be my first guess anyway. They've got plants and rugs, and they all have their tablets.
“I love you, Sherlock, and I can’t lose you, not because of this,” he whispered with a constricted voice, and it only took so much to break Sherlock’s heart completely. He stumbled forward and wound both arms around John’s trembling body, embracing him with all the comfort he could possibly give.
His ears tingle, no, scream, due to the bang that echoed so close to him. What was it? Did Eurus shoot Sherlock? Or Rosie? As punishment since he made the wrong choice and tricked her? Whatever it was, John knows he cannot go on like this. He leans forward, waiting for his skull to crush down onto the hard street, and when he feels his head collide with the hard floor, he blacks out.
»But me no buts,« Sherlock murmured and pressed his nose against John’s neck. John buried a hand in Sherlock’s thick and curly hair.
Sherlock quickly changed into his swimming trunks, not knowing if he should thank or curse his mother for having put them into his suitcase after all, and went back outside with two towels.
He wanted all this to be over. He wanted to believe John meant all this. He wanted to be sure they were getting back to what they used to be.
Before Sherlock can do what he very clearly intends to do, though, John beats him to it and grabs his face in both his hands, kissing him hard, catching Sherlock's bottom lip with his teeth, nibbling and biting gently, making Sherlock collapse on top of John's chest. Their middles are touching; their almost aligned cocks brush against each other. He welcomes the friction, moaning against Sherlock’s gasping mouth.
»Are you going to stay with Harry this year?« Sherlock asked as they walked through the aisles of the chocolate shop.
“I thought you would …,” he stopped again, not knowing if he should tell her. He didn’t want to upset her, but he had also sworn he would be honest with her. “I thought you would be disappointed.”
John's hands wander along his thighs, brushing over the milk-white skin before they come back up to his arse, squeezing, kneading the soft flesh. More and more moans escape Sherlock's throat until he arches his back. John would smile if his mouth weren't otherwise occupied. His other hand reaches for Sherlock's. They find each other without difficulty; fingers intertwine and squeeze tightly. His other hand stays where it is, and his fingers close around his drawn-up testicles, fondling them gently in his hand while his thumb runs carefully over his perineum, making Sherlock keen beneath him. "Like that, ha, yes. Yes! Hmm …" John reaches further back until he finds his entrance and rubs over it
“No need to be all shy about it,” John teased, his tone sweet as ever and his smile lighting up his entire face.
“Spoilsport,” Irene answered and removed her coat. “I need to talk to the org team for a minute. I’ll be back in no time. You’ll be all right, won’t you?”
He took a few steps backwards, trying to bring a small distance between himself and the sharp blade of the knife.
Eventually, they had decided to go to bed, which in retrospect wasn’t helping much either. Sherlock sighed as he snuggled under his duvet, pulling it up tightly under his chin. He was wearing three pairs of socks and his scarf by now. His fingers had turned into ice; at least it felt as if they were.
Sherlock remained silent for several seconds. He hadn't meant to bring this up – especially now, God damn it – or make a huge deal out of it; at least not now when they were in a rather … compromising position. John wasn't unaffected either, which wasn't even a surprise.
He was pulled closer against John as his fingers disappeared in his hair, stroking, carding through them gently, just like he used to, just the way he knew Sherlock loved it, and his other hand was resting heavily, comfortably on his lower back. A steady, constant reminder that he was here. It was going to be all right.
Sherlock thought what it would feel like to kiss John right now. How would he react? Would he flee? Would he freeze on the spot? Would he shove Sherlock away? Would he kiss back? What would his lips feel like, taste like? He was probably a fantastic kisser.
"Will …" Sherlock's fingers twiddle with his dressing gown and he has to clear his throat before he continues. "Will you come back downstairs afterwards?"
»It was a song that changed things for me and it helped me live with everything my father put us through. It was like a light, leading me out of the darkness. Mum and I kept singing it when Christmas approached; it was always something special to us and even though there were other carols, too, this one always meant so much to us. I used to hum the melody to myself; it became a tradition. It was probably a tradition to other families as well, but it surely wasn’t as meaningful or significant to them as it was to us.
It's 02:05 am when John is woken by a violin playing beautifully. His eyes blink open slowly as he is roused from his sleep, as he is dragged from a warm dream back into reality, where coldness creeps through every hole in 221B's wall. In her little bed, Rosie snores silently.
It didn’t even take half an hour before Sherlock excused himself to use the bathroom. He didn’t return for fifteen minutes.
John’s mouth came hazardously close to his erection, jutting out from his body. His nose was buried in his neatly trimmed pubic hair – he had taken care of that earlier, just to be certain and to leave nothing undone – breathing him in and letting out a sound that aroused Sherlock even more. When he looked up at him, it felt almost obscene. “Is this okay?” he asked.
Sherlock shook his head vehemently. He held his breath to hold back the sobs that already threatened to break loose.
Sherlock listened to John until he stopped talking about football and asked what he had been up to in the past few days. Saying he had been waiting on the beach for him every day would sound clingy and desperate. He couldn’t risk making John think that about him, so he said, “I was reading, mostly.”
Karla didn't say anything, merely looking at him empathetically, silently telling him that she didn't believe him. She didn't have to; her believing him or not wouldn't make a difference. It was over, and that was the truth.
"Are you all right? Please say something." The voice sounds worried and a bit sleepy. That person, a man, must have been asleep.
He carefully extricated himself from John’s protective grasp, but his head stung with every movement he made. Cursing under his breath, and cursing himself for making too much noise, he made sure he didn’t rouse John from his peaceful and sound slumber, but he was still miles away in another world of quiet and calmness.
“Budge over,” John told him, and Sherlock complied with a sound escaping his mouth that definitely did not sound like a whine.
»Do you want us to stay forever?« Sherlock asked exasperatedly at which John laughed heartily and took another sip.
She looks at her gun with a smile. It is different than the one she had put on on the bus. How could he have fallen for this?
»Thank you. That’s really kind of you,« John said then and revealed the sheets of music paper. »Wow, that’s – Sherlock, this is …« He looked at the sheets, counting them. »Six sheets! That must have taken you days!«
"D'you sleep well?" John asked as he tightened the arm that he had flung around Sherlock's warm body. John's hand always felt warmer, though.
“And you talk about my funeral arrangements.” Sherlock shook his head as he walked to the kitchen to retrieve the sharpest knife they owned.
Without hesitation, he sat up, turned around, and dug his fingers into her apron as he buried his face in the crook of her neck. He felt like a little boy again; running away from the bullies, the horrible things they said, seeking comfort in his mother’s embrace; his mother who tried to find comforting words but never could.
Greg grinned at Sherlock. »Come on, mate, cheer up a bit.« Had he really just called him mate? Yes, he’s definitely had too much to drink.
»Too slow!« John called with a smirk and ran away to create some distance between them and prepare his next attack. A snowball hit his back and he turned around to look offended. »That’s it? You should learn to take accurate aim! That was really bad–«
He should’ve known that none of the things he did were going to make him forget anything that happened. Not for long anyway. He couldn’t recall anything from last night, but the things he wanted to forget were still there, still very prominent in his memories.
When they pulled apart, and their foreheads came to rest against each other, feeling one another's breath on their swollen, wet lips, one of John's hands slipped back into his curls, tenderly stroking through the thick locks. "I want you to be happy," John said, his voice husky. "That's why you should go to Cambridge."
“But– she threw herself in front of Sherlock, she died in front of all of us!” John answers, raising his voice, trying not to lose his temper and failing. “How could she have survived that?”
“You’re right.” Sherlock intertwined their fingers. “It’s about my future, but it’s also about yours.”
“Happy anniversary,” he answered, somehow unable to hide his grin that almost fell from his lips just a moment later.
God, he wanted it, too. He merely needed more time – he wanted it to be good for John; he didn’t want to disappoint him or worse even, scare him off with his inexperience.
“The more you practise, the faster your body gets used to it,” John teased with a wink. “Do you need help with your back?”
With that, he let his hands run from the middle to Sherlock’s sides, stroking and smoothing over the straining muscles once more, making Sherlock sigh heavily. God, he could keep doing this all night.
Sherlock laughed at that. “Flattering,” he answered, not allowing John to speak on. “I rather meant this,” he gestured around. “Phoning them up, reserving a table.”
Sherlock readjusted his position, so he was facing John. The jealousy subsided a little, but a hint remained. It would probably always remain, even though he was aware that it was ridiculous. There have been other people in John's life – and that was good. They had made him who he was now. He wished he could voice those thoughts without sounding like an idiot.
“They’ve been teasing us since we met. I’m sure it won’t be a big surprise to them.” John chuckled. “You don’t need to worry about them.”
Sherlock nodded. “When they find a very good food source, they return to the hive and practically dance the directions to the other worker bees. That way, they give the exact directions to get to the flowers the bee has just visited. It’s their way of communicating.”
He glances at Sherlock through the windows of the cab, with his nose bloody and his posture hunched as if in severe pain. He watches Sherlock whose eyes are fixed on him as the taxi drives away. Mary tells him she likes him. He can't believe how that's possible after the show Sherlock has put on.
He runs the sponge over Sherlock’s clavicles, down over his pecs, his sternum. Sherlock meets his touches and leans in for a lingering, languid kiss, making John forget the sponge in his hand within a mere second.
Their naked bodies aligned as hands found heated skin, roaming over every inch they could get their hands on. The kisses turned more passionate by the second as their breathing quickened, and their gasps doubled in frequency.
John presses his palms to his eyes. He should have been there when it mattered, but instead, he has become the person Sherlock should be protected from, after all the pain he suffered because of him, the spiteful words and accusations he had to endure.
John pulled back when the weight of Sherlock’s head felt heavier on his chest than before, looking at him to ensure he was all right. As far as this was possible under the circumstances anyway.
“I’m not. Like you said, I missed my aim considerably yesterday,” John grinned and bumped his fist against Sherlock’s knee.
John entered the room again with a glass of water, dropping an effervescent tablet into it. It fizzed as it dissolved quickly. He sat down beside the bed and handed it to Sherlock. “Here you are.”
Sherlock loved kissing. The light tugs of John’s lips on his own, running his tongue along his lips and sneaking it into John’s mouth where it met its counterpart. That little moment of breathing into each other, inhaling each other’s air before their tongues separated and their lips met again only to part once more to let their tongues resume their game. It always made Sherlock smile, and it was quite hard not to break the kiss due to the involuntary curling upward of his lips when they kissed.
“Thank you.” Sherlock offered a small smile and John’s heart almost shattered to pieces when he realised he had never seen Sherlock so wrecked.
“Hey!” John huffs in mock irritation. “You should be thankful for all the clients you got because of the blog.”
John closes his eyes as anger flares up in his stomach. And why do other people always know what’s best for him?
John shook his head in disbelief, smiling sadly. “Despite your cleverness, you’re a real idiot sometimes, love.”
The next morning, John wakes to Rosie's happy babbling, the sizzling of a pan, cutlery clanking and a familiar smell of bacon and eggs wafting through this usually so empty house.
"I hope you were paying attention to my amazing massage techniques, by the way," John sighed, getting comfortable, lying half on top and half beside Sherlock.
Sherlock let out a sharp breath. It was hard enough to will away his budding erection in the pool when John had the chance of catching sight of it. He was entirely certain he couldn't ignore it now.
"Yes, I am," John answers with a pained smile at the image of Sherlock sitting in front of his room all this time, never replying to his texts, so John had given up sending any. Not a word. Nothing. "Thank you."
“Almost half 7 in the evening,” John answered as he brushed an errant curl out of Sherlock’s forehead.
Sherlock pulls his legs up further until they come to rest on John's shoulders; he's seeking the right angle but not quite finding it. John has found his prostate with his fingers before; he would again, just a little more …
“Don’t. Just, don’t. I should’ve listened to your friends when they said sex was all you’re after. Now that you’ve had it, I serve no purpose anymore. I thought you were different. Looks as if I was wrong.“ He buttoned up his shirt up to his neck, damning his fingers because they wouldn’t stop trembling.
He has never done this before himself, and the only time he had the opportunity to observe, his mind had practically exploded from the sensation, so he could not rely on experience but rather on instinct.
; what was that even supposed to mean? He had no feelings for John Watson. This was purely physical. No emotional involvement … right?
John sat down the small of Sherlock's back and ran his fingers over his skin. His fingers pressed along his trapezius on both sides – lightly at first, almost carefully. Sherlock revelled in the feeling of John's weight pressing him down into the mattress. It was a comfortable weight, not too heavy, not too light; and God, those fingers were a miracle. When John moved further up to the splenius capitis, he let out a quiet sigh.
“I’ve waited for this for years,” Sherlock whispers when his lips leave John’s for the briefest of instants. “Do you truly think I care about trifles like this?”
The rest of the day was very awkward. John made tea and made Sherlock drink it to keep him hydrated; Sherlock complained because he was feeling much better already and didn’t need to be coddled.
His counterpart's eyes gleamed, and he flashed a smile as he reached into the pocket of his jacket and revealed five little pills in a small plastic bag. "Like this."
He groaned and tried to take deep breaths, in and out, in and out again, focusing on the regular rhythm of it.
He didn’t have much time to give it another thought as John budged over and made room for him on the bed.
A quiet moan broke free from Sherlock’s chest. “Says the more socially adept one of the both of us.”
Sherlock’s fingers come up to rest on John's shoulders. He’s so close his breath is ghosting over John's skin and sending shivers down his spine.
"You said you shared a flat with Mike and Bill," Sherlock stated on one rainy afternoon. His head was nestled in John's lap. One of John's hands was in his hair, curling the soft locks around his fingers and twisting them in all directions. The light scraping on Sherlock's scalp made Sherlock sleepy; it was cosy. John radiated so much warmth. If there were one position Sherlock would remain in for the rest of his life, it would be this one. John's other hand rested on Sherlock's left shoulder, his fingertips ghosted over the fabric of his shirt, but his touches were strong enough to make him shiver nonetheless.
“Oh, darling.” She stopped at the top of the stairs and pouted playfully. “You’ll thank me one day.”
Sherlock decided to run and throw himself at John so he’d fall to the ground and he could rub all the snow in his face to take revenge, but he tripped over and slipped on the icy path leading to the front door, falling backwards and almost hitting his head on a very sharp stone.
They drank the rest of their hot chocolates before John got up and helped Sherlock into a standing position as well. »All right, love?« he asked as he brushed an errant curl from his forehead. Sherlock nodded and couldn’t help smiling at the fondness that lay in John’s eyes.
, someone whispers into his ear. He can hear the sneer in the voice. He doesn't need to look to see his face.
“Sherlock, look at me,” John told him firmly and finally he looked up. “There’s absolutely nothing on your bed or on your body. This is your mind playing tricks on you. It’s one of the withdrawal symptoms.”
John shakes his head and feels a sharp pain shoot through his temples. The little girl's voice keeps haunting him. Why does it sound different from Eurus' voice if it has been her all the time? Why does she look different? Why would the driver of the plane fall asleep in the first place? How could he–
"I assume you mean 'figuratively', my good doctor," Mycroft retorts, still smiling. "And it saddens me to hear my visit does not bring you joy."
He had to open the window wide because he suddenly felt too hot. He had never shared his bed with anyone before apart from Redbeard when he was little. And he didn't really count here. He didn't know how it would feel. Having John kiss him was already incredibly overwhelming, what would lying beside him be like?
“Sherlock, look at me,” John whispered, stroking over Sherlock’s shoulder blades and upper back. “Please.”
To his surprise John wasn’t back yet. He must be enjoying himself a lot at the Christmas market, Sherlock thought and went to his bedroom, storing the bags away. He’d wrap up the items later. Since he didn’t have anything else to do, he went back to the experiment that had not been very successful and abandoned eventually. It would give him something to do until his flatmate’s return.
Sherlock’s brows knit in a frown, but before he can say anything, a soft knock on the door disturbs them. A nurse pokes her head into the room. "I'm sorry to interrupt, gentlemen, but we've seen on our monitors at the nurses’ station that Dr Watson is fully awake now. I am afraid I have to ask you to leave, Mr …?”
Breathing heavily into each other’s mouths, Sherlock ran his hand through John’s hair, feeling the soft strands under his palms and between his fingers. It was even smoother than it looked.
Sherlock let out a bitter laugh. “No, not anymore. My parents used to take us down there when we were kids. When my brother left for university, I didn’t have anyone who’d go with me.”
But downstairs, the violin is still playing. Softly, as to not disturb the other inhabitants of this house, but John has always responded to Sherlock's playing. He rubs his eyes and quietly pads to the door, carefully opening it. He makes his way slowly down the stairs, leaning against the living room door frame, watching Sherlock play.
Instead he offered him a small and tired smile, hoping it would convey how thankful he was he didn’t have to go through this alone this time even though he couldn’t quite admit it out loud.
“Yes and no,” is the curt reply, and Greg knows better not to ask. “I've narrowed the possible places where our culprit might have been right before the kidnapping down to two places. I visited one of them, ruled it out, so it's only one place left: Bart’s. I need you to send me a copy of all the people working there. I need to cross-check the names with people we know.”
"Jesus, Sherlock," John panted and reached for Sherlock's arm. Sherlock was shaking out his hand from the pain he was probably still going to feel later. It was throbbing already. "Let's get going. Quickly."
Sherlock's head shot back up and his eyes focussed within a second. "John," he cleared his throat. "John." How long had he zoned out?
John's hands were on the waistband of his pants, and for a moment, Sherlock couldn't breathe at all.
Alison was an angel. She was absolutely adorable and charming, polite and sweet and John didn’t want to ever let her go home again. They played board games and watched telly and John made her a hot chocolate with a lot of marshmallows on top until the sun had set and it started snowing again.
John shook his head. “When I found out I wasn’t straight, I kept quiet about it in front of my parents. I didn’t want to accept it at first, but I couldn’t deny it either. Not to myself. Just to … everyone else,” he sighed. “When my father left, I thought I could stop denying it, that it might be different, but it wasn’t ­– not for a long time.”
He would tell a story with this composition, too. Perhaps not of the things they experienced or went through together, but of his feelings; the hurt he underwent when something or someone kept them apart, the luck of finally being able to be with the man he loved so much he couldn’t find the words to express it because they simply didn’t reveal the complexity and intensity of what was going on in his heart, the purely incredible feeling of love and adoration and ease when he was with him, the almost overwhelming fear of losing him again, the terror and fright that this might just be a chapter or merely a paragraph of a book that was about to end with neither of them seeing it coming.
“If the occasion arises, I can’t see why not,” Sherlock agreed. “You need some tutoring beforehand, though.”
“All the bloody time. In front of the cereal aisle at Tesco, during my dates with Mary – be it at a restaurant or during a quiet evening at home – when we were in be–“ he clears his throat. Great. So much for being honest. “Never mind, just … all the time. ”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as he turned his back to John and picked up another log. Not even a second later, he dropped them because something very cold and very wet ran down his neck. »John!!« he exclaimed and turned around abruptly, facing the doctor who couldn’t help but laugh.
He couldn’t risk another breakdown, another cold, dismissing glance in John’s eyes, another goodbye.
“She’s fine, John, she’s safe. You both are.” Sherlock’s voice is quiet and soothing. "We're taking good care of her. Just as you would."
For a brief moment, Sherlock truly considered offering to help John with his paper, but he dismissed the idea mere seconds after it had come to him. What sort of impression would that make? He was already on the list under the heading of “weirdoes” of almost everyone in his year. Why would he want to add John to the many people who already regarded him as such? Awkward smiles were enough, thank you.
He made coffee and tried to find something edible in his too empty fridge. An aspirin from the bathroom cupboard was unavoidable after all, and he figured John would need the same once he woke. He prepared breakfast – he hoped John would accept this for breakfast, anyway – for him. It was almost half past one, but he knew John would appreciate something to eat, especially the tablet. When he entered the bedroom, John was stirring in his sleep and eventually squinted up at him as he set the tray down on the bedside table.
When his eyes open again, a bright spark appears in them. “What? What is it?” John asks immediately.
»Adventurous, are we?« John huffed a soft burst of laughter and pressed a little kiss to the corner of his lips.
»Sherlock?« John called from the living room, both hands on the present that lay on the table in front of him.
Without thinking, he looked down at the mess between them and replaced John’s hand with his own. John’s cock was slightly larger than his own. Sherlock had already felt it, but seeing John like this, hard and aching to be touched, he felt another twitch between his legs once more although he had come not even a minute ago. John swore and squeezed his eyes shut as he bucked into Sherlock’s fist, firm and steady. It didn’t take long before he followed Sherlock over the edge, spurting over his fingers, his abdomen and his chest.
»Perhaps it’s time to stop dancing around each other and just speak plainly.« John cleared his throat and Sherlock fixed his gaze on him.
John grins and rolls his eyes as he runs his hand over Sherlock’s cheek and then brushes away an errant curl from his forehead. “That mouth of yours is very talented in various respects,” he tells him. “But I don’t want to come like this. Not tonight.”
The loving and gentle affection soon turned into a messy and wet collision of lips. Sherlock pressed his hips against John’s, in need of friction, and John was fumbling with the buttons of his shirt. Finally having removed the garment, he dipped his head and kissed Sherlock’s neck, scraping his teeth against the pale skin and leaving a dark purple mark on it.
"Because," she steps closer, pointing the gun at his chest, "it's fun," she whispers. "I advise you not to move …"
are! She wants him to find her anyway so why make things more complicated than they actually are?« the man in John’s lap bickered. »They could save themselves a lot of time. Besides, why does the beautiful girl always get to marry the prince at the end? This is so predictable.«
He wanted to spend as much time with John as possible and wanted John to want the same thing. He had turned his life around after a few hours only, and the impact he had on him was enormous. Sherlock wished John knew that, and he wished his role in John's life was just as important as John's was in Sherlock's. He shook his head. He knew this was ridiculous, but nevertheless, he wanted it more than anything. Meaning as much to John as he meant to him.
As if Sherlock cannot stand the idea of John kissing Mary's hair with the nondescript colour, he has to come back to give John yet another sleepless night.
It's this moment that John understands the only constant thing in both their lives is – each other. Sherlock has always been a fixed point in John's universe, even after his alleged death, his thoughts only revolved around him. And just like that, John has kept Sherlock grounded and focussed.
"He hasn't spent a single night at home, not even once. He's been sitting here the entire time except when he came back to take care of little Rosie. From the day you got shot two weeks ago until now. Sometimes he even brought her here," she tells him. "Towards the end of the second week, he asked me to look after your daughter and to bring him new clothes because he thought you were waking up soon and wouldn't leave this room."
Sherlock's eyes are on him. Almost piercing. John's mouth goes dry. He wants to refill his glass but resists the urge. Sherlock shakes his head, then looks down at his hands. "I never wanted to leave," he says slowly. "I did what I had to do. My brother knew that but didn't understand why it–" He clears his throat, "why it affected me so much. I ignored his comments until the final straw.”
»I told you there was no need for you to give me anything,« John grinned at him. »But it’s nice you thought of me. Thank you.« John leant over to give him a kiss.
“No, I mean, the version of you in my mind didn’t. It started with her hair colour because you couldn’t define it.”
Sherlock spins around as if he didn’t expect John to be back so soon. He reaches for a towel and John can see his fingers are trembling just a little. “Thought I could make myself useful,” he swallows, grabbing a mug and drying it. “While you were gone.”
John caresses his cheek with a grin, running his thumb over his prominent cheekbone. He looks so beautiful, and John cannot believe his luck. “You got all your data, then?”
802 days, 20 hours and 12 minutes after the moment that soon wouldn’t matter anymore, John sat in his armchair, typing.
He sucked at John’s bottom lip and deepened the kiss, tasting and licking and moaning when John’s tongue started to compete with his. It was like fighting without having the chance to win. John’s tongue simply overwhelmed him; he’d definitely underestimated John’s kissing skills.
They stayed in this position until it got too uncomfortable. John turned and sat on the edge of the bed and Sherlock felt a wave of panic run through his veins. “Where are you going?”
»See, told you you’d be back within just a few hours,« John chaffed. »Tell me about it once Greg’s picked her up. And don’t you dare mock the film or I’ll kill you,« he whispered into Sherlock’s ear. He tried to sound serious, but the detective noticed he was smiling.
“You may be able to cut open a corpse, but this…,” he pointed at the pumpkin, “doesn’t look like it’s going to end well. Neither for the orange pal nor you.”
John really seemed to be enjoying himself despite being watched by half of Scotland Yard. It was slightly scary seeing John behaving so differently than he usually did. Sherlock also wondered when he’d practised dancing. Sherlock hadn’t given him any more lessons after the wedding and John didn’t even tread on his shoes once. He was still a bit unsure where to step next, but once he got the hang of it, he was rather good.
Sherlock buried his face in John's neck, breathing shallowly against the shell of his ear. John had had all the good reasons to be upset with him, to be angry, to be disappointed. It was so selfish of him not to think of how much his behaviour must have pressed the knife into the wounds, deepened the scars on his soul, and tinged the bruises a shade bluer, danker. He was so selfish to think of his own pain only. He shouldn’t have to carry even more burdens because of Sherlock’s recklessness and inexperience.
To John, this seems rather out of character. Sherlock, who usually falls into a monologue every time he can, elaborating on everything that catches his attention, is now so quiet and curt? Something is off; there must be something Sherlock is hiding.
," Sherlock snorted. "None of them ever caught my interest. They were boring, chatting about makeup and gossiping all the time. I'm glad I was no part of that. Besides, feelings just get in the way of rational thinking. They cloud your judgement and leave you unable to assess objectively."
“I’ll try to care about that in the morning,” Sherlock answers with a shrug, yawning and probably feeling nothing but blasé about everything John has just said. The man is unbelievable. He nestles up to John, wrapping himself around him like a snake.
It was approximately 6:57pm when Sherlock began to feel cold. He pulled his dressing gown tighter around his body, wiggling his naked toes. Sighing, he got up from the sofa and went to get a pair of socks. He hadn’t bothered to get dressed this morning, as Lestrade didn’t call in on his services at the moment. What was happening to the criminal classes? There used to be more crimes before Christmas. It was disappointing. Were there no murders to commit? No (child) abductions? No attempts of blackmail?
“How about we finish that and shake a leg afterwards,” he teased Sherlock who was letting his eyes roam over the spectacle in front of him.
"I did not expect anything else from you," Sherlock says, nicking a piece of bacon from John's plate.
“Unlike you, I’m not behaving like a petulant schoolgirl who’s in love with the most popular guy at school.”
His arousal flagged a little, but he did not want John to stop. He wanted to know what he was going to show him. To feel. To finally feel.
John doesn't know if he's imagining things, but it feels like Sherlock's grip on his back tightens just a bit. Nevertheless, he takes that as an invitation to step even closer and press Sherlock tighter against him, burying his head beneath Sherlock's chin. "No matter how badly I screwed up, I have so much to thank you for."
Before he knew it, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder. Letting his head fall forward in defeat, he turned around, feeling naked and exposed under John’s clear and watchful gaze.
"Well," is Sherlock's short reply. "It's not that important to a doctor anyway. But gardenias need special care when kept inside. A particular soil, a certain temperature and high humidity. Need lots of light. Best grown in greenhouses."
He looked miserable when he came out and collapsed on the sofa, curling up into a ball and giving a whimper of pain.
“Bet you’re rather lazy sometimes,” Sherlock teased, opening his eyes and looking up at John with a smirk.
Sherlock turns his head ever so slightly so John can catch a glimpse of his profile, his eyes still half-closed. Sherlock opens his mouth to say something but evidently, decides against it. He just nods in thanks. He slowly makes his way to his chair, gently putting the violin back into its case. "I hope I didn't wake you."
»Good idea,« John smiled a little and sat back down on the edge of the sofa, resting his hand on Sherlock’s hip, well away from the contusion.
"Oh, I'm sure you are. First months are the hardest, I know," she sounded reminiscent now. Sherlock wanted to hang up before she would start talking about her freshman year at university. He'd heard the stories plenty of times, and the tongue lying in his petri dish right now presented a much more enjoyable way of spending his time than listening to his mother falling into melancholy.
He imagines Sherlock’s hand when he brings himself close to the edge. Those long, dexterous fingers around his aching cock. He doesn’t remember the last time he was so aroused, but that doesn’t matter.
The elder Holmes locks eyes with John, piercing him. The intensity of his gaze is overwhelming. It feels as if he leaves a hole in his body and fills it with ice.
“Well, he didn’t have to join Greg’s bet,” John laughed, eyeing the folding of the napkin in front of him. “How do they even fold those things?”
“No, and I’ve never been this drunk in my life either,” Sherlock told him, unable to hide a small grin over how stupid he was.
»Even when you came back, it wasn’t enough for me. I was aware everything would be different, but I didn’t expect it to be so … painful to even talk to you when I knew there was someone else in my life who kept me from you; that there was someone who hurt you on purpose; who almost
When he repeated the same on the other side, Sherlock’s hand found John’s hair, running his fingers over his scalp, through the blond wisps that always tickled his neck in the mornings when he woke up.
“I was on your mind when you were intimate with her?” Sherlock asks, incredulous. “That says a lot about your will to move on.”
“This is highly doubtful,” Sherlock answered. Irene headed for the bathroom and revealed various make-up utensils.
Sherlock was about to lose his mind. He’d never felt so uncreative and useless at the same time. He’d visited every wing of his Mind Palace in which he had hoped to find some relevant and helpful information and yet his endeavours were followed by utter disappointment and physical as well as mental exhaustion. His mood swings were tremendously awful and after a couple of days, even John began to suffer from a bad temper and fretfulness because he didn’t know what was wrong with Sherlock as all his attempts at making it better had either failed miserably or been rejected.
Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over.
“As if you’re any different, Bill,” John commented, sitting down next to Mike who was following the conversation in amusement.
John’s eyes were unreadable, neither cold nor soft, simply worried. “How about you just tell me the main reason?”
John shakes his head. It’s arduous to stay calm, but he knows he has to. “We mustn’t think about that.”
Sherlock found himself staring at John's bare chest. It wasn't the first time, and yet it felt as though it
“Hmm. Hey, beautiful,” John mumbled with a voice hoarse from sleep, which conjured a blush on Sherlock’s cheeks.
It usually didn’t take very long until John’s sleepy body stirred under Sherlock’s gaze, probably noticing the way the other person’s breathing changed. His lids lifted like a curtain, slowly and delicately until his eyes – those wonderfully blue eyes whose colour changed with the sun and the light – fell upon him. Those eyes were smiling.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pushed himself off the wall he was standing on. “Sorry, not interested.”
It had been almost an hour since he went to bed, but the chilly temperatures would not let him fall asleep. Tossing and turning, he finally came to rest on his right side and his gaze wandered to the misted-up window he almost couldn’t see through anymore. Squint-eyed he made out little drops on the cold glass, but it wasn’t raining; he would’ve heard it if it were.
“Must feel quite familiar to you, this,” Eurus says to John with her poisonous smile. “Same outcome. Just a different perspective.”
“Let’s just say I had a good teacher,” John whispered. “And you can’t deny that it comes in handy now and again.”
He can't choose. How could he? How could he condemn one of the people he loves most to death, to eternal quiet, when neither of them deserves this? How can he play God, when he has nothing to show for it in the first place?
get lonely,” Karla said with a smile that wasn’t sad at all. Really, it wasn’t. Sherlock remembered her smile. It was always happy, always warm, never tight like his own.
Sherlock’s hand moved back down again, playing with the waistband of John’s pyjama bottoms, not quite sure if he should cross this boundary.
It might have been seconds, it might have been hours, but for John, time stands still. His brain only focuses on Sherlock's lips on his. It's so different from what he had imagined and yet it feels so, so right.
»I did, but I don’t want you to force yourself to do anything you’re not ready for. You don’t have to do this to make me feel good,« John said and his voice turned serious. »Be honest with me, and most importantly, be honest with yourself.«
!« the detective exclaimed. »And even if I do, it is entirely your fault. My body isn’t used to all this physical exhaustion caused by certain bedroom activities.«
When Sherlock woke up, he yawned and turned onto his side sleepily, reaching out to touch the empty space beside him. He sighed; of course John would be gone. He should’ve known. The pillow still bore the indentation of John’s head, but he must’ve left the bed a long time ago because the sheets were cold now.
Her smile makes him feel sick. “You loved her still, even after you learnt about it, but let’s not talk about feelings. They only cloud your judgement. Isn’t that what you always say, Mr Holmes?”
John smiled briefly, but it faded after less than a blink of an eye. »It’s my favourite Christmas carol. My mother used to sing it for me a lot around Christmas time when I was still a kid. It was a bit like a tradition we maintained every year.« He suddenly sounded sorrowful.
would have such a deep meaning to John. He also hadn’t anticipated John would tell him all of it. It was hard for him; that much was obvious.
Their positions have changed during the night. Sherlock has turned around, and John's arms have wound protectively around him. Now, they lie pressed together back to chest.
Sherlock knew John was talking about volleyball and yet he was glad his cheeks were already red from the physical exhaustion because John would have seen him blush otherwise.
I'm so sorry I haven't updated for ages. I have to admit I'm not really satisfied with how it turned out, but I didn't want to keep you waiting even longer. I hope you enjoyed it anyway. The next update will come very soon. It's almost finished and I just need to do some editing. Feedback is always gladly appreciated! :)
Tiny snowflakes were falling from the sky. Some landed on the window and turned into drops of water. Some headed for the ground, dancing in the winter air.
John’s hands were on his wrists, pulling them away from Sherlock’s red eyes. He was still paler than he should be, but they had made it through the night and John couldn’t be more relieved.
"He's making a funny face," Eurus Holmes says as she raises the gun, pointing it at his head. "I think I'll put a hole in it."
“Quite patient whoever this may be. That’s unusual,” she said, lifting the blanket and sitting up. “I’ll have a look.”
“You would never guess,” Sherlock whispered into his ear, his nose brushing the soft wisps of hair that glowed golden in the sun. The light smell of lavender made its way up Sherlock’s nose. He had showered. Burying his nose deeper in the welcoming scent, John removed Sherlock’s hands from his eyes and turned around, smiling from ear to ear. “You all right?”
, he shouted at himself silently. The man approached him with big steps now, and his sleazy smirk exposed his teeth that flashed as brightly in the light as the blade did.
"This is bloody fantastic. I can't believe you only had three things to look at and came to that conclusion," he laughed.
"I need a shower." John looked back over his shoulder, still completely naked just like Sherlock himself. "Would you like to join me?"
“I can’t … I can’t do it, John. I don’t know how,” he breathes. His eyes are full of tears now. The last time he has heard him sound like that he was standing on a rooftop, about to go to his death. He sits up. “Forgive me.”
It was like a dream, the houses and cars and people they went past; just like a hazy glow, shadows about to vanish once he blinked.
John blinks up at him as his hand holding the glass is trembling slightly. Sherlock keeps staring back at him, piercing, cold eyes, and John sets the drink down. He releases a heaving breath and squeezes his eyes shut. "I should put Rosie to bed."
John’s fingers twitch, and without thinking, he sets the glass back down on the coffee table. It’s been a long time since Sherlock’s voice was this stern and firm. He swallows and rests both hands in his lap.
John directed a last warm smile at him, which he returned and then went back up to the promenade. He shook his head at the more than unusual situation he had found himself in today; almost dared to hope luck was on his side for once.
like if I hadn’t experimented. I’m glad I did. I mean, my preferences happen to apply to the label bisexuality, but you know, imagine this label didn’t exist. I’d still like men and women, and it wouldn’t be anyone’s business to deal with but my own. I don’t need to conform to any label to be happy or to feel normal."
»John John John,« Sherlock breathed into the crook of John’s neck when he felt his climax approaching and frantically pushed his hips into John’s hand gripping them more tightly now.
Sherlock gets in behind him, folding both arms around John's waist and pressing little kisses to his nape. John relaxes instantly in the warm water surrounding him. "God, that's perfect," he breathes out, letting his head fall back against Sherlock's shoulder.
The day of the party approached sooner than Sherlock preferred and he regretted his decision as soon as they arrived. When they entered the main party room, all the eyes were on them. He was sure they’d start gossiping any second.
John came back to the living room a few minutes later and handed him a little box with wooden figurines. »Do you want to use them?«
"I don't know. He didn't tell me much," John explains, clearing his throat. "Even though this is rather … personal. You know how he is when he's on a case. He doesn't want to treat her as one, but it's, well …"
He has a point there. He had needed this. No matter the emotional strain, even though it had been horrendous.
Closing his eyes wasn’t hard at all anymore. Sherlock nodded affirmatively when John put him back on the drip. John changing the compresses again a minute later was the last thing he noticed before he was lulled to sleep.
Everything went back to normal. They went on cases together, came home and were high on adrenaline, pulling at each other’s clothes before they had even made it to the bedroom and falling into each other’s arms after a heated round of lovemaking.
He heard his dark and dangerous laugh and saw the enraged smile on his lips, the coldness that lay in his eyes whenever he was angry or mischievous.
»John …« Sherlock tried to say something coherent, but all he could manage was another stifled sigh, mentally kicking himself for still thinking he had to be quiet. He never dared to be very loud, but John appreciated every sigh that came out of him, every sound uncoiling deep inside him.
Sherlock’s right hand found John’s shoulder and then his hair, slightly pulling at it; he couldn’t help it.
His entire body felt like it was burning. He felt so hot and overwhelmed, it was almost unbearable, but the last thing he wanted was for John to stop. He craved everything he was doing because it felt so much more intense in John’s presence. Every touch, every kiss, every lick.
“I’ll try to avoid it,” Sherlock whispered against the skin on his thigh, making John moan louder this time.
John stared at him, not knowing what to say. His mouth went dry and a cold shiver ran down his back. “So you decided to end your life before you even got there? Why would you even accept an offer like this? Your own death sentence.”
»He slipped and fell onto his back. Do you have Voltaren by any chance? And a pain killer, too, maybe?« John asked her and she hurried to the bathroom to retrieve the requested medication.
He was haunted by devious dreams in his slumber. They made him wonder how he could have been so blind.
Sherlock cleared his throat twice. »Good.« He was about to open the door when Mycroft spoke up again.
The detective suddenly felt very hot. His cheeks felt as if they were on fire and he was slightly sweaty.
He thought of the classical composers John had taken a liking to like Dvořák, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Bach or Beethoven when he heard Sherlock play their most famous works and let himself be guided by the masters of music, the talents of their time.
He budged up a bit to look down between their bodies and then closed his fist around John, causing him to gasp against his skin. "Fuck, Sherlock, hmm," he cursed when Sherlock started to move his hand, holding him the way he always liked it when he got himself off, which was, by all means, not very often, but he hoped John's reactions would tell him how to alter his technique to make it more pleasurable for him. John's movements faltered a little when Sherlock gave him the friction he so desperately needed, so Sherlock picked up the pace a little, feeling the pleasure build in his own chest. He was panting already and he knew it wasn't going to be long before the wave of his orgasm would come crashing over him, so he increased his efforts to bring John close, too. He wanted to feel him, what it was like to make him come with his hand, the sounds he would make, the way he looked when his orgasm overtook him. He wanted to catalogue the way his breathing changed and picked up, the amount of time he took to catch his breath, the change of tone when he moaned Sherlock's name the closer he got.
Sherlock carefully makes his way to his chair, trying not to step on any of Rosie's myriad of toys. He's eyeing John in this peculiar way of his, examining, calculating. John flushes. Might be the alcohol, might be Sherlock's intense stare, might be both.
His brother’s words clouded his head. Snarky, hurtful remarks. He hated Mycroft – he hated John – but most of all, he hated himself.
John doesn’t know when it started. The turning point. The point when, in his dreams, he stopped hearing the shattering of his flatmate's skull on the pavement, when he stopped seeing the blood-covered face – the contrast of crimson on parchment skin would have delighted any artist, but to John it meant not only death but also total devastation, downfall and decay – when he stopped hearing his own screams, desperation tasting bitter on his tongue as he hoped so badly that his distress, his need, his dying hope would reach Sherlock's ears, change his mind, make him turn around on his heels and jump down from the little step that separated reckless rooftop visitors, who stood too close to the edge, from their demise in a careless moment.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, held his breath and nodded his head with difficulty. Even if he wanted to say something, nothing but a choked sob would have come out.
Sherlock told himself that repeatedly as he spent ten minutes longer in the shower, used a little more product to keep his errant curls in place and chose his best-smelling cologne.
Sherlock turned around; he could see exasperation but also … perplexity. John didn’t know much about reading people, but it was written plainly on Sherlock’s face. He had no idea what to do and the entire situation was overwhelming him. Maybe John had underestimated the intensity and the complexity Sherlock was dealing with at the moment.
"Come on, I'll show you the rest of the house," he said then, leading John upstairs and showing him his room. "Don't mind the mess, I wanted to straighten some things up, but I need things within reach, and it would've been pointless–"
“Maybe. But one of us has to be,” John laughed softly, infecting Sherlock with it within one second only. Another thing he hated about John.
With a petulant pout, he reached into his breast pocket and regarded the ticket suspiciously. "Winter Wonderland," he scoffed and rumpled the little slip of paper, leaving both the card and a now very irritated-looking Irene behind by the table.
John caused him to arch his back, to crane his neck, to wrap his legs around John’s body and dig his heels into his bottom.
»If you don’t want to, I’ll go on my own. I’m sure you’re not done with your list yet,« the doctor smiled softly. »I’ll meet you at home.«
"You just couldn't let another man hurt you again even though he did it unintentionally," Sherlock concluded. "I understand it now, why you kept being so insistent."
Sherlock took a deep breath, gathering all of his courage to let John in on this. “I never brought a friend home before, apart from Molly. This is the first time.”
“We met briefly,” the waitress told him. “Your friend wasn’t very keen on listening to my advice about girlfriend trouble. Now I know why,” she chuckled softly.
The natural reaction that followed was John snapping at Sherlock on the slightest pretence like a sarcastic remark or a snort or even a simple sigh.
