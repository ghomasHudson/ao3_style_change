Dean laughs. “We don’t have time, baby. If we cancel again Gabriel might actually kill me. Besides, there’ll be plenty of time for that tomorrow.”
Cas nods. “If he didn’t remember what happened when you were a child, what did he want to talk about?”
He smiles, nodding. “Yeah, no problem. Glad you’re alright. He could’ve done some serious damage.”
Suddenly I remember what I took, rummaging around for the book. “I almost forgot to show you,” I explain, holding it up for them. “I saw it on the desk and thought it might have been useful.”
He’d asked after I’d made that odd sound for the first time. The sound I’d made again just before I’d noticed Sam. “Oh,” I murmur. “Oh. He thinks we were…I see why he was embarrassed, then. He thought he interrupted…”
When they make it to the park, Dean sets out a blanket, and they sit together quietly to enjoy their lunch. “You were right,” Cas smiles, leaning against Dean’s shoulder. “This is nice.” Dean smiles back, pulling him closer and kissing him softly. It’s peaceful until harsh voices pull them out of their little world, spitting hateful words as they pass along the path. Cas feels Dean tense, hears the growl that escapes his chest as he rises angrily off the ground as if to follow them. He grabs Dean’s shoulder before he can get far. “Hey, relax. Dean it’s not worth it.”
“What? No. I mean, he did, but I...I’m worried about you. Aren’t I allowed to be worried about my friend?”
“Honestly? I have no idea,” Dean admits. “But I wouldn’t worry about it. He knows what he’s doing.”
Benny glances up, following Cas’ gaze to the syringe in his hand. “No need to panic,” he says softly. “It’s just a little something to help you relax. You need to sleep, but I know you’re in pain and you got a lot of adrenaline running through you right now. It won’t knock you out or anything like that. It’ll just calm you down enough to fall asleep. It’s up to you.”

…Please, Sir…Pleasepleaseplease…” I hardly recognize my own voice, but at this point I’m not above begging.
Cas smiles, leaning up to kiss him softly. “I know, Dean. I understand. It’s okay. I promise I don’t worry about it all the time. Last night it just…spun out of control. On any normal day, I know.”
It’s another week before Cas deems Dean healed enough to move on from this place, and Dean is surprised at how disappointed he is about that. Each day he’d felt a little more normal, and while he still didn’t feel comfortable going onto the crowded casino floor, they’d spend time exploring the rest of the city. Cas had even humored him and taken a picture with an Elvis impersonator, and the photo made him laugh, for the first time in what felt like years.
He shrugs.
“I’m sure they will. We’ll make sure he pays, I promise you that.” He sighs. “You should get some sleep too. I’m sure he’ll be knocked out until the morning.”
“If that’s what it takes to show you that this isn’t something to fear, then sure. I trust you.”
He steps into the water, pulling me in behind him and settling me against his chest, his fingers moving lightly over my skin. “I don’t know how you do this,” I murmur.
I frown for a moment, thinking. “Did you…were you really scared I wouldn’t love you because you were human?” I ask, glancing up in time to see him blush.
She nodded understandingly, squeezing his shoulder again before getting up. “We’ll give you some privacy. Yell, if you need us. Well, if you need them. If you need me you’ll have to text.” Dean half-smiled at the joke, nodding and scooping Cas up from the floor. “Thanks. I’m gonna take him to my room, so I can clean him up and patch that cut. I’ll let you know when he wakes up.”
“You’re late,” he says. The voice startles Cas out of his thoughts, low and rough, but oddly soothing. No, wait. He’s not supposed to think that about the stranger in his apartment. Even if the slight growl in it makes him shiver. Cas opens his mouth to say something, anything, but nothing comes out. He closes it and tries again. Still nothing. Suddenly he realizes that the man has crossed the room to stand in front of him, still piercing him with his eyes, and he belatedly tries to step back, only to be stopped by the hand around his wrist. It’s not really tight enough stopping him from pulling away, but his body freezes up anyway at the silent order.
Cas hums, brushing my hair back lightly. “You’re doing most of the work, I’m just helping. But I’m really glad you’re letting me help. I love you, Dean...”
An edge of desperation leaks into his voice, and I sigh, hugging him gently. “Alright, I understand. Just try to calm down. It’s okay to be scared, but the last thing you need to do is panic. You went through something horrible, but you’re going to be okay. And whatever it is that’s not fitting together right now, we’ll figure it out. But for now, you’re safe from whatever’s going on. Just try to relax and focus on getting better for right now. We can deal with the rest later.”
I huff, finishing putting away the last of the dishes. “Dammit Cas, you know I can’t resist a promise like that...fine, I’ll do the chores.”
Cas nods, tightening his grip slightly. "I'm glad you enjoy it," he answers. "I would never be angry with you for wanting this."
I chuckle, but it turns into a gasp as his fingers move lightly over the bulge in my boxers. He grins, doing it again. “Cas, please…” I manage. “Just…please…” I can’t even be bothered to hate myself for begging. I just want him to touch me. His smile widens a little at that, and suddenly the fabric disappears and his hand is ohfuck stroking lightly along my shaft. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had handjobs before, but this is a horse of an entirely fucking different color. His thumb swipes quickly over the head, and I let out a breathy moan. Scratch that. This is my new favorite horse. I feel his tongue press flat against me, slowly traveling up the shaft before his lips wrap around me, and I struggle to keep myself from bucking into his mouth. As he continues to experiment with pressure and speed my breaths turn into a long and mostly incoherent string of his name mixed with every expletive I can think of as my fingers tangle in his hair, tugging lightly. His fingers run lightly along my inner thigh, and suddenly they move lower, and I freeze. “C-Cas…?” I manage.
Cas grins, kissing him softly. “As you wish. I’m so proud of you. Okay if I clean you up now? I didn’t want to startle you before, you were pretty deep in your head.”
Cas nods, supporting Dean’s weight as he’s slowly lowered to the floor, then carefully releasing his wrists, rubbing the tension from his shoulders. Dean leans helpfully into his chest, the occasional soft murmur escaping him, but he stays pliant in Cas’ grip. “Deep breaths, Dean. We’ve got you.”
He thinks for a moment, then motions Gabriel closer, whispering something in his ear that makes Gabriel’s eyes go wide. “Really?” he asks, glancing at Benny. Sam nods, blushing slightly. “Okay. Yeah. You got it.”
Slowly, a smile sneaks across Cas’ face. “I guess you’re right.” He pauses, thinking. “I do trust you, Dean. I know that probably doesn’t make sense, but I just…feel like I can. I’ve never felt like that before.”
Cas got their bags out of the trunk as Dean opened the back door, stroking Ben’s cheek gently. “Hey buddy, time to wake up. We’re home.” The boy blinked groggily, rubbing at his eyes before he looked up at the house nervously. Dean took his hand, squeezing it gently. “Jody checked it out, and it’s all safe now. You ready to go inside?”
Dean shakes his head. “Absolutely not. We’re not using you as bait. He’s hurt you enough.”
I think about it. “No, but my social compass doesn’t always point north, so I’m not the best judge.”
“Exactly. It’s gonna be fine. Trust me?” I ask. Sam nods, tensing slightly as I reach to brush my fingers lightly across his wings. He gasps, shivering, but doesn’t pull away. “See, that’s not so bad. It just takes a little getting used to. Okay if I keep going?”
“I don’t know about that,” Cas mumbles. “It was iffy for a while there.”
The angel snorts, smirking and lowering his zipper, pulling his cock out and giving it a slow stroke. “Happy to see you. The blade is in my coat.” Dean groans, his mouth already watering, and he leans forward only to be shoved back onto his heels. “Now now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. You know the rules. If you want something, you have to ask.”
He walks in a slow circle around me while I process this. “Your turn for what?”
I nod slightly, careful not to dislodge his hands. “Yes Sir. I trust you.” I almost surprise myself with the truth in that statement, but it seems to make Cas happy.
Sam rolled his eyes, shoving him lightly. “Shut up, jerk.”
I smile, watching him for a moment. “Cas?”
Dean chuckles, kissing him softly. “You worry too much. You did even better than I thought you would. You even made a friend.”
Dean glanced up, looking around. “Speaking of, where is he?”
Once out of the tub, Cas dries off quickly, then sprawls out on the bed, sighing softly into a pillow. Dean chuckles, climbing up to kneel between his knees, sliding his hands up Cas’ sides as he drapes himself over his back. “Is this part of the check?” Cas mumbles.
“Well of course I knew you were here,” he answers. “I just didn’t expect you to…I mean, you were…” he frowns for a moment. “You don’t remember?”
“That’s…dangerously close to blasphemy,” I murmur shakily as he runs his teeth along my jaw.
“I don’t know,” Cas teases. “I’m feeling pretty in love. Although that could just be the…what, four? Orgasms I had talking.”
He shrugs. “I didn’t. But the only time I see you let your guard down at all is during sex. You’re always in control of everything, every single day. I know it has to be stressful. So I thought maybe if you gave up control for a minute it might help you relax enough, and if I could overwhelm your brain with enough outside stimuli you’d stop thinking so much and let whatever was inside out. I think it was fairly successful.”
And that’s how he ended up here, lying in bed beside a nearly empty bottle, idly twirling a blade between his fingers.
“But…that doesn’t make sense,” I insist. “I’m not an angel.”
A strange, soft growl escapes him. “You are still an angel. And you’re still an asset,” he insists. “Cas, I don’t care whether you have powers or not. That doesn’t matter to me. Besides, you can still keep an eye out for me, probably better than anyone. The three of us are better than two of us any day. Besides, I’d…I’d like it if you came along.”
I think about it for a moment, then nods. "It is."
He thinks about it for a moment, nodding slowly. “I think so.”
Cas shakes his head, kissing me softly. “Well, I’m sure it helped that he had his big brother there to calm him down. I think it meant a lot to him that you were so accepting.”
Dean hums an affirmation, blushing under the warmth of Cas’ gaze as the angel starts to make slow, lazy thrusts into his mouth. It might have been embarrassing with someone else, but the way Cas looks at him, like he’s precious and important, like Dean is everything he could ever want, makes a little spark of pride flair up in the human’s chest. He’s
“What did he say?” Cas asks softly.
“I’m fairly certain I didn’t tell you to stop,” he growls in response.
Cas hummed softly. “I suppose you did. But...I didn’t tell you of my affection either. You got so angry at just the mention of it, I was worried you wouldn’t want me around anymore, if you knew how I really felt...”
I close the door quietly behind us, and Dean sighs softly, sinking down onto the bed. I sit beside him, stroking his hair lightly. “You’ve had a long day. You should rest.”
He nods, wrapping his lips around me again and slowly sinking lower, and my hand tightens in his hair as I moan softly. He groans back, his eyes closing as he moves. The very idea that this is real heightens my arousal, and I can’t seem to look away from the sight in front of me. His tongue teases just under the head, and a whimper escapes me. “Baby…close…” He pulls up slowly, stroking me hard and fast with his hand while his teeth tease at my thigh until I lose it, exploding over his hand and my stomach. I pant hard for a moment, feeling his fingers lightly massaging my thighs. When I open my eyes he’s looking up at me, licking the mess from my stomach. “Fuck…Cas…” I whine. He chuckles, kissing his way back up my chest.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Cas thinks. “I remember talking to him at the bar. He bought me drinks. And I remember being in his house. It started off okay, but then he got out of hand. I tried using my safeword and telling him to stop, but he wouldn’t. I remember screaming a lot. Or, at least, it feels like I screamed a lot. I think I passed out a couple of times, but when I woke up he was still there. And then the last time I woke up he was gone. I was on the floor and he’d cut off the ropes. So I managed to pull myself up and get my clothes on and I left. I have no idea where I was, but somehow I ended up at your door.”
“What? No! I don’t want you to leave, that’s not...just talk to me, Cas. You’ve been mad at me plenty of times, but I’m pretty sure you’ve never looked at me like that before. I’d really like to understand whatever the hell I did to piss you off that royally.”
This time it’s my turn to blush, and I look away. “Yeah. I know. I may not really get it, but I know.”
“Well…no, but…” I sigh. “Are you sure you’re okay with this, Cas? We don’t have to change things.”
“Please do. Now, I’m thinking mac and cheese for lunch. It’s been a while, but I think I can handle it.”
The full name is as close to an honorific as Dean is comfortable with. He’d wanted one, needed to separate this part of their relationship from the part they could show in front of Sam, but
Can you tell I'm a little excited? So Here's some plot and fluff (and a tiny bit of porn) to celebrate. Woohoo!
“I think we’ve discovered that heat is definitely a turn-on for you,” he chuckles, leaning in for a long, slow kiss. I whimper into his mouth as he tugs lightly on my clamped nipples, gasping as he releases them, rubbing over the sensitive flesh before ducking down to soothe over them with his tongue. I groan, pulling against the ropes again while he carefully wipes the toothpaste away. He shifts, blowing lightly over the head of my cock and chuckling when I jump. “Sensitive?” he murmurs.
Dean flushed, shrugging. “I…don’t know. I just don’t want to take advantage of you.”
“I suspect it might,” Cas answers honestly. “But we’ll take care of it. Let me worry about that, okay?” He carefully pulls Dean up from the floor, steadying him against the counter while he rinses his mouth out.
“Now...now I know it doesn’t have to be one or the other. He was wrong. But it makes me wonder...did he really believe it?”
Cas laughs. “Can’t say I have. Why?”
Dean snorts. “God, I hope so. For the record, that’s the way I want to go.”
Sam motions him closer, gently touching the white bandage on his temple, and Gabriel dissolves into tears, resting his head against Sam’s chest and blubbering something unintelligible into his collarbone. Sam shushes him softly, gently stroking his hair. “I love you…you can’t get rid of me that easy…”
He takes a breath, shaking his head. “No. It…it didn’t hurt. It just…felt weird.” His voice cracks in the middle of the last word, and he frowns, uncertain.
He feels Dean at his back again, mouthing at his neck. “You’re so pretty like this,” he whispers. “Such a good boy for me. You must be close, with all these hands on you…”
“Shut up.”
Dean chuckles, running a soothing palm along his thigh. “I know, baby. You love when I lick you open like this, don’t you?” Gone beyond words, Cas nods eagerly. “That’s my good boy.” He eases a finger in beside his tongue, and Cas shudders.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t you dare,” Dean replies, kissing his forehead softly. “I mean, you scared the shit out of me when you started screaming like that, but it’s not your fault.” Cas looks up at him, surprised to find wet trails down his face too, and he reaches up to wipe them away lightly. Dean gives a sheepish smile, glancing away as he wipes at his eyes. “Yeah, I know, I know. I was just worried about you. You’re sure you’re okay?”
“Dean!” Sam shouted, relieved as they rushed over. “Is he...is he okay?”
“Good boy,” Dean chuckles, skimming a hand down his spine. “So, let’s start here with the parts of the engine.”
“You know,” Cas mutters.
In the kitchen, Dean turns, smiling. “Hey, I heard you were feeling better today.”
Cas takes a breath, squeezing his hand. “I’m so sorry, Dean.” He sighs, glancing around the room. “I guess we should start packing.”
Benny rolls his eyes. “Hush, boy. I’m not going anywhere.”
When they arrived back at the bunker, there were a suspicious number of cars parked outside, and Dean frowned. “What did Sam do?”
Dean nodded, pinching himself to see if maybe he’d wake up from a strange dream. It didn’t work. “Uh, yeah, sure, I guess...so, any idea where that crate came from? Gabriel fuckin’ with us again or something?”
Dean snapped. “
I almost laugh as I think about how quickly the conversation went downhill. “He wanted to ask if I was gay.”
I growl at him, wrapping an arm possessively around Cas, who’s trying desperately not to laugh. “Shut up, Sammy. Like you don’t moan Gabriel’s name in the shower all the time. We all know you’re just begging to take it up the ass!”
“Deep breaths,” Cas advised, stroking his cheek gently. “It’ll get better soon, I promise. Can I touch you? It might help.” Dean nodded his consent, watching as Cas’ hand drifted to his erection, which had flagged somewhat at the pain, stroking Dean slowly. He let out a shaky breath, closing his eyes and resting their foreheads together as the pleasure distracted him. After a minute he found himself relaxing, and the pain eased, the burn fading beneath the pleasant hum. “Dean?” Cas murmured after a few minutes. “Still with me?”
“Okay, I’m sorry,” I sigh. “It’s just freaking me out that I can’t remember four whole days.”
I sigh, nodding finally. “Okay, I get it. But I swear if you hurt my brother…”
After a few minutes his breaths even out, and Dean is pretty sure that he’s fallen asleep, though he can’t bring himself to find out for sure for fear of disturbing this fragile moment, even when soft footsteps come closer. Sam only hesitates for a brief moment, an unreadable expression crossing his face as he notices their position, before sitting down across from them. “Hey. He okay?” he asks softly.
He shakes his head. “No. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s just…unusual. They’ve never…done that before.”
Cas grins, nodding and kissing me again. “Good. I can’t wait either. But not now.” I raise an eyebrow at him, and he smiles. “I know you’re tired after this morning. I have a better idea for right now.” He takes my hand again, pulling me upstairs and into the bathroom.
Dean brightens, nodding and hopping up from the couch. "I'm holding you to that..."
“So where do we go from here?” he asks.
“I couldn’t have, if it wasn’t you. You’ve been so patient with me.”
“You don’t even know what I’m apologizing for.”
I smile. “I like knowing how you’re really feeling.”
I can’t stop the whimper that escapes me. “Yes…please…” I growl as he continues his slow movements. “For God’s sake Dean, fuck me already!”
“Nope,” Charlie answered. “But I hope you’re ready to get your hands dirty. Come on.”
He’d shouted through his tears.
I leave him in the bathroom and go find Sam. “Ready?” I ask him.
“I’m not finished,” she says gently. “Dean, if you’re happy, then I could never be disappointed. Especially not in you. Yes, this is not what I thought would happen. But you have done amazing things for this world. And you’ve found people who make you happy. I’m so proud of you, Dean. And I’d be honored to have a chance at being a part of this family you’ve created.”
“Doesn’t know how…doesn’t know you want one too…take your pick. All I’m saying is, you really need to talk to him.”
He looks it over for a second. “That’s definitely a grace-binding sigil. It’s an old one, though. Not really popular anymore.”
“Maybe you should start explaining,” Sam counters. “How do you know he isn’t human?”
He raises an eyebrow at me. “Would you have discussed it if I’d brought it up?”
Dean helps him up, steering him over to the couch and carefully setting him down before disappearing into the kitchen. Cas watches him curiously as moves around the kitchen. “Dean? What are you making?”
He sighs, shrugging. “Well, Benny was slowly but surely breaking through my shell. He wanted me to really feel things, which I hadn’t done in a long time. This one day I went over to his house, and I’d had kind of a rough day, but I didn’t want him to know. So I was in his playroom, just kneeling on the floor, and this belt caught my eye. I’d been going down there for weeks at this point, and it had always been there, but for some reason that day it just set me off. I had a really violent flashback about my dad.”
Love,
"I know," he answers, still looking curiously at the bandage.
“You sound very sure,” I point out.
I run through a quick list of options in my head. I could try to turn it into a joke or be sarcastic to throw him off, but maybe this is a good thing. Maybe he should know. “Yes, it would,” I answer quietly. There. That doesn’t push him one way or the other.
I nod, reluctantly dragging my gaze back to myself, trying not to cringe. “I’m sorry,” I murmur. “This isn’t really my thing.”
I chuckle, kissing his cheek lightly and following him out to the kitchen. John doesn’t reappear until we’re almost done, and he seems to falter slightly before entering the kitchen. “Hey...I thought I smelled food...” he says.
“I’m glad you did,” he answers. “I know you don’t like to let things out very often.”
“How will that help?” Cas asks, puzzled.
Dean smiled, shrugging back. “I think it’s starting. Come on, let’s move up the street a little, we’ll get a better view from there.”
He glances down at my growing erection, raising an eyebrow at me. “Really?”
Before I can figure out how to end that sentence, Cas shifts up to his knees, cautiously leaning close and pressing his lips softly to mine. I’m too shocked to do anything at first. When I’ve finally wrapped my head around this enough to respond, I take Cas by the shoulders, gently pushing him back a little. He’s panting softly, his face red, watching me cautiously like he thinks I might throw him out. He looks somehow both aroused and scared. It’s a look I recognize from the time I set him up with a prostitute. The memory almost makes me laugh, and I have to bite it back. Knowing Cas, he’d think I was laughing at him and run away before I can explain. “Sorry,” he mutters, swallowing nervously.
“Love you, daddy. Love you, papa...” he murmured, snuggling closer.
“I t-think s-so,” Cas whispers, still clutching at Dean’s shirt with shaking fingers. “I s-should have realized it was j-just…You said it might…”
Cas nods. “Okay. I trust you.”
“I’m willing to give it a shot,” Sam says after a moment. “But if he thinks he’s going to start ordering us around again, it’s going to go sour real fast. And I’m not just going to sit there quietly when he starts saying horrible things about us.”
As always, please please review! I love hearing from you guys so much. And I promise I'll be back with a new chapter soon!
He shakes his head. “You’re not stupid, Dean. Just scared. But that’s okay. One step at a time, right?”
“The main floor has a big performance space that people can sign up for. There are some smaller spaces around that are public use, but people who really want to put on a show sign up in advance.”
“Cas, it wasn’t your fault,” Dean assures him. “We should have been paying more attention. It was a mistake on our part. But everything turned out fine. And it looks like the new title brings new powers.”
“You would?” I ask cautiously. He nods. “Okay then. I will.”
Cas grins and gives a short nod. “Alright then. I think I will.”
I frown at him for a minute, sighing. “You’re going soft, Sammy.”
Dean smiles, squeezing his hand as they park. "I'm glad you think so...I promise, it'll be fun. And you can always change your mind. Speaking of Benny, we've been invited out on Saturday. I think the whole group is getting together at the club."
Love,
“It’s okay,” Dean interrupts. “I don’t expect you to show up and save the day all the time. What you did was…very kind. More than I expected. So thank you.”
Cas smiled, kissing Dean’s cheek. “Go ahead, Ben and I will get the bags ready.”
"I know, it was kind of an impulse decision," I say quickly. "But...this is what I want, forever. So I thought maybe this way I could show you what you mean to me."
Cas chuckles. “Alright then. Let’s see what you can do.”
Dean pouts. “They didn’t even put my name on it?”
“You know you don’t…have to do this. I never expected…”
Cas huffs, kissing my cheek. “I wouldn’t say amazing...I just love you, that’s all. So, what do you want to do now?”
TheSongSmith
Realizing that he’s hyperventilating, he manages a nod, leaning into the light hold and trying to control the urge to vomit. Andrea murmurs to him softly, trying to soothe his trembling, and he turns into her shoulder when two security officers come up the stairs. It’s quiet for a few minutes before there’s a firm hand on the back of his neck. “It’s alright, sweetheart. He’s gone.”
Cas frowns. “What do you mean?”
I shrug, slowly reaching across the space between us to squeeze his hand. “I’ve got some time.”
“But…that doesn’t make any sense,” Cas murmurs. “Sam loves him. And nothing could have protected him from this. It was just…chance.”
Cas nods, stroking my hair lightly. “It’s a good thing, isn’t it? To have him admit he’s done something wrong?”
He considers it for a moment. “I don’t know. It’s very…human. But it’s more than that. It’s also very…intimate. It makes me feel closer to you than I’ve felt to any living creature in my entire existence. I get to know you the way no one else does. I get to make you feel good. And I like learning about all the inventive ways humans have come up with to do that.”
“Okay,” he answers calmly. “Then we’ll prove it. One step at a time. Close your eyes for me.”
Mary smiles, slowly rising from the chair to sit beside him. Dean stiffens, waiting while she looks down at the angel in his lap for a long moment. Finally, she looks up. “Dean, sweetheart…are you happy?”
“You’re probably right. But it sounds like he’s opening up to you a little bit. If our theory is correct, that’s huge. It means there’s hope for him, and that he wants to trust you, even if he’s not quite sure how yet. Just give him time. I have a good feeling about this.”
Dean goes quiet, shocked for a minute at his outburst. “You think I’m in love with him?” he asks quietly. “Cas, I love you. You know that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Everything is set up," Gabriel says in answer to Cas' look. "I'll be in when you're ready for me."
Cas groans softly, his grip in my hair tightening as I take him deeper. When I glance up he’s watching me intently. He grins when he notices me looking. “Good boy,” he murmurs, his hips starting to rock forward. “So pretty when you suck my cock, aren’t you?” I moan in agreement, and he gasps. “Who would’ve thought,” he chuckles. “Big, tough monster hunter…You’re so stubborn, Dean…and so thick-headed sometimes…but all I have to do is put you on your knees, and you turn into this gorgeous creature for me.” I blush at the praise, arching my back as Cas’ free hand skims along my spine, fingers teasing over my ass. “You submit so beautifully for me, pet,” he says, softer. “So eager to please…so obedient…such a good little slave.”
Dean considered it for a moment before turning around again. “Okay. I see your point. And I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be difficult. I’m just…frustrated. I want to be a real person again. I just…don’t know who that is anymore.”
I can’t help but chuckle. “Not the first time, or the last. You get used to it, actually. Besides, I had faith in you. You just needed a little reminder, that’s all. Now, let’s see what we can do about your new power-ups.” With Dean’s help, I set up a far room in the bunker with a bunch of old mannequins that were lying around. “Alright Cas, let’s see what you can do.”
“Both would be great,” I reply. “He’s in pain.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He growls, glaring at me. “Do I?” he mutters. “Is that why you’re here? You’re trying to shrink me? You should go get Sam, then the two of you can stand here and psychoanalyze me and my daddy issues! Lord knows it’s his favorite game! I’ll bet he can give you some guidebooks too.”
of his head against the door. “I wasn’t trying to upset you. Let’s just talk about this. Open the door, please.”
He shakes his head. “No. I mean, yes. Partly. But it’s not just the calm thing. It’s…I’m finding I enjoy being in close proximity to you. More than I thought I did. And when you touch where my wings would be, I get this feeling…”
Cas smiles, nodding. “Good.”
He turns to look at him, smiling shyly as the angel strokes his cheek lightly. “I’ve been thinking...this has been really awesome, and...I can never, ever repay you for all this. But...I think it’s time I went back.”
Gabriel nods. "Well then, my work here is done. Not that I think you really want to do anything else, but I'd suggest staying here together while things settle. New bonds can be distressed by distance so soon. And you'll probably both be a little emotional until you adjust to the new senses, but I think you're going to be just fine. I'll come back in a little while to check on you."
I shrug, leaning back against him. “Get me to relax like this. It never happens with anyone else.”
TheSongSmith
She scowls. “You did that yesterday. Dad, tell him he can’t clean his guns at the table to intimidate my date.”
Dean hesitated, trying to figure out what to say. On the one hand, he knew Donna and Jody would support him no matter what, but it was still nerve-wracking to say the words out loud and wait for them to react. Still, it might be good to have someone to help him sort out the mess in his head. “Well, it’s...kinda complicated,” he said finally.
I nod slowly. “Thanks. I know it’s a big deal, but I’m not going anywhere.”
I sigh, crossing my arms over my chest. “So? What is this great wisdom that you think will help?” I grumble.
“P-Please Dean…please…f-fuck, I’m gonna cum….Please!” he cries.
“No,” Dean scoffs, “I think you look healthy enough to enter the Iron Man competition.”
“Whiskey?” he asks.
“Something like that,” I answer softly. “A lot of angels don’t look hard enough to see it. They only see the war and evil that is present in your world. But you also have love, and affection, and beauty. So, no. I didn’t find it boring.”
Dad hesitates for a moment, nodding. “Yeah, just...could I speak to you for a minute, Dean? In private?”
I glance up to Sam, thinking about something he said earlier. “Sam? Can you tell me what this was about?” I ask, motioning to the unconscious man in my lap.
The angel hesitates, but seems to realize that he has no other choice. He closes his eyes, and suddenly enormous black wings sprout from his back. Both Dean and I freeze, awed by the reality of something we’ve only imagined. Even bloodied, torn, and twisted at unnatural angles, the wings are magnificent. But the closer I look, the more damage I see. It’s clear that the bones, or whatever infrastructure the wings have, have been snapped in several places, making them hang limply, twisted into painful-looking positions. Blood trickles slowly from several gashes, the feathers matted with dried clots. Worse, it seems bringing his wings into this plane of reality have made their pain more real as well, and his white-knuckled fingers grip the blankets tightly. “Sam,” Dean murmurs, “Are you sure you can fix this?”
Slowly, a grin spreads over his face, and he throws his arms around my neck, hugging me tightly. “I love you, Dean. Thank you.”
Cas shivers at his tone, fighting to keep from seeking friction against Dean’s leg. “I suppose we should even it out, Sir,” he murmurs. The pad of Dean’s thumb rubs lightly over the initials on his collar, a reward, before his hand comes down again, harder than before. It takes Cas by surprise how intensely pleasurable it is, and the low moan is tumbling from his lips before he can stop it. Dean chuckles as he rubs gently over the quickly darkening skin.
I grin, hugging him closer. “Why the sudden interest in all things sex? Not that I’m complaining or anything, but you seem to have fully jumped on the bandwagon here.”
I nod quickly. “Yes Sir…”
“I can see that. How are you doing with the whole ‘touching’ thing?”
“How?”
“’Mazing,” Cas murmurs.
I frown. “That assclown is going on a hunt with you?”
Cas frowns slightly, considering his answer carefully to find one that Dean won’t outright reject. He knows that, in this state, arguing about Dean’s worth is pointless. “Because I would very much enjoy doing that, if you’ll allow me to,” he says finally.
I nod, drawing him closer. “Well, they are brand new. They’re going to be sensitive to touch for a while, the way human infants are sensitive to sound. They’ve never been touched before. It’ll take some time to integrate the sensations properly. We’ll just have to be gentle with them for a while.” Cautiously, I lightly run my hand over his outer feathers, which should be the least sensitive, feeling him shiver. “Is that bad?” He shakes his head, his eyes closing as I continue the gentle stroking motion. A soft purr rumbles out of his chest, and his wings spread, giving me better access. I smile, stroking the tips with my own, encouraging the display of trust. Dean stays mostly quiet, his breaths fast but soft against my chest, aside from the occasional sounds of pleasure that escape him. I work my way carefully through every feather, lightening my strokes on the more sensitive areas to keep from overwhelming him with the sensation. If he’s willing to trust me so openly with this, the last thing I want to do is hurt him. And he does seem perfectly trusting, relaxed completely against me, making no attempts to hide his pleasure. I press a soft kiss into his hair as I move to the other side. “How’s that?” I ask softly.
Cas nods in agreement, humming softly as Dean carefully cleans him up and helps him change into pajamas. When he glances back at Benny, something shiny catches his eye, and he frowns. “W-What’s that?” he asks nervously.
He grins lazily. “I was always yours.” He sighs happily, looking up at me. “I can feel you now.”
at me, leaning in to kiss me softly. “Why don’t you go take a shower, Dean?” He says casually. “I’ve read it’s supposed to help congestion.”
“It could be,” he agreed. “But I don’t think we can know if we’re right or not until Dean is ready to talk. I’m guessing that’s...going to take a while.”
“That’s probably a better idea.” He grips my arm tightly, and we slowly make our way into the bathroom. “I’m sorry,” he murmurs when I set him down on the edge of the tub. “I don’t mean to be so dependent.”
He chuckles softly. “Alright, if you’re sure. Mind taking care of the clothes for me?”
Dean shakes his head. “Nah. I think they just got used to being close. They’ve always been friends, and they both did a lot to raise Sammy and I. Ellen lost her husband around the same time Bobby lost his wife, so they just kinda look out for each other now. We’ve tried, but they’re both so stubborn.”
I nod, sitting down on the arm of a chair. “Yeah, I guess a lot has changed...”
“Are you sure?” he asks. “We don’t have to. You can safeword. I won’t be mad.”
A soft whine escapes me as he begins to plant heated kisses under my jaw, undoing the top two buttons of my shirt. “Dean…you know I’m bad at being quiet…”
“Do you…miss it?” Sam asks cautiously.
Cas chuckles. “I take it that means you approve of this plan?” he asks, continuing the light teasing.
I swallow, nodding slowly. “Yeah, I know. I’ve just…I haven’t really done that before.”
Castiel shakes his head. “Don’t apologize, Sam. I know you’re trying you’re best. You’re already doing more than necessary to help me.”
“Huh. Well that’s good I guess. So, what’s the plan?”
Benny chuckles. “Yes, you can. It’s real simple. Just sit him down in the bathtub and let warm water run over it to get the residue off. You don’t even have to touch it. It might sting a little at first, but it shouldn’t be that bad. I know you don’t wanna hurt him, but if you don’t keep it clean it’ll be a lot worse. Then just leave it as it is and let it dry out. You’re gonna be just fine, Cas. And I’m not far if you need anything.”
Dean flushed slightly, shaking his head. He finally met Cas’ gaze again, smiling shyly. “Trust you.” Cas smiled, kissing him lightly and stroking his hands over Dean’s skin until he felt the other man relax. He clicked open the bottle quietly, pressing kisses along Dean’s jaw. Dean gasped softly at the first cool touch, letting out a shaky breath against Cas’ shoulder. It wasn’t fear, exactly. At least, not anymore. Dean had grown more used to this, from his trials with Cas and alone, and had even come to enjoy it, but the initial touch was still a little jarring, and he took a breath, letting it out slowly as he relaxed again. He felt Cas smile against his temple, pressing a soft kiss there as his fingers moved in gentle, unhurried circles, letting Dean get used to the sensation. “‘M not gonna break,” Dean mumbled into the crook of his neck. Cas hummed in agreement, slowly easing one finger into him.
“Yeah,” I nod. “It’s just…different. Give me a minute to get used to it.” he smiles, nodding, his fingers tracing light patterns over my ribs as I listen to the sounds of his heavy breaths, my muscles slowly relaxing as the discomfort eases. “Wow,” I whisper into his hair.
He looks away. “It’s…complicated. And probably dangerous. More danger than I should be willing to put myself in. And yet, I have no desire to stop it.”
I smile, pulling him down the hall and out the front door. “No. first, we go take a walk.” He raises an eyebrow at me, puzzled, and I grin. “What? You always say you like long walks on the beach.”
“I’m sure,” he chuckles. “After the day I’ve had, I need to let go for a while. You’re good at that.”
I nod, kicking the blankets off and snuggling closer to him. “Yeah. Must’ve just caught something.”
He turns his attention to the TV, staying quiet until Sam comes in, carrying large plastic bags. “Sammy!” They both shout, getting off the couch and moving over to hug his legs.
“That’s fairly accurate, yes.”
“Dean!” I call out, trying to wave away the smoke enough to see. As it starts to thin, I see Sam’s figure, looking around wildly. He sees me, moving closer.
Something in him relaxes a little, and he nods. “Good.” Smiling a little, he leans closer, softly pressing his lips to mine. “Come on. I can think of a lot of fun things we can do in bed.”
“We’ll find a way,” she assured him, and Dean allowed himself to be comforted for a moment by her confidence before he continued searching.
I swallow, shaking my head. “It’s not just that, though. Even before, I never…treated you the way I should have. You were so good, and always willing to help me, and I just pushed you away. And then when I saw what you saw, I thought…Of course you’d believe it. I’d been treating you like crap for so long, and I just…I’m sorry.”
Sam comes back to take the tray out, staying mercifully silent about our position and stooping to pick up the crumpled ball of paper by the door. He smooths it out, frowning. “What’s this?”
“Dean needs you,” he says simply. “This way.”
“I’m sort of fond of you too,” Cas chuckles, kissing him softly. “And I appreciate your protective instincts, but don’t lose sleep over it, okay? I swear I’ll call you if there’s a problem, but I’m really okay.”
He nods. “Much better.” He pauses, watching me for a moment. “Are you really…denying yourself, like he said?” he asks cautiously.
Cas, for his part, is more than happy to find new and interesting ways to put him on his knees, and the kinky fucker could get pretty creative. The fact that he could poof up whatever crazy bullshit crossed his mind doesn’t seem entirely fair to Dean, but he also wasn’t going to complain, since just about everything the angel had come up with so far had been awesome. Besides, he knows the angel wouldn’t hurt him, not really. In fact, he was downright fanatical about Dean’s wellbeing sometimes. But Dean had learned quickly that the faster he bit back his pride and just gave in to Cas’ ideas, the sooner they could get to the mind-blowing sex portion of the evening. It isn’t like Cas is going to judge him for not putting up enough of a fight to be believable, and honestly, Dean gets tired of putting up the front. So with Cas he just doesn’t, and they’re both happier for it. And sometimes, when Cas is really pleased with him, he’ll say Dean’s favorite words.
"They'll both be a little tender for a while," Gabriel answers. "But it won't be too bad. Did Cas explain what happens in a bond like this?"
He shrugged sheepishly. “She kind of predicted this a while ago.”
Cas nods. “Would it be possible to get someone to see him here?”
The first words Cas manages are “Holy shit,” which makes Dean laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he sits back again, I get I a quick view over his shoulder, and I’m shocked to see his cock half-hard and twitching against his belly.
He chuckles, kissing along my jaw softly. “You are worthy,” he whispers again.
“Okay,” he nods, kissing him again. “Goodnight.” He turns to go, but stops and pivots back. “Hey Cas? Why don’t you come over to my place after work tomorrow? I’ll cook.”
Cas nearly groans at the growl in his voice, nodding quickly. “Yes Sir.”
I smile, smoothing a hand down his spine soothingly as another tremor runs through him. “I’m not sure that’s wise,” I murmur teasingly. “I was holding back this time.”
He nods, watching carefully and dutifully performing the simple tasks I assign him. Together, we manage to make something edible out of whatever Dean was attempting. Cas sets the table, glancing up at me as a crash sounds down the hall. “Do you think he’s okay?”
I keep my voice carefully neutral as I step closer. He may be yelling, but at least he’s releasing something. “Dean, I’m here because I care about you, and it upsets me to know that you’re hurting. Will you talk to me about it?”
“Nothing, nothing,” Cas answers quickly. “I was just thinking.”
When I turn back to Cas, he’s giving me that head-tilting look again. “Is there a problem, Dean?”
Cas was quiet for a moment, and Dean wasn’t brave enough to look up at his expression. “Dean?” he said finally. “Please look at me.” Slowly, he glanced up, surprised at the concern on his face. “Dean, whatever it is, it would never change the way I think about you, and it certainly wouldn’t make me not like you. I don’t want you to tell me because you think it’s what I want. I only offer in case you want to talk. And it doesn’t have to be now either. But I’m not going to turn on you, no matter what you tell me, or when.”
Dean shakes his head. “I don’t know, Sammy. Something doesn’t feel right this time. The hair on the back of my neck has been standing up for days. I just…I think something happened to him.”
at me, Sam! I mean seriously, gross. Why does everyone always assume we’re a
I grin up at him. “I’m incredible,” I pant. “Please, Dean…more!” He laughs, setting a steady, smooth pace that completely breaks any semblance of control I had left.
to do it. Cas I’m okay. I’m not gonna break, and I’m perfectly capable of telling you to fuck off if I don’t like something. I trust you. It’s time to stop tiptoeing around and holding back for my sake.” Cas still looked hesitant, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay, new rules. First, you get blanket permission to mark me whenever you want, as long as it’s not anywhere the kid’s gonna notice. That’s just hot as fuck. And second, you’re going to stop holding back and do whatever
“That’s kinda weird to think about,” Dean admitted, kissing his head lightly. “But we have the rest of our lives to figure it out, right?”
“Well I can see why, given what you’ve told me about it.”
Cas smiled, nodding quickly. “You’re welcome to stay here as long as you want,” he said. “It’s just me here, so...it’ll be nice to have some company. So, breakfast?”
I’m about to reply when a blinding light slams its way into my head. When it fades the angel is gone and I’m looking at a twisted version of myself. The room comes into focus, and Cas is there, strapped to the table he’s drawn so many times, struggling as the other me walks closer. “No! No no no. Stop! Cas!”
Sam snorts, holding up a piece of plastic. “Really, an empty M&M’s packet is completely necessary?” Dean snatches it away from him, and I can’t exactly tell, but I think he’s put it back in the trunk. Sam rolls his eyes, glancing back at me. “Cas, your boyfriend is a hoarder.”
Dean looked up at him, frowning and digging in his pocket for his pen.
“Cas…” he breathes, “You might want to stop now…” Cas is fairly sure he understands, considering the little rolls Dean’s hips are giving, but he doesn’t want to stop, and it certainly doesn’t seem like Dean wants him to either. He hums a little in response, and Dean gasps sharply, pushed over the edge. He swears he hears his name somewhere in the moan that accompanies his release, and if the light trembling in his thighs is anything to go by, he supposes he wasn’t too terrible. He waits until Dean is finished before swallowing, savoring the taste that’s decidedly Dean before gently licking him clean, committing this image to memory and purring at the hand that strokes through his hair. “Jesus Christ, Cas,” he pants, pulling him up from the floor and into his lap.
Dean huffed, frowning at that. “I guess that’s fair. But you can’t deny that ever since you found out about this whole thing with me and Cas, you’ve really been pushing me to put a label on it. Not everything needs to be labeled, Sammy. I don’t need to say that I’m gay just to make you happy.”
Dean runs a hand through Cas’ hair, and he looks up. “What kind of things do Meg and Ruby do?”
He manages to get Dean up and wrapped in a towel, drying him gently and helping him into soft pajama pants. He’s already struggling to stay awake, and doesn’t argue when Cas carefully picks him up, leaning into his chest and wrapping his arms around Cas’ neck. He doesn’t let go when they reach the bed, and Cas smiles, sitting down and settling Dean in his lap, cradled against his chest. Dean looks up at him, surprised, but Cas just smooths his hair back. “I’m going to check your health,” he says, settling a warm hand against Dean’s bare chest. “It won’t hurt.” Dean nods, his eyes fluttering closed as he rests his head over Cas’ heart, feeling the steady beat beneath his cheek. He gasps softly when Cas starts, feeling his grace humming beneath his skin, spreading warmth through his body. He doesn’t have the strength to worry about what Cas will find, trusting that, whatever it is, Cas will take care of it.
“That’s why I bought this,” I remind him. “I can do this. And if you think it might help, then I’m willing to try.”
Cas smiles from his place against my side. “Good morning, John. There’s coffee in the kitchen, and cinnamon rolls if you’re hungry,” he says, ignoring dad’s discomfort.
In the morning, they both woke up to the sound of movement in the kitchen. Dean frowned, alarmed, but Cas chuckled. “Just Charlie,” he explained. “Sounds like she’s making breakfast. How are you feeling?”
Cas whimpers again, shaking his head frantically. “No, I don’t care. I don’t like hospitals. Please, Dean…”
Benny nods, putting on clean gloves and carefully spreading cool cream over the wounds, and though Cas hisses occasionally, he manages to stay relaxed. “I told you this part was easier,” Benny chuckles, wiping his hands off on a towel. “Now, let’s get you bandaged up. Dean, can you help him sit up for a minute?” Dean nods, carefully holding him upright as Benny places a layer of gauze and then wraps a bandage around his torso. “Alright. How’s that feel?”
I chuckle, drawing him closer, the wing wrapping around his shoulders. “Okay, I promise.”
“Impala, Sir,” I murmur, leaning into the soft touch.
“Hey Dean?” Cas said after a minute. “What if we did this again?” Dean frowned a little, glancing up at him curiously. “You said it’s easier to talk in here, right? What if we made this our spot? So if you want to talk about something, you don’t even have to ask. You can just bring me down here, and I’ll listen.”
“Don’t you think I…?” Dean starts before the venom leave his voice. “I tried,” he mutters, defeated. “Two days ago. Nothing.”
“Oh shut it,” Gabriel snorts, nudging him back. “Alright, if you’re sure about this...so are you gonna sit him down and tell him in advance, or are we just throwing him into the gay fire?”
“A couple of times,” Dean nods. “Enough to break me of my fear of it. Not often after that, though. He knows I’ve never really been able to like it. But I was able to tolerate it without freaking out. He knows what he’s doing.” He pauses while Cas considers this. “Hey Cas? How much do you remember about what happened?”
Dinner turns out to be far less awkward than Cas had anticipated, which makes the three hours he spent panicking seem silly. The restaurant Dean picked, a place called the Roadhouse, is warm and inviting, and seems to be exactly the kind of place Dean would belong. He’s already waiting in a booth, sipping at a drink, and when he catches Cas’ eye and grins the fluttery feeling in his stomach settles. “I’m glad you came,” Dean murmurs, leaning in to kiss him softly.
He sighs. “Yeah, I mean…never mind. What happens to us…after?”
Hello all! We're back with something of a random, fluffy chapter because I just needed to write fluff today :D
Dean nods, reluctantly getting up and wrapping his arms around Cas’ waist. “I love you,” he murmurs. “But I still like it better when I get to tie you up.”
“Oh, you have no idea,” Cas grins. “But he’s not coming until tomorrow morning. Looks like we’ll have to face this one ourselves.”
I chuckle softly, pulling back enough to look at him. “Dean, there is nothing more sacred than this,” I murmur, my fingers lightly ghosting over his ribs. “You are a perfect reflection of my father’s divine creation. The fact that you are willing to share yourself with me this way is nothing short of miraculous.” I can feel the dark resistance to my words building up in him, thick with fear and hurt. I kiss him hard to halt its progress. “Dean Winchester, you are perfect, and beautiful, and…worthy. And if I have to worship every inch of you every day for the rest of eternity to make you understand, then that’s exactly what I’ll do.”
I frown, rubbing his back lightly. “I’m sorry, Dean. I know that’s a scary dream. But I promise you, that man will never hurt you ever again. I won’t let him.” He smiles a little, nodding, and I have an idea. “Do you want to hear a story?”
Cas whimpers, managing a strained, shaky “Please…”
I smile, pulling his chin up for a gentle kiss. “Well, I think we can probably arrange that.”
She closes the door behind her, and Cas turns back to find Gabriel on the verge of hyperventilating. “Hey, Gabe, listen to me, alright? They’re doing everything they can for Sam now. This wasn’t your fault, and making yourself sick over it isn’t going to help him. I need you to take deep breaths. They’re going to have someone come check you over in here, so you don’t have to go anywhere, and if we get any news you’ll know right away. Just try to stay calm for me, okay? We’re going to get through this.”
His hand slips down to stroke lightly along my leaking cock, and my breaths grow frantic again. “Look how hard you are, pet. You’ve been so good for me. And you are so pretty when you beg…”
He presses something hard into Cas’ hand, connected to a strap that fastens around his wrist. Cas frowns slightly, feeling around the object. “What is it?”
“The better question is why you don’t answer your phone!” he says irritably as he stalks into the apartment. “I take it you haven’t seen your mail yet.”
Gabe blushes, looking over Sam's shoulder to Dean, who smiles and nods to him. "Well, I...my brother can tell you that I've never really been a sap. I just kind of thought long-term relationships weren't my thing, but...now I think that maybe the people I was with weren't my thing..."
“Bad man,” he mumbles against my shirt. “Hurt.”
He immediately turns bright red, shifting uncomfortably and refusing to look at me. “They just...k-kind of appeared, like an hour ago...I-I don’t really know...” he mumbles.
Good morning, my loves! Here's a new chapter for you :)
“My family, love,” Cas reminds him.
“You could say that,” Cas gasps out, his eyes fluttering closed for a moment.
Sam frowns slightly. “He doesn’t remember? Well, that makes sense, considering what he was asking Gabe about...”
He frowns, trying to find the right words, and I kiss him softly. “That’s alright. Just wanted to make sure I didn’t do anything wrong.”
They spend the rest of the morning like that, lost in slow, lazy kisses until Cas’ stomach starts to grumble. Dean chuckles softly, running a hand through his messy hair. “Come on. Let’s go get you some food.”
Hello my lovely readers! We're back with a new chapter. This one is in Cas' POV; thought I'd switch it up a bit this time. Enjoy!
“Oh. Thanks,” Dean nodded, giving a half-wave as Sam wandered back down the hall.
Cas shrugs. "I asked Gabriel to wipe his memories and give him a new, human life."
Cas chews at his bottom lip for a moment. “I…have a request,” he says cautiously.
“What happened to Sam wasn’t your fault, and you know it,” he says calmly. “You tried your best, and you did an amazing job keeping him as safe as you could. You can’t control everything, Dean, and that doesn’t make you a failure, despite what the voice in your head tells you, nor does this make you weak. I know how much Sam’s death hurt you, and I should have known better than to leave you in that state. That was my fault, and I’m sorry. But you’re not bad, Dean. And I know you don’t believe me yet, but I’m going to try my best to show you.”
He takes a deep breath, swallowing hard. “I’m okay. Sorry, just…startled me a little.”
“It seems that way. It is a great crime among angels. He will be severely punished for it, I assure you.”
Gabriel hesitates. “When you say ‘everything’, does that include…”
“Don’t worry about it.” He sighs, running his fingers lightly along Cas’ spine. “As much as I’d like to lie here with you forever, we’re both going to be really gross if we don’t get cleaned up soon.”
“Sure, sure,” he laughs. “You two have your kinky pizza sex. I’ll see you later.”
Cas hesitates for a moment, but nods, leaning heavily into Dean’s chest. “Okay,” he murmurs faintly, the words heavy with pain. “I trust you.”
That, at least, is enough to get Cas’ attention, and he raises his head from the pillow. “We’re not having sex where Bobby can see us.”
I glare, silently debating how upset Cas would be if I ganked his brother. “Listen douchenozzle, I’m not in the mood for your shit right now. Go away.”
“They’re certainly trying,” I answer softly.
, by his own inability to keep them under control. It was probably safer to say nothing, but Dean continued to look at him curiously, even as the angel’s eyes bore into the carpet. “Cas...’s there something you need to tell me?”
He watched her leave, then wrestled the angel into an old, faded T-shirt and sweatpants before starting to clean the cut at his throat.
I nod. “I can’t really seem to think about anything besides you right now. It’s kind of nice.”
“Nothing, for a minute. And then he just looked at me like I was stupid and told me to get my ass in the house before I froze to death. I know it sounds harsh, but that’s kind of how he shows affection. I was so surprised that I asked if he was sure.” Cas chuckles. “He didn’t answer that, just stood there and waited until I came inside. He was very quiet for a minute, and then he asked if my dad was the one who gave me that shiner. I just nodded, and he nodded back. And then I turned around and Ellen was there, and I guess she’d heard the whole thing. She was crying, and the only time I’ve ever seen her do that was when her husband died, and even then it was very rare. She just hugged me and told me that I wasn’t alone. And I just broke down. I haven’t cried like that since I was five. But for the first time in so long I felt safe. And she just waited patiently and cleaned me up when I was done and we had dinner.”
A shiver creeped up Cas’ spine, though he couldn’t quite determine why. Still, something about the way Sam was speaking was unsettling. “What’s wrong?”
I smile, lightly stroking his wings with mine. “They’re the color usually reserved for archangels. I did not expect that. But if that doesn’t speak to the purity of your soul, I don’t know what does.”
Meg chuckled. “The fact that you’d even worry about that tells me you’re doing just fine. And for the record, Ben really is doing extraordinarily well for a kid who’s been through all that. He’s leaps and bounds ahead of where I thought he’d be by now, so try not to stress too much. You’re doing great.”
“No Sir.”
Dean sniffles, and I can see his ears turn red, though most of his face is buried in my chest. “I’m s-sorry...I didn’t mean...I d-don’t want to lose this, I just...”
“Because you’re afraid of seeing your own submission,” he says gently, not a question. “I know. Trust me. Open your eyes.” I take a deep breath, slowly opening them and letting then travel from my bound wrists and ankles, down between my thighs, spread wide open for him. I tense for a moment, expecting the wave of panic to wash over me, but it never does, so I take a breath and look up at him. He’s grinning, unable to stop his happiness from cracking through the stoic mask. There’s a little bit of pride there, too, and I can’t help but smile back. “Do you understand now,” he murmurs, “How perfect you are? How beautiful your submission is?”
He smiles, leaning into the kiss and relaxing fully into his stance. “I know. I felt it.”
I mean to tell him that yes, I’m fine, but what comes out is “How do you think Sam feels about me?”
You guys are awesome. Enjoy!
Slowly, the tension in Cas’ shoulders eases, and he smiles. “Thank you.” He tries to sit up, but hisses as every muscle protests, falling back against Dean’s chest.
“Huh. Who knew you’d be the one to crack him,” he says.
Dean grins at him, freeing him from the chair and gently removing the small vibrator. “Come with me,” he murmurs, pulling him up on shaky legs and leading Cas over to a bench with an angle built into it. He instructs him to lie down and carefully positions him so that the high point is just under his hips, which has the effect of raising and presenting his ass. Once he’s happy he fastens Cas’ wrists and ankles to the frame, running a hand lightly down his spine as Cas tests his binds. Dean pulls one more out, fastening a leather strap above his hips to keep him held firmly to the bench. “How’s that?” he asks softly, running his fingers carefully over Cas’ skin.
At that, Cas looked up, surprised. “You want to retire?”
God considers it. “No,” he says finally, smiling. “I think you have quite enough work down here with the boys. I’ll be in touch when I need you. Oh, and Dean?”
Cas thinks about it for a moment. “You’re very close to him. Was it always like that? Was it…easy, once you found him?”
Dean shakes his head, deciding it’s better to just accept what his friend says than ask more questions now. Besides, we have more important things to ask about. “Alright Cas, try to relax and stay still,” I instruct calmly as I carefully inspect the bloody slashes in his chest. “Were these made with an Angel Blade?” Castiel nods silently. “Okay. This might sting a little, but I’ll do my best to be gentle.” I carefully soak a piece of gauze in a cleaning solution before reaching towards the angel. Just a moment before my hand comes in contact with the wound, Cas jerks away from me, a low whimper escaping him.
“No,” I murmur back. “I’m only staying up for a little while, just to make sure he doesn’t wake up again. You go ahead.”
“Well we don’t want you to be in a lot of pain.”
“We’ve got time,” Donna shrugged. “I think they have nachos.”
His leg hooks around mine, keeping me in place. “Don’t worry about it,” he grins sheepishly. He pulls me down hard against his chest, and we stay quiet for a while. I close my eyes, listening to the steady beating of his heart. After a while, I press a soft kiss over his heart, and he groans.
He sighs. “Alright, fine, I’ll try. But no promises.” He glances up. “Hey, do you think you can teach me how to make them invisible or whatever?”
I try.
Cas snorted. “I’ve been told I don’t want to know. Charlie is a good person, but...she’s more of a chaotic good, if you know what I mean.”
“Of course I’ll stay,” Dean chuckles softly. “You’re probably going to drop hard, especially since you haven’t done this before. I won’t let you deal with it alone. I was thinking more along the lines of making you comfortable.”
"Thank God, I really thought you might say no..."
“Dean?” he says softly, smiling when his eyes crack open. “I know you’re tired. I promise you can rest soon. I’m going to ask you to do something for me, and I know you’re not going to like it, but I need you to trust me.” He makes a curious sound, eyes widening when he sees the bottle in Cas’ free hand, immediately going tense. “Shh, I know, it’s okay,” Cas soothes. “Look at me for a moment.” Dean obeys, though he doesn’t relax. “Good. I know this is a lot to ask, but let me explain. We have to get some nutrients into you before your body starts to shut down. I’d like to heal you myself, but your system is still very sensitive right now, and I couldn’t heal you without causing you a great deal of pain, which would put too much stress on your body. I know you’re not a child. This is just a practicality to prevent you from choking if you fall asleep, and it’ll be easier for your body to absorb what you need in this form. It’s just for now. Once you’ve rested we can get you eating a proper meal and we never have to talk about it again if you don’t want to, I promise. Do you think you can give it a try for me?”
“Alright boys and girls,” Meg announces. “It’s time to get ready. So, who’s up for a show?”
**Quick Note** I've edited all of the previous chapters, so maybe give those a read! Not a whole lot different, but added in some things I felt were missing the first time around. Enjoy!
I shrug, resting my head against his shoulder. “It wasn’t so bad, with you. I guess I could do it a little more often.”
Sam mutters.
Dean nods, getting off the bed, still a little shakily. “Hey Cas? What was in that stuff you gave me last night?”
Benny grins. “I’d love to chief, but I’m gonna have to take a raincheck. I gotta meet a pretty girl for dinner.”
If you wanna say hi, or ask me to fill a prompt, or send me silly pictures, please come chat with me over on tumblr, where I'm thesongsmithtumbles. I hope you're all staying safe out there, and I hope that I can brighten someone's day, at least a little. I look forward to hearing from you!
“Are you here to ask me to leave?” Castiel inquired softly. “Because if you are, just tell me and I’ll go.”
Dean chuckles, pressing against him. “Well you can’t be freaking out too much if you still have a sense of humor. How’re you doing?”
“You, Sir,” he murmurs, taking an easier breath.
Slowly, Cas nods, hiding his face against Dean’s shirt and breathing his scent in deeply, letting it calm his racing heart. Dean continues murmuring softly, gently rubbing along his spine until he relaxes. “I’m s-sorry,” he stutters after a while, his breaths still hitching uncontrollably.
Sam smiles, nodding. “Yeah, Dean. I’m happy for you. Congratulations.”
is the only response, so I take a deep breath and knock softly on the door before I open it. Dean wears the same stormy expression as this morning, and it’s clear he’s been pacing back and forth for hours. He looks up sharply when the door opens, his frown deepening. “What?”
“Was that Enochian?” he asks. I nod. “What does it mean?”
“You know...this,” Dean says, gesturing vaguely between them. “This whole thing we have going here...do you just...do it for my sake?”
Dean grins, hooking his free hand under Cas’ thigh and shifting their position until his cock brushes Cas’ prostate with each stroke. Cas nearly sobs at the sensation, and it only takes two more thrusts before he cries out so loudly it shakes the room, something that might be a mix of Dean’s name and a string of curses as his body clenches and shakes, waves of pleasure making everything go white. The sight is enough to push Dean over the edge, and he cums deep inside of him, growling his name. When he manages to take a breath Dean stills, keeping them connected as he peppers soft kisses over Cas’ face and chest, stroking through his hair gently as he watches, fascinated as he slowly comes back. He murmurs softly, grinning as hazy blue eyes slowly open to look at him. “Hey baby. You okay?” he whispers. Cas just nods silently, still panting and shaking beneath him, and Dean’s palms run lightly over his skin, soothing the trembling. “Deep breaths, sweetheart. I got you. I’m so proud of you.”
He makes another happy sound, letting me set him down and pull the blankets up over us. Once I lie down, he presses close. “Love Cas,” he murmurs against my shirt.
I nods, smiling. "True. So? Shall we?"
“Mm…tired,” he mumbles. “You?”
I take a deep breath, looking back at the frightened angel. “Okay Cas, look. I know you’re scared, but you know me,” I say, trying to keep my voice calm as I creep closer, approaching him the way you’d approach a wild animal. “You know I wouldn’t hurt you, right? We’re going to go home where you’ll be safe, but I need to get those chains off so we can get out of here. Understand?” The angel swallows loudly, giving a slight nod. “Okay. So I’m gonna come over there and take them off, alright? One step at a time. Nice and easy…” He stays tense, shuddering as I reach towards the collar, starting to pick the lock. I murmur softly as I work; things that don’t make any sense but sound comforting. I manage to take the syringe out of my pocket without him noticing, and when the lock on the collar clicks open I carefully push the point into his neck, wincing at his terrified whimper as he struggles to pull away from me. “It’s okay, it’s okay,” I murmur, trying to soothe his sudden panic. “I’m sorry. We have to get you out of here. It’s alright.” Cas’ eyes widen in shock, and he stares up at me for a moment before his eyes flutter closed and he slumps forward, falling against my chest. I sigh, clearing my throat as I make quick work of the other locks, carefully picking him up, his head falling to my shoulder. “Let’s go.” We head cautiously upstairs and, by some miracle, manage to make it to the car without tipping anyone off. I toss the keys to Sam, climbing into the back with Cas and wrapping him in a blanket as we pull back onto the road. “Jesus Christ,” I murmur to myself as I take stock of his injuries.
She smiles, hugging him gently. “Me too. And of course, I’d like to get to know your boyfriend a little better, but I am glad that you’ve found someone. It’s clear that you both care about each other a great deal.”
Finally, Dean gives a tentative nod, and Cas smiles. “Thank you.” He blinks, and they’re in a different hotel room, a much nicer one that will make this easier. He gives Dean a few minutes to process the change, overwhelmed as he is. Dean’s dropped the hand holding onto him in his surprise, but Cas doesn’t release his arm. After a couple of minutes he looks up again, puzzled, and Cas doesn’t need to read his mind to understand the question. “We’re here to get you cleaned up, and fed, and rested,” he answers.
Dean whimpers, already feeling ready to burst, but he knows Cas would never hurt him; at least, not in any way he didn’t like. “Yes Castiel.”
“To congratulate you on triumphing over your gay panic?” he answers. I snarl, turning away again. “Okay, okay. That was a cheap shot. I know Sammy means a lot to you. He means a lot to me too.” Sammy smiles and flushes at that. “So I was thinking that maybe if I helped you out with something else you care about, it might smooth things over a little. Our paths crossed and now he’s downstairs for you to do what you please with. So, what do you say, Dean? Truce?”
“That’s true. We can work it out if it comes to that. Don’t worry, alright?”
Dean nodded slightly, hesitating.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean frowned a little, biting his lip. “I don’t know, Cas. You’re a good guy. I don’t want to hurt you. I haven’t exactly done much to contribute since I’ve been here.”
“Well, I mean, some of this stuff is…not so common. With people.”
“In that case, my guess is this is a good thing,” she answered. “He’s settling in here and finding his place in this family. Casual affection with no strings attached is something he doesn’t have much experience with, and has probably wanted for a long time. He wasn’t really in a position to figure that out when he was younger, so it’s not that unusual that he’s doing it now. My best guess is that he’s finally feeling safe and stable enough to explore that sort of thing. He knows he can trust you. I’ll poke around a little to make sure that there’s nothing else going on with him, but as long as you draw the line if he ever does push too far, I don’t see anything wrong with being affectionate with him. He is your kid.”
Grinning, he opens it, frowning in confusion as he picks up the soft grey rope. “I’m…confused.”
"There's only one way to find out," he points out.
the voice in his head pointed out unhelpfully.
“I bet you are,” Dean laughs. He reaches over for Cas’ hand, his thumb moving soothingly across the back of it as he drives. “Nervous?”
He shrugs. “I dunno. Probably not.”
I frown, puzzled. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
He chuckles. “Of course not. I mean, it’s for you on some level, because I want to help you. But it’s also about how sexy I think you are when you lose control a little. It’s for both of us.”
Slowly, Dean smiled. “Yeah. I…think that’d be good, actually. Just in case.”
“That’s okay,” he says quickly. “I’m just…glad you’re feeling better. Hey, listen. I might have a potential case, if you’re interested.”
Cas laughs, slipping his hand between them and rubbing his thumb over the head softly. “We’re hopeless, aren’t we?”
Bobby smiled, patting his back lightly. “‘Course, there is one condition...you have to drive ‘er out here to visit us once in a while, okay? We miss you.”
“Everything,” I manage, blinking in an attempt to see him clearly. He frowns worriedly, reaching out and pressing his fingers lightly against my forehead. It’s like fire for a moment, followed by immediate relief. “Thanks,” I murmur, letting him help me up.
“No flashbacks,” Dean confirmed, grinning. “But holy shit does it burn...”
I can’t even explain how nice that sounds, so I just nod instead. “Please. I need a break from thinking about it.”
“Karaoke,” Dean laughed, wiping at the tears that had started rolling down his face. “It’s called karaoke. And you kinda have to be drunk to enjoy it.”
When the angel pulled away, he grinned. “Have I initiated properly?” he asked.
Dean hesitated for a moment, pulling back slightly and clearing his throat. “Yeah, come in.”
When Cas wakes up, he’s surprised to find himself still in Dean’s lap, having almost convinced himself that he was a dream. Dean must have shifted them at some point, because now he rests against the headboard, and his dress shirt is gone, draped at the end of the bed, sleeping peacefully as his arms stay locked around him. Cas smiles, lightly reaching up to stroke his cheek, the movement causing Dean to stir, his eyes fluttering open. He smiles, turning his head to kiss the palm at his cheek. “Morning.” Cas smiles, but then memories of last night slowly leak into his consciousness, and a wave of embarrassment washes over him. How easily he’d accepted Dean’s control, the sudden vulnerability, his desperate pleas and whimpers…apparently he’s said these things out loud, because suddenly there’s a hand under his chin, pulling it up until he locks eyes with Dean. “It was beautiful,” Dean says firmly. “God, Cas, you were so incredible. You have nothing to be ashamed of, do you understand me? It’s okay to want those things and to let yourself have them.”
“Good,” Dean murmurs, hugging him a little tighter. “So, let me talk you through this. In a few minutes I’m going to blindfold you. Then, when you’re ready, I’m going to step outside for a minute, and when I come back we’ll get started. As per our discussion, I’m going to tell you before anything new happens, and I’m going to stay in contact with you just like this the whole time. We’re going to go slow, and you’re free to stop at any point. This is about you, so if there’s anything you don’t like all you have to do is say so and it stops. All of that sound okay?”
“Well if you’re not an ass about it I won’t have to be,” I spit back, sighing when Cas stirs, lightly rubbing his back until he settles again.
“No wonder you were so terrified,” I murmur, stroking his hair gently. “The whole time? That’s why you rushed out of the car when we got here?”
“Dean…” I whine. “Need you now…”
Dean grins. “It was the car my dad gave me. He taught me how to fix it, and we rebuilt it from the ground up together.”
, I admonish myself.
“Exactly.”
Eileen smiled, shaking her head. “I think we can handle it. Happy Birthday, Dean.”
“It’s his nightmare,” I explain. “He woke up screaming last night. He didn’t want to speak, but he looked like he wanted to tell me about it, so I suggested he draw it. Then he got mad and threw it across the room.”
Cas groaned, rubbing at his head again. “I was worried you’d say something like that...here I was hoping he’d just been...in jail or something.”
He shakes his head. “No, that’s alright. I’ll be fine. I promise.”
He sighs, hugging me tighter for a moment. “What if I told you I know exactly how she felt?” he says quietly.
I laugh, sinking down on the bed and pulling him closer, kissing him softly. “I don’t think that will be a problem.”
“No. I’ll stay right here.”
Dean shrugs. “Sam and I found this place a couple of years ago. Cas moved in for good...almost two years ago, now?”
“Love you too,” I murmur. “So much...”
He grins, reaching over to the coffee table and unwrapping another lollipop. “Yeah! When Sammy back?”
Dean nods, kissing his temple softly. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I should have been there to protect you.”
“I’ll think about it,” I say again, reaching for Cas’ hand and quickly tugging him out of the room.
The boy thinks. “They…help each other?”
Gabriel rubs at the back of his neck nervously. “Yeah, well…I kinda get it. When you live as a trickster, you get caught up in some less than pleasant situations. I know what it’s like to have memories like that.”
“I’m sure he won’t pass up celebrating anyway.”
Cas frowned a little. “Okay. About what?”
“It’s a different kind of orgasm,” he explains, his hand sliding down to cup under Cas’ ass, making him shudder again. “There’s a lot of nerve endings in this area. Yours happen to be particularly sensitive once you get going. And sometimes, if you’re relaxed and patient enough, you can bypass the first trigger and make it better. It wasn’t exactly my intention, but once I realized where you were headed I couldn’t resist. You didn’t even try to get yourself off.”
“I can’t,” Cas smiled, shrugging. “But I still know they’re there.”
Love,
“Oh. Yes. There was that. I suppose I might have gotten carried away. I hope you’re not upset. It’s just, you were so open, and I wanted to see if you’d…”
“Just that when he was on the God squad, he couldn’t control demons per se, but he somehow intimidated then into doing what he wanted. Despite that impressive ability, he seems to be considered a second-tier angel. He’s barely even mentioned anywhere.”
