“Spring is on the cold side, and not as sunny.”
“Really? You want to go with me?” Steve stood up straighter and smiled brightly.
Peter wondered what Natasha had planned. Rhodey, Carol and Tony laughed over something at Tony’s work and Peter was looking through the crowd in the restaurant. They were halfway through dinner.
Nat sent a text
Then Steve felt sad because phone books don’t really exist any more so Tony couldn’t read from the phone book. Maybe Tony could read from one of those engineering standards books he was always complaining about. It didn’t matter what Tony read as long Steve was next to Tony, listening to his lovely, deep voice as Tony let Steve run his hand through Tony’s soft hair …
“It’s not like
“That’s the one.”
He scooped up Star -- no, no, Tony -- and hustled him out of the library and up to his room. He told Ana to cancel all of his appointments that day since he felt ill. He sat reading in bed as Tony curled up against his leg.
Tony glanced behind him to see his chronicler, pencil behind ear, rushing to catch up. The small tsum blew the hair out of his startling blue eyes. At first Tony had resisted hiring a replacement when Pepper retired from the field to focus her attention on Tony’s magazine empire.
~~~~~
Eighty years later, two thousand years later, five thousand years and he’d still be paying for all those decisions.
~~~~~
King of the liars, that’s what Tony was. But he had a job to do. He was built to fix things. That’s what Steve would say to him.
Steve grrrrrrred and humphed and frowned like he found Red Skull in his cereal box.
-- I have no idea why Peter needs to take art at all.”
“Based on your circulation numbers, that might not be as rare as you think.” Cap tied the rope to his shield.
“Call me, Steve!” Sara shouted as they climbed into the cab.
“What would it take to get that off you?”
And Tony was smart, easily the smartest person Steve knew. He didn’t have to be objective at all about the person he loved. He could see Tony absorb and understand the medical information and data, even if he wasn’t a doctor.
“Especially local New York artists,” Ms. Danvers said.
“It’s not the usual super-soldier stuff.”
Natasha froze, remembering Steve. He’d been injured before, sometimes worse than now, sometimes not as bad. Why now?
Jan nudged him, “I thought you were going to say edible.”
“This expert --” Steve spat out ‘expert’ in the same tone he used for Zemo and the Yankees. “This expert said that I did this watercolor and I didn’t. He didn’t believe me.”
“That bad?” Steve replied, frowning.
“What is the Prince like? We’ve heard many stories back home,” Steve said.
“We have enough wood for the night.”
The calibration machine beeped once, twice, repeatedly. Tony groaned. “Look, I gotta to finish up here.”
“No, the hallway -- you know, people and stuff,” Peter replied incoherently. “I gotta find the phone and --”
“Great, now I have to figure out how to restart the jeep and uncover your secret identity.”
No one sat there because that was Tony’s chair. Everyone knew that as soon as they signed onto the Avengers.
All of it, silly and sweet and Steve in a nutshell.
“Stop calling him Mr. Steve. It’s just Steve,” Natasha repeated as she helped Peter take out the trash. She had come to the apartment for a physical therapy appointment for Tony and took the opportunity to fill Peter in.
“Get in, I’m the ride home today,” Rhodey replied.
What,  exactly, had happened last night? Steve ran a hand down his face. He wasn’t going to panic yet. It wasn’t like they’d been ripped off in the night or anything. He’d never heard of thieves who put rings on people.
“Girlfriend,” Carol and Jan told the nurses. Jan turned and looked expectantly at Natasha.
“How bad was it?” Tony asked.
Three days ago, Jan cornered him in his Stark Industries office where he couldn’t escape. “Look, Hank and I are trying to make this work,” she said as she handed Tony a bribe of his favorite coffee drink. “Just find someone and we can get dinner and go to a concert.”
“I’m going to ignore that you said that as I drink my pretend coffee in my pretend bed in the Savoy Hotel as I wait for my pretend breakfast to be delivered.”
A couple of nights later, Peter lay still and quiet, straining to hear whatever his dad was saying to Rhodey.
Back to welding. The armor had taken a serious beating and she didn’t have a back-up version yet since she was redesigning the repulsors.
Yet, the pillow case was covered in glitter, left on his face and body from the enthusiastic make-out session with Steve when they returned to Tower. That mean he couldn’t have just dreamed all of it. And that he didn’t imagine that Steve was a far better kisser that Steve advertised.
“Christmas is at my apartment this year,” Rhodey said.
Natasha groaned. “Look, I’m not partnering up with a 17 year old to set my friend up with anyone.”
“You and Ororo take over the evacuation. I’ll catch up to Tony and see if we can clear the building top down. I’ll send Jan your way.”
Maria said, “Let’s have a celebratory dinner -- now that we know what’s wrong, Strange will set it right soon enough. I’m sure we have a lot to talk about, Steve.”
Stevet tugged him closer, letting Tony tuck his head into his shoulder. The idea of waking up to this every single morning warmed Tony from head to toe. Something they could build a life around.
“By the way, the team voted and agreed that if you and Steve don’t do something about this mutual pining thing that you have going on, we’re locking you up somewhere,” Jan said pointedly in the car.
“He fell sick around the time I arrived. Which means -- who has the most to lose if you get married?”
“Still working with SWORD or something like that. She’s in touch for Avengers business.”
Steve laid down on his bed, his body and brain tense from all the pressures around him. He knew how to calm uneasy horses and sew buttons on shirts and how to parry a sword. But this court intrigue and living a fake life was eating away at him. Not to mention the ever present fear of being caught out.
“Mr. Rogers, I have a question about the paper,” she said. She dropped her books and bookbag on the desk, Peter followed suit and dropped his backpack next to hers.
“So this happens randomly?” Steve said, still puzzling this out. He did not have extensive experience with magic.
Natasha should never have kissed him.
The balcony curtains twitched, but there wasn’t a breeze. On high alert, Steve carefully pushed the curtains aside, fearing that he would find an assassin or something like that. Instead, Steve startled a small black tuxedo cat licking its paw. The cat froze as it locked eyes with Steve.
Tony looked at Steve, who looked at the suddenly very fascinating floor. “So none of us could be affected by anything?”
“It’s near blizzard conditions out there and we’re somewhere in a Finnish forest -- you go out there, you get lost. We never ever saw even a hint of a wood pile.”
Smiling, Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. “They saved me from planning the proposal.”
It’d been five years and Bruce wasn’t much different. A bit more grey hair, thinner, same purple shirt, grey pants. Same asshole Tony swore at and nearly laid out cold after Bruce betrayed what was left of the Avengers. Before Tony had to scramble to save what he could from the flaming ashes of his life in the race of his life.
“Thank you,” he stammered, earning a raised eyebrow from the duke.
“Okay,” Steve agreed.
“Now that we’re living together, when are you going to make me an honest man?” Steve teased.
Captain America laughed and Tony joined in. In the end, the man wasn’t half bad. Actually not bad at all. Although that last hint to his identity was going to drive Tony round the bend until he found the answer.
The mysterious Nick Fury appeared. “Prince Brock, I am here to announce that your wedding to Prince Tony has been postponed.”
Steve laughed, the last of his worry slipping away. “You’ve never said that once in your life and meant it.”
“I didn’t think you’d go to the prom with me,” Steve confessed.
He was in no position to complain. The suite of rooms -- bedroom, sitting room, dressing room, and balcony -- were spacious and beautifully furnished with the latest in fashionable furniture and fabrics. The large windows and balcony overlooked the interior gardens of the palace. Servants had already unpacked and put away what little he had, like the old wooden watercolor set placed on a table and his few books in the bookcase.
The whole opening reception thing was tedious and he couldn’t see a thing, even when Clint asked him to take empty bottles to a back office. Then the crowd began to thin. Clint said, “Closing time,” as he packed up.
“You know, sciency stuff,” Tony replied in a panic. “So, date?”
“Thanks for asking me out like you did,” Tony said. “It was very you. But you better do something for the marriage proposal.”
“What’s the deal with the film crew?”
Like really laughing and touching his dad’s arm and just looking at his dad all the time they were talking. Pepper was off to the side in a small group of people. She saw Peter and winked.
After they lost Steve.
“Always an angel to me,” Steve replied.
“Maybe,” Peter replied on his comm. “We don’t know for sure.”
Tony looked up from his phone. “How’s the war going?”
“How’s the evacuation going?” Steve asked.
“What?”
“SHIELD found an archive of HYDRA medical experiments. That’s why they called me in -- “
~~~~~~~
Steve had always been destined to be unmoored in time.
“Look, meet me at 3:30 pm Thursday at Rafe’s Cafe.”
Tony ran a hand over his face. His personal spidey-sense was shrieking a warning that something bad had gone down and that no one wanted him to know. He was not in a mood to deal with whatever the problem was so he was all for ignoring it. When Steve got here, Steve would handle it.
The cat sat back on its haunches and appeared to give Steve an appraising look. Then turned and went back to the balcony, then disappeared.
She didn’t need anything else. Or anything more.
They had lied to Steve about Malibu, calling it a backwards place with ditches for sewers. But on any given night, Steve could look out over the city filled with lights, music and happy people.
“I’ll build you your own closet. I can draw the plans up right after breakfast. I’m going to design you a closet that’s going to be on the cover of Architectural Digest.”
“I heard that you’re up with the birds,” Tony retorted. He looked down and frowned at the saddle. “I should make a cup holder for this saddle for my coffee.”
“We need to set up camp,” Tony said. “It’s too late in the day to explore more.”
Steve didn’t like Obadiah any better after breakfast. It wasn’t the barbs about Steve’s unsuitability as the Prince’s consort or that he was likely a spy for Triskelion. Obadiah was objectively correct on those points. But Steve had picked up on a subtle contempt for Howard and the royal family and an unmerited dismissiveness towards Prince Tony.
“I bought more than the cufflinks at the jeweler’s. Just waiting for the right occasion. I made reservations at L’Artusi for Valentine’s – was working on other ideas, like flowers, that sort of thing.”
The man with Mr. Steve glanced over at the bench, then when Mr. Steve was petting the dog, whipped his frisbee into the bushes. Ned exchanged a surprised look with Peter, who shrugged. The dog looked confused at both Mr. Steve and his friend. He sniffed around the ground, then made a beeline right to Peter’s frisbee.
Steve was the king of the shuffling-your-feet-back-and-forth dance but he made Tony smile. Tony didn’t care, he liked Steve’s hands on his shoulder and waist. He could be here all night with Steve in the crowd or just with the two of them.
If Tony didn’t get him moving, Rogers would stay to sketch out the carvings. Rogers was an excellent artist.
“They asked, didn’t get them.”
“You’re the one who suggested we sneak his phone,” Peter whispered.
“Go on now, go get your man,” Jan said exasperatedly.
~~~~~
“He’s an ass and full of himself.”
“I really was born on the Fourth of July,” Cap said, his voice slurred from sleep.
“She knows Mr. Steve -- he’s roommates with her boyfriend Bucky.”
“No, he’s just sick.” Tony frowned slightly.
Just before dinner, Tony padded to the end of Steve’s bed. Steve pushed himself up on his elbows to watch him shudder and twist. Suddenly there was a roiling column of smoke and he couldn’t see the little cat. The smoke cleared, and human Tony was back. Clothes and all.
At least Cap was competent at the survival game, even if he took risks Tony wished he wouldn’t. One mistake, and someone ended up dead. Tony did not want to be that someone. They needed water and warmth to get through the night. They’d face the food and transportation problem later.
“Hey, yeah, that sounds good. We haven’t been out on our own, you and me, for a while.” They’d been too busy with Avengers stuff over the past couple of weeks and Tony missed going out to lunch or dinner or anywhere with Steve alone. Natasha wasn’t bad but Clint, ugh. Clint always wanted to do
Lucky pulled the frisbee off Peter’s bag and upset Tony’s coffee mug all over Tony. Mr. Steve’s face fell when he saw who was on the bench. “Mr. Stark -- I’m sorry --”
“Are you okay, Steve?” Tony asked, a look of concern crossing his face.
Jovial to this point, Sam straightened up a bit, more guard than talkative tour guard now. “Prince Tony is the crown jewel of our kingdom.”
“Steve. We’ve been through so damn much in the past ten years, who knows what the future will bring? More than ten years ago, I had a chest plate and had to plug myself into the wall, then I had the arc reactor, now it’s just the RT. In a hundred years, you could be you and I could be a head in a jar or an AI. The point is -- I’m going to fight to be with you. I build things and who’s to say I can’t build something to be with you?”
Tony laughed pointedly at the jokes and agreed with the observances of Maria’s attendants, and he exchanged knowing looks with the armed guard stationed near them. Steve guessed that the man was the Captain Rhodes that Sam spoke highly of. Natasha was at a table off to the side, sitting near Duke Obadiah and a tall man with an eyepatch.
“Our apartment,” Carol corrected.
As the hostess showed them to a table, Tony said, “You know, I have no plans for the rest of the night.”
The rest of the afternoon and evening flew by and Tony sat next to Steve on the Avengejet landing deck watching the city lights. There might have been kissing, and handsy moments between them as they sat side by side.
If Steve hadn’t been bleeding out at the time, he would have been a fantastic kisser.
“If I can get a date --” He did not have the time or inclination to talk to Steve about who Steve should be taking to the prom.
“Has to be -- that gas is expanding and growing. Which doesn’t make sense at all. If the scrubbers aren’t cleaning it up, the gas should be dissipating.”
“Look at what I got you.” He waved a small stuffed mouse at Star, who deigned to turn her head toward Steve. Steve smiled.
As a result, Steve arrived fashionably late to the party, making heads turn and setting the crowd to twittering behind their fans and hands. He walked towards the cabana where Maria and her attendants sat. He noticed a remarkably stunning, young, brown-haired man lounging in the chair next to the queen.
The video clearly went viral because it cut off after Steve said, “I am that Steve Rogers and I know what I painted.”
“I get that too.” Natasha pulled out a few dollars from her wallet. “Coffee’s on me, kid. You got my number if you need it.”
Steve strode towards the conference rooms. “Great view,” he said when they got to the first one.
“Nothing’s wrong with him.”
~~~~~
“That’s the tour,” Sam explained.
Tony looked regretfully at Steve’s beautiful sandwiches still in their takeout wrappers on the coffee table. “So much for lunch.”
Peter deflated. He had timelines and he’d have to abandon the plan if nothing happened by February. Now Uncle Rhodey knew. “What about it?”
Jan gave her an epic eye-roll for the history books. “You need to get cleaned up, the hospital won’t let you in like that.”
“I’ve read your magazine,” Cap said nonchalantly as he tested the found rope.
“Since you’re asking, yeah, I’ll marry you.”
“You planned this,” Tony accused Steve.
Jan whispered to Ororo and Peter, “Is that what we’re calling that now? Debriefing?”
And Tony -- Tony glowed and laughed. He’d had his share of the moonshine as well -- not as much as in his dark drinking days from TImely -- but enough to be tipsy and blushing as he took his rightful place next to Steve in front of the Jesuit priest with a beaten up bible and a collection of strangers as their witnesses in the large parlor in Gass’ ranch house. Then Steve actually turned red as he recalled slivers of the wedding night activities in which he and Tony enthusiastically celebrated their new union.
Steve jumped to his feet. “Tony, something more is going on here.”
Tony never regretted outfitting a tiny room in the Avengers Tower as an art studio. He certainly didn’t regret giving the studio to Steve for Christmas. Especially when Steve showed him all the appreciation a deeply grateful boyfriend could all afternoon and through the night.
“Why don’t you go ahead -- just want to catch up with my friends, I won’t be long,” Mr. Steve said.
“Yeah, we did good.”
Tony ran his hand over Steve’s chest, tracing the swell of his pecs and nipples through the fabric. “Not many clothes?”
“Weaponized love potion,” Steve said, his voice a touch more ragged than it should be. He could tug on Tony’s tie and Tony’s body, all six feet one inch of him, would crash into Steve. His hand would land right there on Tony’s firm and bouncy ass.
“He’s in his lab working on deciphering the AIM records to see if we can identify the gas,” Ororo explained. “All he’s found so far is that AIM was working on a pheromone spray.”
He finally opened his eyes, headache be damned, and saw the plain gold ring on his left hand.
Didn’t do a damn thing.
“Sure you’ll be, big guy, after the docs patch you up.” Natasha lifted the face shield.
“We?”
Steve was led to his chambers by one of Maria’s ladies, Natasha. “Here are your rooms, near the Prince’s, as is custom,” she explained. “It’s not much -- but these have been the Prince Consort’s since the palace was renovated.”
“Sure you don’t.”
“You bet.”
Tony picked up a poker to stir up the fire and looked at the window. “Still snowing.”
“Cap didn’t punch him, if that’s what you’re asking,” Jan replied.
“Still cold.”
“Hey, I thought I’d find you here,” Hank said, slapping Tony on the shoulder.
At exactly 3:30 pm Thursday, Natasha sat down in the chair across from Peter at his table in Rafe’s Cafe. She tucked a few strands of red hair behind her ear and sipped her coffee she’d ordered. Then she got right down to business. “I got it, you need space. Well, I need Steve out of Bucky’s apartment and I owe Sam a favor. Stark wouldn’t have been my first choice though.”
Steve would lay good money that he was on the verge of a massive hangover, given how much of Goss’s moonshine he’d drunk last night. All he could remember with any certainty was the crowd egging him on as he danced a jig with Tony.
Tony felt like shit immediately. This was important to Steve, very important, he knew that. He’d heard the same deep sincerity each and every time Steve had asked him. And saw the fear in Steve’s face that Tony would say no. It never changed. Not in any of the thirty-one times Steve had asked.
Steve sat speechless.
“Pictures!” Jan said gleefully as she pushed a frozen Steve over towards Tony.
“If you can spare your old dad some time, want to join me for some Antonio’s?” Tony said, waving a delivery bag in the door frame.
“What? The uniform jacket?”
“No, nothing like that,” Steve would reply, with a heart-breaking fondness. “I meant you and me --”
“That’s not helpful!”
“I’m fine,” Cap repeated.
Dammit, the phone was ringing. Some stupid Avenger was actually calling her now. Probably Jan. Jan had no boundaries when it came to phones.
“Good guess. What else?”
He heard the voices outside the RV. Tony ran a hand through his long unruly hair and grabbed a soda.
“Ah, Prince Brock,” Maria said. She turned and glared at the man next to her. He studied Steve and shrugged slightly. Maria arched an eyebrow until the man sat up straight. “I am glad to introduce you to Prince Anthony of the ancient line of Stark. Prince Anthony, here is Prince Brock of the kingdom of Triskelion.”
Because everyone knew that Steve Rogers was too damn good a person to be interested in the likes of someone like Tony. Tony, who was not naturally a good person and had to work at being one every day of his life, unlike Steve, who just radiated goodness. Not that Tony hadn’t dreamt of being Steve’s special someone and how wonderful it would be.
Steve would be back to the mansion in no time, it was ridiculous that they even put him in ICU, knowing that he’d be out in less time than it took to fill out the paperwork.
“Yes, Captain is the first name, America is the second. Born on the Fourth of July to Betsy Ross and Paul Revere.”
It was
He strapped a gas mask over his face and headed into the isolation lab, where Bruce and Peter had put the five crates for safe keeping. Once Tony downloaded the intel gathering from the AIM labs, they were going to take a crack at figuring out what exactly was in those bottles.
And, with that thought of Tony naked on Steve’s bed and winking at him, blood rushed to one part of Steve’s body and he was very glad that he was wearing his heavy uniform pants. Because as much he was finding his fantasy of Tony very compelling and fascinating, Steve didn’t want Tony to think less of him because of how he was feeling about Tony.
Steve laughed. “No.” He’d take a deep breath and ask, “Are you free Saturday night?”
As usual, the Avengers kitchen was busy with superheroes coming and going, grabbing coffee and bagels and bananas. Tony pondered whether or not he wanted a yogurt with his bagel. It had been a very late night again in the workshop. He should be in bed, not pouring himself coffee into that extra large Iron Man mug Steve had given him. He smiled at the mug. Thoughts of Steve always brightened Tony’s day.
Finally, the gathered experts finished their study. The Stark Industries art team had rejected all the submitted pieces while Fergus’ team stated all five were done by Steve.
“Referring to London?”
The cat shook its head and yawned, revealing the white patch on its chest for which Steve called her Star. He reached out and the cat now allowed him to scritch her head. He earned some head bumps as a reward.
“That’s all that matters to me, not that you’re not a prince,” Tony said. “Dad can fix that problem.”
“My parents don’t care that you’re not Brock -- it helps us out, actually.”
“Hey, Tones, your phone’s buzzing,” Rhodey said, tossing said phone to Tony.
Tony liked that and he couldn’t help poke some more. “Is that the Army talking or you?”
“Mr. Steve has an art show in a couple of weeks. Natasha and I couldn’t figure out how to get Dad to the gallery.”
“Where were we going to live,” Steve said promptly. “Leaving you wasn’t even a single consideration for me.”
Tony was too exhausted to muster up anything more than a fist pump. He had just been asked to the prom by his secret crush and not as a friend and all he wanted to do was curl up at Steve’s feet and sleep. “You bet.” He gave Steve the best smile he could.
“Riiiighhhtttt.” She looked around and leaned towards him. “Are you trying to get Steve to ask your dad out?”
“No,” Tony said firmly. It would be yes to Sue, but no to Reed, and definitely no to Johnny. The Thing would probably thump Hank through two walls.
“You either work it out or kill each other, whatever gets us peace,” Carol said.
“It’s their gift to us,” Steve replied. “An early wedding present –”
“Or you need to hit it some more.”
“Is it me or is the wind dying down?”
“You don’t even know my name,” Cap teased.
“What’s the update, Cap?” Tony cheerfully said over the team comms.
Fury’s mood changed. He waved at the chairs at Steve’s table and Steve followed him there. “You aren’t what we’ve been told about you, Prince Brock.”
Steve nodded. Here he was trying to stay alive and now he was getting married to a man who turned into a cat. A very cute cat, but a cat nonetheless.
“Uh-huh.”
Tony should have stopped the whole thing before it ever got to this stage. Instead, he and his date (a lovely Broadway star), Steve and his date (Jan’s friend), and Jan and, ugh, Hank were all out together on a group date.
“If you want it to be one?” Steve’s words echoed in his brain.
He’d outlive them all. And what would it be like to come home to find that chair across from him empty?
Bruce and Logan had declined to come, for what were now clearly excellent reasons. Tony showed have stayed home. The thumping music threatened to cause a headache and all he could think about were the the R&D reports due soon.
“Hi, Uncle Rhodey,” Peter said.
Tony blinked hard a couple of times. He wasn’t sure he heard what Steve asked correctly. “You, me, prom dates?” Tony asked.
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and they headed right for the table. Tony leaned against the table, still scrambling to undo more of Steve’s uniform. Steve nimbly unbuckled Tony’s belt, and made short work of Tony’s fly, and reached into Tony’s pants --
The asshole and a teenage girl.
“Steve -- you could date anyone.”
One student began shaking from speaking in front of the group. “Okay, Cole, take a minute,” Mr. Steve said. “This is practice.”
Steve pointed at the red gas coming through the vent above them. The woman sighed deeply, picked up her backpack and left. One gone, more to find.
Not that she should have been impressed in the least that Steve caught and released a cricket. It was just a thing people do. Superstitions and all that. And being efficient in defeating your enemies was very much a Steve thing.
“Tony -- I --”
There was a knock at the door and Steve sighed. He had been in Malibu only a handful of days, but it felt like he had to put on a costume every time he had to be Prince Brock. This time it was harder to fake it.
Tony got into the bed, covered with dust and fall leaves that blew in. The bedding smelled terrible. “Are you getting in?”
“How about Steve?” Jan suggested. “Steve is as good as Carol.”
Tony brightened, like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He actually looked happier than the day the Timely folks had driven Fisk and his people out of town. He scrambled back on the bed and rolled over to Steve, where he belonged.
“Why do we have hardcopy newspapers?” Paper newspapers meant Steve, but Steve usually took his copy upstairs to do the puzzles in peace.
Steve spent the better part of the day with Tony until Tony was called away for royal duties. “I’d rather stay here,” he admitted.
“That’s odd.”
“Natasha’s off the grid. And do you really want Clint and Hank together?” He arched an eyebrow. Clint and Hank would feed off each other’s chaos energy. Hank was a lot
“Mom -- whose opinion is the only one that matters -- Fury, Natasha, Rhodey, Sam, and Jarvis -- his opinion matters right after Mom’s. Lots of people -- you’re nice to everyone, even to the stray cat who visited you.”
,” Loki said.
Unexpectedly, Tony decided to come along with Steve and Sam on their daily morning ride. Steve was glad to see him, even if Tony wasn’t particularly talkative. Sam led them through the carriage paths in the large park adjourning the palace.
“I do not know Tony well, but he does deserve to have some consideration and companionship in his match. A good match can do well for both parties.”
All the bits and bobs Steve left behind. A sea shell from Hawaii.  A charcoal drawing of Tony in the armor, unused tickets to a car show. A flattened penny, a key, a broken Rolex watch. The dog tags Steve had slipped over Tony’s head. A picture of Steve shirtless in bed, an arm thrown over his eyes, a smile on his lips, a glimpse of the ocean through the window.
He got so frustrated that he threw himself into traffic just to try to do something different, maybe his death or serious injury would shake up the time loop.
Nat — as she had asked to be called — explained to him how the call system for servants worked. “There will be a State Dinner tomorrow night -- nothing formal tonight since her majesty thought that you would prefer the rest.”
“It’s just a quick thing,” Tony explained. She glowered at him.
He briefly hoped that Maria would assign Nat to look after him. She had been friendly enough in a sea of strange new things. Then again, Steve had a nagging feeling that Nat was not one of Maria’s women as she had said. Steve had a strong sense of how things worked in palaces, and he’d picked up on little things that Nat didn’t quite do or say that she would have if she were indeed a lady in waiting.
They whisked Natasha up to the ICU, like they were Natasha’s squad or something. Damn, this felt like high school all over again.
Peter ran a hand down his face and nearly groaned from the embarrassment now and in the future.
First, Alexander thought little of the Kingdom of Malibu, and even less of the ruling royal family, considering Malibu to be an inconvenience on his way to conquering the world. He had laughed derisively when he received the offer of Prince Tony’s hand as a way of formulating an alliance between Malibu and Triskelion. Clearly King Howard was an idiot if he had not figured out that his kingdom was in imminent danger.
Natasha sighed. She wasn’t avoiding anyone.
“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve asked.
The thought of wearing Steve’s ring took Tony’s breath away. Steve had always wanted to be married, though Tony had a healthy fear of marriage, considering his parents and the strong likelihood he’d wake up and find that he’d married sentient armor or a Skrull. It could happen – he’d lay good money that it would. Tony’s luck ran on the rotten side.
“The team and reserve Avengers thought we’ve been living together for the past year. I was informed of this fact this morning.”
Steve sat down and nudged Tony’s shoulder. “Having a good time?”
Tony flopped down into his chair, throwing his legs over one of the arms. He waved his hand in the air. “You know, our thing. Check-in before dinner.” Tony checked his phone. “No, wait, I’m early. You’re never here this early in the afternoon. Finally break the danger room?”
“Depends on who engineered it,” Steve responded. “If Howard wishes to be cautious, then that is understandable. But if this is Duke Obadiah --”
“Cap is fine.”
Through a pure miracle, Tony had located the cabin and if it didn’t turn out to be a mirage, then he’d be forced to wait out the storm with his least favorite person in the world.
“Huh, that does sound like an improvement,” Rhodey said.
Clint Barton owned a dog. Peter had never met Clint or knew that Clint existed. Natasha didn’t explain. But Peter picked up that Clint asked a Sam Wilson to dogsit when he was on vacation. If Sam was watching the dog, then Mr. Steve was taking care of the dog too.
Peter couldn’t follow any of it. Except that he pieced together that Tony had said something very, very mean to Mr. Steve on their date and Mr. Steve hadn’t reacted at all nicely to what was said. Peter was very, very confused.
But there was another large building with a smoking chimney and large wooden door close by the Captain of the Guard ’s house. The building appeared much like other manufacturing trades buildings, though there was a deck stretching between the second floors of the building and the Captain’s house, with what appeared to be a table and an umbrella, and a lattice against the building’s wall.
He glanced down at the coding on his computer. Fine. If Bruce had dug deep enough to uncover Tony’s hidey hole, maybe there was a reason. Had to be a fantastic one, a universe saving one. He shut the cover of the laptop.
Tony suddenly began to twitch and shudder. One of his arms flailed and his body began to stretch like he was being pulled apart as Steve watched in horrified alarm.
“That’s how royal marriages work --”
“Already there, Cap!” Peter said.
“This doesn’t say anything decisive. Some SHIELD scientist reads something from the 40s and finds Steve Rogers is involved doesn’t lead to you being immortal.” Tony shuffled the papers together and put them on the floor. “It’s a bunch of data.”
As he put fresh clothes on, suddenly filled with energy and feeling brand-new to his core, Tony headed off with a new spring in his step to find Steve to start their rest of their lives.
The final conference room had a spectacular view of the New York skyline. Steve had some sudden intriguing thoughts about Tony and that large conference table. Love potion, love potion, right. This is not real.
“What?” Peter asked, feigning innocence. He clutched his kitchen sponge tighter in his hand, squeezing out sudsy water that trickled down his arm.
Carol went up a notch in Tony’s estimation. Her email about the SWORD assignment came in two days ago. The timing couldn’t have been coincidental. Plus, he hadn’t been Jan’s first choice, which was somewhat comforting. Tony had always been more Jan’s friend. “How about Thor and Jane?”
“It’ll look good in your report to your Captain -- that the Prince Consort showed interest.”
But Cap smiled at him, a warm, inviting smile that was completely human, not Special Ops super soldier, making Tony’s hardened black heart flutter a bit. “You know my birthday, possibly where I came from. I’ll give you another hint.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I picked it up by accident when we were talking about a paper. I was going to bring it back tomorrow.”
The Fantastic Four were in the Negative Zone, as they always were during a crisis. Doctor Strange was on vacation of all things. The Spider kid was not going to be helpful in this, at all.
Jan had timed their arrival for the maximum impact. She and Thor swept into the ballroom looking like they had just come from a royal event in Asgard. Loki and Brian drew all the attention as they tore up the dance floor. Steve didn’t step on Tony’s feet.
“If it’s snowing, then it’s going to be warmer than if we had cloudless skies.”
“Hank is a good person. I wish people would just give him a chance. Reed and Sue? Johnny and that model who’s been in the paper -- Shauna or Amber, what is her name ...”
“Anytime,” Steve replied.
Steve was punching the hell out of his third bag that day. He looked startled as Tony appeared covered in spilt coffee, sweat running down his face, opening and closing his mouth like a guppy.
Steve’s pieces were arranged, unlabeled, on easels and on the large conference room table. Reproduction pieces from his pre-war years to the large pen-and-ink drawing he made to hang in their bedroom when Steve moved in with Tony.
'Yes,' Steve smiles. 'He has a meeting; he'll be back later.'
He gives up for a moment to try and think this through.
‘Oh, that. No. It’s fine, I told you, I just had it cleaned up on the jet.’
'Not with you.'
'I'm not going to!' Tony reassures him. 'That's why I had to get him to leave when I did.'
'That's right,' Pepper agrees, 'like your Dada.'
'That's true,' Tony agrees with a sudden grin, 'I'll stay with you, and the three kids and Pepper can live up here!'
'You told me they'd stopped,' his friend scowls. 'Pepper and I were only ok with you moving back to New York because you said...'
'What then?'
*                                  *                                  *
'I want a Lamborghini,' Pete decides, 'and a little helicopter.'
'Ok,' Pete holds up his arms expectantly and isn't disappointed. The plastic zoo animals have all miraculously ended up back in their box so Tony picks that up too as they leave.
‘I really like you, Tony,’ Steve interrupts.
But nobody told him. This wasn't just Tony.
'I'm feeling taken advantage of.'
Steve rather wishes Hulk was that ready to follow his orders.
'Tony,' she scolds.
Steve drops his gazes to where he's linked his fingers in front of him on the table,
'Ok,' he takes a breath as he turns to face Tony on the couch. 'Will he know I'm his father?'
Nobody says anything though and Steve rubs Tony's fingers with his thumb.
'I'm sorry you didn't find out sooner,' Bruce adds. 'It wasn't right.'
'Ok...' Tony gives him an accessing look and then shrugs. 'Well, I'm here now.'
'You explored,' he corrects with a smile. 'Was that with your bike?'
'I'll call the Head Office,' the man gets out his phone.
'I can assist you, should you require it,' Jarvis adds.
'Tony?'
'Maybe if I shield the reactor enough then I'll neutralise its affects.'
Sorry for the wait! These chapters were hard.
'You know about that?' Tony fakes surprise.
'For what?' Steve pulls back to smile at him.
'If I was polite Reed would never believe it was me.'
'Hello again, Master Peter,' the butler smiles. 'Can I help you, Captain Rogers?'
'He has rights to Hawkeye and Blackwidow but of course I have rights to Iron Man and Bruce made sure I had copyright on Hulk... I got the rights for Thor too but I make sure I funnel the money from there to Foster.'
'Much better,' he agrees.
'Course you're my favourite,' Pete gazes up at him.
Tony comes awake to a buzzing in the back of his skull,
Right, Steve should have thought of that.
'And you don't think you learnt anything from that experience that could make you better at this?'
'Dada, where did Cap go?'
He ushers him onto the lift after grabbing his blanket and then leads the way into the communal lounge.
‘You were unmarried at the time of my creation,’ the AI agrees.
Steve ducks his head behind his shield as Hulk roars and charges them.
Steve retreats down to the communal area to wait for the others to return and frets over what Pepper has told Tony. He knows they aren’t together anymore, and haven’t been for a while now, and he knows Tony didn’t seem to be upset about it at the time, but this Tony…
‘I’m sorry?’ Tony just sounds surprised. ‘I didn’t
Steve is barely getting over the size of the suite he'll be staying in when he hears a knock at the door.
'Why is she Widow, but I'm Tony?'
'Yeah!' Pete grins, 'and I only crashed five times!'
'How long was I downstairs then?' he asks and presses a kiss to Steve's neck.
‘There is that,’ Tony agrees straightening up and looking up to where the fight is finally calming down. Even as they say it Hulk is swinging down from the roof making a beeline for Tony.
Back in the main room he finds Jarvis is reading a story to Pete off of his tablet. He sits beside his son and brings up his home interface on the coffee table.
There's shouting and he never knows what it is he does wrong.
So Tony must have completely misunderstood Steve’s feelings for him.
'It'll be alright, Tones,' Rhodes tells him quietly. 'I'll take your stuff to the Mansion; see you there.'
Tony has consented to staying in his medical room but only if certain conditions are met, though he doesn’t word it quite like that.
‘I thought you were going to die, Tony! For a minute I thought you were dead.’
Steve settles himself to lean against a workbench as he looks over at his partner. Tony keeps his gaze for a few moments then glances away as he keeps adjusting something in the car.
Of course the other thing that Steve worries about is the computer that seems to be monitoring his entire existence.
'If you think I'm going to stop talking about this just because...'
The sex was probably nothing special; he can't remember.
and Steve's ok with that?
'I can't help cook,' Tony tries again, 'but I can give presents.'
‘Sir,’ Jarvis interrupts, ‘you did not get around to calling the Captain down.’
'Would it still flip?' Pete has his priorities straight.
'There's got to be rules about not hitting someone who's just fed you, right?'
‘I’ve patched up worse,’ he says, as if that’s meant to be comforting rather than horrifying. ‘Let’s face it; I basically perform heart surgery on myself every few months.’
'How is he, Jarvis?' she asks quietly.
'Of course!' Steve may have been a little eager with that response. 'I could take him to the assault course a few floors down? It's basically a jungle gym...'
'I never met him,' Steve adds mildly.
'Yep, surgery's next week.'
'And will you be coming to your Dad's party?' her eyes glow with the victory fire of having an exclusive.
'Yeah,' he spins the chair again. 'So maybe I just need to get out of here?'
'Right,' Tony repeats quietly before thrusting the box out to him, 'here.'
‘Hey, Big Guy,’ Tony flips back the visor and smiles as Steve viciously quells the urge to back away or raise his shield.
Steve just hopes things go well when Tony comes looking for his son.
Tony's brain is still trying to reboot from the use of the word
'Of Stark Industries?' Tony shrugs. 'Or Earth, I guess.'
'I am sorry, friend Clint, but this carting is most enjoyable!'
It's a few hours before Steve rides through the Mansion gates on his new bike. He has his duffle strapped down behind him and his shield on his back.
'What's on offer?' Tony gulps the last of the coffee straight from the jug.
Of course now he can settle down and feel bad about skipping out on making breakfast this morning.
Why does everyone have to think so slowly?
The only person Tony doesn’t react any differently around is Pepper. Which, as to Tony they’ve only just broken up, is a little devastating.
Now he looks he can see the tiny, nearly imperceivable, holes covering nearly half the ceiling.
Just as they rescue Clint and are celebrating their victory Jarvis tells them he has a message,
On the screen Tony's sprawled on the seat of the jet, his sunglasses are on, he's holding what looks like a martini and he's gazing at his tablet. As Steve watches the genius seems to tense and scowl at the tablet, but only very subtlety, before his gazes shifts towards the camera.
'They're a little dramatically unsubtle for a couple of spies and a man who's been on the run for so many years,' Tony tells him with a grin.
'Alright,' Tony nods, 'but you personally; do you think it's right to tell Steve now?'
Steve laughs and looks away.
Great…
‘Tony! Tony? Stark!’ Steve shouts then huffs a sigh. ‘Yeah, alright, I’ll see you later…’
‘I was just looking around the place,’ he gestures around the living room that is the first of the four rooms in his suite; the other three being a bedroom and bathroom to the right and a study to the left.
Steve smiles and quietly exits the room, leaving the door ajar.
'I'm just going to play with Pete until Rhodey gets here,' Tony rallies enough to throw up his media smile. 'You can go polish your shield or whatever.'
'Exposure could be a factor,' Jarvis continues, 'in which case I suggest on your next loop you should stay out of the workshop. Perhaps for several loops if the situation is not corrected immediately.'
'I couldn't even make things work with Pepper.'
'Tell me what to do?' Steve asks quietly and then presses suckling kisses up and down his length.
'Your Dada is working,' Steve rubs his back. 'Time for a nap, Pete.'
'You were of far more help than some,' Steve doesn't question the censor in Jarvis' tone.
Actually it was Steve Rogers.
been described as a Superhero,' he winks at her.
'Turn. The. Helmet.'
Pete settles himself on the floor a selection of his plastic animals, some cars and lots of paper and pencils. That he's hugging his blanky as he draws and his sword is on the floor beside him rather completes the picture.
*          *          *
'Dada?' oh, great, Pete just watched him completely lose his mind.
'Can I have a car?'
'A car.'
'Many people think she's still just your secretary.'
‘Fuck,’ Tony adds.
'So they did,' Tony agrees.
She smiles. Tony debates complaining that she wasn't this nice when she met him.
'It should do,' he wraps an arm around her without looking away from the view.
'We need to talk, Tony,' Steve hunches his shoulders a little as he shoves his hands into his pant pockets.
He can't help his grin as he follows them.
'I'd love to babysit if you're ok with that.'
'I'm going to make you feel amazing.'
'Umm, I'm sorry?'
'Make it breakfast for three and you're on,' his expression is teasing but Steve thinks the invite is genuine.
'Sir would undoubtedly agree with you,' Jarvis sounds amused. 'Perhaps you would like to go to the other room where you can play with the toy cars Agent Barton has brought down from the penthouse?'
Tony is quiet.
'The numbers exceeded everyone's expectations, except sir's and my own, of course.'
'He's three,' he smiles and steps close enough to tug Tony into an odd one armed hug.
'Voice mail,' he reports. 'Jarvis? Jarvis, it's Steve. Jarvis, we need to talk to Tony. It's really very important...'
'Tony...'
There are two loud clunks behind him as Tony drops his gauntlets and then a third when Tony manages to get a hand to the helmet. Tony wipes his thumbs across Steve's cheeks and pulls him into a life-reaffirming kiss.
When Tony wakes, still in the armour because Jarvis is protective like that, he stares at them all with wide eyes.
‘Tony?’ he calls across the music when Jarvis lets him into the workshop.
‘What?’ Steve blurts even as Pepper tells him what a wonderful idea that is.
'K...'
The HUD lights up with messages as he takes in the shelves of his tech. He ignores it as he continues to the front part of the store and to something infinitely more valuable.
'Nearly,' Tony nods, 'need your help though, squirt, put your finger there to hold the wires back for me?'
'Take a break,' Steve tells him. 'Come downstairs for an hour or so and try not to think about it.'
'Pete,' he smiles at his son beside him, 'get your sword, ok? You're going to play with Thor and Clint while I go to work with Auntie Pepper.'
Because I love Dummy.
*          *          *
‘I don’t remember.’
'My presence in the Mansion is limited, sir,' Jarvis replies. 'You have never been on site long enough to require full integration.'
‘Because he talks?’
‘Jarvis,’ Tony’s voice from the doorway makes Steve jolt violently to his feet, ‘did the good Captain just graduate from Mr. Rogers to Captain to sir all in one conversation?’
'Sir,' Jarvis interrupts Rhodey's nth version of
'Your father is a good and honourable man,' Thor tells him, ‘he would never willingly leave you.’
The first slice of apple disappears before Pete has even swallowed his entire mouthful of sandwich.
Clint just grins up at her and then stares as Pete slips down onto the floor and builds himself a small car.
'I told him,' he blurts.
‘I hate it here.’
'You're too kind, sir,' if Jarvis had eyes he'd clearly be rolling them. Tony just laughs.
He spots a sandwich on the table and lifts one corner of the bread to investigate,
'Captain Rogers, sir.'
'Pete,' he sighs in relief. The suit opens and he steps out to drop to one knee and scoop his boy to his chest. 'You scared me, baby boy.'
'Yeah?' Tony smiles at his son and shoots a glance at Steve. 'What did you paint for me?'
'I know a lot of people who would give their right arms for a
Tony slams whatever he’s holding down onto the workbench,
'After coffee.'
'The suite beside yours is being prepared,' Jarvis confirms.
'If that's alright with Jarvis,' he agrees as he reclaims his tablet.
'Sure,' Clint grins.
'It's going to be a long day isn't it, buddy?'
It’s brilliant because, well, more company.
They're much too long.
The man hesitates for a moment and then grabs a bag from behind the register before disappearing out of the door.
'That's Jarvis,' Tony nods. 'He's leaking Jim's existence.'
'Jarvis?' he steps into the shower stall.
Tony slumps against him and rests his head under his chin so Steve wraps both arms around him and Pete.
He masterfully ignores Steve standing below him for over half an hour before Steve finally speaks,
'I'm sure Jarvis can help us if we get lost,' he smiles down to where Pete is practically bouncing as he tugs on his hand.
Steve's expression has flickered from arousal to disappointment and from embarrassed to reluctant acceptance very quickly,
And Tony looking that gorgeous with that smile on his face doesn’t hurt either.
'I love you,' Tony can hear the smile in Steve's voice.
He's such a fool; he thought they were friends.
'You know I do,' Tony finally meets his gaze and steps closer so their chests are nearly touching.
Tony sighs,
'For the data from the other arc reactor prototype?' Pepper puts down her tablet. 'The numbers were that good?'
'Not Stark's?' Fury asks and flicks a look at Natasha.
'Nap time, buddy,' Tony says quietly and scoops his son off of his stool.
They wind up taking it to pieces.
'Sure, but he's not generally big and green at the time.'
'You heard that?' he smirks.
Steve whimpers and clutches his fingers into Tony's arse.
'I do not believe Captain Rogers will hit you, sir.'
He can't help grinning back; he's missed this boy,
'It's not my fault that I don't trust you,' he replies quietly and walks the remaining distance to the lift.
'That's fair,' Tony grants him.
'I'm fine,' he retorts. 'Glad you like it. Them. The presents.'
'Language,' Steve scolds, quite automatically, with a glance to the boy in his arms.
'Oh,' Tony turns back to face his friend. 'They managed to create a child from me and Cap?'
'To escape what?'
'Tony, I know he's Bruce, but he's not stable when he's like this. Please come away?'
The door opens further to reveal Pete wearing a Captain America costume, with a shield, as he runs to his father,
*          *          *
Tony scowls and all Steve can think to do is blurt the same thing that seemed to help before,
‘This isn’t medicine. This is technology and I’m already up to speed working on it; I’m not going to stop now to explain it to anyone.’
'You had time to change?' Steve blurts pointlessly.
'We have been working on a way for Jarvis to track me, and the other guy, in the event of my capture,' Bruce replies calmly, as if this is a common concern. 'Also the other guy tends to head off into the wilderness if he's upset and I wake up completely lost. If Jarvis and Tony can track me then they can come and find me.'
'Not actually you though,' Tony tells him. 'You won't remember.'
Steve looks up and smiles,
'What's he done?' Rhodey sighs but Pepper can see he's worried.
'I kiss you properly as I shift my hand to press against your head. You're grasping at me. One hand on my head now we're kissing and one on the arm I'm touching you with. I think you're leaking now. You're that close.'
'I made three sandwiches,' Tony pouts as he puts the plates on the bar and hops onto the seat beside Steve and opposite his son. 'With three ingredients.'
'Let's build it one,' Clint agrees and they set to work.
'Did you tidy up?'
What?
‘There have been more important things happen to you since you became CEO again that just what you’ve made!’ Steve objects. ‘That can’t be all you think your life is.’
‘If we get called out you shouldn’t be coming with your shoulder like that,’ Steve steps up to the workbench and gazing at the complex holographic schematics.
'If he sleeps with Steve without telling him about Jim then their personal and professional relationships will be irretrievable,' Pepper concludes.
Steve takes several hurried steps away from the painting,
Pepper puts a hand on his arm and squeezes before closing the door between them.
'Cap is coming too?'
‘About my nightmares or about you freaking out over being attracted to me?’
'I had the day as I expected it,' he tells her, 'then I've had it twice more and now today.'
'Please...' he whispers.
'How far do we need to be?'
'As an icebreaker then,' Tony waves a hand. 'Hey, good morning Cap, there's something I need to tell you. Please eat a muffin.'
‘Hey, Jarvis,’ Tony sheds his jacket, tie and sunglasses somehow without looking away from whatever he’s working on. ‘Good call on the ice,’ he pours himself a scotch.
‘Jarvis!’ he sounds desperate.
Rhodey just hugs him.
Dummy has rolled over slowly and peers over Tony's shoulder where he's kneeling down. Pete gazes at the bot and then offers him the plastic elephant.
Pepper will be so proud...
He pops the trunk so Jarvis can reform the suit and then goes to the back door to retrieve his son.
'I'm going to be a father,' he tries to let that sink in.
'It's meant to,' Pete tells him. 'It flips, see?' The car drives into the sofa and flips itself over to move off again in the opposite direction.
Tony shrugs,
He'll get out from between the two Starks and sleep in the other room.
'I'm not your mother,' he groans.
'She isn't coming,' Tony smiles, 'you won't see her again.'
Steve starts bobbing his head; his eyes are still closed.
'I came as soon as I heard your most joyous of news!' the clap to his shoulder is only enough to rock him rather than push him off the tower so Thor is trying. 'Truly! The arrival of a healthy heir must always be celebrated!'
'Agent Coulson is dead, Tony,' Steve reminds his partner.
'I'm a genius,' he tells Steve.
'Anything to add?'
He had been on top of a roof fighting and Tony had been zipping around blasting as the enemy of the day climbed up the walls to try to overwhelm those fighting at the top. As he hit one of the many that had made it onto the roof with him another activated the device they had brought with them.
'You have ceiling turrets?'
Hope you like it, cheers for sticking with me :-)
'Steve, is everything ok?'
He shoots a worried look at Bruce, but just receives a knowing smile in reply.
'Jarvis, where’s Tony?’
'He'll sleep in my room until my second guest room is converted,' Tony misses the point. 'That should be finished in a couple of days.'
‘I know,’ Steve meets his gaze. ‘I just need to get my head on straight.’
He needs a shower.
'Oh,' he manages to choke out.
'Good luck,' Steve retorts and Tony scoffs at him.
'Right,' he agrees, confused, as he stands as well and is shown to the door. He falters and turns back to Pepper when he reaches the hallway, 'I'm in love with him, Pepper.'
'I'm going to make you come just from this,' he tells the blonde in a low tone and adds another finger.
'She's dead,' he drinks some of his coffee, 'what I do with her name is up to me.'
'Was there something wrong with the last one I made him? That would explain why I'm working for him again so soon.'
'It will be good to see you again; Tony's missed you.'
'Stark has it,' Natasha tells him.
'There's a third guest room,' Tony tells him. 'Jim can have that. After that I'd have to convert the workshop downstairs into living quarters so I guess that'll be it for the Stark line.'
'What did you play with then?' Steve challenges.
Steve plays with Pete as Tony keeps working above them. Pete insists on swapping rooms each time Tony does but Tony barely seems to notice.
'Yes, Jay?' he's half out of his seat.
'I lied through my teeth for much of it,' he shrugs, 'but sure, she bought it.'
He'd also like to spend time with Pete, which also seems like something Tony will allow.
There's a pause where Pepper looks sad and angry at the same time.
‘Just about long enough if we keep to this velocity,’ Tony glances up at the navigation screen. ‘So don’t get lost.’
'Right,' Clint puts the milk out beside the ketchup, 'always best to listen to your Dada's omniscient butler.'
It’s not that he thinks Tony will have a problem with Steve being attracted to him. Or rather he’s sure that having a man be attracted to him won’t faze Tony; he’s accidently seen more than one clip of Tony with a man on the internet.
'Go on, admit it, I'm brilliant,' Tony instructs.
Tony gives him a confused and calculating look as he rubs at the reactor under his t-shirt.
'His name is Peter Jarvis Stark, he's three and a half and he's the best drain on my resources that I've ever created.'
Steve waits but Tony doesn't elaborate.
Later, after they've eaten, Tony returns to his workshop with Rhodey and his son. He puts Pete down to nap and walks back over to where his friend is waiting.
'Umm.'
Steve frames Tony’s face with his hands and pulls him close,
'Cap?' Pete is suddenly climbing over him and dropping down between him and Tony. 'Cap! Dada is back!'
'Jay, he's Captain America. He is the actual Captain America.'
Tony just shrugs at him,
'Pete can hang out with me while you're busy,' Steve finally smiles again.
'Good,' he nods encouragingly.
'I don't understand.'
'As you say.'
'I'm calling my number...' he navigates Clint's phone contacts to find 'Rogers, Steve'.
'Steve is going to think you're trying to buy his forgiveness if you don't talk to him.'
Tony considers him with no small amount of confusion,
Steve blinks himself awake to find himself still in the workshop. There's a ragged blanket draped over him and he smiles before remembering the events of the previous day.
'Sorry for the interruption but he needs to look like Doctor Anthony E Stark, expert in electrical engineering, not Tony the privileged lazy rich boy. His charm can only take him so far,' she smiles.
*                                  *                                  *
'Did he at least worry over whether or not to tell me?'
That's... weird.
‘That could be days!’ Steve objects.
Tony doesn't anymore.
They step on to the lift which immediately moves to the level for Tony's workshop. The doors open and Dummy is waiting on the other side.
'You interrupted
'Thanks, buddy,' he walks over to the window. He swipes away the alerts that appear on the glass and rests his head against it as he stares out across the city.
He groans,
'I didn't think so,' Tony glares at the generator some more. 'Fine, we'll monitor it really fucking closely for now and strangle Reed when he comes for it tomorrow. Makes sure all the barriers you can put up are up; I don't want this happening again.'
'He can talk, can't you buddy?' Tony looks at the boy who nods and then glances around.
'Good afternoon, sir,' Jarvis has long given up speaking to Tony before there's proof of the genius' consciousness. 'You passed out on your desk a little over seven hours ago.'
He holds out his hand wordlessly,
'He's Captain America,' Pete lifts his head and looks between them.
He flinches at the sound of his surname,
'You want me to pretend I'm not one of your favourite people?' the PR smile is back. 'I'm Tony Fucking Stark; I'm everyone's favourite.'
It feels like some sort of bizarre privilege to watch interactions between these two.
He nods his head and sits up at the table. The sandwich is two rectangles, not two triangles like Dada does it, but it tastes good. Clint and Thor are talking but he doesn't listen to them because he has to concentrate on his food. He licks his fingers clean of egg before drinking his milk.
'Captain,' Fury smiles, 'I know I have the advantage of having seen him before, but look at the boy. Who does he remind you of?'
Tony accepts things from his bots.
'Yeah,' Steve scoots forwards a little in his seat, 'but you know me now and you still... I'm honoured, Tony.'
'Ms Potts would likely instruct you to speak with him, sir. Shall I call her?'
'You like me,' Pete smiles.
'Why would you say he was yours?'
'Now, sir?' Jarvis queries.
'Ok,' he agrees with Thor because Clint is silly.
'I do not know if the artist was a fan of himself,' Jarvis responds blandly, 'but he certainly has a recognisable style.'
Tony pets his son's hair and tries to make his brain wake up enough to say something comforting.
'Are you angry with Cap, Dada?'
'Your Dada bought you a lot of paints,' Steve starts unpacking the blue storage box that Tony carried down with them earlier.
There’s naturally some fall out from them disappearing from the helicarrier and not telling anyone what was going on.
'Right, ok. Jarvis, run those names past Rhodey.'
Steve makes scrambled eggs on toast for breakfast and a full jug of coffee.
Clint and Natasha move in a week later; both apparently exhausted from a mission and needing somewhere to relax.
*          *          *
'It's not exactly perfect for either of us,' he tries, 'but I thought we were friends, Tony. If we're nothing else we're teammates; we're Avengers,' he pauses as he gages Tony's response, 'I just want you to believe that I want to be involved.'
'So waffles will be your,' Tony grins, 'second breakfast?'
Steve sleeps better than he can ever remember doing before.
Tony freezes for a split second and then he’s all motion as he moves across the room fiddling with things,
He had been forbidden to go anywhere near where Howard worked and, if he ever dared to, he soon regretted it when he was sent away to Maria.
‘Great,’ Steve smiles before letting Tony get back to work.
Steve has his breathing under control so he pulls out his phone and calls Clint,
He would really rather have a little more time before seeing Tony again.
'Does Cap have a car?'
It would be better if Dada was here. It isn't fair that Dada has to work.
'Say hi, Pete,' Tony presses a kiss to his son's hair.
'Huh,' Tony rolls his shoulders. 'I really thought...'
He runs for hours.
This results in another period of silence.
Another deep breath.
'Except Jarvis,' Tony tries. 'Jarvis can make me coffee.'
'We talked about this,' he checks his hair in the mirror. 'I'll go in first and call you if it's safe, ok?'
Tony waits for his eyes to adjust and then keeps watching his son,
‘What can I say? I needed a hug,’ he smirks; his expression daring Steve to comment that that is exactly what he wanted.
'Tony?'
All he can see is that last smile on Tony's face.
'No! It wasn't his fault; he told Pete not to open the cabinet under the bar and I freaked out,' Tony snaps. 'Can we drop it now?'
Steve nods,
'Sir, your food delivery has arrived in the foyer,' Jarvis announces.
'I want Dada,' he replies and gets tugged into a hug against Clint's side.
'I released a swarm of nanites into my bloodstream to heal the wound left by the reactor,' Tony tells him calmly. 'Teeny tiny robots, Cap. They can communicate with each other so that they can work efficiently,  which is great, but now they've latched onto my brain and it would seem I'm now able to... Recieve digital communications directly into my brain.'
'Pep...'
Thor laughs loudly,
'So these last few days with Pete...' Steve waves a hand vaguely, 'that was some sort of interview? To check if I'm good enough to be near your...
'Yes, sir,' Jarvis agrees. 'Will Peter require a meal?'
'Sir is on his jet having a video conference with his Board of Directors. Would you like me to bring up the feed?'
Tony only thought he wouldn't want to be involved; he never wanted to exclude him.
The genius sways in place for a moment and almost looks like he'll manage to focus on Steve but then he shifts the covers just enough before collapsing face first onto the bed to Steve's left.
'I meant who knew before me,' Steve interrupts. 'You said 'we', so, who know before me?'
'I suspect Captain Rogers believes the fault to be with himself, rather than with you.'
'I'm just going to... go...' Steve gestures to the lift.
Sometimes Steve worries that the ice did a number on his brain.
'Hey,' he can feel Steve's voice vibrating his nose.
‘Hey, Cap,’ Tony’s eyes are barely open but his expression softens somehow as Steve approaches.
'Come on, Pete,' his son is lifted onto Steve's hip as he stands. 'Let's get you dressed and leave your Dada to caffeinate.'
'No! That's not...'
This gets Tony’s attention.
'That doesn't seem...' Steve starts to object but Tony kisses him until he subsides.
'Steve, have you ever tried touching yourself... back there?'
A quarter of an hour later the three of them reach the Quinjet. Steve beelines for the monitor so he can check on Tony while Clint and Natasha stand on the ramp watching for anyone who may have followed them. Steve pulls up what should be the video feed from Tony's helmet but all he can see is a rock and the feed is sideways.
'Just checking in,' Natasha huffs a breath. 'Clint told me what happened.'
'Oh,' Pete smiles at him.
He's never quite sure how to take Steve's random compliments.
'Oh,' Steve replies quietly.
He's gotten used to being under constant surveillance, and at least with Jarvis he can be pretty sure the AI doesn't pay active attention when he isn't dressed unlike when he was still living under SHIELD's radar.
'See you there, Cap.'
'Here, meet your nephew,' Tony grins and waves to Pete. 'Pete, meet uncle Rhodey.'
Tony rubs his eyes and sighs.
'The more important it is the less likely Stark is to share.'
'I was delirious,' Tony tells him.
'So you want the Iron Man plushie?' he can't help the amusement he feels watching Tony's boy choosing between the range of Avengers plushies.
'A blanky?' Tony cocks his head. 'I didn't think of that.'
‘I don’t know why,’ Bruce looks up from his work and over his glasses at Steve. ‘But if it makes him more comfortable then it’s the least I can do as he trusts me more than nearly everyone else on this planet.’
'This is Avenger tech,' he scowls at it. 'We shouldn't be on these channels outside of missions.'
‘You should be resting too,’ Steve reminds him.
'Yeah,' he looks straight into Steve's eyes. 'Let him in.'
'I'm sorry.'
'I can't have a fifteen million dollar painting by Leonardo Da Vinci hanging in my lounge!'
Everything goes dark.
'stand by you,' he stutters, 'but I will. For as long as you'll let me, I'll be here for you and the boys. I just need to know what you'll let me do; I need to know how not to overstep.'
'Maybe all of them?' Pete gazes up at him.
'Clear for now,' he calls.
*          *          *
'Sorry I shouted.'
'Pepper! I fucked up,' Tony barges into Pepper's suite, collapses beside her on the couch and pushes his head into her lap.
'Have you been working all night?' Steve scrubs at his face as he looks up at his bed partner.
'He is very fond of you, sir,' his AI is serious again now. 'And of Peter.'
Steve walks back upstairs feeling somewhat crushed but mostly confused. Sitting down on one of the large sofas he doesn’t immediately notice Pepper is round.
'I... Yes, good,' Steve smiles despite himself.
He sighs and moves the muffins to his kitchen island and the painting, very carefully, to his spare room.
'I don't want to watch you die, Tony!'
‘I need to get back to my tower,’ Tony pulls himself to his feet and Steve stands to steady him. ‘Jarvis, start fabrication of a new reactor casing.’
'When you referred to them as a pack of short sighted jackasses with all the forethought and technical knowhow of llamas I'm sure you meant it with the highest level of affection.'
‘Right,’ Steve sighs. ‘Can you let me know when he gets home?’
'I cannot do anything but advise you to do just that,' Jarvis replies. 'I do not believe Captain Rogers will object to being woken.'
'I built things,' Tony shrugs. 'Basic machines, small weapons powered with elastic bands... I don't know.'
'I don't know what Howard became while I was in the ice...' he hesitates when Tony's gaze snaps to him. 'I don't know how he could have... You aren't Howard. Your sons will know their Dada loves them.'
‘Yes,’ Steve beams at him as he steps back.
'Those fucking bastards!' Tony suddenly seethes over the comm.
Steve hadn’t noticed Tony tensing in his sleep but he jolts upright with a wordless yell. His eyes are wide as his heels scrabble for purchase against the sofa and he pushes himself against the arm,
'Calibration complete,' Jarvis speaks from the room rather than his earbud.
'Dada is the best,' Pete tells him as he kneels up on his chair.
'I... No. Come on. No,' Tony realises he's babbling denials. 'It's not...'
Tony just shakes his head,
'Goodnight, Tony,' Steve smiles, 'sleep well.'
‘Oh,’ Steve pulls his hand back containing the phone, unsure how to continue.
‘Hi Tony,’ Steve calls to make sure Tony has actually spotted them.
'I like you,' Tony mutters, sounding defensive.
He escapes while they're distracted.
'I hope not.'
'I guess,' Steve looks away awkwardly.
'I made my kid cry.'
Tony dips his head to press a kiss to the wet patch on his briefs and Steve takes a gulp of air.
He gives him a hopeless look,
'So speak quietly, yeah?'
'Don't,' he hears himself as if from a distance, 'don't...'
'Dada's a genius,' Pete reports seriously.
'Hi,' Steve smiles, 'good trip?'
now? 'you don't even wear a helmet.'
'I know. I understand. It's fine. I can wait.'
'Can't exactly tell them the truth; we might all be alright with him being a clone and Jim growing in a machine, but I hardly want everyone to know. Also it amuses me,' Tony admits with a grin. 'I'll probably have Jarvis put together some bland exposé from the surrogate and sell it to some rag; funnel the money into an adoption charity somewhere.'
'Dummy is stealing Colonel Rhodes' possessions from his abandoned coat.'
'Mister Stark?'
'You're an angel,' he doesn't bother sitting down.
They chat until another young lady comes to claim a dance from the great Tony Stark and steals his drink, which she gives to Steve, as she loops her arm through Tony’s. Steve watches Tony show off for a few songs before he passes the lady on and returns to Steve’s side.
'Oh thank God he's ok,' he takes two steps forward before faltering to a stop as he registers Tony's expression.
‘Broke toaster,’ Hulk informs him.
'You seem to have the same one.'
He sways in the air and looks down,
It isn’t strictly their area, but Steve takes the decision to go anyway; he needs something to prove to himself that he and Tony can still work together.
'I am not certain. Captain Rogers displays love struck behaviours, such as spending much time with sir, drawing his features from memory and acting protective towards him against SHIELD. However he has not been vocal whilst masturbating so I...'
‘And the shrapnel,’ Tony adds to Steve. ‘Do you honestly think I’m suicidal?’
He doesn’t quite close the door, so he hears what Jarvis says next,
'You seem troubled. There is little I can do to reassure you, but sir is ok.'
'Dada!' Pete pipes up. 'Look, Dada, Alfred put crisps in my cheese sandwich!'
'The time is seven forty five,' Jarvis responds.
The figure in front of him has their hands up and has backed away.
'Can I think about it for a minute before I decide?'
'Pete can pick out some toys and we could go to my floor?' Steve suggests as he gets up to load Tony's dishwasher.
~Teri
He hands over the photo of Jim,
'Hey,' Steve spots Pete opening the liquor cabinet under the bar, 'hey, no! Pete, no!'
'With Japan?'
!' Pepper interrupts. 'He thinks the world of you.'
Steve swallows heavily.
Tony finds himself giggling and tries to take a gulp of breath to calm himself.
hand things to Tony.
'Animals,' Pete declares.
Tony gazes at him as if not quite sure he recognises him,
Steve jolts in surprise and gazes over at him with wide eyes. Eyes which turn adoring as he looks Tony over.
'I want to stay with you.'
He steps further out onto his landing pad and looks across the skyline.
The man makes a strange sound and Dada stares out of the phone at him.
He feels as he's shifted to lie on the sofa and then drifts off again.
'Tony, can you please not plan to put advanced weapons on a child's toy?' Steve calls.
'Hey,' Tony yells up to Hulk when he gets to his side, the giant swings his head down and snorts. 'I'm not going to let you live down trying to defend a master assassin from a street bum, by the way.'
'We're taking this upstairs,' Tony declares and tows him away from the sofa and up the stairs.
The boy tucks himself tighter to Tony's chest as they go outside, burying his face against the arc reactor and away from the wind that races across the deck. They move quickly over to the jet and up the steps as the flight crew finish the preparations for take off.
'Alright then,' Tony opts to ignore him and just steal his phone. 'They're good,' he approves as he flicks through the couple of shots Steve has taken before handing the phone back.
The doors slide open and whatever Pepper may have been planning to say to him instead comes out as,
He pulls out his picture of Jim,
'Yes, Captain,' Jarvis confirms as the lift rises.
‘I’ll see you back at the Tower,’ the Iron Man suit offers a wave and then zips away.
'Pepper?'
'And I can come back?' Pete checks.
Steve nods and takes a careful step towards Tony. He gestures down the street,
'Tony,' Pepper greets him at the lift as he steps onto the conference room floor.
'He's really angry, Tony,' Steve calls back but does raise his hands non-threateningly.
There's a choked noise from the hallway.
'It's just genetics,' Tony continues weakly, 'you shouldn't have to be involved if you don't want to be.'
'I just need coffee,' he grins and then glances around, 'and pants...'
'Did he?' Steve tries not to laugh as Clint groans and drops his face into his hands.
'With some things,' he agrees quietly.
'Doesn't that get... dicey?' she isn't convinced.
'I don't necessarily mean permanently,' Tony dismisses. 'I mean to do those father son bonding things that real people do.'
'Tony,' Steve interrupts with a smile, 'we'll be fine. I'll make lunch and make sure he has a nap. If we need anything I'll ask Jarvis to alert you.'
Tony glances at him over his tablet,
'Come on, Cap,' Tony calls to him and Steve realises they've started to move off without him. 'I'm taking Hulk to see the ducks.'
'You can always find Dada. Dada said so!' Pete accuses.
