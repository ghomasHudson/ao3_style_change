“Oh, my co-worker, we got to talking yesterday, it’s actually pretty nice to have a friend that’s out of high school. She understands the stupidity of cliques and drama. No one really should care who’s dating who, ya know?” He said in a quick breath, something he had been wanting to get off his chest to someone for a little while now.
Benny pulled away with a smirk plastered on his smug face. “It’s been way too long baby, you didn’t last that long. Do you wanna come again?” The somewhat submissive brunette gave an incredulous nod as he struggled against the hands around his wrists. Being blown by Benny was always an adventure for him, especially when there was alcohol involved.
All Dean could think about the next morning was his teacher, and not in a school related context. He even had to take care of himself in the shower. Dean felt dirty in both meanings of the word. Everything that happened over the weekend with ‘Cas’ — god Dean loved that nickname — made him see all of his teachers as people rather than mindless drones.
Both of the boys rushed inside, expecting their father, but he was nowhere to be seen, or heard. “Dad?” Dean called out cautiously.
“No, Dean, as long as you are sure of yourself and stay safe, that’s all I care about. I just want you to be happy.” Sam gave his brother a warm smile. “Now, can we go homeeee I have school tomorrow!”
“Me too. It was good to see you at the diner. And here tonight.” She turned back to making coffee and cleaning up the endless bottles and cups laying all around them.
For a minute when he had nothing to do Dean checked his phone and he had two texts from numbers he didn’t have saved.
Dean got up and walked into the kitchen, his friend’s voice fading out of range. He knew this house like the back of his hand. They met in the first grade when Dean spilled his PB&J all over her ‘123 Book.’ She was so mad he could have sworn her head was going to pop off, but their teacher, Mr. Henriksen cooled her off with a more interesting book. At recess that day she pushed him into the wood chips and they laughed it all off. As long as Dean can remember he has loved making Charlie laugh, it made him happy, calm. After that fateful day at recess Dean was pretty much in the Bradbury house every week, he used any excuse to not be at home, he even brought Sammy around as he got older.
“I’m just messing around Cas , don't worry" Dean said to calm his teacher down . Although he did find the tattoos a little mysterious.
Dean remembers regretting the words as soon as he had said them. On the other hand his teacher did not deny the statement, simply paid Dean for the muffler and let the conversation drift to an end with a ’see you in school’
“I like giiirlss too!” Dean exclaimed with a slur to his words which Novak picked up on, but skipped over for the time being. He walked back to the front of the classroom and continued his lesson on the Vietnam war.
The rest of Dean’s shift went pretty smoothly, he had a bunch of regulars that he knew and loved. Around ten o’clock it the food orders slowed down significantly and they started to clean up the kitchen. Ellen thought it was appropriate to leave, she trusted everyone else here to close up properly. She took Dean off the floor and stuck him behind the bar, but he told Ash and Jo that he would keep an eye on table two.
The scotch in one hand and this bright fruity drink in the other. He steadied his breath and walked back over to the table. As he walked up he heard low voices in conversation and they muted when he got to the table. He put their drinks down respectively and turned to walk away.
When he wrapped up the lesson with around five minutes left of class he went over what they were supposed to do for homework, watch a video and answer eight questions. After everyone had acknowledged that they had homework, he let them talk amongst themselves. Castiel found himself listening extra close to a certain conversation.
Tonight the drunk kids that he knew unfortunately were from the football team, including Benny. There were also a few cheerleaders with them. Clearly they had won tonight and they were out celebrating. One of the last people to walk in was his ex, Lisa. They still had something, but when she walked in his stomach dropped. Benny was sitting at the booth behind her with a bunch of guys.
“Yeah, everyone really likes him, better him than Mr. Morningstar, he’s the devil.” Dean rolled his eyes and relaxed his stance, leaning into the conversation.
Just so you know I have to pick up my little brother every Friday.” The younger boy interjected quickly, tensing up. Dropping his teachers hands in his lap and scratching the back of his neck. He couldn’t believe he had let his guard down.
Even with his helmet in hand he managed to forget that he just had his bike on him and not Baby. Sam would have to suck it up. Alfie’s house wasn’t too far away from theirs, 20 minutes at the most. Either way, he had no other options because he wasn’t going to go out of his way for his baby brother.
Dean was off to work at “Singer’s Auto Repair” where he worked weeknights after practice, but Sunday’s were usually free for him so he picked up an extra shift here and there. He turned on some low music and hummed along mindlessly. He was early to work at 11:30 as per usual. 30 minutes was no big deal, Bobby had come to expect this of the teenager. Bobby knew Dean all his life, just like Ellen. Only, Bobby knew John when Mary was alive and well.
“Thanks” Dean blushed, taking the sweet treats from her hand and immediately shoving one in his mouth.
Dean was rethinking the entire situation that happened after school as he walked up to Charlie’s door. He knocked and felt calm for the first time in weeks. A few moments later the door swung open to a nervous looking Charlie startling the boy out of his haze. He just gave her a knowing nod and she visibly relaxed, but didn’t notice she was still in front of the door.
Sam packed a change of clothes and a small blanket in his duffel bag. Dean threw on a black t-shirt and some old jeans. He grabbed the keys and called for his brother. Sam came trotting down the stairs with his unusually long arms and legs covered by his soccer jersey and shorts. This kid was going to be taller than Dean soon enough. His hair was short and he had goofy looking bangs. He was stupid smart and nerdy, but that was his Sammy and he would never get tired of him.
“You should see Sammy, he’s going to be taller than me soon enough.” Dean laughed setting down the tray as she sat herself up in bed.
“Drinking in school is highly frowned upon, Dean. I think you know that though” he said turning back to the chalkboard.
“Yeah. Ellen made an extra one for me during the week.” He tried not to wince as he remembered that was only hours ago.
When Dean walked into his Spanish class his jaw dropped. Instead of Señor Roman there was a rather attractive blonde woman at the front desk. Dean found his usual seat towards the back. The class collectively stared blankly until the final bell rang.
yes,,, so Lucifer is Adam's father in this fic I have stuff with other children planned for the FUTURE!!
“Actually he just went on a hunting trip with his friend, uhh, Daniel… Elkins I think” Dean smiled brightly at this information.
There was a quick succession of loud taps on the window next to his head. He jumped and hit his head on the roof of the car. He drew his hand from his face to his head which now hurt. Sam was laughing hysterically when Dean looked over. Rubbing his head with a scowl there was a click of the passenger-side door.
I am decidedly terrible at chapter descriptions. I was thinking about writing part of this in Castiel's POV lmk what you think.
“Right I know that, I just wanted to get through the day a little faster, I’m sorry for interrupting your class. I do, however, need to talk to you about what was said…” Dean trailed off getting more shy and tracing his thumb over the necklace his brother gave him a few years ago for Christmas.
“Wow Deeean! Color me i-“ the bell cut her off “impressed.” she finished. They hugged before splitting up.
Dean really wanted this night to be over. His stupid little uniform looked especially stupid right now as he walked over to his friends. Lisa had ended up on one of his teammates laps and that made him undeniably jealous. Benny however could not keep his eyes off Dean.
Night was his favorite time to ride. Everything was calm and quiet. He had to ride 20 minutes to his other job and it was always better to be early. The roads were all but clear at 1 in the morning so he made it to the Diner before 1:30 which was nice because that meant he could take a quick power nap in the office. The only downside to working the graveyard shift on the weekends was all the kids that he knew coming in from parties.
“So,, Gabriel, why’d you want me over here?” Dean asked after a quick laugh and a dip in the conversation.
The clock that hung above the water-fountain in the locker room said he was going to be late to pick up Sam. He stripped his gear down to his shorts and t-shirt. This would have to do until he could shower at home. With his backpack over his shoulder Dean was running out the back hallway. Just past the gyms he crashed into someone.
“You can keep this between us, I’ll do whatever you want, but I can’t have CPS called, I really can’t.” Dean said wiping away the last of his tears and giving both his hands over to Cas. Dean liked that nickname for his seemingly stiff teacher, more fun than his usual demeanor.
“Ugh we were safe and fell asleep together.” Dean lovingly punched his friend’s arm. “Hmm, what else… Oh YEAH! Lisa and I had a moment of closure and forgiveness which was really nice. Then we almost had breakfast at The Diner, but my dad called me and now he’s gone for the week or something. Worked the auto shop Sunday, then home, and that’s about it.” Dean finished. “OH! I walked in on Sammy and his girlfriend! It was freakin’ hilarious.” Dean practically shouted before Charlie could ‘sush’ him.
Dean was always the first person on the field and the last player off, even before he made captain. He loved the sport, but his teammates often left the field a mess. The custodian was getting ready to lock the ‘Boy’s’ entrance to the locker rooms.
“Sure thing kid, I'll finish up this last paperwork" Bobby sighed, he had been doing this job too long. “Call me when you get home, yeah?”
“Earth to Dean, are you in there?” She asked, waving her hand in front of his eyes. He cracked a smile and looked up at her with bright green eyes.
“How much longer can you stay there, do you need me to pick you up?” Dean asked, looking at Lisa as she busied herself pouring them coffee. She had a certain elegance to her, the way she moved and talked.
“Piece of shit, son, fuck you.” The older man said as he retreated in the direction of his room. Dean laid there for a moment with white spots of pain blurring out his vision. Eventually he moved his arm to get his phone from his pocket. The phone rang twice before he started to cry silent tears.
To his surprise his dick was hard, his dream had felt so real. Since yesterday Dean hadn’t been able to keep his mind off his teacher even though he knew it was wrong. He had never thought Castiel unattractive albeit a little dorky, but he had never thought of Cas in this way either. Whatever it was he had to get it under control as soon as possible.
Calling Cas had been a good idea, he needed someone to talk with. Dean took his brown military jacket his father had given him, he took the keys from the counter. Before walking out of the house he checked that Balthazar and Gabriel weren't outside. Silently he walked out, above his head, the full moon shone down the path to his Baby.
Castiel paid the bill and drove to his father's church. He used a few hours to clean the church altar and took a break around midnight. The darkness surrounded him when he stared at the mobile number again.
"I know," Dean's voice dropped a few octaves lower. He unclenched and clenched his hands on his lap. "I was curious—" Dean stopped midsentence. He frowned as he stood up although he never lifted a finger in his direction. "I got good news."
"Damn it, Anna," Castiel mumbled underneath his breath. Suddenly he saw the sky began to shatter thunder all around.
"Better than being hiding and feeling alone. The choice is yours," Anna said, she leaned closer to him. "A choice is better than following a father's orders."
He remembered how last night had ended. Anna had been uncharacteristically cold towards Dean the night before. He was here to apologize for his friend's rude behavior.
"Your father is worried about you. And you go on those dates that get you nowhere, it's for your own good. You need a friend," Anna puts down the empty glass on the table.
"Well, I am working on an album here and she is distracting," Dean defended himself. He gestured with his hands to prove his point. "Can't focus and stuff," Dean saw Sam definitely did not believe him.
Micheal nodded, "yes but we had...obstacles to get hold of Castiel. We lost many good soldiers and friends. However, their loss was worth it. I obtained the information he is in hiding but not where he is. I don't know."
Cas nodded. "Of course," he said. Dean saw the pain in his eyes for a second before Cas turned away, naked, by the way, the hot sexy God. Strong muscles Dean loved to touch. Not that he would ever tell a living soul. He crossed his arm over his shoulders. Dean's fingers played with white soft sheets. Dean raised his eyebrows when he saw the folded paper.
Castiel took a sip of the alcohol, which was apparently beer. He studied his friend for some moments, confusion once again shown on his face. "I don't understand, aren't we technically in the future?"
"He doesn't recall anything that happened after he died," Castiel murmured in a low tone. Dean's eyes narrowed when Castiel told that to Sam. They got no right to poke around in his archangel life which was great by the way. Ten out of ten.
Then the first attack against the barricaded door happened. The door bulged inwards by the pressure. "Sammy, tell me what's going on, right now!" Dean yelled, his eyes kept drifting from him to the door.
"Sammy," Dean moved to him, Sam was quick to catch his brother wasn't really there. "It's going to be okay." Dean's strong arms grabbed him by the shoulders. Sam rested his head on his shoulder. The smell of mint hit his nose, Sam wrinkled his nose. His brother had before he died smelled of leather, metal, and musk. Must be the angel-mojo he concluded.
In the first month, Dean demanded answers from Bobby. Even he did not tell him everything he needed to know. For the attempted Dean found out about the hellhounds, he didn't believe a crap. He saw his ex's text messages, she worried about him since Dean hadn't shared a word for weeks. Not that it mattered anymore.
Dean excused himself and sat in front of the interesting man. The man's hands fist themselves together. An awkward silence passed, neither willing to break it. Dean took a sip from his beer and cleared his throat before he managed to make an understandable sentence he was disrupted.
Dean leaned into Benny’s face, cupping his cheeks in a fervent kiss. They were being quiet in the dark room. Dean knew it was wrong to use Benny the way that he was, for a distraction. Not that Benny wasn’t boyfriend material, but Dean always pictured him setting down with a southern girl. In addition they were not very public with their fling, as much as Benny tried to make it obvious.
Dean laughed and gave a bright smile, something he seemed to be doing more genuinely since Friday afternoon. The thing was that Dean finally felt seen by someone other than his friends . An adult trusted him and was looking after him. Someone who didn't even know John . Someone Dean felt like he could trust too.
“Yeah, I did, I haven’t let loose in a little while and yesterday threw me for a ride.” Dean said honestly.
“Oh no! I love the subject, you’re a great teacher too, so passionate, I’m so thankful.” Dean blushed quickly.
OMGGGG I AM SO SORRY THAT THIS TOOK SO LONG TO GET OUT. MOLLY WAS DEPRESSED AS ALL GET OUT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A DEAD FIC AND I AM DEFINITELY WORKING ON NEW THINGS AND UPDATING AT A BETTER PACE. THIS CHAPTER IS A LITTLE LONGER TO HOPEFULLY MAKE UP FOR ME BEING GONE FOR SO LONG.
Dean gasped and pulled his sleeve down, “Oh, I was cooking dinner for my little brother the other night and grease popped onto my arm and I -“ his sentence was cut off by the bell
Charlie was a little bit overwhelmed with her mom for thanksgiving, so Dean pulled out his phone during History to text Ellen. He figured it would not be a big deal, Cas and all, but he was mistaken.
They sat in comfortable silence as Sam finished his pizza and Dean sang along to the booming music. As they neared the house he lowered the music and gave sam a knowing glance. A look that said ‘get in, get out.’ In the drive way Dean shut off the car and they both took deep breaths before they got out of the car. As soon as they got to the door, Dean instinctively puts himself in front of Sam, expecting the worst.
Once they were the last people in class they made their way out the door and turned their separate ways. Dean walked slowly in the direction of Mr. Novak’s classroom and thought about what he was going to say, what lie he was going to come up with.
“Sorry they’re in a napkin, but I know you love powdered donuts. I had a post-test party in my English class, we all aced it!” She said excitedly. “Suck it, Great Gatsby!” Charlie giggled at herself.
“We studied hard right? Honors pre-calc is about to be our bitch.” Dean held his hand up for their secret handshake.
Y'all I lied, I have so much college work to do this week the chapter will probably be up on Friday or Saturday so that I don't flunk out.
On the way there, their conversation was light and easy. It was all reminiscing and happy memories. Lisa picked out her favorite cassette that Dean had and played “Nothing Else Mattered.” Dean argued with her saying that the song was overplayed just because it was popular, they had much better songs. She argued back saying that there was also so much more to music than Metallica and Led Zeppelin. They laughed and Dean was good, they hadn’t spoken many words since the official end of their relationship. Thank goodness Lisa was not the type of person to go around spreading rumors of cheating and Dean’s secrets.
“Oh, yeah he’s fine, you wanna head to breakfast, my diner is 24 hours.” Dean snapped out his thoughts about how gorgeous Lisa really was. He smiled and moved over to her, almost close enough to kiss. A hand was soon placed on her shoulder and he kissed the top of her head.
There was a knocking at the door and a voice he recognized. The door swung open, but for some reason Benny was not by his side. His vision was blurred so he rubbed his eyes. Dean could finally make out the person in the doorway that was spilling light into the otherwise dark room. Castiel stood before him in a white button up, black slacks, dress shoes, a blue tie that brought out his eyes, and of course his trench coat. Soon Cas closed the door and relocked it behind him. Dean’s head cocked to the side, but was only met by a wicked smile on his teacher’s face.
“Good, how about you?” Dean had always liked Bobby, probably more than his own father at this point. He once took Sam in when Dean was sent to a foster home. John had just left them for one of his hunting trips when they were just 7 and 3 years old. John came back eventually and that’s when things got really bad for Dean, especially as he started to question his sexuality.
On the way up the stairs there was a lot of fumbling but nothing could compare to Benny’s hands running up and down his body. They made it into one of the guest bedrooms finally and locked the door behind them. The music was thudding beneath their feet. Dean was forcefully pushed against the wall of the room in the fancy house. He whimpered in the heated kiss as Benny flicked his perky nipples under the black shirt that he looked so good in. The two boys pulled away as they undressed each other to their underwear. "Do you want to move to the bed or would you prefer to be fucked against the wall?" Benny whispered sweetly in the brunette’s ear.
His mind ran to the previous night, the way Benny was so assertive over him. With his free hand, he ran his fingers over the lips that were kissed heatedly. They trailed over his neck and caressed each of the red marks that were left embedded into his skin. Dean’s unoccupied hand slid up and down his hardening member. As the fantasy progressed he pinched his nipples, just like Benny had done, remembering all the dirty talk the southern boy was whispering.
He nodded again as Charlie walked over to the bottom of her stairs and yelled up to her mom, “HEY MA! YOU WANT SOME PIZZA??”
Thank you guys for sticking with this, let me know how you feel about the story as it progresses? ALSO WHY DID I NOT KNOW UNTIL TODAY HOW TO CHANGE THE TEXT SO YOU CAN ITALICIZE THINGS???? catch me italicizing like crazy in the future lmaoooo
“Bob, ’s okay, I’m almost 18, we will be out of there before you know it. If I don’t take it now it will go toSam and I can’t even bore that thought.” Dean comforted this boss in any way that he could. He sighed before clocking himself in, it did not seem like Bobby would be saying anything, anytime soon.
“See me after class” his teacher did not look pleased with him. His stomach dropped at the thought of being in trouble, but his heart fluttered at the many thoughts of how his teacher could punish him.
This one basically gives a bunch of background. Gives Charlie some depth and John. Start to see Dean and Sam's relationship, which we love. Dean is a good guy and I love him. Dean goes to work.... one of three jobs.
She reached across the table and heard his phone ring on the table. He stopped laughing immediately and wiped off his hands to pick it up. The screen read clear as day “JOHN WINCHESTER” and the picture Dean had taken a few years ago when he was passed out drunk made Dean's heart drop.
“Your teacher, Señor Roman is on leave for the rest of the semester so I will be taking over for him.” She smiled widely at the class. She somehow managed to sound mature and young at the same time.
“I’m sorry for snapping, just know that you made a very reckless decision that could have gotten you in a lot of trouble. Don’t ever do it again.” He finished on a serious note. Dean played with the bottom of his sleeve nervously and Mr. Novak’s eyes followed. “What happened to your arm again? The truth this time please”
“How old is your brother?” Castiel responded evenly not giving up on his quest to get his student to open up.
“B-both, the whole concept of being bisexual really, everyone at school knows, but I strongly prefer that it does not get back home to my father, because that would not be good” he chuckled and scratched the back of his head, his shirt sleeve pulled up and revealed a circular burn mark that Castiel was immediately drawn to.
Once he plopped down on his bed he knew he was beat. He peeled his jeans off of his body, followed by his shirt. He climbed under his comforter in his boxer briefs. Tonight was the end of his always long weekends. He slid his hand under the band of his underwear and sighed heavily at the release of tension.
“Oh yeah!!” He grabbed a napkin and a pen from the desk. “Here’s my number, text me anytime.” He smiled proud of his confidence. With that he grabbed his stuff and headed out to the parking lot.
Two fingers inside him quickly turned into three when he felt himself growing harder. He tried to keep himself at a steady pace, but after he hooked his fingers to hit his prostate he bucked his hips up, unconsciously moving his hand faster. After a few seconds his breathing and his hand slowed. He gently removed his fingers from his ass only to shove the dildo in his mouth so it was slick, his mind slipped into thoughts of what it would feel like to have his teacher’s dick in his mouth. That simple thought turned Dean on way more than it should have. His cheeks hollowed as he pulled it out to fill his hole again, but the vibrator was much more satisfying than his fingers would ever be.
“Yes, you may redress, I’m sorry for touching you. May I ask what happened to you?” Castiel pushed carefully.
At the car he was out of breath and his heart was still beating out of his chest, but not from running. He had forgotten the chill that was setting into the air that finally hit him when he sat down on the cold leather of his Baby. What did he just do? Dean swallowed the words burning his throat and focused on the engine purring under him as he sped across town to the middle school.
Sam and Dean stood there dumbfounded by what had just happened. Neither of them could comprehend if it was real or fake. Suddenly Sam started to laugh. Dean turned his head as Sam laughed even harder.
“Mhmm, take off your shirt and let me see that chest, huh?” Dean’s face flushed. “That’s what I thought, Jerk.”
“Damn Dean what is goin’ on with you?” Charlie whispered before the bell rang. All the students practically ran out of the room, but Dean stayed put. His mind was wracked with guilt for not paying attention, especially because he really liked this class… and his teacher.
“That place looked like fun! You got enough money?” Sam sounded genuinely concerned, obviously he knew about their issues.
He walked out the back door to catch his breath. There was his brother working on some random soccer drills in their fenced in backyard. Sam must have heard the door close because he looked up at Dean. The worried look on his face gave everything away… John was home. They both walked inside, Sam instinctually tucked behind Dean.
“Alright, drinks coming up and I’ll go put in your order for nachos and mozzarella sticks.” Dean cut into the banter that was about to take place. Once he walked away he took a deep breath. Somehow he knew this was going to be a long night for him.
The bell rang before he could read it. He grabbed his bag and hurried to meet Charlie by the art room, not giving an explanation to Benny.
After the bell rang Dr. Finnerman passed out the tests to pass back. He gave some basic directions and said “After you turn in your tests, please take the homework for tomorrow that is in a stack next to the basket.” Lucky for Dean he sat next to Kevin Tran, the smartest kid in school. He and Charlie studied extra hard Friday though, so he probably would not need help.
This is weird, but like as I'm writing I have to keep going back to past chapters because I'm just straight up lacking on what I wrote into the story already.
“Cas is fine, as long as it is after school, I come to your job, not once, but twice. You have earned it.” He said somewhat sternly with a small smile.
“Why were you drinking in school? You know that can get you suspended right?” Castiel snapped more hurtful than he meant it
Benny’s smirked returned as Dean repeatedly slammed his prostate and let out a string of obscenities. Benny pulled Dean down to kiss him with lots of tongue and biting. He moved to his collarbones and shoulders and left a few purple marks that Dean would have to cover up with make up so his teachers didn’t see. Why was he thinking about his teachers— scratch that, teacher— while riding his friend’s insanely good dick?
He brought them over, terrified for the awkward conversation that he knew would ensue. “Here you guys go! Extra sour cream just for you guys” Dean smiled and winked at the two men.
Benny’s mouth was still on Dean’s neck as he moaned and and said he was close. Dean pulled off and replaced himself with his mouth. Benny came soon after, letting out a lewd moan of Dean’s name.
’ spilling over his lips. There was cum on his hand and up his abdomen, the blankets were a mess, splayed out all over the bed.
“Yeah, yeah, alright, calm down.” Dean laughed and drove them home. The same song came on again, playing softly in the background to the hum of Baby.
Dean and Cas comfort and maybe fluff. Really just them being domestic. Kind of trigger warning, but if you read the last chapter its just the same as that ⚠️
Before they knew it Monday had rolled around again and they were back to it. Dean had to work this Monday, but he had Friday off which was arguably better for him.
“Gasp, Charlie, I would never.” Dean laughed in a mocking posh accent. Although he did not cheat he knew Kevin would not mind. The amount of times Dean saved him from the football team was through the roof.
“Get your guy under control man, he could barely get into the stall by himself.” Dean snapped at his teammate before making his way out of the bathroom.
English homework always seemed to trip him up. He blew through his History textbook reading. Math was done before the school day was over. Science is work in class most of the time, but Mrs. MacLeod was so hungover today they didn’t have anything. Spanish consisted of only simplistic worksheets and the new teacher would be giving them more of the same. Something about English made him scratch his head, Advanced Placement was not helping his case. The essay outline they had to take home should have been easy, but it took him nearly an hour to get quotes from the right sources.
“Yeah, it’s crazy, I feel like we were kids just yesterday.” He said as he pulled out his phone. “Just give me a sec, he’ll love to hear I’m talking to you.”
“Yeah. Don’t you worry about that, kid. I got it covered.” Dean laughed. He would not use more than one hundred dollars, he had already planned out the night.
“I’m…sorry…it's…just that…you use the same… conditioner,” Dean explained through laughs that he still couldn’t contain.
“What kind of pizza did you guys agree on?” He asked resting his head on top of hers. She seemed so small, so vulnerable when she was hugging him like this, he didn’t really want her to stop.
“I just wanted to let b both of you guys know that I am going on a hunting trip for 5-7 days. My friend Daniel - Daniel Elkins- is going to be here soon. I will keep in touch, but he should be here soon. I just thought it would be nice to let you boys know.” John smiled for the second time and his sons smiled back awkwardly. It was equally the strangest thing and the nicest thing John had done for his sons in years. “Oh, and I’m sorry for losing my temper this mor—“ He was cut off by a horn honking. “That's for me!” He patted Dean on the back before exiting with a duffel bag over his shoulder.
They sat and chatted about school, girls, boys, and life. By the time that they were all full there was one piece of bacon and two slices of cheese.
The quiet descends upon him apart from a few cars outside. He took a deep breath and settled. Sam's fingers played around with the amulet. Then blackness.
. When Sam shoved him playfully on the shoulder he snapped his gaze back to the game. "You got to be kidding me, my team is losing," Dean groaned in frustration.
His heart thrummed loudly in his ears. Dean felt trapped. If he walked in they would act as if nothing had happened or shift the topic. Dean clenched his fist and breath through his nose to calm down his heartbeat.
The angel was about to open the page as Sam's hand shot forward and stop the movement. "Don't open it. Even Father or God whatever you call him doesn't know about this, I checked. Keep it that way," he snapped.
"Why?" Camilla wiped away tears from her eyes. "I thought we were supposed to get married a-and..." She looked down to the floor and Cas's hand touched Dean's shoulder. Dean's shoulders relaxed and Dean lets out a quiet sigh.
Dean tapped his finger to the music, pretending the battle inside of him was non-existent. He could do that. But Cas's lips lingered on his thoughts.
"Which song do you want to learn?" Dean tapped his hand to the guitar creating a noise in the room. "We got
As if the prison cell knew the visitors were gone, the flames flared up again on his body. Sam closed his eyes and attempted to stay in his happy memories. Anything to escape the pain that nagged him day in and day out.
Dean went out of the car and sat back in the front seat. Cas followed his example and was on Sam's shotgun seat. Before Cas managed to open his mouth, his clear blue eyes giving him a questioning and confused glance Dean put on
"What's your type Cas?" Dean asked as he looked around the bar before he pointed out a woman with green eyes and dark blonde hair with curves. "She is your type, right?"
He took the familiar route to the living room. The desk was full of books open on different pages with drawn pictures in it. Dean noticed one of them was open with the title
"Drinking close to every day won't solve the problems you have. There exist people that can help if you let them," Anna took her hand into his. She laced their fingers together.
"First time I was here I was supposed to meet up alongside my boyfriend, the same night I meet you he up broke with me."
"I have information for you," Haziel began, his voice grave. His hand tight on Castiel's arm. "You can not open the paper before the time is ready. Dean has the key to solve it all, he will know once he read it. Before that, you got to be sure Dean never knows. He is still under the control of our enemies."
"No," Dean said stubbornly. "I got no idea where you get these things but they are not true." Castiel's eyes narrowed at him. He attempted to shake off the constant reminder of
. "Uh, Dean doesn't know because he got enough stuff going on already. The release of his new album is coming soon—"
"Thank you, Bobby," he was already by the fridge before Bobby had finished his sentence. He took out the white plate with cherry pie out on the counter. He licked his lips and mumbled to himself "Love me some pie." He pushed away from the thoughts about mythology, Dean knew such things never had existed and never will.
A few awkward moments later they had exchanged their numbers and Castiel managed to relax his shoulders. They talked for a bit later and Dean had to go for the other interview again. Once he saw Dean left the bar he turned to look at Dean's number on his phone.
"Yes," Castiel said. He moved to Dean in his own accord as he was into his personal space. Bobby moved unwillingly away from them, his mind probably back into his weapons that wouldn't work against him. "You," Castiel whispered the one word so solely Dean could hear.
He expected Crowley's blow with the angel blade he hid in his suit. Sam dodged it in one smooth movement, grabbed hold of Crowley's arm, and put pressure into it. He saw when Crowley used his demonic powers to his chest. One second he stood behind Crowley and the next his back hit the wall.
Dean flinched and closed his eyes. "Yes, sir?" He responded. His hands turned into fists. The burden of a failure laid over him. Dean was surprised how relaxed he sounded when he himself was on the brick to chaos.
"Cas, what's wrong? Whatever you say, I won't judge," Dean tried to persuade Cas. His hand was still awkwardly in between them. "What is said here, stays here."
"Angels don't exist we both know this," Sam didn't look up from the project he worked on consisting of new cover art he had saved to his computer.
He went into the shower and changed into more comfortable clothes. Castiel threw himself on the bed, it's softness welcoming from his sore legs. At some point, he had fallen asleep since when he woke up the lamps were on and the windows outside showed the faint lights of the city. He jolted up when he heard footsteps.
There were a bunch of weird-looking people that glared at him. Castiel felt unsure about the situation he was put into. Anna showed no signs to answer his question. "It's God," one of them muttered in a respectful yet fearful voice. His hair was black, skinny blue jeans and he wore a coal leather jacket. The man's eyes metallic blue, his skin pale as milk.
Dean flipped his blade in the air and gripped hold of it at the end. The point straight at Castiel's chest, however, Castiel was not able to see him. The blue in Castiel's eyes made him debut what he should do. His nature told him to follow orders. Carry them out, and don't think. Then why was it so difficult?
“O-okay anything you want.” Dean pulled himself up with his knees and let himself drop back down and picked up the pace. He leaned into the other boy’s ear and whispered "I want your big fat juicy cock to slam into me until I see stars!"
“Yeah, that doesn’t sound too bad. One day when neither of us has practice and you don’t have work…” She trailed off, smiling. None of those things ever happen all on the same day. Dean laughed at her smile and he felt happy. Lisa was not only his girlfriend most of sophomore year, but she was also someone who knew Dean and everything he went through, which was rare to come around these days.
“Nothing, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He tried to cover up his stupid mistake. The creamer was dumped quickly into his coffee and he took a sip so he couldn’t say more.
“No, actually good on all fronts. I just don’t want to get really involved with anyone right now, so I made that clear to both of them.” Dean smiled, impressed with his own maturity.
“I’ll have the Waffle with extra strawberries please” He batted his eyelashes at her jokingly. She smiled and wrote down his order on the pad in her hand.
“Are you sure it was from bacon, Mr. Winchester?” Castiel looked at him intensely as if willing him to give him the real story.
Dean was crawling away from his father as best he could. John’s boot came back and hit Dean in the stomach. His son doubled over underneath him.
“You ass, it’s my favorite, cherry blossom.” She countered his laughing, but gave in soon enough. They sat there laughing for a little while.
Dean was always and always would be in the front row cheering his little brother on. Sammy was center forward which dean only knew because he told him for days after he got the position. As annoyed as he was, he was even more proud. When Sam scored the first goal Dean was on his feet screaming at the top of his lungs. His brother looked over and smiled trying to be humble. Sam’s happiness was the only thing that ever mattered to Dean. Even if he had to work every night til he dropped. His brother deserved the world and Dean would do near anything to give it to him.
Lisa pawed at his chest pulling him away as his laugh continued to grow louder. “Don’t laugh at me!” She said defensively rubbing away any sadness that was on her face replaced by an endearing look of bewilderment. He was laughing at her.
, dumbass, I try to keep my sexuality quiet around teachers so they don’t, ya know tell my father” Dean sighed seeming defeated. His father always brought down his mood and sobered him up quicker than he could say ‘Sammy.’ “I’m going to apologize to Mr. Novak after class and explain the situation to him, tell Mrs. Klein I’ll be a little late to culinary”
“What can I do to help Dean?” Castiel asked seriously, with his hand still on Dean’s cheek and his other resting on the boy's knee.
“Hey dude, I didn’t hear from you all weekend. What gives?” Charlie said with a hurt tone of voice as she bumped into his side.
Once all the homework was filled out and neatly placed in his backpack he hopped in the hot shower. The water washed away the dry sweat and the overall stench of the day. His favorite part of every shower was using the cucumber body wash that made him smell clean. The sweet soap spread over his body with ease. His back hit the cold tiles at his side as he relaxed. All tension in the dirty-blonde’s body had been released. Soon enough the water started to run cold and Dean turned off the faucet.
The black car pulled up at 4:58 pm, just before Sam got out of practice. If he taught his brother right he would be helping his coach clean up the field. Dean looked at his hand as though he wished it would fall off.
Dean was none too focused on his speech about the heat, but rather paying close attention to the way he looked without his trench coat on. While he did happen to see him in much more revealing clothing this weekend, he had never seen him like this. The yell also caught the student’s attention. It excited Dean and made him fall into a daydream. He was staring at his teacher walking around the front of the classroom.
“I’ve been pretty good lately, even got myself a second date this week. Speaking of which can you close Wednesday night?” Bobby looked like he was blushing at just the thought of seeing this woman again.
Sam closed the trunk and hopped in the passenger seat as Dean started the car. His leather jacket lay in the seat between them.
“Yeah! Now tell me all about yours before class starts.” They were leaned up against the lockers outside Dean’s Spanish classroom. Charlie’s French class was one floor down.
Meg and Cas exchanged a short banter like good friends which made Dean smile. She left soon after she got there and Dean was left with his teacher, drinking coffee in silence. After his first sip he was so relieved he let out a short moan which made his eyes shoot open and he slowly looked at his teacher. Novak laughed and took another sip.
“Ahh, you and Gilda are so cute! I’m happy for you, Charles. Who kissed who first? I know you have been crushing for a few weeks.”
“All right, thank you, I should get going soon,” Dean said nervously even though he knew there was nothing to be nervous about. He was safe here, no risk of someone losing their temper over something so insignificant. “I’ll see you soon Mrs. B,” Dean said, flashing a quick smile as he rose to leave. Charlie stood with him to give him a quick hug goodbye.
The bell rang and everyone shot out the door, “I’ll try to get a pass” Dean mumbled to Charlie as she finished packing her bag.
It rang for a few seconds and his younger brother picked up the phone with a groggy voice. Dean laughed and said “Hi. Whose house are you at today?”
“Whatever, nerd. At at least I don't have a hickey on my neck the size of Jupiter." Dean huffed back immaturely.
“Do you need anything or am I good to clock out? [fill in later, girl who traveled from another dimension] just got here.”
Now they stood a foot apart, Cas sitting while he stood. Dean stopped in front of Cas, his fingers reaching out. "Can we take our time?" Cas asked. Dean restrained himself from touching Cas's shoulder.
"Hey, it could have gone worse," Dean joked to lighten up the situation. He glanced around in the room. "I think you should get to Broadway and wait until the crazy press is done doing its thing. You always wanted to be a pianist for famous musicians," he said. His chest felt tight. "I can pay the flight and the rest. From there you are on your own. You can call me when you need more help."
"I mean it," Sam cut him off. He laughed short humorlessly. "You fear me because I got more power than you can ever wish to gain and I am not having in my faith in any of you." Sam continued. He smiled dangerously now, he could feel the waves of fear coming from the king of hell. "I won't play by your rules. I will follow my own. You can go and screw yourself for all I care."
He lifted a glass of beer to his mouth before Anna took it away from him. Castiel stood with his hand empty from the glass that had been there before. "Anna," he sighed frustrated. He almost rolled his eyes but he turned towards her instead. "What is it? I am drinking."
Sam nodded if she planned to backstab on him, Haziel would know about it. Their relationship worked both ends. Lucifer would be difficult, demons all around the US feared the guy unlike they were higher ranking like himself. They departed in different directions after that.
Sam stood finally in a big cabin his big brother sometimes took him to when he was eight years old. The walls were made of thick wood that covered most of the ceiling, old pictures from them when they were younger Bobby had taken was there too. Mugs were locked inside glass shelves. A small fridge stood by the left side, a table some meters behind it.
His heart tightened in him. Dean's eyes flickered everywhere but the man in front of him. He felt suddenly exposed to the world. He took a deep breath, his feet staggered a few steps backward.
"I mean, is not healthy, there are better ways to vent out anger," Sam folded his hands on his desk. His hand stopped tugging. Sam smiled at him. "You haven't called your girlfriend lately either, but I just thought you would be more subtle about it," Sam shrugged.
"Do you never become tired of speaking like this?" Dean commented. He put the glass down and fumbled with the glass.
"No!" Dean's voice echoed through the parking lot. Castiel rushed to Dean's side but he was too late...
"Hello Dean," Castiel saw that Dean held back his emotions. He knew the tells; Dean kept his feelings under a tight wrap, letting nobody inside. Dean joked more than normal when Castiel before attempted to make him talk. "Are you all right?" Concern filled his voice.
"Only my brother get to call me that," Sam hissed through grit teeth. His Blade moved on his own account, he sliced Lucifer from the shoulder blade and down to his hip. A scream shattered the powerful sounds from flames far below. "Cut the bullshit."
Michael's presence was clear to him, he could recognize the sound of the wings everywhere. Dean held his gaze downcast. He attempted to clear his mind from his feelings. Harder than he anticipated. "Dean," Michael said.
Dean slapped the hand away. "How did you know?" Dean demanded. A flash of hurt passed Castiel's eyes. His posture straightened as well, however, neither of them did a move towards the angel blade on the ground in the middle of them both. "I don't get you," Dean snapped. "Why?"
Sam older—telling him to follow his dream. Later, when he fell in love with Camilla. Then, Sam's eyes clear, dead eyes, into his own. Dean almost lost the gun at that second. He held tighter around it, Dean's fingers laid more pressure on the gun, the barrel of it, into his head.
Dean took a run for it, he lashed to the left shoulder however Raphael stopped him halfway with his sword and forced Dean into the dirt. "Again," Raphael said.
When Dean found Sam reading the newspaper while munching on the last piece of bread he rolled his eyes. "Thanks, Sammy," he said sarcastically. He opened the fridge and made himself a sandwich before he sat down on the other side of the table.
The grass waved silently in the winds around him. He stood with Dean's guitar in his hand. Trees leaves flew around in the warm air. Behind Castiel's back, men and women were dressed in black like the custom were. Flowers in different rainbow colors surrounded him from every direction. A reminder of life. The gravestone stood in its gray colors. Castiel crunched down, his hand touched the letters of Dean's name.
"Shoot," Dean made himself comfortable on the chair and tapped his fingers towards some of the guitar strings, creating random combinations of sounds.
Dean scrambled up on his feet. "Sam!" without noticing his presence Sam bypassed them and went outside. Dean and Castiel followed shortly after. Worry etched into their faces. "Sammy!" Dean yelled again. His chest heaved, his pupils dilated. Dean ran down the stairs and Castiel saw Sam throw the bag into the bag seat before he began to drive the car.
"Son of a bitch," Dean swore irritated. Sam read his brother as an open book, he was upset about someone, most likely the person he had advised on.
He saw how his big brother's eyes widened in surprise and relief when Cas touched his wrist. He knew then that both of them needed one another. Although the media wasn't exactly the happiest about gayness and cheating with his girlfriend, he would have to protect them at any cost.
He went down to the garden, on the backside to get privacy. To be personal with music had never been a problem until now...
"Good," Father smiled. "We can work with that." Then Father turned to him and his smile fell from his face. "How are you, Dean?"
and we got an hour to get there," Sam said once he was close enough. He took the guitar and gestured him to follow.
Dean wiped away the tears from his eyes. "Nothing, is just I have never met someone like you." Dean continued to laugh for a few minutes more.
"Stop staring at me," Dean turned towards him. His hand clenched around the console. Castiel froze in his movement. He moved his head that way he stared at the gray wall that held just a painting of a dog. He decided to sit on the bed opposite the bed Dean. Blue eyes pierced into green. Castiel rubbed the back of his head.
Castiel stood up and changed to a black suit, dark blue tie with white stripes, and ebony-colored shoes. He straightened his tie and checked the time. Later Castiel ate breakfast with Camilla and Sam. They talked about the usual things.
God opened his mouth to respond, however, Raphael, the nasty bastard he was answered instead. "Don't be stupid, there is only one God that matters. Is Chuck and not you. An apocalypse is set into motion and we can't have you interfering," Raphael got a nod from Michael. Lucifer's jaw tightened. Crowley merely seemed to be bored. Cas shook his head but a glint blazed in his eyes.
Castiel moved his head and he rested his palms on his black pants. The warm air began to make his throat feel dry. He licked his lips and almost fell down when he saw Dean's green eyes following it. Castiel composed himself. "I thought more of the lines of learning to play
Dean nodded, "Yes, I thought you were out there blowing demons to hell? Or leading a war?" He moved closer to the other archangel. A slow frown became to take form on his features. Dean glanced at his angel blade before he hid it into his suit again. He lifted his gaze to the archangel.
Dean slowly lifted his gaze. He covered his upper part of his body, the intensity of Dean's stare made him feel completely naked underneath it. Still, they were just acquaintances, Castiel should not care. He cleared his throat and Dean moved his fingers on the strings again, playing out the first verse.
"What are you?" He hissed. Castiel blanked out for two full seconds before a strangled sound escaped his throat.
He used pure strength from the Mark to summon the Blade. Out of the corner of his eye, Bobby killed Crowley by chopping his head off. Dean stabbed Lucifer to death. Blood covered half of his face already.
"Castiel," Haziel started. "The demons are on our side at the moment. Crowley wishes to talk to you later when you have time," Haziel finished. Haziel put his hands in his pockets, Dean frowned. Such a human move.
Dean saw the white papers spread over the floor. Coffee was on the far end. He didn't felt so much for it but it was only things left to fix. Not much later every time was the way Dean liked it, a content feeling in his chest. He checked his clock one more time. Sam was during errands for his coming albums. All safe.
After that, they called for a short break. Castiel sat on a chair, he rested his hands against his cheeks. His fear was shown through his constant try to wipe his wet hands on his trenchcoat, his flickering gaze, and biting his under lip. Dean's knee touched his, they shared a short imitate minute by looking into green and blue. "Have you seen Sam?" Dean asked, his voice filled with concern.
Father nodded. "Yes, it's a mission waiting for you, but you need to complete Raphael's tasks before that," he turned away. Then vanished as he was never there.
"I have to," Castiel said, he smiled tiredly. He didn't expect her to understand, she worked his whole life to accept this position and bring the new world order to the motion. But what if Father wasn't the enemy? What then? Castiel let his gaze wander to Anna. She wore her usual black suit as always with a white shirt underneath. Her red hair in layers to beyond her shoulders. "For Dean," he continued.
"Gabriel and Balthazar are here. For 'protection of dangerous enemies', I got no idea what crawled up their asses," Dean shrugged as he leads the way to the kitchen and gave him a beer to drink. Castiel tasted it but concentrated on Dean under his eyelashes.
"Sam," Castiel greeted the person, Sam nodded and moved towards him. Dean's feet got away quicker than light could reach him. "I found Dean, and I did expect you here," he continued as if Dean's reaction were just part of his plan.
Dean grit his teeth together. He had no way getting out of it, Cas was speaking the truth after all.
"No! Maybe, I don't know," Dean rubbed his neck and looked everywhere but his brother. The air felt suddenly tight in his lungs. It rose in tension in the room and Dean wanted badly to get out. He wasn't a cheater, he was well aware of that. Dean stopped rubbing his neck and met Sam's gaze again. "It's complicated, okay? I researching to help Cas with his alcohol problem. Helping a bro out has never hurt anyone," Dean said unsure who he tried to convince.
No matter what he did, the green eyes kept haunting him. In his dreams, he would hear music for a while but when he woke up the dream becomes forgotten, the one thing that repeated itself every time was the song and the green eyes. Who he dreamed about he didn't know, Castiel turned to stare at the other side of the bar.
He sat on his usual seat, Sammy by his side. Camilla on the right and Cas on the left. Dean cleared his throat. "California, here we go." He put his feet on the pedal to the metal, put in an
Dean’s next class was AP English Literature (AP Lit) with Mr. Ketch. He first met his teacher last year when he was just a substitute for his Honors English 2 class. English was definitely his forte, the accent was a bit much sometimes though. In this class he had to pay more attention because it was Advanced Placement which meant a lot more work for him. Work that he always did at The Garage on weeknights, it was mostly boring readings and essays about books that Dean did not read. He would have liked to read the books, but it was not plausible between football and raising his little brother.
His face was so close to the soaked tent, it almost felt painful for Dean, knowing that he could not force Benny to deep-throat his aching member. “Y-yes, now p-please suck my dick” Dean laughed nervously feeling exposed.
“I’m happy we’re doing this.” He said as he grabbed her hand. She laced her fingers through his and slid a little closer on the bench seat. Dean had definitely missed this more than he thought he could.
“Workin' on our night moves/Tryna make some front page drive-in news/Workin' on our night moves” The brothers sang happily.
Jo started to close out all the remaining tabs and close out the register while Dean wrapped up his tasks and started packing up to leave. All there was left to do was wipe the bar, shut the lights off and lock up. He grabbed his keys and helmet to bid Jo a goodbye.
Once the teens were gone there was limited business as usual, a few families stopping for a bite to eat on a vacation of some sort, then the few homeless people looking for some water and warmth. Dean was more than familiar with a few of the homeless guys, they came by the Road House earlier in the night and then come here early in the morning.
“Yeah. Don’t you worry about that, kid. I got it covered.” Dean laughed. He would not use more than one hundred dollars, he had already planned out the night.
“Uh, Sam has practice until 6:30, I have to pick him up and be home by seven.” He quietly thought out loud.
8 o’clock rolled around a lot faster than he thought it would and Dean found himself sad that he had to leave his new friend. Wow, two new friends in two days, that has to be some kind of record for Dean. He started to do all his side work so he could leave a few minutes early.
The song made him get a lump in his throat. Castiel recalled how open Dean had been when he introduced him to the world of music. The way his eyes twinkled in the lights above their heads. His rough fingertips against his soft ones. Then Castiel finally let his voice loose.
Sam sat stunned to silence by the man's words. His eyes flickered down to the table. "Thank you," he managed to say. The weight of the words was like Chuck had given the whole burden of the whole mountain itself. Sam's eyes moved to the amulet again. Its beauty couldn't compare to the symbol Sam was determined to find out. The rest of the night the talk consisted of the newest hunting, news, however, with a hint of worry.
Dean opened the door and greeted Gabriel on the way. The guy never seemed to need sleep for some reason he filtered that information to ask him later. Dean opened up the trunk and took out his guitar, he patted it softly with his fingers before he lifted it completely.
"Daemon, esto subjecto voluntati meae." When he finished his last words Sam felt a change in the air. It cracked in his skull. However, no sounds reached his head. Unintentionally he flinched. Eyes bored into his back. A chill went down his spine. Sam never expected it to actually work. Swiftly on his feet, he faced the demon.
"You aren't supposed to see this, Dean. I am trying to protect you," Sam moved over to the bag again, he took out iron strings that he fastened on the door. He threw the key to a random place on the floor. He rubbed his eyes. For the tenth time that day, Sam checked his watch. He had done everything he could and now the only thing left to do was to wait.
"Don't go too quick on this, Cas isn't like any of the other women you ...you know," Sam gestured with his hands to prove his point. He put on the plates on the table while Dean took the soup-like into a form to create a pie.
Sam grits his teeth together when he saw the red flooding over to his own. The Mark fastened itself on him. Sam took a few breaths. This was entirely different, the willingness to destroy was bigger than ever. Lucifer snapped his fingers, "the Blade," he said.
"I have to tend my armies as well," Castiel began. Sam glanced around the nonsuspicious humans around them. "Some angels are split and taking sides with Fathers instead of myself. I will need your manpower when they do attack us. Their biggest asset is the archangels which include Dean. I will get him home," Castiel ended his short speech.
"Nothing is going to hurt you as long I am around," Dean gave him a short hug. He squeezed Sam's shoulder before a restrained smile covered his face.
The rest of the ride was quiet, Dean was still thinking about his day dream, damning himself for letting it get him heated. Sam’s gaze was out the window looking at the orange and yellow foliage. The suburbs were pretty this time of year, no one could deny that. Somehow the house felt warmer when John was not there, the brothers were more at ease.
“All right, lemme grab a jacket real quick.” He said walking towards the coat closet. Where are we going anyway?”
“Oh you bet I am! Three more hours, amirite?” She laughed back, smile dimming a little bit. “What can I get you guys?”
“What’s up?” Sam called back from the kitchen. He knew well enough by now not to argue when Dean called him by that nickname even if it did make him sound like a little kid.
Dean could practically hear his brother's infamous sarcasm and his bitchface through the text. He laughed to himself and turned back to Lisa who was looking out the kitchen window at some birds on the bird feeder. There was a small smile on her lips, for a second he just admired her beauty. Finally the birds she was watching flew away and she looked back at Dean. His eyes were fixed on her, thoughts trailed off to somewhere unknown.
Charlie let out a nervous chuckle and said “I am soooo not jealous that Dean liked boys and I don’t” she ended confidently, but earned a heavy glare from Dean.
I will probably end up rewriting a lot of this chapter so I will let you know at the beginning of the next chapter if you should go back and read it. Please give me feedbackkkkkk.
“Huh, if you don’t like people why become a teacher? Is it the power trip?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Good to know, will you give me a discount if I go there, my muffler has been making a funny sound.” Castiel quipped back.
It was starting to hurt to hold it in. “I-I, Benny, I’m so close…” Dean trailed off trying to last a little bit longer in his inebriated state. He felt Benny’s lips curl. His eyes widened as realization struck him. He was not going to stop. That was the last thought left before he saw pure white scenery as he came down Benny’s throat. The lips around his cock became tighter as he swallowed the load.
Dean did however notice Benny and watched the way his hips moved when he walked mesmerized by him, maybe that was the alcohol talking, maybe not. Either way he was well and truly fucked for the night. Once Benny laid eyes on Dean it was game over. They went inside together and ripped a few shots of whatever was left on the table, some vodka Dean thinks, something sweet, and something that tasted like cinnamon. After they maxed out on shots they went over to the, what seemed to be the living room, lord knows this house had too many rooms. Anyway the pong table was set up and Crowley was playing with Azazel, they were the kings of the table.
“It’s bad, huh?” He asked quietly so he didn’t startle his brother. Dean nodded his head solemnly with a glance. He then loosened his grip, looked back at the road and the car was silent the rest of the ride.
Every chapter from here on out will hopefully be about 3,000 words give or take. Let me know which way you guys think I should take this. I have many ideas, maybe you guys could help.
“You are lyin’ ta me, you like it huh? Don’t cha’” Dean was knocked down to the couch for a second before regaining his footing. There was definitely blood in his mouth and his face was starting to swell.
“Are you going to pick him up?” His father asked, with another out of place smile. This was not the John that Dean had become oh so familiar with
“Oh that’s cute, you like the way he teaches because he won’t tell me if he’s good at his job. Too modest or something” Gabriel chuckled, something he seemed to be doing a lot of.
“About you liking boys? Or girls? Or both?” His teacher queried sitting back at his desk with an annoying smirk.
“Are you prepared to answer the question or was I interrupting something?” Novak snapped at him, obviously disappointed.
“HEY! I was just covering your drunk ass, don’t go blaming me for any of this” she replied rolling her eyes “I was just thinking on the fly, I’m sorry for saying something that everyone in class
The phone rang and he ordered quickly, holding onto Charlie tightly the whole time. Dean held Charlie tight even after he had ordered. They stayed like that for a while, just breathing each other in, in the silence. They lost track of time and the doorbell rang, signifying they had been there for 15-20 minutes, and they jumped out of each other’s arms as if they had been caught doing something wrong. Charlie left the kitchen to go grab the door leaving Dean to space out and get lost in his thoughts, something that seemed to be happening a lot today. His body slouched at the loss of warmth from his best friend. Charlie returned to the kitchen a few minutes later to a dazed Dean looking at the table.
Dean placed their check down at about 12:45 AM. He said “Your cab is going to be here in about 10 minutes. I would finish your drinks and go home.” And walked away before either of them had seen his phone number. He watched them carefully as they gave Jo the card and struggled to get up. They looked over to Dean a few times, but he trusted that they knew he was just worried about them. Once the card came back they left and the door slammed shut behind them in the fall wind.
“Tomorrow, no slacking off then, get off to cooking or whatever.” Castiel cringed because he should not have known Dean’s schedule as well as he did.
Castiel walked back into the classroom to see Dean sitting in his desk chair twirling around absent-mindedly, picking at something on his hand. “Dean,” he jumped out of his trance and looked at his teacher
Dean put his shirt back on slowly, and he could feel his teacher’s eye on him. He remembered Charlie’s comment from earlier and he smirked as he looked up to lock eyes with the older man. Green met blue and Dean was not going to give out.
“No sir, I guess I am just tired.” Dean’s heart skipped a beat when he lied, he did not like it one bit.
“It’s okay” Dean said, pulling her closer and kissing the pretty dark brown hair on top of her head. He inhaled and got a whiff of her conditioner, it smelled the same as he remembered and chuckled to himself.
“Actually, you know what they say, never cook bacon naked, I learned my lesson” Dean laughed brushing it off. “Why three sugars? You like your coffee sweet?” He tried, and failed to change the subject.
“Oh shit, hey, sorry for sitting in your chair, and sorry again for swearing.” He was back to speaking very quickly.
He eventually sobered up from his laughter when Sam gave one of his patented ‘bitch-faces.’ “What are your plans for the night?”
When he pulled up to the school he saw a few kids with his brother walking off the field. He instantly turned the music even louder and honked to get his brother’s friends attention. Sam hung his head as they all burst into laughter, he glared at Dean and his friends patted his back as he walked away. He didn’t look at Dean when he got in the car, he looked solemnly out the window until they were about a quarter mile down the road. Even then the look on Sam’s face could kill, but it only made Dean break out into another fit of giggles, his mission was a success. After he had finished he absentmindedly hummed along to whatever Metallica song was playing.
They left the house without looking back. Dean could not wait until he left that house for the last time. He would miss the memories of his mother, but they had been drowned out by the years of beatings. All that was really left of Mary were pictures and old jewelry. The house smelled like John, which consisted of cigarettes and Jack Daniels, sometimes beer. It was no longer his home, home was someplace you felt safe and that was not his childhood house in Lawrence Kansas.
His heart began to race after he sent it, immediately wishing he could delete it. He turned his attention away from his phone and towards Benny who was scribbling something in his notebook. After a hand was placed on Benny’s he stopped and looked at Dean. Dean pocketed his phone and took advantage of their shared table in the back of the room. Because Dean arrived early he got the best seats for them. It did not matter where they sat, just that they kept the same lab partners.
They took the 20 minute drive into town away from “rich people territory” as Dean liked to call it. The McMansion that the MacLeod’s owned was on the outskirts of the suburbs, Dean lived closer to the inner town in a much smaller neighborhood, and the diner was in downtown Lawrence.
Once his red-headed friend finished yelling to her mom about what kind of pizza they were getting she found Dean in the kitchen getting plates and a tray for her mom.
Charlie beat him there and saved him a seat. Class went by too quickly and all Dean managed was a few shaky scribbles and outlines. His leg was shaking non-stop, and his mind was racing about all the ways his conversion could go with his history teacher. The final bell rang too soon, but he slowly packed his bag and talked to Charlie about what time he could come over her house to study for the upcoming test they had in Math.
He laughed and saved their numbers in his phone. He had almost completely forgotten how long of a day he had, but then those texts took him right back to when he was crying in his teacher’s arms. /It’s almost 8, it’s almost 8, it’s almost 8/. Dean kept repeating to himself, he couldn’t wait to go pick up Sam, his bed sounded /so/ good right now.
“What took you so damn long?” John was strangely calm. Dean flinched at this unfamiliar polite tone. That usually meant that things were not going to go well for him.
“How long have you and Ms. Masters been friends?” He asked casually in an attempt to make conversation.
Castiel looked at him while fixing his tie. The younger boy was ready to run, but he needed to hear the words ‘I’m okay’ which followed quickly. “I’m okay, I’ll be alright. Just refrain from running so quickly in the hallway next time.” There was a small smile on his lips that reached his bright blue eyes.
“I know you are that’s why I didn’t want to come here, but I think I can trust you. I really want to and I just need someone to be on my side, please” Dean cut him off and started begging. His voice was cracking and he was holding back tears.
What did he reach out to touch his face? Because he wanted to. The action was pure instinct. Dean always made sure that other people were okay before he gave a second thought to himself.
“Charlie you don’t know what this means, if Novak finds out what John has done, he is legally obligated to report it to the school and that means that Sam and I would go into foster care. I just have to hold on until next year, and I can legally become Sam’s guardian. Charlie it’s just one more year I’ve been dealing with this my whole life.” Dean’s voice cracked and his eyes watered.
Dean knew he wasn’t going to let this go so he stood up and started to unbutton the shirt. “Can’t you, like, get in trouble for something like this?” Dean questioned but his hands kept moving.
Dean looked at the clock over the kitchen sink, it read 6:50. He had an hour before he had to go over to The Road House. The sink was lined with beer bottles, so he pulled out the recycling bin and started piling them in. He loaded the dishwasher and ran it before grabbing himself a coke out of the fridge and sitting down on the couch. He looked around the room looking for any sign of Sam. Flipping through the channels until he landed on a guilty pleasure, Dr. Sexy. Sam always made fun of him for watching it, but it was just so damn good.
The two men pondered for a minute. “We’ll have mozzarella sticks, aaaaand nachos please, make sure there’s extra sour cream please.” Castiel piped up.
Dean stumbled out of the small bathroom stall on the third floor of Lawrence High School, honestly a little more than buzzed from the whiskey sloshing around in his water bottle. It wasn’t his proudest moment, but he made it back to class and thought he was concealing it pretty well, aside from Charlie’s nudge and whisper “I can
“Heyyyy, maybe it's just because he thinks you’re cute” Charlie joked, in a feeble attempt to get her friend to smile, with no such luck
He stopped at Mr. Novak’s desk and waited until no one was in the classroom before he started to speak. “M-mister Novak” he stuttered, getting his attention from the chalk board.
There is a self love scene at the end, its long, but I worked really hard on it (female writing a gay man's pleasure of himself)
Dean always hated science, most of the time it made him queasy, not to mention the classroom was all the way across the school and up three flights of stairs. He rushed there through students congregating with their friends in the hallway, and made it just in time for the bell. Immediately inside he saw his friend - honestly he didn’t know what they were - Benny, who laughed and pulled out a chair next to him. Throwing his bag down he sat next to Benny who laughed again and put his hand on Dean’s thigh - Dean really didn’t know what to classify Benny as, a friend? boyfriend? friends with benefits? They were definitely something.
They sat there in silence for a little while, both of them lost in thought. Dorothy came back with their drinks, interrupting them. She smiled at them and said something about their food that Dean didn’t really hear, too focused on his thoughts. He happened to be thinking about school and homework and what he had to get done before tomorrow. Lisa was looking out the window of their booth at the cars passing on the road, she was clearly lost in thought as well. Once Dean came to he looked at her for a few seconds. Her eyebrow was furrowed how it always was when she was thinking.
Thanksgiving hit them quickly. The brothers stuffed themselves to the brim with turkey, potatoes, and pie. There was an obvious reason why fall was Dean’s favorite season. Once dinner and desert was all cleaned up Sam and Dean politely excused themselves and headed home to watch whatever was on TV. They flipped through channels until they found “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving” on one of them. It was a dumb tradition that Dean remembered starting with Mary, but he liked to keep it alive for Sammy.
Castiel sang the rest of the song quietly. His lips shiver with unsaid emotions.  Castiel cried. And cried. Until most of Dean's family had left the gravesite. His eyes turned red by it. As the blood had been when Dean explained how he found Sam dead.
"He is waking up," a male voice remarked. For some reason, his body refused to let him open his eyes to see who was talking. It continued as if Dean's struggling was nothing. "I am warning you, Father. You got still an opportunity to stop the war now before innocents die. Listen to me and let Dean became what he always was supposed to be, an Archangel under you."
Sam raised an eyebrow. His hand touched his skin where the tissue still was visible. The pain seemed glued into his veins and he fought to stay awake. Or else a lower demon would heal him to start torturing him. Again. He bit his lip. This was a weird day. Something out of routine, he knew.
He knew he was lucky; Dean wasn't known for sharing his personal mobile number. Castiel thanked God that he hadn't managed to blow his cover.
Sam rolled his eyes, the itch to kill was there under his fingertips but he refused to do so. Instead, he wanted to know why Crowley had called him in the first place. "You know, I fixed the problem. I got Castiel on the end of your deal. And you lay off my brother or else..." Sam let the unsaid threat hang in the air for a few seconds before he continued. "Anyway, you clearly need me more than I need you. Here is the deal," Sam took a deep breath.
Dean slowly moved his head so he stared into Father's eyes. It took two seconds for him to compute what Father had said yet his brain didn't let him show any signs of understanding. He shook his head and started to open his mouth. "Sure, what is it?"
Haziel had been gone for six hours before he returned to them. Anna's lips were pressed into a thin line by what he told her. Now, Haziel would be the second to hear. Anna crossed her arms over her chest. "You are leaving all of this? Angels everywhere stand by your side and you want to go?" She asked.
All this time after learning how to use his powers, his thoughts were set for one person in particular; Dean. His heart twisted in his chest. "Yes," Castiel responded, he nodded to Sam.
Sam curled his fists together underneath the table and bit back his sarcastic remark at the tip of his tongue. "It's a case," Sam muttered through grit teeth. He stared at his hurting hands that were on the brink to draw blood.
He held a weird looking sword in his right hand, already dripping blood from its victims down to the floor. Sam's face was different from before, his eyes black and more confident than when Castiel last saw the brother alive. "Sam?"
Castiel pushed Dean away quicker than he believed he was able to do. "We do not talk about this topic in God's house, Dean," Castiel glanced around to see if anyone had seen them. His body relaxed once he saw there were none.
"Sure, yet I can't stop the deaths. Or protect them in any way," Sam sighed. "I did. In this line of work is between life and death," Sam shrugged. they left the scene but not before they called the cop about the death scene.
Dean shrugged the thought off. He settled behind a huge, thick tree as his eyes followed their movements. Castiel nodded to Anna before they started to walk just outside the tree line where Dean was.
He tugged his trench coat closer to his chest covering the two-piece suit he used for work. Castiel walked over to the bar and knocked. Nobody opened so he decided to take matters into his own hands and pushed open the door. He heard the music clearly now.
hair Dean concluded while his smile broadened. Cas stared at him for a few seconds. "Hello Dean," Cas answered in his low voice.
"The music industry isn't known to be welcoming to gays and has again and again destroyed careers for musicians that identify themselves as such. Are you aware of the reputation you are giving your..." Jenna stopped and turned a page in her notebook. "Lover?" Jenna finished.
"Good evening Kansas!" Dean welcomed the audience. He could see the white flashing from phones and waves of gluing sticks as far his eyes could see. The scream was muffled out by his earbuds so he didn't become deaf. "I can't hear you, how are you Kansas?"
"That's all?" Dean huffed as he turned away. "No, 'I am sorry I fucked you and trapped you in the bed for days'?" Dean continued, amusement laced itself into his tone. Dean shrugged. "That's okay for me, I am just a weapon anyway." Dean's breath got caught in his throat when Cas invaded his personal space. His skin started to prickle, his heart speed up and he became very aware of how close Cas stood.
"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, it's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder."
"They are a decoy, you know when Crowley tries to hunt me." Sam patted his back before they left the place.
Sam's brown flannel shirt was full of blood, his blue jeans had mud from the ground. Inside his chest, the heart broke into two, he struggled to not start to cry. His lips shivered as he walked over to his brother. Kneeled on the floor beside him and took Sam's body in a bear hug. "Sammy, you are going to be all right. I got you. Sam?" He tucked his nose into Sam's neck, he breathes slowly in. No response, tears trickled down his cheeks.
"Then we can begin in your case, are we going to research for the hunters or the murders?" Balthazar continued as Sam had never said anything. Sam introduced Balthazar to the little thing he managed to figure out on his own. When Sam finished telling, the sun was setting outside.
He squinted his eyes against a blaze of lights from the cameras after Dean's question. People raised their hands as fast as the seconds could pass. He gave Dean a worried glance but Dean kept looking straight ahead with an unreadable face. Dean pointed towards a young lady that wore jeans a short overcoat and a black tie. She had her platinum blonde hair in a ponytail.
"Pulling a kamikaze," Dean said under his breath. He let himself be guided by his emotions. His other hand took Cas's tie until they were inches apart. Dean saw it as a victory by how aroused Cas became by that action alone. Dean raised his eyebrow and smirked. "Such a shame, man," Dean lowered his tone. Dark. Sexy. Just how girls wanted it sometimes.
Anna opened her mouth to respond but Haziel had returned. Castiel quickly noticed he had a bulge in his clothes but chose not to comment on it. He nodded in acknowledgment instead. "Haziel."
The woman sat beside the person he knew was named Castiel. Dean studied her for a short moment. Her red straight hair caught his attention first then her grey-blue eyes. "Who are you?" She asked him.
"Sam, the only monster here is you," Raphael extended his arm, Sam smashed into a tree. Stars appeared behind his eyelids, pain burned like fire up his back. Cut. Needled. The yells continued around, as well as the fighting exalted in pressure. The words carved themselves into his heart.
"Our true form can be difficult to see for a human, therefore we use vessels instead," Anna informed him like it was their usual tea talk.
He pressed send and fixed up his desk, he followed Dean to the other section of the house. Every second he had with Dean, he enjoyed it to its fullest, in Hell he might not be so lucky. "Sam, I know what you are thinking, stop."
He didn't expect to be back in hell so soon. Lucifer poked around on papers, some he frowned upon and others he threw into a bin. Crowley sat at his throne while he got through his normal cases. Crowley lifted off the demons in suits as they disappeared from his sight. Sam grinned wider. The Blade tight in his palm.
"Because I want to return to my lover, Dean Winchester. He might not believe in me now but he will. I have faith in him. Doing this?" Castiel gestured at her with her hand. His face twisted into pain. His jaw clenched. "Is not me and never will be. I already know Haziel is hiding something from us both, however, I think he has good reasons for it. And this war? I don't want to be in it."
"Bobby," Dean said in a pleading voice. "You are the only father I grew up with that took care of me and Sam. You helped dad out with his shop and showed me how to work an instrument," Dean frowned.
Dean parked the '67 Impala neatly between two cars and patted the car. "See you soon Baby," Dean locked the car and entered the bar. He found Cas at his usual place, in front of the counter talking with the bartender. His sky blue eyes held their normal clearness and Cas rapidly gestured his hands in the air. Dean didn't waste any time, his feet moved him beside Cas before he could think further.
Questions evolved into a loud throb in his skull. The halls were lit up in white light bulbs over his head. Angels avoided looking straight into Dean's eyes, others (higher-ranking ones that were) greeted him. On the third floor, they had spare clothes where Dean was heading. The suit irked him to no end at this point.
Castiel sighed. "It's the best choice, Father got the archangels and unknown allies, we got to be careful who we trust. And I trust Sam."
"I want you to remember this," Dean whispered close to his ear, unwillingly his shoulders tensed. When Dean took his hand back he wanted nothing more than to take it back. He glanced at Dean when he thought when Dean didn't see. For a while, they drove in silence before they arrived.
The angel's head snapped up interested. Her blue eyes reminded him of Castiel. They were after all related to Sam's prior research in hell about angels and demons. Like always, the information came in handy. He decided to describe more of his point. Some angels did really not understand subtlety. "They want my power for their own gains. But I never actually planned anything like this," Sam gestured with his hand. The lie was easy on his lips.
Sam woke up with keyboard marks on half of his face. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. A few papers fell to the ground. Sam leaned back in his chair, his eyes were drawn to the bright day outside his window. Leaves were falling down to the ground in slow movements. Sam sighed before he turned back to his laptop. He found his next place to be and a restaurant. Content Sam left the room.
He blinked surprised to Anna before he folded his arms on the desk. His heartbeat rapidly in his ribcage and he focused on calming down. "I am sorry, I didn't get that."
Thoughts raced through his mind to get his attention. He ruffled a hand through his hair while he sighed. A bang of hurt flashed in his eyes he gripped tightly around the wooden bench in front of him.
"What?" Sam's voice raised in surprise. Dean pointed with his finger to the bowl he had in his hands. "Oh," Sam gave the bowl to Dean.
"Different? We are just starting. You are not yet a Knight of Hell, that would be too easy. No, I will be sending you to the racks."
"Cas?" Dean asked as he moved quickly forward. The second their eyes locked Anna's eyes seemed to lit a few degrees lighter blue however it was gone.
Castiel thought. It flashed white. He covered his face with his left hand. The lighting seemed aimed at his car. He barely avoided one by turning drastically to the opposite side.
Dean flew away as quick he could. What he least expected was to see his ...friend. Sam smiled at him. His Blade bloody from the dead bodies, humans actually. Dean's mouth opened in shock. What the hell was wrong with this guy? "Sam?"
"Dean," he merely managed to say before his brain decided to shut off when Dean kissed him on the lips. Desperation is unsaid in every move. His dick twitched in his boxers. Dean would be the death of him. Castiel finally convinced himself to push Dean away before he decided to fuck him senseless right there and then. "Damn it, Dean," panic slipped into his voice.
he heard the sound of plates being collected loudly. He winced before he thought for a while how to answer her question. The air began to pour into his lungs. How Dean's green eyes changed color when a faint ray of light meet his. Like the world turned into life once again, how he tried, oh, how he insisted on helping.
Sam turned to the television Cas had taken on a few minutes earlier. Obviously, it was already spreading. Just as his days were coming to an end. And Dean didn't know, he would never have any idea. It was better that way. Before in the day, he contacted Bobby and he kept telling there he couldn't be saved.
"Next week, I am gonna help Bobby out at opening this bar. I will be busy with stuff, you know interviews." Dean shrugged.
Stuff didn't make sense, just a little earlier he had been on his way home. Now he was literally home. But he knew for sure he visited Dean Winchester, his hands could still be felt on his skin. How could he explain the weird car encounter to anyone? They would conclude he was crazy.
His vision cleared and he groaned. Bobby was leaning against the wall a few centimeters away from his face. The jarring pain was gone. Sam blinked in confusion, the blood stuck to his hands from his clothes. His head hit the wall and he sighed. It took him a few more seconds to realize Castiel wasn't in the room and Bobby hadn't woken up. Probably some angel mojo involved. Immediately his thoughts went to Dean.
After a while, they let him leave, he pushed away from the insisting journalists that jabbed their microphones into his face while asking questions he didn't want to answer. "What happened?" A question was fired in his direction as Dean pushed a woman to the side to advance to the car.
As always, the producer used him to get Dean to work on schedule, nothing new there. Camilla wanted them to jam together. Sam tasted down his answers and sent them before he changed his mind. It was then he heard loud knocking on the front door.
“Cas, two creamers and three sugars. Dean, you seemed like the type to drink it black, but here’s two creams just in case” she threw them down on the desk he was standing at.
Dean grabbed his lube and a vibrating dildo out of his bedside drawer. He left his dick unattended to drip pre-cum on his stomach, getting tangled in his happy trail. Dean liked to keep himself clean, he even routinely had his ass waxed. He was always one for manscaping too. Since his first time disaster story in which his partner ended up spitting out his curly hair, he learned his lesson.
They pulled up and Dean put the car in park but neither of them made a move to get out of the car. She took her hand out of his and placed it on his face. She rubbed her thumb across the stubble that was a few days old. He closed his eyes and took deep breaths and finally placed his hand over hers. He brought her palm to his lips and kissed it gently. The look in her eyes when he finally opened his eyes let him know that she was okay, she had forgiven him.
The Roadhouse was thankfully only 15 minutes away from their house. He was bartending tonight, because Ellen, the owner, had been training him since he was fifteen years old and screw any law that said he couldn’t handle alcohol. Dean had always known Ellen, since he was about six years old, when John took the boys to bars because he couldn’t leave them at home yet. Ellen’s daughter, Jo, and Dean would fight like brother and sister when they were younger, but as they grew up together they just became family. Jo was two years younger than Dean, but was fiery as a pistol. She was one of the toughest people Dean knew, maybe he just had a thing for having powerful women in his life.
That makes it click for Castiel; Dean is just a child. He displays himself as this big bad football player, but he’s just a goofy kid who loves his brother. Clearly forced to grow up too fast, Castiel remembers seeing a form saying that his mother died when he was young. His student obviously feels the need to protect his younger brother from everything that might hurt him, especially their father.
Castiel chuckled and replied softly, “Anything you want Dean. I just want to be here for you.” With those words out in the open Dean visibly relaxed.
“Yes Dee, I think I might have Jessica come over.” Sam slipped in her name quietly, hoping Dean would not notice. He did, but he let it slide.
Both men were silent for a little too long and just kind of looked at Dean in awe or terror, either way, Dean was working. He walked over to one of the other tables he was supposed to be taking care of, every so often looking over his shoulder to the booth in the corner. They were laughing and smiling and Dean was working hard.
Dean’s head snapped in her direction. “Yeah. I’ll be right over.” He turned back to Castiel to see he was already gone.His heart hurt for a millisecond that Dean would not even admit to himself. He turned to Jo and helped her make the last round of drinks. At the very end of the night after the lights were off and the door was about to be locked Dean took three shots. One tequila, one fireball, and one Jameson. He sprayed the soda gun right in his mouth as a chaser. Jo scolded him but he just laughed his ass off all the way to the car.
Sam was very pleased with his breakfast. Dean would definitely be making trips to the city more often, to flirt a little, but mostly for the coffee.
“Oh, that’s cool, I wanted to be a teacher when I was really young, but now I’m looking into mechanics. I work at Singer’s Auto Shop on West Main Street.” Dean was attempting to distract his teacher from the topic at hand.
“Ugh, I’m starving.” He said scratching the back of his neck. The car door swung open and it surprised Lisa, she jumped and laughed at herself. Dean walked around quickly to get the door for her.
“Dean that would be highly inappropriate.” Castiel responded, but his voice dropped at least an octave, signaling to Dean he had considered what that would be like.
The bell rang after Cas had given them the chance to start the reading for tomorrow. Some obscure articles on the development of parliament in Europe Dean noted. He had taken AP World History as a sophomore so he had a little depth to his knowledge of Europe’s history. Thank goodness they did most of their work in class, he liked teachers that did not assign much homework.
“Well ya have absolutely nothing to apologize for. I can even delete your phone number if you want?” Dean said to calm him down.
The week after the arcade went off without a hitch. Sam and Dean fell into a sort of routine. Sam would go from school to practice then home. Dean would go from school to practice and then to work. Monday was his lucky day and he was glad he made the most of it.
“Well, I think that got everyone’s attention, that was scientifically one of the worst sounds to the human ear, often equated with a scream or a baby crying. Can anyone tell me the different types of sound waves?”
Dean all but ran out of the room and down the stairs to his next class. Charlie was waiting at their table while everyone else was at their cooking stations.
“I’m sorry for crying, I’m not usually like this.” He said between sniffles. He grabbed a tissue off the teacher’s desk to blow his nose which made the other man laugh.
“That place looked like fun! You got enough money?” Sam sounded genuinely concerned, obviously he knew about their issues.
“Any volunteers for presentations today? If not I have a video on the inner workings and functionalities of the frontal love for you guys to watch.” Mrs. MacLeod’s voice rang through the classroom and she winced at her own volume. When no one proved willing to present she set up the projector and put her head on her desk for the rest of the period. There may have been a few people paying attention, but Dean was not one of them. He went back to his phone and opened a text.
When his teacher said that he was on his side he couldn’t help but feel different, like he finally had someone who understood and didn’t judge. Someone who he could really trust and talk to on a regular basis, almost like he had a new friend. It would take a while, but Dean knew this was the start of something important. Dean often found that Cas would look at him behind the bar. He wasn’t sure if it was because he was worried or something else, but he just kept bringing them drinks anyway.
The sight alone was enough for Dean to come into the sheets that were not his and not even care. A few seconds passed before either of them said anything. “That was amazing,” one of them sighed, blending together with all the sounds around them. They laid there with Dean’s head on Benny’s thigh and said nothing for a long time.
While Cas was objectively attractive, Dean had always focused on people his own age. Dean decided right there that he would have to get to know this guy before he put both of their positions on the line. His teacher proved to have a good heart and was very trustworthy from everything that he had discovered on Friday. Dean usually blamed his bruises on football, but somehow Castiel saw right through that, how did he see through that?
Benny smirked as he slowly pulled off both of their boxers, watching Dean glance at anything except for this boy’s eyes. Teasingly, the southern born boy spread apart Dean’s legs and sucked on the tall prize before him.
“Can I come over?” Dean’s voice was barely above a whisper. His voice was shaking and tears kept rolling down his face.
The rest of the class was roughly the same: Dean zoning in and out, Charlie pushing him back to reality. In the beginning of class he worked himself up to a boner, so he readjusted and focused on making it go away. The brunette could not help but wonder why his teacher and why now?
Dean was too busy finishing off the salad Sam left to answer. He opted to grab the keys and shrug while chewing. “I was thinking that arcade in town?”
LMK how y'all liked it, I worked soooo hard on it 😘 This chapter actually took a really long time haha.
At around 3:45 Benny had followed Dean into the bathroom and locked the door behind them. He immediately made a move on Dean and started kissing him. There was no response at first but Dean eventually gave in. Benny was kissing him with need and lust. It was all tongue and teeth, until he moved away from Dean’s mouth and down to his neck which made Dean forget that he was at work.
Dean grabbed his phone to check the time and it read 5:15am. Benny was still asleep beside him. In order to avoid waking him up Dean snuck out of the room and put his clothes on, no one seemed to be awake yet until he reached the kitchen. Lisa was in there making coffee and cleaning up because she’s just that good of a person.
“Yes please, more drinks, Dean. Keep them coming until you leave.” Castiel cut into whatever Gabe’s drunken head was going to say.
“Pfft, you think I don’t know that your Dungeons and Dragons group meets every Saturday? Don’t even try me with that Charlie. Plus you hate parties, no one is weird enough for you.” Dean smiled, satisfied with himself.
After bowling the brothers moved onto roaming the arcade. They played a few games for the tickets, and proceeded to choose the ones that both of them could play. Dean was actually good at Air-Hockey — even though Sam was giving it his all. On their third round Sam won, Dean swore it was only because he got distracted by someone he thought he recognized. Sam decided to quit while he was on his high.
Dean sighed in relief and walked back into the garage to finish up his work on the last car of the night. The belt was basically torn to shreds. After an hour or so the clock finally hit 9pm and he cleaned up his station, wiped any and all grease he could see off his body.
“I am most definitely NOT jealous of you” she snapped back a little louder than she meant to. Their history teacher, Mr. Novak, overheard this, and a few other students looked along as he walked over to the wild redhead. His blue tie made his eyes pop and the slacks he was wearing shaped him perfectly and he knew it.
“I think you’re right” he laughed along with his brother. Sam joined back in and they just laughed at the whole demeanor of their father. This was a first for them, they hadn’t laughed like this in a long time, especially Dean.
“For good luck. C’mon Charles.” Dean pleaded. She gave in and they soon were spinning around like idiots in the hallway.
He hopped in the car and headed to work. To his surprise it was very busy when he got there. He jumped right in behind the bar, because tonight Ellen couldn’t come in: she had a date which she refused to talk about with Dean or Jo. He quickly scanned the large dining room for John, thankfully he came up blank. After throwing on his “Roadhouse” shirt he was already making drinks.
“Hell yeah I’m sure, you didn’t do anything wrong. I’m definitely keeping your brother’s number, how old is he?”
“I’m on your side Dean, but I have to do something,” Cas trailed off walking over to the young man who had started crying. He placed his hands gently on Dean’s shoulders and repeated “I am on your side Dean, it’s okay.”
“Yeah, that would be nice.” She grabbed the pizza boxes off of the table and Dean grabbed the tray and plates he had set out earlier. She smiled at him and walked up stairs with him in toe.
“Oh it’s breakfast now? Here I was thinking it was just coffee.” She laughed at him and he smiled back. The kind of smile that made his eye’s crinkle. The smile that Lisa always managed to bring out of him.
Charlie was waiting for him by the door to Ms. Masters’ classroom. She was holding something that Dean could not quite make out. She quickly jutted her hand out and gave him an answer to the unspoken question.
“No, Lisa, you don’t want this, I’m a mess, plus there’s Benny now, and I just, I need to make it to January and then I should have enough saved up for an apartment.” Dean let out a big breath.
Mrs. MacLeod - or ‘evil ginger bitch’ as Dean preferred - started the class by scratching her long, neon acrylics on the chalkboard. Half the class moaned and the other half moaned and covered their ears. At least Benny took his hand off of Dean’s thigh.
“Oh, I can see where you might have thought that. Next time just be home as soon as you wake up. Where’s that little brother of yours?” John smiled at Dean.
Around 1 in the morning is when Dean heard the front door slam open. An obviously drunk John stumbled into the living room where Dean was sitting. Sam had retired to bed a few hours ago, but Dean flicked the channel to Dr. Sexy and lost track of time.
“I won’t get in trouble if I’m right about this.” He watched as Dean was finishing unbuttoning his shirt.
“Take the car and hurry up.” John gained his composure again. When Dean pulled away he saw John pull out a cigarette.
“Wow, that sucks, I’m kind of glad I graduated high school in the spring, it just sucked, all the drama and everything. At least our school is diverse in sexuality, nobody really cares right?”
?!” Dean joked, he was not sure if the teacher would pick up on the fact that he was the reason that he was so unfocused in history class.
“Yeah, I’ll just need an address, I get off of work at 8am, let me know what time you want to get picked up because if I can I’ll go home to get some sleep for a little.”
“I have at least a few more hours here, why?” Sam asked on the other end a little bit concerned if he was being honest.
Dean then hopped on his bike and peeled out of the parking lot. He ran into some traffic on the way through town, but it was nothing major. He got there at 8:45. He called Sam, but he must have heard the roar of the bikes engine. He came out with an annoyed look on his face. Dean took the keys out.
“Let’s go,” She blushed slightly and slapped him in the arm. She grabbed a sweater that was thrown over the back of one of the chairs at the island in the enormous kitchen they were standing in. He followed her out the door grabbing her hand as she led them to his car. Baby, who she knew a little too well was the same as she would have remembered, including the same cassette tapes.
After what felt like mere minutes the bell rang. Charlie was waiting for him outside their math classroom when he got there.
Dean did not see his younger brother until Tuesday morning when he grabbed toast before heading to the bus. The older brother almost did not go to school himself, but he promised Cas that he would be there and he would be alert. He grabbed a coffee and an apple as a kind of joke to bring. He drank the coffee before fourth period and the apple was shining red in his hand as he brought it in before anyone else got there.
“You were scared to talk to me? That’s funny, I was always nervous to initiate a conversation because you had to train me when I got here.” They laughed together for a little bit after that.
“Dean’s smile faded quickly before he responded.” Actually, no. He’s been pretty good lately. Sam and I are out of the house most of the time to avoid that sort of this happening. The scars are fading too. I have Sam put the medicine on them all the time. I think I’m old enough now that he will just punch and kick me, anything more is too much effort.” Dean vented, looking at anything but Bobby as he spoke. “At least he doesn’t smoke in the house anymore though.” Dean tried his best to play it off, holding his upper arm.
“Not even man ‘nuff to tell the truth, fuckin’ faggot.” John kicked Dean again. The younger boy could not move, he laid there and let his father kick him too hard. The expletives and accusations kept flowing out of the drunk man’s mouth. All Dean had to do was wait until John got bored or tired, which usually did not take long.
Dean imagined himself walking up to the front of the class and pushing Cas down in his chair. With the rest of the class gone he would unbutton his shirt slowly, but leave it and the tie on him, just loose. The younger boy was on his knees working on getting his tight dress pants off.
“Of course baby,” She responded smiling warmly at her daughter. Dean smiled and waved as he poked his head out from behind Charlie. “I swear you get taller every time I see you.”
Once they calmed down Dean rubbed away a tear before it fell from his eye. He took her hand again and she looked at him ever so innocent. “You are amazing.” He sighed at her, tucking her hair behind her ear. “You are beautiful, no, you’re gorgeous.” He said running his thumb across her rosy cheeks. “You deserve the best, better than me, better than anyone in this town.” She looked up at him with wide eyes.
The dominant boy twisted Dean’s nipples and received a gasp in return. "From now on, I want you to tell me when you’re about to come. Am I clear?”
“What if we meet once a week after school to talk? Fridays maybe?” Castiel suggested while rubbing his hands across the younger boy’s thumbs.
“Dean, you have been so obviously slacking in my class. I don’t know if it is because of this newly established friendly relationship, but it has to stop.” Castiel sighed. “Is there any specific reason you have been zoning out so often?”
They sat down and started with the Calculus section of their practice packet, cross checking answers every so often. After a while Dean’s mind started to wander to Sam, then to Cas, then to his father. His dad wasn’t always this way, he barely remembered life before his mom died; but, he knew they were happy. He knew his dad was definitely not a raging alcoholic when Mary was still alive. When Dean was young John had told him stories about how he was raised as an army brat always moving around. His parents always wanted him to be in the Navy, ‘carry on the family tradition,’ even if that’s not what John had wanted. Since John was discharged he and Mary promised to be different and love their children and support them unconditionally, which was derailed by Mary’s death. After Dean’s mom passed in the fire, it was as if all the pent up rage, pain, and trauma caught up to him. Dean couldn’t recall the last time that his dad was sober, but he couldn’t blame him, he was in pain, his wife died, he had PTSD.
“Yes I am! I’m Dean and I’ll be your server tonight.” He snapped back into it and he smiled. “What can I get you two gentlemen tonight? Starting with drinks and appetizers? Just drinks?”
The younger boy sat unmoving at his desk shaking his head back to life. “I’m sorry.” He did not meet the teacher’s eyes.
After finding a comfortable pace — pumping his cock — he started to move the dildo in and out. The silicone was curved to hit his prostate every time, so he knew he was not going to last much longer. He started to pick up the pace as he felt the heat rising in his stomach. Soon enough he could not handle anymore, he came, the name ‘
Before he could ask another question their food came over. They both thanked Dorothy and went right to eating. The waffle was so good that Dean all but moaned when he bit into it. Balanced perfectly with whipped cream and strawberries, no syrup needed. He moved to the bacon after to balance the sweet with the salty. Lisa looked at him and laughed.
“Dean, I know the drill, I’m probably going to end up sleeping over at my friend Alfie’s house. Will you pick me up tomorrow after work?”
“I feel that, I have to pick up my little brother from a sleepover and then I’m headed straight to my bed for sure.” Dean laughed.
“Either way, I think you need to reevaluate your position in my class. It is an AP and I would hate to see any of my students lose interest.”
By the end of class Dean had a pretty good sketch of what he was aiming for. He had not thought about his phone until Ms. Masters told them to pack up. He pulled his phone out to read the text.
“I’ll have a Western Omelette with spinach and broccoli instead of onions please. If you can do that, if not that’s okay.” Lisa was oddly nervous. Dean thought it was very cute but knew he still couldn’t do anything about it.
Every time he went over there to refill their drinks they got a little more forward. Gabe would say some flirtatious comment and Castiel would immediately shut him down. Every time Dean thought his teacher’s name he became more comfortable with it, so much so he started calling him Cas in his head. Since he heard Ms. Masters say it to him so casually he couldn’t help but like it too. Cas was harsh to his brother, it was sweet, almost like he was protecting Dean. Dean didn’t need to be protected, but he came off that way after school, breaking down and everything.
“Uh, I have some homework and then I was going to watch a movie or something, maybe have a friend pick me up?”
“You have a little something” Lisa laughed even harder as he tried to lick the wrong cheek. He started laughing too.
“Thank you.” Dean’s voice still had not returned to its normal state. He grabbed the keys from where he left them and went out to the car. There was rain lightly falling down on his shoulders, wetting his hair, but he could not care less. He focused on the breathing and the voice at the other end of the phone
At least the fantasies were getting more creative, Dean was learning that he was a kind of kinky guy. One of his favorite, most recurring day-dreams was sucking Castiel’s cock under his desk while class was going on and he had to keep a straight face.
She had really pretty hazel eyes, he noticed when she blushed and laughed nervously. “I was always afraid to talk to you. You seemed like this big scary guy, but I see now that you’re just as normal as the rest of us.”
“Hmm, nah tha drunk, still know I wan’ ya” Benny barely got the words out before going back to kissing Dean and pushing him up on the sink.
After four or five episodes, Dean made Sam go to bed because they had school tomorrow. Sam seemed annoyed, but he didn't argue. Dean stayed downstairs to straighten up the living room and the kitchen. He smiled at his work, then headed upstairs.
