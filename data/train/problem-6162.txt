and such a coupley thing to do that Tony doesn't know what to make of it. Steve looks delighted though, scooting closer to Tony across the seat and lacing their fingers together between them. Tony stares at their joined hands as if they hold all the secrets of the universe. It feels almost surreal that those fingers had been in his mouth not so long ago. Tony licks his lips.
SHIELD is bustling with activity when they get there. Agents run this way and that, whispering to each other and looking through files in little groups. The whole setup reminds Tony of an ant colony. He supposes that would make Fury the queen. Tony shakes his head, ant queen Nick Fury is not a thought he wants pinging around in his brain. Ever. No matter how cute Disney tried to make the ant queen in A Bug's Life-and thank you very much Steve for reminding him of the existence of that movie-no matter how cute that was, real natural biology is rarely so adorable, in insects, at any rate. He's getting side tracked though, their guide through SHIELD's maze-like bowels is still talking, and Tony has heard all of it, but it doesn't seem all that interesting. Especially with Steve standing directly to his left like a sentinel. Natasha is at his right; the others fanning out behind him in a show of support so imposing that he swears he's seen a few agents backflip into side rooms to get out of the way.
Iron man sits with him until Steve finally gets up to walk around the ship. It's all sleek lines and symmetry. Recessed glass panels with strange glowing lights dot the halls. Iron man informs him that they're maintenance and electrical information relays. A one stop shop to run diagnostics or to see if there has been a hull breach. It really feels more like a spaceship than any submersible Steve has ever been in. As terrifying as his new reality is, Steve grew up loving science fiction. The cities of tomorrow loom large in his memory, but even those imaginings have nothing on this ship-or on the high tech battle suit encasing Iron Man.
“Well, wouldn't want to break a promise.” He says, setting about peeling his pants downwards. Tony wheezes a little at the sight of hot rod red lace peeking out from the waistband of his pants.
“So good, oh, so good, cupcake,” Tony all but croons to him, reaching up, curving his hand around the back of Steve's neck to pull him into a hot demanding kiss. He throws a hand out to keep his balance, fisting a hand in the pillows Tony is resting his head upon, but he keeps moving, kissing Tony and making love to him with his body, and his mouth, and everything he has. Something must have changed in the angle though because Tony groans low in his throat, he scrapes his fingernails down Steve's back, and then he's grabbing two handfuls of Steve's rear, urging him to thrust harder, breathing out praise and endearments and encouragement into Steve's ears. He can feel Tony's hard cock against his stomach, pressed now between them, wet and messy and getting precome all over them both.
“I thought erroneously that the two of you were engaged in an affair, but the Captain tells me that is incorrect. I was merely expressing my sympathies that such a talented and beautiful man has slipped through his meaty incapable fingers.”
“We're not together. Romantically.”
“Tones, we have
“So nosy.” Natasha rolls her eyes, but there's a slight smile on her face so Tony doesn't feel too bad about it. “We were talking about aphrodisiacs, pheromones, that sort of thing, and it's not just villains though Cap, you never know if some extra-dimensional portal is going to open up, or we might run across some undiscovered plant.” She shrugs, shoulders rising and falling easily with the movement.
For the first few days out of the hospital Tony sleeps. He sleeps like he can't remember ever sleeping. Of course he really can't remember much-but his body tells him what his mind can't. He's exhausted, it's a constant thing lurking about the corners of his consciousness. He has a pretty strong suspicion that sleep deprivation is something he has been dealing with for months, maybe even years.
“It's not that big.” He finally mutters, feeling his cheeks burning. Tony turns in his arms so they're face to face, sliding his palms over his chest. One dark brow quirks upwards. Steve feels his doom approaching maybe just a little bit.
“This isn't the best time I know, but I'm kind of afraid you'll run off if I let this settle.”
Tony attempts to move, but Steve just holds him still, watching with rapt attention as Tony chews his lower lip in frustration and stares him down in return. When he finally stills, Steve leans over him again, drawing him into long searching kisses that make them both gasp and pant into each others' mouths. For a moment he thinks Tony is going to ask for more, but he seems content to kiss and be kissed for the time being. They're both still hopelessly aroused-This pair of briefs he's wearing are going to either be tossed or need a thorough washing-but the desire to come has faded to a bearable awareness instead of an all consuming need.
“Well,
that-every morning even. Tony can be astoundingly obtuse sometimes as it turns out.
He hopes Nick is sobbing into his eyepatch.
“No, this isn't-wasn't your fault shellhead. We'll get you back okay, just hold on, we'll find a way.” Steve cuts off Tony's self blaming train of thought decisively, before it can take on a life of its own. Tony is going to be alone with his thoughts a lot, it's not a comforting reality. A Tony left on his own has a habit of thinking all the world's problems are somehow his own doing.
“JARVIS-” Tony sighs “We've been over this, the protocol is not going to kill me.” At least he thinks it won't. There's a very high possibility that he's wrong, but if it comes to that, dying is already a certainty anyway. Last ditch efforts to stay alive are rarely the safest of things.
“So you admit you don’t sleep enough, never thought I’d hear that.”  Everyone said it, and there were coffee makers strewn all over the mansion.  He was pretty sure there was an espresso machine in the foyer off the main entrance.
Last time, he had knelt between Steve's legs in one of his ridiculously expensive silk wool suits that make him look right off the society pages.
“Birthday kisses now, because I love you.” Steve agrees, rolling him back into the pillows and dipping his head to start them off. His body is practically glowing with contentment, and yeah, he'll probably be sore tomorrow, but this is already the best birthday he's had in years.
, for proofreading this chapter and helping me get my shit together.
good”  He says with feeling, not wanting Tony to doubt that, wanting him to know that he's everything.  “So good, Tony, you feel-” He cuts off in a long moan when Tony twists his hips and sinks back down.
He wants to yell, but instead he lets Steve kiss him senseless. Time doesn't seem to flow the same way while they sit there under a streetlamp on a park bench. It's not the most comfortable spot though, even perched atop Steve's lap as he is, and it's starting to get a little chilly. Steve hums, taking his hands and rubbing them between his own broad palms. “Are you cold?” He asks, as if he's not being used as a pillow on a wooden bench. As if Tony's comfort is the only important thing in the world.
“Aw I don’t know, seems pretty homey, especially that big metal contraption you had over there.”  Maybe sass might not have been the right way to approach this, but Dr. Erskine’s gaze sharpened as if he’d said something right.
“I have-” Tony groans, reaching out to grab at Steve's chest “a heart condition, you're going to kill me. Put it on my tombstone: Here lies Tony Stark, murdered by his husband's ridiculous sex appeal and red lingerie.”
“Is something the matter Captain?” Their resident Asgardian sounds far too pleased with himself.  Steve glances up, and Thor winks, sitting back to take a bite of his food, smiling as he chews and looking so damn smug that Steve has to roll his eyes. Tony settles back in next to him, yawning and stealing a hashbrown from Steve's plate.
“I’d really like to learn how to throw a punch without breaking my hand,” Steve blurted out, “Mister Lorenzo.  I’d like to learn how to protect someone better if I needed to.”  He amended, already calculating the extra shift he’d have to take on to pay for the monthly membership.  It would be worth it, if he could learn.
Steve wants to sketch it.
“See me,” He breathes. “please see me,”
He doesn't know how long he holds off, time spools out meaninglessly, all that he can focus on is Tony's voice, the feel of him, the spicy scent of him where his face is pressed. His own breathing sounds loud and wrecked to his ears. Tony is growing louder though, his noises breathier, his body winding tighter and tighter, until finally he curls his fingers in Steve's hair once more, dragging his head up to slant their mouths together in a deep open mouthed kiss. His knees press bruisingly tight against Steve's sides, and then he's crying out, his body clenching and pulsing around Steve's cock, spilling hot and wet between their bodies, striping Steve's stomach; some of it even getting on Steve's chest. It's everything he wanted, Tony's expression blown open and raw with pleasure when Steve pulls back from the kiss to watch him as the last of his orgasm rolls through his body.
“Don’t rain on my parade, this is a dream of mine.”  Tony replied seriously.
“You better believe he still owes me on that.”  She rolled her eyes, but she still looked fond.  She also grabbed Tony’s face and began dabbing at the lipstick smudge.  Tony just stood there docily, his nose wrinkling up when she grabbed a napkin to rub a bit more vigorously.  Steve smiled to himself, scraping food from the pan onto a plate.  He was pretty sure it was a serving plate, but it served its purpose.
“Oh yeah? Because we have your name on a receipt for it, and the credit card records track right back to yous. So you might want to rethink that statement.” Tony says acidly. Behind him Steve shifts, and Hammer's beady little eyes narrow to stare at him.
“I'll go if you think it's a good idea, I trust your judgment shel-sweetheart” He corrects himself instantly, relief sweeping through him when Tony seemingly doesn't catch his telling slip of the tongue.
“Stoppit, I got you, I got you, you don’t have to worry.”  Steve said, aware his voice was shaking, that his eyes were wild and dilated with the rush.  Strange, even with the way his body was singing, he should still have felt an impact, the pressure from being shot, but he felt nothing.  Slowly he raised his head, looking around to see the other cadets had scattered out wide.  General Phillips was standing beside the private with the live rounds, but he was staring at Steve.  Beneath him Waters swore again, raked a hand over his face, and pushed Steve off of himself with trembling hands.  Steve checked him over, patting every part of Waters to make sure he wasn’t bleeding somewhere.
“Tony, I'm gonna put you in your bed now. Don't know how comfortable you'll be though in that suit.” He coaxes.  Tony doesn't respond, merely snuffling closer, tucking himself up tightly against Steve and sighing contentedly.
That earns him a snort of laughter and a glare of mock affront.  “You can't play dumb with me Steven, JARVIS told me you've got the tablet all figured out, and you use the modern equipment in the gym, so don't you give me that golly gee whiz 'what's a paperclip' bull you pull with the talking heads at FOX sometimes.” He sounds offended on Steve's part, and he finds himself smiling wide. It heartens him that Tony can see the truth. Steve may have taken to playing up his ignorance about modern technology when talking to certain members of the press. If they're the same reporters that say nasty things about Tony and the team, well, that's something only he needs to know. Watching some red faced overblown clown try to patiently explain something so low tech Tony could probably make it in his sleep has become a pastime of Steve's. Apparently his cover is blown. He's been made-by JARVIS no less.
“Listen kid, you don’t know who you’re messing with, scram and we’ll forget all about that little insult.”  The taller of the two said.  He was a big burly bruiser with arms as big around as one of Steve’s legs.  The other guy was shorter, but broader in head and body.
“C'mon, movie's about to start. Previews just ended!” Jan chirps from her spot perched on the arm of the larger of the two couches in the room.
Steve stood there, breathing heavily for a moment, and then flipped the shield onto his back, securing it in place. Zemo was surely dead, but there was still the issue of the island crawling with henchmen. Steve sighed, and set about rounding them up and leaving them near the shore wriggling and cursing in flex cuffs, or whatever rope he could find on the island. He hunted down the last one trying to swim for the mainland, hauling the sputtering beta up and tossing his bound form beside his other struggling friends. SHIELD was an easy call to make after all that business was taken care of, they could deal with the henchman better than he could after all. He wasn’t in the business of keeping prisoners.
“Then yeah, yeah I'd like for you to do that. Warmer too if you could please.” The sound and the smell of the heater cutting on answers his request. The lighting changes as well, going from pitch black to the sort of warm tone Steve remembers filtering in through his thin curtains in a ratty little apartment in Brooklyn.  “Thanks JARVIS, that. That helps. Thank you.” After that it's a little easier to fall asleep, and the dreams aren't as cold. He wakes up with the vaguest impressions of dreaming of wide brown eyes, and the smell of mint and expensive cologne, but it's gone before he can truly register it.
“No MRI, absolutely no magnetic imaging.” They're talking more, but their voices fuzz out as he finds a way to roll his strange clothing down to get a good look at the device situated over his sternum. No, not over-
“Oh, this should be good.”  Tony said, he was already standing up, pressing his hand to two points on his left wrist.  Black shining ribbons twisted from that point, encasing his body in a sleek black flightsuit.
“We are under an attack most foul!”  Thor cried, spinning what looked like a massive hammer in his hand and charging from the room.  The others followed him, except for Iron Man, who approached holding the shield.
“Knee up on the desk sweetheart.” Says Steve, tugging Tony's pants down and off at last, curving his palm around the meat of Tony's right thigh to help him do as Steve asked. The action spreads him further open, and Steve can't help dropping down to his knees, kissing up the back of Tony's thighs, digging his teeth in slightly over thick muscle. Tony squirms against the desk, his toes curling against the floor when Steve pulls the plug out and sets it aside, before leaning in to lick a stripe from the clench of his hole, up his crease, following the defined line of his spine in a path of sucking kisses.
New Yorkers hadn’t changed, he realized as he ran through the streets.  There were little bodegas with apartment buildings above them, people playing cards and smoking on building stoops, and when Steve crossed the street at least three cabbies honked at him, the guy walking next to him was engaged in a shouting match with one of the cabbies.  “Ey, ey, I’m walking here, buddy!”  He yelled, there were rude gestures all around.  Steve smiled, at least that was familiar.
Face to face with himself in the mirror he nearly gasps. His hair is an absolute wreck, there's stubble creeping up his neck, and his once pristine suit is completely disheveled. Tony blinks, tugging the unbuttoned collar of his shirt down to reveal the dark bruise right where his shoulder and neck meet. Tony sucks his bottom lip between his teeth, pressing at the mark and shivering with the memory of Steve putting it there.
“Not even a teensy bit naked?” The little moue of pouty sorrow almost makes Steve reconsider, but he kisses Tony instead. Tony allows the kissing for a time, but soon pulls back to look over his face searchingly.
“Do your thing, I'm sure you're much better at it than I was at selling war-bonds.”
“Love, Steve, beloved come on, you're okay, you're okay, breathe, we'll-I'll come up with a different plan okay, something better. Are you back with me?” Tony is practically curled around him. His suit jacket and waistcoat are discarded, the sleeves of his silk shirt rolled up to bare the toned muscles of his forearms. “Yeah, hi, welcome back babe.” Tony says so gently that Steve almost wants to weep.
“Do not besmirch my motherland, Rogers, nor impinge on the honor of my blessed Redsox, amen.”  She said it with such seriousness Steve couldn’t help but keep needling her, especially since it had the tendency to make her laugh.
His ears burned more as he got out the nicest stationary they had.  A smooth cream colored cardstock with an illuminated border of gold and green swirls and swooping birds in vibrant colors.  It had been a present from Sarah on his twelfth birthday, and had surely cost her a pretty penny.  Steve’s hand shook as he poured his heart out onto the page in his neatest calligraphy.  When the letter was finished, he waited for it to dry, and sealed it with wax, tucking the bracelet inside the envelope with the letter.  His heart raced, he just knew his face had to be a glowing shade of scarlet, but he had done it, he’d really written it out, his intentions and his jumbled feelings.
“I'm sorry, and thank you.” He says, wishing he could really be saying this to Iron Man's face and not the expressionless faceplate.
“Mister Stark does not react well to certain stimuli-and today has been trying for his peace of mind.” JARVIS says evenly.  Steve thinks back on Iron Man's injuries. Stark must be worried about his bodyguard. Surely the pair of them are friends?  So many questions he wants to ask but know he has no right to.  The Avengers Charter is clear on trying to browbeat other members, or Mister Stark about secret identities.  It doesn't stop him from wondering fruitlessly though.
“No candy from strangers either” Steve says. Even with his eyes closed Tony knows the guy has to have a shit eating grin on his face.
“You can touch
“Hey Winghead, when you get back to the mansion Stark wants to see you. He said something about showing you a prototype. Wants your input.” Iron man shrugs, repulsored palms up to the sky.
Shopping ended up consisting of Jan, Natasha, and Clint forcing him to try on increasingly ridiculous looking get ups at various department stores.  Well, he thought they were ridiculous, but Jan insisted he looked handsome, and the others agreed.  Outnumbered and charmed, he’d spent a king’s ransom on new pants, shoes, a few jackets, and shirts Natasha said made him look
“Gonna carry me over the threshold cap? Lay me on your bed? I've probably got some white lacy bridal lingerie somewhere.” Steve feels like his brain might go offline for a moment while he pictures what that would look like. Steve has a
It's so good, just hearing him talk like that, hearing that Tony liked the way it looked, still, he likes Tony's cock better than that toy. “Yeah, it did, felt so good. Like you better though.” He says, unable to keep the obstinate tone out of his voice.
“Steve, Steven, you mean to tell me you were out there in the wild,” he waved his hand around, he was looking red in the face, “corrupting the public with lust for your American icon body?” He sounded just a little hysterical.
“Thanks sweetums, you're still the best bird in the flock.” Tony murmurs with a slight smile. Sam crosses his arms over his chest, pointedly clearing his throat. “Oh? Did I start some sort of birdie competition?” The smile is real now, but drops off his face when Natasha nods over at him.
dedicated to tradition.” Tony's eyes are bright and dancing, but he looks like he's gone a few rounds flat on his back. Steve stares at the man purported to be one of the smartest in the world incredulously as he picks up his ridiculous hat and adjusts his sweater.
“Put me down, if that happens to me, I don’t, I can’t live like that.”  Steve said, surprising even himself with the vehemence in his tone.
“Taking too long, here, let me.”  Steve grouches, reaching out to unbelt the robe and pull Tony in by his waist.  He tucks Tony up against him, running a hand down his clothed back, his other beneath the robe, resting on the warm skin of his upper hip where the waistband of his pants begins.
“I’d say if he doesn’t, then he’s got his head stuck up his rear end.”  Steve nearly dropped the book on beading he had been reading, jumping up to walk over to the bed and help Sarah drink the water she was reaching for.
“Yeah Steve, tell me about these thoughts, I'm all ears.” He says, waggling his eyebrows at Steve in a way he hopes is enticing. Steve frowns.
“Don't laugh.”
Saturday turns out to be an exercise in frustration. Their date starts out well enough. Tony is gorgeous in a deep blue suit, having just come back from an obscenely early meeting with the board. He tucks a single red rose behind Steve's ear when he leans up to kiss him in greeting. Steve is so charmed and besotted he almost forgets to give Tony his own gift; a bouquet of Ambrosia and Alstroemeria flowers in bright vibrant colors. He can hear his own heart pounding away as Tony holds the blooms and looks up at him as if they could skip the date and crawl into bed together instead. He doesn't make the offer though, instead seeking out a vase so they won't wilt.  After that he drives them to the museum in a sleek silver Audi with enough rumbling bass to impress the most finicky of car enthusiasts.  Sitting next to him in the car, watching the city go by, Steve is struck by the urge to paint him yet again.
-Tony has some very unkind thoughts about his own mental health, so as always look out for that if self blame and self hate are triggers for you.
Tony loves him, and that's a realization he's already come to on his own, but to hear him actually say almost makes him lose control. It's too much, too good, with Tony urging him on, kissing him between heady sounds of pleasure that drag out into something like wails-and Steve knows better than to bring it up, lest Tony be embarrassed by his own noises, but Steve has never been with anyone so responsive, never been with anyone who abandons all restraint, and certainly never been with anyone with Tony's particular flair for loving filth.
“Darling-”  Tony bursts out laughing, the sound as pleasant and spine tingling as it always is.  “I have the armor; if you really want me to channel my inner ugg the caveman then rest assured, where there’s a will there’s a way.”  The thought of that, of Tony in the armor, picking him up and tossing him on the bed, makes his mouth go dry. Steve swallows a few times, then very deliberately pilfers another bite of their salad.  “Terrible.” Tony laughs. “Can’t take you anywhere; what a menace. Come over here and chop some potatoes before you eat all of our starter.”
“Darling if there's one thing I know it's how to-oh,
"Maybe another night, gimme a raincheck on that, would you?"  He wonders if this is something Thor does often.  Maybe he can get Tony and Iron Man to come down for a soak too.  He could leave the helmet on.  Steve smiles just with the thought of that.
“I-I-” Steve Stutters out, walking across the floor before he can truly register what he's doing. “I-yes. Yes, missed you.” He says helplessly, stepping close to set his hands over Tony's hipbones, plastering his body against Tony's, and leaning over him to demand a kiss. Tony just sighs, twisting slightly to make the angle better, letting his lips slip open to allow Steve's tongue inside. It feels electric, the heat of Tony's mouth, the way he rocks back to rub the curve of his rear against the very obvious hardness behind him.
“Scans detect an amount likely to be Captain Roger's shield is one mile due east.” JARVIS says after a few moments of silence.  Iron Man nods, getting an arm around Steve's waist and encouraging him to step up on the jet boots as they've done many times before. The take off into the sky is as gentle as it's ever been, as if Iron Man is trying to be extra careful about his injury. Steve smiles, if Tony wouldn't think he was making moves on Iron Man he'd give the cheek of the faceplate a kiss right about now.
He was tall, nearly Steve's height, or maybe a little shorter, but not really by much.  Compact, slender, but strong, with warm sunkissed olive skin, but his face, what a face it was, like someone out of a movie matinee.  His hair was blue black, shiny with just a little bit of curl, he had big piercing eyes of the prettiest cerulean blue Steve had ever seen, fringed with thick, dark lashes, and an incredibly precisely trimmed beard that just served to make his features look finer.  Oh wow, Steve thought.  Steve had no idea why the most aggressively beautiful man he’d seen in all his years was walking closer, as if he were there for Steve, but he was-walking closer that was.  If he’d have had a hat on, he would have taken it off in respect, maybe laid his coat out in front of his feet.  Steve hastily grabbed a towel off the supply tray and wiped his face off.
Mio caro-My dear, darling
“No take backsies, you're stuck with me now.”
“C'mere then, let's get your rocket fuel.” Steve says, leaning down to pull Tony into his arms, hoisting him up with one roll of ridiculously powerful shoulders. This is the first time he's been fully conscious to appreciate what it feels like to be carried by a supersoldier. Tony sighs, leaning against Steve and resting his head on one of those magnificent shoulders while Steve totes him up to the main kitchen.  “I missed you, glad you asked me to come and get you.” Steve sounds as sincere as he always does when he's making Tony question the reality of what's currently happening. Tony blinks slowly, sitting up in Steve's arms to get a good look at his face, and Steve meets him head on, not hesitant at all.  “We don't have to talk about what happened at the gala-” Steve starts.  Tony opens his mouth to say something, but closes it again when Steve's Determined face makes an appearance. “-but I want you to know that if you need me to go knock that Hammer asshole around-you just say the word.” Coming from someone else it might be kind of funny. Coming from Steve it's deadly serious. Never in a million years would Captain America offering to kick the ass of someone who wronged him seem anything but fully surreal.
Tony feels sick. He remembers the texture of the cue cards in his hands. Thick card-stock warping between his shaking fingers while he stood at the podium to speak of his love for a man who had tried to take everything-who had succeeded on taking everything from people much more innocent than one Anthony Edward Stark. It had been all he could do to not toss the cards down and tell all those gathered the truth, but he had a role to play, and if dear old dad had taught him anything, it was how to pretend to care about someone for the public.
“Nothing I just-”  Steve licks his lips, getting his fingers in Tony's hair and stroking, smiling when that makes Tony give a full body shiver “I should brush my teeth, freshen up for you.  You always get so clean, and I've still got morning breath.”
Tony, his name is Tony. He thinks, and then he is dreaming again, swept away into the deep.
“I got a lot to see.” He says, scooting a little closer to lean over Tony, resting his hands on the pillow to trail kisses over the strong lines of his neck. Tony shivers, hands going up to stroke through his hair.
He touched a finger to the headset, “Al...right, you okay there Steve?”  He asked.
It's delicious.
“No seriously, I'm not long for this world, I'm-ooh, is that silk?” Tony is touching him fully now, fingers curling just right.
“Food for the Captain of my heart, I bestow upon thee,”  He pulled a big paper container out of his box, “the nacho platter.”
It continued to elude him as the war dragged on, but he only fought harder, be they Hydra, or plain old Nazi scum, Steve introduced them to his shield and bitter defeat.  There was little time for warm companionship behind enemy lines, or hunkered down in London while air raid sirens sounded.  So he contented himself with making sure those under his command were safe.  He salved injuries, offered encouragement, and made speeches when it was needed.  The latter was his least favorite, but everyone said he was a dab hand at it, that he was a natural speech maker, a natural leader, Steve wasn’t so sure about all of that.  He never let on though, through battle after battle, even when the crash after a rush left him shaking, and his warm water bottles did nothing-and had done nothing since rebirth-he fulfilled his purpose, he was happy to.
“Okay, want some food? I'll leave it outside the door if you don't want me coming in.” Steve is so sincere, so kind. Tony needs to think though, needs to work. There are a million ideas pinging around in his brain. He remembers that blind panic when the first lines of palladium poisoning appeared around the reactor. Not because he was dying, not really, or not entirely. He still had too much to do, too much to make up for
Soon, he’ll tell him soon.
“I'll have JARVIS run a facial recognition sweep to see if we can place his last whereabouts, and ping all his contact information first.  Any plan to draw him out is dependent on whether or not anyone can even get in touch with him. Let's start with that, I promise not to use myself as bait unless it's the only way.” Somehow that's not entirely comforting, but it's a far better compromise than Tony's initial plan.
The next few weeks of training were some of the hardest in Steve’s life, but he didn’t quit.  With the war on, they didn’t have the luxury of taking it slow.  Steve watched as one after another, fellow cadets quit or were disqualified  based upon whatever mysterious criteria General Phillips and Dr. Erskine saw fit.  Some of them were moved to regular basic, and Steve still saw them in the distance from time to time, running drills, but most left altogether.  If he was being honest with himself, Steve didn’t know why he hadn’t been packed off home.  He was slower than the other cadets, weaker, but day after day he was not asked to leave.  He learned how to shoot, how to identify and take a gun apart and put it back together, he learned how to use his body weight to take someone larger than himself down, and he learned how to stretch his senses further than he ever had, but all that couldn’t make up for the fact that he was the odd one out.  He wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth though, so he kept trying, kept giving it his all.
“It's amazing Tony,
Steve shakes his head.  “No, it was perfect. Always wanted to learn how to play, but times were tough and my Ma couldn't afford piano lessons.” He can't hide the wistful regret in his tone.  Tony of course, notices.  The soft dreamy expression on his face changing into what Steve recognizes as his 'I'm about to do a Thing.' face. He draws his hand away from Steve's to pat a spot on the bench.
Warnings for:  Steve's continuing battle with depression, canonical character death (but no one we like), awkwardness and some fantasizing about a certain Tony Stark.
“Master Tony called to remind me to ask you if there was anything you wished to request for the weekend grocery effort?  We can accommodate any request, so long as it can be found on this planet.”  Jarvis said mildly, Steve got the feeling that last bit was aimed at Thor.  Jarvis passed him a pad of paper and a fancy lapis and gold pen.  “Write what you wish to have purchased there, and I will see to it.”
Wisdom is not something Steve expected to find in an alien warrior prince, but wisdom it is. He supposes someone like Thor would know a thing or two about feeling out of place. Steve carries those words with him. They're comforting even as they are bittersweet.
“You’re having it delivered?” He said, and almost didn’t believe it was his own voice, choked with emotion as it was. Tony made a sound under his breath, his hand sliding from around Steve’s shoulder to stroke comfortingly at the back of his neck. Steve shivered with that touch, so warm and relaxing even through the material of the gloves.  It wasn't a gesture usually used on alphas at all, but it felt good, grounding.  He wondered if it was something Tony liked, being touched like that, he'd heard about the effect it had on omegas, being stroked there, but no one had ever done it to him.
“Fondling me already, Stark, I’m not that kinda boy.”  Steve laughs, taking both of Tony's hands and leading him over to the car where Happy's holding the door open and looking his namesake. Steve gets in first before reaching out to pull Tony in next to him. Steve seems to have completely abandoned any sense of shame when it comes to manhandling Tony, and Tony couldn't be happier about it. He wonders how easily he could hold him up against a wall. Best not to think of then when he'll likely be in public soon.
Steve's words in the limo the night of the gala come back to him. Steve doesn't say things he doesn't mean; trolling annoying members of the press notwithstanding. The man's moral fiber is unimpeachable, none of the usual duplicity Tony has come to expect lies hidden and lying in wait for him to let his guard down. Then again-Tony thinks; his hand pressing over the reactor beneath his warm sweater-he's not exactly being completely honest with Steve either, is he?
He stows those thoughts though, not exactly appropriate things to be thinking about when you're having family home evening surrounded by friends. Not exactly appropriate thoughts to have when you haven't even
“Your other ones, they’re broken, not that you don’t have plenty of replacements but,”  He took a deep breath, tried out his best smile, the one Tony always returned.  “I just, you can keep em’.”  His voice went a little wobbly, but Tony was smiling, a small, almost cautious smile.  “If you uh,”  He licked his lips, “if you like.”
Business contracts, he wanted them, contracts Stark Industries had, technology we had too. He had some wild scheme he wanted me to be part of.  Me being someone he wanted to fuck just made the deal sweeter.” Tony says it with such matter of factness that Steve feels his blood boil anew. “Probably, I don't know-Steve, ease up a little would you?”
that Tony doesn't know what to do with himself. He wonders if Pepper will be deeply offended if he calls to whine pathetically about his feelings. No, she has better things to do than deal with whatever crisis Tony is having at any given moment. He asks too much of her as it is.  Granted she's always said that Tony needs to talk more about things, not bottle them up and agonize, but he doubts she wants to hear his thesis on why Steve is incredible and he's afraid to ruin everything.
“Yeah, I sure do.” Maybe he sounds like a lovesick idiot all the time now, but Tony seems to like him anyway. Widow smiles over at him from her spot at the controls. Her real smiles are rare things, precious like gems. He thinks sometimes the team are the only ones she ever allows herself to be soft with. His team is safe and alive, bickering back and forth. Steve smiles to himself and lets his mind wander.
“Helps?” Steve murmurs, smiling slightly when Tony burrows closer, tucking his arms in between their bodies and all but curling up against him. Steve hums, rubbing his palms over the smooth material covering Tony's back. Their faces are so close, mere inches separating them across a cheerfully patterned pillow.
“Is that a new uniform? Is that a robot?” Steve asks, staring as both roll towards him-the latter chirping away gleefully and bobbing it's be-hatted pincer as it comes right up to him.
His mind supplies. Rhodey catches him as he goes down, ignoring the mess of hot chocolate staining his clothing as Tony's knees hit the floor. His vision goes slurry, like mixing watercolors on a canvas. There are shapes, more people coming into the room. Are they back?
“Baby, I am not even going to answer that.”  Tony took his hand, leading him down the hall until they reached his room, with Steve trailing after him on autopilot.  He got Steve into the bed with surprising efficiency, helping to strip his boots and mail shirt off, but declining anything else.  “Not that I won’t respect you in the morning, but sugar, you’re not in your right mind.”  He said, pulling the covers up just under Steve’s chin.
“You really made all of this?”  Steve asks wonderingly. A sunny yellow pile of fluffy scrambled eggs takes up an entire plate, as does a veritable mountain of crispy perfectly cooked bacon.  There's coffee, orange juice, an assortment of muffins, and a very neatly organized stack of jelly tins-the kind Steve remembers from diners so long ago.
It will never be enough.
“Indeed, and I concur.” Tony snarks back.
“Shame on me for letting you feel anything but warm and toasty again.” Tony says with a light laugh.  He saunters over, the corners of his eyes crinkling when Steve catches his wrist no sooner than he’s come into range.  He doesn’t say anything, merely sighing when Steve rubs his fingers over the smooth skin of his wrist. “What is it darling, what do you need?”  He murmurs, lifting his free hand to scratch his fingers over Steve’s scalp lightly. It’s all he can do not to purr, it feels so good; that light careful touch.
“Zipped out like a dragonfly, don't worry about me Cap, you and Shellhead okay?” Jan calls, Steve can hear the flutter of her wings over the speakers.
“We'll stay here tonight, then take off in the morning. Don't worry, we have a ride.” Rhodey says, anticipating Tony's objection over his only means of transportation being potentially gone.
Steve's bike is in the section of the garage with the Avengers' various methods of transportation. Tony thinks the ramp covered in Captain America shields is understated by his standards. Steve thought it was a bit much, but Tony still loves it. The bike itself is gorgeous, vintage but kitted out with all the bells and whistles Tony could come up with-which is to say a whole lot of them. Tony presses a few buttons on the armor bracelets wrapped around his wrists. Iron Man won't be joining them but that doesn't mean Tony won't have the armor shadow them from high above.
“I, I,”  Tony put a hand to his chest, “am not kidding.  I feel like he should be on a commemorative plate.  As a thirst trap.”
“Still prettier,” He insists, the effect somewhat ruined by how soft and slurry his voice is.  Tony sighs, stroking his sweaty hair back from his face gently.
“Shut it Tweety, you're just jealous you don't get to run your grubby little talons all over Stark's proprietary tech before anyone else does.” Iron Man says, examining his armored fingers with a sniff of mock derision. Hawkeye's face pops into view above a building just to the left of them. He extends one finger in a rude gesture and blows a raspberry at the team below him.
He wanted to tell him that, but he was aware that would sound too much like what he really wanted to say; I think I’m falling in love with you. “Hey, didn’t you hear? I’m a lousy liar.” He said instead.
“Sleep, Tony, you need it.” Steve speaks right up against his lips, and Tony kisses him again, sighing when Steve pulls back and climbs from the bed.
“C'mon big guy, we have limited time here, line up and get in me.” Tony whines, grabbing an innocuous little bottle off the desk that Steve knows to be what Tony has dubbed their 'travel lube'.
“I told you I wanted to take care of you Tony, when I'm done doing that then maybe.” Steve is proud of how steady his voice is despite everything. The shock on Tony's face is worth it when he picks him up and starts walking towards a tall metal table just at the perfect height to be hip level.
“Sure Cap, I'll add blue to my repertoire, just for you.” Tony simpers, batting his lashes ostentatiously in Steve's direction. This close he can see each individual lash-the dark frame of them casting shadows over warm brown irises.  “So, what's this about Crossbones anyway?” Tony whispers, interrupting Steve's intense scrutinization of his face.
“I can do this.”  He said to the mirror.  Even his reflection looked a little dubious.
.” Tony nearly chants, squirming against the hold on his hip, pulling his knee further up on the desk. Steve groans, backing off and snagging the lube bottle off the table to wet his fingers with more of the viscous liquid. Tony makes a loud sound of obvious frustration, turning his head to glare back at Steve. The effect is slightly ruined by the wide dilation of his pupils and the dark flush on his cheeks. “Why did you stop?” He sounds so affronted that Steve almost feels bad, but not bad enough to do something he'll regret later.
you, and I know you're a good man, a great man. One of these days you're gonna get your head out of your ass and tell the Avengers the truth, and they're all going to welcome your dumb ass in like you've always been there-because you
“Did you catch her name, who was she?”  Steve asks, ready and willing to be swept into Tony’s enthusiasm as he ever is.
“Excuse you, are you-are you
“You really
The bruising must be hurting him something dreadful. Asleep as he is there's no front to put on, no way to pretend he's not feeling the way he is. It makes Steve feel crazy. There's nothing he can do about it though, so he just makes sure to be as careful as possible; murmuring reassurances to Tony while they make their way through the house.
Meeting Johann Schmidt, The Redskull the first time left Steve in a rush that lasted three days.  He was vile, disgusting in ways Steve could not and did not want to ever understand.  Everything about the man-if he could even be called that-was grotesque.  From his ugly mug to his vomitous ideology.  There was clear madness in his eyes, but also far too much intelligence as well, and not a shred of human decency or compassion, or anything redeeming left in him, if there ever had been.  Steve would have called him a clown, or maybe a donkey’s rear end, but frankly that was insulting to both clowns and donkeys’ rear ends, and not nearly vulgar enough for how Steve felt about the ugly son of a canker sore.
his body.
“I'm sorry you had to see that.” He says quietly, shame and embarrassment twisting up the words.  Beside him Iron Man goes still. There's an electrical buzzing at the center of him. A frequency Steve has never heard. He remembers Torch sounding a little like this, but there had been fire in him instead of this soft electrical hum.  There's nothing organic about it at all, but he knows in his heart if he were to open the face-plate a flesh and blood man is inside. It's almost more comforting this way. Not having to see pity in someone else's eyes makes it slightly easier to pull himself together and pretend.
“You're
Tony, I mean, just look at this-” he gestures at the twinkling, shifting holograms around them.  Tony is
“Níðhöggr you have no business on Midgard, return whence you came!” Thor's booming voice has never been so welcome. The beast stills, head raising to stare over at Thor with dark void filled eyes. It speaks then, but Steve can't make heads or tails of what's being said, it's definitely not English. Thor understands though, his face growing thunderous as his namesake.  “Release him and return, or face the wrath of a son of Odin, beast.” That as it turns out was not the right thing to say. It lunges at Thor, but the he meets it head on, the sound of them clashing blowing back debris and trees with the force of it. Hawkeye is knocked from his perch, but he clambers to an outcropping of rocks to fire arrows at a blindingly fast speed. Widow and Captain Marvel join the fray moments later, and the clearing lights up with the crackle of power.
Tony murmurs, fluttering his lashes in a way he hopes is becoming in the direction of the guy who was most certainly the one stroking his hair earlier.
sending off his message without comment. Beside him Steve is tapping away at his phone, a fond expression making his features soft. Sunlight combs warm fingers through the golden blond crowning Steve's head, the blue of his eyes is a color Tony has only seen in paintings. Beneath the arc, his heart gives a strange and worrying twist in response to Steve hugging the plush against his cheek, and snapping another picture to send to Tony.
Later he sits in a ruined bar, emptiness clawing at him as surely as any knife wound. Peggy puts a hand on his shoulder but he feels carved out of glass. Numbness is better than horror he supposes, but Bucky was one of the people he'd counted on coming out of this war no matter what.
for commissioning the artwork in this chapter.  She surprised the hell out of me with it and I've been a mess since seeing it.
“I'm sure I don't know what you mean.” The illusion is a little flimsy, because JARVIS sounds entirely unsurprised.  Steve pulls up a video of Tony crouching down to take a picture with a pair of tiny twin girls. The three of them flash the peace sign, Steve feels that one two punch of affection sharp-right between the ribs. Tony's real smile is something Steve wants to see more of. Behind them Iron Man is posing for a picture of his own, but his movements are off.
“Um. Would you believe I lost track? I was in another hemisphere earlier, and then there was the thing with the gyroscope in Philly-” He trails off as Steve bends to pull a fresh fitted sheet over the bed.
“I want to kiss you, let me kiss you Tony?”
“Avengers, what?” He's so confused even the strange pacemaker seems low on the surreal factor. Avengers sounds familiar though, like something just on the tip of his tongue. He reaches for that thread, that faint glimmer of familiarity. So close, the shore is so close, if he can just dip his fingers in the water.
He slept three hours before an Avengers alert thrust him into wakefulness again.  He counted it as a win.
“Well I can't court a married fella, so you better hop to. Sorry Colonel, don't mean to be a homewrecker but I just can't resist a pretty pair of brown eyes.” Steve has always been the type to wear his heart on his sleeve, and there is that saying about hiding secrets being easier when they're right out in the open.  Tony proves him right; laughing into his eggs, oblivious to the way everyone else in his entourage has stopped everything they're doing to just stare at the pair of them. Steve feels the tips of his ears go hot again.
“No. No, not bad enough for that.” His mouth feels dry and disgusting. Water would be nice, but water means getting up out of bed. Tony squints over at the door to the bathroom where he knows there is a full pitcher.  “Gonna build a drone to bring me water.” He mutters, mentally counting to ten before swinging his legs over the side of the bed.
He had money now though, bank accounts left untouched for decades.  Tony had triumphantly informed him he had a big lump sum of backpay to his name as well as being paid by the Avengers.  He had some idea of what he wanted to do.  Of course the trouble was that Tony was an alpha, it wasn’t really common practice to give an alpha lavish courting gifts, but Tony wore jewelry, and in some of the glossy magazine photos he had seen of him, Tony had been wearing gloves, so clearly he eschewed traditions both spoken and unspoken.
“It’s the masters of evil again, you know the drill.”  Wasp said, she looked deeply annoyed.
“Aw Tony, shaddup.”  Steve said with a laugh, taking a bite of his second hot dog.
!” Tony moans, rolling his hips back against Steve, the flush creeping over his chest and shoulders darkening when Steve makes an educated guess that Tony enjoys being praised; leaning over Tony to whisper the filthiest things he's ever said out loud against Tony's lips, kissing him between panting drags of breath as he sets about fucking him into the mattress. Most men Steve has been with in his admittedly short history with these things go at least semi soft at first, but Tony's erection hasn't flagged at all. He's so hard it almost looks painful, his cock leaving sticky trails of precome over his stomach where it juts out from his fist.
seek him out, and seems happy to be around him, so that has to count for something.
“Natasha, Jan, and Clint helped me pick it, what’s the big idea? You trying to make me feel self conscious, Stark?” He said, smiling wide.
“Thor!  Iron Man!  Stop him, he’s gone mad!”  The giant yelled, as Steve barreled him down.  There was a robot standing in his field of vision, and a tall mountain of a man that looked like a Viking.  All around his face a tiny woman fluttered, calling to him in distress.  Steve paused, his chest heaving.  They were not trying to hurt him, they were merely trying to calm him down.  Bucky was dead, Bucky was gone and he was confused and taking it out on these people, strange though they were, they had done nothing to warrant the way he lashed out.  Confusion and grief warred within him, he dropped to a knee, clutching at his own hair.  It was damp but drying in the warm dry air of the room.
“You!”  Zemo shrieked, jumping back away from Steve, his eyes were wide, arrogant still but afraid, “I thought you were dead, I thought I had rid myself of you forever!”
“Hey Russell,”  Steve whispered across the aisle, and Russell turned towards him with a wide, toothy grin, like he’d been waiting for someone to ask, “you wearing those to show off or what?”  Steve immediately regretted his own tone, but he couldn’t exactly walk the words back.  Still, Russell’s smile only seemed to get wider.
“It's too late, it's done, it's over and he's gone. I'm just sorry you all paid the price for my sentimentality.” Tony mutters, hiding his face against Steve's chest. He thinks of all the things he could say to that, worthless platitudes that won't mean anything to Tony right now. Things that speak of how they have both failed each other in these painful weeks apart. It all rings hollow compared to what he really wants to say.
There is something odd though. This close most people's heartbeats are audible to him, but Mister Stark's seems to be missing. He sounds staticky almost, like the buzz of power-lines, or the faint fuzz of electrical activity he can feel emanating off the tiny sleek phone the man presses into his hand upon leading him to what is to become his new room.
“Sure thing, captain's orders.” Tony says, trying for levity but ending up at weak and winded instead. Steve watches him walk over to his bed, gaze steady until he's done turning back the covers to his bed, and then he's striding from the room, letting the door slip shut behind him.
Later when they have reunited, Tony lets Steve back into their rebuilt room and strips the SHIELD uniform from him with shaking hands. Their first kiss that night is like coming back to life, and Steve vows to never let their lines of communication falter again.
“Good to meet you, Widow."  He says, testing out the name he heard Hawkeye call out earlier.  The quirk of her lips tells him he got it right "Is there anything I should know about Mister Stark-since I'm gonna be staying in his house and all.” He ventures hesitantly.
“Oh, alright well, I’ll try to get us there in one piece.”  He said, putting his hand on the driver’s side door.  A handle slid out of the door and it unlocked.
“Steve, m'workin, how'd you find my office?” The words are jumbled and half asleep.
be true.” The sarcasm is overwhelming, but their young audience has yet to learn the nuances of Tony Snarkisms.
Steve is bright, fire siren red, and Tony wants to kiss him, wants to cling tight and never let him go. He also wants to talk to him, to remind him of all the good things other than Tony Stark here in the present. As much as he wants that kiss though, and to talk, and maybe air out some things Steve has obviously been keeping locked up tighter than a SHIELD prison-it's not a good idea right this moment. His state of mind is all upside down and sideways. Too many terrible things bubbling below the surface. He might end up clocking Steve across the face if they kiss now. That and Tony's self aware enough to know his mouth probably tastes pretty dreadful right now, but that does nothing to stop him from
“Oh fuck, Tony, I'm sorry I didn't think, I didn't-it didn't, do you remember th-” Clint starts, only to be cut off by Rhodey's aggressive throat clearing.
“Yeah, what am I promising?”
“Tony.” Steve breathes, and Tony raises his head, bracing his hands on Steve's chest to lean up over him, teasing him first by kissing the corners of his mouth, his chin, before allowing the demanding grip on his tie to pull him in fully, pressing their lips together at last. Steve's lips are soft and warm, parting easily for his tongue when he sweeps it over the perfect cupid's bow like he's been wanting to. Slow syrupy pleasure buzzes through his veins, lighting all along his nerves in every spot their bodies touch.
“Uh so
between them. Besides, he
“JARVIS, is Tony angry with me?” He asks, after staring at the mussed spot on the sheets where Tony had slept the entire night.
“Well-” Steve starts slowly, hesitantly. “I guess I wouldn't like my first kiss with a fella to be because I'm under some spell.”
“Yes sir, I promise I'll be careful. I'm sure Mister Stark appreciates having you to smack us around.”
There will be one more speech to wring the last few dollars from the stone at the end of the night, but for now it's dinner and dancing. Tony has always hated this part. The bigger the donation, the more he is expected to make nice with the donor. Sometimes it's alright, but other times not so much. Tony has lost count of various vulgar propositions he has received over the years. People get awfully brave when they're full of expensive booze and dropping huge sums of money.
Sometimes he wonders if that would have changed things.  If him being with his parents somehow would have prevented the accident.  If his absence had driven Howard to drink more.  It doesn’t matter now.  The rain drives down  as they lower his parents into the ground, Obie’s hand is heavy on his shoulder, but not as heavy as the dreams that night.
. Tony doesn't know what, but Rhodey just sags, stepping close to pull him into a hug so tight it makes his back pop.
“Nope, had a smoothie, I'm all good, and if I eat any more carbs I'm going back to sleep. Not all of us are supersoldiers. I work hard for this bod, so many squats, you don't even know.”  Tony grumbles, glaring around the table as if affronted by all the superhero metabolisms surrounding him.  Steve resists the urge to glance down at the body in question.  He stares enough as it is.
In the distance there were sirens.  Steve pulled some zip ties from one of his belt pouches and jogged over to bind Mole Man's arms behind his back.  There were much better restraints, but he didn’t think Mole Man was coming to anytime soon.
“You know when I can’t sleep, sometimes I play cards against my A.I., but I bet you can give me a better run for my money.”  It was a tacit admittance that both of them might be having a less than stellar night, without prying. Steve appreciated the company, as well as the way Tony loosened his tie and rolled his sleeves up over his forearms.  There was a band of gold around his arm there, Steve indicated it with a nod.
“Christ.” He groans, knocking his head back against the wall as Steve kisses over his jaw.
“What is it big guy, did I fall asleep on you?”  Tony slurs, his voice thick with drowsiness. Steve holds him a little tighter, kissing the top of his head.
“No Captain Rogers, I believe sir is practicing avoidance. He is rather skilled at that.” JARVIS says crisply. Steve's brow furrows with concern. He swings his legs over the side of the bed, and walks over to his dresser to root around in it for a tee.
“Well, donkey’s rear end or not, be careful, I’m glad you weren’t seriously injured, but, just, be careful.”  Steve heard many parents over the years in their apartments mourning the loss of an alpha child to the armed forces.  It was a calling many went to, a place where they could serve as protectors, on the front lines, where Alphas had always been since armies existed.  There were less alphas now, Steve remembered his social studies lessons, Mrs. Carmichael droning on about populations reacting to war, and alphas only making up a fifth of the world population now, compared to some unbelievable fraction before they’d invented the wheel, or however it went, there were even fewer omegas.  He couldn’t really remember though, he had been too busy staring at the back of Russell’s head.
Steve moaned, tossed his head back into the pillows with just the thought of it, the thought of Tony holding him down, giving him the fucking of his life.  Tony was strong, smaller than Steve, but his body was-God his body, his legs, those thighs, that gorgeous rear, and then there was the armor, it made him taller than Steve, stronger.  He was barely stroking himself and he already felt close, his thoughts dissolving into a tangle of need and want and half formed images.
“I like your physique. I like it a lot.” Steve says, dropping into the loveseat at the end of Tony's bed and drawing him close.
Still, when he looked back at Tony waving at him through the glass as he left the lab in search of more food from the kitchen, he couldn’t help but think about how amazing his touch felt.
“You want dinner, how about Patsy's when we get back?” Steve loves Patsy's Pizza, it's been around since he was a kid, and it doesn't seem to have changed all that much. Sometimes when he goes in there he feels like he almost might be back in the forties-well if he ignores all the people milling around, but it's still nice on days he's feeling nostalgic.
Steve took it from him, staring down at the huge plate of what looked like some kind of chips and bright yellow sauce, meat, and spicy smelling red stuff.  He could feel his cheeks turning a little pink from the way Tony had gone about it, but he was so hungry.  Steve sniffed it, and then popped one of the chips in his mouth.  It was delicious, spicy and hot.
“Isn’t it though?”  Tony said, half under his breath, then shook his head.  “It’s not your fault, and it’s not important anyway.”
As ever your comments and yelling sustain me, and to everyone on the Discord just know that I love you all so much.
a prince after all; he's done his fair share of political posturing to go along with displaying his rippling pectorals to best effect and wrestling bilgesnipes.  He's smart too, with a sort of wisdom only an undying godlike being could possibly have.  Tony is really,
“You let me borrow these, so I’m here, returning them to their rightful owner.  Thank you by the way, I showed them to everyone and told them Captain America gave them to me.” His hand shook a little bit, he wiggled his fingers, gently jostling the links in his palm.  Steve couldn’t tell whether or not he was serious about that.  But the thought of that, the suggestion that Tony might’ve walked around showing other people the cuff-links, his
“I think.” He says slowly.
sitting on top of Steve.
It's going to be a long few hours.
“God,”  He shuddered, his face was wet.  He pulled the cowl off, tossed it atop the shield.  His hair was drenched with sweat, but he was still cold, his teeth chattering audibly in the quiet of the room.  He was getting sweat all over Iron Man’s fancy heated blanket.  It didn’t even need a cord, of course it didn’t, because it had been seventy years.  Steve stifled the hysterical laugh bubbling in his throat.  He had to get it together, falling apart like a house of cards was doing him no favors, but he couldn’t bring himself to move.  He laid there shaking and clutching the blanket around himself until a soft knock sounded at the bedroom door.
Steve tries to keep his focus on that, and not the sound of the wind rushing by a window Wasp opened to poke her head out of. He wants to pull her back, drag her away from that exposed position. The mountainside taunts him, and he looks down at his own hands clenched in his lap, refusing to see the trees rushing by. His peripheral vision-always such a blessing in battle-is an enemy here. Even his his gaze averted he can still see the scenery rushing by. Minute shivers dance over his skin, and he grits his teeth to keep them from chattering. Distantly, as if from the end of a long tunnel he hears Iron Man talking to the others, then the shuffle of them all filing out of the compartment.
“Do you ever wonder-”  Tony says when he notes Steve's arrival “what it's like for other couples, couples who aren't as well known as we are?”
“Don't apologize.” Tony says, pressing his hand over Steve's mouth before he can even get a word out. “Don't. It's not your fault, it's
The villain is a joke. It would be funny if it wasn't so infuriatingly frustrating. Iron Man is standing just off to the side of Steve in the middle of the street. Up high in a building Clint is doing a startlingly obnoxious impression of Woody the Woodpecker. It would be disturbing, but given the looks of their current ne'er do well-it's appropriate.
“He probably won't go for it. Last I saw he had a whole bunch of stuff to work on. Projects, meetings, he falls asleep in there a lot.” That seems to not have been the right thing to say. Instead of Steve looking resigned the way most people do when finding out Tony is a workaholic-Steve just looks like he's taken it as a personal challenge.
“Darling, my darling, you are so lovely.  I don't think anyone knows how much, but I do.”  Tony murmurs against his ear, and Steve flushes hot, something warm and fluttering spinning out in his stomach when Tony drops kisses over his cheek, his red, red ear, and his neck.
is the last thing he thinks before falling asleep on top of Steve for the nth time this evening.
.” He's interrupted from the beginnings of what would be a truly impressive rant by JARVIS making the sort of throat clearing sound he reserves for special occasions.
“Boy is that a loaded statement.” Tony whispers, turning his head away from that grip, away from the adoring look in Steve's eyes. He leans his head against Steve's shoulder though, unwilling and unable to go hide away.  He snuggles in closer, letting Steve hold him close in the middle of the hall as if it's the only thing worth doing at the asscrack of dawn.
“Yeah I'm up, but I kind of don't want to be.” Tony says, then softer. “I was worried about you.” Steve kisses the top of Tony's head, rubbing his cheek over dark soft hair, carefully curling both arms around the warm body pressed all along his. Tony practically melts against him, sliding his arms under Steve's and around his back in a loose hug.
' to himself with increasing volume.
“Watch it tin-man, blast lining up on your six.”  Wasp said over the comms, and Iron Man did a sort of pirouette in the sky to avoid another of Melter’s blasts, before Widow climbed onto the guy’s back and started choking him with ruthless precision.
“Why? Why would all of you come out here looking for me?”
Some warnings for character injury-nothing too graphic, but there is a fight in this chapter as a head's up.  Also Tony and his self loathing, but that's kind of a given with him.
“Private room, we need a private room.” She says crisply. Her eyes look a little wet, but her posture is ready, confident. This trio of familiar yet unfamiliar faces is almost enough to distract him from the powerful feeling of general
“Shellhead, Shellhead talk to me!” The Doombot rears up, stomping on Iron Man's chest. Friction and pressure conspire to throw molten sparks all over the pavement. The armor holds, but it dents inward. Even through the voice modulation, Steve hears the sound of a wheeze.
“It is a little silly.” Steve murmurs, slipping a hand up to stroke through Tony's hair. “Silly is good though, I like silly, it's nice to just have fun. Thank you Tony, it's great.” Tony is watching him uncertainly, just the barest hints of pink along his cheeks, so Steve kisses those two spots of color. Tony's eyes close, and he lets Steve hold him like that until JARVIS announces he has a call from James Rhodes. The AI sounds regretful about disturbing them, but Steve is happy Rhodes will be joining them. Tony obviously misses his friend, and Rhodes has given him solid advice before concerning Tony, maybe he can help work a miracle.
“He tried to kidnap me, a few months before Steve was found and it didn't turn out too well for him.”
“He wants the arc reactor, my tech, access to technology I discussed with him as a friend, he needs me alive and mostly unharmed. At least I think he does.” Tony sounds so certain, but Steve doesn't think it's entirely true.
Warnings:  Angst, Presumed death, Steve not coping well, Panic attacks/PTSD, and Sexual content (although not a ton) at two points, one of which is at the very beginning.
As always, your wonderful comments and kudos keep me from becoming an unproductive potato, I love them all.
It's a tiny scrap of silky fabric; hot-rod red, the same color as the armor. The thin string of it runs up between his crease. Steve feels the air leave him in a long exhalation.
His capillary beds don't seem to care about his dignity in the slightest. Tony hasn't blushed this much since he was a too shy little kid who used words even the adults around him had to look up. It's new, daunting, he's out of his depth but he doesn't want to stop.
“JARVIS I'm going to die of blue balls.”
“Listen. You're Captain America, I doubt you would do anything bad, but Tony doesn't have a good record with people he trusts. He's a great guy, best friend I've got, but let's just say his self preservation instincts leave a lot to be desired, you know what I mean? So I'm making it clear now, if you got any ulterior motives lurking around, if you're just messing with him, you need to leave him alone now, before he gets too invested.” This time there's no friendliness in Rhodes' bearing.  Steve does salute this time. It just snaps out of him without a thought, the reaction so ingrained in him by that tone of voice that it's all he can do not to drop down and start doing push ups just on reflex. He wonders if Rhodes ever met General Phillips.
Tony affects a casual stance to try and hide the fact that a wave of panic just rolled up and tried to strangle him. It's unsurprisingly
“First off, how are you feeling? That was a heck of a hit you took. Are you alright?” The puppy eyes are really killer. Tony is very happy for the faceplate, because in all likelihood his face probably just did something really undignified.
“Hey Stark, Stark, Staaark-” Clint whines, rolling across the cushions to get a little closer. “Let's watch something.”
“No uh,”  Tony licked his lips, came to stand closer to Steve, “I’d love to borrow them, if you don’t mind me wearing something of yours.”  The way he said it made Steve feel hot all over and entirely stupid in the head.  He was peripherally aware of Natasha looking between the two of them and then taking an impressively large bite of her muffin.  Tony was still staring.
“Okay, count on me, I’ll get it back for you ma'am.”  Steve said, making sure the woman sat before taking off at a sprint in the direction of the two fleeing men.  They hadn’t gotten far, seemingly thinking no one planned on chasing them down.  Steve felt anger course through him as they ran into an alleyway.  How dare they, how dare they attack someone like that, someone that obviously had no way of defending themselves.  His lungs burned, but he didn’t slow down until he was face to face with the two goons.
Nutmas continues!  Onward to the obligatory bed-sharing chapter
“So,”  Natasha said, breaking him out of the mental fog he had been quickly descending to, “I’ll just...leave you to your breakfast.”  She stood up, grabbed another muffin, and then went sauntering out of the room.
“Nope, I'm all marshmallowed out, this one's for you.” Steve glances up briefly, catching Natasha pantomiming feeding and eating motions, she gives him a thumbs up when he brings the sweet right up to Tony's lips. Brown eyes flick up to his, but Tony accepts the marshmallow, letting Steve feed it to him slowly, licking the sticky sweet from Steve's fingers and his own lips when he's done. It takes everything in Steve's power not to groan with the feeling of that warm, wet mouth on his skin. The term 'hard enough to pound nails' comes to mind. Steve hopes Tony can't feel it, seated atop him as he is.
When they part though, and Steve finally has the presence of mind to open his eyes, Tony is hard too.  The tie of his red silk robe has come all but undone sometime during their enthusiastic kisses; baring him in a long strip all the way down to his toes.  He doesn't say anything though, letting Steve look his fill, press his hands all over gorgeous golden skin, pull him closer between his knees so he can kiss the very center of Tony's chest.
Back at the mansion his confidence wavered.  He sat on his overly luxurious bed, holding the little box with the cufflinks in it.  What had he been thinking?  Here he was, in a massive mansion belonging to a man he intended to court with
“Yeah boss, way to leave your friend's out of the loop” Happy adds, grinning over at Pepper.
’  Loud and clear.  He supposed that was better than having his gift returned and for everyone in their damn grade to have figured out Steve had been rejected.  He supposed he was luckier even, than all the other hopefuls who would have gifts returned to their faces, likely in front of their friends and peers.  Steve dropped his eyes back to the table.  It still stung like hell.
Gal follows him into the house as if she belongs there. Tony wonders if the person who takes care of the house when he's not there has been letting her inside. He hopes so. It gets pretty cold here, and the thought of his new fluffy friend braving the elements is not a pleasant one. One of the kitchen cupboards proves to contain several cans of fancy wet cat food. Tony opens the can for Gal and sets it out, watching her eat enthusiastically before setting out to explore his surroundings.
“Tony, Tony, call off your dog, cut me a deal.” Hammer continues, seemingly unconcerned that he's admitted to colluding with Stane on a recording, or just how close he came to having Tony punch him directly in the trachea.  “I've got plans, you've got the arc reactor technology, it could be beautiful, you and me work-” He doesn't get to finish, JARVIS pulls his hand up and backhands Hammer in such a perfect arc that Tony thinks he might need to make a gif of it later. Hammer spins like a ballerina on point, squealing with terror and going down like a sack of bricks. It may be the most beautiful thing Tony has ever seen.
“Yeah, dad's here. Kind of shaken up, but here, hey kiddos.” Tony whispers, suddenly overcome with a fierce sort of joy that he might have forgotten a lot of things, but at least no one has forgotten
Thor, he just doesn't like Thor feeding Tony while he's all sleepwarm and snuggly.  Or maybe he just wants Thor to share some apple fritter with him too, what was it Clint called him when he was being a pill after not having eaten enough?  Hangry.  That was it.
Steve’s ears were ringing, his heartbeat loud in his own ears.  Zemo was still speaking, but it didn’t matter, there was nothing he could have said that Steve wanted to hear.  Zemo had clearly been practicing, but he was not as adept as he thought he was.  An arrogant murderer of innocents with a god complex, that was all Zemo had ever been.  He still remembered the test subjects, helpless victims of tyranny.  Zemo never had been able to stand up to someone that could fight back.  He was going on about how he could never lose, how Steve was soft and could never beat him.  What a load of garbage, Steve didn’t pull his punches.  He felt each impact with a grim satisfaction, alternating between using the shield and his fists.  He spoke to Zemo about liberty, and the measure of a man, even if he knew it fell on deaf ears, but it didn’t matter, in the end he stood over him panting, while Zemo struggled to stand like the worm he was.
Tony had expected shy and fumbling, not whatever this is, but he's not complaining at all. It's obvious Steve hasn't kissed a lot of people, but what he lacks in experience he's making up for by being so damn enthusiastic Tony's pretty sure he's going to come in his pants like a fucking teenager.
“Is it good, does it please you?” Thor asks. The sliver of jealousy is rapidly upgraded to full on jealousy when Tony nods and lets Thor feed him another piece of the fritter. Objectively he knows it's ridiculous, Thor is just being Thor, he's not
the train engine and systematically ripping the rest of the train to shreds. It seemed uninterested in the passengers, but the danger is obvious.
, but others told him it could become entirely unmistakable that he was an alpha.  If Tony was also an alpha, that might be a little off putting.  Steve frowned, feeling the arousal abate slightly, enough to at least make it back to his room without any awkwardness if he crossed anyone’s path in the hallway.
“Oh Steve,
Tony stares at it for anywhere between a minute and an hour before the desire for food and coffee has him texting Steve back on impulse.
“Don’t worry about it being warm, I have an ac unit in my room.”  He said, his voice sounded choked and thin.
On the screen, the pixilation cleared, and Steve stared, and then scrolled closer. There was activity on the island all right. Crates of suspicious looking materials, racks of weapons, and most tellingly a banner with Zemo’s heraldry draped over the entrance to the fort. The bastard never had been able to resist boasting about his blue blood, and thank goodness for that, he had a target now.
The hallways are calm and silent, the reason soon becoming apparent when he steps out onto the tower's party deck to find all of the Avengers outside watching the snowfall. All of the Avengers except Tony that is. Steve scans the deck and finally spots him through the windows-he's on a ladder in one of the atriums decorating the biggest blue spruce Steve has ever seen outside of Times square. Huge gold and silver garlands wrap around it, the topper is-Steve blinks-something that looks like his shield.
“Ask and ye shall receive, gorgeous.”   Tony said, and then whipped him up into the sky.  There were times in this new century where he felt less alive than dead, as if he was merely sleepwalking.  But this, he was meant to do this.  To stand back to back with his team, with Iron Man.  He belonged here.
“There's someone I want you to talk to. Have you...have you talked to anyone about what you're feeling since you woke up?” Tony sounds vaguely horrified, the expression on his face growing to match the tone of his voice when Steve shakes his head.
“Run handwriting scan, toxicity matrix, it doesn't look explosive, but lets make sure before I touch it.” If it
“I know you don’t need one but,”  Steve felt his own face reddening, that pit in the base of his stomach he knew all too well.  He wanted to be a good alpha, for those betas to have looked at him and seen a protector, and not a laughing stock.
“It’s my private jet, it goes when we get there.”  Tony smiled winningly, sitting back on the bed, resting his palms on the covers.  The motion pulled his jacket sleeves up enough for Steve to see the cufflinks he’d given him glittering away there.  Steve swallowed, his cock gave an interested twitch in the sweatpants.  Steve bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to taste copper.  Tony was still speaking, completely oblivious to Steve’s inner turmoil.  “That is of course um, if you want to.  I realize I’m just kind of springing this on you.”  He laughed nervously, rising from the bed and taking a few steps toward the door.  “Sorry, I’ll go, this was dumb, nevermind me.”
“Hit the nail on the head, mister.  You don't have to though; I know you were busy before I came in.” The last thing he wants to do is impose, but Tony just hums, nuzzling into his hand and casting a look up at Steve through his lashes.
“Yeah, hug away, go for it, but no groping, I have to be presentable in a minute, Captain Handsome.” He wouldn't really object to a little groping, truth be told, but he's trying to behave.  Steve hums, pulling Tony back against his chest, wrapping his arms around Tony's waist and setting his chin on Tony's shoulder. Tony sighs, leaning back against Steve and resting his arms over Steve's where they drape low on his waist. Steve just holds him like that, kissing his cheek now and then, and stroking his fingers over the backs of Tony's hands until one of the organizer's comes back to give him the cue.
“You’re in Massachusetts, Jackass, did you make a wrong turn at Albuquerque?” Tony called, kicking open his briefcase to reveal shining red metal.  He gestured, and it flowed towards him almost like liquid, locking in place to form the Iron Man armor.  It was a different model than the one he used on the field, a little bulkier, but still, what a look.  “God, Reed owes us for this.”  Iron Man’s modulated voice sounded annoyed.
He paused to look at a painting on the wall.  It was framed in gilt, Steve was pretty sure it was an original piece from one of the New Wave artists of his childhood.  Steve looked at it for a solid ten minutes before finally making it down to the gym.  The door Iron Man indicated during the impromptu tour led to a solidly built elevator, it had a few buttons labeled on it, and Steve pressed the one that said ‘training floor 1’ cautiously.  It lit up, and then Steve felt the bottom drop out of his stomach as he was speedily and smoothly conveyed downwards.  Well, he thought, stepping out into bright lights and the hum of electronic gizmos, It was certainly not Lorenzo De Rossi’s all purpose one room gym.  It was huge, with strange machines covered in weights, walls to practice climbing, all manner of mysterious contraptions Steve couldn't work out the use of, and far in the back, something that looked like a street in the city.  This was not a gym, this was a whole level of the mansion specifically created for a superhero team.
“Welcome back, hot stuff, are you all clean for me?”  He asks, trailing one finger down Steve's chest and circling it around his nipple in a way that makes him suck a harsh breath in through his teeth.
“You drive like a maniac, Rogers, I approve.”  Tony said, pushing his sunglasses further up the bridge of his nose, leaning down to grab a briefcase from the rumble seats in the back.
“Tis a day of celebration!” Thor declares, finally setting Tony down.
so it just makes Tony kind of want to climb him like a jungle gym.
it fits, but I really want to see you strut your stuff, make sure you're comfortable in it.”
“Stuff it, keep talking about that and we'll end up fighting a giant gingerbread man or something because someone has watched too much Shrek and decided I need to die for eating their brethren.” Steve would laugh at the idea, but they really
“Fine, okay. Iron Man is off feeding Hammer to SHIELD right now as it is...I think? Not important. Okay.” He adjusts his suit, splashes his face with water and rinses his mouth out.
His mood is lifted slightly by the sight of the other Avengers all decked out in formal wear. Thor is in a sequined tuxedo. Tony blinks at it.
After the authorities arrived and carted off Mole Man and the Moloids, the whole stadium seemed to stream out on the field to clasp their arms and congratulate them.  They signed autographs, and then they posed with the Seahawks for pictures.  They each got signed shirts from the entire team, and cute mini commemorative footballs, along with a standing invitation to the best seats in CenturyLink Field back in Seattle.
Steve thinks. When their gazes meet Tony's smile softens further, and he rubs his thumb over Steve's cheek, tracing the bone, his touch settling against the short hair at his temple. “Hi there, gorgeous, how are you feeling?” Tony asks, settling more heavily atop him. It shouldn't be comfortable, they're both messy and sweaty, but it's perfect. It's difficult to put into words how he feels right now, difficult to explain that he feels gilded, as if he's laying in the warmest ray of sunshine, as if nothing terrible could ever touch him.
“Oh yeah, good one, definitely do not interrupt coffee time. Also watch your step, he falls asleep in weird places.” It's obvious Wasp considers Mister Stark a friend, but there doesn't seem to be anything but platonic affection there.
him to, even though his voice is so soft and husky and warm, it's still a command, and one Steve desperately wants to follow.
“It could happen, you could grow tall and strong, but you have to eat your vegetables, you hear?”  She poked his uninjured cheek and Steve laughed, but the smile soon dropped off his face.  “Ma’, what if I don’t,”  He swallowed, running a hand over his injured knuckles,  “What if I don’t grow, or get strong, how can I be a good alpha?”  Steve remembered sitting in a hospital bed, listening to Sarah talking to a doctor and crying.  He knew his heart was bad, that his body hurt nine days out of ten.  Even in the flush of optimism of his first Alpha rush, he knew the future might not be so rosy.
Will he be old when they meet? Will he be ancient and stooped with age, wintering and faded next to the vibrant life of his soulmate? Because he is vibrant, beautiful and so real and wonderful Steve wakes some mornings reaching for him. Who is he? He wonders. This bright shining light standing at the gates of the future.
“I’m not the one who needs worrying about as it is.” He reached out, clearly telegraphing his intentions, and laid his hand on Steve’s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m worried about you, Cap,”
“Goddammit to hell.” Steve growls. Tony laughs disbelievingly, touching the side of Steve's face with one hand.
“Sure I-okay, yeah It's going to be amazing I'm sure. God I've seen you eat ice cream, their profits are going to increase at least ten percent today.” In the rear-view mirror Happy's eyes catch his when Steve kisses his cheek fondly. Fuck. He's so fucked. Everyone knows he is, he may as well just give in completely. What did Rhodey say again?
“Where are we going?” He asks, following behind Tony without resistance anyway. Tony shoots him a glance over his shoulder, stopping by the elevator and waving his hand in front of the command panel to summon it down to the underground meeting and training areas.
“Cap, you are not going to hold my hand the whole time.” Tony says, eyes widening when Steve just regards him steadily.
He finally gets his shower and then leaves the mansion to find a florist. There's so much variety to choose from, so much more than he remembers. It seems like the seasonality of things doesn't really have an impact on whether or not stores can get things anymore. It's strange and wonderful, but it make his decision on what to bring Tony much more complicated. Countless bouquets and arrangements later he finally gives up and takes out his phone.
As always, Tony’s generosity left him speechless. He didn’t know what to say to that, so he just agreed. He wouldn’t do it again though, he resolved to himself with determination. During the war he’d survived, he wasn’t about to start imposing on Tony regularly just because he couldn’t take it. He would stretch the wonderful light feeling within himself for as long as he possibly could. After that, well, there were always his water bottles and the blankets.
“Enough of that, handsome, I don't want to come just yet. Fingers out, and I'll show you how I like it. Are you ready, honey?” Tony says tightly, as if it's taking him a great effort to speak. For a moment Steve wonders if something is wrong but then feels a hot spike of arousal when the words register. He almost made Tony come with his fingers, he made him feel that good, and he can make him feel even better now. Tony knows, Tony will show him how, and he desperately wants to earn Tony's orgasm, to be allowed to give that to him.
Tony groaned, and continued on with an air of grand drama, “Of course, of course they did, they live to torment me, I swear, my own personal demons.”
“You're all my favorite, I love all of my children equally, Sam-” Sam flies by with a whoop.
Ty, it could be any number of his enemies-that can get past his biometric scans. God, it has to be Ty. The Avengers have better things to do than clean up his messes.
“As long as you want.” Steve answers, sweeping his hand through damp curling hair.  Tony smiles, eyes drifting shut.
Steve seems to agree, sweeping him in with one hand, deepening the kiss so effortlessly that Tony wonders if he was taking notes while they made out on the couch last night. That thought seems less important when Steve uses his grip to hoist Tony a little higher-making his feet leave the ground. It shouldn't be this hot, and typically he might balk at being so easily moved around, but this is
“Your pacemaker-” Steve says suddenly. “You rubbed your chest a lot while you were sleeping. Does it bother you?”
“You don't have to fight this all on your own Steve. Baby. Look at me.” Steve looks up, lets Tony kiss him and press soft touches all over his face, lets that perfect affection loosen his grip around Tony's waist. “Anitha Acharya is a fantastic therapist, her specialty is loss, let her help you.”
After Jarvis left, Steve took a sip of the tea.  It was chamomile as he had thought.  It was sweet though, with a soft herbaceous wildflower honey in it, and a hint of lemon.  Steve drank it all, and then refilled the mug with more.  It took some tweaking, but he got the fresh cup tasting the same as Jarvis’ version.  He drank it slowly, until just the dregs were left, the heat ebbed away, and then he dragged himself off to the bathroom to finally take that shower.
Tony smiles, leaning up to kiss Steve's forehead. “Don't be embarrassed. I'm glad you asked, because I'd want you to be the one too, or maybe Thor.” Tony says with a thoughtful pause that Steve shares. What can he say, big and blond is his type when it comes to men.
“Gonna, die.” He moans, as Steve's hips grind up against him, as Steve pulls their bodies together and erases every thought from his mind except how they feel locked together.
The next few days were calm, however, which was a good thing and a bad thing.  Good, in the sense Steve was happy no civilians were being terrorized or property was being damaged.  Good also in that in his spare time he’d found an art supply store and bought up more supplies than he ever would have dreamed of during or before the war.  It was an astronomical sum of money to spend on a hobby, but it was something to do in the long hours of the night when sleep eluded him.  But it was also bad in the sense that Steve couldn’t relax even more than usual.  As he laid there desperately striving for sleep, unable to even concentrate enough to paint, he wished suppressants affected him in some way.  Back in the war, he’d tried them on General Phillips’ behest while they tested where his new biological baselines were.  All different combinations and all different doses.  They all did a whole lot of nothing, his body burned them out faster than he could take them.  Or the doses required made him violently ill for a few hours before blowing away like so much smoke.
By the time he made it down to the gym, scrubbed clean and presentable in his uniform, Hawkeye and Widow were already throwing each other around the mats.  They opened ranks to let him join in, and soon the three of them were engaged in a free for all of trash talking and pulled punches.  It was a heck of a time, he was even winded after it was all said and done.  All of them were in fact.  He felt over aware and hyper focused, but it was better than feeling his heart race while he tried to sleep, and it had been fun, sparring with members of the team with no danger at hand, no real risk.
Zemo had escaped prison.  Steve picked up the paper with shaking hands.  The headline seemed to taunt him, the bold black letters made his gut churn.  He should have killed him when he had the chance.  He shouldn’t have shown mercy, and now that maniac, that killer was out free, enjoying his life.  The paper ripped in half between his hands as the drop hit him suddenly.
“Be safe Steve, I'll give you a kiss if you win.” Tony says, completely serious.
He's so focused on getting Tony to his room that he almost misses the soft sleep slurred words Tony mumbles into his chest. “Wow muscley.” Steve goes a little pink in the face as he feels a clumsy hand pat at his chest tiredly.
“God, stop. Enough. Ty isn't even
“I, Tony-” He's standing in front of Tony before he can catch up to his own intention to move. It has been three months since they started this; Steve has faced down countless enemies, but somehow laying himself bare is so much more frightening. “Tony, oh
They didn’t talk about it after that.  Tony sat by his side working and eating while Steve leeched what warmth he could get.  By the time he went to his room, Tony’s shirt was semi undone again.  Steve didn’t comment on the scar again, Tony clearly wasn’t ready to talk about it, if he ever would be.
“Wha-”
“I'm sorry I didn't mean to...that must hurt.” But Tony doesn't look like he's hurting at all.
“I always find soup wholly unsatisfying unless I have at least a few crackers with it.  Jarvis always makes faces, but he likes marmite, so he can’t be trusted.”  He sat back, swung his legs, saying nothing while watching Steve making his way through the delicious broth with all the determination of a soldier on a mission.
Happy grins knowingly, and Tony pointedly does not make eye contact, choosing instead to fiddle with his watch.  The armor bracelets sit cool and comforting around his wrists, Iron man will shadow them from high above. Never let it be said that he and paranoia don't go hand in hand. He's paid for trusting the stars to align before. Never again. That he's even letting Happy drive is a huge concession. Last time someone else was in the driver's seat-Tony shakes himself from the thought. He's not going there tonight.
He got no sleep that night, and when the drop finally hit him in force, it left him sweating and panting for hours.  He took a shower right before dawn, and went for a jog around the city.  He jogged as far and as long as he could handle.
make those kinds of faces at Steve, not matter what Jan says when she thinks he's not paying attention.
“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,”  He swore, bracing his hands on the counter and leaning over it.  He was not going to go to his room and bring himself off just because Tony’d let him put a pair of cufflinks on his shirt.
"I'll give you as long as you need, just relax sweetheart.” Steve says, solicitous even as his dick leaves trails of precome over Tony's ass. Tony shifts, twisting his torso, and Steve helps, bracing one arm on the mattress, and curling his free hand over Tony's jaw, angling them together for a slow searching kiss. Steve's mouth is so hot, lips swollen and flushed with blood from eating Tony out. The thought makes another kick of arousal course through his frazzled nerve endings, and he can't help the shiver that works down his spine-can't help rocking his hips back to feel Steve sliding against him, filthy and wet at the head.
Steve clears his throat, using gentle tugging motions to bring him over to the couch. Steve is always so careful with him. His touches seem to come with such an awareness of his own strength. It's kind of endearing, and it kind of also makes Tony wonder what it would take to make him be a little rougher.
an Avenger, and he got out of Afghanistan by putting a reactor in his chest and burning a swath of destruction through the desert. Tony's tenacity is one of the many things on the long list of reasons as to why he loves him-not to mention the whole 'kidnapping is morally abhorrent' aspect of the suggestion.
“Trade you one of my reindeer for one of your snickerdoodle penguins.” Steve feels it's a fair trade, but Tony turns to look at him, eyes narrowing slightly.
“Whaddya want me to tell him to get him to help?”  The chief asked, already nodding to people off-screen.
“What about this, you contact him, and we run a trace, we go to him and take him out.”  Steve suggests, hoping against hope that Tony will take it as the reasonable suggestion it is.
hear Tony's breathing. Healthy lungs don't sound like that. Still, Steve knows what it's like to be underestimated, to be sidelined. If Tony ever does come out and tell the team no one will deny him spot, he's earned it a thousand times over. Steve will make sure of that even if he has to give a few stern talking to's.
“God I want to.” Steve says with feeling, catching Jan's sympathetic gaze and sighing morosely.
“Estimated time of arrival is forty minutes with current conditions.” A voice said from the car’s speakers.
Steve is silent for a moment, just rubbing his thumbs over the tiny scars on Tony's knuckles. How they came to be there is a mystery to him, but he's obviously the sort of guy that works with his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ooh, brave, c'mon Steve, plant one on me!” Behind them Steve can hear the other Avengers cat-calling and yelling, but that doesn't matter when he cups Tony's cheek and tips his face up. Tony's breath stutters a little, lashes fluttering when Steve adjusts the grip of his other hand; slipping his fingers just slightly beneath the back of Tony's sweater to graze over warm skin.
He thinks, as they settle in to watch something Sam picked for this evenings main event.
“Codladh sámh mam.” Tony hears as if from far away. The room seems to stretch, the aisle lengthening, and tony needs to reach him, has to reach him.
He's on his knees in cargo hold just by a stack of Clint's ammo, Clenched in one hand is another arc reactor. It's wow. A lot bigger than Steve thought it was. He wonders how thick the chest plating of the armor must be, the dimensions look impossible. Over the comms his breathing sounds shattered, nothing like the relative calm Iron man has maintained up until this moment.
“No.” Tony says somewhat petulantly at being caught dropping eaves. Technically it's not, after all it's not as if they don't know he's there. He
Tony blinks, chewing on his bottom lip thoughtfully.  “Play with my prostate enough and I can get hard again...maybe. Not just yet though.” Tony smiles somewhat faintly, patting his jaw comfortingly, but that soon gives way to a familiar look of curiosity.  “How many times can you come?”
“Oh that’s not fair, turning that against me.  You dirty cheat.”  He said with a groan, but he sounded fond.
“No” Tony growls, at the same time as Natasha says yes. The pair of them glare at each other. Beneath his hand, Tony's skin feels far too warm. His cheeks are flushed, and there's a slightly wet sound invading his breathing.
Tony snickers at the pun, but doesn't bat an eye as Steve takes one long fingered hand between his own; pressing it between his palms, and slowly working at the tension he finds. Tony's hands are well kept but covered in tiny scars from years of work. The palms are broad, still narrower and smaller than his own, but undoubtedly strong. Steve knows these hands by heart, he's sketched them so many times they could almost be his own, and he's never looked at his own hands with such attention to detail.
“Green, s-sweetheart, so green,” He hears himself almost as if from far away, the words are low, raspy, as if pulled from him. Tony kisses his cheek, then lays down half atop him, slipping a leg between Steve's thighs and kissing his neck, his lips, anywhere within reach. It feels so good, having Tony so close, the feeling of his warm skin, the weight of him there pressing him into the bed.
“Nah, here.” Steve strips off that soft leather jacket Tony was admiring earlier to wrap it around his shoulders. Tony tries to control the expression on his own face, but it must show at least somewhat, because Steve smiles, cupping his jaw and thumbing over his kiss swollen lips.  “Yeah.” Steve murmurs, cheeks pinking a little when Tony slips his arms into the sleeves and does up the zipper. “I like that. Looks good on you.” The jacket is still warm and smells of well worn leather and Steve.
Steve fills his water bottle, capping it and then setting it on the counter before slowly making his way over to Tony. He stands at his side for just a moment, considering how to approach this before JARVIS quietly breaks the silence.
“Tony.” A soft voice interrupts his dozing.  It's gone quiet, but Clint's alive, or at least Tony thinks he is. Tony blinks, the room is empty save for the two of them. He must have fallen asleep again-the vague impression of dreams remain, but Tony lets them slip away. The glasses are slightly askew on his face, making everything tilt slightly, with a tap to one of the hinges they fold up as they're removed so he can carefully toss them over onto the coffee table.
“Oh, I would like.”  Tony said softly, quietly.  He closed his hand around the cufflinks, held them close to his body.  “So they’re for me?”
takes that title, but we can't have it all.” He says, watching Thor spin across the dancefloor with Jane.  JARVIS just hums thoughtfully in response.
“We still need a plan to catch that Stone asshole.” Steve grumbles, pulling Tony more tightly against his chest. Tony lets out a strangled laugh, burying his fingers in the short blond hair at the nape of his neck.
A low elegantly appointed couch offers a cream colored backdrop to the man curled up against it. Three glass tablets covered in scrolling data are tossed haphazardly on the floor. It looks like Mister Stark has fallen asleep in the middle of working on something. Steve blinks down at one of the slim pieces of glass, noting something that looks to be the sketched out lines of Steve's uniform. The rest of the tablets are incomprehensible, but that's not what has Steve's attention.
“What.” Steve says softly, dangerously.
He had thought it then, he still thinks that now.
Cap-” He gasps, head hanging back down and hips rocking back into the slide of the plug within him, arching when Steve twists the base and rubs his hand over the soft skin between his cheeks, panting and flushing when Steve reaches further down to put deep pressure on his perineum. It's a beautiful sight. Tony's always gorgeous, but when he's gone on the moment like this, he's something spectacular.
“But true.”
“Oh,” Tony said, “I was taking suppressants, but I had to stop taking them recently.” That made a certain kind of sense. He supposed an eligible omega like Tony was inundated by countless suitors. Maybe the anklet was from one, an overture, a request. One Tony saw fit to go off the medication for. It happened a lot in his time too, it was normal, coming off suppressants when a person was ready for a family. He tried not to feel sad about that, that he might’ve lost his chance before he ever even knew there was one, if there had ever in fact been one. Unless Tony wanted to be part of a triad-and God he was getting way ahead of himself.
“Yeah, guess so, we're going fishing in the morning.” Steve murmurs against Tony's ear.
“I miss you too Steve.” Tony says softly. “I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.”
She leaned forward to whisper conspiratorially.  “You’re welcome, and for what it’s worth, I think your intended is one lucky guy.”  This close he could tell she was an alpha.  That gave him more confidence in the gifts, if she thought they were good ones, he supposed she’d know, and she hadn’t judged him for wanting to court a possible alpha.
“Mmm, that’s absolutely lovely darling, perfect and precise, just like my man.”  The smile is evident in his voice, and Steve can’t help but redden a little bit to hear the praise Tony always lavishes him with.  When they first got together he used to think the praise, the pet names, were all a put on; but Tony really means it all, the sweet names and the glowing regard.  No one has ever treated him this way. Like he’s something good, like he’s something
for the fabulous commission!
“Don't objectify me Tony.” Steve says, patting the seat behind him. Tony laughs, hopping onto the motorcycle and immediately pressing close, arms wrapping around Steve's waist. The press of his body is warm, as is the cheek he leans against Steve's shoulder.
“Stay, sleep here?” Tony whispers sleepily, as if Steve was planning on being anywhere else.
“I'm ready to go back to the mansion if you are. I should have brought a jacket.” Steve says, obstinate as ever. Tony sighs. At this point he knows that arguing with Steve's desire to take any complaint of his as call to action is a moot point. Besides he does not want Steve to worry if he decides to be stubborn. It
“Because a leanbh, I’m an alpha too.”  Her voice was so gentle, understanding, and of course she would understand.
Steve doesn't feel like a legend. He feels hollowed out and heavy enough to sink back to the bottom of the ocean all at once. Maybe a distraction is all he can hope for. There is really nothing else he
planning something. I thought you knew this.” He squeezes the plush against his chest, looking down at it contemplatively, tracing over the embroidered hearts it sports for eyes.  “Steve, I know you're bent on this courting business, but I want to give you gifts too.” Tony says, and Steve sighs, leaning in to rest their foreheads together. This close the faint flecks of silvery gray are visible in his irises. Tony swallows reflexively at the gentle touch of Steve's fingers rubbing at the nape of his neck.
“Oh, you sure you don't want it?” Tony asks, turning to look at Steve.
“Yeah, that's right, cause I'm sweet on you.” Steve says, completely unabashed. Tony just can't with this man, it's so sweet, and dorky, and unrehearsed. He starts laughing, dropping his head down onto Steve's warm chest. Beneath him Steve is laughing too, but they both go quiet when Steve sweeps the hand not currently wrapped around his tie down Tony's back. He's not sure which of them sucked in a sharp breath, but the mood changes between them. The levity is still present, but there's an awareness there; in the way Steve's eyes are fixed on his lips, in the press of strong fingers just against the small of his back.
He hates that there are still memories battering around of those same hands helping him up and helping him stand firm more times than he can count. He hates that he loved anyone enough for it to skewer him so completely when they inevitably turned on him. He learned the hard way that the universe did not reward Tony Stark's trust.
“Thank you.”  He said quietly.  “It’s just a lot to take in, you know.  All of this,”  he gestured expansively around, “I went to sleep and I’m on another planet it seems like.”  He was proud of himself for how steady it came out.  His insides felt shaky, unsettled, even with the soup warm and filling him up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Always like your hands on me Cap.” The cheeky little grin makes Steve feel like he might be going mad.
“Well, honey, not exactly.  They have to touch a person first, and even then, they can’t tell exactly what you’re thinking about.  Just feelings, that kind of thing.”  Sarah said, while she shrugged out of her coat and then layed it over Steve’s shoulders.  Steve blinked, tugging it closer around himself, but still remained focused on the questions he had been dying to ask all day.
"I'm peachy, just a tech swap, you're the one with the broken bones here.” That might be so, but something about the reactor niggles at his subconscious. It's just too
Tony squints, glancing up at the ceiling. “Jay, projection ratios, you know 'em, put something on so little Timmy will go to sleep.” The ceiling above them shifts with light, and soon a movie is playing out-something with felt looking animated animals, Santa's elves, and a reindeer named Rudolph.
for someone to sit with him in this huge empty room. There's ice behind his eyes when he squeezes them shut, burying his face in the cool cotton of his pillow.
“Call him Tony when you move him. It is familiar.” JARVIS suggests.  Steve nods, clearing his throat and trying again.
“No, not at all, although that would depend on your definition of trouble.”  Dr. Erskine still sounded slightly amused, enough that Steve figured he wasn’t about to be clapped in irons.  “I have an opportunity for you to serve your country but,”
Even missing almost his entire life, he builds things while he lays in bed; designs engines and schematics that glow with blue light while pacing around his room. The people who come in to see him seem to sense his boredom, so it's obvious that this all consuming restlessness is nothing new. They're apologetic, but they tell him it's for the best if he stays inside until more is known about his condition. Tony trusts them, he tells them so when they filter in one or two at a time. The admission seems to shock all of them-save for Pepper. Tall and red haired, she and the big tall blond named Steve are in the room with him most often. JARVIS the AI is with him constantly though, but even the AI he
No, non lo sono, la nonna era uno squalo e lo sei anche tu.-No I'm not, Nonna was a shark, and so are you.
“Um. Yes? Was that even a question?” Tony pauses. It's not warm outside anymore. “Need to get a jacket though if I'm going to be hanging off of you like I intend to.”
“Yeah no sweat, go ice your arm, I'll be in the hold, got the-” He sucks in a breath when the reactor buzzes a little more loudly. “spare in a safe here.” Steve nods despite not wanting to leave, helping Iron Man up into the plane before closing the doors to the hold and going for an icepack from the first aid cooler near the cockpit. From behind the doors a loud clatter sounds, followed by a heavy thump. Steve's head jerks up, his feet carrying him over to the doors of the cargo hold almost before he's processed his own intent.
“Still need to get him outta here though.” Bear puncher says, catching Tony's intense stare and clearing his throat. “I'm Steve, we work together.” After that, everyone else introduces themselves to him again. Not that he remembers them doing this before, but it's obvious this has happened more than once.
“Thank you, and, I feel I have to say, Tony is correct,” She shot him a little wink, “that is a sentence of at least ten years in the Dakotas.”
“Well,”  Tony said, he looked pleased, “funny you should ask.”
Sometime in the intervening hours between the ceremony and the after party-which Tony refuses to call a reception-Tony ends up on the opposite side of the lounge. Steve leans against the bar and watches the motion of his lips, the animated gestures of his hands, and the dark swoop of his hair where it has gotten just long enough to curl over his cheek.
AND A MILLION THANKS to
“Can I-” He starts.  Stark blinks, looking over at where Steve is reaching towards the little sphere of light.
He sighs, wrapping his arms around Tony and listening to the water cascading into the tub, content to let himself float in this warm golden place until Tony urges him to move next.
“Boy that's rich coming from mister, jump on the back of an inter-dimensional monster while sporting a broken arm.” Tony mutters.
“No-but I might just be tempted to spank you.  But that’s hardly a new temptation, truth be told.”  Tony answers, raising one eyebrow in challenge, head tipped to the side consideringly.  Steve goes hot all down his chest, unsure if he wants to say ‘yes please’ or hide under the table.  He settles on stubbornness instead.
“I haven't, wasn't something I really had time to explore, but I knew enough to know the idea interested me.” Steve doesn't even hesitate, even if he does get a little bit more red around the ears. Tony is impressed.
General Phillips was a story in himself, stern and eagle eyed, he watched over all the cadets in a way that made even the cockiest of them pause.  Steve didn’t know what he was looking for exactly, but he and Dr. Erskine often stood watch while the cadets all trained.  Steve knew enough about the military to know generals typically did not pay a whole lot of attention to cadets, but it was clear he and Dr. Erskine were highly invested.  They didn’t say much, and it was unnerving as all get out, but it definitely made Steve try even harder, put his best foot forward, for what it was worth.
“JARVIS?”
“If he finds out I'm Iron Man-”
Steve lets the shield fly, slapping the hand away with a sickening crunch of chitinous tissue. It hisses at him, coiling around Tony, serpentine and constricting, and Steve can't lose him to some monster. He springs off of a tree, landing on a black scaly shoulder and slamming the shield down into the joint.
He thought of fucking Tony too, he couldn’t help it, even if it wasn’t possible.  He stroked himself faster, thrust into his own hand, he didn’t even need lube, he was leaking all over himself, making a mess of his hands and the sweats.  Tony would be so tight, the way the few alphas who’d gotten ambitious had been.  He imagined pushing Tony’s legs up, hooking his elbows under Tony’s knees, holding him open, fucking him slow and steady.  He would be careful, keep a hand on himself to keep from getting too deep.  He had the self control, if somehow his knot formed he’d keep that hand steady, wouldn’t even let Tony feel the suggestion of it.  Tony would be so good, so sweet and warm, he’d tell Steve it felt good, that his overlarge cock felt good, and God if he wasn’t an alpha, if he
The villain as it turns out to be is something better suited to a mystery novel. Steve has investigated strange happenstances before, but thus far has avoided being on a train since waking in this new century. It seems his luck has run out. Despite the fact that they have their own nicely appointed compartment, and this track is neither snowy nor particularly secretive, Steve feels frozen through.
“But that's so...clinical, don't you think?”
“What am I supposed to do? What use is a man out of time to all of you?” Steve licks his dry lips. What is he compared to a team of superhumans? What is he compared to something-someone like Iron man? Maybe he is a man beneath the armor, but the armor is
“Yeah, tell me what you want Steve, you can have it, have anything.” Tony says hotly, eyes going wide then dropping nearly closed when Steve leans in. His head tips back, lips parting, hands going up to tangle in Steve's hair.
“Goodnight sir.” He hears JARVIS whisper just as he's dropping off to sleep. Maybe JARVIS isn't as angry as he thought. Tony smiles, and lets exhaustion drag him down.
“Can it parakeet boy, everyone better pay the piper with a smooch or it's bad luck. And to sweeten the deal you get a piece of candy per kiss.” Tony does a little spin for effect.  Clint's dancing pauses.
How Rhodey manages to sound smug via text is an ongoing mystery, but he's sure JARVIS had something to do with it. JARVIS is fired. Rhodey is fired. Are the two of them talking about him?
“Not my secrets to tell. The worst are out of his life though, if that makes you feel any better.” It does and it doesn't. On the one hand he's glad they're not around anymore. On the other hand it means there's nowhere for his energy to go.  Not that he would have hunted them down or anything like that, but it would have been good to have names, so if they ever turned up at the mansion like what the cat dragged in, Steve could show them the door.
” It should be ridiculous, Steve asking him permission for everything, but it's not. Everyone always assumes that Tony Stark is always ready and willing for anything. The truth is, Tony values his lovers' consent and pleasure above all else, but people have always made a lot of assumptions about his own.  He should have known Steve would be different here too.  Tony doesn't quite know what to do with all this care and affection, but clinging to it with both hands seems to be the best course of action.
“Um. Excuse me? Of
That night he slept with the hot water bottle wrapped in towels again.  It was a fitful night, sleep  not coming easily, and the majority of the night spent tossing and turning, with Steve waking from half formed dreams and nightmares.
Tony shrieks in a truly undignified fashion, limbs starfishing out before he's pushing at Steve's head, dissolving into uncontrollable laughter. It's a sound Steve has heard so rarely from Tony that he can't help but inhale and blow another on the warm skin of Tony's stomach.
“Nothing appears to be amiss sir.” JARVIS says after a short silence. Tony looks over the results, scanning over information as quickly as possible. Everything looks in order. “However, the handwriting matches that of Tiberius Stone. Would you like me to notify The Avengers
Tony Stark just might be the only man on earth more stubborn than even him. It's a daunting prospect.
“Can I give you a hug? For luck and all. I know you do this kind of stuff all the time, but I gotta show a little appreciation.” Steve really is completely unaware of his effect on him.  Tony laughs, wondering yet again how a man like Steve Rogers can be real.
“Oh, yeah it is, Natasha said you liked it so I went to the bakery down the street she suggested-” Steve says with slight hesitance, probably because Tony is staring. Natasha is getting the biggest fucking bouquet of flowers he can find. It's going to look like a queen's garden. Tony
“You, you have had a first kiss before though right?” Tony doesn't know if the answer will change things for him, but he'll cross that bridge when they come to it.
“Your car talks.”  He said, looking over at Tony, who shrugged.  “Of course your car talks.”  Steve slid into the driver’s seat, looking at all the buttons and glowing dials.  It wasn’t too bad, there was still a gearbox with a shifter.  He’d been reading about new cars, automatic transmissions were around back in the twenties, but they were far too rich for most people’s blood.  This car was an automatic and then some.  A little button started it, he’d read about that.
“It was, you're a wreck Shellhead.” He notes with satisfaction, cutting Tony's affronted ranting off before it begins by sliding down Tony's body to drag his tongue through the mess on his stomach and chest. The taste is bitter, but not bad at all, and it's worth it for the shocked sound it punches from Tony's lips.
After dinner, Steve went to his room.  He could feel the drop coming.  They had won the fight with Kang, but there were too many close calls, too many variables unaccounted for.  He felt there was more he could be doing.  The sight of the armor unmoving and their comm links with Tony silent still sat ill with him.  He knew Tony was fine, had said he was fine, as were the others, but he just couldn’t shake it, that feeling he wasn’t doing enough, wasn’t protecting the team as well as he should be.
“I'm sorry you're sore.” He murmurs, coming up behind Tony to pull him into a sort of backwards hug. Tony laughs, leaning his head back on Steve's shoulder to press a warm kiss over Steve's cheek. Steve's arms tighten around him, the sleek weave of his suit feels decadent compared to the simple cotton of his own worn army tee.
“I'll see you at the meeting in the morning Tony, bright and early, don't go back down to the lab, you hear me smart guy.” Steve says, it lacks his usual smooth delivery, but Tony chooses to ignore that.
“Okay, okay I hear you, just relax, breathe.” He says, giving himself an extra stroke of slick before setting the bottle back down on the desk.
“Hey winghead, it's okay, really.” He says gently, reaching out to take Steve's hand where it has balled into a fist at his side.
“Mm, you
“I’m sorry.” He said, sitting up straight on the couch, trying to make himself look strong, like the kind of alpha Tony didn’t have to worry about. “It won’t happen again. I think I’ll be fine now.”
Steve wakes on a chilly Saturday morning to an empty bed. It's not unusual for Tony to be gone in the mornings. Sometimes he's still down in the lab, other times it's because he awoke some time during the night with ideas buzzing through his mind. It wouldn't be unusual, however, Steve has been gone for the last week on a mission with Natasha. Typically when he returns from one of those, Tony greets him with a whirlwind of kisses and wandering hands. He had not even stirred when Steve crawled into bed with him last evening.
“Well, most of it, darling, I'm afraid the jelly is store-bought, and the muffins as I said.  I thought you might be hungry. You slept a while, longer than usual-” Tony holds his hand up when Steve opens his mouth, pressing a kiss against Steve's cheek.  “and I'm glad you slept so long, it was absolutely perfect seeing all of you here stretched out in my, bed honey, it's always a treat. You're wonderful, sleep as much as you like, and-”  Tony picks up a fork, bringing a good sized bite up to Steve's mouth “eat as much as you like, if you want more, you can have it. You can always have more, sugar, you only have to ask.”
“Buck c'mon"
“That’s gotta sting.”  Tony said over the coms, and socked Enchantress with a repulsor blast while Wasp flew down with her Wasp’s sting to deliver the finishing blow.
“Hats? What sort of hats, is this one of your Midgardian customs?” Thor asks, curiosity evident in his tone.  Tony nods solemnly, reaching into one of his pockets to produce a Santa hat; plopping the red and white cap atop his own head.
“Hey Shellhead, keep these vultures off your boss.” Steve murmurs, ignoring Tony pulling a face beside him.
“I know you do.” Steve says quietly.  “It means a lot to me though, to bring you stuff, to show you you're my fella. I don't want you to feel obligated to give me gifts.” Steve shakes his head, brushing their lips together.  “I can't give you gifts that will impress you, grand stuff that's fancy enough for a fella like you, but-”
“Hey, hey big guy, you with me?” Iron Man asks, walking over to stand in front of him.  Steve takes a shuddering breath, looking up into glowing blue eye slits.  “You look a little queasy there, feeling motion sick? I have some Dramamine in one of these compartments. Hold on a sec-” Steve watches as several flaps open up on the armor, Iron Man rifles through them, producing various first aid items and a little aluminum pouch. That he passes to Steve who takes it without comment.  “Dried fruit, you haven't eaten in a while right? I know your metabolism.” Iron man points at the little bag, and Steve blinks down at the food in his hands, then up at Iron Man.
Man of Iron. It said you had 'the heart he craves so deeply.' I know not who it is the Níðhöggr referred to, but it has taken an interest in you.”  Thor says, walking over to lay a Hand on Iron Man's shoulder.  Steve wants to find whatever godforsaken space rock the thing has been banished to and beat it to a bloody pulp.
“Can I touch you?” Steve asks, kissing his ear, breath minty where it fans against the side of his face.
“It's okay, I'm fine, the splint works great, and Iron Man set it perfectly.” He hopes it's enough to assuage whatever self imposed guilt Tony has about the whole thing.  Tony tilts his head back, gaze roving over Steve's face searchingly. He's clearly exhausted, dark smudges beneath his eyes, faint pinching around the corners denoting strain. Beneath the comforting smell of woodsmoke Steve catches a whiff of something cool and minty. He wants to ask Tony how Iron Man is doing, to see if he will get a better status report based upon that. There's no doubt in Steve's mind that Tony is probably all bruised up again beneath his soft sweater, and whatever the half shirt is that Steve can feel the lines of when tony pressed close. He keeps his peace though; well aware that Tony guards his secrets as he does few other things.
“Sleep now, I'll be-” Steve's voice is low and rough, cracking with arousal even as he backtracks across the floor. “I'll be here, I um, goodnight. Tony.” He all but runs from the room after that. Tony holds onto his plush tightly, eyes wide in the growing darkness of the room. Well, at least Steve was just as affected as him. He contemplates taking matters into his own hands, but he's just so tired, and it seems crass to rub one out in front of Steve's banana counterpart.
“Oh. My. God.”  Tony groans, turning away to make his way over to the bathroom quickly.  Steve chuckles a little bit when Tony slams the door behind himself with the force of his urgency.
permeates this space.
it. Likes having Tony close, the easy warmth of him there, his quick, clever fingers, and warm affectionate words.
“Iron Man, check in, status.” He kneels beside the armor, helping Iron Man sit up.
crabby. Anyway
“Oh my god.” Tony says faintly from behind him. “No one is
“I always have been rather fond of you darling, I thought it was all terribly transparent, but I guess not.” Tony says, a little ruefully, a little breathlessly. Steve kisses him again.
“So,” She said, “Tony told me you didn’t know, so, in the interests of full disclosure, I’m an omega too.” She said it with such matter of factness, but she still looked a little cautious. He wondered if Tony’d told her how Steve collapsed on him like a giant mess. He hoped not. That hardly served as a glowing endorsement of his worthiness as an Avenger, he thought.
The next time they get called out to a fight it's at the crack of dawn. The sun is just making its way over the horizon, casting long fingers of light across the city. It would be a poetic sight if they weren't currently engaged in a battle royale with one Doctor Doom. High above them Tony is swearing up a blue streak and shooting off repulsor blasts while Hawkeye uses scattershot arrows to hamper the movement of the swarm of tiny insect-like robots currently infesting central park.
“Hear me out, it's scientific conjecture, but supposedly, theoretically, kissing is one of the ways we homo sapiens decide, subconsciously of course, on some deep lizard brain level, whether or not we're compatible.” It's true, but it's also a load of hooey, because in the end this is a purely selfish suggestion. Steve says nothing, staring down at him for a long moment as if mulling this over. Tony tries not to vibrate out of his skin in the interim.
“Yeah well, gotta branch out sometimes, 'sides,
“That would imply I'm ashamed of anything birdboy.” Tony punctuates the statement by wrapping his legs around Steve's waist while leering in Clint's general direction.  “Now you should leave before you get an eyeful of me sullying the innocence of a national icon.”
“Oh god, no he won't, oh wow.” Tony says, just a little faintly-arousal warring with morality for the nth time since this whole throttling business started.
“Stark-Tony.” He croaks out, uncertain with what to do with all this affection, as he always is.
During the second quarter Steve nearly dropped his chips while yelling at the ref about a bad call.  Tony was laughing beside him, yelling cheers and encouragement down to the Seahawks and waving around a big foam finger enthusiastically.  The game was going well for them, a feat Tony said was impressive, given the Patriots’ record.  He was just about to ask Tony where the nacho stand was when a raucous cheer went up around the stadium.
“A letter of intent, how old fashioned,”  She smiled, “and sweet, but alright then, strikeout the glove idea.  Let’s see, hmm, maybe.”  She tapped her chin thoughtfully, walking down to another set of cases, bending to open those up and rifle through them.  “Aha!  Here we are.”  She returned to stand triumphantly before Steve, another stack of boxes in her arms, which she set down and began dividing up.  Steve hoped he wasn’t taking up too much of her time with all his indecision, but she didn’t look annoyed at least, she kind of looked delighted in fact.
When he emerged from his room,  Tony was sitting out in the living area in a button up shirt, dress slacks, and a Seahawks tie.  He had the elegant briefcase from the car in his hand, and he was wearing the cufflinks.  Steve felt his heart rate kick up again.  He smiled wide upon catching sight of Steve, and then guided him down to the lobby with a warm gloved hand pressed to the small of Steve’s back.  It was a sweet gesture, like something a fella might do for another while out on a date.  Steve was sure his ears were a little pink the entire walk over to the stadium.
The villain was some jacked up wannabe dictator named Kang the Conqueror.  Just that name alone made Steve hate him extra.  He claimed he was from the future, and jabbered on about being superior and on and on.  All things Steve and the others had heard countless times before.  Maybe the time traveling business was a little out of left field, but he still didn’t like getting smacked by Thor’s hammer, so Steve could work with it.
“Steve, you finally decided to visit!”  A loud voice called out, and Steve turned to see Lorenzo De Rossi strolling over.  He was an older alpha, with salt and pepper hair and dark, laughing eyes.  He had been at Sarah’s funeral, Steve remembered his ma’ saying he’d lost his only child to the great war.  A tall strapping Alpha girl by the name of Eleonora.  She’d been a miracle baby, same as Steve.  Both Lorenzo and his wife Mia were alphas, so the odds had always been against them to have a kid.  He remembered Sarah retelling the story with great sadness.  Eleonora had made her family proud, she had been a good alpha, but that didn’t make it any easier on her family.
Tony kisses him again, and continues to kiss him until they're in the shower beneath the warm comforting spray of his truly excessive shower heads.  They stay in there for an indulgent amount of time, tumbling back into bed together once they're reasonably dry. Tony cuddles close, offering no resistance when Steve curls around him and traps him against his body.
Steve shakes his head, turning to face Iron Man more fully.  “No. No one else. It's-you're doing fine, more than I could have expected from a futuristic fella like yourself. I bet you've got me all figured out.” He says almost wistfully, smiling slightly when that startles a staticky laugh out if the man. For a few moments there is only quiet between them. It's surprisingly comfortable despite how alien everything else is.
. Tony has no idea what to make of that.
“It's going to be great Tony.” Steve says with feeling, setting his hat and sweater down on the table to draw Tony into a tight hug. Tony melts into it immediately, leaning into his embrace and wrapping his arms around Steve in return. He's warm, and smells of the cinnamon spiced potpourri liberally placed all around the tower.
Still, it felt more empty than he would have liked, as he boarded the quinjet to leave the island. He had no regrets, but the rush was slipping away, leaving only the urgency of rut, and a gnawing hunger he knew would take at least an hour in the kitchen to satisfy. He felt overheated and sweaty, which was slowly verging into cold and clammy as the drop skirted around the hum of rut through his body. Steve dragged the cowl down, grimacing as his damp hair fluffed out into an unruly mess. He probably looked like a dandelion, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
"Unlikely."  Steve snorts.
“Steve, darling, beloved-” Tony moans, pulling away from Steve's mouth, reaching back to lay a hand across Steve's wrist.
“I am assuming you mean Captain Rogers, as there is no one else who meets those particular parameters.”
“She gave me a pseudonym, and I'm not one to take credit where it's not due. She'll be credited first, it's her work that secured this breakthrough. She has all my contact information, and an open invitation to S.I. and all my labs. Although there won't be any profit for this. Any and all people benefiting from this research will receive it free of charge.” Tony says, sitting down on one of his chairs and setting about clearing off his work station.  You rolls over, resting his claw on the table and beeping away. "Yes hello kiddo, I missed you too, where's your brother?"  Tony pats You as he flings plans around, directing him to find Dummy and help with the cleanup. Steve watches the two robots bobbing and picking up cups, and remembers the water treatment plants, the mobility aids Tony was working on not so long ago.
“Well if I'm showing off then we can't hold hands while we skate. You think of that ?” He feels that Tony would call this a well reasoned argument.  Tony's cheeks pink endearingly and he shoots a glare in Steve's direction but it lacks any real heat.
“Sure ya’ are,”  Steve said, smiling, “Only one Tony Stark out there, fella, that makes you pretty special in my book.”  Maybe wearing his heart on his sleeve wasn’t the best way to go about things, but as all the Invaders never hesitated to tell him, he was a lousy liar.
Only the soft whooshing of the doors to the training area opening finally gave him pause.  He turned, wiping sweat from his brow in the same motion.  There was a man standing near the entrance of the gym.  Steve blinked, he was coming closer.
“Oh,”  Steve said, his eyebrows climbing upwards, “how long do I have to pack, when’s the flight leaving?”
“Yeah.” Steve breathes out, laying a hand over the arc reactor to feel it pulsing away steadily. “Yeah it was.”
Natasha is waiting for him when he makes it into his office in the penthouse atop S.I.'s Manhattan headquarters. The reinforced catsuit zipped all the way up to her neck, and the downward tilt at the corners of her lips tells Tony this isn't a courtesy call. He eyes the leather-bound binder on his desk warily, coming to rest his hip against the dark wood. These things are somehow worse if he's sitting down; he prefers to get bad news standing up anyway.
“Tony, oh my god, don't be crude” He laughs out, squeezing Tony close.
“Shellhead?”
Tony is half sprawled across the kitchen table fast asleep. His cheek rests atop one of his ever present tablets, he's wearing the remains of his suit from this morning, only the shirt and pants are still on, the rest of it is probably in one of his shiny flivvers. A half eaten bowl of Linguine and pesto chicken has gone cold where it was obviously set aside to make room for more tablets. Several coffee cups are in various places around the room, as if Tony had been up and pacing-forgetting them there. Math is scrawled across the glass surface of the table-the culprit guiltily indicted by the dry erase marker still clutched in Tony's hand.
“Sorry JARVIS, usually I'd go along with this, but I didn't pull my brother out of the desert not to go to him first when he has some crazy memory whammy going on.”
“Insolence, cowardice! This is why you will never have him, I am sad for you Captain.”
“Hi, um I thought you might like dinner?” He says hesitantly, coming a little closer to Tony as he speaks. There is a steaming plate full of what looks like linguine with capers and pesto chicken, garlic bread, another little plate with some Tiramisu, and a really large glass of water, because Cap hydrates like a fiend. Tony's gaze darts from Steve to the tray of food, back to Steve's face, then over the ridiculous line of his pectorals in that shirt. Tony kind of feels like he needs to go to confession and he's not even religious. He wonders if ogling Captain America is against some kind of super secret military code. Fury probably wrote the memo himself.
“Caught with my hand in the cookie jar I guess, time to fess up then?” Steve said, smiling ruefully. He felt it as his cheeks heated however, hearing Tony refer to him as his favorite hero.
There was a pizza joint where the De Rossi’s gym once stood.  Their pizza was delicious.  He sat in the very back of the place.  The chairs were rickety, and the tables looked like they’d seen better days, but there were pictures all over the walls in black and white, some of them of the gym.  Steve chewed his food and stared back in time until he’d worked his way through the entire pizza, and the guy behind the counter started looking at him with suspicion.
“No, I just-I'm dealing with it.” Steve says quietly, slipping Tony's hand away from his mouth, but not before leaving another kiss there.
at steve, and waved to him and Jan, and then he was gone.
is almost too quiet for even him to hear, but it's a comforting thought that follows him into his dreams.
A million billion thank yous to Blossomsinthemist for her help with info about American Football, and just generally being amazing, ily.
Tony's gaze flicks upwards as he drags his lips, then his tongue over his covered cock again, before pausing to
“Captain America, biggest superhero ever, also part time space heater for Tony Stark, who would have thought.” Tony says; the smile on his face stretching into something real and fond now.
The Maria Stark Foundation gala is upon them before Tony really has time to mentally prepare himself. Maybe he shouldn't be going to a big public event right after something tried to rip his arc reactor out, he's still hurting dully from the bruising, and his nerves have been in a near constant state of uproar since the incident in the Smokies, but Tony has been keeping his mind carefully distracted. He's been too busy trying to find the answer to his nanite issue, SHIELD contracts, S.I. Projects, and keeping his bruises and mortal terror concealed to have an existential crisis about the fact that he's asked Captain America to be his plus one. He wonders if his mom would have approved of Steve, he hopes she would have-in a way this will be like introducing him in spirit. Maybe that's a silly sentimental thought, but he's allowed to be sappy in his own head if he wants to be. That and he there's no way Tony is passing up the opportunity to see Steve in formal wear. Tonight will truly be a test of Tony's restraint.
“You know me so well, go get some rest Shellhead, get yourself checked over too.” Steve grits his teeth to keep from saying more, to pull him back and beg him to strip out of the armor so Steve can run his hands all over him, just to make sure he's whole and alright-but he doesn't, he turns away and takes a shower so scalding hot it almost makes him forget about cold mountain air and the clattering of wheels over train tracks.
“Always do, that's n-nothing new.” His face is probably scarlet by now, but Tony makes no comment, just humming to himself and sitting back atop Steve's legs, eyes roving over his body with a hungry sort of appreciation that has Steve leaking more into his pants. Tony's warm callused hands follow the path his gaze took. One hand slips down into Steve's pants and a loud shocked groan spills from his lips, his head dropping back with pleasure as Tony gives him the barest touch. He's so keyed up already, so attuned to the weight of Tony atop him, the knowing squeeze of his hand around his cock that it takes some effort not to come right out of the gate.
“Where's my good morning kiss Mister Universe?” Tony asks, coming right up into Steve's space-close enough that Steve can feel the slight heat shearing off the armor in waves.
“Steve. My name. My name is Steve.” The wind has stopped howling, and the medallion feels heavy in his hand, an anchor that only seems to be growing more tangible.
“Of course, I would be honored to be your friend. I would be honored to be
“Honestly Cap, he'd probably like just about anything from you, because it's you that gave it to him.” There, Steve is smiling again, and it's not a lie. Tony's been given a lot of things in his life. Cars and watches, and you name it really-but there's few things people have given him out of simple affection. He can count on two hands gifts given to him that came with no strings or stipulations or expectations attached.
“I like the idea of it, but in practice, it just...doesn't work anymore. I'd like to try again someday. With someone I love, with someone I trust. You. If um. If you wanted that.” For all his reputation as a playboy has spiraled out of control over the years, Tony still finds it difficult to ask for things. Showing vulnerability has always left him feeling shaky and off balance. He can hear Howard even now
“I'll bring it to your room okay, you've had a long day huh?” He murmurs warmly.  Tony just mumbles in response, face tipping against Steve's hand as he loses the fight with wakefulness again. Steve sighs, petting over soft curling hair again.  It's easier to coax Tony up this time, as if in this half awake state he still remembers Steve carrying him before. Steve stills when Tony's breath catches, body shuddering in his arms only to curl up more tightly against Steve's chest.  "It's okay, I've got you."  He whispers, even though it's pretty unlikely that Tony really registers the words.
“He is in the music room, I believe he would appreciate your company.” The A.I. briefly illuminates a map of the mansion across his wall, one tiny red dot blinking where Tony must be, and Steve already has the layout of the place memorized, but he appreciates it nonetheless. Steve nods, careful not to make much noise as he walks down to the room in question. The doors to the room are open, spilling light and warmth out into the hall. A roaring fire burns in the fireplace, logs crackle and pop filling the space with rich golden and orange light. Tony is laid out on his side in a veritable nest of pillows with an oversized white crochet blanket draped over his form. Warm light slants over his features, catching on the gleam of his barely open eyes. His palm is pressed against his chest, a lovingly polished violin sits on a stand just beside the pillows. A book of sheet music; old and worn as if it belongs to a time even before his own is propped up on a table nearby, but Tony's gaze is fixed on the fire, clearly lost in thought.
"Tis a fragile thing, trust, and it can be broken easily. Glad I am to see you have his.” Thor says, breaking Steve out of his contemplation of hot tubbing with some of his favorite people.  Thor pauses, looking slightly sheepish. “Once did I try to carry him as you have. 'Twas ill advised, but Lady Jane advised to 'ice it' and then things were much improved.” Steve kind of wants to hear that story, but then Thor is stripping off his silky short robe and tossing it off to stand bare ass naked in the doorway save for a beaming smile.  “I shall have my pleasure now, it was good to speak with you.” Then he's turning around, baring his godly backside to Steve, and God, and the full moon outside the window. Steve wisely retreats down the hall after that. He flushes slightly and tries not to think of Thor's impressive
“Okay, okay, but still, my room, it has a bigger bathroom. You can wait for me in there if you like too.” Tony offers, and Steve doesn't know how he'll handle an entire hour of tension, but he's survived the wait up until now.
Something purple caught Steve’s eye, just out of the range of the adhesive coating the bridge was a man Steve had hoped dead.  Baron Zemo in the flesh, there was no mistaking his ugly lack of mug.  What a cruel twist of fate that everyone he’d ever loved was gone, but here was a piece of Nazi loving human refuse, and he’d survived.  Steve felt that old anger grip him, almost as vivid and intense as it was when his team had been threatened during rut.  He forgot his own suggestion to pick a villain he had yet to clash with, he forgot his own sadness for a moment, shelved it away and took off towards Zemo, using the trapped cars in the road as springboards to get him closer to his target.
The reactor in his chest is a constant pressure, but within two days he learns which positions are comfortable, and which are instantly painful. Something tells him he has learned to sleep with it before in much less optimum conditions, but no one will tell him how it came to be. No one will tell him much of anything in a point of fact-they seem afraid to trigger his curiosity. Tony doesn't blame them, his curiosity is insatiable, almost a will of its own.
“Well, I’m glad you’re a fan of my old tin can,”  He said, sounding just a little faint.  He shook himself, drawing his hands out of his pockets and stepping closer.  He wasn’t wearing gloves, but he had a few rings on, pretty, manicured hands, but they were covered in thin well-healed scars.  “Hi, I’m Tony Stark, and Iron Man, welcome to the Avengers, Captain Rogers.”  He held out his arm, and Steve stepped forward, gripping his forearm.  Tony’s skin felt so warm beneath the fabric of his shirt, the way Steve had imagined it might feel beneath the armor.  This close he could smell the clean minty scent of his breath, and a soft spicy, woodsy scent, the same scent that had been on the heated blanket Tony had so graciously offered him.  Usually, with his enhanced senses, Steve could get a good read on people from a distance, but Tony’s scent was subtler, closer to the skin.  Still, alpha, he had to be, to have strapped himself into such a fantastic suit of armor and stood at the frontlines with the others.  A few of them were betas, but the way Iron Man fought, the way he protected the team, Steve felt a kindred spirit in him.
things Steve. There was a girl there, she was, god, she was just brilliant Steve. Couldn't have been more than sixteen, but her
“Be nice, Hawkeye, it’s just Black Knight, he can’t help looking like that.”  Wasp said, hovering beside Steve’s ear.
Steve wasn’t exactly clear on what it all meant, being an alpha, or a beta, or even, if you had boocoos of luck and turned out an omega.  He did know however, that whatever he turned out to be, he’d have a lot of growing to do for anyone to give him a fair shot.  Steve blinked back tears, firmed his jaw.  The laughter had died down, but scattered whispers still went around the room, glances drifted in his direction.  Steve swallowed, and looked up in time to see it as Russel’s expression twisted into something like regret, but he went back to examining his new gloves, and he wouldn’t meet Steve’s eyes.
“I don't know, you're usually pretty-” Bucky mumbles, almost to himself.
thinks Steve with an impending sense of dread. Oh
By morning he memorized the entire booklet, and felt confident enough to scroll through his contact list.  All of the Avengers were listed within it, their names and their call signs in one.  Steve paced around the room with the phone, and snapped a picture of the strange little box set into the wall, it was covered in glowing lights, and had a drop down panel on it.  Steve was afraid to touch the contraption for fear of breaking it.  The picture was a little fuzzy, but it was in color.  Steve eyed it for a few moments before sending it off to tony with a short text of
man Steve has ever known. Steve loves him so much he doesn't know what to do with himself, so he settles on hugging Tony more tightly, whispering his thanks and praise until Tony is blushing tomato red and scampering off to harass Rhodes about the tiny robotic pea shooters he gave him as a gag gift.
Tony groans in frustration, rubbing a hand over his face and snagging one of his motion sculptures off of a nearby desk for something to do with his shaking hands. They're cold again, nailbeds turning slightly purple with chill. Tony puts the sculpture back down to shake his hands out, rubbing them over his pant legs to encourage circulation. Rhodey stays quiet, sipping his beer and eyeing him patiently.
“I’m nobody special, I’m just a guy from the lower east side, I saw someone that needed help so I helped.”  The words sounded almost far away, his ears were starting to ring.
“What?”  He exclaimed, his ears were burning a fiery red, he just knew it.
Dangerous does not even begin to describe Tony Stark. He thinks, even in his own mind he sounds resigned.
“Mister Jarvis, that’s real generous, but I have my own money now, I can get my own groceries.”  Generous was really the operative word, with everything Tony did.  He opened his house to the team, built them training rooms, funded the team, and he seemed to have an unshakeable affection for and faith in Steve.  It made him feel incredibly off balance, but also grateful, he just didn’t know how to return that gratitude.  He hoped he was making it worth it for Tony, for the team.
“Captain.” It's Thor, standing in the doorway to one of the larger bathrooms in the mansion wearing a scandalously short gold silk robe and a pair of what Jan had called Pikachu slippers. Behind him Steve can see a truly impressive bubble bath slowly coming together. Steve blinks. He supposes two in the morning bubble baths are not the strangest thing he's seen this century.
“Oh sure.” Tony said, his lips twisted downwards again. He looked even more displeased than before if that was possible. “So much so I didn’t even realize you’ve been apparently on edge since the forties.”
Steve sits back in his chair listening to the team banter back and forth. Iron Man-usually so quick to join in and offer commentary-is curiously silent throughout the whole debrief. It's disconcerting to say the least. When it's all said and done Steve pulls him aside to thank him for the save with the bus-full of people.
“Yeah but you're not always able to reach him, I know you've taken some pretty rough hits. You know what you're doing.” Steve has seen Iron Man get tossed around like pinball on more than one occasion. Logically he knows the armor must have intense shock dampening capabilities, but he's seen the bruising, Tony definitely isn't escaping injury, even armored up as he is. There's a part of Steve that desperately wants to keep Tony safe, that wants more than anything to tell Tony that he
