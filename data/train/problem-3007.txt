Sam fixes him with a flat look. “The burgers? The...

Dean stared after him as he left. “What the hell?” he said under his breath. The sting of rejection quietly throbbed in his chest as he turned his gaze to the ocean. What had he done to piss Cas off? Had he really crossed a boundary, or was something else wrong? Cas had been so weird since he’d been back. Shouldn’t he be happy? Hell, telling Dean he loved him was the happiest Cas had ever been, right? That was part of his deal with The Empty!
They stared at each other in the sudden, violent silence. Cas’ face was a mask of frustration and pain.
“She was my world. I loved her more than she’ll ever know...” Again Susan fell silent, this time lost in thought.
He stays there for a moment, gasping for air, his cock still deep inside an angel who doesn’t need to breathe. His fingers card through Cas’ hair.
that Cas is unfathomably stronger than he is, but it’s a whole different beast entirely to be confronted with the knowledge he’s about to be fucked in a way only a powerful supernatural being can handle.
Sensing they were about to be dismissed, Dean swerved into a distraction. “You know, we’ve been on the road for ages. Do you have any coffee or anything like that? A little wakeup before we hit the beach?”
Dean tries to laugh at the dutiful concern on Cas’ face, but he can’t catch his breath enough. He nods weakly and manages, “No words,” before he drops his head back against the wall while his brain finishes rebooting.
“I’m just making a snack,” Cas huffed. His irritated sulk did nothing to cover up the unmistakable suspicion of his body language, nor the panicked flicker in his bright blue eyes.
“Most of it.” A faint twinge of wistfulness colored Susan’s words as she looked over the porcelain figurines. “My Marcy liked to collect the angels, but that was years and years ago.”
Cas’ entire face lit up. His eyes were brighter than the sky outside, and Dean was momentarily awestruck. “Good. That’s…” He laughed a little, and Dean’s smile warmed at how endearingly flustered Cas looked. “Good. Great!”
Cas moans again and goes back to kissing and licking his way down Dean’s thick cock, but Dean shakes his head and tugs lightly at his hair. “I want more.” He takes himself in hand and pushes the head of his cock against Cas’ lips. They part easily. Cas’ eyes are practically glowing with desire and need as he watches Dean, always watching Dean, as Dean pushes himself into the warm, wet heat of Cas’ mouth. Dean sighs. “You’re so good, Cas.”
“That’s quite an undertaking for a newbie.”
Dean smiles down at Jack with such softness that it makes Cas’ breath catch in his throat. His heart swells to bursting. He has loved Dean for a very long time, with all his heart and all his being, but in that moment, watching Dean care for Cas’ own infant son, Cas has never loved him more.
to you?” Cas yells back, and it’s the note of hysterical bitterness darkening his words that makes Dean snap and say what he’s been hiding for far too long.
So Dean didn’t think. He didn’t let his doubts take hold. He didn’t allow his own self-destructive fears stop him. He just acted.
Maybe Cas knew that Dean would screw things up if they got together. Maybe he was trying to pull away from Dean, make it easier to break things off when it all came crashing down.
having this argument again! Also I’m not gay!”
That helped Dean pull out of his self-consciousness a little. “Yeah? Well your voice is nothing like I thought. It’s not nearly geeky enough.”
not now that he was human, with a human’s feelings, and a human’s experience and all of the mess and confusion and resentment that came with it.
” Cas slammed into the door again. His eyes glowed faintly with his weakened Grace. “Telling you how I felt. And you said--” Another crash; the door cracked ominously. “
"What kind of cake should we make?" Jack asked an hour later, as he and Dean pondered every box mix the grocery store had to offer.
one…" Dean carefully unwraps the second burger. "Is there anything sexier than a breakfast burger?" He practically beams down at the golden-brown bun, the fringes of fried egg drooping over the side, crisp bacon peeking out from under the patty.
"I dunno," Dean says with a shrug as he passes Jack the bottle of syrup. He grins. "I kinda like mornings."
“Sketchy porn sites?”
Dean tries not to think about what a big baby he’s being by ignoring this golden opportunity. “He just tastes stuff different as an angel. He’s learning how to pick out the nuance.”
And when the day finally came, Sam almost ruined the moment with his excitement that his prank would finally pay off.
“I don’t know what kind of window we have. Give me the amulet now,” Cas says, holding out his hand. With shaking hands Dean pulls it off his neck and hands it over.
And he did mean sharing a bed. Things were moving so slowly between him and Cas he’d be thrilled just to spoon, nevermind anything else. Dean bit back a sigh as he swept over all of the knick-knacks and decorations, hoping for some sort of clue as to the identity of their ghost. “I’ve gotta say, I love the decor. Is all of this your collection?” Maybe a haunted object? Or a cursed one?
“Charlie,” Cas said, and his heart finally restarted, beating so hard he could barely hear his own voice. He cleared his throat and pulled his hand down. “Charlie, I can’t hear a word Dean is saying.”
“Completely unfounded.” Dean has adjusted to Cas flitting around everywhere with his wings restored, so he doesn’t miss a beat in their conversation. He shifts his way up the mattress to lay his head on his pillow. He’s sore from such a rough ride, but it’s manageable. Hell, it’s kind of hot. He likes when he can feel everything Cas did to him the next day.
“If you’re just standing around, you can at least slice these,” Cas said, his voice steady and calm again, slicing through the awkward silence and Dean’s pitiful thoughts with the same ease as he cut through the apple peels now that Dean had shown him how. He held out a naked apple for Dean.
“No, I mean…” Dean sighed and turned away. He started pulling out ingredients from the fridge to make lunch for everyone. And to gather the courage to say something big. A classic play in the book of Dean.
Marcy screamed in fury and appeared in front of him. She flung him at the dresser just as Dean dispersed her with a forceful swing. He flipped the poker in his hand, readying himself to strike again while Cas scrambled to his feet, lighter freed from his pocket and held at the ready.
Susan pushed back from the desk. “Oh of course! I was about to get some for myself, actually. I’ll be right back.”
“Nah, they’re supposed to all be the same, and I’ve already got the pattern.”
Cas nods. “I can feel it a little.” He stares at Dean’s hand. The shadows beneath it shift.
“I’m trying to say...I’m bi, Sammy.” With trembling voice and tense shoulders, Dean turned around, everything in his face struggling between wide-eyed vulnerability and shutting down and hiding his feelings. His gaze landed on Sam’s shirt.
Not once since you brought me back, have you said
“Dean says if you don’t mind typing, he’d rather chat alone a bit,” Charlie relayed.
Dean reaches for Cas’ face, his thumb gently stroking across his cheek. He holds up the ring. “What do you say, Cas? Wanna go legit about this?”
Dean broke into a grin. “Better than nice! Toes in the sand, drinks with little umbrellas… That’s better than paradise.” He gave Cas’ shoulder a friendly pat. Then--because he could, couldn’t he?--Dean let his hand run along the broad expanse of Cas’ shoulder and gently cup the back of his neck.
Cas narrowed his eyes. “I wouldn’t do that. You know I can’t swim.”
So he waited, patiently, watching Dean and Cas flirt with each other like middle schoolers with a crush, always in each other’s space but too afraid to hold each other’s hand in public.
“Well…I suppose since we don’t have any other options right now…” Cas hedges in perhaps the
He made a beeline for his dresser and snatched the keys off the top. He itched to do something, to get up and move. Maybe he’d take Baby for a drive. Maybe go to that new bakery the next town over, buy himself a pie. As a treat. And he’d get one of those bear claws bigger than your head that Cas loved so much.
Cas pulled back enough to look Dean in the eye. His eyes were glassy. Dean’s didn’t exactly feel dry either.
“Hey,” Dean said, his voice surprisingly husky after a largely innocent kiss.
“Cas, Dean, what’s going on?” Her eyes were panicked, taking in the cut on Cas’ temple and the iron poker in Dean’s grip. Mist followed her words out of her mouth.
Sam paused at the top of the stairs and turned around. Almost like he could sense what was coming, his eyebrow twitched in irritation. Dean hucked a box up to the landing, and Sam fumbled to catch it. Dean flashed a shit-eating grin as Sam read the Trojan label and fixed him with a scowl. “Make sure you wrap it before you tap it, Sammy.”
Cas startles and immediately hunches his shoulders in guilt. He wasn’t expecting to be caught. “Dean.” He looks down at the lug wrench in his hand, and Dean can see the wheels spinning in his head, trying to concoct a cover story before he shrugs and gives up the truth. “I was trying to fix the truck.”
“You sure this is okay, Cas?”
I’d be at diners and think, ‘...maybe? I dunno. Probably not for me.’” Dean pulls his mouth down into a thoughtful frown and bobs his head to mimic his past thoughts. “And then...I’m not sure, I just figured, why not at least try it? All those burgers I’ve had all over the country; I could at least give it a whirl. And it. Was. Awesome!” Dean gently places the bun back on his burger and gives it a little affectionate pat. “Now I can’t get enough of ‘em.”
Yet here he was, baking Dean a pie in the middle of the freaking night. Using his own two hands to make a nice surprise for his birthday. Dean couldn’t remember the last time anyone had done something like this for him. Maybe never. Even Mary’s pies were store bought.
Dean waited while the man ordered a new drink. He tried to check him out, but it was impossible with his oversized trenchcoat swishing around his legs. Well, at least his face was hot. When the barista called out the man’s strange name again, Dean made sure to write it to memory.
bad? Dean was
Dean’s eyes fell back to Cas’ lips. He knew they’d taste like cinnamon.
But this wasn’t very much, right? Just a light hand on the back of his neck. This was about as innocent as things got!
“Then why’d you get two different kinds?”
“A guy can’t grab a bite from his own kitchen?” Dean advanced on him, and Cas pressed up against the counter. Definitely trying to hide something. “Whatcha got going on over here, Julia Child?” Dean tried to lean around Cas, who tilted right there alongside him, but Dean could see flour, butter, brown sugar, and a big bag of apples.
Dean’s profile was pretty locked down, but his header was dominated by a massive black classic car. Cas chuckled at that too. Yes, dreadfully stereotypical.
cause problems. He grabbed Cas’ arm and tugged him toward an unoccupied part of the sand. The weather was a little too temperamental this time of year to attract huge crowds, but there were still plenty of people out enjoying the sunshine.
close, Cas,” Dean practically begs. He clenches around Cas’ cock, hoping Cas can get him across the finish line before he goes soft.
“Cas, this is your home, same as me and Sam.” Cas doesn’t look so convinced. “C’mon man, you really think we don’t want you around?” Dean leans against the side of Cas’ truck to ground himself. “Cas, I want you here.”

"I’m learning for my sister-in-law." Dean stopped typing to make a sign Cas didn't recognize, followed by finger-spelling. Cas must have been much rustier than he thought, because he couldn’t even follow that, but he realized both had to be her name. Dean's eyes softened as he started typing again. About halfway through he laughed to himself, and the grin stayed in place until he hit send.
Cas fumbled with the lighter. “I can’t have you because. You. Don’t. Love me!” It finally lit. Cas threw it onto the painting, sending it up in flames.
Dean wants to push through the night and get a portal up and running as soon as possible. Sam insists they both go to bed, pleading with Dean that he won’t be able to concentrate on the spellwork to maintain it without at least a few hours of sleep.
“Yeah, I’ve got plenty of lead.”

Well. Now
At his family, fed and caffeinated and content, ready to start their days because Dean took the extra time to get things off on the right foot.
Cas raises his head, his brow furrowed in confusion.
The man looked up in surprise, but a small smile quickly appeared on his face, making his blue eyes look even brighter. “No, not particularly,” he admitted in a shockingly deep voice. Dean let it wash over him, dark and earthy as his coffee.
“Dean…” Cas groans, his own voice heavy and molten with arousal. He wastes no time in pulling his fingers free and spinning them both around, pinning Dean against the wall. “Lube,” he commands, and with a shaking hand, Dean pours some onto Cas’ fingers. He lets it clatter to the floor and wraps his arms around the back of Cas’ neck as Cas slicks himself up. Intoxicating need pounds in his veins, tinged with nerves. Deep down he

apron. Dean’s grin widened.
“Keep an eye out for anything suspicious, Cas,” Dean muttered as Susan disappeared down a hallway. “Anything out of place or really old. You know, haunted stuff.” Cas nodded, and Dean covertly pulled his EMF reader out of his jacket pocket and flicked it on. It was silent. They both made a pass of the room, pretending to look around.
“You gonna trust some mommy blogger over me?”
the only point in the entire day when he questions his love for Cas. Just a little bit.
Cas’ hands slid down Dean’s back until they were resting on his hips. “Actually…” His gaze turned wistfully in the direction of the distant beach. “I had a different idea.”

long, cylindrical things in his mouth. It would be quite awful for a ‘real man’ to be interpreted as gay.” The ice in Cas’ blue eyes and the condescension in his voice made Dean hunch his shoulders and tighten his jaw.

tight. Dean chokes out a sob and curls forward, cradling Cas’ head against his groin. “Fuck, that’s so good. You’re so good. Fuck, Cas!” He’s babbling, barely aware of what the amulet is making him say, because the head of his cock is pressed all the way into Cas’ throat and he can’t concentrate on anything else except the wet heat and impossible tightness pressing around him. “Fuck, you’re so amazing. I love you so much.”
Cas read Dean’s response with an arched eyebrow. Another one followed soon after. “Plus she’s gay, dude. Don’t be creepy.”
Really it’s a win-win.
Cas loved him. Dean loved Cas. So why wasn’t he happy? What had Dean done wrong? “Cas, I--”
telling me you did. Telling me that the reason you couldn’t even tell me how you felt was because being happy would trigger your deal and…” He shrugged.
If Cas was ignorant of Jack’s birthday plans before, he wasn’t for long. Neither Dean nor Jack thought to do much to conceal the contents of their shopping bags when they returned home. Or figure out a way to keep Cas from wandering the bunker. So when he stumbled upon the two of them hauling bags toward the kitchen, both Dean and Jack traded suspicious glances.
Susan curled her hands around her mug, staring into the steaming coffee with a far off look in her eyes. “I was afraid. Of my own feelings. Of opening myself to getting hurt. So I...When Marcy needed me to be honest about how I felt I...I let her down. She got mad...We fought...She ran off. There was an accident, and...Well...” Susan took another deep breath. Her eyes were glassy with tears and heavy with regret. “Today is the anniversary of the day she died.”
Sure enough, Cas’ lips parted as his eyes traveled first down, then back up the almost completely exposed expanse of Dean’s legs.
Cas frowned at the message. He should handle this one. Because if he didn’t, Ed would, and his replies would inevitably stir up drama. Not to mention hurt the newbie’s feelings, and Cas would hate for someone to be discouraged from a new hobby before they’d really begun.
“You’re so good,” Dean whispers as he pets him. “So, so good, my Cas.” And fuck he means it. Down to his very soul, he means it. Cas is good. Cas is loyal. Cas loves. Why did it take a cursed amulet for Dean to finally realize how badly Cas needed to be recognized for it all?
Dean nodded to himself, but even he knew he was full of bullshit. No, Cas would sense weakness there. Feeding his loved ones was, like, page one of the Dean Winchester Feels Guilty playbook.
“This whole street is like friggin’ Candy Land.” Dean eyeballed the canary yellow house across the street suspiciously as they made their way to the front door.
Cas tilted his head as he considered his drink. “It does taste a little grassy.” Dean pretended to gag, and Cas rolled his eyes. “Don’t you get tired of having the same thing every time?”
“You’re a dick.”
“If you’re sure,” Cas says softly. He holds up the necklace with both hands and slowly lowers it around Dean’s neck.
Only then did Cas glance over his shoulder and catch Dean’s eye. Dean bit his lip suggestively, his grin widening, but Cas’ cheeks turned lightly pink and turned his head away. He rubbed at the back of his neck. Nervous, huh? Well that was alright. Dean could lighten the mood.
Dean frowned and said something too. She nodded and leaned over him to start typing.
made?!”
Dean wasn’t even attempting to hide his own smile. He opened his mouth and said something and...silence again.
He stepped in close. Cas raised his hands like he wanted to reach out and touch Dean again, but he hesitated, so Dean settled his hands on Cas’ waist and waited for Cas to rest his hands on the small of his back. “Thanks,” he said quietly. He watched the light in Cas’ eyes soften into something sweet and fond. “For the pie,” he added, the giddiness in his heart making it difficult to stay quiet. He cleared his throat. “I mean, it’s great. It’s…” But Dean didn’t have the words to describe how much it all meant to him. How much Cas meant to him. So he leaned in and kissed Cas again, slow and tender. He smiled when he pulled back, and the grin on Cas’ face made it clear he understood everything Dean couldn’t say.
“No, too early to eat,” Cas grunts by his ear. “Coffee is enough. It smells delicious though.” He tilts his head down to press a gentle kiss to Dean’s shoulder before he pulls away to slouch down in a chair and finish waking up.
The day wound up being more about Jack than Cas. Or rather, Jack doing all the things he loved to do with Cas. There was a Star Wars movie marathon. There was cake. There were more board games than Dean had played in a lifetime. Dean had a sneaking suspicion Cas let Jack win most of them.
to be a way to destroy it. Magic, smiting it, sending it up on a bottle rocket…”
Because when Dean peeked up at Cas’ face, he was radiating so much happiness Dean’s heart ached from it. Today was the happiest he’d ever been. And perhaps tomorrow, if Dean had anything to say about it, tomorrow he’d be even happier.
Cas gave the post an obligatory “like” and scrolled on. Soulmates were nice, he thought. In theory. A perfect match dropped into one’s lap without even needing to get to know each other first. He could see why finding theirs appealed to so many people. But truth be told, Cas wished there was a way to discover his soulmate in someone he already cared about, not a stranger.
Cas laughed. “Yes. Yes, you did. I didn’t realize it at the time, but even then you were making me feel. Mostly confusion,” he added with a wry twist of his lips. “I saved you from eternal damnation, and you repaid me by stabbing me in the chest!” Despite his amusement, Cas’ eyes were overflowing with warmth and affection. Dean could almost read the thoughts going on behind them.
At that moment, Cas realized exactly what game Dean was playing, and stubbornly turned his eyes back to his book, scowling even darker than before, though the effect was ruined by the blush on his cheeks, growing redder and brighter with each passing second.
Cas grabbed Dean by the waist and hauled him against his chest, one hand on the back of his head and the other on his ass, and kissed him soundly. Dean was dizzy by the time they finally came up for air. “You’re right,” Cas growled against his lips, “I’m wrong. But you’re keeping those damn shorts
"Well, not quite. I mean,
screams in Dean’s mind, but he can’t. He can’t. What if he’s wrong? What if Cas doesn’t love him like that? What if Cas doesn’t love him at all anymore? What if Dean screwed it up by staying silent and Cas realized he deserves to be with someone who can provide a simple answer to “I love you?” What if--
So Dean tensed. He thought about going back to his room for a gun, but he knew it was almost certainly one of the other men, probably also searching for a midnight snack. Still, he crept as quietly as he could and peered around the corner, just to be safe.
Cas didn’t wait. He rushed to the front door and threw it open. There, getting out of his giant black car, was Dean. Tall, bow-legged, wearing worn jeans and plaid flannel just like in almost every picture of him on Facebook.
“I told you!” With one final crash, Cas burst through the door and into the room, Dean hot on his heels. They ran for the dresser. “I told you the one thing I wanted, I couldn’t have! That thing was
“Dean…” Cas growled, and just like that, Dean knew he had won.
Cas’ lips were warm against his own, and Dean gasped softly as his hand wound through Cas’ thick hair to cradle the back of his head. His kiss was eager, if not clumsy, and Dean smiled a little as he let Cas take the lead anyway. When they finally pulled apart, Cas’ normally pale lips were flushed pink, and Dean’s soft smile morphed into a huge, affectionate grin.
Dean goes stil while Cas tilts his head at the two of them.. “Who says I’m in love with Cas?” Wait. Is
Dean took the smile as an invitation and sat down. “Whacha get?”
“If it involves you and me and no clothes, trust me. I’m gonna like it.” Dean settles his hands on Cas’ hips and sways with him gently until he feels the tension ease out of Cas’ spine. He places a kiss on Cas' cheek. “And you know me, Cas! If you think I’m about to do something I hate, just rip the necklace off. I trust you.” Those simple words have their intended effect, and the anxiety in Cas’ expression melts away into gratitude and fondness.
It's not long after the smell of fresh coffee fills the kitchen when Sam walks in, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and wearing running clothes like the health freak he is. "Hey."

Dean’s ears burned hot and he dropped his gaze to the table. “‘S just something he said,” he muttered with a scowl.
On the screen, Charlie and Dean were talking. Charlie looked confused at whatever Dean was saying. She leaned in to the camera. “Hey Cas, can you--Whoa. You okay there, man? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“I thought you knew,” Dean called across the distance between them. Cas stopped and turned to look at him. The bitterness in his eyes made Dean’s stomach churn. “I thought you knew,” he said again. He took a step toward Cas. “For years I thought you knew. But, you know, you’re an angel. I thought you didn’t...I thought you
. “What the hell were you thinking!” he scolds at the end of a cold, silent drive back to the bunker.
“Cas!” he called out, but he didn’t see him. Dean started walking faster. He scanned the beach for a familiar dark head of hair and the bright orange swim trunks Dean had picked out for him. “CAS!” He was beginning to fear the worst.

“Look out!” Dean reached for Susan, but he was flung backward by an invisible force. Marcy flickered into existence over him again. “Salt, Susan! We need salt!” he cried out before the ghost clamped its cold hand around his throat. Dean scrambled from his poker, but it had fallen just out of reach. His other hand grappled with Marcy’s, trying to pull it away.

to straighten. When he inevitably found nothing, he forced himself to sit on his couch. His phone lay on the coffee table. No new texts since Dean’s “I’ll be there in about 30,” over forty minutes ago.
“It sounds like you loved her very much,” Cas said, his voice infused with genuine sympathy.
Sam complained that he didn’t save a slice for Eileen, but that was alright. When she showed up that night for pizza and games, she came bearing a tray of rice krispie treats dotted with birthday candles. She didn’t even make it all the way down the stairs before Dean wrapped her in a gleeful bear hug.
, Dean!” Cas yanked the painting off the wall and threw it on the ground, shattering its glass and exposing the paper.
His chest aches with longing, sharp and overwhelming. Cas thought he was past this. Past the days where his feelings for Dean were so strong they threatened to drown him. Past the days when he ever expected more from Dean than the friendship and companionship he was offered. Past the days when simply loving Dean was not enough.
Cas’ expression dips into concern. “Are you sure?”
“I thought you knew! I thought

And before Dean knew what hit him, Cas grabbed him by the arm and hauled him down onto his lap. Dean laughed in victory as he clung to the table with one hand to balance on the tiny stool. Cas planted a hand firmly on his ass to keep him in place.
Dean leaned in and kissed Castiel.
“I found my soulmate!!!”
Cas’ expression melts into something soft and disbelieving.
Dean laughs. “Liar.” He leans in and presses a chaste kiss to Cas’ lips. The second kiss is more sensual. “You want me to tell you how hot I think you are.” He mouths at Cas’ jaw. “How much I fuckin’ love getting down and dirty with you.” He kisses his way up to the special spot behind Cas’ ear that makes him gasp and tremble. “How good you make me feel.”

“Do you own a pig farm?”
Dean leaned in close. “Yeah, but you love it,” he hummed, letting his eyes fall to Cas’ mouth. He licked his lips but resisted the urge to kiss him yet. Dean wouldn’t have truly won until he broke Cas’ resolve entirely.
, but now it was hung up in bright neon, flashing fluorescent lights. Chuck was defeated, there had been nary a whisper of an apocalypse in over six months, Cas was back, and Dean was
“Mighty involved snack for two in the morning,” Dean remarked, undaunted. He kept dancing around Cas until Cas had no choice but to either let him see or shove him away. Cas chose the former, though he rolled his eyes spectacularly. There was a large lump of…well something. It was limp and soggy and had large, visible lumps of butter dotted throughout the flour mess. “Baking?”
The tense, pregnant silences whenever Sam and Dean were alone. The way Dean’s jaw clenched and he swallowed roughly and his shoulders hunched like he was fighting everything within himself to say something important. Something that terrified Dean.
“What’s going on? Why did that...that

Dean stares like he’s never gotten a chance to before. And as he does, a deep, molten desire simmers in his chest. “They’re beautiful. Cas, you’re so hot like this.” He steps forward, hand outstretched. His eyes roam Cas’ wings, drinking in every detail. The air still hums with concealed power, pressing down on his skin and reminding him that Cas is very much not human. Dean grins wide. “You’re so freakin’ cool, Cas.”
going to admit that he actually had done one of those things.
Dean grinned from ear to ear. “What do you think we should do? To the beach!”
“At what point am I no longer banned from the kitchen?” Almost as if on cue, Cas’ voice called out from down the hallway. “Am I allowed to walk past it? I’d like to go into the library.”
“You don’t think I love you?” Dean demanded, because a deadly ghost hunt seemed as good a time as any to have this conversation. Some things were too damn important to wait for downtime.
Sam was too busy laughing to respond. He doubled-over, clutching his stomach, his shoulders shaking.
Dean rolls his eyes a little. “Well whatever he is, he’s yours. Look. He’s even got your eyes.” His smile morphs into a playful grin, and despite how tired he looks, his face glows with affection. For Jack, for Cas himself, Cas isn’t sure, but seeing Dean like this, something inside him snaps, and he can’t hold it in any longer.
"Well...I can't fault someone for enjoying a good pickle burger," Sam says slowly. He doesn't meet Dean's eye, keeping his gaze down as he delicately stabs at his salad with his fork. He frowns at the cucumber slice he spears and carefully dislodges it from the prongs. "Especially if they really like, uh, pickles?" Sam cringes a little down at his greens. Dean can't blame him. It's a sad looking salad.
“That’s very cute,” Cas typed. “Sam is very lucky.”
“Though the bee keeping thing is weird enough to be suspicious.”
“I am,” Cas said, and he winked, but it was so overdone that it was comically adorable rather than suave. Dean was utterly smitten by it. “Unless there’s some sort of ‘real man’ code of conduct that requires you to ask me out first.”
“Usually burn her remains, if anything is left,” Cas said, “but she was cremated, wasn’t she? So something else is tethering her here. Perhaps a locket? Something she cherishes.”
Cas and Dean’s eyes met, and they both nodded. Dean grunted as he pushed himself to his feet, poker still clutched to his chest. “Susan, stay here. Whatever happens,
Dean read the line and said something aloud as he dropped his head. His shoulders shook with laughter. “You’re such a dork.”
“Shit…” he pants. His brain is fuzzy, every nerve zinging with the same kind of high-pitched whine he hears when Cas uses his Grace. “That…” But the amulet’s spell has finished; Dean can’t feel its magic anymore, and words fail him. “Thank you,” he finally breathes, his smile dazed.
“Mornin’ Sunshine,” Dean crooned cheerfully. Cas’ hair was in wild disarray, and between that and his worn, brown sweatshirt and loose pajama bottoms, he looked more like a bear stumbling out of hibernation than a guy just waking up. “Sam already left.”
he was.
“Damn Cas, I think I’ve outdone myself this time,” he said with an impertinent wink as Cas slid the pie into the preheated oven and set their kitchen timer. He held out a bite for Cas. “Try it. It’s awesome.”
Cas hadn’t been back from the Empty for long, only a couple of weeks really. But it felt like an eternity.
there’s one here somewhere,” Dean muttered, swaying his hips ever so slightly.
He hid them deep in his dufflebag in the trunk of the Impala, and no one was the wiser.
Dean first focused on wiping up the mess of cinnamon Cas had made when Dean came in and startled him. Once that was done he chanced a glance to Cas, who was mangling the hell out of his apple with the paring knife. Dean tisked at him. “Man, what’re you doing? You’re gonna peel off your own skin!” Dean reached over and yanked the knife from Cas’ hand. “Who the hell taught you how to use a blade?”
They were working a case on a college campus when he spotted it. A folding table under a colorful tailgating tent with half a dozen young people, many with an eclectic style and bright patches and buttons brightening their clothes. It was, he learned right at that moment, some sort of Pride awareness day, different from the month of June, but to be honest he hadn’t kept up with that sort of information since his own college days. But when he saw the shirts they were selling in their fundraiser he grinned from ear to ear. A devious plan began to form.
“Are you kidding me?! She doesn’t appreciate him! And she sabotaged his chances of doing that Antarctic neurosurgery fellowship by sleeping with his interviewer!”
idea of what was going on with Dean.
Cas shook his head. “Please, Dean.” With one last glance filled with that strange, heartache-inducing emotion, Cas turned and started walking down the beach alone.
face on, and Dean doesn’t want to ruin a potentially awesome sex fantasy by steamrolling Cas.
I’m getting this from the amulet. I really, really want to see you on your knees right now.”
. “What can I say? I like all kinds of burgers. And hotdogs. Tacos. Kielbasa…”
“No,” Cas said simply. Honestly. His bright blue eyes were so close now, but the heartache in them was almost painful to look at.
already have some ideas. And I’ve gotta say, they’re some pretty awesome ideas.” Images flash through his head, alongside an intense desire to make them come true. Not that Dean needs any extra convincing, now that he knows what Cas fantasizes about. “C’mon Cas…” he hums, already pulling off Cas’ belt and tossing it aside. “Fuck me against the wall. I know you want to.” He taps the amulet with a knowing smirk. “You can do it, can’t you? Big strong guy like you? Wouldn’t even break a sweat.”
and--”
They ran.
Dean scowled. Maybe he had walked back. Running off without a word was infuriatingly in-character for him. Dean cursed under his breath as he hastily packed up their things and started stomping up the beach toward the car.
“Ya know, I think I have one more present for you.” Dean set his glass down with heavy meaning. He nodded to himself and stood up, his jaw set firm, his eyes determined.
Cas comes up behind Dean and rests his chin over his shoulder to watch him cook, like he’s too tired to even bother holding up his own head. Dean has to be careful how he moves his arm so he doesn’t burn himself on Cas’ hot mug, but he’d be lying if he said this wasn’t one of his favorite parts of the day. Cas tucked up against his back, sleep hazy and warm from their shared bed, those beautiful blues blinking owlishly as Dean makes food for their family.
“Come on, Cas.” Dean slots his naked hips against Cas’ clothed ones. Cas’ erection is straining against his dress pants. He ruts against it a few times before stepping back. “Get undressed. And keep your wings out.”
Because otherwise Sam is
“Yes,” Cas said, but there was a twinge of sadness in his voice that made Dean look up. He was smiling softly, but the longing in his eyes was impossible to miss.
Jack tilted his head at Dean, then the box, before a smile bloomed across his face. “You gave me angel food cake once. I really liked it! Is that why you got it for me?”
“And I’m still there, apparently!” Sam flings his hand up in exasperation. Cas quietly takes a sip of Dean’s drink, which for some reason just pisses Sam off more.
Their eyes met, and Dean realized he was staring. He also realized from Cas’ arched brow that Cas knew he was staring. Dean forced a quiet chuckle while his heart skipped a beat. “I mean, I like to experiment as much as the next guy--” He didn’t miss the way Cas’ eyebrows rose up his forehead and flashed him a playful wink--“but I draw the line at messing with my caffeine.”
“I don’t want to,” Cas says softly. The pain is evident in his eyes as they flicker to his truck, like he expects to need to book it out of here at any moment. “But I wasn’t sure if you wanted me here after--” He cuts himself off and shakes his head. “I don’t want to overstay my welcome,” he amends.
Dean smiles, his heart so full it aches. For just a second, he considers crawling back into bed with Cas. Succumbing to his hatred of mornings and going back to sleep with Cas nuzzled up against him like Dean is his personal teddy bear.
Cas scowled at his screen. “Alright. We can reschedule.”
“I’ve been agonizing over this for
With an affectionate smile lighting up his flushed face, Cas steps back so Dean can get a good view. At first, nothing happens, but then the lights flicker, and the hair on the back of Dean’s neck stands on end. Cas gently rolls his shoulders, and his eyes fill with blue-white light as a pair of massive black shadows unfurl on the wall behind him. His wings arch out, glorious and awe-inspiring, covering every inch of the wall and then some, arching up along the ceiling, curling down along the floor.
“It’s fun, okay?” It was hard to tell under Dean’s lighting, but he looked like he was blushing.
with Dean.
“No, you didn’t need to go rushing in like that!” Dean’s worry leeches out as anger, the fear of losing Cas yet again clouding his reasoning that Dean himself would have died without Cas’ quick action. “You could have gotten a
“A honey lavender latte.” The horrified expression on Dean’s face caused Cas to roll his eyes. “Lavender is actually really good in coffee. You should try it sometime.”
you! And you may think that by ignoring it and trying to force things back the way they were before that you can lock up that Pandora’s Box again, but you can’t!
Sam rolls his eyes. “Because there’s so much nuance to ‘extra cheese’ or ‘hold the tomato.’”
“How many Castiels do you know?” But Cas sent him a friend request anyway. Dean accepted almost instantly, and Cas gave in to his own interest and immediately started going through his profile.
Dark thoughts still swirled in Dean’s head as he returned to the bed and breakfast and marched up the stairs.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas allowed a wide smile to overtake his features.
Cas’ eyes narrowed, but he rose to Dean’s baiting. He wrapped his long fingers around Dean’s hand and maneuvered the bite of apple into his mouth. Dean’s heart skipped a beat as he watched his lips move, watched his tongue flick out to catch a speck of brown sugar. Dean’s pulse jumped into his throat.
“Uh...yeah.” With forced casualness, Dean turned the laptop so Cas could read a headline from last year:
"Yeah yeah, have it your way, Burger King," Dean grouses as he pours himself a mug of coffee. He dumps what's left and fills the carafe with more water.
Cas sat bolt upright and nearly upended his popcorn bowl. His heart leapt into his throat as he stared at the simple little suggestion. Skype? A video call? A real, actual conversation with Dean? Seeing his face? Watching his reactions to every melodramatic plot twist of his silly hospital show?
“Hello, Dean. Jack.” Cas drags himself into the kitchen with half-open eyes. His sleep-rough voice is adorable. The wild shock of hair standing up on one side, even moreso.
Dean gasped into the kiss as his hand resettled itself on Cas’ shoulder. Cas’ glass clattered as he hastily set it on the table in order to hold Dean’s waist with both hands. Cas kissed like he was starving for it, voracious and desperate, licking his way into Dean’s mouth without preamble and moaning deeply into the heat he found there.
At the doorway, Dean pauses and looks back. Cas is still blissfully unconscious, his breathing slow and heavy and relaxed. The second Dean got out of bed he snagged all the blankets and cocooned himself in them, but by now his hand is out, searching for Dean so he can wrap his arm around him again. When it fails to find him, it curls around Dean's pillow. Cas buries his nose in it and lets out a tiny coo of contentment.
Cas offered the receptionist a small, tight smile before turning his studious gaze to the figurines on the wall shelves. The woman furrowed her brow, so Dean charged forward with the conversation before Cas’ awkwardness put her off. If they were going to pry into the case here, they needed her to be friendly with them. “I booked a reservation for this weekend. It--Are you guys still open? It’s kinda quiet in here.” Dean glanced around the empty living space. There weren’t any other cars parked outside either.
“Alright, I’ve tried everything,” Dean declares as he tosses a small gold amulet and a welding helmet onto the library table, sending a stack of books toppling over. “So far that’s a no-go on angel mojo, magic, and five thousand-whatever degree fire.
Dean pulled back. “What? I can’t even put sunscreen on you now?” he demanded.
“Certainly, sir.” The cashier whipped out a large cup and scribbled the order in marker. “Name?”
“Of course,” Dean breathes. He holds Cas close, tucking his chin over his shoulder and squeezing tight, like he never wants to let go. He
Dean shrugs. “Kinda feels like a random impulse that I can’t ignore. But so far it’s all been good.” He winks. “Though there had better be some sex involved, not just me telling you how great you are.”
Dean rolls his eyes. Of course he wouldn’t understand. The dude eats low sodium turkey bacon. "I know you haven't had good,
“Absolutely.”
But he persevered. He knew Dean's reaction would be worth it.
Dean thinks of Cas’ face, the way he had smiled as he said he loved him. He thinks of how he was so close to having the one thing he really wanted. How Cas had wanted the same.
Sure enough, there he was at the table. And sure enough, the pot of coffee Dean had made barely an hour ago was empty. Dean scowled at it, feeling irrationally annoyed that Cas hadn’t made a replacement pot even though Dean didn’t even
“God, I could do this forever, couldn’t I?” Dean marvels. His hands are restless, alternating between tightly gripping the back of Cas’ head so he can thrust into him, and gentle caresses through his messy hair. “I can fuck you like this as long as I want, can’t I? And you can take it. You
Sam quickly opened his overshirt and held it open so Dean could see the words emblazoned in pink, purple, and blue across his chest.
Cas shrugs. “We could lock it up? Put it in storage with the rest of the Men of Letters’ cursed objects?”
“You sure we hafta destroy it?” Dean asks plaintively, earning a small laugh from Cas.
Cas deferred to Dean’s hunting experience. “Well then what should we do until then?”
Dean nodded, his grin widening at his little joke. “Yeah! It’s special. Angels love it, ya know.”
Dean yawned as he padded down the bunker hallway in socked feet. He wished that was a sign of impending sleep, but unfortunately insomnia plagued him tonight. He hoped a glass of milk and a small snack would help him along.
Cas couldn’t hold back his smile even if he wanted to. There were a million things that he wanted to say, and as he looked into Dean’s warm, gorgeous eyes, the first words he spoke to his soulmate were the ones he was thinking the loudest. “You’re beautiful, Dean.”
Except Cas went stiff under Dean, and Dean took the hint and pulled his hand away as he bit back a sigh. So much for that.
Cas’ back became hard as marble. He lowered his head. “That’s enough, Dean,” he said softly. His voice trembled with some barely contained emotion Dean didn’t understand.
Cas gasps sharply in a way that Dean knows means his toes are curling in his sensible shoes. He takes Dean in deeper, his tongue pressed up against his length, and his
Cas’ eyes flickered over to his own tiny profile picture. “I like bees.”
Cas didn’t have an answer to that. He only glared, his eyes flickering with something Dean couldn’t quite figure out. Pain? Longing? Regret?
“You’ve got a point.”
Her eyes trail over to where Dean gestured, and for a split second her brow furrows in confusion before she laughs just a little, more incredulous than cruel. “You really want someone like
“Me!” Cas plastered his hand over his chest. He almost looked like he could cry. “I told you how I felt and you insist on acting like nothing happened!”
“Well, Jack decided today was your birthday. So, happy birthday.” Dean shrugged a little in a ‘Kids. What can ya do?’ sort of way.
Dean’s heart went cold. “For you? You don’t think I want this?”
Dean relaxed and smiled. “Isn’t it past your bedtime?” he said as he swaggered into the kitchen. Cas jumped, sending a canister of spices toppling over and spilling on the counter and across his apron. Correction,
to give him space, he really was, but the way Cas was acting, it was like he didn’t even
Susan’s face melted into a quiet, sad smile. “Yes, that’s my Marcy right there. A self-portrait. She was such a talented artist.”
The bitterness had faded from Cas’ eyes, replaced with something that Dean was loath to acknowledge looked a little bit like pity mixed with profound frustration. “So when I came back, you thought there wasn’t anything left to talk about?”
Dean huffed a silent laugh. “I’m really terrible following along with tech support. I’ll get Charlie to help later. She’s a wiz at these things.”
Dean huffs and levels an indignant glare at his brother. “I absolutely have a favorite burger.”
Dean shut the trunk of the Impala and straightened his back, lifting his face to the breeze blowing in from the sea. He breathed in deeply. “God, smell that salt air…” he said with a wistful smile. When he turned to Cas, the angel was looking at him with fondness, warmth making his blue eyes brighter. Dean’s smile grew, and he lifted up his sunglasses to flash Cas a playful wink. Cas quickly ducked his head and started walking.
Dean’s heart leapt into his throat, Cas’ love confession ringing in his ears. “Didn’t I stab you?” he joked weakly, deflecting the spiraling nerves that bubbled up in his chest.
Dean takes a moment to think and...yeah. Yup. He really did say “I’m a pickle guy,” out loud. Wow.
was an idea…
“Dean?” His normally steady voice wavers.
“I was worried sick about you! What if you went in the ocean and something happened?”
And today definitely is another perfect moment. The conversation has naturally turned to Cas. They’re sitting at a picnic table at the park, with nobody around to overhear Dean spill his guts in the most agonizing and uncomfortable way possible. They’re working a case, so immediately after the conversation Dean can bury himself in research and hunting and not have to deal with Sam’s big, obnoxious “let’s make a huge deal out of this!” puppy dog eyes. And Cas isn’t even here right now to make things more awkward. He’s still checking out the victim at the coroner's office across the street.
“What the
His heart was racing, and when Dean’s smiling face popped up on the screen, it skipped a beat so dramatically that Cas felt a physical pang. He rubbed at his chest.
He stayed put on the porch as Dean crossed his yard in several long strides. Butterflies fluttered in Cas’ stomach as he watched Dean climb the steps and finally,
Cas nodded. “We should ask her about it.”
“Only when I want to be.” Cas realized he was positively beaming at his phone as he texted Dean. He cleared his throat and tried for a more neutral expression before giving up. No one was looking, anyway. “Do you wanna try just calling? Like in the before times?”
his thoughts urged.
So stubborn that he couldn’t even admit when he was wrong. Too stupid to even know how wrong he was!
“Well, would you like to eat here? Usually I don’t serve dinner for guests, but since it’s only the two of you, I can cook up something if you’d like. I honestly wouldn’t mind the company.”
Dean’s smirk turned into a toothy grin when he heard Cas sigh in frustration and annoyance. He turned around. Sure enough, Cas hastily jerked his gaze away from him and back down to his book. The flush on his face was darker than ever. But still he remained steadfastly silent.
true. But that’s kinda a weird thing for me to say.” The longer he stares at Cas, the larger the warm bubble of affection in his chest grows. Cas looks so worried about him, which is sweet. Cas always worries about him so much. It’s nice to know someone is looking out for him. Actually… The affection shifts, growing warmer. Hungrier. It’s kind of hot, how protective Cas is.
“Dean! You didn’t say
Dean stared. “A what?”
“Oh, and Sammy?”
Dean’s eyes never left Cas’ lips as they delicately closed around the straw of his concerningly green drink again. “Ya know,” he said with a teasing twinkle in his eyes as he took a sip from the rim of his paper cup, “my dad always said real men don’t use straws.”
“Show me how much you love my cock,” Dean murmurs, and he’s rewarded by a shaky moan pushing past Cas’ lips and ghosting over his damp skin. “You love it, don’t you? You love making me feel good. Love putting that hot mouth to good use.” Dean isn’t usually much for dirty talk--real, proper dirty talk, not just a few steamy encouragements in the heat of the moment, but with the impulses from the amulet tugging his thoughts in the right direction, it flows out of him easily.
Yeah. Cas definitely knew what Jack was planning today.
because just
“Why does it even
Cas smiles a little. “You give me a lot to worry about.” He finally settles his hands on Dean’s hips. “So you can tell that the amulet is compelling you to do things?”
Cas set a mug down in front of Dean before slumping down into the chair beside him. “I hope he and Eileen have fun this week,” he mumbled as he hunched over his coffee.
Dean shook himself out of his stupor as the man politely took his coffee. “Oh. Um. Dean... The name’s Dean.” He twisted his head around to watch the man walk out of the shop.
Cas swallowed thickly and tried to ignore the way his stomach twisted itself into excitable knots. He was getting ahead of himself. “Let me grab my laptop. Skype keeps crashing on my phone. I think the last update messed it up.” He followed up with his username. His blanket was tossed aside as Cas leapt up to grab his laptop from its bag. While it turned on, he settled back on the couch and muted the TV so he could better hear Dean’s call. With hasty and uncharacteristic self-consciousness, Cas dragged his hand through his hair a few times in a failed attempt to make it a little less messy.
definitely wasn’t the one who needed to apologize here.
And at forty-two, Dean was too damn old to keep pretending he didn’t love Cas the same way Cas so clearly loved him.
laughing at all of the odd, awkward things Cas said. The way Cas openly stared at Dean in a way he hadn’t in years. The way Cas smiled softly when he did, in a way he
Dean quickly smoothed down his reflexive scowl at the suggestion. It wasn’t this poor cashier’s fault she was forced to peddle whatever god-awful, frilly concoction the hippies who ran this coffee shop came up with each month. “Coffee,” he said, a hint of a frown still lingering. “Normal coffee. Make it a large.”
“You…” Dean clears his throat. His tongue feels heavy, fighting against what he knows he needs to say, but he pushes through. “You
Three days and one slightly terrifying highway
He leaned in close so he could almost whisper, “Wish I could see it somewhere other than the beach.”
so lawfully wedded husband?”
“I have the salt!” she said, and with panic and desperation in her eyes she blindly flung the open canister at Dean and the ghost. Salt flung in a wide arc and rained down on Marcy, who screamed and disappeared instantly.
"Huh?" Jack titled his head at Dean before his gaze trailed over to the bedside clock. "Oh. Sorry. I forgot to check the time."
“Right. Yeah. I know.” This was it. This was the moment. Sam’s fingers itched to unbutton his flannel, but he waited. He needed absolute perfect timing.
Silently, Dean takes a single step forward. Cas is frozen on the spot, staring at him like he doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He takes another step, and another, until he’s close enough to reach out and tug Cas into an embrace.
Cas shrugged one shoulder. “It’s...not for everyone,” he said delicately.
“Because you don’t!” Cas snapped. He threw himself at the shut door of their room, but it was supernaturally sealed. He grunted and tried again. Marcy appeared at his side, a ghostly hand reaching for his chest, a snarl on her lips.
“If you don’t mind my asking, what stopped you?” Dean felt bad for pressing her for information that was clearly upsetting, but people’s lives were at stake. Possibly Susan’s own.
After minutes, or perhaps seconds, or perhaps hours, they pulled away. Dean’s lips were flushed and looking so alluring that Cas almost dove back in. But before he could, Dean spoke. “Hey Cas…” His voice was deep and rough, either naturally or from their kiss, but it wavered with a tenderness that had Cas’ heart melting. He wanted to listen to that voice for hours. Days. Forever.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Before everything.” He gestured around his head. Before Cas told him he loved him and immediately
“If Dr. Sexy hooks up with Dr. Piccolo again, I’m throwing my TV into the garbage.”
"Okay!" Sam's voice pitches up several octaves. Dean frowns at him, but before he can ask, Sam takes a deep breath and plasters a warm, understanding smile across his face. "You know what? You're right, Dean. After all this time. All those, uh...burgers. I'm glad you've figured out which one you like best."
Cas was staring at him with awe and disbelief and so, so much love. It twisted in Dean’s chest, warm and comforting and terrifying in equal measure, and for once Dean didn’t force himself to push those feelings back down. Cas loved him. Wholly, unconditionally, knowing everything that Dean had done, everything Dean had been through. He loved him through all of that, without any expectations beyond what Dean was capable of giving him.
And yet, he still wakes up early every day.
“I’d tell you to go screw yourself, but you really saved my ass this afternoon, so I’m gonna let that one slide.”
“It is…” Cas frowned and knit his eyebrows together at the monstrosity before him. “An inside-out hedgehog?”
” Cas gasps, practically a prayer. His hands are shaking as he fumbles with Dean’s zipper, he’s so aroused, and usually Dean would help him along, but something--the amulet--compels him to stay where he is and let Cas do all the work.
“We met because YOU needed help with LARPing costumes.”
“Before,” Cas repeated stiffly.
Cas’ lips were cinnamon sweet, his mouth warm and inviting as Dean slipped his tongue inside with a soft sigh. Dean let his hands wander, up Cas’ back, down his thick arms, carding through his hair, and soon Cas did the same. They kissed until the kitchen timer started shrieking at them, reluctantly pulling them apart. Cas’ hair was wild, the flour almost completely brushed out of it by now. His lips were wet and kiss-bruised, their lovely pale pink now dark. Dean knew he wasn’t much better himself. The front of his pajamas were now stained with cinnamon from Cas’ apron. He was almost certain there were floury handprints on his ass.
“Why? They have good chemistry.” Cas privately marveled at the way he’d gotten emotionally invested in a primetime medical drama. If any of his siblings could see him now, tucked up under a quilt with a bowl of popcorn, texting another man about a character named
Dean grins, unable to take his eyes off Cas while Donna, the only member of his overly-emotional family he trusts
Upstairs their room was somewhat small but airy. The walls were a crisp, breezy blue, the linens bright white. There was even a gauzy white canopy draped around the four-poster bed. Dean grinned. One bed. Surely that was cause for some optimism about tonight.
“You don’t think I love you?” Dean choked out between gasps for air. His head was spinning. Cas’ hand on his shoulder helped a lot, but when Dean asked his question Cas quickly yanked it away. “How could you think that?” he said, genuinely confused.
...bacon sex metaphor? The pickle guy thing? I
The sun is setting, casting long shadows down the sand. The shifting winds coming from the sea carry a chill, making the little crowd gathered around them draw their jackets close and huddle together, but the smiles on their faces are nothing but warm. There’s no altar. No stage. No decorations. Just Cas and Dean, standing in front of the ocean, wearing their favorite flannels and jeans, two bright yellow black-eyed susans pinned to their shirts--stolen right out of someone’s garden on their way to the beach.
“It really was,” Cas replies with a contented sigh. “That was… Thank you, Dean. That was amazing. Truly.”
Sam’s mouth twitched into a shy grin despite his best efforts. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll be on my best behavior,” he said, letting Dean have one last bit of fun before he left. “You and Cas too. Don’t get into trouble.” He nodded in farewell before he climbed the stairs to the bunker door.
Sam rolled his eyes as he walked out the door.
Sam’s eyes go huge, all color draining out of his face. “Oh shit. I didn’t-- I’m sorry, I--”
The fight left Cas injured, and Dean
