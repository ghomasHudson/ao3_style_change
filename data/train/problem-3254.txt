“I was just about done. What’s wrong?”
“It’s fine.” Cas darts forward and takes the mug. He sips it there and then and smiles. “It’s great. Thank you, Dean.”
roommate.
“Harpy, like Greek mythos harpy?” Dean blinks. “Harpies are real?”
“Yeah?”
“You’ll always be welcome to Heaven as long as our faction is in charge,” she says firmly. “As soon as we locate your grace, you’ll be one of us in no time.”
“C’mere,” Dean says with a tug on his wrist. “I’ll redress it for you.”
Water is rejuvenating on his parched throat, and it’s cool against his skin as he rinses the glass. He feels a little less suffocated. Despite being underground, it’s a bit too warm.
Dean sighs, and stalks towards him. Realizing what he’s trying to do, Castiel rips away from the touch, away from Dean’s embrace. The warmth leaves him as quickly as it arrived. “Dean,
“Oh. That was thoughtful of you.”
Jesus.
Dean laughs.  “Did you want anything specific for dinner?”
“I don’t know.” Cas looks down at themselves. They hold up their hand, and much to Dean’s horror, Dean can see through them like a fogged-up window. Cas offers a weak smile. “First time for everything?”
It’s cruel. It’s unfair that he has to unlearn everything he’s had to until now just to adapt a wholly different way of living. Because he’s something he didn’t choose to be.
And there’s always Cas’s birthday (he’s gotta ask about that later) that they can spend together, and there’s always next year for birthdays. That’s how birthdays work so it’s not like he won’t have another chance to spend his birthday with Cas ever again.
“Sam.”
Dean’s voice tickles his ear, and an unkempt buzz settles in his stomach. The touch burns through the thickness of his coat, and Castiel inclines his head to meet Dean’s eyes, green and endless like the universe. Just as he remembers them. “Hello, Dean.”
Dean snatches the photo away, and Castiel startles at his ferocity. “I told you to butt out of this case.”
, Cas,” Charlie says. “You watch
“Cas,” Dean says, “we’ll take care of the angels. You’re human now—it’s not your problem anymore.”
It’s not like he can say
Dean doesn’t really know what to say after that. It’s not attraction, exactly—well, okay, the man
“Hello, Dean,” calls Cas from the living room while Dean takes his shoes off.
and his heartbeat only slows down when he sees Cas already standing in front of the stove.
Dean lets out one sharp mocking laugh. “Yeah, bullshit. Who else could do this?”
“I remember when you first discovered it. Folk tale is true, by the way. You learned it from the goats.”
Maybe
Something. Anything.
He looks up expectantly, and waits one more second.
“Whoa,” says Summer, steadying Dean on their spot. “You alright?”
“I know,” Castiel replies. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Shut up.”
“You wanna, uh, join us for dinner? There’s company here, and we figured…” Dean shrugs.
The bunker is absolutely silent, almost as if there are only two of them and this room the entire world as Castiel confesses his sins. His head is bowed as Muriel evaluates him.
“Is Cas—uh, Spring really coming early this year?”
“How did you do this?” he asks instead. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know their ways. Sometimes I think we’re not even speaking the same language.”
Dean turns away from Castiel, and leaves the kitchen to take the rest of the call. Dean’s cup of coffee still sits in front of Castiel, steam rising from the white mug. Castiel taps his own mug in his hand and takes a sip of his coffee again, only to wince at the sudden foreign taste. A taste that must’ve been present this whole time, but something he hadn’t noticed until now. He looks down at the swirling black liquid in his cup. Nothing’s changed, but there’s no mistaking the faint metallic taste at the back of his throat. It wasn’t Dean that he’d told about the coffee berries before. It was—
it? “You shouldn’t have to pay the cost of all this
“Hello, Dean.”
He mumbles a greeting to Bobby who's sitting at his desk with the usual piles and piles of books on top, and sinks into the sofa himself. The fireplace is going even though it’s warm inside and out, and Castiel belatedly realizes how cold he is compared to the rest of the room. He shivers a little, and huddles closer to the fire with his own case file in hand.
A cool damp towel wipes down his face. “No,” Dean says softly. “But you do have a fever.”
Cas looks back at them. “That’s the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“That’s not like you,” Castiel says.
Castiel rubs his fingers together. “I thought I’d go back to Bobby’s and try to make progress on the case.”
Castiel pauses.
“Yeah,” he says quietly. “Me, too.”
Dean shrugs. “Cas got me into it.”
Cas freezes on the couch like he’s been caught doing something he shouldn’t be doing, which is weird considering he’s just watching
There’s a small sigh outside his door, and Dean tenses immediately. It was too much of a shock for him to properly think it through, but what if—what if Cas has a taste for human meat, or something? Or, or try to
It’s a promising start.
“What?” Castiel is too surprised to keep it out of his voice, his anger momentarily forgotten. “No, of course not. Both of you’ve been a great help.”
“I told him not to come since I figured we wouldn’t do much of anything with just us three.”
“Yeah. Just peachy.”
Dean looks up sharply. He glares. “Why?”
“Shut
He’s terrified either way.
“Cas,” Dean says carefully, “you don’t happen to know where any of the gates of Heaven are, do you?”
He rolls over in his bed, and checks his phone. 3:34AM. He rolls it in his hand, the weight of it comforting and
Dean tentatively looks at Castiel, and Castiel gives him a tight quirk of his lips. He’s alright, he wants to say. They both know it’d be a lie, so he doesn’t.
Dean wakes up a little freaked out later that night, his hands clutching the sheets while he blinks up at the dark ceiling.
Dean comes back from his last class for the day, and pauses at the foyer when he smells the unmistakably fruity sweet smell that fills the entire house. Also mixed in the air is the tangy scent of alcohol.
There is bright yellow graffiti on the side of Bobby’s house, an attempt to scrub it away evident.
Castiel takes a deep breath. He tries to conjure everything into words. He’s not good at it, but he tries. He has to. “Sam, I—I never thought of you as a
“What?”
“I know.” His legs shake as he gets back up on his feet. “I know. I’m truly sorry. I—”
on a daily basis. Ain’t that enough?”
The guy had seemed… well, Dean wouldn’t say friendly, exactly, but he had seemed decent enough. I’d-be-down-with-living-with-you-for-the-next-year-or-so decent. He should’ve known the moment he introduced himself as ‘Castiel’ because really, what human parent with a right mind names their kid anything remotely like ‘Castiel’?
He listens to the quietness of the bunker and focuses on his heart as it calms back down into a steady rhythm. He takes another deep breath with his back arching and slumps back onto the bed with a sigh.
talking about my wings, right?”
followed by a
Cas purses their lips with a nod. “And everything is wrong. Birds are laying eggs too soon and others are waking up too late, and everything is being driven up mountain ranges but those are running out, too.”
The previous owner sure had some good taste and Dean recognized a number of songs. He picked whatever first song he was familiar with, which happened to be
). They watch
He can’t go back home. Not anymore.
Cas nods and drags his feet and wings back to his room, exhaustion practically rolling off him.
“It’s alright,” Cas says quickly as if he understands how painfully embarrassing it is to misunderstand one’s cultural aspect and make a fool out of himself. Oh, wait. Ha. “You didn’t know what you were saying.”
“How are we supposed to find something an angel doesn’t even know about?” Bobby shoots back. Again, all Castiel can offer is his shrug. Bobby grunts his displeasure.
“Then it’s decided.”
“You wanna zap on over to where I am now? I’m at the café we talked about.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“I’m not human, Dean,” Cas says slowly, like Dean hasn’t known that for the past whole month already. “Your close friends will be there.”
“It’s whatever, man. What’d you want for dinner?”
“Dean,” Cas murmurs back, “when did you get a dog?”
Thursday?”
“Oh.”
There’s no response, so Dean walks away from the door, into the kitchen, and opens the fridge for the sake of doing something with his hands.
, and besides, he’s living in a place where he’s paying honest rent for. It’s not like he should be condemned for things like that under his own roof. And from the sounds of it, it sounds like he’s got some bad experiences from talking about it or something, the way he keeps going on about Dean wanting him to leave.
theories, but before they can even scratch the surface of Castiel’s thoughts on the next installment, Kevin leaves to help someone out with something, too.
“You’re not looking so hot.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Sam says slowly. “Why don’t you use the shower? It’s still a few hours before Dean’s here.”
“I know everything you know, Castiel.” It walks with ease, confidence in its stride. “I know what you’re guilty of, and I know that you think you deserve to die for it.”
. “You sure you don’t need help with anything?”
He feels like the biggest pervert in the world, walking in on something like that. Stupid, fuck, he should’ve just stayed on campus or something. Why did he come back home? Fuck.
Dean bites his tongue again, and fixes his eyes back onto his meal, poking at it with the flipper. Should he say something else? It feels like he should, but he doesn’t want to overstep his boundaries,
Dean laughs, and stays for the rest of the episode.
Castiel looks up from his hands. “Yes?”
Dean stood there uselessly for a while longer, taking a moment to thumb over the spot on his face.
But then, one day, Cas doesn’t show up.
The man opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. He starts to form a word, but someone enters the shop with a jingle of a doorbell that rips both their attention away from each other. Dean doesn’t know why, but he’s suddenly restless and jittery like he hasn’t slept, and his empty fingers itch to reach out to the man in front of him.
“There was sauce,” Castiel reasons calmly. He’s not sure why—it’s not any different than any other evenings they’ve spent together, yet his heart beats so fast now as he watches Dean’s face flush a deep bright red.
“Look, it’s not like I’m actually gonna go out and buy this thing.”
Bobby's floorboard creaks under his feet, giving away to his weight. He wonders if there is anyone else in here other than himself and Bobby. He hopes so.
There is a door at the end of the corridor, and Castiel runs, runs, runs as hard as his legs will carry him. The door leads to the bunker’s main room, and Castiel reaches the metal stairs to the exit with the steps rattling under his feet. He reaches the top, and his head spins and his lungs feel like they’re collapsing, but he doesn’t stop.
“Hm?”
“They tried to make me feel welcome, for you.”
it’s harpy stuff. It’s always harpy stuff whenever Cas acts weird. Instead, he thinks about the group project. If Cas wasn’t at a group project, where was he?
“Dude.” Dean laughs, and Cas relaxes. “It’s cool. I thought it was interesting.”
Cas’s door clicks shut, but the sound doesn’t grate at Dean’s nerves. Dean sinks into his own bed, and this time, he has no problem slipping into sleep.
Dean comes home, high in spirit after a LARPing session gone excellent to his favour. He’s pretty sure he and Charlie can take on Jo the next time they meet, once and for all. Which is seriously awesome, because this campaign’s lasted far longer than any of them had expected, and it’s about time they put an end to this long battle.
Dean manages to untie his tongue and say, “What was that for?”
What then, if Cas is gone for good?
Sam’s anger softens. “Cas, it’s fine.”
Cas gives a noncommittal grunt, and sips something out of a mug. Dean wrinkles his nose as he gets a waft of the smell, strong enough to float all the way back to where Dean’s standing. He peeks over, and yep, it’s the same red stuff that’s been on their kitchen counter for weeks.
Charlie pauses flipping through her notes and turns around in her seat to face him. “I mean, it’s his life.”
“I see.”
He’s thinking about which colour would suit Cas best when they arrive at the store. Dean would rather go straight to the hot chocolate aisle, but Cas’s face light up as soon as they walk into the store. Go figures; this place is like a field trip for him.
Cas cocks his head to the side at the mention of someone he’s never heard of before, and Dean leaves him to looking up who Constantine is while he himself gets ready for the party. He’s excited to find that the knight costume is slightly tighter around his shoulders compared to when they ran the Moondoor campaign over the summer. When he steps out of his room, Cas grins.
Cas looks at him. Dean looks back.
A woman stands in front of his door in a ranger suit. Castiel looks out the corridor to see if Dean or Sam is accompanying her, but nobody else is here. He puts two and two together.
“Nice view,” Dean mutters as he takes a seat farther away from the edge than Castiel is. They’re up on the roof of the factory that’s built on top of the bunker. Being so high up should make his human instinct kick in, but he only feels calmer with his feet dangling in the air.
your home.”
Castiel pauses. He looks back up at the sky. He could stay like this the whole day, he thinks, basking in the warm sunlight and trying to find an end to that blueness.
“Sam’s looking for you.”
He hears himself more clearly this time in his head. He thinks he understands why Cas was confused when he said it before. For some reason, he doesn’t say it out loud this time.
enough. All he has to do is convince himself of it.
Wings. Cas said he had wings.
Cas thinks about it. His face contorts in an interesting way as he thinks, his eyes screwing up as his eyebrows move up and down and his mouth pursed into a thin line. “No. Not always.”
) and somehow ends up in front of the front door of an apartment unit. He knocks and waits.
Castiel glances over the empty photo on the desk. A fire, a tin of beans, kind words telling him to try counting sheep. “The homeless man in the photo. He was the one who gave me food.”
,” Castiel growls. “I just want to go home.”
, Dean.” Her voice sounds slightly blocked from having a congestion, and Dean touches the tip of her nose. It’s completely frozen.
God, he must’ve felt so lonely here without anyone else knowing about him.
“No,” Castiel says faintly.
Dean lets out a shuddering breath. He looks at the door Cas disappeared out of.
Cas stares at him wide-eyed, glances down at the mug of hot cocoa, back to Dean, and puts his phone on his desk with a resolute
It’s enough. “I’ll be here,” Dean hushes.
He sees the light pouring out from the edges of Cas’s door, and knocks firmly. There’s silence from the other side of the door, but it’s so pointed that Dean can physically feel Cas staring at the door in disbelief. He holds his breath, and he doesn’t even know what he’s going to say, fuck, but… But…
So. Winter and Spring. Dean and Cas. Always near each other, sometimes together on blissful days even if it was much too short of a timeframe, but together nonetheless. They weren’t alone anymore.
But that’s stupid. And weird.
The professor enters the room and Charlie leans over before the actual lecture begins to ask, “Anything you wanna do for your birthday?”
“What’s the deal with the whole phoenix and harpy crap? Are you a phoenix or a harpy or what?”
“I’m not sure what the human custom is, and honestly, I’m not really sure if there even is one when it comes to my case,” Cas confesses, and Dean is ten degrees of confused now, “and they’re usually fine hidden and I should practice hiding them, but I admit that I’m not used to having to. Hide them, I mean.” Cas pauses, and gauges for Dean’s reaction, which is none. Because Dean doesn’t even know what he’s reacting to, at this point. Hide what, the feathers? He’s not really sure he wants to think of any other options with this speech happening. “And like you say, they can become… kinky if I don’t stretch them once in a while. My room is too small for them.”
“C’mon,” Dean says gently with a tug, and pulls him back out into the hallway. “Go back to sleep.”
“Happy birthday, dick.”
Cas wordlessly kisses him again, slots their mouths together like Cas has been thinking about this for as long as Dean has, and Dean silently takes note at the back of his mind to tell Cas again later, just in case Cas doesn’t know. He’ll just have to tell him as many times as he wants.
Dean feels stronger and stronger every day. Maybe strong isn’t the right word for it; they’re becoming more and more frequent and intense against their will. They’re on edge these days to gain their control back on how things happen and reel back, but this climate change just has it out for them to make everything difficult for them.
Castiel rubs at his right arm, trying to rub away the dull pain that’s developed. The fog that was occupying his brain clears like it was never there. “We were here for her.”
“It was yellow,” Castiel supplies helpfully, but Sam shakes his head.
There’s a game of archery that plays on the TV. It’s an empty bar, save for one other man to the side, chatting with the bartender. Under the low lighting of the bar, they’re in their own private world.
“Good nap?” Dean asks, looking up from his phone. Cas nods, still somewhat out of it, and joins him on the couch. The heat from his body radiates towards Dean soon enough, and it’s such a perfect amount of toasty that Dean’s about to break out the marshmallows and the graham crackers. Dude’s like a walking heater.
“Sam?”
google it after he came home out of pure curiosity—apparently there are more people out there who do this for the sake of not staining their teeth, or in a more logical context, people who can’t hold cups up to their lips properly for medical reasons. Dean kinda felt like a dick for acting so stupidly surprised after realizing that)
“I sense that you’re trying to make me feel better,” he says, “but I’m not sure how this is supposed to make me feel better.”
“What?” Dean laughs. “What’s that got to do with this?”
“Wha—huh?”
“I don’t know,” Cas says, sounding just as helpless as Dean feels.
“Tell me about the gates.”
“What did it say?” Sam asks.
“Why?” Castiel asks. “You’re still the prophet. Aren’t you exposed to danger?”
Dean blinks. “I mean, I
It’s enough. There are voices everywhere. Dean and Sam.
“Who do you think, genius?”
“Dean?”
Dean wants to rip someone’s hair out. “Then who
Absolutely terrifying. “It was fine.”
to not show up? It makes no sense.
“Hmm.”
Tick.
Dean takes a moment to wipe the caramel sauce off his lips. “So. Any new breakthroughs on your case?”
Cas’s smile widens. “You should.”
“Sunny side-up.” Cas frowns slightly. “They haven’t requested anything yet so I’ve asked about it, but there’s no response so far.”
Normally, Dean would be more careful. Normally. He doesn’t know exactly what compels him to go up to the man and confront him with a, “Hey.”
Summer eyes him warily and points North. “Autumn’s expecting you.”
“Yes.”
She nods at Castiel with a smile. “Cool coat.”
Sam pats him on the shoulder, perhaps as a way to offer some sense of condolences. “You’re doing great, Cas. I’m sure you’re doing everything you can, right?”
“You guess.”
“Castiel,” it whispers. It takes a step forward. Castiel pushes again, and the door gives a little. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you
“None taken. I have kin there, or so I’m told.”
“You think you’re ever gonna go back one day?” Dean inclines his head slightly, giving Castiel just the right view of the way light dances in the greens of his eyes. “Leave this place, lock the door behind you, and never come back?”
Cas’s eyes are warm when he smiles back at him. “Thank you, Dean.”
He rubs his right arm. It hurts again, almost like someone is squeezing at a wound. He doesn’t know when it started hurting. He can’t remember the last time it hurt. This isn’t the first time he’s felt this pain.
Castiel pauses, just for a second. “You’re far more generous than I’ll ever be, then.”
“I suppose not.”
“Dude, did you even see her? She was fucking gorgeous. You’d have to be a fool to pass up on her.”
for once in their god damn lives and Dean’s gone and fucked that up.
Well. That definitely paid off in more ways than one.
“Yes, Google and Wikipedia are always helpful. I’m starting to wonder if it would be more effective for me to just go back home and read Wikipedia articles to learn about humanity instead of spending thousands of human money just to learn these—” Cas sets his glare back to his textbook, “—
.” Dean rattles the doorknob one last time. “I have an exam tomorrow, so be quick.”
“Which one would you rather have?”
“Just admit it, Dean.” Michael’s face hovers over him. He smiles. “You’ll never have what you want. Not really. You know that.”
“They’re not.”
“Horrible.” Castiel shakily pokes at the top of the porridge with his spoon. The bowl warms his hand. He blows the steam off the porridge, and takes a small bite. It’s bland, and barely has any other purpose than to be a mush in his mouth. He spills droplets as he spoons in more bites, and Sam huffs a laugh at his distaste.
“Oh, damn. Sorry to hear that.”
Dean rips his eyes away from his wings to dart one wide-eyed panicked look at Cas, and all the guilt crumbles out of Cas’s face. “
“And you’re aware of the internet presence the books have made.”
“Like what?”
“I’m glad college’s been different.” Layla laughs. “Even if we still have do group projects.”
The man looks away from the magazine and says, “Hello.”
Where was he driving to, again?
A headache bids him a good morning. Castiel buries his face further into the pillow with a groan, but he does find a cup of coffee by his nightstand. It’s strong and familiar, as always.
Nothing.
Winter was by themselves for a long time. They figured out that they could shape every water drops into snowflakes with different details—even if they were always hexagonal—and for a while they observed some big, wooly beasts that didn’t seem to mind that Winter was there. Winter was happy to have the company, though they stopped seeing the big wooly beasts around after a while. Went extinct, as a matter of fact.
Poking out from between the many books in the shelves is a document file. Its edges are crinkled, almost as if someone hastily shoved it in there in fear of it being found. Castiel checks behind him to make sure Dean or Sam hasn’t come into the room, and opens it with a shaky breath.
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean mutters as they miserably pass by a flock of birds migrating down South. “Where
“Great job.” Dean smiles, his face aglow. “We couldn’t have done it without you.”
Dean almost has half a heart to go
he doesn’t want Cas to think he’s being judged for stuff like that. Not like it’s anything
The suffocating things he’s had to do just because he wanted to exist in the same place as everyone else.
Dean shakes himself out of it. “I probably got it wrong, then.”
Castiel inclines his head to meet Dean’s eyes, the man who has so much love to offer that his words drip with its overflow. They’re barely a breath away.
“No. Well—yes. Mainly in that I’m not completely human.” Cas’s shoulders slump. “This party is important to you. Why would I…”
“You don’t need to pay money to receive a hug from me, you know,” Cas murmurs.
“Cas, what did you do.”
“Cas, I… I’m sorry,” Dean says, and he wants to put more strength behind his words, but somehow they come out hushed. “For acting the way I did.”
him because this is top secret that can’t be leaked because it’ll put the rest of Cas’s family in danger? It’s not like Cas knows Dean that well—they’ve known each other during the last half of the summer and the first few weeks of school, at most.
Cas cranes his neck with a wince and look, Dean feels bad. He really does. So he offers the only thing he can think of. “D’you want a massage?”
“Cas,” they breathe out, their arms already spread out wide to catch Cas in their embrace as they hurriedly make their way over to them.
Dean shoots out a thumbs-up emoticon as a response. He looks back at his reports, and bites back a sigh. Better finish this before next week.
Spring smiled and indulged Dean in their strange ways. “Of course, Dean.”
Dean deflates, and they go back to watching humans, equal parts hope and urgency.
Dean’s hand stalled for a moment. “I mean, where would we even put her? She’s too big.”
Castiel shoots him a levelled look, and Dean coughs out a laugh. “Yeah, okay. Pot calling the kettle black, et cetera. But seriously.” Dean nudges him with his shoulder. “You think I’m not terrified of the same shit?”
“It’s almost funny,” Cas says, sounding like the opposite of amused. “They hate me for being part human, but they demand that I keep my being a harpy to myself. Associating myself with the same thing that they are… personally offends them.”
“Well,” Dean shrugs. “Sex.”
He stumbles when he gets to how Metatron cut out his grace and banished him to Earth along with everyone else, and still Muriel says nothing. He confesses to Hael’s death, and how she tried to take him as a vessel.
The evening dies down to a quiet lull, and Castiel basks into the easy atmosphere. Dean takes a swig of his beer, and smacks his lips together in thought. “So, Cas.”
Dean doesn’t know why he does it. Just that he gets it, he really
“My wish wasn’t to change you,” Castiel says quickly, and Dean halts in whatever he was about to say. “It was to stay exactly as we are.”
strange to have appointed himself as a guardian angel to Dean and Sam, staying near them all this time instead of returning to be with his brothers and sisters in Heaven. On the other hand, the Winchesters are a special case, not hesitant about jumping head-first into dangerous situations one would usually never find themselves in. Even if he himself was the dangerous situation for them at multiple points in their lives.
“I like this bunker,” Castiel offers. “It’s orderly.”
“You were,” Cas said.
The next highway stop, Dean spots him faster.
“Yeah. You always do,” Dean answers automatically, as if he expected Castiel’s answer. He’s heard those words before.
sometimes.)
“There’s a group of angels who wants to talk to you.”
Cas frowns. “I’m part phoenix harpy.”
Awkward.
“But… that’s what I’m offering.”
“Dean, what are you doing?”
Dean whirls to find Michael wearing his face and casually wiping a glass behind the bar. He offers him a smug smile and Dean wants to punch the look off his own face.
of germs,” Dean continues. “And every time you go to the toilet and touch anything in there—which, by the way, did you seriously wear gloves to the bathroom?”
Castiel hasn’t heard about that. He keeps his silence to prompt her to continue.
, and Cas looks so—far away, that Dean just reaches out, and grabs his hands, and squeezes. Cas’s eyes fly to Dean, and Dean tries on a reassuring smile. Hey, he ain’t going nowhere just yet.
Okay, but who would actually think—
It isn’t a big deal. Dean doesn’t seem to think so anyway, as he whistles while he gets the key out. Castiel stares at it all the same, the nagging feeling of missing something apparent now more than ever. That graffiti. That colour. He’s definitely seen it somewhere before. Something in his mind fills up but refuses to tip over, and the smell gets stronger, that
Castiel smiles faintly. This time, the small stab he feels in his chest is less hurtful. “I’m sure.”
“If you’d asked, if I knew that’s all you wanted, I—” Dean is confident but still so terrified, and Castiel thinks he understands exactly what he’s feeling. “I could’ve given you that this entire time.”
“If I could,” Dean mutters into Cas’s hair, “I’d freeze every one of those so-called climate change deniers to death.”
going on dates with someone could end up with them married. Usually it’s a casual thing though, to get to know each other better before doing all that—marriage couple crap.”
.” He can’t grasp at the edges of his mind, and it overwhelms but refuses to tip, refuses to let him reason with Dean, that photo, that man, that pain in his arm. It shouldn’t be something he needs to say outright, because he
“No,” Castiel replies. “I chose none of this.”
These are things that are familiar to Castiel now: Dean’s home-cooked meals, shared cups of hot chocolate, and many other wonderful things. Anna is proud of how far he’s come and he is too, in a way. He nods along to Dean’s complaint and smiles. One day for sure, Castiel will repay Dean for all he’s done and all of his incredible ways to make Castiel feel like he belongs more than he’s felt anywhere else.
Dean’s phone starts ringing, and Dean holds up a finger to answer the phone. “Hey, Sam.”
“No,” Dean says too quickly. “No, ‘course not. Anyway, good luck.”
Cas huffs out a laugh against Dean’s shoulder and moves away slowly from their embrace. Dean starts to protest but Cas instead leans back for a proper welcoming kiss, and oh, well, Dean’s not going to complain about this.
“These people can help in ways that we can’t,” Cas replies, just as fiercely. “It’s—Humans are so grappled by their own ideas of Paradise that they’re forging war and destruction on their paths. This president of yours, he’s not right.” He shakes his head. “We didn’t stop an Apocalypse only for them to start another one, Dean. I won’t let your or Sam’s efforts go to waste.”
“Is it hotter in here or what?” asks Charlie.
Cas gave him a skeptical look.
here? Where’s Cas?”
Muriel sits at the foot of his bed, and studies him. “I didn’t believe it when I first saw you, you know,” she says carefully. Everyone has been so very careful with him lately, and Castiel wants to kick her out and shut the door against the rest of the world again. “To think that one of our kind was captured by a djinn of all things, and was… inconvenienced by it.”
“No.” Cas shakes their head and holds Dean into a hug as if
. “Cas. Cas,
Sam’s confusion amplifies. “Why did you have rocks in your clothes?”
Dean shrugs. “It’d be nice to have company. I threw some pork in a crock pot yesterday so it should be ready now. D’you like pulled pork?”
Cas nods without a word. They look so
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas reads the sign, and politely steps onto where it tells him to. The ghoul shrills ominously.
There’s a hint of pride in that, but it’s soon gone as Dean focuses back on treating him. Castiel wonders if he can play up his ability to fight to appeal to Dean. It would make him more useful as a hunter. The line of thought is still not enough to distract him from the way Dean digs his thumb into the meat of his arm, dragging it along every time he has to readjust his grip on the arm.
It’s weird; every time Dean walks into the living room, he remembers the decorations and admires it for few seconds. It’s not like there’s much of it, and it’s not really that big of a deal, but he’s never done stuff like this with his roommates last year.
problem. Because you’re our friend.” Sam pauses. “Because you’re family. I thought you felt the same way.”
Castiel shakes his head again. He can’t lead them into what’s sure to be their deaths—not again. “You’re better off without me.”
“What? Uh, no. I also live here. I’m the one who posted the ad.” Dean points at the other room facing the one they’re currently  in. He eyes Castiel and licks his lips. “Is that a… problem?”
“And—I could’ve saved so many people if I had. This whole Crowley Abaddon mess right now? It’d be gone if I had enough courage.” Sam deflates a little. “So, yeah. I get it. I get what you’re saying.”
“What the hell does that even mean, you cryptic bastard?”
Someone—pretty sure Charlie—hooks an arm behind his shoulder and they all link arms save for Cas holding the cake, and they start swaying back and forth. “
It took him a little while to understand that it wasn’t the heater that’s been extra productive but another fairly new constant in his life. Said fairly new constant that’s currently walking into the living room wearing an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants, yawning up a storm.
Compared to Dean Winchester, the djinn is a bland mockery.
“Did the djinn do this?”
“Yeah.”
Dean notices. He must notice, because Dean sends Sam out of the room to do something for him, and as soon as he’s out of sight, Dean slings an arm behind Castiel’s chair. The gesture is meant to be comforting, but Castiel only feels trapped.
Dean can’t take it. “Do uh, do you only wing groom your partners?” he asks with the sole purpose of academic interest. Someone’s gotta ask these questions, right? “Like, this is strictly romantic?”
“And… And you…” Dean reaches over and squeezes Cas’s shoulder. “You’re so important to me.”
Castiel wants to, of course. He’d give everything and more to just sit down and relax, Dean by his side while they indulge in simple pleasures. There’s something very human about taking a moment to pause for no practical purpose other than to enjoy the moment. In a sense, it isn’t simple at all.
After Dean takes his hand and shakes it firmly, he ushers him inside. It’s a nice clean place—there’s a small kitchen which is divided from the living room by a wall, and a balcony. There’s what can be called a hallway down the living room and two rooms facing each other at the end of the hallway.
“At least you know now,” said Cas.
He didn’t really think anything was going to
Dean rolls their eyes and slowly makes their way back up North. They’re starting to get worried now. Cas had never gone flat-out
Dean still looks guilty about it as if somehow this is
Dean’s insides freeze.
They wait for a girl in front of them to stick a straw into one of those iced drinks and walk away while Dean’s making small talks with Cas about his day. Cas gets to his hot chocolate after the girl leaves, and he stick a straw into his own drink.
Cas laughs about something happening on TV, and curls up on the couch snugly. It’s a Wednesday night, but it feels like a weekend somehow. Dean yawns, and dozes off few times until he finds himself blinking awake with his head against Cas’s shoulder.
Dean doesn’t remember the next few minutes too well as it goes by a blur—he says something about having a good night, and of
“Give them time, Dean,” Cas says eventually. “Have faith.”
Castiel shuffles into his bed, the weight of the blanket over him reassuring. He buries himself further into the mattress.
Jesse lets Cas poke at his wings and lift it here and there, letting him inspect it with a smile, and he listens as Cesar explains about the Marvel universe. Cas also listens to Jesse bicker with Victor about how they’re both technically Sam Wilson and how they should’ve discussed this beforehand. Dean can tell that Cas doesn’t understand, and that he’ll have a million questions after this party.
“Don’t get me
Cas must notice, because he doesn’t try to talk to Dean, doesn’t even bother asking him before he hands Dean a mug of his own, and their fingers brush as he hands him the cup of coffee. Dean takes in the warmth of the cup that radiates into his palms, and he looks at Cas in front of him who’s so casually leaning against his kitchen counter, and slips out, “I love you.”
It’s enough. Metatron blinks, and sits forward as if that’ll give him more perspective into the room that he’s watching through a camera. Castiel straightens his posture, and looks at Metatron without wavering.
“Castiel,” Anna warns.
They pick up a box of pizza for dinner on their way back and Dean makes Charlie hold it while he unlocks the door. He walks in, noticing for a fraction of a second that there aren’t any lights on—
One night, Dean sends “
"And not all of the things I went through were bad," he continues. "I enjoy and cherish every memory I have with you."
“I thought it was the right time. I didn’t mean to arrive early.” Cas looks around. “It’s starting to mess with my judgement, Dean.”
“Hmm,” Spring said.
Dean clears his throat. “So, that was fun. Glad I got to see you and all.”
When Cas doesn’t look up, Dean leans down to catch their eyes. Cas casts them a woeful look. “Cas, keep sharp. Seriously. You’re scaring me.”
Dean glances at the clock. Just past eleven o’clock.
Cas huffs, and leans forward. “Grapefruits,” he repeats carefully. Dean nods.
(The next morning, Cas asks him what Dean
Dean stares. And stares. He doesn’t see any strings or anything that somehow attach the black feathery wings to Cas’s bare shoulder blades. They actually look like they’re…
He makes a vague gesture towards himself. Oh.
“I don’t know,” Castiel admits. “It doesn’t matter either way, does it? Not in the—”
“If this is forced, it could cost you your life,” the man says instead, so calmly that Dean thinks he’s misheard him for a second. “I won’t risk that. Not even for you.”
After the crowd scatters, Dean goes up to the groundhog. “Hey, are you sure?”
The small paved path turns into a dirt road and Dean presses on the pedal harder as he remembers how the spell had cursed him to forget everything about home, and he tightens his grip around the wheel as he remembers how he had to find his way back home again or wander forever until his death, and he drives and drives and drives to reach the end of this long trip as he remembers what his ‘home’ exactly is.
Dean braces himself. “What?”
Dean looks up, a raised eyebrow in place of an unspoken question.
“Ow! What’s your deal?”
,” Dean emphasizes, like he isn’t sure where Castiel is confused.
“C’mon, humour me. What about Heaven?”
For a split second, Dean thinks he’s going to stir it or something, but Cas sips out of the straw before he could get a word in. What.
“But what if it
Cas’s head snaps to Dean, wide-eyed. “What?”
“There must be a way to help Bobby from where we are,” Castiel replies instead. “Do you have any more information on his situation?”
“—and Jack won. So when he died and was refused by heaven for his sinful life, Satan gave him a coal burning with hellfire, and Jack carved out a turnip to keep it lit. He wanders with his lantern ever since.”
Cas is laser-focused onto the TV as he goes through Netflix, and Dean sees the moment he finds an episode from
“Yeah,” Dean replies flatly. “What?”
He had a stupid, stupid,
“Get the lights, and get over here.”
Finally.
Still. Finally happy with a plausible explanation, Dean focuses back on his notes.
Duh. Dean knows that. He’s just not sure why Cas sounds all barb-wired about it. Sure it’s not headline news that Cas gets offended at unexpected things, but not like… this.
Dean and Sam are always doing something. Sam leaves in between conversations to go do something for someone, and he doesn’t see Dean at all during the next few days. Kevin drops by from time to time to ‘help out’, but now he lives with his mother—who they found in one of Crowley’s prisons—instead of in the bunker.
Cas’s eyes darts away with guilt, with
“You’re Muriel,” Castiel says. She’s the one who healed Sam. “Hello.”
“How are you?” Above all, more than anything, Castiel wishes for… “Are you well?”
And they’re home.
fine.” Why don’t any of them
“Castiel is half-harpy.”
“Morning, Cas,” he sing-songs. He’s in a good mood.
They’re just about done with their groceries, and Dean is making sure they got everything they need, when Cas decides to stop in front of a mechanical ghoul doll that says
Well, alright then. Maybe the dude’s out. About time too, since Dean’s rarely seen him interact with anyone outside of, well, Dean.
”. Weird. Maybe he didn’t find it as interesting? Well, a hit-and-a-miss was bound to happen sooner or later.
“It’s very good,” Castiel says through his mouth full of food, swallowing down the bite along with the lump that’s formed in his chest. “I’d like to speak with your landlord once we’re done with lunch, if that’s alright with you.”
Castiel draws the last stroke of the sigil, and feels the pulse of his grace for the last time before it fades into the car, effectively binding to each other. Once Castiel makes sure the spell has taken place and looks to Dean, he finds Dean lightly touching where the sigil was. When Dean meets his eyes, he doesn't explain why he looks at Castiel so tenderly, with so much love that Castiel still can't understand it at times. But if anyone is capable of that much love, it is Dean.
Castiel looks at the bowl and the tray, so thoughtfully arranged. “Where is Dean?”
They do their silly little ceremonies and the President of the Inner Circle reads from a little paper thing that reads ‘there is no shadow of me; a beautiful spring it shall be’.
Oh. “Well,” Dean shrugs. “You are.”
to share everything with each other—he understands that, logically—but Dean shares everything with him. He thought it was the same for Cas.
Castiel thought about what he wanted to say to Dean on his way over. He practiced the words in what little time he had and rearranged them and practiced them again so that he wouldn’t do what he’s doing right now. Now that he’s here, he doesn’t know what to say. An apology, for what he doesn’t exactly understand yet. A clarification maybe, for something he didn’t understand until minutes ago. A confession if necessary, for something he understands too clearly now.
Castiel would trade it all to be back home.
“Yeah, I got that,” Dean replies. “Molting?”
“Artificial rain for your vegetables,” Cas says with a chuckle. “It never gets old.”
Cas takes in a breath, and lets it out as a small exhale. “You make me feel…” He pauses, as if searching for the right words. “Very loved.”
website. He loses himself in the chains and chains of news articles on various types of insects.
Cas doesn’t budge from where he is, and Dean awkwardly eyes the wall to Cas’s side. This is more awkward than the time Dean accidentally walked in on Sam that one ti—ugh, definitely did
Dean huffs again, but this time it comes out weaker.
Castiel nods, and resolutely walks towards Dean.
He just needs to find a way to make himself useful again.
Sam shakes his head in exasperation. “I know you’re upset about the angels falling, Cas, but you don’t need to take it out on him. You know he’s been busting his ass to help them out.”
Sam shrugs, and hands it back to him. “Don’t forget them next time.”
Cas frowns. “The living condition at your place doesn’t sound very accommodating.”
Castiel stares at Sam, so much taller than how he remembers him. He towers over him easily. He’s human now. He can only see as far as his eyes allow him. “It’s a nice day outside,” he offers.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asks, their stomach sinking at the sight.
Cas shakes his head slightly and Dean’s hope dials down instantly.
Castiel walks.
Cas dubiously raises his eyebrows at the name, but doesn’t comment on it.
fits you.”
Dean opens the brown can neatly sitting inside the cupboard. Empty, just as suspected.
Castiel is sitting down, but he’s suddenly falling, falling, falling into an endless hole. He looks from Dean and Sam. They both stare down at him in his chair.
Castiel swallows thickly. The buzz in his stomach becomes a malicious twist. “I know.”
Castiel stares at Dean, who neutrally stares back at him. He doesn’t know how to reply when put that way. Dean is so calm and collected, and Castiel is almost shivering. Something about this grates him, and it overwhelms him, so much that he can’t think. There’s a buzzing in his ears, and the smell lurks in.
Dean doesn’t say it to be malicious. There’s real worry underneath the tease, but it only works to emphasize Castiel’s cowardice. “I thought you went with Sam to talk to Crowley. Where is Sam?”
“Wha—Nothing! Look, Hannah, was it? I don’t know what you’re going on about, but I’m just his roommate.”
Cas’s smile this time brightens the entire room.
need a reminder of that.
Castiel wonders what it’d be like to tell Dean that he loves him.
Castiel smiles. “You’ll be a good leader, Hannah.”
Castiel stares at Dean. Dean waits calmly, and Castiel’s heart slams against his chest as what Dean said registers, and he so badly wants to say
on it—but he guesses he just… wanted the man to know that he noticed him, as weird as that sounds. Maybe the weirdest part of this is that the man almost looks like he’s expecting something from Dean, like he’s—biding his time until Dean does something, or something.
Dean shrugs. “About half an hour on foot on a good day. If the bus decides to show up at the stop in front of the apartment, it’s about ten minutes.”
“No, I won’t,” Dean replies firmly, and Cas visibly relaxes.
happy.
“Dean,” Castiel calls out again, helplessly.
It’s time for him to move on.
The sun shines on the back of Dean’s neck, and it gently and persistently presses down at him as the man steadily looks back with unwavering blue eyes that won’t leave Dean alone, and Dean’s suddenly boiling with rage towards the man. He can’t put a finger to it but something important has been taken away from him, and this man has the answer but he refuses to give it.
Well.
Dean radiates warmth, and Castiel’s breath hitches at the way he feels Dean’s breath on his lips. His stomach tightens, and he’s so dizzy he’s glad Dean’s holding onto him. There’s almost a challenge in Dean’s eyes, a question, as if Castiel would deny what Dean is offering him.
Dean gets out of his bed.
“Oven-baked. Obviously the superior version.”
Castiel stares, ignoring his beating heart. To understand what it feels like to love someone is terrifying, but he won’t deny it anymore. “There are parts that I don’t… It, um. Played with my memories.”
to cover up his first lie? Friends don’t
Dean winces. “I know that,” he says slowly, “but it’s like he feels guilty about whatever it is, or something. He keeps shitting himself every time I walk into the room he’s in.”
“What?” Dean snaps, still not looking at him.
“See you soon,” Bobby says as he drives away.
“I’m a phoenix harpy-human,” Cas replies, and wow, okay, that’s a mouthful. Still completely unbelievable that this is happening, but a mouthful.
Castiel wonders, but he doesn’t ask him to expand on it. He’s sure it was something very important if it had Dean rush back to the bunker like this.
For now, Castiel’s found home here.
Dean dials back down, almost physically leaning away from him. The tension in Dan’s shoulders loosens a little as he listens.
“To help, yeah. I know. Drop the bullshit act,” Dean snaps, and Castiel blinks in surprise. “That’s the farthest thing you want.”
“We do that together every day,” Cas points out.
It is with the all-too familiar twist of disappointment that he sees Sam’s name on his phone screen. It’s unfair of him to be like this towards Sam, he knows—Sam has been considered no less family than Dean has been for him.
Dean and Sam exchange a glance. Sam conveys something to Dean purely through their stare, and Dean hardens his expression and readjusts his jaw. After a beat of glaring at each other, Dean looks up with half of an eyeroll and a sigh.
This in itself is frustrating. He doesn’t want to fight with Dean. Why is it that every time Castiel wants to care about someone, it becomes like… this?
The man looks away from Dean for the first time since their conversation’s started, and huffs out a tired smile. “Yes,” he hushes out, looking back up. “At the gas station before.”
the one who’s gradually disappearing. “Dean, never. I’d never leave you.”
“So it can look down on its prey,” Cas explains.
. They wouldn’t have done that if you were a dick, though.”
They’re not on the table. They’re not anywhere his eyes land on. Dean has followed after him, his pancakes forgotten.
Dean holds up the papers Castiel’s pioneered the past few nights and squints up at them. “Still can’t believe you came up with all these.”
Dean snorts. “Maybe.”
Dean stops him from almost ripping the ghoul’s head off.
“It lied,” Castiel replies automatically, because how could Dean even think that it was true?
“Well, what?”
something like that. And it’s not good to have real thoughts like ‘oh where would I put her’ or ‘how many songs could she hold’ or whatever when I’m not even gonna buy her.”
Cas blinks, and it clicks. “Oh.”
on this planet, human or harpy or otherwise.”
The next morning, Dean finds a series of heart-eyes emoticons as a response. Fucking nerd.
Cas smiles, all sincere and soft. “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel opens his mouth to answer that it was gone by the time he found it. Maybe it was a protection sigil of some sort. It’s how he always answers. He stops himself.
There’s a shuffling sound, and Dean’s getting a bit worried now, because that wasn’t a 'I accidentally knocked something over' sound, but more like a 'I accidentally banged my head against something and possibly passed out on the floor with a concussion' sound.
Cas grinned and nodded, walking towards him to peer over his shoulders. “I know that one,” he said, pointing out
She shows no remorse—only resignation. She expected this. “I’ll tell them what you said. But if you ever change your mind… I’ll be around.”
“Hilarious.” Dean gives a small smile, but it’s more forced, the ease between them gone again. He drops Castiel’s wrists. “Anyway, I should really call Sam. Let him know I’m home.”
Cas offers an awkward smile in return and suddenly the living room is more stuffy than ever, a thin layer of
“Not yet.”
For some reason, it makes Dean laugh quietly under his breath, and the usual hard edges he carries around with him are gone for the night. “I missed you.”
Castiel frowns.
“What do you think your dream world would look like?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbles.
“One more day and that’s it,” Summer says pointedly. “You know I’m already giving you a
Dean glances at him, more out of instinct for having his name called than anything else. Castiel’s lips are dry. Dean looks back down.
Castiel’s breath shortens, and it comes so quietly and so quickly that he doesn’t realize he’s rushing out of the room until he’s already outside. He registers the array of confused voices calling after him, but it’s nothing but cacophony along with his pounding heart. He goes wherever his legs carry him, where there is no demanding or asking him questions or anyone needing him to make decisions.
A headache bids him a good morning. Castiel buries his face further into the pillow with a groan, but he does find a cup of coffee by his nightstand. It’s strong and familiar, as always.
—Cas arguing with a short, blonde guy. “—don’t need all this,” Cas continues, gesturing at the bottles and bottles of deep red liquid that now fills up the entire kitchen counter space. Cas glances at Dean, and sets his eyes firmly back on the man standing in front of him.
The man gives a weary sigh. “There was... a mishap,” he says, like he’s treading on something fragile, something delicate, as if the act of speaking to Dean itself is akin to holding a hummingbird with broken wings. “But you’re making progress like we’d hoped. We’re almost there.”
“Wanna get some fresh air?” Dean suggests.
Dean scratches his nose. His eyes are set on the road, hard and unrelenting. “I guess.” He glances over at Castiel, and a burst of laughter that sounds wrong escapes him. “Seems like you know a whole lot about the case already, so I’m wondering why it’s not solved yet.”
why you gotta come! C’mon, what d’you say, huh?”
“How?” Cas makes a point to snag a brownie off of the plate. “If we’re going by all the criteria you listed on what’s required for a date, we’ve been on a date every day.”
Hannah’s lips thin. “But you
“I’m not an angel anymore.”
“Yeah,
He blinks up those big blue eyes of his at Dean and licks his lips. “Dean.” He rubs his chin and glances back down at the screen. Still blank.
“I just meant—”
“What do you want me to say, Cas? That I want you to relive all the bad shit that happened in our lives? Yeah, no thanks.” Cas narrows his eyes all accusingly and Dean laughs. “Buddy, I donated for a cause that you said was a good thing. I figured it was a win-win. Let me eat my breakfast in peace.”
“You’re Castiel’s mate.”
He's lying.
“Alright,” Dean says with a grin and gives him one last reassuring pat on the shoulder. “Anyway, I got a morning class tomorrow so I’m hitting the hay. Great party, man.”
The words die on his lips as he finds Cas lying on his stomach on the couch, his head propped up with a hand under his chin and a frown settled between his brows as he mutters his readings under his breath. He’s not wearing a shirt.
“What?”
Maybe it
“Ohhhh.”
Cas has so much fondness in the way he looks at him, Dean’s stomach actually
“I know that. There’s been a lot of damage on Earth, and—“
“I already have everything I want.”
, all you do is be paranoid about every
There’s a knock on the door, and Castiel feels justified enough to be wary of visitors to his room at this point.
Sam gives him a weird look, and barely hides his smile. “Since when are you so into insects?”
“I don’t know how long I’ll stick with it,” admitted Dean. “But what’s one more name to add to the list, you know?”
or whatever, and huh, he didn’t know
“Not that I’m saying otherwise,” Cas interjects, “but if we’re not going by harpy customs, and we’re apparently not going by human customs according to you, then what are we going by?”
Despite the universal rule to always go forward in relation to the concept of time, Winter stepped back two steps to Spring, and asked, “Stay with me.”
Maybe, it can be that simple.
” Hannah grits back. “Harpies—
Dean was here for him.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says. It’s with regret that he stands up and away from Dean’s warmth. “I should really get back to my case now.”
Castiel nods wordlessly, and they bid each other a good night before Dean retires to his own room. The click of Castiel’s door is deafening.
In a way, Dean was sure it didn’t even matter if the jukebox was gone or not. Well, maybe it did, but Dean felt… light. Like he could achieve anything he put his mind to. It was the most free he’d felt in years and the whole drive over to the store, Dean only hoped to god that he wasn’t too late in making this choice.
“Jo says she’ll head here as soon as she’s done work,” Charlie says. “God, do you know how nice it is to feel my toes again?”
“I love every aspect of you, no matter how lacking you think you are, or how undeserving,” Cas continues, his voice firm and steady. To the sandwich, Dean’s sure. “No matter what we might go through in the future, know that I’ll be with you, always. Know that you’ll always have me by your side.”
Dean frowns. Maybe Castiel shouldn’t have reminded him how useless he is, but Dean prompts, “So?”
He manages to find the time to stop by the dollar store and scout for deco. None of the blatantly corny looking shit, but still authentic enough that Dean’s willing to put it in their house. It’s not much; just some Halloween stickers that goes on the windows, those pumpkin necklaces that light up he figures they can hang on things, spider webs and little plastic spiders, and one bigger spider doll.
“It’s nice,” Cas continues sincerely. “The enthusiasm is energizing, and the joy in ways humans celebrate different aspects of being alive is infectious.”
Dean rips his eyes away from the sky and onto the ground, almost shyly as he says, “It’s late.”
, Dean?” Cas’s wings flutter a little at the tips. “Have you been
The taste of blood remains in his mouth. The offer itself is enough to cover up any bitterness he might feel for not being offered a place to help out on their case. He’s busy with his own, he reminds himself. Castiel nods with a smile. His lips hurts continuously, the sting amplifying after every pulse of pain. Like a heartbeat. “Alright.”
“You’re the donator?”
“Hm?”
Then everything was cold for quite a while. Not for as long as it was hot, but still cold enough that people nowadays dub it ‘the Ice Age’. There were actually a few of those in between then and now, but when people say ‘the Ice Age’, they usually refer it to that one particularly long period that was featured in a popular animated movie franchise once. This is the time period that’s being described now, and this was around the time when the concept of Winter was born, though they existed for much, much longer than that.
Castiel jerks his head up. Muriel stares back at him, the power behind her voice both familiar and unrecognizable. Angelic. He wonders if that’s how he sounded when he still had his grace.
“I don’t want a lecture, Sam.”
“Aw, are you crying Winchester?” Jo laughs and ruffles his hair, making confetti rain. Dean laughs and swats her hand away. “Don’t cry! Don’t cry!” they chant and Dean laughs some more as he quickly wipes his tears away, these
“Scootch over,” he says, careful to not spill the popcorn. Cas does as asked, but there’s not much more room to move on his tiny ass sofa, so squished together they’ll be. Like every movie night.
Dean finds him on the roof. Everything is painted gold as the sun sets over the horizon. He hears Dean stop behind him, and he looks over to see him basked under the setting sun.
“Actually—” Castiel starts to reply. They’ve had this conversation before. His mouth moves without his will, and his tongue shapes the words without his strength. They remember better than he does. “—it’s quite warm.”
Dean tells him about his day while they eat on the couch with a rerun of
“Cas, what did you
Dean narrows his eyes. “Then why did you ask me about tomorrow
Cas meets Charlie, who’s dressed as a Ravenclaw (“Ravenclaw? You are
It’s not something he deserves. He knows. It may not be something he’ll ever receive. He knows that, too. The simple human things that aren’t simple at all, not to him, not to them. Dean had wanted to save him, but what good would he be without his grace, with what he is now?
Dean catches him coming back from one of his walks one day, and Dean’s panicked look subsides.
Muriel regards him, his unshaven face, the sweatpants he’s worn as both daywear and pajamas, his bare feet. It’s not shame that worms its way into Castiel’s heart, but he self-consciously shoves his hands into his pockets: something he’s seen Dean do many times. He wonders if he looks as stiff. He certainly feels it.
Castiel holds his breath. He waits for an answer. He waits for Dean to walk away. When nothing happens, Castiel bites back a sigh and walks out of the stall. Dean is hovering by the washroom entrance, looking up sharply when Castiel makes an appearance. An array of expressions flashes past before Dean’s face settles into a neutral one.
Summer nods. “She’s gone sour because of it. She’s at her limit, you know. All the plants are, too.”
rights to know what he’s living with here, right? “What are you, exactly?”
“You know it can’t be as simple as that.”
“I heard it happens when you don’t get enough sleep,” Dean says, and frowns with concern over their two plates of apple pie crepes. Dean’s ordered for both of them, and the table is too small that it can barely squeeze in both plates along with a vase of zinnias as a centerpiece. “Are you not getting enough sleep?”
She then jumps out the balcony, and just watching the act gives his stomach a swoop. He rushes outside to watch her flap her giant wings (even bigger than Cas’s) as she soars through the sky.
Castiel shakes his head again. It’s the only thing he can do.
“When did you…?”
“I suppose so.”
, he thinks.
The sweet, artificial smell of apples entices him. The petals of the zinnias sway in the wind. “Yes.”
“Yeah, you’re dreaming. Gotta say, I always knew you were a nerd, but this…” Dean lets out a laugh, but it sounds odd. Strangled. “This definitely takes the cake.”
“You love me?”
He actually thought that Castiel wants nothing to do with the real Dean.
“You,” says Dean angrily and a little confusedly. “Why’re
“What? No. What graffiti?”
Dean focuses back on cooking—because, as one might know, sunny side-up is a style of egg that needs all the attention one’s got—and tops their toasts with some perfectly cooked eggs, and Cas still hasn’t said anything. Finally, after they sit down and start on their breakfast, Cas breaks the silence with: “That’s all you really want from me?”
The door is slightly ajar, and low voices travel from the room. He can see Charlie’s bright hair bobbing sideways as she talks with Dean.
“Cas. Hey.” Dean waves a hand in front of his face. “C’mon, let’s go back.”
“Yes.”
“…told you not to tell him!” Dean says. Castiel’s ears perk up. “Guy’s… enough on his plate…”
Cas seems… busy this week.
Cas flips the pancake expertly—nice and brown on the one side that’s now flipped up. “I heard from Sam that you usually have chocolate chip pancakes for your birthday. I burned a few but I think I have the hang of it now.”
Dean winces. “Sorry about that.”
He’s whistling no particular tune with his shitty cup of coffee sitting on top of his car, and he’s about to get in and drive away when he notices, from the corner of his eyes, someone watching him.
“This world is
“I mean…” Dean scratches the back of his neck. “I’m not saying that you shouldn’t, but maybe one day… you might…”
Nobody really liked that bit, except for Earth who was happy to see an old friend.
“I was. I am.”
’s ass. “You
He stops. He looks behind him. The door is still there, but it’s not his room. Hasn’t he walked more than a few steps since?
“Yeah, but he hasn’t done anything yet.” She chews on the piece mournfully. “He
Castiel looks around the room again as if that’ll return everything back to the way it was. He’s developed an extremely painful headache since— “What ambushed us?”
“What about you guys?” Summer asks. “Still out of sync?”
Dean had noticed, the offness of the air, but they were occupied with Cas’s disappearance that they hadn’t care to investigate it further. “Well, whatever it is, it better fuck off and not do that again.”
“What is it?” Dean asks with low voice. He sees Castiel’s hesitation, and leans in closer. “What?”
“I’m glad you made it back safely, then,” he mumbles, and he’s about to make his retreat when Dean grabs his arm.
He doesn’t know. He didn’t know he was lost until now.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Cas, you’re doing the best you can. There’s no shame in that.”
The idea is to create a force field around the bunker to keep out anything that has ill intentions towards the residents. Infused with an angel’s grace—
“Cas?”
Cas lends him his shoulder for as long as Dean needs it, and they stay that way while the rest of the party gets along without them.
Dean’s not able to find the time to set aside to think over a proper, home-made costume this year despite Halloween fast approaching, bombarded with midterms and projects right beforehand (and isn’t
It’s a very quiet winter. Some adults start to mutter about how unusually warm it is, and children are less than pleased about the lack of snow. But mostly, not a lot of people takes notice and goes about their days.
“On a run, that freak.” Dean rolls his eyes. “He’s always going on about having to stay healthy and shit. Any plans for you today, Cas?”
They pay for their stuff, and Cas stands a little closer to Dean at the bus stop when he notices him shivering, their sides touching. “I’ll keep you warm,” Cas says, and Dean feels warm for a completely different reason.
“And yeah, some people might argue that the shirt is more red or more yellow or whatever, and that’s their own damn opinion, fine, but that doesn’t make reddish orange or yellowish orange more orange than the other. And just because some, uh, primary… colour purists say you can’t call orange for what it is, doesn’t mean orange is going to stop being orange. You can still be just… orange,” Dean finishes weakly. He probably should’ve stopped at the grapefruit example.
faded away. For all he’d done for it, Dean hoped that the universe was ready to grant him one more thing. “Hey, Cas?”
Castiel nods. He holds up his change of clothes. “I’m going to go shower now.”
Dean doesn’t answer.
“Okay, okay.”
“I do,” Castiel replies. The case that he thought was the work of a hybrid. He doesn’t know how to put it all together. He can’t remember a single detail about it. The wound on his arm hurts. “But I want to stay out here a bit longer.”
“What about Thursday?” Cas continues and another new hope that maybe Cas is asking to hang out with him on his birthday rises slightly. “When will you be home?”
isn’t Cas’s immediate family. But…
“How’s that auction of yours going?” Dean asks a few mornings later.
want? To be useful to me?”
As soon as Eileen leaves the kitchen, Sam flings his huge arms out. “Dude, what the hell was that about?”
“I am
Dean sets the mug down, his face as red as the alcohol. “I learned in genetics the other day, that, um, you know, grapefruits are a cross between oranges and pomelos. So I came home and looked this stuff up, ‘cause I thought, that’s pretty cool. I didn’t know that, y’know?” he shrugs. “And apparently, back when they first found grapefruits, people couldn’t decide on whether it was more of an orange or a pomelo. They argued all the time about which one grapefruit should be called as, right, and they actually decided that it’s a pomelo, and yeah, it tastes and looks more like a pomelo than an orange, but a grapefruit is
“Okay.”
“I should really figure everything out before I do,” Castiel says, even if his heart is already set on the decision. He
“I know,” Dean replies, and leans off the counter. “You told me before.”
“It’s a beautiful place.”
Naomi should’ve left him in purgatory.
Cas raises his eyebrows, stares down at the plate of brownies on the coffee table that Dean’s baked earlier today, and back up at Dean.
“Did that meet your expectations?” Cas asked.
“So,” Dean says, tugging Castiel closer. “What now, Cas?”
“I’m nowhere close to solving it.”
? “Do you have a new friend? Have you met someone?”
Castiel lets him lead them to Dean’s room. Dean makes him settle down on his bed while he forages for medical supplies, and redresses the wound methodically—he’s precise and careful, and his attention focused only on the wound. It gives Castiel a chance to get a good full look at Dean.
Dean shrugs. “Something that really didn’t like this place.”
Castiel doesn’t understand.
“Arizona, actually. You knew that.”
“Morning, Cas,” he sing-songs. He’s in a good mood.
He remembers Dean’s frantic phone call when Castiel was still with Hael, when Castiel called him to let him know that Metatron… The way his stomach tightens has nothing to do with the food or how weak his body is. It’s the excuse he uses to lean back against the bedframe.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice calls.
“Are you saying I’m not capable?”
“This is ridiculous,” Cas says with distress. Dean feels queasy in the stomach, too. “Isn’t there anything we can do?”
“Yeah, I guess? I’ve gotten candy-grams during high school and stuff. You know.”
Dean shakes his head. “This whole mess ain’t your fault. I thought we went over this.”
Dean grins. “Yeah?”
—and still he keeps their kiss soft, gentle as they finally navigate this between them.
An arm slings around his shoulders. “Hey, buddy.”
Dean stomps over to Summer with pure hot fury, Cas quickly following behind them. Summer blinks and backs away.
He sees the moment where Sam pauses. Sam slowly looks over at him.
“I don’t…” need to shower either, Castiel almost says, but even he smells the rank that he’s built up over the past few days, wafting just under his nose. “Good idea.”
Dean and Sam sit down in their respective seats, and Castiel hesitates on where he should be for far too long. Dean notices, because he must notice, and pats the seat beside him to direct him. Castiel is glad for it.
There’s a tap against his shoulder. “Hey.”
“Me too.” Cas beams, standing there with his cup of coffee in hand, his hair still ruffled from unconsciously running his hands through it while he looked over his notes. Dean wants to reach over and flick at the strands that are standing up. “Thank you, Dean.”
Dean punches them lightly and Cas laughs quietly, glad to find humour even in such dire times. “Someone’s gotta do it.”
Castiel’s stomach lurches. “What?”
Maybe Dean should get some shut-eyes instead of coffee. He’s been driving for too long and it’s getting to him.
“They’re all fine. The djinn, uh… It really liked your blood for some reason.” Sam hands over a bowl of porridge on a tray.
“On the house,” he says, and leaves them by their corner.
. Dean had put it into Cas’s Zeppelin tape. “Play that one next.”
“Um, okay.”
“No, I don’t,” Cas replies coldly. “I just told you that. What do you do with a date, anyway?”
Dean’s brain betrays him and his thoughts immediately jump from that realization to Cas, sitting right across from him and looking ready to burn his textbook to the ground.
“Consider all you want,” Bobby says, “but we gotta get this ball rolling sooner than later. This ain’t no laughing matter.”
On Thursday, Dean wakes up thinking the house is on fire.
He doesn’t bother Anna with it. He knows she’s busy with her human job and her human life that she’s constructed ever since she chose to leave on her own terms a few years ago.
“What?”
Dean huffs.
candles lit up and ready to be wished upon.
The radio continues to croon in the background as Dean stares at the figure clad in beige sitting beside him. The wind blows through the forest of pines, rustling the leaves in its wake. He looks at peace with himself as he meets Dean’s eyes with fondness that always had Dean wondering if—but Dean never dared to hope that he—
A nice simple black one, maybe, to go with Cas’s hair and feather colour (which Dean gets an eyeful of every once in a while). It’d suit him too, he thinks. Yeah. A nice slick black one, with none of that tassel crap on the ends.
Dean physically recoils a little from where he sits, and Castiel regrets it immediately. “Dean, I didn’t mean—”
from Cas’s room.
Muriel nods. “You’re Castiel, right?” Castiel wishes he could jump out of a window. If only there were windows down here. “
“You know I got nerd club on Thursdays. Speaking of.” Dean rubs his fingers together. “My birthday’s on Thursday and me and a couple of us are going out for dinner. Do you want to come?”
Now he has to live with knowing how that feels.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Uh, I live here if you didn’t get the memo. And where’ve you been?” he asks, trying to not sound too much like a paranoid spouse.
Castiel volunteers to do the dishes since Dean cooked them dinner and the rest of the evening passes quietly. He makes both of them a cup of hot chocolate and Dean sips at it while he complains about his micro-bio workload.
He’s so relieved, he almost feels delirious. The weight of Dean’s arm against his shoulder is grounding. It’s incredible that Dean cares so much, that Dean cares so much about
Cas is the first to unfreeze. “What?”
He closes his eyes again. From somewhere within the depth of this place, there comes a ticking sound not unlike a clock. He counts as the gears turn.
Dean turns from the main road into a smaller path. He doesn’t know how he knows to turn into this side path, but the trees that shape the open sky up above, the wildflowers that pepper the roadside, the green field that stretches out beside him as he drives towards the open horizon, all of it is a part of something that he’s heading towards. The last few days and the rest of his life slowly creep back to him as he drives down the road like he’s re-living a favourite childhood movie, the details so present at the back of his head like it’s always been there and yet he’s somehow completely forgotten about them until now.
“No, you don’t get it. Your problem is
“No,” Castiel replies, and the silence somehow grows more eerily quiet.
Dean’s wondering if he should start on decorating or if he should wait for Cas, when Cas solves his little conundrum by coming back just then to find Dean sitting in the living room, staring at a set of stickers.
It’s nice, the hug. Cas hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder and squeezes with his arms looped over Dean’s arms, encasing him into his embrace. Hesitantly, Dean raises what he can of his arms and squeezes back with Cas snug against his chest, and Cas gives a small content sigh.
What does he think. What does Dean Winchester, trademark Bisexual, think of Cas in jeans with a decorative belt buckle and a (toy) gun strapped to the side, a black vest accessorized with a fake pocket watch, with a red scarf tied around his neck and a dark brown cowboy hat sitting just above his dark brows.
‘cause it’s fun, not because it’s a history documentary.”
Cas makes a pitying sound. Everyone knows how fond Summer is of the ocean’s wonderful coral reefs. “What happened?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean continues. “And funny thing is, until they decided to call it pomelo, they mostly referred to grapefruits as the forbidden fruit or some shit. They couldn’t wrap their little heads around the fact that just because grapefruits have qualities from both oranges and pomelos, it couldn’t be anything other than an orange or a pomelo, depending on who you asked at the time. It was only years after being called a pomelo that grapefruit got sorted as its own thing—as a grapefruit. See where I’m coming from? Yeah?” He makes a juggling gesture, and Cas’s frown deepens.
?” he asks, spitting the words into the air, his finger accusingly poking Castiel’s chest.
“Oh, c’mon.” Sam nudges him with his foot, and Castiel frowns down at Sam’s leg. Sam shoots him a grin. “I know this is important, but it’s good to let your brain rest for a while. Maybe this sort of thing is exactly what you need to get it going again.”
“Of course.”
“What spell?”
“A fever,” Castiel repeats. Such a human thing.
He doesn’t want his resourcefulness to be the only reason they want him. He wants to be enough because… because…
Dean waved the thought away, and he was about to wave Cas off with a flippant comment when Cas stepped right into his space just then, close enough for Dean to see the deeper lines on Cas’s face that had developed over the years. He raised a hand over to Dean’s cheek and for that second Dean sucked in a breath and held it, his heart beating in his ears. Cas gently wiped off the grease that was streaked across his face.
“I’m an angel. I don’t need to eat,” Castiel replies automatically. His stomach growls. Sam raises his eyebrows.
“Why the hell’s the window open?” Dean groans into Cas’s shoulder. He feels Cas glance over to their living room window and gives a shrug. “It’s going to get all cold in here.”
Dean’s not sure what to say to that, probably because he’s only ever been raised as a human. He fumbles around with how to properly respond, but Cas is thankfully not done talking.
“No.”
Dean and Cas share a horrified look. Not the coffee plants.
“Earlier, what I said upset you.”
Dean cocks an eyebrow. Castiel waits for Dean to call him out on his bullshit as he takes a gulp of his beer.
“’S’up, man,” Dean says to Cas, who’s facing the TV as he surfs the channel.
what we’re talking about, isn’t it?”
“I don’t know.”
“D’you see what I’m getting at, here?”
At the lack of an answer, Dean looks down with a sigh, and looks back up with firm eyes. Dean reaches out, and squeezes Castiel’s hands. “Listen, Cas,” he says. “You’d be the most useful for me if you’re happy. Okay?”
Castiel nods slowly. “Okay,” he says, and clears his throat when his voice comes out cracked. “I’ll try.”
Dean slams on the brakes.
“Dean, it’s fine,” Cas says again, and he sounds so pained that has Dean snap his mouth shut. Fuck.
Cas looks down at himself, then back up. “Yes.”
While Summer takes a very brief temporary break away from Northern Hemisphere, Cas turns proper attention back to Dean. “Where were we?” Cas says, but Dean stops them.
Cas smiled too, and somewhere a spring shower blessed a thawing ground and quenched its seedlings.
Instead, Summer shows up again.
Castiel closes his eyes just for a moment to recollect himself.
“The way Metatron spoke about you and the Winchesters…”
“Huh? Yeah. What?”
These humans name the suffocation ‘greenhouse gas effect’ and dub the incident as a result of ‘global warming’ and then this changes to ‘climate change’. Dean frowns in confusion because they already know about greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide and stuff—but like Cas had said, those stuff have always been around. It’s never caused them a problem before, and Cas certainly never had trouble making their way through it until now.
The man’s tensed shoulders drop, and his insistent eyes no longer reflect sunlight as they look away from Dean’s eyes. And for some reason, Dean hates that.
Castiel nods and rubs the residue between his fingers.
“That’s just how humans work,” he added.
the gaps thin during Halloween? Are there alternate realms? Is that actually a thing?”
doesn’t know anything about the dynamic between him and Cas. They’re not like that. They’re friends. They’re roommates. Dean is Cas’s Jiminy Cricket, if he had to put it roughly. Nobody talks about Pinocchio hitting it up with the cricket, though, do they? Same difference, and there’s nothing more or less to it.
Dean’s mind immediately jumps to the person Cas was texting a few days ago. Cas still hasn’t mentioned anything about them, so maybe they’re not friends enough for Cas to mention in the first place. A classmate, maybe? A textbook seller?
“Cas, I didn’t want to mention this, but I…” Dean sighs. “I’m looking out for you, okay? I just don’t think you’re suited for this.”
Dean eyes him one more time, and sighs with an eyeroll. “Let me check with him,” Dean mumbles, and calls Bobby. Castiel doesn’t move from his spot.
“Sure,” Dean replies. He’d been kinda hoping they could hang out for a little bit and the hot chocolate his bribe. “Got a bunch of stuff to do, too.”
“What?” Dean clears his throat. “No. What?”
Dean starts to clean up the mess that was once their dinner. Castiel helps, not pausing to linger his thoughts on the accidental brushes of their hands when they both reach for the bottles of beers.
?” they explode, and a small avalanche happens somewhere.
Castiel nods mutely, and Dean seems strangely satisfied by the sight. Dean also takes the tray and the empty bowl off Sam’s hands, and gently shuts the door behind them.
“And I get it.” Dean shrugs with one shoulder. “Been there, done that. But I don’t see how this is your fault at all. This is all on Meta-douche.”
burnt your tongue off?”
They stand there, with Dean observing the universe and Castiel observing Dean. Dean shifts on his feet slightly. Dean has these moments as well—the quiet ones where no words are needed, so unusual but not unwelcome from the Dean who’s usually so brash, so loud, so active and sure. Either way, he fills up the world with his presence.
“Doing what?”
Castiel knocks, and the conversation halts.
To see him like this, with his cheeks and the tip of his nose pink from the cold, and positively
He registers a low murmur that’s Sam’s voice, and a bloom of conversation that follows after. There’s a small tingling in his chest as he walks towards the scene, as familiar as the kitchen he finds. It’s empty. He frowns. He thought he heard—
Dean only realizes he’s missed his stop after the bus starts driving again and miserably walks back home.
Dean taps his own right arm, and Castiel’s hand shoots up to cover the bandage. “It’s healing.”
Summer nods, still woeful about the coral reefs.
Castiel thinks back to his conversation with Sam. “We’re family.”
“You really think you deserve to live?”
Sam laughs at whatever expression Castiel wears, and claps him on the shoulder one more time before he makes his leave. What a strange thing to be thanked for. He looks back to Dean slouching on his seat, waving a good night at his brother, and maybe Castiel understands after all.
Cas still doesn’t drink any of the stuff, though. And it continues to be that way, until it isn’t anymore, on one Saturday evening.
Castiel stops mixing the ingredients together. “Yes?”
“Look, I was about to have lunch anyway,” Dean says. “Why don’t you join me? I swear it’s not me trying to rope you in or anything,” he adds with a slight chuckle.
you know how to make fonts bigger in a word doc now.”
It’s almost like he’s been waiting to be asked, since Cas goes on and on about all these things about Halloween during their entire way back home, and over dinner. They eat the jack-o-lantern shaped cookies for dessert, and Cas’s smile matches the one on the cookie he holds. He supposes it’ll technically be Cas’s first proper Halloween, so it’d be a shame if Dean’s not a cool roommate who doesn’t care about whether Cas spends his first proper Halloween in a proper Halloween way or not.
“What did it say?”
“Huh?”
“Yeah, stores tend to go overboard with that shit.”
Castiel nods anyway, and lets Dean carefully unwrap the bandage. It’s strangely private even though they’re standing in the middle of an open hallway. Dean sucks in a breath between his teeth. Whatever he sees, he’s not happy with it.
“I’ll remember that for next time, then,” it replies.
“What’re you doing?” Dean asks, and Cas jolts from his seat.
Dean scoops up the atmosphere in their palms and studies it. The humans are right—it’s littered with carbon dioxide, even more so than before the friendly meteor came to visit the Earth. Dean shakes their hand off in disgust. This causes another snowstorm that Dean doesn’t mean to make, and so late into the year, too. Dean’s frown deepens.
Cas is being weird.
“I don’t know
Hannah is the last to enter through the gate. Before she does, she hesitates. She turns back one last time before she releases her vessel.
“Dean,” Castiel replies with exasperation. Dean’s stubbornness is like trying to chip at an immovable wall.
Silently, Cas thinks about how terrible of a year it was and how, looking at the rate of which the suffocation grows, this probably won’t be the only time this happens. Cas can only hope that it won’t happen again so severely.
Seeing Dean’s distress, Cas soothes them with a kiss so gentle that it startles some frogs into waking up from deep slumber. “I know,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s lips. “Dean, I’ll always find you. I promise.”
Dean’s midterms come and go, and he finds out just how much he hates molecular bio all over again, but he’s quick to put that behind him now that he’s free for the weekend.
a looker but he wouldn’t normally
Metatron is smart. They finally come into contact with him through a computer monitor one night, and he is so very cunning with his seemingly defenseless acts and his tempting words, just as Castiel remembers. In front of all the angels gathered in the room, Metatron tries to make Castiel choose between his cause and the Winchesters.
,” Dean replies a little louder.
Before Sam can leave too, Castiel grabs him. “Sam, wait. I—”
and half-
. “I can’t fail you, too. Not again.”
Castiel nods and follows his way back to his room, the smell trailing after him like an afterthought. He slips in under his blankets, and Castiel avoids putting weight on his right arm as he lays back down, back into his dreams.
What if Summer comes instead of Cas again? Did Cas forget all about Dean and leave them for another planet somewhere? What if something happened to Cas?
What he
“Evidence points to one, but the way the victim was killed points to another,” Castiel murmurs. “I’m guessing that it’s a new hybrid of two kinds of monsters. An amalgam.”
. “Can I stay with you?”
He loves him.
Castiel nods. “Thank you, Sam.”
“Do you know anything else about the war going on at all?”
“Dude must’ve joggled your brain pretty good.” Dean taps the back of his head.
Dean tugs at Cas’s coat, but it’s too late. Cas wanders to the nearest produce display, and walks along the display with intent, like he’s at a museum exhibition or something. Cas’s learned a lot since his first year living with Dean, but sometimes, especially times like this, is when Dean is most reminded that his roommate isn’t as human as he appears to be. Well, genetically speaking anyway, that he lives with a half-human, half-phoenix breed harpy person. A Half, Cas called himself the first time when Dean found out, said that it was one of the generic terms for ‘things like him’, but, well, Dean thinks Cas is just as much a human as much as he’s the phoenix breed harpy thing. Cas is Cas. Nothing more to it, really.
“Is everything alright?” Castiel asks, and Dean shakes his head.
“But you found me,” Castiel offers. Dean shakes his head. “Dean, I’d really be dead if it wasn’t for you.”
“Then can’t you go away for a little while?” Dean begs.
“Cas,” Dean breathes, “don’t ever do that again.”
This… whatever it is that they have together has always been comfortable. No, comfortable isn’t the word. They’re used to this, this dance of back and forth, what could be but never will be, and neither have tried to change it from what it is... until now.
Sam coughs behind them. “Cas, I know you’re worried,” he says gently, “but Dean and I checked multiple times to make sure. It really wasn’t our thing. There’s no need for us to waste our time on it anymore.”
Castiel realizes he’s smiling softly. “Hm?”
. “Hello, Dean.”
There is nothing else in the world except for the way his fingers slide along the walls. His eyes don’t adjust to the dark, so it’s hard to make anything out. He comes across a door, but it’s not his room.
He’s not really sure what he’s even looking at, here.
Dean chews with his eyebrows raised. He nods.
“When we talked before, when I asked you if you saw,” Cas says slowly, carefully, his voice firmer with each word, “we
, brain.
desperate for Cas’s attention. He’s a grown-ass man with grown-ass responsibilities and having one friend not pay attention to him for one week shouldn’t get to him like this so much. “What’s up?”
They pay for their stuff, and head back to the bus stop. “So you never did Halloween before.”
“Out of everyone I’ve met, you…” Cas’s mouth hangs open slightly, and they search for the right words. “I wanted you to know, but I was never going to act out on it. I was scared that you’d…”
“Cas!” Dean bellows, and runs after him too late, the room door almost slamming against his face. “Dude, this is like violating every single roommate code that’s ever existed,
A sharp pain pierces his head, and Castiel topples. If he doesn’t focus, the pain isn’t there. As soon as he notices it, it’s impossible to ignore. “This case wasn’t our thing.”
Silence meets him, and Dean rattles on the doorknob since that usually annoys the hell out of Cas. “C’mon, you selfish prickly asshole! You can’t drink all the hot chocolate and not tell me
Everything pauses for a split second.
Dean stands there like the useless idiot that he is, and the man doesn’t say anything else. Dean picks something off the shelf beside him to have something to do. It’s a bag of pork rinds. Gross.
“Right, so… you do know.”
“Why not?”
. Dean manages a little awkward wave before he decides to join him. They’re headed the same way anyway, so no biggie.
“I’ll stay,” Castiel replies a little too quickly, maybe a little too eagerly. Dean smiles anyway, and bobs his head.
“Alright,” Dean echoes. “Well, I’m beat. Let’s get some sleep in us.”
He finds himself wandering over on youtube to find his own resources to devour on inbetween the work reports he’s gotta write, and he ends up watching insect-related videos until three in the morning, sucked into interesting facts about different types of insects he didn’t even know existed until now. He grabs a shoddy phone photo of a velvet worm on his computer screen, since that guy’s got its little feet around Dean’s heart since the movie night, and sends it to Cas with the caption “
“That’s a human name,” said Spring one year. They were sweeping through the South Pole to arrive at the North Pole, with Dean ahead and Spring following suit as usual.
Sam nods curtly, his lips pressed together. “How about you?”
“Anthropology,” Castiel says. “Are you the landlord?”
“No.”
Castiel nods. He understands the level of horror Bobby is displaying. “There are many things humans don’t know of. Not even me.”
Sam chokes out a laugh. “He really made you pancakes?”
“Spring hasn’t arrived?” Summer’s frown deepens. “But that makes no sense.” Summer scratches their head and after some thought, gives a shrug. “Well, time for you to go, Winter. Autumn’s expecting you.”
“Goodbye, Hannah.”
“Nope,” Charlie replies miserably.
Later, Dean checks his phone and smiles at all the messages he’s gotten. He calls mom and talks with her briefly before she hands the phone over to Sam, who happily greets him back.
“It’s more fun at a showing with more people,” Dean says as Charlie hands out the bells, “but these kids are all nerds so you’re probably okay.”
“I suppose it’s good that we have the distinction, in a way. I’m not a full harpy. It’s… not who I am, Dean. But I’m not a full human, and that’s not who I am, either.” Cas sinks a little more into the couch. “But they always make Half sound so…”
The hallway goes on for forever in the dark. He comes across a door, but it’s not his room. He squeezes the doorknob and tries the door, but it’s firmly locked. He continues onward. Has this place always been so endless?
Castiel shifts in his seat. His back hurts. “Angels don’t sleep.”
Cas turns the TV off, and Dean cooks them a late dinner. Cas helps with the dishes after, and Dean heat themselves two cups of hot chocolate to sip at.
He looks up to meet the waitress’s green eyes. Two hollow burnt holes stare back at him.
Dean is smiling fondly at him, and Castiel hesitates to ask about what’s been on his mind ever since he saw Dean. Right now, it feels like a good moment to bring it up. “Dean.”
And when Spring arrived, Winter fell in love completely and unequivocally. Spring was beautiful, with fresh greens and gentle rainfalls and flower buds that swayed in the cool afternoon breeze, ready to burst with honey. Spring arrived gently but firmly, quietly but brilliantly, ready to wake everyone up from their deep slumber.
“Dude, when did you guys plan all this?”
“Huh?”
Castiel was so sure, but maybe Dean’s right. “Maybe.”
He can’t ask.
“Buy what?”
we have to work together to keep me up there! Now I’m all over the place and my ice caps are melting and do you have any idea just how long it took me to make those—”
“Cas,” Dean says again; wraps the word around his tongue. He’s here. He’s
“Yeah.” Dean stares at where Cas was just standing. The smell of pancakes still lingers in the house.
Castiel looks at what it offers him. It did a good job of copying the Winchesters’ home—it feels exactly as Castiel remembers it. Welcoming. Warm. Home. It doesn’t understand the significance of what it had given him.
hot— but Dean’s starting to really get the hang of this. Cas seems like he’s responding better too, with the way his back arcs slightly and the way he lets out a sigh every once in a while as his wings shudder under Dean’s touch. Cas’s wings flutter out of Dean’s grasp then, standing up abruptly and almost leaving Dean with a handful of feathers.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel puts the cup down. “Where’s Sam?”
“Was,” Dean corrects. “You Fell. You chose this.”
“What?”
grace—it should be strong enough to keep out most of the evils. After they’re done with the bunker, they head to the Impala.
“Why don’t you… uh, stay the night? Unless you have somewhere to be—”
Hannah gives a small laugh, but soon turns solemn. “I understand what it feels like to not be able to go back home. It’s the only reason why he did all this in the first place, and… if we keep him locked in there, who knows what he’ll do.”
Castiel tries not to feel guilty about Dean’s momentary discomfort from his naturally higher body temperature and steps away from him. “How far is this place from campus?”
“Cas helped.”
Cas’s grin widens. “Hello, Dean.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Uh… I can be out of the house tomorrow too, if you need me to be.”
It’s a nice day outside. It’d be a shame to be stuck in the house all day and be unable to appreciate it.
“What?” Dean looks at where Castiel points to, and shrugs. “Sure. You probably didn’t notice before.”
“What situation?”
They haven’t talked since Dean asked him about the gates to Heaven. Castiel assesses Dean to check if he has any wounds from his trip, and finds Dean watching him in the same way. Castiel averts his eyes.
What is he doing here?
Cas’s wings twitch in place like he’s trying to hold them very still just like how he holds himself right now as he stares at Dean with disbelief. His face grows more and more crimson until the tips of his ears are bright red.
The weather has been perfect for Castiel but he appreciates the offer. “I’m alright, but thank you.”
“Dean, I—”
She laughs. “I learned. The poison could’ve spread from your mind to his, but he wouldn’t listen.” She glances at the hole still evident on the wall.
Muriel wrinkles her nose, taking in Castiel’s half-eaten plate of fries. “When was the last time you left the room?”
The djinn poison was contagious. Castiel had thought the case involved a hybrid.
Castiel feels Dean tense beside him, but neither Dean or Sam try to do anything to stop him. He has a choice, and that alone is enough.
Dean’s thumb absently rubs Castiel’s knuckles. He’s using his own arm as a pillow, folded under his head. “We’re better together, Cas.”
“Is that what
He sits up, wishing for a cup of coffee. He shuffles out of the bed he’s not used to, disoriented from the blanket of sleep that still fog his thoughts. He stumbles out the door, and follows the source of the scent into the kitchen, wrinkling his nose when he smells the same wet, musky smell within the aromatic coffee. There’s a cup neatly sitting on the table, the friendly sight of steam inviting him in.
Dean swallows down the words.
“Well, it was… half a year.”
“Dean?”
“Who knows,” Sam says distantly, already heading down the stairs for the door. “You coming?”
Dean swings a punch and Michael leans away, leaving with a flap of his wings and leaving echoes of his words behind.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says quietly. It feels fragile and Castiel holds his breath. “Cas, I should’ve looked for you sooner.”
“Hey, it’s my birthday. Give me some credit here.”
Thankfully, Cas’s voice calls back from the kitchen. Not very thankfully, Dean hears another voice murmuring alongside Cas’s.
Dean kisses him, and Castiel responds with his own, and to love and be loved in return, to be so sure of something so good is incredible. They stay like that for a while, just until Castiel is a bit more calm, just until the cramp Dean gets in his arm from Castiel leaning against him is gone, just until they need to go back to dealing with responsibilities.
He’s wrestling with one of the toilets when there’s an unmistakable sound of footsteps coming down the metal steps of the front foyer. Castiel pauses. The footsteps are too sure in their steps to be an intruder. They pause suddenly and backtrack almost frantically.
He is here simply because he can be.
Dean drives faster.
an orange,” Cas replies.
“I,” Castiel tries faintly, but nothing forms. He drags a hand over his mouth. His hands are trembling, so he clenches them into fists to steady them. “I just wanted to make sure.”
Even if they were never at the same place for too long, Winter knew when Spring was close by and always eagerly waited for them. Spring always knew that Winter would be waiting for them upon their arrival, and this gave them enough strength to count down to the days when they will meet again. You may have experienced the days when they
“What? No. Cas, that’s—”
The muscle in Dean’s jaw jumps as he clenches down on them. His fists are gripped tightly, and his green eyes shine brightly against the lamp on his nightstand.
This is his reality now. This is his home starting from now on, the starting point of his second life where he has to start all over again. A group of humans walk by while they laugh about something. The tour group moves along to the next building and the guide shoots into an explanation again.
There’s a buzz in his ears, and it’s like someone’s stuffed him full of cotton. There’s a sort of numbness that Castiel can’t repel, but he tries to smile so it would match the one Dean now wears. He tries to accept the confidence behind every word Dean speaks.
“What’s that smell?” Dean asks, and walks into—
Dean’s lips are a tight line, and Castiel studies his face to make sure that he heard him correctly. The only indication that anything happened at all is the way Dean’s hand falters a little in action, slowing down as he focuses on receiving Castiel’s answer. Castiel swallows around the lump that’s formed in his throat.
The café is bustling with activity, but Castiel’s eyes are naturally drawn to where Dean sits on the balcony, slouched in a small white chair. He’s fidgeting with a fork with his eyes darting around in search of Castiel as he takes a sip of water. Dean stops jiggling his foot when he sees him, and waves him over. His eyes trail down and back up. “Hey.”
Is he disappointed that he can’t spend his birthday with Cas? Yeah. But he also knows how much Cas hates waking up in the morning and yet he still found a way to work around it just to cook his dumb roommate some birthday pancakes. Just the fact that he put that much effort into this means… everything.
“I’ve been coming and going for a little while until… you know.” He doesn’t want to know. “Until everything ends.” He doesn’t want to care. “Can I come in?”
Cas smiles and nods.
And what little hope he had left sinks down to the soles of his feet, so much that he could stomp them out completely right there and then. “It’s cool. What are you doing anyway?”
His wariness doesn’t grow less when he finds Dean on the other side, and sucks in a panicked breath. “Hello, Dean.”
Dean glares up, and Castiel holds his angry gaze. He takes every emotion Dean’s willing to give him. “Dean, I can’t know why you’re upset if you don’t talk to me.”
“When did I say that? You sure you’re okay?”
There’s a sigh that pierces through the silence.
“I don’t know. I just never have.” Dean took a daring glance up at Cas. He gulped. “If I think about it too much then my head climbs up and up and up… and I end up with
No. “I’m still looking.”
Sam murmurs a good night, but Castiel is too busy staring at the plates of pizza laid out on the table. It’s hard to believe they were having a peaceful dinner just a few minutes ago.
“Dean?”
“Why, ‘cause you don’t trust me?”
“Uh huh.”
“What’s for dinner?” Cas demands sleepily. Dean huffs, and tells him it’s mac n’ cheese. “Stovetop or from the oven?”
Dean Winchester regards the woman standing in his living room, and concludes that it’s been a long day. “Roommate,” Dean corrects, slinging his bag off onto the floor.
Dean gives him a firm pat on the shoulder just for the sake of it and goes back to his room, typing into his phone as he goes. He searches up the right post and makes a new email account, types in a few words, and refreshes the spreadsheet until he’s satisfied with what he sees. He nods to himself, and goes on with the rest of his day.
And that’s a good thing. That’s a healthy good thing that Cas has got going on. He’s just not sure why he feels so shitty about it.
The man is there at the next highway stop. He’d entered the convenience store after Dean and pretended to read something from a magazine rack, but when Dean had caught him glancing at him, the man had quickly averted his eyes back into the safety of the magazine.
“Of course, Dean.”
More like, why does
Of course he… But they still need to focus on the situation. He still needs to focus on the case.
, he thinks.
“Why did you move further down South?” Dean asks, just about ready to kick
is Heaven?”
“You’re still my friend. You know that, right? This doesn’t—change anything.” Dean swallows. “You’re still you.”
Dean doesn’t get a wink of sleep.
“What the fuck?” Dean circles around Cas with fear gripping their heart. Cas looks so, so tired. “Cas?”
And the rest of the day goes normally, like nothing’s happened at all.
Cas nods mutely, and his fingers twitch again. He searches the floor for something, Dean doesn’t know what, but when he looks up to meet Dean’s eyes, they’re cautious, open, hopeful. “I wanted to tell you.”
The look melts away to be replaced by a soft smile. “I know that.”
Cas smiled all soft and knowing and this time, Dean didn’t ignore the flutter that came from the sight. He did fumble with the quarters but nobody could fault him for that. “Anyway, let’s give ‘er a whirl.”
“Hey,” Dean says, poking his head out from around the corner, “I’m making hot chocolate. Want some?”
“Stay.” Dean opens his arms, silently gesturing at Castiel to come forward. Castiel’s body prickles. “Stay here.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says with a big beautiful grin. “What took you so long?”
Misunderstanding his lack of reply as not recognizing what Dean’s talking about, he continues, “It said that you—” Dean huffs, unable to meet Castiel’s eyes like he usually does. “And hey, I get it. But if you couldn’t stand me to the point of—changing me entirely—you should’ve said so from the get-go.”
Cas pauses in his act of putting bread into the toaster. Dean internally kicks himself and cracks some eggs without meeting Cas’s eyes. He gives a quick glance over to Cas, who’s giving him the most charged stare he’s ever seen.
“God,” she says. “I’m going to die. Straight up freeze my ass to death.”
big of a deal for Cas to look so pleased that Dean remembered that Cas doesn’t like eating chicken (“Is it like… borderline cannibalism for you guys?” “Not so much cannibalism as it feels… wrong for me to eat. Would you ever eat a monkey?”). His face is warm as he hands him his plate and he still doesn’t cool back down when he’s sitting in his spot with his own plate.
Charlie interjects, and Dean grows quiet again. “You guys seriously need to talk.”
where he repeats it all puzzled like Dean just hasn’t said the most awkward thing in the world.
Castiel jolts awake. His heart pounds in his chest as he stares up at the white ceiling. He takes a deep breath, letting the air circulate his lungs that expand, and deflate as he exhales.
Weird.
Is he fucking with him? It’s not April, so it can’t be April Fool’s day. Halloween’s not for another month. Cosplay? Is this cosplay?
“I won’t let you sit here and think that this is all your fault somehow.” Castiel itches to pull Dean in towards him, but he doesn’t. “Dean, it isn’t.”
Tick.
Dean is whistling by the time he’s standing in front of the club door. It’s kinda weird that nobody else is here at this time—usually they’d all stand here briefly catching up until Charlie shows up with the keys.
His brain short-circuits. Dean blinks. “Excuse me?”
.” She shoots a grim smile. “But Jo and I sent our landlord an email briefly mentioning the HUD, and he replied saying he’s booked a repair guy. Right away! Can you believe this guy?” She sniffles. “Except today is Friday, so repair guy won’t be here until Monday at the very least. I just know that my ass is out of that house as soon as the lease is up.”
on that.”
he meant when he said he wants to stretch his wings out, and Dean runs away from
And this time, with their hand linked over the jukebox, Dean leaned over and kissed Cas properly. Cas’s arm wrapped around his waist and pulled them closer, deepening the kiss with another breath taken between them. Dean only realized he’d closed his eyes when he opened them again, and Cas was grinning at him with his lips red and sweet from their kisses.
Dean repeats this in his head, but nope, he still literally didn’t answer anything. “So—what, you can,” he wiggles his fingers in front of his mouth, “breathe out fire or something?”
you!” Layla laughs and comes in for a hug. “I didn’t know you went here.”
Castiel nods, a flutter in his heart. “I wish I could’ve been there.”
” with another article–about ants that let themselves be healed unless they’re actually dying–as a response to Cas’s recently sent article. He gives Cas some time to read over it, and works on his report while definitely not waiting for the buzz of his phone for a reply.
Dean helps Cas up on their feet and pulls them into a firm hug. After they release each other, Dean says, “Hey, look at me.”
They’re at Cas’s place today, stuffed together into his tiny sofa while Dean wiggles around for more butt room.
“You’re nothing like Dean.”
Dean reaches up and touches the side of the cup with his finger. He can feel the warmth seeping through the paper cup. “What the fuck,” he announces. “What are you, a fucking dragon? Jesus.”
Dean sets down a bun with some sort of shredded pork that’s been seasoned with red sauce and topped with cheese. “Dig in while it’s hot,” he says.
Dean charges him and Michael looks on passively as he dodges the punch Dean throws and snaps his arm behind his back to quickly subdue him onto the ground like a trainer would a rampant animal. It’s over in a blink of an eye and Dean can’t do anything but kick and shout until Michael kicks him to try to keep him down.
Castiel frowns upon seeing it, and looks up to soak up the sight of the blue morning sky for the last time.
he would, but he
Castiel doesn’t feel it—not as intensely as Dean can—but he can relate. “Yes.” He notes Dean’s flushed cheeks from the cold.
“Uh… huh.”
Castiel fails to see what this has anything to do with the current conversation, but he humours him and nods.
“Ah. We saw his body.”
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel puts the cup down. “Where’s Sam?”
of this. His death was supposed to be the point where they moved on. They have Jack back now and Sam and Cas aren’t going anywhere and—they were going to be happy. They were going to be genuinely
“Not really. How about yours?”
“Yeah, and what’s up with that? You’re an angel, man. Aren’t you supposed to, I don’t know, know all of God’s creatures by default or something?”
This could be perfect.
“Oh.” Castiel supposes this is his cue to leave, and he’s unable to do much else at this sudden turn of events. Dean stays seated, and doesn’t face him. “Okay.”
“It’s not that bad, is it?” Dean’s had to take one before, when he needed an easy science elective. “I
. It’s all worth it.
He feels sick.
A table is snapped in half like something heavy’s been thrown over it, and the remnants of a lamp are scattered on the floor. One of the chairs has been flung across the room and shattered into pieces, and there are scattered books everywhere. Dean is staring down at him with pieces of furniture in his arms.
This is nice. He likes hugs. He also never knew just how strong Sam is by human standards.
“Oh. Um.” Sam glances between them. So Castiel isn’t mistaken about the cutting edge in Dean’s voice. “Sure.”
Sam studies him warily. “Is that okay with you?”
He’s back to himself now. This is who he’s always been to them.
he’s completely fine Cas, why wouldn’t he be, and the next thing he knows, he’s in his room closing the door behind him.
“Who else?” she asks. “Who else, Castiel?”
want something, it’s… I try not to think about it too much.”
, and if he’s ever had to pick a moment to relive over and over again for the rest of his life, he’s pretty sure this night is one of them.
Dean glances over his shoulder. Cas doesn’t notice the way Dean’s fingers turn white against the hood of his car.
“Hello,” Castiel whispers back. It seems appropriate.
“No,” Castiel replies, and regrets it immediately. He just came back from his walk, and he’s thirsty. He looks back at the kitchen, and his stomach lurches. He turns, and walks away.
Dean says. “Yeah. No, that’s not gonna cut it. Not this time. So you can take your little apology and you can cram it up your ass.”
He looks at the gate of Heaven. It’s a matching set. He smiles.
“Night, Cas.”
Dean shrugs. “I figured maybe we could go for dinner after nerd club if people are free. I’ll invite Cas too, if that’s cool.”
He misses his family. He misses his friends. He misses home.
“What happened to him?”
One of those things people put on their front lawns for Halloween.
“I was attacked by a moth last night,” Dean announces as he enters Cas’s apartment. Cas looks up with a confused frown. “Seriously.”
“Thank you, Dean.” He clears his throat. “I think that’s good enough.”
Dean leans back and gapes while this fucker
Summer frowns. “I should be the one to ask
After that’s the clean-up, and then back home. Charlie seriously invites Cas to come to their nerd club the next time he’s around, and he thanks her for the invite. Dean watches the exchange as Charlie hugs Cas, and he tears up a little, but that’s really dumb so he’s going to pretend it didn’t happen.
“Cas?”
“My ideas are always good.” Sam eyes his trench coat, and his suit underneath. “You want me to throw your clothes in the wash?”
He makes them both a cup of hot chocolate one night like usual. When he brings it to Cas in his room,  Cas freezes up with his phone in hand.
“I know,” Anna says quietly and it’s somehow relieving to hear that he isn’t the only one. “I get it. It’s scary. Trust me, I get it. But hey,” she says brightly, “if I can do it, then so can you. I’m here for you. Okay?”
“Do I fix up a good breakfast, or what?” Dean grins, his lips glistening with syrup. Castiel wants to lean in and kiss it away, and dismisses the thought.
“What do they want?”
“It’s fine,” says Cas from the other side of the door, sounding slightly miffed. “Did you need something?”
Dean sighs.
“I—” Dean flushed. “I’m not! I’m just trying to be realistic here.”
Dean stares down at his finger, coated with ingredients. “This won’t wash off or anything, right?”
Dean takes in a sharp breath, and it’s too loud in the silence.
The man seems surprised to suddenly find himself the focus of Dean’s attention, but he doesn’t budge otherwise. He just… keeps on watching Dean. It should creep him out, but Dean finds himself staring right back.
Cas nods. “It’s very… dramatic.”
“Tell me about it,” Dean says. “My roommate’s in the same course as you. I hope your group wasn’t as bad as his.”
Dean’s eyes flicker over him for something to pinpoint. Maybe something to prove him wrong. When he doesn’t find anything, he lets go with a breath, and fixes his eyes back on the road.
And still he walks throughout the night, until sunlight spills over the horizon and paints the miles before him. He loses time in his state, unaware of everything around him except for the echo of his own words in his mind.
“Hey, Cas.”
“That’s fine!” Dean laughs, though he doesn’t mean to sound rude about it. Cas, however, glares. “Cas, of course you don’t know jack shit about how humans do things.
. He just… didn’t expect a ‘no’, he supposes.
“Winter,” says Summer. “You have to come to terms with the fact that we can’t do anything about it.”
“Is it?” Dean smiles tightly. “I’ll have to remember for next time.”
. “Yes.”
“Halloween’s close, so I figured, why not?”
It’s still a Thursday night and everyone present at the party occasionally try to be responsible students so they all take off around eleven after helping Dean and Cas clean the place up, leaving Dean with many, many hugs. When he locks up and turns away from the door, Cas is standing there in front of him holding a pizza box with leftover pizza and a smile, his wings draped behind him all loose and relaxed.
one black feather neatly lying on the couch, but otherwise, nothing.
Sam walks into the kitchen then, holding a bottle of water. “Oh, hey, Cas.”
Dean grinds his head down against Cas’s as a response. Cas laughs at the almost-nuzzle, and it’s answer enough.
Guilt, maybe. Or maybe, that this isn’t something he deserves to have. It’s something he won’t be able to get enough of once he tastes what it’s like to have it for even a fraction of a second. He’d be left with a craving that will never be satisfied until he can't keep it contained anymore and it'll spill out for the world to see.
“Yep,” Dean says cheerfully. “Turns out it’s not our thing.”
Dean grimaces at the sip of his burnt as fuck coffee while he walks out of the highway rest stop. Out of all coffees he’s had on the road, this has got to be the worst one yet. Still, something about the clear sky today makes sure to keep Dean’s mood light.
fault that Castiel chose to be with the people he loves. Castiel would joke that yes, he supposes it technically is, since Dean’s the one who is so wonderful and so incredible that Castiel ended up loving him so very much, but he can’t quite bring himself to say so while looking at the utterly stricken look of guilt clouding Dean’s beautiful face.
Sam’s expression falls. He runs his fingers through his hair, his eyes directed at the ceiling. “Cas, I couldn’t close the gate of Hell.”
. “Yes?”
“Cas,” Dean cuts into this thoughts. “C’mon, man. What’s stopping you?”
“Yes,” Cas replies. “But I don’t have a costume, and I don’t think we have time to find something for me.”
Castiel looks down at the page he was reading, and rubs his eyes. He knew exactly what it was talking about just now, but now the moment he tries to focus on the words, they jump around the pages. “I’m dreaming.”
Dean gives their best shit-eating grin at Summer, delighted that Cas is just as eager to be here with them as they are. Cas’s grip on Dean tightens a little and Dean’s grin widens. Upon seeing this, Summer sighs and rolls their eyes.
Today’s Valentine’s day.
“They were all important.” Castiel curls his hands tightly into fists. “All those people, all of my brothers and sisters that I failed. I—” He can’t stop trembling, not out of fear, but out of rage. “How long have I been in here?”
She straightens, her fingers twitching. Dean eyes them warily in case of the slightest chance she might break out the talons he’s heard so much about. “Hannah, Castiel’s cousin. I’ve come to ask your intention.”
Castiel pointedly pulls his gloves off.
“Hot today, huh?” Dean says conversationally. “Do you want some water or anything to drink?”
“Where will you put it?” Cas asked.
“Are you sure?” she asks. “It’s still not too late if you want.”
Dean’s lips quiver. His Adam’s apple bobs. “Hey, Cas.”
He looks back to the dark hallway behind him.
“But it’s cold out,” Cas whines.
Cas closes their eyes and nods. “I’ll try, Dean.”
“Cas.”
He walks up the metal stairs that echo underneath his feet, and he walks out the heavy metal door that shuts behind him with a final creak. Briefly—so briefly that it’s but a fleeting thought that passes between his breaths—he considers stopping. He considers, for a brief heart-stopping moment, just to see if he could hear footsteps chasing after him.
“Good, right?”
“Dean—”
“No,” Castiel says and looks back at the room. Truthfully, he’s not sure about the roommate situation. He’s never had to live with anyone but his family before let alone a stranger. He’s never had to live without his family before.
They part with a shared breath, but only just far enough apart for Dean to look at Cas in the eyes.
“Nothing,” Sam replies. He’s by the laundry machine with a confused flush across his face. “I found a bunch of rocks in our laundry, and it almost took out the glass at the front.”
Having this line of thought makes Castiel burn with shame even more.
“I love you, too,” Cas says, his eyes fixed on Dean. “Drink your coffee.”
“But you left,” Dean cuts firmly. “That’s all that matters in the end.”
Still warm.
Dean frowns. Definitely not the way he thought this conversation was heading. “Uh huh.”
, or he can’t sit down to watch an episode of a show they’re watching together because he’s doing
Dean opens his mouth to say something, and closes it again with a confused frown. It gives Castiel enough time to launch into an explanation.
wasn’t the one to—
Dean blinks, and lets out a genuine laugh that shakes the bed, and the sound is warm gold that trickles down to Castiel’s heart. “No, I mean—shit.” Dean brings Castiel’s hand up and lays a soft kiss, a brush of his lips. “I mean all of us. We’re stronger together, so…” He swallows thickly. “Don’t say shit like how it’s none of my business, or that I have nothing to do with it.”
“The auction is based entirely around creating stories and art for people who consume existing media and literature.” Cas pauses. “Supernatural being one of them.”
“You will always be one of us, Castiel.”
Dean smiles and it hurts his face, and he shrugs with one of his shoulders, like ‘eh, whatcha gonna do’. Cas is still frowning and looking up and down at Dean now, like trying to figure out if he’s got fetishes Cas doesn’t know about, and is about to start up a Sharing is Caring chat or something now that they’ve apparently come to this point in their relationship.
Dean searches his face, and Castiel cocks his head to the side as their eyes meet. “You know,” Dean drawls, “you don’t need to shoulder everything by yourself. You know that, right? You’re not alone anymore.”
Dean nods, and reluctant as they are, they take their leave. When they look back (against the rules but fuck the rules), Cas gives a small wave but soon they’re out of sight as Dean crosses over the oceans.
“Oh. Thank you.”
Dean realizes he’s staring, so he rips his eyes away to stare at something less interesting than Cas fiddling with his textbook. Anywhere that’s not Cas or those wings sprouting out of his back or his very naked chest staring back at him.
Dean waves him aside. “You’re only human, Cas. And,” Dean continues, “I think it might be best if you let me and Sam handle this one.”
wasn’t the one to not turn off the living room’s lights off, or
Cas frowns down. His wings twitch again. “I don’t know.”
The world teeters on an edge, and it tilts, and tilts, and spins Castiel around until he can’t think anymore. Castiel needs this case to hang onto.
for things which I’m sure make no sense to
There’s an uncomfortable tension in the air now, and one that Dean’s obviously not attuned to since he has no idea what the fuck they’re
Anyway. It’s ridiculous, the idea of dating
Castiel would be lying if he didn’t say he’s been waking from nightmares of being back in his dreamscape, and at those times he’s undone his bandages to check if the wound was still there to make sure he’s truly back. Somehow the unhealed wound seems like another one of his failures, and he doesn’t want Dean to see it.
Dean blinks. “What do you mean, why am I here? I’m here to get your ass out.”
Dean holds his hand out as a silent invitation, and the faint panic subsides. His warmth runs through Castiel’s arm as Dean squeezes his hand.
Layla frowns. “This course doesn’t have a group project.”
Dean takes a deep breath. He tries not to be sick inside this bar he recognizes too well.
It’s not really a look Dean likes on him, to be honest.
today despite being September that he just really,
Dean knocks on Cas’s door. “Cas? You okay?”
“Cas hasn’t shown up. I wanted to see them before I left. It’s always been like that.”
Cas stopped beside him and nudged one of his legs with a foot. “If you wanted it so much, why didn’t you buy it?”
Hannah looks at him knowingly now, and drops her arm. “Yes. She does.”
“What?” Dean blinks. “No, I just—” He stops with his mouth open. “Uh.” He licks his lips. “Nevermind. So hey, look at you, out and about. Had enough of the TV for company?”
Hannah smiles back.
Cas grins. “I did. They all care greatly about you.”
“Is this alright?” Cas’s voice rumbles.
Castiel shuffles with guilt. “Still.”
Their bus comes then, and they lug their groceries to their seats. “So, yeah,” Dean continues. “It’s mostly going around in costume getting chocolate from your neighbours and carving out pumpkins when you’re a kid.”
“Yeah, sure man. Let me know if you ever want another massage,” he says to Cas’s retreating back, who gives him a thumbs up without turning back and goes straight to his room.
“Cas, what’s going on?”
“So, Cas.” Dean takes a swig of his bottle. Their shoulders are almost touching. Always, almost touching. “Any plans after you tidy this case up?”
The door opens so carefully, Dean swallows a pang of guilt as Cas comes to view, barefoot and in his pajamas. “Yes?” he says, his expression guarded.
Cas rips his eyes from the TV and admits, “I have no idea.”
A whole week passes by and it’s a Tuesday night when Cas stands in front of him sitting in the sofa with a, “Dean.”
Dean straightens, like he isn’t sure what to do with the response, but soon his easy grin is thrown back on his face. “Alright,” he says. “Just know I’m around if you need me.”
The case is a standard salt-and-burn, but Castiel’s breakthrough during their research becomes crucial to finding the remains. They stare down at the burning corpse in the pit they’ve created, and Dean thumps him on his back.
“She created the Grand Canyon.”
Cas is close by.
“I said to drop it,” Dean says weakly.
“There you go again, with the grand scheme, yada yada.” Dean grins delightfully at Castiel’s disapproving frown. “Your choice always makes a difference, Cas.”
Castiel nods. With the promise in mind, he passes back out.
Organizing the books, on the other hand, is hectic. Dean wants to shove them into wherever they’ll fit, but Sam insists on taking this opportunity to sort them. Thus beings their meticulous task of going through Bobby’s entire book collection.
“Uh.” Dean blinks. “Everything alright?”
“The coral reefs,” Summer says between sobs. “They’re dead.”
“Wha—No I wasn’t!” Dean gave a tattering huff as Sam and Cas walked away. “Guys, come on!”
thing,” Dean says. “You hear me? We can lay low for a few days, catch up on the rest we’ve missed out on, y’know?”
Castiel blinks, snapping back to attention. “What?”
“I’m just…” He’s high-strung but has no way to deflate, almost vibrating with energy meant to be spent.
“Hello, Dean.” Both eyes shoot up to meet him. “Sam.”
Oh, right. Dean forgot about that part where he’s actually gotta decide on what he wants from Cas. He shrugs while he gets out the frying pan. “Hell, you could just give me a hug and call it a day.”
think it over and go through every reason on why he shouldn’t buy this jukebox only for Cas’s words to echo back to him. It took him a while longer to actually muster up the courage to knock on Cas’s door. But he did eventually knock on his door, and when he did, Cas was there on his feet, ready to kick back in the passenger seat on their drive to the store where they saw the jukebox.
“Okay, what the
“On a run, that freak.” Dean rolls his eyes. “He’s always going on about having to stay healthy and shit.”
Dean slows to a stop as tires meet gravel, and he finds himself at an abandoned factory with a set of stairs that lead to the metal door of the Bunker. Sam’s probably inside and ripping his precious hair out from worry, so Dean sends a quick text to let him know that he’s almost there, that he’s almost home. He gets out of the car just as a beat-up truck slowly pulls up behind him, and the last piece to undo the spell slots together to bring him home.
He has a slight bounce to his steps on his way back, no worries for tomorrow and nothing to do tonight except to hang out with good company and chill. Needless to say that he’s wholly unprepared for the sight that greets him when he steps into his apartment.
Dean nods wordlessly and kisses Cas more fervently, speaking their desperation with it, and Cas reciprocates with equal eagerness.
“Dude, I can tell you’re lying.”
Dean has one of his arms slung over the back of his chair, and the other resting in front of him. He looks healthy. More than healthy—there’s a certain glow about him that Castiel’s never really seen in him before, some sort of determination set between his brows. In front of him is a cup of coffee instead of the usual beer bottles.
“I just—I want to help in any way that I can. And if sharing a part of my life saves people, then so be it.”
“Every time, Castiel. I told you. You chose to be here with me. Because it’s easier, isn’t it? In here,” it gestures at the bunker, “with them. With Dean and Sam. But it’s okay,” it says. “We can start over again. You’ll have peace. It’s what you want.”
“I’ve started to realize that humans like to advertise upcoming holidays months in advance,” Cas replies, still in his monotone. He finally opens his eyes, still bleary from the horrors of poorly designed courses. “It’s also very hard to miss all the pink and red things that started to appear right after Christmas.”
There is bright yellow graffiti on the side of Bobby’s house, an attempt to scrub it away evident.
“Oh.” Dean blinks. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“But it isn’t here,” Castiel continues, his voice strong and steady in the tune of his heart. “And it isn’t with you.”
He considers it, but it would be cruel of him to. It doesn’t matter now.
“Oh. What about Victor?”
Anywho. None of that’s Dean’s business, so Dean doesn’t let the thought linger for too long. It’s not like he doesn’t have other things to be doing right now, anyway.
“Take it how you will.” Dean leans back. “And, well, until you figure it all out, you got me.” He grins, and slings an arm around his shoulder. “I got your back.”
She walks towards him and he steps back, unable to look away. “What’s wrong with you?” he asks.
It’s a bit more work, but Dean’s up for the challenge. “Okay, then I’ll make that one.”
“Okay.”
Something lurches in his chest when Castiel takes a bite. He hasn’t had a meal cooked by someone else in a while. Ever since he left home.
Castiel talks to Muriel. Dean is in the room with them, even though he doesn’t need to be. His presence alone gives Castiel enough courage to stay in the room long enough to relay his interest in joining her cause.
“I’m an angel,” Castiel says. There’s tight pressure against the pain on his right arm.
Cas obliges, and he settles against him, nice and warm and cozy as they squish into his tiny ass sofa together. The light of the screen illuminates the cuts of his face, and Cas slowly leans his head against Dean’s shoulder. His hair tickles his neck.
Cas raised an eyebrow with a Look and Dean fidgeted with the wrench in hand, avoiding his piercing all-too-knowing eyes.
“Cas,” Dean says again, and tries the door. It’s unlocked. “Cas, I’m coming in, okay?”
Now Castiel knows Dean is lying, but he lets it drop in favour of letting Dean lead them back to the kitchen. He glances at Dean, but Dean doesn’t seem upset. He doesn't look happy either, but at least he's not upset. He's glad.
“Yeah.” Cas smiles. “You too, I’m sure?”
He takes a deep breath. “Everything I say will only sound like an excuse.”
Cas clears his throat. “Dean?”
Cas gravitates towards him like Dean is the centre of his pull, and Dean squeezes him into his arms until he feels like the dam that burst in his chest has flooded his lungs and he can’t breathe anymore.
