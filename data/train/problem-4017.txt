Just now Dean was looking up at the audience, blushing shyly the way he had done so many times in front of Castiel and Castiel almost couldn’t bear the sight of it. Without realizing it, he leaned forward in his chair, his hands clawing into his knees, his whole body tense and rigid. Shoshanna next to him sensed his anxiety and jumped into a sitting position, alert and ready to act if necessary.
Of course, he wasn’t able to put his mind off Dean completely and he found himself staring into empty space every now and then, forcing Anna or his mother to address him multiple times or even nudge his arm, to get his attention again. They looked at him in concern then, and he tried to joke about it, something about getting old, but he could tell that Anna at least was not convinced. He knew he was in for a serious eye-to-eye conversation and he wasn’t sure he was up for that. He didn’t want to be pitied again. It had been kind of Charlie to take care of him, to comfort him when he was in such dire need of it. But he couldn’t spend his days moping around so much that everybody around him noticed, forced to console him. He and Dean hadn’t been a couple, hadn’t even shared one kiss and their ‘breaking-off’ didn’t warrant everybody mollycoddling him. He had to pull himself together and get on with his life. There would be other guys he would fall in love with. Guys that were unattached.
“There are some kids at school bullying him. He’s a very sensitive child and they mock him for being so shy.”
“Here, bro, for you.”
“I ran someone over and I had to help him get his things back.” He didn’t elaborate and Alex looked at him with scrutiny.
The hands continued stroking through Dean’s hair as if nothing of importance were happening right now. They were just chatting casually.
“I have to leave in half an hour, “the voice continued, “but until then I think we could make good use of our time.”
“I….” he started, very quietly, but he stopped immediately, apparently irritated with the sound of his own voice. Castiel waited and after a while, Dean continued.
...to the monsters already awaiting him. Somewhere behind him, a beautiful angel was crying. Why? He belonged to the monsters and it belonged to heaven. This was what heaven had decided, he had no right to go against the rules.
“I...I can’t bear being without you.”
“I, uh…..”
“I am not worthy of heaven.”
“Alright, “he said with a quick look at his watch. “I should go home now.”
“Barely.”
“I already told you, Lilith says you’re the best, she adores you, you know. And you live in the same street so it wouldn’t be too inconvenient for you to come here, right?”
Most of the other guests arrived shortly after and Castiel was very grateful Charlie and Jo were there to loosen things up. They introduced him to everybody and told little anecdotes to break the ice. Charlie flattered old grumpy Bobby into taking care of the meat, Jo put on some music and seated everyone. While the girls took care of logistics, he only had to welcome everybody and to talk to his guests. Everyone was quite interested in his background, where did he come from, why did he wanna become a vet and so on.
“No. That’s ridiculous of course, “Alastair said, his voice a distant murmur above him. “You wouldn’t betray me like that.”
Dean nodded once again. He was looking close to tears now and Castiel’s heart went out to him, but he still held himself back.
“You should clean up here. I’ll wait in the bedroom for you. Don’t take too long.” Alastair’s eyes pierced into him and Dean nodded dazedly, as if he was under a spell. Alastair got up from his chair, dropped the napkin down onto his plate, and walked up the stairs to their bedroom.
He forced himself to open his eyes and look into his husband’s furious ones. “Y-yes, I understand, “he whispered, but his throat was parched, and he could barely form any words, because of his busted lip.
He put on his headphones and turned on some music, trying to concentrate on it as he looked at the white clouds and the blue sky outside, clear and beautiful as if nature were mocking him for his wretchedness. Once again, he felt a pang of hatred for himself inside his chest. He felt as if the misery was eating him up from the inside, leaving him without respite from the dreadful horror that was lovesickness.
Gabriel looked at him in concern and Castel assured him once more that everything was alright. Eventually, Gabriel squeezed his shoulder in sympathy and nodded so Castiel could leave.
It hurt so much, imagining living without Dean that Castiel had to catch his breath. It almost seemed ridiculous for they had only seen each other a handful of times and nothing had even happened between them, but there had been so much meaning in those meetings. Never in his life had Castiel felt like that, so alive, so deeply connected to another person. He would never meet somebody like that ever again, he knew. He was going to lose the love of his life before it had even begun.
“Oh, “Dean said quickly, his eyes flying open, “y-yes, I slept well.” He had gotten used to sleeping on his back despite his injuries there, the uncomfortable feeling was part of his routine and he didn’t mind it so much anymore.
“Dean. There you are, “Alastair said for the second time that night.
Before he knew it, it was over.
Dean froze where he stood, his shoulders tensing at the sound of Castiel’s frantic plea.  His shoulders sagged in defeat before he eventually turned to face him, the expression on his face sad and tired.
In his desperation, he called Charlie. Luckily, she picked up after the first ring and he immediately started rambling, so fast that she had to stop him. After a while, he managed to calm down enough to explain what happened to her and he made her promise that she would text Dean and ask him if everything was alright and call Castiel when she heard something back.
He swallowed and Dean swallowed too. They continued to stare at each other, the tension building between them like water rising up, forming into breaking waves, a beautiful melody fortifying into a dramatic crescendo, an athlete running a marathon, just seconds away from his first triumphant victory.
Dean opened his mouth to get more air into his lungs but then he was caught completely offhand when Alastair’s hands suddenly moved down to push into his bruised, tormented back.
While he was cutting the vegetables, he was feeling almost elated, humming Simon and Garfunkel to himself as he stood in front of the working surface. When the chicken was sizzling in the pan, his thoughts wandered off again and he cursed himself when he caught himself thinking of Castiel’s wide-eyed stare.
“Yes, I know, “was Alastair’s calm reply. “You haven’t seen him since?”
This was very dissatisfying and Castiel was inclined to just keep texting Charlie until she revealed what was going on via phone but then he realized that was probably childish. She was his friend and probably had a good reason why she needed him to leave. She would explain. Later.
He tried to listen to the performance playing at the moment but found he was unable to, so he eventually gave up, jumped out of his seat and dived for the exit, Shoshanna right behind him.
“What’s with your wrist?” he asked next, swallowing as he tried to appear calm and composed..
He waited for her laugh, but it didn’t come. He looked up and saw her beaming at him.
He stopped himself from writing more. This was long enough, he shouldn’t overdo it. So he pressed “Send” and immediately his heart rate picked up. He stared at the screen once again and he felt tiny beads of sweat trickling down his neck, suddenly he felt quite warm. The big clock in his living room seemed suddenly very to be clicking very loud and the silence around him was deafening. Castiel couldn’t stop himself from nibbling at his nails as he impatiently waited for an answer from Dean.
Frustrated with himself, he pushed hard at the pan in his grip and he hissed in pain when some of the hot oil spilt over and landed on his arm, burning him.
The walk back was nice, and Dean relaxed almost completely as they engaged in a nice chatter about the concert and his pupils. Alastair also seemed relaxed, smiling and stroking Dean’s hand in his. The tension in Dean’s shoulder vanished and he even allowed himself to laugh as Alastair teased him about something.
“…isn’t here right now, we talked about that, didn’t we?” Cain sighed impatiently. “Besides, what kind of husband would let you out in public looking like that? You have no idea what you look like right now, do you?”
She nodded in empathy. “Yes, of course, I understand. As I said, I’ll explain everything. But I think it would be best if we went home for that, don’t you think?”
. For a minute, Dean simply stared at his reflection, his brain already going through suggestions as how to explain the bandana around his neck and the slight bend to his walk should he slip up.
Castiel took his arm away again and sighed. He pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger, eyes closed and took a deep breath to answer his mother but was already interrupted by his forward brother.
To Castiel, it all still felt like a dream and he dreaded the moment when he woke up and Dean was gone.
“Thanks for the food, Cas, and for the walk, I really enjoyed it very much. “Dean said, then he didn’t know how to continue.
He crawled up on the bed again and lifted the sheets next to Dean before he stopped in his movements.
“Next Saturday sound good to you?” She laughed as he nodded again fervently. “Okay. Jo and I can help you prepare. I suggest you write some invitations and throw them into everyone’s mailboxes, that’s the easiest way of letting everyone know.”
A trembling hand to his lip came back bloody. He wiped it on his jumpsuit. It didn’t seem to flow too much anymore which was good.
But he realized at once that it was indeed very real.
His hands started to tremble, and Dean gritted his teeth, utterly frustrated with himself, as he repositioned the knife against his skin, trying to force himself to stay still.
Of course, as always, he was incredibly angry at himself. For falling victim to his own feelings so easily. All that hard work of the past few weeks, for nothing. Here he was pining for this man he couldn’t have - again. And who was he kidding anyway? He had merely succeeded in spending time away from Dean, but he had not managed to get him out of his thoughts.
“Come on, Shoshanna, “he said as he turned around, and jogged back the way they came from, towards town. “I’m sorry, seems like we’re still not going home yet.” Shoshanna gave a short bark as if to give her assent and together they managed to make their way over to the gym in less than ten minutes.
“Everything will be fine soon, “Alastair said, almost soothingly. “I just need to give you your punishment. I have given you the time you needed to heal and now it is time for you to atone for your sin.”
He sat back down across from Dean and handed him the glass of water.
And with a tip to his invisible hat and another suddenly brazen smirk Alastair turned and walked back to his car. Castiel stared after him, even as the car started and drove away.
The week with his Gabriel and their mother was coming to an end. Today was Saturday, tomorrow after breakfast the two of them would leave for the airport. They had intentionally picked an early flight, so he could have the rest of the day to himself, to give him some peace and quiet before work started on Monday.
“Heya, what’s up?” She asked as she leaned against the frame of the door and she smiled at him expectantly.
, he thought so he made his way to the fruit and vegetables section. He was a little stressed out that he was losing precious minutes of his very first lunch break on his very first day that he turned around the corner a little faster than he should – which caused him to crash into someone coming from the other side rather violently. Castiel gasped as he felt his shoulder connect with something soft and he felt a slight sense of pain – simultaneously he was aware of the other person gasping in surprise as well and collapse to the floor.
A cheeky giggle came from the other side. “Ma’am? God, you are an old-fashioned one, huh? No, we do not know each other but I would very much like to meet you.”
He watched desperately as Dean waited for him to break his promise and come nearer. As he realized that Castiel was indeed staying where he was, he closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath. It broke Castiel’s heart to see him in this state, so helpless, so fearful.
The dark, tormenting thoughts wouldn’t stop coming and Dean wanted to drown them out, close his ears shut because it was getting too painful.
Castiel sighed and resolved to stare at the ceiling until sleep would claim him. Shoshanna lay at his feet, already asleep, breathing steadily. Castiel realized his thoughts were totally focussed on his green-eyed neighbour Dean. He just couldn’t stop thinking about him.
His train of thoughts took another turn as he thought of Alastair and the way he had looked at him while holding Dean in his arms. Cold, ice-blue eyes that seemed to pierce right through him, even from that distance. Calculating eyes. Alastair had seemed to assess the situation between them – and had come to the conclusion that nothing important had happened – he wouldn’t have nodded at him if he thought otherwise, would he? He wouldn’t have remained there in his spot if he had realized, would he?
“Oh, I adore them, “Dean answered with a smile. “I’ve always wanted one but you need a lot of space and time for a dog and I never had a lot of that so I couldn’t get one.”
He spent the day lounging around in his bed, feeling bad for being so lazy. He wasn’t used to not doing anything all day. Even when he had some time off work he would spend it doing household chores, mending broken things in the house, or working on Baby in the garage. When he was a little kid his father had drilled him strictly, saying that he should feel ashamed for wanting free time for himself, that he should spend every minute of his time doing something useful even when he wasn’t working. Alastair had the same work ethic and Dean had no problem following the rules. He was used to hard work and he didn’t mind it. He felt useful when he worked.
Then he noticed the dinner plates were already full of food – salmon (as if Alastair had read his mind) in a lemon butter sauce with brown rice and grilled asparagus - their glasses filled with white wine.
Oh God, what was he thinking? Alastair could wake up any second and he was here with the phone in his hand with the proof that he had met another man behind his back….
Castiel looked at Dean who quietly said Thank you” too and he wished he could hear Dean talk more and Alastair less. What kind of relationship did these two have anyway?
Castiel’s face lit up. “That’s a great idea, Charlie. I think I’m gonna do that. It’s a great way of getting to know everybody and it won’t look suspicious to anyone. Maybe I can talk to Dean alone then?” The thought alone made him feel giddy and Charlie laughed when she saw his excitement growing by the seconds.
“Charlie. Seriously, what are you on about?”
“Can you, though, Castiel?” his mother asked. “You’ll have your hands full with your new practice. This garden is huge and there’s the backyard, too. Maybe Gabriel is right, and you should hire someone.”
Slap!
Dean exhaled his breath loudly, his body lost all its stiffness. “I-I’m sorry, Castiel, “he said quietly without turning. Castiel hesitated, then he reached forward and softly put his hands on Dean’s arms, used some force to turn him around. Dean didn’t resist but still looked down to the ground.
“I would like to see him try, “Castiel said with grim determination, and his hands curled into fists as he pictured himself giving Alastair a taste of his own medicine. He almost wished it would happen.
“It’s good to be back, “Alastair murmured as he chastely kissed the top of his head. “I missed you baby.”
“Dean, “he said breathlessly, his voice dropping to a gravelly low pitch.
Castiel followed him down, sat himself opposite Dean. He didn’t say anything at first, he just reached out and placed his hand on Dean’s right knee. It was a risky move, but he sensed that Dean would be okay with being touched now. Castiel wanted to comfort him so desperately and touching the man in front of him so slightly nearly hurt in a physical way. But it was the only comfort he could give him now, Dean wouldn’t be up for more.
“I’m sorry, “he murmured, his eyes dropping to the floor. “I’m pestering you with all these questions but I can see it’s a little too much right now.”
“Please. Could we just leave it at that?”
He couldn’t be sure, of course. The way Dean had described his husband, Alastair was a cold, mean bastard. Who knew how he would react if he thought there was something between the two of them?
“I-I’m sorry, “he said after a small pause, “yes, I do teach the guitar, but I only teach children. I work for the local music school here in Medford and this is a school for kids. Besides, I’ve never taught anyone older than eighteen at the most, usually my pupils are between six and sixteen years old. I’m sorry.”
Alastair pressed in and Dean’s muscles clenched around him. Without waiting long, Alastair bottomed out with a long, deep growl. He hovered over Dean’s neck and leaned down to growl into his ear as he slowly pushed out and then slammed back in with sudden force that rode over Dean like a train.
“Oh, Dean. Don’t look so upset, I’m only telling you the truth.” Now Alastair sounded mocking, as if he thought Dean was being ridiculous. “You cannot do that to the poor boy. Do you know what would have helped him?”
“No, I can’t do that. He’ll come looking for me and if he finds you here, he’ll lose it.. He … he could kill you, Castiel.”
“Dean….I don’t mean to pressure you. But ….Have you thought about the next step? You don’t want to go to the hospital and that’s fine, but … “ He didn’t know how to end his sentence all of a sudden, and a cold sweat broke out in the back of his neck. He didn’t want to ask straightforwardly if Dean wanted to stay with him, in case that was too much on the nose, but his stomach churned at the thought of Dean going anywhere else, or even worse, back to Alastair, and he desperately tried not to let it show.
“I promise.”
On instinct, Dean tried to sit up again, tried to rid himself of the hand around his throat but Alastair tutted disapprovingly and forced his head back into his lap with one swift, rough motion.
But somehow, he had avoided doing that for some time. He had thought about it several times and had shied away from actually creating a profile twice now. He didn’t really know what was holding him back: he was in his prime, available, settled down. He would love to get to know somebody, date, fall in love … And he was a good catch, he thought. He had a good job, a house, a dog. He was not too young, not too old, physically in good shape and in addition considerably attractive – at least that’s what he had been told by ex-partners and friends.
There were at least two hundred people in the audience and he quickly realised that his chances of finding them were pretty low. Also, it was dark, and he was having trouble seeing so on instinct he just sat down on a free chair on the edge of a row in the back, gently pushing Shoshanna down to lay by his chair. The woman next to him spared him a curious glance, and then looked back at the stage where the boys were performing the chorus for one last time.
Castiel had to find out, but he couldn’t put any pressure on Dean now. He was in an incredibly vulnerable state and he had to assure him that he would be okay now.
Thinking of that made it seem quite possible that maybe Castiel had wanted him - his body - since he had seen him all those months ago and decided he wanted to try him out? Dean knew he wasn’t worthy but Alastair seemed to enjoy taking him very much on a regular basis. Maybe there was some sort of physical appeal to him that had also attracted Castiel?
“Why, Dean?” At the sound of Castiel’s voice Dean looked up and again Castiel was stunned at the brokenness inside the other man’s eyes. But at the same time, he was so incredibly beautiful, looking like that – glistening sea green eyes, slightly open, trembling mouth - it was breath-taking and for a moment, Castiel forgot to speak.
“Are you tired, darling?” Alastair asked after a few minutes.
On his way home, his mood still wasn’t good, and he decided to mow his lawn when he got home. He needed to do something, he would go stir-crazy doing nothing because he just knew that he would only be thinking of Dean and that would just not do today. He couldn’t bear the helpless thoughts again, so he would just have to occupy himself right now.
He thought about Charlie for a second but then quickly dismissed that thought as well. She meant well and she was a good person, but they had only known each other for a few weeks. She would soon realize he wasn’t really worth the trouble.
“You’re unbelievable, Dean, you know that?” he breathed against his ear as he teasingly nipped at his neck. “I still can’t believe my luck that I found you. So many people would love to get their hands on you ….” His hands wandered down and then they bruisingly kneaded into the flesh of Dean’s hips. “But you’re mine and mine only. Mine to have and to hold, right Dean?”
Castiel’s heart jolted in his chest. Dean’s pupils dilated and his mouth went dry.
Just as quick, they both pulled back their hands as if they had been burned.
“You were staring at Dean. I saw it. I saw you staring at him like a piece of meat. Could it be that you’re interested in my husband, Castiel?”
“I’m going to fuck you, Dean, “Alastair whispered into his ear. “Right here, right now, against the counter.”
“Cas, no.”
Dean looked at his feet now, avoiding Castiel’s glance. He was pushing some leaves around with his right foot and Castiel could tell he was considerably aggravated now but he couldn’t stop himself from talking. He needed to get it out.
“I said did I make myself clear?!”
He stood up, indicating that he was ready to leave.
The hours flew by and suddenly it was 12 o’clock – lunch break. Alex asked him to sit down and eat with her. That’s when he realized he had forgotten to pack himself something for lunch. He was quite embarrassed, and Alex laughed when she saw the frown on his face.
“Open up for me, darling.”
, Castiel. Dean, walking away from him, leaving him utterly alone.
They exchanged more wet, sloppy kisses while Alastair started to rut against Dean, simulating intercourse, and their breathing changed into something more heated and irregular, causing them to lose their rhythm, their mouths clashing against each other clumsily.
His mouth tightened in sudden anger. No, it would not be as easy as that. He was sure the memory of Dean would be hunting him day and night for a long time and he would just have to deal with it because there was no other way. There was the small possibility of another solution that maybe Charlie would be able to figure out. But he decided he would not put all his hopes into that small possibility. For now, he should really concentrate on his work and on his friends. Maybe he could fly over to Phoenix and go visit his family for a weekend. His mother would be overjoyed to see him, and he could seize the opportunity to see Gabriel, Anna and the others again. That would take him out of Medford, away from Dean, away from the faint hope of meeting the man he was not allowed to ever see again.
It was an angel.
“Oh, how extraordinarily nice of you! Isn’t that nice, Dean?” And he looked expectantly down at Dean next to him who was quick to nod his assent with only a small look in Castiel’s direction.
His words were like the signature to a treaty with the devil. As if he had signed his own life sentence.
allowed
Silence. There was only silence except for the quiet howl of the wind brushing through the trees. It was getting late now, dusk was approaching quickly.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “And? Cops can be psycho, too, can’t they?”
“See? No problem there, right?” Cain laughed, as if he had made some sort of joke, and he leaned back a little, allowing Dean some space to breathe. “We’re just talking right? No harm done.”
“Dean. Please, come back, “he whispered, his face nearly touching the leaves on the ground, as he finally calmed down.
At Alastair’s request, Dean lay down on the sofa on his side with his head in Alastair’s lap. The thought of Castiel seemed like a distant dream as Alastair began to slowly stroke through Dean’s hair, to massage his scalp as their eyes were locked onto the screen in front of them and Dean almost purred at the sensation, as he let his body relax under his husband’s strong, lean fingers.
Shoshanna barked once, she was happy to comply and followed him out of the practice into the sunshine.
Then the song ended, and the boys were followed by two teenage girls, playing a rocky version of “Hallelujah” with two e-guitars. Castiel listened absently but his eyes wandered over the heads of the people in the audience. And indeed, after a few seconds he was able to make out the unmistakable shock of Charlie’s red hair. She and Jo were sitting in one of the middle rows at the left side of the stage and Castiel could see their faces as they listened to the girls playing. Charlie seemed truly enthusiastic, nodding her head to the melody, a big smile on her lips, which of course made sense. Jo on the other hand seemed a little bored because she was staring at the phone in her lap. That was convenient. Castiel quickly got his phone back out and texted her.
“Adam … he asked if I wanted to go to a concert with him. It was a small, unknown band he had only recently learned of himself, but they were playing at a place nearby and he had tickets. I-I so badly wanted to spend an evening with him, Castiel. We only saw each other at lectures, or in the cafeteria but never away from university. This was something I wanted to do so badly. To go out with a friend, spend a nice evening together, have fun.” Dean’s voice began to tremble and Castiel had to restrain himself from reaching out to Dean. He sensed that Dean needed to do this on his own.
A twinkle appeared in Dean’s eye and Castiel knew his message had been received.
“Uhm, here, let me help you with that, “Castiel said as he knelt down to collect the items that had dropped out of Dean’s basket. Dean followed him down instantly and said:
“I’ll bring some takeaway home with me, “he said as he stood at the door on his way out, fixing Dean with a soft look. “I don’t want you to cook today. Okay, darling?”
“No, don’t cry, Dean, “he said quietly, brushing his cheek against Dean’s. “Please. It hurts me to see you cry.”
“Dean, wait, “Amanda, the school’s secretary called once again, a little breathlessly as she hurried after him, waving a yellow note in her hand.
Alastair’s thumb stroked over the back of his hand, rubbing over the skin tenderly as he looked at Dean with a slight frown. “But they have you as a teacher. They have been prepared as best as they could under your care, so they must have known that they would be at their best tonight. Right?”
“Of course, “the driver said, eyeing him curiously, “hop in.”
"Uhm …. Castiel Novak? W-why do you ask?”
Furthermore, he had decided that sports would be the best way to spend his free time. It was better than moping around on his sofa, with the plans of reading or watching TV where he would inevitably end up thinking about Dean instead of paying attention to his book or the TV. So he found himself some routes for him and Shoshanna to go running after work and on weekends. He joined a local Basketball team which met every Tuesday evening - which was more fun than he had expected – and he let himself be talked into regular sessions of squash by Garth. That last one was hell of exhausting and he really had to push himself to be able to keep up with his surprisingly fit colleague. But it kept his brain from thinking, so he decided it was worth his time.
The cold, nasal voice made Castiel freeze in his spot. Slowly, he turned his head to the side and upwards so that he could look into the officer’s face.
His husband was standing at the other side of the room, a tall dark silhouette, hidden in the shadows. He couldn’t see his face.
“Oh Dean, “he whispered, and because his throat was parched, his voice was barely audible. “I am so sorry. Please excuse me. It’s just …. It’s a little hard for me to see this. I … I just wish this had never happened to you. Do you understand?”
He had been completely surprised by Alastair’s proposal. They had just known each other for a year, been together for six months. He had only been twenty-three years old, although Alastair had been thirty-five already.
He hummed to himself contentedly as he resolved to do so. He would make new friends here in no time, no problem.
“Dean, I can’t believe it! What are you doing here?”
Castiel had somehow managed to get by the rest of the summer. After his disastrous trip to Phoenix, he had decided he really needed to put more effort into busying himself. So he had attended a few neighbourly barbecues, spent a lot of time on movie marathons with Charlie and Jo, had thrown himself into his work with outright devotion.
“C-could be, “he stammered and already, his voice was reduced to a soft wheeze, as he struggled to receive enough oxygen to speak.
The answer was immediate:
(See the end of the chapter for
There was blood. Blood and dirt and pus and grime.
The agony ripping through Dean’s weary body was bone-shatteringly excruciating, and he closed his eyes as he curled into himself, breathing heavily, as he tried to manage the pain, tried to accept his fate. His dreams were suddenly so far far away. But it couldn’t be helped.
“I just have a feeling, that’s all, “she said as she shrugged her shoulders. “Sometimes you seem … I don’t know. Sad. Lonely?”
Dean shuddered and he fervently responded to the kiss, deepening it, then he pulled back and said, without opening his eyes: “I love you, too.”
Gradually, Dean relaxed again, and let his body go slack against the mattress.
He thought so much about it that he thought he would go crazy. It got to the point where he was doubting himself that it had happened at all. Maybe he had imagined everything and Castiel and he had never kissed? Never lain side by side, sleeping together as if they were lovers?
They didn’t talk at first and Castiel realized that this was probably getting a little awkward, and he should say something to make thing easier between them, but he couldn’t. He was feeling worked up and confused. He was angry, although he couldn’t really pinpoint at whom the anger was directed at mostly. He was certainly angry at Charlie, for not telling him about her plans involving Dean. He was also incredibly outraged at the sheer presence of that monster Alastair who had had his hands all over Dean as if he wanted to shove it in Castiel’s face that Dean was his and would always stay that way. Castiel was powerless, he couldn’t do anything about the fact that Dean was married to Alastair and he couldn’t do anything about the abuse either. This powerlessness he had just felt made him so angry he felt he could rip out a tree from the ground if he just put his mind to it.
He was anxious to get some answers, so he typed a quick message into his phone. Charlie would be waiting for it anyhow.
“Yes, great idea.”
After another silence, Castiel asked another question that came into his mind, unable to stop himself: “Why were you out there, Dean? In the middle of the night?”
Moving onwards.
Two minutes later, Hannah and Gus, the second veterinary nurse on call, wheeled their patient in. It was a large short-haired mixed-race dog, light brown with speckles of white all over, with big floppy ears. It was lying on its side, panting heavily, its big brown eyes wide open in fear.
For a while – could have been five minutes, could have been two hours for all he knew – he just lay there on the floor. Curled into a foetal position, clutching his hands to his still aching stomach. Trying to breathe. Trying to calm himself. Although he tried to hold them inside because he couldn’t help but feel  disgusted by himself, yet again, the tears fell. Silently, they rolled down his cheeks and fell onto the floor beneath him.
“Great. I’m Tony, by the way.” Tony grinned and easily slipped his hand into Castiel’s, tugging him along to the dance floor as if that all that was needed to be said.
“Oh, shut up, “he said quietly but with a small smile on his lips.
“Okay.”
“Yeah, “Alastair said as he took Dean’s chin in his hand, turning his face so he could look at the bruised cheekbone with the cut from his ring in it. “You better call in sick tomorrow, this looks pretty bad. Your eye is going to swell even worse, it’s going to be a hell of a shiner.”
Dean smiled and nodded. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
“Definitely.” Alastair shovelled the rest of the omelette and sausages into his mouth, drained his cup of coffee in one large gulp and then got up again. Dean stood up, too and Alastair’s hands closed around his waist as he pulled him towards him.
Castiel was dumbfounded. Dean sat there looking a little miserable. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want to…I-I “. He stopped, apparently irritated with himself.
Dean’s heart was hammering against his chest. “What do you mean?”
Dean groaned in frustration and tried to push the memory away. What good was it to dwell in the past? It was nice to have some beautiful pictures of beautiful memories, like the wedding photos or the one taken shortly before his first time with Alastair. But that last one, the one taken with Alastair’s friends at the bar, he could do without. He had protested slightly when Alastair had said that he wanted to hang that one up but Alastair had insisted, saying that it was such a nice picture of him with his friends and since Dean knew that Alastair was sad that he couldn’t see his old friends and colleagues anymore, he guessed it was his right. It was stupid of him to put so much meaning into that evening anyway.
“That one night that you’ve been at my house...it meant everything to me.”
“So, Dean, tell me about yourself. I’m quite curious, I must admit. Where do you come from? What do you do? How did you come to live here?”
“No, I mean it!” she exclaimed, her eyes ablaze with open frustration, and she took one quick step forward. “You are such a remarkable person, Dean. I’ve liked you from the start but know that I’ve known you for a few weeks I just know that you are exceptional.”
He knew that it was risky but he needed this. At this moment he really needed to get out. Get some air, be anywhere else than where he was now. His backside was hurting and he was limping, but he paid it no mind, just got into his car and drove off.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wincing as he moved, Dean laid himself down on his stomach on the bed. His whole body was screaming in pain and he forced himself to relax his muscles. He felt his husband settle behind him which still made him feel a little nervous because he couldn’t see him.
“Huh.” Castiel noticed how Dean’s voice had changed when he told him about Alastair. It seemed it was a topic he wasn’t so keen to talk about, so he decided not to dwell on it.
He realized he was growling when he saw Charlie flinch slightly, Jo stepping up protectively next to them.
“But I can’t, Charlie. Somehow, I can’t do it. He’s haunting me. I lie awake at night and think about his smile, his voice, his laugh … Yes, I know I sound cheesy.” Charlie stayed silent but nodded her head up and down exaggeratedly.
There was no safeword. There was no sexual gratification. Just pain and hopefully, forgiveness afterward. Redemption for the one committing the sin, washing himself clean by surrendering his body and soul.
“Shut up, Meg, “he growled, and she sneered at him, raising her eyebrows playfully, but she left him in peace after that. Garth and Alec had already decided to get out of his hair a considerable time ago and at the end of that day, he walked home, angry and annoyed at himself. He didn’t want to get worked up by that arrogant bastard, it was ridiculous that he would allow him to get under his skin like that. But it had happened anyhow and now he had to find a way to gradually calm himself down and form a plan for what to do next, preferably before his colleagues decided that he was in no fit state to treat his patients.
“It doesn’t matter now. What matters is that you didn’t think of me. You forgot us and that is not acceptable. So you will get punished for it and you know you deserve it. You know that Dean, right?”
But instead of leaving, he couldn’t resist, so he turned once more to look at the couple again. They had put some space between them, although they were still close to each other, Alastair’s hands possessively enclosed around Dean’s wrists. Alastair was smiling at Dean and Castiel saw with pain that Dean was looking back at his husband with something that could be called adoration. However, he also noticed that Dean was shifting a little, as if he tried to put a little space between them, as if he couldn’t help himself. Also, his eyes seemed to dart nervously away from Alastair, unto the ground or to the side, as if he were very aware of Castiel’s gaze upon them.
He griped about the three-course dinner Dean had spent hours preparing, proclaiming it was not worth his time, although he devoured his cherry pie as if he hadn’t eaten in days. He drank glass after glass of red wine and he yelled at Dean when he told him that they were completely out of red wine.
It was probably a good decision because his body ached in so many places. His ribs were killing him and he had trouble breathing because of them. His wrist hurt and he couldn’t put any weight on it. His head was throbbing and it went only a little better after swallowing two pills of Tylenol. The pain only made his restlessness worse. He wanted to get up and grab a knife to cook something for his husband, or at least do some laundry - anything to distract him from the pain his body was suffering. But he couldn’t, so he resigned himself to his fate.
“I seriously doubt that…” Castiel protested but Charlie raised her hand to stop him. “Please, Castiel, I’m trying to give you some life-changing advice, here.” He smiled and gestured for her to continue.
“Perfect. Maybe we could talk a little too, get to know each other. I love to get to know people, you know, interact with the crowd, and so on.”
One of these times had been when his father had yelled at him for making the decision to be a veterinarian instead of a ‘real’ doctor. They had screamed at each other in the winter garden of his luxurious parent’s house for hours until Castiel had eventually stormed off in rage, slamming the door behind him with such a force he had been sure it would fall out of its hinges. He had been furious afterwards for a long time, so furious indeed that he had driven his car into one of his neighbour’s parked car because he didn’t pay attention in his blinding anger. He had also smashed the living room in his brand-new apartment, throwing down all the awards and trophies he had won in his adolescence and of which his father had been proud of. But he couldn’t stand the sight of them, so he smashed them to the floor, ruining quite a lot of them in the process.
“Don’t misunderstand me, Dean! I don’t want to push something onto you that you’re not. I just need to know that you’re alright, that’s all.”
“You wouldn’t be interested in him, baby, would you?” his husband’s sweet, soft voice continued. “He’s attractive, he’s nice. He has a good job, a house ...?”
That’s when Charlie and Jo stepped in. They were the only ones who truly knew about his misery and they went out of their way to try to cheer him up. They came over with ice cream and movies. They asked him to go with them to flea markets and to the zoo and to bake cookies with them. Sometimes, they managed to distract him from his misery, other times not. Often, he was just too distraught or had no strength for their forced cheerfulness and he would cancel their plans, claiming he was too tired. Which was true, technically. On the weekends he just lay around, sprawled on his couch, watching TV, drinking beer, hating himself.
Dean’s breath hitched as his husband’s erection pressed against him and he froze, his hands still in the lukewarm water.
But Dean didn’t do that. He swallowed heavily, picked up his guitar case he had dropped and looked at Castiel with a sad resigned smile. “No, we really should talk. If you want to. But not here. There’s a little wood behind the school, let’s go there. I have some time before Alistair gets home.”
“Okay, I think you’re right, your ribs just seem bruised, not broken. I would put some ice on them, too, but I think you need to get some sleep now. You look about ready to drop.”
He had seen the edge of another large bruise starting at the side of Dean’s left side and disappearing into his back. It looked like Alastair had aimed for Dean’s kidneys and it was yet another gruesome detail that made Castiel grit his teeth and bite his lip in order not to make a sound betraying his anger.
Castiel was shocked. “No, Dean! You cannot mean that!”
“Hm?” Dean’s eyes closed and he sighed in utter content, as Alastair’s fingers reached lower down his scalp rubbing at symmetrical points right above his ears.
What were his options?
The first one had been sent at 00:21 am:
“Huh. Okay, thanks.”
Breathlessly, he watched as Dean shared a short look with the kid now seated at the beautiful grand piano at the side.
His body was aching: His wrist hurt, his ribs hurt. His face was sore. He was slightly nauseous and his head was pounding, but he knew it could be much worse if it hadn’t been for Castiel.
He finished his yoghurt, drained his coffee and cleaned up the dishes. He wiped the table and the counter tops although they weren’t really dirty, then he swept the floor with the broom, although that wasn’t dirty too – but it was such a habit now that it almost happened automatically. He was used to cleaning the house every day. Alastair needed him to make sure that everything was perfectly clean, and Dean was happy to oblige him. After all, it was only fair that he did his share of work – as he only worked part time it was a matter of fact that he would look after the house and do the cooking. If they someday took the big step to adopt a baby – and Alastair had hinted that he was indeed interested in that – he would be the one to look after the child, no question about it.
“You’re fucked, Castiel. Sorry.” She said apologetically. He nodded, defeated. “Yeah, I know.”
That’s when everything stuttered to a halt.
“Well, you know how we met the other day at the lake? Where we had the picnic?”
Being with Castiel had been the best thing in his life. Those few precious hours, lying with him, kissing him, sleeping next to him - nothing would ever mean as much to him, he was sure of it.
“Please Cas, “he said, his voice choked, “please don’t make this difficult. It’s already hard as it is.”
A tiny bark came from his right side, then another whine and Dean immediately started jogging down the path, eyes frantically searching the ground for the hurting animal. The whine became more frequent and louder and soon he could make out a bundle of black and light brown lying on the ground at the side of the road just a few meters away from him. His heart stopped in his chest and he quickly walked over to the dog and knelt down next to it
“Alastair, please, let me explain…”
When he drove back home at six in the morning, he was exhausted but happy and he fell into his bed with a warm feeling in his belly, falling asleep within seconds. When he woke up in the late afternoon he rewarded himself with a huge plate of deep-fried chicken and home-fried potatoes in front of the TV. He watched Netflix for hours and went to bed at one in the morning. He stared at the ceiling again for hours but still, it had been a good weekend.
Nodding at himself in the mirror, he then decided to grab another cup of coffee so he headed downstairs. When he reached the end of the stairs, his eyes accidentally locked on a picture frame. They had a whole wall full of pictures there although both of them weren’t exactly close with their respective families, which was why there were mostly pictures of the two of them.
Gabriel chuckled as he pulled his brother into a tight embrace. “You would think you’re thirteen and not thirty the way she treats you,” he whispered into Castiel’s ear. Castiel just grinned silently. “Good luck, bro. I really hope you’ll find what you’re looking for here.” He gave him a serious look as if he wanted to say something more, then he shook his head and grinned again. “Hey, I wanna hear all the sexy stories about sexy neighbours, ya know?” And he winked at Castiel in his typical manner. Castiel winked back in an exaggerated manner and he patted Gabriel’s shoulder one last time. “We’ll see, Gabe, we’ll see.”
He inched even nearer and now Castiel could see the wrinkles around his cold eyes, the angry snarl of his lips as they almost touched his skin. Despite himself, Castiel tensed and he had to restrain himself, hard. One millimetre more and he would pounce on Alastair, damn it all.
Three seconds passed. Eight seconds. Ten seconds.
Maybe he would do everything to get Dean into his bed. And let him go right after.
“Oh, hey Dean, “he said casually, and he grabbed a towel to dry his hands. “I didn’t know if you’d come. You didn’t answer my invitation.” Dean’s smile turned into fear, so he hastened to add “But that’s okay, don’t worry. It’s only a small informal party. I’m glad you could make it after all.”
With shame he noticed his own body responding to the constant stimulation and he knew he wouldn’t last long if Alastair remained at that angle. Alastair did and he was speeding up too, grunting against Dean’s damp skin.
“You didn’t expect me to be home, did you?” The words out of his husband’s mouth were spoken quietly, calmly even, but Dean recognized the danger lurking underneath the peaceful surface. He knew that tone and his body reacted instantly by ducking, making himself as small as possible. Little good would it do him now.
Castiel smiled a little solemnly. “Well, I hope it doesn’t sound too sappy, but I really hope that I’ll find someone special someday. Someone to spend the rest of my life with, you know?” And he blushed a little as he said that.
He blushed and turned away, but she grabbed his arm. “No, I mean it, Dean! You have such patience and always answer my questions and show me the chords although I’ve asked you to show them to me a thousand times but you’re still being nice to me. Dude, every other teacher would have yelled at me by now and told me to leave the instrument-playing to others, but you have stuck with me. And it’s so much fun to learn from you, you make it seem so easy. You even agreed to do this extra weekend session just because I asked you to in the spur of the moment. You’re incredible!”
He was still avoiding looking directly at Castiel, but eventually, after shifting nervously on his feet and looking behind him, his lips parted, and he met Castiel’s worried gaze.
Instead, he suddenly found himself standing in front of a door to a house. A house where he had been only once, but he immediately recognized it. Apparently, his feet had carried him somewhere specific, deciding his way for him.
“Here.”
“I’m sorry, “he said, “no need to worry. You’re here now, that’s all that counts. I’m sorry Alastair couldn’t come.”
No, that wasn’t very likely. He would try to keep this as low-key as possible. He would try to avoid turning his colleagues’ attention to his private life at all costs. If anyone found out what had happened to Dean, it would raise a lot of questions, even if Dean covered up the truth. Alastair wouldn’t want any nosy neighbors of theirs to know about Dean’s current state too. They could come by with casseroles or flowers and that would be unacceptable.
He flinched when suddenly, a very cold ice cream box was thrown into his lap.
“Baby?”
“Hey …. There’s nothing to be ashamed of, “she said as if she had read his mind.
He quietly changed into his favourite jeans as well as one of his old college hoodies and went down the stairs. He wrote a quick note, explaining that he was only going for a quick walk outside, that he needed some fresh air. It was nothing but the truth. If he was lucky, Alastair wouldn’t even read the note. He would be back in one hour and could just trash the note without his husband ever knowing that he had been gone.
She texted Dean then, in Castiel’s presence, asking him if she could come over to play the guitar with him looking over her shoulder. They were both disappointed when Dean refused but at the same time, it was incredibly relieving to look at his text, see the evidence of his well-being right there on the phone. Even if he was injured and under his husband’s control, he was alive and well enough to write a text.
“You like that, you slut?” the older man hissed into his ear. “You like being fucked like this, being used like this?”
“Oh no Castiel, I’m sorry to hear that.” Her eyes were full of pity and he felt the sudden urge to jump up and leave, he knew now that he couldn’t have this conversation at this moment, again.
The shock hit Dean from completely out of nowhere. He froze. Naked terror washed over him. He forgot how to breathe. Almost choked on his last inhale.
“Are you feeling a little better?” he asked carefully. This wasn’t nearly enough, and he still half-expected Dean to ask him why he hadn’t helped him, since it was all his brain could ask incessantly. Dean, however, seemed anything but angry or disappointed. Instead, he was looking at Castiel with a kind of timid awe, as if he was still unable to fully comprehend that he was here and Castiel was helping him.
“But…” he tried at last, but he didn’t know what to say.
She hugged him one more time, then she stepped aside to give Gabriel his chance to say goodbye.
“Okay, I will. “Dean said, “quite an unusual name, I’ve never heard it before.” He looked at Castiel with earnest interest although the nervousness wouldn’t leave his features, he was still looking behind his shoulder from time to time and his stance was rigid, his right hand curled into a tight fist.
“Yes, darling, I know.” Alastair didn’t seem to realize he was causing Dean pain or if he did it didn’t seem to matter to him, he only tightened his grip around his ass with one hand and on his back with the other.
That’s not what he wanted or needed right now. Or they could be boring, arrogant, vain, dumb, ugly … well, a lot of things actually and he knew that most people who tried online-dating went through quite a lot of unsuccessful, disappointing dates and many of them didn’t even end up with a suitable partner after all the trouble they went through. So it was probably no wonder he thought the whole thing would just end up a waste of his time and effort, going through that kind of circus, right?
Unable to help himself, Castiel kicked at the useless machine and cursed when he bumped his big toe for his trouble.
Steeling himself for whatever was to come, Dean swallowed once more and walked the way over to his husband.
He had just pulled the sheets back over his legs when Alastair entered the room.
He thoroughly enjoyed his dinner, combined with a nice glass of Merlot, and afterward, he almost was in a good mood. When he was finished cleaning up after himself, he started to light up the fireplace. Fifteen minutes later, a nice warm fire was crackling in front of him, and he sat down in his favorite armchair with a cup of hot cocoa in his hands, and warm slippers on his feet, ready to enjoy the warmth and coziness he so desperately needed right now.
Obediently, he turned and lowered himself down onto his knees so that his bare back was towards his husband. He was breathing heavily in trepidation, but he fought hard to keep it under control because hysteria would only incur Alastair’s wrath.
“Sorry, “she said at once, letting go of his arm with wide eyes, “I didn’t mean to startle you. I’m just so glad that you came, I’m really eager to learn to play.”
“Baby? Is everything alright? You seem …. distracted.”
It was soft and smooth and beautiful. With a single touch, it promised him the fruits of the earth if he only asked.
“Good.”
The mattress dipped when Alastair left the bed, the firm footsteps leading into their en-suite bathroom roused Dean immediately.
He shrugged and she bit her lip as her smile turned into a frown. “So, what’s the downside? There has to be one or you wouldn’t look like a sad puppy that didn’t get his treat.”
He shrugged. It didn’t matter. He would take a quick shower before Alastair’s return and he would be as good as new. He wasn’t expecting to see anybody else.
He felt Cain’s stare on his back which he really couldn’t stand anymore so he darted off towards the house and rushed inside, closing the door behind him quickly. He closed his eyes, relieved that he was finally alone and let out a breath of air that he hadn’t realized he had been holding in.
“Yes of course.” He dared to smile at the other man. “And you know what? I’ll even take the dog home with me. I bet Shoshanna will be overjoyed to have him stay with us. He can stay as long as it takes for someone to claim him or get him into a foster home if no one does. I promise I will take good care of him.”
“What? No!”
“It’s alright! You stay here! I’m just tired. I’ll see you tomorrow, alright?”
A nervous laugh escaped Dean involuntarily. “Wh-what? What reliable source?”
One of those evenings he visited Charlie and Jo. They drank a few glasses of wine together, watched a funny movie and overall, he had a pretty good time. Still, it wasn’t as easy to forget Dean as when he was at work. He observed Charlie and Jo together, saw their hands intertwining constantly, saw them exchange short, tender kisses every now and then and it hurt every time. Charlie noticed it and she tried to put a little more distance between her and Jo, but her girlfriend wouldn’t be put off so easily and she scooted back to her every time, to nibble at her earlobe teasingly or to take her hand back into hers. Charlie blushed and Castiel was a little embarrassed.
At first, it was only a light brushing of lips, both their breaths ghosting across each other lips. Both of them nervous and clumsy in their movements, Castiel’s hand dropping from Dean’s arm to his waist as he stepped closer to him.
“Oh yes, Dean, great, that was quick!” The woman’s voice grew excited and Dean was even more confused. She sounded overjoyed to hear from him. She must have him confused with somebody else, there could be no other explanation because he didn’t know her.
Castiel nodded silently.
Castiel had never been so miserable in his whole life.
“Uhm … have you seen my phone?” he asked as he went through his pockets, unable to find it there.
“Tell me, Dean, “Castiel said softly. “Please.”
He shook his head, despair creeping up his throat once again. “But I don’t know how I can do it, Charlie. I almost went mad not seeing him for the last few days, how will I go on never ever seeing him again? I’m not sure I can do it, it just hurts so much.” He buried his face in his hands, utterly ashamed. Charlie put her hand on his knees and stroked it softly.
“No, I don’t think so.”
Grabbing his phone out of the pocket - he hadn’t dared do this in the taxi, preferring to close his eyes and enjoy his solitude while it still lasted - he saw that there was one new message from his husband, sent five minutes ago.
Another kiss, a little more forceful.
“Dean.” Castiel stopped himself but he also raised his hands in a calming gesture, and he tried to make his voice sound soothing. Reassuring.
“Dean! Oh God, Dean! I was so worried.” Dean was not moving in his arms, and he was stiff as a board but Castiel couldn’t care about that at that moment. Dean was alive and he was well and he was here. He could feel him breathing against his throat and he could feel the blood pumping through his veins, from where his hand was wrapped around his neck. His skin felt warm there, but his face was still cold from the icy temperatures from which he had come and Castiel was barely able to restrain himself from nuzzling against that cold-warm neck, to press his lips to his carotid artery, valid proof for his well-being right there for him to feel.
“Don’t say that, “he whispered at last. “Please, it’s wrong.”
Warning: graphic violence, a little bit of self-harm as well as thoughts of suicide in this chapter. Please keep this in mind! Please do not read if this triggers you!
Frowning in surprise, Castiel looked into the rear mirror and saw a police car right behind him, approaching fast.
“Nonsense, Dean,” Castiel said with a firm voice, causing Dean to look up at him again, “I am interested, I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t. Please, tell me.”
“Please follow the movement of my finger.”
“Okay.” Dean paced the room nervously, biting his lip as he avoided looking directly at Castiel.
He smiled to himself as he raised his fingertips to his mouth, remembering the soft sweet touch of Dean’s lips against his, the hungry slide of his tongue against Castiel’s. He already knew that he would spend every second in the hours to come remembering this.
Castiel sighed and he rubbed his fingers over his weary eyes. He wished he could just go to sleep. Theoretically, it should work. God knew he was exhausted enough. And yet, his brain wouldn’t allow him this small favour. Instead it seemed determined to condemn him to insomnia. It seemed as if there was no getting out of the frustrating process of fretting, tossing and turning for the first half of the night until he was finally released into a restless slumber sometime in the middle of the night.
His voice was low and aggressive and there was a fire inside his eyes that hadn’t been there before. He was dropping his mask right here in front of Castiel, apparently not bothering to hide his true self anymore. He was letting it all out.
Cold, naked fear got a hold of Dean and squeezed him in a choking, merciless embrace. He froze, backed up helplessly against the door as he waited for Alastair to make his move.
Dean’s mouth tightened and he looked to the side, a rush of air leaving his lips before he answered him. “I went out for a walk, “he said flatly.
Dean was gone and he would not come back, Castiel was sure.
But the question remained: why had he been out there in the woods at this time of the night?
Well. She sounded …. nice. Funny. Different. Although he had been completely flustered by her directness, he had also been impressed by it and he was intrigued. Maybe it would be nice to get to know her.  He didn’t really have any friends around here yet. Not that he didn’t get along with people, but he didn’t get the chance to make the acquaintance of many adults because of his job. Besides, Alastair was very jealous, even of people who only seemed interested in Dean’s friendship and in the past many possible friendly relations had been spurred because Alastair hadn’t approved for some minor reason or another. It was always a risk for him to form a friendship of course, even if it was only platonic.
He got up and threw the tissue away. Thinking on his feet, he grabbed a glass from the cupboard and filled it with water from the tap. Before he returned to Dean, he filled the kettle with water and turned the heater on. Some tea would be good for Dean: it would warm him up, and hopefully, make him feel better.
Dean looked at him with doubt in his mind, but he seemed to relax a little under Castiel’s reassuring touch. Then he noticed Shoshanna jumping up at him with a waggling tail and his eyes lit up.
Castiel felt heat rising up in his cheeks as he forced himself to continue. “Dean…. I-I think I’m falling in love with you.”
He fumed for a few seconds. This couldn’t be happening. He needed to something right now, striking machines or no.
“Sir, step out of the car, please.”
But Dean didn’t calm down, his breath was increasing and his whole body was trembling now.
After a while, he rinsed the cloth in the bowl of water and tried not to stare at the blood spreading out in the warm liquid, thin threads of crimson tentacles drawing spidery patterns.
Encouraged, he took another deep breath. “Dean, I ….I need you to see that…..”
, he thought.
His jaw set in a hard line as he cursed himself for thinking so much. He was getting sentimental, he was starting to doubt himself and that couldn’t do. Everything that had happened yesterday would come back and he couldn’t go back. He was proud that he had managed to end it, after fooling himself and poor Castiel for such a long time. He had been leading him on and wasn’t Alastair right after all, that he was a cock-tease?
The pressure increased and now air would only pass his trachea with difficulty.
Castiel sat down on the couch as if someone had punched him. He felt like a sudden weight on his chest was holding him down and he swallowed heavily in deep disappointment.
Castiel caught himself quite often brooding over the question why he didn’t see Dean that much, and it was starting to bother him. He wanted to do something so he would see him again, but he didn’t know what he could do. Alastair had made it clear he wasn’t very interested in a friendship with him so he couldn’t just show up at their doorstep again, could he? He didn’t have Dean’s number, so he couldn’t contact him directly either.
“Good, “Alastair replied, grinning as he teasingly bit at his nipple once more, “then you’re well rested and open to some … physical activities, right?”
“No, that...that would not be enough.” Dean blushed again and he stared at his hands. “I...need you here...by my side.”
Castiel nodded, surprised at Dean’s sudden change in demeanour, but also happy that they would apparently finally have a frank talk. “Sounds good, “he said with an honest smile and he took a step back to leave enough space for Dean to walk through the door and lead the way to the little wood outside.
Alastair smiled at him again and then surprisingly, he reached out a hand mid-stride, offering it to Dean in invitation. Hesitating only for a second, Dean took it. As soon as his husband’s hand closed around his, Dean felt a little less anxious, because surely, this was a good sign. Alastair gave him another quick happy smile as he squeezed his hand in tender acknowledgment and then they continued their way home, hand in hand.
These weren’t pupils of Medford High school. Well, maybe they were but mostly, these were pupils of the local Music school and of course, Dean was here. His pupils were performing here and apparently, so was he.
“Yeah, you’re right of course, “Charlie admits, “but him simply being one makes the whole situation kinda worse for you.”
Their relationship had been strained already by Castiel’s first semester at Phoenix University but when he told his parents that he was gay, halfway through his studies, his father nearly had a heart attack. It was enough for them to not speak each other and not see each other for the last couple of years except for Christmas and birthdays. It had hurt Castiel very much to be so rejected by his father, to realize he was a hypocrite and too shallow, too intolerant to accept anything divergent from his values. It had been a shock seeing his father in this new light and it had angered him. His mother and siblings, mostly Gabriel and Anna, his younger sister, had tried to mediate between the two of them, to no avail. He had thrown himself into his studies and decided that his father could go fuck himself. He had graduated two years ago, then he had worked at a veterinary clinic nearby as a resident. It had been amazing, finally working as a vet – but he somehow felt suppressed by his father’s presence nearby, as if his aura and all his hateful words came haunting him.
His hand lingered in the air for a moment. Dean recovered quickly, and he blinked at Castiel, allowing him to continue.
They danced like that for a whole song and when the next song started Tony got braver and pushed his body against Castiel, staring at his mouth hungrily while he threw his arms around his neck, chasing the intimacy with an eagerness that was refreshing but also somewhat disconcerting. Their faces were very close all of a sudden and Castiel could feel the other man’s hot breath against his skin, could see the tiny beads of sweat on his forehead, just at the edge of his hairline.
She slapped his shoulder slightly. “Stop it. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone needs a good cry once in a while and you were much in need of this.” She looked at him more earnestly, her soft green eyes piercing into his blue ones with calm intensity.
“Please believe me when I tell you that without you, I have no home here.”
“Baby. You seem tense. Relax.”
“But I think one of them is a police officer, “Jo chimed in. “I’ve seen him in his uniform, he came into the Roadhouse that one time, breaking up a fight.”
Castiel wasn’t in any danger.
It was Charlie and Jo, each carrying a bowl of food in their hands. They had promised to be early so they could help him getting everybody drinks and starting early conversations so it wouldn’t be too stiff.
Castiel looked over his shoulder to also look at the door. “What is it, Dean? There is nobody else here, only me. Please, calm down, what’s upsetting you so much?”
He grinned despite himself and settled down next to her. She offered him the open ice cream box and a spoon, and he hesitantly scooped up a small piece of ice cream onto his spoon. She eagerly motioned for him to try it, so he did.
“No, I don’t…” Dean shook his head, frowning. “I-I’m fine, I don’t need….”
The food was on the table a good ten minutes later. Alastair smiled at him with bright glittering eyes when he sat down, and they ate. They exchanged short dialogue about the business of their days and Dean’s posture had changed from half-tense to almost completely relaxed at the end of the dinner. With his mind at ease and his stomach full, he cleaned away the dishes.
Dean closed his eyes and winced at the thought of his own idiocy.
Undeniably real and his whole body froze in terror as it hit him like a train. Everything that had happened, everything that he had done.
“Dean, “Castiel muttered between soft little kisses against those heavenly lips. “Dean. Please, Dean.”
“That’s perfect, Dean, just breathe with me, you’re doing great.”
Her eyes twinkled dangerously. “Maybe. Come on, tell me. Is it about Dean?”
Castiel’s hands were clenched into fists but he tried to make his voice sound calm. “Promise me that you’ll take care of yourself. Promise me to stay out of trouble.”
“Apparently, someone found a hurt dog at the highway by the woods just outside town. A hit and run.”
“Would that be okay for me? Well, yeah, I guess…”
He looked up in surprise. Charlie looked at him sullenly, her arms crossed.
What a disaster this all had been. This whole weekend actually.
Once again, his hand sank down to disappear into Dean’s hair where it resumed stroking it tenderly. There was no cruelty in the motions now, only tenderness and softness. There was nothing threatening to end his life right here, right now. Not anymore.
Castiel wanted to scream at him and only barely stopped himself from doing so.
Dean smiled in relief. “That’s so nice of you, thanks. I hope it’s okay I show up now, I just realized it’s already a bit late. I brought some wine, too, I hope you like white wine. Although I wasn’t sure if bringing wine to a barbecue correlated with common etiquette…” He sighed and stopped himself as he saw Castiel looking at him with slightly raised eyebrows but a huge grin on his face.
He grabbed his jacket and opened the door. His limbs screamed with exhaustion, but he ignored them. He put on his jacket and stepped outside. The streets were deserted, there was no sight of his husband.
“No, no, “Castiel answered quickly, “I can wait. Could you just show me where he teaches and I’ll wait in front of the door until he’s finished.” He flashed another dazzling smile at her, and she nodded with a nervous giggle and got out of her seat to show him the way. After just two turns and two corridors they had reached the right place.
But Dean didn’t seem to hear him. “Always making a mess, that’s just me. I’m sorry, please, can you tell me where to find a paper towel?” His voice was almost hysteric now and Castiel decided to just move.
And she opened her eyes and smiled at Cas. “You’re our new neighbour, you said? Hey, I’m Jo and I adore your cookies. Can I get a subscription?” She blinked her eyes at him dramatically and he laughed, thankful that his first set of neighbours were so easy to deal with.
He made his way home with Shoshanna who was in a good mood, too. Compared to this morning, he was even happier, and he really had to pull himself together not to break into song right there and then.
Moving slightly away from Alastair who was snoring deeply, he leaned over and grabbed his phone from the nightstand. He then settled back into the position from before so as not to wake Alastair up and searched his phone for Castiel’s texts. Involuntarily, he scrolled through the old messages they had sent to one another. There wasn’t really much.
“Take all the time you need, “Castiel said quietly. He noticed the hair on his arms were standing up and he wondered briefly why that was, because it wasn’t cold.
Alastair was just pressing a kiss to his husband’s forehead when he suddenly turned his head, paused and looked directly at Castiel.
He thought of writing to Dean and quickly dismissed that idea. It was too dangerous.
“Oh, that.” Dean bit his lower lip as he considered his answer and another wave of desire rushed through Castiel’s limbs which he though totally inappropriate considering the situation they were currently in. Curse his body.
If it just went on like before, Dean would die eventually. Sooner or later, Alastair would hit a little too hard, and then this amazing, beautiful man he was in love with would be a cold, dead corpse, his life tragically cut short. Just because Castiel had not been able to do anything.
Friday afternoon came and was on the way home, Shoshanna by his side as always. After work he had visited the store again in the hopes of seeing a certain someone but again, he had been disappointed. Hence, he was in a subdued mood as he walked down the street. The sky was blue, the sun was shining, and he felt as if they wanted to mock him for feeling blue.
The corners of Dean’s eyes brimmed with tears and Castiel responded on instinct, reaching out to gently cup Dean’s face. To his utter surprise and delight, Dean pressed into the touch, as if he was starved for physical affection. He closed his eyes, as a single tear rolled down his cheek and Castiel’s breath hitched when he saw that Dean was trembling all over.
“But how should I do that, Charlie? He said. “I hoped to meet him on the street or in the store by chance, but it only happened once.”
“Great job, Charlie. You’re really getting the hang of it.”
Dean laughed and Castiel’s heart fluttered as his attention was once again drawn to those wonderful lips as well as to the pleasant sound of Dean’s laugh.
Then he turned his gaze straight at Dean again, so intensely that Dean resisted the urge to take a step back.
Suddenly, his phone on the coffee table beeped, indicating he had a message. At once, he scrambled up to grab it, for a moment thinking it could be Dean, telling him he had made a mistake, he hadn’t meant what he had said about never seeing each other again. But it wasn’t Dean, of course. It was Charlie.
After the wound had been shaven, cleaned, and disinfected, Castiel stitched the wound up and applied a dressing. As planned, the dog was already half-asleep and didn’t move much. Its heartbeat and breathing were steady and Castiel smiled at the sight of his peaceful patient, sure that it was going to be okay.
But he couldn’t fool himself for long and after a couple of hours he excused himself and went home.
Dean nodded his head quickly.
“Indeed, I did, “Castiel said proudly, “I know it’s a bit much, but I didn’t know what you like to eat, and I didn’t want you to stay hungry on our first” - he bit his tongue - “walk.”
“Dean?”
“Hey buddy, “Dean said softly, “what happened to you? God, you’re bleeding.”
“No thanks.” Dean shook his head wearily. “I’m not hungry...just tired.”
He was actually a little nervous to meet his new neighbours. It really took him by surprise because he wasn’t such a shy guy normally, he used to go to parties at college where he almost knew no one and ended up with a new group of buddies more times than he could count. He was an easy-going person, people liked him because he was fun to hang around with, he was cheerful and knew how to make everyone around him laugh. He often ended up being the centre of everyone’s attention, making everyone cry tears of laughter by impersonating Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura or The Mask. But he was a good listener too and friends liked to come to him with their problems, with their heartaches and they always left him feeling comforted and hopeful.
Dean nodded and pressed the compress to his cheek. The ice seemed bearable, and he closed his eyes when the packaged frost immediately brought relief to his battered skin.
“Alright, “he said with a grin, “challenge accepted.”
“It’s late. I need to go, “Dean murmured, his tone flat. “He should be still asleep after drinking so much, but still….”
Alastair didn’t bother opening Dean up with more of his fingers and he groaned as he pushed into him from behind, pressing him against the counter. Dean suppressed a cry of pain as he was entered almost completely dry. He could never get used to this feeling as if he was being torn open from the inside but he knew how to handle it, knowing that he was expected to keep his mouth shut so that was what he did.
“Sounds like a plan, hotshot. Let’s do it. I think a barbecue would be appropriate in this weather.” He nodded along to her words in joyous excitement.
“Dean, “he said with a small sigh he didn’t manage to suppress. “You’re hurt. Can I please take you to the hospital?”
He had to call work the next day to extend his sick leave, claiming his wrist had gotten worse. They weren’t happy but they couldn’t do anything. He texted Charlie to inform her as well and she tried to call him almost immediately but he refused to answer his phone. He was simply unable to deal with her at the moment.
“I mean, they are married, Castiel.” Her voiced turned into something softer. “Do you really wanna push yourself between them?”
“Yes, but only a little.”
“You are head over heels with Dean. You’re in love with him. What does it matter that you haven’t spent a lot of time with him? That doesn’t diminish your feelings for him. These feelings are real, and those feelings are yours, don’t deny them. It’s completely natural to feel heartbroken with what’s happened to you.” She smiled and cupped his face with her hand. “You’re a human being, Castiel. You’re entitled to your emotions.”
“Please don’t say that, “Dean said quietly, feeling strangely embarrassed. He was unable to look at her now and he felt uncomfortable in his own skin.
Nevertheless, he stiffened when he heard steps approaching and then he sensed a puff of air on his neck from where Alastair was breathing against it. Fear blossomed in his chest and he bit the inside of his cheek to avoid making any sounds that would betray him. He should be used to this, they had been doing this so many times now, but he wasn’t somehow. He could never get used to the fear and the feeling of helplessness and the forced submission that was expected of him unless he wanted to risk being punished in a much worse way.
Dean swallowed nervously. “N-no. I…. I was just wondering …”
He turned to Dean again with a raised eyebrow but a smile tugging at his mouth’s right corner. “Cas?”
So Dean obeyed. He began to ride Alastair, starting slowly but quickly increasing his pace. He knew that they didn’t have much time and Alastair hated it when Dean forgot the time. So he gave it his best, bouncing up and down on his husband like there was no tomorrow and made sure to make all the pretty little noises that his husband liked so much. It wasn’t too hard, too, because this kind of sex was good for Dean, too. It was love-making, pure and simple, and Dean was thankful that he could make his husband happy like this, that he was given the chance to show his appreciation of his husband’s love. It felt incredibly good, too and soon he was covered in sweat, practically writhing with physical ecstasy. There was also the pain in his back, but it was something he barely noticed, his mind deciding to focus on the more pleasant things.
“I...Castiel, “Dean whispered hoarsely, “We can’t do this… I….”
Dean nodded at once, tears in his eyes and Alastair pulled him into a strong embrace, avoiding the wounds on his back. “Oh, my poor Dean, I’m sorry. Come here now, come to me.” Dean relaxed into Alastair’s arms and let the tears flow freely.
“Alright, cowboy, “Charlie said, her voice almost sounding cheerful like always, “wait up for us then, would you?”
“Ah.” Alastair seemed to think about that for a minute. As chief of police, he knew many families in town, although they hadn’t been in Medford very long. But occasionally, he asked Dean about the children he taught, and Dean had told him about Ben’s brilliant skills with the guitar. “What kind of trouble?” he asked then.
He kissed Dean on the mouth, wet and salty from his tears. “Shhh, darling. hush now. All will be fine, I promise.”
I feel bad, returning so late and with such a sad chapter, too :(
Before, he had been blissfully unaware of the sweet agony of knowing how these things felt but not being able to experience them again. Before, he had been in love, unhappily, but ignorant. Now, he was more lovesick than ever - but his heart was filled with the knowledge of what being close to Dean actually felt like: euphoria, washing over him, leaving him breathless, almost overwhelmed. A bubble of joy bursting within him, over and over, filling him with immeasurable happiness until he himself was close to bursting. The memories were intoxicating, almost cruelly so: a touch so soft it pulled you into its spell. Plump lips brushing against his, a heavenly drug that he knew he would not get enough of - but it had been torn from him and here he was, an addict who was denied the sweet aphrodisiac he had just taken his first taste of.
“He was probably blown away by your performance, don’t you think? You looked downright sinful up there, do you know that? Everyone with eyes could see it. He’s probably just one of your many fans.”
Dean’s whine caused another wave of heat to surge through him and he moaned as he pushed his lips against Dean’s mouth again, craving the touch like a man who had been starved for years. He needed it so much, it almost hurt. The desire for Dean was suddenly all there: all the months he had spent pining for him, all the pent-up emotions, the frustration and the disappointment, the sadness, and the hopeless attraction; all of these, bundled together into a blazing fire building deep in the pit of his stomach, consuming him, taking over him and he realized he needed to calm down or he would frighten Dean away.
They ate without talking. It wouldn’t be possible with the loud music anyway and Dean knew Alastair was doing this to make him feel uncomfortable. He knew he was watching him while he was eating his food slowly and he tried to make himself look calm and steady. Alastair didn’t like it when he was too openly nervous, it made him look stupid, he said.
Alastair looked up at the ceiling and chuckled, the noise sounding strangely otherworldly to Dean. “Oh, Dean, Dean. Do you really think that’s going to help him?” He twisted his head to one side, then to the other, stretching his neck, looking like an insect.
Dean took a deep breath and his eyes roamed over the room. “I…it’s not important. I made him mad. I made a mistake and he….he got angry at me.”
Awkward silence engulfed them and Castiel didn’t like it, so he changed the topic.
Was it? Something twisted deep within Dean as he forced himself to consider the possibility, tuning out the voice inside him that was crying out in misery at the very thought.
A few moments later, Charlie came out of the gym, alone. There were still sounds coming out of the hall, so the performances were still on and she had left Jo inside to talk to him alone.
“Would you like me to leave?” Castiel asked cautiously.
He took another step forward, but this time Dean took a step backwards so Castiel remained where he was.
The voice would not allow him peace.
With distress Dean realized halfway through he had trouble concentrating on his work. The face of a certain someone kept reappearing in his mind, and it was completely distracting. He turned on the radio and sung perfectly in tune to the melody of some old rock song he didn’t know the name of. That helped a lot and he managed to get through the whole pile of shirts while singing and humming to himself when he wasn’t able to remember certain lines incidentally.
Charlie decided to just ask Dean again and again until he would allow her to visit him. She also wandered down the street to casually take a look at the Christensen’s house. When she reported back to Castiel after a couple of days he was sad but not surprised to hear that Dean had not been persuaded to let her visit. She also reported that Dean never seemed to leave the house, his car was always parked outside their garage. But Alastair seemed to leave just like usual, as she had seen him leave in his uniform in the morning and come back in the evening.
“I’m sorry, Mr Novak, of course, it’s nice to meet you, I’m Dean.”
Alastair shook his head in disappointment. “What you’ve given him bullshit! What good will it do him when the other kids attack and bully him? Will he be able to defend himself from their beating by believing in himself? Will he be safe from their fists by remembering some dumb, empty words you told him?”
Eventually the door opened and Castiel’s heart stopped for a second. Right in front of him stood the most beautiful man he had ever seen.
Rereading the messages, hearing Cas’ voice in his head as if he were speaking them out loud, made his heart fill with a terrible ache again and his whole body throbbed with a pain that was almost unbearable. He shook his head and tried to swallow the heavy lump in his throat away, but he failed and suddenly he realized his cheeks were wet with tears.
It was more of an order than a request and Dean gulped and nodded. He let himself be drawn against Alastair once more and curled up against him. Alastair absently pushed his hand through Dean’s hair as he slowly drifted off. Five minutes later he was sound asleep. Sex always had that effect on him, and Dean was always thankful for that fact.
But now….now he felt different.
But Castiel took another step. “Just…
“Now, tell me. Why were you late tonight?”
Dark spots appeared in front of his eyes and the edges of his vision blurred. Once again, he desperately tried to escape, this time trying to get his legs off the couch, so he could wriggle free but his husband’s other hand held him in place by a tight grip on his hipbone. He was completely helpless against Alastair’s superior strength.
Finally, Alastair looked up at him and Dean’s heart almost stopped in his chest when he saw the familiar expression on his face. Dean knew it very well, its memory was written inside his very soul, and his stomach twisted in fear as he recognized it. He had seen it many times: this look of utter disdain, mixed with a hint of anger boiling underneath. This time though, the anger wasn’t controlled like it usually was. The white in Alastair’s eyes seemed to almost overflow and Dean’s mouth went dry as he realized this would be one of those days.
Back in the plane he cursed himself for ruining the weekend for his family as well as for himself. A lost opportunity if there ever was one.
She made an exasperated sound. “Hello-o? Then you don’t teach me at your school. You teach me lessons privately. I’ll pay you in cash. How does that sound?”
The shy smile that appeared on Dean’s lips made Castiel’s heart leap in joy, but he did not let it show on his face, afraid that his reaction would scare the other man away.
Castiel’s eyes shot up, and he met those cold blue eyes once more, suppressing a shiver.
“Hey, sweetie, “Castiel said softly, his eyes quickly roaming over the animal’s trembling body. “What happened to you, poor thing? Did you get hurt? I’m sorry, sweetheart. Would you let me take a look at you?”
“Oh God, I’m sorry, I was in a hurry, I didn’t pay attention…” he spluttered as he reached out his hand to help the other person stand up – that’s when he recognized the person he had run over. It was Dean Christensen.
and sat down on the couch once again, turning the TV on.
Touched, he put one of his hands over hers and smiled. “Th-thanks, Charlie.”
Sure enough, Alastair took a step forward, crowding Castiel against his car in an obvious attempt to intimidate him. He loomed over Castiel as something cold flashed in his eyes and the smile disappeared from his face, dropping all pretence.
“Why? Because of your husband?” Castiel stepped forward and gently took Dean’s hand into his, glad that they finally had some contact, a physical connection.
“Dean. Listen to me”
The day couldn’t get much worse.
He resisted the urge to grab Dean by the arms and haul him into the house before the man could change his mind and flee. He stood back so Dean had enough space to come inside, without getting too near.
“May I?” he asked, gently.
Then he realized that Dean was staring at him, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation. He looked as if he was about to jump from the bed and flee, discouraged by Castiel’s hesitation and obvious emotional response to the vivid imagery in front of him.
A new wave of fury rolled over Castiel as much too vivid images appeared in his mind and pushing them out took quite some effort. He needed to focus on this, everything else had to wait. For all its worth, Dean could be lucky that his husband hadn’t broken anything in his face. Aside from the additional pain it would have caused Dean, Castiel was thankful for another reason: if something had been broken, he would have been forced to take Dean to the hospital for surgery and he had absolutely no idea how he would have persuaded Dean to come with him. Unfortunately, as of yet, he still couldn’t be sure that there weren’t any other injuries on his body that warranted going to the hospital.
“I like you, too, “he said simply as if he weren’t on the verge of imploding every second now. “That’s good, isn’t it?” There were butterflies in his stomach doing somersaults and he just hoped his face didn’t betray his inner elation, he’d certainly look like a grinning madman – not the thing he was aiming for at this moment.
“Do you take me for a fool, Dean?!”
(See the end of the chapter for
When he finally parked the car in front of their house, he allowed himself a few seconds to breathe, although he was really late. He suspected his pulse was racing with his distress and he needed to calm down so Alastair wouldn’t suspect anything.
He wanted to beg his husband to let him breathe, but he couldn’t. He tried to get out of his husband’s brutal grip but found he could not move and he could already feel his strength leaving him. His vision went blurry, white noise pounding in his ears, his legs starting to buckle and he desperately grasped at the counter, stark, naked fear taking him in its cruel grip.
“You fucking slut!”
That was bad. Alastair almost never cooked, not because he wasn’t able – on the few occasions he had prepared a meal it had been surprisingly delicious – but because he thought it took up too much of his precious time and Dean wasn’t working full-time anyway. Hence, he expected Dean to have his meals cooked every evening while Alastair usually got home in the middle of preparations, when he would sit down onto the sofa with his laptop, finishing work notes until Dean was ready to serve. If Alastair had decided to cook dinner tonight himself, that didn’t bode well for his mood. He went after him at once, trying to catch his husband’s eye.
She rattled off the address and he faintly noticed that she seemed to live on the same street as he although on the other end. She bade him goodbye and he found himself staring at his phone again.
Dean flinched when Castiel cupped his face and kissed him again but he did not pull away. Not knowing if this was the last time he would ever get to taste these lips or breathe in the scent of the man he was in love with Castiel closed his eyes, trying to cherish the moment.
He really looked forward to his next shift at the clinic. The team working there was very friendly and easy-going. They joked around while they were working and he liked that they simply welcomed him in their team without asking too many questions. He found himself goofing around with the nurses and the other doctors easily, for once forgetting to brood about his worries or even Dean.
It turned out that she didn’t have to. Dean texted her first, telling her that he could not work for the next few weeks because of a sprained wrist.
Castiel swallowed and sighed, his eyes unconsciously flitting towards the other man’s full lips, then taking in the light freckles dusted across his face, before he forced himself to look back up into Dean’s eyes. “I’m sorry, I really don’t know what I’m doing here. But ...I just can’t bear the thought of you going back. I...I...you know I have feelings for you.”
He had never spoken to Mrs. Hill again.
After fifteen very uncomfortable minutes they had both finished their meals and Alastair switched off the music. The sudden silence in the room was strange and Dean felt nauseous all of a sudden, the food laying heavily in his stomach.
“Where did you find him?”
“Uhm, no, “Dean answered without looking at Castiel. “It’s not his thing, so I do it.” He hurried to add “I like it, though. Cooking. It helps me relax, I love just listening to some music and preparing a meal by myself.”
“Still, “he said instead, imploringly. “Please, Dean. Please.”
Dean said nothing and hesitated but after a few seconds he nodded slowly. He closed his eyes and Castiel did too.
The longer he looked at himself, the more awful he felt. Suddenly, he just wanted to lie down and go to sleep. Staying conscious was just too hard, he was at a point where he couldn’t take this anymore. It was just too much.
“Uhmm …. well, you need to know that in the past few weeks Dean and I met once per week.”
“Whoa, seriously?” Charlie jumped up in her seat. “Well, that’s interesting! Doesn’t exactly shines a bright light on the LGBT community, them not introducing themselves and all ….”
“You only live once, bro!” he shouted back, “enjoy it while you’re still relatively young!”
Her face fell. “Right. That would not be such a good idea.”
“But it is!”
Castiel groaned again as he ran a hand through his hair. Dean had looked downright terrified, caught like a deer in the headlights and it had been because of him, Castiel.
“Hey, you, “he said as he gingerly touched the dog’s back, cooing when the dog whined but allowed the touch, “my name is Castiel. I am going to check where you are hurt. Alright? It will only hurt a little bit, I promise.”
“Uhm, I’m sorry, “he said, clearing his voice in embarrassment when he realized he sounded a little hoarse.  “So was that all you wanted? Because I need to get into the house.”
“Stop, Cas, “Dean eventually said, breaking the kiss and pushing him away with a firm touch to his chest. “I’ve got to go now.”
He carried the dog to his car, and laid him on the back seat, putting him on an old blanket he pulled from the trunk. The dog whined and panted heavily while being moved but when he was finally lying on the blanket, he looked up at Dean thankfully, licking his hand enthusiastically.
“Actually, “Dean said shyly, staring at the ground, “would you maybe help me change? I- I don’t think I can manage with the wrist and the ribs…only if that’s alright with you, of course!”
He breathed heavily against Castiel’s skin. Castiel felt as if his whole body was aflame with the sensation and he almost didn’t dare breathe or move a muscle for fear of chasing Dean away again.
“Calm down, buddy, ”Dean murmured as he stroked the dog’s back, managing to calm the agitated animal a little bit. He pulled his phone out of his jacket and bit his lip in frustration. “Damn, I don’t have any reception here.”
Dean’s heart beat in his chest as he slowly worked his way down the stairs and then down their street. He could see that almost all the lights in the houses next to theirs were on. Everyone was probably eating dinner now, or already getting ready for bed. Maybe they would sit together, watch TV or play boardgames. Happy families. Happy couples. Dean envied them shamelessly.
He still felt a little nauseous. It could come from the kicks to his stomach. Or, if he was really unlucky, he had a concussion. It had happened before, once, shortly after the incident with Alastair’s friend Zachariah at the bar. Alastair had seen him get hugged by one of his professors after the semester had ended and he had reacted very badly. It hadn’t been the first time that he had hit Dean, but the first time that it had been that bad. They had ended up at the ER where he had been diagnosed with a concussion. The doctor had only shaken her head in disapproval when Dean told her that he had fallen down the stairs. He couldn’t blame her, but he really hadn’t known what else to tell her. Alastair had apologized profoundly and treated him as if he were made of glass for the next few weeks when he had been on bed rest and that had been very nice.
“Is something wrong, Dean?” Alastair studied his frowning face with intense scrutiny.
“Hng...wha’, where?” he mumbled as he was starting to wake and Dean started to panic.
“No!”
Castiel could see that these two were very much in love. They were always touching in one way or another. Charlie, obviously the more talkative one of them, specifically always seemed to stroke Jo’s hand or she snuggled against her and Castiel thought it adorable. He felt a tinge of sadness that he didn’t have what they had but he was happy for them.
But Dean had already turned to search for something to clean up the wine. “I’m sorry, I’ll clean this up at once. I’m always so clumsy, I always do this. I should really be more careful.” He moved around in the kitchen, muttering nervously, still searching.
Never had it been that bad. Alastair had whipped him for what seemed like an eternity until he had been nothing than a sobbing, bleeding mess on the floor. Apart from the fact that it was a whip instead of a belt he was whipping him with, Alastair seemed to put more force to his blows, resulting in much worse pain with every single stroke he was giving to Dean. After the first five blows, Dean was unable to hold his weight on his knees, leaning forward to support himself on his arms. After ten blows he was breathing so hard he was almost hyperventilating. After the twentieth blow, he was almost unconscious, and the blood was running down his back, staining the carpet beneath him. He didn’t know where right or left was and there were so many tears in his eyes that he couldn’t see, everything was just a blur.
“I love you, sweetheart.”
This man would kill if provoked.
What would Castiel think of him if he saw him now?
He eventually realized they were shaking hands a little longer than necessary and he quickly released Dean’s hand. “Please, Dean, call me Castiel.”
Castiel tried not to sound too annoyed when he asked “Your cooking? Doesn’t Alastair cook, too?”
“What else would you have done if I hadn’t been home? Would you have invited him inside, let him feel you up some more, maybe even let him fuck you? Would you?!”
Dean nodded, staring at his hand in Castiel’s lap as if entranced.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t say that, “he said, smiling shyly. “I’m sure that’s not true.”
The picture Dean’s eyes had fallen upon was one of the first pictures taken of him after he and Alastair had gotten together. It had been snapped by Alastair who had always loved to take pictures of him. He had always insisted that Dean was incredibly photogenic and that it would be a shame not to capture his beauty for eternity. On this particular photo Dean was sitting on his bed, playing the guitar, averting his gaze and blushing slightly.
The edges of Dean’s lips curled upwards a little, although the smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I promise.” And then he left.
Throwing his hands up in angry frustration, Castiel cursed and shook his head at himself. His mouth pressed into a tight line as he resolved to mow the lawn tomorrow – it was much too late today and he would probably only ruin his garden, or hurt himself, if he tried to do it today in such a state that he was in now. Shoshanna gave a low compassionate whine from the trunk and Castiel hummed in silent gratefulness. At least he had her and she wouldn’t judge him for his silly behaviour.
Biting at his cuticles, Castiel tossed to his side nervously.
“Thanks, Charlie. I- I don’t know what to say.”
A soft kiss was placed upon his forehead. Then there were arms on his shoulders, pushing him off gently and he winced, as their bodies were separated from each other.
“Look at me, baby.”
“Well, I’m looking forward to it, too. Good evening, gentleman.”
Dean nodded weakly and when Alastair inclined his head to the table, he sat himself down on his usual chair. The dinner table was fully set and beautifully decorated. There were fresh tulips in a vase and two lit candles in the middle of the table. Dean’s heart rate increased considerably as his mind rushed through the possible explanations for this. Had he missed an anniversary? He always remembered those because he knew they were very important to Alastair. What did he forget? He knew he was in trouble for not remembering and he felt slightly hysterical. He tried to not let it show on his face, but he was freaking out internally and his brain told him to flee while he still could.
Following his instinct, Castiel pulled at Dean’s wrist and draped it onto his thigh. He grabbed the second cold compress and pressed it against the swollen wrist. “We wait for twenty minutes, then I’ll bandage it. Okay?”
He made himself a small salad, changed into his pyjamas and switched the TV on. He watched the news as he ate his salad. After that he found nothing interesting on any channel, so he switched the TV off and walked the stairs up where his bed room was.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, “Castiel replied coolly, although inside, he was panicking like crazy and he unconsciously congratulated himself on his remarkable collectedness.
Dean grinned up at her while still stroking the happy beast in his lap. “Well, maybe I’m special.”
But there had been a few times when Castiel had lost his cool and stead composure. When he had been unable to reign the anger in, when he had been overwhelmed with such overwhelming fury that had taken him over and changed him into something else, into a force of nature instead of a simple human being.
I really hope the scenes I mentioned in the beginning were not too hard to read. I realize it's all very depressing, but our happy ending is awaiting, just hang on a little longer :)
“I’m terrified, “he repeated, forcing himself to keep looking into Dean’s glimmering green eyes, the same as Dean apparently forced himself to do. “because I’m worried for you, Dean. But as I said, you’re safe. He won’t find you here. He won’t come here and even if he was that stupid to do so, I would call the police, no matter that he’s a part of them. I can’t force you to come to the hospital with me. I don’t want to force you to do anything. I just want you to be okay. Alright?”
Apparently, Alastair was getting impatient, because he suddenly gripped Dean’s hips and started to thrust upwards into Dean, thus taking the control from him. Dean adjusted accordingly and resorted to meeting his husband’s movements in consenting little pushes downward.
He smiled to himself and winced as the movement hurt his split lip.
His face was hidden behind black-tinted sunglasses but Castiel recognized him all the same. His tall, lean frame was hovering in front of the window as he waited for Castiel to hand him the documents he had asked for. Because of the glasses Castiel couldn’t see his eyes, but there was no obvious sign that Alastair recognised him.
He finally felt his eyelids growing heavier. He snuggled against his pillow and closed his eyes. He told himself that he had to concentrate on his new job, that’s what he was here for. His first day tomorrow would be great, he hoped. He banned further thoughts of beautiful Dean from his mind and drifted into sleep.
“He attacked him?” Castiel could imagine Dean’s desperate attempts of calming his boyfriend down, trying to get his attention only to be shoved out of the way in order to get to Adam. He felt angry just thinking about it.
The younger man was already out of the building, walking towards his car when Castiel finally staggered out of the clinic, the door slamming shut behind him
“I-I’m s-sorry, Castiel.”
The familiar nasal voice roused Dean from his deep slumber as he slowly became aware of large, wiry hands travelling down his chest towards his legs, grabbing the soft flesh of his thighs.
“Yes, “Dean said quietly, bowing his head in submission trying to ignore the way his body was starting to tremble. “I deserve it.”
Shaking his head in rekindling frustration he got up and made the few steps to the gym’s entrance. This time when he entered the lights were on and he could see that the place was almost empty now, countless rows of seats abandoned apart from the few performers greeted and congratulated enthusiastically by families and friends. A few older teenagers and teachers were on and around the stage, packing up instruments and microphones.
“Ah, Shosh, we’re going home a little earlier than usual. I’m just a little tired. Come on.”
“Are you sorry for what you’ve done, boy?”
They stood in front of each other, only a few inches between them but to Castiel it appeared as if there was a whole ocean between them. His arms were resting against his sides uselessly, he knew he would not be able to reach out to Dean now and Dean would not take him up on the offer if he could.
he imagined his brother Gabriel say.
The man smiled at him openly and Dean found himself returning the smile automatically.
He didn’t want to hear this. He didn’t want to even think this.
Castiel interrupted quickly. “Please, Dean. I don’t think you’re an idiot! I was the one disrespecting your borders and I’m very sorry for that. I ask again that you forgive me.”
“No, “Castiel said abruptly, shaking his head as he pushed Tony away from him. “I’m sorry, I thought I could do this, but I can’t.”
When he was finished, Castiel stroked over the dressing with his thumb.
“We had just been friends, Adam and me. He was this nice guy, another music student and he was brilliant at playing the guitar. W-we used to play together. Well, at least a couple of times.”
Dean chuckled at her childlike delight. “I swear, for someone just getting started you are extremely good. Seriously, you’ve got talent, Charlie.”
Castiel, upset that he had upset Dean, took a step toward him, trying to reassure him. “Please, Dean, I know what you asked and I’m sorry that I came here. But I had to talk to you, I needed to see how you are. Please, calm down.”
“Yes, I did.” A sad smile crept up his lips as he remembered that day, only a little while ago, where he and Dean had spent the most wonderful few hours together. It had been so easy to be with Dean, just talking and walking together, having a nice picnic outdoors as if they had no troubles in the world, as if Dean wasn’t married and the possibility of them becoming a couple had been just a question of timing.
Irina Novak couldn’t seem to let go of her youngest son. Castiel indulged her and held her tightly. She sniffled, her eyes watery.
“Right.” She smiled back at him and placed her hands on her knees, leaning forward. “So. I need to learn to play the guitar and I’d really really reaaaaally like you to be my teacher. So, will you say yes, Dean?”
So, I have an essay due tomorrow, but here I am procrastinating .... But writing Destiel ist just so much more fun than writing about social security systems, so here we are :)
How he wished it could be like that.
He nodded to himself in nervous agreement with himself and noticed he had reached his home. He opened the door with his keys, threw his backpack on the floor in total contrast to his usual neatness and settled on his couch, phone in his hand.
He turned to whiskey then and got really drunk. Dean nodded in relief when he was ordered to clean up the mess in the kitchen so that Alastair could read the newspaper in peace. Dean was still standing at the sink washing the dishes when he was suddenly grabbed from behind, firm arms wrapping around his waist, and then there was a wet mouth nuzzling into his neck.

The door fell shut behind them and their hand’s disconnected automatically. They took off their jackets and shoes, washed their hands and agreed to eat dinner together in half an hour. As was their usual routine, Alastair sat down in the living room with his laptop to get some things done for work, while Dean disappeared into the kitchen to prepare dinner. Alastair had asked him for something light, so he was only going to make a chicken salad tonight.
She stared at him, apparently unable to comprehend what he was trying to tell her when suddenly her eyes widened in realization.
On other, very rare occasions, Alastair would not be so in control of his emotions when he punished Dean. Sometimes, he got so upset over something Dean had said or done, he would simply lash out and strike Dean. Or punch him in the stomach. On a couple of occasions, Alastair had absolutely lost control over himself and given Dean a brutal beating. He wouldn’t ever hit him in the face because that would be too obvious, he was always careful not to hurt Dean where it would be visible to others.
“I will, “he answered. “Now I’m curious, too.”
After a while, Dean slid downwards a little and settled his head in the crook of Castiel’s throat.
Especially Ben Braeden who would be presenting his first solo performance in front of an audience, was very nervous and Dean had spent weeks trying to convince him to perform. Ben was a natural when it came to playing the guitar, Dean had seen that from the very start. But Ben was shy and afraid he was going to mess up in front of people. At long last, Dean had been able to convince him by saying that he wouldn’t be able to see anyone because of the lights shining on him. That seemed to calm Ben down and he finally agreed to perform an altered version of “Greensleeves” but only if Dean promised he would stay at Ben’s side at the edge of the stage so he could help him out if Ben suddenly forgot how to play.
Dean looked up sharply at Castiel’s question. His eyes darted back down quickly, then up again, searching the older man’s face curiously. When he was met with an earnest, calm expression, he shyly dropped his gaze again and nodded.
Castiel nodded. “Well, they’re the new neighbours who didn’t introduce themselves yet. The husband is Chief of the police here in Medford, I think Jo mentioned that, too.”
*Warning for suicidal thoughts
Charlie’s brows furrowed but she nodded. “Go on.”
“You’re very nice. Really, thanks, “he said and stood up. “But I think I have to go now.”
“Thanks, Castiel, “Dean said, grabbing his hand in earnest gratitude, making Castiel’s heart overflow with confusing, sweet pain.
He went on with his little anecdote and enjoyed Dean’s open enthusiasm for it. He chuckled quietly when Castiel explained how he at first tried in vain to get Shoshanna to not pee inside his apartment and his brows furrowed in sympathy when he told the story how his little dog had almost died when she was four months old because of an infected ear wound that wouldn’t go away. He didn’t fail to notice the irony of telling his story of love at first sight with Shoshanna to Dean.
And this was everything.
After he was gone, Dean allowed himself a small moment of repose. He knew he should eat something too, so he got a non-fat yogurt out of the fridge, cut a fresh pear into it and then sat down at the table. Slowly he sipped his coffee, while picking at his yoghurt without any real interest. When he had been a teenager, he had had a big appetite. He had loved greasy, unhealthy food, stuffing himself with burgers, fries and – most importantly – pies of any flavour whenever the opportunity offered itself, which hadn’t been often, unfortunately, due to the lack of money. His father had not approved at all and his brother who had always been something of a healthy food Nazi had looked down on him, so he had only indulged himself when he was out with friends. Luckily for him, he had always had a good metabolism and so his occasional excessive eating had no effect on his figure, he stayed slim and fit much to the dismay of his friends, especially the female ones.
“You know why I’m doing this?”
Alastair’s hand wandered down from his head to the side of his face, beginning to stroke at the back of his jaw, brushing lightly against his cheekbone.
It was terrifying to think of the possible ramifications for Dean for staying away from home for half the night. Alastair almost certainly must have punished him.
Foolish as it may be, Castiel’s hopes were up once again, just as he’d feared. It was stupid and he knew he was very probably setting himself up for another crushing disappointment, but he couldn’t help it. Maybe Charlie was right, and they could do it.
He gestured towards the chair at his desk. “Please, sit down, Dean. You look as if you’re a minute away from collapsing.”
Dean’s eyes dropped to the floor, and he desperately shook his head, his face turning ashen. “You...no, I...I’m sorry I kissed you. I shouldn’t have done that. It was wrong. You only think that you like me but…”
For a second, he couldn’t breathe. He was staring at the stage open-mouthed and his heart pounded in his chest as if it wanted to break through the flesh any second. Beads of sweat collected in the back of his neck, and a pang of nausea made itself known in his stomach. Dean slowly made his way to the microphone stand in the middle of the stage and a mixture of different emotions welled up inside Castiel. Panic threatened to overwhelm him, fear fluttering on the edge of his vision, because he shouldn’t be here. He was just getting over Dean, this was just re-opening all the old wounds.
After brushing his teeth, he went to bed with the intention to continue reading his novel, Stephen King’s IT. It was a real good novel, Castiel was a sucker for horror stories. But tonight, he couldn’t concentrate – after half an hour he realized he was still on the same page he started so he put the book away. It was still only 9 and it was just about to get dark outside.
What had he been thinking? Was he completely out of his mind?
Castiel absently smiled at the dog’s owner, then softly tugged at the leash to get Shoshanna’s attention.
“I wish I could so something but that’s just it. I can’t because I’m helpless and I just hate this guy that’s doing this to him. I hate him!”
“Come on, Dean. Let’s continue watching, shall we?” Alastair winked and jerked his chin toward the TV. Dean followed his stare, unbelievingly, then he nodded, dazed.
“Make yourself at home. What’s your poison, Dean?” She looked at him expectantly and he needed a second to comprehend what she had asked him.
Alastair proceeded to fuck him hard and without mercy, pushing him so hard against the counter with every thrust that Dean knew that there would be black bruises on his hips and thighs the next day. But the initial agony from the unprepared penetration had subsided to a dull, throbbing kind of pain and he thought he could bear it. He cried out in surprise when his husband pushed his hand into his hair and pulled, forcing his head back as he pounded into him from behind.
He groaned in frustration, growing more and more exasperated with himself.
He was probably supposed to follow them a few seconds after. But he couldn’t help but look up again. He knew now it would have been incredibly stupid to go to Dean and he was thankful for Charlie’s intervention, but still, he needed one last look before he could leave.
But then Dean broke away from him, pushing weakly with both hands against Castiel’s chest.
Dean’s eyes flew open.
Castiel was speechless. “God, Dean ….” he said eventually, “I am so sorry.”
Her eyes dropped in defeat. “Yes, I hired him as my private teacher.”
“I’m relieved to hear that, “she said, then her face turned serious again, “but I can tell that there’ something wrong. You wanna talk about it? No pressure or anything…”
The next thing he did, was clean up his mess in the living room. His hands were still shaking, and he needed a lot more time than he would normally have, but at last he got the carpet clean.
After a bit of struggling, Dean managed to get his jacket off and Castiel gently took it out of his hand, laying it down behind him on the armrest of the couch. He wondered about the jumpsuit Dean was wearing, eventually realizing that Dean apparently had worked on his beloved Impala before...whatever had happened, happened.
Castiel reacted at once. He stepped in front of Dean and brought his face close to Dean’s. They weren’t touching, but they were very close now.
She beamed up at him. “But only because I have the best teacher on this planet!”
Castiel closed his eyes and counted to five, taking a deep breath. Then he opened them again and concentrated on breathing out slowly, gradually calming himself down that way.
“I can’t, Castiel!” Dean cried out, his voice bordering on hysterical. “I can’t! He will kill us both when he finds out about us, I just know that he will! Please, Cas! Let me go - there is no other way!”
Apparently, his brain – or was it his heart - was just too stupid to understand the concept of a life without Dean and did that not just make him the dumbest person in the whole world?
But suddenly, Dean was pulling away from him, the comfortable warmth gone.
This had happened only twice before and Alastair had been in a very bad mood then too. It had been one of the worst feelings Dean had ever experienced, even worse than the belting/whipping. Because the pain was something he could deal with. The fear of not knowing if he would die in the next few seconds or not was something he could not.
Dean almost cried out in relief when he heard the noise of Alastair putting his belt away. Then there were footsteps again, heavy on the wooden floor and he held his breath as they stopped in front of him. The pain in his back was so overwhelming, he would do anything to just lie down on the floor and sleep, but he knew he had to wait until he was allowed to move.
Without waiting for the other man’s reply, he pushed past him into the mass of bodies behind him. He needed to find Gabriel and tell him he was leaving. Suddenly he was completely sober, and he felt suffocated in the dense, humid room which felt much too small for so many people. He fought his way through the crowd and finally found his brother chatting up another guy at the bar.
“Okay, okay, calm down, bro, I hear you, “she said quickly, raising her hands defiantly and after a few seconds of staring at each other he sat back beside her, dropping his head in despairing frustration.
Castiel nodded too and took one step towards Dean.
“You still need to heal, baby, “he said with a patient smile. “I don’t want you to hurt even more.” Even for him, this seemed exceptionally kind.
He blinked in the darkness, illuminated only by the faint moonlight coming through the window curtains, as he tried to gather his wits, trying to determine where he was.
A deep feeling of regret filled his guts suddenly as the right answer came to him and Alastair confirmed his suspicion right in time.
“Dean is mine and you have no right to stare at him, “Alastair snapped, baring his teeth at Castiel. “And if I ever catch you staring at him again, you will regret it!”
Castiel’s shoulders slumped down. “There’s nothing to be done. I just have to accept the fact that I can’t see him anymore. That we will never be together. He’ll stay with his abusive husband for the rest of his life and will get beaten up by him and that’s that. I shouldn’t have gotten involved with him in the first place. I knew it wasn’t a good idea, but I had to keep on going, I had to get to know him. Well, that’s what I get for being greedy.”
But now, in his current mood, it was the perfect solution. His weekends were lonely and miserable and he was no good friend or family member to anyone - so why not do something useful with his time? It would keep him from becoming an alcoholic and a fat loser. Moreover, it would keep him busy, save him some time from being his sad, lovesick self. To keep sane, to keep himself distracted. He realized he needed this, so he decided to go for it.
“Didn’t you hear me?”
She jogged off. After two minutes she came back, holding the phone in her hand with a grin on her face. “It was on the counter. You probably left it there when we were waiting for the coffee to finish.”
He would climb into his husband's lap and beg him to make love to him. He would let Alastair undress him and sigh in apparent content when Alastair attacked his neck with his hungry wet kisses. He would open his mouth in invitation and he would arch his back when he entered him, crying out in apparent lust. He would moan and sigh and call out his husband’s name as he was pounded into, his husband’s fingers digging into his hips because he loved to take him from behind where he could see the wounds he had inflicted upon him, see the submission from his husband, which he was due.
It reached the point where he thought that he could not do this, that he was unable to calm down, that he would launch into the panic attack he had managed to avoid before, and that Castiel would see then how he really was. He would see the whole pathetic mess that was Dean.
Somehow he managed to close the door behind him without making any noise. Quietly he made his way over to the staircase - and froze when he detected Shoshanna, staring up at him from her bed on the floor with her tongue hanging out, wagging her tail happily.
Despite the terrible ordeal that Dean had gone through, despite the heartache and the endless months of desperation and pining Castiel had suffered. Despite all the what-ifs, and the could-nots, despite the thought of them being together, sharing the same space, had seemed an absolute impossibility just hours ago, this was where they found themselves.
Castiel took one deep breath and then started texting.
He really tried to think of something else than Dean. He put a lot of effort into distracting himself, busying himself with work and things to do in the afternoons and evenings. The day after Charlie had come by, he showed up at work, apologizing to a surprised Alec for supposedly letting her down the day before, pressing her to let him take over a few of her patients. Although she assured him it was totally normal not to show up at work when feeling sick he stubbornly insisted he had to make it up to her, so he spent the next few days working overtime, staying at the practice up unto 6 o’clock, finishing paperwork and tending to the occasional emergency.
“I’m sorry I came here, Dean. Please forgive me. I’ll go now, so you can relax.” He stood up and turned towards the door.
“But there is, Dean, if we only put our minds to it!” Castiel was excited now - that they were even talking about this, something that he would never have thought possible. The prospect of convincing Dean to stay with him perhaps just a moment away.
“He’s going to find out, I know he will.”
“Dean, wait, “he called, and Dean stopped, hand on the door knob. “Please don’t leave like this. Let’s meet soon so we can talk a little more. Would that be okay for you?”
Dean tried to shake his head but found he couldn’t, not with his husband’s hand around his throat, holding him in place. “N-no!” he protested weakly.
He jumped off the couch and began pacing the living room up and down nervously. Every few seconds he stared at his phone which sat on the coffee table, ignoring him completely. After ten minutes of nervous pacing he shook his head in frustration and made his way over to the kitchen.
Dean closed his eyes. A lump grew in his throat, but he swallowed it down. He really should have known.
Or maybe he was still sleeping. Sleeping in his warm, comfortable bed, dreaming about Dean. Still peacefully unaware of Dean’s treachery, still thinking of him as pure and good and worthy of his affection?
Castiel swallowed heavily as an uneasy feeling settled in his stomach. “What do you mean, you’re not sure?”
“It seems, you’re right, “he said with an encouraging smile and for a second, Dean smiled back, shyly, which immediately caused Castiel’s heart to swell with barely-concealed fondness.
him to realize that he was safe with Castiel and that they would find a way - somehow - to keep Alastair at bay.
Cain’s eyes twinkled and his lips twitched as he grinned and leaned forward, right into Dean’s personal space.
“You’ll never know, “he quietly whispered to himself and he smiled. He was hopelessly romantic, and he would never give up the idea that somewhere in the world there was someone special for him. He would find him someday somehow. He just hoped he didn’t have to wait until he was eighty to reach that goal.
Dean didn’t say anything so Castiel continued. “I know we’ve only spent very little time together. I know this sounds ridiculous. But I can’t help it. I immensely enjoy being with you, I’m incredibly happy when you text me and I can’t stop smiling when I’m around you. Yes, maybe it’s wrong to feel this way, Dean, but I can’t help it.”
“... I just knew, Dean. I wanted you from the very beginning. I don’t know why but...Please believe me, Dean. And then we met at my house and later at the lake and...well, I felt this sort of connection between us. Like I have never felt with anyone else before…”
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, but it wouldn’t go away. “Hm. Oh yes, I think I’ve seen him at the supermarket that one time. We practically ran into each other. But he was in a hurry, so we just said hello and went on our separate ways. It was months ago so I almost forgot. But that’s it.”
“Yes! Yes!” Alastair came and as his body thrust upward one last time together with another forceful stroke of Dean’s erection, Dean came too. But then Alastair bit him and the wave of pleasure turned into something less pleasant, as the sudden pain in his throat overwhelmed Dean completely.
Well, apparently, he hadn’t got that message across clearly. He needed to work on that.
“I’m sure they will, dear, “Irina said and she stood up to clear the table.
His tone sounded sincere and when Dean dared a quick look up, he saw his husband smile at him. The knot in his stomach loosened a little and a breath he didn’t know he had been holding in left his body, as he returned the smile shyly.
“How can you be so calm about this?” Castiel asked, appalled that Dean didn’t seem overly upset over the possibility of dying by his husband’s vicious hands. Dean didn’t answer him, he just looked up, his expression calm and resigned.
He walked through the blurry masses of cloud, engulfed in blurry nothingness, and tried to make sense of this world, so different from where he had come from.
He stopped and paused when he felt Dean’s hands tensing in his own.
“Dean!” He flinched at the harsh call of his name, but Alastair’s stare was strict. “Stop blabbering. You know I don’t like when you do that, it’s so childish.”
Although at the moment, Dean seemed to be on board with the whole kissing thing.
“Oh.” Castiel didn’t know what to say to that at first and they stayed silent for a minute or two.
More than once, Castiel cursed himself for being a heavy sleeper and he had chided Shoshanna for failing to let him know that Dean had left. It was stupid of course because it wasn’t the dog’s fault. He knew that she loved Dean who had probably asked her to stay quiet and who could blame him?
“Then take it, whore. Take my cock and shut up. God, you should be thankful you are so pretty, it’s why I put up with you and all your bullshit.”
“Stop, Dean.” An order, spit out, harshly. Dean fell silent at once. He was standing in the middle of their living room, frozen as he watched his husband move around the dinner table like a tiger deciding when to eat his prey.
Then he climbed up the stairs.
Castiel couldn’t help but giggle excitedly after this short “conversation” with Dean. It had been short, and Dean’s answers had been short, too but what did that matter?
After a few more weeks, he had reached another low end. He was coping fine at work but he was barely sleeping, and he had lost his appetite. He went to work and he cooked himself dinner when he came home but he ended up throwing half the meal away after eating whatever he had made mechanically, not tasting any flavors. He went to bed early but ended up staring at the ceiling for hours. When his mother who was worried about him, as well as  Anna and Gabriel, began nagging him with their concern, phoning him almost daily, he stopped answering the phone. They couldn’t help him, so why bother talking to them about his lovesickness.
“Ah, the tea’s ready. Let’s get you warmed up. But first, let me wrap your wrist, it won’t take long.”
“Except for that thing with Dean’s friend, “she reminded him quickly, but he jumped off the couch and shook his head angrily.
Angry with himself he raised his hands quickly, placatingly. “I’m sorry. It’s just that …. You really don’t need to worry about me, Charlie, because everything’s fine. Alright? I’m okay.”
She nodded at once, her sharp eyes darting over his face as if to assess his mental state. “Of course, I’ll explain everything, but you need to calm down.”
Anna noticed the serious look on her brother’s face as they sat together on her balcony, eating the delicious casserole she had cooked for them. She poured some more red wine into his glass and fixed him with a curious glance.
“Not yet. I’m just going to get into the shower really quick.”
Dr. Lindt was as nice as she had sounded on the phone and they had already discussed work specifics. He would start in a week, and his brother and mother would stay until a day before then. He was eager to show them the town and the beautiful area in which he had chosen his new home. There was a beautiful lake where one could go swimming or fishing, there were thick forests to explore and mountains small and huge, perfect for hiking trips. It was just the beginning of May, summer was ahead of him and he felt as if he could do anything he wanted. The world was his oyster.
“Well, Castiel. Tell us about you, “Jo said, “we already know you’re a wonderful cookie maker but there has to be more to you than that, right?” She grinned at him and he grinned back openly.
Dean shrugged. “My wrist is sprained and my ribs are bruised. They’ve given me something against the pain and I have to take it easy for a little while.”
“No, you don’t need to do that, “Dean said at once. “Please, they look fine as they are.”
He was at a dead end. Again.
Castiel’s lips pressed together into a tight line, as he struggled to come to terms with what Dean had just revealed. Angry fists shook against the cushions on the sofa, his nails biting viciously into the palms of his hands.
Suddenly, the screen of a mobile phone blinked bright in the darkness, drawing his eyes right to it, and Dean realized with unexpected clarity that it was his own. It lay on top of his jumpsuit which was folded neatly onto the nightstand next to the bed.
“I know, I know. I talk too much, I know.” He hung his head a little.
“Castiel, I- “Dean started anew, “I like you.” He actually blushed saying that and Castiel was taken by surprise as his heart ached at the cuteness in front of him. At the same time, he was incredibly relieved to hear Dean say it out loud. He had hoped that the other man felt the same, he had suspected he did, but having the words coming out of Dean's own mouth was enormously reassuring.
“Well, then….” Castiel looked around wildly, desperately searching for the answer that would make Dean see reason. “Then we leave! We leave Medford and go somewhere far far away. He wouldn’t find us.”
After a few days of crying and agonizing, something within him changed. Suddenly, he felt dead inside. Depression came over him like a heavy black cloud, filling him with an emptiness he had never known before. He lay there in his bed, doing nothing all day except drift in and out of sleep, and when Alastair came home in the evening he only ate the meals he brought him because he knew that his husband would force him to eat if he didn’t. But he couldn’t entirely hide the dead look in his eyes and he knew that his smiles were forced and his embraces were weak. Afraid of being whipped again, he resolved to work harder, to make his husband happy by giving him the attention he deserved.
“Shhhh, “Alastair purred when Dean tensed for a second, “its just me, relax, sweetheart.”
“Take the day off early, okay?” Alex told him finally when he was about to fall asleep at his desk over a report on the pre-op report of one of his patients. It was just 2 pm. She laid her hand on his shoulder with honest empathy. “I’m serious, Castiel, you need to get some sleep. You’re no good to us here and you have only one appointment left. I’ll take that for you, just go home and rest.”
But when he opened his mouth to say something - anything - Dean frantically shook his head again and he closed it again. Fear blossomed in his chest, spreading out like wildfire, as he realized Dean was seconds away from bolting and he had no idea how to stop him.
The beautiful man hesitated a little more, then glanced behind his shoulder into the house as if looking for something or someone. Then he turned back and shook Castiel’s hand with a nervous smile on his lips.
But instead of letting him go and leaving, Cain took his hand in his and pulled it up to his mouth where he -to Dean’s absolute horror – kissed it softly and kept it there, his lips moist and lingering at the back of Dean’s hand.
And all of a sudden everything stopped. The tongue inside his mouth disappeared and a small chaste peck on his lips marked the end of this interaction.
After an hour everyone who had agreed to come had shown up, so he turned the music down a little, cleared his voice and tapped his spoon against his beer bottle. Everyone stopped taking and looked at him expectantly.
“Just relax, darling, I’ll take good care of you.” Alastair let go of his neck and made a trail of kisses down Dean’s arms and sides – purposely avoiding his wounded back. Then he shifted and after a pause, a long groan escaped Alastair’s mouth as he rubbed his erection between the cheeks of Dean’s ass, eventually starting to hump.
Alastair’s long lean fingers closed around his throat and pressed, cutting off his air supply immediately. Automatically, Dean’s hands flew up to try to get Alastairs hands off him. He knew he shouldn’t but he couldn’t stop himself, it was the very instinct trying to stay alive that made him do it. But Alastair just laughed and tightened his grip, making Dean choke as he was fucked within an inch of his life.
“Why what, Castiel?” Dean asked eventually, and his voice sounded hoarse. Forlorn.
He was halfway through his shift when Hannah, the veterinary nurse working at the reception, alerted them to another emergency patient.
Everything was okay. He was going to be fine.
She looked at him in wonder and he could only hope that she wouldn’t bark lest she would wake up her owner.
“Look, Anna, “he said, fixing her with a calm gaze and her expression softened at once. “I really don’t want to talk about it right now, alright? It just hurts too much at the moment and I’d really like to forget it about it, just for tonight, okay? I promise I’ll tell you another time.”
It was a choked sound that came out of Dean’s throat and Castiel pulled back, worried, but before he could do anything else,  Dean practically collapsed against him, throwing his arms around him in a desperate embrace and Castiel reacted at once, his own arms automatically wrapping around the other man, holding him tight.
He looked up and froze when he saw those sea-green eyes piercing into him, containing a feeling of sorrow so raw that it almost took the air out of him. This was Dean at his most vulnerable, yet he was trusting Castiel to take care of him and he would do anything not to make that man regret his decision.
But Dean was already shaking his head, his mouth tightened in sad resignation.
“Anything else that hurts?” Castiel asked after a while.
“Yes, I ….” Dean was still unable to speak, gaping at Castiel. “I thought that….I didn’t...why are you here?”
“Uhm hi there, “Dean began and Castiel’s heart bounced at the familiar sound of that smooth beautiful voice. Dean seemed quite nervous in front of so many people and Castiel was surprised that he had agreed to that. It was incredibly endearing, seeing him standing there like that, with his hands in his pockets because he didn’t know what else to do with them, the tips of his ears flushed red.
“Oh, Castiel! That’s so super sweet!” She jumped at little up and down in her seat and she actually clapped her hands together in excitement. He had to smile when she leaned forward to touch his arm.
He was having a panic attack, he realized with widening eyes and he quickly steered the car toward the side of the road at the beginning of a path that led into the woods and killed the engine. He suddenly craved the fresh air, feeling smothered in the small space of the car, and he fumbled for the handle of the door like a madman, chest heaving as he frantically tried to get some oxygen into his lungs.
Dean smiled again and he waited for the man to walk off but instead he took one more step towards him, his eyes raking up and down his body unashamedly and Dean couldn’t help but tense underneath the blatant scrutiny.
Then he turned back to the door.
He was tired of it all. He just wanted to be left alone.
“You said that you vomited… after?”
“Out in the woods, at the side of the highway, “Dean said quietly. “It was pure chance that I found him. He was lying there on his side, whimpering pitifully. I….I picked him up, which was stupid, I realize now. I could have hurt him even more, but...I panicked, and I put him in the backseat of my car and drove straight here. It was awful. He was bleeding and whining and I just wanted him to be alright again.”
Castiel tried a different angle. “But there’s something wrong about that husband of his. He seemed way to possessive over Dean, it really seemed odd in front of a neighbour who was just introducing himself. Maybe there’s something wrong with him.”
“Castiel? Are you alright?” He realized he was staring, and he let go of Dean’s hand at once.
Alastair was chief of police here in Medford. They would never believe him if he reported him, not in a thousand years. If anyone had the chance to cover up his own crimes and corrupt others into believing his lies it was the head of a police department. Besides, even if he weren’t chief Castiel still would need proof to his allegations. Something like a witness or pictures or video material or anything that would incriminate the man. He would at least need Dean’s testimony and he knew he wouldn’t get that. Dean would never testify against his husband, as victims of domestic abuse very rarely did, unfortunately. He’d be too scared or too ashamed and he would be afraid that Alastair would hurt Castiel as an act of revenge. So that would be totally out of the question.
Then he stood there, feeling utterly lost. He tried to think of what to do next.
“Y-yes, Sir, I’ve heard you, “Dean stuttered, “I-I’m so sorry for what I’ve done to you. I won’t do it again.”
“You know how I came to own Shoshanna? Someone brought a pregnant Labrador into the clinic where I worked at the time, she had a thorn in her paw and was bleeding quite badly. Shortly after we helped her, she gave birth to four beautiful pups and I couldn’t help myself, I fell in love with Shoshanna at first sight and I had to have her…”
He sat down next to Alastair with a cup of coffee for himself and watched his husband with a fond smile as he devoured his breakfast hungrily.
Finally, he had a talk with Charlie, asking if she could install the cameras at the Christensen’s if possible. It was a dangerous reckless plan but they needed to do something and Castiel was going crazy doing nothing at all. She told him with a stern expression that she was hellbent on doing so the moment Dean would let her into the house... but that did not seem very probable in the near future.
He raised his hands, palms up when Castiel took another step towards him. “Don’t, “he said in quiet warning, tensing up again.
Alastair was starting to get dangerously impatient. Dean could imagine him sitting on their couch at home, jumping up off it to pace their living room, clenching his jaw, cracking his knuckles as he waited for an answer from his absent husband. It was obvious his patience would be running out very soon. Maybe he was already searching for him out on the streets in his police car?
Looking into the man’s hungry eyes, Dean swallowed nervously. “No.”
“My husband…”
The third lash came, and Dean stifled a sob. Cold sweat broke out in the back of his neck. His hands clenched into fists at his side, but he unclenched them at once, lest Alastair saw it.
“Why not?” Her tone was gentle. Nice. It was … too much.
His eyes lit up at once. How nice of her to ask. He typed a reply immediately.
“Could you please open your mouth for me?” he asked after he had put away the washcloth. “I need to check your teeth.”
thoughts of suicide/self-harm
He bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from talking – he couldn’t stand speaking about this mess, less alone hear his pathetic whiny voice, when Charlie grabbed both his hands with hers, ducking her head so as to make eye contact with him.
He calmed down again at once and blushed. “Yes.”

She led him into the staff room where they sat down with two cups of coffee. It was still early, and the first patients would arrive in an hour, so they had some time to talk. He told her about his move and the nice time he had spent with his mother and Gabriel. She told him about the patients who had appointments today and about the general going-ons of the practice. He realized quickly she was easy to talk to and he was happy to have her as his practice partner. She was a calm person with an air of competence and empathy about her – he was looking forward to learning from her about dealing with sick animals as well as their worried owners.
“After you left I could barely keep myself together, “he rambled, keeping Dean firmly against his body, his heart pounding in his chest. “I was so worried that he would hurt you again, kill you even, but I couldn’t do anything. Jesus, Dean. I was so so scared for you. I could barely stand it, not knowing how you were.”
Dean’s shoulder twitched in a seemingly unminding shrug, but Castiel knew better. He saw the fear in Dean’s eyes as he leaned forward so that they were only inches apart. He ignored the shot of adrenaline surging through his blood as he took in the scent of the other man: a hint of motor oil, with something more real underneath: something earthy but also sweet and fresh, the sun warming weeping leaves, heavy with water after a summer rain, the very essence of the man in front of him. He tried to ignore the faint coppery smell of blood that also weaved into the mixed scents coming from Dean, and he hastily banished all thoughts of smells as he held up a finger.
For a second, he considered just waiting it out, because he was in no mood for a neighborly chit-chat with Mrs. Tran or Jodie Mills. Even Charlie would not be a welcome sight right now. He just wanted to stay alone this evening and he wouldn’t do anybody a favor trying to engage in an interesting conversation in this mood anyhow.
But Castiel was lucky. Dean didn’t leave at once, he apparently turned and went back inside his classroom, maybe to gather his things. This was his chance to just sneak past the door and leave, leave Dean alone and get over this thing.
“Yes, but I need to get inside the house now, “Dean said, his patience worn thin and he tried to sidestep Cain again, determined to leave this impossible man and his rude come-ons behind him.
Dean beckoned to Castiel to follow him and walked down the hallway quickly until they reached a back door, exiting the music school. Castiel felt excitement bubbling up in his chest about this surprising development – maybe he would finally get some answers concerning Dean’s behaviour of the past few weeks? All the same he was nervous, too. His heart pounded in his chest as he followed Dean onto a winding little path leading indeed into a forest right behind the school.
So, it's been a while. I wanted to continue writing this so much, but my health wasn't the best lately and I just couldn't find the time or energy. I hope this makes up for it.
Her eyes twinkled as she fixed him with a curious glance. “Seems like it. Seems like you’re a very special person indeed.” Her tone was suggestive, and his face fell as he shifted uncomfortably under her gaze, unsure what she meant.
*:  Yes, I know, Dean is really going through a lot :( How about some overdue comfort in the next chapter? :)
“Well, Castiel, that’s awesome, right?” Charlie said with a smile, “what could be the problem then?”
“It’s wasn’t wrong, “Castiel said with conviction. “And it was real, Dean. It is very real. I want you to believe me. I
He really was a damn fool. How could it be that he was always always getting himself in such situations? Alastair was right, he should have not encouraged that man to flirt with him.
They exchanged numbers and Castiel left with a happy heart and a few cookies less in his basket.
Alastair’s hand gestured towards the small path leading towards home and Dean nodded. They set out at a moderate pace, walking next to each other quietly. Dean’s stomach was still churning with anxiety and he desperately wanted to say something, to ease the tension between them that they both were aware of. He wasn’t sure if Alastair was waiting for him to say something, if it were wiser to just stay quiet for now, keep his head low until he knew more of his husband’s current mindset so that he could adjust accordingly.
Still feeling a little uncertain, Dean stepped up the front door and raised his hand to ring the doorbell. However, the door was suddenly yanked open before he could even ring it.
The images in his head were clear as day to him and it made his heart swell in helpless longing, so much that it was almost unbearable.
“Hey, Charlie. No, all the hamsters were quite nice today, thank you.” He grinned at her and she chuckled.
Castiel heard Dean chuckle lightly behind the other side of the door. “Of course, you are. You’re more than ready and I really think you should apply at Oregon University. You’ll pass their exam with no problems, I’m sure.”
“Dean, are you with me?” A short little bite into his lower lip reminded him to stay in the here and now.
“Yes, Shosh, I know. I know.” He sighed.
“And you’re ready to take your punishment as I see fit? Not to defend yourself or to try to get away?”
When he was finished, he looked at his watch: it was only 9 o’clock, he still had a lot of time until his first lesson at 1 pm. He decided to prepare the meal for tonight’s dinner, then he would work out. He prepared a lasagna and put it into the oven to heat it up later. Then he went into their work out room. He stepped on the treadmill and ran for forty-five minutes, afterwards he took a long shower. But no matter what he did, he couldn’t really concentrate on the task. As he stood under the hard spray of water he leaned against the tiles and tried to block out the constant thoughts of Castiel. To distract himself, he focussed on the pain in his back. The water caused him even more pain and he actually had to bite the inside of his cheek to bear it – but it did the job and he managed to get through the shower without going insane.
Castiel continued to prod various points on his chest and stomach and Dean sometimes acknowledged the pain, sometimes he just shook his head.
“He asked for directions and I showed him the way, that was all. I didn’t say anything!”
“No, you’re far too soft for that.” Alastair’s long fingers reached forward and trailed down the side of Dean’s face. Then his thumb pushed between Dean's lips and let it linger there in the open space for a moment. “You’re too sweet-natured, Dean, you’re not capable of teaching someone to fight. You wouldn’t even be able to defend yourself if you were attacked.”
Keeping his eyes fixed on Dean, he made his way over to the fridge, opened the freezer, and took out two cold compresses, adding them to his pile of utilities in his arms. Slow in his movements, careful not to frighten Dean, Castiel sat back down on the couch, laying his stuff on the coffee table next to them.
Dean closed his eyes as he fought the rising panic threatening to make him hyperventilate,  threatening to turn into a full-blown panic attack. He needed to get a hold of himself, now! If he didn’t, Castiel would wake up and he needed to avoid that at all costs.
“Come on, baby, let’s get home. It’s getting cold.”
She stroked over the gauze on his hand. “Seriously, Castiel. I thought you were a big old softie but now it seems you’re quite the badass. I’m impressed.” She looked up at him with a smirk on her face, obviously trying to make him laugh and his lips curled upwards automatically, grateful that she was making such an effort.
It simply said:
“Oh yes, “Dean answered. “I love taking long walks by myself and I’ve explored the area very quickly. It’s beautiful around here, but there are always a lot of people here and I, “he blushed a little, “well I prefer to have a lot of quiet time so I searched around for a few places where I could be by myself.”
Dean opened his mouth, still staring at Castiel with wide eyes. A strangled sound escaped him as if he wanted to speak, and he quickly closed his mouth again, looking confused as he struggled with his words.
He groaned as he stumbled to the bathroom to relieve himself. Afterwards he quickly thought of taking a shower like always in the morning. But he didn’t feel like it and he wouldn’t be leaving the house today anyway, so he skipped it and made his way downwards in his PJs. The clock in his kitchen told him it was 8 am.
Castiel swiftly shut the door closed before Dean could leave, prompting Dean to shake his head in visible frustration, his hands clenching at his sides.
His mood lifted with every day he went to work to the point where he thought that he could get over the fact that he was unhappy. He thought of Castiel every day, every morning that he awoke, and every evening when he went to bed after having sex with Alastair. He had given up on trying to push Castiel out of his thoughts. Apparently, it was impossible.
“Cas, I-I’m so sorry, I should have contacted you. But you know, we didn’t know if we could come because Alastair has to work a lot on weekends at the moment and we didn’t want to say we would come without knowing completely. As it turns out, he actually has to work tonight, but I thought it’s such a lovely evening and all our neighbours are here and you know, I-I thought I’d stop by…”
**********************************************************************************
Tears were glistening in his big green eyes and Castiel’s heart clenched at the sight of it. He reached out and gingerly pressed his thumb underneath his eye, wiping the unshed tears away.
“Bye, Cas.”
It made him want to take a knife and cut himself, see the blood welling up until it ran down his arms, dark red drops of life falling unto the ground, staining everything forever.
He held his breath, as he waited for Dean to react. At long last, Dean nodded and padded through the open door. Castiel closed the door behind him and almost immediately had to pull an impatient Shoshanna away from Dean. His little lady had recognized Dean of course, and she was desperate for his attention. She was circling him excitedly, waiting for him to greet and pet her. But Dean was not in the right headspace, because he just stood there, his eyes still downcast as he waited for Castiel to deal with him.
“Okay.” Castiel’s hand wandered down Dean’s arm and lingered over the soft exposed flesh of his stomach. He wanted to glide his hands over the bruised skin of Dean’s body, erase the pain and hurt inflicted there, the testimony of a relationship gone wrong indented into the flesh. He felt the need to overwrite it with comfort, empathy, and tenderness. All these things Dean deserved so much and yet, they were denied to him. The only kind of affection he received when his husband deigned to offer it to him, mostly when he was in a good mood.
