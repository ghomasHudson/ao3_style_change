Sam walked inside to inspect the scene and the severed head in the corner. “Looks like we didn’t get all of them.”
“Cas” He whispered, begging, he didn’t know for what, just begging, for something. Anything.
Cas shrugged and went back to eating. Dean bit into another forkf full and stared at Cas in between, trying to down it quickly to bring up his question.
Dean almost asked him to stop but didn’t have something to say. Not something that wasn’t weird anyway.
Sam approached the table. “Wait…’you’ made breakfast?”
Cas rolled his hips harder, Dean yelled his name again, the sound sending Cas over. He held Dean tightly, emptying himself inside him while Dean finished over his hand. In the end, they weren’t sure who came first, but they were both out of breath, Cas’s weight over Dean’s, pinning him to the table. Dean looked back at him, mouth slightly hanging open, eyes dark with pleasure.
Dean turned to Cas when a masked figure leapt at him from under the table and grabbed him in a chokehold. He shoved his face at Dean’s neck smirking and baring his teeth. Cas launched himself at the vampire before he had a chance to hurt Dean and bashed his head against the table.
“Yes—Yes, I am starving.” She answered, the smirk on her face as she left though did not look like it was about food.
“Oh” Cas did. “Where is Sam?”
“Cas you’re…back” Sam stated convincing himself along with acknowledging it. He rushed up to Castiel and hugged him.
“Tough vamp huh?” He commented.
“So, did she… love me?”
Meanwhile, with the other hand, he traced the side of Dean's face, closely ghosting up to his forehead and planted a small kiss there.  It was an alien feeling embedded into a familiar one. Like his heart racing even as he simply looked at Cas. Or the euphoria he felt at being touched although he had been a million times before. Or the way Cas was relaxing his walls while he just lay there, compliant, and yet it felt good.
Cas leapt off him, collecting Deans clothes and throwing them at it. Dean sprung up and pulled them back on, staring horrified at the door. Cas tucked himself back in, wiped his hand over the vampires jacket where it wasn't soaking in blood and gritted his teach at the mess. He tried to look as composed as could manage.
“Oh, you are enjoying yourself, aren’t you Dean?” Cas asked, no sign of rush in his voice.
“No!” Dean exclaimed. “I…You don’t always have to be a solider of the heaven Cas, we are free now, can’t we just have little ‘social’ meet up just because we want to?”
“Cas…Cas…
Dean nodded almost frantically, never moving an inch away from where Cas had placed him.
Dean’s cheeks were glowing read, lips pursed together to hide a smile. “Thank god for vampires.” He grinned.
“Are you alright?” Cas asked, leaning close.
And they
Castiel loved them. Him and Sam.
Dean grimaced. “Yes Cas, we are having normal breakfast because everything is fine now, remember?” He went to the table. “Sit”
“Yes”
“No Dean it will be fine” Sam assured his brother, smiling at his typical behavior.
“Oh Dean” Cas kissed the side of his neck, nibbling very gently at the skin, pushing his face to side to get better access and Dean bent exactly as Cas wanted. That was all he wanted to do right now.
One of their friends had lived, and it was also someone who deserved it the most, someone he had most wished had stayed.
Cas sighed. At least they hadn’t been caught in the act.
“Did you not want me to come back, Dean?” Cas asked, ever so oblivious.
“I don’t know, why do you ask?”
And that was all Cas needed before he was desperately rocking into Dean, digging his nails in his ass.  “…Dean-” he grunted, cut short by his own movements. He needed Dean, needed him like he could start bleeding out again, like something bad was already at their doorstep.
The vampire headbutted dean and growled, fangs lengthening and eyes glowing red. Dean crawled backwards on his hands but it was gaining on him with speed, just then its head separated from the body in one neat stroke and flung to the side. Behind, Cas stood with a machete, breathing loudly.
Tears streamed down Sam’s cheeks; his face weary.
deserved better. Dean forced the little he had left in himself to not pay attention to that. He couldn’t afford to die unhappy. Not after everything. He smiled at Sammy instead, struggling to raise the corners of his lips.
The sat inside the Impala talking peacefully between gaps of comfortable silence. The evening drew in, it got colder inside the car. Sam had chosen to drive but midway Dean regretted not driving himself. He wanted to feel himself behind a wheel. And he also wanted to distract himself from the thought that kept pestering him. He stole glances at the angel when he knew he wasn’t looking. Dean did not know to frame the question, hypothetically of course because he was never going to bring it up even if he did. It was pointless, what would Cas even think.
“Did you say that you love me?”
“Like what?”
Dean took a deep breath, looking angrily down the road. He thought back to what Bobby had said. Cas had helped fix Heaven. Dean had assumed in the moment that he had meant before, sometime, but that didn’t make sense. Heaven hated Cas, not that Dean could really blame them. They’d never let him help with anything unless Jack was the one in charge.
“Are you in love with me, Cas?”
When the Older was facing front again, Dean could see through the dim firelight that he had gone somewhat somber again. “He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me, man,” he admitted, twisting the cap off his bottle. “You need to talk to him. You have no idea how happy that would make him. You too, if you don’t wimp out.” He drank, then didn’t say anything for a second. “Do you love him?” he asked quietly, as if he was scared of the answer.
Castiel sat up a little straighter in his chair, somewhat surprised that he had actually snagged Dean’s attention. “When was the last time the two of us talked like this? Alone?”
“No-o!” the Older whined. “That’s cheating. Figure that out yourself. Next question.”
“Isn’t that what we just did?” Dean asked. His eyebrow quirked as he got an idea. “Or was that just the beginning of a long evening?”
“What?” he asked, as Dean only got redder with embarrassment. “I’ve always wanted you to be happy. Why would I care that you like guys? And honestly,” he added with a shrug, “the two of you are perfect.”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t talk to anyone alone these days. I got stuff to take care of. Not a whole lot of time for chit chat.” He started walking away again.
“But I should have listened when you were trying to tell me,” Dean countered. “I know nothing can change what I did to you…what I said. I can’t fix it. But I am sorry. You didn’t deserve any of it.”
Dean frowned deeper. “What the hell is with you, man? You just gonna sit in here and melt your brains into grey goo with that stuff?” He waved a hand at the worn bottle of painkillers. “What you do on your own time is none of my business, but this is getting old.”
In the same moment that a monster clamped its dead hands around Castiel’s gun, he realized that he was out of bullets.
“Cas, you don’t need to stay for me.”
“You okay?” Dean asked.
As always, Castiel heard Dean coming before he arrived. The deck creaked, and Dean pushed through the beads, calling ahead. “Finally got the bastard to settle in. He didn’t seem to want to room with Chuck; can’t imagine why.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said again.
Cas snorted, laughing at him, before continuing. “You already know that I became close to you not long after I met you. You and Sam became my friends, and I trusted you both completely. I always liked you particularly, and it was only a year or so later that I truly fell in love with you. I tried to let you know, but I didn’t know how to, and you always were so interested in women. I suppose I could have found a female vessel, but I had grown attached to mine, and I doubt you and Sam would have gotten used to me that way.”
Castiel braced his forehead in the hollow of Dean’s shoulder, and Dean’s hand came up to grasp the nape of his neck, helping him through his own last moments. With a final exclamation, Castiel finished. Shuddering, he fell onto his back next to Dean, one of his legs flung over his.
“Yeah,” Dean said, pressing himself slightly sideways against one of Castiel’s knees.
“What?”
Castiel felt a spike of fear and exhilaration. “Well in that case…”
It had been written in a moment of despair, when the angels of heaven had abandoned the Earth, and Castiel felt himself fall for certain. He wasn’t sure if the message was a sentiment to his loyalty, or a damnation of God and his holy decrees. Either way, he felt no desire to remove it from the ceiling.
“I love you,” Cas said quietly.
“I did it for you, Dean, not Sam.”
“You did?”
Dean stepped closer, leaning his shoulder into Castiel’s chest. “I didn’t. I had hopes of pushing you up against a tree and kissing you until you were desperate, and then seeing where it goes from there.”
Castiel had been privy to it a few times. There were exactly two instances in which Dean had fully wept in front of Castiel, which most certainly counted, but then there were also those tiny moments after a successful case when Dean let the light glow from his eyes and his laughter bubbled up from where he kept it locked away. Castiel knew that Dean loved him, in his own way, but before tonight he wouldn’t have thought that what they were doing now was something Dean would have wanted.
“Been better. What about you? Nurse said you didn’t want treatment.”
Dean grimaced slightly. “You’re Cas, but I don’t know you. Not really.”
“Nah. You want grub?” Dean asked, seemingly relieved not to be talking about the secret he wanted kept anymore.
“He told me you felt the same way, but I didn’t believe him,” Cas added, half-smiling. “I suppose he knows you better than you know yourself.”
Cas cocked an eyebrow at him. “About the way we feel about each other.”
Cas was looking at him again with a strange light in his eyes. He’d gone very still. “What do you mean?”
But Dean hadn’t spoken directly to him in weeks.  Castiel had been invited to this meeting, but he rarely had anything to add, and Dean refused to make eye contact with him.
Cas nodded and sat next to him, leaving quite a bit of space between them. “I know that you, especially from when you’re from, aren’t comfortable with the idea, and I’m sorry about this, but trust me, you’ll be glad I told you.” Cas looked sideways at him, judging his reaction.
Castiel wasn’t sure how to reply, knowing that Dean had already made up his mind “Hmm.”
“Yeah, not gonna lie, that was weird,” his older self agreed. “One or two, I get, but the dude had them like every week. Still does every once in a while. They’re fun, get pretty frisky.”
Dean froze awkwardly, but Castiel answered anyway.
Cas looked at him with a strange expression. Some sort of pity, maybe regret…longing? It made Dean a little uncomfortable, and he fidgeted where he stood, shuffling his feet slightly and looking off to the side, then back at him. Cas didn’t move.
“I’m leaving now,” Dean said, ignoring him.
The evening did, in fact, turn out to be quite long.
They hadn’t fixed their problems, far from it, but maybe they had taken a step in the right direction. Cas obviously seemed to still trust Dean enough to fall asleep next to him.
Cas looked a little disappointed, but he smiled anyway. “I understand.” He started to climb off of Dean, but Dean grabbed him before he could, winding his arms around his back.
They struggled to get to their feet without breaking apart, unwilling to stop kissing. Dean shrugged out of his jacket and let it drop to the floor behind him. Once his hands were free he brought them up to cup both of Castiel’s cheeks as he pressed deeper into his mouth. Castiel slid his hands under Dean’s shirt and helped him pull it over his head, then stripped off his own.
“Is it just me, or was that a long time coming?” Dean asked. “No pun intended,” he added with a childish smirk.
Dean didn’t say anything, just clenched his jaw a little and nodded, staring at the rough wood floor a few feet in front of hm. “Yeah, well—” he stammered, giving up just as soon as he tried to speak.
The door to the cabin slammed open again, and the Older scowled widely as he stomped down the steps. Seeing the question in Castiel’s face, he made his way over to him.
“Yeah, ‘fine’ my ass,” the Older grumbled, before changing the topic. “Whatever, we’ll talk about this later,” he said, stressing the last word at Cas. “I came here to say we gotta go. Bunch of Croats are camped out on the main road few miles out, screwin’ with people. Let’s go light ‘em up.”
Dean looked up at the ceiling. “Yeah, I guess for a while I wasn’t. But I think I was just ignoring it. Pushing it down, the usual. But now,” he turned his head back toward Castiel. “Who gives a fuck anymore? There’s no one left to care.”
It could have been minutes or days later when Dean realized that now he truly was awake. He was lying in a hospital bed, IV taped in his elbow and what felt like heart rate monitor sensors stuck to his chest. His whole body ached, but his stomach was strangely numb. A nurse stood at the foot of his bed, checking a clipboard.
They admired each other, embracing the moment they were sharing. Castiel hated to interrupt it, but knew that if he didn’t ask now, then it would only be ruined once Dean’s hangover fell into place in the morning.
“See? I told you he’d freak out!” He leaned into Cas’s face, looking desperate and comically panicked.
Dean twitched, eyelids fluttering, and took a small breath. It wasn’t too late then. But Castiel could see by how very pale Dean’s face had gotten they weren’t going to make it to the hospital in time. Dean was going to die here in the street with only a fallen, useless angel who he didn’t even like at his side. Essentially alone.
Dean licked his lips and eyed Castiel’s. “Whadda you think?”
“Because you were a dick.”
“Hey fellas, mind if I borrow Cas for a while?” he asked, sliding up behind Castiel’s tree stump and resting his hands on his shoulders.
Dean rolled his eyes and shoved back from the table. “I don’t have time for melodramatic crap, Cas. Go home.”
Cas frowned. “Is it because I fell? My coping habits? Because you’ve gone off on drinking sprees more times than I can count, and I haven’t kept you away. I don’t see how this is different.”
“He’s all yours,” one of them replied with a laugh.
“Woah, TMI,” Dean protested, raising his voice.
Dean rubbed his face. “Was he wearing an ugly trench coat?”
Much as he hated to do it, Dean stopped him. “I am. But not right now. I’m still…getting used to it, I guess.”
“I’ve been talking about you for over an hour,” Dean replied, still hauling him along. “I missed you.”
As he sat down, Dean murmured, “You’re gonna need a new suit.”
Dean frowned. “Hey, I thought you loved me.”
Cas turned on him, glowering. “Would you have preferred that?”
Cas nodded slightly. “That was the last of it…It’s gone now.”
“He said you’re in love with me,” Dean blurted out, unable to play it safe anymore. Fuck it, he was just going to say it all and then go die in a hole somewhere. “In the future, you and I are together. Like sleeping together. In love, whatever.” He was certain he was blushing, and refused to look at Cas.
Dean sighed and shifted slightly away. “I just told him what happened to Sam.” He ran his hands roughly through his hair, avoiding eye contact.
Still looking away, Dean answered, “Yeah, well it seems like I manage to get all my friends killed anyway, so I don’t have much of a choice, do I?”
Dean wanted to squish down the hope that exploded in his chest. Cas was in the Empty. He was dead. Dead and in a different afterlife. He was gone.
“Time for the magic of friendship,” Dean muttered.
“Not coming.” Dean grunted, swinging the strap of his weapon across his shoulders. “Let’s get the others. You and Cas’ll take the front and I’ll pick up the rear.”
Cas stared blankly for a moment, then shrugged. “It took practice.”
“The nurse also said you brought me here,” Dean prompted lamely.
Cas’s expression didn’t change. Dean sighed, exasperated. “Come on man, you’re not an idiot.”
Dean gestured in disbelief. “You’re about to collapse, man.”
Dean groaned and sat down next to him on the bed. “I don’t know why you like it so much. It’s so soap opera-y.”
Grinning inwardly at his cleverness, Dean murmured, “You know Cas, the last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.”
“Well, I should be going,” Castiel said, turning to Dean as Sam shut the door behind him.
They slept next to each other with Castiel’s thick blankets and comforter over top of them, the frigid winter night leeching away what warmth it could. They faced each other on their sides, hands clasped between them.
Dean had drunk himself into oblivion more times than he could count, given up on life completely. Life without Cas was worth nothing.
Castiel exhaled slowly. “I know you care. And that has always meant so much to me.”
“This is what you want?”
Cas rolled his eyes at him, his mouth turned down at one corner. He pushed Dean’s shoulder towards the couch on the other side of the room. “Sit, and listen to me. You can run away once I’m done.”
Castiel was sprawled in his chair around the table in the cabin they all had taken to using as a conference room. It had been nearly two years since Lucifer had taken Sam, and the  small band of survivors at Camp Chitaqua had more or less settled in to fighting this battle for the rest of their lives.
“So much for cheating,” Dean pointed out.
Dean snorted. “Then your priorities suck, man.” Dean played with the medical tape holding the IV in the crook of his elbow. “You’re a much better guy than I am. Why did you even stick around, after what I said to you?”
Cas squinted at him, looking concerned. “Dean?”
Castiel nodded. “Well done on retrieving it, by the way. But he’ll be fine. We’re hiding nothing here. It’s probably better if he knows everything, so maybe he can change it when Zachariah takes him back. Sam might not have to die,” Castiel added gently.
“Shut up. I’m serious,” Dean replied, giving Castiel a hurt frown. “I even told him about the Colt.”
“Yes. We are in love.”
Dean snorted in shock. “Yeah!”
Castiel turned his head slightly to look at the sun dancing on the wall more clearly. “What exactly could you use me for, Dean?”
“Yes Dean, I’m fine.” Cas blinked a few times to get rid of the tears, then stared at him. Even through the griminess of his face and the ratty beard, his eyes were just as deep blue as they had always been.
“Every raindrop, my ass,” Dean grumbled under his breath.
Dean leaned back onto the pillows, kicking his feet out and crossing them at the ankles. “Just saying he’s a pain in the ass. He’s nosy. Doesn’t follow orders. Stirs up trouble. You saw how he acted when I had to shoot Yaeger. Had to drag him inside and get some sense into his head.”
Dean stopped a few feet in front of him and half-turned back, face drawn with weary irritation. “What are you talking about, man?”
“No, Cas! That would not be ‘beneficial!’ That would be a goddamn nightmare! You know how I was! I would’ve freaked the fuck out!” Dean sat forward and crossed his legs, eyes wide as he stressed his next words. “I would have thrown a fit if somebody had told me I was having sex with a dude! You know I would have!”
Dean felt like he’d been slapped in the face. “So why’d you save my life?”
“I told him about us.”
He watched the love of his life stalk into the dark without looking back, shoulders tense and steps heavy. Very slowly, a creeping horror slithered around Castiel’s stomach and up the insides of his arms to his heart, before coiling around his windpipe. Horror as he considered what a man as broken and desperate as Dean might consider unforgiveable to his more-complete younger self. Something that had caused Dean to push Castiel away tonight, to bury his own blame deep within his ribcage or risk giving it, and the true plan, away to his lover, who he had sworn not to lie to again.
“I guess I was scared. I’m sorry.” Dean slid his hands from the tops of Cas’s shoulders to cradle his neck. “I’m so sorry.”
“What about us?”
They sat in silence, both lost in their thoughts. Dean realized that he actually felt kinda bad for Cas. He still wasn’t sure how his future self could possibly…but that didn’t mean that he didn’t care about his friend. Listening couldn’t hurt, and Cas was at least being sensitive enough to try not to freak him out too much.
Gritting his teeth, Castiel delved deep inside himself, summoning up every last dreg of power he could. He felt it trickling through him, so feeble, but there had to be enough to do something to help Dean. Castiel refused to think otherwise.
Of course, Castiel knew Dean was more than capable of protecting himself. He was a light sleeper, and woke from the merest touch or sound, courtesy of long years hunting. Dean was also followed into the dreamworld by truly terrible nightmares, some of which Castiel, as an angel, had seen firsthand. Despite all this, it was good to see Dean get some manner of peace, and Castiel was sure nothing would bother him tonight.
Cas looked at him over his shoulder, and Dean saw something of the old Castiel return to his eyes. Sympathy and compassion. Dean knew he didn’t deserve it anymore, not after all the shit he’d said to Cas. No friendship is strong enough to overcome that. Dean expected Cas to shun him. But right now, all he wanted was his old friend back, and he didn’t care if he sounded pathetic. Everyone has their weak moments.
“Uh, Cas, what’re you doing?”
Sam laughed and shook his head. “Yeah, okay, I’ll stop. But you,” he said, directing his attention to Dean, sitting stiffly on the bed, “need to stop acting like a teenager. I’m not your mom, I’m not going to ground you for having someone in your bed.”
The Older looked directly at him, his ever-present bitchface amplified. “I do.” He looked into the fire again, and Dean the Younger sat silently, intimidated.
And Cas had never known that side of Dean, because he’d been dead.
Suddenly unsure of himself, Dean spoke very softly.  “I’ve never let myself think about this.” The corner of his mouth twitched. “How am I supposed to know?”
Castiel snorted lightly. “I will admit, that word isn’t very good for bedroom talk.”
Dean hadn’t noticed him yet. He sat with his head in his hands, elbows braced on the table. He was holding his breath and gripping his hair so hard that it must have hurt. Castiel said nothing, and after a moment, Dean exhaled with all the despair of one who sees no more joy in life.
Castiel watched Dean drop off to sleep, remembering his days as an angel when he had no need of it himself. He had stood guard over Dean at night more times than Dean had known, and knew the softened planes of his face intimately. The tension that tortured Dean in waking was gone when he was asleep, and it was like looking at a child. Like he was something precious needing protection.
“Huh,” was Dean’s only reply. A moment passed, then, “How come Old Me is so weird around you? He acts like he doesn’t even like you.”
The tears streaking down Dean’s face were annoying, but Dean didn’t want to look away from Cas long enough to dry them, or to move his hands from his shoulders. Cas was really back. It wasn’t just Chuck fucking with him again, like with that dog. This was real.
Cas’s eyes swiveled to him. “I’m here,” he said shakily. “Good job parking.”
Castiel growled. “Which would you prefer?”
Castiel stared sickly at Dean for a moment. “You don’t have to do this.” He stepped closer and gripped Dean’s bicep urgently. “And not telling Dean because it would hurt him…that’s cruel. I thought you’d lied to do the opposite.”
“What if I just blew you right on this porch?” Dean grumbled against Castiel’s lips, moving along Castiel’s jaw and sucking hickeys into his neck.
Dean pressed his lips into a line, thinking how to say this without scaring Cas off. “Well, he’s you, right? So he knows everything about you.”
Castiel cocked his head wryly. “Buddy?”
Cas gave up, standing and settling himself on the edge of the bed. It was almost like they’d rehearsed it. Cas moved slowly so Dean had time to adjust, and kicked his legs up, laying on his stomach half on top of Dean’s chest while Dean crammed himself against the other side of the bed. Cas propped his cheek on Dean’s shoulder and draped his arm across Dean’s stomach, being careful of his bullet wound.
Sam had taken the picture. Sitting at too close a distance in the passenger seat, using a low-quality disposable camera, he had somehow managed to capture a side of his brother that was very rarely available to the public, even then. The picture was taken over six years ago now.
“I gotta make sure nobody drags behind,” Dean claimed. “We’ll need to be tight for this to work.”
Dean slumped over so he was leaning against Castiel and looked up at him. “Watch me.”
“I thought you could read my mind.”
“How come I was never invited?” he pouted, then grinned. “At least until recently.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered, “I know I’ve been a dick.”
“Yeah. Figured that if I didn’t tell him ‘till last minute, it would hit him harder. Now he knows what we’re really doing tomorrow.”
“Ugh, Cas—! I—” Dean tried and fail to express his frustration. Taking a breath, he tried again. “I don’t think it’ll go over well.”
Castiel shook his head and leaned over slightly to kiss him. “What were you saying about the other you? I assume that’s who you were talking about.”
Castiel glared at him. “Bullshit.” He tossed the duffel bag of weapons he had been carrying over to the jeep onto the dirt and propped his fists on his hips.
“Orgies,” Dean the Younger muttered.
“Yeah,” Dean said breathlessly. Good lord he was terrified. There was no reason for him to be; both the older him and older Cas had told him that this Castiel was in love. It made sense, Dean knew. He had seen the look in Cas’s eyes before. But what if he was wrong? What if he looked like a total dumbass? He couldn’t just expose himself like this! He wasn’t ready.
“Yeah?”
“Oh man, I’m sorry.”
Castiel looked down at Dean, and was relieved to see that Dean was breathing a little more steadily. Dean’s eyes opened briefly, and Castiel thought he might have whispered Castiel’s name.
“What?” Cas asked in annoyance, hauling himself to his feet and going to stand next to him, “he’s still you. Diamond in the rough.”
Cas looked at him in confusion, either too tired or too Castiel to figure out what Dean was suggesting.
“You’re alone?” Dean asked, saddened. Cas needed a friend now more than anything.
“Nuthin’. Don’t worry about it.”
“I think I need to sleep,” Cas muttered.
Dean just laughed and thanked him.
“No, I’ve just never been terrified of my sexuality,” Sam responded, moving into the kitchenette to drop off the bags he was holding. He turned around, leaning against the counter, obviously thinking that this whole situation was hilarious. Dean glared at him, and this only made Sam giggle like a child.
Dean smiled softly. “I love you, Cas.”
They leaned into each other, bridging the gap of a few inches until they were kissing, chastely at first, and then more desperately with each moment that passed. Castiel’s arm slipped upward until Dean’s neck rested in the crook of his elbow, and Castiel pulled him closer, his other hand going to cup Dean’s face.
Castiel tried to smile, but it came out more as a grimace. Dean frowned, and Castiel hauled himself to his feet, dragging Dean once again onto his back. Castiel took a few faltering steps. Dean was heavier than ever, but at least Castiel had staved off the reaper for a little while longer. Cheating death was the oldest trick in the Winchester book. All Castiel could do was keep going.
[May, 2011. Camp Chitaqua]
Dean’s voice carried, and the few people getting ready for the raid stopped and stared. Dean glowered at them, then exhaled heavily, the anger draining out of him and leaving only exhaustion. “He needs to say yes to Michael. Zach’s gonna take him back, and then he can do what I was too stupid to.”
Since falling, Castiel had become no stranger to sexual intimacy, but this was different. He had always treasured each and every lover, sometimes more than one at a time, and hoped the best for them in the world after, but he had never felt the life in his body flush open the way it did now.
“About what?” Dean asked, getting frustrated with Cas’s edging around.
“Yes,” Castiel responded just as bluntly.
“No.”
In the passenger seat, Cas’s eyes were wide, and he clutched the back of the seat with one hand and the door with the other. He was panting slightly, completely frozen in his seat.
Dean tried again. “I don’t…you and I…”
“I told him what I told you,” Cas cut in.
Dean didn’t wait for any further permission, gently tugging Castiel to his feet and kissing the side of his jaw before leading him away by the hand.
“Yeah,” Dean retorted, “And it almost killed you.”
“When you…said you loved me…you said it like it was something I wouldn’t want to hear. I’m sorry for that.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, but agreed nonetheless. They left the cabin, parting at the door, and as Castiel walked back to his own cabin, he wondered if Dean intended on keeping his promise.
Dean, startled out of drowsiness, jumped onto his elbow, accidentally kicking Cas in the process. “Sam! Jesus man, what the hell?” he shouted, mortified at being discovered and terrified of what his brother would think.
Dean swallowed. Castiel thought he would answer, but as he turned away for the last time, the guilt in his eyes was enough for Castiel to suspect.
Dean looked up at him again and pouted. “Probably.”
“Hello Fearless Leader,” Castiel purred, prompting some knowing chuckles from the others.
Castiel smiled softly. “Well then, why don’t we go inside and make up for that lost time? In a normal, non-pornographic way.”
The only sounds were the voices of the other hunters around their campfires, laughing and shouting, until Castiel whispered, “Do you really think he’ll talk to the other me?”
A silence grew between them, heavy with the weight of what Cas had said before the Empty had taken him. Dean wanted to say something. He needed to make it right, to let Cas know that it was okay. He’d tell him that there wasn’t going to be any awkwardness between them, that they were still friends, that Dean wouldn’t think differently of him…
Dean the Older made a face. “I don’t have to tell you anything. If you want it to happen you’ll figure it out.”
And so as the human race either died out or was infected by the virus, Castiel’s own drive vanished. The narcotics became a balm to a world that grated against his skin like sandpaper, leaving him temporarily at peace between doses.
That was true. Every time the two of them had gotten close, Dean had backed away. He’d been afraid. Of what, he wasn’t sure. Judgement, maybe? His dead father. Too many years of denying his thoughts and feelings; it had become natural.
Castiel chuckled. “If you keep that up, then you will be as drunk as I think you are.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And then there was Jack, wherever he was. Dean couldn’t fathom that he’d simply…left.
“Dean, wait!” Castiel cried, following. “What are you really planning? We aren’t just walking into a hotzone, are we!”
How wrong it had all gone. Good intentions had meant nothing, in the end.
“We’ve taken care of the gunshot wound. I would suggest lying as still as you can,” the nurse suggested, hanging the clipboard on the end of the bed.
Risa gaped as Dean walked away without another word. Castiel followed him so she wouldn’t have a further chance to object.
Dean shrugged self-consciously. “I guess.” He tugged at his sleeve cuff, playing with the button holding it closed. “I guess I’ve never really treated you like any of my other friends. You’re different.”
Castiel was sitting on a chopped tree stump listening to his companions talk. The conversation had taken a turn for the nostalgic. They all remembered vividly the days before Armageddon, and they all missed them desperately. Castiel could relate. He’d had wings and a sense of real purpose. Both were gone these days. Hunting Lucifer had been nigh impossible, and now that they had found him, the idea of killing Sam made Castiel’s skin crawl. Lately Dean had had little objection to it, and that was more terrifying to Castiel than Lucifer had ever been.
"I'll be here, Bobby."
John looked taken aback. "I'm not asking for handouts, Dean. But surely you'll take care of me and Sammy? You wouldn't want your brother to lack for anything, would you?"
In the evening, after Dean made dinner and both his father and his brother cleared out their plates, Dean washed up and tidied the kitchen and the living room before going upstairs and knocking on his brother's door.
A half an hour later, after John signed all the appropriate papers and Cas paid the admittance fee at the facility he had researched, it was time to part.
“I’s dinnint-”
“It’s more frequent than that,” Castiel countered in that same maddeningly even tone. “According to Dr Shwarz, on average, 510 children who are five years or younger ingest gasoline-”
Castiel entered the house, shedding his trench coat and putting down his briefcase. “Sweetheart? I’m home!” he called out, reminiscent of an old television sitcom. “I can’t even tell you how long today was. I had a curious…” he trailed off as he finally noticed Dean.
His dad continued, "So did you see him?"
Dean chuckled, again ruffling Sam’s hair affectionately. “Now there’s the brother I know and love.”
you want to talk about?"
The other man shrugged. "It's okay; you still have it worse than me, man."
Sam bit his lip. "Will I ever see you again?"
Later that night, after slipping quietly into the house as not to wake up Sammy, they talked a bit more about the rehab center and what it meant for John. It was nearing one o’clock at night when Dean and Castiel finally retired to their room, and the tired omega started crying as soon as he got on the bed.
“Shit,” Gabe muttered, holding up the newspaper as a barrier between him and Meg.
Your BBOF (bestest best omega friend) Gabe
Dean didn't think it would do him any good to mention that Sam had been worried he would never see him again, that he still was and it was making Dean a little bit nervous.
Dean mumbled something unintelligible, stuffing his mouth full of a tuna salad sandwich that he had prepared for himself that morning in Castiel’s big pristine kitchen. It was probably just his imagination, but the damned thing tasted better than it ever had before.
"I just thought you would be more angry or something. I mean, my dad has been bothering you for weeks."
Dean chuckled joylessly. "He figured I'd give him all the money he wanted now that we're mated. I mean, how selfish is that? He drinks away most of his salary every single month and now he wants handouts?"
For just a second he imagined what it would be like, the feeling of Cas' lips touching his chest or thighs, his tongue licking down his spine. He imagined Cas slowly making love to him, slipping into him and rocking them together and he could feel a bead of sweat running down the back of his neck at the fantasy.
"Huh," he commented.
Castiel didn't manage to hide his confusion. "I do not think I understand."
“Shh,” Charlie hissed. “Don’t give them ideas.”
Castiel continued in his politically coached voice, "It is proving not to be enough though, and many hospitals are either understaffed or underequipped. We think this is easily remediable by having people pay small fees whenever they go to the doctor's office, which sends the money directly to the hospitals and free clinics." He paused to look at Dean intently. "I find the system better than raising the taxes on the rich again and have politicians redistribute the money into their own pockets before leaving anything for the health resort. If the money goes directly to the hospitals, people will get better care."
Castiel asked in a light-hearted, teasing tone, “What about Aaron and Noah?”
Oh God. He’d forgotten the cutlery. Thinking quickly, Dean joked, “I thought we’d just drink the soup.”
He found out that until six years ago, in some states an alpha had been allowed to mate with more than just one omega, one of those states unsurprisingly Texas. He also read about how unmated omegas couldn't receive child benefits up until two years ago and how they still got less money than the mated ones even now. There was no such limit for single alpha or even beta parents.
Castiel seemed hesitant. "That's nice"
“What are we having to drink?” Cas wanted to know.
Megan knocked back a cup of black coffee in three gulps, immediately pouring another one. “Simply declaring that you aren’t an alcoholic obviously isn’t enough,” she mused, nibbling at a piece of biscotti.
At least that had cured him of his blues, Dean thought as he fell asleep later that night, a smile on his lips. An
“Should I make a statement to the press anyway?” Dean wondered.
The man took it, putting his hands in his trouser pockets nervously. "Yeah, listen. I was wondering if I could maybe repay you for your generosity?"
Dean's heart was beating fast and hard in his chest. "What do you mean, Dad?"
Dean thought quickly and hard. "Well, it's mostly going to be omegas, but there will be a few alphas there that would make a good potential mate from what I could tell."
"It? Don't call the poor lady
John made a fluttering gesture with his hand. "I'm asking if you feel he deserves some sort of compensation for his time."
Dean sighed. “It’s my dad,” he admitted; “he’s asking for money.”
Dean turned off the radio, feeling bitter. It wasn't really much of a surprise after Castiel had explained what was going to happen if the Senate went through with the referendum, but it still sucked that people voted
Dean didn't say anything as he felt his lover trailing kisses down his shoulder and over to his pectorals, avoiding his nipples and concentrating on his sternum instead. As he was going further and further down, Dean was becoming more and more aroused as well as more and more nervous. He was so not ready for this.
"I don't feel pressured," he lied. "I want you," he told the truth.
“What?”
"Jerk."
Castiel let out a warm chuckle. "No, not really. Except of course, the foreplay comes first."
hard to resist using that particular nickname.
A somewhat mollified Dean grunted in acceptance of the apology. “Cas really does care about me as well as Sammy. He says Sam can live with us indefinitely.”
The omega shrugged sadly. “I only realised myself recently. It’s getting worse faster and faster though.”
Dean frowned. "But omegas were kept as sex slaves during the Dark Ages; I never read anything about betas being treated like that."
"There you have it then. I bet you a hundred bucks that nearly every alpha out there has thought at least once about how good that commercial alpha must feel."
"What's wrong, Dad?" he asked John, who had been the one to yell his name.
“It’s normal to have coaching when you enter the world of politics,” Castiel stated, stroking Dean’s back soothingly. “I needed some when I first started, and I still sometimes consult with Meg. I don’t know anyone at work who’s never used a political coach, in fact.”
"Something healthy to alleviate the sugar and fat poisoning we're sure to have after tonight," he had said when asked.
His name stated in that disappointed tone got through to Noah. “Pwomiss, Gumpy,” he conceded.
What the... What the fudge was a mating pill? They didn't mention that at school at all. Dean was about to research it, when he realized that instead of wasting long minutes reading articles and Wikipedia pages, he could just ask. He texted Charlie a simple, "
"Hmm?"
Dean had a hard time finding his words. "I was, uh, just wondering if you would let me see him."
"Ha hasn't even texted me," he muttered.
She wanted to but I didn't feel ready. We were both barely eighteen.
“On it,” Dean’s brother-in-law responded with alacrity, bustling over to the coffee machine and getting a filter and grounds out of the cupboard.
Dean laughed. "Yeah. I mean, he's a really good guy and all but sometimes he just says or does something so pigheaded and I am once again reminded that he's a senator first and foremost. Just recently he told me he was planning on reducing the alpha's welfare to equal ours and I don't really know how to feel about that."
"Yeah, the senator you're crushing on."
"Come?"
“Huh.” John shrugged. “Guess I can’t let you down then, not if you think I’m a decent alpha, son.” After a brief pause, he requested, “Let me purchase the car with you? I’d like it to be a gift from me as well.”
"Hi."
The redhead rolled her eyes. “You’ve already stuffed a blueberry one down your gullet, Gabe, and the scone that’s in your hand - missing a bite - looks like a cinnamon apple one.”
The alpha growled deeply, his eyes narrowing and acquiring a predatory quality to them. "Never mind," he grunted, "you're ready."
Dean went to sit by his mate, cuddling into his side. “I’m sorry to hear that. My day wasn’t exactly raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens either.” At Cas’ raised eyebrows, he continued, “I went to see my dad.”
“Get out of the house. Right now,” Dean ordered, “and wait for us out front. Hide if he comes looking for you, you hear?”
The omega nodded absentmindedly. It was nice of Castiel to offer but he wasn’t sure it would even be necessary. He couldn’t imagine a scenario in which John agreed to go and get sober, no matter how much money he promised him. He was worried that as soon as his father got hold of a few bucks, he was going to buy a bottle of whiskey and neck it.
Dean had never before met two omegas in a relationship with each other, and he was more than curious about it but he told himself in was none of his business. He sent Charlie a reply, saying he would be there, before closing the laptop and flopping onto his bed.
A bit shorter than usual this time, we hope you don't mind.
The main idea of their article was that while arguments were destructive, disagreements and discussions were actually useful for the development of a person's opinion and a good analysis of facts, making them a healthy addition to a relationship.
"But how?" Dean had heard about forced mating bites but they were no longer recognized by law as a sign of a real mating, so he figured the days of forced marriage were over. The teachers in school also told them that there were ways - like medication or surgery - in which you could get rid of the bite, though it was a bit uncomfortable.
Gabriel snorted. “Right. Because everyone’s ideal mate is an omega who’s on the verge of infertility,” he commented bitterly.
"Like family," was the quiet answer.
Dean squeezed his hand. "You like them?"
The omega wrenched himself from underneath Castiel's arm, standing up. "Well I'm not giving him money just because he's family. That's not good enough for me."
Dean grinned. "Really?"
Dean turned tear-filled eyes to Cas and asked, “Do you think he’s hurt himself?”
The search spat out a website called
Before that could get his back up - ‘boy’ for some reason irritating Dean more than any of the other epithets Meg liked to throw at him - Gabe reasoned, “She’s right, Dean-o. The tabloids aren’t big on truth.” He paused for a moment, tilting his head to one side in consideration as he shuffled over to stand next to Meg and realised it was the
is fine," said Benny, flopping down on the couch next to Gilda.
“You need to become more thick-skinned,” Meg reassured him. “Things like this are common in politics. You manipulate the situation to your advantage no matter how true or untrue your information is. You think others don’t do it?”
going to be great, he was sure.
"Dean Winchester, sir."
"But how is making people pay for a doctor's visit fair? What if they can't afford it?"
Dean showed her his paper sign.
Megan shrugged nonchalantly. “The house needed replacing,” she claimed.
It was whole four hours later that Dean finally finished, because it turned out there was more structural damage done to the car than he’d previously thought and he had to do more work than he expected. He did manage it in time for lunch though, so that was something. He told Bobby the four-wheeler was ready and his boss sent a text to the owner, telling him the car was ready for a pick up.
"Yes, go on."
Dean had thought about having sex with Castiel ever since their make-out session four days ago. He thought about how his lips felt against his throat, how his hands glided down his sides or how Cas' hot breath tickled the skin of his belly. And Dean wanted a repeat performance. He wanted to feel those things again, his boiling blood rushing past his ears, his hands trembling on the buttons of the older man's shirt.
am a good mother.”
“You’ll like this bloke,” Castiel promised, guiding the omega toward a man with a distinguished appearance, who Dean was pleased to recognize from Meg’s coaching.
Rationally, Dean knew he shouldn’t let the older man’s tone of voice upset him - his husband was
Dean was at a loss for what to say. He never expected something like this to happen and he didn't know how to deal with the situation. The man was nice enough and everything but Dean wasn't really the type to accept such offers, especially since he knew it wouldn't go anywhere and he would just be messing the guy about.
The older man cleared his throat. "I wanted to ask you... Well, when you were talking about us living together after the mating, I thought... I wanted to know if you maybe wanted to come home with me?" he said hesitantly, avoiding Dean's eyes with determination. "I thought you might like to have a look about."
The grinned at each other.
Dean widened his eyes. "No! Oh God, Bobby, I didn't mean it like that. I don't really care how much you pay me as long as it's something I can add to our family piggy bank. I just really wanted to work on cars, that's all."
“I’m sure we do,” the saleswoman replied, leading Dean over to the display. “We have them in a few different colors.” Giving him a once-over,” she declared, “You’d look really good in red.”
“What- Dean- I-” Castiel spluttered, eyes hungrily taking in Dean’s form. “What are you doing?”
Castiel tilted his head. "It is forgiven, Dean," he said seriously, making Dean laugh.
For the first time since Dean had met her, Meg looked utterly discomposed. “Uh,” was all that came out of her mouth as she flailed about for a response.
“Make love to me?” Dean requested after they exchanged some more lingering kisses.
God, it seemed ages ago that Bobby had given him a trial run and then hired him, welcoming him to Singer’s Salvage Yard with a name tag that read ‘Perry’ because he hadn’t yet had a chance to get one made with Dean’s name.
"I'm dating someone," Dean blurted out, "and it's serious, so I'm, uh... I'm fine."
Castiel blinked. "That is a wonderful name, Dean. Thank you."
asked the journalist.
The omega walked over to the fridge, opening it. “Hmm,” he inquired, “how do tomato sandwiches on whole wheat bread sound? I found a vendor at the farmers’ market who sells cherry tomatoes off the vine. They taste better than candy.”
Once the toddler reached him, the omega scooped up his son and kissed him on his rosy cheeks, the boy squirming in delight and chanting, “Dadada.”
He shuddered, feeling like he was back at the hospital, one of the ER nurses - a grizzled beta - eyeing him suspiciously as she rapid-fired questions at Dean. All he’d been able to think about at the time was Aaron, who, as soon as they reached the emergency room, was quickly evaluated by one of the doctors and then whisked away to have his stomach pumped.
When the platter with small tiramisu bites walked over to them, courtesy of a bored-looking waiter, Dean decided to take one for himself too. The sweet dessert complemented the salty aftertaste of the caviar.
"Heavens no!" laughed Castiel, "but I have tried a lot of things and I can't imagine what you could possibly be willing to eat that I would have a problem with. I don't see you dragging me to try grilled cockroaches."
“Hiya, Dean,” John greeted him cheerfully if a bit wearily.
This is just a really short chapter I whipped up for you. I hope you like it :)
of energy to wear me out, trust me.”
"I know," replied the omega, "but don't you want to actually have sex?"
The alpha brushed his engorged erection against Dean’s smaller one. “Are you ready?” he asked him, sliding a curious hand down to Dean’s entrance.
Everyone else was gone for the evening, John taking the twins and Sammy to the old house. Aaron and Noah were super excited since they thought of a visit to Gumpy’s house as a big adventure. Dean chuckled fondly as he recalled the chatter about building a fort in the living room, with both John and Sammy encouraging the little rascals.
Dean’s jaw dropped. Megan had gone to pick up Bobby too? It made sense, he allowed. It was just so unexpected…
Megan smirked at Dean. “It serves you and the tree topper right, ending up with imps of Satan who play with f-i-r-e.”
He whined loudly, his ass coming high off the bed, when he felt his lover's fingers brush against a specific spot inside him. "Oh wow."
And we finally get to the smut!
“Enough wallowing, pet.” The crisp voice was accompanied by a staccato tapping of heels. “You’re no longer a mardy teenager.”
"That's not true," Dean said indignantly; "some of them are really good people. I bet if you met Castiel you would change your mind."
“Call your dad while I’m here,” Meg urged, “and let him know what we’ve agreed on - that someone found out he was at the clinic and that he should be ready for the fallout. Oh, and that he shouldn’t talk to any journalists.”
"A politician?"
The omega rolled his eyes, wiggling in Castiel's embrace and earning himself another pat on the butt. "Of course not, but I wasn't really nice about it. And then I felt so bad about everything that I just packed my bags and left."
After handing the coach her cuppa, the omega took the seat next to her. He braced himself, looking directly at the woman. “I’m sorry for the way I behaved yesterday,” he apologised. “You were only doing your job, so I shouldn’t have thrown a hissy fit. It won’t happen again.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. "You sound almost offended, Cas. The nerve of some people, huh? To think we're all equal."
Dean put his hands on his hips. "Yeah I know, but how you can listen to such a sexist song, I don't know."
He felt Castiel smile against the skin of his cheek.
“We should go,” Castiel told him quietly. “You wouldn’t be able to enjoy the rest of our evening anyway with this hanging over our heads.”
Dean shrugged. "We only have the one car and Dad says it should go to the alpha since he would be the one to take care of his future family, while I am going to find someone to take care of me."
“Well” Cas went back to eating. “She rebelled first and then lost her grace so no, not everything.”
“Right, I know it’s been hard.” Cas addressed both of them. “But its fine now. Everything is okay” He was genuinely happy they could say that now.
“I love you Dean” Cas pulled him close, arm around the small of his back and Dean’s heart thumped loudly in his ears, almost drowning Cas out.
“No-no…” Dean rushed to explain. “I thought I was going to die Cas. I am still—processing it all”
And while Dean was flooding with emotions, he missed this about Cas, this and everything else. He went for a hug and Cas embraced him. Dean sighed in relief and once assured that he wasn’t holding on to life, he was simply holding Cas.
Fine, he had thought about this before, tried to spend more time with Cas, interact with him butthis was never what he had in mind. What was he doing? Three stupid
“You want to know if I have ever cared for someone so much, I gave them all my life, over and over again, just in the hope that they will be happy one day? You want to know if I did it all because that’s what angels do or I am really in love with you?” He moved closer to Dean and pulled him up by the arm like he was weightless to him.
“What is that smell?” Sam asked entering the kitchen. Damn it. Could he not wake up late this one time?
Dean wanted to roll his eyes at that. “He is asleep, will probably be up late.”
to go”
The headless body dropped to the ground with a thud, followed by the clanking of the blade. Dean simply sat there supported by his arms, breathing loudly, bulging eyes looking up at the angel.
He tugged at himself, letting Cas’s weight alone, keep him standing. “Uh…uh”
“Oh well, is there something you want to talk about?” Cas asked helpfully, trying to ease them into the conversation as if it was something to worry about. Like usual.
Dean had loosely dawned everything, still looking disheveled, hair sticking everywhere. He patted them down and much as he could and quickly snatched his hand back when the door opened.
Cas smiled and leaned down to kiss him again. This was perfect. It should have always been like this. Dean was so glad he had chalked up the courage to bring his question up the angel. But they didn’t have too long to dwell on the moment because Sam was pulling up in the driveway.
And it was just him and Cas again. Dean went back to eating methodically, disregarding different line of approaches he considered taking.
Shit. Dean grimaced and got of the table. The fact that he was on it at all was pretty difficult to explain.
‘I love you Dean’ His brain reminded the words to him, admonishing him for overstepping now that he had heard Cas say them. He moved back somewhat awkwardly. He eyes pointed to the floor, avoiding Cas until the thought went away. “So…Jack?”
Dean moaned through his shallow breathing, hands travelling back to hold the table on his sides, this way he could push himself up easier.  Cas let him, doing his own thing with fingers, he slowly swirled around the rim of his hole, deepening further and further until he could move them in and out of Dean.
“With pleasure,” Castiel replied, tugging the younger man up from the couch and following him to their bedroom.
“Why don’t you wait out here while
Dean couldn't help himself and surged forward to plant a wet kiss on Castiel's face. "You're a nerd, Cas," he said, "but it's kind of hot. I'm sorry I offended the piranhas."
"You done?" asked his boss, handing him a sandwich.
“Did you get a copy of the report?” Meg immediately asked as Gabe carried a full pot of coffee over to the table, plunking the carafe down on a pot holder in the middle of the table. Gabe then flopped down gracelessly onto the free chair to Dean’s right, wiping a hand across his brow as if he’d just performed heavy labour.
Dean leaned forward, licking his spoon. "See, smoking is good. Smoking is something in which we're all equal. We all fall under the same restriction laws and we all can get cancer."
Dean glanced down, surprised to see that the redhead was correct. He honestly thought that he’d taken no more than a sip of the tea. His body must need the hydration even more than he’d expected. “Sure,” he replied, nudging the cup and saucer toward Charlie.
"Okay," he whispered back, feeling Castiel's hand sliding up his arm until it rested at the back of his neck lightly, not exerting any sort of pressure, just steadying him.
It was weird to watch his dad's face go from absolutely furious to mildly confused to hesitantly happy. "You slept at his house?"
The omega shrugged, no longer bothered by the accusations that had been thrown at him, Castiel and his dad. The newspaper had printed an amendment to the accusatory article the day after his friends’ intervention - a retraction, really - and then, a couple days later, there was a fresh scandal. A famous beta actor had left his spouse, who’d apparently been cheating on him for years, for an omega. The actor had refused to comment, other than to say that he didn’t care about having children together; he just wanted to be with the person he loved.
Castiel continued to protest, moving up one step higher on the stairs and out of Dean’s reach. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. What’s gotten into you tonight?”
Cas seemed to be as tired as Dean, because he responded without hesitation. “I could ask you the same question.”
“You didn’t tell me Sam knew!” Dean demanded, turning on Cas.
His eyes were locked on the road, curving yet again. He couldn’t bear to look away, both for fear of crashing and of being disappointed.
Cas’s head jerked up. “What? That’s not what I meant. I—” Cas cut himself off, shoulders slumping a little. “I would never let you die. Never. You were once the most important thing to me, and no matter what you do, you can’t change that.”
He was almost tempted, just to see, but too many years of real life on earth kept him from it. Instead, he leaned into yet another curve.
Sure, he was dead—impaled on a damn piece of rebar, of all things—but at least that meant that he wasn’t responsible for saving the world anymore. And now with Chuck gone…the world might not need saving ever again.
Castiel wished more than ever that he still had his wings. Even if his power to heal was all but gone, if only he’d had his wings.
“I’ll drink to that,” Dean said, doing so.
When they arrived, Dean slammed his car door harder than necessary, echoing painfully in the natural silence of snow, causing the others to close theirs more quietly. The other residents of the camp came forward, inquiring about Rachael. The look on Dean’s face told them all they needed to know.
After a moment, Cas took Dean’s other hand, interlacing their fingers. Dean wrapped his free arm around Cas, so they were both holding each other. Cas’s eyes were already closed, but Dean knew he wasn’t asleep yet.
“Cas. Next?”
13 Hours Before The End]
Dean pressed forward until they were falling gently to the floor, Castiel bracketed securely between his elbows. A myriad of emotions ambushed Castiel. Everything he had submerged for years, things he had thought would never be relevant, exploding to the surface with each caress of Dean’s tongue and the sweet touch of his hands. Castiel rested his hands lightly on Dean’s waist, then slipped them up the back of his shirt, pressing his fingertips into his skin, kissing him like he had never kissed anyone else.
“None of the good stuff.”
“No,” Dean cut him off. “Listen. You’re what, several billion years old?”
A corner of Dean’s mouth tugged down with distaste. Castiel took this as an invitation to keep going. He stood up for emphasis.
“About what?”
A few minutes later, the sweat was cooling on Castiel’s body and he had recovered enough strength to untie Dean. Castiel watched as Dean rubbed the blood back into his arms, pressing deep into his deltoids. It was just erotic enough to keep him interested without getting overly aroused again so soon.
Step after step on the gravel road, closer to town every moment but still so far away. Castiel prayed for a car to come by, but there were none. Castiel just had to keep walking, keep going, so Dean would live.
“I don’t know either. I was lucky, I didn’t have to say anything. But as long as you tell him the truth, and don’t try to play it off, it’ll be fine. From what my Cas tells me, he was pretty desperate for anything from me back then, so I don’t think you can really go wrong.”
Younger Dean sighed, slumping a little farther into his chair. “I guess so. I’d do anything for him. Care about him just as much as Sam. I guess,” he added tentatively, “the idea of kissing him doesn’t suck. Pretty nice, actually. But I’m not there yet with sex.”
Dean swallowed heavily. Now or never. “I’m sorry I let you think that I didn’t care.”
Castiel knew he was trying to guilt him into doing some manner of work, but Castiel was tired of exerting himself to no end for so little gain. Lifting things required more muscle than he had, and he didn’t have the brains for any strategic planning anymore. Once, he had been the smartest and most worldly person in the room, but no one wanted to hear Castiel’s stories of Creation, or, contrastingly, his newfound fascination with honeybees. Now that he was human, he had no place in the world.
Now it was Dean the Older’s turn to stiffen up. “You what?”
They didn’t speak about it for the rest of the night, but when they encountered Dean the Younger in the mess hall, Castiel couldn’t help but wonder what his reaction would be to the news. Maybe he would just have to find out, despite what the Older said.
“I think you look contemplative.”
“Look man,” he groaned, running his fingers through his grease-spiked hair. “It’s really not that hard. I was a dick and ignored him for months until he confronted my ass and told me to stop. I told him why, he didn’t care, so we started talking again. A while later, we were having a very heartfelt conversation and we ended up kissing. That’s pretty much what happened.”
Cas bit his lip and swallowed hard, looking very overwhelmed. “Can you say it, so I can hear it?”
Castiel retreated to his cabin, trying not to reimagine the poor girl’s last moments. They had been gruesome. She had shrieked with magnificent power before she was silenced at last. Castiel couldn’t comprehend the pain involved in being ripped apart and disemboweled. There hadn’t been a body to recover.
John lightly punched Bobby in the arm. “There’s plenty of blame to go around,” he said tiredly. “It’s not your fault. I know better than to take my eye off these two.”
"No! I mean, yes, I guess. I mean, I really like what you're doing right now. I just don't think I could do it tonight," rambled Dean.
Castiel let out a long breath, setting aside his briefcase. “Dean,” he began, tugging at the omega’s hand to pull him up from his chair, “you don’t have to do any of this. You’re a perfect mate for me as you are.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They were all for giving hefty welfare benefits to the unemployed as long as they adhered to their antediluvian ideas of what a proper family should look like. They were also against the doctor visit fee and the connected cash registers. They wanted to offer benefits to small businesses and a completely free healthcare.
“Thanks,” the redhead grinned. “I got my hair bobbed in celebration of the Voting Bill passing.”
For good measure, Dean also added a note to learn some formal social etiquette and maybe even sign up for some French classes. Or maybe Spanish. He didn’t want to feel like a simpleton when Cas started speaking in one of the many foreign languages the man knew and Dean didn’t understand.
Dean breathed a little more easily. He’d made that statement off the top of his head, with no idea whether it was true or not.
A young redheaded reporter appeared on the screen. She had a fake smile plastered on her face as she started talking. "After a series of disagreements over the new Voting Bill between the Liberal and Conservative senators this week, a new issue came up in the Senate this morning. It was brought up by a New York senator, Balthazar Roche, who said that omegas should be given merit scholarships at universities just like betas and alphas are. Dick Roman, a Texas senator for the Conservative Party and a well-known opponent of omegaist movements, has spoken publicly on the topic. Here's what he had to say."
It took Dean a moment to recall that ‘tree topper’ was one of Meg’s names for Castiel. Neither of them could figure out how the woman had come up with that one - the alpha wasn’t all that tall - but at least it wasn’t offensive.
“I hope you’re right,” both Dean and Gabe declared at the same time.
“But that’s slander!”
and almost choked.
"Mainly oil changes, brakes, spark plugs or vacuum lines but I have had to repair some car accident damages too."
I find the story is getting a more idealistic vibe the further I get but I figured we could all use something like that :)
Jo nodded, smirking slyly. "He is hot, if a bit old for an unmated alpha; he's like thirty-eight or something."
picture, they all piled into Charlie's car again and headed back home.
its supposed to help U with the chemical aspect of mating but IMO it's placebo. ppl didnt ever need anything like that b4 so I think U dont need it now.
“Chocolate spread? You mean like Nutella or something?”
Dean looked out of the window, watching Colorado Springs slowly passing by. He was really enjoying himself just talking and joking with these people, just like he remembered he used to do when he was at school. He hadn’t even realized how much he missed this normal human contact this past year. He supposed that had he gone to college, he would still be amongst people, instead of staying at home, cooking and cleaning.
“Dean,” Cas almost purred, drawing a finger down Dean’s cheekbone.
His brother stared, before slapping Dean's arm lightly. "Why did you call it cheese platters then?"
Castiel smiled shyly. "Then he and I have a common interest."
John suddenly stepped into Dean's space, leaning over him, sniffing at his neck.
"Oh, have you ever been?" asked Dean with interest.
Castiel glanced at him. "Me too," he said and Dean could've sworn he was blushing. Well, that was certainly new.
"It was good," said Dean quietly, "I, uh, I learned a lot."
The alpha cleared his throat. “I know, I’m sorry. I reckon I’m being irrational.”
Bobby smirked at him. "And how was that?"
Dean smiled hesitantly. "You want to?"
Except for the missing engine, the car seemed to be in a very good condition despite all the curled up metal and Dean couldn't help but feel happy. He could already imagine putting the beauty back together.
"I might not have accounted for how proud you omegas were," remarked the politician after Dean finished. "I will have to look into it again."
Dean threw him a panicky look. “What?”
The alpha chuckled. “For dessert,” he confirmed, patting Dean on the rear before backing away.
Speculation had run rampant, but it was Gabriel who came up with the best guess. “Do you think it could be Lieutenant Whatshisname?” he asked.
Dean wriggled in his mate’s grip, “Probably the centre. I don’t think he has the resolve to manage a group therapy - he’d just stop going.”
Cas looked at him, but didn’t reply.
Dean smiled and shifted Cas a little on his chest to a more comfortable spot. “I’m happy you’re here. That’s what I was thinking.”
“Who’s top?”
“Oh,” Dean murmured, his eyes dropping just slightly below Castiel’s. “That’ll never happen,” he added, staring at Castiel’s lips.
The Older took a swig from his beer, then let his hand hang down over the arm of his chair again. “I don’t need to try to convince anybody. He knows.”
“Hey man,” Dean said softly.
Reeling from having himself exposed like that, Dean answered. “Uhh, since Cas and I are both kinda virgins in a way, anything I should know going into this?”
The question was so innocent and sad. Dean’s little smile broke into a full-on grin. “Yeah. Every day I was there. I mean, I talked to you while I was there, but you were a completely different guy. I like you better.”
Dean stared out at the foot of his bed. He supposed Cas could try to fall asleep in his chair, but Dean knew firsthand how uncomfortable hospital bedsides were. He got an idea, hoping Cas wouldn’t be stubborn enough not to take it.
“What do you want, Cas?”
Dean sighed. “I dunno anymore man. If you’d asked me five years ago, I would’ve beat the crap out of you. But these past couple years have changed things. You died, I got possessed, we fought, and I realized that nothing matters. Who gives a crap what I feel when we’re constantly trapped in this cycle of bullshit? What I feel doesn’t change anything. I think I’ve loved you since the beginning, but I’m done denying it now.”
“Yeah. I kinda feel bad for them at the same time though. Neither one of them has fucked a dude before,” Dean added with a quiet but hysterical giggle. “That first time is gonna be rough.”
“Why’d you ask if you didn’t want the answer?” the Older asked, drinking his own beer with much more dignity.
“No,” Dean replied. “For once, no.”
“I haven’t lived in heaven for years. This is hardly a big change.”
Castiel smiled against Dean’s lips, kissing him briefly but sweetly. “Yes I do.”
“You talked to him, then?”
“How is that any different from all the benders you go on? We’re more alike than you think.”
“Maybe. I dunno. Dad had this thing. He wouldn’t have liked it if I…whatever. Like I said, who cares? Dad’s gone, Sammy’s gone. You’re the only one left and obviously that’s not a problem.” Dean’s grip on Castiel’s hand tightened ever so slightly.
Dean’s face twitched as he held back a laugh. “You’d barely lost your virginity, dude. You didn’t understand any of the slang I used to talk to you just every day. I think I would’ve died laughing if you tried to talk dirty.”
Looking around, Castiel saw the same emotions in the body language of the others in the car. Death was not an uncommon occurrence in their line of work, but it still was a tragedy. This particular death had shaken them all badly, and Castiel knew he wasn’t alone in his longing for the alcohol at home.
Dean took a deep breath, cringing at the pain, and ran his fingers through his hair. “I’m sorry, man. For everything. You deserve better.”
“How did you first decide you were okay with…being with a guy?” Dean asked, looking hesitantly at the Older as he took another drink of beer.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean jerked his head up in surprise. “Wait, only a year later? You’re in love with me now? I mean—” he corrected himself. “You from 2009?”
The tears in Cas’s eyes fell. “When was the last time you said that?”
“Yes.”
Dean half-shrugged. “You could have let me die.”
“I’ll always be there.”
“No way,” Dean said, trying to pull away. “Future me and you are—god, how far have you two gone?”
“Dean?” Cas asked, his voice muffled a little by Dean’s hospital gown.
Dean tried to gauge Cas’s reaction. He couldn’t really tell what he was thinking. Relief, maybe? Definitely still anger, but Dean didn’t expect that to go away anytime soon. Maybe not ever. But with
His eyes darted to a space on the ceiling over one of the windows, in which he had scrawled in Enochian a message to himself and anyone who might see it in future years.
Skin brushed against skin as they collapsed onto the bed in a tangle of arms and legs. Dean spent about three seconds rapidly unlacing his boots and throwing them aggressively across the room. Castiel laughed softly, and Dean growled in response, startling him. Nevertheless, the sound was effective, and Castiel pulled Dean back on top of him to fumble with his belt buckle.
Then he took his right hand off the steering wheel, reaching across to the passenger seat. Cas placed his own hand in Dean’s and squeezed once, looking ahead down the road all the while.
“I don’t give a crap what he thinks,” Dean scoffed unconvincingly. “I just don’t think he should know. Too much to deal with.”
Cas sighed. “Dean—”
Older Dean took a breath to retort, but Cas raised his eyebrows at him, and he shut his mouth with a frown. They glared at each other for a heartbeat before Dean the Older rolled his eyes and examined his younger counterpart, who was feeling more than a little uncomfortable.
Dean took a step up so they were closer together, but didn’t try to grab him again. His flirtatiousness seemed to seep away into solemnity as he said, “Talking to the other me made me realize how much time you and I lost circling each other. The idea of loving you—and sleeping with you—is completely new to him. He’s excited and scared, and I’m just grateful I have you now.”
“When you get back to 2009,” he said, “You need to sit down and have a talk with me.”
Cas looked out the windshield. “I didn’t think it was.”
So…could Cas be…?
“Wait,” Dean quickly replied, grabbing Cas’s forearm to keep him from teleporting. Cas looked at him expectantly, and Dean gulped. “There’s something I wanted to talk about.”
“Have you been avoiding me?” Castiel asked mildly.
“No, the point was spiritual healing and mutual orgasms.” Castiel made a face, glad Dean couldn’t see it in the dark, and began to lead him out of the forest towards his cabin. They had taken to sharing that one rather than Dean’s because they were less likely to be bothered. Of course, at this point, their fellow hunters knew that if Dean wasn’t at his place, he was probably at Castiel’s, which could be annoying when the two of them were aiming for privacy. But the Fearless Leader didn’t really get that luxury, so they made do.
Cas still looked unsure.
“Just once, and it didn’t last long,” Castiel replied. “For reasons I’m sure you can discern.”
The awkward silence resumed, and Dean berated himself for only having seen Cas for a couple of minutes and already starting an argument.
Accepting this, Castiel looked around them more systematically. “Why did you drag me out into the middle of the woods to tell me this?”
Dean jumped nearly through the windshield as he heard the familiar flutter.
“Dean, you don’t need to be freaked out, man,” Sam said, bemused. “I’ve known that Cas likes you forever.”
“So is that why you’ve been avoiding me? To spare yourself?”
So Dean moved on. “Cas, when you were trying to heal me yesterday, why didn’t it work?”
Dean took Castiel’s hand from where it was resting on the mattress between them and entwined their fingers, squeezing quickly once.
Dean took it, pulling himself upright. “Okay.” He turned the key in the ignition, and the Impala grumbled awake. Dean put her in gear, looking around briefly at the road before turning the car in the right direction.
“Will you stay with me?” Dean turned slightly against Castiel’s body to get a better look at him. They stared into each other’s eyes yet again, each time longer and more potent than the last.
“Why?” Castiel objected, turning half-around to look offendedly at Dean.
“Thank you,” Dean suddenly said. “If you and Cas hadn’t told me, I probably would have had my head up my ass for the next decade.”
The beads over the doorframe clacked as Dean brusquely pushed through them, and Castiel didn’t bother to turn around to face him from where he was sitting on the floor. He was watching the yellow light of the setting sun scatter around the shadows of those beads, projected onto the far wall of his cabin, and thought it looked very pretty. The people at Camp Chitaqua didn’t take much time to appreciate beauty anymore, himself included, when he was sober at least. Which was why he’d mostly given that up. Everything hurt too much without the drugs anyway.
“Megan ‘call me Meg’ Masters,” Dean half groaned.
The older man gave him an amused look but followed suit in undressing. It didn't take them long to stand almost naked in front of each other, both sporting only their boxer briefs.
"Now these are ugly," he said, turning to Cas and immediately feeling bad about what he ‘dsaid. Cas was looking at the vicious fish with an honest-to-God pout.
rather nice to have the opposition gnashing their teeth for a change,” he admitted, bending down and pecking Dean’s lips. “I am really grateful to you for taking such good care of me.”
we been through?"
“They didn’t call
“There’s a subcommittee meeting I should attend,” Cas informed him.
“For you, Dad?”
Dean shook his head fondly, pulling out the stand mixer. “Now we mix it together?” he inquired. Gabriel nodded, and while Dean was mixing, Gabe whipped up the egg whites with a pinch of salt. After folding the egg whites in, the batter was ready to be poured into a greased cake pan.
Castiel turned to him, tugging at his seatbelt in the process. "Dean," he started, "I'd very much like to have a way to contact you directly if we ever want to talk again. Would you mind giving me your phone number?"
There were a lot of articles on spouses or friends disagreeing regarding politics and Dean felt immediately better that he wasn't the only one in the world to have such a problem. He skipped stupid kinds of advice like ‘don't talk about explosive topics’ and ‘conform to your alpha's opinion’ and went right to a website that was apparently written by a team of a sociologist, a politologist and - curiously - a kindergarten teacher.
He didn’t see the newspaper on the table, which was where it was usually left by whoever picked it up, so Dean looked around the kitchen. Spotting the paper on one of the counters, the young man pushed back his chair, the wooden legs scraping across the tiles, and stood up to retrieve it.
“Of course I don’t,” Dean immediately concurred. “It just sounds a lot like something I already heard at the ER.”
Dean nodded. "Cute, I told you."
"Oh," Dean breathed out, "I didn't know that."
Dean flopped down on his bed, powering up the laptop he shared with Sammy. He typed in his password, opening up the browser.
"Yeah he is. He's a politician fighting for equal rights and-"
Castiel tilted his head to the right. "Not really. I suppose that Moravia might be debatable but Prague is definitely situated in Central Europe."
Silence.
The politician opened his menu. "What are you in the mood for?"
He gave Dean a blue mechanic suit with a nametag saying 'Perry'.
"Your dad told you a lot of bullshit, sweetheart," said Jo who suddenly appeared behind him, flicking her blonde hair out of her face.
Dean raised his eyebrows at the television, swallowing his mouthful of tuna salad he had made for dinner. Did he hear that right? Did Cas really say that he wanted to raise the omega benefits? It almost seemed too good to be true.
Dean rolled his eyes fondly. “I’m putting together a list of things I have to do in order to be a proper mate for you. I don’t want anything like that damned article to happen again.”
The omega felt like he was hallucinating. “Mine-” he croaked out, tearing his eyes off of the beautiful car and shooting Bobby an uncertain look. “I can’t accept that, Bobby. It must’ve cost a fortune.”
The omega could swear he felt his own boiling blood rushing past his ears as he couldn't help but moan loudly when Castiel finally started to move in earnest. It created a pleasant jittery feeling in his gut that vaguely resembled the sensation you got when you rode up in a lift. It was like a fire needing to be quenched and Dean felt almost frustrated with how quickly he could feel himself coming undone. They had barely started, for heaven's sake.
Dean frowned. "I still don't think it's a good idea."
It must be Castiel, Dean thought; it would be one hell of a coincidence if it was anyone else. What did he write though? Did he only text Dean to tell him that he didn't want to talk to him anymore? Was he angry that Dean didn't apologize for his father's behaviour? Did he even care enough to actually read his text? What if he just deleted it and then sent Dean a message saying to lose his number?
“Noah.”
Dean's eyes glittered. "Yes, Cas. I'm sure."
“Oh God, Cas,” the omega whined, the feeling of complete fullness overwhelming him. The steady pressure against his prostate was taking his breath away.
He started his reply to Gabe, feeling brave after the day he’d had.
Castiel reached out and took one of the omega’s hands in his own, rubbing his fingers soothingly across Dean’s knuckles. “What website was the article posted on?” he inquired quietly.
Dean grinned at him. "Hi, Sammy."
in hand - it was still rolled up with a rubber band around it, making Dean suspect Sammy had been the one to retrieve it this morning - he sat back down. Reaching for his mug of tea with one hand, he used his other hand to uncurl the paper enough so he could read the headlines.
“Sweetheart.” The older man took Dean in his arms, tenderly kissing him before saying, “This situation isn’t your fault. It’s just bad luck that someone saw us. Some reporters are unethical and will make the ‘facts’ fit whatever scenario they envision, just so they can get credit for a scoop.”
“Yeah, I-” He paused. “I want to see you. I thought we might talk?”
Dean rolled his eyes and sat back down, suddenly not interested in seeing the guy at all. "I don't want anyone's babies, Joanna," he snapped.
"Sorry, brother," said Benny after he bumped into him on his way from the loo. Dean just waved him off, intent on visiting the facilities as well before one of the girls decided she needed to brush up on her make up.
Dean barely got a word in before Castiel started on about a different topic. "In an ideal world, we would be able to control people's salaries more and actually give them the money they deserve. Have you ever thought about why a footballer makes millions of dollars a year, while a miner who works physically just as hard - if not more - earns a thousand times less?"
He slid his hands up the front of the older man's suit jacket, tugging at the single button to open it, while his lips found Castiel's. He had thought about doing this the whole past week, ever since they made out on the couch and now was his chance to make it a reality.
Dean walked up to the church slowly, being early again, rolling his thoughts around in his head. He was looking forward to seeing his new friends again, especially Charlie. They had chatted together a few times over the past two weeks, talking about anything from politics to
Dean squirmed under the intense scrutiny he was receiving. He felt strangely exposed as the people around him - who were originally only interested in the senator - were now all watching him to see what he would say in answer.
Jo rolled her eyes. "Maybe you should stop waiting for a fairytale and just look amongst us mere mortals. You're not getting any younger, Gabe. How old are you, sixty?"
Castiel smiled fondly at his mate. "He already knows I have money - that we have money - you shouldn't feel ashamed of that."
Bobby threw him a concerned look, putting away his half-eaten sandwich. “With Castiel?”
"I'm not sure," Cas said slowly, "but the way I feel when I'm around him... I've never felt like that before."
Dean laughed. “Sometimes I think my dad is just a big kid, and Sammy… Well, there’s no question. He
Dean chuckled, putting his arms around the alpha. “That’s the point, Cas. You know I love working on cars; putting the sweetheart together is half the fun. It makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something when I get a car working, you know? It’s like you feeling good about reforming the system.”
“It’s just… the last time I remember you looking like this wasn’t because you were
“Mmm,” Dean moaned in agreement. It was beyond him to say more than that, but he couldn’t imagine anyone else besides his mate feeling this good inside him.
But now for the first time, it felt truly like home. They shared a bear but really it was a supplement for proper dinner because the brothers were tired and sleepy. Dean’s limbs were sore and he was constantly stretching to keep himself awake. Sam sighed and left for his room quickly afterwards, nodding to him and Cas one last time.
Cas let him struggle form to a sentence for a moment. Then he placed his fork down and turned to face Dean. “You want to know if I can love, Dean?” He asked, voice deeper.
Next morning, he woke up early. Sam was usually an early riser but seemed to have slept in for the day. Dean went to the kitchen rolling his sleeves up and smiling. He enjoyed that he had it to himself. The morning sunlight gently fell on the white tiles, the particularly domestic smell of this part of the bunker was soothing.
Cas's hand was back on Dean’s ass, holding tightly now that the fabric was gone. He leaned closed to Dean’s ear, inhaling. “Do you know how long I have wanted this Dean?”
And for a moment, Dean was lost in the night blue eyes. “I…I am too.”
“Dean, love is complicated. You would think dealing with it becomes easier when you experience it so purely, so vividly but no, if anything it makes it a buttload harder.” He mumbled the last sentence.
“And Sammy.” Dean breathed. “You have to tell me that its ok to go” His blurring vision faded entirely as tears swelled up in his still eyes. He felt his brother’s grip tighten on him, defiantly trying to hold on. “You have to do this for me Sammy”
He tightened his grip.
Cas took his upper arm and forced it to the table until it connected against it and Dean was bending over. He froze, the glass was cold under his skin. His legs involuntarily spread a little, waiting for Cas. Cas leaned over him and nipped at the back of his shoulder blade dragging his hand down his back and then shoving it between his legs.
Cas kept going, his hand joining Dean's who whined at the contact. Cas took him in one firm grip, moving his hand so perfectly that other practically keened. “Cas-” He warned, squeezing his eyes shut, breathing heavily through his mouth.
“Of course, yes, not as hands off as he had said huh” Dean mumbled, trying to joke then rolled his eyes when it didn’t land.
That’s all Dean could bring himself to say.  His pants closed down on him, too tight now. He wanted them off.
The hand on his back dropped lower until it was resting on the curve of Dean's ass and Cas grabbed at him, pushing him forward, growling in Dean’s ear. Dean was looking shyly to the side, he sucked in air as he felt the grip on him. He tensed up slightly as Cas left his neck and untucked his shirt snaking a hand inside, his palm came to rest on Dean’s hip and he thought he would fall apart.
words from Cas had him acting like teenage boy with a crush. And Cas was a man, Dean liked women, and so did Cas. His vessel at least. He himself was a celestial being with a true form larger than buildings and a voice that would pierce Dean’s eardrums. Dean couldn’t comprehend what a being like that would think of anything romantic.
“—Right” Sam said. “Come on then and wash your hands.” Sam answered. Cas’s eye blew comically wide. “There is blood on it” Sam pointed and quickly followed Eileen who was suppressing a laugh.
And Cas delivered, oh he did. He shoved his tongue over Dean’s, the impact pushing him up against the table behind them and explored him thoroughly only breaking apart when they were both panting. Cas caressed Dean’s jaw with a thumb staring intently at his reddened lips for a second, Dean barely opened his eyes.
“Cas”
The disappearing figure of his brother trembled. Dean wished helplessly to hold his brother, reassure him, but his body wouldn’t allow.
“I know. Do you trust me?”
Dean winced ever so slightly and bit his tongue to not cry out. Cas steadied, letting Dean adjust and the drew himself out, his pace careful as before. He rocked back shallowly, maintaining it until Dean was comfortable and then went deeper, lowering his hands down to Dean’s hips.
Cas would be the first one to take him like this. The
But Dean was…curious. If anything, he was dying to confront Cas over what he had meant earlier. They were parting forever, and Cas probably did not understand what his words implied. Perhaps that was why he used them so often. He wasn’t human after all, he had probably come to empathize with them, like he used his brothers. That’s what Dean and Sam were like to him…Brothers.
Cas seemed to able to read Dean’s bodily reactions because immediately, he responded with clutching Dean’s waistband and snatching it down. Cold air hit Dean’s behind and he suddenly felt very naked. And very…very desperate.
Dean was still in shock. He stared down at his healed body and rose up on his toes slightly swinging back and forth to confirm that his feet were functional. He was alive. Once more, fate had swayed in an odd direction.
why she was with me”
“Yeah Dean, everyone came back.”
“To get Eileen?”
Dean snuffed; all cheekiness gone.  He snuggled his face against the chilly table add turned to look at the angel, eyes innocent, inquiring. Cas patted his hair, cupping his face and brushing his thumb over his cheeks. “Its ok.” He cooed. Dean nodded a little and turned his face back, waiting for Cas.
Dean jerked back and caught the angel by surprise. “Yeah I am ok Cas!” He held his hands up in defense and looked away. He had to sort through his emotions or he would keep acting like an awkward mess.
“Yeah. There uh—pasta still on the table. If Eileen’s hungry.” He turned to her and smiled. Distracted by the scene in front of her, she was almost caught by surprised.
“Vamp” Cas pointed at the body on the floor.
They eventually arrived at the airport and took a flight back to Kansas, not wanting to stay in a car too long.
“We haven’t eaten yet either. The vamp interrupted.”  Cas told them.
them.
“Cas” Dean exclaimed flexing his muscles at the first touch. Cas gently drove a thumbnail inside him.
“Yes Dean?”
“Ok?”
Dean gulped, shoving his face with pasta to push the thought away.
The bunker had never really replaced the cozy little living room where they worked with Bobby. It was better looking but impersonal, they had all thought that one day they would move on from it, hit the road and live in cheap hotels like usual.
“I am glad” Cas replied courteously. He had picked a lot from the humans, yet here and there, Dean noticed monotony in the way he spoke, like a friendly butler that at the end of the day, knew his formal boundaries.
“Yeah” Sam said urgently, to say it before he no longer had the courage to.
“I love you Cas.” Dean heaved. “I love you too.” He blushed hard, lowering his gaze.
He got up, forcing his breaths, feeling so small suddenly, so aware of a cosmic being next to him. An angel, billions of years old, who could snap him into pieces the moment he wanted. Who made him feel things he thought he could never feel again, and then for another man? Had he had accidentally ended up in one of Chuck’s alternate universes? Was he about to take it all away from him? Was this his real ending?
“You know to stay safe or whatever.”
Cas hastened up, partly because he was growing impatient and going by the sounds he was making, so was Dean. Dean yelped, jerking forward a little and then grabbing tightly at the table. “Don’t stop” he pleaded.
“Oh well, I should leave too, you need rest.”  Cas said putting down the bottle he decided to drink as a courtesy and turned around to disappear.
Cas was urgently palming Dean, kneading his ass and then moving to his crotch.
“So, this is a social call” Cas figured out.
By the time he looked up at the Cas and Sam, they had come to him. “How are you Dean?” Cas asked, his eyes squinting a little, lips curved up in a small smile. Sam was grinning ecstatically, like he had witnessed a miracle. His eyes darted excitedly between Cas and his brother.
Dean pouted and then sighed exasperatedly. “Yes, Cas I am having blast down here now please move your feathery ass.”
He had grown so used to dejection that he was acutely aware of his body now that things were different.
Dean decided to drive back to the bunker and pulled up in the driveway. He was submerged in the familiar smell of leather and tile cleaners; he took it in slowly and went to the war room, propping down on the table. “Say we take a little break, get back in shape then back to work?” He suggested. “I mean Cas is back and he is all powered up again, we can use that?”
“But that
He curled his fingers in Dean’s hair, spinning his face to the side kissed him hungrily, teeth clashing and messy. He felt himself draw nearer, his rhythm breaking. Dean himself was close to the edge. And he had hadn’t touched himself yet. He tried to move his hand away from the table without which he was sliding forward every time Cas thrust.
“I am just wondering if all angels feel similarly you know, if they…if you, for example, like with Meg and-” He trailed off, there was no other way of asking it.
“Hey Cas” He started. “You uhh-” Cas rose an eyebrow. “When Anna fell-” Where had this come from. “She’d lost her grace; she’d essentially became human right?”
“This is how it was meant to be Sammy; this is how I am
Sam hovered his hands close to Dean’s wound, drawing back when couldn’t do anything. “I will get help” He said. But both of them had seen wounds like these. This was where they looked solemn, prepared to burry someone, this was a time for goodbyes.
“Hey—uh” Sam entered, some groceries in hand and Eileen on the side. “What happened here?”
Cas leaned forward until their foreheads were touching and Dean let go, Cas could do what he liked, there wasn’t a thing Dean would refuse him as long they stayed just like this. Cas’s nose touch Dean’s, as the angel’s breath fell on his face, he closed his eyes.
This was supposed to be familial and brotherly, not give him butterflies. It had been making Dean fidgety ever since Castiel said those damned words and disappeared.
“I uh, made breakfast” Dean said.
“Cas?” Dean called out; his attention immediately shifted back to himself. He had not sounded like a dying man. The stain on his stomach was gone, no sign of a wound either. Sam and Dean gaped at each other and then to the blue-eyed angel who had joined them. Sam’s hand fell of Dean’s shoulder, more in surprise than anything else and Dean found himself firm on his feet.
His brother had grown up so much. Dean thought. Too much even. Over and over the world threatened to collapse like a worn-out tent on rusty poles, and each time they had held it up. They had lost years to it.
But Cas was back on top of him. Dean whimpered when he felt Cas’s cock pulsating against Dean’s ass. He spread his legs further. Several moments passed, when nothing happened and Dean was still going numb under the Cas, he made a complaining noise. “Come on”
“Of course.”
But He liked the feeling. The little lump in his throat, the way his breath hitched and he had to suppress his grin every time he tried to think about it. It was all physically pleasant to experience.
Dean huffed and pressed right on. “Yes, so much.”
Sam collected himself and finally nodde. “It’s okay Dean.” He said, shaking. Dean smiled, letting his head lean back, and closed his eyes. “You can go now.” His voice broke several times but he was determined, and smiling back at his brother through a fresh cascade of tears. Dean had done more than enough. He deserved to be happy.
“And what about it?”
Dean would have said something if a blade hadn’t come plunging towards Cas. He deflected it easily and jolted up from the chair to find its source. Dean was already on his feet going to the war room.  He spun around searching and ran over to the broken-down door.
Dean cried out loud, throwing his head back, Cas took the opportunity and slid his arm under dean’s jaw, clutching his shoulder to maintain the position. Dean found his airflow restricting just slightly and if anything, it turned him on.
“We did now.” Dean shrugged, panting. The way they appeared; Sam could easily connect the dots if he wanted. He did look suspicious.
“You have?” Dean asked, hopefully. Had Cas been picturing him like this all along,
“I am fading, I am fading fast” Dean said, he felt giddy, the feeling was vaguely familiar, somewhat like waking up in the morning, or anxiety picking at him on his worse days, or the anticipation of something uncertain. But it did not make it less dreadful.
And that was the difference. The Younger was the man Castiel had fallen in love with, and the Older was the one traveling along a bridge that led to something Castiel knew there was no coming back from.
Dean was even more weirded out. “You guys are together? Like together together?” He clenched his jaw, suddenly very uncomfortable. The Castiel from his time said some strange crap, but this was way worse than anything he’d ever said before.
Dean smacked Castiel’s shoulder and scooted on his rear to lean against the footboard of Castiel’s bed. “Come on, dumbass, this is a way better idea.”
“Would you like to stay here for the night?” Castiel asked, changing the subject.
When he got to Dean’s collarbone, tonguing the sensitive skin, Castiel hooked his legs around Dean’s and deftly rolled them both over, coming up on his hands and knees as Dean sprawled wildly on the rug. He looked at Castiel with a mixture of curiosity, and…love? Whatever it might be, it was tender and soft, a side of himself that he rarely let the outside world see.
“You wanna move this to the bed?” he asked with an attempt at nonchalance that was unable to hide his desire.
Several seconds passed before the Younger finally spoke up. “So…you and Cas?”
Those words hit Dean a little harder than he expected. So much for “nothing matters.” Apparently damning the consequences was not quite as easy as Dean thought. He realized that there were tears in his eyes, and he took his hand away from Cas’s waist to wipe them away.
But Jack had loved Cas too; he would have never left Cas there to rot. Bringing him back would have been the first things he’d done as God.
Dean nodded. “I don’t want to be alone.”
“I’m thinking. There’s something I should tell you about.” Cas tilted his head a little, something Dean hadn’t seen in the entire time he had been here. His Cas did it all the time, but Future Cas never did. Dean guessed he’d grown out of it, the same way he had grown out of every other socially awkward habit he’d used to have.
“I don’t even know why we try anymore, Cas, I really don’t,” Dean was saying, slumped low against the bed. “Everyone we love dies. Painfully. Torn apart.” Dean shuddered a little at that last part, and rubbed at his face. “If you die, that’s it, I’m done. No reason to stay.”
For a moment, Castiel thought that Dean was about to relent and fall into his arms. It was the way he had behaved since they had become a couple, oddly sensitive and more willing to be weak. But instead, Dean’s face went cold and his lips pinched together. Falling back into old habits instead.
Cas smiled sweetly. “Just a minute ago you were pretty sure.”
Castiel smacked him. “You’d do well to remember that I learned it from God’s hairless apes—animals in their own right.”
“Dean?” he asked, his voice timid despite his arms keeping Dean pinned tightly against him.
“Both you and I did. And they weren’t bullshitting me, either,” Dean said with a smile of his own. “They told me that when I came back I needed to tell you, because if the world’s going to go to shit, then we should get together as soon as possible. Then we have more time.”
After lighting the multiple little lanterns in his cabin, Castiel sprawled on his back and followed the woodgrain of the ceiling with his eyes. A newly opened bottle of whiskey sat by his hip, and he took a careful swig, struggling not to drown himself with it at this angle.
Neither one of them said anything for a moment, Dean staring intensely as Castiel, probably evaluating his options. As last, Dean clapped Castiel’s shoulder and said, “Here’s the deal. You gotta be sober more often, and do some goddamned work for once, and I’ll come by for some crap therapy session sometime.”
Castiel shook his head, but warmed inside nonetheless at the words. “I love you too, Dean. And I suppose we should be celebrating a mission accomplished, if the younger you truly is convinced.”
Cas gently broke off contact at the lips and pressed his forehead against Dean’s, eyes squeezed shut. “Dean, I love you,” he murmured, holding Dean’s waist on both sides, stroking his skin.
“You need to rest for a while, but I thought you might like to know that a man’s been waiting outside since he brought you in. Says he’s your friend.”
“That’s not true. I’m sorry, Cas, honestly. Tell me what you were going to say.” Dean grabbed Cas’s shoulder, trying to convince him.
Dean’s face felt a little hotter than the fire could account for, but he stored away the knowledge anyway. “Anything else?”
“Are you okay?”
“Then rely on me.”
The nurse stared him down, then shrugged. She pushed open the heavy door, and Dean heard her speaking to someone outside. A moment later, and she had slipped out the door, and in her place stood Cas, appearing stuck somewhere between relief and bitterness.
“I gotta say, Cas, you’ve figured out how to play human pretty well,” Dean said, turning in a circle to take in the room.
Cas stayed silent.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, so softly he wasn’t sure Cas even heard it. But looking at him, he might have already fallen asleep.
Dean sighed. “I’m sorry, kid.”
Cas pushed himself onto his hands and knees so Dean could see him smile. “You’re here now.” He ran a hand down Dean’s chest. “That’s all that matters.”
Instantly, Cas broke into indignant laughter. “You’re the worst.”
When his power gave out entirely, Castiel gasped, sitting back on his heels and feeling more grounded to this planet than ever before. His grace was gone completely. He shoved down his panic and grief before it could overwhelm him. If Dean died, nothing mattered. Human or not, Castiel would save Dean Winchester or die trying.
“This life sucks. Cas is the only good thing in it. If you can keep the world from breaking and get with the love of your life, then that’s as close to paradise as I can imagine.” Dean the Older took a swig from his beer, inhaled, and pushed himself up out of his chair. “Now if you’ll excuse me,” he said, looking down on his younger counterpart. “All this talk of love and sex has left me wanting to make out with my boyfriend somewhere. See you sometime tomorrow.” He winked, then turned and stomped off towards one of the other campfires, looking for Cas.
“That’s what I mean!”
“What’s the fun in that?”
Castiel squeezed Dean’s arm harder. “But keeping that a secret just for the shock value—!”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Do you mean what you’re saying then?”
“Yeah, sounds like a plan,” Dean said, settling down again.
“Yeah,” Dean half-agreed. “So, soap opera-y.”
Dean made a noise of disgust. “Aww, don’t tell me you hosted one of those damn orgies out here before.”
