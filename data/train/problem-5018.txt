Cas nods again.
Cas looks at his half eaten pizza and closes the box.
[6.12., 20:57] Dean: Don't feel stupid
[13.12., 08:05] Dean : Well i did wake up pretty turned on,
Dean pushes himself up with one arm and moves his hips slowly. "You look amazing."
"Oh, and here I was, hoping for coffee." Cas jokes.
"Do you have to go in?"
"I am sorry babe. We'll work together again. I promise. But I have to take care of him and I need a day to gather myself. A lot of shit happened lately. If I don't I can guarantee I'll either drink myself stupid or beg you to dom me."
"Dean!" Castiel sighs and takes Dean's face between his hands and kisses him hard.
"That's all you need. You don't need to take care of him and you don't need to like the fact that he is in my house. We will find a way for more time. Sam wants to hang with Jack as much as I want to see you and as long as gabe is OK with it he can go there  and I will be at yours. As soon as they got the talk we will find a system that works."
[11.2., 12:55] Castiel: I'll not break down on purpose though.
[5.12., 12:18] Castiel: Oh. Sorry
"Oh ouch! Is Ana doing okay though?"
[3.1., 00:05] Dean: ... no matter how scared you are
"Thank you for understanding my behaviour. "
Dean snorts. "Shut up. I am pretty sure that's your cum sticking me to it."
[8.12., 11:53] Dean: Wth
[11.2., 11:40] Castiel: Tell your phone not to do that
His hand shakes when he takes the bottle but he seems more stable than yesterday. "Thank you. I'm sorry I am so boring and just sleep. '' his stomach growls.
[13.12., 19:52] Dean : Its a strange feeling but oh fuck yeah
Dean holds his hand up to Cas and he kisses each fingertip separately, then his open palm.
[11.2., 15:02] Dean: I wanna go home
"Good. You look good. You look relaxed. That's good."
Castiel undresses too and slips on pajama pants. Then he crawls on the bed to Dean.
"She's so good with them. Was it like that the whole time during our Europe trip?" Castiel asks.
Cas chuckles. "My dork." He crawls over Dean and kisses him deeply.
[22.12., 14:16] Castiel: Oh.
[8.12., 12:12] Dean: So
They order in.
Dean stands up in front of Castiel and raises his hands. "Help please."
[22.12., 14:13] Castiel: If the kiss hadn't been alright, I'd have told you
[6.12., 19:22] Dean: I just don't cope well at times and revert to the status I grew up with
"When will he be home then?"
"This was definitely the nicer adult stuff." Cas says sipping his coffee.
"See you soon."
Car loaded up with enough food for the week and a few alcoholic drinks for new years eve, they stop for a late lunch at the diner on their way home.
"Ok. What can I do?"
"Yeah. Getting yelled at together does sound better." He reaches for Cas ' hand. I call her Monday and ask. ok?"
[26.5., 15:57] Dean: Ok
[11.1., 22:13] Castiel: Good night, Dean. Sweet Dreams my boy.
[4.12., 07:26] Dean: I am so embarrassed
"You're right."
[12.2., 09:35] Charlie: At yours?
"Mmmh, if you didn't have school tomorrow..."
Dean laughs. "Now I am really worried." And walks to the living room.
"Awwwwe, this is cozy." Castiel smiles as he snuggles close to Dean.
[5.12., 15:05] Dean: So
Cas waves back and goes to work in the office.
"Missoury yelled at me for not having seen her in so long and then she made me suffer." He reaches out his arms for a hug and collapses into Cas.
[2.12., 19:53] Castiel: Are you thinking about zombies and apocalypses a lot?
[24.2., 08:05] Dean: I don't need to see them today.
"You close to ovulation?" Cas jokes.
[13.12., 21:00] Castiel: When I'm properly prepared
"But for now you're here." She says smuggly.
"You do, my love." Cas grins.
"Yes it is. Like you."
[20.1., 15:22] Dean: Are you ok?
"I love your sounds babe."
Cas looks at Dean.  His face seems more relaxed. He decides to keep talking to him
"I love you so very much." Cas sighs
[12.2., 08:09] Gabriel: Ok. I'll be prepared to help after he gets off.
"I kinda do." Dean looks to Dr. Mills. "I enjoy anything we do. Cuddling, kissing, sex. I don't care. I just enjoy being close to him in whatever way he feels comfortable in but..." Dean looks at Cas. "I feel really guilty sometimes when you get so insecure about our sex life because I feel like I am pressuring you or I am worried you regret something."
[4.2., 12:35] Castiel: Lots of them
[8.1., 14:27] Castiel: Okay. If they happen to have pillows let me know
"I love you too."
Dean closes his eyes and enjoys the ride.
Castiel seriously enjoys this and loves that Dean feels comfortable enough in his makeup
"What? Hey calm down." Dean puts a hand on Cas's chest. "Did we have plans?"
"Good sound?"
"Saw him on top of Sam on the couch." Dean runs upstairs and grabs some clothes.
Dean pushes Cas gently against the shower wall and cages him with his arms.
Dean is so deep in his studies, he doesn't notice how time goes by and suddenly it's almost 11am. He needs to be in class in 15 minutes. Hastily he packs up his stuff and runs out as quietly as possible.  He has to make his way across campus and arrives just in time.
[8.12., 12:25] Dean: We share all accounting classes
"It's hard to explain. I mean, I'm still, what was it? Demi-sexual? But it's not... these days, I like it more when the mood hits. I look forward to being intimate with you."
"No." Cas pouts.
"Mmmmmh. If I wasn't already, I'd date you."
[22.12., 21:46] Dean: He ain't wrong
"Cas?"
[29.1., 14:26] Castiel: Wait, where are we having the Talk? Where are you staying tonight?
"That.. babe.. that's not what I meant." Dean grabs his face." I meant that as thank you, I didn't expect that to happen."
Castiel nods. "Yes. That sounds reasonable."
"I am gonna run upstairs and pack a small bag. Anything you need to take back?"
[20.1., 11:33] Dean: Because I didn't call her when I spiraled last night but burdened you. She specifically told me to call her after our appointment
Dean snorts. "Let's eat. Are you dessert?"
[19.1., 11:21] Dean: Ok. I message you after I am done.
"Hmm. " Dean hums in agreement and lays out his supplies. He threads the needle and puts the printed fabric in the hoop just like the instructions tell him to.
"Its all you. I am just here to look pretty and cheer you on." Dean smiles. "Go Angel Go"
Cas grins and takes a bite.
Encouraged by the permission, Dean massages the pucker with his finger while keeping up the suction around Cas dick and moving his tongue over the head and whatever he can reach.
"Stop it. Stop getting down on yourself. You've never had to deal with being told no. You had no idea how it would feel. It's ok. You did the right thing and stopped. That's all that matters." Dean whispers into Castiel's skin and finishes it up with sucking a small bruise behind Cas' ear.
"We'll ask him tomorrow? See what furniture you want from your place here and what he can use. And he'll need a ceiling for sure."
[15.12., 21:58] Dean: And the lace in the front
[25.1., 10:33] Dean: That be trouble at home. But I keep it in mind as an option. Thank you
[23.1., 10:02] Dean: I am wearing the plug.
[7.12., 20:19] Dean: Holiday shipping? Lol
"Dear god Dean. Why are you wearing Donna's apron?"
"Unfortunately, yes." Cas smiles and leans in for a kiss.
[8.12., 22:29] Castiel: I'm glad you like them
"Very well. Don't touch yourself while I get the lube." Cas says and crawls out of their tent.
Cas raises his eyebrow.  "Okay, what's up?"
“It’s okay, I know Dean”
[3.3., 16:04] Castiel: Yes.
[15.12., 19:06] Castiel: Do you mean Sam and Jack
[15.10., 12:18] Castiel: Of course. Out with Tana atm. Gonna get it when we get home.
[15.10., 13:39] Castiel: I'm taking Lucy and Tana and go to Gabriel until you're home
Dean collects their plates once they are finished and puts them in the kitchen. "I do dishes later, I am gonna hop in the shower real quick. OK?"
"I didn't mean to feel bad. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad about studying so hard. But I need you back. I need you next to me at night. I need you to wake me up so i can kiss you goodbye and wish you a successful day."
"Good. I will see you again soon." He kisses him quickly then goes inside himself
[4.12., 12:27] Dean: Testy
[8.12., 22:08] Dean: You just helped to add to it
"I figured after I got a show off you in just panties and apron,  I should return the favor. "
[6.12., 15:31] Dean: Its a hallmark one
[5.2., 09:46] Dean: No
Cas gets up and let's Donna and her officer in.
[27.1., 16:37] Dean: Sorry.
Sam fake gags in the background. "Yuck. You are gonna make me lose my dinner dude."
Castiel nods in agreement.
[15.12., 09:11] Castiel: Yes
"No. Next time I'd like to see the hives."
[7.12., 20:14] Dean: You?
"One. Because you are being mean. "
Cas takes off his shirt and hands it over.
"Okay. Can we go to the garden center tomorrow after therapy?"
Out of the corner of his eyes he sees a trench coat disappear down a side road and his dog is pulling him in the same direction.
Dean puts the plug aside and lubes up his fingers. "3?"
[3.12., 21:24] Dean: Hmmm
He claws at Castiel's back. "I am about to ruin those panties."
Dean shuts up and kisses back.
"He doesn't trust your police record."
"Let's go to bed, Love."
"Ok dude. What's with you and refusing to talk plans for college?" Dean finally asks.
"Then let's build a nest and I'll let you watch it."
"And earlier. You said uhm. You said that just because you don't need anything back doesn't mean you'd love me less."
Castiel nods. "Yes."
Dean sounds very small and insecure when he answers." It's awkward. Its never strained or awkward. And its my fault.
"Let's go then."
[30.3., 08:14] Dean: Uhhhh coffee. I had one cup this morning. Then had to run.
"I've made some kale pomegranate salad and made dough for pizza."
[6.12., 18:52] Castiel: Please don't be drinking because of your brother's comment!
[1.2., 08:24] Castiel: Dean. I've been thinking.
"Oh. I see."
[24.5., 08:21] Dean: Ok. I cuddled your pillow. But its not the same.
That makes him blush. Dean fucking Winchester blushing over a compliment while having a dick in his mouth. "HMMM" he hums and goes down further till he hits the back of his throat. He takes a deep breath and suppresses his gag reflex.
"I need you more than therapy. You are my therapy."
[7.12., 20:15] Dean: He was a rolle model
[26.5., 09:12] Gabe: Not according to that file
ean grabs Cas and pulls him up. "Share? Kiss me?"
[31.3., 18:11] Dean: What's your favorite thing about men
"I don't like it."
Cas spends the day trying to figure out a DnD wheelchair.
[28.1., 12:48] Castiel: Okay
"Hey girl. How was your day?" Cas greets her.
"I am sorry I can't be there when you get done. "
Dean crawls over him and sucks on Castiels covered cock before he settles into his lap.
[11.1., 07:34] Dean: How's work
[13.12., 14:00] Dean : No matter how much you pout
[3.3., 15:55] Castiel: I'll get everything ready.
"Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I be?"
"Like I would leave you now, Sweetheart."
"Wow. What's next? Full time artist or are you joining me?"
They get dressed in sweatpants and tshirts and go back downstairs.
Dean smiles, proud of himself, and sits down to eat.
[3.2., 10:20] Benny: You better. We'll talk later, I have an actual customer coming in now.
Cas sits on the couch for a while working out how the app is meant to work.
"I suggest you stay quiet."
"Honey I am home." He yells into the house and hears Cas cooking in the kitchen.
[4.1., 17:25] Castiel: It happened. You
Castiel nods.
Once the meat is in the oven they start on the vegetables and before they know it the sun is setting and they haven't thought about the intruder all day.
[3.2., 10:04] Benny: That is huge
Dean wraps one hand behind Cas' head and pulls him in. Kissing him dirty from the start.
[6.12., 15:59] Castiel: Wipe that from your memory
"Sorry, love."
Cas stares at Dean.
After putting out food and handing out snuggles for their babies, they find themselves in bed. Cas on his back and Dean with his head on his chest.
"I hope so. It would be so terrible if you had to pay for that."
[15.12., 09:41] Dean: I passes the background check
"Ouch." Cas cringes.
Dean moans. "Nipples... please."
"Yes?"
"Why not. Both of us like cuddles and think it's awesome that the other likes it too."
[27.4., 12:42] Castiel: Oh
Cas follows soon after.
Dean moans into the kiss and grabs Cas hair, pulling him closer.
[13.12., 15:28] Dean : I started dinner
"Ohhh. Winchester. You sound all grown up."
"CAS?!"
"Oh my god. I... I feel like an idiot." He laughs. "I felt so horrible for wanting that. And even more so for asking you. Thinking you'd hate it."
"Good night Freckles."
"I'd join you if we had more time."
[3.2., 11:05] Castiel: Okay
"I should get going. I gotta go to work tomorrow."
Cas kisses his neck with his eyes closed.
Thank you for reading. Comments are life!
[3.1., 00:19] Dean: They look like they about to break up
[15.12., 20:22] Castiel: Coffee less life is hard
[26.12., 15:47] Dean: I saw the pic
[29.1., 14:47] Castiel: 😆
[5.2., 12:21] Castiel: I see.
Cas moves further up. "Want my dick? Get it." He husks.
[6.12., 19:42] Dean: https://xdress.co.uk/products/mens-pink-satin-and-lace-bikini-panty
[26.1., 19:59] Castiel: Feeling more like the creepy uncle
[3.12., 19:15] Castiel: Wow, talk about not close enough for private details
"See that's not snoring. That's allergies."
"I'd like that. Could I be naked?"
Dean looks overwhelmed. "I wanted to sit on the couch but I didn't put the fort down." He holds both cups in his hands and looks helplessly at Cas.
"I barely even did anything..."
[16.2., 19:50] Charlie: You sent me to the bathroom for the pajamas
"Hope she likes it." Cas says and hugs Charlie.
Dean smiles sadly. "Ok. Be back in 30."
[5.12., 14:40] Dean: Yeah
Castiel comes downstairs rubbing sleep out of his eyes.
Cas gets grabbed by Dean who let's himself fall backwards and takes his boyfriend with him. "I want you to use me as your pillow please. I like the feeling of you on my chest."
Once they are done they head upstairs together. "So, how do you want us to come together?"
[13.12., 18:23] Castiel: No
Dean grabs his phone. He notices that his last message has been read but no reply.
[9.3., 14:36] Castiel: True. Yes, I do.
His hips stutter. "Yours. Just yours." Dean leans forward and kisses Castiel.
[7.12., 11:04] Dean: Im sorry
"Rufus, we are leaving. Got more shit done today then I have ever since you put me in charge. We are keeping him. See you tomorrow." Dean yells into the office Rufus works in and grabs Cas hand pulling him to their cars.
"I love you. And I love when you fuck me!"
"I think loverboy over there is about to have a stroke." Bennie answers and points to Dean. " I am guessing I am one of the first people he ran into with you. Dean, I am happy for you. Could have given me a chance, tho" he chuckles and leaves.
[4.12., 21:10] Dean: Or why does that warrant the need to be carefull
[7.12., 21:03] Dean: Thats garland for you
"Yay. Thank you." Dean shuffles inside and waves at Garth who is now polishing the wrenches.
[8.12., 21:20] Dean: It all makes sense at first but if you dig deeper money disappears and then big loss at the end but hard to trace
"Yes." Cas nods. "But Dean? The domination thing... it's mostly a mood thing for me, I can't control my moods most of the time. How am I supposed to communicate that?"
[27.5., 18:21] Castiel: I can't wait to see you, but I'll let the other idiots get out first, I'd be stuck in baggage claim anyway
On screen he moans loudly and shudders. He keeps on riding the plug milking himself.
"Bed sounds good."
"Hello Dean." Castiel smiles "you look so pretty. And so snuggable." Cas grins he puts a bottle of water next to Dean and then moves to take care of his ass. He doesn't even start before he crawls back out and runs up to the bedroom.
"Well, to be honest, I'm surprised I was impacted as much, I wasn't expecting as many orgasms as I had."
Cas gets up and almost runs off to the bathroom yelling sorry.
Cas leans back and starts a new page on his sketch block.
[5.2., 08:11] Dean: Ok good
Cas hums contently and runs his hands over Dean.
[3.2., 07:52] Dean: I do
"I will wait upstairs." Castiel says and goes up into the bedroom, he fluffs up the pillows and makes them a comfy substitute for the couch
[24.2., 08:19] Castiel: Why?
[3.12., 18:44] Dean: That might make it fun
Ezekiel laughs. "You know. I still have some from bible camp. I could show you."
[28.1., 11:27] Dean: Why
Dean puts the bowls down and grabs napkins and drinks for Cas and himself.
[13.12., 12:20] Castiel: No, mine
[13.12., 12:08] Dean : Awwwe
"It's freaking quiet for a teenage birthday, Dean." Cas notes.
"Kiss me. Touch me."
Pic from Castiel
"I tried a casserole. But I went upstairs to do homework and forgot."
"Yes, please."
[22.12., 23:07] Dean: Yeah
LOL Cas
[17.2., 18:07] Castiel: Yes!!!
"Sam. Charly helped. The housing but books and cost of living is on us. Ok?" Dean explains.
"Good to know. I think I need to see Gabriel again. Get some Intel on you. And some pictures." Dean laughs.
Cas bites his lip.
She nods. "Go on."
[22.12., 14:19] Dean: Dont
"Oh?"
"I'd like that, yes!"
"I can come here and we go with just one car? I could grab us lunch on the way?"
[7.12., 21:21] Castiel: You don't like it?
[19.1., 16:19] Dean: Typo
"Deal. We'll let your daddy and my... Castiel figure out the details."
Dean leads over and kisses him. "I enjoy everything we do and have done and I very much would like to be on top. I just prefer some more foreplay? Kissing, cuddling and slowly working up to it."
[26.1., 10:34] Dean: Gabe will have to pay up now
Sam takes a deep breath. "It sounds insane doesn't it? Like they are intelligent and caring people but sound like a cult when talking about today."
[13.12., 19:19] Castiel: And then id hold your chin and turn your pretty face to me so i could kiss that precum off your sexy lips
"I could have had a car accident with my old car becausen no one would have told me to get it looked at... I could have burn out by now cause there's nothing to come home to and no one made me cut down hours to dedicate more time to art."
"Well, you do look terribly good in them. I think I have great taste."
"Yeah I think so." Dean nods. " This 2 cars thing is stupid. Wanna take mine for now?"
[15.12., 12:38] Dean: With a unicorn with blue hair
"Can't you hold a little spoon too?" Cas grins.
" ohhhh?" Dean goes to the living room. Santana and Lucifer have already curled up in the nest and are looking at him. "Oh my god you are amazing." He lets himself fall into it. "Fair warning. I may not get up again."
"Awwwe, thank you." Castiel takes the last stripes of bacon from the pan and places them on the plate with the others
[3.2., 11:35] Dean: 😘
Cas cries out softly.
[7.5., 10:21] Dean: Your house after work or mine? What's the plan?
"You two! Listen! Grip Strength. Lubrication.  Talk to each other about what you like and what works and what doesn't. Jerk off in front of each other in a show and tell kinda way."
When the door bell rings Cas is outside with Charlie. Dean is on his way to get more food for outside when he hears the door ring again. He puts his plates down and goes to answer the door.
"I ... I can feed you pie."
Cas nods. "That's my point. You give me so much freedom. And ... well..." he shrugs
He keeps moving slowly, enjoying the drag of fabric and the warmth and pressure from Cas.
Dean holds on to Cas' hip with his free hand and makes sure Cas doesn't go too deep. On one particular fast thrust in and out Dean loses focus for a split second and his finger slips into Cas.
[5.12., 22:16] Castiel: He told me to be careful and not to read too much into it.
Big spoon ( Cas) and little spoon ( Dean) roles are silently arranged and after setting alarms for the next day they snuggle in.
[5.12., 17:39] Castiel: I will never forgive myself that i made him drink
Dr Mills raises an eyebrow. Do you have any?"
[2.1., 22:46] Dean: Yuck
[12.1., 09:07] Dean: Whats your going hourly rate?
[1.3., 15:16] Castiel: Almost free... will come to the shop
Cas chuckles. "Let me work on it then."
"That's good. They didn't give you a hard time. Nice."
"No, sir. We also have this one here in hot pink and neon orange. It's unusual but we got all the rainbow colors in support of pride. My boss is showing his support to his eldest child. Kinda sweet if you ignore the insane parts." Mike laughs nervously.
Cas drives them home and parks in the drive way. The house is dark. "Looks like Sammy is in bed already." Dean points out.
[12.2., 19:01] Castiel: Getting started on the hot chocolate
"Did I do it wrong?" Cas asks low.
[4.12., 20:55] Dean: Not buying it
"Hmmm. You gonna put me in a food coma babe.'
"That's bullshit."
[4.12., 10:41] Castiel: Oh
[4.2., 07:51] Castiel: I hadn't known and I'd been at their place
"Good night Angel."
Dean is thankfully busy his whole shift until he gets home around 2 in the afternoon.
[5.12., 18:27] Castiel: We are still friends as far as I'm concerned
[3.3., 09:15] Castiel: Though I'd rather see your cute face
"It's not so much that you wouldn't have let that happen, but that i was  ready to let it happen." Cas sighs."I told her that I knew I had to say no if that had been what you wanted, but that it felt wrong, because you were hurting and needed me."
"Morning Angel. " Dean answers and kisses Cas neck to his ear.
[13.12., 20:04] Dean : Do you like being on top?
[5.12., 20:10] Dean: Huh?
[12.2., 08:40] Castiel: Yes
"Your Castiel?" Zeke raises his eyebrow. "Is something wrong?" He asks a little worried about their relationship status.
Cas takes hold of the hemline of Dean’s shirt and Dean raises his arms.
[24.12., 16:13] Dean: I wouldnt
"That would be mean. He wants to save up money, not spend it."
[7.12., 14:21] Dean: And you are right
Homework
[3.12., 12:21] Dean: Are you trying to find out where I live?
"You are mad cause you enjoyed it and it feels wrong? You think it shouldn't have felt as nice as it did?"
After they finish dinner and put the dishes away Dean asks Cas. "Are you going back to drawing or are you done for tonight?"
[2.12., 10:08] Dean: Killer smile
[4.12., 22:01] Dean: Maybe tomorrow?
Charly grins. "We might need another painting.  We've been on your website a lot lately."
Dean goes to get dressed. "If I go for like 30 min to an hour, think we can snuggle then without you losing too much time for the drawing?"
" Honey. Orgasms with you are mind blowing. You're my personal sex God."
[4.12., 21:41] Dean: I think Gabriel is wrong
Dean grabs Cas and pulls him closer. "We leave in 2 days. Want me to lay still for longer and let you count?"
[13.12., 12:21] Castiel: Same.
[15.2., 10:39] Dean: ....
"It's ok. We're fine. Finish up with your brother. I see you at home."
"Oh? You did?"
[26.12., 12:08] Castiel: Damn it feels good
[20.1., 09:36] Dean: We seem to be doing pretty well communicating via messages.
Dean sinks in his chair and hides his face. "Remember the one I cheated on to break up with instead of manning up? That's her."
[12.1., 18:05] Castiel: Should I?
[22.2., 09:06] Dean: Might need help with that if you are up for it.
[3.12., 21:50] Castiel: It's okay. Saves google time, i guess?
Dean is laughing out loud.
Dean walks out of the bedroom in front of Cas and reaches his hand back.
"I know. I am sorry. I am working on it."
[13.12., 15:51] Dean : Nice
[8.12., 12:15] Dean: Tell me
Dean wakes up too warm,  Castiel breathing into his neck and still on top of him. He tries to gently wiggle his way out from under his boyfriend without waking him. His alarm won't go off for another few minutes but he needs the bathroom.
[3.12., 11:07] Castiel: Exactly
[22.12., 22:19] Dean: He's from teen wolf
[24.5., 18:22] Benny: Ok
"Look Babe. We disturbed their nap." Dean smiles
[3.12., 12:54] Dean: So
Dean follows him into the bathroom. "Are we .. " Dean starts to ask when he looks at Cas in the mirror.  "Angel, why do you look like you've been crying?"
"For loving such a weirdo."
"Not now." Cas says low and kisses Dean's chest.
Sam rolls his eyes. "Really? Dean?"
[20.1., 09:37] Castiel: I don't remember,  i think i only wanted to know what to expect at my appointment.
Dean hums and gently runs his hand through Cas wet hair.
[22.1., 15:06] Dean: I just ditching out early today
[22.1., 11:30] Dean: Can we have one day just for us?
Dean grabs the clothes and starts to unbutton his pants. He shoves them down his hips and takes them off. Dean gently takes the soft pajama pants and steps into them. "No shirt?"
[26.5., 08:59] Castiel: Yeah, he texted asking if things were going okay, how the hotel was and if I was doing okay.
[31.3., 21:15] Dean: Hmm nice
"Yes."
"Hmmm?" Dean hums in question and gets undressed, making sure not to wrinkle his shirt.
[4.12., 22:05] Castiel: He's like you
[6.12., 19:59] Castiel: Well, i don't know about the page you found, but mine does come discreet
He pulls Cas closer. "Have I given you any indication that I expect more from you? Oh my god. Do you feel pressured by me into doing stuff you don't want to?"
"I am fine babe. Little pain isn't bad. " Dean winks and plops the ice pack on his head. "Kiss to make me feel better?"
"Oh!? That's fucked! She should have gotten a proper funeral! That kind of shit hasn't been an issue in our congregation for a few generations."
[15.12., 17:37] Dean: Almost done
"Wake up angel. Food time." Dean says softly.
Eventually they do clean up and head out to the couch with breakfast and coffee.
"Let me get some stuff for next week, then I'm ready."
[11.5., 17:53] Castiel: He even mentioned the possibility of a hive.
[3.3., 14:43] Castiel: I'd totally slip my hands inside that open overall and feel your pefectly shaped ass. Those gorgeous tight globes.
[31.3., 11:24] Dean: Looking back at the past few months, what's been your favorite sex related thing we've done?
[5.12., 20:24] Castiel: In a heartbeat
Cas grins and starts setting the table.
[3.2., 15:34] Castiel: Thanks Donna! 😚
[25.12., 15:04] Dean: Lol
Dean nods.
"Only tempting?"
He closes the door, locks it and runs to his car.
[28.1., 16:08] Castiel: Drive home when i could work for Rufus…
[31.1., 21:57] Dean: 😘😇🥰
[4.12., 16:15] Castiel: Once I'm home
[13.12., 16:20] Dean : Just the dough
Dean moves and starts licking up the cum splatter on Cas' stomach gently.He moves further down where most of the mess landed and laps at the skin.
[4.12., 10:36] Dean: CASTIEL
[4.12., 19:37] Castiel: If I were you, I read it, because it sounds like a silent plea to be there for him after all
[2.1., 23:02] Castiel: 😆
"Can... can you .. like the other night? Make me come? Please?"
Dean laughs.  And texts Cas.
"I'll try."
Dean walks inside. "Honey I am hooooome."
"I am proud of you. That must have been hard."
"You didn't."
"Yes, we can."
"Along with our wedding?"
He drives them to the nearest Walmart and parks close to the entrance. "I ... this is torture. I love it." He smiles. " but no worries. No floaty thoughts."
[7.12., 21:05] Dean: If God wanted me to fly if have wings
"Don't you think it's funny that you have your boyfriend meet a monarchy on Independence Day?" Gabe asks Castiel while he hands Dean a spare set of protective wear.
Dean gently runs his finger around Cas' rim. "So red. And still so open." He mumbles to himself and licks into Cas, chasing his own taste.
" I am changing the locks. Bolting the windows. Maybe see if I can invest in safety glas. For downstairs."
[15.12., 18:54] Dean: I just scrolled all the way up to make sure
[28.12., 18:44] Castiel: How would he know if i called stop if he doesn't even ask
[22.12., 13:44] Dean: I should have asked first
[1.2., 10:16] Castiel: ?
"It feels really good." Dean whines.
[7.1., 17:25] Dean: You don't have to
"What kind of vacation do you want? "
"Yay." Dean grabs Cas hand and leads him to the car. I was going to leave baby here to I can put her on summer tires tomorrow. Take me home?"
"I was hoping it'd get me more than just one cup of coffee..."
[6.12., 16:11] Castiel: What are you getting at?
"Weird details?  Dangers of anal?"
[26.12., 12:10] Dean: Fuck
I know you helped Dean, now help me!!!!
"This is an odd mixture of relaxing And arousing. " Dean mumbles.
"Honey, he was so obviously flirting..."
"Tea please."
[4.2., 11:55] Castiel: Hmm, true
[7.1., 17:57] Dean: I am nervous.
Cas gets himself more coffee and watches Dean's face for a reaction.
"Not for long."
Dean blushes. "It's cute. The bee reminded me of you."
He feels the air change behind him.
"I love you too."
[28.1., 12:20] Anael: Did he fire you?
"Good night, Freckles."
"Good night, Freckles."
[13.12., 18:22] Castiel: Are right. That's a very nice picture in my head
[27.5., 08:59] Castiel: What distracted you?
"I see." Cas nods.
[4.12., 13:43] Castiel: Sounds like grocery shopping
Ezekiel smiles. "Hello Castiel.  Dean. Thank you for inviting me over."
[4.12., 18:54] Castiel: Uh... he's gonna graduate this year and wants to do something with organic farming
"But so do I."
[6.12., 22:24] Castiel: I'm touching myself.
"Yes. Yes. I am ok. With it."
"Sleeping from morning to early evening is not how it should be. Let's sleep."
"I'm just pulling your pig tails babe  "
Dean laughs and hands the note to Castiel.
Dean laughs. "I buy candy or a dog toy as a spur of the moment thing. My boyfriend buys a  cock cage. That is amazing. I love y- it."
[4.2., 12:07] Dean: Yes
[24.12., 22:40] Castiel: Yes!
"I can bring him home if it doesn't work."
"Hi."
"Eww, really?"
[6.12., 13:15] Dean: Oh what for
"But you're not causing all our problems."
[3.12., 21:35] Dean: Or should I draw you a picture
"He's caught up now. That's his last for today."
"Shut up. This is important." Dean scolds him.
"No. They'll be fine with me in sweats. "
"I ... I haven't? You sent messages?" Cas ask's surprised. Tana comes to sniff Gabriel.
[8.12., 10:28] Castiel: Why would you want to talk to him?
"I really hope that the year working and living on his own helps. He's good for Jack."
Cas licks his cock.
"I thought you like to hear me?" Dean grins and kisses back.
[4.12., 13:13] Castiel: Are you okay? Do you want me to stop texting you?
"If you want your own business and not waste loads of money on people like Balthazar or me, yes."
[26.4., 10:38] Castiel: Oh dear.
"Good."
[4.12., 18:41] Castiel: Oh... uh...
[22.12., 14:19] Dean: Nooo
[1.2., 22:24] Castiel: Miss you too.
"You stole the bunny?"
Dean blushes.  "I wouldn't do this for just anyone so I guess you are the special one."
"Do you want me to stay on the phone, Babe?"
Gabriel is sitting at the table downstairs. Pie in the middle on a large plate. Vanilla ice cream next to it and 4 mugs. 3 full with steaming hot chocolate and one empty but used.
"Give it a try."
Cas massages him gently while Dean rocks on his knees and fucks back onto the fingers. He moves his hand and adds his ringfinger, hissing through the stretch.
"No worries. Now you get to awkwardly watch me set up breakfast."
[3.1., 00:37] Castiel: I think Dad too, but he ain't happy about it
"I got a call today. Your number one college is giving you a full ride including  student housing."
[5.12., 18:38] Castiel: That's very gross
"How did they fix it?"
"You are."
[7.12., 18:35] Castiel: I didn't tske you for the kind
"I... it's just the way I walk." Castiel says confused. He's never been accused of walking too quiet. He doesn't understand why Dean isn't happy that he doesn't make a lot of noise.
Cas just hiccups on a new wave of tears.
[6.12., 22:43] Dean: I mean that I haven't come this hard ever in my life
[27.1., 16:35] Castiel: Oh shit. I gotta go grocery shopping
[15.12., 10:08] Dean: Like officially
"Coming." Cas grins and grabs Dean's hand.
He's still cooped up. Now in his clean room.
[7.12., 11:08] Castiel: Who to talk about with better than her?
He spreads Cas legs and settles between his thighs.  "Oh god. Your stockings rubbing against me... fuck." He leans down and kisses Cas passionately.
Dean smiles and grabs Cas cock with the hand covered in his own cum and spreads it all over before he licks and sucks just the head and jerks the rest.
"The studio is all yours. I won't go in there without your ok. I'd like the garage to be my space please. I've got a bunch of tools and parts for baby in there."
"You looked more surprised than me." Dean leans over and whispers in Cas' ear. "But fuck if you aren't pretty when you come."
"This is delicious babe. Thank you." Dean says between bites.
Dean wiggles his butt.
"What's so funny?" Cas inquires.
"Would it make you feel calmer?"
"Most of the time, yes. Sometimes people can't list 10 things or it gets hurtful. That's not fun."
[3.12., 12:02] Castiel: He wanted to say hello
"You gonna wake me up with neck kisses again?"
[3.3., 16:56] Dean: Ok
[8.12., 21:00] Castiel: Is there anything I can help with without you having to share company secrets?
[27.4., 09:22] Castiel: Oh shit!!!!
Cas giggles.
"I've quit my job."
Deans cock spurts weakly as he comes with a shout. Castiel is keeping pressure on his prostate and it feels like Dean's orgasm doesn't stop. "Fuck! Cas! Yes!"
[3.1., 00:37] Dean: Mom knew
Cas moves on to the next hive.
"I will do my best to not let him hurt me. I will talk to him and will tell you if anything feels wrong, okay?"
[25.12., 21:46] Castiel: That's awesome
[26.5., 08:59] Dean: I'd love to know what he had to do that was so important
[24.2., 16:49] Castiel: Yeah
"Are you ready?  Bathroom stop? "
Cas takes a deep breath. "I haven't said yes to Gabe yet. What if he doesn't want me anymore?" He asks while he opens his email server.
"Fuck, don't. God. Yes. Like that. There." Cas babbles.
Dean is unsure of what to do after they all say down. He is looking around for clues.
[2.12., 12:11] hot stuff: Oh. So I am to start the game YOU suggested?
[8.12., 10:55] Dean: I was a mess back then
[26.12., 10:36] Castiel: Good.
" I am an idiot babe. I am so so sorry. "
Cas nods.
"But I'll go to bed with you tonight and I'll have coffee ready before I wake you up.  OK?"
"Traffc lights? That be easiest? Green for ok, yellow for wait and red for stop?"
[27.4., 09:24] Castiel: Okay.
https://whatsappfic.tumblr.com/post/636547155078873088
Dean leads them into the rest stop Cafe. They get seated in the corner booth and Lizzy the waitress hands them fresh coffee and menus.
[3.12., 09:07] Castiel: No. I mean. If he wasn't your brother, would you still support him?
Cas rummages through his nightstand then Dean's. When he finds what he's looking for he runs back down and crawls back into the nest tent.
[22.12., 11:19] Dean: That sounds like a good plan. I think he'd enjoy that. I can already see him in your apple tree. Thankfully its not tall and we could get him down if needed.
"Yeah."
[4.2., 22:37] Dean: I adore you angel 😇
Dean gets called in first. As he leaves he catches Castiel's attention and pulls up his pants leg just enough to show Cas his bi pride flag socks. He winks and heads into Missouri's office.
[24.2., 09:07] Dean: Nice
"She's a mad woman." Cas says once in the car.
Dean snorts. "Maybe you knocked me up."
"Fine, we'll stay on our continent then."
Cas threads his fingers in Dean’s hair.
"You want to see cock flopping side to side?"
Claire raises an eyebrow and looks at her parents.
"Your dog needs to pee... you need fresh air. I'll be right by your side."
"Good. I like when you come."
[27.12., 21:23] Castiel: You look beautiful
[27.5., 09:13] Dean: Welcome home surprise. You'll see tonight.
[3.3., 08:35] Dean: Statistics
[5.2., 09:58] Castiel: I miss you so much.
"You don't. But this is a challenge.  All I know is that it's vegetables. Could be 8 pounds of tomatoes and one single potato for all I know. Sounds like fun."
[27.12., 20:54] Dean: Uhm
[6.12., 15:12] Dean: I hope that didn't hurt your feelings
Dean lays down in a pile of blankets and wiggles around to get comfortable. 9nce he is happy he grabs Castiel and pulls him on top of him and wraps his arms and legs around him. "Squid hug." He tells him
"Me too but I get to sleep in." Dean smiles and pets Cas' hair. "Good night Angel. I love you."
"Hi angel. Sorry Rufus called you out today."
"Yeah. I've been wondering the same, actually." Cas sighs.
I don't think we should work together until we have resolved whatever stands between us right now.
[2.12., 12:11] hot stuff: Alright.
[1.2., 10:10] Dean: Yeah and now he is struggling. I think he likes the idea but doesn't want to leave his secure future. But man he is good. So so good.
Dean laughs at Cas' answer and rocks his hips harder.
Castiel’s hips move too, rubbing against Dean.
[27.4., 12:42] Castiel: Uh.
Cas smiles at him."Such a good boy." He says softly.
"But he knows I'm here with you."
[13.12., 14:35] Dean : Stand your ground
"That's fine. Absolutely fine. I was just worried you might not have wanted them on your arms."
He places his hands on his knees. "You're such a teasing brat." Cas sighs. I wanted to spoil you today, but look at me now: desperately, aching hard because my boyfriend can't eat..."
Cas looks at Dean's precum pooling on his stomach.
[3.2., 22:32] Dean: 😘😇sweet dreams
[4.12., 21:18] Dean: I can be oblivious to being flirted with
Dean calls Charly. Its his best idea of the day and he hopes she can make sense of his thoughts and help him fix this.
"Na, thanks." Cas smiles.
Dean whines and looks around. He spots the bottle next to Cas' foot and stretches to grab it. He pours some of it on his fingers before he hands it to Castiel.  He pushes his lubed up fingers into Cas. "Found it."
"Fine. . . Thank you for attending for me. Please take the time away to think this over. I don't want to argue. I don't like it. "
[25.12., 16:39] Dean: Angel
[8.3., 14:24] Dean: Ok
[5.12., 20:25] Dean: Charlynus calling
[4.1., 23:11] Dean: 😚😘😇
"And if I allowed you?"
[27.12., 20:53] Castiel: Why not tonight?
" Oh fuck. Thank you babe. FUCK!"
[27.1., 14:51] Dean: Are you hiding from Sam?
[3.3., 13:46] Dean: Yes
[4.12., 09:53] Dean: Difference was tho that they put up videos online
[22.12., 15:16] Castiel: Which part?
"As I said, half your dessert, babe. Blow me, but don't make me come."
[26.12., 15:21] Castiel: You're a dork...
"Then yes. I'd like cuddles. Let me siphon of your heat, please."
It takes another 30 minutes for them to find everything and pack up the car.
[4.12., 11:32] Dean: My Google search history is looking strange
Cas smiles around Dean's cock.
[15.2., 07:17] Dean: Have fun at work. When do you get off now?
"Once you 2 are more comfortable... with each other and sex we will revisit the last slide. Toys and kinks."
Dean walks to the backstage door in a haze and knocks. The bouncer looks him up and down and Dean explains who he wants to talk to. The mountain of muscles nods and closes the door in his face without a word.
"Oh OK. Good. That is awesome. She'll be thrilled. Anything else before we dig into your homework?"
Suddenly the house is empty again save for Cas,  Dean and Charlie.
"Elbow. They taste the best."
[13.12., 20:23] Dean : Up for you in the air
"Hmmm, yeah. Maybe."
[3.12., 22:22] Dean: My first class is at 8
[4.12., 21:22] Dean: I am like the token straight guy within my friendships
"Eat your waffles, dirty boy." Cas laughs and gets back in bed.
Cas licks and sucks each finger as dirty as he can.
[26.12., 14:48] Dean: Can I come over?
[3.12., 09:47] Dean: Bi?
"Let me just enjoy the sight a few more seconds." Cas says grabbing Dean by the lapels of the overall.
[13.12., 20:41] Dean : I'm not pleased
[5.12., 11:03] Castiel: Then yes
"What do you want, Babe?" Cas asks softly.
"Check the cupboard for a thermos. Pretty sure Sam made coffee before he left." Dean calls after him."
[7.12., 14:22] Dean: Out of fear
[7.12., 09:25] Dean: Maybe
[4.3., 11:16] Castiel: He's an old friend of mine from Bible Camp! He just moved back into town with his family.
Dean looks confused for a few seconds. "Well damn it. I almost got myself into a very awkward situation."
[15.12., 20:23] Dean: Gell in live yet?
"Too bad. I would've preferred to see your face while I fuck you."
Cas kisses him dirty.
"Yay. Come here."
Castiel gets ready for work and sits down with Dean for a cup of coffee before he heads off.
"Mmmmh... uh... no. Well, there was this boy i kissed in kindergarten." Charlie says.
[31.3., 13:08] Dean: Garth just asked me if I am running a fever cause I look flushed and sweaty
[13.12., 17:47] Dean : Ok
[14.6., 13:29] Castiel: Keep hydrated
"I see. You know what sucks too?"
You ask to touch me. But touching you has only been me asking you if I could  you haven't shown or mentioned any want to be touched in any shape or form."
"That'd be annoyingly loud on a floor like this." Castiel frowns.
Cas leans down and bites on Dean's neck.
"Fuck." He mutters as he crawls out of the fort and Dean can hear him running upstairs - after yelling "one minute!" at whomever's at the door -to put on sweat pants and a t shirt then he runs back down and opens the door.
"Uh... yeah, okay."
[16.2., 11:53] Dean: I think I am dying... farewell my dear
[5.12., 17:35] Castiel: You sure?
"I just want to sleep. If I can."
Dean leans back and relaxes. Cas licks Dean's chest clean, trying to do it as innocently as possible.
Dean rubs his back and pulls him closer. "It's ok babe. I am here. You're awake now. That's good. "
[7.1., 12:03] Dean: Uhm
[13.12., 19:58] Castiel: You were faster…
Charlie kisses her cheek. "That was very courageous, Love." She smiles.
"I don't know. I won't come and wouldn't appreciate it if you didn't push on."
"I adore you too." Dean hangs up and stares at his phone. 'I love you so much.' He thinks to himself and smiles. He grabs his stuff and runs to his next class.
"That sounds good."
"Anal is a straight thing too. Just no prostate."
Dean moans happily at the stretch and pushes back against Cas to get him deeper faster.
"You're not a piece of shit.  And I like you swearing. " Dean smiles. "I think it's adorable when you swear and it's really hot in the bedroom..."
"Urgh. Come on fuzzball." He grumps" Lay down till my alarm.
Dean chuckles and trails his fingers over Castiel's chest. "I think I learned something. Wanna know what?"
"Thank you so much for coming tonight. Sorry to throw you at my complete social circle right the first time we socially meet again."
"Oh, alright." Cas nods and lays on the bed.
[7.12., 21:34] Dean: And life
[7.12., 21:20] Castiel: You know what goes perfect with Christmas movies if it's not a work night?
[13.12., 18:58] Dean : Thanknyou
"Babe...
Dorothy and Dean go to the couch with their plates and turn on Netflix.
[12.1., 11:36] Castiel: You could or you would?
[23.12., 01:09] Castiel: 😘
[6.12., 22:27] Dean: Masage
"Yeah. I get that. Let's see. Do you think Gabe would mind if we locked the door? I think I'd feel better if it was locked."
"No big deal. I might have a trip for Cas coming up soon so you guys get away with asking for more cuddle time. I'll know more tomorrow or Monday and let Cassie know."
"If I really don't want to, I can tell him i don't want sex and he'll accept it."
[5.1., 16:22] Dean: Dinner and seduction?
[13.1., 10:04] Dean: I am glad I could be of service…
"So Charly, what spot would you like me to wax."
[26.1., 10:16] Dean: Talk to Charly.
[22.1., 17:52] Castiel: Okay, critters packed, fridge packed... anything else?
"Honey muffin?" Dean holds one out to him.
Dean listens and nods. "I can't even imagine what your family went through. Well sort off. John isn't the cuddly type if you get what I mean. You need to at least trust him even if you have a hard time trusting me. I am willing to forget the file ever happened to be in your hands if you try to trust me."
[2.12., 21:22] Dean: I think its your turn again.
[8.12., 08:31] Dean: Same.
[6.12., 20:48] Dean: I got that
"Ok. " Dean nods.
"What?"
Dean hugs him tight.  "Don't be scared of weather or not or sex life is enough. If I jerk off alone for the rest of my life,  that's OK as long as I get to spend it with you. "
"Hmmm."
[1.2., 10:40] Gabriel: I'd hope there is some extra activity in your life now that Dean is in it.
"Fuck, I love Sunday." Cas moans deeply.
Dean is putting the finishing touches on dinner when Castiel comes back.
[29.4., 16:08] Dean: I just like seeing your face
Cas sighs. "Yeah, okay."
"So you'd watch it too?"
[24.12., 16:06] Dean: Stay away from the tree before someone puts you up there
Dean smiles. "Or maybe I just know my brother and know how he thinks. Let's eat before the pizza refreezes."
"You are. Sorry, but that was just too inviting."
"Oh. Okay. Yeah. We can do that."
[2.12., 19:49] Dean: No no no. Like alarms. They are super smart and can be trained as scouts. They are fast and quiet and can alert the group if zombies are near
"Here? Wouldn't that be more comfortable in bed?"
"Invested in a cock cage... well he did. That helps."
Dean leans forward and sucks him into his mouth moaning.
"Good. Okay, listen. Get yourself a glass of water. Best you drink one first then take a full one back to the couch with you."
"Morning my Love." Cas says softly.
[13.12., 20:37] Dean : I don't want to move
[1.2., 10:17] Gabriel: Ok
Dean closes his eyes and let's Castiel roam his hands over skin. He hums content.
Cas looks up from his cup in surprise and looks at Dean. Then he looks at Sam. "But ask Gabriel too."
Dean plays with Cas fingers and says. "I hope we're home by then. It's nice here. But it's a lot of people all the time. How did you do it?  It was just you and Lucy when we met."
[26.5., 09:03] Castiel: I do not need to.
[15.12., 19:53] Dean: I let you finish your movie
[27.5., 06:28] Castiel: I'm already on my way downtown.
"Yes." Cas sighs softly and runs his hands over Dean's arms.
I asked him. Jack and I are in and I asked benny. I let you know
"I know its an out of nowhere question it's just been stuck in my head all day."
"Shhhh! Shut that kind of talk right now. You're an amazing man. You do so very much for everyone. You make great meals and I'm looking forward to eating red pancakes."
The first to arrive are Gabriel, Donna and Claire.
[6.12., 21:30] Dean: No worries
Cas texts Dean that he is going back to work on the art commission after instead of coming to the garage.
Lisa dances towards their table and towards Castiel. She waves and winks at him before blowing a kiss and dancing to the other side of the stage.
[1.4., 14:37] Castiel: 😄
He gets up and kisses Cas on the cheek after greeting Ezekiel.  "Hey babe. Ready for lunch?"
"I don't know how to explain it. Garth go to church?"
"I'll miss you too." Dean says and kisses Cas. "I am meeting Sam tomorrow so I don't think when I'll be home. I am not sure if we can see each other tomorrow."
"That's okay."
[26.12., 09:07] Castiel: I hope so too.
[4.12., 19:43] Dean: I did
"No. I like your voice and I  noticed I sleep better if I fall asleep to your reading. You don't have to if it bores you though."
"Whatever you need. Anything really... well marriage is a bit soon but yeah. I am not leaving, especially not because of something as trivial as sex."
Dean waits. "There is a 'but' coming isn't there?"
Cas lets go of Dean so they can move and they head upstairs to the bedroom together. Dean cleans himself up in the bathroom and puts the panties in a bowl to soak. He manages to take the bra of and leaves it with the laundry before he walks into the bedroom naked and crawls into bed.
"Very OK. Just a bit distracting. "
[26.12., 17:41] Dean: Or du you want to peel yourself of the couch and join us
"Fuck! Angel."
Cas stares at his cat. "What the fuck? He used to be up my ficus..."
"I can't kiss you?"
[8.12., 20:34] Castiel: Unfortunately I had forgotten my phone at home
"Be naked." Castiel calls after him.
[3.2., 09:35] Dean: I remember very little of that night.... but no. He is bigger than me.
Cas beams and feeds Dean.
[13.12., 21:10] Dean : I really liked having something there
[7.1., 14:04] Dean: Not your fault
Cas grabs Dean's hand as he heads inside to put the flowers in a vase.
"Cas... this is amazing. Oh my god." Dean leans over the table and kisses him.
"Let's lay down."
[5.1., 11:45] Dean: After being burned by your ex
[4.12., 09:34] Castiel: I didn't mean to sound like a creep
"Hmmmm. But so worth it." Dean hums and soaps up Cas's back and ass. He runs soapy fingers through his crack to make sure he gets everything clean.
"I have news. Various news. And I am kinda excited."
[22.12., 22:03] Dean: Some wine
Dean sits and waits. Cas comes back fully dressed.
"Fine. I adult too."
Dean wakes up with Castiel's alarm. He grumbles and rolls over to wrap himself around Cas. "Morning."
"Yeah, me too."
[25.3., 12:39] Dean: How is your day
Cas mirrors him and runs his hand over Dean's chest. "So handsome. So sexy."
[7.12., 19:03] Castiel: Yes.
[4.12., 12:23] Castiel: Why it does for you i cannot say
"We can't stay for long. School and work tomorrow."
[5.12., 21:30] Dean: Remeber
[26.12., 20:50] Dean: Or a pasta dish
[3.1., 00:41] Dean: I think the daughter knows too
Charlie smiles widely. "Oh Handmaiden, I'm so, so happy for you." She looks at Dorothy.  "Yes, I'm sure. Bi's are legit!"
[13.12., 08:23] Dean : Ohhh
[6.12., 22:39] Dean: Yes
Cas bucks his hips.
"I mean... if you had wanted that, I would have probably done it, because you needed me."
[5.12., 11:06] Dean: Just lazy
"Everything is sticky." Dean whines. "Come on. Help me peel it off please? You look amazing too."
[5.12., 13:16] Castiel: Alright
"Thanks, Sam."
"Yes." Cas nods.
Cas looks at him worried. "Babe, you okay?"
"Yeah. Kiss me to make me feel better?"
Dean looks at Castiel and sighs. "Damn it. You look delicious and we don't have time."
"Fuck yes, Dean. Yes. God, that's so gay honey."
[26.12., 14:47] Dean: And I hope you'll learn that wanting stuff is good and that you can have it.
Benni shrugs.
[15.12., 23:26] Dean: I nodded of on the.couch
[13.12., 12:43] Castiel: Oh?
[13.12., 13:26] Castiel: I'm sorry.
[5.12., 18:00] Dean: He wasn't talking much
[27.1., 22:10] Dean: I think they need the basic knowledge and then we can let them know there is more. I'm sure both have watched porn and are not innocent about it.
[26.1., 10:22] Dean: How is your hand
Dean takes his pants off completely as the front is soaked and he doesn't want to put them back on. He walks to the bathroom to clean himself up and comes back with a warm washcloth and wipes down Castiel.
[5.1., 10:43] Castiel: Apart from my co workers i don't know any accountants.
[22.12., 19:38] Castiel: None
[4.12., 21:30] Dean: Make friends
"Uh, you're welcome?" Castiel chuckles. "It's so weird without the fur babies."
"True." Cas agrees. "PBJs?"
[24.2., 13:44] Dean: This will be the best oil change I ever did
[6.12., 21:46] Castiel: No. Should I?
[8.12., 12:13] Castiel: Why?
Dean wakes up to the smell of coffee and looks around confused for a minute before he remembers where he is and what happened yesterday.
Dean doesn't let go the entire time except for when he needs to clean up after his dog. Then he is back to holding on to Cas like a life line.
"Honey, I'm home!" Cas calls out when he comes in.
[7.1., 12:10] Castiel: I'm very scared.
[7.12., 14:28] Dean: I was not awake enough to react calmly
"It's important. And I don't want my Jack to get hurt." Cas says earnestly.
[27.4., 09:26] Castiel: Yeah
[3.4., 14:23] Castiel: He's not. Now he's having a nervous breakdown feeling obliged to come along and won't accept my offer to back out.
"Then don't be sorry." Dean kisses his cheek.
"Yeah, take care of my little devil." Cas kisses his head.
[3.12., 20:33] Dean: Since we are sharing
[22.1., 15:54] Dean: You or me?
[21.1., 16:11] Castiel: "So, how warm and comfy?"
Dean keeps rubbing Cas' back up and down making sure to stay away,  far away from the edge of the shorts Castiel is wearing.
[23.1., 09:37] Dean: Want me to go super slow so I am still horny and ready when you get here?
[15.2., 09:06] Dean: I really really like when you get loud during sex.
Dean's entire body goes stiff and with a loud moan he comes between their bodies. All strength out of his muscles, his legs fall off of Cas' hips.
[6.12., 12:46] Dean: Yeah
Garth chuckles watching them bicker.
Dean shakes his head. "Not everything."
"Take care." Gabe waves.
[26.12., 14:41] Dean: Im confuswd
"Okay, yes."
[6.12., 20:46] Castiel: I might be wearing those tonight. Because I had thought we had a date and I wanted to feel like i actually dressed for a date
Gabriel knocks. "May I? "
Dean stares at Castiel.  "Oh shit. You're serious."
Cas looks confused.
"Good night, Freckles."
Dean has his hands everywhere. He strokes over Castiel's back, grabs his hips and his ass. His hips are moving in aborted thrusts under Cas.
[3.12., 22:09] Dean: Her parents came home i threw on my pants, grabbed the rest of my clothes and ditched out of the window.
Cas rolls over.
"Okay."
Castiel shakes his head. "No. But ... but somehow, I don't know, I feel like you feel you have to hold yourself back for my sake."
"Oh fuck babe. So hard. So hard for me. I can't wait for you to fuck me."
"Should we put up some paintings too?"
[6.12., 16:57] Dean: Oh
"Awesome. Thank you. I brought vanilla ice cream, chocolate and birthday cake. "
Dean undresses and hangs the wet clothes up to dry and gets into the tub, waiting for Castiel.
Cas kisses back deeply.
Dean recounts the situation and tells them what happened when they picked up the car and he talked to Gabe.
[3.2., 15:45] Donna: Ohhhhh mean. You know I am terrible with keeping happy secrets.
They towel off and Dean lays down on the bed. "Go on without me. I'll stay here and wait for you."
Cas laughs. "Fine, yeah. Hot pink sounds fun."
Cleaning up together is fast. After, they go walk Santana and cuddle on the couch once they are back home.
[28.12., 18:51] Dean: And he won't be made
[6.12., 19:32] Dean: My brain is fried
"You wanted it. I thought you knew what you got yourself into."
[8.12., 10:52] Dean: I've been in 1 relationship
"Yeah. That doesn't mean you are forcing yourself to do stuff you don't want to do. Yes. I like it. A lot. Definitely more than you but I don't need you to pretend for me. Is... that was happened the other day... our sex Sunday? Did you only do it cause I wanted it? Did you even enjoy it? Is that why you didn't... didn't finish at night? Was that just for me?"
He’s barely distinguishable from the crashing waves, the bullet-rattle of rain hitting the ocean far out from their cover of pine boughs, and Dean wants to lean in to catch his words but he feels himself draw back instead. Draw himself still.
“Cas,” Dean whispers—that voice, precious to Castiel in a way that he doesn’t have words to describe, not in all the world’s languages—and collapses into Castiel. He hits Castiel like a comet hits the earth, and Castiel takes him into his center. Castiel bends his foundation around him.
day 8: leather and lace
The quiet of the kitchen draws around them like a blanket, and Dean blinks, slow.
Cas is silent for too long, and Dean breaks his own rule and looks at him.
He drives the last four hours to the coast without stopping, Cas quiet at his side.
It’s a Sunday, and this sleepy little town—down one werewolf, thanks to Dean and Cas, not that any of its residents will ever know that—is pretty much barren as Dean eases Baby down the main drag. Dean figures most everybody’s in church; it seems like that kinda place.
When he glances back at the corner, the Empty wearing Cas is gone.
When he catches Cas’s gaze it’s so soft that Dean feels it in his chest.
Dean swallows, throat suddenly dry. He likes the width of Cas’s shoulders pushing up against that dark suit. Likes it real well.
With the life they’ve led together, it’s not an unreasonable fear.
Sam and Jack are on them immediately, Sam talking worriedly a mile a minute, Jack beaming as he vaults himself forward into Cas’s arms. Dean doesn’t have any time to orient himself before Cas pulls his hand away and uses it to gather Jack in close to his chest; his hand feels horribly empty for a moment before Sam is ducking down into his line of sight and taking Dean’s shoulders in his hands.
The ocean swells and crashes and swells again.
Dean holds Cas’s hand tight enough to feel bone shifting beneath his skin as they walk back the direction Dean came.
Cas huffs a soft laugh. “You’re hardly middle-aged when I meet you, Dean,” he says, and touches the knob of Dean’s wrist where it pokes out beneath his jacket sleeve. “And it’s… it’s certainly not that simple. Though, ultimately, it is you that I choose to ‘pal around with,’ much to the dismay of basically every other celestial force in this universe. And a few earthly ones, too.”
“What’s it gonna take?” Dean asks. His throat is raw, tight and burning. “I ain’t giving up. I’ll ask you every day until I die, and after that I’ll crawl my way out of Hell until I find you and ask you then. You will
It’s a lie, and looking at Cas, he knows it. He is touching Dean in one of his most vulnerable places, one of those places that nobody has ever touched with such care; his fingers skim the curve of Dean’s last rib, where the claw marks end, and his palm brushes the softness of Dean’s stomach, and Dean has both hands wound up in the front of Cas’s shirt before he means to.
“Sit still,” Sam snaps. He’s angry. He hasn’t met Dean’s gaze since he made sure he wasn’t dead.
He is staring at the place where Cas’s pulse leaps, so human, in the hollow of his throat. He can’t look up, but Cas dips his chin down to meet his eyes anyway.
Dean should ask.
thank you all so much for reading! your comments have kept me going these past few months<3
The thought slides in like a knife between two ribs: Cas’s careful hands and his soft mouth and the way he looks at Dean like there’s nothing so good on earth as him. The way he lets Dean get closer and closer, has never once stopped him.
He is surprised that the words aren’t ashy on his tongue. He is surprised that he feels no anger when he looks at Jack, who could bring everyone back except for the one person Dean wants so badly he’s doubled over with it; Jack, who used to have Lucifer crouched behind his eyes when Dean looked at him, and now has only Castiel.
“Dean,” Cas says, low. Dean can feel the rumble of his voice in his throat. “Let’s go home.”
Dean would give him anything. Dean can’t give him this.
“Jesus,” says Dean.
“Jesus,” Dean mutters, too unsteady to be the growl he wants it to be. “You fucker.”
The quiet stretches so long that Dean thinks Cas isn’t gonna answer, and it’s not really anger that Dean feels, but it’s all he knows how to show. “Forget it,” he says, sharp, pushing his leg off the seat and turning around even though he’s sore all over. “Don’t know why I asked.”
“That’s a good thing, I hope,” he says.
Wasn’t anybody around to watch him, anyway. He made damn sure of that.
That’s it. No update on how he’s doing, no questions about Dean. Not so much as a fucking exclamation point.
It feels good to wake up held by Cas.
He’s slipping into a fresh one, trying not to lift his arms too high and jostle the still-healing mess of his ribs, when he feels Cas come up behind him.
The lamplight sets him blazing gold, framing his face like a halo. Dean holds onto his hand.
Dean stands alone. He’s a few yards beyond where Jack and Sam have crowded, with the smoking remnants of a spell that Castiel really doesn’t care to examine at the moment at his feet. His arms hang at his sides, and his face is very pale; he bleeds freely from both palms, reminiscent of stigmata, dark scarlet blood flowing in rivulets down his fingertips.
Either way, the four of them pile into the Impala once more, Jack in the passenger seat now that Sam is driving and Dean and Cas are settled in the back.
the Empty says.
They’ll be alright.
They were gone for almost twenty four hours, Sam says. Time must run different in the Empty like it does in Heaven and Hell, because it didn’t feel that long when Dean was there—and at the same time it felt longer than eternity. He’s sitting on the foot of his bed, Cas pressed up close to his side because Dean won’t let go of him, and he’s so fucking exhausted that he barely keep his eye open.
please note the warning change!
“Don’t, man,” Dean whispers.
there is blood ground into the saltbush carpet of this motel
“You rescued me,” Cas murmurs.
Dean wakes up when the rain has turned to pale heavy fog, when the storm-darkness of the sky has been replaced by evening.
Cas grins.
Dean wakes up.
It’s not a question, but Dean nods anyway. He finishes his beer.
Sam says he’s being too reckless. Dean doesn’t give a shit.
Dean is blinded by the sudden light, his elbow smarts where it hit the floor, there are voices filling the room.
Dean thinks Cas knows.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs into the breath of space between them. Dean pulls back far enough to see his eyes—those gorgeous goddamn eyes—as Cas lifts a hand. He traces a thumb along the swell of Dean’s bottom lip, as careful as if he were touching something made of glass. “Are you—you can’t really be here.”
Castiel restrains a smile. “Reading to pass the time,” he says. He takes a look at the book propped open in front of him, which he hasn’t really been paying much attention to. “A book on Grecian spellwork.”
Cas gives him that look—that
He wants to tell Dean that there’s no need for memorization. That if Dean likes, Castiel will be here every day for the rest of his time for Dean to look upon.
Dean’s hand comes down weighty on Castiel’s wrist, just holding him there. He works his jaw for a moment, words caught up.
A bird alights on the rocky beach a few yards down from them, quick and light, like a smudge of white paint on the horizon. Dean drinks again. The bird is gone.
Something in Dean’s face breaks open at the word, as if he’s been hit. He takes a stumbling step forward, weak like his knees have better things to do than hold him steady, but that doesn’t matter because between this breath and the next Castiel is crossing to him, gathering Dean up in his arms.
and in front of you on a bed that wails with rusty springs sits a man with holy light spilling out of him.
Even now, Castiel realizes. Even now, after everything, Dean thinks of love as a beautiful untouchable concept he may only view, like a child yearning for a toy through the window of a department store. Doesn’t he understand that this family’s love, all of it, belongs to him? Doesn’t he understand that if love were a tangible object then Castiel would drape Dean in his, wrap him up so he wouldn’t go a day without the warmth of it on his skin?
day 4: secrets
“You’re shivering,” Cas says. There’s not much inflection to the statement, but Dean catches the undertones anyway: he’s worried. He’s wondering.
Cas’s throat makes a quiet sound when he swallows. “This is real,” he says softly.
Dean dreams of the empty room sometimes. The gutting loss of him.
Emerging on the other side of the treeline, this slate-colored shore seems perfect.
He slips a hand away from Cas’s face and brings it down to where his fingers are woven above his breastbone. Cas’s eyelashes flutter when Dean lifts one of his hands, but they don’t part; when Dean brings Cas’s palm to his mouth Cas makes a quiet sound, small and sad.
“Sam,” says Castiel. Jack pulls back and Sam’s arm goes around Jack’s shoulders easily, leaving Castiel to face them both. “Thank you.”
He ends up on the edge of the mattress with Cas in the cradle of his legs, face tipped up like he’s receiving sacrament.
“Why?”
“You drive,” Dean says. He tosses Baby’s keys. They sail over to Sam in a long clean arc.
He’s on the hood of the Impala, and the metal is like ice under his thighs. The night air sends a shiver down his spine.
Cas is stroking his fingers along the line of Dean’s nape, and Cas doesn’t laugh. “Yes,” he says. “You are.”
Dean’s throat clicks voicelessly at that, startled into silence as he stares down at the place where fingers overlap fingers. Slowly, the tops of his cheeks pinken, and—and if Castiel could consume him to keep him safe, to keep him warm and loved, he would. He would.
“A deal?” His voice is sharp, and Dean knows it isn’t directed toward him. It stings a bit anyway. “Dean, if I leave with you, will you be stuck here?”
Cas doesn’t ask what he’s doing. He just turns to face Dean in his seat as if he knows they’ll be here for a while, inviting Dean in with the angle of his shoulders.
Dean is standing this time. His heartbeat hurts each time it comes and the air in his lungs is a rattling mess, but he’s on his own two feet, not slumped bonelessly to the floor.
He has to pull over finally, as far to the side of the road as he can get, and wait it out a bit. The wind howls like someone sobbing. Dean turns his hazards on.
So. Awakening him it is.
“I’ll know you for twelve years after that,” Cas continues, letting his cheek come to rest on the top of Dean’s head. Dean’s heartbeat stutters. “And though I was born before the air you breathe, they are the best twelve years of my very long life.”
“I will stay with you,” he murmurs, lips grazing Dean’s knuckles while he speaks. He doesn’t know that he’s ever seen Dean make this expression—so close to betrayal, but with a sweeter edge. A wild kind of devotion that Castiel feels echoed as its twin, thrumming like a bird’s wings beneath his breastbone. “As long as you’ll have me.”
And what else is there to say? “Of course,” Castiel murmurs. “Of course, Dean.”
Dean turns on the log and tucks his face into the crook of Cas’s neck, down there in that soft spot between the worn fold of his collar and the hot skin of his throat. Dean closes his eyes.
He expects it when the dream comes again.
Cas’s brow smooths, the corners of his mouth lift slightly. He’s running his finger over the worn fabric of the shirt slowly, almost reverently. Because it’s Dean’s. Because Dean handed it to him.
Dean waits until he’s down the hallway and disappeared into his room, and then Dean grips the bottle again, holding the neck too tightly, and slips through his own door.
Cas slips his leg forward, trapping his ankle beneath Dean’s. Winding them up in each other.
He counts his heartbeats to mark the time.
“Dean,” says Cas, just looking at him, just smiling. Sometimes his face goes so helpless when he looks Dean’s way, folded into a smile that he’s powerless against. Dean’s powerless against it, too.
Castiel intends to make up for that.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
He knows Cas is looking at him before he even turns his head. The gaze is like a touch; tender, softly exploratory. Dean leans into all that blue and Cas catches his hand, holds it close, lifts it to his mouth. Kisses Dean’s battered knuckles.
Dean ain’t leaving here without him.
Dean thinks into the silence.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes.
Cherry told him he was pretty. She was nicer to him than he deserved, especially since she’d already been paid, and afterward she had pretended not to notice the way he laid flat on his back and stared at the ceiling, eyes wide open and so dry they burned.
When he wakes up Cas is there, watching Dean closely in the darkness.
“Dean,” Cas says.
and his palms open
mind the tags everybody. nothing graphic, but i want everybody to take care of themselves!
But it’s Cas. Cas, who cares about two versions of Dean so deeply that it’s almost overwhelming.
“Don’t tell me you’re too soft to hunt now,” he says. His face is numb, hands shaking, and he drinks again to wash everything down. “You scared of somethin’ now you’re old?”
There is a weird sort of delight bubbling under the surface of Dean’s skin, a nasty panting urge that makes him yearn for a fight. He takes a swig from the bottle of whiskey Sam handed him to dull the pain of getting sewn up, and then another, and another, until his head starts to swim. Hopes Sam sees it in the flatness of his eyes.
It’s quiet, but it isn’t silent. The ambient noise of the bunker washes over him, warm and comforting: the pipes groaning faintly, the ancient heating and cooling system whirring, the buzz of the refrigerator several rooms away. Somewhere down the hall a door clicks shut, likely one of the Winchesters going to the bathroom or getting a cup of water.
None of them know what Cas said.
While Dean slept, Jack and Sam had filled Cas in on everything: he was gone for a month and a half, during which Dean refused to do anything but search for a way to free Castiel from the Empty, and finish God off once and for all. And after they defeated Chuck and Jack decided to be human, that list of things he would do dropped down to one item.
There’s a bottle of whiskey in Dean’s hand when Jack catches up to him in the hallway, a glass in the other; Dean grips them tight. Looks at him.
“Listen to me,” Cas says. There’s a snap to his words, but the hand on Dean’s waist covets the skin it spans. “It
Dean wakes up with a flinch.
It slams shut, a death knell.
“I don’t want to tell you exactly how we meet,” Cas says. “I don’t want to risk heaven interfering with the course of your life because of something I’ve said, even if I know—even if you won’t remember I told you after a while.”
He isn’t naive. This isn’t even his first rodeo when it comes to bargaining with an eldritch being—he knows it’s a trap. Gotta be.
“Gettin’ a little slow,” Dean says. He wants somebody to yell at him. He wants somebody to hit him again, send him flying to a concrete floor on his ass—and Sammy’s the only one here. “Used to finish off a werewolf in fifteen minutes.”
“—you ok? Dean? Jesus, you were gone for a whole day and we didn’t know where you were, Jack couldn’t reach you—”
They haven’t ever touched this much before, except for if one of them is injured. Or dead.
Dean’s voice crawls out of his ruined throat on unsteady legs. “He saved me.”
God is a tight hot handful of dust across an empty road, and then God is nothing.
The possibility that he’s gonna walk right by Cas—that he’s already passed him, left him back there in this vast barren nothing—has him peering so close that his eyes grow wet, has him aching to say Cas’s name. If his heartbeat hadn’t already gone sluggish with the cold it would be racing with fear. If he wasn’t shuffling at this point, trudging through shadows that want to drag him down, he would break out into a run.
He got up to escape to the bathroom, dizzy. He stood there for a long time in front of the mirror just looking at himself.
day 9: body mods
The kiss is slow, a gentle press. For a moment all of the wheeling turbulence within Dean settles.
Dean makes himself stay leaning back, staring up. “Thought we could go to the coast, maybe,” he says, unsure why the words trip themselves in his throat. As usual, he sounds too gruff. “Thought we deserved a day off. I dunno.”
Cas’s hand is still in his, and he grips it tight.
The voice fills Dean’s mind as slowly as cold oil, and drips down the back of his neck.
Cas was Dean’s—was—
Dean turns a little more sideways. Leans his shoulders against the door and eases a leg up onto the bench seat, knee bent, the other still dangling in the footwell. “Cas,” he says. Cas is holding Dean’s book carefully in his big hand, so he doesn’t crease it further, and Dean’s heartbeat is loud, and Dean scowls at him, but he’s sure it melts into a grin. “Cas.”
the oklahoma-kansas line of his forehead
and you
There’s a takeout bag clutched in one of his hands, and one of those cardboard drink carriers with two coffees nestled within in the other. He looks tired today, the bags beneath his eyes blue.
It’s changed slightly over the passing weeks, shifted into a different shape. The room again, the loss like a fist to the gut—but something else. Something warm at the edge of the room, dependable, the only spot of light in all this blurred gray nothing.
Yes—Castiel is good at waiting. But the time he spends waiting in the Empty is nothing short of interminable.
It looks at him like he’s small.
Sam smiles at the two of them openly from his position in the passenger seat, but it’s Dean’s reaction that guts Castiel. The way he flickers his gaze to them in the rearview mirror, the shape of his mouth softening as Jack rests his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean wishes he could offer more comfort. Cas was Jack’s
“Thank you, Dean,” Jack says, solemn. His mouth flickers into a smile, brief and fleeting, and he leaves Dean’s hand feeling empty when he walks away.
“I know you are,” Dean murmurs now.
Dean crawls along the highway for a little while longer, Bruce Springsteen trickling through Baby’s speakers beneath the thunder’s growl. There’s water standing on the road now, frothing at Baby’s wheels, and pine trees loom like dark watchers on either side.
wayward sisters crossover haha get it *runs and hides*
Jack feels slender and breakable under Dean’s rough hands. Dean squeezes him as gently as he knows how.
It was Dean’s birthday. An hour before, John had handed him a six pack and the keys to his own motel room and told Dean to go inside and wait, to “have fun, son,” and winked at him in the way that always preceded Dean finding something out that he was supposed to have known all along. Dean had sat there on that bed with his palms sweating, and he was drunk before she walked in the door.
Dean nods, a quick little movement of his chin, the abruptness offset by the way he wanders tentatively into the room. Like he’s not sure he’s welcome. It’s his room, Castiel thinks, his house—but he remembers the way Dean had lit up when Castiel said
Dean thinks viciously, and he hopes it can hear him.
“Dean,” says Cas again, so quiet. His other hand is on the back of Dean’s neck, fingertips in Dean’s hair. His gaze travels the plains of Dean’s face like skipping stones over a river. “You are very lucky you look like you’re about to pass out. Otherwise I would find it necessary to ‘give you hell’ about your lack of self worth.”
six down one to go baby
But Cas just smiles at him. “You should get some rest,” he says. “It’s been quite the day.”
Castiel wants to tell him that he’s who Castiel learned gentleness from at all. Perhaps another night.
“Perhaps,” Jack says. “Still, I’m glad it was you.”
day 12: hellhound
Twelve years is a long time to love somebody silently.
They start hunting again.
When Dean Winchester was sixteen years old he kissed a boy behind a bar.
Jack smiles, chin tucked down to his chest. Castiel squeezes his hand.
“It’s alright,” Cas says kindly. His thumb moves slowly over Dean’s shirt. Jack is beaming at the two of them, wide and unabashed, and Dean can’t look at Sam without dissolving. “Dean saved me.”
“There you go, honey,” she said. She slipped off the counter around the back of him, getting her hands around his soft waist. “Look at you. Pretty as a picture.”
Instantly it is cold like Dean has never felt before. Colder than the dead of winter—an absence of heat.
Sam and Jack will be fine. They love Cas, as a father and a brother, and Cas loves them. And as hard as it is for Dean to admit it even these days, Sammy’s—Sam’s grown up now. He’s his own man. A better man than Dean’ll ever be. He’ll be sad for a while, but he’ll be alright.
Castiel slips from his chair to kneel at Dean’s feet. He takes Dean’s hands in his, and there on the floor holding something with devotion, he understands Communion. He understands Eucharist. He understands believing in someone so deeply that to shelter a piece of them within yourself is an act of untempered faith, love and prayer and deep-wide trust.
. And maybe angels really don’t sleep, as Cas claims, but the guy’s got weary lines dug into the corners of his mouth that Dean would love to soothe away. Just because Cas got sent back into time for some eternal punishment—the details of which he still refuses to disclose to Dean—doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve rest.
you wore the expression of lot’s wife, of orpheus:
After a while, the cold slows him down. It weighs on his joints, drapes itself over his shoulders and down his back. He shakes with it.
“Come here,” Dean begs him, “come here and—“
He still glows faintly, Cas does. He’s got something pure inside of him, and he always has, and Dean thinks maybe it doesn’t have very much to do with being an angel at all. Cas is just
Dean can’t ask. The words stick in his throat like cold tar.
Dean shrugs, awkward as it is horizontal, and smothers down the urge to cry that’s been building since he spotted Cas. Cas doesn’t think Dean would come for him, and Dean feels like the biggest piece of shit on the planet for ever doing anything to sow that doubt.
He wants things Dean can’t give.
It smiles at Dean like a knife’s edge.
Dean is on his knees in his bedroom, elbows on his mattress like he thought he might pray.
“I’ll be ok, Cas. I can take it.”
He hates himself for a moment, a blinding twist of it. Cas deserves to hear it back. Cas deserves—he deserves so much. So much more than Dean can give him, grizzled and hardened as he is, with blood stained so deep down the cracks of his hands that there’s not gonna be any getting it out. So much more than someone who can’t say what they feel out loud without the heat of their past breathing down the back of their neck.
Richard Siken
“I don’t think any of us will have to,” Castiel says. “With Chuck gone, and only regular hunts to go on. Nobody should have to do any self-sacrificing, or make any deals.”
He didn’t. He tipped his head back against Cherry’s shoulder and watched himself pant as she kissed his neck, as she jerked him off there in front of the mirror, a thousand times dirtier than anything he’d ever let himself want and a thousand times better than what they’d done in the other room half an hour before.
His cheeks are wet now. He breathes as calmly as he can, shuffling closer to Cas. He opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out.
it hisses.
His son’s arms are strong though he’s slim and young, and he squeezes Castiel’s ribs as tightly as a band of steel. “Castiel!” Jack cries, his face buried in the crook of Castiel’s neck. He’s crying. Castiel can feel it on his skin—he can feel something other than barren darkness, than frigid air,
If he does, he doesn’t say anything. He yanks the last stitch tight and snips close to the wound, packing everything back into the First Aid kit with sharp movements and leaving Dean to tug his shirt down.
, and he is as small as he has ever been.
“I’m so glad it worked,” Jack tells Castiel happily. He’s playing a game on his phone, nearly forty minutes into the six hour drive back to Lebanon, but he’s doing it one-handed. He still hasn’t let go. “We all missed you so much, but it was even worse for Dean. Even worse than last time.”
He means it in gratitude, in breathless thankful acknowledgement. He means it in devotion, perhaps:
But no. There’s no room for it here. Castiel has learned humanity from the best of them that exists, and cowardice is not a trait that was taught by example.
Eye for an eye, as the Empty had said. Tooth for a tooth.
He hasn’t heard from Dad since that day back in Minnesota. He hasn’t heard from Sammy in a thousand times that long.
Dinner is quiet as the day catches up to all of them. Castiel knows that the spell took a lot out of all three of them, even though it was Dean’s blood used in the actual ritual; Sam gathered the ingredients and set it up with Rowena on speaker phone at the other end, and Jack helped to recite the incantation that brought Castiel back, over and over again for nearly ten minutes. They’re tired, Castiel’s family, leaning into each other sleepily at the scrubbed-clean kitchen table, and Castiel nearly can’t speak around the lump in his throat because they did it for
No speaking.
Halfway through dinner Dean catches Castiel’s hand beneath the table, focusing intently on his burger with a slim little frown between his eyebrows. Castiel holds Dean’s hand in both of his. Castiel runs his fingers over Dean’s scarred knuckles three, four, five times, until that frown lifts away.
And then he turns around. And then he steps through.
Dean thinks into the silence.
“I’m glad that you could find him when I couldn’t, Dean,” Jack says.
“It was lovely,” Cas tells him honestly.
Dean doesn’t leave a message. He hangs up each time before the beep can sound, cutting off the tail end of Sammy’s voice and starting over again.
Castiel learned to blaspheme from the lines on those pages. To find holiness in an image of his vessel sketched by a mortal man with blood on his hands. To learn to be covetous of this vessel—of his body—because for Dean to capture its likeness so tenderly, it must have a value that Castiel didn’t yet understand.
his hand in your hair. holy, holy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Even though the words are terrifying, the voice saying them warms Dean down to a place nothing’s been able to reach in weeks.
Cas’s lips part as Dean nears him, the corners of his mouth gone sweet and softly surprised. He’s breathing down here, even though he doesn’t need to. His fingers clench in the fabric of Dean’s shirt.
it says.
Castiel steps up beside him, close. He takes that hand in his.
“No,” Dean says, and takes a sour kind of pleasure in the way the Empty’s mouth goes flat with displeasure. “He gets out no matter what. I speak, you keep me.”
“Nothing,” Dean says, and laughs. It’s a bright day, winter-bleached, spilling sun all in through Baby’s windshield and lighting Cas up. “Nothing at all, Cas.”
Dean’s never let himself be loved like this. Dean’s never—nobody has ever wanted to.
It’s raining again when they reach a place that Dean can pull off, the kind of drizzle that clings to the back of Dean’s neck and fills up his lungs when he crosses around to Baby’s trunk and pulls out the cooler. There’s a thick line of fir trees between them and the beach, swaying like a wheat field in the gusty wind, but Dean can hear the ocean anyway. The distant roar.
“You’re so strong, though, aren’t you?” Cas murmurs. “You always have been.”
Cas’s cadence is stilted on its tongue, wielded like a weapon. Dean’s hands are squeezed so tightly that his nails bite into the meat of his palm.
He’s right on the edge of drifting off when Sam finally stands up, taking all their dirty dishes to the sink and turning back to them all with a smile. “It’s really good to have you back home, Cas,” he says.
A crack of light before him, like a knife-slash. Castiel breathes, and Castiel jumps through.
The only outlier is the crowd of empty whiskey bottles taking up some counter space to the side, rinsed clean and waiting for Sam to take them to the recycling center.
The room is almost stifling in its heat after the Empty’s freeze, but Dean finds that he’s still trembling lightly anyway. He clears his throat, scraping and heavy. “I’m ok, Sam,” he says, and cuffs him on the cheek with a shaking hand, gentle. His voice is nothing but a straw-dry rasp. “Sorry I left without tellin’ you. Got an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”
looking back and back, because sometimes looking is all you have.
Cas cocks an eyebrow at him. “Dean, I am an all-powerful cosmic entity the likes of which you will not be able to truly understand for many years yet to come. I am not ‘wiped out’ by mere time travel.”
They’re all talking around Dean. He eats slowly, drinks slower. He wants Cas to reach out under the table and touch Dean’s thigh. His heart beats, birdwing fast.
He has watched planets coaxed from disparate atoms as one might coax the shape of a vase from a lump of clay; he has seen mountains rise, and cities fall; he has sat himself on the edge of heaven and watched for a billion years as water carved a place for itself in the bedrock of the earth, winnowing out the path of a river, of a lake, of an ocean. Castiel is good at waiting.
“Good thing we ain’t in a hurry,” Dean mutters. He tips his head back against the window and peers up at the sky, gray as wet pavement between the tree boughs. Watching the rain come down from this angle makes him dizzy, in a gentle, rocking kinda way. The glass is cool against his cheek.
It doesn’t matter to Dean. He is like a dog: desperate for any bit of positive attention, drooling all over himself for a kind word. It’s embarrassing how his heart leaps when he sees Sam’s text, the first thing on their six-month-stale thread full of Dean’s increasingly desperate attempts to reach out before he gained some self-respect and shut the hell up. It’s embarrassing how quickly he hits the call button, and it’s even worse the way he wants to break something when Sam doesn’t pick up.
“I meant what I said in the Empty, Dean Winchester,” Cas whispers. “I would do it a million times over.”
Somebody says his name. The warmth at the edge of the room moves, looms closer; Dean glances that way—
There’s static in Dean’s brain.
He can hear Cas talking softly to Jack, that low, tender tone he always takes with him: it cuts right through Dean, right down to the middle of him. He spoke to Dean like that when he realized it was really him. Dean came to find him, but Cas led Dean out of the darkness with the sound of his voice.
Dean looks like he wants to answer, but he hesitates, and Castiel doesn’t fault him for that. He knows how difficult Dean finds vocalizing how he feels on the best of days—and now, today, grief still lining his face and weighing down his shoulders, thinner than Castiel has ever seen him, exhausted in a way that hurts to look at… now it’s easy to believe he’d have trouble speaking.
The Empty tilts its head, a gesture so similar to Cas and yet so very, very wrong that Dean feels bile rise to the back of his throat.
Cas had said.
It hits Dean then.
Castiel doesn’t, certainly. He is filled to the brim with the feeling of Dean Winchester in his arms again. He is drowning in him, and doesn’t wish for air.
Dean feels drunk with skin-on-skin contact, even just that little bit. His tongue is thick and heavy in his mouth as he says, “Werewolf. Got the jump on me.”
It’s dark when they arrive.
When Dean Winchester was eighteen years old he lost his virginity to a woman who called herself Cherry.
“I’m glad it worked too, Jack,” Castiel says finally. He soothes his thumb over the seam at Dean’s shoulder. Thinks of the way he’d folded into Castiel, as thin as creased paper. His voice is too heavy in the small space of the Impala’s cabin, but there is nothing he can do to change that. “Very, very glad.”
it's sam winchester's birthday today (may 2nd) so i'd like to extend a formal apology to him that he's so under-represented in this fic aldksjf i'm sorry sammy i love you
Cas’s eyes soften. “Of course,” he murmurs.
They’re all here. All safe. Dean kissed Cas, and Cas kissed him back, and Dean’s willing to bet that’s gonna happen again.
Cas still looks worried, but at least he seems pretty close to convinced that it’s really Dean here, and not some hollow version of his skin. Dean drifts forward and kisses him again, feeling spindly and brave, a light touch at the corner of his frown.
“Jack,” Cas says. He is so happy that the corners of his eyes are crinkled up like a starburst, and it makes Dean need to grip the edge of the table so tight it hurts. “I missed you too. I am very happy to be home.”
The kinda good that feels like absolution to touch.
you set your mouth at the hinge of his knee, the soft secret part of his flesh.
“I-I love you,” Dean whispers. Their mouths touch as he speaks, as he breathes out a shivering breath. “God, god, I love you, Cas.”
Cas, dipping down close to speak to Dean so that his hair brushes Dean’s temple.
“That’s it?”
know peace from me.”
Dean calls again, just to listen to Sam’s stupid fucking voicemail message, his trying-too-hard voice on the other end:
Castiel lets his hand finish tracing the arc of Dean’s forehead, down his temple, down his cheek. He cradles Dean’s jaw for a moment, heart clenching at the sprinkle of freckles across the bridge of Dean’s nose and cheeks, and then drifts his hand down to Dean’s shoulder. He shakes him as gently as possible, murmuring his name.
Castiel can feel Dean’s heart beating through the translucent skin of his wrist, pressed right up against Castiel’s. He doesn’t hesitate. “Because I love you,” he says.
He blinks the nap out of his eyes. Cas is watching him from a small distance away, and when he sees Dean looking at him, he smiles.
Cas opens his mouth like he wants to say Dean’s name, but nothing comes out.
Cas is breathing slow and steady against Dean, rising and falling like the tide. “I’ve told you before,” he says quietly, “that heaven has a plan for you.”
It takes Cas’s shape in the corner.
Cas blinks his eyes open.
we're gettin good use of that slowburn tag HOWEVER there's some nsfw business in the middle of this chapter so. eyes sharp folks
here you are. a pillar of salt made whole again. a sapling with your branches bent.
is what got you here in the first place, pal.” Dean’s heartbeat tastes like blood. “Don’t try that shit with me. You came here to make a deal—let’s make a goddamn deal.”
Dean hasn’t even come close to the end of what he has in him.
he hears, and the darkness flickers a second time, a third,
He was supposed to feel different after this—more whole. Grown.
the Empty says.
Dean trembles slightly. Here, sunk deep into Castiel’s arms, clinging to the front of Castiel’s coat desperately, like he thinks that if he doesn't hold on until his knuckles blanch Castiel will be ripped away.
“You shouldn’t be here,” Cas tells him. He strokes his palms down Dean’s arms and then back up, working some warmth into his skin. “A human shouldn’t be able to survive here.”
Dean is leaning sideways against her smooth black exterior as he does so, gaze trained on some distant place that Castiel can’t follow. He startles when Castiel’s shoes scuff on the concrete, looking up fast; when he sees it’s only Castiel he softens.
He imagines their faces if they knew he had an angel in the front seat next to him—one that can shoot a gun and heal wounds and decapitate a werewolf with a strong clean sweep. He wonders if Cas can hear their prayers, or if that’s the kind of thing only the big guy upstairs is privy to.
Sam and Jack are cleaning up the remnants of the spell, talking quietly amongst themselves. Likely to give Dean and Castiel their privacy, though Castiel doesn’t think either he or Dean has room enough in them for shame right now.
It’s instinct to offer to cook for everyone, even though it’s nearly four in the morning and two of the four of them are cosmic entities who don’t need to eat and all Dean really wants is for Cas to kiss him again. It’s instinct to lead everyone into the kitchen and assemble the stuff for pancakes, the kind with cinnamon and brown sugar that Bobby used to make for him and Sam if they were lucky enough to be at his place during either of their birthdays, even though he hasn’t cooked a meal for his family in so long that guilt sours the back of his throat. It’s instinct to grab a beer from the fridge and drink it as he flips pancakes on the griddle, because he can feel Cas’s gaze like a hand on the back of his neck, because he can’t quite believe that anything happening to him right now is actually real.
Not that he needs taking care of—he’s a fucking age-old soldier of God—but still. Still.
It’s… it is unbelievably good, sitting here with Cas’s arm around him—good in a way that he can’t look directly at, like the sun, like his reflection in the mirror after a hunt gone bad. There’s guilt there, of course, tucked away inside of him where his guilt always lives, but it’s dulled. It’s muffled.
crouched in the blood on the floor of a motel on the oklahoma-kansas line
have time for a luxury like that, but they’d always hoped.
There is a pause, long enough that Dean can hear himself breathing ragged.
Not that he would. Not that he’s been able to since the Empty took Cas three days ago, leaving Dean with nothing.
“It’s good to see you too,” Jack says. His breath hitches a little and Castiel rubs his palm up and down Jack’s spine, a soothing, instinctual movement. A human one. “I missed you so much. We all missed you.”
“So what happened?” Sam asks, pulling back. Jack and Cas detangle, too—Dean sees it out of the corner of his eye—and Cas must be able to tell that Dean needs to be touching him right now because he reaches across the slim space between them and fits the cup of his palm over Dean’s shoulder, warm and steady and sure. “Cas, are you alright? How’d you get out of there? Did the Empty just—just let you go?”
A few minutes later, right before Dean gives up and walks back to his table, the door opens again and Lisa comes out.
[7.12., 14:21] Dean: And I do still want to talk to you
[5.12., 11:35] Castiel: C.Novak@gmail.com
"I just wanted to see how I'm doing and... I'm not used to being taken care of like that, I felt... useless."
Moaning and whining, Dean is pushing on Cas ass to make him go deeper and faster.
[8.12., 12:18] Dean: He's younger then me tho
It takes Dean exactly 30 min to realise his phone is gone. He pats his jeans and jacket pockets. He turns baby inside out but he can't find it anywhere.
Gabe clears his throat. "Uhm... yeah. Yeah I am. Uhm... do you think... maybe... like could you guys lock the bedroom door when you're ... uhm... when you're showering?" He looks slightly uncomfortable.  "Don't be mad. It wasn't on purpose   I knocked. I swear. But I knocked and walked in cause I saw the cars were here and the bathroom door wasn't closed so.... uhm. "
[28.1., 12:47] Anael: You are in love with him, aren't you?
[3.3., 13:48] Castiel: What else?
[3.12., 08:05] Dean: There is snow here
"Want to curl up with them while I make you dinner?" Cas asks.
"I'll have Pepperoni. And huggy bear takes meat lovers."
"Dinner sounds awesome!" Cas nods.
[27.12., 20:42] Castiel: Alright
"I am not here to break you guys up. I am here to make sure you both are safe and make good decisions. I think meeting so soon wasn't a good one."
"Yeah. It's been a long day."
"Don't drag it out please." Dean pets Castiel’s back. "It was a really good dream. You were riding me."
[4.3., 09:19] Castiel: But they're your friends first.
Deans mind is floating. The scratching of Cas on the paper is soothing and  the feeling of Cas cock throbing on his tongue is all he cares about right now. The ache in his knees doesn't matter and neither does anything from the outside world. It's just him and Cas and whatever his boyfriend wants from him today. He can let go of the stresses of the last few days.
They walk up to the front desk still clinging to each other and smiling at the receptionist.
Frank watches Jimmy struggle through the pronouns and smiles. "Frank and he when I am not in gear honey. Don't hurt yourself please."
"Bring one home." Dean decides.
Dean is waiting in the car and smiling at Cas as he opens the door.
[13.12., 20:20] Dean : Fuck
Dean looks up. "You got a sealed file? What did you do as a youngling?"
Dean agrees to both and dried off they get in bed together.
"Okay. Like I told Cassy, I can't make him not move in. He's terribly in love with you. He trusts you and he's told me that both Jodi and his therapist approved. So, yes, okay. Do it."
[2.12., 12:56] Dean: Not Cas
Dean laughs. "You thought about it. But maybe tonight. " He grins and grabs Cas' hand.
"Good. Cause i remember you mentioning food."
[23.2., 13:22] Dean: I got a eye liner pencil on my way to work
"Oh I am sure you two are going to be doing wonderful. Who knows, maybe you learn a thing or two about each other."
“I know, Cas,” Dean says. He’s so tired. “I know. I just.”
The Empty closes behind them with a sound like a scream.
It’s very obvious that he’s trying to make the tone lighthearted once more, even though his voice wavers as he speaks and the tenderness with which he looks at Dean is almost unbearable.
He pulls Dean into a tight, brisk hug. They haven’t done this for a while. It’s… it’s nice.
There is something like heat crowding up beneath Dean’s jaw. If Cas does that again, Dean might break apart. He wants him to.
“You ain’t ever getting in my bed with shoes on,” Dean says. Cas laughs, low and soft, and Dean didn’t mean it like that—not that he’s not interested, he’s
Beyond the slender point of Jack’s shoulder is Sam, gazing at them with a soft smile, eyes openly damp, and Castiel’s heart pangs as he looks at him. Strong, sweet Sam, standing in the background letting Castiel and Jack have their reunion even as his face lights up with joy when Castiel looks at him. Castiel can’t help but send a smile his way, warm and grateful; he’s sure that whatever took place to get him out of the Empty’s clutches, much of it was made possible by Sam Winchester.
he mouths, slow and clear.
It isn’t Jack’s fault that he can’t reach Cas—it’s Dean’s fault that he let him go in the first place.
Dean hasn’t drawn him in years, but Castiel remembers the way he would used to do it, casual and quick-glancing in motels smeared across America. The way he would study Castiel openly, for once free of the shame that kept him from looking his fill most of the time, brow slightly furrowed in concentration as his scarred hands worked a soft piece of charcoal over the back of a diner receipt or the blank pages at the ends of books.
“Dean,” says Castiel, soft. Dean’s shoulders are up around his ears but it isn’t defense, or fear. It’s shock, maybe. He looks overwhelmed, and so hopeful that humanity bleeds from his every pore. “You don’t have to stop yourself from touching me. I will always welcome it, to whatever level you’re comfortable with.”
He’s never been to the ocean before. He and Sam had always tried to get Dad to stop off at one when they passed through a coastal state, especially during the summer when the air inside Baby stifled their skin like a weight—of course he never did it, wouldn’t have even if they
which i don't know how to use and i'd love to talk to you <3
The Empty is delighted, and Dean’s heart sinks even as it beats with the first real hope he’s had since Cas was taken.
genuinely from the bottom of my heart writing this chapter fucked me up
What the fuck does he know?
day 7: young at heart
He doesn’t seem surprised to see Dean here, or relieved. He watches Dean with none of the avid closeness he’s always bestowed him, with none of the soft regard. He’s blank.
Dean types, as if he hasn’t been calling Sam over and over for the past twenty minutes and being resolutely ignored. As if one strong breeze couldn’t blow him over.
Cas looks weary, paler than usual, shadows dark beneath his eyes. He smiles anyway, small and true.
The dark is still mostly impenetrable, but it’s easier to traverse going this direction. It lifts from their edges, and even though Dean can’t yet see an exit yet, the despair that has been curled in his chest like a small dead animal since Cas left him is starting to slip away.
Castiel presses closer to him. It doesn’t answer the question either way, but Dean, well. He figures he’s forgiven.
Dean wrestles down a sob as he soothes his thumbs over the bags beneath Cas’s eyes, as he touches the softness of his hair with questing fingertips. He’s here. God, he’s here, and Dean—Dean missed him so much he almost couldn’t do it. Any of it. Almost couldn’t live.
sorry this is so late! life got swiftly insane for me these last few weeks, and since this chapter is such an emotional one, i decided it was more important to take my time with it and make it good rather than rush it and give ya’ll something half-assed. hopefully the wait wasn’t too bad!
Sometimes it’s hard to believe heaven has a plan for a man whose own father and brother don’t even want him around, but he’s been trying. Turning the idea over and over in his head so the light shines through all sides.
“Good morning, Dean,” he says. Something about him is sad in that low-down untouchable way, that bruise Dean can’t see but knows he had a hand in causing. He looks at Dean like he misses him, even though he’s right there. Cas smiles. “Happy birthday.”
interested, it’s just, it’s late, and Dean sort of just wants to hold him, as pathetic as that is—
An absence of heat, of light. Of sound.
He opens his mouth to say Cas’s name—and then he snaps it shut again.
He doesn’t look at Castiel, but he doesn’t have to. Castiel stares at the fan of his eyelashes above the dark circles beneath his eyes, the way they spread soft as fleece, and wants so badly to stop the car and coax Dean to sit back here beside him.
They win. With their grubby hands and their mouths tasting of blood, they win.
“What are you smiling at?” Cas asks him.
“It’s a little over half a decade before we meet,” Cas tells him.
He casts one last look back over his shoulder at his closed door, hoping against hope that Sam or Jack doesn’t come looking for him and end up putting themselves in danger.
He deserves someone a million times better than the man Dean can even dream of being.
He watches Dean lower himself to the chair at Castiel’s side. He’s lit up gold in the lamplight, the fine hairs on his arms iridescent.
He has people who love him deeply. People who would do anything to have him safe and by their sides.
“What’s the catch?” Dean spits. “What’s supposed to keep me from joggin’ in there and singing
“Alright,” Dean says. “Shit, ok.”
“Yeah,” he had said to her. Her hair was dark and curly and looked nice around her shoulders, swaying around her face. It was pity that made her smile at him. “Yeah, real good.”
He is eons old and he is achingly young. He looks so damn much like his father.
The lack of response in his head has sharp corners. Dean smirks against the dark.
Maybe if he didn’t feel half dead where he stands, Dean might be more of an asshole about Cas presuming something that flays the skin back from Dean’s bones and is nevertheless completely true—but he’s barely able to keep his eyes open right now.
The Empty seals itself behind him with a sound like gnashing teeth, and someone gasps.
looks.
Cas’s frown is so grumpy that for half a second Dean almost smiles. Quickly, though, it changes to fear; he sits up and he helps Dean up with him, holding Dean’s shivering shoulders in his big palms.
No. Never again.
He falls to his hands and knees on the other side.
Cas does laugh this time, and it’s just a puff of air on Dean’s temple. He says, gently, “You let me know.”
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas says. And it is. He knows Dean loves him, has been able to hear it in every prayer for years—but even if Dean didn’t feel the same way, Castiel would be alright. It’s enough just to love him aloud, and it will continue to be enough, even if Dean wants only to do just this for the rest of their lives. “It’s alright.”
Dean can’t breathe after he’s gone.
“You are too, you know,” Dean says. “I dunno what I’m like in the future but I’m probably still an idiot so I’m sure I don’t tell you that enough. Or, uh. Ever.”
(See the end of the chapter for
All the last decade.
He deserves to rest. They all do.
“You have a good time, honey?” she had asked him, propped up at his side. Her breasts were soft and dusky-brown, and he thought she was pretty too, of course he did, but he knew he thought it the wrong way. He felt about her the way you feel about a painting in a museum: distant admiration, and no sharp tug of want to have it as your own.
The Empty’s mouth moves, but its voice echoes only in Dean’s head. Probably so Sam or Jack won’t hear and come running.
“I know you can.” Cas’s fingers are wrapped around Dean’s wrist now, the pad of his thumb nestled against Dean’s pulse-point; the wind picks up the salt of the ocean and the scent of him, something a little like metal and a little like the Impala and a little like the road. Dean wants. Fiercely Cas says, “But you shouldn’t have to.”
Angels have no need for hope.
A miracle. The kind hewn not because of divine intervention, but despite it.
Dean would like to say he’s got no idea what that means. But out of the two of them, Sammy’s always been the smart brother, and it doesn’t take a genius to see the way Dean’s been mooning after Cas all night.
He tugs Castiel up to a half-kneel and he kisses him like that, with his hands pressed up to Castiel’s beating heart. It’s gentle, a brush of his mouth to Castiel’s, as if he’s afraid he’ll break Castiel with anything stronger.
The gas pump clicks. Dean draws away reluctantly to remove it, and then he’s right back into Castiel’s space as they wait for Sam and Jack. It makes Castiel smile.
Dean thinks, gripping his free hand into a fist.
“Hey,” Dean says, as if it isn’t two in the morning and they’re simply running into each other somewhere. As if he didn’t seek Castiel out. He’s wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt, and the lack of overlayer makes him look smaller somehow, strangely bare. “What’s up?”
“We’re… you two are friends, right?” He feels himself flush even darker at the question, and prays it can be blamed on the alcohol in his system. “You and your Dean.”
He’s shivering hard now, wracking things, and Cas must be able to feel it; even blank as he is, his brow dimples with concern.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says, a bit thickly. He squeezes Castiel’s elbow where it’s wrapped around Jack’s lower back. “Glad you’re back.”
Dean peels off his ruined flannel, presses its clean edge into Sammy’s grip. Wipes at Sam’s knuckles, and then lets his touch fall away.
Cas squeezes his hand.
He doesn’t bother reacting to that. He would fuse the two of them together if he could. He would slip into the shelter of Cas’s skin and never leave again.
When Cas follows him to his bedroom, Dean doesn’t put up a fight.
But no trouble answering. He hugs Castiel, tight, one hand on the back of his head to keep him in close. He hugs him, and Castiel feels more than he hears Dean’s breath shudder out of him on an exhale.
