Dean is suddenly on guard again. “Yeah it is,” Great. Turns out he’s in some new version of hell - or the angels really did hate him enough to torture him even in heaven. Those dicks were probably looking on and laughing at him now. “Cuz last I heard you -” or not you really, but the Bobby that whatever this thing was was emulating “- you were in heaven’s lockup.”
Dean moves his hand up to cup the side of Cas’ face. Cas is surprised by the gesture, squinting his eyes slightly as he works out what it is Dean is saying. “Cas, since when have I only liked women?”
“Heaven ain’t just living your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been.” Bobby says as he looks out at the trees.
Dean can’t help it. He laughs. Cas’ face falls, and Dean has to say something now. “Cas, you idiot. We’re both absolute idiots.”
In a corner of the room he sees Hannah and Anael engaged in quiet conversation and has a bit of a panicked moment. Hannah is the first to see Dean and she immediately looks anywhere but where he is. Ana looks up to see what has caused this much awkwardness in her friend when she also sees Dean. She smiles and gives Dean a small wave. He nods shortly and gives a brisk smile, the discomfort of old flames meeting one another hanging heavy in the air. But soon, what he’s seeing finally catches up with him.
Dean’s heart stops. He thinks of his family - his friends - all separated far too soon. Everyone together, Bobby had said. And the walls? His hope starts to piece together in his chest against his wishes. Surely, he couldn’t mean - blue and tan flit across his minds’ eye. But the black goo that engulfs it dashes any hope he had growing within him.
He drives until he comes to a bridge in the forest. For some reason, he knows he should stop here. He shuts off the engine, and steps out of the car.
In the split second before he is completely torn away to a parade of hugs and slaps on the back, Dean’s eyes flicker back to meet Becky’s. Her laptop has been closed and she is packing it away. A grin splits across her face and Dean laughs freely.
He knows. He hopes it's soon but also he doesn’t. Sam deserves to live a long happy life. It’s what Dean’s always wanted for him.
“When Jack...He pulled me out of the Empty before the walls came down - I had to… I had to leave my grace behind Dean.” Cas looks at Dean expectantly, begging him to understand.
Dean has to acknowledge how crazy his family really is when he sees Hell’s royalty has come to visit in this new heaven, sitting together at a table sharing a cup of tea. He’s glad to see that Crowley and Rowena have found some kind of common ground and managed to work something out long enough for a conversation. Though he’s a bit surprised to see Crowley here really. Didn't ever think he'd be the heaven kind of guy.
Cas’ eyes squint harder and Dean returns a pointed look. Cas’ eyes dart around the room, finally resting on Benny and Aaron and Ash, even Crowley, none of whom seem surprised by what they just witnessed. His gaze returns to Dean, who raises his eyebrows and lets his face speak for him.
It’s beautiful here and Dean allows himself to let his guard down. The mountains go on for miles around him - he’d always liked the mountains. They didn’t have any views like this in Lawrence. It reminded him how huge the world was outside his little life in the bunker, and really, with so many beings - humans, angels, monsters, gods - trying to force the weight of the world onto his shoulders, it was nice to feel insignificant sometimes.
He takes a moment just to feel the feeling of being behind the wheel before he turns on the tape deck. The opening bars of Kansas float through the air.
Dean’s smile stills. It sure is pretty damn close to his perfect heaven isn’t it? He’s grateful, he really is. He’ll get to spend eternity with his family and all the friends he’s made along the way. But he knows there’s one person who didn’t get to die and go to heaven, whose fate was much emptier than that.
He drives until he comes to a bridge in the forest. And for some reason, he feels he should stop here.
Angels who died. Here. In heaven. When Bobby said Jack tore down the walls, he couldn’t have meant - did Jack tear down
Bobby stands and moves to the door to the roadhouse, beckoning for Dean to stand too. When he does Bobby slaps a hand on Dean’s back and uses his other hand to open the screen door and reach for the door knob. Dean realizes he can hear the muted bars of a classic rock song - is that Zeppelin? Of course it is.
relationship, to say the least. He’s witnessed them dance around each other for years, both of them always managing to narrowly avoid expressing their real feelings for each other.
Dean didn’t answer. John grabbed him by the shoulder, and by the way Dean winced, it must have hurt. John said, in a low tone, “This is a lesson, Dean. A
Cas nods. His face twists into something determined. That’s the thing Dean always has loved about Cas—him giving his all into everything.
Sam was able to get them in the Impala and point the car in the direction of home. Sam kept glancing between Dean in the passenger seat, exhausted, head drooped against the headrest and eyes shut, and Cas in the back. Every time he looked in the rearview mirror, he saw the most desolate look on Cas’ face. A vacant, faraway look that Sam would become acquainted with over the next few months.
Sam decided to leave when he saw Cas, tired and finally defenseless, tilt forward and rest his forehead against Dean’s chest, like Atlas bowing under the weight of the world.
Dean didn’t notice it before, but the wind is dying down around them. He can tell by the less frenetic movements of the swingset down the hill. Cas sharply clutching Dean’s hand brings him back to the conversation.
Jody shut the flip phone, her expression grim. “All right, listen up,” she said to the bustling room, her hand raised. “Got another demon attack nearby, thirty miles away. Cindy’s doing her best to handle it, but she’s got her two boys at home, and no partner to hunt with. Who wants to assist?”
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, and Mom just watched me drag that thing down the street until the bag ripped and I had to come home.”
Castiel nods, blinking into the sunlight. The sky is overcast but the rays still insist on pushing through the clouds. “Does he still live here?”
Mary picks up an apple from her desk, shining it on the front of her denim shirt. “It is strange that even I haven’t met her,” she agrees. “And you
Dean jumps minutely in his seat and slams the book closed on instinct. He barely makes eye contact with the guy standing in front of him when he asks, “Uh, yeah?”
Before Dean could start swearing and losing his temper at her, Castiel grumbled in the seat next to him, “I hope her bladder was worth the danger.”
“I tried to explain!” Dean rises to go to the fridge, “At the bar that night when we met, I told her that even though I’m her soulmate, I guarantee that she wants nothing to do with me and that she’s better off finding some close second to spend the rest of her life with.”
Dean nods, looking at his modest bookshelf sitting so proudly out in the open. “Yeah, I suppose it is.” He knows it’s selfish and very much toeing the line of he and Cas’ budding friendship, however he can’t help but lean into the warmth of Cas’ side while grinning stupidly at the bookcase.
Castiel lifts his head to blink at the low autumn sun and sighs. He scratches out the last sentence.
Dean is suddenly at Castiel’s shoulder, chest practically pressed against Castiel’s back. “See anything interesting?”
pod, dear,” Kate-Nancy corrects. “Poor dear, native language is Polish. Still not getting American colloquialisms down even after 83 years!”
“No, but I can learn.” Jack shifted on the bed, his back a tense line. “Amara said that Chuck didn’t know everything at first—he just needed to learn. It could take a while, but… I could do it.”
“Crystal Lake. It’s half a mile from here,” Dean explains with a significant look in Sam’s direction. “Faith took Cas there once.”
“Eileen and I were talking about this, and she had a good idea. We need to reach out to the hunter network, tell them what’s going on. Get more organized. So that until Jack is able to seal the Empty, we can make sure demons aren’t wreaking havoc on people.”
Castiel met Dean’s eyes and said, with a completely straight face, “That’s the only reason I can see as to why she would put herself and everyone else on the highway in danger. A desperate need to urinate.”
“Mr. Cas, you’re back!” one of the students, Ronny, if Castiel remembers correctly, grins at him. “Are you going to be in our afternoon classes?”
Anna’s face drops into a neutral expression as she directs her attention to Charlie. “I had to talk to Castiel about something.”
“Dean! To me!” Sam is feet away from Faith, holding out his hands toward the ground. Dean’s hunted with him long enough to know what he means. The best way to kill a monster: its head.
“You need to tell me what hurts, man.” Sam bent down from Castiel’s level. “Do you need to go to a hospital?”
As he drives home, he feels no lighter than he did that morning. He wants to see Cas, have a few drinks again. Maybe they could talk more about Cas’ angel family and Claire. Maybe Dean can study Cas’ eyes a little more and figure out just what kind of blue he would describe them as.
A few miles away, the sky opened. A huge form, made of darkness and shadow, came tumbling towards the ground. It looked like a giant panther, sleek and shiny with shadows leaking off of it. It landed on its giant paws, its eyes glowing a red brimstone as it turned its gaze toward Dean.
“Fine, sure,” Sam says with a signature eye roll. “I’ll go say goodbye to Cas. Get my stuff out of the car and put it in Cas', will you?”
Dean couldn’t look at Claire’s glassy eyes for too long, so he snapped his attention to Jack. “Okay. How do we find him?”
It’s the wrong thing to say, apparently; Cas glares down at the book and says, stiffly, “I’ve learned a lot from it. Stop mocking me.”
There’s a moment of paralyzing, freezing-in-his-veins fear after he opens the door. Dean is on the ground, sprawled and unmoving, the silver knife on the ground next to him.
Dean fishes a worn piece of paper out of his pocket. He holds it high in the air, snapping it with emphasis. “This note, right?”
Cas nods, and stares at her for a beat, until Dean wraps an arm around his shoulders and says softly, “C’mon, sweetheart, time to go home,” at which Cas nods and turns away.
He shook and shuddered as usual. When the sobs subsided he took a few healthy shots of whiskey to calm himself down, since Sam wasn’t there to bitch at him for it. Sitting at the edge of the bed, he buried his face into his hands, breathing heavily.
“You need sleep, Dean.” Mary’s eyes flicker to Castiel’s, and her voice lowers. “He’ll get better without you being here all day every day, you know. Let us take care of him, too.”
Where Dean was once oblivious to the man’s presence during his shifts, he’s now hyperaware. The next shift that Dean sees him, he says, as casually as he can, “Got that computer working again.”
<3 thank you all for sticking with this story. Can't believe there's only a handful of chapters left.
Dean finds him sitting on the ground, a few books scattered over his lap and even more stacked in piles next to him. With a grin, Dean sits down across from him and puts his own pile down in front of Castiel, effectively blocking the narrow aisle and deterring other customers from trying to walk through that section.
Sam ignored the hushed conversations Dean and Cas would have when they didn’t think Sam was listening. The measured, concerned tone of Cas; Dean’s quick, harshly punctuated whispered words. The way those conversations would sharply end once Sam walked into the room. Cas and Dean would turn away from each other, not looking each other in the eye for the rest of the night.
With a grin, she wipes a trail of blood on her face with the back of her hand. “I’d hoped you had more respect for me than that, Castiel,” she says. “I put you into your little bad memories cage once, I can put you back there again. I know you have plenty of shit that I can feed on.”
Castiel sighs. “I’m so sorry.” He pauses, frowning. “I would like very much to punch this man you call Benny in the face.”
i hope this provides clarity on ... the mindset?... of dean. and why some of the bad stuff from the past went down : )
The ground rumbled, vibrating the ice underneath Dean’s knees. Spidery cracks appeared in the glassy water, splintering beneath him. Dean looked over his shoulder at the shore a few yards behind him—a looming creature landed in the snow, shadows leaking off of it. It was slender, inhumanely tall—red eyes suddenly gleamed through the darkness.
“Please, Dean. I want you to hear what I have to say,” Cas says. “I want to express how sorry I am that—”
Cas lifts his shoulders in a shrug. “I find myself becoming more used to the mornings, the longer I’m human.”
Sam knew what it was like to see Dean slip away, to die; he’d seen it countless times. He gets that look in his eye, like he’s seeing something far-off in another plane of existence. Somewhere Sam can’t ever follow. His face somehow gets paler. That fight that’s always in Dean, that tense energy that ties Dean to the world of the living… it goes away.
“So, you the cops or something?” Dean asks, cocking his gun. He gets to his knees and peeks over the couch. “I guess you won’t believe me when I said we had nothing to do with those deaths.”
“Maybe angels with low grace do,” Dean says, his hand rubbing up and down Cas’ arm soothingly, “but you just have to remember that they’re not real.”
“Don’t be,” Cas rushes to say, shaking his head. “It’s no detriment to me. I work at Dean’s mother’s bookstore; I have a good job.”
Naomi rises and leans over her hands on the desk. “But surely you must have heard that Claire Novak has been assigned a new guardian angel?”
Castiel stares at his hands that are clasped in his lap. He notices that his sweatshirt zipper is broken; the teeth have come apart at the middle. That won’t be sufficient for another night of harsh winter chill; he will have to ask Heaven for a new set of clothes.
“You’ll be fine, okay? I’ll make sure of it.” Anna’s face brightens into a smile. “Besides, it won’t be so bad,” she says, tapping the piece of paper in Castiel’s hand. “Lisa’s address is just across town from where my Charlie lives! We’ll probably bump into each other.”
Warily, Cas scoots over on the bed until he is in front of Dean. The only explanation for Dean’s next move is that his brain totally goes offline; that, or he’s getting way too entrenched in this whole fake relationship thing. His fingers skim across Cas’ neck, until he finds the knot, then presses against it. Cas grunts.
The only thing that gives away the body’s identity is a familiar salmon-pink polo peeking out from under a leather jacket, and a phone buzzing errantly against the concrete by their feet.
“‘Other reasons’? Like the apple pie life with a picket fence, like Dad would have wanted?” Dean scoffed. “I think we picked the wrong people for that.”
Dean opens it and sneezes. It clearly hadn’t been opened since before he had to start shaving on a regular basis. He rifles through the contents: colorful paperclips, a note that a cute girl had written to him in eighth grade, a small notebook that had SAM RULES written on the front that was crossed out and modified to SAM SMELLS. Dean chuckles and launches the notebook at Sam’s head.
“This isn’t the same as the Empty,” he said. “There’s rocks, road—actual shit here. Not just darkness.”
“He said that he loves me, and I couldn’t—I couldn’t fucking—” The hole was ripping wider, he could feel it. Threatening to overwhelm him, take him completely. He fumbled to his feet, his breath coming out in harder pants. Miracle whined, raising his head. “I don’t—so I need— I can’t—”
“Serious, man. Doctor wanted to put you on meds at one point.” Dean opened the driver’s door again, tumbling into the seat. Reaching into the glove compartment, he found the garage opener, pushing the button. Sunlight flooded the garage as the door slowly rose.
Cas willingly turns his face, giving Dean an unreadable look. Claire sees Dean stare at him back, something in his face softening.
Looking between the broken pieces of cracker on the table and the whole one, Dean shook his head helplessly. Eileen turned the in-tact cracker over, eyebrows raised expectantly.
“But... maybe that’s a good thing.” He gave Dean a lopsided grin. “I mean, not the ‘more people to put ourselves in danger for’ thing but… for the other reasons.”
He was sitting on his ass in the middle of clearing by the hill, construction workers surrounding him in a semi-circle. Work had stalled around him. Everyone was blinking down at him like he grew a second head.
Rubbing at his temple, Jack said, “He’s talking about how the Empty is a result of the big bang humans theorize about. That our universe was a vast stretch of emptiness before the singular moment when time and space smoothed out.”
Placing his backpack carefully onto the bike seat, he opens the zipper and deposits the bag of plant food into the backpack. Very sternly, he whispers to it, “Don’t you dare work,” before zipping up his pack, and riding on the dirt road back to his new home.
Dean’s throat constricts. He needs to leave. Turning on his heel, he leaves the way he came, the bell on the door announcing his departure.
“When you left a location without informing me,” Castiel continues to explain. “Again.” Dean still doesn’t look up. “That’s dangerous,” Castiel adds.
Castiel feels his mouth running on, even though his brain is screaming at it to stop. “And what the hell is wrong with her place? Why don’t you ever go there? Why does she have to be in
Castiel resolutely never looks at Dean’s hands whenever they are stroking through Lisa’s hair. Or when they’re massaging her shoulders while they watch TV in the living room. When Dean lightly touches her shoulder as he walks past her.
She puts both hands on the desk, eyes downcast toward the stained wood. “Your father and I started talking about a year ago,” she admits. “That night last week, the one that you and Sam thought he came over to confront me? I had invited him over. We were talking about him going to rehab; he didn’t like the idea, so we started arguing, and the neighbors made a fuss about it when it actually wasn’t a big deal.”
Dean worked his jaw, blinking at the weapons splayed across one end of the table, at the wall covered in post-it notes of locations and names. Sam, with a surprised laugh, said, “Jody, it’s…
He glared at it. Hesitated only a moment before suddenly springing up onto the railing, standing on the top, feet precariously toeing the edge.
in other words: cas moves to the idyllic countryside and meets dean winchester, who owns a garden shop down the road.
to describe his emotions to Dean. That would be giving more attention to the emotions, and thus a greater likelihood of them overwhelming Castiel. “I have nothing to say.”
“I’m going to bed now,” Cas announces, suddenly looking very tired. He picks the book carefully off the floor and clutches it tightly to his chest. “Do you mind if I continue to borrow this?”
Dean seems to understand; he lets out a happy laugh and takes Castiel’s hand in his (Castiel supposes that it would feel nice, if he could feel it at all). "Your voice works, Cas," he says with a grin.
Cas had settled back into his seat in the back, looking far too pleased with himself. And the station
Dean shifts the gear to park and twists the key. “All right. We get in, we get out. Just food for the next couple of days. And no doughnuts, okay? Don’t you think I forgot how they make your stomach hurt in the morning.”
“If it’s a Vetala, we need to be really damn careful,” Dean says under his breath to Cas as they walk through the lobby and into the bright fall sun. “These things are fast, and strong—and really damn particular on how they’re killed.”
“That’s what we’re afraid of,” May sighs, zipping up her coat. “You two don’t exactly blend in as typical neighbors. Monster’s probably suspicious.”
There’s moments where Cas feels like he’s teetering on the ledge of that reservoir again. That he’s looking down at the rushing rapids, toes dangling over the side, Sam pulling at his shirt behind him and shouting for him to come down. He can still remember that feeling of weightlessness; the dizzying feeling knowing that if he were to fall, gravity would yank him down.
Dean stands and follows him, the peas bag crunching against his head as he adjusts it. “Tell me what you’re thinking, Cas. You seem pissed.”
he doesn’t add. Ignoring the ache in his chest and the aforementioned crinkled note burning a hole in his jeans pocket, he rolls the cart toward the salads. “You didn’t even use the fake ID or birth certificates Sam and I got you? The fake credit cards?”
Sam held out his hands between them, slowly rising. “Dean, you need to calm down. Jack didn’t mean that he doesn’t care about Cas. We all do. We just—”
“You’re taking the bed,” is Cas’ firm reply. He guides Dean up the stairs and to the bedroom, only letting go when Dean flops onto the duvet.
“That’s not the point, it’s just—” Dean took a steadying breath, gripping Cas’s fingers more tightly against his. “I love you, Cas. I’ve loved you for… I don’t even know how damn long. And it’s been killing me not to say it.”
“His neighbor,” Dean says. “He’s a war vet, like Dad. Always has kept an eye on him. I already called him.”
A few more verses are sung. Dean glares at the road the entire time. Cas finally takes mercy on Dean’s sanity and ejects the tape. “I didn’t think it was that bad.”
Just minutes earlier, Castiel was sitting in the hallway with a straight spine and firmly clasped hands on his lap, mentally preparing himself for punishment. He was expecting imprisonment, a flogging, maybe even
“Not the kind you think,” Gabriel said, his feet hitting the floor as he leaned over the table. “Not like this one. Or the alternate worlds that my dad screwed around with. It’s not even a universe, per-say—think of it like a backwards universe.”
Dean had tried, a few times. He used to get bored after five minutes of staring and leave. Couldn't figure out why Cas liked it so much. But in the past couple of months, he found himself sitting much longer, lost in thought—sometimes even until the sun dipped past the infinite horizon.
“Yes.” Cas rested a hand against the side of Dean’s jaw; Dean leaned into it, desperately, brushing his lips against Cas’s palm. “Yes, of course.”
“You’ve done more than enough. I can take it from here. Capisce?” Dean ruffled his hair, grinning at Jack’s narrowed eyes before turning to Gabriel. “Plan B is that I’ll pray to you instead, since you’ll actually be in that hell hole with me. Your grace should be powerful enough to communicate with Jack and pass on any prayer messages, right?”
“I can’t remember that part,” Dean says with a shaky breath. “Just the bad stuff. I’m feeling it all.” He winces. “I’m remembering… god damn it, I’m even remembering Danny.”
” Sam jostled his arm, hoping it’ll jostle sense into him, too. “It’s been months since you fell, and you’re still walking around mostly silent, barely eating, acting like a ghost. You need to figure out what the hell is going on in your head. For your sake. For
The words from Dean’s mouth linger in the air; Castiel stares at Dean with wide eyes, Dean looking back at him with equal shock. Dean moves to quickly amend, “Cas, I’m sorry, I don’t—”
So acts. He jumps toward Cas’ chair, puts himself in the line of fire. Positions his back against the limbs coming toward Cas, and holds his arms around Cas’ head. Ignores Sam’s surprised shout, ignores the substance slamming into his back and enveloping him and making every part of his skin crackle.
, written in pencil, underlined and the letters traced over countless time until it’s bolder than the typed text.
“Took a fun romp through his mind as soon as he got here, you know,” the Empty said, wiggling its fingers. “When I get a new angel in here I usually just feed on their grace and call it a day, but there’s just so much delicious
“Castiel.” Anna takes his arm, waving the paper in his face. “I’m being cruel so that you'll listen. If you fall for Dean—if you get involved in any way and come between him and his soulmate—“
“Yes we are,” Cas replies. He involuntarily shivers from the absence of Dean’s warmth. “I’ll… stay here while you’re at the library.”
“You can start by explaining what you’re doing here,” Dean snaps right back. He moves, finally, his fingers drumming against the table in a move that Cas recognizes as Dean’s attempt to look casual.
Castiel raises his head, finally, and frowns at her shuttered expression. “You’re joking,” he observes.
“I’m not asking you and Cas to go get matching polos or make out in public,” Sam says, trying to placate. “Just… do it to gain the neighbors’ trust, okay?”
Last time he was on this highway heading west, Cas had randomly popped in while they were driving to a hunt in South Dakota.
When no one replied, he was ready to open his mouth again, ready to demand someone tell him what the hell was going on, when he caught the movement in Cas’s hands. They were shaking, ever so slightly in his lap. And his skin, it was paler—duller, even against his smile.
“I did often disagree with the angel that leads my garrison,” Castiel agrees, thinking back to Naomi’s lividly red face whenever she would discipline him for disobeying direct orders.
“What, you didn’t make any lady friends on the road?” Dean mentally kicks himself for even mentioning it.
Gabriel stood above him, hand outstretched, staring with wide eyes out into the middle distance. His face was pale.
Despite driving most of the night and the next day, with only a quick and restless stop at a motel, Dean didn’t beat Eileen and Sam to the bunker. When Dean came in through the door, both his brother and Eileen were at the long library table, looked up at him with concern. Miracle, lying down at Eileen’s feet, perked up and bounded toward Dean, tail wagging.
“Charlie hacked into Heaven’s computer database and found it for me. She’s really good at that kind of stuff.”
“It is.” His hand presses tighter against Dean’s skin. “Pulling you out of Hell. Being the first one to reach you. Seeing how… gorgeous your soul was.”
“I would consider the milkshake from earlier real food,” Castiel replies, proud of how steady his voice is.
our monster, she’s taking an awfully obvious interest in you. Almost in a ‘you’re my next victim’ type of way.”
Something sucked up all the air in the room, made it thinner. Dean stared. Woodenly, he asked, “What do you mean, you couldn’t find him?”
Dean looks over at his little brother standing there, machete in hand, breathing heavily. He stares at Faith’s head that’s on the ground.
“Cas.” Sam puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder; he flinches at the touch. “Have you had anyone look at you?”
Sam waits for another beat of uncomfortable silence, then claps his hands together. “Well, let’s go inside, huh? Then Cas can update us on the case.”
Dean’s eyes widened. “Cas, stop it, you stupid bastard. This isn’t some fucking game. I swear to God, if you do it—”
They sit in silence, as nurses and white coats and stretchers scurry by. Castiel keeps his eyes on the scuffed linoleum floor that’s yellowed with age.
“Went that way,” Cas manages to wheeze, pointing toward the concession stand. He picks his knife off the ground and unsteadily jogs in that direction.
Castiel looks over his shoulder. Everyone in the classroom has turned their heads to gape at the man who has a wild expression on his face, chest heaving.
Dean sipped at the weak brew, looking out the large window opening out to the main street next to him with hooded eyes. The low hanging sun indicated he’d been sitting there for a while. He pressed a finger against the cold and rubbery eggs. They probably weren’t good anyway.
“Oh.” Cas shrugs. “I don’t see the issue, Dean. And if we can get the locals’ trust, how is that a problem?”
Dean looks up to smile at his friend. “Me, too.” He lets his eyes linger on Cas until he remembers that almost-kiss; he quickly scrubs a hand over his face and forces himself to stop making the situation awkward. “I’m sorry, man, I don’t know why I’m word-vomiting right now.”
also, i've been getting comments asking what's in the note, what cas did, etc. here's what we DON'T know (but I will definitely reveal) if you need a recap in this very long and confusing WIP:
Castiel wants to tell her thank you, for taking care of Dean while he can’t, but can only squeeze her hand instead, hoping she receives the message.
He scrubs a hand over his face, feeling the stubble on his cheeks, and sighs. He’ll have to shave soon. He hates shaving, along with the rest of the human routines he has to now endure.
Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah. I said it’s too early for this shit.” He turned to walk into the field before Sam could question him.
Cas makes a mental note to give the book to Dean. He didn’t mean to take it from Sam in the first place. Didn’t mean to leave the bunker in such a rush.
“My dad is here,” is all Dean says an explanation before he leaves the car. Castiel opens his door to follow, but Dean stops it with his hand. “I think it’s better you stay here.”
It made him snap to attention. Cas turned his head to Sam. Looked down at Dean, who was shaking violently on the floor. “No,” he said.
Castiel has heard that phrase before. Claire used to yell it at him accusingly, when he would be overprotective of her safety with boys and recklessly climbing up slides on the playground backwards. She always grumbled how hard it was to have an ‘angel mom’.
Dean is on the bed, hunched over a sprawl of papers on his lap. He’s shirtless, bandages wrapped around his bare torso.
Dean held out his hand, counting down the fingers one by one. “It’s barely a lead at all, it could be dangerous if it
Shrugging, Cas says vaguely, “Dean knows more about it than I do. He…” He stops, frowning down at the ground. “He organized the trip.”
His fingers brushed against something hard and cold. His eyes slowly adjusted to see his face reflected in an icy, clear shell encasing him into a small, dark space. He pushed against it with his fingertips; tiny cracks formed from the pressure. He formed a fist and pushed harder, desperate to get out, desperate to—
Cas pulled the sliding door close, his footsteps vibrating the porch as he walked toward Dean. “Kaia started playing, and it got… intense.”
Although caught in a conversation with Anna, Cas stops and turns his head to look at Dean across the table, his sad eyes meeting Dean's.
Pushing a sweaty strand of hair from Castiel’s forehead, Dean whispers, “Yeah, it’s me, Cas. I got you, okay? You’re fine. Can you tell me what’s wrong?”
Dean was understandably pissed. He tried to go after Cas and figure out where the hunt was, where he'd gone, but just came back empty-handed. He refused to even look at Sam for days.
Claire turns to the table, to mix some yellow paint. She hears Dean ask behind her, “So, has it been busy today?”
Before he leaves for his Friday morning lecture, he packs most of his clothes into a suitcase and leaves it by the front door. He’s already made plans to stay with Balthazar over the weekend while movers take the rest of his things.
Grinning, Dean lifted his head to plant a kiss on Cas’s cheek. “Aw. You were crushing on me even when I was just a soul.”
“Yeah, but how?” Dean asks, ascending the carpeted stairs behind Cas. “The neighbors are freakishly in each other’s business. Anybody disappearing is noticed immediately around here.”
“I really don’t think you have to worry about it,” Sam sighed. He frowned. “Speaking of which—has Cas been around here yet today? To heal you?”
“I’m sure that’s not true.” Cas sits on the edge of the bed, by Dean’s feet. “You mentioned… one name that I didn’t recognize.”
“Never mind.” Dean turns on his heel and walks away from the kitchen. “I need to get ready for work. Just, can you leave and come back when I’m dead?”
Castiel shakes his head, his mouth opening but only a strangled sound coming forth where his voice is supposed to be.
But then—a flash of light. And his eyes were blinking, opening, as he peeled back the layers of his consciousness one by one. Sharply, he breathed in air with lungs that were disused. Shakily, he lifted hands that were almost unrecognizable. Turned over his palms, staring at the unfamiliar lines. His fingers rubbed at his throbbing forehead as he slowly, unsteadily stood.
“This soccer game would have happened whether we were here or not,” May says, rolling a cigarette between her fingers. “If anything it’s good that we’re here. Maybe we can stop something before it happens.”
“Do you even have a little bit of sense left in your brain?” Dean asks. He gestures, a sharp and final thing, toward the house. “Me and him, man, we…” He feels bile rise in his throat as he realizes what he was about to say. The words echo in his brain like a macabre chant:
Frowning, Eileen began, “What does that have to do with—” Her eyes went wide. Cutting off her spoken speech, she switched to ASL instead. Gabriel’s smile dropped as he replied to her, his expression grave.
“Listen. I know you’re upset about… me not telling you about Cas. And I’m sorry about that. I was just—I was looking for the right time.”
Dean does what he does best and deflects the situation. He quickly sidesteps around Cas and determinedly makes his way to his bedroom.
“Oh, uh.” Dean puts a hand on the back of his neck, hoping it’ll cool the blush that’s forming there. “No, I’m not upset. Just annoyed, I guess.”
Whenever Dean’s dad would make a scene; whenever Dean insisted on cancelling plans to help his drunk father—Benny would get angry. In this very kitchen, their most tumultuous fights came from the subject of Dean’s deadbeat dad. Benny could never understand why Dean would continue to ignore his own self-care in order to help someone who didn’t care about him back. No matter how many times Dean explained, Benny would just get angry and storm out of the house.
just a note, since i've gotten a lot of comments on it - I've been keeping the year that the present timeline of the story takes place, and the season that it's aligned with for my own mysterious reasons. BUT I do reveal the year in this chapter, so hopefully that'll help you figure out what season that's aligned with ;) so keep a look out!
“Yes!” Dean blurts out. He gapes at Sam, who is giving him a very enthusiastic thumbs-up. “Yeah, uh—that’d be awesome, Cas.”
it. Even if you were going to beat me, your ending’s already written in stone—the heroic Dean Winchester, giving up everything for the world, and then dying on an inconsequential day in an inconsequential place. Thrown into an unmarked, inconsequential grave.” Chuck leaned forward, his eyes hard. “That’s your ending, Dean. You had an angel—a very
Dean lays on the ground and pulls the pink crop top over his face. “That was the fucking worst thing I’ve ever done,” Dean declares.
The room is quiet when Cas carefully opens the door; Dean’s deep breathing indicates that he fell asleep. Cas stands over his bed, noting the irony; he used to do this as an angel for hours and not even notice. He would catalogue the way that Dean tosses to his side as he sleeps, the way his nose wrinkles when he’s having a dream. Cas would convince himself that it was purely for scientific, observational reasons that he stared at Dean for hours.
The Empty sneered, pulling Cas’s lips back into a terrible smile. “You don’t even know the half of it.” It loomed in front of Gabriel’s face, glaring. “Eons ago, I made a deal with your god—he gives me angels and demons to feast on while they’re asleep, and he gets a place to take out his trash. What he—in fact, what you
Cas landed on the couch next to Dean, the cushions bouncing from his weight. The beer in Dean’s lap sloshed over the side. Dean raised his eyebrows at Cas, who was situating himself under a blanket and looking oblivious.
Castiel smiles. He pulls his hand back; as he does, Dean grabs it, just as firmly and decisively as he did while riding in the ambulance just hours before.
“Sam,” Dean snapped, pulling himself out of his brother’s grasp, “I don’t know if you noticed, but the Empty is leaking onto the goddamn earth—demons, angels, maybe other shit. Kind of a big deal.”
At the end of the string, Dean finally saw it: a shimmering, glowing light that wasn’t part of the backdrop. It was jagged, split—like a tear.
“The only way he was happy was by accepting the fact that I don’t want him,” Dean said. “How fucked up is that? And I can’t let him think that I just...”
Dean's eyes follow his brother’s retreating back, and he wonders what in the hell he just agreed to.
Claire raised her hands and let out a loud whoop as she crossed the finish line first, miles in front. Cas frowned petulantly and leaned forward on the couch, demanding a rematch.
“Whoa, hey, Cas!” Sam ran forward and caught the cuff of Cas’ pant leg whipping in the wind, as if that would make a difference. “What the hell are you doing?”
“Sounds like we should get a move on before another demon stages a jailbreak,” Jody said. She pointed a finger in Dean’s direction, her face firm. “Now you be careful in there, all right? Don’t make me kick your ass if you get yourself killed.”
I’m going with—” At Sam’s urgent look, he clicks his mouth shut. Dean feels Cas’ eyes on the back of his neck.
He turns from the window, crossing his arms over his chest uncomfortably and scuffing his heel into the blue tile grout. “Uh, I-I guess,” Dean stutters.
Sam knows that it would give Cas the part of the puzzle he needs to understand why his decision—his choice instead of Dean’s—is making everything inevitably go to shit.
Sam looked up at Cas; at his closed eyes, the pain on his face. He nodded and patted a comforting hand on Cas’ arm. “I know, Cas. I know.”
His chin dropped to his chest, breaths coming out in harsher pants. “All right. So, I guess this is the part of the voicemail where the phone should cut me off, huh? Or someone picks up and yells at me for having the wrong number. Happened, once. Was trying to call this girl from 10th grade English. I think she gave me the wrong digits and I—” Dean huffed out a breath, pinching his nose with two fingers. “I’ll leave that story for when I see you. You might laugh at it. So just… sit tight until I can come get you. Okay?”
Dean pressed his fingers against his temple hard enough to bruise. In, out. When did breathing get so difficult?
“We’ve been hunting this monster a hell of a lot longer than you,” May says, pushing off the wall. “We know how it operates.”
They remain like that for far longer than Castiel knows friends should hug. Neither of them say anything about it.
Sitting in a chair across from Dean’s desk, Castiel says, “Yes, Dean. That’s because it’s cold. Because you left it. Hours ago.”
Over time, Cas’s smiles began chain-reacted a fuzzy feeling in his throat. Cas’s rarely-heard laugh made his skin feel like it was on fire. Cas’s hands simply skimming over Dean’s bare skin made him feel like every cell and molecule that made up Dean was reaching for Cas, begging for more.
They bump into the medical examiner on their way out of the building. “We have all we need,” Cas says politely, scurrying past him as Dean blows ahead.
It’s quiet between them; the bar buzzes around them, plates clattering in the back kitchen, a football game serving as white noise on the TV. Castiel has almost gotten the chip of wood off the table when Lisa kicks him under the table with her foot.
He’s a graduate student getting his masters in theology while also teaching math at a nearby Catholic high school.
Dean squeezes the wheel. The leather cracks under his palms. He takes a left turn out of the gated community.
“Well no wonder she’s pissed! If Jess had tried to pull that with me when we met, I wouldn’t have taken that as an answer either. Soulmates aren’t a light topic, Dean. A soulmate is someone you are perfectly compatible with, and it’s a relationship you’re guaranteed to have happiness with the rest of your life.”
Rain splashes against Dean’s face. The swings in the park below thrash wildly. Dean can feel the ground rattle underneath his feet. “Cas, buddy, you gotta calm down—”
At the base of the hill was a small army of construction trucks. Men in orange vests stood in a loose circle, blinking lazily into the sun as a bulldozer pushed itself into the pile of rubble. Only a pile of dirt and rocks remained of the cave.
that it was a Vetala killing those people. I also found the case in the first place. Doesn’t that count for something to you?”
A familiar outline is slumped in a chair against the back wall, unmoving, face tilted toward the ground.
Dean glances over his shoulder. Cas, who is sitting next to him in the booth, likewise cranes his head, albeit a little more obviously because the newly human ex-angel still has no sense of manners.
It begins to rain as they approach the car. Dean tumbles into the driver’s side, blinking away the wetness that’s attached to his eyelashes. He barely waits for Sam to shut his own door before careening out of the driveway.
Dean’s pretty sure his question is clear in his eyes and she smiles, knowingly. She nods her head toward the door to the backroom.
Dean moves his hand up to cup the side of Cas’ face. Cas, surprised by the gesture, squints his eyes slightly as he works out what it is Dean is saying. Dean huffs out a disbelieving laugh - he can’t believe he gets to have this. That he’s here. Dean’s eyebrows raise and he lets what he feels express itself openly across his face and it’s then that Cas understands. His eyes widen, questioning, and Dean’s softened eyes and small nod provides him the confirmation he needs. Cas’ smile widens and softens and he leans his head into Dean’s caress. Their eyes meet and years of things unsaid between them are shared in one look.
But Dean’s hand on Cas’ shoulder stops whatever Cas intended to say. Dean meets his eyes and grins, his voice coming out with a whisper, “Hey, Cas.”
“I think I’m gonna go for a drive.” He says, still looking outside. He looks back at the table to see Bobby smiling already knowing, Cas, worry written across his face.
Several people have retired for the day and the sun is beginning to shine through the window above the booth that he, Cas, and Bobby are sharing, reflecting the shadows of hours well spent through the empty beer bottles on the table. Ellen has dropped off a final round for the day, some cold El Sols, dad’s favorite. The three click the bottles together and take a drink.
At one of the long tables in the room sits a horde of Ghostfacers, all excitedly arguing about if pink Himalayan salt was a better protection against specters than iodized table salt. An amused looking Jesse and Cesar Cuevas sit at their table, a horse-riding helmet hanging off the back of Cesar’s chair.
She finds Cas at the table and slides into Dean’s empty seat. Cas smiles when he sees her, and introduces her to Bobby.
Dean looks around at the bar, at the family that remains around the room, at the people around the table with him and he nods his agreement. Cas has a quizzical look on his face, but Dean lets the hand that had been resting on the back Cas’s neck rub reassuring circles into the baby hairs there.
In a moment of pure indulgence, Dean’s eyes rest on the back seat, imagining. His eyes flit back to the roadhouse for a second, before he reconsiders. Another time.
As Cas always has, since the moment they met, Cas sees right through him, “Time up here… it works different.” he reassures. Dean considers this.
Cas relaxes into a smile, “Of course, Dean. I’m not going anywhere.” Of course he’ll stay. Dean’s heart fills, a truth he hadn’t known he’d needed to hear until now.
Dean has to acknowledge how crazy his family really is when he sees Hell’s royalty has come to visit, sitting together at a table sharing a cup of tea. He’s glad to see that Crowley and Rowena have found some kind of common ground and managed to work something out long enough for a conversation. Though he’s a bit surprised to see Crowley here in heaven really.
Inside, the Roadhouse is filled with life and laughter. Dean can’t believe what he’s seeing and scans the room to take it all in, a smile rising on his face. Bobby gives Dean’s neck one last squeeze and goes to sit at a table with his wife Karen who is enjoying a conversation with Missouri Moseley. Behind the bar, Ellen and Jo are serving drinks alongside Pamela Barnes. Pamela looks up and notices Dean enter and winks, through healthy, non-burnt eyes.
Dean looks around to realize he’s sitting on the front porch of Harvelle’s Roadhouse, and that wasn’t right - the Roadhouse was in the flatlands of the midwest - not the mountainous areas he’s surrounded by now. And Bobby - Bobby shouldn’t be here. No way in hell those angel dicks let him go.
“Cas, you and Jack gave me everything I could ever need. Everything I could ever want, or dream. It’s…” Dean trails off, “It’s almost perfect.” His smile is authentic and it is happy, but there’s also the mourning grief of separation lying beneath it.
He double takes as he sees two Charlies at a large table - for a moment, he’s concerned Charlie's split herself again. But he calms when he sees at one Charlie’s side sits Dorothy, and at the other Charlie’s side sits the hunter Stevie. They’re joined by a group of other hunters Dean recognizes from Apocalypse World, and Dean notices the pages of paper and colorful sets of dice spread out across the table as Dorothy’s Charlie animatedly spins some story for the group.
Dean’s smile stills. It sure is pretty damn close to his perfect heaven isn’t it? He’s grateful, he really is. He’ll get to spend eternity with his family and all the friends he’s made along the way. But he knows there’s one person who didn’t get to die and go to heaven, whose fate was much
His curiosity begins to grow and he looks closer at the rest of the people in the crowd. He sees Meg and Gabriel in a corner booth, sitting on either side of a very terrified, very flustered looking Samandriel. Meg and Gabriel glare at each other and the mildly threatening, but maybe flirtatious, energy from the table radiates across the bar. Dean does not envy Samandriel in the slightest and is a bit concerned for the safety of everyone in the room, really.
Dean stops - Mom and Dad were here? Together? I mean, he should have known, he knows, everyone together would obviously mean them too, but - no, that’s too good to be true. He’s speechless. He’s wanted this for more years than he can remember. His parents, actually together, no countdown to midnight in sight. And he can just go visit them whenever he wants.
Dean turns to look at him - it sounded too good to be true. Which never ends well for Dean. But Chuck is gone. That could have changed heaven in some way. Maybe Bobby being in lockup had been Chuck’s story.
Dean’s heart freezes for a moment when he sees the people at the neighboring table are Lisa Braeden & Ben. Ben looks up at Dean, noticing he’s entered the bar. He squints, as if he is trying to place where he might know Dean from, before he goes back to enjoying one of Ellen’s home-cooked meals together. He asks for the ketchup from the blonde across the table. She turns her head to look for the bottle, and it knocks the wind out of Dean when he recognizes her as Jess.
Of course Jack was here and of course he made changes. Jack would have hated the walls in heaven - it’s too lonely. Not enough family. Not enough room for love. That sounds plausible. Maybe this really was Bobby.
Outside, Dean admires the beauty of his car. He slides his hand from the trunk and along the sides of the doors until he reaches the driver side door. He leans in to see the clean lines of her interior - they look more beautiful than ever. “Hey Baby.” he says.
Dean smiles back - all bitterness having melted away. “Thanks Jack.” he says in a voice no human would be able to hear considering the distance they have between them. “I’m proud of you kid.”
“It’s the house I was born in, ya know,” Dean prattles on. “It used to be nice, but now it’s just covered in crap… you should see the walls. Years of grime just caked on there. Sam and I tried to scrub them once, but it’s hopeless.” Here Dean goes again. Just blurting out stuff to Cas that he otherwise wouldn’t tell anyone else. Cas is just so damn silent, and so
“Cas is doin’ his part,” Dean slurred, body leaning into Sam. “He’s boarding up Heaven, like he should. And me, this is—this is my thing. He knows that. We talked about it. He agreed to it.”
Dean sits up and grabs his laptop, plopping it on his lap. “Yeah, yeah, he’s a genius. Don’t tell him I said that or I’ll deny it.”
Dean’s heart races and shoots immediately into his throat. The door swings open and a dark haired man pushes through the door, back first, but Dean would know that dirty trench coat anywhere.
Dean's eyes flicker frantically around the room, searching. Who he finds is not who he’s looking for. Instead, he finds Becky Rosen. She sits in the back of the room at a table with her husband Rod and her two kids. The man and children are playing together with a table full of miniatures, but Becky has been watching Dean since he entered the bar, laptop open in front of her. Dean’s pretty sure his question is clear in his eyes and she smiles, softly, knowingly. She nods her head toward the door to the backroom.
“You’ve always had me, you know that Cas?” Because man of action or not, Cas was right. It needs to be said, “You can have me.” He feels his tear ducts sting and looks to see Cas’ eyes watering too, but he looks broken.
As Cas always has, since the moment they met, Cas sees right through him, “Time up here… it works different.” he reassures.
When Dean pulls away, he meets Cas' eyes and grins, his voice coming out with a whisper, a bit of breathlessness, “Hey, Cas.”
“And your mom and dad?” Dean stops - Mom and Dad were here? Together? I mean, he should have known, he knows, everyone together would obviously mean them too, but - no, that’s too good to be true. He’s speechless. He’s wanted this for more years than he can remember. His parents, actually together, no countdown to midnight in sight. And he can just go visit them whenever he wants.
Dean smiles back - all bitterness having melted away. “Thanks Jack.” he says in a voice no human would be able to hear from the distance they are between them. “I’m proud of you kid.”
He looks out over this world his family created - this new place that he gets to really truly do whatever he wants. Be whoever he wants. Feel whatever he wants. With whoever he wants. There’s no plan, no story to be told, no fight to fight, just him and whatever he chooses to do. It’s relief - freedom -
It’s in this quiet moment that he feels a weird pulling sensation inside of him - one he’s felt before.
Figures, he had just started to believe that wasn’t true back on earth. To believe he might actually deserve something more than a lifetime on his own. He’s not exactly surprised - but it still hurts to come face to face with the universe confirming his worst thoughts.
Dean’s brow furrowed with suspicion - he didn’t expect to see Bobby. He knew Bobby was a better father than his real father to him and Sam, but it didn’t feel right that Bobby would be his soulmate. He must be a memory.
“Everyone happy.” Bobby continues and Dean fights a smile that begins to form. He never got to have what made him happy on earth. Maybe now he might... - no, he can’t let himself hope. Not to have it ripped away from right in front of him. Not again. Not like this. Dean knows what to expect when it comes to good things.
the walls? Dean's eyes flicker frantically around the room, searching. Who he finds is not who he’s looking for.
He hears laughter at a table nearby and sees Donna sitting with her family of Wayward girls. Alex and Patience are laughing loudly at some joke that Wendy Hanscum has just made. Dean smiles to himself when he notices Kaia and Claire are only half-paying attention, their feet wrestling together under the table. Nearby, Jody has stopped to talk to Krissy Chambers, who was sharing a plate of french fries with Josephine and Aiden.
It’s beautiful here and Dean allows himself to let his guard down. The mountains go on for miles around him - he’d always liked the mountains. They didn’t have any views like this in Lawrence. It reminded him how huge the world was outside his little life in the bunker, and really, with so many beings - humans, angels, monsters, gods - trying to force the weight of the world onto his shoulders, it was nice to feel insignificant sometimes.
In the quiet, Dean nods, acclimating to this new reality he finds himself in. “Well at least I made it to heaven.”
Dean feels his heart skip and he looks around to see confirmation that what Bobby says is true - to see these torn down walls. He doesn’t see anything - he should have expected that really - but he needs to know. Like, all the walls within heaven? Or - no, he couldn’t mean…
Dean walks around Baby’s front end, tapping her hood with affection, and finds a place on the bridge’s railing. He looks out over this world
He’s on his way out the door when it opens of its own accord. He grins when he sees her, knowing what it means.
Dressed in all white denim, he’s been watching him. Jack smiles shyly and holds up a hand in greeting. He’s god yes, but he’s also still Dean’s kid, still unsure of himself in Dean’s gaze.
“I think I’m gonna go for a drive.” He says, still looking outside. He looks back at the table to see Bobby smiling already knowing, Cas, worry written across his face. Dean slides himself out of the booth.
At one of the long tables in the room sits a horde of Ghostfacers, all excitedly arguing about if the pink himalayan salt was a better protection against specters than iodized table salt. An amused looking Jesse and Cesar Cuevas sit at their table, a horse-riding helmet hanging off the back of Cesar’s chair.
I was heartbroken and hurt. Was this all my fault? Was I going to go to jail? What's going to happen? Can we even afford this? I hadn't realized at first but I had started to cry and the nurse silently slipped out of the room. I looked up at Cas in desperate need of his comfort and love and attention. I hope he would forgive me, I wasn't thinking, I remembered when my dad would approach me that way and I-
"Cas!" I felt strong hands grip my shoulder and shake me. I leaped up from my chair and turned around pinning the person to the wall. My vision was blurry and it didn't help that I couldn't see very well in the dark. I wiped the wetness away from my eyes and focused on the person in front of me. I let go as soon as I realized it was Dean.
"Are you okay?" I could hear him slowly near me. He took a step back and suddenly tripped over a rock. I ran over to him to make sure he was okay while saying sorry and trying to explain but the words couldn't come out. Once I got over, I saw him pick up the rock and suddenly the world went black.
I looked around at the trees and such before turning my attention back to the conversation only to find my eyes settle on Cas' arm. I looked wide-eyes at Sammy and he did the same. Before we could question Cas, he ran off. After that, Dean picked us up and we rushed over to our house. We got in and started baking and cooking making a mess out of the kitchen. I laughed when Gadreel got home and saw the mess. I ran over and pulled him into a hug thankful for him being home. Although most might not cherish him, I do.
As much as I love you Dean, I think this would be my end. I'm sorry I never got to tell you just how much I love you. I'm sorry I never told you that it's my fault. All of it. How you grew up. How horrible everyone was to you. It was all my fault. I know your dad was cruel and people bullied you and everything but I'm the one that spilled the beans. I'm the one that told everyone one was a drunken abuser. I'm the one that told everyone you're- or at least you thought you were- bisexual. I'm the one that screwed up your life and I think deep down inside you know that. I think that's why when I moved with you to the next school you didn't question it. Everyone always made jokes that I was your little puppy. When people talked to me they always said I was your friend. It was never the other way around. You were never my friend. I was your friend. That's how everyone saw it. You have seen a lot- more than a kid ever should- growing up. You've been through a lot and I know it's been hell. I'm sorry your life turned into hell because of me. I loved you and I always have. When I first met you, I looked up at you and thought you were like the sky. You weren't the sun but you were more. You were the sun, the clouds, the moon, the stars, all of it. You had your ups and downs just like the clouds. You had your bright times where you shined like the sun. You had your quiet days like the moon. You were just my everything and yet my nothing all at once. I didn't know at first- that I love you- I didn't realize it. I thought I just admired you- that I wanted to be you. I looked up to you and did everything you did but then I realized I didn't want to be you, I wanted to be with you. That's when everything changed. I think... I think that's when I started to distance myself from you. It was never you. You didn't push me away. I pushed you away and it hurt you like hell. I could see it in your eyes, I could read you like the sky. The clouds were coming in and they were dark and the load was suddenly too much for them. The water started pouring out and the sky was dark and the moon barley shined through. The sun wasn't visible during the day and it seemed like things were never going to clear up. Then, I talked to you again, and the skies cleared up just enough to have a rainbow shine through- I think that's when your world changed.
“Thank you for walking me over to my car but it’s best I get on my way home. My girlfriend is worried sick about me,” I smiled up sweetly at her.
I stopped by the area near the bridge and took a deep breath. This was the final place Cas could be and I really hope he's not here. If he isn't here he might just be at someone's house that I haven't checked or out of town for an errand. I walked through all the trees making sure to check everywhere and go inspect everything that moved. I finally arrived at the bridge where the fast water ran under and took a deep breath as I approached. I found Cas seated on a blanket by the side of the water. He had a basket next to him and I slowly approached him. As I got closer, I could see that he was crying.
“Yea, the fire had just happened and,” Cas stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay before he continued, “your mom had just passed.”
My parents kicked me out as soon as they realized that I was gay. Most people think I'm gay anyways. No one really gave me time to explain that I was bisexual. I just told my parents that I liked boys one day and they immediately assumed. They told the school before they kicked me out of the house. The word got out from the principle to the teachers and from the teachers to the students.
“I want to talk to you privately later today, don’t worry it's nothing bad,” Meg smiled and then left, she rushed out the room in a hurry and I glanced towards Dean. He must’ve noticed the confused look on my face but it seemed that he was just as confused. He both turned to look at Sam at the same time, he seemed just as confused as the rest of us and soon we turned into the trio-of-the-confusedos.
“It was an accident! I didn’t want to hit Sammy! Dad finished up with me and I needed to get myself to our home so I could get to a first aid kit. I had some serious gashes and glass chunks in me! I was trying to get away. Went to a gas station, Sammy needed to pee and when I did a 180 to try and turn around I just so happened to hit the moose like a deer,” Dean chuckled, “I thought I hit a shelf.”
“Dean,” I brushed my hand across his cheek and made circle motions behind his ear with my thumb, “you don’t have to worry about me. I’m okay I just want you to be okay. I just want you to get better. You matter.”
I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now. Self harm and suicidal thoughts were a horrible side effect to that. A little more sadness wouldn't cause much more harm than has already been done. I've been abused, neglected, bullied, hurt, and so much more.
“Oh, well then, tell Cas and Dean I’m happy for them. They deserved it. Also, Sammy, we’ve got some dinner plans to make,” Gabe hung up and left everyone to pester Sam.
“Because why?” Cas asked, using his baby voice too now. His hands were now clutching onto the blanket like his life depended on it.
“I mean, I don’t know. You haven’t been yourself recently. Not that it’s a bad thing. You just don’t seem to be looking forward to the date.”
“All our troubles left in the current of the wind, letting the newfound wave of joy take over,” I added.
“Aw, I’m sorry to hear that, Darling,” Meg turned to look at Dean and then her gaze flickered between me and Dean.
“Anyways, I’ll talk to Dean later. It’s alright, Cas. I know you still care and we will keep in contact. Alright?” Meg smiled at Cas, “You have my number, give it to Dean too.”
I ran through the dark alley and chased after Sammy. I smiled when I caught up to him but the person I caught up to wasn't my Sammy. His eyes were black and his soul was dark, maybe even gone. His laughter echoed off the walls and he screamed as he sang. I slowly approached him and tried telling him that I loved him and that he should come back to me. But it was too late, Sammy jumped down and into a long ditch that looked like it would never end. I screamed and sobbed wondering why I never told him that I loved him.
I wrapped my arms around Cas and pulled him closer to me. I love him so much and I wish we could always be this way. Cas looked up at me and I loved the way his eyes twinkled in the dim light. He gave me life and suddenly, I had meaning again. I leaned down to kiss him again but before I could, Crowley burst through the doors. I didn't bother looking up but instead I rubbed Cas' back and went to go grab my jacket for him.
"I AM AWAKE!" I ran out the door and was surprised to find Lisa sitting outside on her phone. I squealed when I felt Dean's strong arms grip me and drag me back to his room.
I ran around town trying to find Cas but I couldn't. I ran and I ran and I ran looking everywhere. My fears began growing and before I knew it I was panicking. What if something happens or what if something already did happen. I've been so caught up in myself and all my self-loathing and pity that I forgot about Cas. All the problems he has- all the things he faces, what if he's tired? What if he finally gave up and can't keep going. What if I broke him enough. I never got to tell him. What if I never get to tell him. My panic begins to sky rocket and I'm running around like a lunatic going in and out of every shop, every alley, every street, every park, everywhere.
I groaned as I got up from my bed, last time Dean was here it didn’t end well and I had asked the nurses and my family not to let him in because I didn’t want to let him see me like this. While I was here, I befriended the nurse, her name being Meg. Soon, one thing led to another and though it may seem unprofessional we began to date. She would come over and leave flowers on my desk and wonderful little love letters neatly hidden inside. We would sneak in kisses with one another and sweet talk each other. She would bring up references I did not know and soon enough I loved her. Though I may not love her just as much as I do Dean, she’s what I’ve got and I am grateful to have her. Perhaps, she could be what will allow me to get over my love for Dean Winchester.
“Well,” Sam smiled, ready to speak, “I have a lot to say. So, get this Meg. Dean didn’t exactly realize what he felt for Cas until it was too late. He already found a girlfriend, Lisa. Lisa and him are still together, however, during this relationship, he found Cas. He tripped and fell so hard, he didn’t realize what he was doing until you rose back up and got a new view. Dean knows Lisa loves him. Dean loves her just not the same way, he loves Cas. So, Lisa may or may not be on her way right now. He needs to find a good way to break things off.”
As Castiel stands there idiotically trying to process that sentence, Dean pipes up from the kitchen, “Oh yeah I was gonna ask you, Cas, is it okay that Lisa stays over tonight? You got no big parties planned here, right?”
Dean held his flannel closer to his nose. His eyes blurred from the sharp headlights on the road. “Going too fast,” he muttered.
him to come over, so they could talk or some bullshit…” Shaking his head, Dean says firmly, “but I’m done talking about it.”
“Just… “ Dean attempts for a serious face. The last thing he wants is an irritated Cas. He pokes at Cas’ baseball cap, disturbing the already-messy bedhair underneath. “Just, lose the cap, okay? It’s too jock-meets-nerdy-professor.”
The wind battered at his back as he walked away from Jen and the construction site, the smell of smoke polluting the air.
“With everyone. I flirt a lot. And I get too friendly and shit. But it doesn’t mean anything, okay? I’m not trying to do anything. Or get in anyone’s pants and… especially not yours because,” he gestures to Castiel again uselessly, “you know. So I’m sorry if I’m freaking you out, I just—“

But they found a rhythm. Their hands joined, and Dean guided them downward, gently gripping their lengths together. He stared, mesmerized, at the way Cas’s eyes closed, at the soft stuttering sounds that passed through his lips. Dean thought he would actually die when Cas tilted his head back, groaning, after Dean licked his palm and slid it up and down Cas’s length.
what Heaven ordered, or what God ordered, or what you want to do to me—it’s not happening. So get out of this car, go back to Heaven, and leave me
Clearing his throat, Dean asked, “So, you’re uh—saying that when you left some grace in me to communicate with. It was just latching onto this dormant grace already in me?”
“I’ll…” Cas raises a finger, like he’s going to say something else. Doesn’t. Instead he turns on his heel and takes long strides toward the exit, his trenchcoat flapping at his heels.
The woman—still unknown to Dean, because even though her eyes flicker over Cas’ shoulder and sees him hanging in the living room like a shmuck, she doesn’t say hello—exchanges numbers with Cas, teases him for Cas’ brick of a cellphone from the dark ages, and leaves with an airy goodbye. Dean crosses his arms and arches an eyebrow as Cas clicks the door shut.
“Peachy,” Dean said, reaching toward the tuner knob again, “but driver picks the music, and passengers shut—”
you know how in elementary school, when it was your birthday, you brought cookies for the whole class? well, this is my version of that - a chapter for you guys on my birthday :D sorry it's not fluffy or sweet like a cookie.
“Or maybe you’ve heard of the shuttlecock theory? Now there’s a fun one,” Gabriel added, wiggling his eyebrows in Dean’s direction.
“You’re better than having my grace,” Cas insists, grabbing Dean’s arm, pulling him toward himself. “Infinitely better.”
He ran faster, stumbling and falling as he slid down the snowy hill, his feet crunching against the ice as he hit the frozen lake. His balance teetered and faltered as he tried to run across the lake, his feet slipping out from underneath him.
Cas' eyes flicker to the phone on the nightstand, and then back to Dean's. His eyes are swimming with grief. "When Heaven decides a course of action, there isn't anything you can do against it," he whispers.
“They were wise words. It’s why I kept returning to that ‘shady bar’.” Cas turns to Dean, a soft smile on his face. “And the ‘shady bartender’ that became one of my best friends.”
“Other uses will have to be employed.” Before Sam could ask what the hell that meant, Cas once again pushed his fingers to Dean’s forehead.
“‘kay.” Dean smacks his knees with his palms before rising. “Well, I’m gonna check out the local library, see if I can get internet to research up on this Vetala thing. Maybe there’s more we can figure out.”
“Yeah, but.” Dean let out a sharp breath. This was stupid. They kissed on a porch two days ago. It shouldn’t be this big of a deal.
“How can you act like it’s nothing? Over and over—Jesus.” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “I should have known better, I really should have but I—every fucking time, it’s the same.”
—“ He jabs a finger into Castiel’s face, “—have a lot of explaining to you, you uptight goddamn bastard.”
“You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to do this,” Cas whispered against Dean’s lips. “How much I thought I would never have it. Never…”
“I was planning on asking her about the killings,” Cas says, a little affronted. He watches as Dean sits across from Cas with his own plate of food, rolling up the sleeves of his red flannel.
Cas drew in a quick breath, his jaw clicking shut as he stared. Lightning flashed; the storm suddenly slowed, the rain suspending.
“I’ve gotten better,” Cas protests. “Interrogating humans and interrogating angels are entirely different things. I was one of the best interrogators in Heaven, I thought it would translate.”
of it all. He doesn’t want to see Dean’s anguish anymore. Doesn’t want to experience his own. He just wants to shut his eyes against the world.
we're getting very close to Dean finally yeeting his ass into the Empty and getting his funky little angel back, don't worry—especially now that Sam's more on board. (or IS he......??? jk it's fine he is. he's not the obstacle anymore. but there IS another obstacle... maybe more... *moonwalks away*)
The past week has been taxing; Castiel has observed every one of Dean’s increasingly frequent dates with Lisa. Every smile, flirtatious word, and touch between them, Castiel was obligated to record.
,” she said, bringing the side of her hand down onto the opposite palm. “Fighting isn’t going to help anything!”
Lacy’s face lights up when she sees the bee on Cas’ face. She points and starts giggling hysterically. “Me next!” she cries out, lifting her arms in the air.
Silence. Dean whispers to Cas, “You go around the corner through the back, get her at gunpoint. I’ll keep her distracted.”
Dean sighs and slumps into the pillows. He opens an eye and frowns at Cas standing over his side. “Are you going to stand there for a whole hour?”
Dean’s not sure why he’s holding his breath; especially not sure why his chest constricts to a painful pitch when Cas replies, softly, “I don’t have much experience with what you’re describing.”
He floated aimlessly through a dark and empty space. Dreams pushed at his mind, like distant storms on the horizon: a hole of bubbling black liquid, demons attacking at a lone gas station, tired green eyes staring back at him in a mirror. He turned away from them. And the storms passed.
Dean let out a quick, hitched breath. He held Cas’s blue, intense gaze. Something in his chest sagged; unwound. There was that same pull that had guided him toward Cas’s voice, except this time, Cas was right in front of him. Here, and alive.
The voice didn’t reply. Scratching his fingernails against his palms, Dean glanced up at the sky. It flashed silver and blue as he heard the Empty’s distant roar.
A frown crosses over Claire’s face, and she wonders how the hell he would know — but he seems so sure about it, that she doesn’t push it.
Cas’ posture is as militaristic as Dean saw it when he first met him—spine straight and hands clasped at the small of his back. “I’m not uncomfortable with you, Dean.”
Cas looks different, yet the same: slightly hunched shoulders (not new), a leather jacket (that’s new), and scuffed jeans with equally scuffed work-boots (what is he, a lumberjack?). He doesn’t look like he belongs; then again, Cas has never been quite a part of this world.
Lisa coughs, quietly, to get their attention. “Look, Castiel, it’s great that you’re trying to help but… I think this is a dead end.”
The coffee pot sputters behind them; Sam lets out a joyous noise and turns to watch the coffee drip into the pot. He pours the liquid into two coffee mugs before it has a chance to finish.
