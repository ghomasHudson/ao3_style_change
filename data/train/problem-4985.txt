"Sam, whatever you’re seeing —it’s not real." His voice is pleading and soft.
He looked past Sam anyway, as if it could make his niece's face appear behind him, but he only saw cloudy dawn and rain falling softly.
Sam has a miffed expression on his face, the one he puts on when Dean makes fun of his true crime obsession or some weird movie he likes.
The silence in the car is deafening.
"Sometime back, I’d suspected there might be a case and you and Dean both thought I was mistaken."
Sam's shoulders were tense. "God, Dean. Don't you realize how insane you sound? You really need help!” His eyes gleamed as they used to before he went in for a kill. "We went to the movies together, unplanned. That’s it.”
He's expecting a lit tap on his forehead, but instead Castiel reaches for his hands.
Castiel considers knocking on Sam’s door. If he sleeps, he does not want to wake him.
"I fell asleep, and when I woke up, he wasn't there."
"I'll tell you, if you tell me," she says, challenging him.
"Dean tends to get restless very quickly. You know that."
Sam hesitates for a second before taking it. They don't immediately let go when he stands.
Sam throws him an irritated side glance. "He was going to kill you."
A cell phone was ringing a friendly, annoying tune. The tone was painfully familiar. Sam had left his backpack with him while he went to get the food. Dean hadn't wanted to look, he really hadn't, but maybe it was important and... slowly he opened the zipper. The cell phone lay on top of Sam's jacket. The blue light of the display shouted a name at him. Dean's heart clenched painfully. After an eternity in which he struggled against the impulse to pick up the phone and ask Castiel why the hell he was calling Sam right now, the ringing stopped. There was silence for two or three seconds before it started again.
"You know me well," Castiel says. "And I know you well. And I'd like us to know each other even better."
"Must have? Did you see them leave?"
Sam takes Castiel's hand, brushes his thumb over the knuckles and lets go. He feels more free than he has in a long time. Hopeful, the possibility that things might be looking up for him. He can see the perks of being alive like this. With a breeze on his face and someone he loves by his side.
Cas’ hand appears on his knee. It’s supposed to be reassuring, he can tell, but it just makes him tense.
"Jesus, finally." Dean welcomes them back with a strained grin on his face. "What took you guys so long? Do I even want to know?"
"Oh god, poor you. Sam's a real monster, huh?"
"I do, but your grace-"
"Come on, Sammy. Your first post-mortem meal. You gotta have something in mind."
"No, you don't. You weren't surprised at all about the accident. Because you knew something like that would happen at some point. And Sam is right about another thing too.” Dean pulled his hand away and clenched it into a fist. "If I trusted you, I wouldn't be so scared of losing you all the time.”
"They weren't naked," she says.
Dean doubted that Japanese mythology really intrigued his brother that much. Sam was unusually curious and inquisitive by nature, but even his brain had limited nightly storage capacities.
"I don't see anything."
Castiel came closer. "I have an idea, but I understand if you’re hesitant."
She embraced Dean briefly and then ran back to Sam to hug him as hard as possible.
Sam presses his lips together, just like he'd done last night when Lucifer had tried to kiss him the first time of many. Like he'd always done in hell before he'd eventually stopped fighting altogether.
The tension between Castiel and him gets stronger the more frustrated they get. Of course, no one in the coffee shop can tell them anything.
"Exactly!" Lucifer claps. "That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. Why can’t I? You want to hear my theory?" He takes Sam’s hand and pulls him up further, into a full sitting position. "I mean, really, it’s your theory, but you know what I mean."
»Sam?«
"No." Sam thinks about it. "Nothing that has to do with you as a person anyway."
"But Cas-"
Dean knows he should be annoyed, but when he looks up at him, he can't help feeling validated by the irritation on Castiel's face.
"Do I make the people around me unhappy?"
"Yeah, sometimes you do. But mostly you'd rather not. And it's not because you don't like the taste." Dean laughs. "Of course not, because bacon is fucking delicious."
"You could just call him," Dean says, making Sam look up.
"First of all, we decided against it because we couldn't give them the address of the bunker and we can hardly transfer the school money with our fake credit cards."
Eventually Dean said: "If I didn't believe in us, would you think I'd have stuck this out for so long? But let's not kid ourselves. We're not happy, what's the point in denying that?”
This was too much. Dean no longer managed to keep calm. "What the fuck was that all about earlier?” He took a step towards Castiel and shoved him against the collar bone. “What is wrong with you?”
Dean snorts. "You sure do."
She snorted. "Yeah, sure he does."
"Yeah." Sam sits up, scratching his chest through the cotton of his t-shirt. "Morning."
"My brother’s got a cold," he says instead, putting the cans onto the counter so he can pay. "He’s quite the snorer."
Castiel folds up the paper, expecting something more interesting from the brothers than the grand new opening of a butcher on 5th Street.
"That's too bad." She shrugged. She looked genuinely saddened to hear it. "I thought maybe it was true."
Castiel stretched out his hand and made a move towards him. Then he froze, thinking better of it, and lowered his arm. He stood stiff as a board. "Dean. All I’m asking you is not to make the situation more complicated for all of us than it already is."
"It's not about him." And then: "And I'm fine, Dean."
"Okay."
"Yeah, I know, but…" Dean halts and studies his brother’s face. "Oh right," he eventually says. "You don’t want me flirting with your boyfriend, I got it now. Noted."
Sam could see that Charlie was about to lose her patience.
Sam smiled. "Logical."
He considers his brother's profile. Sam's lower teeth scrape over his lip, worry etched in every line of his face.
For a second, Dean thought he'd heal him. He didn't.
"Or whatever works for you guys. But I wouldn't bet all my cards on this one horse."
"I never even considered that," Sam says, all serious. "Ever."
Seize the day.
»It's okay, Sam. Really. It's all okay. Just try to get some sleep.«
The thought of Sam arriving seemed to disturb her. She nodded a few times.
"Hello, Dean."
"It’ll be two more weeks of you being okay. Maybe by then I'll find it easier to trust that you can take care of yourself again."
Castiel watches him with big eyes when Sam pockets his phone.
"Wasn't this an attempt to express your discomfort about its inadequacy?"
Castiel looks a little forlorn, and Dean wishes he could take that look off his face. He wonders if Sam sounded angry. If he's pissed they're keeping him waiting.
"What?" Dean acts all innocent.
"And that matters to you why?"
"I know what a date is, Dean." Sam’s face softens. "Why the hell would you think I’d want to move out?"
Sam nodded slowly.
"I’m serious, Sam." He pats his brother’s shoulder. "Do what you gotta do. Just don’t get all crazy like this and start telling me how my friendship with Cas works, ok? I’ve been on this particular rodeo for a while now."
"I mean, they can keep each other company and he can heal him just as well. He doesn't need me for that kind of stuff." The same pleading look from before. "Please, just come in for just one second. Don't leave me hanging like this. I don't want to be alone in there."
"You know you could have called," Sam said. It didn't sound like an accusation, only worry and relief.
From anyone else, Dean would have taken it as an insult. But Castiel's words were without any cynicism. They were caring. He was worried about him.
"I honestly don't know."
The bar keeper looks uncomfortable when they show their badges. He puts down the rag in his hand and runs his fingers through his short black hair in an unmistakable gesture of fear. "Um, FBI, but why? The police said —"
"Lila will heal." Castiel sat down on the couch, a finger breadth away from Sam. “And your brother is unharmed."
Castiel grimaces, "Sam seemed conflicted about the topic, but I'm sure he still felt uncomfortable. Maybe not so much by Lucifer's presence, but because of knowing he was hallucinating."
"So what do you think?"
"How did you learn to cook so well?" he asks, his voice full of admiration.
"Talk."
"You hungry?"
"Okay." Sam breathed out in relief and turned around.
"Oh," she says sheepishly, although there's still doubt written in her features.
Then, without another word, Castiel is gone and Sam is alone on the sidewalk, staring into thin air.
Well, not all smiles, of course. He's still Sam. At the best of times, he's still an annoying know-it all with an aptitude for noticing all the wrong-doings in the world, with an eye for the weak and oppressed that makes it close to impossible to stay cheery for too long.
Dean clenches his jaw. If Cas is so good at reading his feelings and knowing what he wants and needs, why is he just sitting there, not saying anything? He should stand up and get so close that the proximity makes Dean run away again. That's their thing, that's how it works, and it's what Dean craves - even if it’s just because he's not allowed himself to crave more.
"I didn't mean to upset you, alright?"
"I will explain everything later." Castiel pulls away slightly, still holding onto his shoulders. His eyes are scanning Dean’s face.
Dean kept casting looks at Castiel. He was acutely aware he'd never really answered his question. The truth was easy enough, but Dean didn’t really trust the truth to work in his favor. He shouldn't be taking Castiel back, not like this. He knew it. And yet, he thought, if they’d spend any minute longer in that bedroom together, who knows what would have happened. It was hard to concentrate on anything else.
"I don’t see how that’s relevant or cause for anger. Why does it unsettle you so? If he now found out that he liked a type of food or drink he previously thought he did not, it would not make you question his very being. You wouldn’t feel the need to alienate him."
"Charlie was looking for you," Sam told him and Dean nodded. "Thanks."
Castiel is the one who first kicks off his shoes, gets out of his jacket, and then takes the steps towards Sam. He puts his hands on Sam's arm and says, "You remember to tell me beforehand if anything should go awry?"
Dean looks down at his phone, at the blank screen. He can hear the water heater, then the water itself.
"What are you proposing?" Cas asks, sitting down on the armchair besides him.
"Maybe we should hang around a bit," Dean says. "This whole thing still sounds sketchy to me."
"And you didn't think to do something when they all went cuckoo?" Dean asks. "Call the cops?"
He shut the door behind him and found him face to face with Castiel. The hallway was narrow, but not so narrow that he needed to stand quite so close.
Just as if they hadn't talked on the phone last night. Or maybe exactly because of that. What did he know?
"Right." Sam looked up at the bunker ceiling. "Because not fighting and things being harmonious are the same. Just look at me and Dean.”
Dean started the car, turned on the music and speed his way out of there.
"I don’t want to," Castiel eventually says. "Do you really want me to?"
The look on Dean's face was the same he had when he was about to cut a monster's throat.
Castiel nodded, prompting him to continue.
"I can read the headlines, thanks."
Castiel doesn’t object but he hardly moves a muscle himself.
Rrr-rrr-rrr.
He considers Sam carefully.
Dean looks up. These are unusually bitter words coming from Castiel. "What the hell did I do to you?" he asks, honestly confused by the hostility.
Castiel looks doubtful.
Sam huffs out a laugh. Castiel is pulling a "It's not you, it's me" and he's calling him his boyfriend while doing so. Right. As far as reasons for happiness go, this is pretty absurd.
»And you're sure we'll get rid of the ghost like this?«
Who does that?
Even now, the morning after, in that damned empty school, he still can’t make head or tail of it. He gets what Castiel and Sam had both tried to tell them in their equally in-apprehensible way. Of course Castiel was alluding to Lucifer's abuse.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean says instead, his voice slightly watery. “I love you so much.”
“Do you, Dean Winchester, take Castiel to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
Dean blinks down at his hands again, and he tries desperately to rub the stain of the blueberries off on his apron. It isn’t coming off. Dean blinks again and feels a tear fall down his cheek. Dean shakes his head quickly, unsure of what’s going on, unsure of why he’s crying over his fingers being stained with berry juice.
“Cas, behind you!” Sam calls, breaking the moment. Cas spins on the spot, swinging his knife out and decapitating the vamp in one clean, powerful stroke.
Dean groans slightly, the ache in his neck and shoulders stubbornly reminding him of how he is slowly but surely getting older. That thought is quickly swept from his mind, however, as he reminds himself that it is a privilege to have made it to the age where his back cracks and his shoulders twinge when he gets out of bed in the mornings.
Dean looks around, taking a second to assess the situation they’re in. There are still twelve vampires left. He’s pretty badly injured, though he thinks he can still fight thanks to Cas’ makeshift tourniquet preventing him from losing too much blood. Cas and Sam are unharmed, but Dean can tell that they’re getting exhausted. All in all, Dean determines that the likelihood of the three of them surviving this is very low. Maybe a 23% chance. And that’s being generous.
Dean sets the mixing bowl down on the countertop, watching Cas through the window as he digs in the front garden. The idea of getting married to Cas had crossed Dean’s mind before, of course, but he’d never entertained it for long. What he feels for Cas, the bond that he shares with him, runs deeper than marriage, in his opinion. He doesn’t need a fancy wedding or a legal document to know that Cas means absolutely everything to him. That Dean wants to spend the rest of his life, and whatever comes after that, with him.
actually married to Cas, even though it feels like he is.
, so instead he reaches up, takes Cas’ face in his hands, and kisses him. Time slows to a crawl, stretching out eons in either direction, allowing Dean to drink Cas in, the taste of his lips, the feel of his skin under Dean’s fingers. Cas makes a small noise of surprise before returning the kiss, a little uncoordinated but with so much fervor that Dean’s head spins. It’s as simple as they come; just a press of lips on lips, no tongue, no teeth, but it’s also the best kiss Dean’s ever had.
“We both love flowers,” Florence elaborates, and Arthur nods. “I was a plant biologist before I retired. I love all plants, of course, but my specialty was flowering plants.”
“I’m serious, Dean,” Cas says earnestly, a sudden strength to his voice that has been absent for far too long. He pauses for a moment before a slow smirk curls at the corners of his mouth, bringing a spark of youth to his features. “After all, eternity is nothing when you have the option to die next to the finest piece of ass this Earth has ever seen.”
Dean picks up the primrose from his bedside table and holds it delicately in his hands, thinking about how Cas could also very well have died if they’d continued hunting. He knows that he wouldn’t be able to live without Cas either, knows that it would have absolutely gutted him if Cas were to have died prematurely in a hunting accident.
“Ready?” Dean asks –
Outside, the cicadas in the garden, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of flowers, sing them to sleep.
“Like a tracking device?” Dean’s sitting up fully now, feeling wide awake, a muted sort of hope glimmering faintly in his chest.
Cas’ gaze sweeps across the front yard. “I especially love your garden.”
Sam sounds so wistful as he talks about her that Dean honestly wonders if he’s been possessed by a lovesick thirteen-year-old.
They are both silent as they mount the stairs up to the main floor of the bunker, every step Dean takes feeling heavier and heavier, as if there are weights tied to his ankles. Dean’s mind feels simultaneously empty and also full of disjointed thoughts, but all of it coalesces into an overwhelming sense of loss. He feels hollow, like Cas had taken a part of Dean with him to the Empty when he died, which maybe he had. Cas had held his heart in his hands for years, Dean realizes as they reach the landing. Dean had given it to him without knowing he had. He holds a hand over his chest and Dean is almost surprised to feel that his heart is still there, still beating.
Sam and Eileen arrive a couple of days later, and Dean immediately pulls both of them in for a hug as soon as they walk through the front door. They’ve visited relatively frequently during the two years that Dean and Cas have lived in Vermont – every couple of months or so, as well as holidays – but Dean’s always glad to see them.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean says, smiling. “Sounds like a plan.”
“Like what you see?” Dean asks cheekily.
Dean holds the notebook tightly against his chest, tears streaming down his face, and isn’t afraid to die.
Dean lives long enough after that to set his affairs in order, ensuring that the house will go to Bobby and saying his goodbyes to Sam and Eileen.
Which, okay,
It turns out not to be a lone vampire, or even a small nest, like they’d originally thought.
Dead furrows his brow. “I didn’t mean it literally.”
“Please,” Florence says, stepping back and gesturing towards the door, “feel free to take a look around. Arthur and I’ll be right here if you have any questions about the house.”
One bright summer’s morning, the sweet pea finally blooms, vibrant and beautiful, and Dean knows that it’s time.
Dean wakes up first the next morning. The pink and orange remnants of the morning’s sunrise that he can see out of the window tell him that it’s still early, but he doesn’t go back to bed. Instead, he feels content to just watch Cas sleep, laughing quietly to himself when he thinks about how he used to reprimand Cas for doing the exact same thing to him. Cas is so beautiful like this, though; he looks perfectly content, completely at peace. Dean idly wonders if Cas thought those same things about Dean when he would watch him sleep, all those years ago.
“I’m happy to be home,” Cas says, turning to look at Dean, his gaze full of warmth and affection. From the way he says
Dean bakes all morning – cinnamon rolls are apparently a lot of damn work – and loses himself in it, a sense of calm settling over him as he measures and stirs and kneads, focusing all of his attention on the task at hand. It’s a tricky recipe and Dean adds too much flour at one point, but he’s able to improvise and quickly rectify the situation. An unexpected feeling of pride warms his chest when the dough is able to take up the excess flour, turning slightly sticky just like the recipe says it should. It feels good – amazing, really – to make something with his hands and to know that he’ll be able to share the end result with Cas later. To know that what he made will make Cas happy, even if it’s just a cinnamon roll.
Dean completely deflates, Cas’ words striking a chord in his chest, in his heart. He wants to grow old with Cas too, he realizes; he wants it with everything he has, with every atom in his body. Dean doesn’t want to die in a freak monster-hunting accident a couple of years down the line, like how he always thought he would. Now that he’s got Cas (and Sam and Eileen and everyone else), he wants as many days as he can get.
“Well, would you look at that,” he says, clapping his hands together. “We’d better get going.”
, Cas is saying.
Dean is pulled from sleep by the tender, lingering kiss of early morning sunlight as it streams in through the bedroom’s large windows. It fills the room in its entirety, turning the air hazy and golden with its splendor; it is the kind of sacred, precious light that the sun seems to savor for only the most perfect of Sunday mornings.
“Sam,” Cas greets, a small, guilty smile playing around his mouth. From the way his eyes are glinting when he glances back at Dean, though, Dean can tell Cas is not all that sorry. “It’s good to see you.”
Arthur hands the keys over to Dean, the metal jangling merrily as he does so.
“I found something.” Sam makes his way over to Dean’s bed and plops himself on the edge on it. “Something that could help us get Cas back.” He carefully sets the book he’s holding down – damn, the book looks
At the mention of food, Cas sits up, rubbing at his eyes and yawning. Something breaks in Dean’s chest a bit as he looks at Cas, all bleary-eyed and exhausted and perfect. He doesn’t know what emotion he’s broadcasting on his face, but Cas is gazing at him now with such a quiet, tender smile that he assumes he looks like a complete fool. A fool who’s ridiculously in love, that is. Dean feels his neck and cheeks heat and busies himself with the food.
, and feels Cas’ own breath against his neck
“I do,” he says quietly, just for Cas to hear. “I do, I do, I do.”
Sam huffs a laugh. “Yes, Dean, I know.” Dean can practically
Cas looks at Dean and furrows his eyebrows. “Regret what?”
“It was important to us to have a garden when we bought this house, since we’re both so passionate about flowers,” Florence continues. “We started working on this garden as soon as we moved in, about forty years ago now, like Arthur said.” She lets out a laugh. “Jesus, Arthur, we’re getting old!”
The woman rises to greet them, a wide, pleasant smile on her face. Dean and Cas extend their hands in greeting, introducing themselves.
Still, Sam and Cas had both insisted that they all go to check it out, which is why Dean finds himself on the road to Missouri early one Friday morning with a snoring brother in the backseat and a fiancé in the passenger’s seat.
Dean turns around in Cas’ arms and hugs Cas back, slightly overwhelmed with emotion.
Dean dons his apron 𑁋 a ridiculous thing that says “Kiss the Cook” on it (a gift from Cas) 𑁋 and gets to work. He sifts the flour, pours the milk, and cracks the eggs into a large bowl before whisking it all together. The batter is just the right consistency: a little lumpy and on the thicker side, the way he remembers it looking when his mother made it.
, he can scarcely believe that this is his life. If someone were to have told him five years ago that he would one day be living in Vermont with Cas, opening up a bed and breakfast with him, he would have laughed in their face before decking them. Now, though, it feels so – so
It’s . . . actually a pretty good idea, Dean thinks. It would be nice to be able to meet new people every once in a while. Plus, Dean’s been getting pretty handy at making a damn good breakfast.
Cas picks up the package and unwraps it, revealing an old, obviously well-loved copy of a book titled
– about how he hadn’t managed to say anything of substance back to Cas before the Empty had taken him, about how Cas had believed until the very end that Dean loving him back, that them being together, was something he could never have. Dean feels like his chest is cracking open as he tries (and fails) to get a handle on the fact that he could have had Cas, that Cas had loved him too, all of this time. It’s too much information for him to process and all of it has come too late. As he cries, he mourns the life he could have had, the life he dreams about in his weaker moments when he allows himself to imagine him and Cas together, safe and warm in a cabin, or maybe in a little cottage by the beach. They’re foolish fantasies, but he had let himself have them, these small mercies, and kept them in a special corner in his mind that he could retreat to when he needed strength. Now, with Cas gone, with Cas
Dean isn’t exactly sure how he dies, in the end. He just goes to sleep that night and doesn’t wake up the next morning, the way everyone hopes to go. Peacefully, and after a long life well-lived.
worth anything, if he’s not hunting. If he’s not making the world at least a little bit of a better place.
, Dean thinks.
At that exact moment, the morning sun climbs high enough in the sky that it shines right through the window, beaming down onto their bed. It hits Cas, backlighting his face and messy hair in a bright, golden halo of sunshine. Dean sucks in a breath, suddenly reminded of that image he had seen in his head, eight years ago now, when they had first visited this house. Dean doesn’t know why, but he feels his eyes start to prick with moisture, a lump forming in his throat.
Except maybe he does understand, Dean thinks, as he turns the sink faucet on and sticks his hands under the water. He watches, almost in a trance, as some of the red swirls away down the drain.
“Why did you decide to move, then?” Dean can’t help but ask. “It sounds like this place is pretty important to you guys.” He can’t imagine wanting to move away from a place like this, a beautiful house with a beautiful garden, a kitchen with lots of counter space, and the person he loves by his side.
They’d picked up a couple of reports over their radar of victims with bite marks and blood drainage consistent with vampires earlier that week. The deaths had occurred in neighboring towns near the southern border of Missouri, all within the span of one month. It definitely looked suspicious, but it also looked like it was likely the work of a small nest of vampires, maybe even a lone vamp.
Besides, Dean’s also curious about the house, if he’s being honest. It almost looks like something out of a fairytale.
Dean’s body feels better than it has in years. He looks down at his hands and is amazed to see that they’re smooth and strong, no longer wrinkled. His knees don’t ache; his joints don’t hurt. He takes full advantage of it, jogging until he reaches the house.
And after a particularly bad night – where Dean had nearly drowned in the sea of all his past mistakes, Cas barely able to bring him up for air – he finds a white zinnia placed carefully on the kitchen table the next morning:
something, towards his life that he shares with Cas, towards Sam’s future as a father.
It turns out to be a cookbook titled
Dean looks up at the sky and watches as a shooting star streaks across it, its tail glowing fiery white. He’s reminded of angels.
Cas continues to garden; Dean continues to cook breakfast for their guests. Cas continues to steal food before it’s ready; Dean continues to half-heartedly admonish him for it. Dean couldn’t be happier.
a perfect Sunday morning. The stormy grey weather that has smothered their small town in Vermont for the past week and a half appears to have finally bid them goodbye, leaving behind fluffy white clouds, a bright blue sky, and an eager yellow sun in its stead. Outside, even through the closed windows, Dean can hear birds twittering merrily whilst they flit from tree to tree, as if saying to each other:
Cas tilts his head up towards the night sky, the stars reflecting in his eyes and making them shine, otherworldly. He heaves a deep, contemplative sigh that rattles in his weak lungs. When he speaks, his words are slow, quiet.
Dean’s stomach rumbles again, loudly enough that Cas stirs slightly in his sleep. Dean’s decision seems to have been made for him.
Everywhere Dean looks, he’s surrounded by flowers.
As he looks around the bedroom, an image suddenly enters Dean’s mind, almost overwhelming in its clarity. It’s of Cas, laying on his side in the bed, the stickiness of sleep still clinging to his features. His face and bed-rumpled hair are backlit in a halo of morning sunshine as it streams through that front window, and he looks so calm, peaceful,
“Sam, I need you to marry us!”
Suddenly, Dean becomes anxious that Cas hates it, that it was a completely stupid purchase, God, he shouldn’t have bought it –
Dean spits, rinses, pats his mouth dry with a towel. He glances at Cas out of the corner of his eye, catching him blatantly ogling his ass. Dean stands up straight and tosses the towel back onto the countertop, waggling his eyebrows.
Dean feels a strange mix of emotions as they place the last moving box into the trunk of the car. He gets into the driver’s seat, Sam folds himself into the passenger’s seat, and they both just sit there for a while, not saying anything.
“Don’t worry, Sammy. It’ll be fine,” Dean says, handing Sam the empty flask and taking a step closer to the whirling portal to the Empty. It’s false bravado, obviously, just an old reflex in order to try and comfort Sam. By the tightness in Sam’s eyes, Dean knows Sam can see straight through his bullshit, as always. Sam gives him a small smile anyways.
When Dean laments one day about how their local grocery store always seems to be out of rosemary, Cas plants an herb garden right next to the vegetables, and Dean is never short on rosemary again.
Breathing heavily, Dean sinks to the floor, exhaustion finally overtaking him.
Cas gives him a soft, pleased smile and kisses him.
Dean leans over the sink, letting his tears fall silently but freely. He’s crying so hard that he doesn’t hear Cas come downstairs, but he does feel Cas’ arms wrap around him from behind, as comforting and warm and welcome as a bath on a rainy, cold day. Cas shushes him quietly, rocking Dean’s body gently against his own until Dean is able to calm down, is able to catch his breath. Cas turns the tap back on and squeezes some soap onto a washcloth. He takes Dean’s hands in his own before proceeding to carefully scrub at Dean’s fingers and palms until his hands are perfectly clean. Cas grabs a dry, fluffy towel once he’s done and pats Dean’s hands dry.
“Sam!” Dean calls, backing up until his back is pressed flush against Cas’ own. He raises his knife as a vamp advances on him, using his legs to kick it back until he has enough distance to lunge at it. “Eleven!”
He’ll bring their breakfast back upstairs after he makes it, Dean decides once he’s finally managed to shimmy out of Cas’ embrace, and he and Cas will have breakfast in bed, a special treat on this perfectly ordinary but absolutely perfect Sunday morning. Dean throws the comforter off of himself and stands up, arching his back until it makes a satisfying
Sam does that quick intake of breath again. Dean chances a look at him; he doesn’t look remotely surprised, only sad. Dean puts his head in his hands, grinding the heel of his palms into his eyes until he sees bursts of light behind his eyelids. He’s reminded of the night he first met Castiel, the showers of sparks raining down from the ceiling of the barn, from the heavens, and has to take a deep, steadying breath. He really doesn’t want to cry anymore.
“Don’t mock my pain, Cas. You’re supposed to be on my side.”
Dean is brushing his teeth in the bathroom of their hotel room that night when Cas wanders in, lightly smacking his ass as he passes by. Dean makes a squawk of indignation, muffled around his toothbrush, though he can’t help the amusement he sees dancing in his eyes when he looks back in the mirror. Cas smirks at him and perches himself next to Dean, resting his hip on the side of the counter. When they finally got together three years ago, Dean had been endlessly surprised by Cas’ playfulness, a side of him Dean had only ever gotten glimpses of before. He’s still surprised by it now, honestly, but it’s something he can’t imagine living without.
Cas exhales heavily. The silvery-blue glow of the moon reflects in Cas’ eyes, making him look otherworldly, ethereal.
Dean makes it all of six months and four days before he has a breakdown, the guilt he thought he had already dealt with returning with a vengeance, feeling like it’s going to eat him alive.
, those fantasies are going up in smoke, and he is left with nothing but the ashes of horrible regret.
“Why not?”
“Seriously,” Dean says, trying his best to sound threatening even though he can feel a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “I mean it.”
, Dean’s mind helpfully supplies.
Dean thinks that the violets are very fitting.
Dean is too, he realizes, but he has absolutely no energy left to make anything for dinner. He doesn’t even know where half of their pots and pans are.
“Sounds great to me,” Dean says, clapping his hands together. “Tell you what, you guys should come up and stay for a week so you can check out houses in person. I’m pretty sure we don’t have any guests coming for another two weeks, right Cas?”
Chaos reigns. Grunts of exertion and the sounds of metal slicing through flesh fill the damp, musty air of the warehouse. Dean goes after one of the bigger ones, perhaps mistakenly; he’s almost immediately thrown back against a wall, narrowly missing a piece of rebar that’s sticking out of it.
Dean grabs hold of Cas’ shoulders, bringing their foreheads together.
“By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and husband,” Sam says as he makes his way over to them, wheezing slightly with exertion. “You may now kiss the groom.” He collapses on the floor, his chest heaving.
There’s a section on sweet peas about halfway through that spans multiple pages, full of Cas’ notes detailing his many years of trial and error. At the very bottom of one of the pages, Cas, in his strong, slanted hand, has written:
“Yes.”
from anything; they’re driving
Maybe Dean is crying because it isn’t blood, it is blueberry juice, and the mess of blueberry juice can be easily washed off with a wet paper towel followed by a kiss from his mama. And maybe Dean is crying because his hands will never drip with blood again 𑁋 because he lives in Vermont in this quiet life that he built with Cas, and he doesn’t make his way in the world by killing things, not anymore. Now, his fingers will only ever be stained red by blueberries; his fingers will only ever be stained because he was creating, not destroying.
my mug with the bees on it, Dean.” – they finally pull into the driveway of the house. It’s a bright, sunny Tuesday and the early afternoon air is already warm and slightly sticky with humidity. Dean’s sweating a little as they walk up to the front door where Florence and Arthur are waiting for them, suitcases in hand. Florence pulls them both in for a quick hug.
“Twenty!” Dean yells.
Sam shakes his head. “I know you didn’t, but –” He flips to the next page, his finger tracing down the page until it lands on another piece of text that Dean can’t read. “The problem with just sending you into the Empty to get Cas is that it’s basically pointless. Not because it would necessarily kill you, but because –”
“Dean!” Cas shouts in concern, but he’s currently occupied with his own vampire. Dean glances quickly over to Sam, who’s currently occupied with two. The vamp
“Zero,” Cas says immediately, following Dean to the ground.
Cas grumbles slightly in his sleep, the quiet noise pulling Dean from his musings. He turns and looks down at Cas, at his open, peaceful expression and his hopelessly rumpled bedhead, and Dean’s heart just about bursts in his chest. Cas reaches his hand out towards Dean’s side of the bed, seemingly searching for something. He eventually finds Dean’s pillow and pulls it closer to him, burying his face in it before falling back into deeper sleep. Dean thinks his heart may actually burst, then.
The three of them look at each other, communicating silently in a way that years of companionship has allowed them to. Dean gives a small nod of understanding as they reach a mutual, wordless decision.
As Dean struggles for air – the impact had completely knocked the wind out of him – he gets an idea. He shoves the vamp backwards with all of his strength, his sudden movement taking it off guard for only a second, but it’s long enough. Dean grips its shoulders and flips the pair of them so that its back is facing the wall. Dean rams his body against the vamp, pushing it backwards until it makes contact with the wall, right where the rebar is sticking out. By the terrible squelching sound, Dean knows that the metal has met its intended target. Now incapacitated, Dean easily finishes the vamp off – “Eighteen!” – before rejoining Cas and Sam.
Thanks for reading!
"Dean I already said--"
"Shut up, Sam. Anyway, I called to tell you I'm winning Cas back tonight. So don't call me unless it's an emergency, got it?"
Castiel felt like he was fuming. There Dean is, acting as if this wasn't something important to Cas. "He wasn't good for me? Or you aren't good for me?"
Castiel stood up, his knees buckled a bit but he composed himself and walked over to Dean unashamed. "Dean." He said in a low and gravelly voice. Dean couldn't help but let his eyes flicker down to Cas' lips, his erect cock, and back up to his blue eyes and the cowboy hat. "I just don't want you to avoid me anymore."
"Sure. Sorry for being a dick." They all laughed.
"Me too." Castiel sighed and sat up quickly when he heard the bunker door slam closed. Cas turned to see Dean, Sam, Claire, and Kaia walk in. Other Dean let go of Cas' hand.
The Deans glared holes into each other before Castiel stepped between them. "Guys. Stop."
"If you'll have us." Other Dean said with a cocky grin. "I mean, you sort of are the reason our world is old news, right?"
"We heard—" Sam began
"Yeah?" Dean turned.
________________
"I guess that means I really mean it." Other Dean said with a grin. He watched as Castiel glanced at the clock.
Sam sat down, his eyes on Dean. "You can tell me. I won't judge." Their eyes met and Dean seemed unsure.
"Hey, yourself." Castiel huffed. "You two need to chill out. I'm leaving to get some groceries. Dean, I expected you to be nicer today."
"I'm doing it because I feel sorry for him, Dean. Put yourself in his shoes. Or better yet, say you and I were married." Castiel saw Dean flinch. "Say we were. Say you loved me and I loved you and we had amazing sex every night and every morning and we were happy. Even without that scenario, if I died you would do —and by experience you do— anything to bring me back, right?"
As if on command, Castiel surged forward and took all of Dean into his mouth. He almost gagged, but he took a deep breath and flattened his tongue. He felt Dean hit the back of his throat. He sucked in his cheeks and began bobbing his head on Dean's dick. He heard Dean moan and felt those same, thick, fingers course through his black hair. Castiel moaned in delight.
"See ya." Dean scoffed in return. When Castiel left with a slam of the door, Dean noticed Sam staring at him. "What?" He snapped and Sam shrugged while shaking his head.
"I won't." Dean said, his tone matching Cas'. "I realized that I was being an idiot." He chuckled. "I was just embarrassed and I'm sorry for avoiding you."
"Dean is kind of right," Sam added, "you would have hurt him more; had you started a relationship with him again but wanted someone else. It's good that he knows you're not one-hundred-percent into him early on, rather than later when you both could have developed something stronger."
"Hey." He said softly.
"Alright." Other Dean repeated.
The bunker door slammed behind him. He was left with nothing but what he had on him. A green shirt, a red sweater, and his jeans. Dean has been in such a hurry to get him out of his hands.
"Mhmm!" Castiel moaned and his eyes rolled back. The pleasure was overwhelming. He felt his abdomen tighten and heat up. "Fuck, I think I'm—"
I always love to hear feedback, so pls comment if you want to :) ill update asap!
"Hell yeah I am! This guy is stealing my thunder. I haven't been flirting with Cas for 11 friggin' years for some computer nerd to come along and sweep him off his feet in two seconds." Dean huffed and grabbed the Kareoke equipment off the shelf and dropped it into his cart, still holding his cell phone with his other hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Other Dean continued. "His name is Castiel Winchester." He said with a smile. "Every morning, when I wake up, we have a quickie because who the fuck knows if we're coming home after work."
"Boy if I did!" He smacked Castiel's behind gently. Cas giggled.
"Yeah, man. Let's have a dude night. Sammy, you in?"
"Did you not hear me earlier? I said, even though he in a male vessel, he is still very much able to carry a nephilim."
Other Dean stepped closer to him, feeling confident. "Well, maybe you just needed the right person to notice. I'm Dean." Castiel snickered. Other Dean looked at him oddly.
Instead of Cas, Balthazar explained: "Lucifer is Castiel's brother. And not just 'brother' as in the polite term angels use for each other, but his actual brother. Alongside the other archangels Gabriel, Michael and Raphael."
"To talk." Castiel responded. Dean sighed and let the angel in. "Look, Dean—"
"I want to side with Cas on this one, but it is a little bizarre." Sam turned his head to glance at Cas with a small smile. "You never talk about your past with us unless it's absolutely necessary, but you're our friend Cas. We should know more about you."
"I think so." Castiel smiled, emphasising the 'I'. "I think that, despite all of the hardships, I'm where I'm supposed to be. And not by God's means, but by my own."
"Other Dean was kind to me. He respected my wishes, he complimented me and treated me like a person with feelings. He showed me compassion and love. All you do is remind me how useless and weak I am. How unimportant I am to you if I can't serve as a weapon or tool for your apocalypses which you cause by your own accord." Castiel shook his head. "I would rather be with him than with you. I no longer wish to keep our amends. You do not deserve my forgiveness and I do not wish to have your friendship."
"Well I am!" Castiel matched Dean's tone and turned to face him. "Dean needs this. He needs me. He didn't get to say goodbye like he wanted to and enjoy those last moments. I know this is the right thing, trust me."
The smell of the food, especially the beefy smell, made his stomach grumble. He wished he could buy something here but he stuck with the food that remained in his bag.
"Oh?" Balthazar took a step forward, a grin plastered on his face. Brown eyes meeting blue.
"Are you dating Dean?" Other Dean asked suddenly, he hadn't been paying attention to what Castiel had been saying.
"Not cool, man. Not cool."
Dean sighed again. "We did. We are..fixed." Dean didn't meet Castiel's eyes. "But what you said hurt Cas. And, I don't know... you're acting like this new Dean is some prodigy. Like he's better than me in every way."
"This young man I met on grinder." Cas smiled. He wasn't lying about meeting a guy on grinder. Charlie had set the profile up for him when Cas told her he was indifferent to gender and actually quite preferred men. He was just lying about going on a date.
"What?!" Dean almost choked on his cereal.
Despite the yelling directed towards her, she was giggling. She seemed unusually content. The door closed slowly behind her while she pulled the hem of her dress lower to cover her thighs. Castiel noticed now that her dress was red like the light of the bar and the dress fit tightly around her curves. She's pretty, he thought.
Balthazar let go, his eyes wandered to Cas' lips then back up. "You were always the pretty-boy angel, you are smart too but..." he grinned, "not that good at strategy. That was always my strong-suit."
Dean wasn't quite sure what Sergei meant, but couldn't ask once the trio came walking towards them. "What are the next steps?" Sam asked Sergei, supporting Cas' weight as the Angel leaned against him.
Breakfast was quiet, Castiel had busied himself in the library and the kid— (Jack? Other Dean can't remember..) was nowhere to be found. He's probably in his room—though Other Dean. Other Sam ate quietly, he looked bored and tired. Sam and Dean took no time to finish their breakfast and head to the library to help Castiel with whatever he was researching.
"Not that either." Dean raised a brow in confusion. "Why are you avoiding Cas?"
After more research, Dean and Sam headed out to a couple cities over where Claire and Kaia were hunting. They hadn't found much with their reasearch and they wanted to make sure the girls were safe. Jack insisted on going, he wanted to see the couple in action, but everyone agreed it would be better off if he stayed.
He closed his eyes.
"Yeah, that one hurts Cas. Names are important to know in this sort of stuff. Trust me, I've been there." Dean chuckled, trying to bring some levity to the room. "It wasn't meant to be dude, clearly you want someone else."
"That was nice of you, to let them stay." Castiel said with a smile trying to make up for what he knows Dean heard them say.
"Yes. It's a beautiful movie. The Bee has doubts about his way of living. He doesn't want to follow the ways of his family because he realizes that he wants to have liberty; in doing so, he falls in love with a human, which is not ideal for his species, and She helps him while he helps Her."
"Yes. Thank you, Dean." Dean was on his way back out the room when Castiel stopped him. "Hey...um, Dean?"
"I...I don't know Sammy."
"You guys are cute. I wish Dean would treat you the way Other Dean does." Jack commented.
"Yes." Castiel replied in a whisper.
"You shut your trap!" Dean growled, turning in his seat and pointing at Cas.
They both smiled and got up slowly. When they were about to open the door, it swung open for them.
"Okay! Damn!"
"Oh, I just couldn't sleep. Like you said." Other Dean answered curtly.
"Freak in the sheets?" Dean repeated, asking for an elaboration of sorts. His interest peaked.
"But he ends up almost destroying the planet." Jack interjected.
"You were listening to us?" Dean growled.
Luckily, living in such a large space gave Dean plenty of room to actively avoid Castiel. He would still greet him, sure, but he would ensure not to stick around long enough for Cas to initiate any sort of conversation.
"You visited heaven?" Balthazar interjected.
Dean scoffed and kissed Castiel's forehead. He kept his lips pressed against Cas'skin when he mumbled. "Little fucker."
He momentarily hoped someone would stop and ask him if he was okay, offer a hand or even just talk to him. He even kind of hoped an officer would come to tell him to move off the bench. None of these things happened. What did happen was that night was beginning to fall and Castiel's stomach was prickling with hunger.
Castiel nodded. "I don't require sleep. I used to watch over Dean as he slept too. Just to make sure you don't have a nightmare."
"Me too." Castiel agreed and gave Dean's hand a quick squeeze; he let go quickly.
How must this Universe's Dean feel about Castiel? Are they a couple? Is it the same ..
Dean and Sam looked at each other skeptically but Sam gave in with a nod and Dean only huffed. Other Dean stood up and hugged Castiel tightly.
"I was just hoping you could help me without the," Castiel cleared his throat, "extra stuff."
"You're putting words in my mouth Dean, you know what I mean. You and Sam have other friends."
Castiel nodded slowly. "I wouldn't mind that. Where can I purchase them?" Dean stood up suddenly and signaled for Cas to follow him, he did. Dean hurried to his room and when Castiel entered he shut the door and locked it. "Dean?" Castiel said quietly.
I'm super excited for this story. Let me know what I can improve on! I know I got like Lebanon all wrong but I live in Cali soooooooooooo idk other places lol
Castiel sighed. "Well, I'm certainly not on his side anymore. I think...ever since I met the Winchesters.. I haven't been on his side. I tried to be but..Dean and Sam taught me free will and that meant switching sides."
"Stupid Luke Tristen."
"Right." Castiel nodded. He stopped scratching now that he realized the bartender wasn't going to go away but the cat meowed for attention. "Is that alright?"
Dean was about to sing another song when Cherry Pie ended, but the crowd begged him to stop. Most of them dying of laughter and in need to breathe. Dean walked back to the table with a look of pride and a little swagger in his step.
He stared at the stick for a bit, he had never seen Dean or Sam smoke and he knew the damage it would do to his lungs but he couldn't bring himself to care. This is the first person who willingly paid attention to Castiel, not just because they had to but because they wanted to. He stood up and took the cigarette. "Thank you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you calling me an old man?" A gruff voice asked in amusement. Other Dean reacted by swirling around on his heel, glass in hand. He recognized that voice.
"Then see to it he gets better." Sergei said with a smile. "Need I remind Castiel is an impressive Russian, so even without you he will persevere. He does not need you, Winchester, so prove to him that he wants you."
"What's lube?" Jack asked Dean and Cas. Dean laughed again.
"What's he doing here?" Dean said with more anger than he should have. Sam glanced back at Dean but said nothing.
"Dean and Sam are only being good friends." Cas said sternly. Balthazar sighed heavily and turned to take a seat on his recliner. He signaled for the three visitors to sit down opposite to him on the couch, they did.
"He..he wrote you a poem?" Dean slouched.
He was at a loss. He returned to his other ideas, he could sleep beneath a bridge or in an alley. There weren't any bridges nearby, so he went with the latter. How does one approach choosing an alley to sleep in? Cleanliness, probably, and maybe how dark it was. Castiel remembered too many scenes in stories where someone would be cornered and assaulted in a dark alleyway. Light seems to be a source of protection, which sounds stupid considering what Castiel knows.
"Oh, wow." Sam mumbled. "You admitted it."
Dean suddenly felt his heart tug. Fuck...poor guy. "Oh." Was the only thing he could think to say.
Castiel entered the church, from the door he came in from he was near the altar. He looked at the rows and rows of benches where the devout people of the town would come and kneel for their faith. He remembered listening to prayers occasionally when he was a young soldier. People would come to church with their troubles and seek peace and they would leave a bit less anxious but their problems still unresolved. But at least they were now hopeful, they believed that they had let God know their troubles and hoped he would lend a hand. Later, they would thank him if it was solved or forget they ever asked if it wasn't.
"Well let's just hope it's just your grace." Dean finally mumbled. Cas looked up in surprise, he expected Dean to be angry, but he just looks...resentful.
A painful half hour later, Sergei found himself jotting down an overwhelming amount of information on Angelic pregnancies. Castiel is pregnant. Jack was going on and on about baby names to Cas as the poor angel was gathering himself back up and Sam was trying to calm the boy and leave Cas alone.
She swayed a bit, tipsy but not drunk, and her eyes fell on Castiel. She giggled again. "Hey." She said.
"Busy?" Dean questioned suspiciously.
It felt nice compared to the cold. His sweater wasn't the best at keeping him warm, he would rather have his trenchcoat -- he would rather be home. Wherever that is. He sat down again, his cigarette finished, and grabbed a granola bar from his bag of food. Tomorrow he would look for a clean toilet and maybe a shower. He would also have to start earning money soon and find someplace to stay. All of it seemed impossible now, but so did stopping the apocalypse --
"I'm not an object." Cas mumbled.
"I'd like that."
"Hello." Castiel replied, unsure but polite.
_____
He continued.
The woman moved to stand next to him, the click of her heels louder but soothing. "Can't believe these motherfuckers." She finally said, her fit of giggles having come to an end. "A girl's just trying to work." Castiel tilted his head a bit to better look at her, the red light illuminating the sharp angles of her face and hallowness of her cheeks. He didn't say anything, only listened. "I come here every weekend to do this shit, y'know? I got people counting on me at home and fuck if the people at my actual job will ever give me an easy time -- now I gotta deal with that shit here too? I fucking swear, man, can't they just let people be?"
"Sure. Probably still not nice enough for you though, right?" Dean said sourly before throwing his duffle bag on the floor and walking away.
Castiel squirmed when Dean inserted the next finger. "Dean this feels—" Castiel was going to say bad but then Dean curled his fingers inward and hit a bundle of nerves that made Castiel howl in pleasure. "good! Oh, God! F-feels so good, Dean!"
"Hello." He said. He looked past Castiel and to the fence. "Are you okay, young man?"
Dean rolled his eyes. "Screw you guys. You're lucky Cas pities you."
"I'll uh, let you get to it then!" Dean laughed, his face flushed. Castiel chuckled, a deep laugh from his gut.
"Would you like to try it?" Castiel asked with a grin, turning to face Dean in his criss-cross position. Dean turned to face him as well.
Dean looked up, confused. "Huh?"
Except, he knew Sam didn't mean that. He knew Sam wasn't assuming. Sam's intelligence and inuition had always amazed Dean. In this case, Sam was practically telling Dean he knew. He knew Dean was afraid to even make a move with Cas, and if he was embarrassed it was because he was trying something he had never tried before. He was encouraging Dean to continue, to not let the emotion stop him because who knows for how long Cas would endure being avoided?
"Okay." Castiel said simply. Dean took a deep breath, he had room to start over.
However patient, waiting for a bus absolutely SUCKED. The sun was way too hot, couldn't his father have dialed it back a bit? No, it was the fucking industrial revolution and people needing factories and cars and whatever else destroyed the planets atmosphere and let too many fucking sunrays in and --
"Yes, thank you for coming Dean." Castiel interjected. "We got a call from Claire, another hunter, she needs help with a hunt. You can pick up one of these books. We're looking for some shapeshifter with specific abilities, the details are in the text she sent. Sam has it open on his laptop."
"Okay."
"Watch over me?" Other Dean repeated quietly. Remembering.
Castiel smiled. "Well, then, I accept your apology." They stood there, parallel to each other and locked in eye contact for a long while. Up until Dean snapped out of his enchantment and realized, once again, that Castiel was completely naked.
They did not stop, so Castiel did the only logical thing he could think of. He grabbed the both by the ear and dragged them to the kitchen table. They both hissed and whimpered in pain but Castiel did not stop until they were both seated.
He thought about earlier, with Sam. He had been angry at first, hearing the story and realizing that Sam had been insinuating Dean was in Sam's shoes then. Did Sam think Dean was attracted to Cas? Did he think he and Cas had had sex? Did he think the embarrassing thing was sex with Cas?
"I can't take it off your hands--?"
"I'm a bro," Sam snorted.
"Right." Dean looked awkward. "Well, uh...breakfast is ready."
"But...he's a dude." Dean rasped.
Other Dean looked around and saw Castiel, he looked...sad. Other Dean stared at those beautiful baby blues.
"You were hardly a follower. You faked your death." Castiel snapped angrily.
"Dean." Cas said in a serious tone.
"Right there baby?" Dean moaned, panting as he guided Castiel's bounces.
"Did you and Other Dean...have the sex?" Jack asked almost seriously. Castiel couldn't help but laugh at his innocence. He felt everyone's eyes on him so he quickly stopped.
"Good."
Other Dean smiled. He knew what Castiel meant. He knew what the angel was trying to say behind vague words. The angel meant he would be grieving too; that he, too, would toss and turn thinking about the losses.
_____________________
Sam and Dean quieted.
"And you can tell everybody, this is your song." The both smiled.
Again, a silent pause; but this time...it felt nice.
Castiel turned and sent Other Dean a strange look. "No." Castiel said cautiously. "Why?"
Cas was taken back, but grateful. "Thank you so much." The boy nodded and finished logging in.
The water was cold and the pressure was too light to actually feel like Castiel was getting clean. Even so, he was grateful. He washed himself with the little soap there was available and allowed himself the time to recharge beneath the water.
"So he didn't want to marry you?" Sam asked carefully.
"Do you want to watch Netflix later? I found this new show, and I think you'd like it." It was strange to see Cas fluster now, after being naked for the entirety of their conversation and not being embarrassed.
Later that day, Other Sam and Dean were preparing their goodbyes. Dean made sure to be quick, Sam hugged the two and wished them luck, Jack was a bit more talkative; telling them to take pictures and send them with a post card. Castiel gave Other Sam a hug and he gave Other Dean a peck on the cheek which Dean returned a passionate kiss to.
"Oh, I've got a few ideas." He said with a grin.
They were washing the dishes when Balthazar snaked his arms around Cas' waist. Castiel leaned into the touch, and allowed Balthazar to gently place kisses behind his ear. Hands roamed down to Castiel's belt, and it was removed. Castiel turned around and pressed his lips against Balthazar's. They both were smiling giddily. Shirts were thrown about, and pants tugged away, before Balthazar lifted Cas onto the counter. Their foreheads pressed together when their hips were flush against each other.
"With his name while we were about to have sex?" Balthazar snapped, losing his calm briefly. He took a deep breath. "It's fine. I should have never let you go, I was foolish for ever doing so and now this is the consequence."
"That's Dean's favorite movie too. I quite enjoy it more than the other movies he makes me watch, but I will always like that movie about the bee who falls in love with a human woman."
Dean swung the door open, his eyes squinting because of the brightness of the hall compared to his dark room. "Whad'ya want?" Dean mumbled.
It was day 8 without Other Dean and Castiel finally managed to make his own breakfast. He woke up before everyone, feeling guilty about being so useless.
"Maybe. We never really talked about it. He claims it was because he wanted to be free...so I assume some part of that was being free from me. Which is strange, because he's the one who always pestered me about being in a relationship and having sex -- not the other way around." Castiel was clearly irritated so Dean decided to lighten the conversation.
"I'd buy a big house where, we both could live." He pulled Castiel closer and danced with him slowly. His free hand on Cas' hip and the other holding the microphone.
"Right." Dean laughed and grabbed the lube from his drawer. He slathered some of the gel onto his thick fingers and eased one into Cas' exposed entrance. Castiel hissed and grabbed Dean's shoulders. He left scratch marks on Dean's perfectly tanned skin.
"Enough!" Cas couldn't decide on what to look at, his eyes darting which and what way. "Balthazar, we did not come here to exploit my sexual history. Thank you for your help with the weapon, but we must go now." Castiel stalked off to the door and left without looking back at Dean, Sam or Balthazar.
Castiel and Dean watched as the couple walked out the bunker.
"You never do."
Other Dean nodded. "You're really smart."
Dean tried to help, he really did. The day after Other Dean and Sam left, Dean took Castiel to a bee farm and to eat burgers. They spent the night watching animal documentaries Cas had always been interested in watching. Dean spent days hanging out with Castiel, but he begun to tire.
"He did like you best."
Castiel frowned as he served food on a plate for Dean. He set the plate down and turned off the stove. "He's not a wacko."
She hummed and lit the cigarette once Castiel propped it between his chapped lips. She then grabbed one for herself and did the same. Cas watched her carefully inhale and exhale and mirrored her actions. Every move and tension he copied, it wasn't too bad. He strangely enjoyed the smell and appreciated the dulling of his anxiety.
"Alright." Other Sam interjected. "alright, we'll be careful." Dean looked over to Other Dean, who hadn't met his gaze, waiting for his agreement.
"Bed." Castiel agreed. Dean shoved Castiel onto the mattress and crawled in between his legs. "Do you have lube?" Cas asked.
He supposed Dean was afraid of being ostrasized. Maybe he thought Sam was homophobic, or at least that he didn't like the idea of Dean being anything but straight. Which was offensive to Sam.
Dean nodded too vigorously. They sat quietly for a moment before Cas turned back to face the screen, Dean stayed staring at Cas. Building up the courage to say: "i measured my dick."
"I know." Castiel explained. Other Dean made an 'o' shape with his mouth and nodded.
"Right..." Dean answered quietly, furrowing his brows. What is he getting at?
"Sure Dean." Castiel said with a smile.
easily hide..."
Sergei stood up, packing his things. "I will return in a month. If anything changes, call me. Otherwise, go about this normally. Eat when you are hungry. Sleep when you are sleepy. Rest when you are tired. There should be no risk to this."
"Fuck you, I'm six and a half." Dean flipped him off, Balthazar cackled and disappeared.
"Okay."
Dean stopped singing and stared into Cas' eyes. "Cas...I know I've been kind of playing the waiting game but I'm done sitting on the side lines. I want you to be mine and for me to be yours. If you really want to, I'll buy us a house like Sam and Eileen and I'll buy you all the books you want and hell, I'll try to write you poetry. But please, Cas, I need you. I need you in my life and not just as my best friend."
Castiel had made sure Other Dean fell asleep peacefully and when he saw four hours had passed after Dean had fallen asleep, he made his way to his room. Castiel knocked gently on Dean's door, he heard him stir and he heard the soft footsteps.
_____
"Sergei." Castiel set the phone down. "I had a question to ask him, but I'm sure my suspicions are wrong."
"Sh-shut up!" Sam left the kitchen.
______
"Dean..." Castiel reached out to hold his hand while Other Dean cried.
"You sure do know how to make a guy blush," Balthazar chuckled and ran a finger across Castiel's jaw, "what's in it for me?"
Cas flinched and almost tipped over on his chair when the bartender's hand made a swift movement to grab Castiel, the cat hissed and jumped from the table. "I'm leaving!" Castiel yelled in shock and anxiety. He hurried out of his chair and towards the exit, he noticed a few of the patrons looking at him while others were to drunk to bother, the bartender followed him out and made sure Cas didn't turn around.
"I have a husband." Other Dean said suddenly, sitting up. He noticed he had already grabbed everyone's attention. Sam's book closed shut, Castiel's dropped to the floor, and Dean's coffee fell from his hand making him curse.
"So do we call Other Dean? Let him know?" Sam suggested, turning to look at Dean briefly but setting his eyes back on Cas -- it was his decision.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Castiel forgave him, he had already forgiven him before he was just...annoyed for never having officially talked about it. They talked about old times, when they would hide away to kiss or whisper sweet compliments to each other. They discussed new interests, and laughed about their long-gone youth.
Castiel took a moment, hugging Dean and letting his head fall on Dean's shoulder.
"Dean," Cas sighed, "he just wants to talk. I have been wanting to clear things up with him for a long time, but never found the occasion to."
He sighed. "Sure, I suppose so. I will be leaving to Europe tomorrow, so you won't see me for a while. On that note," Balthazar patted Dean's cheek to which Dean swatted him away angrily, "I'm six inches."
Her eyes darted to the door then back to Cas. "They're a bunch of party poopers." She explained, giggling and reaching into her black handbag. "Here," she had a cigarette between her fingers and was offering it to Cas, "smoke with me?"
The drive back was filled with jokes and laughter. Ever since they defeated Chuck and Jack took on the role of God, everything was just...better. Jack is an amazing God, he works hard to make sure every Earth is working and that miracles exist. Castiel helped him occasionally but can usallt be found in the room he has taken up in the bunker with Sam, Dean, and Eileen.
Dean kept glancing at Cas through the rearview mirror, what Balthazar had said couldn't be erased from his most prominent thoughts -- "like a cowboy"; fuck. Dean wasn't one to imagine his best friends having sex, but this was really something for the spank bank. He cringed inwardly at himself, he knew he actively tried to deny his feelings for Cas...but sometimes a guy can't help it.
"Ouch." Dean said with a fake hiss. "That's a punch to the ego."
"I...I don't mean to act that way." Castiel looked down.
"Right. I forgot."
"Right." Castiel said, disappointed.
Cas looked up at Dean who was wearing his pajamas.
Sitting down was a relief. His muscles relaxed and his body sagged, he let himself lean back against the back of the bench and his head rolled back enough to make his spine pop comfortably. He sighed. At some point soon he will get hungry and thirsty, he'll need to pee and poop and shower -- among other pesky things humans do. How would he do them?
Sam maneuvered himself towards the kitchen in search of his brother. Feeling a bit like a mediator, he thought briefly about how he couldn't help but need for Dean and Cas to be okay. Despite what Dean communicates, Sam knows Castiel means a lot to him. Much more than a best-friend, Sam believes, and far much more than a brother.
"Because of Balthazar?" Sam asked, trying to put the pieces together and make it easier for Castiel to communicate.
"I'm sorry." Cas finally said before taking a seat. Sam and Jack followed, but Dean remained standing, his expression unreadable.
Dean's eyes fell to the floor, unable to look at Sam. "That sucks." He said quietly.
"Do you think they'll be big like me? Or a baby?" Jack asked, smiling. The older man shrugged in response, still not looking at Jack. "I kind of hope Castiel tells Other Dean. They could be this great big family -- you know? Normal, like in the movies. Maybe they'll buy a house with a lot of backyard space and --"
"I was messing with you." Balthazar snickered. "Do you really think, that a weapon to destroy universes would be in the shape of a rock?"
Dean had decided to stay locked up in his room until the day Sam and Eileen packed up a car in the garage anf were ready to leave. It was on that day that Dean came out of his room wearing his favorite flannel and jeans. He walked up to Sam and gave him the tightest hug Castiel had ever seen him hive the giant. Dean then moved on to Eileen, who he was careful enough to hug gently before placing a kiss on her forehead. She smiled and held Dean's hand.
But mostly, he couldn't stop thinking of his husband. Dean felt his eyes tear up. He shook his head and went back to thinking of John.
"I think you should try and get some rest. It's late and people tend to wake up early in this place." Castiel said with a smile. "If you'd like, I can watch over you."
"I thought you wanted to keep this private, Castiel?"
"I watch pornography, occasionally."
"Ooh~" Dean licked up Castiel's neck and nibbled gently on the skin. Castiel squirmed. "Yeah I got some. I found it in Sam's room."
He took a deep breath. "I'm Castiel." The man stilled but did not look at Cas.
Most of the stores were family-owned. Towns like this are better maintained, they have a sense of community, the sidewalks might even shine. Castiel, in his ragged clothes, stuck out like a sore thumb. An outlier. A rebel. He cringed and hurried past a group of people making their way to their car. He needed rest but he had no home. He looked around for a bench and spotted one in front of a bar.
They sat in silence for a while before Jack stood up and sat next to Dean. "I'd miss him too." Jack admitted quietly, leaning his head on Dean's shoulder. "But...I just want Cas to be happy."
"That's alright. You're probably tired, I assume you're unable to sleep because of all the trauma you went through today. I would advise you to listen to music or a meditation podcast. I wouldn't want you to lose sleep." Castiel said with his eyebrows furrowed.
"That too; but the other things as well. Balthazar used to send me letters with poems when we were younger. He would surprise me with compliments when I was lacking them. Likewise, I enjoyed taking care of him when he was hurt and crafting him weapons. I miss that. Perhaps not him, entirely, but that feeling he gave me." He noticed Dean's expression fall, so to lighten the mood he added: "the sex is good too, though. I miss that."
"Luke Tristen?" Sam repeated over the phone.
"Oh, so now he belongs to someone?! He's not an object!"
"Will it hurt?" Jack asked, concerned.
"I was just ensuring that you knew what to do with the stone." Balthazar shrugged as if nothing drastic had happened.
"Yeah, that and how you go cowboy. Let's explore that. Also, why Balthazar?" Dean's face was scrunched in wonder.
It's been a while! I've been busy lol, hope you like this chapter! Comment your thoughts! If you want 😅
"Oh," the priest shook his head and chuckled, "it's my job. Don't worry about it. Your name, it's of the angel of Thursday?"
"Yes, but I made it clear I was only looking for someone to talk to about poetry and such." Cas shrugged. "I just told you we were going out on a date to see your reaction."
"Hey!" Castiel snorted and smacked Dean's arm gently. "I am not little!"
The door swung open, Cas felt his knees tuck in closer to his chest in attempts to hide from the stranger's line of sight. A woman, tall and sparkly, stepped out. A deep voice was shouting from behind her: "GET OUTTA HERE FREAK!"
The man hummed. "Well, Castiel, I hope that I see you again. And that when I do you are in a better situation. But should you need any more help, come to me, yes?"
Other Dean reached forward and caressed Castiel's cheek. Castiel resisted the urge to lean into the touch. "I just need to keep that smile for a few more days. Please." He begged.
Another half an hour was spent finding benches only to realize it was useless because of its design. Most of them had handles in the middle of it (which no one probably used) and others were too round and thin for him to lay on.
Despite Castiel's claims, Dean felt like a boy again when he stepped on the stage. A smell of beer on the microphone in his hand, and a hazy screen behind him showing the lyrics to "Cherry Pie".
"Oh. Nothing, just a vibe I got. And well..." Other Dean shrugged and held the glass in both hands. Deciding not to continue on the subject. How could Dean not be with Cas in every universe? "Nevermind. What were you saying?"
"You two take care, yeah? And you tell me whenever you need help with that little devil. You better tell me the due date because I'm gonna be the first one to make it laugh, you watch." Dean forced himself to laugh as he felt his eyed water.
This time, when Sam said he was heading out for a evening jog, Dean didn't come along. He waited anxiously until Sam left and the echo of the bunker door rung in his ears. He waited idly next to the map table, unsure now for what he waited. Cas was probably in his own room, watching netflix or something. His eyes darted to the hall, he could go see him? Or he could just watch a movie alone in his man-cave.
"Watch your shit." Tom said simply before looking back down. Castiel stared, really taking in what Tom was doing. He wasn't sharpening his blade, he was whittling. Bits of wood fell to the floor or onto his pants. He was making a bird. At least, that's what it looked like.
"The Bee Movie?" Other Dean snorted.
"Yes, Dean," Cas grinned, "it is a cowboy hat." A shiver ran up Dean's spine.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Sams got back to the bunker before Cas did, so they played The Game of Life with Jack while the Deans sorted out their business. When Castiel did get back, he got back with a good amount of groceries that Jack helped him carry in and put away.
'Ana Banana, se fue a Tijuana, se echó un pedito -- pa ti, pa tu mamá.'
"How much does size matter to you, Cas?" Sam teased.
"Cancelled." Other Sam repeated. "Rescheduled to Thursday."
"How did you find this out?" Sam asked.
Other Dean smiled. "Walk The Line. The Johnny Cash movie." Castiel smiled back and turned to Jack to tell him to put it on.
Castiel looked surprised. "Sam? My Sam?"
Castiel raised an eyebrow while he poured some water from the jug into the glass. "I asked what you were doing up."
In a look around the room, Jack noticed the fact Dean was away and decided to leave Cas and Sam to go see the hunter. He hurried to the kitchen first and grabbed two beers. He knocked gently, "Dean?" he called quietly. The door swung open. Headphones were cradling Dean's neck and it seemed like a group of empty beer bottles were already gathered next to Dean's bed. "I brought you beer."
Go left or go right?
"The flight was what?" Dean, the main Dean, hissed. His face was crunched in what looked like some sort of emotional pain. Or maybe he's constipated?—thought Other Dean.
"Okay." Other Dean moved his hand away and Castiel frowned at the loss. Castiel sighed, how easy it is for him to love this new relationship only for it to ripped away.
"Oh, and, Sam." Castiel turned to see Sam. "Dean and I borrowed your lube, if you were looking for it." Sam turned a dark shade of red.
She was blonde, maybe in her 30s, and she looked very angry. "Sorry." He mumbled.
Sam's eyes went from Dean to Cas, he forced a smile. "You okay, Cas?"
"It's not like a human pregnancy, that much is clear." Sergei said. "I cannot conduct a blood or urine test. However," he walked over to Castiel, "I can test his soul."
It had been more than 8 hours of board games and movies when Other Dean walked in the living and sat next to Cas who was watching more Netflix with Jack. Castiel turned to look at him. "What movie did you and your husband like to watch?"
"Good." Castiel nodded. "Also, Dean," he turned to Other Dean. "How do we start with your healing process?"
"Um, actually. I think we can start now?" Other Dean said shyly. "I used to take Feathers to the beach..he loved it and I used to tell him how his eyes looked like the ocean. We got married on the beach. The last time we went was a week ago and I kind of want to savor the scenery with him one more time."
Castiel bounced a final time, falling harshly onto Dean's cock and came onto their chests. Quickly, Dean flipped them over and thrusted into Castiel fast and hard. "Oh, Dean!" Castiel felt overstimulated. Never had he done this.
He watched her finish her cigarette and flick it at the gravel. She stepped on it with her heel. She turned to face Castiel and flashed him a small smile before heading back to the street. Cas didn't look away from the street she went down until he felt his cigarette burning his fingertips.
"Did sex make things worse?" Castiel asked grimly.
Dean was standing up to leave, Castiel was beyond confused. "Aren't we going to finish the movie--?" He pointed towards the television.
"I never measured Balthazar's penis." Castiel said bluntly, still confused.
His words had resonated. Don't lose Cas.
"Does it...work?"
"Hey, other me, get up!" Dean said instantly before seeing the scene before him. "Oh." was all he could say.
The priest smiled warmly and nodded. "Stay here." He left the door open, Cas watched him walk towards the small kitchen and look through some cupboards. He was putting things in a bag when he spoke again. "I'm sorry I can't offer you any shelter. Our church is small since our town is small." He was coming back, he was still smiling. "There aren't many for us to help." He handed Castiel the bag, Cas took it slowly. "What's your name, son?"
"Not a lot." Dean growled. "I don't care about your sad little problems. I don't need the two of you making life more difficult. We have a priority so you two need to keep a low profile and make sure you don't cause any more trouble."
"This one's for all the pretty ladies in here tonight!" Dean bellowed with a grin. He heard some people whoop and cheer and others groan. Dean pointed at Sam and Castiel who watched from a table not far from the stage and sent them a wink.
"I'm not avoiding him." Dean answered quickly.
Castiel pursed his lips, he stood in front of Dean, trying to find the right words. "Dean I thought you and I had fixed our problems."
"You can't? You mean you don't have any money." The bartender placed his hands on his hips.
Castiel nodded. "Okay."
"I mean, how big was Balthazar?" Dean interrupted. "Like, if you were good with him, then anything bigger than him is good. Right? Or is there, like,  a TOO big size?" At this point, Dean was just digging a deeper hole. He kept trying to save himself by talking but what he needed to do was stop.
"Dean?" Castiel whispered quietly. Dean spun around, a microphone in his hand. Suddenly, a gentle piano tune began to play.
Luke is dark skinned, he has black hair and striking green eyes to contrast. Dean stared at the picture. He felt a little self-conscious. Dean tightened his robe around his waist.
"Oh, I assure you, it was perfectly fine. It would have been better, had you not been here. Isn't that right," Balthazar took hold of Castiel's chin gently, "Cassie?"
_____________
He should feel free, shouldn't he? Liberated. He isn't bound by society. He has no number, he has no identity, no last name, no expectations. But he also has no food, no home, no family. He's lost, almost in between worlds. He was also beginning to get a headache. A sharp pain surrounded his skull and his stomach grumbled again so he reached into his bag for an apple.
"His name is Luke." Castiel pulled out his phone and pressed on the grinder app. He opened the profile picture of the guy he had been chatting with.
"Of course it will." He said with a grin.
"Sergei." Castiel responded. "Did you find anything?"
"You don't know him!" Dean insisted.
"Come on! It's clear he just wants to get in your pants." Dean scoffed. "Sam, you have to be seeing this too right? What happened is: he saw you, got a boner, and wants to get down and dirty."
"Y-e-up." He snorted. "Looks like your Sammy has some guilty pleasures."
"Yeah." Castiel sighed. "It's sad, Dean, and if I can help him..."
"Perfect?" Castiel said a little too quickly. "Yeah, he does."
She huffed. "There are kids in this neighborhood. Find someplace else to stink up." She didn't leave until Cas stood up from the bench and started back down the street into town. He took the same route he took to get to the church but he wasn't heading there. He didn't really know where he was headed. He didn't know what to do -- he wished someone would just tell him where to go. He wished he had an objective or a destination but he had none. He was just...wandering.
_______________
Dean stood up and walked towards the door. He stopped for a moment, holding the door, and turned. "You comin', Feathers?" He said with a smile.
Sam was looking at Dean strangely and Castiel was holding back a laugh. Dean scoffed at both of them and walked away to the kitchen.
"'Socialize'? What do you mean? You have me and Sam. Aren't we enough?"
Castiel and Other Dean walked over to Sam and Dean.
Dean couldn't help the shiver at the thought of Cas bouncing up and down a long dildo, sweating and flexing and -- "O-okay." He stuttered. "Thick?"
Castiel pursed his lips and shook his head. "No. The poor man," he laughed bitterly, "he wouldn't know how to feel. Joyous because he's going to be a father? Or bitter because he can't parent with the actual Castiel he loves?"
"Fine." He sighed. "I also did overhear you three talking about me. And Castiel," he turned to meet eyes with Cas, "I would like to discuss some things with you."
Another look around. It all looked the same, but he knew that this decision could impact everything. Maybe, to the left, there were directions and kind people to give them and the right was death and destruction. Or, maybe, it was the other way around? How could he know and how could he ever decide? He wondered if he could just turn around and knock on the bunker door and ask Dean -- but he couldn't. That was the whole point.
Castiel nearly fainted when Balthazar said: "Oh! Be sure, I tapped that." He sent a wink Castiel's way making the angel stumble as he stood up in a hurry. "Quite the freak in the sheets, aren't you Castiel?"
"His soul?" Sam asked. "I thought their grace would be the closest thing to their spiritual being."
"Cum for me, Angel."
"So, you swore off the Lord or something?" Other Dean asked, recalling Castiel's introduction.
Sam stopped opening the pistachios and turned to face Castiel. "You don't have to do this, Cas."
___________
"Regular symptoms. Nausea, hunger, strong emotional outbursts..." Castiel sighed, moving his face into his hands. "I didn't know this could happen. I didn't take the precautions."
The ex-angel walked towards the seats, his fingers traced the smooth lines of the wood. He considered sitting, praying, but remembered that Heaven was not on his side and if he were to pray he would be leading God's wrath straight to him. He didn't belong here, in God's home, he did not belong in the bunker -- he did not belong anywhere.
Dean didn't last ten minutes into the movie. He just really need to know. "Have you used it?" He asked quietly. He noticed through his peripherals that Castiel stopped chewing on his gummy bears.
_______
He hated peeing. It felt weird. And no, he will not describe this -- he would rather not remember.
They both drank their water in a comfortable silence. Other Dean made sure to stand closely to the angel. To Castiel. What an amazing name—he thought. When the angel wasn't looking, he would whisper the name, feeling the movement of his lips as he said 'Castiel' over and over.
The streets here were nothing like that of the town he was in before. As the night pursued, people continued to occupy the streets -- not bustling like in the movies Dean would coerce Castiel into watching in the earlier stages of their friendship -- the people still had things to do at night but not as much as they did during the day. Mostly the citizens were making their ways to nightclubs, at least that's what Castiel figured by the way most people were dressed and by their tipsy mannerisms. A few were out on runs, and the smaller percentage of people seemed like they were getting home from a long day.
"What um..." Sam scratched the back of his neck. "What makes you think you're pregnant?"
Cas came to a halt, his thighs tensed and his chest heaved. "Dean." He aaid quietly, his cheeks flushed.
"My name was spoken, I am allowed to listen, it is my business." Balthazar glared. "So, Castiel..." he turned to Cas again, "do you think we could talk over dinner?"
"I'm not sure. We've just been talking about it. He's very busy so I don't expect soon."
Castiel supposed he too should be confident. So he straightened his posture, tilted his head back like Dean did whenever he was making that stupid grin that said: 'I'm right, and everyone knows it.'. He looked up and forward and he saw a cross. A cross in the sky, pedestaled by a church. A sign of faith for many.
Claire and Kaia said their goodbyes. Castiel insisted on them staying longer but Claire rejected his offer. "I've got better things to do," the blonde said with a wink aimed at Kaia, who blushed. They all laughed and watched the girls go.
He stood up in a hurry -- too fast -- and stretched his back out, he heard his spine pop at the movement. He looked around, the light of the bar had not turned off. Curious, Castiel made his way to the street and to the front door of the bar. He pushed the door open. The bar wasn't full like it had been during the night.
With a sigh and a glance to the invisible path left behind by Dean, Castiel decided. He could not figure this out on his own, although he had known Dean for a long time -- Sam has known him for longer. "It seems Dean has been avoiding me."
The man tilted his head to look at Castiel. "Excuse you." The man giggled, then proceeded to walk away. Cas wasn't sure what to do so he just stood there, like an idiot. Embarrassed, Cas decided he would just walk further into town and see if he could find something for himself.
Castiel couldn't describe this other than awkward. He and Dean were sitting and eating breakfast. Quietly and almost motionless. It had been this way the entire time since Sam and Eileen left and Castiel was getting fed up.
"Yes. We had intercourse." Castiel nodded and saw Dean stand up angrily.
Dean interrupted by holding his index finger up to hush him. "Coffee. Wait here." Dean walked out the room and left Castiel alone for a good five minutes before coming back with a cup of coffee. His eyes were open wider now and he no longer seemed so pale. "Okay, go.'
Suddenly, Castiel came up with an idea to get Dean's attention.
"What?" He whispered. Sam looked panicked
Balthazar was teasing at one of Castiel's stiff nipples, his other hand pumping up and down the blue-eyed angel's cock. Castiel was gasping, his head thrown back; he was lost in the pleasure when he moaned breathlessly: "Dean~!"
Other Dean shook Castiel's hand. Holding for a bit longer than he maybe should have. "You have a beautiful name."
"Are you still angry about that?" Balthazar stood up and placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder again, he caught Dean glaring so he decided to let the cat out of the bag. "I have apologized, yes? I know you were looking forward to our marriage --"
___________
"I don't care much about gender, but I do like being...penetrated." Castiel stared at Dean who was blushing at Castiel's bluntness. "Besides, I think I want to have a connection with the person I'm having sex with."
The two Deans agreed to be polite to one another. They wouldn't intentionally make the other angry or insulted. They weren't friends, but Castiel doesn't take long to get groceries so they wanted to at least make some progress.
Other Sam and Other Dean said they understood and thanked Dean who was already walking out the door.
"Oh, I'm sure you'll have more than words in your mouth tonight." Dean said with a tone laced with venom. He watched as Castiel went stiff. Dean felt the guilt pang against him, but he couldn't go back now, so he kept a hard face on.
"I feel like I may not know the standards for good, Dean. But whatever it might be, I'm sure the answer is no. That was less than pleasing." Castiel chuckled and offered Dean a beer. Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean slammed on the brakes. The roads were empty, so it was safe
"Don't lose Cas." Sam finally said, not tearing his eyes away when Dean looked up at him in shock.
"So," Castiel said approaching the two Deans who were watching Scooby-Doo. "You sorted it out?"
There was a pause of silence. They couldn't look at each other.
"Yeah, I guess it's getting late." Other Dean looked at the clock. It was 3 am. "I just need one more thing from you. Come, follow me."
"Don't worry, Cas, that happens to me all the time." Dean waved it off. "But, uh, are you good? Like, man, if this whole thing with you and the other Dean is serious -"
Suddenly when the trio were eating lunch, Dean asked: "Hey Cas, wanna see Tombstone tonight?"
"I'll talk to him." Sam sighed, aware that Castiel wouldn't go into specifics about what Dean said.
"I have it." Castiel began but presented nothing yet. "I found it in my quarters."
"Why don't you start up some Netflix in the man cave?" Dean suggested. "We can watch that stupid cartoon you like so much."
"I have a question." Other Dean said, clearing his throat. "You," he pointed at Dean "are clearly homophobic. But you're so loving towards those girls who are clearly in a relationship? Is it just a hate on guy on guy or..?"
Castiel fell asleep soon after that.
Sergei shook his head while he unbottoned Castiel's shirt. "His grace is his power, not his being."
Hell, she didn't even know his name. How could she truly confide in him without even that?
Dean and Sam struggled to compose themselves but did so quickly, Dean was the first to speak. "Just making sure everything is A-okay."
"So you're curious if I would like your...size?" Castiel looked even more confused at the insinuation.
Dean's legs carried him mindlessly to Cas' door. Without knocking, politeness the last thing on his mind, he swung the door opened. Shock and arousal coursed down Dean's spine. Castiel was stradling the dildo Dean had bought him, and he was wearing a cowboy hat.
The Deans nodded in agreement.
"No, Angel, of course not." Other Dean caressed his cheek and this time Castiel allowed himself to lean into the touch. "It made everything better. I feel...okay. I did with you everything I wanted to savor with you and now I need to move on before I get hooked all over again."
Everyone was quite during breakfast. It was Thursday, the day Other Dean and Sam were aupposed to be leaving but Dean looked angry, the Sams looked awkward, and Jack looked happily
The song continued, and Castiel watched Dean's plump lips move as he sang. His voice carrying throughout the room. Cas leaned closer as they danced.
Sam snorted. "Because I care? Whatever. That's not what I want to talk to you about."
"Thanks." Dean looked Jack up and down, grabbed the beer, and moved to let the younger boy in. Jack hurried and sat down on the spinning chair, he rocked side to side and watched Dean situate himself back on the bed where it was dipped slightly.
"No," Cas shook his head, "it's fine. I'm... fine." he sighed. "My grace is dwindling, I'm probably just experiencing human emotions stronger than usual." Cas forced a smile. Dean nodded carefully, they both stood there in a strange silence until Dean moved to make his way back to his room.
"She's pregnant?" Sam whispered in surprise.
He was back at square one. It felt so draining, not knowing what to do but knowing things had to get done. His frustrations produced a steady flow of tears and inconsistent sniffles as Cas walked back to the alley. Square one. He saw the cigarette bud he had tossed the night before and wished he had asked the woman who gave it to him for help -- opportunity missed. He thought of Dean and how all of this was because of him; because Dean -- Castiel's friend -- didn't need him anymore so why have him around? Why waste a room in the bunker, that had hundreds of rooms, on a useless baby-in-a-trench coat? Why would anyone else be so generous, if Dean hadn't?
"Yes." Castiel sat up. "I do, it's just...a lot."
"Okay, ask away." Castiel agreed.
Castiel smiled. "Okay. Let me get ready."
They spend the next several weeks in a perpetual state of either unpacking, furnishing, or decorating. Dean discovers an unexpected love for antique shopping during their hunt for a kitchen table, while Cas seems to prefer the more modern décor they find in places like Target. It shouldn’t work, but it does; slowly but surely, their home starts to take shape, a mixture of old and new, a mixture of the two of them.
Cas plants all sorts of things, from magnolias to hollyhocks to poppies. He tells Dean about each new flower variety that he grows, and Dean listens happily to the passion in Cas’ voice, not entirely remembering everything Cas says. Cas informs him all about the average heights, water needs, and colors of each flower, as well as their preferences for direct, indirect, or no sunlight. Dean has no idea how he manages to keep track of all that information, so one day he randomly buys Cas a notebook with a bee on the cover so that he can record everything he learns about flowers in it. Cas looks so ridiculously happy when Dean gives it to him later that day that Dean wonders why he didn’t think to do it sooner.
Dean pulls back further, placing his hand on Cas’ chest, resting it there. It calms him to feel the steady
get it,” Cas counters petulantly. “I’m the one who made the order.”
Once the edges of the pancake start to bubble and brown up a bit, he grabs a spatula from the frequently used utensils jar off to his right and flips the pancake, feeling a small but potent sense of accomplishment at the perfectly browned side that he reveals. After a few more minutes, he flips the pancake once more to ensure that it is fully cooked before transferring it onto a waiting plate to cool. He repeats this process several times: pour a dollop batter onto the pan, add blueberries, wait, flip, wait, flip, transfer. On the very last pancake, he arranges the blueberries in the shape of a smiley face. It makes him feel like his mother is beside him, if only for a brief moment.
They’re in Vermont, taking a welcome vacation after a particularly long and grueling hunt that nearly got both Dean and Cas killed, and it’s a gorgeous, sunny day outside. The sky above them is blue and cloudless, the air warm and deliciously sweet, the gentle breeze carrying with it the promise of spring. Dean’s cruising down a long stretch of backcountry road, kicking up a cloud of dust behind him as he drives, Cas beside him in the passenger’s seat. It really
He tilts his head downwards and Dean follows, breath catching in his throat when he sees it. There, right over Cas’ heart, is a red handprint.
“What do you mean?” asks Cas, a slight furrow to his brow.
Well, as properly as he can, given the fact that they’re currently fighting off a hoard of vampires.
“I love blueberries.”
Cas takes the bottom of his shirt in his teeth and rips a strip of cloth away. Dean tries very hard not to find it hot as fuck – he could literally die at any moment – but he fails spectacularly.
“This feels . . . weird,” Sam says eventually.
Dean feels like his hands haven’t been washed of blood since. He has looked down to see blood on them so many times, too many times 𑁋 Sam’s blood, Cas’ blood, his own blood.
Cas also grows things in the vegetable garden out back, and Dean uses their homegrown bell peppers many times in the more savory breakfast recipes that he experiments with.
“Oh,” Cas says conversationally, polishing off the final bite from his plate. “We got our first booking today. They’ll be arriving in three weeks and staying for two nights, I think. I got the notification while I was out.” Cas scrapes the plate with the side of his fork, gathering the leftover icing before popping it into his mouth. He makes a pleased hum, closing his eyes as if savoring the taste. “You should definitely make these one morning while they’re here.”
"It’s a big step for us," Eileen signs. "We might want to wait a couple of months."
There is a burst of white light as Dean uses the last of his strength to push the both of them over the threshold of the Empty and back into the bunker. He thinks he blacks out for a second; when he comes to, he’s sprawled on the floor, his ears ringing loudly. Dean scrambles to sit up, releasing a breath when he sees Cas a couple feet away, pushing himself up onto his forearms.
Because when you’ve bled for one another, marriage becomes kind of a moot point, Dean thinks.
“Do you wanna try one?” Dean asks eagerly. He can’t help it; he’s strangely giddy at the idea of Cas getting to taste one. He wants to share this thing that he made, that he’s proud of, with the person he loves.
Cas presses a kiss to his cheek and says, “There. All clean,” and Dean almost starts crying again.
Dean blinks hard and the image is gone, though it leaves behind a strange sense of longing that he isn’t quite sure what to make of.
“How are you feeling, Dean?” Cas asks quietly.
The abrupt shift in Cas’ tone, from playful and flirtatious to innocent and questioning, gives Dean mild whiplash.
Something tugs at Dean’s mind, however, a memory long since buried now allowed to resurface in the safety of this home that he has built with Cas. It pulls at Dean like a child might pull on the sleeves of their parent’s shirt when seeking attention, simultaneously persistent yet innocent, searching only for recognition in the eyes of someone they love.
“I got your sweet pea,” Dean says against Cas’ lips.
Nope, it turns out to be a nest of
