But instead of landing, the griffin's hind legs launch the creature into the air, and it starts flying away from Dean. It gives two flaps of its mighty wings, disturbing the leaves of the forest floor, then glides towards the mountains of the North.
Castiel, on the other hand, has Enochian and commands the word into being. It also uses a part of himself, an inherent connection to magic, which Castiel calls grace. Castiel appraises Dean and says that the hunter doesn't have the same relationship with magic, but Dean does connect with his soul. It explains why he's tired when he casts.
Its talons grasp both of his arms. With the size of the claw, Dean is sure it can break his arm, and crush his skull.
“You coming?” he asked him softly. Castiel gave him a small nod before he reached forward and planted a reassuring hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Mary shrugged. “I’ll be fine, Dean. Don’t worry about me. My place is here. Now go tell your brother to pack.” She turned back to her vanity and felt around the bottom. She returned to him with a folded stack of twenty-tinsel bills, enough to buy food and accommodation for a few days with some leftover for contingencies. “Here.” She deposited the pile into his hand.
it for it to be actually called final."
filtered through Baby's stereo.
In contrast, Castiel is a picture of understated elegance. Black wings, golden-skinned, ebony hair, and Angelus blue eyes. He is long-lived, and can maintain service in their long lifetime. Winged to perform duties in flight, even though he is fledged unlike the leathery membranes of the Eryiens. He’d filled out when he’d reached the five hundredth year of his nesting. Castiel has become the ideal specimen: tall and muscular. It’s enough for the demands of the household—and whatever other Michaela requests.
When Castiel stopped to look at Dean, his pupils were blown wide, and he was breathing hard, his hands clenched on the edge of the bed. “I think I’ll do whatever you want me to,” Dean answered.
“The time of reckoning
At that, Castiel grinned. There was the Gabriel that he was looking for. It didn’t surprise him that Gabriel knew what specialty bakery was in Castiel’s vicinity to feed his cravings. The situation may have forced Gabriel to act like an older brother from time to time, but he still had a four-year-old’s sweet tooth. “I’ll see what I can come up with.”
John narrows his eyes, his lips thinning before he blows out his breath. “The snows are getting heavier. It’ll be difficult to travel ‘round these parts.”
Lady Lucian, having finished her rounds, slips her arm through Castiel’s, standing on his right. “Well? We still have the party after,” she reminds them as she tugs them towards the Sanctuary where the Priestess stood before the Sanctuary.
Ash found Dean several days later (hours, weeks? Time was really fluid when you had forever, and you were running in a separate time vector from everybody else. Which begged the question: why had he ended up in Heaven just to get 'vectors'? It was a word he could have gone through life without). He was slumped over the bunker table, which was mostly covered by the Men of Letters' research.
“Don’t you
Michael barked out a laugh, surprising Castiel. The oldest archangel had always been austere to a fault. "You have found that I'm still where I'm supposed to be, brother. But my vessel runs amok in Shehaqim, and Heaven might have done something unexpected when he touched the Sacred Tree."
“Do you think you can hold a shield and run for home?” Dean asks as the Jhinka batter his shields, banging their weapons against the protective Green.
Dean walks around Chesterford, paying attention to the orphans and the youngsters. Theirs is a small town, but with enough farms and shops to warrant the protection of a barony, filled with all manner of children. The hunter focuses on the most vulnerable of their youth.
Jack’s eyes brighten at the suggestion, his wings flapping in the air in excitement, and he flies around Dean in circles. Dean laughs as he tries to get his bearings, trying to spot the sun. But the trees are tall, and Jack’s panicked run brought them deeper into the forest than Dean expected.
That earned him a glare. “Of course not! But if you… John, if it’s true. We’ve wasted all these years for nothing.”
"Vampires, leviathan, pagan gods are blessed with longevity. But Death… Death is truly immortal. He
Castiel grins. “Want to put your eggplant in my peach?”
"Why try looking for it when the Tree can bring your grace to you?" Gabriel asked, grinning as his eyes tracked the child stepped cautiously into Vilon's cosmos.
The roots were mostly covered by the falls, but that was several hundred feet below where they were standing. A mountain, which kind of reminded Dean of trekking in Purgatory, surrounded part of the main body. So the only trouble was getting from the exposed portion of the trunk up to the branches, but that in itself looked like a hell of a climb.
Gabriel snorted. "You think everything is inappropriate. Hasn't that Winchester you're in love with changed you enough yet?"
responsibility.”
So this was heavily inspired by him, and I asked him a lot of questions while writing this. I hope you guys liked it. I will confess now that it's over... that I am so not musically inclined. I had  to google a lot of Led Zeppelin references and listen to the songs and read the lyrics. I worked with someone who played the violin regularly for a couple of months, he was so musically inclined that he told me when he listens to music he hears notes. WHen I listen to music I hear words (or I listen really hard to the lyrics), I don't mind the notes, although yes, the beat and the rhythm matter, but they're secondary to the words.
Castiel blinks at the offer, not knowing how to respond. He assumed that the entire point of Dean going was because he didn’t want Castiel shopping for their groceries. “I thought the shelter-at-home was to implement social distancing. We can’t do that if there are more people at the store.”
Castiel stops momentarily at the shortened form of his name. He hasn’t allowed the Prince the liberty to use it. Prince Winchester drops formality easily, and it is not Castiel’s place to protest.
Castiel thought as he watched from the stage wings.
“To the wedding. But sure, we could visit the Ark sometime. I haven’t… ah, my brother saved me an extra seat, and I don’t have a date for it yet.”

“Lil’ after nine.”
Sighing, Hannah backs away and puts on clean robes. “Come out to the common room once you’re done, and I’ll find you something to eat. You must keep your strength up before Lucian visits.”
Castiel's experience had been unpleasant, but bearable. Like he had been constrained in the here and now and could not stretch his wings, like he had been breathing and moving through water instead of air. But Castiel had been a soldier in the lower ranks. The archangels were used to bleeding off grace, snapping realities into life was nothing to them. Castiel couldn't imagine how cut off Gabriel felt now.
. This is a list in Smith County alone. Is it someone like Pestilence with a new killer virus?"
"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was required to be polite to someone who shoots at..." Dean notes the break, certain that whatever words will follow is not Castiel's original choice of words, "...my companion."
Dean is right. Lucian holds a secondary ring because Castiel is just a loan. It is Michaela who owns him.
If Castiel had been prone to show his emotion easily, his eyebrows would have been raised in surprise. "I just settled everyone, Dean. Joshua and maybe a couple of dominions will probably push everyone around again."
. Dean completed polishing the chrome of the Impala in the middle of the song. He took the album to his room and recorded it as the twelfth song on the cassette.
And maybe that had been selfish of him.
"Kevin, I will say this only once, and I hope that I will never have to bring this up with you again," Castiel said in measured tones that leant gravity, "Dean Winchester was the Righteous Man, and I have dedicated my life to him. While others have faith in God, I have faith in
The massive attack is draining the Red Jewels gradually. When Dean checks on the reservoir of power, he calculates that he could hold out for more than a few days under the attack. The guards should find them by then.
It renewed Dean's struggles to try and force his hand free until the fallen angel released Dean's wrist. Dean stumbled back as he stared at the perfect set of puncture points on his skin and realizing belatedly that it had fucking hurt.
Hunters thrived and died in the plains, where they could scrounge up land and artifacts, and shuttle important people across to other settlements as well as guard produce, resources, and materials that could not be obtained through airplanes.
An impasse, then. “I guess I’d just have to tell my wife you didn’t want to taste the apple pie that she made.”
After watering, he’s engrossed in the task of weeding and moving the crowded seedlings apart. The fresh earthy scent escapes the soil as he works on it, reminiscent of the soft rains during spring.
. I recommend
Castiel evaded one of Gadreel's lunges before turning to answer Dean's call, as he'd always tried to answer Dean in the past. Arm bleeding with grace through the gashes that Gadreel's blade had given him, Castiel took flight.
Castiel shook his head slowly. The woman visibly calmed herself and sat back down on the wheelchair that Castiel hadn't noticed she arrived in. "Did you lose a baby too?" she asked after a time.

Castiel’s excitement was infectious, and Dean rapidly joined in with his enthusiasm over his finds.
Castiel squints at Dean’s head. “I could try for you, but only if you sign a contract stronger than a demon deal that you won’t get mad whatever the end results are.”
The cabin certainly felt spacious when occupied by two humans. Add a griffin to the mix, and the space rapidly shrunk down with the beast's wingspan alone. No wonder Castiel's door had been made wide, with a latch that is more lever rather than a usual knob, meant for nimble fingers.

Michaela rubs a thumb over the bridge of her nose to stem the headache that is descending. She vaguely remembered Katelyn.

A ship’s horn blaring brought his attention from the waters to the boat itself. NISC Twelve was smaller than
Joshua nodded his head in assent, and Nurse Morris turned back to lead them towards the mother. Castiel followed behind, watching as the nurse maneuvered efficiently around the corridors. She knocked at one of the rooms, where a slightly distraught mother was lying down, sitting with her husband and a man whom Castiel assumed was the doctor monitoring her.
He gives a startled yell as he tries to grasp for anything that he can clutch at, and a deadly calm washes over. In those few desperate moments, trying to reach for something to break his fall, Dean has accepted that he might die here, in his foolish quest.
"I get it already; there's no death here." She shrugged, her blond hair slipping from the ponytail that she had gathered it into when she had time to think about appearances. "No need to lecture me about it."
Castiel approaches Dean, a look of impatience on his face as he eyes the crimson hood. He strips the bed of its linen and covers Dean with it.
- cupids in charge of love are of the third class.
As an angel, they had all passed by the first circle of Heaven whenever flying around Earth, because access to the first heaven allowed them to fly great distances at humanly unimaginable speeds. Had Castiel still been with grace, being in the first heaven would have been a whorl of light and song, because angels without vessels existed in the abstract.

The ringing in Castiel’s ears has become a loud clang that beats in time with his head, heralding a headache of massive proportions. “I think you yanked on mine.” It was unheard of. If the inner barriers of the mind are intact, it shouldn't be easy to steal power. “Let’s test it.”

Dean was bleeding and sore, in a place he hadn't expected to be bleeding and sore, staring at Metatron agape, because the only reason Metatron was winning was either through cheating or lying and obviously he had done both. So Dean ignored Metatron because apparently, he couldn't get
Mary’s lips tightened. “I
Shifting forward, Dean looked at Castiel almost shyly and skimmed his palm down Castiel’s arm until he slowly let go of his fingertips. Castiel followed Dean’s movement with his eyes until their hands parted, then he caught Dean’s wrist. Though hesitant, Castiel’s smile painted the world with color. Castiel  interlocked their fingers and tugged Dean along the trail.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Was there some other reason?” Castiel asks, detouring to the faucet Dean had installed near the edge of the garden to wash his hands. Now clean, he brushes his fingertips over Dean’s forehead, still clear of the virus, before he opens the can of beer. He revels in the fizz that trickles down his throat when he takes a gulp.

Right, Castiel has known crew to personify their boats, but apparently, any vehicle will do. “You fix a lot of flat tires?” Castiel asked as he watched them, feeling useless as the brothers worked efficiently together once they got the hang of what was needed.
A sip jolted Dean’s system awake. He needed more caffeine for this, preferably the entire pot. “What
“Is Mikulmas even a word?” Dean had never heard of a Mikulmas, ever. Dean got a pointed return stare from Castiel, so he straightened and dropped back towards the couch beside the angel. “Mikulmas might explain the baking, but it doesn’t explain Black Beauty and Tornado over there.”

heaven was like.
“I’m helping you cry, Dad,” Dean whispered back.
“Yes, sir,” Sam said with an elbow digging into Dean’s side.
While flying had been sorely missed, the concept of doing something 'just for the heck of it' had never been part of Castiel's outlook on life, so trying out his wings for more than reaching places wasn't part of the plan.
Gabriel and Raphael had decided before visiting that they were not going to be talking about the archangel reincarnations nor the entire Pillar of the Earth business. Until Michael and Lucifer both tasted death, which currently seemed impossible inside the Cage, Raphael and Gabriel were content not to start another round of Apocalyptic prophecies.
“Hey, man,” Dean said.
“I got some nougat cereal,” Jack enthuses, swirling his spoon through the last spoonfuls of his milk.
“Guess that’s one way to take care of that, huh.” Dean jerked the blanket away and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s forehead. His face was still flushed, with his ears turning an adorable pink.
On the contrary, Castiel was doubtful of his abilities. He’s had his whole course plotted for him the moment he was born, and his mother and Michael have taken advantage of that repeatedly. But Michael would only see that as a weakness.
Castiel shook his head before cutting the call. He tapped his lip thoughtfully, Michael wouldn’t be able to find him immediately, but a little misdirection wouldn’t hurt. He pressed his watch again to open a browser and projected the hologram into an empty space. Pulling up his frequently used airline, he booked a one-way ticket to Egypt, business class, using the family digital wallet. Let Michael find that.
“Nothing, it’s stupid. When will we be back in the city?” Cas handles the travel so it’s not surprising that Dean has no clue about where they are.
“No, I’m sorry.”
The Omega turned to look Dean in his eyes. His bright, green eyes, green as the leaves in summer. “I can’t stay, Dean.”
Dean smiled widely, joy filling his heart. “Do you know what we’re going to do when you’re free, my beloved?” he said, happily. “I’m going to make so much food for you. There’s so much to taste - I haven’t even given you honey, yet. You’re going to love it. And I’m going to take you so many places, Cas. You’ll pick a direction and we’ll just go, see what places we find. I’ll show you the warmth of a hot mountain spring, the joy of a field in summer, the salty breeze by the shore of the Great Sea, the cheer in a frozen lake. I’ll share it all with you,” he said, grinning mischievously. “And I’ll find out all the different ways I can please you,” he said, rutting his knot inside his beloved.
And then he realized something. Something that made him feel ashamed for presuming so much. Something that pained him to his very core.
“I wasn’t making fun of you. I promise. I know enough about you to know that you are sincere. I’ve just become too jaded. In my experience, people always have ulterior motives when they say emotional or flattering things.”
“Jimmy!” Castiel scolded.
When he’s done flailing and is awake enough to recognize that everything is fine, he yelps, “What was that?”
That rebellious, adventurous side of him that he’s kept locked away for so many years is tearing down his walls with frantic claws. It’s screaming that Dean mustn’t live so lightly anymore. He can’t float through his years on the current of anyone else’s will but his own. It tells him to be an active participant. ‘Stand up. Take what you want.’
Dean’s eyes go wide. “Bite? Why would I bite you?”
“Keep it, Castiel,” Dean said, unable to speak above a whisper. His gaze dropped to the floor as he shoved Castiel’s hands back towards the Omega. “I made it for
“And this new plant is on land?”
He takes Dean over to the oldest piece he has ever seen, opening the long metal drawer where it is housed. “This is part of a manuscript that was written by the ancient Celts somewhere around 800 A.D.”
“You’re insatiable,” Cas complains without conviction as he settles in next to Dean after blowing out the candle.
“Put him right back to work,” Alastair continued, panting for air as blood poured out of him. “Heat didn’t even hitch. He didn’t make much noise after that whole fiasco. Didn’t cry again. Only said the words we told him to say. Like a good bitch. You should have heard the noises he made while I -”
Oh no.
“So are you going to tell me your name? Or yet another riddle?”
Dean gasped, unconsciously leaning back at the sudden nearness, Castiel’s scent now filling his nose, his body heat pressing against his bare chest. The wolf could only stare into his eyes, spellbound, as his heartbeat and breath quickened.
"Then why look like this," he said, gesturing at him, "like a handsome Omega?"
Surrounded by jungle sounds, in his spouse’s warm arms, and already feeling so weak, it wasn’t long before Castiel fell still, unconscious from lack of blood.
“Trust me on this one. Go brush your teeth and get dressed. I’ll order some breakfast.”
opinion of his situation and what he can do with it. <3
Dean laughed. “Don’t worry. It will,” he said, taking his cock in his hand and guiding it to Castiel’s dripping hole, setting the head against his wet, hot entrance. “Tell me if you need me to stop,” he said, straining to keep himself from fucking Castiel senseless right now.
Dean is learning. This world is an entirely new existence for him. He’s never washed, cleaned, or cooked for himself. The callouses on his fingers from playing guitar are not anything like the ones he has now. Of course, he still has the callouses on his fingers because Cas brought his guitar and his notebook.
The Naga’s blood froze within him as he pulled him to shore, immediately doing all he could to revive him.
Do nothing but watch.
too early.
Sam shushes him which earns him a face-melting glare. He lets it go because he is just as angry as Cas. When they get outside, Cas yanks on his hair with both hands and lets out an infernal scream with his lips closed. If he let out the anguish he was truly feeling, he’d be locked up right alongside Dean for causing a public disturbance.
Knowing that Cas will leave him soon, leave all of their world behind, is devastating. It’s going to kill him to let Cas go. Of course Dean is insatiable. He can’t waste his opportunities to be close to this precious man.
“My dearest fans and citizens of this great country, it pains me to bring you this terrible news so soon after the triumph of this evening’s performance. In the in-person crowd tonight, someone chose to ignore our Laws of Public Action and make their own interests more important than the interests of the public. It’s shocking, in this day, that people still feel the need to ignore the laws that were created solely for their protection.”
Raised eyebrows are Dean’s only reaction. “Oh, we’re not going to talk about that, either?” Sam teases.
Looking out over the view behind them, he sees the rest of the gardens they are shooting in. It is manicured and beautiful; a mix of greenery and flowering plants that never would have grown in the same place outside of his home.
And he started to glow.
Male, 22, White, Green Eyes
Cas swallowed. “White, with freckles if you can,” he said, doing his best not to let his voice crack.
Sam snorts and flings a pillow over toward his brother. “I liked you so much better before Cas taught you sarcasm.”
Judging by the blood that had by now stopped pooling around his mate’s waist, Cas knew that not only had the strange Alpha knotted his Omega, he’d torn him.
Without warning, Cas thrust his hips and shoved Dean’s head down to take his cock, forcing him to adopt his rhythm. He was so warm and wet, and his low whines rumbled against him. He was so fucking tight.
His Dean was in heat. Early.
“Dean?” he sleepily asked. “Could you please hold me?”
“No,” Castiel said, holding his wolf close again, listening to his heart. The heart that wasn’t going to last much longer. Not like this.
And, now that he was covered in such delightful-smelling oils, having just got done touching and pleasing his precious little ma- spouse… he couldn’t bear it any longer.
Cas nods. “Yes, they definitely contributed. It was much more complex issue than textbooks make it out to be, though.”
And that was all it took.
Dean ran a few fingers through his love’s hair, damp with a cold sweat, before he looked down at Castiel’s neck.
“Wow. That makeup job is fantastic. I can hardly see you under there.” His tone is dreamy and a little awestruck.
“No!” he shouted. “Cas isn’t evil! You can’t do this!” he said, trying to shake free of Rowena’s hold on him.
was a lot easier than I thought it would be,” Megara said with a smirk as she reloaded her crossbow.
“No, no, please!” he begged.
Evil.
Dean’s face goes wide with concern. “You mean to tell them?”
It was too late.
“Dean! You’re alive?!” Naomi is the first one to notice him in the doorway, but at her shrieking, the entire room full of people turns.
Quickly, Dean lit the torch on the wall, searching for the source of his love’s scent.
Now, he just has to get into Dean’s cell and release him. He’s dressed in the same uniform as the other workers here, thanks to a young man named James, who will be missing his uniform and work id card when he returns. Surreptitiously, he makes his way down the hall, listening for every sound that might signal another person entering. Luckily, he is alone tonight.
Before he knew what was happening, the Omega had crawled on Dean’s lap, straddling him and nuzzling his cheek.
Finally, he sighed. “I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember, bound to the cycles of the moon. And, what I am fated to do… I love. Few things give me joy as what my duty, my fate has given me. And, beyond that joy, I was allowed pure freedom one night a cycle. It was everything I dreamed of, hoped for. I wanted to do it forever,” he said, biting his lip. “Then I met you.”
“Uh…Is Cas working tonight?”
“Dean, it’s alright, it’s alright,” Cas soothed, continuing to stroke his beloved’s cheek, rubbing his hand with his thumb.
Cas can never deny Dean anything, so of course he complies and sinks down slowly onto Dean’s cock. Dean’s hands grip his hips convulsively, a high sound of agony and bliss are pulled from his throat.
“No…” the creature whimpered.
Castiel took a long breath. “You were someone who didn’t see me as something to be feared or as someone strange,“ he continued. “You… you treated me as an equal. In your eyes, I was something precious, and not because of my powers or anything I could do for you. You showed me unconditional love, expecting nothing in return. And I-” he took a breath, “I didn’t know how to handle it. You showed me a world I’d seen countless times before and made it miraculous. You made fish - fish! - into something wondrous, something I could keep discovering. You, you’re so unlike anyone I’ve ever met,” he said, unconsciously playing with the amulet around his neck. “And what once felt like a joy is now a curse without you.”
“Well, think what you will, it doesn’t make it true,” Dean grinned. “Anyway, my father was a warrior, a defender of our pack. And my little brother, he…” Dean drifted off. “He wasn’t anything yet. But I was in charge of him, keeping him safe and out of trouble,” he said, letting out a long breath at the memory.
“About the arm? Nothing,” he said, gently pulling Castiel’s hands away. “But that’s alright. I’m here to help you.”
Castiel could do little but nod.
God, he loved getting to care for him.
Here's Meg's crossbow! Megara has to use a crossbow because she isn’t physically intimidating. Besides, she likes it. She worked hard on making and carving that thing, leave her alone.
“You look so damned sexy in this outfit, Dean. The colors are perfect for you. Earth tones that make your eyes shine like jewels. The tight fit of the sarong accentuates your tight, perky ass, and that coat is the softest material I’ve ever felt. When I put it on you, it was torture to not run my hands all over you to feel the contrast of your thick muscles under that softness.”
“You aren’t?” Dean said, upset at the thought.
“Cas, did you hear me?”
And, god, the noises suddenly got fucking
“I-I think so,” Jimmy said, fumbling with his pockets before pulling out a flint box.
His movement is enough to catch Eileen’s attention, even if his words, directed at the screen, are not. He walks to the screen, mesmerized.
Dean left for the lake, several days earlier than he usually did. He was slower on three legs than four, so it would take much longer to get there, and he didn’t want to be late. Not after he missed last month.
“Yes, you are.” In a bold move, Dean teases back. “You’d better be worth it.”
Dean didn’t touch the money from Castiel. He divided his earnings into thirds: one-third was set aside for a place of their own, another third saved to pay Sam’s school fees, and the remainder was used to cover necessities.
Sam pulled back to look at Dean in shock. “Excuse me?”
Castiel reaches for Dean’s cheek and turns it, so they were facing each other.  “I’d rather have you than stay with them.”
The first time Dean remembers making a mixtape, he was seven, and he just got back from school. Sammy getting a fever had worried him the whole day but Dad told Dean that he should still go to school.
in ascending hierarchies:
"Not really," Metatron said, as he landed right in front of them. Castiel dropped his sword into his hand, eyeing Metatron. "Good try, though."
While cleaning Dean’s body, Castiel holds Dean’s hands and reaches with his mind. He finds the inner barriers, the shields that protect the Blood from psychic attacks, intact. Dean is not vulnerable to the world. Even his first barrier, which protected everyday thoughts, is solid. His inner barrier, the core of his self and inner web should be unharmed as well.
"Yeah, I get that, but what about the circles, and all the levels of Heaven crap? It was exhausting," Dean groused.
“Dad, I have the new design for the prototype engine. It’d make the energy source more efficient and have little to no exhaust,” Dean explained, as he motioned to the blueprints he’d rolled and brought over.
hadn't interfered.
are you even here? Locked Gates and all that?"
When he claimed a small patch of the bunker for his own needs, he’d planted flowers. He has two kinds for each season: hyacinth and wild lilac for spring, cosmos and foxglove for summer, zinnias and asters for fall, and the sunflowers to bring cheerfulness just because. They’re for the bees, so they’d have a place for nectar and visit. So Castiel could watch them dance.
*I gotcha, Cas,* Dean responds in the spear thread, his hand clenched around his own Jewel. *We’ll take your boy and go. No kneeling necessary.*
Once deep enough, he draws out the reserve power of his Red, dissolving the outer shield and leaving them with the Green. On his ascent, he prepares to unleash the spell when suddenly the webs are
Everything has been perfect lately. But Castiel knew, deep in his heart of hearts, that last night had been a goodbye. Palo Alto was less than a day’s drive away. They had passed through every single attraction that appealed, and Dean already worried about the state of their finances. Their time had come to a close.
Just before they merged onto the main street, they saw a flash of dark hair that seemed familiar to Dean.
In case my HTML isn't working again.
The mess hall was empty, save for the few people who were awake. Dean assumed some of them had finished their watch and were about to go to sleep after a snack. It’s what he did when he worked during the middle watch, the time between midnight and 0400.
Dean groans. Not only is he going out of his mind with boredom, but also because he is required to return to the barony.
went back on, but Castiel's mind was distracted enough not to pay attention to this particular murder. Unfortunately for them, though Leilah showed them Gabriel, talking to him was another matter entirely.
Manny unclasped his watch and entrusted it to the proprietor who took a magnifying glass and tilted the watch this way and that.
Castiel approached to peruse the books. They were old titles, and most had release dates over five years ago. Someone on the ship was an avid reader, and the creased spines showed it. He pulled random volumes from the shelf to leaf through them. Almost all the text was in English, but there was a smattering of foreign ones, including what looked like a Bible, in a language Castiel couldn’t identify.
With only the low light of his watch, Dean was resplendent. His eyes were trained on Castiel, his neck and cheeks flushed. Dean was a mess of soft pants and muttered utter nonsense.
"Sufficiently vague while telling me to mind my own business. I like it." Lucifer waved a hand, and the key to Aravoth glowed under Dean's shirt. Enough of Lucifer's power could leak out of the Cage in the second heaven to influence objects. Dean could feel more of Lucifer's power here than when they had last talked. Hopefully, that tendril was the most of it. "Ahh, isn't it funny that I have 666 seals and Aravoth has just one?"
"Really, referencing angelic rom-coms to me?" Dean scoffed holding out his hand, and Lucifer flicked his finger, the string flying out of the Cage and into Dean's waiting hand with the gesture.
That weird, queasy feeling was back when he watched Sam and Manny. Dean was almost left out despite being with them. They weren’t ignoring him—no, in fact, they told
However, Castiel may know healing potions, but he doesn't show finesse when examining his patient. It does give Dean time to look at his recuperating joint. The hunter has watched the ghastly purpling black bruises fade into a sickly greenish-yellow until only the faintest sallow mar the skin.
“To the Darkness, so that the Light shines brighter,” Castiel toasts before he takes a gulp and throws holly leaves into the fire.
“I hope you’re prepared to starve to death then!” Sam shouts back.
"One of many," Lucifer confirmed smile playing on his lips. "Tore it out of Seth and Maggie. It's rather red-string of fate-ish now that I've held it."
“Welcome to the Wayward Sisters!” the lead singer, a woman with colorful tattoos all the way from wrist to elbow, blared into the mic. The crowd cheered enthusiastically. “For y’all who’s new here’s Donna at bass, Claire at the drums, and Alex at the keyboards!”
Disregarding the lie of his Jewel rank, Dean calls in his Red ring and braids his more durable Red shields over the Birthright Green. The Jhinka are unlikely to tell, and Jack is too inexperienced to sense the power. While the Green could probably withstand the Jhinka, Dean wouldn’t take chances with Jack’s life.
“Where’s your very own snuggle pillow then?” Prince Winchester also has a terrible habit of renaming everything.
Dean already got that somewhere down the road, or in fewer dictionary terms from Cas, in any case. What was new was the annotation written over after reading the translations Ash sent over that said: root
be killed because death and dying is his purview." Gabriel looked up from his work, and Castiel nodded. Essentially, there will always be Death as long as something is dying in this plane. "Then there are the Pillars of the World: where this reality is anchored, for which without them creation would unravel.
Dean cursed the bumpy roads around Sioux Falls, and for the hundredth time, thanked Sam for navigating. They arrived in South Dakota before it was fully dark, but the sun was already nearing nadir, ready to set.
“Um, well, I was doing the witchlight like you were showing me,” Jack says slowly, his eyes distant, trying to recreate the moment. “And I really wanted to power it, but I couldn’t get any.”
In the morning, Dean cursed at the tape and chucked it in the bin after he rewound it to listen to what he had done. The entire tape was just a recopy of the first Led Zeppelin album after
“I was taking the steam bus.” Castiel thought he was soaking Dean’s shirt with both snot and tears, but Dean wouldn’t let him escape the circle of his arms
It was Castiel’s first time to swallow a cock.
it. The Tree could bring him to higher or lower circles, but leaving the third circle meant that he'd be stripped of his wings again.
Gabriel staggers for a few steps, groaning and covering his nose in the aftermath, glaring at Dean. Dean, on the other hand, rubs his shoulder while looking at Gabriel threateningly. A curl of golden hair flops over to cover Gabriel's eye to ruin the entire look.
Sam met them the next morning, looking haggard with dark circles under his eyes. The cold spots and noises in the wall had bothered him all night, he’d complained.
Gabriel snorts and Dean suspects that if Naomi didn't have such firm control of her emotions, she would have wailed. She does let out a suspiciously strangled moan. Charles, who was drinking from a goblet of wine that Mary served, trying to ignore the proceedings, says absentmindedly, "Castiel means he prefers men to women."
Some freedom this had turned out to be.
Kevin furrowed his brow; he probably couldn't think of a reason to visit a cemetery when they were hunting for souls and angels who could pinpoint whereabouts of those with said souls. "Do you want company?"
Castiel trailed his finger over an Enochian Dictionary, missing the feel of paper. Movement on Bobby’s porch distracted him from investigating further, though.
Dean had protested about
: “You, celestial being, have been created to be an angel of the Lord.”
"You know, I wouldn't have wasted my time cleaning and bandaging your wounds just to kill you off."
Castiel shook his head and folded his hands together. "I'll watch over all of you. Rest, Dean, tomorrow is going to be a long day."
"Eldritch Abomination?" Kevin offered up.
“You have to sign a waiver saying that your purchase will leave the state of Ohio in the next forty-eight hours and that you won’t fire them in state. Failure to do so would book you a misdemeanor of the first degree,” Cole said.
Castiel started to doubt his decision in mentioning the CDC. Panic was something that was never good to introduce to small towns, and epidemics caused anarchy just as fast as any natural disaster. "Ma'am, we are doing preliminary investigations on the perinatal mortality rate. We have no indicator saying that we have an epidemic at our hands."
Remembering the Fall was not something that would give them additional information with regard to what they were looking for. And Castiel did not stand for being stonewalled. "Bottom-line it, Nathaniel. If you do not care that humanity is dying, you do not need to expend your time and effort beyond this one audience with us. I need information regarding the Treasury of Souls. How do we open a channel for humans to be born with souls again?"
"By dying? No, I don't think so. I can probably move my timeline along for most of the angels to be dead at some point but—"
Gabriel took the vial in his hands, shook it to watch its light blue glow, and told Castiel that he was impressed that the angel still had that much inside of him despite being made human and growing his own soul in the process. Gabriel's eyes lifted to Cas. "You're going to try to get a fix on your grace, aren't you?"
A pit opens inside Dean’s stomach. Sam was giving him an expression that was a cross between sad-puppy-eyes and annoying-little-brother. Dean dubbed it as his constipated look; it would morph to his let’s-talk-about-it look once they were alone.
"That's why there were feathers in Silver Ash with like… burns and stuff. You were fighting
“So? I’m gay too. I could be your wife-on-the-side,” she said, waving his concerns off as she hooked her arm in his. She lead him away from his secret voyeur’s landing towards the deck itself, chuckling. “To the galley, husband-to-be, I want you to prove your baking skills before we wed.”
Dean emerged from the showers a few minutes later refreshed, clear-headed, and hungry. It actually spoke about his state of mind, because hunger and Heaven weren't things that went hand in hand. It was a subtle reminder to him that he needed time off from brooding.
make this road trip with the least amount of trouble for Dean and Sam. It didn’t hurt that he was easy on the eyes, either.
Castiel has grown red over the exchange, his fingers pinched over his nose. "We exhibit sexual dimorphism in the Eyrie. Female griffins are wingless but larger than males, presumably to protect the nest. Therefore, females are called lionesses, males are eagles and are winged. Raphael has treaties on it written somewhere if you want to peruse it."
Manny smiled slightly with an apology in his eyes. “Thank you, but no. Someone has to keep all of our things together.”
The evening was mild, though colder than the temperatures they were used to in Stava. Dean stood at the edge of the veranda, his book open on the wooden railing. When Castiel saw it was his gift, he stepped lightly over the rough boards, smiling that Dean treasured it enough to use.
I wanted to write a Soulmate AU fic, and had that plotted out already was writing it...but um... it felt too depressing to be gifted, so I scrapped that and changed it in the middle.
Dean glanced at him and said, “Maybe.”
, its reflectors catching the midday sun.
It also prompted Kevin to look for an alternate life for himself. With the aid of Charlie's "creative hacking," Kevin finished college a little late with a major in Religious Studies. Castiel had followed Kevin at college by getting into Theology. Sam had been supportive but mainly laughed the entire time, especially when Kevin finally hooked up with the girl that would end up being his wife.
Balthazar chuckles at the exchange while Jack grumbles and settles on the tree trunk with another layer of warming spell from Hannah. “Run along, Cassie. Be back before supper, we’ll fix the kindling before then.”
"But…" Castiel trailed off, lost at the sudden realization that his quest had come to an anticlimactic end. He had managed the fetal deaths as much as he was able and had found out what Dean needed for a prophecy. "How do I fix what I have done wrong?"
"Well,
When Castiel finishes, he stands in front of Dean. He pulls the white sheet they used to protect Dean from the clippings with a flourish. Dean is slow to blink open, and Castiel cups his face, dragging his fingers carefully against the scrape of his day-old beard.

Dean brought his attention back to Manny, only to see those blue eyes focused on him.

“My stomach feels heavy.” Jack turns his own laptop around, so it faces Castiel. “Bing says it’s early stages of Coronavirus, and I’m going to
"Don't you have a damned map somewhere?"
He groaned when Castiel reached behind him and gripped Dean’s hair tightly. Dean got the hint and rubbed Castiel through the boxer shorts that he hadn’t shucked off the night before.
, and continued on to
, and the general mess that was the research room.
Castiel shakes his head. What was there to say? That they’ve been having on-again-off-again sex since Purgatory? That they’ve been emotionally exclusive for a while that but only inadvertently fell into exclusively fucking each other since the second time they returned? It just didn’t seem important.
When their stops were few and far between, the brothers began bickering more. It showed familiarity and fondness that Castiel had only ever found with Gabriel. But, they’d been on the road for several hours now, and yet the drive had been unusually empty of the brother’s usual banter. The music was blaring unnaturally loud—or louder than Dean typically set it, anyway.
"And this is my beloved—"
which means 'fall' and another postscript written after that: 'those that cause others to fall'.
“It’s a tradition among us Angelus that we save the first natal down of our children and mingle it with the feathers of our own.”
Truthfully, Castiel is content with the way things are. He’s never been human, never felt the need to label things the way humans do. It’s enough that he’s with Dean now and he’s allowed to take what he wants. Dean shakes his head and pulls him towards the bed.
Jack shuffles and alights in front of Castiel. His wings are splayed open, trying to hide the larger Angelus. “We brought Prince Winchester home, Lady.”
- governed by the Caretaker of the Throne, believed to be lost or a myth by most. It is attended by all archangels.
"Is this what you meant by 'it's in the middle of a mountain, and no one sane would trek this far?'" Castiel couldn't believe the sheer magnitude of the angels that had arrived.
After he presented the pie and let the galley staff appreciate his use of their overripe bananas, Castiel found himself being entertained by various of the crew as he explored the ship further.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, an archangel's feather probably had the same amount of power as a seraph's grace. Power seemed to grow exponentially from one circle to the next in Heaven's hierarchy so it would have to do. "What do you want?"
“Um,” Cas paused. “Isn’t there an on-switch and it just… cooks?”
Dean had offered him a ride and company through his long trip, that should be enough. Castiel had already noticed that the man flirted with anything that moved; he shouldn’t hope for more than passing fancy.
Motioning for Castiel, Dean looked pointedly at the seat beside the pools. Used by attendants of the person bathing, Dean had never asked Castiel to attend him before now. “Stop whatever you’re doing if it’s not too important. Sit down. You’ve earned a break from taking care of me.”
Dean is exhausted and in the restorative sleep to regain his Jewel strength. Lady Michaela flicks her hands in dismissal for Prince Winchester to go to the Healers then focuses on her nephew.
Kevin looked uncomfortable, so Castiel took back his chopsticks to resume his meal and give the prophet a little respite. Now if he could just convince Sam of this as well.
He hadn’t realized he’d adopted Cas as part of their family until Bobby said those words.
Led Zeppelin Songs recorded in Dean's Mixtape so far:
Castiel looked at the numbers and became saddened. He had not seen such a large-scale death toll since the plagues of Egypt when he and his brothers had been called upon to slaughter all firstborn children. No wonder the nurse had called him incompetent. "Let us talk to the people nearest here, Kevin."
WHITEFISH, MONTANA 2012
Dean pats the horse and turns to look, holding his gaze through the distance. "If I don't succeed in this, my father will pull me from this hunt. He already thinks all of this is dangerous. I
"Your fucking face isn't very nice, but I don't call you out on it," Dean said, gun still trained on the angel even though he knew it was useless. "Wanna tell me what the fuck Charis was?"
"Are we watching something?" Cas asked, curious about the setup, but allowed the rearrangement of his person.
Taking pity on Dean, Castiel leans down and licks around his fingers still inside Dean. It causes Dean to release a high-pitched wail, rocking against Castiel’s hand insistently, pushing against both his fingers and tongue.
“I am not rolling out another pie dough,” Dean complained, rotating his shoulder and glaring daggers at Castiel who was giving him an annoyed huff. “Why couldn’t you have just snapped those all to existence, huh?”
Gabriel stood up with a frown, but they said their goodbyes, and Castiel snapped his fingers, closing the call on his watch. To make himself feel better about the lie, Castiel does precisely what he said he’d do.
Dean wanted to throttle the angel. Yep, Metatron was still an annoying little douchebag of an angel. Not even all of that research that Dean read had changed his opinion, elevated from the secretarial ranks his ass. Metatron had probably been a suck up douche.
This was put here cuz my alpha reader thought some people might get lost with the entire circles, hierarchy and names of Heaven, so we did what fantasy novels usually do... Add a glossary  and stripped a lot of the names when in narration, but the angels obviously would call it their proper name (Shehaqim) instead of 3rd Heaven.
“We’ll be hiding for the rest of our lives,” she said instead. It wasn’t a no. There was hope.
“Do you think they’ll invest in more soundproofing if we tell them they’re loud?”
I didn't realize the hover span of the text failed after a while, through differing programming in AO3 I guess. Before it worked using the span tags, I've changed it to abbr tags from now on. It should work now.
Dean threw a couple of kernels of popcorn at Sam's face inside the flat screen when he clenched the ring he'd kept inside his pocket for six frigging months, the coward. Dean seriously did not raise a brother who couldn't propose worth jack shit.
"Uh, if you're not human, what are you?" Dean asks.
There was a creation story somewhere, buried in all of the stories that were ever told. Sometimes, a soul chose its parents before it was born; sometimes it was written that God chose for them. In all of Creation, the soul was made by God, nurtured by the Tree of Life and then dropped down into the Treasury of Souls where they would wait until needed. An angel then took each soul that came into his hands and bestowed it to a child that was waiting to be born.
"Sounds like a hoot," Dean mutters under his breath.
But Dean knows why his mom is this way. She’d woven a tangled web this morning; since then she seemed elsewhere, forgetting where she’d placed the butter, the milk, or the watering can.
you moved them.) Castiel dusts, puts away books, and washes dishes.
Ash spoke up before it could get more confusing, "He means that the Cage is in Hell, but it's also in Purgatory, Earth, and more importantly—"
It had taken Castiel the better part of the entire day, getting the interview with the COC and talking to the various medical personnel, but one thing was irrefutable: there was indeed a high perinatal mortality rate in the wards. It was an unprecedented mortality rate, higher than even the times when there had been no antibiotics, no hospitals, and midwives had no concept washing hands before delivery.
"I had always thought that your death would be insignificant; that I could visit you and it would almost be as it was in life, because I am an angel, and we cross dimensions and time. If I missed you, I could see you here, and if I wanted a moment, I could cheat even that and steal back to 2009 and just relive that until I was called back home. But then there was the Fall, and the Gates locked down. I am
Souls take their human shape in the Pit because it is all they have known. Castiel was grace made light. Castiel could still intervene and had the upper hand. In an instant, Castiel was between the rack and the blade. There was a broad smile in this human's eyes, slightly mad, slightly anguished even though he was the one holding the knife. "Hail and be glad, o favored one," Castiel whispered, recognizing the soul, if not his form. "At long last, God's messenger has reached you. Salvation is at hand."
As they played, a soft and sweet chorus, almost impossible to describe, came from them. What had once been a flatland was suddenly surrounded by rivers filled with, upon closer inspection, milk, and honey.
“Wake up, Dean,” Sam said with a laugh.
The huge open-deck exhibit had a wall to wall holo feature. It showed the constellations and the 110 astronomical objects cataloged thus far by man. The jewel at its center: an elevated plaza mounted with several different telescopes. Dean tried to remember everything that he could, comparing it to what he recalled from Castiel’s gift.
That done, he dragged Cas to the bed before setting up Sam's laptop with a trusty heatsink and speakers then clicked Netflix. Cas observed this all in amusement before Dean hip-checked the angel to get to the bed and crossed his feet at the ankles, Cas beside him.
Gabriel winced as he eyed the restless mass of angels in front of him. "Really, Cas, bringing up that you're my standard-bearer now? You haven't even held that silly dragonhead flag in three millennia. Not even after some dick taught the Romans some of our military tactics and had
“I’m not an archangel. I can’t snap things into existence, even in Heaven,” Cas explained patiently. “And you’ve never eaten either recipe before, so you couldn’t have ‘snapped’ them.”
Bobby frowned as he read over the lines. "Dean said that Lucifer attacked, so he got squat, but Dean got the impression that both of those dickbags knew who this was, or at least had an idea."
“Are you alright?”
"I was fifteen when I died. That's barely half a life lived. Not even half by most people's standards. I want to live, love, create something. I want to write my own story, and barring that, then maybe I want to forget even for a little while that there's more than
his siblings. He had no doubt Gabriel was correct in his assessment. It’s why he’s in a car rather than an airship. That and Dean. But he preferred not to examine his poor life choices too closely.
"I hope that's enough, boy, 'cause I don't think I can do that again," Bobby said as he set the full syringe on the low table beside Castiel.
happened. It felt like the cold ashes of failure in front of Metatron's ridiculous hilarity over the attempt.
“Thank you.” Castiel paid using a hundred-dollar bill to break up his cash from the bank. He needed to get some smaller bills, or the shopkeepers would be suspicious—big bills were unusual in small towns.
Dean pries a bit of the ring off, which elicits an agonizing moan from Castiel before it clamps down to the clay. Concentrating, Dean tries to think of a spot he knows well in Terreille where he could send the ring to without suspicion and settles on the pools that Castiel bathed him in. Dean vanishes the halves over the water and sighs in relief when it’s gone.

“This circle is the record button, son, you press it together with the play button so you can make a copy of the song playing on the other tape to this one.” Dad pressed play on the left with white noise from the beginning of the cassette playing.
—A Guardian and the ruler and caretaker of the Dark Realm. Maintains order in Hell separating the dead from the living Realms. Grants demon-dead their final death if requested. (see Guardian)
Dean groans in response, and Castiel follows it by trailing kisses all over his chest. He licks one pebbled nipple and strokes downward until he reaches Dean’s balls and gives it a gentle squeeze.
A teaser of the art by
Why couldn't he just deal with the less evil of brothers? Did he have to deal with bordering on insane Lucifer?
Dean's eyes widen. "Benny?" The newcomer scowls but grunts confirmation. "You look…dewier."
Castiel found Dean on the yard, raking leaves, whistling a forgotten tune. The clean scent of the freshly mown grass reached Castiel in the street. Castiel hadn’t been prepared for meeting Dean like this. Especially not when Luke was the one who brought him here. His stomach was a mass of butterflies as he started to worry about what he was going to say.
Bobby raised the bill of his cap to consider him. “You leavin’ that boy?”
"You're just about to tell me you'll return to your mountain."
“This is the name and location of the head of the Hunter’s Guild.” The Steward pauses before squinting at John and continuing, “Unless you want to bring this up with the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan.”
Castiel looked up at his brother. “You produced it.”
“When has that
The angels calling it 3rd Heaven all the time kinda feels like I'm saying that third street the entire time instead of calling the street by it's name commonwealth avenue! you know?
Bobby stumbled upon it. It wasn't like people actually could drive by asking Bobby and Dean to fix their cars. Dean suspected, but would never be able to prove, that Bobby had just dreamed up the car to take Dean's mind off the current problem.
Castiel could always rely on Gabriel to focus on important things. He took a sip from his glass, knowing that he was stalling. What else could Castiel say other than he was coming? It’s not like Gabriel would understand the oppressive walls of the Novak residence. He’d left before he was utterly trapped in their lifestyle.
Balthazar waited for them at the entrance of the Shrine Auditorium. The outside was finished in horse-shoe arches topped with Moorish domes. Despite the plain exterior, the inside was a marvel. Even Gabriel’s attire looked somber compared to its full-length windows. Its artisans had stained it with scimitars and had them extravagantly colored.
Dean tries to remember what his mom mumbles, but some words are too hard. His dad would know. They’ll help his mom, and she wouldn’t fret about it anymore. Decided on a course of action, Dean falls asleep with a smile on his face.
Dean went the opposite direction that Ash moved around because Dean wasn't really into graph theory. On closer inspection, there were points of blue light that dotted the outside of the circle, where the netting from the horizontal net began. A small flicker of bending light flashed in front of the webbing that spanned across the Cage, reminiscent of the ghosts that Dean used to hunt.
Requiescant in pace. R. Amen
The good thing about it being in Heaven was the room was already trying to mend itself when the fire was put out. Cas turned around slowly before sheepishly putting down the large soup pot he’d used to douse the flames. Dean just raised an eyebrow. “When you said you wanted to use the kitchen I assumed that you knew what you were doing.”
There was a beat of silence. "The souls in the Tree of Life aren't being delivered because there has been a dearth of messengers on your side of the gate."
. They might have been aiding a bank robber for all he knew. Imagine a bank robber hitchhiking his way to California. It was kinda hilarious.
He resumed dressing and selected brass cufflinks to go with the buttons of his overcoat. Choosing to ignore the gold-and-diamond encrusted chain jewelry that his brother Michael sent up a while ago, he fiddled with his sleeves. The ornaments Michael gave him glittered with the lights, but it was too vulgar.
So life was changed, but still the same for angels who watched and did not interfere.
It seemed only Sam was a little nervous about leaving Stava
, where he was Chinese-Filipino. I went with that in this series. And it’s true, one in every 5 seamen are Filipino.
“Why’d you promise Dean to a Novak, John?”
The pregnancies that were failing had nothing in common. They spanned all ages, all social types, bridged across cities, states, and continents. These women had not shared even religion and faith; there was nothing to go on except that these babies most often ended up dead when they were born.
The Prince is not used to luxuries and savors the soft mattress and the down bed. He is surprised when Castiel tucks lavender and lemon balm into the linen after a warming spell for his comfort. There is an innocence to him. Maybe it’s because Castiel is more than 700 years his senior or because Castiel is a pleasure slave but Castiel wishes that the Prince’s time in Michaela’s court would not tarnish it.
"Then please, Castiel seeks assistance in a matter regarding the
While Dean sets a timed spell on the candles, Castiel kneels down to address Jack. “Darling, we’re leaving Lucian. I’m taking you with me. Do you agree?”
"Four or five summers that year," Mary confirms.
"Oddbody," Castiel replied. "Has there anything out of the ordinary of note lately?"
He tugged out the string from his pocket and put it in the bowl, followed by a dollop of red blood. Dean rubbed a thumb over his wrist before he pulled out the shining snow globe that was Lucifer's feather slash grace.
“And you, Sam? What do you enjoy?” Sam heard the tentative curiosity in Manny’s voice, which made Sam consider him in a new light. He was working on getting to know Sam, not just his brother. He should give Manny a chance, after all.
"I am sorry for your loss," Castiel offered as he stood up, Kevin following close behind. Castiel brought out a calling card made for such cases and folded it into her hands. "If you have anything to tell us, please don't hesitate to call."
Each of the guards is busy handing out weapons and organizing the Blood males into defenses. They are for the shields and possible attacking forces.
It can be skipped to the next chapter if you're uncomfortable without much loss of the story. If you're reading in a web browser, just click the
There was a stretch of silence as both Castiel and Sam watched Kevin storm out of the common room, no doubt to sequester himself in the room that he'd claimed for himself.
“Get me some white bread, and none of your healthy crap.” Dean orders while Sam retrieves vegetables for a sandwich. “And a side of egg-oil-juice.”
“Uh, breakfast is, uh, ready,” he stammered, then slammed the door before his footsteps lead down the hallway.
“Gabriel…”
John focused on Dean again. “Mary was your grandfather’s jewel, and he gave her away. I couldn’t let her live in our dilapidated house, surviving on tinned food. It’s why I went to the Stavan officials as soon as I knew we had good engines.” The government had been impressed with the efficiency of the engines, the speed of its production. “It’s time for you to make your own worth. I think marriage to Castiel Novak would accomplish that.”
He had a flashback to Gehenna when he saw the building’s unusual architecture. It had steam pipes leading to generators on the roof, like the models that Dean used to repair back home.
Gadreel landed in front of Metatron, a few seconds after Castiel. Though Dean had managed the spell to help the angels to heal, the wings of Metatron's lieutenant had still been damaged in the Fall, while Charis had kept Castiel's pristine. Castiel addressed the hunter, his eyes not leaving the other angels. "Dean, what can I do for you?"
Castiel rubbed the smooth leather before opening it carefully. Its pages were brittle, but not yellowing. It was a star chart, and the next few pictures were of celestial bodies taken from a telescope.
All the infighting grounds to a halt. Mary bites her lip in amusement. Sam looks like he is one guffaw short of rolling on the floor with laughter.
Dean froze. Coming to the Cage had been the plan, but he thought Michael would have understood once he'd explained his dilemma. "Uh, invite the angels back in?"
It did mean that in the middle of the night, with Cas gone and Sam asleep, Dean paced around the bunker, jittery and filled with worry for the angel. Cas, who had only been a celestial wavelength of intent, who had no practical experience for human things, and who had no marketable skills except wielding an angel blade.
“I suspect it certainly puts the world’s troubles into perspective,” Castiel nodded.
Dean would remember this moment for the rest of his life. He inhaled sharply, the cold in the air pinching at his lungs. Castiel turned towards Dean at the sound,
Castiel frowned at what Dean wasn’t telling him, but he let it be. He left Dean only after assuring himself that the man wouldn’t keel over in a dead faint and accidentally kill himself in the bathroom, and sought a late lunch.
"Humans and your complicated, complicated ways. Enochian spellcasting, unlike your human mages, need not follow a regimented formula. You build circles to contain it, and ingredients to entice it and focus your belief while giving it words to cajole it to being, but that's external magic. You have magic within
Metatron didn't seem to have a response to that, so he attacked instead. "What did Sam say when you let 'Ezekiel' in to fix him up? I may be selfish, but I'm not cruel. I don't force people who're ready to die to live in spite of themselves."
Castiel’s eyes flicker towards Dean. *If you help me with this, I will kneel for you.*
Well, no more. Dean needed to hear his concerns.
a pinch! You a blood-sucker now?"
The crew set up the library with two shelves and a long table that doubled as a conference room of sorts. There was a large map of the world dotted with pins, presumably places where they had docked before. The cabinets were made of aluminum and had a low bar at each shelf as well as glass panels in the front, designed to keep the contents in when they hit turbulent waters.
Dean has a far-away look of someone monitoring the threads, but he shakes his head and smiles at Castiel when he notices the attention.
"Cassie, I do not appreciate the sudden reversal you're throwing at me! I was all game to forget about your grace when I was asking you to think about
He's even managed to get all the archangels attention on him at some point."
The creature makes a slight huff followed by a chirp; then it butts its head against Dean's uninjured shoulder which earns Dean's smile.
Sam, as it turned out, needed to leave the next day. Driving all the way from Lawrence to Lebanon had not really been in his plans, but Kevin had worried about Castiel, so Sam had come to help him.
“Do I get to keep you this time?” Castiel asks, his breath ghosting against Dean’s neck before he drifts to trace a collarbone with his lips.
"No, Sam. You've been keeping the children from me. No fair. So I will take these offerings you've clearly laid out. Tata!"
The night was cloudless, and there was little to no steam to hamper the view. He wanted to pull out the astronomy book and match its pages with the evening sky.

The farm was on an extensive plot of land surrounded by a wooden fence. In the distance, they could see a white house with stained glass windows of bees in traditional hives. Someone had carefully mown the front yard and planted lavender in regimented flower beds. A sign close to the road read  ‘Keep Off the Grass.’ The stone walkway had another that said to be careful of bees.
She pushes them out with an explosion of power from her Sapphire, then locks the door and drops her head on one of the upended tables.
, but the moment that Gabriel stopped putting the glass slipper on for the girl had him breaking the fourth wall and staring intently back out at them. "Goddamn it Leilah, I thought we agreed that I was better off lost. Are you out of your freaking crazy noggin? Why do you have to ruin my sweet deal of witness protection, huh?" Gabriel's TV date looked appalled at his words and more appalled at the shoebox.
"You ass. It's Dean."
Dean let Manny’s hand drop, ignoring the heat that slowly leeched off.
Looking for his grace wasn't something that was feasible while Castiel was mortal and alive. He couldn't navigate all of Heaven with the false set of wings the third circle had bestowed him. While the angel wanted the burn of his grace and the feel of his three pairs of wings, he couldn't see how he could go through all seven heavens and their endless possibilities without losing his sense of self.
Catching himself, Dean felt like such a girl. So his attraction had become a little crush. But whatever, right? Nothing would happen. After this trip, they were both going their separate ways.
Dean wakes by the frost in the air during the autumn after his Birthright Ceremony. He shivers, recognizing it instinctively as a Warlord Prince’s killing edge, knowing that a Prince has drawn battle lines inside the house.
Once the song was finished, he rewound the tape and then picked up his mix from the shoebox, winding that to a proper point and recorded
"Magic is a feeling deep in your soul." When Cas talks like this, it is easy to see that though he is somber in most things, he is passionate about magic. Cas loves teaching, the enthusiasm when he imparts the knowledge is only damped by Dean's lack of interest in learning beyond the basics. "But magic is also an unruly friend. You can request, in which case it could misinterpret you, and you end up with this mess, or you could command, and it will respect you."
Castiel leaves with a kitten lick at the base of Dean’s cock, a trail of saliva connecting them as they part before he reaches around to the side drawer. Dean is already wrecked, his chest red, his lips swollen, and his hair disheveled from his own fingers.
Castiel forgot that he’d penned a short note of thanks signed with his real name in the book. “You could have just
Dean grinned. “‘Cuz you were hot, and you looked so lost, standing in the middle of the street. Why’d you accept?”
"Maybe I should just say the pigs ate them," Castiel said as he stared out the window. Due to the urbanization, people sometimes forgot that pigs eat babies if they were left unattended in farms.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sometimes, friendship had its pitfalls.
Gabriel completely ignored the question, in the way that people dismissed the unimportant. "His grace has been burnt clean in the fires of Rigyon. It shouldn't have remembered you, but it did. We—all of us—in our times of need, we cling to those that are most important to us.
"You mean Joshua?" There was confusion again. And that certainly didn't bode well for information.
Lord Ezekiel and Prince Samandiriel, two of the Blood males who train with Dean, relieve Castiel of his burden. Raphael grimaces at Castiel, he has the unsavory task of punishing a slave that ignored a call to arms. Especially one who, as a Sapphire and a Warlord Prince, is one of the darkest Jewels in the eyrie.
It provoked another round of cheers, this time some people even actively tried to tip their heads in Castiel’s direction.
Dean kept crossing and uncrossing his arms, trying not to attract the bees’ attention. He heard them buzz around him. They were
Slowly, Castiel remade Dean Winchester as they ascended, from bone to sinew to breath, not flinching even as Dean struggled. Dean had tried to gouge out the angel's light, lashing out to try to stay in the Pit. Souls always tried to go where they were familiar because it was a comfort to them. This soul remembers only the Pit, and it was trying to return. So Castiel tried to soothe him with Michael's song, not noticing the human's futile attempts to slash at his grace, as Hell became lighter and lighter.
“I was expecting someone like you. Now, which bitch was yours?”
“Yes, thank you.” Dean looks like he could fall asleep standing.
Dean’s heart swelled at Castiel’s fascination with everything he’d done, delighted that Dean himself had made it, despite the crudeness of the whole thing, asking how he had done it and listening to his every word, completely enraptured.
It was hell.
“Then let’s get to it!” She said, marching out the door while the cat perched on her shoulder, giving Dean a death glare.
Dean’s mind raced trying to think of what might be wrong, what poison this could be. He immediately reached down to feel his mate’s bare torso, just above his pelvis, giving it a push. “Does this hurt?”
“So…” Dean said, looking down at the slightly scruffy looking wings in front of him. “What do I do?”
“C-Cas…” Dean said, voice broken.
The only personal items that he has on him are his lock picks and an emergency energy packet to get him home if something should go wrong. He’d left all identification at home.
“The prettiest you got, male, twenties.”
“Yes, I’m Dean.”
“What are you doing over here, Castiel?” Uriel’s deep voice comes from entirely too close to his ear. Cas jumps at the sound, too distracted by Dean to realize that his employer was just about cuddling him.
Dean moaned, propped up on one arm so that he leaned over his beloved, each pump of come sending a shudder through him. He stayed panting there for a moment, before looking down at his beloved, lying there, bonelessly limp.
“Yes.”
“No, no, you’ve done enough, you need your rest.”
“Love this, Cas. It feels like…”
“Yeah,” he calls back into the fray. He can’t see who is yelling for him, so he continues picking up drinks from the service bar and placing them stably on the tray. When he sees who it is, his temper flares. This particular hostess has been on his nerves since she started. She is young and beautiful, and that seems to be the entire resume of her skills. She doesn’t do one iota more work than she has been explicitly asked to, leaving even more work for the overwhelmed servers.
“No, you’re hurt,” Dean said, only tightening his grip.
Dean trusts Cas. He obviously has done this before and he looks like he has the expertise to handle the machinery involved. This is a huge step for him, though. He’s been told since he was a small child that the environment outside the dome is deadly. It’s impossible to get over that innate fear all at once. He just hopes that his legs don’t refuse to take him through the doorway.
“A vague answer.”
Dean held him close, lifting his chin so he could softly lick up his tears, before leaning down where, one day, he hoped his mating mark would be.
Dean knit his brow. “How would I get a feather from the Moon god?”
“I loved you, Speckled Wolf,” he said, before stepping back into the lake.
“Don’t worry, my love, I’ll take care of you,” he said, softly, licking the slick from his fingers, before undoing the latch on his pants. With a groan, he pulled out his cock, hard and leaking.
Alastair. Owner of the richest, most luxurious, most debauched brothel in the state. Everyone knew it. He had the prettiest Omegas - called them his Angels. Also made a point to have Omegas that hadn’t even presented yet. Called them Cherubs. As debase and as horrifying a kink you could have, the Angels would be made to deliver.
“I’m saying that your Omega is very, very pretty. He wasn’t sold to a breeder.”
That was the next thing he knew, a darkness, a pain in his throat, a numbness in his leg and arm. A warmth, a weight. It was so… nice.
“Leave him alone!” Dean cried out from behind them, beginning to weep. “Just please, leave him alone, please…”
He contents himself with the fact that he isn’t missing much. His workouts are strenuous and designed to keep him in perfect physical condition. His diet is regimented down to every calorie and nutrient. That antiquated expression that your body is a temple is the perfect slogan for Dean Winchester.
“Where is everyone else?” Dean asked as he cut up fresh vegetables.
And he was beautiful.
It was some time later. It felt like eternity. Dean couldn’t even see straight anymore - everything was pain, a pain that kept growing in intensity, a mounting need. A need to push. But he was losing strength. His wings and body were shaking with the strain as he used what grace he could to help position the next fledgling - little Ben.
It takes three more surreptitious trips over to Dean’s table before he finally gets the entire story. He has pissed off the hostess, Jaime, and Uriel in the process, but it’s worth it to him. He’d do anything to help Dean, and to be honest, he hates this job. Perhaps he’ll be lucky enough to draw a better assignment for his next job if they fire him. He can’t just quit because it is not allowed. But, if he is fired; that’s an entirely different issue. Now that the idea has been broached, he can’t quite fit it back in the box.
“I’m sorry,” he said, out of breath.
“Partially, huh?”
He was so beautiful. Dean almost never got to see him like this, asleep. He looked so content, so peaceful.
“Sure, Cas.”
That’s what he’d said last time.
*****
“Your arm’s back.”
“Yes, sweetheart,” Cas chuckles. “It’s a tight fit, but it will work. My body wants you so much, Dean. I will welcome you in.”
Author's Note:
With a mischievous grin, Dean agrees, “True, but if I get used to it and accidentally slip in public?” He whistles long and low.
Perfect Condition
And while the backscratchers did help, it didn’t solve the matter. Because Angels weren’t supposed to go through their molt alone - it was supposed to be a bonding activity, when the angels would sit in a circle and help massage the wings and clean them out. An Angel couldn’t comfortably make it through a molt alone - they can’t reach so many parts of their own wings.
Putting a hand on Dean’s arm, he apologizes. “That wasn’t fair. I’ve had a hard day, but I shouldn’t let my frustrations interfere with our conversation.
Cas carved into his belly, deep and slow.
So why did something feel off?
He pulled his brother from the strengthening river, heart pounding in his chest from the constant running. He felt like his heart was going to burst, he didn’t know how he was even going on anymore.
“Mr. Trenton. It is wonderful to see you again.” She gestures for him to have a seat at the bar in front of her.
“Nothing.”

Then the god turned to look at him.
“Yes, outside.”
“Yet you remain kind.”
He is being watched by every person within Kanpeki Basho, but young men and women are the target audience. Dean Winchester is the epitome of glamour and fame, the pinnacle of beauty. It is cliché to say, but they all want to either be him or breed with him.
Or else they’ll die.

“Who you are,” Dean repeated. “Who are you, Castiel?” he said, scenting the little Omega in his arms.
"Because we need you."
Then blackness.
Cas and Dean spend two days with them in total, much longer than anyone anticipated because no previous visits with the monks have lasted longer than an hour or two. They stay without Dean’s typical entourage because if there isn’t an opportunity to be photographed, there is no reason for either Crowley or Naomi to be present. Cas shakes his head when Dean tells him as much after they are invited to stay for their evening meal.
who instigated the fornication, is it not?”
“Here it is, Mr. Trenton. Your usual.”
“Unexpected?”
And he was gone.
This evening, Eileen brought over a new kind of digital enhancer, and they are about to run the video through that. Cas’s heart is heavy, but he’s trying to stay hopeful. He’s seen this footage hundreds of times. A man that looks just like Dean is smoking something out of a glass pipe. He staggers to his feet, clothes in disarray, and falls onto someone. The other person shoves him, and then the supposed Dean turns and leaps onto him, fists swinging. When the other man goes slack, he drags him by the arm across the ground and then rolls him into a swimming pool.
“You can wait until you have a chance to cool down,” Crowley suggests.
The Omega slowly looked around, taking inventory of himself. He still wasn’t fully lucid as the drugs still hadn’t entirely left his system; something made evident by how he moved, how he sounded. But when he caught sight of Cas, something lit up in his cold, dead eyes, and he froze.
“I can’t sleep, my molt is driving me crazy. Will you help me?” He blurted out before he could finish talking himself out of it.
“If it’s better than this, it might kill me.” Dean’s heaving breath makes Cas feel powerful in a way he never has before. Dean is the most responsive man he’s ever been with, but it’s more than that. Dean makes him feel so much, so deeply.
“Are you even a
The only sour note of the entire night was his inability to answer several of Castiel’s questions honestly. He’d always been good at improvisation, though, so he had created a drastically different version of his life to deliver. He made mistakes, and Cas probably didn’t believe everything that he said, but he was gracious enough not to call him out on the fumbles.
The wolf tried to remember, tried to recall what his beloved Castiel was supposed to be like. What holding him was like, what that made him feel, how it made his heart ache.
“He’s not a druid.”
“What do you think the punishment would be if our sponsors found out that we were in relationships?” Sam asks lightly, though the question goes deep down to the bone.
There was - there was an intense feeling in his chest, unbearable, sharp, a ripping, a tearing. Breathing only made it worse.
Cas removes the last of the binding, and realizes that he doesn’t have what he needs to remove the extensions from where they are sewn into Dean’s natural hair. “I know. I’ve learned all about the different castes. I know how little you are allowed to know about the world.”
Cas decides that the easiest way to explain himself to Dean is to bring him to his treasure room, so that’s where they are going now that Dean looks like a regular Shokunin worker rather than a movie monster.
Cas swallowed as the tightness in his throat ached, as his heart cracked in his chest. “I need you to stay awake, Dean. Listen to my voice. Can you hear it? Please,” he said, bowing his head as his mate’s cloudy gaze locked on something miles away. “You remember when you caught, Dean? You smelled like heaven, sweeter than I ever thought. And in those months when I saw you there, swollen with my fledglings, face beaming like the sun, you were… you were the most beautiful…”
Sam runs a hand over his scruff while he thinks. “It’s safe?”
Dean’s anger boils up at the gall of this man. “You are going to do what you promised. I will not take no for an answer.”
“Never.”
As soon as the doors shut behind him, he broke down in tears, falling to his knees.
“Who is?” she said, confusion etched in her face.
Just then, a low rumble caused ripples on the lake.
“I’ll wait,” Cas said, swallowing.
“Jimmy!” shouted as his twin was ripped away from him. He jumped, reaching for his hand.
That’s what this was all about.
Cas shakes his head. “Only you can go from full seduction to goofy jokes and not lose an ounce of appeal.”
“The…” Dean rubs his eyes and then shakes his head. “How is it boiling?”
His wolf’s voice. It was crying through the Doorway.
Was everything they’d shared nothing more than a lie?
It was all that was left of him in this world.
“What’s wrong, then?” Castiel asked, looking up at him with big, blue eyes.
‘Stop it,’ he chastises himself. He can’t let those heinous thoughts enter his head. They will find something to prove Dean’s innocence. They have to.
“Castiel!” he shouted, out of breath but filled with joy. “Castiel!”
“Nirvana. This must be close to what that feels like.”
The little creature could only whimper and shake, the pain was so great.
“What? No.” The man grips his package tighter and tries to move around Dean.
Outside the gates, there lay in wait a small mercenary group Cas and Sam’d bought for the night, led by Anna. They were to come in later.
“What?” Dean asked, blood draining from his face.
They’d just been dealing with a trio of brothers terrorizing a couple of farms. This was supposed to be easy. This was supposed to be a milk run.
“It’s Claire, Dean,” Castiel whispered to his shaking mate, wet with sweat, hand gripping his own so hard it hurt. “It’s our little daughter.”
The knot didn’t last long, so once he went down enough, he pulled Dean off of him. As he did so, the Omega stole one last lick at his slit, sending a shiver through the Alpha. Dean grinned mischievously.
“Did the enchantments work?” Megara said, trodding up to the other druids encircling the now helpless god.
“I came here to talk to him, actually,” Dean smiles.
“I’m listening.”
“There was a city here?”
The figure, the demon, looked up towards the sounds, eyes narrowing.
Rowena cocked her eyebrow. “It was
The very thought left his soul broken inside, empty and numb. Food lost its taste, day lost its light, life lost its joy. He did what he had to do for the pack - hunt, patrol, anything they needed - but it took so much energy. Everything became so mechanical. His future, once so bright and happy, became naught but a void of emptiness and loneliness. There was nothing left to hope for.
At first, the ex-Angel glared at him, angry at him for disbelieving this horrible pain in his belly and insulted at his simplistic diagnosis. However, as soon as the scent of some of those savory pastries, even cold, Castiel froze.
That’s why he was here, in a fancy suit and a fancy car, driving up to the gates. They had a valet and everything.
*****
Soaked through.
“Nothing. Not important. Are you ready for your match tonight?”
“My, uh,” he said, halting. “My pack and family were… they were killed.”
If there was a fire pit, there must be a flue.
“That is actually a ridiculous understatement,” Dean teases as he yawns and runs a hand over his already spiky bedhead.
“Can I help you get out of your suit?”
“Oh, Cas,” Dean said, fingers stilling within him, staring at the trembling Omega below him, flushed and shining with sweat. “You came on just my fingers,” he said, staring in awe at his love, who’d come all over himself.
Dean’s heart ached looking at him, but he didn’t know why.
Castiel fell into his lover’s chest.
Only to find it had been cut off beneath the shoulder.
At Castiel’s gentle nod, Dean rushed out, grabbing the pot and setting it on the table before scooping out a bit with a spoon, blowing on it to cool it off. Only when he felt it wasn’t going to burn Castiel’s tongue did he bring it over to the Omega, who was feebly undoing the tight wrap of furs around him. Dean gingerly slid one arm below Castiel’s head, propping him up so he could eat without choking. “Here, drink this. It’s broth. It’ll warm you up.”
Before Dean even knew what he was doing, he was up on his feet, arm wrapped around his precious little love, nuzzling into his beautiful, mussy hair. He smelled even better than he remembered.
“Enough for four of us?”
Oh, he was so light.
He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to fall to the ground and never again rise.
The wolf reached for another quiver of arrows, as his first had run dry, reloading the bow and taking several more shots.
“Come on Dean, push. Just one more push. I promise.”
“I have no idea. I’ve never attempted anything like this. I don’t have a clue of what it entails.”
“Of course not. And I am sure you’ll find a pack to take you in. You are good and gentle, and when you love, you love deeply.”
“You will,” Cas comforted.
“Does your wolf form have speckles, too?”
“Alright, I’m gonna get a bacon cheeseburger, what’ca want?”
That was Eric. Lucifer recognized his voice. He tried to growl only for it to fail into a lost breath. A horn honking made him realized he was in a car. Was he blindfolded? Maybe, he could hear them but couldn't see. Trying to move something tugged at his wrists.
“No, did you?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Nervously Castiel watched the muscles tense in Dean’s back. Looking away he thought about saying he was sorry, retreating to bed but when he looked up, he almost jumped seeing Dean looking at him through the mirror, “Sorry-”
Grabbing the door, he tried yanking on it only to find it locked. He had to get inside the house now and nothing was going to stop him. Looking around feeling stressed at being so close Jimmy spotted a potted plant. Grabbing it he ignored Sam’s yell to stop and threw it into the window.
Dean looked up frowning in confusion as he stood their hands looking over a book that was open and frowned when Cass leaned over the table like he was in pain. Heading over he paused.
“Rough case?”
“Cass,” Dean said gulping looking at him and then back at the other. “Did it escape your attention that Lucifer is right there?”
“Yep, ooh, he’s watching a cooking show,”
Waking up slowly Castiel felt warm.
“He’s gonna be pissed.”
“What?!”
“So, then I died, and when I got up to heaven, Dean, Jack, and I went to get Cass from the empty. It took a bit but when he was about to get him back it tossed him into this world, so Jack opened a rift here so we could get him but looks like we were off target.”
“Oh, about that Michael,” Lucifer smiled awkwardly holding up his left hand to show the wedding band. “I kind of got married.”
“Yeah, uh,” Dean glanced over at Jimmy frowning. “What are you doing back here, Cas? And how did you beat me back?”
Looking up Castiel saw that he was holding out his phone. Reaching over slowly he took it scrolling through them. Going to the search bar Cas looked for the ones that he used to have.
Gulping down he nodded. “Alright, so now what?”
“Probably up in my office. He likes coming, food and drinking but always takes off before the speeches.” Chuckling he patted their shoulders. “I’ll be back I’m going to go check on him and bring him something to drink.”
Standing behind by the back door Castiel held a knife in his hand looking around knowing that he hadn’t seen something his mind made up. Nerves flared he looked around trying to see if he could spot where they went.
Nervous looking, Castiel looked at Dean before turning to head inside.
“Bastard!” Lucifer yelled and jerked back when Pines got closer. He hadn’t seen the man since he was a teenager, which didn’t mean he forgot the hell he went through. “St-stay away from me!”
“I want to help too,” Jack said causing them both to look at him. “Please? I mean, didn’t Adam help?”
“I should get paid for this,” Adam complained as he was handed more books and files to carry. Walking behind his brother he rolled his eyes. “Come on, Sam, don’t you get like an unpaid intern while getting your Ph.D.? You handle cases and assist them too. Surely there’s gotta be someone like that right?”
“Like a housewarming?” Castiel asked nodding. “I can make the food,”
Staring at him Dean paused. “Seriously?”
“Oh really?”
“Well, it’s a gamble, you can’t really tell how high an item is going to go or if it will sell. It all depends on who shows up or calls to buy,” Picking up his phone Dean scrolled pulling up the dates. “Hey, look at that, there’s one tomorrow. Want me to forward you the information and you can check it out.”
“Where are we going?”
Watching him leave Jack turned around to look at Sam. “Do you have any cookie cereal?”
“Oh, cinnamon rolls?”
“I hate it too,” Pulling Jimmy to him Sam took in his mates’ scent while trying to comfort them both. “I just wish I could talk to Dean for a minute,”
“Well, a good honest Alpha.” Nodding he put the note away in the glove compartment. “Whoever he marries will be damn lucky.”
“Hey, Steve,”
Courts, drama, Lucifer throwing a fit like always, not to mention the fighting that he and Michael had in the damn courtroom while Gabriel yelled at them to stop before taking off. Jimmy and Castiel both trying to separate the brothers and Balthazar was trying to process having to give up his life again for someone else.
“Lucifer. I need to talk to you now.” Michael glanced at the other Alpha. “Alone.”
Sitting in a car a house down Carl took a long drag of his cigarette. “Nah, looking at them right now, Dan. Looks like your little bitch ran right to your neighbor’s house.”
Jimmy had gotten them dates, hounding him until he said yes. After an hour of shopping for clothes had the other had been happy with their new wardrobe? Running up their Dad’s card, while guilting their parents.
“Hey, Cas,”
Pulling into the store he saw Castiel standing there with his basket. Smiling he pulled up to him and got out to open the truck. Grabbing the bags, he put them in while sneaking a peek at the food.
“What? Are you okay?!”
That voice he did not like. Despite the calmness of his tone, the man across from him held concern for Castiel. Looking over, the man was balding. Had over thirty years of experience in his field, was Respected, loved, had a wife, children, grandchild. All in all, he was a well-adjusted normal human with a kind family.
“Yeah, well that’s not going to change if you stay out here,” Reaching down he hauled the other up by his elbow. “This all your stuff?”
“I… Uh, can you come get me and I’ll tell you?” Clearing his throat Jimmy rubbed his face. “I’ll drop my location,”
“Nice to meet you too, Jack. Well, we have a booth, so you can meet my brother Adam.” Smiling he held Jimmy’s hand as they walked over to where Adam had gotten his appetizer, swearing he couldn’t wait because he was starving, and was downing an onion ring. “Adam, this is Jack, Jimmy’s Nephew,”
Being angry at the angel had lasted long enough until they had been fused again. Maybe the other angels didn’t know or didn’t care, but he could feel the back of the singed wings tremble at the base of Castiel’s back.
Sure, his twin wasn't as talkative as he was, which was fine, Jimmy loved to talk. They'd singing annoying songs in the car or even just grab extra food before class. He missed Cass a lot.
“Ugh,” He took a swallow. “You drugged me.”
Another Omega in heat? IN less than four days?! Great! But it wasn’t that strong. Maybe Cas had small heats. Taking him up to one of the guest rooms he laid the omega on the bed covering him. Castiel rolled over curling into the sheets.
Castiel whimpered as tears fell from his burning eyes.
“This feels strange,” Dean whispers.
“Hmm?” Cas said, not opening his eyes.
“Not sure,” Cas said, rock in his gut. He only prayed that Dean was in the first category.
“Castiel!” Dean shouted as he came up to look around for any sight of them. Nothing.
“Like what?” he asks when he slips up to tip and licks teasingly around the head.
__________________________
“Yes. It’s you. We just met the other day, but I recognize your voice, Cas.”
“So, tell me.” Dean’s eyes are lidded, heavy and flirty. Cas can’t resist him. He’s tired of trying.
The world grew hazy, distant, dark. Sounds dimmed, light faded around him.
“You’re lying,” Castiel said, fear icing his veins. “Tell me the truth, Dean.”
But oh, god, Dean wasn’t going to last much longer.
“I truly am impressed, Cas. I thought we’d be sleeping on the ground. I didn’t expect such luxury.”
Dean spent hours looking through Cas’s massive art history tome that he had smuggled in from the outside world. He was as amazed that the book came from somewhere other than their secure country as he was by the pictures of the paintings themselves. To think, there was an entire planet on the other side of the clear dome that hardly anyone thought about, much less wanted to explore. But Cas did. Cas wanted to live out there.
He didn’t know what it was, but something just didn’t feel right. Was it the weather? The air? Something he’d eaten?
“No! No, you have this all wrong!” he said, getting desperate. “He - he was able to pass over enchanted dust! I checked!”
The Omega’s bright blue eyes turned to him, even more vivid in the dawning light. For a moment, there was a hint of sorrow in them. “I am alone. I must always be alone. That is how these things are.”
Maybe days, maybe centuries. He had no way of knowing anymore. His soul was caught in some sort of purgatory, a dark void, alone, with no one to love, no one to care for.
Finally, the object at its epicenter rose from the water, its beaming brightness so intense it almost burned to look at.
The fire glowed warm.
He finished and paid the hefty fee in cash, and was instructed to sit and wait.
“Of course,” Dean says looking down. “I can’t ask for you to put yourself in danger like that.”
“If you get it - and that’s a big fuckin’ ‘If’ - you’ll need to get the owner’s name. Worthy blood only works if you invoke the Worthy one’s name. I suppose to keep demons from using it, but that didn’t really work well, so whatever. Just be sure to get the Worthy mortal’s name - which won’t be easy, as they fear you’ll use it for dark magic. So you’ll have to convince them you’re honest. Good luck with that.”
“No, sleeping beauty. There are predators out here.”
“You are truly alone, then?” Dean asked, concerned.
Cas’s fork tumbles to the plate as Dean chokes on the bite of bacon he hadn’t yet started chewing when Sam dropped that bomb. Smug Sam is going to get payback, but not until after Dean can breathe again.
And, at last, it came to a head.
“Why, Cas? Are you-” Dean said, heart gripped with fear.
“Did we…?” Dean said, surprised at how much it hurt to speak.
Dean’s heart froze in terror. “Cas, what’s happening?”
“So there
“R…r…” Castiel tried to say, tried to warn his love with the last of his strength, but he couldn’t speak. His body had stopped shaking, it didn’t even have strength enough for that, but his lips, his tongue failed him.
Cas stood to his feet as a key card was placed in his hands, the attendant smiling from ear to ear.
“Shh. And I probably said something like they were assholes, a blight, a curse or something. It doesn’t matter, they won’t bother us anymore.”
“Don’t worry about us,” Bart adds. “We’ll always be here. How often is an opportunity like that going to pop up in your life?”
If Dean had looked at him in an over-friendly way before, it was nothing compared the lustful gaze on his face now. Cas swallows hard and steps away.
“Meg, leave him alone, we already paid you.”
“No, no, it…” Castiel said, sighing. “It’s not like that. It’s complicated.”
“Dean,” Castiel pled, terror icing his heart.
“But you… you’re mortal, I-” Before he could finish, Castiel drew his mate in for a tight embrace. The Omega felt so warm. So alive.
“I can’t feel my toes.”
The rest of the evening is spent trying to call in favors to get them in front of a judge.
“If I can get Dean out, would you consider coming with us to live outside the dome?” This question is bold. He doesn’t even know if Dean will agree to this, and there’s no way to ask him until he can break him out of prison.
“Oh, that’s perfect,” Cas praises. “Do it again.”
It was wonderful.
Did Castiel not want to see him anymore?
___________
“Don’t worry, little ones,” he whispered into their ears, resting his head against their dirty, matted hair. “I’ll keep you safe.”
“Well, I think this suits you better,” Dean said with a grin.
“He still does,” Cas agrees, flushing a little admitting that knowledge in front of a Jinushi woman. Instead of looking affronted, she smiles and gives him a little wink.
“Dean?” he called out at the den mouth. The dark den mouth. “Dean?” he called out as he walked inside, only to find it littered with leaves, the torch unlit, the air stale.
“Dean, have you figured out how men have sex together?”
They came in the night.
But oh, god.
He half wish it hadn’t ended.
It might take months, maybe even years, to get all these, but he would. No matter what it took, he’d find a way to gather them all. Fortunately, the spell itself, the mixing and the performing of it, was a basic cast - a technique he’d learned from his mother years ago.
There was a needle in his arm - more drugs, to keep him dependant, to keep him pliable, to keep him quiet. He shook in terror at whatever horror was in store for him.
Cas grins his mischief. “No, because I also booked a few other destinations and paid off people to use the rooms and confirm we were there. No one will ruin this trip for us.”
…Wait.
Sam bites his lip, worrying it between his teeth.
“Don’t you worry, Dean,” he whispered to himself. “Whatever these creatures are, I’ve killed millions like them. Don’t you worry for me,” he said, eyes glued on the red sun. “Just hold on, Dean. Hold on.”
“It’ll be okay, Dean,” Cas said, soothingly. His chest ached seeing Dean like this. “We’ll get through this. If you want to terminate the pregnancy, we’ll schedule a time. If you want to keep them, we’ll -”
When the other two men stare at him like they aren’t following, Sam rolls his eyes and leans closer. “I’m confused because I thought it might be because he makes you moan like a whore and shout his name in the middle of the night.”
“Well, fortunately for you, handsome, the rest of the ingredients are only
Whose legs were now a long, scaled,
“Oh, god, Dean…” Cas said, breaking down in tears and holding the Omega close to him. He was so cold. He was so thin.
Dean shook his head. “It was a long time ago,” he said, averting his gaze.
“I know, Dean,” Castiel said, something in his chest aching where it never had before. “But I cannot return any sooner.”
“More. Need more.”
Castiel giggled as he devoured the meat hungrily. Dean couldn’t help but watch him; his every movement was so graceful, so beautiful.
“No! Don’t get caught because of me!”
“They’ll send me a notice to come into the office and get a new post in a few days.” Cas shrugs with indifference.
The ground and trees were covered in crows. Hundreds of crows, all staring at him, all cawing.
“We’re going to get you dressed on the edge of the pool by the chaise lounge you’ll be laying on because there is no way you’ll be able to walk in the tail.”
He looked over at his trembling brother, knowing that soon they’d have to resubmerge back into the water to hide their scent. And he didn’t know if they’d be able to survive that. Not again.
“Cas!” he shouted, covering his eyes with his arm and running as fast as he could towards the lake - where his beloved always came from. He needed to warn him, needed to stop him, he-
“Yours.”
“Even if I have to get you implanted with eggs, I don’t care. I’m gonna breed you raw.”
Dean looks down at his feet. The Laws of Public Action are often criticized in hushed tones, but never outright. It wouldn’t do to challenge the very words of the founders of this unique country. Rationally, Dean knows that the laws are there to provide safety for all citizens, but it doesn’t make him any happier that someone was killed at his concert tonight.
“Cas, I-” Dean said between gritted teeth, “Cas, I think they’re coming.”
Once Cas gets a good rhythm going, Dean kisses him, holding his head to him and running grabby fingers through his hair. It only takes a minute for them both to get wet at the tips, much to Dean’s delight. His gaze drops and he is mesmerized by the glistening sticky liquid bubbling up.
Castiel stood up, heart numb, looking down at the warm bed. He gently brushed the furs back into place before running his fingers through the soft hairs.
Dean laughed. “No. No, it’s because Omegas bring light and joy. Where there are no Omegas, the land dies, hearts grow sorrowful, songs grow silent.”
She wore a black, ankle-length, fur-lined coat with hood pulled over her features, a blue lantern hanging from her hip as she moved, her steps so elegant as to leave no ripple the water.
It takes more than a little prodding to get Dean to move on. His obvious fascination with cars is an obstacle that Cas only overcomes with promises to show him books and videos about them using his VR goggles when they get home. The word sinks in his gut like a stone in a river. He wishes that it wasn’t home to Dean, that they could vanish together someday in this idyllic place.
The Alpha forced himself to stop, allowing Dean to continue kissing down the side of his face to his neck, sending a shiver down his spine. He let himself collapse backwards onto the bed, his Omega on top of him, clawing at his dress shirt buttons. Cas watched as Dean finally undid his shirt, kissing and nipping and licking his way down his chest.
Cas vacantly nodded, lost at the feeling of Dean fingering his little hole, effortlessly sliding inside.
Despite everything, Cas could still smell Dean’s heat, feel it deeply affecting him, making him hard. Dean instinctively nuzzled the growing bulge.
“Quiet!” Cas commands, and miraculously, they listen. “What is going on?”
It took a little under a day to get home, as hauling the weapons back slowed them down a great deal. Unfortunately, the time did not pass quickly - after all of Meg’s words, both of them were hesitant to speak and mostly kept their eyes to the ground.
“Lazy bitch.”
Castiel himself was ecstatic, utterly delighted at the feeling of Dean beneath him, at moving so quickly through the snow, at the the biting cold against his cheeks. “Where are we going?” Castiel shouted over the roar of the wind.
“Come on, Castiel,” Jimmy said, pulling his twin up against the current.
That brings Cas up short. “What do you mean, isn’t allowed?”
“By the way, the service here is horrid. The only one who served me well is the one you fired. I’ll be sure to spread the word.”
Before he could dwell on it any more, he shifted forms, falling down on all fours, grateful for the warmth his thick fur now provided him.
“Do I?”
A pathetic sound creaked from the little creature’s throat as some last light flickered in his eyes.
“I don’t think I’m supposed to be the one reassuring you, Cas.” Dean teases with a dick-filling smile. Cas had been well on his way to hard, just thinking about what they are about to do. That smile, though. Fuck.
“Maybe,” he said, running his lips along the shell of his Omega’s ear. “But it doesn’t mean we can’t try.”
“Mr. Milton?” The fake name. Cas’s fake name.
“Why?”
A soft rustling.
The Omega gasped for air, collapsing back against his nest, feeling utterly spent, body wrecked and weak.
At last, he said, “Do you…
“There haven’t been that many.”
And making Castiel release a soft moan.
Castiel.
“I’ve told you a thousand times, it’s Jo.”
“I want to learn.”
Dean froze in shock. “I, I don’t-”
And in that moment, he knew.
Druids, in general, need to be good marksmen because they’re likely to run afowl of some evil beast and need a way to kill it - and approaching evil things is rather unwise. Best to shoot it.
Cas is drawn back to the bed like Dean is carrying the reverse of his particular polarity. Crawling up onto the edge, he leans over to give Dean a chaste kiss. When Dean tries to pull him into a deeper kiss, Cas ducks away.
Dean tripped, utterly swarmed by countless crows. His ears and neck were littered with bites and scratches, but he ignored them, standing to his feet to keep going.
“How do we know he isn’t doing this to make us want to stay around and be his mates? I mean, he just said he likes Omegas.”
Nothing at all.
“You bet your perky ass! But not just any blood - Worthy blood: blood of a Worthy mortal.”
He leaves it alone until after he has helped Dean wrap the gorgeous sarong around his hips. The pattern mimics the intricacy of sari fabrics, still popular in his caste even if India is on another continent, forgotten by just about everyone in this country. The earth tones work together beautifully and add a touch of masculinity to the piece. The coat is more of a wraparound sweater than a traditional coat, but that is typical with all of Dean’s clothes. They are the latest and trendiest fashions, often designed specifically for him and only him to wear.
All at once, the crows flew away to somewhere back behind him. But he couldn’t turn to see why.
Sam has never broached the subject with Dean because his brother has always been the epitome of Yumeijin perfection. Now, though, Dean is so changed by Cas’s presence in his life. Cas has cracked through the ridiculous shell that Dean has been building since they were boys, and now the real Dean is shining through.
Long after the steps retreat, Castiel slowly pulls the wig off of his head and tucks it into his beggar’s bag. Pulling a dirty, threadbare cloak out of the same bag, he puts it on over his head and adjusts it to cover his own nicer robe. The final step in the process is to pick up some of the foul mud from the ground and rub it everywhere that his skin shows. If he is to pass for one of the Namae nashi, the unnamed, he can’t appear to be clean in any way. His short hair is actually too long for the lowest of the castes. It should be shorn close to his skull like a sheep without its wool. He hopes that no one will be looking too closely.
Castiel bit his lip, running his hands up and down the stump, along its little speckles.
Not a big deal, though. There was a small convenience store at the end of the block, he’d just need to get dressed and go. It shouldn’t take him more than ten minutes round trip - three there, couple minutes in the queue, three back. Easy.
Lastly, though, he took off the amulet, about to lay it in the pile with everything else.
He shouted in pain, falling back, weakly, into what some part of him remembered was his mate’s lap.
“I want you, Dean.”
Sam catches the loneliness in Dean’s eye before he nods and looks at his hands.
Gathered around him was only his torn and threadbare cloak and the dying leaves of this dying forest. His only pallbearers, his only mourners.
A figure came into view, circling around him.
“You’re bigger than I am.” Looking away, he guides the pants off Cas’s legs and tosses them on the floor.
In the end, that work is all in vain. No one wants to help them, and even when Sam resorts to blackmailing an old friend for a chance to speak for Dean, the judge denies their claim. He is adamant that technology is fallible, which is exactly what they are trying to claim. While it works perfectly in the judge’s favor, their argument is shut down.
“No, it isn’t like that, it-”
“No, Dean. Any two people can be in a relationship. Actually, more than two people can have a relationship.” Cas watches Dean’s face start to distort in overload and he curtails his speech. “That’s beside the point. Men can fall in love with each other, too.”
At this, Cas turned his mate’s head to look him in the eye. “If you need eggs, we’ll get you eggs. I don’t give a damn how much they cost,” he said before sliding down to his ear to whisper warmly, “If you want to carry my pups, you will.”
Thank god he’d charged it at the previous motel’s steam engine—he didn’t have the sense to do it last night. It was a good thing too that his suitcase was light and he didn’t bring the wardrobe-trunk. He’d be able to carry it to the first stop. “Change mode of transport from drive to walk.”
Dean hummed in reply. “Don’t sound awfully sure there, Cas.”
Unfortunately for both Dean and his music preferences, all they had in the house was an iPod and their old boombox that had a CD player. Not a cassette player in sight, and it wasn't as if his songs were gonna get played on the radio.
The griffin produces a soft twitter, sinking and tucking its head back underneath its wings. Thoroughly dismissed by the beast, Dean tries to search for his own comfortable position.
Charis stepped behind Dean, peeking out from behind his back and watching Lucifer intently. There was a soft tremble in the hand that gripped Dean's shirt, followed by an insistent tug for Dean to move away from the lights that were the Cage. Dean wasn't sure if he was all right with being a shield to an unknown entity running freely in Heaven.
“Honestly Gabriel, I do not know how you got past the taste of molecules,” Castiel whispered.
and this sure ain't
Dean takes the proffered meal with less wariness, knowing that with no way down from the mountain, there is little he can do but trust Castiel. "Are you sure you can't bring me down the mountain?"
"Oh, no, no, no…" Sam backpedals, shifting his gears before emphasizing, "I'm
With those words, Charis hung her head. She unfurled wings, the first time Dean had seen them, before addressing Dean, "Goodbye, Dean. I won't remember you next time." Between one moment and the next, she was gone.
—the time when a witch is most vulnerable. It's when the shedding of blood from the uterus happens. During moontime, witches have a higher metabolism and burn up their body if food is not available. It is also the time when a witch physically cannot use her Jewels and have to ask someone to drain them fully. During moontimes, Blood males are more aggressive to others perceived as a threat and more conscientious towards the witches they consider their own.
"What guidance could I give you? I'm a
“Isn’t it obvious, Hannah?” Balthazar asks, trailing his fingers against Castiel’s cheek in a mock caress, which Castiel bats away. “Our Cassie doesn’t like anyone resisting his charms. It’s a point of pride with him. It’s a challenge.  He may not
where two other archangels are, Leilah."
Cas ignored Metatron, and the office dissolved back into the treetop. Cas was really on a roll, bending the seventh heaven to his will. In front of the prison that was Metatron's and Gadreel's, a soft spiral rose, forming out of the fire twisting and turning until it completed an arch. It was made of gold and pearl and was quite
"Yes. I remember," Charis answered meekly.
Gabriel was the only Novak who noticed Castiel. Their two older brothers had been intent on their one-upmanship. But Gabriel was also the brother who left Castiel to the tender mercies of their family. The small blond Novak had craved the outside world, then. He said he settled in California because of some girl. Despite this, Gabriel still worked for the Novaks in acquisitions.
Castiel reassures him that the soul won't suddenly be used up. The accompanying fatigue it gives Dean means he can only use the command words for a few and essential spells at least until he builds a tolerance for the drain of energy. Dean realizes he has a head for magic once the mage teaches him some of the incantations. Their magic is inherently different, but Castiel rolls with it and instructs him the best he can.
Dean waves a dismissive hand, “Nah, kissing is easy. Like riding a bike.”
“Yes, although he’s about a week’s journey from here. I could always fly, but it would leave me in no fighting condition, especially if you were my tagalong.” Cas talks almost as-if he’s not directly speaking to Dean, but then hones on him in the last moments of his tangent, “However, I have discovered an alternative form of transportation via one of the locals.”
As soon as they reach the stairs they’re met with safety, taking the steps two at a time and stopping once they’re at the top. The books have abandoned them and now fly around the bottom of the staircase like hawks circling for prey, and they along with the rest of the furniture sulk away, dejectedly, back to their posts.
Dean sucks in a breath, taken aback for just a moment as the conversation’s focus shifts to him, “My mom and really loved each other, yeah.”
Dean pauses, gnawing on his bottom lip as he tries to muster up the appropriate response, “No matter what happens, I know a lot of things will change.”
“Are you ready?” Cas asks, and Dean nods causing him to continue, “Now, we visit the Twilight Realm.”
“Well, I’ll be.” speak Izzy, because Dean is still speechless with the strange, uncomfortable pleasantness of being known, “It seems whatever’s on your heart more than makes up for your friend. He’ll take you.”
Dean turns to share victory smiles with Cas, but is stopped by the emergence of the producers, who usher Dean out of the living area into the interview room almost instantaneously. He’s spent less time in this room than some of the other contestants, namely Ketch and Lucifer, but he’s not sure if that bodes well or not. One thing’s for sure, though; they got his little disagreement on camera and they can edit it however they want, causing him to slump in his chair dejectedly.
Dean frees himself of his shirt, lowering himself into the water in a fluid motion as to not disrupt the silence, and the cool water is an instant relief. It leeches away the warm clamminess and washes clean and chlorinated over Dean’s skin. The headache he’s nursing begins to wriggle away.
“...Yes.” Cas, finally, has to look away in shame.
“Well, I could’ve helped—” Dean protests.
Dean blinks, caught up in the waves of a sudden storm and close to being thrown into their ravenous depths. When he speaks his voice is pinched between two very hard spaces, “What’s wrong with what we’re doing now? I mean, c’mon. Why can’t we just enjoy this?”
“Dean—”
It’s all they need to completely topsize them. Dean’s anger burns hot and Castiel’s anger is iced to the core, but the tan, turbid waters that rinse over their vision and dunk over their heads is lukewarm, and it brings them back to a level playing field. Luckily, it’s not deep, and after the initial shock of water shooting up his nose and running down the back of his throat he’s able to stand up and start getting air back into his lungs, even if his tongue reeks all over of salt and mud.
“No,” The young man paused, a soft, polite smile gracing his lips, “But someone does!”
“Dean could still wake up. You could still pull through.”
Dean watches Lord Berengerus struggle to pull Caleb out from the room and then Dean leaps up, free at last, and hauls Cas from the bathtub. Blood and water leaps from Cas’s body and colors them both with shades of rose and scarlet. Dean puts pressure on Cas’s wound immediately, leaning into his interlocked fingers to stop the blood flow.
“Not really.”
Dean sits and gets adjusted, fidgeting a bit more than strictly necessary and taking a deep, calming breath. It’s weird for him to be nervous; it’s just Cas and besides, he plays for people all the time. He finds his fingers going into a familiar song as he strums Zeppelin’s “Going to California” and there’s an extra tremble to them as he starts off with the lyrics. He’s no rock god but he can carry a tune.
After they’d reported to the bartender their scant findings he wasn’t exactly happy, but obliged to fork over some information regarding the lich they sought. It seemed speaking of liches was a little taboo, from the way the bartender had lowered his voice and drawn them close, but he was able to tell them where a shady, lower-level magician lived that probably had more answers for them. Counting it as a success, Dean had been more than gung-ho in telling Cas he was ready to go after the magician right then and there, but Cas had told him it was  time to return to Earth, and instructed Dean in a ritual involving drawing Dean’s blood with the angel blade and drawing a sigil with it, sprinkling it with the flower from earlier. As soon as the sigil activated, Dean was rendered unconscious once more.
Dean blinks in and out, but mostly out of being conscious of his surroundings as the producers chase the other contestants out of the car, fussing over their appearance and instructing them on their entrance. Dean is given a pun to use. Whatever, it’s not what matters. He gets to see Cassie again, and that’s all he’s thinking about save a brief but thorough thank-you prayer to whatever powers that be that Dean isn’t the guy they’re forcing into chicken costume. And seriously, what the hell? Dean feels like he might be in for more than he bargained for, on that account.
At this point, Dean’s figured out that there must be something tempting these men here that far outweighs a simple party, but the question is why haven’t they returned?
The air below the earth seems colder, yet stuffy in contrast with the racing patterns of the wind outside, threatening Dean with the idea that one little slip could leave them buried underneath rubble with a rapidly waning air supply, doomed to never re-emerge. The unknown of stepping into barely-lit terrain in front of them along with the pitch-black curtain at their backs left Dean subconsciously keeping a little closer to Cas, feeling like unseen eyes were staring at them from the walls.
“I see.” Cas gives a little nod of resignation, “I don’t particularly care for bar food, except burgers, and you know my taste in music.”
so i actually have the rest of this written already sans a few scenes, but i'm doing wanderingcas's december writing challenge so I'm hoping to knock out those last scenes before the end of the year and get the rest uploaded for y'all. im also a senior in high school, though, and will probably have brain rot from finals and such. wish me good luck >_<
“Suck my dick.” Dean tells him.
After exhausting his last lead—an old lady with dreadful grey skin that reported someone who “met your friend’s description” had made a purchase in her flower shop, yet who later informed Dean that she was blind—Dean found himself at the gated entrance into the town where, despite his better senses, he sat down in the dust and tipped his head between his hands.
He knows it has to be Cas. This is Cas’s grace, trying to guide him home just like it stopped him in the bathroom. And Dean remembers now, with new clarity, the vampire thrall that had almost ended him. How, in what he’d perceived to be his final moments, her eyes seemed to fog over just as she’d dropped the knife and abandoned him. Cas had been looking out for him, hadn’t he?
“You guys are going down.” Dean taunts, fixing a determined look on his face as he stares down Benny.
Three of spades. Dean barely registered it before his eyes fly to Cas’s face, desperate for a hint in his demeanor. Yet it seems Cas has had the same idea, because their eyes meet in a brawl of hazel green and cerulean blue and they glare at each other across the table, pressed lips unspeaking. Cas is unreadable to him, and yet Dean has to make the first move.
“It’s not about speed, it’s about rhythm.” Dean might joke about that if he were in a better mood, but as it is he rolls his eyes at Castiel’s cool tone. Dean is eyeing the camera crew on a neighboring bank as Castiel turns to face him, “Are you paddling correctly?”
It could’ve been worse. That’s why Dean is skeptical. It was troublesome enough to get himself out of Hell, and he wasn’t locked in a cage with two royally pissed-off archangels. And his stent in Hell had put the apocalypse in motion so, yeah, whatever had brought Sam back couldn’t be good. Their luck didn’t work so well.
Dean gets himself dealt into a card game with Ed, Harry, and Kevin—there’s never a shortage of games at the mansion; everybody is trying to kill time—and relishes in the fact that none of them have a poker face, winning himself a pile of Skittles.
He drinks deeply and with a happy little humm, “Mmm...that hits the spot.”
"Cas, you’re incredible.”
“Who said we had to do celebrities?” Dean tells him, “FMK Lisa, Cassie and...ha...Kevin.”
They’re informed of the nearest burger joint courtesy of the producers, and it’s a brief walk away and then they’re getting a table and ordering drinks as the cameramen set up. Lisa orders a beer, causing Dean to smile in approval, and puts in an order for pretzel sticks. Over dinner Dean talks to her about how his dad gave him his first beer when he was fifteen, which prompts a subsequent discussion of Dean’s dad, John, and his parental friend Bobby, who practically adopted Sam and Dean whenever their dad footed the bill.
“I’m going to tether my grace, now.” Cas’s voice sounds even deeper as it tapers into the last note, maybe he’s unsure of what manners are appropriate with a matter like this.
What Dean wanted was a guitar. For the past few weeks, he had been thinking about Cas’s music problem, and how that related to Cas’s Lisa problem, and how
“Exactly.” Dean breathes, tagging on something to sate the cameras, “I felt a connection tonight.”
Dean graciously accepts, looking down at the first question on the quiz as he responds, “I dunno, Castiel… whatever-your-middle-name-is Novak.”
“Why do you have angel grace, then?” The Empty counters.
“Cas?” Dean tries to chase the sleep from his eyes as he rolls to face Cas, coming nose-to-nose with him in the confused, hazy state of consciousness that comes from being simultaneously tipsy and hungover and roused so unexpectedly. Some sort of protest threatens Dean’s throat, maybe at their closeness, but his thoughts fall from him as Cas’s hands find purchase on Dean’s chest, Cas’s finger warm even through the pinched fabric underneath.
“Well, it wouldn’t be a
“To find Cassie!” Dean spits out in a sudden roar, probably waking up Cas’s neighbors. He regrets it immediately; he meant to never tell Cas about his past relationship.
“You’re right.” He says again, looking at her. She’s something sweet crusted over, crystalline. Then he shakes his head, and the moment passes, “Sorry, um. Anyways, you look beautiful tonight.”
“The only thing he eats is blood. Fresh from the victim.” Baely draps a bandage across Dean’s forehead and prepares to leave, “If you want to kill him, you must die.”
They curl close together on the bed, Dean’s head perched above Lisa’s as he stares at the wall opposite of him. Dean supposes it’s the unfamiliarity of the room that keeps him awake.
“Can you stop paddling on the left side of the boat?” Dean is brusque, his temper having gone to boil and steamed out the top of the kettle long ago, and he takes frantic spoonfuls of water with his oar on the right side.
Dean is shocked into silence, before he says, without any real venom, “I fucking hate you, Benny.”
Cas doesn’t move and, for a moment, Dean’s thinking that he crossed that haphazard line that they’d drawn and redrawn in the sand only for it to be swallowed up by the encroaching tide, and that Cas will distance himself, eclipsing the sunny mood. But Cas leans his weight against Dean’s back, hands resting against the soft part of Dean’s stomach, and then his lips brush the side of Dean’s face, chaste and sweet.
“More or less.” Cas says, and that’s all he has to say about that  as he begins walking towards something on the horizon—a city, “Let’s go.”
Cas lifts an eyebrow at him, an expression Dean has never seen on those features before. It makes Dean feel all the more like a stranger is in front of him, “I finished investigating the lich’s tower and managed to piece together a location spell to find him. It seems our magic works here, interestingly enough.”
There’s a confusing mash of emotions on her face, soft smile marred by glistening eyes and behind them, pain. Crumpled in one hand is a piece of paper, and Dean watches as Cas sees it, his expression suddenly a baffling calm. As he walks away, he holds his chin high like he’s walking into violent battle. Dean tries to resist watching, but Dean’s a moth to a flame, only interrupted by the arrival of Micheal by his side.
Dean would say something back but Cassie and Lisa make an entrance and he’s already standing up, moving towards them, and giving Castiel a nod as he departs. He wants to catch Cassie’s eye again, but the producers rush into the fray and gather up the contestants in their hands, shuffling them liberally and dishing them back out at measured intervals to speak to the Bachelorettes and Dean doesn’t even make it over there before Cassie’s saddled up with someone else.
Dean’s head swims as he makes his way back to his motel room, the flare of his temper making his hands itch into fists, and he curls and stretches them in unison to ebb the emotion. A roll of masking tape is on his wrist like a bracelet, and he stops short outside of his room, trying to figure out how to tape the outside of his door, when he unexpectedly runs into Benny. Benny’s in a pair of flannel pajama pants and a baggy t-shirt, looking like he was just roused from sleep with a yawn plastered across his face.
Dean watches as Cas, battered and bruised, rises to his full height and definitely raises his chin, staring down the fire as he summons whatever strength lay within him in order to to spread his wings, casting huge black shadows on the walls around them and causing a roar of thunder that shakes the very foundation of the cave. It seems Dean’s fears of a cave-in weren’t unfounded, for the tiny fissure of the wall is soon suffocated by a multitude of falling rocks, just as stalactites make their descent to the ground.
He doesn’t ask Dean’s name, so Dean volunteers it with a smile, “I’m Dean.”
“Hm…?”
Dean rolls his eyes, laughing under his breath as he goes inside to shower. He beats the others, who will scrap for the remaining bathrooms, and returns downstairs warm with still-wet hair dripping onto his stretched AC/DC shirt. He plops down next to Cas, who still smells faintly of chlorine and is peeking over the edge of a medical textbook.
“No, you don’t.” Her silken hands encompass his larger, leathered hands and it’s only ruined when she looks at the camera, stiffening, “Just be the real you.”
Upon returning to the mansion, Benny had flopped down, face-up on one of the couches and now stared blankly at the ceiling. Cas sat on the armrest of his couch, giving Benny an unsure little pat on the forehead and shooting Dean a pleading glance, looking to him for rescue, and expression turning into a mix between wide-eyed anxiety and glowering resentment as Dean abandons him to go to the kitchen.
“As you know, we cannot visit that realm freely.” Haneal snaps, “While we have wizened to the importance of free will and humanity, we are willing to sacrifice a human life in the pursuit of the greater cause. Think of your brother.”
“Sammy? That really you?” Dean’s voice sounds calmer to his ears than he feels, torn between elation and anxiety.
“French?”
The ward spell was simple enough, and for once in his life Dean is pleasantly surprised that it was, actually, a ward spell and not some plot to trap or otherwise screw them over. Afterwards, upon Cas’s insistence, the magician—whose name was Randall—took them on a hike through the wilderness of the land, which Dean thought would be much more exciting than it was.
Then Micheal asks him some stupid question about Dean’s college education–or lack thereof–and the moment passes. Dean’s tipsy by the time Lisa calls him around, but that’s pretty standard for these interviews, anyways. Their conversation mainly centers on Ben, and how Dean will act if they meet. Dean’s able to vouch for his parental skills, citing that he practically raised Sammy-which was true.
Dean perches on the edge of his own bed, across from Cas, sighing at him, “Don’t be so down. Lisa likes you, too.”
Dean wrinkles his nose, crossing over to the table where Cas holds his mess and, recovering the bowl from earlier, makes a fresh cut in his palm that he squeezes into the bowl while trying to resist making a face at it. Cas accepts this without thanks and combines it with one of the two preparations he’s been working on for the better part of an hour.
“Just stop.” Dean is deflated, blinking away the cave dust from his eyes, “I don’t wanna hear your excuses.”
Dean returns to him, a week later, with no sign of Cas. He looks everywhere,  rowing about like a lost, helpless animal of prey in the now seemingly threatening world. When he does find Cas, or rather, Cas finds him, he’s drinking away in the bar, deep in  a drink that might not be remotely alcoholic but has the placebo effect of taking the edge nonetheless.
“Leave him out of it. Nobody wants any trouble but you.” Dean tries not to get worked up, knowing that there’s cameras watching, but a little bile leaks into his voice anyways.
It’s not a question, but Dean can only nod, looking away.
It’s been six months, now. Depending on his mood, sometimes that six months can feel like days or years. Dean thinks it doesn’t matter how long it's been, not now that his life is one continuous stream of monsters and gore and blood that will ultimately be cut-off by his death.
Cas isn’t surfacing from where Dean saw him disappear, and Dean hopes he hasn’t done something stupid like swan dive into the concrete bottom. It lends him urgency as he paddles through the cool water and dives underneath, eyes stinging against the intrusion of chlorinated water, and fumbles around searching for Cas’s solid form.
According to Bobby, around three hours ago Sam had knocked on the door, barely staggering through the threshold and giving Bobby a hug before collapsing on the floor. “He’s just dehydrated, is all.”
“Oh.” Dean tries to sound dejected for him, but there’s an unexpected note of relief that bleeds through his tone that he hastily swallows back, “Sorry.”
A few of the other contestants looked around with disbelief, including the gangly guy named Garth, “No way! That’s some luck. I get drunk off of one beer.”
Before Cas can answer, their attentions are garnered by Sam opening the door of his room, peering out into the commotion and bright lights of the hallway with bleary, annoyed eyes. He looks about a second away from bitching at Dean, but he registers Cas, and the animosity drops from his face and lands somewhere on the floor.
“Jeez, son, I was just making sure you weren’t comatose.”
there we have it!! hopefully a big dramatic kiss is what y'all needed. one of the reasons there was a delay in posting was because i could never quite settle on an ending i liked, but hopefully this is good enough ://
“Sammy.” Dean breathes, and he’s not sure who he’s speaking to, but inviting his brother into a hug.
Dean’s other hand pulls Cas’s leg up around his waist so Dean can replace the hand stroking Cas through his underwear with something else, pushing them both to the side of the pool until Cas’s back brushes concrete.
Dean is skimming the pages of a book about different curses late one evening while a storm rages outside, and he falls asleep with the book still open on his chest. His sleep is fitful, tossing and turning as the worries of the day make it into his sleeping mind. At a clap of thunder he wakes, or maybe his subconscious knows, because as he blinks open his eyes he’s alarmed to see a dark figure cutting a silhouette through the flash of  lightning outside his window.  He scrambles for his gun, aiming and about to shoot until he’s interrupted by a stern voice, urging him to stillness.
“You looked lost.” Dean mumbles, his grumble of voice almost at a whisper.
Aw, shit. Well, it was only a matter of time of them getting caught if they were being so flippant about it. Dean guesses he’s thankful that it’s over then, except for something twisting sharp and rusty right into the depths of his heart.
“Maybe I could use a friend around here.” Dean ventures, boldly. But he’s decided that Cas is wired less tight than in the night of the first rose ceremony.
“C’mon, brother. You both need to cool down.” Benny sets a hand on Michael's shoulder, which he shoves off aggressively.
“Yes.” Cas breathes, a hint of smile returning, “I had begun to think I misjudged her from the first night, but she’s very down-to-Earth.”
“C’mon you two,” Garth wags his eyebrows, “You’re totally the best friends of this season.”
“Hush, did I say I was upset?”
There’s a lot to be said about Dean’s heart in his moment, the initial shock that slides too-easy into excitement, even hope. The only thing he can say through the grogginess of sleep is, “Cas? Whaddya doin’ here?”
Ash ends up winning the hand–Dean has shit cards anyways–and they start anew. Dean checks his cards in a flash and sees he has clubs and hearts, they could end up as a straight if he’s lucky, but his time right now is better spent observing the other contestants. Micheal bets, Dean’s thinking he just has a high card, and everybody but Benny calls. Alfie raises a red chip. Dean recalls that he’s never seen Alfie playing poker before.
“Cassie.” He breathes, wanting to kiss it into her skin, missing her even though she’s right in front of him.
“A what? Is that some type of bug?” Dean’s nose wrinkles, thinking about some squirmy parasite.
And to add insult to injury, the final surprise of the night is that Dean himself receives a rose–the indicator that he gets to go on to the next round of competition–from Lisa. What she sees in a guy who’s been tispy half the night, finalizing the heartbeat that he’s been putting off for months, Dean isn’t sure. He marches up to her robotically, wondering if she can see the sickness in his face and hands. Or if maybe he’s more obvious than that, and there’s a clawed-out gorge vomiting up blood where his heart is supposed to be. Evidently not, because she grins at him as he accepts it. He tries to give her something with teeth back, but it comes out looking like a half-baked sneeze.
It takes a moment for the new players to change into their swimwear, and in the meantime Cas migrates towards Dean so there’s no question which team he’s on. To Dean’s delight, Benny joins them along with Ketch. Opposing them are Garth, Alfie, Lucifer, and Michael with the latter two bickering about being stuck with the former.
“Really?” Dean asks, and come to think of it, he hasn’t had a good burger in some time, either. He could always make some at the house, but food is always better in the right company.
Dean doesn’t hide the disgust from his face, causing Berengerus to laugh as he exits the room. Tending to Dean is the fae from earlier, Baely, which is surely not a coincidence. Baely manhandles Dean as he cleans up the wound on his forehead; apparently the health of his hostages is of utmost importance to Lord Berengerus.
When Cas speaks, Dean thinks he must be imagining the note of disappointment, “That’s probably for the best.”
Dean, his newfound verdicts withering like parched grass, spins to face Cas, who has presumably let himself into the bunker. Dean can’t even conjure up relief, in fact, he’s kind of pissed off. Cas could’ve saved him a helluva lot of trouble by getting here earlier. He doesn’t even address the angel through his outrage and disappointment, deciding that he no longer has anything to say to Cas and vowing to answer only in yes, no, and grunts. He will, under no circumstance, bring up the events of tonight; of the angel’s heartbreaking words. It was, after all, a mistake. No need to unnecessarily complicate it.
“Beautiful.” Cas breathes, just as Dean is about to turn and high-tail it out of there.
“We’ll see.” Dean frowns at the next question, “Favorite color? C’mon, who even cares about stuff like that?”
Dean is escorted to a narrow, secluded spiral staircase that offers them a moment of privacy for Baely to say, “My Lord has surmised that you’re...interesting. You’re not quite from here, are you Dean?”
Dean turns, looking for a weapon and—
He hears Lisa call out to him, curious, as he runs past her and the others, but Cas is stepping out of the limo now and Dean won’t be stopped. Instead, he calls out between panting breaths, “Cas, wait!”
There is a heavy silence in the room and with this Dean knows that everything has changed. The sight of Cas, tear-eyed through his anger makes Dean unbearably tired of them beating eachother up. Instead, he becomes so  mesmerized by how the
“You need to cooperate with us, are you going to call this thing off?” Max says.
“What do we do?” Dean demands, immediately. He will not expect anything less than a solution, not when fate and chance have brought back his brother to him once again. Bobby looks like he wants to protest, but remains silent as Cas turns to Dean.
The second rash decision of the night comes easier than the first. Dean leaps up, and is immediately met with the shouts of both security members, cautioning him to stay put. They’d expected him to go back through the mansion, if anything, and so the thirteen foot or so drop from the patio is completely unguarded and Dean makes his breakaway, but not before one security guard grabs him arm and he has to throw a punch to shake the offender off.
The lights flip on and they break apart, panicked at the intrusion. Dean doesn't know what their visitor just saw, and yet he's afraid to turn around for fear of his face betraying it all. Instead he watches Cas's face adopt a mask of normalcy as he says, "Hello, Benny."
The guests were both human and non-human, but all of them were young-ish and male-ish. The manner of dress was also all over the place, with some having on something that looked strikingly like lingerie and one man, with white skin and hair, wearing a parka. Dean assumed they were from all over the place and, in truth, he doesn’t know how far he himself traveled to get here.
“No, you’re Dean.” Cas says absolutely, distractedly flicking back water, “I know a Dean when I see one.”
He takes  a step forward despite his fears he might plunge down into the void forever, because he has a mission, “Cas?”
This time Cas does roll his eyes, “You need to hurry before they return.”
“Dean, you should think about what you’re doing to Cas. And what you’re doing to Lisa. Maybe he’s what’s best for you.”
“Everything go okay, Cas?” Dean asks, thinking Cas will open up. Cas just nods, so he continues, “Do you think you have a connection?”
“What are we doing here?” Dean whispers to Cas as they break the threshold of the bar and its members turn to fix the two travelers with a hostility similar to what they saw outside.
And then there’s a sound like splintered wood as Cas drives an angel blade into the end table. It stops jumping for a moment, letting Dean roll out from underneath it, and Cas has the hint of a victorious smile before the end-table turns, slowly, and makes a move to chase them down. They fly away from the other furniture and try to maneuver towards the staircase, even though the books are flitting around their faces and trying to dive in.
