Sherlock closes his eyes, the after-image of John’s paper burned into his retinas giving him the perfect backdrop to replay several of his favourite sexual fantasies involving John. Attempting to remove John’s trousers or shirt in every case results in John’s form vanishing from Sherlock’s imagination. Only the firm thought of John fully clothed allows him to continue the fantasy. It is problematic, but Sherlock has developed several workarounds that have been quite satisfying, although there is something incomplete about it. Sherlock can’t place the sensation, the lack that has nothing to do with John’s skin. “Not immune... no. Perhaps... overly hasty in my initial negotiations of our relationship.”
The air goes out of John in a solid gust, he deflates and relaxes against the chains. “Oh… oh gods, it is too much… please, Dominus, slower.”
“That’s a good boy, you’re sweeter when you work for it…” The Dominus drops his hands from John’s body and stops moving entirely.
“Fucking… tight little tart.” Murray pushes John forward, pulling out and splashing come over John’s arse. He slicks his cock with it and pushes back into John.
“He hasn’t told you anything has he? Of course not. Bloody Sherlock. Well if I’m going to give you the birds and bees talk can we at least go get some tea?”
John does as he’s told. The mag locks on his wrists engaging as soon as they touch. He tries to move his wrists a little, testing the range of motion, finds he can adjust where the locks touch slightly, but can’t pull his wrists apart without visibly straining.
Lila shrugged. ‘Sure.’ When John looked aghast, she burst out laughing and punched him (none too gently, either) on the left arm. ‘Joking, John. I’m honoured, although you didn’t need to do that- I’ve loved this whole experience. And August needs his weekly dose of Rosie.’
to hurt my brother I will personally tear off your limbs, through them in the Thames, freeze your torso and break it into tiny bits before feeding you to the corgis.’
‘Right.’ Sherlock nodded. He could see a blond head in the corner and smiled. He had always thought blond hair seemed so much….happier.
When Harry had come back into the kitchen with a man following behind her, John recognised him as Sherlock’s chauffeur and stood up, smiling, expecting the man to say Sherlock had left a hoodie or something behind and that he had come to return it, but instead Jack had said in a deadpan tone that John was required at the palace and must come immediately. John should have known something was wrong then: Jack was always polite and friendly but he just looked still and robotic, avoiding eye contact and speaking in a monotonous voice, but John hadn’t been concerned. He expected Sherlock just wanted to see him and couldn’t be bothered to get his phone.
all accompanied by Henry’s smile. ‘And,’ Henry continued hopefully, ‘Your little brother was born six months ago. I told him all about you, John. I tell him about you all the time.’
He didn't like the label bi; he didn't like any labels, really. He was content with not gay, for now at least.
John grinned, leaning back, and Sherlock slid back into an alcohol-dazed stupor. ‘Er, no, they don’t. You tend to rub ‘em up the wrong way.’
‘Ridiculous,’ Sherlock said vaguely, eyes fixed on his door. ‘You are in optimum health. Slightly underweight, arthritis, one false hip, good teeth. No signs of premature mental diseases such as Alzheimer’s-‘
‘His name is James Moriarty,’ Sherlock said tightly. ‘He’s Irish, and he is not important. The third, though, is.’
Sherlock smiled, a feeling that he couldn’t quite place bubbling in his chest, and held out the slip of paper that he’d written his number on just before John had led him from the hall. ‘Call me, John Watson?’
Sherlock reached into the oven and took out the biscuits, which had crumbled into a dark brown sludge. ‘Well,’ he said. ‘They’re not exactly golden-brown, but I think I can make them work.’
‘Why are you laughing?’ Charlotte said stonily, interrupting the laughter. ‘Why would that be an issue?’
): Sherlock had agreed for him to pay Lila because Mycroft still owed him for sending him into exile fourteen years earlier, and telling James Moriarty all his secrets. ‘Right. Well. Great that that’s going on without us knowing, but…is everything ok?’
The square was silent. Mycroft began to speak again. ‘He died from so far unexplained causes. It was not expected.’
The cheering was deafening; Sherlock winced as he stepped forwards, glaring at the crowds until his father nudged him and shook his head minutely. The huge screens surrounding the courtyard showed his scowling face and Sherlock rearranged his features to look indifferent. Morag wouldn’t be delighted about that, which was a plus for him, but it wouldn’t get him into as much trouble as the suicidal expression.
‘It’s nice having you back.’ John whispered as Sherlock led him to the stairs. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ‘I was gone for a week, John. Less than two hundred hours. I’ve been gone for far longer before.’
) screamed from nearby, hurling himself across the small room and into his brother’s arms. Sherlock patted the child awkwardly on the back. ‘I had breakfast with you this morning, Archie. No need to treat me as if I’ve just returned home from war.’ He muttered.
‘Hello?’ The voice, silky and deep and smooth as honey, made John jump and he looked up. It was the boy from outside, he realised, wearing that cap and the coat.
’Right,’ Irene said, and as John tore his eyes away from Sherlock he noticed that she looked angrier than he had ever seen. ‘He’s overstepped the boundary. That’s
Sherlock resisted the urge to turn around and give his father the finger; it would accomplish nothing. He and his father got on, most of the time, but he honestly and truly hated the blatant homophobia his father seemed to possess. He had never come out, he hadn’t needed to; James had taken care of that for him, but sometimes he felt like standing on the palace roof and telling the world that yes, he was a homosexual (he would never do that, though. It was the palace's most tightly guarded secret and he really would be banished if it got out). Yes, he always would be. No, it wasn’t a phase. Why did everyone ask if it was a phase? Should he start asking straight people if it was a phase?
‘Yeah.’ John confirmed. ‘You’re my first…well. You’re the first I’ve ever gone down on. What about you?’
The third thing they said was ‘Well, Mr Watson. We don’t have anything at the moment. We’ll let you know if something comes up.’
Sherlock leaned forward and studied the box, before picking it up and sniffing it. ‘No chemicals. Probably not an experiment. When I first moved in here I put a load of junk in the spare bedroom. It must have been something we missed when we cleared it out before you were born.’
John can’t say that, though. Not now, not at his son’s wedding. Instead he stands up and claps his son and his son’s new wife as they walk away, and he knows he will remember the happy smile on Nathaniel’s face for as long as he will live.
And Sherlock looked into his eyes, the eyes of this random boy who he’d never even met before, and realised that he felt happier than he had felt in years.
with him? Had he been roofied? That was so ironic he wanted to laugh…except he wanted to kiss the man more.
‘I knew it!’ Molly shrieked. ‘I knew you had a girlfriend! Mike owes me fifty quid.' Sherlock smirked when he heard Mike's name: the guard was one of the few people who knew about John's friendship with Sherlock and had been sworn to secrecy. Clearly, he hadn't blabbed yet, which pleased Sherlock greatly. Mike Stamford was clever
Sherlock talked about a little boy who had been told by his father's advisor, just a few weeks after the death of his mother, that he was getting a nanny. The advisor had been delighted, because she had always hated it that his mother had refused nannies and bought him up solely alone. Now she was dead, and Morag could do what she wanted.
‘What’s your name?’ Sherlock asked suddenly, and it took John a moment to realise that he was asking
John was quiet for so long that Sherlock, hands held stiffly in position, began to feel a little bit uncomfortable. ‘John. Ok?’ He was beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea, if he’d been imagining it, if there really wasn’t anything there and
‘That,’ Sherlock continued, ignoring her completely, ‘he will accept my offer to attend the large social gathering involving dancing, secret drinking and everyone pretending to like each other held annually for the year 13’s at Sherwood Grammar School with me is extremely low- there is no way he would ask me. He’s John, Molly! Everyone loves him-‘
accompany what he has just said. John’s been waiting, dreaming about this moment for his entire life and he’s sure that it will be a thrill like no other.
Mycroft looked at the ground as he followed Sherlock out of the boy’s quarters. ‘Not of everyone’s lives. And do try and struggle on to the last syllable, brother dear. My-
‘A book by its cover.’ Hamish looked at him evenly, and Sherlock noticed his eyes were the colour of the sky. ‘Maybe you aren’t a giant cock.’
Sherlock sighed. ‘I can’t change the rule, John, that would look suspicious. You should be glad I told them that, as a minor, you were exercising your right to have your face blurred out.’
John looked at him sceptically. Sherlock huffed. ‘You’re going back to London, John, not fucking Australia. We’ll see each other.’ He paused. ‘Right?’
John hadn’t laughed when Sherlock told him this; in fact, he had looked slightly sheepish. ‘How did you get into that?’ He had asked curiously.
William sighed. His eyes were slightly less angry now, more sad as he stared at his favourite son, his heir, the boy who stood to inherit a nation from him. ‘Yes. I agree.’
John coughed and turned back to the lake, glad it was dark so Sherlock couldn't see the insane smile on his face. ‘I haven't seen much of Mycroft this holiday. Is he ok?’
Why had John told himself that it hadn’t been a plot by James Moriarty and possibly that poisonous advisor? Why hadn’t John been suspicious in any way?
But John wasn’t really listening anymore, attention drifting to Sherlock, who was still standing motionless, staring at his phone. It occurred to John that it wasn’t like Sherlock to lose concentration at a crime scene, especially a locked-room mystery like the woman on the floor, and so he approached him from behind, placing a hand gently on his arm and saying, ‘Love? What’s going on?’
‘This again?’ James groaned. ‘It was a relationship, Sherlock. It was deep, it was dark, it was dirty, but it was a relationship.’
Sherlock rolled his eyes and ignored the voice. ‘Yes, of course. Always for you.’ Then, realising that he sounded like a love-sick fool, continued, ‘as long as there’s not a murder to solve.’
At almost seventeen, John was fulfilling everything expected of him. He was the captain of the rugby team, popular at school, a hit with the ladies. He was going to receive his GCSE results in just a couple of weeks and was predicted 4 A*, 5As and a B.
Sherlock blinked and locked the memory back in his mind palace, behind a thick door. He couldn’t relive any of those particular memories; they made the blackest feeling wash over him-
‘Etes-vous stupide, ou pouvez-vous pas parler français?’ - Are you stupid, or can you not speak French?
‘You mean…’ Sherlock trailed off. Morag laughed delightedly. ‘Yes, Sherlock. She was having an affair. It may have even started while she was pregnant. Truthfully, she never knew if you were William’s child; you had her eyes, you see.’
At this point John expected the boy to stand up and piss off, but the bluntness of his remark seemed to please him, for the boy then sat down opposite John. ‘No one’s ever talked to me like that.’
That night, as Sherlock, John, Violet, Octavia and Dante lay in the big double bed and John read the hobbit, Sherlock looked at his family and he felt breathtakingly overwhelmed with everything. His entire life, everything that had happened in the last thirty-five years, everyone who had ever mattered to him, flashing before his eyes. His mother, his father, Mycroft, Jim, Irene, Molly, Mike, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, Violet, Octavia, Dante.
‘You have created a child.’ Mycroft’s face, if possible, has turned even sourer and Sherlock wonders if he’s smiled at all in the past four hundred years. ‘You cohabit. You- you engage in physical intimacies. What sort of example are you setting for your son?’
Sherlock shrugged. ‘It doesn’t change anything. I accepted I was- I was a homosexual years ago. It doesn’t change anything. I will never fall in love. It won’t affect me in any way. I’ll marry some European princess, have a couple of bratty kids, have a secret other life or something.’ He chuckled at the end, though Victor still looked slightly sorry. ‘What about Mycroft?’
‘The first,’ Sherlock whispered, ‘is that King Sherlock William Scott is a homosexual, and has been since he was fourteen years old.’
John didn’t reply. Instead, he was totally focused on the parade, which he couldn’t exactly see (there was a huge crowd of people in front of him, blocking it from view) but could most definitely hear, just as it had been nine years ago, if not a little louder.
) had won one of those ‘win a prize, see the royals’ competitions, he fixed his gaze on the only person in the room he actually liked.
Always John. Whatever happened, John was the most important thing in his life (bar his children, of course) and Sherlock was so, so grateful that he had been given him.
‘You’re British too, smart arse.’ John whispered the words weakly but it still made Sherlock laugh, and he nodded. ‘Maybe. Mais ma loyauté est avec la France, John Watson, et tu.’
The noises seemed to fade away, and for a moment in time they were alone together. ‘So, Sherlock murmured, ‘If not gay, then what?’
Sherlock smiled coldly at his reflection and turned away, walking slowly towards the bed. ‘Do we have time…?’ He asked Irene, already fiddling with the button on his trousers.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘But they’re wrong, and we know they’re wrong. It doesn’t matter if they think we’re together; we’re not, are we?’ Sherlock ignored the pang in his heart that followed these words and watched John, who shook his head and sighed. ‘I guess it’s better, doing it now. That way they find out from us that you've been secret best friends with the heir to the throne for the last year and a half.’
‘Touché,’ Mycroft said, looking displeased because that seemed to be the fat git's default expression. ‘But I won’t let you into my office if you continue to break priceless artefacts. It isn't very respectful.’
“Damn right, Princess.” Murray gives John a wicked grin before turning away to find his trousers and pants.
“If anyone gives you any trouble… well… no one at the Yard will say anything. Sherlock is their boss… or at least he’s overseeing their division, he won’t stand for it.” Her eyes are fierce as she meets John’s gaze. “Don’t you let anyone…”
The next morning doesn’t start with an explosion, or a mad dash around the city. There’s still nothing worthy of Sherlock’s time. John calls in to the service and puts himself back on the rotation, but there’s nothing for him either. John goes down to Speedy’s for a take away breakfast sandwich and the papers and settles in to try and find Sherlock
John stretches on the duvet, he’d love nothing more than to crawl under the covers and stay. The bed is surprisingly good for the kind of hotel room he finds himself in. At the end of a train line, hours from London, far enough that he can’t be tempted, that he has to decide to go back. He could... just not go back to Baker Street. He could just drop everything and pick up somewhere fresh. It is both easier and more difficult now. He’d have to go somewhere, wait out the lifespans of everyone who would remember him in London. There is only so much he can do with the glamour to change his appearance, the constant drain on his attention and energy will eventually break down and he’ll slip, and the last thing he needs is an accidental drop… tentacles everywhere... screaming Tube passengers, etcetera.
John stands, feeling fragile and stiff, like a puppet with its strings cut learning to stand on his own. He moves to the door and pushes it gently, not really believing it will move until it swings out towards Greg and he catches it to pull it the rest of the way open.
“We tried to live with you, tried to co-exist. You fought against us, and yet you volunteered for this… suicide by Dominus? Will you provoke me until I kill you?”
The Dominus narrows his eyes, flicks his fingers to shut off the wall. “And you spent the morning watching the news reports?”
John is looking at him, watching Sherlock watch John’s mouth as he moves his head against the pressure of Sherlock’s hand on his skull.
It is her turn to shrug. “It all depends, dear. Sometimes it only happens in the early stages - your eyesight might actually improve. There’s pills, if you get migraines, but he doesn’t like them.” She looks at the blank wall opposite the door. “Best not, unless you’re in pain. You aren’t, are you?”
His hair’s still damp but he is pronounced presentable nearly an hour later when he’s kneeling outside the Dominus’ door.
Except he doesn’t, he moves, slides, shifts himself closer. The space between their chairs is so small if Sherlock stretches he can rest his feet on John’s lap. He hasn’t, but he could. Such a small space, John doesn’t even have to stand to cross it, just leans forward until he’s not sitting in his chair but kneeling between Sherlock’s knees. And from there... it is only a moment’s work, the brush of fingers over button and zip, a subtle movement on Sherlock’s part, an opening of hips, a spreading of knees.
“Something about consent... apparently it’s fine for you to consent to be the object of my sexual and dietary needs in public. But I’m not allowed to assume the consent of…” he gestures vaguely at the area of the room that doesn’t contain John; “other people.” He wrinkles his nose, making the words sound like the worst sort of insult.
John relaxes, apparently he isn’t going to be punished for watching the news, then he tenses again. “So if they were all taken, it has to be someone we would trust… someone that wouldn’t even register as a threat. Military police?”
“I did… what would you have done if I hadn’t found any?” Murray tosses a small, more-empty-than-full tube at John, exchanging it for John’s trousers.
John’s woken by a rattling sound, no memory of how he ended up in the bed in his cell. His eyes are gummy and he sneaks his hand out of his blankets to rub his face, cracks his eyes open against the terrible whiteness of the room.
“Yeah, I get it.” John settles onto the floor and arranges the loose robe around him, fighting to keep his expression clear.
John follows, trying to keep the middle distance between the bed and the frame. Oddly hopeful that passing too close to the frame will trigger the maglocks in his cuffs and collar and he will get dragged into the frame.
Salt and pepper hair, dark eyes difficult to place exactly how old he is, wearing something that looks like old fashioned pajamas if pajamas could be considered sexy. Or maybe tailored, do people have tailored pajamas? John’s brain is confused and muggy like maybe he had actually come out of cryo. He closes his eyes again.
After his preparation John doesn’t expect delicacy, the Dominus pushes into him in one stroke that seems to go on forever. John groans low in his throat, the sound becoming higher and more desperate as he is filled. The Dominus wraps his fingers around John’s thighs and pulls him closer, chains clicking as they adjust to the new angle.
The last waves of John’s orgasm pass, and he’s falling, no longer supported by the Dominus’ bite, and unable to hold himself up.
John tilts his head and feels cool fingers pulling at the lock. When the chain falls away he is hauled to his feet with gentle pressure around his collar. He blinks rapidly and takes in the Dominus in front of him; pale skin, high cheekbones and a mop of unruly hair, dark purple shirt and black trousers John might have been able to afford second hand on his army pension.
This isn't the first time. He's done this before, he can do this again - all that he needs is to remember the taste of Sherlock on his lips. He gives up trying to take off his jumper and concentrates on the fly of the fly of his jeans.
You could make it sound like it wasn't a question, like you were sure… because he'd want it that way. He'd want to be told, to be able to pretend that he didn't have a choice, but he'd lean against the side of your bed, and he'd push back into you because he wants to.
The workout room is just across the hall from ‘his’ room, blank white corridor stretching out on both sides. Open doors to signify his path.
She stiffens, turns on her kitten heels and storms off. John leans his head against the wall and tries not to think about how stupid he is,
“Indeed. I will explain rules only once, you will obey them. If you do not obey there will be consequences.”
The door closes behind her, leaving John staring at a rack of street clothes and wondering what the hell is going on.
John goes to war to die. It is, it has been, a handy way to vanish and reappear without raising any suspicions, and there is always a war somewhere. He’s been careful, generally, he’s actually accomplished with a variety of weapons. It had taken, well... a lot to finally put Father in the ground. John doesn’t particularly want to experiment with his own mortality. He’s been wounded, at times severely, and he knows that he heals faster than his fully human counterparts. He doesn’t enjoy the healing process. The shift in warfare to ranged weapons… well he doesn’t have any defenses against bullets, he’s sadly not telekinetic. The one that had brought him home from Afghanistan had torn through his shoulder and the uppermost tentacle on his left side. He’d had to, and he isn’t proud of it, he’d glamoured Bill Murray into helping him and then forgetting about the tentacle. John had been vaguely… it had been disquieting when the tentacle had grown back, he’d wondered if it would… certain species of octopus can regenerate limbs. He’d tried not to think too long on what that meant about his own genetics.
John shrugs. “I was a doctor and a soldier. I learned clarinet at school.” He nods towards the violin case on one of the chairs. “Doubt I’m any good at it now though.” John licks his lips, suppressing the tiny frisson of fear at the idea that he’s being so cheeky to the Dominus.
John reading the paper one afternoon, long lines of light cutting across the sitting room, Sherlock sitting opposite him, because he can, that’s how they are. John folding the paper calmly, preparing to get up, to make tea, to do whatever it is John does, shopping…
… He wants Sherlock behind him, pushing into him solid and heavy, he wants the slap of Sherlock’s hips against his arse, to bury his face in Sherlock’s lap until he does gag on Sherlock’s cock. He wants to beg Sherlock to fuck him. “
, the near conspiratorial tone that makes John’s pulse quicken and the tiniest flush of colour rise in his cheeks. Unseen behind the paper.
They’ve shared the bottle around, and there wasn’t enough for anyone to be really drunk, just… loose, and the stories start tumbling over each other around the fire, bragging and exaggerations of epic proportions. John’s heard all of Murray’s stories before so he stops paying attention, daydreaming instead about the way Murray’s hands would feel…
“No, well yes. Sherlock called Mycroft last night, the thrall they caught. The rickshaw driver who’d been killing those people. They have to find this Dominus Moriarty and... well they will deal with it.”
John groans, wishing that he had something to brace against as the Dominus starts to move, pulling almost all the way out before slamming back into him. “
She leaves him, standing beside the door to the Dominus’ chamber, and he’s just trying to decide if he should knock or kneel when the door opens.
Think about John, think about him letting you, about him wanting to be there… he'd be able to get up, to walk away and stop this thing you are going to do to him… but he won't… he wants it as much as you do so he'd stay. He can get up, can tell you no. You are evenly matched, he's stronger than he looks, stronger than you gave him credit for at first. If he wanted to go you couldn't stop him. But he doesn't want to go.
“Yes, Princess.” He does it anyway, squeezing the tube dry over his cock and smearing the rest between John’s legs.
Greg scrubs his hands over his face. “Wonderful. I’d blame it on how long he’s been on synthetics but… he’s always been an asshole. And then he shows you a thrall… leaves it to me to…” He heaves himself off the couch. “I definitely need whiskey for this conversation.” He takes two long gulps from his coffee mug, and John can’t help but watch the way his Adam’s apple works as he swallows. He skirts around the coffee table and opens a cupboard at the bottom of the bookshelf by the passage to the kitchen. “You want any?” The bottle is expensive looking but John shakes his head. The toast is staying down but there is no reason to push that particular limit.
The Dominus pulls John’s hips up and thrusts sharply, sliding home until John can feel the press of cotton and sharp bony hips against his arse. The Dominus strokes his hands over John’s hips and arse, soothing his tremors. Gentle fingers spread John’s arse cheeks and slide down to touch the stretched hole. “That’s a good boy, see… I knew you could do it. So tight for me.” John’s arse contracts at the touch and they both groan. The Dominus puts his hand on the flat of John’s back and holds him steady, rocking his hips slowly into John without really moving his cock in John’s arse.
The second bite is deeper, the Dominus locks his jaw and twists, tearing the skin of John’s shoulder and drawing a long low cry from John. It should hurt, and it does, but it also feels like the morphine injection he’d given himself on the field, if morphine felt like the aching burn of molten metal, like sparks from an anvil, or a volcano.
Home. Mycroft doesn’t do sentiment, even when he does. Sherlock hadn’t realized how much home sounds just exactly like John Watson’s name.
Please don't hate me that there is no porn here. This has been floating around in the back of my brain for literal years and I finally wrote it all down but what are tenses and it hasn't been beta'd or anything.
There'd have to be lube, maybe condoms, maybe not… he trusts you, you trust him… he'd have made you get tested… maybe he doesn't trust you, he probably shouldn't. Either way he's perfect, when you are inside him he's perfect and tight and it feels as though he was made for you.
Briefly, Sherlock had wondered if there had been some hearing damage, if John’s conversational fascinations were, not merely, but in part an attempt to read lips. John’s wound was never fully explained, perhaps there had been an explosion as well. The idea is quickly discarded, John doesn’t miss words when Sherlock turns his back, understands when Sherlock talks with his mouth covered or full of toast. In the end, it is much preferable to be able to watch John watching him, fascinating to catalogue John’s reactions, because over a long enough timeline John forgets that Sherlock is watching him back and just… watches, reacts and… licks his lips.
Murray smirks and shakes out the ball of clothing. “Where’d the button end up?” He hitches himself up onto one of the desks, angling to catch the little bit of light that makes it through the windows from the street.
Think about standing in front of him, about how good it would feel to look down and see him waiting there for you. Think about taking that final step forward, that moment when there is nothing else that could be happening between you. When he leans forward, and you reach down to card your fingers through his hair.
So you'd whisper in his ear while you touch him. Tell him how tight and wet he is, how good he makes you feel. "Are you close, John?"
you. Your body will let me in like I belong inside you, I will be a part of you… you will feel my loss as emptiness, accept me filling you as… but now you fight,
He’s still in his cage, but at least it is his cage and not some cryo recovery room on a mining colony.
John hums to himself, enjoying the little bursts of sensation along his nerves as his cock fills. “Are you finished?”
Another day perhaps he will hold Sherlock in his mouth, suck and lick and tease until Sherlock is hard again. He smiles as he lets Sherlock’s cock slide from between his lips, swallows hard and licks his lips, careful to catch any stray drops of Sherlock’s come and swallow them down.
John’s knees go a bit weak when Murray wraps his arms around John, rough fingers wrapping around John’s cock and pulling, sharp quick tugs, faster than the movements of his hips. Murray’s other hand covers John’s mouth, stifling the moans that John can’t bite back.
Sherlock bounds to his feet already digging in his pockets, searching for his mobile, the rug still over his shoulders. “He left me this way, how should I know how long it has been?”
John groans but rolls, tilting his arse up and trying to hold himself up on his elbows. He gives up when Murray slides into him and lets his upper body collapse onto the floor. If Murray wants to fuck him this way Murray can do the work of holding John’s body up. He sighs, letting the sensation of Murray fucking him become a warm background of pleasure that doesn’t require any action on his part to sustain or complete.
John blinks and lets his eyes adjust to the change in light. The cell is less cold and sterile now, seems almost comfortable… well if it wasn’t for the solid bars between him and Mrs. Hudson. “No. No pain, just tired.”
.” John looks down at the paper in his lap and huffs out a laugh. “You have...” The paper is straightened, the ruined landscape, unreadable, resumes its secondary nature as barrier to Sherlock’s gaze.
He pushes back and sighs as a tendril writhes its way over the curve of his arse and towards his hole. He wants it to be Sherlock, feels the tentacle thicken and curve to approximate the shape and width of Sherlock’s cock. He moans as the one in his mouth fills out as well, pushing against the back of his throat until he wants to gag on it. A smaller one winds around his cock, undulates in a way that might... if Sherlock ever… it might feel like Sherlock’s hand wrapped around him.
Which doesn’t actually happen for some time. He’s left to wait long enough that he considers calling out, wondering if the Dominus has forgotten about him. Or if he’s been left outside the wrong door. His eyes are drooping when the door opens and he recoils in surprise, stopping short of pulling on the chain.
The Dominus is standing beside the far wall, examining old fashioned paper clippings and maps pinned to the surface. John blinks and notices the slight flickering at the edges and realizes that they are just very detailed holograms. Normal people don’t bother with the coding required to personalize individual notes and just make due with the brightly coloured faux sticky notes that come as the default.
The knock on the door interrupted him, before a voice came through the wood. ‘I don’t care if you are, ahem, engaged in an intimate encounter with Victor Trevor but please, Sherlock, be silent. What if someone hears you?’
It felt good, when he said it, but as he trotted after Irene there was an ache in his heart that had not been there before. The mist cleared and he said aloud, ‘oh no.’
Irene laughed and grabbed the bottles before helping Sherlock up. The tall boy shook his curly head before plopping himself next to John, taking a bottle and pulling out the cork with his teeth. Janine huffed. ‘Why do you keep getting wine?’
Sherlock heard a sigh and smirked. He rarely managed to provoke his brother into a verbal reaction, and it always felt like a minor victory when he did. Why he had such an urge to annoy Mycroft…that was something Sherlock could not answer.
'It doesn't matter why you're here, John,' Sherlock said quietly. 'Just the fact that you are here is good enough for me. And I know, I know that there must be some motive and you're going to leave again but let me say, please let me say, that I have missed you more than I thought it was able to miss someone and I'm
‘Wha-‘ he said loudly, but the person clamped a hand over his mouth. ‘Shh,’ they hissed, and John’s eyes widened as he recognised the voice.
Sherlock ignored him. Instead, he looked at John, eyes conflicted, and all John wanted to do was say
John frowns because his son looks very serious, and he wonders if something’s wrong. ‘What is it, Nathaniel?’
Plus, Victor was at least ten times more arrogant than Sherlock, so that made everyone stop yelling at Sherlock for a bit.
John focused on the screen. The official announcer was reading out their names; John heard Olivia, a blonde woman with William’s smile, Paul, a man in his early thirties with messy black hair; Daniel and Lucas, identical twins with the same blue/green eyes as Sherlock; Isla, who couldn’t have been more than twenty-five and who had William’s sharp cheekbones, Annabelle, who was possibly only two or three years older than John, and Dean who, with his curly hair (albeit a lighter brown than Sherlock’s inky black), slender frame and wicked smile could have been Sherlock’s twin.
‘Suits you,’ Sherlock said, and then he turned on his heel and abruptly moved into the crowd. ‘Come.’
‘Dante James Watson-Holmes,’ Sherlock groaned as he picked up the picture of Irene and Violet; the glass was cracked across the screen. It had been taken two summers previously, when Irene, Benedict and Grace had come with John, Sherlock and their kids to Portugal for two weeks following Irene and Molly’s separation. Irene hadn't mentioned it once and had seemed her usual self; in fact, she still refused to mention it. No one was totally sure why they’d broken up, thought Sherlock had his suspicions.

Or at least understand what he truly meant when he said, ‘Your moustache looks and smells like an electrocuted weasel, Watson!’
It, the second from the top on Mycroft’s left side, was extended through one of the tailored apertures in Mycroft’s pyjama shirt; it turned the page.
Mycroft stood staring at what was left of the herb garden. He sighed and went back into the cottage, making certain to leave the dog door unfastened.
He took it all in, the room and its many furnishings, especially the hooks in the ceiling from which were suspended heavy weights and the knotted ropes laid out in neat display upon an antique sofa.
“…you could tell me what’s bothering you. It’s the friends part of the friends with benefits, the buddy part of the fuck buddy or, you know, just being a decent human being.”
“I was thinking two things: one, that it is a joy to fuck you in this way, every way, of course, but I had this way in mind; and two, that this is my division, not burglary, but buggery!”
It’s a test of something, John’s not certain what, that he meets Sherlock’s eye and does not flinch or look away or flee. He keeps his body, his expression, his voice as relaxed as he’s able while running this gauntlet.
“Too clever by half, you,” said Lestrade, smiling and licking his lips. “You’re working very late, too.”
“The fairy gardens were excellent, but even I have to concede the idea of nursery rhyme inspired tableaus is a bit precocious.”
“Hullo, Doctor Watson! I just wanted to show off the little one and say thank you. If it weren’t for you, little James wouldn’t be here!”
They had to stop halfway down the backstairs, but they did make the return journey to Baker Street without being booted from the cab for gross indecency.
“Dangerous is your cheekbones,” John sighed as he let himself be stroked to hardness. “Kiss me, you gorgeous git.”
As they traveled, Mycroft tried to work himself into a fury but only managed an odd confusion, which Lestrade’s stony, tight-lipped expression did nothing to remedy.
Mycroft had wasted no time in pressing the Detective Inspector’s back to the door and pressing his own lips against the Detective Inspector’s. He did not want give the impression that he was a hesitant lover.
“Yes, yes, I am becoming enlightened.” John tapped the paper in his hands. :I am on the section about ‘the high probability of transfer and retention’ comparing glitter and gunshot residue.”
I followed her instructions to the letter, and upon viewing the result, that good lady pronounced, without artifice, “Oh, well done, Doctor!”
“We’re standing beneath mistletoe, Detective Inspector. I’m going to set this colourful fellow over here and give you a thorough briefing on how I’d like my Christmas kiss.”

“Oh, don’t blame this on my arse!” roared John. “Shit, Sherlock, you’ve got it all over you! That means I have it all over me! Glitter is contagious! It’s like, like, like craft herpes.”
I had reached my conclusions by the seventh day of trial, when, by chance, my friend and fellow lodger, Doctor John Watson discovered me in mid-canter, so to speak. With his initial concerns quelled, he observed me on the device. I described the effects of the exercise and now I am under his personal care, following a physician prescribed and administered regimen that is, if not identical, quite similar in its stimulation of circulation and muscle use, but without drawbacks that would negatively impact my ability to meet the, notably unique, demands of my professional life.
“Glitter is highly individualistic. Compare it to, say, cotton fibres as trace evidence. Cotton fibres transfer, cotton fibres can be collected and analysed, but cotton fibres do not have their own signature, the way glitter does. The sample on the right is produced specifically for one establishment in London.”

After a long drive, we neared Embley-on-Wold, the crossroads of a village where my patient of the previous night resided.
Holmes knew precisely how to bring me to full stand, and he swiftly cycled through every technique of licking and sucking and teasing, of heat and wet and want, to achieve that aim.

“Come on, let’s go back to bed. I’ll feed them to you while I pound that sweet Irish hole some more.”
Sherlock pushed past loving licks to openly devouring John’s neck. He moved from one side to the other, registering the pressure of John’s chest to his own and the resulting dampness.
“Ah,” said Mycroft rolling onto his back and studying the ceiling. “It is a game. Some people bake. Some people make up Easter egg hunts for their archenemies using priceless works of art as prizes.”
Sherlock, taking his cue, rolled onto his back and began to perform: spreading his legs, twisting this way and that, slapping his buttocks, tweaking his nipples, and, eventually, dry humping his way across the bed.
John picked up the bee and laid it beside a prone Sherlock, saying softly, “I’m leaving behind a friend to keep you company while I make tea. If you don’t want him, just throw him down, and he won’t come back.”
He smiled, then kissed her. “You’re brilliant. We must toast to our new chapter, together and apart.”
“Yeah, whatever. He was found in this egg. The creature’s supposed to hatch out of it or something. That’s why he’s naked with all the makeup and stitches and whatnot. You know what, from a certain angle, he looks a lot like you.”
“Really,” I said, following up the first mild protest, “it’s been the best birthday I can remember. The lying-in and the waking-up were exquisite,” I shot Holmes a knowing glance, “and then luncheon fit for king in the very best company and a walk through the new exhibit in the very best solitude,” Holmes had had the rare foresight and thoughtfulness to spare me the aggravation of his crude commentary on modern art, “and an evening ramble. I really couldn’t ask for more, Holmes.”
Sherlock’s lips twitched in a half-smile as she eased John into her lap. Then she nuzzled at the side of John’s face and wrapped her arms protectively around her.
John slid his hands to Sherlock’s back, then cradled Sherlock to him as he let their tangle of tethered bodies flop back to the bed. He gripped Sherlock’s arse hard, and Sherlock whined.
Holmes groaned. “A few stray drops on my back ‘tis all. You owe me no apology, Watson. After a day spent attending patients and battling the elements, I expected you to return as stirred as the equinoctial gales without.”
“So do I! Hand me a flannel, Holmes. Then wash your face and your hair and put on a decent nightdress and come here,” I ordered, like a querulous nanny.
Smith was at the front of the crowd, he told him. He had been right next to the helicopter when it opened and the King stepped out.
John suppressed a snicker and Dick smiled widely. ‘Yeah, I know, but with a brother like Jim Moriarty you
‘So what are you required for?’ John asked, clearly not wanting to continue the conversation they had been having. Sherlock was surprised at the pang of disappointment that shot through him; did he have a subconscious desire to be painfully rejected? Clearly his self-destructive feelings had grown out of control again, he would have to have a word with his ‘assistant’ (his father had called the therapist his assistant for the first few sessions, thinking it would get Sherlock better used to the idea that he was a fucked up freak who had been shoved into therapy. It hadn’t) again. And possibly the doctor: maybe they’d all been right when they’d suggested Sherlock didn't come off his meds quite so soon.
‘I’m not going to be able to sleep anyway,’ John said, and Jenny nodded in agreement. Siger smiled, sniffing a bit. ‘In that case, any help would be appreciated. I’m going to the rooms by the exits: I’ve already done three, there are three more to do.’
John watched Sherlock sit down at the desk and his heart ached, ached with love for his brilliant, ridiculous partner. He closed his eyes, steadied and lifted the gun in his right hand. He took off safety, aimed and fired.
‘Yes,’ Mycroft said, rolling his eyes in a way almost identical to Sherlock, ‘you take precautions, but you are not careful enough. Both Trisha and I know-‘
‘No, Master Sherlock.’ The servant replied. ‘And she asks if you could bring Mr Watson with you also.’
It was the person he’d thought about every day for the last two years. His first thought in the morning, his last thought at night, and most thoughts in between. He’d imagined this moment so many times, in so many different ways-
‘Right,’ Irene said breezily. ‘Now that’s taken care of, I want this one.’ She took Molly’s arm and gently led her back to her armchair.
Sherlock became ‘that’ person for him almost immediately, even if he’s refused to accept it until right now, at the last possible moment, at the
‘Love.’ Mycroft sounded disgusted. ‘Love is the sole reason that humanity have disagreements. Without love there would be perfect harmony and everyone would be content.’
Sherlock stood up. ‘Maybe so,’ he said, perfectly composed, ‘but I am not going to listen to relationship advice from you, Philip. Unsuccessfully keeping your infidelity from your wife for three years has finally led to her seeking solace somewhere else; personally, I thought it would happen much faster. The baby is his, which you would know if you had paid even the
‘I’m going out,’ James whispers. ‘And when I return, I will make last night up to you.’ Sherlock finally turns around, staring into those violet eyes, the symbol of the
Why had John run off without letting Sherlock explain himself? Why had John ignored all Sherlock’s attempts to make contact for the next four months?
‘Je ne sais pas,’ Mike shrugged. Irene and Janine were far too caught up in each other to care, with Irene simply shrugging before putting her hand on Janine’s leg and laughing far too genuinely at some joke the Irish girl was telling.
John couldn't do anything to console his weeping friend: all he did was stay quiet and thank God that he hadn't died, that he hadn't left Sherlock in the state that Smith was in now. He was still here, and he was alive, and it didn't matter however injured he was because he knew that Sherlock wouldn't ever be like Smith was now.
‘Right,’ Sherlock replied, looking at John as if he was an absolute idiot. ‘Right. Cos that’s what I wanted you to think about at this moment.’
Sherlock grabbed his cap and jammed it on his curls. Victor raised an eyebrow. ‘What the fuck hat is that? Is it a tourist one?’
‘John hates the body parts,’ Sherlock said mournfully. ‘He freaks every time he comes to my house and finds a head in the fridge. I don't think he would come to this event with me if I gave him a body part. Maybe if I promised to stop acquiring body parts…’
Mycroft had refused to let Sherlock say that he was being knighted for ‘services to the royal family, in particular fucking the King’s older brother.’
‘I love you,’ Sherlock interrupted, and John was hit by that overwhelming, swelling feeling in his chest, and he gripped the back of his head, ignoring the pain, pulling Sherlock’s head towards his own so their foreheads were touching, and he looked right into his beautiful blue eyes and said it back, repeating those three words over and over. ‘I love you, I love you,’ they muttered together, and John felt pure and unadulterated happiness for the first time in forever-
No one could prove the rumours, though, and no one dared to speak out publicly against the beloved prince, but John decided to re-watch the statement that King William had given two days after the massacre. And this time…
. It was a tiny village, only ten or eleven huts, and John shouted, ‘Hunter, Smith, you take the North and West. Isaac and Becca-‘
person. His name is James- actually, his name isn’t important, what’s important is I helped him do some very bad things and became addicted to heroin- and cocaine, I suppose- while I was doing that. When I was fourteen, my brother put me in rehab: I started self-harming, I became depressed, without the drugs everything seemed…’ he waved his hands. ‘Bigger. Louder. Scarier. I met Irene there, you met her last week, she was in there for alcohol problems.’ Upon seeing John’s shocked lock, he laughed. ‘I know, you would never have guessed. Irene helped me get over those problems, but I was in rehab for over a year. I’d been accepted into Oxford before I went into rehab, but I wanted a change in scenery, so I applied to Corpus Christi College, and the rest is history.’
Or, maybe, it’s because he’d experienced it before over the past seventy-five years, exactly six times. Firstly for his father, with dysentery; then Hadrian, with smallpox. His mother, Lila, Peyton and Cedany had all been struck with the influenza: and now, finally, Asher. Unlike the others, Asher had lived to the point where it is no longer disease but decay of the body that kills: that explains, Sherlock thinks, as he stares out of his window for the horse he knows will arrive, why he didn’t feel any symptoms as he had with the others. The bond between the
Sherlock, who had been preparing to dismiss the waiter, perked up at the insult of his brother. ‘The groom?’
John was distracted by Henry pointing excitedly at the television and saying loudly, ‘they’re going!’
John didn’t say anything, though as he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, he had the same thought that he did every time he saw the Prince on television.
The brown haired boy laughed, before slipping his arm around Sherlock’s waist and drawing him towards him. ‘I’ve got to go, babe,’ he whispered, and Sherlock nodded. ‘Understandable.’
if his dick wasn’t already rock hard from Hamish’s movements, even through four layers of clothing, and as if he was reading his thoughts Hamish was unbuttoning his dress trousers, reaching into his boxers and gripping his throbbing cock, moving it against his own (
), sniffing at his brother. ‘I’ve already promised to make you the British Government when I become King.’
John didn't reply, just held on tighter, and the two boys sat together as a crowd gathered around them, holding onto each other to keep from drowning.
Sometimes, he wished he didn’t see everything. It was extremely disorientating and had been what originally got him into drugs.
Sherlock had been horrified; the thought of two miniature Mycroft’s running around scared him to the point of indigestion. However the empire had been thrilled; royal babies fever had scooped the kingdom. It received far more coverage than Archie’s birth, or William’s remarriage, or even the whole secrets thing with James. It was, the Times calculated, second only to the death of Queen Violet, Sherlock’s mother, in terms of scale.
Nathaniel smiles then, a bittersweet smile, and John realises with a jolt that he’s now seven years older than Sherlock was when he died. ‘I couldn't have asked for a better father, Papa.
As he gently removes the stolen memory stick from his pocket, he remembers what John said to him, earlier in the week.
‘You know Greg,’ Mycroft said, looking embarrassed. John frowned, trying to place the name, before gasping. ‘
He meets Mary, a nice, clever woman, and they move in together about a year and a half after Sherlock jumps. He can barely remember what the thrill feels like and he doesn't even feel like he needs it: everything is normal. For the first time in his life, John is
The door had opened and a chauffeur had stepped through the door, opened it widely, and then she had walked in.
Why had John told himself it was the right decision, over and over, when the phone calls and text messages had stopped?
That’s a lie.’ Sherlock blushed furiously and avoided eye contact. ‘John, I need to ask you something-‘
‘Don’t contact me,’ John said. ‘Don’t come after me. Have a good life, Sherlock Holmes, with your little murdering whore.’
They walked in near silence; Hunter and Smith were whispering to each other at the back of the group, hands constantly brushing against each other, whilst Isaac was tramping ahead, and Becca was walking next to John. He didn’t want to say anything to anyone, least of all her; he was still worried sick about the photo, and whether anyone had seen it.
The moment Harry saw the third bedroom she went back into the second and loudly exclaimed, ‘This one is mine.’ John, who didn't want any conflict, just shrugged and dumped his suitcase on the bed.
‘But he loves you. Whether it is platonically or romantically is the question.’ Mycroft looked quickly at Sherlock and Sherlock felt himself grow even hotter. ‘You must decide whether you are going to take a risk, or if you are going to leave it and never know what might have been.’
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘Mycroft has too many secrets. I, personally, cannot believe he invited Lady Smallwood.’ The middle-aged woman sitting next to her husband on one of the back tables was laughing, though her eyes had been fixed on Sherlock’s brother for the majority of the reception. ‘Her husband would kill him, and so would Graham-‘
But Sherlock was staring at him with those big wide eyes and right then John would have stolen Sherlock the moon, if that was what would make him happy
‘Sorry,’ John whispered, now hovering by the door and staring in horror at Sherlock’s rapidly retreating figure as it cut towards the waiting room, a million thoughts pushing for dominance at the front of his brain.
There was no way in hell Sherlock was going to ask him, he needed to do something big and brilliant so John would actually agree. He had a feeling John would dislike the body parts and the poem was apparently so shit it made Mike Stamford feel physically sick, so that was out as well. The cookies was too much of a hazard to redo (Sherlock wanted to be
‘That’s it,’ Ella said urgently, guiding Lila’s feet into the stirrups. ‘Come on, girl. Almost there.’
John waited for Sherlock to say something in retaliation but there was simply silence. Eventually Morag said, annoyance evident in her tone, ‘I had to do it, William-‘
‘What are they?’ Innocent little Yakob asked. John stayed quiet, even though he knew what they were better than anyone else in the room, because his sister had whispered to him that she was one a few nights before and that she was going out with a girl called Clara from her school. ‘Dunno.’
Sherlock just nodded and looked down, a single tear dripping to the ground. ‘I’m sorry. I understand if you want to-‘
His gaze softens, and he pulls John up, though he’s still a good six inches taller than him. ‘You’re the only one who calls me that. Most people call me Nat, though Lizzie still calls me Natty-‘
‘God, Sherlock, nobody’s touched this pretty little hole since me, have they?’ James said. Although he still sounded composed his breathing was ragged and his eyes glinted with lust, and Sherlock knew that he was the only one who could do this to James Moriarty and even now, over two and a half years later, he loved it.
‘Brother mine.’ Mycroft materialised next to him, frowning as usual. ‘Nice to see you alone, for once.’
‘Shut up.’ Irene playfully punched John in the shoulder, but her heart wasn't in it and she sighed. ‘She says that she won’t do anything but I’m not sure. Like, she’s not gay, she’s only sixteen and she’s a bit of a slag.’
And that was pretty much it for eight hours. Four o’clock became five, and six, and seven, and so on until John was pretty sure if a baby didn’t arrive shortly he’d have to collapse in the chair Ella had been in when they arrived. Now, however, she was up and looking alert, standing next to Lila, who was finally (
‘Thirteenth,’ Lestrade supplied, adding when Sherlock raised an eyebrow, ‘of May. Don’t you have exams starting in three days?’
‘I didn't know you had feelings for me until you kissed me, Sherlock,’ John replied. ‘Even when you said you’d come with me as my date, I thought it was just a joke. I’d always thought you’d had a thing for Jim-‘
Rosie squealed, and Greg covered his ears with both hands. ‘Is it happening? Papa, Dad, am I going to be a big sister?!’ She sprung to her feet, clapping her hands ecstatically (numbly, it occurred to John that his daughter should not be dancing around a corpse, but it was not the time to correct her behaviour). ‘Right.’ He took Sherlock’s phone, scrolling through the message quickly, and then nodded.
‘I’m not going to bow.’ John’s father said, and Sherlock’s heart sank. The man was glaring at him so hard Sherlock could almost feel it, cutting into him like-
‘Yes.’ Charlotte acknowledged, dropping the subject, though she was looking at Sherlock with narrowed eyes. ‘I am. Lucy’s teething and her screams keep the entire castle awake.’ Charlotte lived with her youngest son, Zachariah, who was now fifty-three, and his three children. Sherlock hated them; they were insufferable, especially the toddler, who never seemed to stop crying.
‘Holmes?’ The older girl said from the sofa. She was now glaring at Sherlock, who sighed. He'd let his guard down when he'd realised that Mrs Watson didn't instantly hate him: he'd forgotten about the less impressed members of John's family.
'None,' Jenny sniffed. 'He'd been at the address on Wednesday and on the Friday...' she dissolved into a fresh round of tears and John closed his eyes, remembering. It had been just three days before (
‘She knows who I am,’ John’s father said confidently, and he took off his cap and smiled at John. ‘Hey, Jenny. John.’
Sherlock pouted and redid the button up. Sex was pointless, of course, another malfunction of his transport, but Sherlock actually liked it. His mind was at its best post-orgasm and it was also good for keeping up appearances; if the servants saw Irene sneaking out of his room at three in the morning they wouldn’t think their King was a freak who had no interest in sexual matters.
John, who had one hand cupping his head and one hand on his waist. John, who had to stand on tiptoes to reach Sherlock’s lips. John, who Sherlock loved more than anybody on the planet, John who had helped Sherlock in ways he couldn’t ever imagine, John who Sherlock wanted to spend every moment of forever with.
John jumped, jolting his shoulder, before trying to turn over, seeking that voice, that voice he recognised even when it was cracked and hoarse and worried, scarcely daring to believe it. ‘Sherlock?’ He managed to roll over, ignoring the burst of pain in his shoulder, and suddenly it was worth it, all of it. Suffering alone for eighteen months, watching his friend die, even getting shot, because Sherlock was there, sitting next to him, staring into his eyes looking
‘You’re a bad influence,’ Mycroft said as if it wasn't the most obvious statement in the entire world. ‘I don't know why we let you see them.’
‘What’s the magic word, Chris?’ John said gently. Christopher and Sherlock fixed John with equalled stares of disgust. ‘It’s Christopher!’ Sherlock said at the exact same time as Christopher remarked, ‘please struggle onto the last two syllables, Papa.
His mother shrugged. ‘That’s what happens, darling. It’s all a part of growing up. You’ll know all about it, soon.’
‘Hmm?’ His husband (Sherlock still couldn’t believe that, sometimes) said, smiling down at him, Sherlock’s personal sun, and Sherlock smiled back and said, ‘have I ever told you that I love you?’
John had no idea what she was doing but went along with it, partially because now everyone was looking and partially because she might have been a lesbian who clearly had no urge to sleep with him, but Irene was a
James didn’t move, watching Sherlock as he frantically pulled on his black shirt and slacks, slipping his feet into his shoes. It was only as Sherlock put his hand on the door handle that James said in the same flat tone as John, ‘if you leave now, Sherlock, you’re choosing him.’
His mother’s face when she saw all the people and costumes and floats reinforced this definition quite definitely in John’s mind, especially when she tugged on his father’s shirt and whispered, ‘Let’s go another way, Henry.’
‘They’re about to come out.’ Harry whispered, shooting a look at John, who ignored her completely. It was the first time he was going to see Sherlock’s face in almost a year and a half.
his reputation because hell, John had wanted to kiss Sherlock all holiday (and for at least a year before that) and he was drunk. It was a brilliant,
John snorted, finally opening his eyes, and Sherlock was captivated instantly. People went on and on about Sherlock’s eyes, claiming they were mystical orbs or mysterious pools, but John’s were twice as stunning. They were a pure, simple blue that didn’t confuse you, or seem mysterious; they were plain and beautiful.
Jim had already gotten his cock out and was steadily pumping it, rubbing his thumb lightly around the head, sometimes grazing the edge of Sherlock’s slit and if he had been in any condition to talk he would have been begging James for more, for less, for anything that would bring him relief-
Sherlock sighed and looked at the ground. ‘I’m thinking I just might not ask him, Myc. I see no way in which he would agree to come with me and I prefer not to be massively humiliated in front of people.’
sweeter, and John fell in love all over again, as he kissed Sherlock’s lips and touched his hand to Sherlock’s cheek-
‘Girlfriend,’ Mycroft said, the word bitter in his mouth, ‘must stay in here. I shall go out, but that is all.’
