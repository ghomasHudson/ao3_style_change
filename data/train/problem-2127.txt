The first few bullets ricocheted off the reinforced cab.
John draped his arm across his eyes. As he finger-fucked him, Sherlock conducted an orchestra of bitten-off wails and liquid, slippery sounds. John’s desire created an Omega scent visible to Sherlock as a glowing, pulsing aura. He knew his own was similarly visible to John. They couldn’t hide from each other now, if they ever could. Sherlock withdrew his fingers and pressed in a fourth alongside the others.
“Of course not, John.” Sherlock fiddled with his phone.  “Drake plays cricket. You can tell by how misshapen his fingers are.”  He paused for a moment.  “Ah, Mycroft,” Sherlock said into his phone as he walked through into the kitchen.
“Stevie Wonder,” John replied.  “One of my favourites.  Course, this track is called ‘Superwoman’, which isn’t even remotely apt.  Very bitter and twisted, but a pretty tune.”
“Of course,” John grumbled. He leant forward and put his forehead to his knees. Sherlock bent over and started to smooth the liquid over John’s hair. He worked it into bubbles and massaged John’s scalp with his fingers. “God, that feels nice.” Sherlock carried on washing. He used the lather to rub the tense muscles in John’s neck and then shoulders. “Fuck me, if you’re trying to seduce me, you’ve already done it. Not that you’re getting anything tonight, boy-o.”
“That’s a bit dull.”
“God, John,” he said against John’s neck. “It’s almost too much.”
and between John’s legs. John spread his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, rested his head on Sherlock’s and waited. Sherlock didn’t know when his sobs stopped. He cried for his sister. He cried for Mycroft. He cried for his parents. He cried for John and for Rosie, who could have so easily ended up without him. And he cried because John warned him and Sherlock did not listen, ever drawn to the darkness.
A tricksy chapter this one, and I hope Dr Watson's wobble is understandable. Though many Sherlock fans are not big fans of Mary, John was seemingly in love with her. Therefore, much as the desire to just write her out of John's history is tempting for many, I found that had to deal with her and their relationship quite early on. This is part of that. So, bare with me.
“Are you leaving?” Sherlock asked. “I mean, are you telling me we’re never going to have sex again? Or you’re leaving?”
“I want you to eat a banana and drink your tea.” John lined up the fake cock against his arse. “By the time you’re done, I’ll be ready for you.”  John sank back on the dildo with a long sigh.
“He’s straight.”
“Not today, hmm?”  John replied.  “Um, Sherlock, can I have a word?”   John stood and led Sherlock out of the office.   “I’m not sure I should be here.  Charles is a slippery bastard. He’ll use me to worm his way out of answering every single question.  You’d be better interviewing him alone.”
Silence descended.
“If you look out of the window,” Mycroft said. “You’ll see that your assailant has been captured.”
“I could order take-away?”  Sherlock suggested.  “Or go pick up food?”
“Keeps dropping it,” Sharan replied.  Several shots were fired. Sharan risked another look. “No way! There are blokes coming down from the helicopters on ropes.”
This wasn’t the first time Sherlock had thought about John’s sex life.  Male sexual preferences were fairly consistent, and, as far as he’d seen, John never exhibited any tell-tale sights of an indulgence in S&M or other fetishes. The most risqué thing Sherlock had deduced about John was from his gait one morning following a night spent with Mary prior to the wedding.   Yes, his walk that day had made Sherlock excuse himself to escape down to the basement on some pretext or other. He’d pressed himself against the cool, damp wall and relieved himself with brusque efficiency.
Sherlock looked down at his come-streaked chest, glistering
“Sherlock!” John giggled. “What have you done to me?” Sherlock dropped onto his side and John tipped over to face him. “Madman.”
“We’re in the kitchen, Sherlock,” John said. He rolled his eyes, even though his lips betrayed his amusement. “It’s unhygienic and I’ve already got plenty to mop-up.” He motioned to the disreputable kitchen floor. “Get your gorgeous arse up and help me clean up. Then we can prep your bedroom, or mine, so you can do and see what you want.”
“Then the Englishman and the doctor and his daughter will stay at home instead. SH”
“Fine,” Sherlock said.  John sat down next to him and Sherlock moved in for a kiss.  “We can do kissing, right?”
“Unacceptable. You can look after Rosie. You’re family. SH”
“I’ve arranged for a cash in transit service to come and collect it and transfer it to Coutts. They will then arrange a bank transfer to your account.  The courier will give you the password ‘Lavender’.  I’ll text you his name, registration number and ID number in the morning when the job is allocated.”
Sherlock sat back. He was on his knees, John was on his back before him, his legs draped over Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock grabbed the lube with slick fingers and immediately sent it flying. John caught the bottle and smiled.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, desperate for more: more kisses, more friction, more Sherlock.
“But-” Sherlock almost bounced in his seat in the effort to butt into the conversation.
Sherlock rocked hips forward a bit and lifted his legs so they bent at the knee.  John lubed up his fingers and dipped them between the cheeks of Sherlock’s arse. At first, he gently rubbed his entrance and tapped gently at the pucker.  When Sherlock relaxed, he pushed the tip of his finger in.
“Evora,” Sherlock correct.  The woman smiled fatuously. Sherlock assumed she was important. Rosie sniffed and pulled a face.
He watched John dampen some cotton wool.
“I made that complaint on the understanding you would be discrete,” Sherlock said. He winked at John.
Without a word, John handed over the soap. Sherlock put the bar down and washed John’s hair. He picked up the soap again after and washed him little by little. On the way, he discovered John liked to have Sherlock’s lips on the dusky bud of his arsehole and on the soft skin of his balls.
“Do you wish I was a woman?” Sherlock asked. It was one of those knee-jerk questions that he’d never wanted to ask. A fairly dull pair of pale blue lacy knickers had forced it out of him.
“Trousers, Sherlock, please.”  John’s voice was breathy.  Sherlock slipped from John’s lap down, off the bed and onto his knees.
Apologies to all Scottish people for mauling their accent. I'd love to say this is the only time it'll happen but that would be a lie.
“The rubbing off.”
To all of those who are currently snowed to the eaves in the UK, stay warm and safe. I know it must seem like an over-reaction to those who are used to snow, but we're really not geared up to deal with as much snow as we've had because it's pretty rare.  My tip for the day to feel a bit warmer is to light some candles (safely!). I don't know if it does anything, but it always makes me feel a bit toastier to have a few lit candles around.
Sherlock did not verbally reply. He simply looked at his erection and at John’s, then raised an eyebrow.
“Now, I did just want to speak to you about Sherlock,” Mycroft began.  “Has he spoken to you about your favourite rent boy?”
The Tech smiled. “Let me see if I can get one of the nicer nurses to look after Rosie, eh?”
John pulled a face. He didn’t need to be told that the Holmes’ had a lack of emotional intelligence.   “That’s lovely, but what are we going to do?”
“Well, of all the people I thought I would see here, Dr Watson, you weren’t on the list.”
“When you’re ready, I’ll listen.”  I see the tightness around his eyes.  He looks so tired.  “Do you have a headache again?”
“I do feel the same way.”  I whisper impulsively as I take his hand.  I am torn between elation and fear.  It is my turn to stutter and blunder.  “But after what happened, out there, while I was away.  I’m not sure if… how I will cope with things… if you want it to be physical between us, I’m not sure if I can.  I’m scared of how I might react.”
I follow him; of course, I do.  I always follow him.  But only once the kettle has boiled.  I take a cup for myself too.  Who knows what chaos he is creating up there?
I chuckle politely.  If only she knew how much trouble I manage to find in the average week.
I grab his beer off the table and sip at it while I wait for him.  He comes back with his medical kit and takes his drink back, takes a swallow and then passes it back to me.
“I bet that keeps you out of trouble.”
“I can’t.”  He says, shaking his head.  The words seem to stick in this throat.  “Not now.”
“You off to bed?”  He asks.
Rosie comes tearing back in with a book in her hands.  She plonks down in my lap and says “read” in a clear demanding voice.  So, I read out loud from the Wonky Donkey as John takes the stitches out and we share his beer.  I feel his fingertips linger on my scalp.  I know that they have found a scar that is not new.  He moves on silently to the next set of stiches.
“I’ve been thinking about all the things that were said.  I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it all.  How I said that I needed to work out the feelings that I have… about you.  Well, I umm… I do care about you.  In fact, I care very much.  Probably more than it is normal to care for a friend.”
“Ok, I’ll bite.  Why?”
“Even this is… confronting.”  I gesture to indicate our position, causing him to withdraw instantly, leaving just his hand on my side.  The cold air between us feels worse than his presence did, but I cannot tell him since I just sent him away.  I scrunch my eyes closed and continue as best I can.  “Wet kisses and all the sounds and smells associated with sex are triggers.  There is so much I don’t remember clearly that there might be other things that I don’t handle well.  I’m really not sure if I’ll handle anything well.”
“No,” he snaps, there is a hint of panic in his voice, “don’t let that happen.  I am on my way.”
few more moments, but there
“Unless he is threatened.”  I wish Mycroft would stop with the questions.
“Thanks, John.  He is lucky you were there.  I shudder to think….”
“Let’s assume that he doesn’t have a serious head injury for a moment.  What would the ideal response look like?”
I am not surprised by his refusal.  Nor hurt.  I expected little else.  He is so rarely interested in his own pleasure.  I will never be sure whether it is the disinterest in sex that he has always claimed, or a residual symptom of the abuse he suffered in Serbia that makes him refuse.  He is still an enigma to me, even after all these years.  It would be unfair to pry though.  He gives me more of himself than he gives to anyone else.  To ask for more would be simply rude and I fear it would drive him away, make him even more reluctant to participate.
“Yep.”
“The water, they, did they?”  He pauses to collect himself.  “Waterboarding, is that what they did to you?”
“I don’t know exactly.  I went there to grab my iPad and heard a commotion.  I went into Sherlock’s room and this guy was sitting on him and throttling him.  He was trying to bash his head in with one of those heavy security torches.”  I suddenly feel shaken by the whole ordeal.
“You were serious about that?”
“No, it’s fine.”  I say, sitting across from him.  “Go ahead.”
“Often?”
“How else could her pants get so stretched?  All day she was pulling them back up.  The elastic must be shot.”
The process is arduous though, I don’t understand why I am so tired.  I try to sleep again and now the nurse only wakes me up every hour.  When she notices that I can’t sleep, she offers to clean me up a bit.  I decline her offer even though I know that there is still blood in my hair.  Not just blood either; there are small chunks that I suspect are brain matter.  I remember the panic that I felt when the nurse in Montenegro washed my hair; I don’t think I can do that right now.  I ask her to leave.
I try
More talking.  Soothing voice.  I don’t trust
“Do you always think about me all night?”  His voice is as teasing as the light touches that circle my slit.
“What is the last thing you remember?”  He asks back.
It's a whopper by my standards and I probably should have chopped it in half, but you, my beautiful souls, deserve it in full as thanks for your patience.
“This is not the right answer.”  My voice sounds tight and I stop myself.  My instinct is to shout, to shake him, to tell him how stupid this is.  To remind him of where this ridiculous habit has led him in the past.  But he looks so desperate.  I start again.  I try to keep my voice as soft as I can.  “You can talk to me.  Tell me what’s going on?  Is this about the other night?  There is more to it, isn’t there?”
“It’s ok.  It doesn’t matter, it’s ok if we never do anything.”  He says, clearly alarmed at my list of limits, then he continues hesitantly.  “I shouldn’t have asked.”
“I was very, damn it, important.”
“Did you love her for her vagina?”  Clara asks point blank.  It is my turn to be surprised by her personal point-blank question.
No, I’m clean.  Worked at
think about
Since he started.  That is the key.   He wasn’t born fully formed.  None of them are.  He didn’t start with this.  No one just begins with home invasions that are motivated by rape and violence.  Sure, he takes some valuables but that is not what he is all about.  It is about the killing and the sexual assaults.  Something must have come first.  That’s the key to this; to finding him.
Smell makes me nauseous.  I’m not usually bothered by
“Sounds like your back to your old self.”
“I don’t think I will ever be ready.”
Eyes shut I search for the hem of his nightshirt.  The distraction of his mouth freeing my hands to move.
“Thank you, John.”  He says with a sincerity that is unusual to him.  “You have helped me to understand what is going on here?”
“Gifts from a friend.”
“I’m here.”  John said.  “I’ll always be here.  I’ll always come if you’re in trouble.”
She does, but I’m sure I will cope.
“Sherlock.”  I say to get his attention.  The wounded glace he shoots towards me cuts deeply.  “The letter, is it from the Serbian man, the one who assaulted you?”
More movement.  Different
“Well no,” I admit, “but we all know that this isn’t about the thefts, and, more importantly, if he thinks that I am after him, he might come here.”
“Did I keep you up all night?”  I ask him as I burrow back into the pillows.  He looks tired.  I am worried that I disturbed him as I tried to escape more haunting dreams.
She smiles at me.  “Walking is a great strategy; do you find it helpful?”
“No history of…”  I begin.
He runs his left hand along my right arm, the one closest to where he kneels beside me.  I tense at the soft touch.
“No, he is usually… gentle.”  I am a bit surprised by the truth of my own answer; I have never considered Sherlock as gentle until the words were out of my mouth.
“How is he?”  He asks nodding towards Sherlock.  He looks understandably worried.
“I know but it is practically an invitation when they print it like that.”  John says with more than a hint of frustration.
He props himself up on an elbow.  Looks at me seriously.  When he speaks, I hear self-doubt and fear and a tinge of cheeky hope.  “Do you want me to, you know?”
He takes a gulp of beer, then kisses me again.  I can taste the beer on his lips this time.  He breaks off and stands up, leaving me slightly logy.
what has my arm trapped.  I don’t want them near my neck.  Or over my arms.
Then he stops again.  Hand one hand still around me, the other playfully trying to keep my hips from jerking up.  “I really feel like you have more to say.  I don’t think you are expressing yourself to your fullest capacity.
Mechanically he takes them, and I sit across from him while he finishes his drink.  His hands are shaking.  I have never seen him like this before.  Never so quiet and introspective.  It scares me.
“Please, John is fine, otherwise I feel like I’m at work.”  I say lightly.  My nerves are allayed almost immediately by her gentle nature and bright smile.
I return to him balancing a glass of water, his pain medication, and the sleeping pills I picked up at lunchtime.  He needs to rest.  I had anticipated the exhaustion and after the debacle the other night with the Nytol, I took it upon myself to fill a prescription for Zolpidem.  I’m hoping that is can him enough that he can get a good night’s rest.
“What’s happened, is it Harry?”  She asks.
I turn to shove the plate in front of him.  He is flipping through the paperwork that I deposited on the table as I come in.
John woke with the first stream of light coming through his window.  He woke feeling warm and satisfied in the way you only can when there is no alarm to force you out of bed; when there is no need to rush.  He could hear the rain battering the window.  His mouth was dry and his head fuzzy, not a headache yet, just the threat of it.
I grope for my phone in the dark and hit the speed dial for Lestrade.
“We have plenty of money”.  He mumbles, and I envy his ability to stay in bed.
“Did he leave you?”
Only moments after we say goodbye my phone buzzes with a text message; it is the number Clara promised me.
I nod.
He turns to Sherlock.  He is professional and calm as he introduces himself to Sherlock again.  “Hi there.”  He says touching Sherlock on his right forearm to get his attention.  I’m Doctor Pawson, I’m one of the doctors looking after you.  Can you open your eyes?”
About a week after John moves back in, I am staring at the crystals I have set up under my microscope when he says something to me.  The crystals are from a new formula I have been trying out; sodium magnesium oxalato aluminate.  They should come out perfectly clear and neatly geometric but the formula is twitchy and so far, I am not having much success.  John says something else, I must filter it into background noise, because I don’t process what he says.  None of us slept well last night.  Rosie had been cranky all day yesterday and she woke up in the night with a fever.  This seems to add to the tension that has been slowly building for days.  Something is bothering John; something I cannot quiet recognise.
I wake to the silence in a cold sweat with my skin crawling.  I kick the blankets free before I can control myself.
I flop down in my chair and open the letter.
“Doesn’t everyone?”  I ask, confused.
“Sure, fine.”  I reply, also conscious of keeping quiet so as to not wake Rosie.
While John is taking care of Rosie, I check my phone.  I want to know what I said to John earlier.
John promises to come back in the morning.  Hesitating at the door as if he means to say something, but he just says goodbye and smiles.
“It’s really not that bad.”
John and I are happy and content here.  We still bicker sometimes.  During our most mild winter to date, I spend a night watching the hives.  A small number of Acherontia Atropos have finally come to our hives to steal some honey from the bees.  I had planted a whole field of potatoes in hope of encouraging them to reproduce here.  The five beautifully marked individuals that flutter into and out of hive number four are enough to keep me riveted in place all night.  I jot notes in my book about their exact descriptions, how frequently they come and go, how long they spend inside the hive and what time they leave.
Mycroft leans over Sherlock, he pulls the collar of the hospital gown away from this bruised throat.  Then he makes sure that none of the iv lines are tangled or lay across Sherlock’s arms.  He slips the sling off Sherlock left arm and folds the blankets down until they are low on his hips.
“That didn’t get you out of this you know.”  I warn him.
I don’t tell them.  Hurting me when I don’t follow their instructions.
“I’m scared I will, Clara.”  My voice shakes with my admission.
He massages my shoulders.  Smoothing his hands along the length of my muscles.  His touch is firm and confident.  I know he must feel the scar tissue that mars the surface of my back.  Many of the scars are barely visible but touch will alert him to much more of the damage that was done.
John looks out for the town’s folk by doing house calls.  He is usually home by lunchtime.  He is writing a book in his spare time, but he won’t let me read any of it just yet.
His legs squeeze around me, his knees over my ankles pulling them down and apart, holding me in place against him.
“Just a bit of mist.  It’s morning dew mostly.”
I wrinkle my nose.  The thought of curry makes my stomach roll.
After a monotonous half day at work, I pick up Rosie and we stop by our place to pick up a few more things.  She is grizzles as put her in her playpen; holding her little arms up, wanting me to pick her up again.  I suspect that she is both grumpy and tired after a morning session at day care.  I distract her with my iPad.  The upbeat music and songs I reluctantly know all the words to form an odd soundtrack as I race around throwing things in a bag.  I am impatient to get back to Baker Street.  It seems that I don’t want to be away from there for even a moment.  The offer to move back in permanently came as a welcome relief but in a fashion that is so typically Sherlock.  He did not seem concerned with any of the details.  Just brushing it off when I asked how much the rent would be, and where Rosie should sleep and how we would child proof the rooms and if I should sell my place.
“I didn’t know how.  I was embarrassed, ashamed of what happened.  Scared of what you would think of me.”  He admits.  “Who I am, who everyone thinks I am, it is all just because of their perception.  I couldn’t bare for that to change.”
“You stress me out, Sherlock Holmes.”
“You did this on purpose, didn’t you?”  He is angry now that he has realised.  “You rang the papers, you are using yourself as bait to catch him, aren’t you?”
There are two.
“Please.”
“Open your eyes for me.”  Again, he squeezes his thumb nail, this time holding Sherlock’s wrist gently to prevent him from pulling his hand away.  He squirms trying to get his arm free.  Sherlock mumbles something.  It sounds a bit like go away or maybe no way.  It’s hard to tell.
I take the syringe from between his fingers.  To my relief he lets it go without any resistance.  I let out a breath as I take it with me to the bathroom.  The contents I squirt down the drain, the needle goes into my sharps container.
“You’re a bloody mad man.  You are enough to turn me grey.  I’ll have a unit swing by from time to time.  Keep your phone close and ring the minute you hear anything, alright?”
“You don’t even charge for most of them.”  I scoff.  I get up and pull my dressing gown on.  The floor is freezing against my feet.
The next night he does not bother to come down, he just rings my phone and when I answer he mumbles, “come up.”
They must have.
When he is happy with the arrangement he starts talking.  I expect him to lower his voice.  To talk in a soft tone, the way most people do in hospital settings, but he sounds just as he normally does.
Copper.
“We will get it all cleared up, but we are going to need a statement from Sherlock too.  When he is well enough, of course.”
We are almost the same height when we are sitting down.  He reaches over to me, his hand on the back of my neck, his thumb brushing the back of my ear.  His movements are slow and careful, and I try hard not to tense up.  I look to him and see the worry and doubt in his eyes.
Then I realise the one important thing.  Right now, none of it matters.
“Have two argued in the past?”
I take a deep breath, knowing how much he resists my nagging, but…  “Sherlock.  You need to me more careful.  I don’t want to lose you.”
I have sent Mrs Hudson away.  I gave her a few nights at a nice little place by the beach.  Somehow the apartment seems to be quieter than normal, too silent, but I couldn’t stand the risk of having her here.
I pause because I know what I am about to say will change everything.  I know that every time John looks at me, he will know that Rimac put his filthy hands all over me.  I know John will refute it, say it doesn’t change anything, but I also know that that can’t be true.  I have already changed things, already set wheels into motion that cannot be stopped
I’m too wrapped in the warm haze of sleep to reply so I just shrug a little.
Except I do.  It is too close to home.  The whole case makes me uncomfortable.  The things that happened to me in the shithole military base in Serbia have changed my perspective.  Even after all this time I cannot work sexual assault cases objectively.
I check the fridge and find that Mrs Hudson has left us a plate each.  That woman deserves a medal.  I heat up the casserole.  The soft fluffy dumplings are one of my favourites and it smells divine.
It is then that I realise that John has held an aura of tension these past few days.  I had been so caught up in my own revelations and with feeling discombobulated that I had not stopped to notice.  There is something that he needs to say.  I know that with instant clarity.
the words.  Too many people.
“Not reluctant, just checking.  You know?  After everything you have told me tonight, I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.”  I’m not sure if my denial of reluctance is entirely truthful.
I hope it is
“Did you…”  the words stick in my throat, “ask for me?”
I move through the haze that has become my life.  He moves to pull the blankets up over me.  I stop him with a firm grip on his wrist.  I can’t handle being covered up, not past the waist.  Not since I couldn’t get free of the blankets.
“It is a standard Glasgow Coma Scale.  There is a basic scale for eye response, motor response and verbal response.  Each is marked, depending on the level of response.  Basically, all he needs to do is stay calm long enough for the doctors to assess whether and how well he can follow the basic instructions.  At the moment it is impossible to tell whether the problem is neurological.”
“Do you think there is a chance you might repeat what happened?”
“He is, he keeps unsociable hours, has no concept of privacy, has no verbal filter.  He lives at a million kilometres an hour or doesn’t get off the sofa for days.  Living with him is madness.”
“Sorry, sorry, I—“ but he was cut off by the detective’s lips, warm, pliant, once again moving against his, fingers moving in his hair, over his jaw, ankles that had locked around the back of his calves as he stood against the exam table, pulling him close, allowing no escape, no hesitation, no doubt.
“Oooh, hello, sweetheart! John, why don’t you go up to see Sherlock and let me keep her for awhile?”
The train was unusually timely and in a stroke of luck it coincided with Rosie’s usual nap time. The gentle rocking soothed everyone and John dozed as he held her. After an hour, he passed her off to Sherlock while he stretched and used the loo. He returned to their seats, ready to make an acerbic comment about the manners of another passenger when the sight of his dearest friend pressing a cheek to his sleeping daughter’s head erased all negative thoughts from his mind. A tingling warmth filled him from toes to fingertips and he swallowed past the golf ball in his throat. Sherlock looked up, his eyes open and affectionate, a half-smile gracing his features.
“You have no idea,” he responded. Rosie chose that moment to throw a crayon into the kitchen with a frustrated cry. They both pulled apart, still clinging to eachothers’ hands, laughing.
“You mean after tonight?” His tone was cautiously neutral. He was stalling. He knew exactly what I was asking.
“Oh, John, Sherlock has stocked my cabinets with baby food, I’ll be happy to feed her.” John stood stock still for a moment, cocking his head in an excellent impersonation of a curious retriever.
“Thank God, thank god, John. I couldn’t have lost you, too.” John grasped the lapels of his friend’s jacket, vibrating with chills. Later, after the worst of the cold had stopped wracking John’s body, and Euros was safely contained, they both climbed into a helicopter for the brief flight off the island. Sherlock’s shoulders slouched and his eyes were dark and haunted. They buckled into their seats and slipped the headsets over their ears. Sherlock turned away, gazing out the window, his posture defeated. John couldn’t even imagine what he must be going through—learning that so much of your childhood had been a lie. A lie perpetrated by the people you trusted the most. He saw Sherlock covertly wiping his eyes. The doctor reached out and grasped his friend’s hand. Sherlock immediately squeezed his hand in return and shot him a grateful, watery glance. John could feel the detective’s hand trembling in his own. He did not let go for the duration of the flight.
It was 10am on a Thursday morning when the letter arrived. The sharp scent of coffee permeated the flat as John tucked two slices of bread into the toaster. London was already wide awake, cacophonous sounds of traffic rising to their flat on a warm spring draft as Sherlock shuffled into the kitchen, hair still askew from sleep, placing a soft hand on Rosie’s head as he passed. He had picked up the post from downstairs (in the hopes that the rare honey that he had ordered had arrived) and brought an official looking envelope to John. Despite having been conscious for only five minutes, it took Sherlock mere seconds to deduce that this envelope did not contain good news.
“Stay,” he whispered. And who was Sherlock to argue? There was nowhere he felt safer than lying next to his doctor. He relaxed into the bed and listened to John’s steady breath against the soft background of the sounds of London in the wee hours of the morning. Overwhelmed by love and in a swell of courage, he took John’s hand from his arm and brought It to his lips, gently kissing his knuckles. Sherlock didn’t need light to know that John was smiling as he entwined their fingers and drifted to sleep.
“I didn’t even know you knew how to do that,” he said in surprise. Sherlock gave him a signature incredulous scowl,
“Oh, OK. Right, yeah, that’s good. You can go back home to Baker Street. I’m sure you’ll be happy to sleep in your own bed again,” his tone sounded unconvincing, even to himself. The strength of his disappointment kicked him in the chest, catching him completely off guard. He had been enjoying their intimate evenings and nights here so much, that he hadn’t given much consideration to the fact that they would end. But of course they would. Sherlock would return to his home and leave John and Rosie alone. His chest was tight. He studied his wine for a few moments and cleared his throat awkwardly before hazarding a glance at his friend. Sherlock caught his eyes with an intense, but unreadable look, before again uttering a noncommittal, “Hmm.” John sighed, and turned to the television for distraction.
“Always. I want you here always.” John stilled, hope blooming in his chest, radiating, pulsing and then he fell forward into his flatmate’s arms, wrapping his own around the thin man’s waist and clinging tightly to him. He felt the detective take a deep breath, and relax into their embrace, tension falling away, his face pressed against the top of John’s head. When he murmured into John’s ear, his voice was a deep rumble,
“Oh, not that long,” Sherlock interjected. John heard another bone-deep sigh, “I’ll talk to you or text you tomorrow.” It was more tentative than a statement, so John was quick to respond.
“Look at me,“ John stepped into his space, making eye contact unavoidable, “She’s gone. I’ve accepted that now. I don’t see her anymore. I don’t talk to her anymore. All we have is each other. And when I have a nightmare tonight about you putting that bloody gun under your chin, I want to be able to reach out and touch you. To know that you’re alive.” He said it a bit more forcefully than he intended, anger a defense against his own vulnerability. Realization crept into Sherlock’s eyes. He hadn’t considered the effect that would have had on his friend—his best friend, who had already watched him die once.
When the night darkened and become rough at the edges, John stood, pulling Sherlock to his feet as well. Sherlock’s gaze was disconcertingly intense,
“I’ll be there immediately. I’m leaving now.” John stood quickly, swayed for a moment, paused, hand on his desk, eyes closed.
I woke with a startle, my back pressed against a hard surface, heart pounding out the rhythm of fear in my chest, arms wound around my knees, a feeble defense, shivering. I was instantly on high alert. Fuck, had I fallen asleep and missed the target? I squinted into the tomb-like darkness, but all I could discern was…a bed and a dresser? Explosively, I released a half-sob of relief,  feeling my bedroom wall press against the back of my head and inhaling deeply, allowing the sensations of Baker Street to assuage my slowly ebbing fear, washing it away with a tide of familiarity. I’m home. Tension leaves me in several huge exhales and I will my muscles to relax and my shoulders to ease back into a more natural pose. I hadn’t woken like this in over a year. I used to jolt awake in terror on a regular basis--thrashing in bed, rolling off the bed, curled in the corner as I was now, sometimes inside the closet. In the excruciating months after Mary died, when John had shunned me, and the following months in which our relationship had been under tentative repair, I had chosen to engage in psychotherapy. If or when (I had desperately hoped for the when) John moved back in, I didn’t want to be plagued by nightmares and trauma. I had wanted a fresh start. I wanted to move forward into a new life as the new and improved Sherlock Holmes. And the plan had been successful, for the most part. My best friend and his daughter were asleep upstairs and my nightmares were now rare. So, why am I in the corner of my bedroom shivering and gasping for air in the frigid night? Frigid. My brain was clearly not working at full capacity. It was FRIGID in the flat. I must’ve been out of my bed for some time to be shivering this hard. Why could I see my breath inside our home?
“I have to make a change, John. For a while, at least. Those 2 years were so traumatic, and then I returned to Magnussen and Mary and now Euros….my reserves are gone. I used to not recognize it when I was at this point. Or perhaps I did, but I would get high to deal with it. I can’t do that now, I have too much to lose, so I need to make a change instead. I need something different. I need to take a break.” John stiffened,
“Some. They gave me something for it. Don’t worry,“ he said quickly, opening his eyes to meet his friend’s. “Lestrade knows about it and they won’t give me anything to go home with.” John shook his head,
John fell into his friend’s chest and wrapped his arms around his waist, inhaling his scent and pressing tremulous palms into his back, solid and real. Sherlock’s long arms held him tightly and John felt his lips move on the top of his head as he murmured,
“I know what you thought,“ John interrupted, murmuring against his chest. “You were wrong.”
“Good. A nurse will be in with the soft cast and then we’ll get your discharge paperwork ready. You’ll be out of here within the hour. I want to give you some pain pills because it’s going to hurt quite a bit over the next few days, but I understand you a have a substance abuse history?”
“Is he conscious?”
“I’m not going anywhere,” he said low and husky. John felt the timbre in his marrow.
“Yes, John. I want this. We don’t need it to happen today. Today is not the day for it. But I want it. With you. I love you.” At this, John’s tears fell yet again. He placed his head against Sherlock’s chest and listened to the steady thump-thump of his heart. They remained wrapped around one another until the pinks and grays transformed the world into the bright, bustling city on an uncharacteristically sunny fall day.
“Hey,” Sherlock murmured. John bored a hole in the floor as he exhaled harshly.
The air had a dense, slow-motion quality. He watched in horror as Sherlock slowly placed the muzzle of the gun beneath his chin. “No!” John shouted in his dream, his stomach dropping and his breath halting. He couldn’t bear to watch him die again. His closest friend.  In agony and disbelief, he watched Sherlock pull the trigger…
“Tell me.” I looked into his bright, compassionate gaze and took a bracing breath,
“This may hurt a bit,” she said as she eased his arm into the rigid frame of the brace. The detective bit off a moan, his face crumping as he paled. John stepped closer, slid a hand over his back and rubbed small circles. When she was finished, Sherlock’s head dropped and he slouched forward, his breathing labored. John suddenly found his arm around his friend.   “There you are, then. The doctor already gave you instructions, so you boys are ready to go.” She smiled as she pulled the door shut behind her. John stood in front Sherlock once again, sliding his hand through the silky-inky curls, pulling the uninjured side of his forehead against his chest and resting his cheek atop the detective’s head.
“I understand, and I’m never leaving again. You’re my family now. You and Rosie, and I’m not going anywhere. I’ll be here, always.” He opened his eyes, their transparent seas revealing pure honesty. Though he knew him nearly as well as he knew himself, John’s expression was nothing Sherlock had ever observed before—a mosaic of pain and passion, relief and love, and before he knew it, John had pressed his lips to his. The kiss was soft and warm, sweet and intense. Sherlock’s mind halted and he saw blooms of colors behind his eyelids, his heart skipping in his chest. It was over all too soon, leaving him completely breathless and wanting for more—so much more. John quickly pulled away and ducked into an embrace, hiding his face in his friend’s shoulder, muttering “I’m sorry, I--”
“Mr. Holmes?” he extended his hand to Sherlock, snapping the binder shut and placing it on the bedside table. “It looks like you won’t need surgery,” he said brightly. “We’re going to give you a soft cast—a velcro brace that you can take off when bathing, but under no circumstances should you use your arm or hand for anything for the next 6 weeks. You can take it off for cleanliness only. Wear it at night, too. You’re going to need help with things—shaving, writing, everything you do with your dominant hand. If you were a child, we would cast it so we could be sure that you don’t move it.” John suppressed a smile and shot a sidelong glance at the detective.
Sherlock’s father picked them up at the station, cooing over Rosie to the point of eye rolls from the detective. They settled into the Holmes home, Sherlock’s mother welcoming them with a warm hug and also gushing over Rosie. Somehow, on short notice (Mycroft was likely involved), they had acquired a small portable crib and placed it in one of the guest rooms. John found this gesture very touching and surprised himself with the unusual need to blink back tears. Why was he so emotional?
“It’s not like that.” I sigh.
“It’s not working.”  I lie.
I swallow thickly at the thought of that.  I wonder which dark place Mycroft is alluding to.
“It will take time Sherlock.  It’s getting better.”
It isn’t Doc that comes though.  I am starting to realise that I must be mistaken.  My back doesn’t hurt, and I can remember Mary.  That came after Serbia, right?
🖤🖤🖤 Happy 10 years 🖤🖤🖤
“Tired, sore, miserable, this whole situation is completely nefandous.”
I flip open the cover.  I cringe as the spine creaks, but lightning doesn’t shoot from the pages; rocks don’t fall from the sky.  The photos look exactly the same as I remember them.  It’s almost disappointing how mundane it feels to look down at them.
“By the time the guy with the car battery came for a second time, I couldn’t take anymore.  I was so worn down by it all.  I was sleep deprived, injured, hurting all over, dehydrated, starving, I had pneumonia.  I was desperate.  I was scared.
they giving me
“Close enough.  It’s Wednesday morning now.”
Nostalgia made him want that again; he yearned for the feeling of somebody in his arms.  He rolled onto his side, moving slowly so he wouldn’t wake her; so he wouldn’t wake up the hangover that prowled in the periphery.  The body in the bed next to him was facing the wrong way though.  The forehead now against the soft place where his ribs joined in the centre.  The back wasn’t naked the way he’d left it last night.  The fabric smooth and cool beneath his fingers.
“Morning, Sherlock.”  I call out from the doorway.  I don’t want to startle him, not after how agitated he was yesterday and especially not after Mycroft’s revelation.
I should just leave it, but in the world of Sherlock Holmes privacy and ownership are elastic concepts.
I organise for Dr. Pawson to come back and watch whatever it is that Mycroft has in mind.  It is only a short wait until the doctor is back in the room.
“I’m still cold, warm me up.”  He requests   I don’t know whether he is or if he is just manipulating me.  He would never be so plain as to simply ask me to lay down with him.  Either way, it is a good excuse to spoon around him, one I would not miss.  I put my hand on his chest so I can feel every breath and every thrum of his heart.
I don’t know why she is bothering really; they haven’t got much in the way of definitive answers from him.
“Umm.”  I say.  Then realised I’m not exactly sure.  I look around feebly for clues.  “Not much.  Mrs. Hudson made scones.”
“Did you harm him when you have fought?”
“We don’t need to, not ever.  It doesn’t matter to me.  Not enough to make you go through that.”
“So, are you going to sell up?”
“You killed him?”  Hope has joined the anger in his tone.
“I’m not against it, exactly, but there are so many awful memories, they are so close to the surface.  I don’t know what…”  My voice trails off.
“Wilma McCann.”  Sherlock answers without a pause.
“Oh yeah, and I think you should admire my discretion at declining to mention that her lawyer friend likes to wear her frilly undies.”
It has gone on too long.  It is getting harder to look at the victims.  I have never struggled with that in the past but now, these ones, they are getting to me.  The victims of the crimes I investigate have always just been clues, problems to solve.  These ones are different; I know their brand of pain.  I know their brand of anguish.  I know their brand of fear and I don’t want to look at it anymore.  That is why I decided to try the newspapers; to make a subtle suggestion to him that I might be a suitable next victim.  I hate it.  I fear it.  I have danced around it for months and yet here I am waiting for him.
I make a phone call.  I don’t know who else to ask.
“Hello, John, is that you?”  Clara asks me in a bemused voice.  I can’t call Harry; we are hardly talking at the best of times.  Clara has always been kind and level-headed.
It is late; well after dark when I come up the stairs.  The trips to Sherrinford always take up most of the day and they are always draining.  The familiar sight of John sitting in front of the fire with a newspaper on his lap greets me as I enter the living room and it makes me yearn for the old days when John still lived here, and this was an everyday sight.
“No, I’m fine.  It’s just that we appear to have a collective morning condition.”
“I need records.  Burglaries, fights, assaults, car jackings, all sexual assaults, everything where the violence was exaggerated; was more than necessary to commit the crime.  Head injuries especially.  I need records from the past two years.  He didn’t begin with breaking in and bashing people’s heads in.  He started somewhere else.  That is how we find him.  I don’t know why I didn’t see it before.”
“We have argued before.”
“While I was away.  When you thought I was dead.”  God no, why does everything come back to that God-awful time?
“Yeah, heaps.”  I pause, I need a minute.  “Show my yours.”
“Oh, good.”  John sounds relieved, then surprised at himself.  “No, not good; actually, I think you should go in and get checked out again.  Just to be sure.
I can’t be sure because I am already drifting back to sleep, but I think he presses his lips to my forehead before he leaves.
“Right here, Sherlock.  How are you feeling?”  I ask him, not really expecting an answer.  I don’t get one.  I wait until he settles and pull the blankets back up a little.  His temperature is a little low, but he keeps pushing the blankets away.
“I guess.”
“I need you to open your eyes for me.”  Doctor Pawson says loudly.  Still there is no response.  He rubs Sherlock’s forearm, trying to get his attention.  He waits for a moment and then moves onto applying increasing pressure to the nail of his right thumb.  Sherlock jerks his hand away but does not open his eyes.
“You want coffee?”
“When was this?”  I ask him.  My voice shakes.  I need to know this; how could I be his closest friend and not be aware of this happening to him?
“Isn’t it?”
John pauses, eyebrows scrunched, then ploughs on.  “It’s just you’ve been a bit distant and I was…  I was just… I thought you might be avoiding me after our conversation the other night.  You weren’t put off by that?”
Frustration burns like a bad itch.  I am getting better at controlling it now, channelling it and not letting it overcome me, but Jesus, Sherlock tests me some days.  Part of controlling it is not letting it build up.  So, I blurt out, “you could try to be a bit nicer to the new ones, if Greg ever retires, they will be the ones we are stuck working with.”
More footsteps are followed by the sound of the door shutting quietly.  To my relief a very real John comes and wraps a woollen blanket around my shoulders.  He sits down beside me, and I extend the blanket so that he can wrap it around himself too.
“You ungrateful sod.”  I hiss, as he reaches out for it anyway.  “I was hoping you’d take a nap.  I thought tea might be a better idea.”
I think back.  “Talking to Lestrade.  He told me it was too late to get the files I wanted.  I went to bed.  I must have fallen asleep waiting for…  Oh.”
He woke up screaming an hour later.  He wouldn’t talk to me about it, but instead of telling me to sod off like I expected him to; he let me sit up with him on the couch.  We sat in silence until the shaking died down to intermittent tremors.  Eventually, the sleeping pill and the exhaustion caused him to sag down until he fell asleep with his head against my shoulder.  I wrapped a blanket around him and let him drool on my shirt until shards of morning light pierced through the drapes neither of us ever bother to close.  He woke up suddenly and self-consciously and excused himself to the bathroom.
John must feel my tension up because he stirs too.
“You need to make sure you take care of your health.”  I gasp as he runs a single fingertip up my inner thigh and directly over my balls.  “Staying out all night is not taking care of yourself.  You didn’t even rug up.  You didn’t even, oh god, you didn’t even tell me where you were.”
my hand.  Intravenous.  Oh.
“Good or bad?” He asks, sounding desperately uncertain.
I shut the door behind me.  Slip off my coat and my shoes.  I take the letter and go to the mantelpiece.  I collect my knife and take it to my chair.  I turn the envelope over and over in my hand.  Cheap generic stationary, cheap blue ballpoint pen, stationary supplied by the nursing home, no doubt.  Shaky writing.  Closed with spit.  Smells musty, like the album.
“Take these.  Strong paracetamol for your head and something to help you sleep.”
I prop myself up long enough to gulp down the tablets and a mouthful of tea.
It’s ridiculous but so are most things he suggests, and he is already unbuttoning my shirt.  His tea forgotten on the edge of the tub.
He takes a deep breath, blows it out.  Continues on, building up speed as he speaks.  “I’m struggling with it, a bit.  Quite a lot, truth be told.  I never considered that I might have feelings for a man that weren’t exactly… platonic.  I think what I’m trying to say, is that I would want us to be more than just friends, I just don’t know how to do that.  I don’t know if I can do that.  I don’t even know if you feel the same way.  It’s fine, if you don’t.”
I make the bed, taking more care than I would if it were my own.  Then I shower and dress before installing myself in my chair to break the no screens rule long enough to check my email.  It would be just my luck if a great mystery presented itself while I’m not looking out for it.
“Damn it.”  I curse loudly.  Publishing my address is part of the plan, but John doesn’t need to know that.  “Why do they do that?”
“You can’t.  Just keep doing what you’re doing, and I will work out the rest.”
I get home around eight.  It has been a long day and I feel completely rung out.  Sherlock is asleep on the couch.  I have never seen him sleep so much; the concussion is still healing.  I know from experience how tired it can make you feel.  I slept for a month when I got brained playing rugby in the under sixteens.  I’m so emotionally exhausted I feel like I could sleep for a month now.
“Morning.”  I reply.  Unable to think of anything intelligent to say.  My voice sounds tight.
When the alarm sounds again Sherlock groans dramatically.  “You should quit.”
“Oh…Oh…”  Then he pauses again, like he is doubting himself.  “What exactly are those feelings?”
“I know I pushed you away after the trouble with Euros; told you to stay in your own place.  When I told you that it was because I couldn’t deal with Rosie screaming at night.”  He pauses and, in that pause, all the anger that I had felt when he had rejected the idea of me moving back in swirls around me.  Until he continues and then all that anger is blown away and replaced with heartbreak.  “It was a lie.  It was really that I didn’t want you to deal with me screaming at night.  I was embarrassed, I didn’t want you to find out about any of this.  I was going to take it all to my grave.  Now that you know, I would like you to move back in, properly, permanently, if you want to.”
“It really is!  How long until I can wash it?”  I dread his answer.
This chapter might make a little more sense if you have read Home, however you are Sherlockians, you are the clever people, I am confident you will be fine either way.
“I know,” she says, waving me into a chair, “I lived in Palermo for a few years, all last week I wished I was back there.”
“Both wrong.  Was second June ‘46.”  He says in a husky voice.  I wonder how damaged his throat is.
There is - prequels to this series (what Sherlock got up to on hiatus), Mycroft's perspective on getting Sherlock out of Serbia,  a Johncentric military fic, a rewrite of the Marazin stone (with bonus sickfic), a missing scene from HLV, and the origin story for the skull.  As well as a whole bunch of random stuff; everything from whump to angst to badly written shagging.
“You can’t get your stitches wet.”
“Bloody Hell, Sherlock.  This is ridiculous.  You need to tell me when you do this kind of thing.”
“Yes, yes, it is necessary.  I know you claim you can look after yourself but… Rosie.  I won’t have her put at risk.  He has killed two kids already.”
“To add confusion and doubt to everything else I was subjected to, that was almost too much.  That’s the thing; I could handle…can handle what they did to my body.  It’s only transport.  What gets to me is what it did to my mind.”
So does he.  I can feel it against my leg.
“Well, it’s not like we had any leads; he is a ghost.  A year and a half and even I have nothing to go on.”
I know he wants more, I’d be a fool not to, but I trust him to respect my boundaries, to not push me, and all things considered, I guess that that says a lot.
“I guess I just always thought I was only into women.  I was married to one not that long ago.”
I hear soft footsteps behind me.  I turn my head; moving slowly and deliberately, but I cannot see anyone there.  I wonder if it was a hallucination.  They happen sometimes, a gift from the past.  Too many indulgences with chemicals that are best not forced into the blood stream.
He mumbled something.  I think it might have been.  “Show me later.”
I am startled by a nervous little rapping at my door.  I close my eyes for a moment, try to centre myself, before calling out, “What?”
John lifts the blanket and peeks beneath it.  He chuckles softly.  That helps me to relax a bit.
I quickly Google the date of birth of the Yorkshire Ripper, I very much doubt Sherlock is wrong, but it is still some relief when Wikipedia tells me that he is bang on with his information.
Sherlock doesn’t move.  If anything, he is more still, as if he has paused to wait for something.
“It’s fine, you don’t need to apologise.”
“John, I was wondering when you would call.  The red flag for his admission notice came in six and a half hours ago.”  Mycroft answers his phone with the usual sneer in his voice.  “How is my dear brother?”
“You trust me though?”  John asks with such doubt that I am horrified.
I nod and he rucks up my t-shirt.  I sit up to pull it over my head.  I pause.  My body is a mess but that is not what really bothers me.
““No, I wouldn’t expect… Damn.  I’m making such a mess of this.”  He says in a tight voice.  We a both on edge.  Terrible at this.
“John, I can tell you are very committed to this; you are clearly a capable person.  The changes you need to make in order to be able to manage your anger are relatively small ones but they will have a huge impact on your life.  You can do this.”
“Nope, I can’t think of anything.”
I nod, unable to think of the right words.
I laugh a little.  Then realise that it is an entirely inappropriate time to be laughing.  That makes me laugh a little more.  Thankfully he joins me and doesn’t throw me out of the room.  The tension drains from us both a little.
“No, I guess not.  She was smart and funny and bold.”
“How long were you there?”  John whispers.
“Yes,” he whispered, “And I always will.” This man was deconstructing and reconstructing him.
A tingling wave moved from Sherlock’s center out to his fingers and toes and he was momentarily overwhelmed with….sentiment? for this man. How did he deserve such a friend as John Watson? He pulled out his usual chair at the table, tucking into his food with an unusual hunger and winked at Rosie. The meal passed in amiable silence aside from some toddler conversation. Immediately after finishing her meal, Rosie pointed to her coloring books, stacked in a bin nearby, announcing,
“Like that,” he responded quietly, “A hand in your hair often helped. It never fully woke you, it just calmed you a bit.” The detective’s eyes closed and he nodded.
“They were probably bad people, though, weren’t they?"
“It’s a long ride there, two hours at least.”
“Yes,” John said simply. As he walked into the kitchen to start the tea, he saw the corners of his friend’s mouth twitch upward. He stood in the kitchen while waiting for the water to boil, stretching and rolling his shoulders with a yawn.
“You’re not going to find them from up there,” John said after he recovered and turned quickly back to the kitchen before Sherlock could deduce his thoughts. “And now I have to clean that table, again,” he added with affected ire that he hoped would camouflage his discombobulation. John wondered if his flatmate had any idea how often he pushed those kinds of thoughts out of his head. He very much hoped not, because he didn’t want anything to upset the happy household they had created in the past year. John had never imagined that he and his daughter would be so content, and live so much like a family, when they moved in with the great detective. Sherlock’s sharp words, unusual habits, and inconsiderate nature had all softened as John and Rosie insinuated themselves into his home and his heart. Sherlock was as much a part of Rosie’s life as any parent and he helped John as much as any spouse. John hadn’t even considered dating again. His life was full as it was and he had no desire for more companionship or the complications that came with it.
“I have to pick up Rosie. You’re coming back with us tonight, right?” His expression was hopeful. Sherlock smiled,
“You can’t even tell this place was blown up a few weeks ago,” John said, inspecting the room from his seat. “You did a good job getting everything back in place.”
“But of course!” She cooed at Rosie and shut the door to her flat. John stared blankly at the closed door for a moment. He was floored by all the effort Sherlock had put into making John and Rosie feel at home here. A smile crept over his features and he climbed the seventeen steps.
“Hm?” He looked down at the doctor as they waited at an intersection for a light to change. John began haltingly, unsure of his words,
“It’s alright,” Sherlock’s hand was on his arm again, pulling the doctor towards him. John turned his pained expression to his battered best friend and moved into an embrace that was meant to be, yet wasn’t, the manly, quick-back-thump-best-mate embrace. It was more of a clinging-for-dear-life embrace.
“Gladly.” Sherlock lifted his wan face.
“I’m glad you ate something.  Now, close your eyes.” In a rare event, Sherlock did exactly as he asked.  Beneath the doctor’s gentle touch, he let go.
“John, are you alright? John, answer me.” The detective’s voice was laced with concern. John continued to pant, barely able to hold the phone to his ear. The ring of the deep baritone washed relief through his body and ever so slowly the panic began to ebb.
“Oh, you’re helping today,” he said to the detective in a teasing tone, “to what do I owe this pleasure?”
It had been ten months. Ten months since he and Rosie had returned to Baker Street to live and well over a year since Mary had died. It had all started the day of The Hug. Yes, he thought of it in capital letters. It was a day that they had shattered barriers. An emotional barrier that had kept them apart for too many months, during a time when they had needed each other more than ever. He had needed Sherlock in his grief and Sherlock had needed him for sobriety and stability, and yet, John had denied them both their most basic need. He denied them both what it took to heal them. That day, at his most vulnerable moment, after John confessed his crippling insecurities and his profound shame, Sherlock had tentatively pulled the doctor into his chest. It took a few moments for John to register what was happening before he fell against his friend’s chest, wrapping his arms around his waist and gasping through his sobs. He had so much to grieve—the loss of his wife, the loss of his daughter’s mother, the shame of abusing his best friend, and the months spent in solitude. A self-imposed purgatory. He nearly drowned in regret as he inhaled Sherlock’s scent and leaned against him for support, his legs feeling weak and unreliable. Sherlock kept him afloat, tightening his arms to keep him above the surface.
“How are you guys doing? You and Mycroft, I mean.” Sherlock stared into his glass pensively, clinking his ice with gentle turns.
“You have?” he rasped through a tight throat. John held his gaze for seemingly an eternity.
“I want to be here for you and Rosie. I want to be here when she learns to talk and learns to read and when she does her first experiment,” his words slipped from him as if by accident, as if he hadn’t planned on saying them. John watched him swallow nervously, looking slightly surprised and love for the man filled him and spilled over into a smile as warm as the autumn afternoon sun. It emboldened the detective. “I want to be here to see all of these turn silver,” he said deliberately, carefully, as he reached up with his free hand and gently touched John’s remaining golden strands.
“Hey,” John, said, soothingly running fingers through my inky curls in the inky night.  “I should’ve been there for you. I’m sorry. I was totally self-absorbed and conflicted around the time of the wedding.”  I shook my head, denying the apology, collecting myself.
“What’s happening here?” His instinctive gut reaction to the fear in Sherlock’s expression made his own tone guarded and terse.
“Greg, what the hell--how did you let this happen?” Guilt and a little fear of the Captain Watson Tone revealed itself in the DI’s expression. He ran his right hand roughly over the back of his neck.
“The overdose on the plane wasn’t accidental. You probably knew that. Or suspected it, at least. I was sent on a fatal mission. It was the price I had to pay for killing Magnussen. But I was determined not to spend another 2 years working alone in barren wastelands and die at the hands of some nameless criminal. I wanted to choose the terms of my death. I was never going to see you again and I wanted you to be the last person I spoke to. I wanted your words to be the last thing in my thoughts before oblivion set in. ” John’s fingers tightened around mine. “Truth.”
“Are you cold?” Sherlock asked him. John shook his head, his gaze still on the glowing embers. This is it, John thought, it’s time to do this.
“We have reason to celebrate,” he said almost to himself. Sherlock squeezed his hand as they pulled into his driveway.
“Everything alright?” Sherlock made a noncommittal sound in response. John continued with the bedtime routine. He was rocking Rosie in her chair when his phone rang. Sherlock heard him talking with a colleague from the surgery and stepped into Rosie’s room to relieve John. He took mini-Watson from his friend, as John stepped out to talk about exchanging surgery shifts. Rosie was calm as the tide of sleep tugged on her eyelids. Sherlock found himself soothed by the rocking rhythm and soft warmth in his arms. If someone had told him a year ago that he would be holding a tiny person and gazing at her lovingly, he’d have scoffed at the absurdity and insulted them. Yet, here he was. John stepped in, smiling as he watched his two most favorite people in the world.
Shortly thereafter, the debacle with Euros unfolded. When they finally pulled John out of the well, he had been nearly unconscious and shivering so violently that he couldn’t speak. The rescue workers wrapped him in warm, dry blankets and whisked him away to an awaiting ambulance. He did, however, remember, Sherlock plowing through the workers to get to him. He remembered Sherlock’s arms around him briefly, with vice-like strength, and Sherlock’s broken voice whispering,
“God, we’ve been through so much in the past few years, Sherlock. You’re right. We have to stop this. You are worth too much to me.”
“Aren’t we all? But this is serious. If this fracture isn’t permitted to heal, you could end up needing surgery later and you may never hold a bow properly again.” Sherlock blinked, gave John a concerned look, and nodded.
“You may be the only one who can, Dr. Watson. I have to go out of town on business this evening and I don’t want him to be alone. His risk for relapse is extremely high, John. He, himself, suggested that he stay with you.”
“It took us twelve years. Over a decade.  But, I think we finally got our timing right.” I pulled back to look into my best friend’s gaze.
“You know what. They were in my pocket and now they’re not. You’ve hidden them again. Or taken them. Tell me you didn’t dispose of them,” he growled, stepping close and glowering at the doctor. John had never feared an angry, blustering Sherlock and wasn’t put off by his attempts at intimidation.
“Hey,” he said ever-so-softly, his voice gravelly with sleep. “Let’s go to a real bed and see if we can get another couple hours before Rosie is up.” His detective struggled to open his gorgeous eyes in a look of sleepy surprise and John smiled. Sherlock pushed himself up and gradually untangled his limbs from John’s, leaving the doctor feeling chilled and vacant. The detective sat at the edge of the couch, yawning widely and rubbing his hands over his shadowed face.
“Oh, Sherlock, we’ve wasted so much ti—“ Sherlock didn’t allow him to finish the thought. He took his doctor’s face in both his hands and crushed their lips together.
And so they ended up at Baker street, all three—finding a shared routine, of waking and sleeping, investigating and doctoring, caretaking and take-out, arguing and laughing. Though they had their own rooms, the affection remained frequent and easy. A light hand on the back, on a shoulder while passing through the kitchen, the whisper of fingers on mugs, lingering embraces with Rosie between them and molding to each other on the couch as the hour grew late and eyelids dropped low. There were heavy moments, the desire for more thick enough to taste, the air sticking in John’s throat, as he wondered what comes next. He had no doubts about the love he felt for Sherlock, but he had doubts about how much detective wanted from him. Sherlock seemed happy….looked happy. His eye shone, he ate and slept somewhat more regularly (he was still Sherlock) and he was irritable and irascible less often. He rarely went for days on end without speaking and he played gentle, passionate pieces on his violin day and night. John and Rosie had already altered Sherlock’s natural habits so much, that John didn’t want to risk forcing more change on the detective. It wasn’t worth losing everything they’d built—a life that John loved. He let the moments pass and they fell back into their easy rhythm.
“Please.”  I try to say but my voice cracks like a teenager’s.
“Open his eyes spontaneously or at lease on command, answering simple questions like what day of the week it is, and perform a simple motor task such as squeezing a hand.
“What happened yesterday?”
I know where she is going with this, it’s hard not to be defensive.  “He is clean now, has been since then. He’s great with Rosie.  He works with the police; he isn’t some junkie.”
I go directly home.  I have only been gone an hour but Mrs Hudson hovers when I come in the door.
“Seriously?  After all that?”  He says almost mockingly, but he takes my hand and stops me from stepping away.  “I won’t be able to sleep if you sit there watching me.”
“Enhanced interrogation techniques.”  John says slowly.  “That’s the bullshit term the Americans used for the shit that went down at Guantanamo.”
“Did you...?”  I can’t finish the question.  “Is there a list?”
The card is for Metro Forensic Cleaners.  I sigh.  I will probably need them.  Sherlock’s room had looked like something out of a B grade horror film.  I could only be worse now that the blood has dried.
I roll over to face him.  He undoes the buttons on his night shirt and pushes the fabric aside.  Even after all these years I have never seen it.  He is always fastidious about keeping himself covered.  I had expected a little puck mark like the one on my chest, but my eyes are drawn to a jagged scar splayed like the open petals of a red lily.  Exit wound, high velocity, large calibre.  A surgical scar runs the length of his lumpy clavicle.
The please seems to be an afterthought.  I’m such an arsehole.
The poor doctor doesn’t know whether Mycroft is being serious or not, so he laughs politely and after a glance at me, which I can only answer with a raised eyebrow.
He waits for me to collect my thoughts.  His face against my neck.  I push away the thoughts of Rimac and try to focus on John’s steady breathing.  Hoping it will help to reassure me.
“Alright then, what the hell did she say to deserve it?”  I ask.
John.  Where are you?
He blinked his eyes open, squinted against the dull light.  Curls, blue dressing gown, bare feet sticking over the end of the bed.  Sherlock.
“Still ok?”
I put my palm against his cheek.  He leans into it and raises his head at the same time.  I have never seen him so dejected.
“She wouldn’t think that.”  I say, leaving the cliché ‘she’d want you to be happy,’ unsaid, knowing it would sound too cheesy.
I am always tired lately.
.  Why now?
“Where have you been?  I was worried about you.  I popped in to say hello and you were gone.”  She eyes me closely.  I’m sick of their scrutiny.
He recoiled reflexively at the shock of finding the wrong person in his bed.  The unexpected person.  Where the hell did...?  He didn’t even know her name.
The wipe comes away covered in sauce, the likeness to blood gives me a shudder.
“Come on, tell me what your name is?”  The doctor says more firmly at the same time he leans and uses a trapezius squeeze.  Standard practice to get a patient’s attention.  It is such a simple act, not truly painful, just a way to cause a little discomfort, enough to get a simple reaction but Sherlock’s reaction is not simple at all.  His eyes shoot open and look wildly around.  He is trying to push himself further up the bed, flailing and kicking, pushing the blankets away.  His left arm moves weakly but he is still moving it far more than he should considering that the joint was reduced only a few hours before.
As John is finishing up I get to the final page.  He joins in from memory as I read; “he was a spunky hanky panky cranky stinky dinky lanky honky tonky winky wonky donkey” while Rosie claps her hands.  John’s breath huffs on my neck as he laughs at the ridiculousness of it all.
“I just need to know that she is safe.”  Janette says, “I have to ask this too, were you ever violent with your wife?”
“I’ll be fine here tonight.  I’m not going to sleep anyway.  I have some composing to do.”  I know it sounds like a dismissal.  John does too.  He leaves without a word.  I hear the front door slam.  I hear him swear loudly from the street.
As they talk, I am doing the mental calculations.  2013, late 2013, that was when he was… dead.  Oh.  How did I not know that had happened?  It must have been shortly before he came home in January.  Why did he never mention it?
“You were right, was a mess.”  John tells me, his voice sounds hollow as it bounces around the sink.  “They really should have washed it for you at the hospital.”
“Nope, a nursing home, with nothing for company but cheap nurses and a photo album to remind him of his hateful father.”  He stops suddenly, as if has said more than he intended.
“Sell it.  Sell it so we can sleep in every day and take all the cases we want.”  Sherlock says into the pillow.
“She was right about one thing though.”  Sherlock says.
I thought you said she cries too much.
Selling up sounds appealing, but I suspect it is nothing more than Sherlock’s sleepy ramblings.
What the hell.  It’s probably a case.  If I read it, maybe we can ponder over it during dinner.  It will be nice to have something to talk about that is a bit lighter.
“You loved me, even back then.”
“She doesn’t even talk, Sherlock.  What’s the bloody point?”
“Shall I proceed?”  He asks, calm and steady as ever.
The hospital room is dimly lit when I crack my eyes open.  I have a splitting headache and my shoulder throbs in sync with my skull.  I know that I am in hospital but have no recollection of getting here.  I have the vivid memory of feeling panicked.  Thoughts of Serbia drift in the periphery, but I know that that was a long time ago.  I try to remember what happened; what caused me to be here.  Each time I nearly have it, it drifts away like a name forgotten.  Almost remembered but alluding you.
“Fine.”
“Don’t worry.  It’s too late now.  I’m not that hard to look up anyway, should someone want to visit.”
By the time natural light comes through my window I am exhausted, uncomfortable, and irritable.  I don’t know why after all these years the things that happened are back to haunt me.  I had dealt with that shit.  Buried it.
“Have the arguments ever become physical?”
everything.  Any form of sensory deprivation would be hateful to him.  Or did they beat him?
I very rarely dream about what happened there.  Even when the wounds were still fresh and I could hardly sleep a wink, it wasn’t dreams that kept me awake.  It was just that I was systematically, and cruelly trained to stay awake.  It was simply a physical reaction to the act of falling asleep, every time I started to drop off my eyes would leap open and my heart would beat a
“What do you mean, staples?”  he asks incredulously.
“‘Hmm,” he mumbles from where he reclines in the tub, ‘you could have made coffee.’
He brings me undone with his touch and his heat and his passion.  When he tips his head back and tenses.  The look of ecstasy on his face makes me follow his climax.
When I cannot procrastinate any longer, I slip the knife in between the top fold and the shoulder of the envelope and slip the sharp blade along its width.
His hand moves more quickly, the rhythm just right and the water ripples and splashes around his grip.
I idea stirs something akin to arousal within me, but arousal sit too closely to shame and fear to have any of the positive appeal it once might have held.  Pausing, I contemplate the best ways to say what I am thinking.
“That’s not the way to get out of this.”
“John?”
I don’t answer.  I don’t do
and abstract.  Like looking at a familiar landscape,
“I hate those fuckers.”  He mutters under his breath.  He hasn’t connected that he is one of the ones who has hurt me.
“You’re motivated not to, though?”
“I used to freak out more than that when I had a shower or brushed my teeth.  I didn’t stop doing those things.  They got better.”
“Oh.  Good for you.  You do look well rested.”  She says with a wink.
“Off to bed, little miss.”  John says sweeping up Rosie as I close the book.
As we drift off to sleep in the morning light I whisper into his ear as he did into mine earlier.  “I love you.”
Sherlock has hardly moved since he started talking but as I step closer, as I reach out towards him, he recoils.  It is the slightest of movements, but it stops me.  That small movement is like a stab in the guts.  I stand in the no-man’s-land between the door and the bed.
I grip both his tense thighs and try to follow his directions.
Natural light wakes me next time.  It is pleasant to sleep this late.  I almost never do.  John is still beside me.  Must be Sunday.  He only sleeps late on Sundays; so conventional in his habits.
Sure thing.  Do you mind if Rosie stays tonight?  Molly has an early start tomorrow.
“Shit,” I hear rustling down the phone, evidence he is on the move, “I’m on my way.”
I shake my head, but he grips my wrist and gives it a threatening tug.  It seems I will end up in the bath either way.
It is John who breaks the impasse.
John taps me on the shoulder.  Then he is shouting.
He just blinks at me.
“No.”  He says with finality.  “I won’t be working with her.”
I nod again.  I swipe angrily at the tears on my face.
John is putting the groceries away as I make a lap around the kitchen table making aeroplane noises as Rosie squeals with delight.  I see a smile sneak onto John’s face.  I am still making laps when he slumps down into a chair with a beer in hand.  He looks worn out.
“I shot him in the back of the head.  Sherlock had almost stopped struggling; he was running out of time.”  I rub my eyes with both palms, exhaustion is catching up with me.
I realise I am dozing off and I’m too bored to care.  I doubt there will be any problems tonight; it is after three o’clock.  I would know if he is here already and if he does change his MO and come now, I’m a light sleeper.  I can thank my experiences in Serbia for that.
“I have plenty of money, thank you.”  I say indignantly.
“I knew something they didn’t; it was my last desperate attempt at a reprieve.  I knew who he was, the guy with the car battery.  Who he really was.  A double agent; I had seen his file on Mycroft’s desk once.  It took me a long time to put it together, to remember why he was familiar, too long.  I told them.  They killed him.  Dumped his body somewhere.  That’s how Mycroft found me.  He is hopeless in the field; you saw what he is like at Sherrinford.  I had to do half the work to get us out.  Then he expected me to thank him for it later.  He was there, undercover, for almost twenty-nine hours before we could escape.  He watched them beat me, he chose the tools they would use on me, twice.  He knew what was happening at night.  He knew from the first glance.  He waited, stuck to the plan.  He needed to, I know that, but it was my lowest moment.  That was the only time I felt truly broken.  Knowing that he knew and did nothing.”
“What?”
“I was due to see my parents anyway. And bringing you and Rosie will earn me enough credit that I won’t have attend the next musical they come into London to see. It’ll be Mycroft’s turn.” John smiled, recognizing the tactic.
It was a warm summer evening, the horizon still softly lit with the lavender remains of the day. Sherlock had been at Mycroft’s for a couple of days, but now he sat with John after Rosie was asleep. John had made some delicious pasta dish and they relaxed, sated, on the couch, with wine and crap telly, when John quietly stated,
“I extracted him, John, I know well what he went through,” Mycroft said quietly. John gave a mirthless laugh.
“Mmm hmm. It felt right. Was that ok?” John asked, a hint of doubt tainting his tone. However, when he pulled away and looked up into Sherlock’s smoldering gaze, all doubt was erased from his mind. Sherlock leaned down, mere millimeters from John’s lips,
The morning passed uneventfully, though John’s mood became subdued. Sherlock’s parents were going to take Rosie on a picnic while they were at the funeral and it eased John’s mind knowing that she was in loving hands. They each went to their rooms to get dressed and when John joined Sherlock in the living room 20 minutes later, Sherlock froze. John was adorned in his uniform, which he’d had altered last week. Sherlock was struck by how handsome and young he looked in the trim lines and beige tones. He could easily imagine John shouting commands, directing emergency operations and being a captain that his troops respected and probably loved. An entire life, perhaps the most important part, lived before they had even met. The detective blinked, his mouth dry. He had stared long enough to make John uncomfortable.
An hour later, the detective was snoring and John eased himself from under his legs. He cleaned up dinner and stood over his friend, loathe to wake him.
“Sherlock,” John sounded as wrecked as he felt. “If you can’t tell that was more than OK, then your detecting skills have markedly worsened.” Sherlock grinned, touching their lips together again, and then kissing the tip of John’s nose, and his forehead.
“I’d follow you anywhere, Sherlock. Anywhere that you’ll let me come. Like you told Mycroft, we’re family.” Overwhelmed with gratitude and love, I drew John into my chest and held him desperately. His arms snaked behind my back and his hold on me was equally tight.
“No, John, “ Sherlock spoke quickly, desperately, grabbing his friend’s hand, closing the distance John had begun to create. “Not from you, never from you, that’s not what I mean. I need a break from risk, from danger, from death, from lies and deception and fear and bone-deep, soul-shattering loneliness. I need respite from the constant feeling that I might just lose everything, everything, in an instant.” It was as if all the oxygen had been sucked out of the room and John was frozen, unable to breathe. He figured it out in this moment—the proverbial light bulb finally flickering and sputtering to life over his head. His heart was irrevocably interwoven with this man’s. It always had been, since the day they met, but he had been blind to it, completely ignorant of it, until this moment. It felt like he had been living life blind folded and suddenly the bright and brilliant world stood before him.  A truth as bright as sunlight sparkling on snow. One thing was certain--whatever Sherlock asked of him, John would give him.
“John, look at this,” the detective said with an undertone of excitement, “This man is completely innocent! It’s obvious! But they’ve arrested him as the prime suspect. I must call Lestrade today. Maybe I’ll go to the Yard.” John walked over to read the article in front of his friend, leaning a hand on his shoulder to see the details. His chest was nearly against Sherlock’s back—he could have tucked his head against his shoulder. He felt Sherlock take a deep breath and felt he may need to do the same to clear his suddenly hazy head.
“I know you didn’t sign up for this, Sherlock, for raising a child, for housing a broken soldier and his broken life—” The detective lifted his hand and gently placed the pad of his thumb against  John’s lips, stopping his monologue. His fingers then drifted, feather-light over the doctor’s jaw.
“More?” It was meant to be a bold statement, but sounded like a question. He meant to look cocky and confident, but looked vulnerable. With rough, competent physician-palms, John framed Sherlock’s face, forcing his face upward, his gaze catching and holding.
“I’ll get her,“ Sherlock rose quickly from the bed, attempting to dispel his discombobulation. He leaned over the crib and gently lifted her. He kissed her cheek as he laid her on the changing pad. John observed him with something akin to shock as he proceeded to quickly and efficiently change her nappy.
“Come with me tomorrow. Please.”
It was as if he was cracking open. Over the course of the past week, Sherlock had been slowly revealing more and more of himself to his friend. John couldn’t tell if it was a deliberate effort to give up the façade of “I’m fine” and let him in, or if Sherlock was just unable to bear the pain alone any longer. Perhaps, a bit of both. They had completed what clean-up and salvage they could in the dying light of the day. Sherlock stood before a cracked and taped window glaring at the dim street. His expression was morose and he was preternaturally still. Silence blanketed the room and John paused his final survey of the rubble to observe his friend. He cautiously approached him, a hairs breadth away.
“You seem sad.” Sherlock shot him a quick glance before turning to the view of the buzzing London street.
“I just made 2 cups of tea, Sherlock.”
“You want to get old….with me?” Sherlock’s hushed words sounded so hopeful and his voice sounded so small that John had to turn. He owed his best friend honesty in this conversation, whatever the outcome. The detective’s eyes were wide and he appeared somewhat shell-shocked—just as he had when John had told him that he was his best friend. John didn’t trust himself to speak, but managed a nod accompanied by a nervous,
“Come on, Sherlock, we’ve shared beds many times on cases, it’s not a problem. You need real sleep and you’re way too tall for the couch.”
“But, back then, when I was shot, I didn’t have anyone. I came home to an empty bedsit to recuperate alone. I could have died and it wouldn’t have mattered to anyone.” Sherlock shook his head.
“I love you, too,” the detective said in a deep rumble into his neck. “Now open that door so I can show you how much.” The doctor laughed aloud as they stumbled through the door, their lips finding each other quickly, just in time to shut the door before they wrapped around each other like vines.
“It’s ok,” I say quietly, warmly, giving him permission to be honest and open. John gave a small self-conscious huff of a laugh and then spoke again quickly, seemingly before he lost his courage on this anonymous winter night,
“He’s en route to you right now. He’s exhausted, John. He hasn’t slept at all since the incident and he won’t accept help.”
“Ok,“ he nodded, climbing under the covers on the opposite side of the bed. They lay facing one another. It didn’t take but a few moments before John was snoring lightly, once again. Sherlock tried to rest but he ruminated, his mind spinning over and over the events of the day. Their hands were mere inches apart. Sherlock gently covered John’s with his own, hoping it wouldn’t wake him. He took deep, even breaths, trying to block out the day’s events and focusing instead on the sensation of John’s warm skin against his own, the gentle rhythmic lull of his breath, the sensation of the duvet weighing on his body. John turned his hand over in his sleep, clasping Sherlock’s. Finally, the detective succumbed to Morpheus.
“Color!” John set her on the floor with her extra-large crayons while he cleared the table with Sherlock’s help.
“I understand, “ he backed slightly away from his friend, convulsively clearing his throat against the lump that had formed there and falling into a chasm that had opened up in his chest. It was completely understandable that Sherlock needed some time to himself—
“John, this is Sherlock’s decision,” Mycroft said quietly.
“Yeah, but less obstinate, which has us a little worried. He hasn’t called anyone names or yelled. I think his head hurts. He didn’t really want us to bother you at work, but asked me to let you know what happened. He didn’t say it, but I think he wants you here.”
I felt unusually inarticulate, but the sharp edge of these whispered truths left me feeling raw and vulnerable. I had never been laid so bare before another human and I floundered, clinging tightly to John’s hand as I attempted to slow my breathing.
“Sherlock, I can’t thank you enough for doing this.” The detective decided to avoid overt sentiment by brushing it off as an opportunistic deal for himself and replied with a slightly bored air.
“John,” Sherlock choked, his breath coming quickly as he fought tears and the deep aching need to hold his best friend. “Stay,” he pleaded. “Stay here, with Rosie. Don’t go back to your flat.” He quickly swiped his hand over his eyes and when he looked up, John’s eyes were ablaze with love and joy.
“I really need a tissue now.“ Sherlock briefly disappeared into the kitchen. He returned with a box of tissues. His arms felt cold and empty without John, but the catharsis he felt from their reconciliation overwhelmed the sensation of physical loss. He took a deep cleansing breath and smiled into John’s eyes. They were going to be OK.
“Hey. What’s wrong?” His friend made a pained grunt and dug his hands into his own unruly curls, elbows pressing into his knees, head hanging low. John propped himself up on his elbow, sliding a hand down his face, concerned. “Can’t sleep?” Sherlock’s voice is gravelly and agonized when he quietly responds,
“Are you sure you’re ready to live with a toddler, full time?” John joked. The detective’s eyes danced and he nodded,
“After Mary’s death, when we weren’t talking, I went through therapy. Intensive therapy for trauma.” John’s hand freezes in surprise and drops to the bed between them,
He walked aimlessly for about twenty minutes before finding himself in the park, staring at the lake. The air was crisp and cool, but sunny patches offered warm respite for walking mothers with busy toddlers, elderly couples and the occasional runner. John took deep, slow breaths, hopelessly trying to fill the chasm of emptiness in his gut. His heart ached with the thought of Sherlock’s absence, the thought of the detective returning to the very place that traumatized him, being captured, tortured again…perhaps not making it back this time. Every time he forced that last thought from his mind, it slammed back in, nearly taking him down each time. He closed his eyes against the onslaught of images—Sherlock in chains, Sherlock being whipped, Sherlock’s grave, Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock…..
Rosie! Despite my still spasming muscles, I moved quickly to the hall closet, extracted our extra blanket and vaulted up the stairs. I very quietly eased open the door to John and Rosie’s room, trying not to wake either of the snoring Watsons. I was relieved to find that it was slightly warmer in John’s room than it had been in my own. Gently, I placed the soft blue fleece over the sleeping two year old, tucking it in around her feet. I leaned over and tenderly kissed her head, warm against my lips, sparsely covered with fine blonde hair, and I worried about her cold ears. Should I try to slip a hat over her head? That would wake her and if she was sound asleep, she couldn’t be very uncomfortable. Unsure of what to do and not wanting to risk her falling ill, I gingerly sat at the edge of the John’s bed and placed a hand on his shoulder to wake him.
“You mean, we’d all go together and stay with your parents?”
“Oh, God, yes.”
“You really want us both there, Sherlock?” John asked, still quiet, sounding cautious. “Living with a baby is not—“
“I’m really sorry, Sherlock, I didn’t mean to wake you. I called you…automatically, without thinking,” he admitted, his voice still fractured. “I don’t even know what time it is.” John swung his legs out of bed, carrying the phone to the kitchen to make some tea. “Oh, god, it’s almost 3:00.”
“We were both going through a lot. You came with me to Sherrinford and that meant everything to me, John. Everything. It made up for any way in which you think you’ve wronged me. I would not have survived that without you. Just having you there by my side was---” I stopped to clear my throat again, my voice imbued with a deep undertones of regret. “Thank God I didn’t lose you in that well.”
“What if I didn’t want Thai tonight?” He teased.
“Rosie will be ok. We’ll bring things for her to do on the train and my parents can pick us up or send a car.”
“How many times am I going to have to watch you die?” he gasped between the repressed sobs that ripped from his chest.
“John, I know that you’re not—“ he closed his eyes briefly before continuing in a rough voice, “I just want you to know that I’m completely happy with whatever form this arrangement….um, our….relationship takes. While I’m completely amenable, I have absolutely no expectation that you—“ His awkward monologue was cut off as John pulled him down and crushed their lips together. They lingered, settling into the moment, lips moving ever so gently against one another, breathing each other’s air, before pulling apart.
“I didn’t bother to text since I knew brother dearest would be calling you.” He muttered as he slipped off his coat and collapsed, boneless, onto John’s couch with another deep sigh, head lolling back, eyelids dropping.  John had not heard as many sighs from the man in the past 5 years as he had in the past 5 days.
Friday afternoons at the surgery always felt interminable. Everyone was desperate to see a doctor at the last moment before the weekend. After his last patient at 5:30, John wanted nothing more than to collapse on the couch and have takeaway with Sherlock. His empty flat held no comfort and no appeal. The evening was gray and chilly, a nippy wind propelling newspapers and leaves down the street as he picked up Rosie and caught a cab to Baker St. He bustled his way into the hall and Mrs. Hudson rushed out of her flat, gushing over Rosie.
“I’m going to give her a bath and put her in bed, “John said, as he tugged Rosie’s bib from her neck and picked her up, carefully avoiding applesauce bombs.
“Won’t we wake her?” Sherlock looked over at Rosie.
“Hm, “ was his dissatisfied response. Molly called from downstairs,
“Yes, the crying and the talking. It’s how people grieve, Sherlock.” He tenderly added, “It’s human. I’ve been learning it myself and if there’s anything I’ve learned in the past four months, it’s that doing it alone makes it so much worse.”
The reconstruction of 221B was progressing, financed by Mycroft and requiring a great deal of somewhat tedious decision making. Before they ever discussed John’s return to Baker St (with Rosie, of course), Sherlock included him in all the decisions, as if they were building a home together. John was there frequently, Rosie in tow, visiting Mrs. Hudson (who adored the child) and helping with clean up and décor decisions. They kept it much the same, recreating what they had Before. Before used to refer to Before The Fall. Now, it was Before Euros. John pondered that and concluded that all relationships must have defining events. Theirs were of a rather unusual nature, but they had forged through them and were building a new life. Sherlock had returned to John’s house during the reconstruction. They continued to share a bed (though without intimacy), share their meals, and share parenting. John was surprised by how good his friend was with Rosie. He truly enjoyed being with her, spending time with her, discovering things with her. Sherlock’s own curiosity about the world was reflected in the baby’s sighs and squeals. He spoke to her like she was a small adult, taught her the physics of rainbows and the biology of bees. Despite themselves, they became fast friends. John hadn’t believed he could grow any fonder of the man, but his heart continued to expand. It seemed to be limitless.
“Your deduction skills are improving,” he teased, “Yes, it was The Queen, himself. He was giving me a progress report on the flat. They’ll be cleaning all day tomorrow and it will be livable starting tomorrow night.” The fleeting disappointment was barely discernable on Sherlock’s face, before he quickly wiped it clean with the standard mask of indifference. John had been mid-sip of wine and gulped audibly.
“Do that?” John smiled at Sherlock’s look of wonder.
After dinner, and bedtime for Rosie in her new crib upstairs, John and Sherlock sat in their chairs, sated, warm and content. John had poured them each a finger of whiskey that they were nursing.
“I’d do anything to help my brother.” The words caught John by surprise. It was as if they had taken on a life of their own and broken through Mycroft’s prim composure in a rare moment of desperate, urgent honesty. “I offered him medications, medicated teas, I offered to make an appointment with a good therapist, a vacation, time away, I offered to let him stay here as long as he wants. He doesn’t want any of it. He’s restless and irritable and smoking incessantly and….well, you know him, John. You know exactly how he is.”
“Always?” Sherlock whispered, nearly inaudible.
Faint early light filtered through the gauzy sitting room curtains. John sighed, pulling the warmth against his chest closer. A deep sound against his chest startled him out of his sleepy state and he became aware of his best friend pressed against him. A smile pushed its way onto his face as he deeply inhaled the very familiar scent of lavender and musk shampoo and cigarettes. The ache and stiffness in his neck, however, elicited a moan.
Once back at the house, John had to pay the babysitter. Rosie was already asleep in her room. John offered Sherlock the first shower while he made some tea. He dug out an old shirt and boxers for Sherlock to wear and slipped into the shower himself, after placing a hot mug into Sherlock’s tremulous hands. Sherlock had been quiet thus far and John assumed that his friend had a great deal to sort through. Sherlock would talk when he felt ready. John toweled his hair, feeling fresh but still tired, despite his nap in the car. When he walked into the kitchen, he was greeted by the sight of his best friend leaning over the counter, shoulders shaking in an attempt to contain his sorrow. It was inevitable. Everyone has their breaking point.
“I knew you would have it all under control.  You do have it under control, don’t you?”  The first hint of worry creeps into his voice.
Today we are alone though.  The wind is strong and the sky a steel grey and it is threatening to rain by the time we reach the rise, where we can stand catching our breath from the walk.
“Oh, of course.”  He says absently, then scrunches his eyebrows as he notices the scars partner.  “Jesus.  There is another one on the other side.”
“Metal cuffs.”  I explain.  His scrutiny is beginning to weigh on me.
“Did you talk about it afterwards?  When you had both calmed down.”
By the time Mycroft comes back, Sherlock is more settled.  He is curled up on his side with his eyes crinkled shut.  He won’t allow me to pull the blanket back over him properly, but it is covering him to the waist at least.  I’ll try to get the heating turned up a bit.
“Go to bed.  You can hardly keep your eyes open.”
“The light was so bright.”  I say.  He freezes in place with his back turned and his hand on the doorknob.  “It was on all the time.  Day and night.  They wouldn’t let me sleep or even lie down.  I was kept standing up but hunched over so that I was never able to get comfortable.”
Settling back, I watch his silhouette through the stained-glass windows in the front door.  He leans on his cane to unlace his boots.  Bending down causes him to start coughing so taking his shoes off takes longer than it otherwise would.  He places them on the edge of the step where the sun will shine on them once it comes all the way up.  Turning back, he opens the door slowly and quietly, slipping his thin frame through the smallest gap.  He must not realise I’m waiting for him in the sitting room.  He must think I’m in bed asleep.  He thinks that he has gotten away with his all-night escapade in the fields.  Not very often, but sometimes he is wrong.
Oh god, that’s not the bit I was talking about.
She scoffs a little laugh.  “Um, I just knew, I guess.  Why, John?  What’s going on?  Having a sexuality crisis?”
I cannot see his hands beneath the bubble that glisten on the surface of the water but I can certainly feel it when both his hands drift down and encircle my cock.  Barely touching me.  A whisper of a touch.  Blood and arousal flow faster than his movements.
“Is this really important?”  Sherlock asks.
“It’s been a long time since someone touched me without... violence.”  I say as I lay back down on my stomach.
Well at least that clears up my uncertainties about whether John is staying here tonight.  It had seemed possible that he might make a run for it after last night.  I am unsure what this means for sleeping arrangements.  I was more comfortable sleeping in his room than I have been anywhere for a very long time.  Maybe that was just the sleeping pills, or was it the change of scenery or was it John’s calming presence?  Too many variables changed at one time.  Very poor way to gather data.
Proofread as always by  Lockedinjohnlock, who deserves extra love and sprinkles this week.  If there are mistakes herein, they're my bad.
Sherlock smiled.  He felt drawn into John’s gaze.  Later, he realised that his actions were a reflection of what John gave him.  At the time, he struggled to fit words to his thoughts at all.  Blindly, he reached for John, who sat back on the top of Sherlock’s thighs.  The movement pressed their cocks together.
“Okay,” John said. He smiled and followed Sherlock out of the bedroom. It wasn’t a bad sight at all.
Nathan Drake responded quickly to Piero’s text and offered John and Sherlock, under their assumed names, a slot at three that afternoon.  It was a little sooner than they expected.  They went to a pub for lunch to decide what sexual problem to choose to discuss with Drake.
.  “I found out last week that Colin goes to Langridge’s,” Sherlock said.   John hadn’t expected to hear the truth and he flinched when Sherlock stroked his arm.  He wondered if a punch qualified as a caress.
“So, with his views on his own sexuality and his fears regarding his career, I think we can deduce that he killed Liverson to keep him quiet. And, because of his twisted ideas of homosexuals, despite being one, he would likely not see killing Liverson as a bad act, per se.  Any other connections?”
Daniels looked at the agent. He shushed his tiny colleague despite Daniels having his elbow against his throat to restrict his ability to breathe. “Like I’d trust anything one of your fucking spooks said,” Daniels said.  “I’m going to kill the little one first.”
“God, yes, I want you, Stephen.”
“Unlikely,” Sherlock replied.  “An international gangster would tell us to back off in a more sophisticated manner.”  He pulled his phone out of his jacket pocket, swiped and jabbed at the screen.  John heard ringing; Sherlock had put the phone on speaker.  Mycroft replied before Sherlock said a word.
Sherlock was used to not sleeping much when he was involved with a case.  Somehow, the continuance and constancy of his mental processes seemed to arrive at a resolution far faster than the off-and-on repetitiveness of prescribed times to be awake or asleep.   Many of his hours of thought were, in their own way, an approximation of a restful state like meditation which, in Sherlock’s opinion, was just as useful as sleep for restoring peak mental faculties.
“People often are.  Whilst all this is fascinating, I fail to see why you’re here telling me this.” Mycroft leant back in his chair.   He opened the envelope and shuffled through the contents until he noticed a photograph.  “Oh, I see.”
“You have until I drink this tea, John, to tell me anything else you need me to know. I don’t know how long I can stop myself from touching you.” Sherlock took a big mouthful of tea; it was hot, but it was bearable. John would need to talk fast.
John chose that moment to close his mouth over Sherlock’s real penis.  Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed. Both of them wore Caucasian-flesh-coloured pants beneath their harnesses and fake cocks.   John’s mouth moistened the material over the head of Sherlock’s cock and he lightly blew over it.
"If you use a nozzle for your shower head, only use it at low-pressure.”
“Think of very, very unsexy things. Like Mycroft in spandex.”
Later, they visit Lestrade to full in the details of Daniels' arrest and they discuss their next steps.  Sherlock knows Daniels has accomplices, but who are they and where do they fit?
Assist the police with their enquiries.
“Where’s the soap?”
That would, of course, be the moment that Mycroft walked into the room.
“I’ll be in touch,” Mycroft said. John hung up and swung his daughter into his arms.
The CCTV monitoring room seemed even smaller than it was last time John saw it.  Donovan puttered around in the corridor, eyes focused on her phone.   She gave John a brief wave.
“Told you we’d just get filthy,” John whispered.
Mary hadn’t removed her clothes. She’d just taken John’s Alpha dildo out of his hand and began to fuck him with it, none to gently.
“I don’t want to be crude, but has he done stuff before?  Rosie, angel, don’t paint with it.”
Sherlock walked over to this chair and looked at the Doubles card on the armrest. Candlar would cancel it now. All attempts to visit the club discretely would be lost.  Sherlock picked up his mobile. It was time to call in a favour.
“I thought Scrabble?”
“Perfectly,” Sherlock answered.
Nathan nodded. He looked at Sherlock.  “Why do you think you have these problems?”
John nodded.
“Woo-hoo!”
John opened an eye.  Anthrax was good at pole dancing.  He spun in a wide arc, the pole gripped firmly between his knees.
Sherlock mirrored of John’s steps, keeping his legs slightly flexed, until they reached the bathroom. John called a halt when they were next to the bath.
“Sherlock, for God’s sake, I…” The phone went dead. Sherlock was gone. “I love you,” John whispered.
Ian left and Sherlock had gone upstairs to retrieve his shirt.
Thanks to Lockedinjohnlock for proof-reading. Any other mistakes that remain are mine.
Then, yesterday, Lestrade told me that someone handed themselves in for it. A bloke called Pero or Piro or something.”
A loving start gives was to Sherlock having a rough night and a complete strop or two.  Mycroft drops a clanger and the boys prepare for the big sting operation at Langridge's.
There's a lot of description of the layout of the Blackout room and associated areas here. I hope it's clear. It's really not that important; we're going to revisit the Blackout room mostly. However, if you need to picture it, let me know and I will attempt to draw up a plan.
“How?”
John and Sherlock left.  Lestrade followed.  John caught his eye and suppressed a laugh until Lestrade started to giggle. Mycroft found them in the corridor, clutching either the walls or their stomachs, having dissolved into fits of laughter.  He rolled his eyes, tutted and left them, which, of course, made them laugh even more.
John’s eyes rolled back in his head, he cried out and came against Sherlock’s cock. The added lube and the visual of John’s beatific expression did for Sherlock too.
“Indeed,’ Sherlock agreed. “Pimps often do.”
It was almost eleven o’clock when Simon Turner arrived at 221B Baker Street. It was as clear to John as it was to Sherlock that he had not slept.  When John opened the door, he took two steps in and sagged into John’s open arms.  It seemed that the tears, at least, were used up last night.  His red-rimmed eyes failed to focus, and he seemed drawn and empty.
“You’re very calm,” John replied. “I’m impressed.”
“Sure.”  John looked down and nodded.  Sherlock moved back in for a kiss and started on the buttons. He aimed to remove the shirt without revealing too much of John’s body.  When all the buttons where undone, Sherlock swung a leg over John’s and sat in his lap, so their chests were together.  Even though Nathan saw some flesh, Sherlock was confident he’d shielded much of John’s scar from prying eyes.  John stroked the bones of Sherlock’s vertebrae with his fingers and nuzzled against his neck.  John relaxed against him.  “I like this,” John said running his fingertips down Sherlock’s side, which made him squirm.
I pause.  I am not doing a good job of this.  I swallow.  It sticks in my throat.
“Nope.  I don’t think so.”  He smiles slightly, but he also looks slightly confounded.
He shrugs, and his hands move again.  One sliding perfectly along my cock, the other running up my side and then thumbing at a nipple.
“And your partner, you mentioned drug use…”
“Never.  Just observant.”
“That was bloody amazing.”  I tell him.  Even after all this time; the creativity of the Holmes brothers is startling.  I kick myself for not thinking of a better way to assess Sherlock.
“I’m listening.  Carry on with your lecture.  I won’t stop you.”
John smiles at that.  He looks tired too.
“Jesus Christ, John.” He says under his breath.  “What did you shoot him with, a bloody canon?”
It’s that night at around one am, we are forced to make a visit to my surgery.
I have serious trepidation about this, but what can I say?  ‘John you can’t wash my hair because I was tortured and now, I’m scared of getting my face wet.  Oh, it was, like, over five years ago and I just never bothered to mention it.’  No, better to just keep my mouth shut.  I’ve been doing better; I’ve hardly thought about it in ages and I trust John.  It will be ok.
“Are you ok?”  He asks me.  “It is alright if you don’t want to.”
He frowns.  I know he has a hard time with what Mary did.  I direct his attention away from it.
I had been with Lestrade all day and we visited seemingly every taxi company in Greater London.  None of the employees had schedules that matched up with his attacks.
By day, I search for him.  Circling like a shark, getting closer, homing in on his vibrations.  But always missing.  There is something I’m not understanding.  I know that he is between 186 centimetres and 197 centimetres tall, over 90 kilograms and has a size 12 shoe.  He most likely lives within the confines of London Orbital Motorway or just outside and that he works in a profession that requires a lot of driving.  Courier, taxi driver or something.
“Clearly.”
“Ok.  No curry.”  He says, much to my appreciation.  “What do you feel like?”
Sherlock stands, goes to brush past me into the kitchen.  I can almost see him rebuilding the walls around himself and I am unsure that I should say what I am thinking.  I grab his wrist lightly, just enough of a touch to halt his flight.  He stops stiffly beside me.  I know, with instant clarity that what I want to say is true, but I am not sure how it will be received if I point it out.  I must act quickly, or I will lose the chance.  I lift my chin and swallow.  Decide that courage is something to strive for and that I am nothing if I lose my nerve now.
