"Good." Steve diverted his eyes back to the paper, because Tony’s pose was way too suggestive. He hoped his flushing cheeks weren’t visible under the fluorescent lights.
They weren't out, as the kids these days called it. Still, Tony didn't care if people found out about their relationship. Well, the public specifically, all the Avengers and the people higher up the food chain knew already. They hadn't announced it - there hadn’t been the need to do so. It had happened when Tony and Steve had appeared in the kitchen right after FRIDAY had told them Ross was on the line. The Avengers had all rolled their eyes or shouted something similar to
The first person Steve's eyes had sought out was Tony. The billionaire looked at him in astonishment, then smiled fondly at him. Steve would have wept for joy if it weren't for their present company. For so long he had yearned to see that smile, he couldn't believe his eyes.
First of all I would like to thank all the readers who had the patience and waited years for this story to be finished. Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me.
"I went out... to the park," Steve clarified unhelpfully.
Steve shifted his attention to Pepper Potts. The woman was making her way towards them with the police, obviously explaining their situation. She squeezed Tony's fingers in support when she was close enough, but didn't comment. Vision was still floating silently beside Steve.
Steve winced at the first exclamation. "Language?"
Tony focused back on the wheelchair in his line of sight. He brought his tools closer and got to work. However, it didn't matter how many hours Tony spent in the workshop, half of his focus kept straying towards the big screen and Steve's face which was still there for him to glance at.
"Did you know you're glowing with pride and happiness when you talk about something you love?" Tony turned to Steve, but Steve was pretty sure he couldn't see much in the darkness.
Tony stood in the middle of a gathering of rich people, intermittently conversing with someone but most of the time stealing glances at Steve across the room. They shared agonizing looks every five minutes.
"Maybe it wasn't my best idea after all," the super soldier confessed.
"Be careful."
Steve pressed his forehead to Tony's. He felt defeated, at a loss as to how to reply to that. He needed to trust Tony. The billionaire knew himself better than anyone else, but still, there was another thing to address. "You should know that I don't feel any pressure from you. I'm just---" Steve swallowed. "---cautious."
Steve's heart picked up its pace again, because he was suddenly aware of all the people in the room staying quiet and listening to his every word. The power he had was frightening. Tony repeatedly reminded him that he was a national icon, and it finally dawned on Steve as well. The nation listened to him. "The friend I have is not considering himself in any question. He's always thinking about others."
The manual labor helped clear Tony's mind and at the same time gave him a chance to process his conversation with Steve. He was aware something had changed between them. He just couldn't put his finger on what it was precisely yet. His mind obsessively dwelled on
"Dummy, pass me the soda from the refrigerator. FRIDAY, show me the footage of the security camera from the moment Rogers entered here." Tony sat in his chair, messily eating the food, napkins forgotten. The screen changed to the image of him and Steve.
"Tony, they tried to kill you." Steve looked at him seriously. "I will rip them apart. Each and every one of them if I have to."
Tony burst into laughter as he saw Steve's rapidly blushing face.
"He’s your friend. The person you trust the most and can be yourself around. I don't want him in harm's way. You don’t trust the Avengers anymore."
"FRIDAY, place an order for a dozen high definition security cameras." Tony came up with an absolutely brilliant plan. He was a technological genius, after all, and as that genius, he was now on a mission. What was invading of privacy between friends? "The smallest you can find," Tony added quickly.
"Always so selfless," Tony muttered.
What was so wrong with Anthony Edward Stark that the people he cared for always ended up trying to kill him? What was so unlovable about him that they always either left him alone or chose someone else? He knew his intelligence intimidated others, that his confidence in his abilities was often seen as arrogance, that he could be abrasive, and that his near-constant talking could be annoying, but did he really deserve this permanent cycle of abandonment and betrayal?
out of your sight, I will go."
Tony stared at the image of Steve's face until the anger slowly slipped away. Due to the detail of Steve's concern, he couldn't get yesterday's conversation out of his head. Well, not the conversation per se. That one moment when Tony had been absolutely sure Steve Rogers had looked at his lips and thought about kissing him.
Steve felt a small pang of jealousy. Tony and Vision were both looking at each other for a heartbeat longer, and even if it was without another word, the gesture still held more significance than any verbal communication could have. The second Vision phased away and Tony looked Steve's way, he quickly shifted his eyes away from them.
"Trusting you with my body is a piece of cake, soldier. You know that."
"I know." Steve carefully put his palm on the side of Tony's throat, where he felt a wildly beating pulse. He would do anything to keep Tony's trust.
"You fucker! Shut the fuck up!"
"I’m fine," Steve replied, his tired face full of pain. The super soldier had enough energy to drape an arm around Tony's shoulders and continue his journey to the bathroom.
God, it was so easy for T'Challa to talk about things that were killing Tony inside.
Unfortunately yes, Steve knew that. It had been the main reason why he tried to never physically overpower Tony. All too clearly, he remembered Tony's flashback when Steve had protected him against the metal spider robots. How could he be so selfish as to crave Tony underneath him while knowing at the same time how it would scare the man? Something was seriously wrong with him!
"---I scared him, Nat." He whispered defeatedly. "He was terrified, of me. I saw it in his face." He couldn’t bear her gentle gaze anymore; he didn’t deserve it, and he squeezed his eyes shut in shame.
I would like to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.

"Yes, dear," Tony smirked jokingly with a raised eyebrow, but all the humor couldn’t erase the hurt expression in Steve’s eyes. Tony knew very well why those careless words hurt his super soldier. Steve believed they didn't mean anything. Steve believed Tony would never give the feelings between them any chance.
Tony's breath halted at the realization of the truth in Steve's words. He was right. If the choice were to be between the Avengers and T'Challa, Tony would most definitely go and save T'Challa first. Yeah, he would probably die in an attempt to save the hypothetical Avenger, but still--- "What about the Avengers? You don't want their protection either?"
"Probably true, but you won't show him you're a changed man by sitting here." Natasha squeezed his forearm in a friendly gesture, getting up again, and a moment later, was already out of his sight.
"The brakes are good," Rhodey mumbled.
Tony headed steadily to the elevator. "And find me some good songs, I need to listen to something with a beat. It's time to do some work. How are my bots? Everything alright?"
Steve watched Rhodes blink tears out of his eyes. "You made me a new suit with a chair," the disabled man whispered tightly, obviously full of emotions.
"Alright, to the sewers we shall go," Tony decided with an unsettled stomach. He didn't jump for joy over the idea. "FRIDAY, keep me updated. Hawkeye, you’re the eyes on the streets."
"I'm talking about Wanda. Ultron." Steve continued without a pause. "She enchanted you, but we blamed you no less." Steve didn't know if he should touch Tony or rather stay away from him right now, because the tension in his body was way too familiar. Tony looked like a coiled snake ready to attack any moment.
"Captain Rogers, I'm to inform you that everything is ready," FRIDAY interrupted their long eye contact.
Tony was glad the AI remembered who was the boss here. With a glare, Tony turned to Rhodey: "You're overstaying your welcome. Come back later. If you have anything to complain about, make a list."
At the time, he’d thought it was a good decision; he could incapacitate the suit and end the fight without any of them getting more injured. But with a few days’ distance, Steve realized he should never have swung the shield down. Not into Iron Man's chest. Not into the reactor. Bucky had already damaged it and Steve could have killed Tony by accident.
"He has a fever which means his body is finally fighting the poison. It's a defense mechanism as if he'd contracted the flu. His body is basically burning the poison. He's fine," Bruce nodded with a reassuring expression.
"Almost," Tony mumbled, eyes shifting to the floor. "How did you know about the situation?"
"Show me in high definition. Zoom in on his face," Tony flinched when his line of vision was suddenly filled with a soda can. "Thanks, Dummy." He worked the lid off with dirty fingers, took a long swing from the can and watched. "Play it."
that way."
"For my genius brain, I would certainly say I'm an idiot, because tonight was the first time that it finally clicked for me. You were talking about me that way."
Steve was now monitoring his eating habits as well, not only his sleeping schedule? Why the hell couldn't Tony say a word?
"Where is he!" Tony's tone didn't invite any arguments. Logically, he understood that he had no reason to be worried, but at the same time, HYDRA had been silent for too long already, and they could be long gone with Steve or could have left him to die somewhere in the city.
"Stop." Tony made a hand gesture.
Tony reminded himself he also had to repair Steve's shield. It still bore the claw marks from T'Challa. Tony's primary Iron Man suit needed to be functional as well. The recent event with the metallic spiders had proven that the suit was necessary.
It was then that Vision materialized through Tony's body beside Steve. "I beg to differ, Captain Rogers."
part will be actually in action."
Tony watched as Steve seated himself as well and lifted the stainless steel cover from their food. They both laughed when they saw the appetizers - rice had been stylishly arranged into a word:
Except there were no more Avengers. Vision floated aimlessly, without cheer. Rhodey couldn't leave the Compound, even if he wanted to. Natasha was gone; Tony didn't want her nearby in case Ross incarcerated her too, and king T'Challa was back in Wakanda. When the dust had settled, they were no longer the Avengers. They were just fools.
"You both figured it out too late. Too many things have happened." T'Challa rested his fingers on Tony's forearm. "Due to your bond it's now even harder to make peace with your past mistakes."
That piece of royal ass had the audacity to smile at Tony all knowingly. Eventually, Tony jumped to his feet and helped his friend up from the concrete as well. "Thanks."
"Sorry, Vision, I can't. Not now." Tony backed away towards the food table and bar in the corner. As much as he had missed the android, he wasn't strong enough to hear his voice. "Double Scotch," he ordered with his eyes shifting to the side, making sure Vision really let him go.
And Steve had gone and almost crushed Tony's chest. Oh God.
"I don't need your permission." Rhodey wheeled in with a satisfied grin. "I'm the golden boy who has access to every chamber in this castle, including yours, remember?"
But then, in the blink of an eye, Tony shifted on the chair, sat more appropriately and released Steve from his longing gaze. He could finally breathe again.
"Nothing would make me happier, Boss," she replied sarcastically, obviously reluctant and as far from happy as one could be in her situation.
Re-post 11/2017 with Rebecca's edits
"JESUS FUCK, ROGERS!" In the darkness, Steve saw Tony jerking into a seated position. "What the fuck are you doing? Trying to give me a heart attack?"
"More like you're reading a different book. In a different house. In a different country. Probably somewhere in Europe, halfway across the world from me," Steve mumbled, confused. He shook his head. "I don't feel any pressure."
"Hi."
Again, I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
Steve had been already hurt enough in Tony's opinion.
From the corner of his eye, Steve saw Natasha studying his profile, the way he kept his eyes averted, how much he didn't want her to see him like this. After a long pause, she nodded with a sigh. "Oh. You finally figured it out."
"No. But then he attacked Bucky, who hadn’t been in control when he killed Tony’s parents, and the jerk was barely fighting back. I thought Tony was going to kill him, Nat, and Bucky is innocent," he pleaded, trying to make her understand the whole terrible situation. "I jumped in to protect Bucky without even thinking." Steve chewed his lip, then sighed. "We made such a mess of everything, and I don't know if we’ll ever be able to recover from that. There’ve just been too many words, too many blows, too many misunderstandings. Do you really think it’s possible for us to be how we were before?"
Thank you for reading. :)
"I know. But you said it yourself, at least we have something to look forward to after the Gala." Steve winked at him and closed the door behind them.
"Oh, shut up. You're just milking my gratitude," Tony smirked. He handed the expensive suit jacket to his friend. "The dry-cleaning bill is on me."
Tony's brain couldn't focus. His body betrayed his every move. Every sensation seemed to be new and more intense than anything he had experienced before. He was almost afraid how it would feel to deepen the kiss. And to hell with everything, this was not an innocent peck at all, because Tony wanted to let loose and get lost in the sensation.
"Is that wrong of me, Boss?" FRIDAY's unsure voice made Tony think about his question again. He knew his AI sometimes needed guidance and didn't want to disappoint him. He could always count on her being on his side of things, but it suddenly looked like she changed her mind about Steve. She wasn't as vicious as before. She sure as hell was still giving him a hard time and was evidently evading his questions, but something had changed for her.
Tony wanted to go home. If not home, than somewhere (preferably a very dark supply closet) where he could at least kiss the super soldier and make the evening more bearable. He was aware of Natasha standing somewhere to his left. Clint made a game of exchanging angry glares with people who came near him on his right.
Tony slept for almost fourteen hours with astonishing peacefulness of fitful sleep. The nightmares eased thanks to his exhaustion. Some might say it was due to his conversation with Steve, but he didn't want to admit the fact to himself. He wasn't that far down the road as to give the Captain Perfect that much credit. No one would make him admit that.
God, were those tears in Steve's eyes? Tony could hardly breathe. His own misted eyes burned. The silence between them was frightening. What did it mean?
"Are you ok?" Tony leaned forward to get a better look into Steve's face. He looked exhausted and very much
"You could have died, and you're telling me to mind my words?" Tony was now full on his warpath. All his fear had been channeled into anger. His heart couldn't take another incident like before when someone had tried to kill Steve. "What if HYDRA agents were watching the Tower? What if they're waiting for the right moment to snatch you off the street and do some more experiments with that poison? Or kill you?" Tony's voice broke. "You could---" He cut himself off and took a deep breath. Steve could have ordered anything to be delivered to their Tower online. "You could---" Tony tried again as he helplessly watched Steve come towards him.
"If you say so, Boss. But I have footage of its existence with JARVIS, and as a matter of fact, it didn't look very funny."
Tony could almost feel his bubble of happiness slowly leaking out. One small piece would be back, but the bigger one  was still missing forever. His JARVIS. He deliberately kept his mind as far away as possible from thinking about Vision. Tony could exist with the idea of his life being in pieces, but Vision talking to him as JARVIS was one heartbreak too much. Anyway, Butterfingers wasn't the only thing he needed to work on.
Steve turned the notebook over to him. The sketch was of Tony in a very private moment, while the man was sleeping. Steve spent hours lying in bed, watching Tony sleep and wondering how life could be so easy. He had Tony's face memorized to the smallest detail. The tiny smile on Tony's sensual lips. Tony's relaxed eyebrows, giving him the appearance of a much younger man. Tony's soft eyelashes creating shadows on his face under the moonlight.
"No!" Steve interrupted him forcefully and came closer. He didn't let Tony finish his sentence. He had heard it before. Everyone had always left Tony behind. That flippant statement would always be Tony's universal answer for everything. In the past, this had usually been the moment Tony snapped and started an angry tirade. Steve wanted to believe those days were over and they had put all that behind them.
Ok. That was good. A mountain of rocks fell off Tony’s chest.
With a few strokes on the keypad, the door fell open and Tony took a careful step inside. The only thing in these quarters which he hadn’t bought remained an old framed photograph of Steve and Bucky in their uniforms.
"I have to change at least, Steve." Tony really didn't want to be the one to ruin their first date by wearing terrible clothes. No one had ever prepared a dinner for him before. This was too important. Tony’s heart started to beat in a panicky pace because he needed at least a proper suit for this.
Steve stared at his fists where they rested on his knees as if they were the most interesting thing in the world. It took a moment for him to force out the words.
"---about the mind control."
"I am not aware of the progress in their investigation, Boss."
"Don’t know, don’t care. There has to be something they missed," Tony replied distractedly. He flew several rounds over the area with zero results. "FRIDAY, give me visual from the invasion. We need to know where they came from. Did S.H.I.E.L.D. find something useful on their bodies?"
"Things went south with Tony?"
Steve squared his shoulders and continued, "The friend I have is doing everything in his power to assure all the Avengers have their rights like any other person in this country. The Tony I know is the man who is allowing the Avengers into his home and, without batting an eye, offering them everything he owns. And he's doing everything without wanting anything back. "
"Don't know what you're talking about, Rhodeybear. I thought you would be happy. It will be easier for you to navigate in the labyrinth of our secret lair with that chair." Tony carefully worked on his matter-of-fact tone. "FRIDAY, show me the access code for Butterfingers. We have to do something with him."
"Well, esthetics are important. And you do know that the whole building is powered by an arc reactor, right? But, sure, make fun of your home." Tony's attention turned back to the monitors. "Come back later."
In the meantime of his mental breakdown, Steve steered Tony into their bedroom. Tony closed his eyes in defeat as he saw all the lighted candles around the room, rose petals covering their bed. FRIDAY started playing some soft music from the built-in speakers.
Tony's shoulders hunched in defeat, not expecting the chuckle that escaped him. He sat down on the concrete floor with his back to the roof's edge. "He told me he loved me. Well, not specifically told me. It was more of a confirmation of the---"
"Are you really surprised?"
"I need to go, Steve. I need to find out what happened. I need to know who wants you dead." That was his only purpose now that Steve was out of danger.
Tony shrugged shamelessly. "Payback's a bitch, huh? Think about it next time you try and go
Tony was just hoping the ground would finally open up and swallow him. He still didn't have the courage to look at Steve. Of course he would be the one to ruin their night. No one had ever made so much effort for him. And what would Steve be getting in exchange? Sweatpants. A stained tank top. Motor oil under Tony's fingernails. Probably some dirty smears on his face as well. Hair sticking in all directions from Tony's frustrated fingers running through it all day. He really was one
He shook his head, looking at the chandelier on the ceiling and trying to make sense of what had just happened. Everyone else’s attention was on Natasha who was ripping her long robe to thigh length. Tony hadn’t even seen Vision phase through the people, but now Natasha was reaching for him as he flew above their heads to the shattered window.
When Tony's eyes made contact with Vision, the android inclined his head minimally in acknowledgement. "I shall go back and inform King T'Challa and FRIDAY you are unharmed."
Steve didn't leave Tony a moment to argue, he steadily held his gaze and for the first time told him the truth. "When you're near me, I want you so much closer it scares me. When you're kissing me, I want to press you so close your bones might break."
"Team Captain?" Steve was momentarily confused before his gears kicked in. "You mean in the Civil War?" The question coaxed a small smile from the young man.
"That’s not it. Choose someone else. Anyone else."
Steve's lips were so close; he could almost taste his own desperation to close the distance on his tongue. Kissing Steve would be the worst idea Tony had ever had, but in that second, he couldn't remember why for the life of him.
about this kiss. Tony released a trembling breath into Steve's mouth. Where were his famous cockiness and ease when he needed them the most?
"What a surprise." Tony smirked. "They should have hired someone else for the job. I told them it's not an easy task to find the Strongest Avenger."
Steve went with the easiest option, telling the truth. "We talked, explained our different opinions. We should be able to work together again better." There. Natasha had to be happy he didn't lie and she could go home and leave him to his thoughts.
Tony knew very well what it meant. They all had wanted to actively hunt HYDRA’s agents before, but Tony hadn't let them. Now those agents had successfully pissed Steve off, and he was taking charge again.
"And yet you still love him," T'Challa interrupted Tony's tirade.
"Do you understand? I hate Wanda. Ok, maybe hate is a much stronger word than I should be using, but I don't care about her. She's with Vision, fine. She's an Avenger, fine. I don't have to lead her. That's your job, not mine. I'm fine with everything else. It's in the past."
"The order never happened," FRIDAY explained, obviously satisfied with herself.
Steve's heart skipped a beat when Tony's gaze traveled from the picture to his face. Those were Tony's bedroom eyes. Steve felt the heat in that look; it had never failed to cause a response in his body.
Steve's words cut Tony deeply, but he didn't move at all. After a second, the super soldier looked back at him.
"Keep the flower," he instructed him softly.
Winked. Tony's brain halted. He had fucking
"You have to wake up every morning and eat your breakfast with people who tried to hurt you. People you have called friends at some point in time. I can't even imagine what that feels like."
"You expected something else?"
"Captain Rogers, how are you feeling?" Vision, probably the most innocent of them all, asked without any idea what was happening between his comrades.
"FRIDAY told me. She saw a few seconds from the show's preview, but then it was interrupted and they changed the program. Safe bet something was going on," Rhodes smirked. "I couldn't stay at home so we just decided to do something out of your handbook and made a reckless decision," he grinned, and that was all it took for Tony to smile back with pride.
It took some time, but Tony finally understood.
He was hopelessly embarrassed, because Tony knew the truth. "Sorry," Steve breathed with difficulty.
"Can someone take a picture?" Sam asked when Tony passed him. Unfortunately, Tony held precious cargo in his arms and couldn't punch him.
Tony waited for a long time before he started to speak again. His anger had calmed thanks to T'Challa's silence. "Did you see the way he looked at me?"
"I trust you." Tony took his face between his palms, not giving Steve any chance to avert his eyes or back off. "I trust you with my battered heart." The following silence between them emphasized the significance of the moment.
"Hm," Tony made an unspecified noise. He sat down in front of his computers, fingers on the keyboard as he was idly searching the angles of security cameras in the Tower. At the same time, he watched another black screen from the corner of his eye where he could track Rhodey's progress on the reflecting surface. It wasn't easy for his friend to switch places.
After a rejuvenating shower with his thoughts still going back to the way Steve looked with raw honesty written on his face, Tony slipped into his gray sweatpants and white tank top and headed for his workshop. It was time to do something productive, and thinking about Steve was not supposed to occupy his precious time.
Repost: 13.11.2017 with the corrections from my new lovely beta reader Rebecca.
He did everything that was necessary. The smiles. The waves to the public. The cheerful attitude. But for fuck's sake, what kind of idiot was he? Tony mentally groaned. He had wanted to figure Steve out so badly, to understand his motives, but he had never expected
Steve was breathing fast, his chest tight with remembered fear for Bucky. "I lost it, then." His voice sounded strangled, and he would have clenched his hands in his hair and groaned, but he couldn’t show that much weakness, not even in front of Natasha. Instead, he merely clenched his fists until the knuckles stood out white against the skin and forced himself to keep speaking.
"No." Tony shook himself and placed the letter next to the picture frame. No matter how much time passed, he still saw Steve's face in his dreams, killing him, lying to him, betraying him. Worst of all was that even after everything they had gone through, their years as both teammates and friends, when Tony had most needed Steve’s friendship and trust, Steve had chosen the Winter Soldier over Tony, had cared more for the murderer of Tony's parents than their son.
Tony's heart was beating under his fingers now, but it was those same hands  Steve had used to push the shield down to crush the glass of the arc reactor. Steve felt like his stomach might rebel any second. Christ, he had almost torn the vulnerable skin and shoved the artificial bone right into Tony's heart. He could have killed him.
The moment they touched the roof of the hotel, Tony acted his part as was expected of him. He had a blinding smile on his face, complimented every staff member they encountered, used his motor mouth and talked nonsense all the time they were in public, because that was what Pepper and the others expected.
"I know you won’t. God, if there is a stronger person who has withstood so many bad things I would be surprised. But I don't ever again want to put you into a position where I can physically hurt you."
Tony sat gingerly on the bed. "Nothing. HYDRA wants you hurt or dead, but we don't know where they're hiding," he murmured. He watched Steve without further words. Tony couldn't imagine what he would have done had HYDRA been successful. He didn't want to imagine his life without Steve in it.
"Ok. Cancel the order." Tony's shoulders sagged. He had to be more creative. After all, he was a genius.
Tony frowned upon hearing the amused tone of his AI. "Who bothers with counting the hours of my sleeping schedule?"
"Looking at me that way," he said softly. They were thankfully alone again, so no one could overhear their conversation.
Tony's brain must have taken a vacation for a few minutes, because when he finally looked at his friend, T'Challa had folded his black jacket neatly and put it on the roof's edge. "What are you doing?"
"As you wish. What about Captain Rogers?"
. Steve would never look at him that way. He could lie to himself as much as he wanted, and it still didn’t alter the truth.
They had been able to track some of the spider robots in the sewers, but they didn't lead them to the main base. Someone - a lot of someones - had released the spider robots in several parts of Manhattan. Nobody had seen anything, even the surveillance had been tempered with. FRIDAY could pinpoint the second that had happened but was unable to find the culprits. Fucking HYDRA agents!
a kiss. Nothing more. An innocent peck on the lips.
"Captain Rogers has asked repeatedly about your health, Boss. You were in your rooms for too long for his liking, and he had appeared to be concerned."
"I don't," he breathed out quickly. His mind stuttered in disbelief, but Steve didn't stop yet.
Tony silently thanked God for the opportunity to have another chance with Steve. Sometimes, he still woke up sweating, scared out of his mind to find Steve's body maimed and the man he loved dead.
"So you say, but even the kid in the TV studio knew better," Tony goaded him.
Tony landed near a manhole, flipped the lid away and looked down into the darkness. Not a very promising sight. Then, Black Panther appeared beside him without any noise. As much as Tony wanted to say he was surprised, he really wasn’t.
That was a lie. Tony had stayed behind in New York, working his butt off to enable Rhodey to walk again. Tony had nearly killed himself with press conferences and public appearances in his desperation to convince the public that the Avengers weren't a threat, pushing himself until he almost collapsed from exhaustion, despite the injuries he had sustained in Siberia. Tony was the one who was grieving his parents’ death all over again, the wound of their loss having been violently ripped open, bleeding as badly as it had the morning when the police had told Tony the devastating news. Tony was always the one standing alone against the world. What a noble thing for Steve to give him the Avengers.
"FRIDAY---" Steve started barely audible, then cleared his throat and began to speak again. "FRIDAY said you won't be eating dinner with us."
"He took away your Bucky! I understand how it feels when someone takes away the person you love, you know. He's jealous. He’s never had anyone. He doesn't know what it feels like to love someone more than himself. He loves only his money!" the kid sneered in Tony's direction.
"I hate this," Tony complained, probably for the millionth time since the moment they all had received the expensively crafted invitations.
Tony shrugged his shoulders in exasperation. Welcome home party. Clint's idea. Tony was absolutely certain Steve Rogers wouldn't come up with something fun to do. He stopped his line of thoughts, horrified with himself. He was so used to think about Steve as an enemy or someone who would make his life a thousand times harder. It was like at the beginning when they had met. "Ok, we're done for now, honey."
"FRIDAY, start the shower in Steve’s bathroom on his preferred temperature."
Steve had to take a deep breath, because every word from Tony's mouth hit home. "I'm really sorry."
Steve was sitting on a bench in Central Park, his shoulders hunched. Kids were shouting cheerfully in front of him playing with their parents. Runners never looked his way. Thankfully, they didn't know his identity. In case someone went near him, he wore a black cap on his head. All the noise his super senses received, Steve's mind didn't even process.
Tony sighed. Captain America never backed down easily. It was an attribute of Steve Rogers. Steve was one of the people who wouldn’t let himself give up, and that answer right now was too easy. Worst of all, Tony wanted to know the truth. He wouldn’t be able to sleep properly if he couldn’t figure out Steve's intent. "Do you have a ring for me?"
Steve didn’t appear to be affected in any way. He had answered Pepper’s questions, nodded in the right places, but hadn’t initiated any conversation. He acted like this trip was a daily occurrence, and Tony couldn’t tell that this was the same guy who had sat on that park bench. He couldn't see any resemblance. Tony did, because he knew it had happened. Steve Rogers was suddenly too good at displaying a poker face.
Steve squared his shoulders and looked around the group of the members of the Avengers Initiative with a calculating look. However, the fact that his gaze completely ignored Tony was highly suspicious.
. Even in his wildest fantasies, he could never have imagined that Steve Rogers might love him.
Steve stood there paralyzed under Tony's gaze. The world around them halted. What was Tony trying to say?
"Only the audio, Boss."
"You want to talk about anything?" Natasha silently slid near him onto the couch.
Tony tightened his grip on the screwdriver, and with a few moves of his head, he managed to ease the tension in his neck. He studied the printed blueprints of the wheelchair he had made the previous day.
All the awards go to my lovely beta Rebecca. I have to apologize in advance, next chapter will be some time after March 20th, because I'm going on a vacation.
Steve's entire being was awash with shame. He had never felt so low as he did now for scaring Tony like this. In the heat of the moment he hadn't seen another way to end their fight other than to make Tony submit by going for the arc reactor.
Tony's paralysis was interrupted by the female voice of his artificial intelligence, FRIDAY. After a few difficulties and a lot of thinking, he had installed her at the tower. "No, thanks, sweetie. I’ve got this. I can do things on my own, ya know.” His voice was raw, the words scraping his throat. He swallowed and forced a grin onto his face. “I'm old enough to drink, smoke, have sex, ride an elevator and open doors as well." His cheerful tone belied the cold dread that lay in his stomach as he stared at the door in front of him. He had spent years developing his masks as a defense mechanism and means of diverting people's attention so they never saw his pain, his fear.
"I'm not pressuring you to have sex with me."
How could he dare to love Tony after everything Steve had made him go through?
"I---" Tony started and Steve patiently waited for him to continue, "---I don't want to talk about that. Not because I'm angry but because I don't feel the need to talk about it. I have so many things on my mind. I want to
Only when T’Challa had come to say goodnight, she had finally left. Tony hadn’t felt any satisfaction watching her leave. He wanted to be left in peace, but at the same time, he wanted to confide in Pepper to what was happening in his life. But how do you talk to your ex about loving someone else? How do you talk about your own heartbreak?
"Yes," he whispered, gaze never leaving Tony’s.
"Bruce?" Tony's attention shifted to the man who had just stepped into the room.
With Tony's back to the wall, Steve positioned himself in front of him to shield him from the other people in the room. Since Steve's focus was solely on Tony, Clint still stayed with them and kept watch.
Tony winked at Steve and grinned happily. He would never admit to anyone how much those words meant to him. "Of course I do. You don't look so bad yourself."
"Everything to your satisfaction, Captain Rogers?" Tony's AI asked tentatively.
Steve sighed fondly. It wasn't Tony's fault, Steve had practically invited that question into their conversation. "More like I will hurt you long before the---" He wanted to find another word, but the eloquence had left him as Tony stared into his eyes. Steve was forced to use Tony's exact word, but he cringed internally, "---
"Another day in paradise," Clint joked.
"In this case, me too," Clint agreed with him.
"I didn’t know you two were such good friends, Tony."
Tony wanted nothing more than to forbid his thoughts to even go there. It was not possible. It was absolutely pointless to think about it, after all, it couldn't be true. Steve had loved Peggy Carter for half of his life and the other half he had spent pining after his supposedly dead friend. He sure as hell wouldn't have feelings for Tony.
"Steve, one thing I can say safely is that I'm not heartbroken anymore. Just as I don't think about the torture in Afghanistan every night, I don't think about our Civil War either. Yeah, I do have flashbacks or I sometimes feel uneasy, but it's in my head. I can conquer
Tony had lost track of the hours he was in the workshop and how many times exactly she had asked as well. "No, leave it there," he replied, never pausing in his work. "Give me an hour and then call Rhodey here."
"You broke his heart!" the kid accused Tony, gesturing in Steve's direction. "How could you do this? He's your friend. He's so much better than you. You act like an almighty god, throwing money left and right, and you---"
"The suit is not finished yet. It needs a few final touches." Tony helped his friend sit down. "How do you like it, by the way?"
. Like the Tony Stark I fell in love with. Like the Tony Stark I know best. Like the person I want to spend the rest of my life with."
Steve's worst nightmare came true just a second later.
Somewhere to be? A theater maybe? Tony had never paid much attention to the dating scene in the 40s. Who knew what the geriatric was hiding up his sleeve now. Hold on. They’d had live bands and clubs. So, maybe dancing was on the agenda for tonight?
voice did nothing against his mental state. Still, one could hardly blame someone for having the voice of someone else's vocal cords.
"I suspect poison," Vision butted into the conversation.
"There is no beauty in love either. In the end, there's only heartbreak," Tony snorted cynically. "Just heartbreak." Tony's heart had repeatedly made the mistake of loving someone who deserted him in the end. He was not happy with himself, but one couldn't dwell on something that couldn't be changed.
"Good girl. So, what were Rhodey's results with our latest experiment?" He lifted his omnipresent tablet and started the 3D projection of the tests throughout his elevator ride.
Steve didn't believe it.
"I thought you’d never ask." Rhodey let the faceplate of the War Machine suit retreat and gave Tony a meaningful look.
"Just stay with me, please."
"We fought."
"I don't mind any of them staying here."
"Boss, Colonel Rhodes is here," FRIDAY informed him and returned him to the present.
"You're fine just as you are," Steve assured him, but it didn't help at all. Tony was panicking at the idea of being wined and dined in a pair of stupid sweatpants and nothing but an undershirt. Something must have been visible on his face, because Steve was quick to reassure him with a firm voice, "Tony, I'm not here to date your clothes. Sit down, put the rose where it belongs and enjoy dinner." Steve winked at him.
Steve's heart stopped beating when Tony threw that bomb into the silent room.
Tony shook his head angrily. "You're a stubborn son of a bitch, aren't you? You want the only person I never doubted out of your sight."
"Look at me!"
He blinked in confusion. FRIDAY had never diverted his attention from a question before. This, however, was the second time within a few minutes. "Where did he go?"
"Walking is the last thing I want," Tony mumbled angrily. "I want to fucking forget we're here. Let me go."
"Captain Rogers, are you feeling alright?"
Steve helplessly clawed at the bathtub's edge, causing the ceramic to crumble under his touch. Tony knelt down. "He's not fine. He's hurting," Tony hissed angrily, but he saw with his own eyes that Steve's cheek bone was forming back into place. The bloody scrape still remained.
"You know me better than that." She gave him a small smile.
Tony could finally breathe more easily.
"He's fine. He's not hit." Clint finally eased his fingers off Tony’s tuxedo and stood up. He switched his place with Steve, but stayed alert.
"For God's sake, Rogers!" Tony interrupted Steve's thoughts. "We're talking about our sex life, not my funeral."
"With help," Steve reminded him.
Tony's gaze traveled to Steve’s mouth.
"Ok." Tony sighed deeply and relaxed in his chair. Hands on the armrests, he wheeled the chair around and faced Steve with a grin on his face and legs spread carelessly. "How’s it going, Captain Picasso?"
Steve wasn’t sure how healthy this path would be for Tony.
"Why? I have work to do." Tony had currently been working on Steve's shield with safety goggles on his face and welding torch in hand. The Iron Man suit was in top condition already.
"I'm playing nice here. And it's not an easy role for me." Tony looked at him with a smirk. "I can wait to have sex with you if you're not ready. No big deal. But I won’t be waiting just because you're afraid of something totally ridiculous. Please, don't make me seduce you. You wouldn't know what hit you."
Steve froze. He recognized that decisive tone of Tony's voice.
"Tony---"
Steve was dressed in his military uniform, silently working through his dinner at the fancy mansion. He had answered the questions, but just as it had been decided previously, the rest of the talking was left to Tony. He thrived on social events, tonight being just another example. Tony was charming as ever. He joked at his own expense, never belittling others. He looked absolutely at ease. No one would guess the man's thoughts.
Tony heard the concern in his friend's voice. "I'm fine, Dad," he stated hastily, but with the last word his chest clenched in pain.
"Love you back!" Tony gave him a small wave with a blinding smile and waited for Rhodey to leave. When the doors finally shut behind his friend, he could breathe more easily. "Now, where were we?" Tony's attention moved to his AI.
"You're just a coward," the billionaire snarled angrily. "You think just because you’re fucking Captain Perfect, you’re entitled to know everything better than everyone else, but you're too scared to see that someone else might be right as well."
And if that statement didn't cause Steve heart palpitations he didn't know what else would. This was far more important than anything Tony could ever say.
When Tony had finally decided on a heart surgery, there had still remained a gaping hole where his sternum should have been. They had to synthesize something that would cover the most vulnerable organ in a human body.
"I know you can hear me."
Tony endured the long signing ceremony, the smiling for the cameras, the flirting with all the reporters. He was being a good boy, not even stealing one look at Steve's uniform that was clinging perfectly to the super soldier's backside when he bent down to sign his name under the Accords.
jealous."
"Exactly what I wanted." Steve nosed his cheek. "You smell like yourself. You're the Tony from my fantasies. Not Iron Man. Not Tony Stark, immaculately dressed for a press conference. You're perfect just as you are. Also---"

on me?" But despite his words and actions, Tony was grinning widely.
"No," Steve whined in protest.
Re-post 11/2017 with Rebecca's edits
Spending the day with T'Challa or Pepper had been fine, but alone in his workshop, nothing worked at all. Nothing could distract him from his thoughts of Steve.
"You didn’t say a word about yourself."
Steve inched to the left, taking the man's attention back onto himself. "You have someone you love, you said?"
He hated himself a little bit because, without any sugar coating, Tony didn't want the Avengers to have his back. He would rather go alone than be forced to spend time with any of them one on one. "No. I need someone who can clarify how they got inside the house."
"You weren't in the kitchen today."
"I wanted to go alone. All those big words about me trusting in myself, but you don't trust me with my safety."
"I know," was the careful statement that came from the king.
Tony was almost about to give up when he saw Steve's eyes shifting away from him momentarily. "It finally dawned on me that there's no second chance."
Tony blinked. He turned back towards Pepper, having been completely oblivious to her presence. He had honestly forgotten she was still in the same room with them. "Hm?"
It was
But now, at the reception, Tony's eyes strayed to Steve who was currently conversing with Clint. For fuck's sake, Steve Rogers was
Steve exhaled shakily. Their cheeks scratched against each other when the super soldier pulled away slightly . "Tony?" he whispered questioningly.
Tony Stark hated official business, especially if it had anything to do with the Government. And this was the Annual Fancy Schmancy Presidential Gala. He hated it with the same passion he loved dressing for the part. No one would accuse him of slacking when buying his clothes. The only bright side of the upcoming event was that all the Avengers had to be there. Everyone would be attending in their non-superhero outfits which meant black tuxedos were necessary for the men while the ladies had to wear a dress. The night would certainly be fun watching Natasha and Wanda clad in cocktail dresses.
"Yeah, well, as our national icon pointed out, I am awesome. Pepper, care to describe the next projects of Stark Industries and elaborate on my genius a bit more?"
"Yep, so you get it."
Steve didn't have to be a genius to know all of that behavior was carefully crafted for the public. In seconds of silence, filled only with the clinking of the dishes, Steve saw Tony's eyes. They were lost. It wasn’t visible for more than a fraction of a second, but Steve knew what he was seeing in his friend's eyes. Tony was working through the question Steve had asked him earlier. Steve was scared out of his mind what the answer would be.
"That's the point!" The kid's hand wavered. "You are so nice to everyone. Especially to him. Look at him. He's a fake person!"
"Listen to me." Steve moved quicker than he had wanted. "There is nothing between me and Bucky. There won’t ever be anything because I love
Then, a warm palm slowly slid over Tony's lower back. Steve obviously wanted him closer. Tony heard Steve holding his breath as if he expected Tony to push him away.
Tony stood still when Steve lowered his head and pressed his brow to Tony's shoulder. It would be so easy for Tony to turn his head and kiss away the water from the man's neck.
"Not really. I need you to look at the chair, sit in it for a few hours and then tell me if there's something wrong or if you want something different."
AS always, Rebecca did the edits. Buckets of roses and all the chocolates needs to be send her way. :)
"I triple-checked them," she interrupted Tony patiently, but her tone suggested she still hadn’t forgiven Tony's accusation of negligence and felt offended.
Tony finally had a moment to think and piece the things together. The shattered vase where the bullet had hit. Flowers on the floor. They had probably been aiming for his head through the window pane. Most certainly with a telescopic rifle. Natasha must have seen the red dot on his face. Clint had been the one closest to him, and fortunately for Tony, the archer had better reflexes than most people and had easily tackled him to the floor.
"There is no need for you to look at me like that," T'Challa chuckled.
Wanda and Sam appeared beside them a moment later, starting to create a protective circle. Rhodey didn't even hesitate, he activated his wheelchair and suited up in the midst of the crowded room.
"Thank you, FRIDAY."
"No." Pepper tilted her head thoughtfully. "He’s good for you. You’re calmer when he’s near you."
"Let’s be clear on something. I need you to be healed and alright. We have to talk," Tony hoped he empathized the word
"It will be fun," Tony assured her quickly. He would finally have all his robots around again. At least a fragment of his past would be back.
"Where is Stark!" The shout came from the group of production people, and everyone backed away from the young man who was holding a gun. He couldn't be more than twenty years old. A kid.
FRIDAY had added the last part after a moment of careful searching for words. "Ok. Care to explain your scientific analysis of Steve Rogers?" Tony turned when the bright big holographic projection materialized behind him. FRIDAY played the same video from yesterday for him, only now in high definition.
Tony took flight in his Iron Man suit, and minutes later, he descended on the ramp at the Tower, walking towards the entrance and shedding the armor one step at the time. He went to the bathroom to take a shower, trying to rein himself in. Bruce had said Steve was well enough. After all, he was a human enhanced with a super serum that was finally starting to work again.
This time Tony didn’t have to pretend, he gave her a beaming smile. "Are you jealous, Ms. Potts? My friend is a king. Do you have anyone higher on the social ladder?"
Steve stared at him uncomprehendingly. Tony's expression wasn't that different, either.
"Tony?"
"---I love?" Steve supplied the words.
Tony's stomach clenched nervously, because all these things looked suspiciously like a date. Their first official date. One look at his clothes in the reflection in the stainless steel door of the elevator told him that he wasn't even remotely dressed for the occasion. Gray sweatpants and a black tank top weren't date material. Steve wore a nice pair of black slacks and white shirt with three buttons casually undone.
Which led him to the most important part. Tony absolutely refused to believe that Steve Rogers would ever be happy loving him. People couldn't order their hearts to stop loving someone, but if it was somehow possible after all, the super soldier would be the first one to try.
Tony hated that reasonable voice. He sneered. "Do you even know---" But he didn't get far, because the king of Wakanda suddenly stepped closer, and Tony's brain shut down in surprise.
The glass with alcohol was put in front of him, and Tony automatically reached for it. The moment his fingers closed around the glass, a distinctly colored hand landed on his.
"I'm going through your work playlist now, boss."
"Kid, just tell me what is it you want so everyone can leave in peace," Tony told him calmly.
Without further hesitation, Tony finally jumped the gun and whispered, "You were gutted when you walked out of my workshop. Tell me why." He held his breath for a few long seconds, patiently waiting for Steve to finally gave him an answer and open up. Something that could mend them closer together.
I would like to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
"After you, my friend."
Tony tried to forget his embarrassment, opened his eyes and put a smile on his face. It probably looked a lot like his fake mask for cameras.
so many things. I don't have the time to go back and revisit all those memories. We started again. Together. With a clean slate."
Thank you for reading :)
"You ok?" Steve asked softly.
"Like you’re looking at something---" Tony didn’t want to use the word
"How is it going? Anything worth seeing?" Tony asked nonchalantly. When he didn't get an answer, Tony looked at him more carefully. "Are you nervous?"
"She was right, you know."
Tony grabbed Steve's nape, pulled him down and kissed his forehead. "Everything's gonna be fine, you know."
"You have no idea what you do to me," Tony mumbled and turned back to his monitors. He probably hadn’t meant to say that out loud.
He could still hear the ringing of metal against metal of Steve's final blow, and then Captain America was leaning onto the shield protruding from his chest, breathing heavily. Tony flinched.
"I do not need to be an Avenger to stand by your side. I only need to be your friend." T'Challa's confident words and tone left Tony stunned. He had no idea how he deserved such an honor. He cleared his throat, his wit suddenly having abandoned him.
"Did I miss the memo where they announced you are part of the Avengers now?" Tony asked with a smile he couldn't contain. Thank God for his face plate. Here stood a person he wouldn’t have any problems going into the enemy territory with.
God, that man was absolutely impossible. Tony's anger melted like heated chocolate. Sometimes, the super soldier did those small things. Things that might have been completely insignificant but that meant more to Tony than any other exaggerated gesture ever could.
"Alright, people," Steve broke the tension.
Steve nodded in acknowledgement. Tony was gifted with a lot of things, and one of them had always been perceptiveness. Tony didn't only have a genius brain, he could use it as well and draw consequences from other people’s actions. Steve was honored by that to some extend, after all he was important enough to Tony for him to watch him that closely and know his habits.
Pepper had spent the night in a guest room. The previous evening had been filled with more conversation with her. She had tried to figure out what was wrong with him, but he had been as evasive as ever, ditching the questions, eluding the answers and bullshitting his way out of every single meaningful dialog. He’d been ready to say anything just to have her off his back and stop the prodding questions.
Funny that no one said a word of disagreement. Even Natasha looked satisfied with the decision. So it was on Tony to be the voice of reason. "Could you maybe---"
The screen slid down, and here he was, Steve Rogers with those fucking puppy dog eyes and the bastard lying and saying,
That worked too. Steve was really looking at him like he loved him. Like he loved every stupid thing Tony did. Tony closed his eyes against the clenching sensation in his chest, because this wasn't the time to answer him.
"How's your head, Tony?"
The absolute terror on Tony's face in Siberia was suddenly making much more sense. Tony had had dangerous shrapnel embedded into his chest for years. Someone had surgically removed a large portion of his sternum and put the arc reactor in instead to save his life.
Breathing felt suddenly terribly difficult. Tony blinked tears out of his eyes and tried to suppress his panic. "Ok. I really hate you right now. Is this a marriage proposal, too?" Because, shit, he could ruin their date night or first sex, but not a marriage proposal as well.
"What are you up to with that dreamy smile of yours? Are you drawing me?"
"Right." Tony shook his head. On the one hand, it was almost comforting to know everything was just in his mind. Anything in his head could be battled and sooner or later conquered. Tony pulled himself together with several measured breaths. His fingers automatically reached for his gray hoodie draped over his chair. He slipped the comforting material on. "What did you say before, FRIDAY?"
Steve ignored the way his chest felt warmer after Tony's words. The billionaire obviously knew he was drawing him and felt pleased. It was apparent from Tony's tone of voice.
"He's fixing our mess as usual, throwing money in every direction, kissing Ross' ass, not sleeping much, traveling around the world, keeping Vision from moping about Wanda and working insane hours. Nothing new."
Tony surveyed the full room. Sam was clad in a fancy tuxedo, Wanda in a red cocktail dress. Natasha wore a long tight black robe, but Tony was pretty sure she was hiding a weapon or two in there somewhere. The only person in their superhero fighting uniform, ignoring the dress code, was Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka I-will-do-whatever-I-want-so-screw-you-people. Tony squinted at him in disapproval.
Shitty. Tony had the answer to that question, but he still couldn't imagine his life being different. He missed the Avengers. Yes, he was angry as fuck, but they were his family. His people.
"Yes!" Sam punched the air in victory.
He had already made his decision about their future, hadn't he?
Steve's super serum was clearly finally overpowering the poison, but he winced with every healed bone and curled into a fetal position, clutching his ribs.
Tony mentally whimpered, because just the thought made him want to crawl under a rock and die. Not speaking to each other properly was torture, but not seeing each other at all? Relying on seeing them only when the Earth was in danger? Tony couldn't imagine his life without Steve.
"Fine," Tony capitulated begrudgingly. He slid the rose into a vase which had obviously been placed on the table for exactly that purpose and sat down. "Anything else?"
Which, surprisingly, made a lot of sense, but Steve had made so many mistakes when it came to Tony that he couldn't picture any more of them. Not with Tony. His previous decisions concerning Tony had almost caused him to lose the man he loved. Steve wouldn't risk that again.
"Tony."
"Captain Rogers expected your question and instructed me, if the circumstances were to arrive, to explain that he is out and will be back as soon as possible."
It was several moments before Natasha broke the silence again. "You know, I betrayed Tony’s trust when I let you leave with Bucky, but he still warned me that Ross was going to come after me, and he let me remove myself from the Tower to prevent myself from being caught," she said in a considering tone. Then she shrugged. "Nothing's ever just black and white, Steve, and Tony has always been discerning of that gray. I think, in time, he’ll understand your reasons and everything will be alright."
"I'm a lot of things. Selfless is not one of them, Tony." Steve had to cross his arms in front of his chest, because seeing Tony so tired and defeated, it affected him. Steve's instincts were telling him to go after Tony and comfort him.
"You deserve to have someone you can feel safe with. God knows we're doing a bang-up job with it." Tony was surprised that Steve didn't put it as a question. He just stated the truth which looked to Tony as if he didn't like it at all.
"Tony?" Steve asked softly. The super soldier’s arms sneaked around his body and held him close.
"As you wish, Boss."
"Nat?" Tony sidestepped Steve when Vision and Natasha entered the room from the main doorway. The rest of the Avengers gathered around them as well.
Steve's whisper in that grateful tone made Tony feel guilty. He understood very well what the super soldier felt. Tony was scared shitless by the idea of Steve getting hurt again, too.
Steve didn't bat an eye when they were finally face to face. His armor was bulletproof, after all. He was just grateful Tony had stayed behind him. "Son, you don't want to do that," he stated calmly.
"Do you want it to be?" Steve smiled at him fondly.
Tony Stark was lost for words. That didn't happen very frequently. Steve didn't know what to do when Tony nervously swung his feet out of the bed and rubbed his eyes tiredly. The only thing Steve could think about was apologizing.
"How do you know that?" Steve smiled sadly, patiently looking into Tony's eyes.
"Just like with Barnes."
"Negative on all your questions, Boss."
Tony tried to say something to stop Steve when he pulled away, but the words betrayed him. Steve's blushing face made him feel even worse. It was him who had told Steve he would never risk acting on his feelings towards him. He couldn't just ignore his own words, act conversely and not explain himself properly. It would only confuse Steve more and hurt his feelings.
If Steve was honest with himself, he himself hadn't known until there was all of a sudden the scary possibility of him leaving it. "It's nothing you have to take into consideration." The thing was, Steve didn't only love the Tower. He loved the family and friends he had found there. The place felt like home. And he most definitely loved its owner.
"Well, you’re mistaken," Tony answered flatly. He squared his shoulders and took a step back. Steve was right only to an extent. "I trust Rhodey, Vision and Bruce. They will be staying here. All of them. Keeping an eye on you. So, do as the doctors say."
Steve noticed the way his body kept a hairsbreadth of distance from Tony's chest. He held himself securely on his forearms, although their legs and crotches were pressed together thanks to Tony, who seemed to emulate an octopus with only four limbs. The brunet had a smug glint in his eyes before he grew serious again.
"He’s fine." Tony mustered a smile. "Handsome as ever and still the cryptic little bastard who happens to wear black spandex and claws in times of crisis."
"As you wish, Boss."
"Done."

Yeah, Tony was pretty sure he knew her very well. That’s why it didn’t make sense.
Yeah, maybe that crazy geriatric was right. Tony had overreacted as always. But who could blame him under these circumstances?
Tony propped him up against the far wall inside the shower cubicle, but Steve struggled to free himself. "For God’s sake, at least stay still," Tony huffed with annoyance. He pressed his upper body against Steve's to keep him upright and blindly searched for the tap. However, he couldn’t find it. Why again did he feel the need to have the showers so big? He was too far away to reach. Luckily, he knew a different solution.
That's what Steve told Vision with agonizing eyes. With a heavy heart, Tony let the screen freeze on Steve's face. No one would fake this much concern. Especially not the super soldier who never lied, and his features were like an open book. Well, almost never lied, but Tony didn't want to open up that can of worms again.
Tony finally gave up. With the food gone, he ignored the rest of the world as he repaired Iron Man's primary suit.
wrong with me right now?" Tony spoke self-deprecatingly, but he was still amazed by the vulnerability in Steve's eyes. "Can you honestly say I'm your prince Charming, huh? Sweaty? Stained with who knows what? I look like---"
How could she look at him so calmly?
"No," Tony honestly squeaked like a teenage girl.
Again, I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
Tony smirked. He could almost picture it to the detail. FRIDAY telling Steve he was alright and at the same time insinuating Steve's concern had been justified.
"I heard the two of you are sharing a suite?" the Mayor inquired after a few words about public safety.
"Yes. Sorry." Bruce shed the white coat.
Tony silently cursed himself. He had been too distracted by those sinful fingers to remember about the faint scarring on his chest. The auto-transplantation had taken care of the hole. The big chunk of skin graft from his thigh had helped, but the scars were still visible. Definitely for someone with enhanced sight.
"Colonel Rhodes and Vision have already arrived at the Gala," FRIDAY told them, "and I have been instructed to inform you that Doctor Banner's invitation was unfortunately lost and not delivered so he won't be attending tonight."
Tony considered the importance of Butterfingers in a grand scheme of things. However, he finally had to capitulate. There were much more pressing issues than his old robotic friend. "You know what, we have a lot to do, kiddo. Butterfingers can wait. The armor and the shield have higher priority."
"Did you eat today?" Rhodey stopped by the door.
"You’re not listening."
Tony's heart clenched painfully at the memory. That voice was tearing him to pieces. "Vision." Tony tried to calm down, but the obvious concern in
How the hell could T'Challa make even an amused chuckle look all smooth and imperial? Be that as it may, Tony was not convinced of his statement. How could Steve and him go past that mess with their Civil War?
Hello, yes, I'm here. I'm still alive. I have to apologize. Past few months were hectic. My friend and co-worker in one person was diagnosed with cancer. So I spent half of my time at work and the other one cheering her up. It's a long process. Some times I have these absolutely amazing ideas and no time to write, other times I don't have the energy to do anything more than sleep. But I'm not giving up on my stories, it will just take some time to finish them. Chapter 10-12 is already written and it's up to my wonderful beta to polish it and make it great. :) ...So thank you all for waiting, comments and nice messages. :)
"More like undress," Steve corrected casually with a wink, and Tony's mind stalled. Now he was nervous, thank you very much. Steve wouldn't---
"No," Steve smiled at him, eyes full of happiness.
Natasha continued, her words bringing Steve back to the present. "---He installed FRIDAY at the Tower and locked everyone out of his workshop. He won’t let anyone but Rhodey inside. Sure, he does a good job of not showing it when he’s speaking in public, but other than business, he’s completely isolated himself from others. As if he doesn’t feel safe around people, even those he used to trust." Natasha’s voice was mild, but Steve could see the concern in her eyes. "Steve, he won’t even meet up with Pepper at his home anymore. What happened after I let you guys go?"
Steve's heart gave a painful twitch. He felt mortified because it had never occurred to him he could feel attraction towards Tony. Attraction? Who was he kidding. "How---" He stopped with a tight throat. Words really weren't his strong suit.
"Weak," Steve whispered, his eyes closed.
Again, I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
Eventually, Tony straightened his back. "Clint?"
A few hours later, Tony was sitting in Pepper’s chopper with Steve by his side, and they were on their way to a hotel somewhere. He didn’t give a fuck where exactly. All he wanted was a quiet place to exist without his thoughts being haunted by the man sitting next to him. He could already feel the beginning of another headache.
"Doing what?"
There was no conversation about this emasculating situation because the super soldier was asleep with his head on Tony's shoulder within a second. Tony internally winced. The immediate future didn't look very promising. He could picture all the curious glances from the Avengers waiting outside.
Steve froze in astonishment. "You played me."
"Copy."
They were finally there. Together. Separated from the others. Not Captain America or Iron Man. Only Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, and the idea scared Tony shitless. This was the situation he had tried to avoid at any cost because Tony knew very well how it would end.
The smug bastard only continued to smile with flushed cheeks. Tony looked back at the rose. "You went out just to give me a flower?"
that's in my head." Tony dismissed his PTSD with a flippant hand gesture.
"Do you want me with you, Tony?" Black Widow asked, obviously interested in the afternoon delight in the darkness. It was like they couldn’t wait to go anywhere with Tony and help him. It grated on Tony’s nerves.
Re-post 11/2017 with Rebecca's edits
"You can't have known. It happened only yesterday," Tony replied, annoyed by his friend's calmness.
"No." He interrupted Pepper before she could continue. "We’re not having this conversation. Ever." The only place to go and get as far away from her as possible was Steve's part of the suite. The bastard was looking out of the window and appeared to be enjoying the beautiful view from up above.
"Son," Steve interrupted him forcefully. "We can talk this through, but please, lower the gun. We don't want anyone to get hurt."
"Alright. Let him in, then," Tony tried to ignore the vulnerability permeating his skin. It was not real. In a second he shifted his attention to Steve. He watched the super soldier with eagle eyes. Steve stood uncertainly in a doorway, looking uncomfortable and unsure around Tony's space again.
"Don’t do this," Tony warned her with a collected, soft tone of his voice. "Not with T’Challa. He lost his father. He’s got a nation to lead. He doesn’t have time for this bullshit."
"Or two stories. What do you think, baby girl? It looks to me like he forgot about what is good in this world," Tony smiled. "Maybe Rapunzel as well?"
"I don't like crowds," Steve whispered. "And the television show, that's another ball game."
face, and the soldier was making it because of Tony. As if the idea of Tony hurting hurt Steve as well. As if Tony was important enough to Steve to cause that face. And screw the super soldier, because it was fucking with Tony's head.
"Good. Come on," Tony helped Steve to his feet. How the hell he was even awake was a mystery to Tony. He swayed on his feet and seemed to almost fall asleep standing up. "Say the word and I'll carry you."
Tony didn't release Steve’s waist. They didn’t need to communicate - Steve knew him well enough not to treat him like a wilting flower right now and take charge of the situation instead.
"Dinner with the Mayor," Pepper reminded them patiently. "The limo will be here in ten minutes."
"No," Steve cut her off, and she fell silent. After several seconds, he finally found the courage to look her in the eyes. "It’s not a joke, or an exaggeration. We fought. Me and Bucky against Tony. I swung the shield at him repeatedly, but he wouldn’t give up. He just kept going after Bucky over and over again. It was like he couldn’t see anything else. I tried to talk him down, but he never--- listened to me. He's always so stubborn. Bucky nearly ripped out the arc reactor with his metal hand, and then Tony tore the arm from Bucky’s body---"
Hawkeye just gave them both a silent nod of acknowledgement and went after Sam to carry out Steve's order. Tony wanted to speak up, but Steve's pleading eyes stopped him.
Steve finally asked a coherent question, but he still had that haunted look in his eyes. Tony wanted nothing more than to change that. Steve should not look this uncertain. Maybe he should finally say something. "Good."
Tony’s insides clenched nervously. He placed his palms strategically on both sides of Steve’s head and leaned down, looking at him intently.
"Why? What do you mean, ‘why’?" Tony shook his head helplessly. "Because I smell like sweat. Because I’ve been working on Rhodey's suit, and I don't even remember for how many days in a row. Because I can't remember the last time I showered. Because I have fucking motor oil under my fingernails. Because the last time my undershirt saw a washing machine was sometime last week. I think." Tony hesitated. He honestly couldn’t remember. Not the point, though. "Because I'm a fucking mess and you're---" How could Tony make him understand? "---you. You did all of this and---"
"Are you with me?"
Steve's palms were all sweaty, and he tried not to watch the people around them anxiously. His eyes landed on Pepper Potts behind the cameras. She had been tracking each of Steve's movements and words from the moment they had left the dinner table in the Mayor's house. He hoped the nervousness wasn't that obvious to people, especially to her. Steve was humiliated enough with the knowledge that Tony was aware of his private feelings and knew that Steve was in love with him. It was a miracle that Tony could even stand being near him.
"Of course I am," Tony snapped defiantly.

Why the hell did Steve even point this out as an option? It was pretty clear the thought broke Steve's heart just as much. "I---" Tony's voice disappeared.
Happy New Year to all of my readers. Thank you so much for your patience with updates. And a special thank you to Rebecca, who edited the chapter.
This was Steve's
"Good. So, switch your seats and off to bed," Tony made a dismissive gesture. "FRIDAY, you have to read Colonel Rhodes a bedtime story today. Something nice with happily ever after. I think Cinderella is the right choice," he grinned.
Everyone found apparently very fascinating spots to look at other than Steve while Tony was covering him.
HYDRA fuckers. Tony hated them with a passion. "Entry points?"
"I’m Iron Man. You won't get any warmer with me." Tony winced as soon a the words left his mouth. Stupid brain. He slowly rubbed Steve's back to spread some heat over his skin. His fingers strayed into the hair on Steve's nape. He needed to comfort this man.
"There is no beauty in guilt, my friend," T'Challa stated.
Steve knew very well he wanted to spend the rest of his existence beside Tony. His future definitely belonged to the Avengers, and he loved how comfortable he felt in Tony's arms. Sex was just an extension of their feelings, but Steve didn't feel ready, even though he couldn't imagine himself with anyone else. He was happy just as they were. Sometimes very frustrated, Steve could admit that, but unexpectedly happy.
Why the hell would he be so obsessed with it?
"Yes, thank you," Steve brushed off the concern for his person and tried to school his face into something resembling an interest in their conversation. He couldn't hide behind his nervousness or shyness. Tony relied on him to play his part as well. "You have a nice house."
"The temperature of the room is steady. The thermostat is working at one hundred percent. It didn't deviate from your personal preferences in years, Boss," FRIDAY answered calmly.
His fucking heart was beating like crazy once more. What the hell was wrong with him? What was that fucking ancient saying again? Ask and you shall receive? Curiosity killed the cat? For all his genius brain, Tony had never thought this thing through. He didn't know what to do, what to feel, and now, he was completely lost.
"If you want
"I'm right here," Tony answered solemnly and stepped around him.
"I think I beat you in your own game, Mr. Stark." Steve grinned smugly. "Eat your dessert. We have somewhere to be."

"I saw you two together."
Tony wanted to know what else Steve would whisper in the heat of the moment with that rough voice of his. He was craving the sounds the man in his arms would make.
First of all, we have to apologize for the long period of time with no update. My dearest beta is having her finals and that's more important than proof reading. So, thank you all for your patience.
"How is His Majesty doing?"
"No," he whispered.
Ross was a different matter. He had eyes and at least two brain cells (jury was still out if he needed any help for these two cells to communicate with each other, but that particular evening he had done the math and wisely hadn't commented).
"I didn't mean in general. I'm talking about last night. About today. It looks like it's killing him to even be in the same room as I am."
"Unfortunately," Tony smirked back.
Tony allowed himself a few minutes of weakness, but anger was slowly starting to simmer under his skin.
The moment shots were fired in the studio, Steve was on his feet, standing protectively in front of Tony while Tony himself shielded the host with his body as well.
"I should have been dressed for the occasion," Tony whispered with guilt permeating his voice. Sure as fuck he was ruining all of Steve's efforts.
Tony could see the exhausted circles under Steve's eyes. "It can wait," he suggested full of hope, but he knew the stubborn super soldier very well. Steve wouldn’t be backing down. Just as Tony predicted, his advice was ignored. Steve continued to move. Tony didn’t have any other option but to go with him.
"I'm a soldier, Tony. I'm used to dragging myself through the rubble of the battlefield just hanging onto the belief that there might be something worth it on the other side. I thought if I kept believing things between us could go back to where they've been, we'd get there. Giving up was never an option for me. Not in battle. Not on my fellow squad. Not on you."
"If someone tries to get to me again, I don’t mind the dying part. I already went through that. But they would hurt another friend of yours because of me. I don’t want to be responsible for that, Tony. You have suffered enough. Mostly by my own hand."
"What's wrong?" Steve's face was creased with worry.
with him. Tony didn't know if he was overcome with joy or terrified out of his mind or angry as fuck. Probably terrified, that feeling suited him better. No. Angry. Livid was more precise.
Tony did a double take and stared at his friend uncomprehendingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony shouldn't be turned on by Steve’s taking charge attitude. It really wasn't a good time, but he couldn't help himself. Before the Avengers could scatter around the premises, Steve reached out to Clint’s shoulder.
Tony had to stop the words from coming. He turned his head and captured Steve's lips with his own. Tony's insides made a violent twist, and his stomach dropped. Every nerve ending in his body sparkled to life. The wave of heat punched Tony's breath out of his lungs. He could do nothing but hold onto the dark blue scrubs Steve was still wearing and try to calm his racing heart.
Steve Rogers sat on the couch with a notepad in his hand and was currently shading a figure of Iron Man against the sky. "I know you're there." His enhanced hearing helped him to notice Natasha entering through the window in the second room. Steve was on the run from the US government, a wanted fugitive, and she had offered him one of her safe houses after their fiasco.
"Why don't you find out?"
He lifted his hands and tried to tell himself that it was not his problem when Steve Rogers looked unhappy, but it didn’t help any. Tony’s thumb left a bloody smudge on the papers. Great. He couldn’t even work properly, having injured himself once again.
Steve smiled happily, and Tony held his breath.
Steve could only swallow with a dry throat.
The real chapter 11. Special thanks to my new beta Rebecca. As of now, the story is finished, so the rest of the chapters will be coming more quickly.
"Sorry. I thought you wanted to talk," Steve said softly.
"Captain Rogers is not missing. He was released against medical advice. His condition was well enough, his lab results showed signs of improvement, and he assured us he would be in good hands."
The hope in the man's eyes made Steve regret every wrong word he had ever said to Tony. "No. That's what I thought before I knew him. The Tony I know is willing to listen to me talk about my drawings until three a.m. and never complain."
"Sometimes---" Tony's hoarse voice stirred something at the bottom of Steve's stomach, but Tony cleared his throat and started again, this time with a soothing tone. "Sometimes you're impossible."
