So John was not, was very much not, visualising all the things that could possibly go wrong when a tiny child had a head cold.
“Kissing is perfectly elementary. I can’t see how anyone can possibly be bad at it. You just squish your lips together and slide about a bit. What?”
John rose, following the instructions, went to Sherlock and dipped his fingers into Sherlock's shirt pocket. He withdrew a discreetly coloured plastic card.
He remembered a lot of things, standing in this green field. The clash of steel, the cries of men, the smell of the marsh, of sweat, of shit, of guts, of blood. He remembered dying here, face down in the scarlet mud, heedless of the pain, grateful for release.
And they kissed, and cried as they kissed, and laughed too, and kissed again, and clung together.
“Your art,” she confessed.
“You don’t  know, Harry. You don’t know what I’ve done.”
Mrs Hudson stayed for dinner and a cuddle with Rosie, then kissed them all goodnight and left.
Mrs Hudson produced cupcakes from the baking tin. Mycroft took one, and Sherlock said nothing at all about it. Gave him a second, in fact. ‘You’re too thin,’ he said.
“Redeemed, yes. And yet,” said Khan, “oh my love, what I would do to protect her.”
“I will,” said Molly with an emphatic nod. “You can be my wife-not-wife.”
Rosie squealed and smeared pea puree on both their faces before sucking the remains off her own fingers.
She was beautiful.
‘Of course,’ his mother replied.
The consulting detective used to carry mini-Watson about in a papoose on his back until that time he wore her on his front, facing out. As he talked with her about a case, she looked left at a very critical moment. “Yes!" shouted her papa, "It was hiding in plain sight. Oh Rosie, you see
They shared the bottle. Sherlock listened at the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You always do the Daddy Dance to cheer her up. And you haven’t pulled your shirt down properly.” Sherlock patted the exposed strip of John’s belly.
“You missed the ceremony,” Dimitri said, as neutrally as possible, stalling for time.
Sherlock almost blurted I Do right there and then.
He didn’t reply. He grimaced, mouth twisted sourly.
Being high summer, even Mycroft had finally given in to the heat, removed his jacket and tie, and rolled up his sleeves. He and Greg danced. Sherrinford Holmes stared, not for the dancing, but for the tattoos. Greg’s elbow sported a cobweb, part of a motorbike and the words ‘rock and roll’ were visible on his left forearm, a guitar on his right wrist. More astonishing is the tattoo  of a robin and teacup he could see on his son’s right bicep. The boy who’d left London to study in Australia would never have dated a man covered in tattoos, let alone worn one of his own.
Sherlock enfolded his husband in a hug. He knew, to the gram, how much weight John had lost in recent weeks, with worry, overwork, missing too many meals. And John had gone back to bolting the meals he didn’t miss, returning to army and on-call habits of constantly being ready to drop everything for an emergency.
“So happy for you,” she murmured, then stood aside so his parents could get equal squishing time. As though they hadn’t already seen him a few hours ago.
“Because there is something strange going on at this hospital. In particular, with Culverton Smith.”
Panicking a little himself, and keen to avoid the mutual embarrassment, Sherlock decides to speed things along before he's forced to abandon the idea entirely. “Last chance, John. Trunks or clothes?”
Greg was proving to be pretty awful at this so far. But another spin landed on Molly again, who decided to just get it over with. This time, she kissed his cheek, leaving behind a faint red smudge of lipstick. It was by a blind guess, literally and figuratively, that he finally got it right. He looked relieved to finally rejoin the group, leaving his wooden chair behind for the others and opting to perch on the arm of the sofa next to Mrs Hudson for the remainder of the game. He finished off his beer and opened another.
John slips his arms under Sherlock’s armpits and jostles him in an awkward attempt to rouse him. “Sherlock? Come on, wake up. Say something.”
Sherlock's cock is slowly leaking over John’s hand as he pumps him, and John notices his expression is a little tighter now, a slight crease forming between his brow, and his breathing has definitely picked up. It would seem the transport is finally reacting to John’s stimulus, and in return, there’s a low spark of excitement and mounting heat building within John’s balls.
He spends the first couple of hours tailing various members of staff back and forth across the ship, noting the most common routes and shortcuts, all the while building his mental map of the environment. John hadn’t been wrong about him drying up in this heat. Most of the ship may be pleasantly air-conditioned, but the open-air decks radiate in the sweltering summer sun. He downs two small bottles of mineral water by the time the first crew rotation occurs, and has to make a brief detour on his way back across the ship for a third. As he stands at a vending machine in the entrance to one of the ship’s many cafés, a familiar voice reaches his ears. He peeks his head inside.
them it was contaminated so that we could have the place to ourselves for a while. People will believe anything they’re told with the right stolen uniform and an authoritative voice. Now, hurry up,” he says, rubbing his hands together. “Put the trunks on and come over here. We're wasting time.”
John takes him further into his mouth, sliding his tongue back and forth as the thick erection presses against his palate. It’s a tight fit. Sherlock’s dick isn’t enormous, but it has a healthy girth to it, and John presses it as far as it will go into the back of his throat without choking him, swallowing around it. The contraction of muscles elicits another voicy exhale from Sherlock, who thankfully remains unaware of John’s decidedly non-professional solution.
“…Seriously?” John threw him a dubious, but brazen grin. In truth, he hadn’t felt a strong need to touch himself today, despite being surrounded by thousands of people. John supposed that it was such an enormous venue, it made him feel completely insignificant. In some respects this was a safer place for him than a much smaller, much quieter gathering would be.
John hustles inside and scuffs his boots on the well-worn mat. “Christ, what a night.”
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose, regretting he’d ever opened his mouth to suggest this. So far it had been a pretty disastrous game all round. “Ugh, whatever… Someone spin it again, if he’s done.”
John folded the letter and placed it in its envelope. He put it on the table and laid his hands flat over the top of it.

A short time later, a timid knock and a loud
The Richard examined here had been a bloody tyrant. Cruel and full of spite, to spite those who had mocked and used him all his life; to be a worse monster than even the monster they perceived him to be.
“She eats berries,” says Rosie. “Fiercely,” she concedes.
"I do just have the one, John."
“I aim to be,” said John, turning to take Sherlock in his arms. “Now. Where were we?”
John fell asleep in a chair beside Sherlock’s bed, still holding his hand. Harry sent photos periodically throughout the night, whenever Rosie woke up but also several of her asleep in her cot by John's bed.
“It was very deeply dull, John.”
Sherlock had been luckier, and that made him angry. Why couldn’t John have been the asymptomatic one? He would gladly have swapped, only then it would be John sitting by Sherlock’s side, with cooling sponges and liquid paracetamol and fear in his heart.
Rosie had settled in John's arms, snuffling slightly but otherwise breathing more easily, dropping into exhausted sleep. John would very much have liked to do the same. Instead, he settled her into her cot.
'Have you enjoyed your little game?'
Inside it was a row of army medals.
And they fell.
For god’s sake, sweetheart, please don’t cry
Sherlock snatched the bear down to hold against his chest, manoeuvring the little toy staff so he didn’t poke himself in the face with it. He buried his nose in the Yeoman’s Cap and the soft fake fur below it and inhaled deeply.
“And how does that business bring you here?”
Sherlock didn’t see a single one of them. He didn’t even see Greg, standing beside John in front of them all.
“How far did you get?”
“He struggled a lot, after he came home. We didn’t know how to help him. He was angry a lot. Depressed. Had very dark thoughts, I think. It was upsetting to see it, when he tried to express himself with it. We love him, but we weren’t helping him. Then he packed up and left one day, and came here.”
“Sorry, babe,” said Greg with a sigh. “Seemed like a good idea to invite him in. He’d come all this way, and he seemed. Sad.”
He opened his eyes a crack, because it was less work than trying to think it through.
“You… do.”
Sherlock’s hands clutched convulsively at John’s, a sudden spasm, as he stared at unsullied grass growing lush in this field.
Ford was out hunting now, in a Mars sandtrawler and an environment suit.
“Then there’s other kinds of kissing,” said John gruffly.
Another sip. Jack kept talking.
“Yes,” agreed John with a soft exhale.
“Need help?”
“She’s visiting Sherlock.”
“I know, Rosie,” said Harry softly, “It’s a fucking mess.”
“Maybe they’re around…. Oh!”
I haven't written anything for Guitar Man in years, but when I grieved for Opporunity and Wil Wheaton posted that "someday, though not in my lifetime, humans will find her again" - and I rememebered that two of my characters live and work on Mars in our future.
“What do you want me to say, Sherlock? Rosie cries, John doesn’t. Everything’s shit. I’m not here to make you feel better. I don’t know how.”
Chewie grumbled a bit at being told to wait a bit, but decided the delay in his rounds could be made bearable by picking up a few graphic novels.
“Fuck it. All right. You win, Mycroft.”
Ben scowled, then laughed self-deprecatingly. “I keep trying to get sacked from the family business. He keeps forgiving me. It’s a bitch.”
“Watson,” said Sherlock seriously, peering at her over the top of the pushchair, “You’re really going to have to learn the concept of consequences eventually. We won’t always pick your toys up for you.”
David Kalisch, chief statistician at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, finally arrives, ten on the dot. He promises not to draw this out, but draws it out, just a little. He knows nobody will hear a word he says about the good work done by his team
but it's also a
One more story to go to conclude the Alternative series.
John frowned. He fished into his pocket and drew out the folded piece of paper he’d all but forgotten was there.
He wanted to correct her. Sherlock’s slenderness, seen naked, was not skinniness. Not usually.
‘And you?’
wasn’t when he first kissed a princess.
“I suspected he’d do as much. He… falls hard.”
“Something’s off about it.  I talked the events of Eurus’s death over with Mummy this morning…”
Another tap at the door. Greg opened it to a middle aged woman who smiled tremulously.
“Still not helpful.”
“However did you guess?”
Then he remembered he hadn’t unpacked the toiletries yet.
Richard turned to kiss Khan’s cheek, his lips, his brow, his nose. “Thou art the child of stars and moons, son of the universe entire; the herald of perfection, my love,” said he.  “And we are come to this miraculous pass: that our waking selves have married their bodies and eternal souls in true sympathy, to make the seed I seem to carry here in our dream glade. This babe is our vows of redemption embodied anew.”
Sherlock saw it coming – in the tension in Howie’s shoulders, and the shift of his leg; in the darting of his desperate gaze and the uneven weight in the pocket of his coat, and how the coat bunched as his hand closed around the weapon.
Rosie howled tears like it was the end of the world.
John swallowed convulsively. “It’s… complicated.”
Rosie runs to her dads, schoolbag bouncing on her back and a creature made of cardboard and ice cream sticks in her hand.
Then Mycroft’s face goes that kind of blank that Sherlock’s always does when Sally starts having a dig. Once or twice when John’s been thoughtless, too. Sherlock usually recovers to spit vitriol (at Sally) but when it’s John, the mask stays on for the short while it takes John to work out what his big mouth has done and he apologises.
“I’m not fit to be a father,” he said.
Sherlock was in Newcastle for four days without his husband and daughter. The case was difficult. The perpetrator was an arsehole. The police liaison was worse than the Met had been on their most dismissive days back in the Time Before John. Sherlock was brilliant anyway, despite the bruises on his back from being shoved down the stairs.
'No,' John agreed.
“One moment, John!”
‘I was looking for a naked man…’
Sherlock’s heart beat double-time in his chest. He distracted himself by playing his violin, but only mournful sounds resulted. So he rifled through the cold case files Sally Donovan had sent over.
“Do you?”
The last word broke into fragments as Mycroft’s grief split out of him, like lightning and thunder combined, like the sound of stone cracking in two, a howl of fury and pain so primal it transmitted hurt.
No. Wait. Three. A fresh surge of grief washed through them again, each wondering how long it would be before they’d stop stumbling over memory, before the daily stab of realisation she was gone would ease into accepting it was true.
‘I’ve always been terrible with rules,’ said Sherlock. The impulse to let go was defeated by the impulse to hang on.
“More than okay, John. Honoured, like I said.”
“She’s grown so much since…I saw her last,” he said.
, but I couldn’t remember. For god’s sake, you stupid man, don’t stand there, get back to him. Go. Run. John.
“Helpful.”
Not John trying to cuddle her (he got an eyeful of peach-coated baby fist for his pains; he was kind of proud of her aim even when his eye wouldn’t stop watering).
Mycroft risked a peek. “Yes they are. Some kind of duck dance, if I’m not mistaken.”
The decision was easy. He was already half way there. Hardly a stretch to go deeper.
Sherlock is busy/out/asleep (and can’t be woken). John can produce a reasonable French plait for Rosie’s ballet lessons now without so much as a muttered “Cock!”
“Not hungry.”
“Thank you,” said Sherlock firmly. “We accept. Right, John?”
Harry stood by the door of Musgrave Hall, smoking in the shadows. Down the drive, barely visible behind the dark shape of the oak tree, Mycroft was sitting in his wheelchair. She couldn’t tell from here if he was brooding, dozing, hiding or still crying.
“Want to say hi to your sons?” Greg offered.
Sherrinford sipped scotch.
“I don’t know.” Swipe, swipe. He stopped to read. Harry recognised her brother’s blog on Sherlock’s phone.
Sherlock swam, too, then, laughing, wrapped John in a salty, soggy hug and they’d pash on the beach. There was an attempt to have sex on the beach, too, one 3am, with the moonlight rippling over the waves, but that was thwarted by an unexpected echidna waddling by towards the water. Sherlock in his running shorts, John in a pair of small footy shorts that Sherlock had packed just for the pleasure of seeing John wear them at the beach, they sat with their arms around each other and watched the unlikely animal make its way to the surf and spend several minutes swimming and grooming itself in the sea.
, he’d said to her when they’d met.
John sniffed. Sniffed again, brow furrowing. “What the…?”
The gates to the rooftop garden were wide open and the small but enthusiastic group of guests, alerted by a text from Greg, had formed an honour guard to welcome the wayward grooms to their own party. Mrs Hudson and Dimitri. Violet, Molly and Sally. Mike Stamford and Angelo. Mary and James. The Watsons. Edie Murray. They threw bio-degradable petals and cheered the arrival of the Mister and Mister.
Random people wished them well; someone handed John a bottle of the Forrest Brewing Co’s Pobblebonk, with a slap on the back and “Congratulations! Goodonya!”
. We reconstructed events as best we could, once Mycroft could speak again.”
‘My best to John.’
“John!”
This story contains a big spoiler from the end of This Is Where I Leave You.
Twice Mycroft forgot that he had no left foot and tried to push into the floor to rise, once he had his hands on the chair, and squeal-grunted in pain as the healing stump slid across the floor. Nurses would be here soon.
John put the coffee pot on its shelf and looked for something else to clean, mostly so he wouldn’t have to turn around and face the man’s outrage at being spied upon.
John barked a harsh laugh. “Only if they were shagging.” Then he blinked and stared at Ella. Ella, professional as ever, just waited patiently for him to continue. “Did you guess that about us? That the three of us were. Shagging.”
‘I’ll give you a matter of honour,’ snarled Porthos. ‘Leave and won’t thrash you for the interruption.’
The redhead grimaced. “I’m not hiding. Not exactly. I just needed some air.”
John sighed misery. ‘I hate feeling so useless.’
Harry played with the unlit cigarette, turning it over and over in her fingers. “I. You’re kind. You’re good to me. I don’t deserve…”
“Still here, mate.”
Rosie had finally fallen asleep in the bright orange portable fold-out cot in front of the second sofa where Sherlock sat watching her. John, who’d relinquished Rosie to her cot after finally realising his own anxiety was keeping her fractious, watched Sherlock’s clasped hands, thumbs rubbing over and across his knuckles time and again. Self-soothing.
“Tolerably well,” said Mycroft.
Lestrade, panting, slewed the chair to a stop outside a hospital room with its door flung open and nurses converging on the spot, along with Mr and Mrs Holmes. The security staff who had been running in their wake halted too, trying to understand what was going on.
His grimace became wry. “You were twelve.”
“You can love more than one person at a time. And it’s okay.”
“I knew you would!”
“I know what you mean.”
Molly, also watching Rosie, nodded. “And her eyebrows.”

Ben scratched his ear.
John, head on Sherlock’s shoulder, closed his eyes. Sherlock kissed his forehead. He wasn’t sure what John thought of this display. He considered closing the window. Turning on the radio. Playing his violin.
Mycroft passed the second cake to his bodyguard but he ate the first, slowly, savouring every bite.
“I was thinking more that if we’re still mooching around in five years, we should make a pact to go shag-hunting at the gay bars together. You can find me hot, bossy women who remind you of Lauren Bacall and I’ll find you a nice Papa Bear. Or a silver fox.”
“Not bloody likely.”
Rosie farted in the water, giving herself a fright and she cried. John, laughing, smoothed her wispy hair back from her forehead with a wet hand. “There, there, you little tooter.” He tickled her chin and then her tummy and she smiled her gummy smile and cheerfully kicked more water into Sherlock’s face.
Billie Holiday's
(Amelia Airhead watched, nodding, the rapid rise and fall of arses, trilled a curious mew, then was startled by the sudden shouting and slipped upstairs to sleep in their bed while it was being so thoroughly ignored.)
“Don’t forget your hands,” murmured John, tightening his hold around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock reciprocated and returned to kissing John. He began to open his mouth. His tongue wiggled out.
“John Garrideb, who was interviewed about the sale of Musgrave, lives at the property next to us with his cousins, Howie and Nathan. At the time of Eurus’s death, Howie was 15, Nathan 18, and their father Alexander in his forties. John Garrideb would have been about ten at the time of Eurus’s death, but he lived in America then.  He came to live with the family a few years later, after his father went to prison on forgery charges.  Alexander died three years ago, and  John, Howie and Nathan continue to run the property as a cattle farm and agistment.”
“Let what happen?”
“She’d have liked today.”
“Mary used to say things like that to me.”
“A bit under the weather?”
“Go away.”
“I will. I do.”
“What would Howie know about her? They weren’t playmates. Unless they were.”
“You mean apart from my uncle and my daughter? I was sorry about Faith. I was fond of her, of course, but she discovered my little hobby and threatened to tattle. Hers is one of my favourite faces – when I told her I was going to kill her, then dosed her up so she wouldn’t remember. I liked her face so much I told her three or four times before I actually did the deed.”
And the next moment, a man had thrown himself at Sherlock, gathering him fiercely, ungently, into his arms…
Dazed, achingly hard, grinning, John looked at the closed door and listened, but he couldn’t hear anything. HE straightened himself up a little and went to the window.
“Just them?”
“Well it’s not mine.”
“How else are you hurt?” John asked urgently. His captain’s voice arose from the other side of the rocks.
“Fake date.”
John would have facepalmed but he didn’t have any hands left.
“There is that.”
“With Mycroft. With that bitch Norbury. With Ajay. With myself. With. With Mary. With everybody. I can’t. I can hardly manage myself. I haven’t got… there’s not enough of me left to deal with Sherlock too. With his. How he feels. I don’t know how to. Deal. With my own.”
It's the wedding night. Silky panties, moustaches, and a consummation devoutly to be wished for.
“I don’t know. I can’t. Read it. It’s. Greg stuck it on the fridge. It’s still there.”
Harry picked her way through the mess towards the man huddled at the end of the sofa, swiping images back and forth on his phone. She pushed a pile of papers off one end of the coffee table onto the floor and pushed two trays of untouched tea and sandwiches into the cleared space so she could sit on the end nearest him.
John managed a wan smile and rubbed his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder. “Don’t risk yourself like that again, though. Not without me there to. To have your back. I couldn’t… I can’t do this without you.”
John sucked in air through his teeth and huffed it out, angry. “It’s not okay. Nothing’s okay.”
“Good.”
He held Sherlock in his arms and sobbed out his fear.
“Well there you go. And it’s not only Mycroft. We love you, too. Giles and me.”
He closed his eyes. “I’m sorry. I know… that was my fault.”
“He’s got my arse.”
“Coffee but not beer, huh?” he observed sardonically.
So Mrs Hudson hardly paused in her sweeping out the entryway when she heard the shouting.

“And he’s looking to bring new talent in for a more entertaining imprint. Ben, Armitage Hux has written
“She was. Is.” They looked at her picture. Rosie kicked water in their faces and laughed, and neither could help grinning at her.
“You smoke, you happily drop a hundred quid on a bottle of scotch and you’re planning to fill your peg leg with rum. I’d adjust your claims, if I were you.”
Harry sighed heavily. “Yeah. I know. But ‘less miserable cunts than they’ve been’ lacks poetry, don’t you think?”
‘Thank you.’
“Watson! See, Papa’s got Pocks the Fox right here. See? See, Rosie! Observe!”
“It’s tempting. But they’ll have started wondering where we are. If we go back now, they’ll assume 'exciteable newlywed snogging', not 'pavlova blow jobs'.”
“You’ll like it.”
Sally and Molly left the happy Mr and Mr Lestrade-Holmes’s house hand in hand. Sally had a bottle of Australian Chandon Brut in one hand; Molly had nicked a couple of glasses.
“And white,” said Sherlock with a wiggle. “It is, after all, our wedding night.”
It was early for sleep but John and Sherlock were both ragged with exhaustion, and dozy with two decent meals.
“Shortbread, huh?” said Harry, “I’ll try not to burn this batch.”
John took Sherlock’s face in his hands, grip tight, looking for the dilation of his pupils.
(that was new),
Rosie sat in front of the pink dressing table that Mycroft had so kindly inflicted upon them last Christmas, watching, as Sherlock slid the 41st tiny pink hair clip into her hair, she beamed and shouted again “Mo’ WERRRRRR!!!” The 42nd clip slid in just above her right ear. She looked in the mirror and preened, John said she got that from Sherlock.
Harry sent two more pictures as they walked back to the flat: Rosie reaching out for the daisy that Molly was using to tickle her forehead. Then Molly’s face becoming a mask of horror as Rosie pulled a fierce little face while an unseemly noise emerged from her bottom.
“I know,” said Molly, nodding.
“Are you threatening to set fire to my wheelchair?”
“No I did not leave her in the cot.” Harry drew a breath on her irritation and blew it out. She’d had a series of texts from John about what had happened at the hospital. The bare bones, anyway. She’d called Molly later, who’d got the story from Greg. If John was being a twitchy overprotective dad who assumed his sister was an incompetent mother substitute, well, Johnnie had had a shit of a day and night.
“Clinic will take too long. Travel, waiting time, fussing about asking questions you already know the answer to. Besides, I saw a thing once in Tibet…” Sherlock had lifted their sick little girl into his arms and cradled her. “There now, Watson. Papa’s going to make it better right away, no waiting.”
Giles wrapped his arms around Sherlock; pulled him into a long, gentle hug. “You can’t will the pain away. You can only be kind, to each other, to yourself. Perhaps he sometimes feels he’d like to, but then feels guilty that he does. Perhaps he’s trying to provide what he thinks you need, but can’t. Whatever you’ve told him, tell him again.”
“I think I last saw Mycroft smile was when he was accepted to study here in Australia. That was nothing like this, though. That was satisfaction, I think. This. This is. Is.”
“Dr Hooper ministers to the dead. I’m not ready to have my heart weighed. I’m not dead. Unless I am. Am I dead yet? Mummy?”
“Now, now, now” murmured Sherlock, reaching for John’s shoulders.
; Greg said
But as they watched through that doorway, doctors and nurses appeared, obscured the view. When they were gone, Mycroft had been turned. The hospital gown had ridden up his thighs and Sherlock had the absurd desire to straighten the hem, give his overbearing big brother some dignity in his distress.
Then he leaned down again, dragged the scraps of silk out of the way with his teeth and licked-nibbled-sucked at Sherlock’s bared nipples, nudging his moustache against the flushed, sensitive skin (just the way Sherlock loved it) until Sherlock was writing and gasping and pushing up into John’s mouth again.
“Then let her be as nature makes her, yet without pain and fear. Let her be her own true self in heart and mind, and we shall love her perfectly.”
Maybe he’s undercover for that murky job of his? Sherlock’s said that Mycroft loathes field work, and this would be one good reason why. Minor government official, Greg’s arse.
“I think that so-called philanthropist Culverton Smith’s done something absolutely vile. I don’t know what. But I think he’s threatening to do it to your brother.”
Aramis grinned at his comrade-in-arms. ‘The Madame de Brouillette is a deliciously impatient temptress, and the Count’s library is full of very comfortable chaises longues.’
“We could hear Rosie crying from the front garden, I don’t even know-“
“Leaona was working as a barmaid when I met her. Australians in London often worked in hospitality. But she was a chemist, making use of her time and earning pocket money, she said, before she began her Masters at Oxford.”
'Hmm?'
“No,” said Sherlock. “I’m not much in the mood myself. Little Watson. That is, Rosie. Her crib is in our room. He can’t sleep if she’s not where he can see her when he wakes up. If he can get to sleep at all.”
on occasion.
“I love you, husband,” he said, “And if you want him to go, I will take him by the elbow and escort him from the premises.”
But this was Richard, not John. 500 years dead.
“No. Yes. No. I. John.”
John was so astonished by this turn he just sat there a moment before asking, “Is kissing important to the case?”
came the sound. In Sherlock’s voice. A message alert he hadn’t heard for weeks. Mary had made the recording and assigned it to Sherlock’s number.
Molly held Rosie and started to point to and name plants while Harry repacked the Backup Baby Bag.
But where the ever-loving
“Yeah. It is a bit. Sherlock’s lab faces onto the garden. I have an art studio in the place we’re getting married.”
Caleb began to shrink away, horrified at what had come out of his mouth, maybe frightened at how Phillip would respond. Phillip followed him slowly, shrinking himself down, crouching, automatically making himself small and unthreatening.
His sister bustled about the kitchen, reboiling the kettle and filling the cups he’d left out. He heard toast pop out of the toaster,  Harry fetching things from the cupboard and the fridge, then plonking a plate of toast with jam and butter cut into halves and a cup of tea in front of him.
That observation was absolutely and 100 per cent made in Dr Watson’s professional capacity. Yup.
And their hearts? Their hearts took flight, soared, and remembered always this first kiss.
,” he said.
My thanks to Winklepicker for all the Greek terms of endearment.
‘There’s some nasty new virus doing the rounds,’ said John, picking up the radio so he could listen to the report upstairs. ‘It’s related to SARS. Could be bad news.’
“And they’ve married good men.”
“I suppose our bodies are the matter of heaven and earth, then, and of no more consequence.”
“I don’t know,” said Leandra, dishing up bacon and fried eggs, “I think it looks rather dashing.”
A small but persistent fear, soon to be utterly crushed. Soon nobody can’t ever pretend they aren’t everything to each other, because they’ll have the same stupid bit of paper as everyone else.
“So you’re building up a profile and dropping hints you’re really into 17
“It’s. In hindsight. A little embarrassing.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
Double back, and under we go
And then he set himself to the long held ambition of new Australians, no matter how they came to be here.
John Garrideb stared at Sherlock in shock. So did everybody else.
‘How is John?’
If John had felt he had any choice in the matter, he’d walk away from the whole sorry business for a penny. He’d pay a penny to be shot of it, really, but he had no pennies and certain obligations to the staff. Watson and Sons Coffee Shop, tucked into an unfashionable part of Baker Street, was all the inheritance he had from his late father. Now Henry had passed, ironically enough from drinking the profits of this temperance coffee shop.
“It’s not like it even matters,” complains Sally. She’s here well before her usual midday stirring. Three coffees down already, a fresh latte already in front of her. “It’s a non-binding plebiscite,” she continues bitterly. “All this fucking around, all this ‘let’s debate if queers are actually human’ and there’s no guarantee it’ll even stick.”
“It’s all right, sweetie,” he called out to her, “Daddy’s just helping Papa look in the well. See?” He waved to her. Rosie stared at him quizzically, then scrunched up her eyes and yelled.
She laughed.
Mr Holmes found himself looking into the clear brown eyes of his eldest son in law. The shoemaker. Greg Lestrade, brought over by a quiet word from Dimitri Panopoulas.
I’ll be looking at the moon,
Giles hefted the plastic bag. John could see Sherlock’s rumpled suit, a stained shirt. The Belstaff at the bottom of the bag, taking up most of the room.
“Someone tried to burn me to death and frame me for murder, and I finally grew the fuck up. It was a long time coming, Johnnie. Now it’s your turn.”
“A nasal aspirator?”
The second glass they used to toast each other.
Someone tried to make Mycroft leave. They only tried the once. Leandra, Giles and Greg ranged around his wheelchair, and not one of the four of them took their eyes off Sherlock and John.
“Come home,” Sherlock said impulsively. Then he looked at his feet, jaw tight. “Sorry. I keep. Doing this wrong. This
“You were fucking adorable, from what I can see in the photos.”
“John?” Harry called out in a stage whisper.
He held his breath.
“Fuck you.” There was no venom in it. His voice shook. The words were full of the comfort of long use. Swearing at his sister, she at him, that was an old habit, full of rough affection.
John was nodding. “Yes, yes, of course you did.”
“Well, there was that. I kept it simple. A single secret passage, and a secret door to a single room. I’ve sent all my favourites here.”
“She can name them too,” murmurs John, mostly to Sherlock again.
She’d held his hand and they bumped shoulders and laughed and he forgot to feel stupid or foolish or
Richard, more content than aroused – yet aroused too – tilted his head against Khan’s shoulder and gazed at the stars as though he loved it as well as he loved his Khan.
Rosie was getting fractious in her discomfort as Harry placed her on the change table.  The table was laid out in almost military exactness – wipes and cream, antibacterial pump pack, fresh  nappies,  a cup of plastic flowers to distract her with.
It was somewhat ironic that John Watson didn’t believe in the foolish notion of soulmates, given that he was an angel.
Caleb… giggled. Awkwardly, kinda hiccupping, then for real, helpless giggles.
Sherlock might have ignored the lockdown, gone to crime scenes and been none the worse even if he caught this damned thing. The old drug-addled Sherlock might have suffered badly if he contracted the virus, but his new, happy, healthy self was fighting fit.
“Hey,” Caleb reached up carefully to remove leaves and flowers from Phillip’s dark hair. Phillip, captivated, squatted slightly and let him.
Aramis tilted his chin up, and an eyebrow with it.
(Except maybe, dear god please, one good night of sleep.)
Alone at last. The moment John and Sherlock entered their suite, Sherlock crowded John against the wall and kissed him like it was a fundamental requirement for survival.
John picked up the tie and smoothed it out. Not exactly his lucky tie, but it was fine. A bit doctorish, he’d always thought – reassuring and sensitive with just a hint of
Then Mycroft’s voice shouted in desperate despair: “Sherlock!”
“I told you,” said Sherlock.
“The view’s lovely,” said Sherlock dreamily, “However…”
Greg strut-sways back to the stage and he does his stuff on the boards as Siren Dippity, swaying and synching to McColl.
Garrideb continued to shake his head..
Giles nodded. “Yes,” he said.
every January usually has over 3000 people swimming it, and is the largest open water swim in the world.
“We can do this,” said John firmly.
“We have been born and born again into many worlds, but never one so welcome and strange as this,” he said. He kissed Richard’s fingers, palm, wrist, and entwined their fingers.
Rosie had dozed off in Sherlock’s arms, still nursing from the bottle. John pulled it away. Rosie made an aggrieved sound but settled again.
His crooked smile grew more wry. “No.” He sighed and looked past her shoulder at the two men and their partners. A ridiculous pop song was playing and the sons he’d known as dour and unhappy young men were grinning like idiots and dancing with their respective husbands.
“You are a clever clogs, then.”
John is convinced that if he doesn't tear his hair out before he's fifty it'll be a fucking miracle. In the meantime it's not possible for him to love two people more.
“Kiss for luck?”
“I want to think that’s true.”
He looked at Rosie, asleep in Harry’s arms. He carefully brushed toast crumbs from the soft little bee outfit Rosie wore. Organic cotton. Little golden bees all over it. Sherlock had bought it for her. Sherlock loved buying things for Rosie.
For the ninth trope of Xmas, my fanfic gave to me, a marriage that's arranged and fight over their library.
“You haven’t dosed me,” he said.
“What… are you…?”
“Thank you,” said Sherlock in earnest relief, instead of denying it or arguing that they’d been regularly deflowering each other in various ways for years now.
“Mrs H. made a brilliant pav for the occasion,” Greg added. He didn’t know precisely why both men flushed and laughed and pashed again, but he had good instincts. They looked just like Mycroft did whenever red ribbons were mentioned. Or worn.
“I don’t know that I will.”
‘You and the lady couldn’t wait?’
“Sherlock?” Leandra asked tentatively. Frightened.
“Four hours. Hardly. She tried. Humidifier’s a useless lump of plastic. Hardly ever. Not that’s obvious. Now are you coming with us to the clinic?”
“We’re women, dear, we always have quite the network,” Mrs Hudson told him. “Molly says Harry says you haven’t done the shopping in a while, except for enough formula to survive the apocalypse. I’ve brought casseroles; scones and butter; bread and a few other things…” This she said as she unstacked the contents of the trolley onto the table. “So you have a few more days before you need to worry. There we go…”
‘But you weren’t.”
Sherlock sucked John clean and released his softening cock with a pop too.
"John, we have to talk to our daughter," he said in front of their daughter, who ignored them both as she clomped back and forth in front of the fire in Sherlock's favourite Louboutin stilettos. "A Christmas beauty pageant John.
“Do you love him?”
“Sure thing, Mike.”
His eight strong legs took him swiftly to deeper water and he swam easily around the place where waves broke on the craggy stone and splintered wood of the boat. HE could see Sherlock lying as he had done, half in and half out of the water. His face was scratched and bruised where he’d been struck a glancing blow by the falling mizzenmast. The white sleeve of his left arm was stained dark with blood where ropes had scored along his bicep as they’d tried desperately to survive the storm.
“Not given the number of times she urged you to,” Sherlock glanced at Rosie, then mouthed
Greg Lestrade-Holmes waved across the rooftop garden to his husband, who’d been watching them both with a dark frown for some minutes. Greg grinned and nodded reassuringly. Mycroft, placing trust in his husband, let his scowl ease.
“John…”
Leaving one hand on the discovery under Sherlock’s shirt, John ran his other hand down, dipped under the waistband, slid further down.
“Why?” Greg’s heart is thundering.
“Where. Did. You. Get. My. Journal?”
“Vaping, huh? How’s that working for you?”
…Anderson had just handed her back after she'd farted as loudly as a baby is capable of farting, filling Lestrade's office with a stench profound.
John kissed Sherlock on the mouth and walked out. He got to the corner before he remembered where Sherlock’s minty-tasting mouth had most recently been.
Culverton Smith smiled cheerfully. “And once you’ve done it once, well. It got a bit addictive, I have to say. It’s so much easier now I have the run of the hospital. I like to visit them first. Tell them what I’ve planned, then, a little midazolam, and they don’t remember a thing.”
'Lovely.' John dropped a kiss on the top of Sherlock's head, then another more sensuous one on his lips. 'There was something the box, Sherlock. You probably missed it.'
“I am rather clever,” Sherlock agreed. “Look who I picked for a husband.”
Greg’s in an auburn curly wig, a sweet frothy frock and six inch scarlet heels. His make-up is divine. He’s on in 20 minutes to lip-synch
“Love you too,” Molly said, happy-drunk. “Gimme a kiss.”
As he waited to be untwanged and slowed, he asked his child about her day. The two-year-old said, "Holmeth ask me go potty in the loo." When John asked his daughter if she had, in fact, successfully used the toilet, she replied, "I weeded in m'nappy and had thereal."
…the child was an infant and Sherlock was staring at the her sleeping face, quite probably counting her eyelashes (again) and likely choking on the heart in his throat (again) and otherwise so utterly besotted that his words were a spontaneous whisper. "I love you mini-Watson."
“Sir, I understand you're upset, but it won't—”
Later, John had convinced a highly reluctant Sherlock to attend the police after-party being thrown by D I Lestrade’s department back at the station, citing his need to be more socially acclimatized. The party was attended by many of the officers who’d ‘helped’ them (Sherlock would insist on the scare-quotes around the word) on the case, including Sally Donovan, who as it turns out still holds something of a grudge against Sherlock for his long history of embarrassing her in front of her superiors.
Soon John and Sherlock will talk about the swim race and the echidna, and in passing Sherlock will (right where his father can see) solve two puzzling cases for Mary Morstan and the clients she defends without even seeing her case folders.  Soon everyone from the café will trade their favourite stories of The Baker Street Agency, its principal detective and his right hand man, impressing the Watsons, and allowing Sherrinford Holmes to see both his sons’ achievements with astonishment then quiet pride.
on their own while unsuspecting visitor is forced to take charge of child.
Then the music began.
“Yeah. Him and Johnnie both.  She was something else, Mary.” Harry’s chin quivered and she swallowed hard. “I liked having a sister, for a while.” She dashed at her eyes with the back of her hand, sniffed and adopted a fierce look.
“That ‘I’m a no good dad’ look. Tell it to fuck off. We had a no good dad. You’re not him.”
It was a small wedding, but full of people who mattered to the grooms, who danced well into the evening, until their last dance: Sherlock and John and their daughter Rosie in their arms between them. A family.
Buzzy continued to gaze, non-judgmentally, at Sherlock and his sentimental outburst.
“I made a bear! See!” A curl of cardboard makes the snout; a larger tube the body. She’s bound sticks together with string so that it has knees. She’s drawn the claws and teeth on in red.
“I. I. Suppose. I heard stories. That’s all. Just. I shouldn’t have spoken to the journalist who called. I. I was.”
“For god’s sake, you stupid man, don’t stand there, get back to him. Go. Run. John.
John turned another page, folded the paper into quarters and took up a pen. He began to fill numbers in on the Sudoku grid.
“Tragic history,” he read, scowling. “They’ve interviewed the neighbours.”
Carefully, he transferred Rosie into Harry’s arms. Rosie snuffled but settled again. John rose and went to the refrigerator. He moved a magnet and retrieved a letter. He took it back to the table and sat before opening it with his thumb.
Sherlock left Howie Garrideb weeping in the dirt and ran to his brother. He slid to his knees and wrapped long arms around a man he’d almost never seen cry, never seen lost, never seen broken. Sherlock pulled Mycroft against his body, tucked his brother’s face against his throat, held him tight and rocked him.
‘I know we did. I don’t call it a meeti… I am not even going to say it.’
“Your parents are here, Sherlock.”
“It’s more convenient for Rosie here.”
Go under! the East Wind blows
Mr Holmes Senior was dancing with Harriet Watson. The sun was setting over the river and the gardens. Mr and Mrs Watson were singing
What Sally does is scream and jump out of her chair. She runs to Molly and picks her up and swings her round and round and round and round, kiss-kiss-kissing her lovely girl, until they sort of collapse onto the floor, slow motion, still kissing.
“We’re…” Sherlock looked to John, who was watching Leandra and Giles play peekaboo with the now wide awake Rosie. “Better.”
John Watson, first mate of the pirate ship Scarlet, lay wounded in the shallows of the shore onto which he’d been tossed. He lay alongside the shattered remains of the boat on which he and the Captain had made their escape, the hull split into two or three parts around the rocks.
“I believe it’s time for us to take the karaoke stand,” said Mycroft, rising and holding his hand out to Greg.
She shouldn’t have blurted out, “John, Sherlock’s in hospital, he needs you!” She should have been more considerate than to assume that it was John’s job to save Sherlock, even though surely it was John whom Sherlock needed. John was struggling as it was. That was abundantly clear the moment he had let her into the flat, unshaven, unwashed, mouth set in a grim line and his eyes, the bags under them looking bruised, glaring suspiciously at the sunshine beyond his front door.
“Oh, you silly boy.” Leandra’s face was streaked with mascara-black tears.
Inside the box was a handful of syringes. Three needles still in their packing. A clear plastic ziplocked bag with a teaspoon of white powder in one corner. Another containing three pink oval pills. Another with a glistening blue square, designed to dissolve on the back of the tongue.”
“Is it a case?”
“Fair point.”
So John tugged Sherlock off the sofa and they stretched out on their bellies on the hearth rug.
“Has Rosie improved at all,” asks Faye, all solicitous, “or is she still drawing stick figures?”
“Well, the Holmes-Watson family will be moving along again soon, Musgrave Hall will be sold, and you’ll sleep better.”
“I know being here upsets you,” continued John gently, “but this is where who we are now began. I died, and my soul began to search for you at once. I… think I remember that.”
“Denebola. Literally ‘the lion’s tail.”
'I don't know yet.'
No. That's not true, not at all. On two counts.
gently, and then MOUTH FARTED SUPER LOUD.
“Like… what?”
Molly called. Greg was on the mend, though still weak. They sent their love.
“I only meant, it’s okay. It’s human.”
“Then three years ago, Sherlock came to me in my studio one evening and said to me: the barista here. He’s an interesting fellow. What’s his name? John Watson, I told him.  Why? I asked, because it’s an older brother’s prerogative to be nosy.”
“Yes, you do,” said Sherlock, “But you were never going to show her. Too modest.”
Later that evening, John settled an exhausted Rosie into her bed, 26 hair clips were lined up on the bedside table. The rest? Well the other 16 ended up in Sherlock’s curls. The wedding service went on far too long, and the only way Sherlock could keep Rosie quiet was by allowing her to “Pretty” his hair with lilac and pink hair clips pulled straight out of her hair and pushed into his own by tiny, inexpert fingers. And, just because it made her happy, he wore the damn things proudly for the rest of the day, quite ruining the group wedding photo’s according to Mycroft.
“Fuck, really? Everyone thinks he’s such a good guy.”
Rosie stirred on her little mat. She started to cry. Harry left tea to steep and swooped in to pick up her niece.
John stopped at the hospital shop first for fresh batteries, which he put into the bear. He checked the text Molly had sent in reply to his query and made his way to the wing where Sherlock had been placed.
Rosie ran around showing off the necklace she wore, bearing a toy magnifying glass, a toy thermometer, a little plastic frame containing a smiling picture of her mother. “Say aaaaahhhh!” she insisted before telling the guests, “All better!”
Mycroft’s coldness evaporated suddenly, and he blinked rapidly. He smiled uncertainly, cynicism clinging still. “She would have approved, do you think?” A note of hope was in his voice.
"You…refuse?"
“I had a dream about Mary,” John said. “Reminding me that shutting myself off never ever makes things better. She called me an idiot. She was very nice about it though. She said, the least you and Sherlock can do is to be idiots together. She said we’re pretty good at being idiots together, and were long before she met us.”
, badly, but with gusto.
Mycroft considers. “Not really. Allan’s deeply unpleasant and has begun to display the nasty side. I suspected it was there. Possessiveness is not attractive. Unless it’s mutual.”
“I should have seen it coming.”
They trammed it back to the city and found a place overlooking the Yarra to pour champagne and toast the happy couple, by now probably naked and honeymooning like rabbits among the detritus of Christmas decorations in every room, if their pashing behind the Christmas tree was anything to go by.
John grinned wolfishly. “Oh yes, I am.”
“Things were strained with John too, for a long time. He served in Afghanistan. I don’t know if you know that.”
“Very accurate skeletons,” says Sherlock, mildly for him. (Rosie’s ‘stick figures’ are her latest obsession, and full of superb detail, like placing a patella between the thigh bones and the tibia and fibula below. She even draws wrist bones and almost all of the phalanges.)
“You are my jewel, my treasure, my love beyond all things,” insisted John, swimming in his strange, fluid fashion across the top of the sea. “You are my heart and my home and I left everything to be with you.”
“Do you always count the kinds of things people are?”
Sherlock patted Mycroft's hand before releasing it. “You still do a flawless Lady Bracknell.”
“Norbury worked for me. I should have found her out in the previous inquiry. I certainly should have handled the confrontation differently. At least seen that she was armed. I am meant to be the smart one.”
“I thought Howie Garrideb was going to shoot you.”
Sherlock bent over, making himself small so he could press his face against her body and hold tight. Leandra stroked his tangled hair. “It’s all right, sweetheart,” she said.
Mycroft's mother kissed him, but he told her to stay with Sherlock. Greg Lestrade had slipped away, murmuring to John that he'd worry about statements later, but he had removed the memory card from the bear, on which Smith’s confession had been recorded, and left Bart the Beefeater for John to return to Rosie.
Greg opened the door into the boardroom of the Nicholas Building. Chairs had been set out across the room in what could only very generously be called rows. Some guests had tried to create straight lines with them; others – Molly, Sally and the people from the café – clustered into cheerful clumps.
“She draws skeletons,” says John firmly.
(For the record I'm a fan of Marie Kondo, who in part inspired this story.)
“Ha.” Humourless.
Rosie didn’t care, though. She had woken up and was playing on the floor, reaching for toys. She saw John first, then Sherlock, and made happy, demanding noises as she rolled on her stomach and waved her arms and legs purposefully.
“I managed to make lunch, anyway,” said Harry, resigned to her fate as a failed bread maker. “We can wait till the munchkin is settled though, yeah? Here, plant your arses, I’ll get coffee on. Yeah, I know. Tea for you, Giles. Skim milk, one sugar for you Lea. Sherlock, you want tea or coffee? Or maybe I should get you a Berocca, you still look a bit shady.  Fuck, you’ve got a way with that kid. She asleep?”
“COMING!” yelled Phillip. His eyes danced at Caleb, innuendo on the tip of his tongue.
“To be a publisher.”
“It’s from Mary,” he half explained. “Maybe it’s time I read it.”
Mummy took a photograph. Daddy beamed.
“Back where we started, but four rooms along. Leandra and I visited him earlier, but…”
The opening of the door was furtive, though. Not his parents then. Not the very absent Sherlock. Not Anthea, who’d never been furtive in her life. An assassin. How tiresome.
“Eat. You look like a bag of bones, and you’ve already got a boyfriend for that job.”
“Wouldn’t that be awkward?”
“Walking past now?”
“My life has been based on science and logic,” said Sherlock, holding John’s hands and looking into his eyes with such intensity that it seemed he wanted to build a direct channel of feeling between them. “Through John I have found my life’s work of deduction and consulting detective work. Yet it would mean nothing if not for love. My love for John, and his for me, give me assurance that there is goodness in the world. Love is extra. John’s presence in my life is an embellishment of it, not a condition, and surely it is only goodness that gives extras. John is the embodiment of all the good in my life, and my vow is that every day, I will endeavour to give that goodness back to him in equal or surpassing measure.”
“The ancestral home.” Sherlock frowned. “What’s to be done at Musgrave?”
“I. I don’t know.”
Finally, the doctor pronounced that Sherlock was not in danger, but would have to stay a while longer for observation, as well as his interrupted treatment for dehydration and exhaustion.
“You’re so pretty,” breathed John, before he scooted back a little further and bent down again, to lick at the head of Sherlock’s cock, then down the silk-encased length of him. John nuzzled at Sherlock’s balls, further down between his thighs, up again, suckling the cloth wet and clinging. Sherlock tried to spread his legs, but they were trapped by his trousers around his knees and by John sitting lightly on his shins.
The elm trees are guarding the castle and moat
The Obnoxious Date is clicking his fingers for one of the prettied up boys to take his drink order. Insufferable prick. Then he puts his hand on Mycroft’s and squeezes too hard.
“Fickle little thing,” Molly laughed. She waggled her fingers at Rosie and tickled her tummy. Rosie cackled.
“I’m not skulking,” Harry said.
“I’ll…”
"Demonstrate?"
“You don’t?”
“You should know that I aim to be a doctor, whether or not that’s a fitting hobby for someone of my family's
John rolled out of the boot first, gripping the lid to stop it raising too far. Sherlock slipped out behind him almost immediately. The car was away from them before he had a chance to shut the lid and hide the evidence of their escape. It would only be seconds before someone would notice it.
“I’ll tell you soon. Rest now, Sherlock. I don’t want you pushing yourself too hard. You still have a surgery to get through.”
Sherlock hesitated for a moment before he started tentatively moving again. John could tell he was trying to avoid it, but there was no room to manoeuvre. Plus, if anything, it was having an even greater effect on him now that they had acknowledged it. That he knew Sherlock was aware that his shimmying was arousing him only made John’s cock twitch in perverted glee.
Their lips met once again, and though John was initially resistant to the idea, he quickly melted into the kiss. He soon found himself losing some of his restraint, encouraged by Sherlock’s hands wandering over his back, and when Sherlock’s teeth grasped at his bottom lip and tugged it gently, he couldn’t help the small choked moan that came from him.
Gasping, Sherlock claws at Mikhail’s sweat-streaked face while a pair of heavy fists tries to get a grip on his collar and choke him with it. Mikhail boxes him in with his thighs, but Sherlock manages to wriggle away and escape under his arm, only to catch a fist out of nowhere that sends him sprawling backward.
It raised more questions than it answered. “What on earth are you doing?”
“Oh, you will,” he teases, grinning into his cup. “Unless you plan to spend every minute in the shade. Spanish summers can be pretty intense.”
Air whistles through John’s lips. “’Tis a tall order. You sure we couldn’t have just gotten the captain’s help?”
“Don’t,” John warns, raising his voice in the dry gaps between each stroke. “Don’t even try… that on me. I won’t leave you here.”
He was already sensing the change in his mind, even as he tried desperately to deny it. Before today, he’d always been able to compartmentalise his feelings for Sherlock. The man was his best friend. Platonic or not, this was the most important relationship in his life. They had killed for each other, and both knew the other was willing to die for them, and none of it hinged on some vague hope or the promise of a deeper, more intimate connection waiting somewhere on the horizon. They didn’t need it; they were already soulmates.
, that’s incredible,” he gasped, his heart pounding in his ears. His cock throbbed almost painfully hard between those lips, constricted by strong muscles as he was alternately being squeezed and sucked. Stealing a glance down at where Sherlock knelt over him, he could see the sheen of sweat forming over his brow, those dark eyes closed in careful concentration. It was the hottest thing he’d ever seen.
“Thank you very much, Mrs Patterson,” he replied, and she shook his hand.
His elbow plows into Sherlock’s ribs, making him release John with a grunt. John’s eyes are wild as he swings again, tripping over himself in a clumsy, water-logged advance. Sherlock moon-hops away from him, chuckling through the pain. “It’s okay, John. It’s shallow here. See? It’s totally safe.”
“Is that it?” he asks. “Is that the whole of it?”
A bump in the road shifted their position by a degree, causing Sherlock’s hips to grind directly along John’s half-hard cock, and a helpless moan escaped John’s throat before he could prevent it.
“Good lord!” Mrs Hudson exclaimed, her hand fluttering at her chest. “No, I’ll definitely be sitting this one out, thank you. This sounds like no game a dotty old lady like me should be playing!”
John beams at him. “You are amazing. Yes. How did you know?”
He hadn’t even realised he’d closed his eyes, until he felt a pair of soft lips against the tip of his nose and a gravelly voice floating over him.
Mikhail pushes away from the wall and John keeps his eyes fixed on him for the slightest provocation. Behind him, Mindy’s footsteps recede. “Listen to me, Mindy.” He tries for calm and authoritative; he doesn’t want to scare her any more than she already is, but if she’s in shock, it’s going to take some force to get her moving. “Go call security. Tell them to come down here immediately. Preferably with handcuffs, if they’ve got any.”
It’s not that he’s attracted to Sherlock. Not that he’d ever admit, at least. He had a reputation to uphold, and he most certainly
John huffed a tired, defeated laugh. They came to a stop outside their front door. John fished his keyring out of his jacket pocket, making quick work of the lock. Sherlock quietly followed him inside.
The floor is still wet, but John's knees are aching and Sherlock’s scrutiny is reaching unbearable levels. He needs to retreat, otherwise he’ll just end up blurting it out himself to break the tension. He heads for the stairs up, brushing past Sherlock whose stern gaze is still fixed to the floor. As he reaches the first step, Sherlock speaks. “You’re right, I should turn in. I’ll wash this properly later. Good luck on the boat.”
“Careful. Don’t smudge—“
John sinks beneath the surface with a sharp gurgle. Overtaken by instinct, he panics like a deer crashing through a school window. Feral and unseeing, he flails wildly beneath the water, but Sherlock is there in a flash to lift him up. When John re-emerges, he coughs out a mouthful of water.
. He just doesn’t get it, and John isn’t about to stop and explain it to him. He wouldn’t listen, anyway; Sherlock is always right, all the time, about everything.
“I suppose so…” said John, who by now was beginning to fidget uncomfortably. Their well-meaning attentions hadn’t helped at all; he was hard and desperate to press a hand between his legs. His fingers played at a belt loop in his jeans.
John trots up the stairs, finding the flat mostly unlit save for whichever switches Sherlock bothered to flick on his way to the bathroom. John watches the play of his shadow in the open doorway. “Alright, we’re going to Menorca,” he says, skipping the argument and going straight to the part where he gives in and just goes with it; life with Sherlock, in a nutshell. “May I ask why?”
Just as he begins to drift, John's phone pings with a new message. He fishes it out and holds it over his face, squinting tiredly at the glowing screen.
But God, his mind is a mess.
What has he done?
There’s a feat worthy of a front-page news spread: ‘
Before John can even process the instruction he takes off up the stairs, leaving John standing alone in the hallway with his coat hanging uselessly off one arm.
“Yeah. See, there’s the problem,” John interjects. “You decided all this on your own. Not once did you bother to ask me how I felt or how I wanted to handle it.”
After a delay that should by all rights embarrass him, John’s medical training kicks back in and he remembers that it’s a good idea to run a few checks on someone who has just emerged from a coma. Still, he can’t help but feel reluctant to untangle his hand from Sherlock’s, burying his excitement beneath something resembling a professional veneer as he sets about checking vitals and responses.
“I’m not going to bloody smudge it,” he mumbled. His tongue poked between his lips in concentration. After a few stars, he could feel Sherlock’s eyes burning at him. “What? I’m being careful.”
Seconds, hours pass. Days. He doesn’t know, can’t tell one disparate stretch of time from the next. Time has no meaning. It was lost somewhere on the open sea, and now he drifts, unmoored, in its meaninglessness.
“Um… Could you get me some tissues?”
Everyone watched intently as he slowly got up, turned, and approached Sherlock. For a reason he couldn’t fathom, the room’s anticipatory silence seemed to have grown particularly heavy all of a sudden.
He took John slowly, each time enveloping another inch of him, until John could feel himself encountering the back of his throat. He expected Sherlock to gag, but there was only the mildest fluttering and the cool rushing of air as he breathed through his nose. On the next pass, John almost lost it when Sherlock sank all the way down, blocking off his own airway and taking him deeper than he had any right to be inside another human.
“I have no idea what you mean.”
They held each other’s gaze for what felt like an eternity before Sherlock responded. “…Would that bother you?”
When John glances back up, he catches Sherlock’s eye from across the room and seems surprised to see him there. He arches an eyebrow as if to say, “Could you blame me?”
John’s head whips around. “What do you mean, ‘his legwork’?”
“I couldn’t,” he whispers. “I was selfish. I didn’t want you to leave.”
He scoffs. “God, no. Not even if it
“Blimey. Are we going to need a flowchart to play this?” Anderson remarked. Greg shot him a withering look, but the other faces in the circle looked equally dubious. It certainly did sound complicated, now that he was trying to put it into words. But Greg had never been very good with this sort of thing. He scratched his head and searched for a better way of putting it.
’. Sherlock’s manipulations may be self-serving, just like Mindy’s probably are, but it’s clear from the way he flushes up with pleasure that he wants nothing else from John but John himself; he gains nothing from having John by his side than the simple pleasure of his company and companionship.
That Sherlock himself has no hope of surviving, he feels, is a bygone conclusion. But if John can’t pick up this technique then he won’t make it back, either. That John should die out here like this, facing his worst fears— Sherlock can’t bear the thought of it. Knowing he’s to blame for it makes his heart clench in self-loathing.
Sherlock looks up at him in surprise. His curly hair lay stuck to his forehead in a wild mess. His skin has dried by now, but his soggy trunks still cling to his hips. His expression smooths into a mask of stoicism. “Not until the shifts change again.”
But like most boys his age, he’d sometimes forget to heed this warning, and there came a day that would alter his perceptions of himself forever.
in these fanciful notions of the perfect life? It never used to be so.
“Swim over here and I’ll tell you,” he calls back, concealing his alarm. It’s an odd promise, but it seems to spurn John into movement. He pitches forward into something that resembles doggy paddle more than it does a front crawl. His head remains stubbornly above the surface, disrupting the flow of his strokes, and his feet crash loudly against the water, leaving cascades of foam in his wake. Sherlock tosses his head in disapproval.
“You crafty bastard.”
, he types back, then takes a look at the attachment Sherlock sent him. It’s a police sketch of their target, a man named Mikhail Petrov, based on the description provided by the victim: Bald, muscular, with broad shoulders and a thick, sinuous neck. No distinguishing marks or tattoos. He looks otherwise fairly nondescript. John does his best to commit all the details to memory, but wonders vaguely how on Earth they’re meant to find him on board a ship with over three thousand people roaming around.
us lot smothering you in kisses?” Greg asked, incredulous. But he was grinning at the notion. Honestly, it wasn’t that much of a surprise to realise just how touch-starved a man like Sherlock must be. It was no wonder he was so eager to stay in the kissee’s chair. But the denial came quick and automatic.
At this, Sherlock’s expression hardens. He lifts his chin and stands taller on his feet. But the confident front is betrayed by the wavering tension in his voice, which comes out a fraction of an octave higher than his usual tone. “Respectfully, John, I don’t think you were dealing with it at all,” he says.
John’s fingers dig into his shoulders painfully, but he’s too happy to care. He fights his way back to the surface, clutching John’s warm body to him protectively. “You’re alright,” he urges, cupping John’s face and wiping the water from his eyes. “John, I’m here, I’ve got you. You’re alright.”
“Stubborn as an ox,” Sherlock sighs. “Clothes it is, then.”
“It was never about the sex when it began, with us and Mary. Why would it be about the sex now? I can live without sex. I lived without it for a long time. Never missed it then. It’s not. Even if we never. I. It’s. I love John. We both love Mary. Loved Mary. I have always loved John.”
“They’ve sorted themselves out then,” said Harry, ducking back.
“Come to Daddy and Papa!” John grinned, arms stretched out.
“Rosie,” he seemed to breathe. Then he hunched around the bear and wouldn’t speak.
“Well here they are, happy,” Mrs Hudson said. “With as much wealth as they need to be comfortable. With as much power as is good for them with stimulating work they love and are fulfilled by doing. With as much influence as is healthy. They’re respected, their expertise is sought and does good. They’re loved by their friends, and even their clients, and by men who make them laugh. What other ambitions for your children could a parent possibly have that make any sense?”
‘I’d best be off,’ said John.
When she babbled happily, Sherlock nodded and agreed with her deductions about Pooh Bear’s recent honey eating habits.  John read to her from
Kirsty singing
(See the end of the chapter for
“Aaaaah-boo! Aaaaaah-boo!”
“Yes.”
“He, John, and if I knew that there wouldn’t be a case.”
“I’m not hiding.”
“What is it, John?”
Pocks the Fox
“I think for me to stay longer than half way through the date before you come to drag me off on a case.”
Sherlock, tugging at the rope which had tightened around his waist and in loops under his thighs, winced at the sound of his mother’s voice gone shrill.
“And don’t you let your Papa put on his shocked face. He knows perfectly well I’ve put things in neat piles for him to reorganise later. He’s such a silly, your Papa. He makes such perfect messes, then gets ever so fussy about where to keep his case notes. What a silly Papa. But look what Gran found, Rosie Rose!”
After, Richard lay on his back, his aspect, fierce in life, now wreathed in bliss as he petted Khan’s hair. Khan, head on Richard’s chest, gazed over the landscape of his love’s naked body, each rise and fall a work of art to him. An isle unto itself, a precious stone, his heart's realm, his Richard.
She sensed Molly’s hand nearby and looked down to find an offering of tissues. She snatched at them crankily and shoved them against her eyes.
“Sherlock?” asked Molly tentatively.
“I thought you burned it.”
“Low tar.”
Sherrinford watched his boy’s discomfort melt away under that loving gaze. No sharpness there in John’s blue eyes, and none at all in Sherlock’s grey ones that were so like his mother’s. Sherlock had always been such an anxious boy in company, but here with his husband he seemed completely at home in his own skin.
Apart from that one time, Sherlock is careful never to take Pocks the Fox with him when he has to go away from his family. He tries not to take Rosie’s toys at all, especially nothing in the top three, because he and John can definitely to without ever having another Rosiegeddon. (They’ll have them anyway. Her parents are drama queens. Being overdramatic goes with the territory.)
“Yet here you are sitting behind a herb garden, chugging champagne and hiding from your dad.”
John suffered mortal pain that day; mortal fever after. The everlasting angel almost died.
Sherlock gave him a cranky look but continued. “You say you have prowess in this stupid art of mashing lips together?”
. For
“I don’t believe I’ve made myself the father they’d welcome.”
He told himself he was a doctor for crying out loud. He'd been in a war zone, attended crime scenes, lived with Sherlock.
‘He’s tested positive,’ said the doctor, whose name Sherlock never could remember. He only ever remembered the sound of the blood rushing in his ears. ‘We need to test you too.’
“Oh,” he said dumbly, unlocking his chest, making himself breathe.
“Kiss me.”
John has come home to discover he’s still wearing his pyjamas under button up and coat; Sherlock has dealt with the horror of getting up to pee and without thinking asking the restaurant gathering “Does anyone need to go to the toilet?” (Molly decided she did.)
“And he’s always a grumpy-bum,” said Sherlock mock-sternly.
9.45am.
9.40am.
John makes growly noises to make Rosie giggle. Sherlock, a hand on John’s back, praises the obvious  bearness of the bear and asks its name.
Smith ducked his head, modestly. “I aspire in my modest way to be the most prolific, though recognition will have to wait until after I’m dead.”
‘Call if you need anything,’ said Sherlock.
'Who indeed?'
Harry raised an eyebrow at Molly, then shrugged. “Okay.” She leaned towards Molly, Rosie in her arms, and took a threefie, the two women smiling everything’s-good-here smiles over the baby’s head. Harry sent it off to John.
“I’m so sorry, darling,” said Sherlock to John in between fox-face-bounces. “I picked up what was nearest. I meant to get the bee.”
“Go away.”
“I am well,” Richard agreed, “For I am with thee, and therefore I cannot be ill.”
That’s when Leia saw Armitage and Rey catch each other’s eye and grin impishly, and saw that beneath the table, their feet were touching. They both looked adoringly up at Ben who grinned back, besotted.
“You’re not unlike Mary yourself, you know.”
“John, he barely managed to say her name during our childhood. I certainly never heard him recite the ritual, and we never left coded messages to each other. Victor and I did for a while, but our method was very different.”
‘Don’t be absurd. Of course I’ll wait up. Don’t argue.’
A tap on the door. Greg popped his head inside, and he grinned like a besotted teenager at Mycroft.
Sherlock wasn’t there.
John's sunshine face was gone, replaced with an over-tired frown-cloud.
“I’m sorry about the Scarlet,” said John.  “No chance she’s still out there?”
“Would it surprise you to learn that this humble shop of yours has been used as a front for some truly unsavoury business?”
John almost jumped out of his skin at the low voice, almost in his ear. He whirled around to find that the handsome man had an uncommonly beautiful smile as well.
“No custard.”
“Yup.”
“Show me.”
“That boy is up to something,” said Mrs Hudson.
“You got it. Text. Park selfies. The lot.”
“You can’t work it out?”
“It’s your fault,” he finally said.
If Sherlock read any of John’s intent, he said nothing. He had intentions of his own.
“I’m not crazy,” he said.
. You romantic devil.' John leaned right so he could get his fingers more easily into his left pocket. He withdrew a slip of paper. Unfolding it, he found a new instruction.
Sherlock laughed without taking his eyes off Rosie’s face.
Sherlock watched John’s hands on him, licked and bit his lower lip. He seemed about to say something, so John soft-pinched both nubs, and speech was thwarted into a moaning gasp, and Sherlock’s hips lifted off the bed.
“That was very wise, what you said back there,” says John. “Very mature.”
“Pobblebonk?”
Rosie grunted a little, then made a surprised sound and closed the little space between them, until she could grasp Daddy’s thumb, Papa’s crisp, clean trousers in wet fingers. The men moved so that she could get between them, bumping against knees and thighs, then pull herself into sitting and held her arms up to them.
“I really, really like you,” Phillip said right against Caleb’s ear, full of promises, and out they burst from the elm.
“To the letter, Johnnie, just like every other time.”
“I think there’s harm in sending her somewhere else. It would upset you and John, and that would upset Rosie. You all just do what you need to do. All right?”
“Thank you, sweetie.” Molly booped Rosie on the nose and the little girl cackled again, before tipping over from where she sat against Harry’s thigh.
The silver and oyster references come from ACD's The Dying Detective.
“You’re loved, Harry. And not because anybody has to.”
“Yep.”
“My frock coat is lost and my best boots. My breeches will also never be the same again.” But that strain was still there.
“The curse and hope of convict Australia,” continued Greg, “was that people were sent for penance and punishment, and when their time was done they remade themselves.”
But his Captain was on the other side of these rocks, and maybe hurt.
“Daddy is used to big fusses,” said Sherlock to Rosie, still rocking her slightly. “Papa is just one big fuss all the time.”
with them.)
At first John thought Sherlock packed their things with specific results in mind. The book, the pen and the fact Sherlock never took Rosie’s current favourite dummy or toy said yes; the gnawed on rusk and the sock said no.
“That’s good too.”
Porthos, comfortably abed in the small hours of the night, thought for a moment he was dreaming when his door crashed opened to reveal Aramis in boots and hat and nothing else, save for a bundle of clothing clutched against his chest.
“What’s the occasion? Do you have a date?” That question was motivated purely out of matey curiosity too.
“Here,” he said back, not a whisper but almost too quiet to hear. He was standing at the kitchen table, arms folded, looking at Rosie, asleep belly down on the floor among her soft toys.
'Quite.'  Sherlock bit the 't' off and resumed his inspection of the box.
Deep in sleep, her saw her face. Merry blue eyes, teasing-fond.
“You did. It was my fault but you still left.”
“You can eat one-handed. I made spag bol. Not spag bol. No spag.  So we’ve got macaroni bol. ” She arched an eyebrow at John. “What? I
“Let’s walk a bit before we go back in,” suggested John.
“Any ghostly replies or visitations?”
But perhaps he didn’t miss it as much as he thought he did, because after speaking to his mother by the old well, he’d taken five purposeful steps towards the gate, remembered he should tell John he’d be gone for a while, thought that John could do with a walk and decided Little Watson could use the fresh input for her data-hungry brain, and was back at the motor home before he knew it.
