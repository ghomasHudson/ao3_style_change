A twist of a needle and the words spilling from Cas’ lips go deep and sonorous, filling the room the way Dean had always imagined an angel’s voice should. They change, too— the cadence of the syllables is different, something about it seeming… old, maybe. Primordial. Dean doesn’t think he imagines the look of confusion on the suited dick’s face. “I… think I’m close?”
Systems scans and current assays are coming back clean, so it’s not something seriously wrong with him, but after so long going almost totally without, it’s odd to experience
In the week that followed, they had established three things: one, that Deerfield was a terrible place, two, that the dump sites were being used on a rotating basis, and three, that the bodies showing up at the dump sites were starting to look less like Lovecraftian horrors and more like a skinshifter caught fatally between shapes. Sensing that they were on a timer, Sam had gone to the local library to research what might cause the mutations while Dean staked out the next dump site on the rotation.
“Oh,” says Doctor Bagel, jerking Dean out of his thoughts. “Wow.” He’s peeled away the layer of gauze covering Dean’s skin, exposing it to the air and their sight. Instead of the usual big, red, blistery, peely patch, though, there’s… well, Dean doesn’t know what they are. Intricate crimson lines curl over the back of his hand and up his arm, forking off like the branches of a tree. They cover his entire forearm, most of his bicep, and continue up his deltoid and around to his shoulderblade; he doesn’t have a mirror, but he suspects they extend right up his neck and onto the part of his right cheek that’s been bandaged. Along the thick ‘branches’ and at the places where they fork, there’s some blistering and peeling, as if whatever caused the marks was hottest at those points, but that’s it. The rest of his skin is just rosy, like a mild sunburn.
. Can you believe it? Enormously powerful celestial being, nearly as old as the Archangels, and he’s scared of the dark!”
human arms and hands (????) and proceeds to very quickly, very efficiently produce some sort of salve using the materials available. When it finishes, the hands grasp the mortar, vanish with it into the glowy tangle of jello-pasta, and the same twisting-scooting movement happens again. “You have exacerbated your injuries. You are fortunate Abaddon is sadistic, or you would have died much earlier. Please do not complete the task for it.”
Chuck, to his credit, doesn’t say much of anything, and doesn’t ask Dean about his feelings or even send any stupid mushy looks whenever he talks about Cas (and why would he? Dean’s voice was totally steady through all of it. No shakes or cracking or any of that, cause he doesn’t do that). He just stares ahead and drives, occasionally chewing on one of his candies; even after Dean finishes, he’s still quiet, apparently deep in thought.
Sam is not responding the way he should be. Instead of nodding along because Dean is completely right about this, he’s looking at Dean like he’s started speaking in tongues or something. “Dean… dude, I’m not saying you’re seeing things, but… the eyes in her dress aren’t blue.”
“Huh,” Dean says. “You do, don’t you?” He thinks about it for a moment. A few years ago, he’d been totally weirded out by it, but after everything else that’s happened, he’s… almost relieved. At least Chuck won’t ask questions or sit there pitying him. “You’ll get used to it pretty quick. Go do your thing; I’ll be back in five.”
especially that really bright one. Not that Dean can really argue with the guy about being a bit suspicious of the spooky, huge
Like every other mech, though, Gabe activates a personality shunt at the time of launch, and then it really does resemble the mythical, winged beings of pre-Diaspora religious lore-- it’s quiet, emotionless, and driven solely by its Watch directives.
Sammy, his clunky second-generation berth not so much ‘nestled’ as ‘crammed’ in between the RK-NGL’s cutting-edge, almost miniature creches, doesn’t reply. The berth’s LS unit emits the same, soft, green
The blue thing’s warm press seems to seep through his whole body, soothing, but it’s not the right light, not the right shape— not the one that pulled him free.
He remembers the bite of the needle, the excruciating pressure— before Alastair had taken over with his razor, there had been some bat-faced freak with a particular fondness for them. Seeing Cas enduring the same horror sparks a vengeful, protective fury Dean didn’t even know he was capable of feeling for anyone but Sammy. “I don’t know who the fuck you are, pal,” he snarls, drawing his angel blade and striding across the room toward Cas and the bastard torturing him, “but if you don’t get those things outta him, I’m going to—”
Dean throws his hands up with a growl. “Fine! Fine, Jesus, okay! No talking to Crowley. Whatever.” Slamming himself back into his chair, he snatches up
Hannah stands from her chair and sheds her blanket. “I would not doubt it.” Another boom and a crack cut through the air, and she goes rigid.
Dean blushes, this time out of a shame he thought long since repressed. It transmutes to defensive snark quickly enough, but the reminder that he’s down as a
The Takaoka-REST opens on its own just as Dean’s internal comm system starts jangling with a direct call instead of a ping. He pushes out of the pod and catches the external handle, throwing a glare Gabe’s way.
At a loss for words at that pronouncement, Dean and Sam sit in silence as Doctor Bagel works on, hands as steady as his blue-eyed gaze.
Sam glanced between Dean and Cas for a few quiet moments. “I’m not going to ask,” he said at length, dropping his hand to the wheel. “I’ll call when I’ve made sense of the manuscript.”
The woman sinks to her knees. “I don’t understand?” she says, staring around herself in a daze. “It… Winchester?”
Dean keeps pointing upward, because the eyes in the lady’s dress had turned blue again sometime just after the last nurse’s visit but just before Sam showed up. “The eyes, man. In her dress. When I first woke up last night, they were all this crazy blue colour, just like now, but when the nurse wakes me up a couple hours later, they’re…  not. Then I look down at his ID tag, and his picture’s got the
Dean,” Castiel growled, stepping into Dean’s space so that those curved plumes arced over Dean’s head like a canopy. “I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent— to love you as you are now is no stranger than loving you before these changes were wrought.” A second set of wings flared behind him, broad and powerful, and flickered away again. “May I, Dean?”
go back to that library, get your tablets and your papers, get your ass to my room and grab the angel blade under the bed, lock your rocks and your papers in one of the salted boxes, then shut yourself into the dungeon. You cover those doors with every protective scribble you know, got it?”
Dean waves a hand. “Nah, dude, it’s cool. Was kinda planning to get some sleep myself.” Maybe not right away, of course, not with this latest revelation to think about, but sleep is definitely going to happen sooner or later. He wiggles his toes in the footwell and fiddles with the seat until the back reclines. “’S roomy for a little foreign car.”
Dean grimaces. “Fuck off,” he tries to growl. It comes out as more of a breathy whimper; sitting up is so not an option. “Where’s my brother?” He remembers most of the fight— Hannah holding the doors, Abaddon wrecking his shit— but he only remembers seeing mega-Sammy for a moment before passing out. “Where’s Kevin? What happened? Was… was I asleep?”
Parts of the thing flicker and swirl sort of… regretfully? He’s not sure how jello glow pasta does regret, but there it is. “You have been unconscious for some time. Three days, I believe.” It ripples some of its tendrils in something that looks oddly like a shrug. “After you passed out, Metatron fled and Abaddon engaged Samuel and Gadreel. Your leg was collateral in this combat. Samuel and Gadreel were able to severely damage the Knight and prevent it from breaching the rest of the bunker, but it escaped before the killing blow could be delivered.” As the pasta-thing speaks, the mortar makes another appearance, along with the very human hands and arms that Dean had seen earlier. Two fingertips dip into the mortar and come up smeared with some sort of paste. “Remain still, please.”
If he waits until he’s sure Kevin’s turned the corner into the library before running like hell for the garage, no one’s around to give Dean shit about it.
Metatron narrows his eyes. After a moment of glaring at Dean, he huffs out an incredulous laugh. “Suit yourself.” Gadreel-in-Sam collapses with a thump, and Metatron props his feet up on his back again. “Since I have you here, though, let’s get down to brass tacks before I deal with you. Where’s Castiel?”
Within decades, intrasystem cruisers and starliners had dumped mass, shed cubic meterage, and stripped out all unnecessary components. Elegantly curved routes weaving from star to star had been abandoned and redrawn for straight, unwavering lines: Point A to Point B, no frills, no stops. Fins, wings, and rings had been scuttled, thrown to the blast furnaces, and re-forged with only brutal efficiency in mind.
Or maybe crossed the path of some dumb kid’s toy laser. Dean’s seen that before, too. Either way, it’s nothing worth freaking out over. He archives the readouts along with the rest, closes up shop in the fore array, and grabs the Watch toroid’s hatch with an easy swing.
and I’ve still got everything else on my list that needs doing,” Dean grumps. He pats Sammy’s berth gently, then twists so he’s perched against the gangway that runs between the rows of creches. “I mean… I’ll get over it, dude, but seriously. You gotta admit it’s pretty dumb.”
The falsetto squawk of protest Dean’s elbow to the side draws from Sam is almost worth the way the Impala swerves. “Wreck my baby and I’ll drag your giraffe ass outta Heaven myself, bitch,” he scolds, barely dodging Sam’s retaliatory swat. “Besides, it gets weirder— it’s
The creature nimbly hopped aside to avoid Castiel’s folding wing as he pulled himself into a seated position. Clucking softly, it watched him until he was settled and then pushed its dropped object at him again, its posture almost… beseeching?
Dean touches his right cheek, where he knows the upper ends of the branching red marks Cas left are plainly visible, even through his stubble. He weighs the pros and cons of telling the whole damn story. “Cas,” he says at length, deciding to leave the director’s cut for another day. “He had to go through me to get the other guy.”
“Not any more,” Dean replies. “Someone ‘blew the Gates wide open’, apparently, and it’s enough that Angel Air is back online. Megatron’s been moving to deal with the folks he sees as threats, but I figure he’s gonna be on the back foot for a while as he deals with pissed off angels, so now’s as good a time as any to get some information, right?” He ducks out briefly to run for and rummage through the storage room, returning with a clay flask of holy oil, chalk, and the parts for an angel summoning. "We're gonna have to ask some other angel, though. Cas isn't picking up."
“You’re awfully sharp today, Twinkle Toes,” Abaddon coos, circling Dean and flexing wickedly sharp, crimson talons that drip with the tar that seeps down its arms. Dean grunts at the impact of a vicious telekinetic blow, staggering sideways and only just avoiding a whistling swipe of those claws. It parries his attempt at a counterattack with a blasé flip of a wrist. “Did your prophet teach you some new tricks? I’ll have to get in on that before I tear his little heart out.”
The doctor holds Dean’s arm up again. “Lichtenberg figures,” he says. “They’re the tracks of electricity as it moves through an insulator. They’re not usually so extensive, though— at least, not on living people, and usually more, uh, charred. I've never seen them like this.” He looks up and meets Dean's eyes, solemn. “Something very weird is happening here, Dean. I don't know how you've healed so fast-- I
“It is the least I can do.” The thing stands there for a moment, still unsettled, and then gives a surprisingly human sigh. One of its tentacles slides through the air toward him. “Sleep. We will speak again.”
Dean didn’t have any objections to that. He was stubborn, yes, but he wasn’t stupid, and a giant bird-man was not going to win Sam any points in Wichita. He did direct a questioning look at Cas, though, and was surprised when the angel responded with
need help. “Are you calling Castiel? I really hope you’re calling Castiel. How are they gonna get down here, anyway? All the angels are grounded.”
He shares the squished little Watch toroid with two maintenance mechs, GG4-BE and B3N-N1. Dean hates unit numbers for mechs as a matter of principle, so he calls the two Gabe and Benny, respectively; in the year of prepwork before their AIs had gone into hibernation for the transit, they’d been pretty happy about it. They’re quiet now, of course, but they still respond to the nicknames as well as their actual designations, and Gabe still plays games with Dean during its downtime to help keep him from getting too bored.
Metatron huffs. “Same reason I want you dead, really. You’re a threat.” He leans over to smile at Ezekiel, but the cowed angel never once looks away from Dean. The lack of response earns another kick. “I’m thinking I’ll add Gadreel here to the list.”
Gadreel doesn’t respond; he just shakes and stares blankly, eyes still on Dean but gaze a million miles away. Tears track down his face, spilled when Metatron had shaken him. As much as Dean wants to murder the bastard— he’d
He gets one last, raised, ‘I-know-what-you’re-up-to’ eyebrow before Kevin caves and goes back to the tablet, running his finger over the tightly-packed lines of runes. “See? Right here,” he says, tapping the stone. “It says, ‘
The communal chat flips to a map of the RK-NGL. A single passenger berth is flagged; the tag next to the flag indicates that the berth, reserved by one Professor James Novak, doesn’t appear to contain a passenger.
Bartholomew draws another needle and poises it directly over the center of Cas’ forehead. Dean lunges forward as he draws it back, manages to get a hand on Cas’ shoulder and the other around the bastard’s wrist, but the angel’s strength wins out, and the needle plunges home.
Dean’s close on her heels, but as soon as he hears footsteps behind his own, he skids to a halt. “No, no, no,” he says, catching Kevin before he runs past. “
Dean awakens to the beep of a heart monitor. Opening heavy-lidded eyes, he can just make out a blurry image on the ceiling and a masked person doing something near his face. “No, don’t poke at that,” says the person through his mask, and moves Dean’s hand away from his face. Dean isn’t sure what he’s not supposed to poke at, but he complies. He stares up at the thing on the ceiling— it’s some sort of painting, the one with the lady in the gold dress with all the patterns of blue, blue eyes.
The foot-shuffling and rumbling engine noises stopped. “It is not a ‘kinky angel thing’. It is a courtship dance,” Castiel replied in his usual flat, gravelly tone.
curious to know just how far you’ll take it.” It bends down until Dean can feel the foetid, rot-warm air that flows from the void of its face. “You’re right, of course,” it says, and Dean screams as the force holding him motionless tightens, cracking ribs and completing the break in his left arm. “You’d give up your own humanity to keep your little family breathing, wouldn’t you?” The grip tightens again; Dean’s vision begins to go black at the edges. “Your soul, the world and everything in it, even your own brother’s free will— why, Dean, I’m frankly impressed.” Abaddon runs its hand through his hair; grips tight and yanks his head back. He’s almost grateful that he can’t feel anything over the pain in his ribs and arm, because he can see the maggots and sludge as they drip down his face, past his eyes. “Still. It’s better that I nip this one in—”
“Been haven’ the weirdest dreams, Sammy,” Dean says as he stretches just outside a gas station in some tiny Kansas town. There’s a persistent ache in the back of his right shoulder that’s only getting worse as the drive drags on.
after nightfall would invariably result in being ambushed by said thing; nothing involving the Winchesters in any capacity could have gone otherwise.
Abaddon runs one slick, grub-covered hand over Dean’s cheek; visceral nausea rips through him as everything in his being rejects the slimy, squirming touch and sulfurous stench. “It’s almost a shame,” it muses while one sharp claw-tip traces the lines Dean knows are still there on his face. “This is such an
Chuck brings the car to a halt and turns. He stares at Dean searchingly for a moment or two. “Huh,” he says, sounding almost surprised. “You’re serious?”
about who he was just so he could get his mitts on your baby brother.” He grins, toothy. “This is the angel who’s
?” Sam hissed, slapping a hand over his eyes. He had to fumble around blindly before he could deposit their carry-out on the crappy motel table. “Is this a kinky angel thing? What the fuck, dude?”
he gasps out mentally, throwing the prayer out as widely as he knows how. Somewhere else in the garage, Metatron swears and Hannah lets out some sort of shout in Enochian, drowning out the sounds of blades clashing.
“You stay right there, Dean,” he snaps, swatting Dean’s hands back to his sides. “Don’t touch those; they’re all that’s keeping that Grace where it is.”
The collar jangled as it was kicked aside, apparently to make room for the creature. Toes so close to Castiel’s crossed legs that its claws scraped faintly over his jeans, it settled back on its heels and supported itself using the wrists of its wings (where, Castiel noted, there was a sturdy, clawed thumb where a typical bird’s alula might have been) as it carefully nestled down nearer Castiel and the phone.
“There,” Dean interrupts. “That part. The way you’re reading it, God gives the angels Heaven, right?”
. Castiel was there in a clap of wings and a gust of wind, though, waiting in the library, coat and blazer cast to the side, shirt and pants unbuttoned, and Dean could no more refuse the mesmerizing divots of Cas’ hips or the curl of Cas’ feathers than he could turn down homemade apple pie fresh from the oven. He tried, of course— croaked in mortified not-quite-protest, cloaked himself in his wings, tried to explain without words that he wanted (oh yes he
. “Dude. Listen. Abaddon wants everyone dead, but Metatron? He’s here for you, dude— you can read those tablets, which means you can throw a wrench in his plans, okay?” Sucking in a deep breath, Dean screws up his courage, chokes down his pride, and grabs Kevin in a brief but tight hug. “Kid, you’re important ‘cause you can fight this guy with your crazy prophet mojo brain, but you’re
A bit of snooping around the rest stop after doing his business turns up a battered first aid kit; Dean relieves it of a strip of alcohol wipes and a roll of gauze. He rejoins Chuck by the Subaru and sits down in the open passenger side. “So the doc called ‘em ‘Lichtenberg figures’ or something. ‘S what happens when you get hit by lightning, but he says they’re usually not… well, most folks just die when they’re this bad.”
— the whole situation is Dean’s fault as much as Gadreel’s, and he can’t find it in himself to hurt someone who’s so plainly suffering, never mind someone wearing his baby brother. The memory of Castiel, huddled in his corner, clutching his blade, comes to mind again, and there’s
“Who built Heaven, Hannah?” asks Kevin. He shuffles uncomfortably when her wide-eyed gaze falls on him. “We, um. We need to know. Who built Heaven?”
Cas looks a little bewildered when Dean pulls him to his feet and divests him of his beige coat and suit jacket, but when Dean starts tugging him toward the jungle gym, his face lights up with understanding.
Dean pastes on a smile when Sam sits in the chair by the bed. “Just… tell me what happened, and we’ll go from there, okay?” Sam says.
Hannah sniffs. “Dislike you and Castiel though I might, I can safely assure you that my feelings toward Metatron are more negative on an
“So they’re all freaked out ‘cause everything’s even darker than before and they weren’t expecting that, but they’ve got this nerd job to do, but then the broken soup starts lighting up into stars, and then they
Oh! If you're in the Chicago area and enjoy live Celtic, folk, and jazz music, come on by the Celtic Knot Pub in Evanston-- I'll be performing with a local musical group on the 18th and every other Tuesday thereafter. The fish and chips are to die for, too, which is never a bad thing.
“That’s right,” the masked figure confirms. He smooths something white over Dean’s cheek. “I’m Doctor Boeglin, Dean. Do you remember what day it is?”
“I said hello when I walked in, Kev. You had warning.” Flipping open the top book in his pile, he skims the table of contents and ignores Kevin’s staring.
Abaddon laughs. “Oh, that’s interesting,” it purrs. “I didn’t know you could see past the costume.” It gestures down its body with a sumptuous wave of one taloned hand. Wriggling grubs splatter to the floor in a puddle of black ichor with the motion. “Do you like? They
in those notes of yours about those marks, or a big black space thing, or the aliens at the beginning of the Universe.” At Chuck’s incredulous expression, Dean rolls his eyes. “I know, I know, crazy talk, but seriously. Whatever happened with Cas is connected to all this, I’m sure of it, 'cause if Heaven’s really like you’re saying, I think I saw it the way angels do, dude. I gotta know something I've seen might help me get him back. If you won’t do it for me, do it for him.”
The lights flick on; groaning, Dean squints against the glare and aims an irritable glance at the nurse, an older man with salt-and-pepper hair. To his credit, the nurse has the good sense to look somewhat apologetic as he moves to check over the machines around Dean. “Good to see you awake,” he says. “I’ll be in every two hours; it’s protocol with concussions.”
Taken aback by Dean’s tone, Sam does his concerned puppy face. “Nothing from Cas, and, uh, no, I don’t?” He rolls his eyes when Dean makes an offended noise. “Dude, you’re
Hannah’s in front of the garage doors when Dean catches up to her, palms pressed flat against the metal and feet planted at shoulder width; she looks immovable, every line in her body tensed as she braces the doors. Whorls and loops of blue-white light spurt from her skin and clothing as if under pressure before being sucked back out of sight by some unseeable force.
A blurry face swims into view, then resolves as Dean’s vision clears. Kevin looks as exasperated as ever, but he also looks
Chuck stretches out in the reclined driver’s seat and huffs out a laugh. “It’s no Baby, but it gets me around.”
an asshole, instead of being a dude with a brain that just goes and says all the shit that everyone else probably says in their heads when they’re pissed off, anyway.
A knock sounds at the door to Dean’s hospital room. “It okay if I come in?” Doctor Bagel asks, glancing between Dean and Sam curiously. He has a rolling table with gauze and burn cream, so Dean bottles up his confusion and puts on his Nice Normal Patient pants. His smile is enough for the doctor to continue into the room. “I have good news for you, Dean,” he says, settling into the chair Sam’s just vacated. Dean offers him his bandaged arm. “Everything’s looking good on your chart, so I feel pretty safe discharging you to your brother’s care today. I’m going to change your bandaging, and then I have a few prescriptions for antibiotics— Sam, I want you to watch me change these, just so you know what to do.”
I’m gonna have to stay on VPN the rest of the time in case there’s any other intranet fuckery going on. Can you believe this shit?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, dude. You. When Kevin woke up as a prophet, we… sorta thought you were dead. Becky said you’d broken up with her and then sorta vanished or something, and all of your books are online now?”
talking with Crowley,” Kevin snarls as he snatches up sheaves of his notes. The tablets are already clutched protectively to his chest; the notes, flimsy as they are, don’t fare so well as they’re crammed into the same grip. “Nope. Not doing it.”
Gabe’s small, vaguely humanoid body is already linked up to its dock; framed by the huge, arched solar arrays held in abeyance for its orbital activity once they arrive, it looks almost angelic.
“Klimt, as in Gustav Klimt, he was an Austrian painter. That’s the portrait of—” At Dean’s blank look, Sam sighs and shakes his head. “Never mind. What about it, Dean?”
). Dean has no idea how he broke through the brainwashing last time, but he isn’t counting on being lucky enough for that to happen again— chances are, he’ll probably have to teach Cas how to be a person again from the ground up.
“Why put the effort—” Hannah grits out, more skeins and rippling swirls of Grace escaping as she repairs the damage from a third, still-larger impact, “—into a kidnapping that’ll only lure
Dean and Kevin share wide-eyed glances. “Right. Okay. Step one of the plan— don’t get in your way. Got it.” Surveying the library, Dean steps over to the shelves and pulls a few volumes on demons. “Kev, I’m gonna go grab the books we left in the garage. Grab your notes on the demon tablet and go over them for anything to deal with a Knight of Hell. Then, go see if you’ve got anything that’ll nuke an angel from a distance on the angel tablet.” He points at Hannah. “You, I want going through those books. They’re the oldest and weirdest ones, and sometimes those are the best ones. If you finish, check the others on the shelves.” He watches the angel and the prophet get to work, sighs. “They’re gonna try nasty shit to get us to open up, okay? Just… don’t open the door. If anyone’s going out there, it’s me.” Kevin looks like he wants to argue, but Dean just glares him down. “Sit down and read. I won’t have to go out there if we find something quick enough.”
“Uh,” Dean says, lost. This is not how anything involving tentacles or tentacle-adjacent appendages is supposed to go. Not that he’s arguing, but seriously, this ‘polite tentacles’ thing on top of the pain and the demon in his garage and the everyone being missing and the everything else? He’s got no idea what’s going on. None.
because it’s sorta true. When he and Sam really butt heads, Dean’s mouth just… spits shit out without asking his brain, ‘cause Sammy’s always had a knack for breaking down his filters. He hates it, but it’s never been something he’s been able to stop, no matter how hard he tries, and ‘I didn’t mean it that way’ is right up there with ‘I’m not racist, but…’ in the bullshit-o-meter red zone, so it’s not like he has any justifiable way to explain why he’s such a dick.
“Abaddon,” Dean growls in return as a clot of grubs falls away from the demon’s torso with a nauseating splat, exposing black cloth and a familiar print. “Loving the new look. Didn’t know ‘covered in maggots’ was in vogue.”  He readjusts his grip on the Super Soaker but doesn’t move to fire, fully prepared to banter as long as the demon wants if it’ll buy him time. Hannah, her own blade at the ready, seems to be following his cues.
Despite his mounting worry, Dean huffs out a laugh. “He wouldn’t have the first clue-- he’s not really a sports guy. I… maybe he was, uh, further away than I was, and didn’t get hurt so badly.” If only that could be the reality of the situation, Dean thinks unhappily. More than likely, Cas is wherever Metatron or Bartholomew are.
Whoever the two are, someone’s gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like they’d boarded and launched with the RK-NGL.
By the time he’s a meter or so from the hatch and its little window, the light is so bright that he can see his own hands and arms as he gently redirects his careful drift up the goway. Their unnatural gleam is even weirder in the eerie, blue glow.
Dark brown eyes flick upwards for a moment. “Sam is waiting for you outside,” says the masked figure, dabbing gently at Dean’s numbed cheek. Dean heaves an internal sigh of relief. “Do you know where you are, Dean?”
It occurs to him at some point that he got hurt somehow, and that Sam may have been present at the same time. “S’my?” he rasps. He doesn’t have the energy to tilt his head to look around. “S’mmy.” He remembers light, and sound, and burning, but he doesn’t remember if Sam was there. He’s gotta keep Sammy safe, or at least make sure that he’s being seen to. “Gotta… fn Sammy.”
Seconds tick into minutes into an hour. The sun seems to rise right out of the highway as the dusty flats slowly give way to dry, scrubby foothills.
Apologies for the very short first chapter. They get longer, I promise (there's a bad joke in there somewhere, I think). At any rate, there will be space and angel trueforms and all that good stuff, so thank you for giving this a chance, and I hope you enjoy!
Eventually, though, humanity had shed its dreams of gleaming, frog-legged saucers, beringed pyramids, and ominous wedges. Leaving the system permanently had become less and less of an option with the way the War Between Worlds had continued to spark bigger and bigger satellite conflicts, and wishful, nostalgic frivolity had quickly been discarded in favour of relentless survivalism.
I wanna give a shout out to AKF and YANA. They literally saved my life on Sept 9, zero hyperbole-- 'I am enough, I am not alone, and I will always keep fighting' got me through the darkest, scariest, most hopeless place I've ever been in. I cannot express how grateful I am for everything they've done.
Tilting his head back, Chuck thinks for a while. “Uhh, it could? I never had many ideas about side-effects of conducting. It, um. It doesn’t exactly happen often, and most of the time it kills the conductor. Since there’s left-behind grace, though, dreams might be pretty normal.” He shrugs, then pats around for something in his pockets. “Here,” he says as he produces a scrap of yellow paper and a pen. He scribbles a number down and hands it to Dean. “My number. Call me in a few days— I’ll go through my old notes and see if I have anything written down that I’ve forgotten about.” Dean tucks it away in his wallet. “Listen, um— would it be okay if I, uh, took a nap? I’m just really wiped, and—”
Hannah nods. “God gave Their Archangels the knowledge to shape the Universe, and the Archangels in turn taught the Seraphim, who helped them craft Heaven. When we, the least of the Malakhim, were born when the Darkness was sealed away, the Seraphim taught us, that we might be armed against it in the event that it finds a way to return.”
. Gasping, he uses his one free arm to drag himself upright. Eyes wide and teeth gritted through the agony and the grating ringing in his ears, he stares over the mattress at the
Sam finishes topping off the Impala’s tank, holsters the nozzle, and pays before cornering Dean by her trunk. “Dude. Did you take something from the hospital? Are you still seeing things?” Dean swats at the hand that comes up to test his forehead and ends up having to duck to avoid it; he keeps forgetting how sturdy Sammy really is.
As he scans the rest of the report, he has to do an actual double-take and scroll back to the top of the inventory section just to make sure he isn’t seeing things.
Hannah’s searching glare is about as close to literal laser death ray eyes as Dean has ever come, but when she can’t even get her Grace to
to dodging the feelings-talk bullet, “but is there anything about, I dunno, the people who built Heaven?”
Caught off guard, Dean could only stare in awe as the imprint on the universe of Cas’ wings arced, coiled, and flickered over his head in a sort of fan-shaped display that was… well, Dean wasn’t sure what it was, but something about it spoke of
. They were supposed to study the universe or something. ’S why they broke the soup in the first place.” Twisting, Dean endures the renewed ache in his back to retrieve a packet of Funyuns. When he opens it, the first one he pulls out is actually two Funyuns all stuck together—
As soon as his heel hits the floor, some sort of sigil flares to life and races right out of his bedroom door.
Dean, recovered from his allergies now that they’ve gotten into the foothills of the Rockies, shrugs and promptly regrets it when his back twinges in protest. It’s nowhere near as bad as it had been, though; he makes a mental note to find and thank whoever it was that invented Tylenol when he’s in Heaven next (because seriously, with his life? He’s going back at some point or another). “Had days like that. Not so much any more, but when me ’n Sammy were younger, man, we’d drive fifteen, twenty hours without stopping for much more than food or a piss.” Not that they really
was not the sort of thing they’d anticipated having to deal with. Add to that the fact that doors are never quite as strong as the walls they’re put into?
The knock at his bedroom door isn’t exactly welcome when he has so much research still to do. He forgets to be annoyed, however, when he looks up and sees Sam’s ‘Found Something Big’ face firmly in place and his laptop under one arm. “Sammy? What’s up?”
Hello, all. Posting this early (well, not technically early, as it *is* Saturday here, but normally I post at noonish rather than midnight...), mostly because chapter eight is fighting me tooth and nail despite being planned out, and I would like a distraction. Please feel welcome to ask any questions in the comments, or even just say hello-- I'd love to make a few friends in the fandom, being somewhat new. :)
peaks had been literally off the fuckin chart; these were just… well, blips. Kinda dinky, actually, like they ran over a messy smudge of blue somewhere along the way.
Big and… and pure, I think, and really really blue.” He watches Sam continue to type with a furrowed brow. Once he’s pretty sure Sammy’s done with his line of questioning, he figures it’s okay to ask one of his own. “Dude, what’s this about?”
Adrenaline obliterates pain for an instant; instinctively, Dean lunges away, and rediscovers his bound arm and splinted leg too late to avoid the edge of the bed. He hits the floor and pain explodes fucking
That call had been three days ago; since then, Dean had neither appeared nor called, the high school had been closed due to a chemical fire in the science wing, and someone had just reported that a ‘barking bird-dinosaur-man’ had attacked their ‘Maltie-poo’ (Castiel was still at a total loss as to what the latter creature might be) in a park not far from the next dump site on the rotation Sam and Dean had worked out. “Best guess is that they finally did it,” Sam had said, looking grim. “Made their… thing, whatever it was they were working on, and set it loose. I don’t know if Dean’s gone to ground or if he’s hunting it, but… maybe if we find the thing, we’ll find Dean, too.”
Kevin scowls at Dean over a messy fan of crumpled paper. “I’ll open the door if you do.” When both Dean and Hannah shoot him alarmed looks, he rolls his eyes and tosses his head with exasperation. “
on top of the data dump in order to win his position as the Night Watch crew. He even gets his own space within the Watch toroid-- not that it’s much, given that the toroid’s sandwiched between the payload ring and the nosecone, but it’s more than anyone had ever afforded him in the past.
As it has been for the last who knows how many rotations, the Takaoka-REST’s soft blue lighting is the first thing that Dean sees when his wakeup routines reach his sensory cortices.
Castiel’s phone chose that moment to ring. Both he and the creature startled, but when it made no move to attack him or the source of the noise, Castiel slowly, slowly reached into his coat pocket and drew the phone out. “I found it,” he said quietly upon answering, holding the phone in front of his face instead of at his ear just in case the creature took belated issue with the device.
“Sorta does, actually, yeah.” Getting to his back pocket in a car with a sore back is awkward as hell, but his cheap-ass ‘FBI’ cards are there. “I dunno if I’ll remember to call you, dude, so… take this. Call me if you find
. Either you make it where you’re going or you become one with the interstellar medium, and you know who doesn’t give a shit about money or dividends or any a’ that shit? Fucking dust clouds on transit lanes. That’s who.”
“You’re in luck,” says Metatron, and Dean just about jumps out of his own skin. The angel, seated comfortably in an armchair opposite Dean, flips on a lamp and settles with his hands folded over his gut. Sam is on his knees at the angel’s feet, wrists bound by chains etched in Enochian and gagged with the sleeve of his own flannel. His eyes are wide and terrified, fixed on Dean, but it isn’t Sam looking out through them. “Well. Your little friend the Prophet is in luck, at any rate.”
Pointedly, Sam waggles the call button before handing it to Dean. “Listen, dude. It’s almost nine, so I’m gonna go get dinner and a motel.” He rests a hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezes. “I’m glad you’re all right, jerk.”
Maybe you should look into what he’s scared of before you go laughing it off.” He pulls at his restraints again and hisses when something on his back responds with sharp pain. “Why would you want Kevin dead, anyway?”
Sam had learned to accept a lot of weirdness in his life. Dogs talked, Oz was an actual place, and just three months ago, his brother had spent about half a week in North Shore Chicago as some kind of bird chimera thing, so he’d had plenty of practice. There were, however, some things that
“Uh, normal?” Dean offers, and sits through another round of Concussion Quiz. Except for the headache, he passes with flying colors. “Sorry, dude. Guess it just looks different in this light.” Thinking of the blue eyes he’d seen in the woman’s dress, he’s reminded that Cas still hasn’t been located. “You’re probably working a lot of the accident cases right?” he asks. “My friend, Cas, was there too. Nerdy accountant type, messy dark hair, blue eyes, talks like he gargles gravel?”
Dean lifts a hand, pointing up at the painting on the ceiling. “It’s… it’s weird, okay, but do you see that?”
“I was thinking about what you said earlier,” Sam says, still focused on the laptop screen. “What you described sounded a lot like the way stars form. Exactly like it, in fact.”
, but what if it’s not the only way to read that? You’ve put a, uh, what’s it called. A pause in there. ‘God gave them the ability to shape the Universe—
Sam is permitted into the room after Doctor Bagel determines that Dean is stable enough for visitors. “Jesus, Dean,” he groans, sinking down into the chair that the doctor had just vacated. “What the hell were you doing, man?”
in beating it back. No one’s in the room doing the usual shifts to watch over whoever’s hurt the worst, so either he’s not the one hurt the worst, or… there’s no one who knows the drill left.
back seat back in Omaha, bitch!” Dean snipped. Sam heard cheap blankets and sheets shifting; when he risked lifting his hand, Dean was sitting on the bed wrapped in a bed sheet toga and Cas… Cas was staring at Dean like he’d stared at the burgers at that metal joint in Chicago Dean had dragged them to.
Even if Cas doesn’t remember him, though, he’ll do it. Cas is out there, not dead, and he’s worth the effort.
“And God said, ‘These are the things I give to you that you might shape the Universe, and also a safe Haven from—”
Whatever the case, he’ll take what he can get, even if it means more history talk that just reminds him of Sammy. If he’s lucky, his brain will spam a few memories of Sammy in a dream, and he’ll get to talk with his baby brother for a while. Something’s better than nothing.
Dean shoots a smug look back at Kevin, who scowls. “The Archangels built Heaven? Like Michael, Raphael, Lucifer, and Gabriel? Those Archangels?”
there’s nothing here! No way is Abaddon falling for that demon bomb thing, and Metatron’s… well, he’s no Mike or Lucy, but he’s a sneaky little shit, and he
Dean let out a shameless moan; there were some things he never questioned, and the top-shelf vintage of the ‘about to get savagely fucked by an Angel of the Lord’ voice was at the very, very top of that list.
Sam just laughs as he guides the Impala back onto the highway. “I was gonna work with the ACLU after law school, jerk. I know.” Once he has Baby up to cruising speed, he relaxes. “So what about these… hot soup people?”
in the creche chamber and is impossible to circumvent. The ‘tampered creche’ trope is an old favourite in crime procedurals, but it’s a hell of a lot easier said than done-- by now, it’s something of a contest between Takaoka and Kryonik’s R&D groups to see whose anti-tamper measures troll would-be vandals harder.
“So, uh… are you gonna explain why you’ve got some kind of… uh, really crappy Harry Potter costume makeup going on? You know the scar was on his forehead, right?”
A long, increasingly awkward lack of talking ensues as the thing’s whine holds steady at ‘I want to tear my ears off’. Eventually, though, the thing seems to finish processing, the noise recedes a little bit, and the human hand returns and finishes drawing on Dean’s chest with the salve.
Dean shrugs. “Doc says a night.” He’s not going to fight the guy on it; he’s got a pounding headache, feels like refried, angry shit, and, if the suspiciously not-painful-enough sensation he’s getting from under the bandages on his hand and arm is any indicator, he isn’t in
. There hadn’t been any real judgement or disappointment in Kevin’s tone, sure, but he also knows it hu—
Once he’s given himself just enough time for a satisfactory sulk, he plugs into the output jack, switches video inputs, and looks over the last month of data from the array. Except for a cluster of blips in the 450 nm range a few days ago, the readouts all look pretty normal-- just the usual bunch of Doppler-shifted noise from stars and regular pings from navigation posts along the RK-NGL’s route. Even the blips aren’t anything huge, really. Dean’s seen others like them, especially on that one supremely fucked-up trip from Landung to Dàodá that, among other things, had involved passing through a (distant) pulsar’s jet range.
Kevin raises an eyebrow at that, too, but it’s got just enough amusement in it that Dean doesn’t feel like a total moron this time. He flips through his angel book, skims the list of names, sticks a finger on a random name, and hopes the angel he’s picked— Hannah, whoever they are— is still around. They stand back when Dean tosses the match to light the holy oil and Kevin finishes the summoning incantation.
For the second time that day, Dean sails through the air and hits the ground hard. Concrete is nowhere near as forgiving as dirt, though, and Dean gasps as something in his left arm crunches unpleasantly. The Super Soaker clatters away in pieces, useless.
, was baffling the authorities. For lack of a better explanation, they were calling the event a gas explosion and the survival rate a miracle. Dean, apparently, had been one of the more severely injured, having suffered burns all the way up his right arm and parts of his face (said facial burns, apparently, were what he had been instructed not to poke at). The rest of the survivors, mostly visitors and Boyle’s employees, had escaped with scrapes, bruises, and a few concussions.
the intangible, invisible sprawl of his left wing. A jingling, ring-shaped thing dropped to the earth and was pushed at Castiel’s face and hand, almost like an offering.
People in a northern Chicago suburb had been disappearing; simultaneously, horrifyingly warped bodies that came up human
, Sammy,” corrects Dean, pushing an imaginary set of glasses up his nose. It gets the laugh he wanted. “Doesn’t really matter, anyway; soup didn’t last very long. The soup people couldn’t see through it, so they broke it.”
Dean closes his eyes and tries to settle into the seat as comfortably as possible with a bad back. “Fuckin’ Metatron,” he groans, and then recounts the whole, ridiculous story, dreams and all, right from busting in on Bartholomew and Metatron messing with Cas’ head to Sam borrowing Gadreel’s powers to whisk him away from the rogue scribe.
“Said he wanted to do a ‘hard reset’ or something,” Dean replies, clenching his jaw. “I think it’s the same thing that Naomi bitch did to him.” He ignores his brother’s concerned look as he fumes. He still gets nauseous thinking about what Naomi did to Cas. Seeing his friend, badass Angel of the Lord, cowering and whimpering in a corner, clutching at his blade like a safety blanket instead of a weapon… it was
A bit too much like it, actually, and after Sam (or had it been Gadreel?) had told him that he’d essentially recounted the history of the Universe in retelling those early dreams, it has Dean wondering if maybe this isn’t something real, too. “Hey, Chuck?”
Work is incredibly busy, but I was able to get this done on time! Huzzah. Hopefully I'll manage that for the next updates, too-- there are lots of departmental meetings and academies and out-of-state congresses and the two publication databases I'm managing and I'm taking on another department's database next week and frankly I'm not sure how I found time to write, never mind sleep. ANYWAY. I really hope this is enjoyable for you, and thanks so much for reading! Please feel welcome to say hi, or ask questions, or point out typos.
“What?!” Sam’s voice squawked over the line, tinny and small. The creature’s head tipped attentively. “You found it?!”
Diversion successfully (and usefully) executed, Dean scoots back and kicks his heels up onto the table. “Yeah, but does it
Chuck glances at Dean in confusion. “Did you, uh. Did you have another dream?” At Dean’s nod, he frowns. “I… you know, it’s not much different than it is now, really. Not counting time, humans only move and process in three dimensions, but Heaven exists in four, so… a lot of what humans see isn’t really the whole picture. It’s mostly the result of their thoughts and memories imprinting on the lower three dimensions of Heaven. It’s, uh, really malleable.” Without needing to be directed, he turns the Subaru off of 281 and down the little country road that leads to the bunker. “So, to answer your question… I guess it didn’t look like much. Light? There’s probably a lot of that; angels are really energetic. Uh. Not hyperactive energetic; like… uh, they run hotter? Physics energetic.” He eyes Dean curiously. “Does that help?”
‘Neurotic’ must be a prerequisite for being a prophet, because Kevin jumps a mile when Dean plunks down across from him with a fresh notebook, a pen, and an armful of books on angel lore. “What the hell, Dean? Warn a guy!”
; furious at Metatron and Bartholomew for being sick enough to do this to their own brother, furious at the other angels for letting that sort of thing happen like it was
I'm going to go get a manicure and go play Magic, because I've decided it's spoil-myself Saturday. Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll run into that navy blue '67 Impala Super Sport 427 with racing stripes that someone around town owns. That or the '66 Chevelle Malibu.
Hey, all. So I'm gonna have to delay posting the chapters after this one-- there's been another post-merger shakeup at my company, and my boss just announced that she's leaving in two weeks for another company. That leaves me in a pretty awkward place with the move to a new, solo apartment looming in June, and with my contract slated to end on the 31st, I'm going to have to give a lot more time to make sure senior leadership don't write me off as disposable now that my boss is gone. Apologies in advance. :(
” Castiel breathed. He knew that jawline, that chin, those cheekbones— had rebuilt them, traced them, worshipped them in quiet moments with hands and lips.
Dean narrows his eyes, thinking hard. He never had been the best in school— why bother, when he was exhausted, stressed, and wouldn’t be there much longer?— but he isn’t stupid, and thanks to Sammy’s occasional demonstrations, he has a decent sense of how to look at something from different angles, especially when its meaning can change if it’s read different. He has the sneaking suspicion that this is one of those times, too, because something here isn’t gelling. “Wait a minute. Read that again. Slowly.”
The scan comes up clean, thank fuck-- he probably dodged some kind of time-calibrated bullet because he’s a paranoid bastard and never goes into standby without cutting his intranet connections to everything, ship included. Still, he reconnects to the intranet using his VPN and firewall protocols anyway. Paranoid bastards keep their heads un-fucked-with.
Some part of him’s shouting that it’s just proof that he’s still real, but he’s long since learned to tune out that kind of wishful thinking. He wonders, too, who the guy is that he keeps seeing. He looks a little like one of the doctors he’d caught a glimpse of during his hospital stay after the accident-- fuck if Dean could remember any of their names, there were like six dozen specialists working on him at any given time, and a lot of his memories from that first year are kind of fuzzy-- but why Dean would be seeing the guy
Dean chucks a balled-up candy wrapper at his brother, winces at the twinge in his shoulder and back the motion causes, and crunches down a handful of Funyuns before Sammy can whack them out of his hands again. “Guesh if yuh geh enough shoup bitsh… uh, get them squashed down into one place, they start fusing into one big soup chunk. Makes a lot of light— enough that it stops the rest of the soup from falling in all the way. It’s… it’s a star, okay?” He flaps a hand in frustration. He’s seeing all this crap, and it’s weird and cool as shit, but how exactly do you explain dark nothingness randomly turning into stars and soup people and what basically amounts to a friendlier version of the Nothing from that trippy-ass movie with the dragon? “Thought you’d like this kinda shit, Sammy. ’S like Harry Potter in space.”
you try that flirty feather shit on me, angel, I swear to God I’ll pluck those stupid—“ The Impala’s throaty purr rumbled out of Cas and Dean turned a shade of red Sam hadn’t seen since that one Rhonda chick like a billion years back. “Cas, Cas, that’s not fuckin fair, dude, you can’t just
There are definitely times when he seriously considers a personality shunt for transits, just for his own sanity, and this is one of them.
Dean wakes in pain— the ache in his shoulder has spread, filling his whole back with a deep throb. He’s tied to a radiator in a small, dark room; the only light he can see is coming in under the door.
some jackass uploaded to the ship’s servers to cover their goons’ tracks, he’s going to hunt the bastard down and murder them himself--
Dean shakes his head. He likes science fiction with aliens and spaceships, but he’s never had the time or money for a class or a textbook on astronomy.
That brings a smile to Chuck’s face that, for some reason, strikes Dean as strangely knowing. “Okay, then,” the ex-prophet chuckles. “I’ll do that.”
Without any solid data indicating anything off, he can only guess that it’s something to do with time-- maybe he’s finally to the point where shit’s evolved enough to do things like dream. Maybe he really is human under all the other crap-- maybe he’s still the same Dean, the same guy like Sammy had always said.
Dean and Kevin share yet another look, this time of alarm. “Okay, Hannah, we’re gonna look into it, y’hear?” Dean reassures her, and means every word. If someone’s killing angels, it means Cas is at risk, and he’s not gonna have that happen on his watch. “Listen, Hannah, this is important— can you tell us who built Heaven? It could help us shake Metatron outta there.”
Castiel had, of course, immediately volunteered to assist in the hunt— though he and Dean were by no means a typical ‘couple’ and frequently worked independently of one another for days or even weeks at a time, Castiel cared deeply about his partner— so Sam had delegated him to search the park where the woman had reported the animal attack. The park, when he had arrived sometime around sundown, had been quiet and mostly empty. A suspiciously pungent, smoke-filled Mercedes-Benz had pulled out of the vacant lot just as he’d backwinged to a landing near a tall, wooden sign, and he’d only encountered one jogger on the gravel loop surrounding a small, verdant wetland. For the jogger’s safety, he’d waited until the woman had departed to begin his sweep of the wetland.
Doctor Bagel nods on autopilot. “That’s… not right?” He ghosts fingertips just over Dean’s skin— except for the blistered spots, the touch only feels like poking at a limb that’s fallen asleep. “The blistering's just... gone?" Perplexed, the doctor looks Dean's arm over very carefully, gently feeling at the markings, the peeling spots, and the blisters with gloved fingers. He seems just as confused by Dean's lack of reaction as he does by what he's seeing. "These weren’t visible when you first came in.” Visibly flummoxed but resigned to the results of his examination, he carefully begins the process of re-applying dressings to Dean’s arm. “I'm dressing these anyway. Yep. I'm wrapping them, because it's better to be safe.” He shakes his head. “These have been the weirdest cases of my career. Nearly a dozen people caught at the epicenter of a gas explosion, only one person in the ICU and only briefly, and now this?”
When he’s pretty sure he won’t pass out if he tries to sit up, he very carefully rolls onto his left side and then heaves himself upright. Hands and feet respond like they should; plenty feels like shit, but nothing feels broken, thank fuck. Brushing sand and dirt out of his hair, he gets a good look at patchy sagebrush and reddish-yellow earth, all gently lit by sodium-yellow light. Turning gingerly— his back is apparently not okay with any sort of twisting, either— he lets out a sigh of relief. There’s a gas station not two hundred feet away.
Thanks so much for reading-- if you feel like it, please feel welcome to comment! I love hearing from readers. Y'all make my day!
“Uh,” Dean says, because how the hell does he explain this? ‘Oh yeah, Sam’s been possessed by an angel and said angel was assigned to kill you, but turns out the angel’s terrified of some ancient angel myth that I’ve gotten tangled up in, so that’s been called off, but now the angel and Sam are out there somewhere doing God knows what’?
,” he growls, but it’s plainly an endearment. “You better come down and tell me it’s safe to come out
“Glad to be all right, bitch,” Dean responds easily. “I’ll be better, though, when we find Cas and gank Megatron and his patsy.”
He rolls his eyes at Hannah’s incredulous, luminous glare. “Listen. It’s either brace that door until you’re outta juice and we both get slaughtered, or step back and put that energy toward holding them off until I can get help down here.” Loops and prominences of energy ripple over and through and around her body in an even, rolling boil now;
It takes Dean’s brain a little while to fully process that statement, and then he’s just confused. “Thought it was jus’ a… a rezzi-whatsit?”
The hand, halfway to Dean’s chest to continue its drawing, stops; the thing’s core, on the other hand, goes kind of wild, and the hum it makes gets uncomfortably loud and shrill. Panic, Dean thinks— that looks like panic. “What do you see right now, Dean Winchester?”
Cas lies bound to a chair straight out of dental hell, metal hardware gleaming in a sick halo around his head, and streaks of blood flow sluggishly from the places where honest-to-fuckin-God
He remembers the old ones, and the demon that stands atop the sundered garage doors, perfect chin raised as the rest of its body roils with billions of maggots and weeps foul ichor, is impossible to mistake for anything but.
Reassured by the steady, reliable marker of his brother’s long sleep, Dean pushes off from the gangway. “Yeah, yeah. Catch you on the next shift, bitch.”
because he was a fuck-up and a useless friend, and now Cas was hurt because Dean was too busy kissing up to some dick angel who might not even be living up to his promise to heal Sam. If he'd never asked Cas to leave, this never would have happened.
“He’s not a clone of Michael, so he couldn’t, uh, move through you perfectly? You… uh, you weren’t a perfect conductor for him, so he hit resistance, which caused heating and then burns. They’ve healed fast because of… um, I guess you could call it residual charge?”
“They were all dead, but… but it sounded like Heaven, and then the Gates, and…?” The angel seats herself inside the ring and wraps her arms around her knees. “Oh Father,” she gasps, and hides her face in her arms and knees.
Dean shakes his head. “Yeah, but not right away. Took a long time for things to make clouds and fall together.”
Chuck nods. “Um. Yeah. You’re a vessel, so you’re a conductor for angels that resonate at certain wavelengths, Michael’s in particular. Thing is, every angel resonates a little differently. This… I think this was Castiel, because Bartholomew and Michael’s resonances aren’t anything alike. He, uh. He would have just incinerated you. Castiel and Michael, though— they’re a lot alike. Harmonic, I guess.”
Dean sinks into the pillows and gets as comfortable as he can. Before he lets himself drift, though, he takes a deep breath. “Hope you got your ears on, Castiel. I dunno where you are, buddy, but me and Sammy are gonna find you, and I'm gonna find a way so we can all go home, okay? I was wrong to kick you out, man, you’ve done too much. Just… hang in there.
Dean looks up and, sure enough, there’s Chuck, standing in the candy section with a packet of carnival peanuts in one hand and a sixer of El Sol in the other.
Through swimming vision, Dean sees Abaddon turn and make its way toward the inner garage door; heaving himself to his feet, he lurches after it with a roar. Wriggling white bodies fly out in a spray as Dean’s blade slides uselessly through the squirming mass.
Dean almost never knows the date unless it’s relevant to a hunt; he does, however, think he remembers the day. “Saturday. I was… I…” He was hunting, he remembers that much, but what had he…?
At least, it’s familiar on most trips. Something’s a little off as Dean makes his way noseward-- there’s a glow coming from behind the hatch into the nosecone and the forward array banks. It’s pretty blue, but the area around it doesn’t register as temperature-hot, thank fuck. Still, Dean’s whole frame prickles with high alert. There shouldn’t be light from that part of the ship. End of.
Several tiers down and way too much time later, Dean comes to ROSS, AZAZEL. He opens his ‘erroneous’ inventory record on his own desktop, then opens Gabe’s ‘correct’ inventory in the communal chat.
, a secret, small part of him thinks, even if he’s probably fucked Cas up somehow just by contact). Weirder still— intentionally or not, Cas has left behind enough Grace that it’s strong enough to heal the damage he’d done. “So why’s my back’s killing me, if it’s all healed? Why’ve I been having weird dreams and seeing things?” he asks. “Would the leftover stuff do that?”
Bowing his head, Dean stares down at the table of contents of the book in front of him and doesn’t see a word of it. He knows it’s irrational to feel so fuckin… he’s not
Dean and Sam share a knowing look over the doctor’s head as he bends to begin unwrapping Dean’s arm. Neither of them are strangers to caring for burns, though they don’t tend to suffer those quite as often as gashes or broken bones. “Better pay attention, then, Sammy,” Dean teases. Sam rolls his eyes.
After a few minutes of fiddling with the standby jacks and wrestling with the power line (someday he’s gonna get around to reprogramming so he’ll have that piece of shit power port somewhere
A voice speaks to him, but the words remain a smear of noise. The flopping limb is gathered up and tucked back where it came from.
Chuck yips; the car swerves wildly into the other lane before he can get it under control. “You scared the shit out of me!” he gasps, white-knuckling the steering wheel.
Between the nurse returning every two hours and the creepy eyes thing (even the TV isn’t safe any more), Dean doesn’t sleep easily that night. When Sam finally returns at around nine, Dean is exhausted, spooked, and desperately wishing for a bottle of Jack. “Thank fuck. Okay, first— any word from Cas? Two— tell me you’ve got an EMF meter, because I swear to Bonham that there’s something in this room.”
one of his own group and then turned the pieces into… well, littler versions of the dead guy, which is
Okay. Weirdly exciting bird noise was one fucking thing, but the Impala was entirely another, and Dean would deny to his dying day the noise of helpless arousal that escaped him. Bolting past Cas into the bunker, he half flailed, half flapped, half flopped down the flight of stairs and into the library, hoping to get to his room because he was a
Some of the outer spaghetti is still hovering in little curlicues, but a lot of it has drawn back into the main noodle-blob. It looks startled. Startled pasta. “You should not be awake yet,” it says. Dean realizes that the ringing in his ears isn’t from an injury— it’s a constant, pitchy
“Kevin,” Dean interrupts, because he’s pretty sure he’s worn exactly that kind of concerned, intent expression before running off to do something
Still, that bright place toward the end of the dream had been… maybe not the ‘I’ve-been-there’ kind of familiar, but definitely the ‘I’ve-been-somewhere-like-this’ kind. Heaven had been a lot more understandable— hallways, fancy lights, gardens, memories, and all that— but something about that white place had seemed really, really similar, kinda like the motels Dean stays at. The decor and shit changes, yeah, but the grime on the keys, the mildew, and the questionable stains never do. The white place had been blank and fake, just like Heaven.
Hello again. It's been a strange two weeks at work, but the confusion and technology failures have worked out well, at least with regards to this story and a Sherlockian article I've been working on getting into shape for publication.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. The rosiness to his skin is totally gone— the marks, still crimson, stand out as starkly as a fresh tattoo. The only evidence that there had been blistering at any point is a few patches of light peeling at the intersections of the branching marks. “Those are lookin’ a lot better than they were yesterday.” More and more healed, marked skin is revealed as he steadily unwraps the rest of the bandaging. He flexes his hand experimentally and feels… nothing. Moving his shoulder makes his back hurt again, but his arm seems to be perfectly fine. “The fuck?”
. Thanks to you, Bart— now there’s another sorry excuse for a useful angel— flipped the wrong switch and got blown to smithereens for his trouble, everyone’s favourite trench-coat-wearing angel vanished, and now I’m left without any help
Dean groans. He requests Gabe’s shift report, navigates to it when all he gets is a link, and scowls when, sure enough, there’s evidence of short-circuits in the array banks he’d just checked two shifts ago. There hadn’t been any sign of wear or tear then, but then again, little shit like this pops up all the time during transit. High-γ travel is part and parcel of modern life, sure, but it isn’t perfect-- Dean would be out a Sammy-supporting job otherwise.
Dean knows better than to question when Sammy busts out Attorney Mode over something. “Uh… hot. Really, really fuckin hot, and thick— like, solid-thick.”
That draws a huff of breath from Sam. “It’s nothing like that, but yeah, I like it. It’s… interesting, actually.” There’s that thoughtful face again, and Dean has a strong suspicion that Sam’s gonna go back to the bunker and geek out on space stuff just so he can tell Dean all the stuff he got wrong. “You’ll, uh, have to tell Castiel all about it if we get him back. I bet he knows how it actually happened.”
The air in the garage twists again, and a new light, savagely blue-white, explodes into being. Abaddon wails, its hand and psychic grip falling away, and Dean crumples to the floor. He smiles as familiar booted feet plant themselves in front of his face. “
Gabe’s docked and in full dormancy when Dean drifts in; Benny, on the other hand, is just coming out of standby.
Any and all worries about Ezekiel’s thoughts on running headfirst into an angelic civil war fly out of Dean’s mind when he kicks in Buddy Boyle’s office door.
The glow, he realizes, is nothing more than his handlight-- the one he’d been looking for since the last full check-in he’d done of the ship. “God dammit,” he grumps aloud, and snatches up the device. He glares at the feathery afterimages of the array bank after switching the handlight off. “Gotta get some fuckin’ rest.”
” Metatron kicks Ezekiel again, then very pointedly props his feet up on his back. “I guess there’s something to be said for the whole ‘if you want it done properly, do it yourself’ thing, am I right? Honestly.”
The ground gives a mighty shudder, and then there’s a sudden flurry of frantic motion by Metatron’s feet— Gadreel has a hand free, and he’s pulling at the chains and reaching for Dean, and—
Swinging himself out of the mech toroid hatch toward the nosecone, he puts this latest weirdness on the proverbial back burner so he can get to the repairs that need doing.
I need to avoid hospital scenes. I'm only trained in first aid and CPR, and it shows. Apologies if I've put off anyone in the medical profession.
Still dubious, Kevin takes up the chalk and begins to write on the open lane down the middle of the garage. “I’m gonna laugh when you’re wrong and we end up with an angel in the garage instead,” he says as he writes. “It’s gonna smite that stupid car of yours, and I’m gonna
he prays, and sends the mental image of the car, the road, the speedometer, and the mile marker up ahead.
Kevin rolls his eyes. “You said something shitty,” he cuts in, and while his exasperation is plainly tempered by affection, the statement cuts deeper than either of them expect. Dean’s surprise must read like protest, though, because Kevin lifts a quelling hand. “Listen, I’m sure you had a good point, but this is how it always goes. Just call him up, apologize, and
Dean allows himself a moment to remember how to breathe properly before trying to move, but he only gets as far as rolling to his back before he’s reminded that
It takes Gabe a little longer than usual to answer, like something about Dean’s query has it stumped. <

with cold every time he accidentally bumps into the aluminum plating. He thanks human laziness for the fact that transit security footage is only viewed by robots post-arrival-- cold can’t kill him, sure, but he still makes a very undignified scramble for distance and comfort all the same.
He remembers the old ones; honestly, it’s hard not to after forty years of their undivided attentions. He remembers nightmare-fuel visages, horrorshow mashups of everything disturbing the world had to offer, from gore and filth to wicked edges and gleaming, pitiless steel; he remembers the way there was always just enough vestigial humanity— hands, lips, tits, junk, the shape of the body, the way they moved— that he could never forget that they were not monsters but the end-state of human beings, of

He’s still standing there in front of the Beer Nuts, liberally smeared with red dirt and contemplating buying some Tylenol with the wad of ones in one hand as the other rubs gingerly at his back, when he hears a familiar, reedy voice call his name.
The quickest way to get from point A to point B on the ship, the goway is the cylindrical, two-meter-wide space between the inner surfaces of the toroids and the heavy-duty strutwork of the RK-NGL’s spine. Once upon a time, he would have found it scary as fuck-- it

dreams in so short a time. He wonders what the hell it is that’s going on to trigger two of them so close together-- the hotel pod? Maybe the friendly relationship he’d established with Benny and Gabe in the year prior to departure?
They still hadn’t told Sam what kind of prodding had been involved or how they’d figured out the Grace thing if it’d been too weak to detect, but some instinct had told Sam that he
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Huh.” He can’t help flinching back from the fourth impact, which hits with such force that he can hear the suspensions of the cars in the garage complaining. “So… they’re gonna get through eventually, aren’t they?”
Seated on the bed because the chair at the desk is hell on his back, Dean has to go through some nine or ten of the Men of Letters’ books on angels before he finds anything about those freaky-ass needles, and even then, it’s not giving him any ideas on how being subjected to them again is going to affect Cas’ ability to recover (because he’s out there, probably hurt, but out there,

Better than the ‘courtship dance’, at least. “Don’t blame me when you and David Attenborough here were the ones taking up the room, jerk.” Turning to Castiel (who was still staring), he asked, “You wanna explain the ‘courtship’ thing? I thought we’d… you know, fixed that part.”
They’re in a lot of trouble. “Thought they’d try other shit before this, like hostages or something. What the fuck?”
“Not much choice,” Dean grunts. He twitches a little when the salved fingers make contact with his chest. “So… I’ve been dreaming?”
They run through the usual battery of questions once Dean has a moment to gather his thoughts, and Doctor Bagel’s conversational patter gives Dean a better idea of what went down at Boyle Ministries. Whatever that explosion of light had been, it hadn’t left much more than a twisted wreck of the offices— how anyone had survived, never mind
“It ambushed me,” Castiel replied, and, before Sam could interject with another pointless ‘what?!’, added: “It can see my wings, and it has presented me with the collar and leash from a small dog. I think it’s apologizing.”

Dean wants to make some witty retort, draw out the usual stupid villain chatter more, but some deeper part of his subconscious reacts automatically when there’s a strange shift in the air. Whirling in place, Dean’s raised angel blade crashes against Metatron’s. “What the
Without warning, the doors buckle under a brutal impact, then flare blue-white as Hannah’s Grace blooms out from her vessel, spilling into and against the metal. The dent in the door corrects itself with a shriek, and the light fades. “They are using conventional impacts,” the angel grunts, resetting her feet on the floor.
Dean lifts his head just enough to look up at his baby brother, celestial warrior turned up to eleven with a corona of twisting, spiraling currents and sheets of Grace. Six huge, looping currents roar out of and into his back in flowing wings of flame, spread wide and high, and Dean’s never been so damn proud. “Sammy,” he manages to get out. “Lookin’ good, dude.”
“Have you looked at this guy?” he asks, accusing. “You’re in charge, yeah, but I’m sorry, this whole ‘big bully on the playground’ shtick?

animal on DNA panels had been turning up in swamps and ponds in a suburb just half an hour south. A local hunter, upon stumbling onto one of the corpses, had discovered a hex bag around a protruding maybe-limb and passed the word on to Garth, who had in turn notified Sam and Dean, who were in Gary on a salt-and-burn at the time. Neither of them had known what to make of the not-human things, but hex bags meant witches, so they’d ganked the ghost in Gary, jumped on I-94 just south of Chicago, and arrived in Deerfield an hour or so later.
All told, it’s nearly three days after start-up by the time he gets an all-clear readout on every segment in the forward array and can finally slam that hatch shut behind him.
Still pinned by the cold pressure of Metatron’s blade, the most Dean can do is make an unimpressed face and roll his eyes. “You know, I’m pretty sure that cutting a guy’s essence out of his throat is considered a ‘big disservice’,” he sneers.
. TV’s been doing it all night, too. Blue eyes, everywhere, and it’s seriously starting to freak me out.”
He has to fight down a tightness in his chest after attempting to convey the depth of his relief, and then his eyes are watering or some shit, and he hopes Cas doesn’t think he’s actually all worked up or something, because he’s totally not. Besides, there’s no telling if Cas is safe or not; can’t have him thinking Dean’s… soft or emotional or weak or something, when it’s just dust in the air. Dude’s gotta focus on staying alive, not on Dean’s breathing and eye problems.
“Exactly. Also significant— stars didn’t form immediately after that. For a while, the universe just got bigger and colder. Hydrogen didn’t even form right away, but once it did, clouds of it started collapsing into stars— huge ones, as you said. Astronomers say that they were probably bigger than almost any star in existence today. Dean, the bigger a star is, the hotter it burns, and the hotter it burns—”
the ungrateful little bastard. Go be happy, I said, and he throws it back in my face, like I’ve done him this big disservice!”
Thinking of Cas means thinking of Metatron and Bartholomew getting their dick hands on him, not him going nuclear, and Dean’s going to pluck Megatron and Bartholomew like goddamn Christmas geese for daring to hurt his angel
Metatron looks up at Dean with an expression of melodramatic surprise. “Oh! Did you not know?” He sits forward, feet dropping to the floor, and yanks Ezekiel-in-Sam’s head up by his hair. “Poor little Ezekiel is
The suited fucker carefully adjusting one of the needles in Cas’ head barely spares Dean a glance. “I wouldn’t approach, if I were you,” he says coolly.
“Yeah, cool,” Dean responds, preoccupied. He’d just happened to glance upward and had noticed that the pattern of eyes in the lady’s dress had changed. It’s all black, white, brown and gold, now, which can’t be right— hadn’t it been blue, last night? “Dude. You change that picture or something?”
Dean lifts open hands in surrender. “I’m sorry, okay? It’s just… what did Heaven look like before there were humans?”
Smirking, the angel beckoned with one finger and blazing blue eyes. “Come and get me, then,” he purred.
have been driven into his skull. Blue eyes are open but unseeing as Cas’ lips form a steady, monotone stream of Enochian.
He could feel his own feathers ruffling, his tail fanning, but none of it mattered— Cas was hypnotic, feathers shivering and hips swaying as Plant’s wails became the chorus of ‘Miss You’. He whined when Cas pulled away, fingers trailing all the way to the very tips of his flight feathers.
“Naw, you just wait,” Dean says, finally extricating himself from the last of the underlayer. “I’ll tell you all about it, dude. Give you the grand tour and everything, I promise.” He lays a gentle hand over the thick, chilly window in the berth’s insulated metal shell. “You sleep good, okay? I gotta go check up on the forward arrays, and then it’s my turn for a break; I’ll get back to you when I start my next shift.”
It had to happen eventually-- there are empty berths and passenger weirdnesses on every transit, and this one had seemed a little too peachy to be true. Of course it’s a goddamn academic, too; Dean’s seen more absentee academics on transits than nearly any other demographic. He doesn’t doubt that the poor bastard is probably sitting somewhere on Orla B and staring down at a missed-transit fee. Starlines
, because they obviously have him held somewhere. Probably chained up, because dicks with wings seem to like doing it old-school. They’ve got him chained and warded, and that’s why he’s not responding to Dean’s prayers. Mind set, Dean flexes his hands in anticipation and welcomes the tingling burn that zings up his right arm. “Screw that ‘if’ shit. We’re gonna get him home and safe, Sammy. I don’t care who I have to go through— we’re getting him home.” He aims the thought at Cas, too, wherever he is. He’s not dead, and Dean’s gonna bring him home. That’s all there is to it.
. He’d sworn to himself that he’d never let that happen to Cas again, but here they were, and he couldn’t even manage to keep track of his friend, never mind stop it happening. It made him
It hurts to breathe. “Suh?” Another right-shape, but not the same kind— fewer ways, flatter but not flat. Still important. More important than the hot-coppery-wet that burbles up and makes its escape from his lips, or the way he spills from himself. Maybe it’s the name trying to get out. “Cah. Cas.” Metallic wet drips from his mouth with the escaping right-sound; part of him slips from the not-right-shape’s hold and dangles limply, dripping.
” Dean said, standing from the bed and pulling his sheet-toga tight around himself. He was very intentionally avoiding the area above and around Cas’ shoulders. “
at me every time you want—“ No matter how he tried, Dean’s eyes kept going back to the empty space around Cas’ head and shoulders, tracking an invisible something like a cat watching a toy.
Kevin’s expression goes from ‘resigned to doing things Dean’s way’ to ‘what the fuck are you talking about, Dean’ in about half a second. “Dude, what?” he demands, eyeing Dean askance. “Dean,

know. He’s seen it all— cross-country marathons with him and Sammy in Baby’s backseat, that first shift on Route 66, and even those long, lonely nights with Sammy dozing up front while Dad slept off a bender in the back seat before the next hunt.
Doctor… bagel? Bagel. Doctor Bagel’s hands are gentle but unyielding as he presses Dean back into the bed. “Dean. Dean, I need you to calm down. I don’t know how, Dean, but there weren’t any deaths after the accident— if Cas was there, she’s right here in the hospital and she’s alive, Dean.”
“He,” Dean corrects automatically, and allows himself to be quelled. The flurry of activity has left him tired. “He’s… he’s m’ friend, Doc. You gotta help him.”
Maybe it’s a little unkind for Dean to just chuckle at the poor kid, but he’s a big boy and seriously,
Dean sighs and tips himself back against the chilly, un-cauled surface of Sam’s berth. “This transit sucks, Sammy. I mean, not as bad as that Landung-to-Dàodá clusterfuck, but it’s getting there pretty quickly. Send me some positive lawyer mojo, would you?”
He opens his eyes to warmth and a soft blue something pressing against him. He’s moving, a steady swaying, and there is a foggy smudge of voices. There might be words in there somewhere.
didn’t want to know. At any rate, the feathers and claws and squawking were supposed to be well and truly banished.
Dean doesn’t respond, just raises the Super Soaker to intercept another claw swipe. Abaddon shrieks when its claws split the reservoir tank and splatter holy water everywhere; for a moment, the maggots and tar covering its hand and arm are burned away, exposing damp, sagging grey flesh riddled with pits and open sores. Dean’s able to press the advantage for a moment and even scores a hit on the exposed arm, but a second on-target blow merely sinks sickeningly into a renewed layer of squirming grubs and ooze. Abaddon trades blocks and attacks for only a few seconds more before lashing out with another telekinetic blast, this one double the strength of the last.

“Purified blood’s in the blue curse box by the storeroom door. If that don’t keep him happy, I dunno what will,” Dean says quickly, extricating himself from Kevin’s embrace. “G’wan, kid. Guy’s a slimy jerk, but he’ll be fighting to survive, too, if… well. Make him think you’ll be useful and he’ll keep you with him when he runs away, ‘cause he always does. Now get— I’ve got a garage to shore up.”
Sam pulls out the chair from Dean’s desk and seats himself, opening the laptop. “Describe the soup again,” he says without preamble.
His brother, sprawled out in nothing but his boxers in bed and visibly turned on by the half-naked holy tax accountant scuffing his feet on the carpet and making car noises at the foot of said bed, was absolutely one of those things.
“It’s fucking ridiculous, Sammy,” he growls out almost half a shift later, shortly after reconnecting to the ship’s intranet and submitting his completed inventory. “I mean, what’s the point? It’s a
Blue, he thinks, and then— “Cas. Doc, where’s Cas?” He’s frantic, trying to haul himself out of the bed. Cas needs him. Cas was hurt, there was metal, and that fucker Metatron, and—
Honestly, Dean doesn’t remember exactly why he’d felt the need to track down that Bartholomew guy. He remembers Cas mentioning the dude once or twice, but the whole tracking thing had just been… well, an impulse. “Wanted to follow a lead,” he says, because it’s true, “so I did. I got there, and then… Sammy, it was that Megatron fucker and some other dude, and they had all these… these
The thing’s glow ripples briefly. Dean gets the impression that it’s confused. “I don’t understand,” it says.
With Chuck deep in cross-country headspace, Dean feels secure in clasping his hands together in his lap. ‘
Fat fucking chance Dean’s going to disregard two people on his transit just disappearing from the records, but he acknowledges Gabe’s directive anyway. No point in arguing with the mech about it.
such a deep channelling.” With the completion of whatever she’s painting, the ache in his back recedes further still. “Even with a conduit to your soul, the residual Grace should not be surviving; as such, I am taking measures to ensure you are protected from it until I have a better understanding of what is happening.”
“I undid the physical transformation,” Cas replied, “but removing all of the Grace and reversing some of the psychological changes would have been dangerous.”
Gabe is satisfied with Dean’s scan results, but the mech’s dumbed-down transit AI doesn’t seem to know what to do with the discrepancy. It takes it nearly ten minutes (practically an eternity) to consult with the RK-NGL’s systems and come to an acceptable conclusion. <
The woman— Hannah, Dean remembers now— finishes daubing on a last, complicated sigil. “You fell unconscious,” she says simply, “and while I instructed the prophet in stabilizing you, I added to the protections already present. When they could not overcome the wards, they proceeded to lay siege to this place.” Gazing around the room (and probably the whole bunker, if the glint of light in her pale eyes is any indicator), she nods with satisfaction. The nod is joined by a smile when another resounding bang cracks through the air. “I am impressed by its construction. These ‘Men of Letters’ were very thorough in their work.”
“Went out on the mass drivers today, Sammy,” Dean says as he shucks the skintight underlayer of the exosuit. The magnetized gauntlets, kneepads, and boots of the external components are already neatly tucked away in their cubby by the airlock. “Another eighteen months, another three point five tee. She’s holdin’ up like a champ, though-- these new-fangled cruisers are somethin’ else.”
Dean doesn’t even answer; just slumps back on the bed enough that he can watch the thing without re-crushing his ribs.
Hi, y'all. It's... been a bad year. I'm so, so sorry about the delay. January through August was wall-to-wall merger activity, complications from gallbladder removal, and getting no help in dealing with a really toxic, manipulative, scam artist of a coworker (who actually turned out to be potentially toxic to the whole damn company, but that's another story for another time). Dealing with all that culminated in hospitalization in September for severe anxiety and stage three burnout, and most of the time since then has been recovery. I'm doing a lot better, now, and I'm glad to finally be in a place where I can *create* things again.
“Dean,” it says, fever-bright crimson lips curling into a smile below the bloody-edged void that sits where the upper half of its head should be. “How lovely to see you.”
2018 was a very, very difficult year. Severe illness culminated in a ten-day hospital stay about a year ago and a long recovery thereafter. I'm doing so much better now, though, even when flare-ups happen again, and with that has come the mental space to write, draw, and create again. All my love to Mom, my brother, my beloved friend-family here in town, and my wonderful support friendo, Captain Freckles. Thank you all for helping me find strength, patience, resilience, and so, so much love.
She’d be considered ugly by pre-Diaspora standards, sure, but that’s nothing new for starliners, and she’s one hell of a lot cooler than some of the other bags of bolts Dean’s worked on. Built around tech mecca Orla B, she’s hot off the anvil and bristling with technology so advanced that he’d had to study pre-release schematics for
Sam had barely gotten back from Wichita three months ago when he’d been greeted by Cas and a fully-human Dean. They’d explained that Dean’s transformation had been a success due to the unintentional involvement of a angel’s stolen Grace— whose, Cas hadn’t been sure— and that the remnants of that Grace, though too weak for Cas to pick up on easily, had been just strong enough to be the ‘glue’ holding the transformation in place. According to Cas, it had taken only a few minutes of prodding before things simply ‘unravelled’ and Dean returned to his proper form.
Dean tried to make his confusion known while Cas helped him out of the Impala’s back seat, but the angel seemed oblivious. “I will search the library for relevant material once Dean is… settled,” Cas informed Sam. “Good luck in Wichita.”
Inventory, as usual, is about as exciting as watching steel oxidize, at least until he makes it to the first of the three berths Gabe had indicated as empty. Like he had been before, NOVAK, JAMES seems to be missing without any particularly suspicious indicators-- caul and seals are intact, biomonitor records show that the creche never registered any cargo mass, and the T-curve is consistent with an empty creche. He double and triple-checks everything, just to be totally sure, but there’s really nothing to find, so he shrugs and moves along to the next creche.
Sam doesn’t turn his gaze to Dean, but one of those coils of light reaches out, warmth shooting through Dean’s ribs and arm in a wave of relief. He sags, practically melting into the floor. “
“This is exactly like I pictured it,” Chuck says, leaning close to look at Dean’s cheek when that bandage comes away, too. “Exactly. You said you were touching the metal of the needle when the explosion happened, right?” At Dean’s nod, he continues. “Yeah, wow. This is

It takes some time— Kevin is just as jittery as Dean around the flames and the garage’s ancient fire extinguisher refuses to work, so the prophet ends up resorting to throwing an old bag of concrete mix over the flaming oil. They manage to get the shocky angel up to the library, where they install her on one of the comfier chairs and wrap a blanket around her shaking shoulders. She calms after a while, and lifts her head to regard Dean and Kevin with damp eyes. “It was a trap,” she says. The first hint of anger begins to kindle in her eyes. “Someone led us there to be slaughtered.”
