Thank you so, so much to youngdarling for looking this over and helping me make it better!  You freaking rule!!

It smells of you in here.  I like it.
John’s knees nearly buckle, and he has to catch himself with a hand on the worktop. He lets out a shaky breath. “Won’t be long.”  Channeling a bravery he doesn’t quite feel, he turns where he stands, facing Sherlock, who does not step back. They are almost touching. Sherlock’s eyes flicker over his face, penetrating, and John feels dissected and reassembled, undone and
When he opens his eyes again, it is to the sounds and smells of John making breakfast in the kitchen. Sherlock has to know. So he goes to where John is to ask him, “Why though? Why is that the best scene?”
to focus on other than the shambles that make up his life.
John’s smile quirks, chin lifting at Lestrade’s team coming round the corner, just now catching them up.  He smoothly stows his gun behind him before they arrive, shifting then just so his head blocks the sun.  It momentarily gives him the appearance of being lit from behind, a golden halo.  The breeze that cools their faces carries the scent of John’s aftershave and fresh sweat with it, and Sherlock breathes it in on instinct, hoarding it at the bottom of his lungs like cigarette smoke.
@anyawen prompted me with “chocolate covered coffee beans,” and so– this is what happened :-)
Buongiorno!
They eat at Angelo’s. It’s nice. Really nice, actually. They each have a glass of wine, the conversation is easy and comfortable, and Sherlock barely even notices when he takes his last bite of manicotti. John looks pleasing in this lighting, all warm lines around his eyes and pink lips and inviting day-old stubble. He supposes he’s been caught staring when John cocks his head a bit. He doesn’t say anything—only smiles at him, perhaps a little shy, perhaps a little knowing. Sherlock feels his face heat, and he knows it is (almost) nothing to do with the wine. He distracts himself by putting some notes on the table and winding his scarf around his neck.
John’s room is less planned because Sherlock wants John to make these decisions for himself, didn’t want to spoil the surprise with questions.  He chose a soft grey paint for the walls, comfortable bed, and a matching dresser and night table set which are handsome without extravagance. Room enough for John to bring his things if he chooses but neutral enough to serve as a generic spare bedroom if...
Sherlock feels himself blink, his face heat. (Is he blushing? Oh
He left.  He
Sherlock blinks three times quickly.  He opens his mouth to speak, but Molly cuts him off with a raised hand.  The cooker beeps to let her know that it’s finished preheating.
Sherlock takes another breath, hitching a bit and stretching to accommodate his new stitches. It’s maybe a full minute of silence and quiet breaths and being close enough to share heat without touching at all, but eventually Sherlock speaks. “It wasn’t a
--End--
“It is yours,” Sherlock says, quiet.
“Fuck.  Sherlock.” John’s leg wraps around Sherlock’s arse, crushing them together.  The pressure is incredible.  “
Okay.  What should I--
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Sherlock.”  His knuckles are bruised, she can tell.  She wants to not want to know why.
wants them to be.
“Fifty,” John says, smiling, and he pulls Sherlock in for another kiss.
There is so much noise.  Too many colours. Nothing takes shape.  His eyes won’t open. His transport lies still.
From one of the darkest, dustiest places in his mind palace, Sherlock recalls the biblical story of Job—a man so faithful, so righteous, God saw fit to allow the loss of everything (wealth, family, home) just to see what would happen. Perhaps John has gone east, west, north, south—just to tell God himself where to go. Sherlock smiles. John Watson
.” Sherlock’s narration is exactly the right tone, almost melodic, and John finds himself drifting a bit, but pleasantly so.
John laughs. “I know what you mean. Last week, Sherlock decided he needed to test blunt-force impact patterns by filling mannequin heads with cherry jelly and whacking them with a cricket bat. Red slime everywhere. Got a massive glob of it in my hair two days later as I was reading the paper—it had fallen from the bloody ceiling.”

John returns to work at the surgery. He goes in for one day, works his shift, and hands in his resignation before he leaves. He cannot yet even playact at professionalism around his wife (his lying wife). He cannot see her face or hear her voice or smell her perfume without his hands shaking. She tries (John. John,

John moves back to Baker Street on a Tuesday morning, early.  He didn’t ask.  He just—showed up.

He has been staying in John’s spare bedroom since a fire at Speedy’s spread quickly to Mrs Hudson’s and his own flat, leaving 221 Baker Street extremely damaged and structurally unsound. The bones are back in place now, and he and Mrs Hudson have been given the all-clear to go in and assess the damage of their things, to decide what is fit to keep and what needs replacing.
: John’s.
Sherlock nods.  “Of course it’s okay.”  Something softens then, tension breaking, and both of them exhale.
John is already pulling items from the fridge: cheddar, pickle, tomato.  Sherlock crosses the space for the breadbox, then retrieves plates and crisps from the cupboards.  He lights his hand at the small of John’s back for a moment as he sets the plates before him, reaching around him to grab the tomato.  He slices it as John begins the rest of the assembly.
John smiles at him in greeting as he unwinds the scarf from his neck, draping his coat over the arm of the sofa.  There are a couple of shopping bags dropped there as well.
, Sherlock? Really?”
are going to take the time out of your busy day of melting eyelids or whatever it is to do this.
After a while, John says, “God, I’m starving. Dinner?”
Grimy and exhausted, he decides a cool shower might help, so he stands and drags himself to the bathroom.  His clothes peel away from his skin like a wetsuit, damp and clinging, dropping inside out to the floor as Sherlock turns only one tap.  Under the spray, he takes his time, savouring the cool against his heated skin: armpits, wrists, groin.  The suds that slide down his body take the tacky layer of salt and sebum down the drain, and for at least a moment, Sherlock feels clean.
He dips down, pushing his tongue slowly between the shell edges, down into the soft cream it holds.  Eyes fixed on John’s, he scoops it up into his mouth, letting his lower lip rest against the hollowed out chocolate before carefully bringing it up to meet his top one.  He guides the chocolate into his mouth with his tongue, rolling it to coat everywhere, rich and sweet.
Sherlock only looks at him. Why is he smiling?
“Thanks,” John says, and he means it. He manages one more sip before he has to set it down, coughing again, his entire body convulsing with it, and he
“Don’t get up. I need the loo anyway.  You don’t have to wait on me, Sherlock. I’m a big boy, and I’ve survived a cold or two before.”
“They’ve just opened a shop that specialises in it two roads up.”
Breath against his breath. Lips against his lips.
Sherlock wakes to soft puffs of breath against the back of his neck, a thigh warm against the back of his own.  He smiles into his pillow.
“I said I’m
“We are going to need a new plan,” Sherlock says, hands resting on John’s shoulders, fingers stroking the bare skin just at his collar.  “Any ideas?”
,” Sherlock says, cracking his cookie and pulling out the paper.
From the corner of his eye, he sees the curtain flutter in the lounge, so hoping to actually catch a bit of breeze, he steps toward it.  Again, it’s marginally better, but the curtains were only teasing really, now remaining stubbornly still in a room that smells equally of humid air and London smog.  Jesus--this heatwave has to end soon.
spilling from John’s lips, the soft tugs as John’s fingers open and close in his hair.
Paris!
“John,” Sherlock says, and really—it’s just a breath. It’s just a breath that puffs against John’s cheeks, warming his neck under his collar. It’s just a breath that makes his palms sweat until he has to open and close his hand to stop it shaking. It’s just a breath, but maybe—maybe it’s
He puts some frozen peas in with the rice and puts a lid on the skillet with the chicken, and he feels Sherlock’s presence come up behind him. He’s standing close, and John wants to lean back, but he doesn’t.
They take the stairs together, John just ahead of him.
I like that.
He wakes to Sherlock’s hand, a solid warmth on his shoulder. He coughs; it’s worse than before. John slowly shifts to sitting, unable to stop a miserable groan as every muscle in his body protests. Sherlock sits beside him, perching stiffly at the sofa’s edge.
today?  He knows, he
“Just be glad I’m not taking photos.”
“Oh, you know what I mean,” Sherlock says, waving his fork dismissively. He swallows his bite and goes very still.
“I know,” Sherlock says. He breathes against John’s ear. They sway for a bit longer before Sherlock adds, “I have a plan.”
Sherlock is out when he returns that evening. John rings to order a pizza for delivery and pours himself a generous whiskey. He waits until he’s paid for his pizza before pouring another. Sherlock comes in just as he’s fitting the stopper back in the top of the bottle. Sherlock looks at him, eyes doing that thing where they move too quickly to track, and John knows that the entire story of his day is written all over every single thing about him. He’s always so laid-bare when it comes to Sherlock. The whiskey makes it easier not to mind.
When John returns up his body, it is by running his cheek, his lips, his chin, from Sherlock’s testicles all the way up to his jaw, taking his time along the way to nuzzle lightly against his length, lips placing a soft kiss against his frenulum before following his midline to dip into and nibble around his navel, and up and up just like that, lips and tongue everywhere, all the way up his chest until Sherlock is whimpering and John’s penis is sliding against his own.
Later, in the kitchen, the sheets tumble in the washer while Sherlock lays fish fingers on a baking tray.  John changes a newly-roused Rosie before bringing her down for tea. They talk about the case and the idiocy of the new forensics intern at the Met and get in each other’s way in all the very best ways as John peels potatoes and Sherlock wipes pink yoghurt from Rosie’s face.  They even take advantage of the long summer evening with an after-dinner walk in the park. By the time Rosie is in bed for the night, John is able to make his own, sheets now soft and pleasantly fragrant from the wash.
want…”
Sherlock is still sat on the steps when he leaves for the pub. “You’re going to catch your death out here, you know,” he says.
“Come now, Watson,” Sherlock says, working at keeping the calm in his voice, picking her up as he stands at the open window.  Her body is hot and clammy against his own.  “You’ll only dehydrate yourself further with all of this,” and he brushes a tear from her cheek with his thumb, cleans the wet around her tiny nose.  She sniffles and takes a large pull from her drink.  “That’s it,” he encourages, wiping his hand against his trouser leg.
“Rosie’s napping,” he says softly.  He meets John halfway and takes one of the bags before turning right back up the stairs.  John follows him up the further flight of stairs to his and Rosie’s floor, easier now that his load is lighter.
The End!
They eat sandwiches on the sofa, chewing quietly, both of them too zapped to even carry a conversation.  They share the welcome breeze of the fan as the evening passes; it stirs the stagnant air enough to breathe a little easier.  Rosie sacks out directly in front of it just after her bath.
hate the suburbs, but he likes John’s off-tune humming as he puts the coffee on, Rosie’s baby nonsense noises, a house full of life from waking to sleeping.  He likes being able to think better, to feel more…
For two hours, Sherlock pretends to look at things under the microscope while he listens for any sign that the rain will pick up. John reads in his armchair.
John knows what he wants.  It’s all right here in front of him.  The real question is if he is ready for the risk.  He meets Sherlock’s eyes and holds.
“I did,” Sherlock says.
been John’s chair for even longer--six years?  Seven? He never did ask how long John stayed at Baker Street in the time he was away.
He takes a deep breath.  “I had to.  Believe me—I would never have done it if it wasn’t important.  I hope you know that.  It was part of a twisted… game--played out by a sick person.”  He pauses.
Sherlock thinks about it. He’s not particularly hungry, but perhaps if he and John go out, the rain will pick up enough to try again. “All right,” Sherlock says.
Also, the prompt got away with me, so this time, it's a
John shakes his head slowly, swigs the last of the drink, and sets it on the table in front of him.  He barely moves as he listens to the rest.  Every word feels like the answer, like taking back his freedom is the simplest thing in the world.  Maybe it is.
for helping me with Fancy Music terms and being just an all-round awesome person.
“Sherlock,” John says, and he doesn’t know what comes next.
“Then, why?  Are you really that cr-“  She shakes her head once, forcing herself to finish the word, "cruel?"
John kisses him then, gloved hands grabbing onto the lapels of his coat, a chaste press of lips that lingers.  John’s nose and lips are chilled, but it takes only a second to feel the warmth below.  John pulls back slowly, to open the door.
thing, I mean.”
The reprieve is short-lived.  She is wailing again in seconds.
“I always meant to say,” Sherlock says again, but his voice sounds like it’s coming from a faulty speaker, interrupted by static. He has to say it.  If he doesn’t say it now--
are too important.”
That, too.
Light catches, frosting the curve of Sherlock’s cupid’s bow, sweet, and John covers it with his mouth.
They take the bus for the fifteen minute journey to John’s neighbourhood. Sherlock teaches Rosie a game where she must memorise the colours of the shirts of the passengers sat behind them. She does well, and John finds that he is wholly engrossed, watching them together. Something in his heart warms even further. It’s been such a good day.
“Still cold, though,” Sherlock replies. He presses in even closer to John. “You’re warm,” and when he shifts forward, brushing the freezing tip of his nose just behind John’s ear, it is John’s turn to shiver. Sherlock presses his face into John’s neck, and John can feel every press of skin—lips, cheek, chin—and it’s
The sun is just done setting when John makes his way back to the lounge with a cup of tea, listening to street noise through the open window, to the clicking of Sherlock’s typing as he writes up some lab results, pausing often to explain their implications on a case they’re working with Lestrade.  John sits, shifting a bit in his new chair, knowing it will take a little time for it to fit him exactly as it’s meant to, but it will. He knows it will.
John’s breath catches, and he manages, “Yeah.”  He clears his throat, not daring to move too much. “Yeah, it’s one of Rosie’s favourites, too.”  Sherlock smells of a perfect summer afternoon—green like The Regent’s Park, sweet like coffee, and a little like sweat—warm, familiar, wonderful.
Sherlock makes a small noise of acknowledgement, meeting John’s eyes, and he feels the press of his own lips against one another.
Mary comes in with the pudding. Sherlock feels himself straighten up, pull his feet in closer to the chair, cross one leg over the other. She hands Sherlock a plate with a generous slice of banoffee pie, sets one for John and one for herself on the coffee table and curls in next to John again. Mary reaches for her plate, sectioning off a large bite and putting it in front of John’s face. It’s
--child underfoot and living in the suburbs.  Well, he
“Well?” John hears Sherlock say from the corridor outside his bedroom door.
There is water in his eyes, causing him to blink. He notices that his own heart rate has risen exponentially, his own breath catching at the back of his throat. “Yes,” he says, stepping back, clearing his throat. “Fine.”
Mike laughs, taking a pull from his lager.
John nods.  “Well deduced,” John says, tipping it all out, pulling bedding from its packaging.  He wants to see if his mind’s eye was working properly in the shop. “What are you, some kind of detective?”
“Hello, Mary,” Sherlock says. She’s got flour under her fingernails and a fleck of sauce on the front of her blouse.
“Ah, John,” Sherlock says, folding an opened book over the arm of his chair.  “Was I expecting you?”
catching bronchitis. I’ll be back in a bit. Maybe you can talk me through it then?”
“Da!”  Rosie greets.  “Da! Da!”
“I won’t,” John says, and he knows how true it is.  He runs his hands along the clammy skin of Sherlock’s back and then his front, pausing at the heartbeat, strong beneath a small patch of rigid scar tissue.  Sherlock shifts up, just a little, to look at him fully.
, of fresh dye, but John knows that will fade quickly now it’s all out in the open.
rising up, billowing plumes that fill his heart, his head, his body.  It’s electric, it’s devastating, it’s
The only thing remotely comforting about walking up to find Sherlock smoking on the front steps when he returns is that, at some point, Sherlock had to have gone inside to get them. He’s got his scarf around his neck, but no coat or gloves. His grey button-down is rolled up to his elbows and is dark with wet from the weather.
The seams of his trousers cut into his skin, fabric pulling tight at his knees when he tries to move, but he doesn’t want to climb the stairs. “I don’t want to climb the stairs,” he mutters, breathless, to the ceiling, as he flops back into the sofa once more.  The movement sloshes about the liquid in his head unpleasantly. He can’t breathe through his nose like this. Is it possible to drown in one’s own snot?  He’s a doctor, he thinks, as he lets his eyes close again.  At one point, he probably knew the answer to that question.
John smiles and thanks him, grateful and exhausted, and Sherlock’s shoulders relax. John tugs at his jumper, pulling it over his head by the back of the collar, letting it fall the ground near his feet. Next, he does his button down and swaps it for the tee shirt. Okay. Halfway there. He stands to undo his trousers but doesn’t get far because he forgot about his boots, and now—he’s stuck. Possibly forever. He’s sweating. He sits back down to gather his energy.
Sherlock laughs at him.
“Cheers, John.”
Bloody perfect.  It sounds so much like Sherlock that he lets out a single bark of humourless laughter.  He can practically hear the lyrics being spoken in Sherlock’s deep baritone rather than Paul Simon’s narrative tenor.  He sips as Simon lays out some very simple options:
“Former gymnast,” Sherlock had said at one point in the investigation, and true enough. Even Sherlock had struggled a bit to vault fences and cars fast enough to keep up, and since John had only just got back in the chasing-dangerous-men-down-alleyways business when Sherlock returned a couple months ago, he was still well out of practise.
His face falls.  Hers does too, somehow.  She knows where this is going.
time.
He busies himself with crafting something different than their typical two fingers.
He rewinds the film in his mind. Back to start.
At the house, Sherlock hangs Rosie’s bag on its hook by the door, and John tells Rosie to play in her bedroom for a minute so he can get dinner on the hob. Sherlock rattles on about the website cases he’s considering taking up next. John interjects from time to time, and in this conversation, things feel so normal, so ten-years-ago
Just inside the door, they remove their coats, and John points first to Sherlock and then in the direction of the kitchen. “You, kitchen. Sit.” He switches on the light and asks, “Where’s the kit?”
…  Why would
Mary shoos them out of the kitchen as she does the clearing up, and Sherlock and John return to their previous spots in the living room. John hands him a scotch, and they drink in relative silence. From the kitchen, there is the distant sound of the tap running, the clink of silverware and plates. But it’s easy to tune that out, to focus on this, the rich flavour of smoke in his mouth (makes him want a cigarette), the relaxed smile on John’s lips, the focus in his eyes (all on Sherlock now), the evenness of their breaths, the way their feet are not touching (but
John sighs, bringing his hands to cover Sherlock’s, prying the blanket from them. Sherlock grunts, but allows it. He undoes Sherlock’s scarf and tosses it to the other end of the sofa. “Can you do your own buttons?” Sherlock tries, but his fingers won’t cooperate with him, stuttering uselessly against the fabric. He growls in frustration.
), a screaming toddler, and the squeal of chairs sliding against tile flooring.
The telly starts up again as he gets his food. He takes a seat next to Sherlock on the sofa. It’s
“John.” It’s barely even a whisper.  Sherlock’s face won’t stop doing that thing, and John’s heart clenches inside his chest.
His mind wanders as he flips through old newspapers and notes that mostly get the bin.  It’s been five years since he’s returned. He still thinks of it as John’s chair. It’s
as he talks through a case, picking through the detritus of his thoughts with John there to conduct the light.  It’s less convenient by several miles (literally), but he is already loath to give it up when Baker Street is ready and he and John shall once again be on opposite ends of the city.
“See you later, Sherlock.”
Sherlock waves his phone in the air, the glowing face still showing the Google search he’d brought up.
“Two weeks,” John replies.
Sherlock smiles, small, trying a bit to soothe the ache he sees there, a reflection of the ache he has lived with for too many years; he knows how it hurts.  “It’s always been true, John,” he says again, this time stepping in to John’s space just a bit.
), so Sherlock complies by rote.  He finds his lightest weight pyjama bottoms in the dresser and puts them on, already hating every place they are in contact with his skin.  He rolls them to his knees.  He cannot abide the thought of a tee shirt
Sherlock sighs again. His head is shaking slowly. “You weren’t. I never wanted…” His words trail away as John’s fingers find more, these ones lower, close to his spine—a series of burns (cigarettes?), five in total, like giant ants in a row. When his fingers are done with them, he uses his thumb. Sherlock’s skin is warm, warmer than it was for the stitches, but maybe that’s because the gloves are gone. There is one raised high near his other shoulder. It’s curved around the top like the link in a chain.
nearby, and Rosie begins to cry.
But Sherlock doesn’t finish his question. John’s mouth is on his. The rain is cold on his face, slipping underneath his collar, soaking his hair, but John’s mouth is
With some effort, John manages to get the door of the flat open and Sherlock on the sofa with a blanket. He finds a towel in the bathroom and some fresh pajamas in Sherlock’s room. In the living room, Sherlock has finally started shivering, hands clutching tightly to the blanket as his entire body convulses as though he’s having a fit.
.  He steps to the mantel, placing the card next to the glass phoenix.  As he does, the light from the kitchen shines through it just so, and for a moment, his thumb is painted in fiery orange light.

Terra Firma
Molly wakes before her alarm and blinks up at the ceiling.  Her eyes hurt.  She rubs at them a bit, presses cool fingertips to the heat of the swollen bags underneath.  Oh, she knows so much better than this.  She should have had more water last night.  Less wine.  She sighs.  The sun isn’t even up yet, but neither her brain nor her bladder care much about that.
Sherlock breathes, tilts his head as he takes a sip from his bottle.
coming to an end. And, he’s hungry. It is lunchtime on a Saturday, and the shop is filled with other customers. When he steps up to it, Sherlock groans at the state of the queue. There are fourteen people before them and only one working till. His stomach growls audibly.
Sherlock shrugs, wiping his fingers on a paper serviette, using it next to swipe at a drop of soy sauce on the table.  “Finish dinner, then perhaps something on the telly.” He screws his face up at

Inhale. Open. John’s head is back on his pillow. Blink.
Now fully aware that Sherlock is awake, John brushes his thumb across Sherlock’s brow, and Sherlock looks up at him, turning his head just a little so that his chin is against John’s chest and he can see him properly.  John finds his eyes, waits a moment, and then brushes his brow again, back and forth over warm skin and soft hair.
On the day Mary Watson dies, John goes missing. He had stood, lost, in shock, among the sea of police and gathering press—unblinking, barely breathing, too far away. Sherlock had reached, stretched out his arm, spread his fingers. But John sniffed, nodded, turned, and walked away. Sherlock let him go.
John doesn’t hesitate.
He can practically hear Mrs Hudson’s coo of delight from across the city.  He rolls his eyes even as he feels the heat of a blush rush into his cheeks.
“John,” Sherlock says, but his voice won’t work right.
It’s dark outside when he wakes.  The lounge is dimly lit with only a couple of lamps. Sherlock is sitting sideways in his chair, facing him with legs dangling over the arm as he reads something on his phone.
“Under the bathroom sink,” Sherlock says, sinking slowly, carefully, into the chair. John leaves him to fetch the kit, turning on lights along the way. He finds the kit easily, noting appreciatively that it rivals his medical one at home.
“I wish you could hear me now,” Sherlock says, and it’s true.  The chance will be gone before he knows it,
“Stilts!” Sherlock says.
Sherlock frowns. “No. All the pieces are there; I just can’t seem to line them up to make any sense.”
-----
“Yeah, I-- Look, we’ll wake her if we keep standing here.  Come on.”
John groans, loud, fists gripping tightly the sheets beside him.  “I fucking
“How much of an imposition would it be if--” He shakes his head.  It feels like the next thing he says should matter, and he doesn’t want to bungle it.  He knows what he wants to do. He forces his head up, back to that blazing face, and says, “If I wash those sheets now, they’ll be ready for tonight.  That okay?”
telling you,” he says, now sounding a bit irritated, a bit more normal. It’s a small comfort. “You called it ‘playing hide-and-seek.’ I wasn’t.” He falls quiet again, and John’s fingers twitch; he wants to touch. He traces the line of a nearly perfect three-inch circle behind Sherlock’s left rib cage (drill bit?). This one is raised and red, shiny smooth at the highest points of the scar. John’s fingers trace the line of it and then the ridge before pressing into the centre, where it is just skin.
“Please.  I need to talk to you about that phone conversation and what I—said.”
Sherlock laughs at them as he opens a Magnum bar and holds it out for John.  He reaches for it, but stills, turning his hand a couple of times, helpless against the dripping mess from Rosie’s lolly.  Laughing lightly at his predicament, he just leans in and
Of course, the nephew isn’t missing at all. Not in the least. Three minutes on his phone’s browser show that he is on a cruise in the Caribbean with his mistress. But John is much more likely to abandon an itinerary of dripping noses and skin conditions if there is a
sentimental.”  John raises his glass.  “Cheers, Sherlock.” His smile could light the room, is as warm as the liquid in his glass.
John presses in, just a bit, butting his shoulder against Sherlock’s arm.  “This is-- this is lovely, Sherlock,” he says, keeping his voice at the quietest whisper he can manage.
“Never leave,” Sherlock says against his sweaty neck.
“Yeah,” John replies, letting his shoulders drop as he sighs.  “Think it must’ve been triggered by the heat. Don’t even remember what it was about now.  Want some water?”
Sherlock doesn’t protest as he lets John manhandle him up to the flat, supporting his cold weight against his side as Sherlock’s frozen feet fail to master the gross motor skills of climbing the stairs. Sherlock’s leg is like a block of ice against his own, even through the thick fabric of his jeans. The arm around his shoulders is a dead weight, and when Sherlock tips his head toward him, an icy trickle of water drips from Sherlock’s fringe down John’s cheek.
At the top of the landing, he sees light switch on, flooding out through his open flat door.  He looks to the carpet, observing, and then moves his feet a bit faster, a bit lighter. John.
Sometimes, he breaks things.  His hands tremor violently around mugs of tea and plates of take away. He sweeps up millions of shards, white and sharp, from the kitchen floor—so much of what once was whole that now isn’t.
“What?” Sherlock replies, blinking back his disbelief, clinging to a strengthening thread of hope.
They return to Baker Street exhausted and filthy.  Sherlock toes off his shoes immediately, wrenching the sewer-damp socks from his feet.  He strips the rest of his muddy clothes in the bedroom, and he hears the hiss of the shower starting in the bathroom.  He’ll give John first go.  As he waits, he is fully aware of how dirty he is.  He considers standing, but his legs don’t want to do that anymore.  So, wearing only his underwear, he carefully places himself on top of the very edge of his duvet, avoiding his pillows and trying his level best not to breathe in too deeply.  He can smell his
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John breathes.  “Thank fu--” His word breaks as he drops his head to Sherlock’s shoulder.  His hair smells
When he opens his eyes again, it is morning. John’s arm is warm around his back, hand pushed up under his tee shirt, flat against the small of his back. Sherlock’s hand is at John’s waist. John is sleeping, thigh against Sherlock’s thigh, breath against Sherlock’s breath. John shifts, the rasp of his chin stubble against the pillow, the brush of his thumb against Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock sweeps his palm, the tips of his fingers, over the jut of John’s hipbone.
Sherlock rattles a glass with ice in.  “Got some already.” John hears the sofa groan as he shifts to standing.
He hopes she understands.  This could all be a terrible idea.
His own voice is strong now as he replies, interrupting.  “You’re lying.  You do know.”  He thinks he might be smiling.
, John has moved to retrieve the sippy cup from the floor.  As Rosie finishes her tea, John asks about the case, and Sherlock and Rosie tell him all about it.
Bees?
it must have been unbearable: empty chairs and empty kitchens and empty bedrooms, and empty, empty, empty.  It’s been Sherlock’s penance for five years. He pays it willingly; he has accepted it. There are times enough when the chair is occupied for at least a little while, and those are the treasured days, aren’t they.
Behind him, though, Sherlock makes a noise, a soft moan that is positively
? No—he doesn’t want Sherlock to stop. Sherlock moves in impossibly closer, nearly onto John’s lap, nuzzling as he moves his face from John’s neck down to his chest, where he inhales deeply. He fits his hands into John’s armpits, which… is weird.

“In the wind, like we planned,” John says.  “Mycroft is tracing her.  She’s been in Morocco since Thursday night.”
“Soon, Rose,” he says.
Is this real, or is it his own deduction?  He can’t tell. He understands it as truth anyway.
John allows his teeth to sink a couple of millimetres into the chocolate before he hits the resistance of the coffee bean, and when he bites down, it is—unexpected: coffee grit and chocolate silk, sweet and bitter and heady.  It shouldn’t be
She laughs and knocks over the whole thing with her foot as she shifts to crawling position.
Sherlock remembers his own hands when he feels John’s slide from his neck around his back, pressing them closer, flinging their towels to the floor, aligning their bodies.  Sherlock mirrors him, arms around his back before trailing his fingers down the line of his spine to the crease of his buttocks.  He presses a bit into the warmth there, at the very base of his spine, and John moans into his mouth as he wraps a leg around Sherlock, pulling their groins together. Sherlock strokes that spot again, needing more pressure from John’s body, needing that sound from John’s mouth, wondering how he has ever lived without hearing it before.
With a kiss, John eases Sherlock’s hand away, lacing their fingers together.
John’s lips are in a tight line. “Intent or no—
so kind... except for the drugs things.  But that’s more general, isn’t it?  That’s not about her--specifically.
In the bedrooms, he packs up everything except for what he and Rosie need to get them through Saturday.  He’d got rid of his and Mary’s shared bedding ages ago when one morning, hungover and sick and angry and grieving, he’d gathered the lot and stuffed it all into a black bin bag.  He’d slept under a too-small blanket on the sofa for half a week while he waited for new things from Amazon.
“Right,” John says. Moving quickly, he clears off the contents of the table, shifting papers, a microscope, a box of slides, and apparently, a container of fingernails, to the worktop and wipes the table with isopropyl alcohol. He lays out the supplies he needs and then crosses to the sink to scrub his hands. He snaps on a pair of gloves and says, “Okay. Let me see.”
John clears his throat. “No—er.” He seems flustered. “No. Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
John has always been particular about him keeping some degree of modesty when in the common areas of the flat (
“It was best that you didn’t know. Hard enough. I’d already caused you enough pain and ruined everything so spectacularly. You were happy—not with me at that minute, certainly, but—happy. And—I’d
Sherlock closes his mouth with an audible clicking of his jaw.
“To make sure you actually do it.” Under his breath he swears, muttering something about “last time.”
“Oh!” Sherlock gasps, breaking the kiss with a wet
On the walk home, it starts raining again, and he feels like he’s soaked though, inside and out. Sherlock quickly faffs off in another direction just as John turns toward the Superdrug. Blinking water from his eyes, John starts to call after him but is thwarted by his damn cough. Whatever. John can’t be bothered. So, he makes his way inside alone, gets enough Lemsip to down a horse, and splurges on the good tissues—the thick ones with the moisture balm in. He gets the double pack, two hundred two-ply white flags of surrender to this damn cold.
Sherlock presses his lips together. “Tired,” he says with more honesty than John was expecting. “But okay.”
John shakes his head against the pillow and drags Sherlock’s face to his.  “No,” he says, breath coming in pants.  “Together, Sherlock,” he says, and he rolls, flipping them, kissing everywhere he can, straddling Sherlock’s hips and pulling at Sherlock’s waistband.  They shuffle his pyjama bottoms down together, and John moves back to get them completely off.
“Mind if I turn on the telly?” he asks.

There is an oft-cited experiment discussed in classrooms and cocktail parties alike, a convenient analogy when one endeavors to make a point about not noticing the obvious until it is inevitable. Simply, if you place a frog on a hot plate, it will jump off immediately, but if you put that frog on a cool plate and turn up the heat slowly,
John finds a kiosk selling ice lollies, and they make their way to a bench that’s shaded well enough to stop comfortably.  John sits, handing Sherlock Magnum bars for them while offering a unicorn-shaped lolly to Rosie, all bright pink and purple and blue.  Her face lights up instantly as she grasps it tightly by the top rather than the handle.  When John tries to correct her grip, the heavy thing wobbles precariously, nearly toppling to the ground, horn first.

,” John says.
At the nursery, he is on the list of approved carers and no longer has to show ID, but he pauses to check in; this sort of thing still feels a bit out of his area.  He exchanges pleasantries with the receptionist as succinctly as he can politely manage. That done, he passes neatly taped-up rows of sugar paper crafts and painted egg crates along a corridor that smells of Elmer’s glue and antibacterial cleaner.
He rolls his eyes again, but his cheeks are still warm.
At the daycare, John arrives just in time to get Rosie from the play park, and once they make it to her classroom for her things, she hands Sherlock a piece of sugar paper with glued-on pasta. “Fantastic work, Watson,” he tells her with a professional nod. She lifts her chubby three-year-old arms for John to pick her up, so he does, shifting her to one side so he can loop the strap of her bag around his other arm. He struggles with it, not quite able to catch it before it falls to his elbow.
Sherlock can relate.  His entire body thrums with discontent.  He is edgy with exhaustion and so
Unbetaed. Sorry about the embarrassing mistakes ;-)
John reaches out again, index finger curved against Sherlock’s lower lip just as it was earlier today, but this time, he does not move it away. He does not move away.
“Mmm,” John hums; he thinks so, too.  To be honest, it all looks even better than he thought it would, like it was made for this space: rustic blue ticking stripes on one side, coordinating tartan on the other.  It smells strongly
“You have no idea,” John replies, lifting back to look him fully in the face.  He settles just to the side so it’s easier for him to reach out and trace Sherlock’s brow with his fingers, then down the slope of his nose, over his cupid’s bow.  Sherlock kisses him there, on the pads of his fingers, chaste, soft.  “How
The rain does not pick up, but the mist and drizzle have slowly darkened John’s hair, created puddles enough to soak the hems of his jeans. Sherlock bites his lip, wondering. If he were to run the trial now, would the results be sound?
John gives it up, pulling his scarf over his mouth as he walks. And it’s started drizzling. Perfect. He walks faster.
John huffs.  It’s laughter.  “Me, too.”  It strikes him—how true this is.  He’d spent far too long running.
the conversation they are having right now, but he does know that it is important, that it might take time to find the words they’re searching for.  He also knows that he cannot leave here in an hour to go back to his nearly empty, awful house for even two more nights.
Apparently he needs more of a distraction than a cup of tea is able to provide, so he slides his phone closer and presses the home button, lighting it up. He doesn’t even know what he wants to do other than ignore the quiet, reset his thoughts, just until he’s tired enough to sleep.  He checks tomorrow’s weather, his email, news app, Twitter.
I’ve been a bit shit to you.
“Anything,” John says, and his face is so open, so lovely, sweat rolling from hairline down his jaw.  “Everything.  I’m yours, Sherlock.”
He lets himself in, but before he can call up, Sherlock meets him on the landing with a finger to his lips.
“Forever.”  It’s a whisper.  Sherlock strokes John’s chin, thumb over his bottom lip, and small lines of worry begin tugging at the edges of his mouth and eyes.  “This isn’t the most ideal space for a three year old,” Sherlock says.
“Nightmare?” Sherlock asks softly, breaking the silence.  He did try to keep his voice quiet, but John startles anyway.
He unfolds it and brings it to Sherlock’s still-dripping hair as he moves next to Sherlock on the sofa, kneeling on the cushion for a little extra height, leaning in close so he can see what he’s doing. Sherlock presses a freezing, vibrating shoulder against John’s belly. John tries to ignore it as he fits his hands around the shape of Sherlock’s skull and moves the towel gently front to back as he dries Sherlock’s fringe and forehead, then crown, then nape, dropping his height as he goes.
“Mm.”  John nods.
—some things are just going to hurt.
“So,” John says. “How are Donna and the kids? Your oldest is what—seven now?”
Sherlock knows he’s asking, that despite the key he still carries, he doesn’t feel like he can simply come in--which of course, he can.
“Fine.” And Sherlock does. He lets the film play out, stays put as John goes up to his room for bed. He does not move from the sofa. Hands steepled at his chin, he finds that he’s still wondering about John, about his fascination with this particular abomination of cinematic romance,
John.
easy. Knife in hand, the man lashed out immediately, nearly catching Lestrade in the face. John had pulled Sherlock back, which gave him just enough time to jump from the window and shimmy down the fire escape. Sherlock sprang after him, leaving John and Lestrade working to simply keep up.
She sits next to John on the sofa, curls her legs under her and presses into his side. John switches his wineglass hand so he can fit an arm around her. His thumb brushes little circles on her shoulder, creasing the fabric, and Sherlock watches as she half-closes her eyes and leans into the touch. When she brings up her hand to wrap around his, her engagement ring catches the lamplight just right, sparkling brightly. Sherlock takes a sip of wine. She begins talking about the wedding—beginning plans, run-downs of possible venues, florists, bakers, caterers, dresses. Sherlock has already begun doing a bit of research on venues himself, so it is easy to go over with her (them) the pros and cons of each space—this one too open, that one too stuffy, this one won’t allow outside catering, that one will provide tables and chairs.
John blows through the opening in the lid of his paper cup before taking a sip. “Too right.”  He sips carefully, not wanting to burn his tongue. He can’t help but hum in satisfaction as he takes his first taste. “Thank you,” John says, raising his cup a little. He means for the tea of course, but he could just as easily mean for the case, for the run, for the
He finds Sherlock’s mouth again, and the tip of John’s tongue makes everything better—wet and slick, easier to slide the sensitive inside bits together.  Sherlock needs to taste him, so he does, tongue sliding against John’s tongue, slow and languid, pulling back to run behind a lip and then back in.  He could drown like this.  He would enjoy it.
the sofa.
He hears the street door downstairs open and shut just as John calls up.
“John!” Sherlock shouts out in a whisper, trying to stay quiet, but “John!
.  Lunch?”
“Hm,” John says.
Sherlock wipes the tips of his fingers on a piece of kitchen roll and lays his forearm on the edge of the table, rolling it so his palm faces up.
“Yeah,” he says, and he orders a lager.  He doesn’t much feel like making idle chitchat with strangers or the bartender, so he takes his pint to a little side bench in the back near a telly showing football highlights.
John closes his eyes and steels himself for what he knows he’s got to do next. He reaches up to feel Sherlock’s pants, hand flat against Sherlock’s left arse cheek. They are, thankfully, dry. John’s thumb, without his permission, rubs against the jutting block of ice that is Sherlock’s hipbone. Sherlock sighs again, mumbles something incoherent as John catches himself. He pulls his hand away quickly, grabbing the pajama bottoms and working Sherlocks’ uncooperative legs into them. When he’s got them worked up to his thighs, Sherlock lifts his hips, and instantly, John feels heat rise in his cheeks. John turns his face sharply to the ceiling. He takes a breath and pulls them the rest of the way up without looking. When he’s done, his hands stubbornly refuse to leave the freezing skin of Sherlock’s waist until he expressly commands them to, busying them by reaching for the towel on the table.
He releases a breath, and he is practically vibrating when he rings the surgery’s office manager to arrange for a week’s holiday.  John knows it will take much longer than that to handle everything with the house completely, but that’s fine.  He can absolutely get what he and Rosie will need at Baker Street sorted by then. He books a man with a van for the first available appointment on Saturday morning.
He feels his body grow as tight as the strings themselves as Sherlock finally lifts it to his chin to play. It’s stilted at the start, and Sherlock isn’t standing exactly upright, but the melody eases both of them to something like normal as it moves along. The tune is soft and slow, and when it’s done, Sherlock sighs and places the instrument in its stand.
Sherlock scoops her up and gives the teacher a perfunctory smile as he gathers her things.
this will kill him.
In the kitchen, he drops the takeaway on the worktop before crossing over to the sink and washing his hands with the meticulous care of a doctor not keen on sharing the germs from the surgery with his daughter.  Once sufficiently scrubbed, he crosses over to drop a kiss onto Rosie’s forehead.
They kiss like they might never leave the sofa again.
Sherlock glares at him. John’s smile comes with a wink as he exits the shop.

?  The voice in his head asks calmly,
“Think those breathing exercises Ella’s got me doing are actually working a bit,” John says conversationally as he perches on his chair.  He doesn’t want to lean his still-sweaty back against the upholstery, so he rests his forearms against his knees, rolling the cool glass against his palms, his wrists.
“I meant it,” John says, face going more serious.  He strokes Sherlock’s face, brushing the fringe off his forehead and scratching lightly at his temples.  “I love you.”
Good.
listening.  They both have, really.  Far too long.
“Are you even listening?”
“Here,” Sherlock says, stepping into John’s space, close enough that the coffee and chocolate on his breath make John’s mouth water.
I’m right here, John.
John’s penis is large and pink and extremely hard.  Sherlock’s mouth waters.
John smiles against Sherlock’s shoulder.

“What, Sherlock?”
Sherlock keeps his voice low as he places the bag in the corner.  “You got new things.”
This one is a double-drabble (100 words for each part), so I didn't think it needed it's own story entry.  It works well as a coda to "The Substance of Things Hoped For," I think.  And going forward, who knows?  Maybe I'll just keep adding things to this??  Daily ficlet-writing by the seat of your pants means you have NO IDEA EVER WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN!  LOL.
While John is off bathing Rosie and getting her tucked in for the night, Sherlock has an idea and sends a text before he can overthink it.  He is likely setting himself up for monumental rejection, but he finds that he just doesn’t care. The plan could work, and even if not as intended, this plan would only rise property value and increase general practicality.

Surprisingly, Sherlock offers to help with packing (likely at Mrs Hudson’s urging), but John declines; this house business feels like something he has to do on his own.  And it is cathartic in a way, all the sorting and binning and packing and cleaning. He occupies himself with going through wardrobes and cupboards and drawers, creating piles: sell-donate-move.  The move pile is always small, easily fitted into a neatly-labeled box or two. He has a couple of Facebook friends over each day to take a chair here, an end table there, and slowly but steadily, those things are gone, leaving more and more blank space, bare walls and empty corners.
He likes coffee.  He likes chocolate.  Right, then. Shrugging, he puts them in the trolley and continues on for the rest of the shopping.

Nearly a week later, Sherlock wakes in the middle of the night to the sound of his text alert. From John. Specific location in Regent’s Park.
“No,” John says, shaking his head.  “That’s not what I mean.” He reaches out to brush his thumb along the back of Sherlock’s wrist.
“Indeed.”

“Where’d you get to?” John asks, deflecting, but genuinely curious all the same. He points to the pizza, and Sherlock nods, so John gets down another plate for him.
“That footwork is abysmal,” Sherlock says, watching a professional dancer do his best to lift his lumbering celebrity partner off the ground.
, of John’s bare skin against his bare skin, hot under his palm.  He did not expect the smooth surface of the scar ridge to fall directly in the centre of his thumb pad, enabling him to feel it in tandem with the rougher skin below.  He cannot contain his gasp.  He cannot pull away.
After “Monkeywrench,” he gets another drink—whiskey this time.   And another one after “Fools Gold.”  He remembers the army, Murray’s kind smile and the exact odour of his farts as the opening riff of “Enter Sandman” begins, and for a while, he is blissfully transported.  The bartender hands him a fresh whiskey just as the last of his selections begins, so he takes it back to the little table that he’s made his own for the evening and continues to let his world and all its problems fade into the buzz and squeal of feedback from Thom Yorke’s guitar.  There is the pause when it’s done as the jukebox calls up the next track—the last one, the one he didn’t actually choose.  His mind is sluggish and muffled, but he finds himself oddly eager to find out what it’s going to be.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says through gritted teeth. He’s hunched over, holding a hand to his abdomen, just above his waist.
“Why?”  She should shut the door.  He’s only going to break her heart—again.  She knows better.
The mattress dips when John slides in next to him, and Sherlock’s heaviness dissipates, becomes lighter. He falls a bit to the centre without warning, his knee against the highest spot on John’s shin. He doesn’t pull away. John’s breath is on his chin, his scent in his nostrils. They blink at each other slowly, John’s hand shoved under the pillow beneath his head. John leans forward, presses his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, and Sherlock’s eyes fall shut just as the breath leaves his lungs.
The world feels oddly quiet when the song is over—just the hushed sounds of the pub around him as the jukebox sluggishly searches for something else to play.  By the time the music starts up again, John’s thoughts have found him.  They are coming on much too fast, chaotic and confusing as they smack clumsily into the patches of cotton wool inside his drink-addled brain.  He really should go.  He needs to get out of here.
John shuts the door softly, pausing for a moment to check the baby monitor on the dresser.  Sherlock watches his back rise and fall with his breath, the small movements of muscle shifting beneath his skin.  When John turns back around, his eyes are dark, but open.
He gives the address.
John’s breath is warm against his jaw.
Once it’s all in place, Sherlock nods.  “It’s a nice choice, John.”
“Jesus! Sherlock!” John breathes, lungs burning, waiting for Lestrade to get there with the cuffs.
He risks a look back at her, smiling benignly, aiming for
“I know we often work late hours, and if you want, if you and Rosie would like to, I mean--there’s room to grow, but I’ll understand if you don’t want to upset--”
, really. He doesn’t get to do this as often as he used to.
“You are my future,” John says against his lips.
“Oh!”  From the next bag, Sherlock pulls out the container of espresso beans and rattles them as he reads the label, turning the container just a bit.  In a flourish, he’s got it on the counter, picking at the taped opening with his thumbnail.  “These

John hums, unable to stop himself from leaning into that press.
He scrubs a hand across his face, dimly aware of the rising sound of the water heating in the kettle.  Okay, yes--he
Sherlock presses his lips together. He knows this. He has, of course, endured much worse than day-old hunger pangs, but it doesn’t stop him being uncomfortable. “I know,” Sherlock says, turning his gaze to a straight-ahead middle distance.
John reads another chapter like this—bodily pressing against his mad flatmate and pretending not to be bothered in the slightest as Sherlock tests varying tactics of reclaiming the sofa to (John is pleased to note)
. . .
“John, I know it’s--”  Sherlock can’t find his words, so he changes tack.  He steps past John, hand hovering just over his shoulder blade, and opens the farther door, the one to (hopefully) John’s room.
Mm.  . . .  That’s a street that goes both ways, I’m afraid.
When John returns, he has two wine glasses in his hands—white, not the red Sherlock brought. “Mary said we should save the red for dinner.”

against that fragrant spot, and it is astounding.  He opens his mouth for even more of it, letting his tongue press, letting the ice melt, to drip along the seam of his lips and John’s skin.  It is headier than chocolate, richer than cream.
“Sherlock,” John says.  His eyes are glistening navy, bright even above circles deeper and darker than Sherlock has ever seen them.  He’s been losing weight.  The lines around his mouth seem deeper.
Data: He cannot stop picturing John’s lips—the way they wrap around the rim of his teacup, the way they part with his laughter, the way they press together in annoyance, the way they go hard and firm when he’s ready to throw a punch or when he’s drawn his gun. The shape they make when he says Sherlock’s name—sometimes soft with affection, other times turned up with a joke, often set firm in annoyance.
“Open your eyes,” the voice says; he can barely hear it.  “Just open your eyes.”

are you doing?” John asks when he approaches, his own teeth chattering from the five minute walk from the pub. He can’t imagine Sherlock is even remotely functional.
.  He snatches his paperback from the table by his chair and takes it back with him to the sofa.  This time, John wraps a hand around each of Sherlock’s bony ankles and lifts his feet, bends his knees, and plants each foot so that all of Sherlock’s stupid, too-long legs are on
“Rosie’s napping, you said.  Is she--?” He points in the direction of the nursery.
anymore, so he tips some ice into his mouth, crushing it to increase its surface area.  And then, he bends down close, inhaling John at his nape, and blows—a cool stream of air, just there, where the sweat has spiked the edges of John’s hairline.  He knows it will feel good; he knows this is not normal.
The quiet surrounds him, skittering beneath his skin, prickling uncomfortably, reminding him too strongly of all his other first nights in empty-now houses.  He taps two fingers against the kitchen worktop and decides on filling the kettle for something to do, distracting himself with a task: best go with decaf this late, one mug from the cupboard, watch the kettle (wait).
Case closed, statements given, John walks half a step behind Sherlock through The Regent’s Park. The companionable silence between them is comfortable and welcome, and John takes a moment to savour what is left of this pretty-damn-near-perfect day. It’s midsummer, and a breeze carrying the scent of cut grass and blooming flowers is just enough to ruffle the fabric of Sherlock’s rolled up sleeves. The sunlight catches at the sparse hairs on his forearms, and John knows that if they stay out too much longer like this, Sherlock is likely to freckle. It won’t be dark for hours yet.
“I know,” John replies.  “It really was.”
Sherlock tastes salt, following the line of John’s collarbone with his tongue, lipping him where it juts.  He presses fingers along John’s ribs, thumb pads into nipples, and he slides, sweeping hands down to John’s waistband and back up with lips now around a hardened nipple.  John groans, pressing into whatever part of Sherlock he can.  Sherlock slides his hand down again, dipping just below the elastic, the texture of coarse hair under his fingers, first against the pads, then back again with knuckles.  He purposefully avoids John’s penis as he traces the elastic again, drawing chemical equations with his tongue over John’s sternum.
“John,” Sherlock says, and it sounds like perhaps it was meant to be a warning, but it’s resigned—desperately sad. “Please. I don’t...” He clears his throat, and it’s emotional, more emotional than John is accustomed to from him.
is a line they have not crossed.
“The stars have spoken,” John says, pounding his fist lightly on the table, face schooled into mock seriousness.  “I can finally get that pony.”
John sniffs at it. He’s dubious, but takes a sip anyway. It’s not what he expected; it’s smooth and rich, like silk, coating the entire inside of his throat. “It’s good,” he says, but his voice is gone even weaker now; patchy and raw. He sips again.
John.
Sherlock’s mouth presses into a line.  “I know that.”
, Sherlock,” he says.  “I’m never going anywhere again if you’ll have me.”
He doesn’t want to die.
“I came back too late, wasn’t fast enough, wasn’t
Five minutes later, he’s inside, and Mike’s already waiting for him at a table. John orders a stout and some dinner at the bar and joins him. Mike raises his glass at him. “No Sherlock?” he asks. He always asks, though Sherlock rarely joins a pub night.
“Not just yet, but I wouldn’t say no to a drink.  We should celebrate properly.”
John smiles as much as he can muster, just one side of his mouth. “Me too,” John says.
He longs to cover John’s hand with his own, but by the time he’s realised he
At the bottom, he lifts a heavy ornament, a polished piece of fire-coloured glass in the shape of a phoenix.  A gift from a client, from that long-ago life. He lets the weight of it settle in his palm, brushes a thumb over the curved edge at the arc of its wing.  It stays. He crosses the room to set it on the mantel, letting his hand run along the back of John’s chair as he recrosses the room, returning again to his task.
John’s hands are nearly at his waist, stroking the skin there, and he realises he’s just touching to touch now. He doesn’t pull back. “Why, then?” John asks. “You said it wasn’t a game.”
of the breaths—maybe it is the very thing filling his lungs, keeping his wasted heart beating, his aging muscles moving—and maybe this is everything—everything it has always been and everything it might become. John forces his eyes to stay open, to stay fixed.
Sherlock takes a breath.  “It was an outlet,” he says.  “A way for me to--stay sane. You couldn’t know, of course, so I sent them to Mycroft.”
“Fine,” Sherlock answers, but his voice is distant. John would ask why he’s sitting out in the cold, but he reckons if Sherlock wanted to be inside, that’s where he would be. He doesn’t follow John inside, so John shrugs his shoulders and shucks his jacket downstairs, pulling shirttails from his trousers as he climbs up to the flat. He heads straight for the bathroom, scrubbing at his face and neck with the water on as hot as he can stand. A shower would be better, but he doesn’t fancy walking to the pub with damp hair; this will have to do. He feels a bit more human as he climbs the further flight of stairs to his bedroom where he changes his shirt and jumper after tossing the dirty ones into the hamper.
that he feels like a walking raw nerve.  Baker Street is an unremitting hot box of sweat and heat, steadily rising, and when Rosie can’t rest, neither he nor John can find any relief either.  He could use a case, a distraction, but while heatwaves like this do correlate with rises in petty crime, the complex criminal tends to opt out.  Anything more interesting than a bar fight or a B&E is simply too much effort for London’s underbelly in this weather.
“It’s always been true,” Sherlock says, taking the card from him.  “It’s
“I don’t need to go to hospital,” Sherlock grinds out. “It’s just a scratch; I’ve had worse. I’ll take care of it at home,” but he’s struggling to stand upright, clutching tightly to his middle.
Sherlock nods, not trusting his voice, fighting the sting behind his own eyes.
Sherlock hands him his pajama bottoms and stands, gathering John’s clothes as he goes.  John puts them on, grabs his pillow and duvet from the far end and then sinks into the sofa properly, finding just the right angle for his head so he can breathe through at least one nostril.
,” and John turns enough to bury his fingers into Sherlock’s damp curls, nails sliding against a sweaty scalp, and he opens his hot mouth against Sherlock’s, chasing the cool tongue, the drip of melting ice they now share.
. The only logical course of action is to perform a trial. Luckily, they live in London and are out in the weather rather a lot.
There is a long pause, and John watches the flashing ellipses as they come and fade with Sherlock's typing-without-sending.  Sherlock starts and stops typing several times. John stretches out his cramped hand, growing a bit nervous as he waits, hoping he hasn't overstepped.
Sherlock turns his face into John’s hand, rasping stubble against his palm before his lips, dry and flat, press against his wrist.  John hums.  Sherlock turns his head back, nuzzling into John’s chest before dragging himself up, aligning their bodies, shifting so his face hovers just above John’s.  They share space and breath for a few heartbeats before Sherlock’s thumb is on John’s temple, fingernails lightly scraping through the short hair at his nape.  John brings a hand to rest against Sherlock’s chest.
“You don’t have allergies,” Sherlock replies, sipping from his own cup with brows raised.
, though is this: the landing will kill him.   He feels the panic creep back in, slithering beneath his skin, skittering in the spaces between muscle and bone.  He is shaking with it.
There is no fumbling or toe-stepping this time, so unlike the first. They do not take formal waltz position. Instead, John laces his fingers behind Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock’s hands rest around his waist.
One of the couples dances a waltz. “No, no, no!” Sherlock shouts at the screen. “Didn’t even master the arm positions!” He takes a large bite of chicken. Around it, he continues his rant. “What sort of choreographer can’t even manage that much? This
). His mind feels as beige as the walls around him. Just then, Mary comes in from the kitchen with her own glass of wine, brushing hair out of her eyes with a sweep of her hand.
“Sherlock,” he says. But, he doesn’t know what the rest of the sentence should be.
“Is everything all right?”
At the end of his street and around the corner is a pub.  His local, though there’s a better one two streets over that he usually goes to.  Inside, it’s dim, the garish glow of fingerprint-smeared fruit and blackjack machines the most lively looking sight by far.  Vinyl signs for Foster’s and Strongbow frame a St George’s Cross above the bar, which he knows from experience will be slightly sticky; the place is fairly repugnant.  But, better than home—or rather,
“Working or couldn’t sleep?” John asks.
John’s eyes open immediately, and Sherlock feels like he’s been caught.  His breathing goes rapid as he fights every instinct he has to flee.  But John smiles—the softest, most open thing—and he rolls back off of his belly, turning to face him.  Then, John reaches for Sherlock’s arm, tugging him in gently, and Sherlock relaxes into it, doesn’t resist, and John doesn’t let go.  As he lies back, Sherlock’s own towel shifts almost completely open as faces John a bit more fully.  He considers righting it, but leaves it.  He honestly has nothing he wants to hide.
Four hours seem like four years. And, they are—years. Two of them are his fault. Two are God’s. That is, if he could find some faith. It would be convenient to assign blame to a faceless deity.
Are you okay?
else.
It is growing dark as they step on from the platform to the train that will take them back to the city. There are two open seats, but the carriage is crowded. They have to sit close enough that their bodies are touching at the thighs. They sit in an easy silence, and then Sherlock’s stomach growls.
“Quite right,” Sherlock agrees.  He makes his way to the kitchen and rummages through a drawer.  He hands John a stack of paper menus. “You pick. Tea?”
Sherlock... isn’t a girl’s name.
And then Sherlock meets his eye, smile on his lips as he licks a wet stripe up John’s entire length.  “A very long time ago,” Sherlock says, nuzzling at the spot where John’s testicles meet his shaft, kissing there, trailing his nose up to the tip.  He wraps his lips around the head, swirls his tongue, pulls off, kisses.  “Not since before I knew you, John.”  He hopes John understands; he wants this with exactly
John breathes.
He closes his eyes and calls up the memory of the film—everything watery, grey, soft. An open mouth, water dripping inside before another mouth covers it. Hands in wet hair, rucking up wet clothing, sliding over wet skin. Objectively, he does not understand how this could be anything other than cold and slippery and uncomfortable.
John presses the button for their stop, and on the short walk to the house, Rosie takes one of each of their hands. Without warning, she holds on tight, tugging before dropping like a weight, and both John and Sherlock catch her before she can fall to the pavement, pulling her safely upwards, and she swings out forward, giggling as her feet kick in the air. Sherlock understands the game immediately—she’s a good teacher, too. This time, John counts off:
John shifts a bit on the bench, clears his throat, and the exhale from his lips is a sultry summer breeze against Sherlock’s jaw.  Sherlock turns his head, chasing it, leaning in just that much closer, and that humid warmth is now as present on his lips as the sweet cream he can taste there even still.  His mouth opens without him telling it to; his eyes fall shut.
It is uncomfortably cold out, and this is not the way to the station, but that’s all right.  It is Saturday, and there is nothing to do but this. As they walk, John’s shoulder brushes his, and they are quiet, a
Next to him, Sherlock inhales, just under his ear. “Smells good,” he says, and his breath warms John’s neck. Sherlock doesn’t move an inch, and John swears his voice goes even deeper. “I can’t wait.”
“What?”
“I’ve got the kettle on for tea as well,” he says, pointing to the kitchen before he goes in.
Sherlock’s mind is so full of questions he doesn’t know how to ask, and this makes finding the answers even more difficult.  It’s all to do with rather a lot of feelings, and so he loses the thread of the questions before he can get past the words like
He presses against the sides of the cut a little to see what he’s dealing with, and then he begins to clean it, fingers gentle, pulling back every time Sherlock sucks air in through his teeth. He doesn’t bother with
Next, trousers. John doesn’t even bother asking as his hands find the hook and zip. He keeps his eyes averted when Sherlock presses his freezing belly into the warmth of John’s knuckles. John fights an unsettling impulse to flatten his palms against Sherlock’s stomach, and instead, clears his throat, maintains a medical, professional façade as he peels this wet fabric away, too. The top isn’t too bad, but the hems are so soaked that he has to get socks off first before the trousers will budge from Sherlock’s ankles.
“Suit yourself,” John says around a mouthful of food.  “It’s pretty good.”
“You’ll need caffeine for when you've retrieved Watson from daycare. It’s almost five.”  Sherlock’s eyes turn down as he focuses on fitting the lid on his cup.
to go with the handsome greys and dark woods in his new bedroom.
“How long?” Sherlock asks.  How long has he been here?
Conclusion: Uncertain.
all of that, muscle and blood, and the heart that makes it all move,
John cuts him off. “This is the best part Sherlock. Shut it.”
“You are married,” Sherlock says after a while, arms still holding steady around John’s waist. The words are not laced with sadness or regret, a mere statement of fact.
Get on the train, Wayne,” John says to himself.  He snorts, managing to bite back the full-throated laugh that springs up at his own stupid joke.
At home, she changes clothes and starts chopping onions and garlic.  Everything good starts that way, right?   Best to keep her hands and mind busy for at least a couple more hours.  She switches on the radio while she’s at it and does her best to sing along.  Avoid thinking about any of it.  Beyoncé lyrics.  She can do Beyoncé lyrics.
The moment stretches, buzzing like whiskey throughout Sherlock’s entire bloodstream, from belly to brain, knocking away his inhibitions, breaking down his walls.  He feels so warm, he could burst. Oh, he is
“Johnston’s back garden path,” Sherlock says, prompting.
Sherlock bother protecting?
“Sorry,” he says, barely registering the little line of disappointment between her brows as he runs a hand roughly over his face.  “Sorry, I—” and he doesn’t even try to make an excuse—just shakes his head and tries not to laugh or shout or break something.  They lost at least four mugs and two plates in his first week back.  This might be progress, but it doesn’t really feel like it.  He is so tired of fighting this all the time.  The air rushes out from his nostrils, and his feet walk him to the door.  He’s on the pavement outside before he’s even got both his arms in his jacket.  He looks up to the window, but Mary’s face isn’t there this time.
After an annoying advert for loo roll, the music starts up, and John takes a step back. He holds out his hand.
How and What Now
John collapses onto his chest, breaths hot and wet against his neck.  Sherlock gasps, getting his breath back as well.  He looks up to John’s perfect face, sweaty and open and plastered with the cheekiest grin he’s ever seen.  He can’t even imagine what his own face must be doing.  He can’t be remotely bothered to figure it out.  He leans forward, and John meets him with a sloppy, open mouthed kiss.  John slides off of him with a quiet groan.  Sherlock kisses him again.
along his entire fucking body.  He groans.
“Good, John,” Sherlock says, genuinely happy for him.  And genuinely happy at the implication of part time work; John still wants to work with him, too.  His hand reaches out to find the top of John’s arm, where he gives it a squeeze.  He doesn’t know why, but this is how it’s becoming now.
“I’m fine,” John says. “I didn’t mean to panic you. Sorry.” His hair is plastered to his forehead, his shirt stuck to his chest, water running over the contours of his face—around his ear, in the lines around his eyes, over the bow of his lip, dripping from the fullest part of the bottom one.
“Stop that,” John says, keeping his voice even.  “Be still,” and without thinking, he fits his hand into Sherlock’s fringe, spanning the length of his forehead to stop him squirming.  Sherlock stops immediately.  Pleased with the new calm, John finds his place on the page again and continues reading.
Better now.  Hm.  Better.  Thanks.
The choir sings next of a guiding star, a light in the darkness; Sherlock steps closer, enough that their arms brush, John’s fingers against his own, solid but muffled by two layers of gloves.  He can’t feel John’s body heat, but that’s all right; he knows where it truly lies--underneath the layers: vest, shirt, jumper, coat, scarf.  John is covered in things designed to keep the human body warm, but Sherlock knows that the genuine source of warmth is
All he sees is colour, a sickening blur of blues and blacks, glowing off and on and off and on, a garish grin, all teeth.  Pinpricks of white, smears of red so bright they could be blood. He can’t stop falling. It’s so loud. He needs quiet to think. He has to get down from here.  He tries opening his eyes again, but the noise grows louder, blaring like an alarm of white static, like a heartbeat that refuses to regulate. Colours swirl. The clock is ticking.  Tic-tock. Tic-tock. Tic. Tic. Tic. Tic.
John hums against Sherlock’s tongue, grasping at fistfuls of the back of his shirt.  He yanks it from his trousers to put his hands on bare skin, just there, warm, warm, molten warm. The softness of the cushion beneath them doesn’t fully muffle the rhythmic creaking from the ageing wood.
“It’s not late, John.  It’s half-eight.  You’re drunk.”
all those things, but (he tells himself), the wine makes it harder to
John’s arm twitches again before his hand comes up. “It’s—” John stops himself and hesitates, hand paused halfway to Sherlock’s face. John seems to have a little think, and then, John’s thumb is swiping just below his lower lip. It is startling—but warm, nice. “You had a bit of crust just there.”
as he presses closer, giving Sherlock some relief by dragging his belly against him as he straddles him fully, and good God, now it is Sherlock’s turn to moan.  John bends to suck on his neck, and Sherlock bares even more of it for him as he lets his hands roam over shoulders and collar bone, through the hair covering his pectoral muscles and pressing into perfect nipples.  John slides their bodies together in a slow rhythm as he traces the shallow spaces between Sherlock’s ribs, dips into his naval, massages into his flanks.
He has no idea which route this is, and he doesn’t care.  He stays until the driver announces the last stop.  And, what do you know—there’s a Tube station
It’s still fairly early, but Rosie is down for the night, Sherlock is now back at Baker Street, and John is here, alone.  There is some comfort knowing that Baker Street is ready and waiting for them whenever they’re ready. Logically, he knows that it’s just a matter of sorting all the moving house mess over here, but who knows how long that will take? The house feels cold, empty and gaping in a way it hasn’t done in ages.
The theoretical is getting him nowhere. He needs the practical. He needs
It happened this time, as it so often seems to, in a moment of utter domesticity.  He’d heard the whistle of the kettle in the kitchen, the clinking of mugs set down on the worktop, the opening and shutting of the fridge.  Mary waddled heavily into the living room, her pregnant belly reaching the area seemingly ages before the rest of her, and placed a steaming mug of tea on the table in front of John.  He looked up at her, and she smiled at him with a pretty little curve of her pink lips, and like the crashing of a tidal wave—he
He collapses an empty box, starting a stack he’ll take to recycling later.  The next box down eventually joins it. And the next. He isn’t an old man, he thinks.  There is absolutely no reason for this much stuff; he can’t possibly have actually created, collected, and then stored all of this.  He boggles at the amount--of odd trinkets, of no-longer-important papers, receipts for cigarettes and old takeaways that got somehow mixed in.  Evidence of the places he went, reminders of places he will never go again, echoes of the young man he was. All of them, all these insignificant, forgotten things, somehow remind him of the steps and decisions that have led him here, to who he is now.
Sherlock’s heart pounds in his chest, and he cannot stop looking at John’s face.
--along with the clinking of ice in his glass.  It clacks against Sherlock’s teeth, crunches under his molars, and then.  Then.
John sighs, pulling the scarf from his own neck. He presses it to Sherlock’s wound and moves Sherlock’s hand, pressing it over top, in a silent instruction for him to hold it in place. Some things never change. He pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “All right. Fine, but—like
.  Sacrifice.  Pain.  Redemption.  Sherlock’s breath is coming with gale force, in and out, a small whimper as his mouth finds John’s shoulder, lips in an open press.
A staccato groan comes from Sherlock’s throat. His lips are nearly blue. John feels something inside his chest twist at the sight. Sherlock may be the world’s biggest moron, but he’s paying for it dearly. He looks absolutely miserable.
Sherlock’s mouth quirks up.  “Come see.”
. This is when there is always tea. There is no tea. He stares at the back of the sofa for five minutes, and still John does not move. He sighs again, turning to see what is so
Sherlock exhales, his trail of mingled smoke and misted breath nearly opaque in the lamplight. “Smoking,” he says. He flicks his ash, and the entire thing breaks from the damp of the paper. Sherlock frowns, nearly a pout. “They’re all wet now.”

Sherlock blinks again but recovers more quickly this time. “Right,” he says. “Right, indeed.”  He leans forward with a jerky, tentative movement that he corrects almost instantly, standing tall and sure, just a bit too much in John’s personal space. It’s enough that John can feel Sherlock’s warmth ghost over his own skin before he pivots them by placing a light hand at the small of Sherlock’s back for barely a beat as he guides them back the way they came.

“I will, John,” Sherlock says, voice like a song, and John drifts, content in the warmth surrounding him, Sherlock’s hands stroking his feet, and the quiet patter of rain against window outside.
. He finishes his glass and lets Mary pour him another. It is easy to stay quiet. He has nothing to say anyway.
He moves as quietly as he can manage on his way downstairs, feet automatically landing on the bits that won’t squeak.
“Why not,” Sherlock says with a sigh, stretching a bit to pop his vertebrae back into their proper places after spending too long stooped over.

In the taxi, John’s knee presses into his, and they ride in easy silence back home.  John’s got a dark patch of sweat along his shirt collar that curves down his chest, the skin above it still gleaming with moisture.  Sherlock wonders what it would feel like against the pad of his thumb, how it would taste.  He allows his eyes to linger, easy now, safe, because John’s eyes are closed against the breeze coming in through the taxi window.
Maybe--something else?
, John.”
“You look ridiculous, you know,” John says, raising an eyebrow.  He makes a general gesture to Sherlock’s face and says, “Toothpaste,” not quite managing to fully stifle the upward quirk of his lips at this (albeit small) mark of progress in the state of Sherlock’s personal hygiene.
will find the cable and ask questions to frustrating sales associates about it if need be. And
“No. He’s working a case that apparently requires him to freeze his bollocks off and frighten the neighbours.”
to leave or kip on the sofa, he decides on sitting instead.  He perches himself on the very edge of the bed, back ramrod straight, still unsure about exactly what is the right thing to do.
“No,” Sherlock says, and he lifts the remote from the table next to John’s chair and carries it over to him.
After the labour of taking more Lemsip and making a cup of tea, John is knackered once again by the time he settles back in his spot on the sofa.  He closes his eyes again, but sleep won’t come.
,” John hisses, bucking, but when he says, “
“We’ll baby proof,” John says, smiling a bit.  “Rosie already loves you, loves it here. We can stay in my old room if you want to take things slowly, or--”
“I told you to bring an umbrella.”
, Sherlock’s got it against his carotid, and it tingles like
“That’s no good at all,” John explains, frowning. “Did they find the most nasally-voiced man in the world on purpose?”
“Is that your peas thing?” Sherlock asks, voice low in his ear. His chin is nearly resting on John’s shoulder, his cheek nearly brushing John’s cheek.
His stomach reels; he can’t shut his eyes against any of it:  the noise, the colour, the never-ending kaleidoscope of falling too fast.  His head sinks deeper into his pillow. It is not a comfort; it feels like a hand clamped tightly round his nostrils, sealing his mouth shut.  It feels like suffocating.
.  John’s hands reach but don’t tug, travelling for miles along the gentle curve of hamstrings, and Sherlock sways down, down, down and
“Hm, no.  Lemonade,” Sherlock says.  Though the breeze through the living room windows is nice, the kitchen is rather too warm for hot drinks at the minute.  John nods.  “I’ll get it,” and he does just that as John takes their plates to the table.
label.  He’d seen them around before but never actually tried them.
John won’t be here for hours.
John huffs, a small sound that could be stifled laughter or a sob—or both.  There is a beat, and then he is looking up again, steadfast and sure into Sherlock’s eyes as he fits his own hand inside, palm-to-palm as warm fingers wrap to cover Sherlock’s first knuckle.  It is only a moment before they both go back to their lunch.  There is nothing to say—no case more important, no trivia, no idle gossip—just the hum of the refrigerator and the sound of the pipes as the heating kicks on.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says. He pops the pill and swallows it down. John watches the line of his throat as he does. He lets his hand light on Sherlock’s shoulder, gives it a little squeeze. Sherlock’s eyes close as he brings his own hand, large and warm, to cover it. John lets the moment linger, brushes his index finger against the skin of Sherlock’s neck as he pulls away.
Then, Sherlock is handing him a mug of something steaming. “Bone broth,” Sherlock explains. “It’s supposed to help.”
Sherlock takes it.
The cold of the tile seeps through his trousers at his backside.  Head down. In. Out.
He goes to the leaves and picks one of them up, pressing it between his thumb and forefinger.  It is still damp, folding in on itself some, but it is not brittle; it is completely intact.  And though he is well aware of the cell structure in a plane tree leaf, nearly ubiquitous in London, he takes it to his microscope anyway.  It is as he expected—cells in neat lines, chloroplasts giving way, changing for the seasons.
and unapologetic.
Their glasses clink together lightly, and they sip.  It is delicious, the perfect balance of sweet and bitter and burn.  Sherlock takes another fortifying sip.
The music is muffled as he passes Mrs Hudson’s door, and he can hear her humming along, the faint clank of crockery as she works.  He braces himself against the cold when he opens the door, and though it’s the work of only a minute or two, getting the boxes and rubbish in their respective bins, it’s long enough that his whole body sighs with relief to be back indoors.  He stomps his feet and allows himself a shudder, like a bird puffing its feathers in the warmth.
“I should go,” Sherlock says, standing.
“I meant it, too,” Sherlock says, bringing his own hand to trace John’s lips and cheek, lighting at his nape.  “And, I will mean it.  Forever.”
Sherlock gasps at the feeling of John’s fingers on him as he rolls the condom down, as he strokes him gently, slicking him with lubricant.
“Sh!”
. You’ll find me when you’re done, yeah?”
Rosie claps when she sees him, reaching up from her place on the play-carpet where she’d been stacking blocks. She can’t say his name yet, but she tries, getting the “Sh” and the “k” in there somewhere.
.   “I can’t do it, John.  I don’t know how.” He takes a shaky breath.  He is higher now than he was before, farther and farther away from where he needs to be.

are you watching?”
It’s Sherlock’s turn to gape, speechless.
John doesn’t even wait for Sherlock to not reply before scooting Sherlock’s feet out of his way on the sofa.  Sherlock, for his part, doesn’t react other than to stay where he was placed.  His bare toes and the balls of his feet press a bit against the outside of John’s thigh once he’s settled in, but John doesn’t much mind.  He simply balances his plate of takeaway on the arm of the sofa and tucks in as he switches on the telly.
“You are gorgeous,” he says (
,” he says.
“Give Watson a kiss from me.”  Sherlock’s lip curls at the corner. Something like fondness softens the lines at his eyes.
They are interrupted by a ding in the kitchen, and Mary jumps up. “Lasagna’s ready.”
Sherlock shifts a bit, and John thinks he might be moving away. “Stay, Sherlock,” he says, stretching his other leg out with his first one, letting both his feet rest in Sherlock’s lap, sinking a little more deeply into the sofa.
“I told you,” John says, thumb brushing at a spot on Sherlock’s arm, just under his shoulder.  “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t ready.”  He leans closer, and Sherlock takes a moment to watch his face slacken, lips parted, eyes on his eyes before fluttering closed, and Sherlock leans in, too, pressing his lips to John’s.
Outside, the drizzle is cool on his face, uncomfortably wet, but it does help clear his mind somewhat. He watches a family walk together through the front door of a house down the street; he can hear their laughter, a dog barking from inside. He folds himself into the back of the taxi and gives his address, and when he shuts the door, the only sound over the engine is the rain beginning in earnest.
Sherlock immediately looks down to the point of contact, and blinks.  “Oh,” he says, a breath. “Right.” He turns his palm up, and John slides his fingers along it, catching where the tips of Sherlock’s fingers curl up.  The violin calluses are a rough contrast to the softer skin lower down, and the base of John’s spine tingles. Sherlock’s eyes are dark when he raises them to John’s.  “I have no idea,” he says, small smile, voice pitched extremely low--but too openly honest to be as suggestive as it feels. Sherlock’s not being coy on purpose.
John smiles then, a soft thing with large eyes and a small huff of breath from his nose.
… Why does she still
“Okay,” John says, and he gives her a tight-lipped smile. “Thank you. HobNobs sound lovely.”
“I wanted to know
The Innocence Mission - “Snow”
John takes Rosie’s little hand, leads her upstairs.  She takes the steps slowly, but when she gets to the landing, Sherlock is waiting for them both.
Sherlock is
“That is
John shrugs back, handing Sherlock his plate, and settles next to him on the sofa.
Sherlock holds one out to him, and John takes it, popping it into his mouth.  Sherlock’s watches him.
In the bathroom, he stuffs his kit with soap, shampoo, and that stuff the stylist talked him into last time he went in.  Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss. Cologne. Anything else? Shaving cream and his razor, extra blades (wouldn’t want to cut himself on a dull one), and he can see it bloom in his vision, a spreading pool of red against a white carpet.
They sway, easy and slow, their feet barely leaving the ground. It’s a quarter-step up and back down, moving while standing still. John’s hands move, fingers skimming the pulse at Sherlock’s neck, down over the soft tee-shirt cotton of his chest and around his back, so he can hold on tighter, pull Sherlock closer.
“You don’t. You’re ill. Shall we go home?”
Sherlock manages a quick, sad smile as he lifts his head again.
“I hope you know what you’re doing,” Sherlock says, eyes fixed to where John is tearing at the foil.
Your hand on my neck.
The programme ends, and Sherlock switches the telly off. John takes his plate to the sink and just leaves it there. He’ll do the washing up later. He returns to the lounge to the sound of music. Not Sherlock’s violin this time, but a lady’s voice singing “Moon River,” coming from the speakers of Sherlock’s laptop. John cocks his head in a silent question.
“Same.”
). Some would say this end was inevitable. But Sherlock knows, that doesn’t really matter—the
“So, what then?” John asks, and he’s trying for stern, but it comes out like a plea.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John says, sucking in air through is teeth.  “You’ve done this before.”
John’s lips bunch up in one corner as his eyebrows raise. “Okay,” he says.
him to understand what has changed.
“Good,” Sherlock replies from his bed.
“Maybe a walk, yeah,” John says around a frustrated sigh.  “Park?”
, Sherlock,” he says, a bone-deep murmur that flows like magma all the way down Sherlock’s spine, lighting fire where it pools just below his belly; his testicles tighten.  John’s forehead presses against his shoulder, breath wet and panting against his ear.  “Come with me,” he rumbles, he breathes, he grunts.  “Sh—  fucking— love— you.
John opens the flat door, steps through, and closes it. He does not turn on the light. He does not speak. He crosses the space to his chair, and he sits.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and takes another bite. When he lowers the pasty back to his lap as he chews, John laughs.
“Hello, Watson.  I see you’re busy building your empire.  Don’t let me stop you.” He bends to run a hand along her hair, tweaking her ear a bit.
“Hm?” Sherlock asks.
He looks contrite, meeting her eyes for a beat before looking to his hands where they are folded on his lap.  “I know.”
John’s hands are on his face as he smiles at Sherlock some more, and Sherlock says, “That was—”
John goes to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water and a pain pill. When he presses both into Sherlock’s hands, he says again, “Really, lovely.”

Sherlock’s tongue is in his mouth, and his knee is pressing against his groin, and John is sweating, bucking. He needs more. He needs to stop. He is going to come in his pants like a teenager. He is too aroused to care.
, crowded to the brim with cranky children and wits-end parents looking to pass the time somewhere cool.  Sherlock himself is enduring
Also, note how TOTALLY AMAZING youngdarling is for cheering me on and looking this over and basically being the best beta that ever betaed :-)))))  Any remaining mistakes are due to my unnecessary continued noodling without her consent ;-)
“A normal case.  I know that I’ve been—  That it’s been— but, yeah.  We can do a real one next time.”  He shifts forward a bit and takes a breath.  “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t ready.”
.  Sherlock observes two large blue Ikea bags over one shoulder and a rolling suitcase with one small box perched on top, leaning precariously against the handle.  It threatens to topple as John stops briefly to say hello to Sherlock in the sitting room before unceremoniously turning to haul his things up the flight of stairs to his bedroom.
It’s busier than usual for a day so cold, but it’s almost Christmas, and tourists and Londoners alike are there to take photos in front of the tree, to listen to the choir of carolers.  John slows and then stops before them, watching. His eyes narrow against the cold, and he sniffs, but his lips move, only just, silently forming the words along with them.
“Yes,” he lies.  “Fine.” He fights the urge to fling the thing out the window.  Instead, he takes a shaky breath. He nods.  He could keep lying, dismiss the whole thing as a mistake, but he doesn’t.
Right.  . . . There were nearly double the amount of murders in the city of London this year than last.  Knife crimes in particular have skyrocketed--
“Ta,” John replies as he shucks his jacket and scarf, hanging them on the peg.
Happy New Year!
“Let me see,” John says, stepping in closer to get a better look. Sherlock rolls his eyes but complies, pulling his shirttails from his trousers and lifting the hem enough for John to see the wound. It’s started drizzling, and John has to blink the wet from his eyes. The cut is maybe three inches wide, not too deep, not bleeding too badly, but, “You need stitches,” he tells Sherlock.
. No further information.
And then John feels the weight of it, too. His heart drops with the memory of his and Sherlock’s dance lesson, of his first dance with Mary at their wedding. John clears his throat, and Sherlock turns to look at him.
John huffs a bit at the bad joke, sipping again from his glass.
There is progress, but it’s slow. The up-the-street walks become to-the-park walks, and those become around-the-park walks. The air grows colder, cleaner. Sherlock is gaining stamina, needs less medication, is able to work small cases. John can tell he’s working on something bigger, but he refuses to comment on any details when John asks.
John clears his throat.  He opens his mouth to speak, but words seem to fail him.  He shakes his head, looking down at his plate as if he is searching for answers in the negative spaces between prawn cocktail-flavoured crisps.  “How?” he asks, voice breaking.  He takes a breath but doesn’t look up.
And, then, the couple is kissing, water soaking them through—making them only more attractive. Every drip, every rivulet, aesthetically designed for optimal romantic allusion. Misty atmosphere, hazy focus, open mouths. And inside, the couple makes love without squelching or slipping or anything that remotely resembles anything factual at all. Sex is boring enough. And though the entertainment industry has made millions on sensationalising it,
.  If I even sort of captured the feeling from this song, then I did what I wanted to.
John takes Sherlock’s hand and leads him back to Baker Street, and when they make it inside the door, John pushes him, wet and squelching against the wall as he closes the door. This kiss is louder, wetter even than the ones outside, and John smells of green things and rain.
John leads them just to the landing, and Sherlock carefully shuts Rosie’s door.  Neither of them move.
“You should,” she says.  She knows all too well the pain of this unrequited mess.  She has known for years who really holds Sherlock’s heart.  It could never be her.
Sherlock hums in agreement as John starts the water, surrendering to his tired body as it sinks into the mattress.  He hasn’t been this comfortable in days.  His eyes drift shut once more to the sounds of the spray against tile and the occasional splash or clunk of a plastic bottle, to the homey scent of John’s soap drifting beneath the door.  He opens them again when the water shuts off, and he turns his damp head to watch that indistinct John shadow put on his bathrobe.
to cover what John is experiencing.
“Why didn’t you send them?  Why did you keep them?”
It’s been a tedious and lengthy process, and much more sentimental an exercise than he had anticipated.  Though he will be glad to have his home back eventually, he does mourn the loss of

Bees.
“John,” Sherlock says.  It sounds like begging.  It sounds like sorry.  It sounds like want.  It sounds like love.
Two days later, they are at Curry’s where John is all but frog-marching Sherlock to the computers section. Sherlock explained that he didn’t

trying to tell you.”  He can’t keep the sorrow out of it.  It creeps into every syllable. He tried every way,
which, John is sure, is the intention.
“Hello there, sweetness!”  He says brightly, and at the same time, within the same motion, he squeezes the top of Sherlock’s arm.
Nearly two days later, John holds his gun steady, aimed directly at the neighbour’s chest as Sherlock gets him zip-tied for Lestrade.  He wipes his cheek against his shoulder, his sweaty fingers slipping a bit against the plastic, but everything is secured in short order.  The chase wasn’t a particularly difficult one (nor was the case for that matter, in the end—a six), but it is warm today, verging on uncomfortable under the midday sun.  Sherlock is itching to be back in the cool dark of Baker Street with a soft breeze and a dry shirt.

“John?” Sherlock asks. “What—”
“Case?” John asks, tapping the bottom one with his toe.
it—that just seems…
, Sherlock,” John breathes, voice raw, shaky.
“It’ll be nearly half an hour before we make it back to the city,” John muses.
John remains quiet.  The moment stretches long enough for Sherlock to register the soft sounds of Mrs Hudson’s music again, an odd sort of whimsey in the midst of all this weight.  Sherlock needs to move his feet; he can no longer bear the heat of John’s gaze without doing--
Even though the blood was well contained, John has to pay the cabbie extra to even take them. He phones Mary on the way, letting her know that he’ll be late getting in. At Baker Street, he has to help Sherlock up the steps to the flat.
And then, John opens his mouth and eats it. He gets a bit of cream on his nose. Mary wipes it off and laughs. They both do. (Hand, arm, shoulder, leg, nape, cheek, knee) Sherlock puts his plate down on the table and sips again from his scotch. This time, it tastes a bit bitter—probably something to do with the sweetness on his tongue from the toffee. He sips again.
John smiles, huffing against the stiff, chemical-smelling bundle of new fabric he’s gathered in his hands.  This is a variant of a conversation they’ve had dozens of times over the past weeks, so often in fact, that it has long since stopped surprising him when Sherlock deigns to shop or cook or eat.  Things this time are definitely not the same as at the Baker Street of the past, but this is where they are now. It’s taken quite a journey to get here, to get home.
lead John back to Baker Street. And again,
“Look at her,” John says, clearing his throat a bit. “She already knows she’s home.”  He wraps a hand lightly around the cot rail, tracing the smooth grain of the wood beneath his fingers.
“John, I--”  Sherlock’s voice is hardly more than breath, lips just under John’s ear, so close, swaying closer; he can almost taste.  Green soap.  Clean sweat.  He must
“Morning,” John says, and he opens his eyes to Sherlock’s, icy-bright and blazing.  “Your nose is cold.”  He shifts, sliding a leg against Sherlock’s until he can wrap his ankle around and pull him closer. The shift creates a tiny gust of chilly room air, quickly swallowed by the heat under their duvet.
The drizzle is barely enough to make John swipe at his face as they leave from informing Mrs Haggard of the disreputable whereabouts of her nephew. Conditions aren’t optimal. Perhaps the rain will pick up on the way home. Sherlock suggests walking.
Greetings from Santa Fe
John does; he really bloody does.  “Forever,” John says. He bucks up his hips just a bit: a reminder, a promise.  “I’m done pretending, and you, Sherlock, you--”
Sherlock wants to taste it.  He wants to dip in to it like cream.  He runs his knuckles along John’s waist again, teasing at the elastic.  “Have you ever?  With a man?”
stretch to find it in this one, but really--now that this thing has a sort-of plot and direction, I'm letting it do what it wants (mostly).
She’s drying her hands on a dishtowel when she hears the doorbell.  Instinctively, she turns down the music in case it’s a neighbor complaining at the noise.  It isn’t.
I know.
“I could,” John says. “I could have allergies.” He almost gets away with the statement before he’s coughing again, wet and barking.
“F-f-feels nic-ce,” he says. “Wa-ar-mm-m.” John can’t help but quirk his lips into a small smile. Sherlock is rarely so vulnerable, so straight-forward about the needs of his body. John rubs his back a bit for some friction, and though he can’t tell any difference in the temperature of Sherlock’s skin under his hand, Sherlock’s eyes close and he lets out a shaky sigh. Something like emotion makes its way into John’s throat; he swallows against it as he reaches for the dry tee-shirt. Sherlock lets him pull it over his head. It reminds him a bit of dressing one of Harry’s babydolls when he was a kid—the way Sherlock’s arms fairly refuse to bend, and he has to stretch the fabric out in odd angles to get them through the sleeves.
By the time they reach John’s house, the snow has accumulated enough to cover everything.  No crack in the pavement, no fallen leaf--nothing but a rising blanket of white.
Sherlock opens the sack to the heavenly smell of beef and onions, potato and grease. He takes a careful bite, as the crumbing thing had apparently not made it through John’s airport scuffle quite as well as John did. Even gone cold and smashed nearly flat, it is delicious. His stomach settles.
Not knowing how much time he’ll have, John rearranges himself.  He shifts more toward the centre, stretching an arm across the back and letting his legs go wide before deciding it would be better to actually fit one of them across the middle cushion and bring the other up underneath him.
Terra firma, indeed.
He clears his throat before speaking.  “This is very nice, Sherlock.” There is definitely something of sadness in the small smile he gives.
... as is my wish for all of you!
John jumps a little at Sherlock’s quiet voice, unexpected, from the direction of the sofa.  He hadn’t noticed him there.
,” it rumbles.
John,” Sherlock says, but his head sinks low, and he braces himself with a hand on the doorjamb. It makes it even easier for John to see—to see what Sherlock had been so nervous about.
At first, they stick to the languid pace they’d been keeping, learning each other, breathing, holding steady.  Sherlock’s hands find the strong muscles of John’s thighs, running over them from knee to buttocks, letting his fingers linger and press into that spot before stroking over their solid length again.  On a downward thrust, John shifts his angle just a bit, and something happens; John is swearing and moaning, going harder and faster, and Sherlock is rocking, thrusting, matching John’s rhythm, grabbing fistfuls of John’s skin, holding on, feeling pleasure spark over every inch of his body, so intense he doesn’t know what to do with it all.  He needs more, and John is there, urging him on with words of love and profanity and those sounds, those
Sherlock’s toes prickle with a heat that travels up the line of his shins, around his thighs, to the very base of his spine, and now his heart is pounding for an entirely different reason. He opens his mouth over John’s upper lip, sucking, licking, stepping in close enough to press their fronts together. His hands are in John’s dripping hair, his thumbs sliding over John’s jaw, slick with rain and rough with stubble and so warm it feels like the very best kind of burning. John kisses him and kisses him again, and Sherlock does the same. It is warm, and it is
Well.  Yes.
“You’ve had a tube down your throat to help you breathe,” John says.  “Don’t try to talk too much.” He places a straw against his lips. “Here.”
The sunlight is molten gold against John’s skin.
Sherlock steps out, back onto the small landing, fingers hovering over the knob of the second door.
Wiping dusty hands on his trousers, Sherlock gathers some of the litter he’s sorted.  He fits the stack of boxes under one arm and does his best with the straining plastic of the bin bags stuffed with far too much paper in.  His middle finger rips a hole, but it catches at the knot at the top, reinforced where it’s gathered together. It should hold. He balances himself thinking he can probably make it in one go without disaster.  Turning to go, he barks his shin against the last two of the boxes on his way out. The top one teeters but he braces it with his knee to stop it falling, and once it’s stilled its wobbling, he carries his load to the stairs and down.
“Oh, getting a bit posh there, are you?”  John is teasing a little, but is mostly amused, lines of delight crinkling at his eyes.
John sees them on a much-picked-over display at Sainsbury’s with what’s left of the other posh holiday sweets, now on offer because Christmas, New Year—it’s all done now.  It’s rather a large cylindrical container of chocolate-covered espresso beans, decorated with a bright red bow and a
Baker Street is ready.
A 221b drabble for the prompt: Fireplace
“Right,” John says. “Go inside, would you? You can carry on like a nutter in there just as well, with the added bonus of
“They’re cute,” John replies with a shrug.  But also, this is the kind of plotless thing he doesn’t have to focus too much on; he doesn’t need to give it his full attention. If he sleeps, he sleeps, and all the better if he does.  Sherlock sits next to him, crisscrossing his legs, sitting as though he’s on the ground. His attention is back on his phone.  John sips from his mug, feeling—not better, but more content anyway.  He sniffs. And coughs. He has to hold a tissue to his nose to catch snot before it drips down his face.
Sherlock turns around then, looming over him, and John looks up with eyes blazing, expecting a challenge, anything but the unfamiliar gaze in front of him—defeated, broken. Without a word, Sherlock steps around him. He turns the kitchen chair to the side and sits down sideways, leaving his back exposed to the room. It’s an invitation.
He switches on a lamp as he wends his way around the waist-high stack of boxes Mrs Hudson sent up from the basement last week.  She’d had the workmen in to fix a broken pipe. They were saved, she’d said, just in the nick of time. The mould would have destroyed their contents if she’d left them, she’d said.
It is wholly unpleasant. While John’s laptop is not in the least a complicated or rare machine—it is the most popular variety, one that this store said both online and over the phone that they did, in fact, carry accessories for—the cable is nowhere in the section with all of the other computer cables. When he finally finds a sales associate to speak with, he knows even less about computers even than Mrs Hudson. They go to the shop computer that calls up the parts inventory to find a serial number. They go back to the display. The associate fumbles through each pegged line of them, dropping several on the floor in the process. The associate calls over another to ask about it. The other associate says that they always have this model, and the computer-to-display process begins afresh.
Sherlock’s left hand finds his, covering it, moving it slowly to cover his heart. Warm skin, soft hair, strong beat under his fingers. “He always meant to burn the heart out of me,” Sherlock says. John feels more than hears the rueful non-chuckle that follows. “He did.”
“Oh,” John says, leaning away.  “Oh, no.  We’ve got a unicorn down over here.”  And sure enough, the half-eaten lolly has slid completely down to the pavement.  Rosie’s world has ended.
John kisses him, wrapping his leg around Sherlock’s and pressing even closer.  They are both tacky with sweat and semen and saliva from their toes to their knees to their bellies.  They will need to clean up soon, but not just yet.  Not yet.  Sherlock settles his head in the crook of John’s neck and shoulder, nuzzles in, and hums.
He pops quietly into the little next-door room to check on Rosie, to make sure he didn’t wake her.  One surprising addition to the renovation of 221 was a reconfiguration of the upstairs space. Sherlock was only halfway through his logical-but-bumbling invitation for them to move in before John agreed.
Sherlock’s stomach growls, but he ignores it as he hails a taxi.
“I’ve got some chicken in. You could come to mine. I’ve got to get this one fed and bathed before she turns into a pumpkin,” he says, poking Rosie in the belly as she squirms and laughs.
He wishes it wasn’t too warm for a fire, which would at the very least, give him something with which to occupy himself.  He checks the baby-proofing on the cupboards, runs his finger along the curved edge of the new table. The entire flat smells new, of fresh paint, clean.
“Why not?” Sherlock says with a shrug.
Sherlock lifts the hem of his shirt again. He’s still got John’s scarf over the wound, and he winces a little when John pulls it away. “The bleeding’s mostly stopped. That’s good,” he says. Sherlock’s hum sounds more like a grunt. “Your shirt,” he says, needing more access to the area than what he’s got.
It isn’t the first time he’s stood before this wardrobe and packed this very bag.  Ages ago.  Yesterday.  His hand trembles, and he opens and closes a fist, willing it calm.  Sherlock is fine. He is
It is, John realises. He turns his wrist to check his watch. He’s got to get Rosie from the daycare in forty minutes. As he places a lid on his own cup, John’s brain starts organising his evening: there’s a load of laundry in the washer at his house that needs hanging before it mildews and chicken that needs cooking before it goes off.
There are scars, dozens of them, marring the pale expanse of Sherlock’s back. John had seen Sherlock’s bare skin—more of it than any flatmate should ever have any right to—in his time living with Sherlock here before, Sherlock who routinely walked around in a sheet or a towel or pajama bottoms or pants or nothing at all. John had seen him grime-and-sweat covered from diving in skips, wet from the shower, gross from days without a bath, but never—not since Afghanistan—had he seen scars like these.
is this so damned difficult?  He opens the door a tiny crack.
“What?” John asks, forcing his attention back to Sherlock. It takes a moment for it to settle; everything feels blurry and dull.  His thoughts are sloshing around inside his throbbing skull. He sniffs.
“I love you, you know,” John says, meeting his eyes, making sure he has every bit of Sherlock’s focus.  “I haven’t actually said.”
“That’s it,” John says with some finality, taking the sodden fag end in Sherlock’s hand and chucking it away. “Up you get. You’re not staying out here any longer.” John nearly recoils from the cold when his hand wraps around Sherlock’s arm to haul him up.
Just--talk to me.
He bungs the Superdrug sack on the coffee table and makes it as far as the sofa. He needs to rest a moment before tackling another flight of stairs. Just for a moment. He just needs to rest his eyes. For just one moment.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, kudosed, commented, reblogged, and encouraged.  Y'all rule!
He lurches upwards to a sharp jolt just left of centre.  Beeping. Everything is loud again. The colours are back, blue and lighter blue and something like water filling his lungs, stopping his breath.  He tries to cough against it and gags, gasps, can’t lift his hands to fight. He’s lost the voice, the fingers, the scent. He must control the panic.  He’s losing him.
