"I love you too."
alive because there's no way that they'd go down without a fight. They'll be back." If only Tony could believe the words he said, because deep down there was a feeling of dread nestled in his stomach. What if they didn't get out alive, what if he never see's Steve again? What if...
"No, Steve," he interrupted, "if I had just woken you up and taken you to S.H.I.E.L.D. with me, you wouldn't have gotten attacked. Maybe those things wouldn't have come here, and you wouldn't have been put in danger. If I had just gone on that mission with you, you would've been safe. It's all my fault."
"I l-love you, too." He whispered, and it made Tony smile in response. "And I believe y-you."
"I would advise you to take it easy, Captain Roger's. You have recently come back from S.H.I.E.L.D. medical despite your injuries, so please, don't overexert yourself." There was a hint of worry in Jarvis's voice that Steve recognized right away. It was also nice to know just how fond the AI was towards him.
"I'm saying maybe they weren't human. What if they were something else disguised as Hydra agents, the weapons were modified, and humans just don't disappear like that." Steve had a really good point.
"You won't hurt me, you promised. Only you know how to touch me the way I like, and I promise I won't get uncomfortable. If I do, I'll be sure to tell you. But I trust you, so please make everything better." Tony nodded his head and got up off the couch, pulling Steve with him. They walked hand in hand towards the elevator, the sound of Tony's racing heart the only sound in his ears. Could Steve hear it too? No, if he did he would probably have said something by now, but he was still nervous about this.
you." He yanked my head to the side and I felt pressure against my neck, and then a sharp pain. I closed my eyes, my breathing started to quicken as the grip in my hair lessened. My body felt on fire, this burning sensation pooling around my neck and crawling towards my stomach. I opened my eyes, and I screamed.
"Please, fuck me, Tony!" He chuckled softly, repositioning himself to get as comfortable as possible before he slowly, ever so agonizing pushed himself inside of Steve. He groaned and bit his lip at how tight he was, how his walls were clenching and constructing his cock as he entered. He stilled as he buried himself all the way in, but Steve already started moving just a few seconds after, signaling that he wanted Tony to move. He obliged, pulling out slowly before pushing in once more, using every bit of self-control to not snap his hips hard against Steve and risk hurting him.
"That is true," she nodded in agreement, "but sometimes I go back there to remember my brother. But that's when those things were there and they found me. They... They knew all about me and what I went through, they knew about my powers and they told me they knew a way to get revenge on you." The tears were back in her eyes, her voice quivering slightly. He didn't know when they stopped walking, but they were in a secluded area of S.H.I.E.L.D., away from prying eyes and ears. "I'm sorry."
He still looked as beautiful as Steve remembered, even if his eyes sported deep dark bags and his hair was disheveled from either staying up too late working in the lab, or the nightmares that plagued him, he didn't know, but it didn't take away from his beauty. The way his pants clung to him, showing off his ass as he closed the door, and the way his shirt was able to show off just the slight amount of muscle in his biceps whenever he crossed his arms, and if he was lucky enough, the shirt would ride up and he could see his perfectly curved waist and the little patch of skin, as well as the boxers he sported. Most of all, it was his eyes that he loved the most; those beautiful, brown eyes of his that used to carry so much fondness, and compassion, replaced with a cold, hard steeled distant look. Tony still looked beautiful to him. Even if he was staring at him like the most disgusting thing he's ever laid eyes upon, Steve could only see his beauty past everything Tony did or didn't show him, because Steve was still in love with Tony.
"I'm not quite to your location yet, do you think you can try to lose it?"
"He must've made the assignment himself, but disguised it as reconnaissance." He bit the tip of his thumb as he watched the way the man moved with a purpose as if he was hiding something. His eyes moved on to the screen in the bottom right, clicking on the top left screen, enhancing the image.
"When you were unconscious for two hours. He appeared distressed and we told him the situation, so now he's with Fury." He nodded his head slowly and sighed. He watched as the clock ticked ever so slowly, taunting him as it meant time he was losing in trying to save Steve.
"Yeah, Nat?"
He couldn't take it anymore, and he turned the dial on the side of the device all the way down, deactivating the collar. He watched as Steve slowly brought his head away from his knees, and Tony's breath got caught in his throat as he heard the audible sniffle of the soldier. He watched as Steve wiped his eyes, bringing his knees closer to his chest, holding them there as his head rested against the white walls of his "room." He found it awkward that he hated watching Steve disassemble right in front of him, showing his vulnerability because he's so used to seeing Steve hold every emotion in with a tight lid. He might have liked seeing the hurt and vulnerability in his eyes as Ross and his guards whisked him away in those special cuffs designed just for him, but now it was unnerving.
"Now I'm being sassed by Captain America, my life is over." He joked, earning himself a hearty laugh from Steve, causing him to smile back. "But you're effectively right, I'm shit at emotional, mushy stuff. Just look at how Pepper and I turned out, she's better off with someone that ain't me because of how unstable I am." He shrugged it off like no big deal, and of course, it really shouldn't have been a big deal, but for Tony it was. Pepper was his everything, and while the torch he once had for her was now nothing more than a dying flame, the memories are still there.
I would never trade what we have for anything in the world. You've stuck by me through thick and thin, and I will always do the same for you. I see a life with you, and I'm willing to go through everything and anything with you. So," he trailed off, opening the box to reveal a black ring with a silver band wrapped around the middle, a white star that was cut down the middle due to the silver band, "will you marry me?"
Tony realizes his mistake- after a small talk from Natasha, of course, and goes to apologize to Steve.
stuttered in his life; and sure he may trip up his words sometimes, but that's not stuttering, that's more along the lines of finding the right words to say while putting pauses in between. Stuttering is more geared towards an irregularity in speech patterns, making it hard to form coherent and clear sentences. And it frightens him, because how can he communicate if he can't speak properly. "H-help me-e."
He stopped eating and moved his eyes away from the plate to see the retreated of the genius, and he knew he should have just let him go, considering he most likely didn't want anything to do with him right now, but he couldn't help the autopilot words that fired out of his mouth like a bullet.
"Hey... Stark." He mentally kicked himself for his voice sounding so far, but can you really blame him? He was caught off guard and seen in one of the most intimate ways that should be saved for someone you're willing to spend the rest of your life with. Not by the owner of the tower they're letting you stay in. It made his blush deepen, and right now he wishes he thought more about walking out of the bathroom completely naked.
"So far, nothing interesting has happened. Just boring reconnaissance. If I'm lucky I'll be back at the tower before you know it." That little sentence made him jump for joy on the inside. On the outside, he was nothing but happy, if the smile that has yet to disappear off of his face was any indication.
"No, I have to get back there and save him. Let go!"
"I understand t-that. I want you to k-know that I absolutely understand that, T-Tony. And I'm s-sorry for doing what I d-did in Siberia. I just didn't want y-you to have to deal with m-more pain and suffering. But, by n-not telling you I was hurting you, a-and I'm sorry."
And he's never been more thankful that Natasha always had his back, and she wasn't afraid to show her true dark side that the Black Widow possessed. It was why he never got on her bad side, because she was trained to kill, and it shows as she pulled the trigger on her gun and shot Ross in the head, the man's body falling limply to the floor, his blood staining the prison floor.
Steve right now. A small chuckle in his ear was all he heard before the soldier retracted his hands, the feeling of pleasure escaping him, and the ghostly trail of Steve's fingers still lingering on his thighs.
"Tony I l-".
"Something on your mind, Stark?" Clint asked.
He knows he did. It's just when he saw Steve talking with Natasha and Barnes, well he might have gotten a little mad at the fact that he's said more to those two than he has to him even when they got here. Even before they got here, he had said that they would do this together, and well it didn't really
Brooklyn, where everything was untouched by time and things weren't so advanced.
He had to save his best friend, even if it meant losing the man he had somehow let into his heart, and allowed himself to love. The man who resembled his father, but was so far advanced in his time and so much more intelligent than Howard ever could be. He risked it all to save Bucky, but he lost Tony in the end. That was his third heartbreak.
it had taken place. I was able to crack it in time and try to warn them, but... Jarvis said an EMP took out their communication devices. So, whatever it is you guys encountered, it's serious and we need to do something."
"Well, I'm h-here n-now." He took a gander at Tony's condition and saw that the fingers that were broken were in splints, most likely after the operation was over. He leaned down and placed soft, gentle kisses on each finger before kissing the back of his hand.
Eventually, the recording is finished and stored on the flash drive, and then next comes the information on Ross, as well as a digital copy of the accords. He'll read everything later, but for now, he has to get out of here. He retrieves the flash drive once everything is fixed, shoving it into his pocket as quickly as he can.
"Jarvis, I want you to get me a holographic recording of this." He said into his phone as he brought it out, bringing it onto the desk in front of him.
"I see the therapy is working now." And he couldn't help but smile at the reassurance in T'Challa's voice, because honestly, the therapy was working, but if it wasn't for Tony being his motivation then he most likely would have given up a while ago.
"I'm fine with that." He smiled and it transferred onto Steve's face. He placed Steve's erection inside of his mouth once more, the blonde pushing his head up and down again, only this time a little faster. As he continued to control the pace, Tony noticed that Steve was gradually putting more and more of his length inside of his mouth, until eventually, Tony found all of Steve's length at the back of his throat. He squeezed Steve's hand as he adjusted to his length, gagging just a little bit, but not pulling back.
"Thanks, Bruce. And to answer your question, it was kinda hard to tell what was happening past the panic attack I was having. So, no, I don't remember anything." He paused, looking off to the side. "Scratch that, I remember everything before the severe panic attack."
"This might feel uncomfortable." He warned. He slowly pushed his index finger inside, causing Steve to arch his back and clench around him. His toes curled and he threw his head back, his cock also twitching in response.
"You need to fix this. You should tell him everything since he did the same for you."
"Right, my bad. But come on, you have to admit you have the body of an adonis. You literally breathe sex and-"
"No, no I'm not fucking doing this." Tony got up from his spot and pushed past Natasha, making his way towards the door. He was stopped by Thor grabbing his arm, but it effectively pissed the genius off and set him off. He retracted his hand and turned towards the Asgardian, fire in his eyes and teeth bared. "
Warning, there is smut in this chapter, if you do not like it do not read. The smut begins just shortly after Steve puts away the dishes, and says the words "I do". You have been warned. Happy reading!
The walk to the hallway at least gave him some time to think about what he was doing. He wasn't going to lie and say he wasn't uncomfortable at the gesture he was about to do, because quite frankly he hasn't been very nice to the soldier. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he gives Steve his sketchbook and art supplies? Yeah, if that isn't very suspicious or weird for him to do. He was also uncomfortable at the thought that he might have to apologize to Steve, and well, that would be harder to do. You see, pride is a dangerous demon, one Tony has yet to conquer sometimes. It's controlling, manipulative, it keeps a nasty grip on you, gripping your throat tight in its imaginary hand so tight if you so much as think or try to say the wrong thing because pride won't let you admit your faults. It's one out of the many demons he has yet to surpass, but hey, one thing at a time.
They pull back, and Steve takes the ring out of the box and holds it between his fingers for a bit. "There's something written on the inside if you wanna read it before putting it on. There's also something on the outside too, I think you'll love reading both of them." He holds it for Tony to grab, and the genius picks it up and holds it in his own fingers just like Steve did.
"Your wish is my command, Captain." He whispered seductively, climbing down off of Steve and leading him to the bed. The soldier sat down on the edge of the bed, watching as Tony's hands fumbled with his belt, successfully unbuckling it and working on the button in the front. It was a sight to watch as skilled hands who have probably done this many times pulled down his zipper, watching as the hunger and lust in Tony's eyes grew more as he continued to explore the barriers between Tony's hands and the soldier's erection. It excited Steve that Tony was all his, and that his old playboy ways were no more, that he would only be doing this with him. It made him smile, but soon that smile turned into a gasp of pleasure as he felt a wet feeling along the underside of his shaft.
the serum. Can't get that from the super-spy organization."
"You need to get out of there. This isn't a reconnaissance mission, it's a trap! You're in danger, and so are Clint and Nat!"
"So, you asked me how I'm doing, and the answer is great. Peachy. Perfect. Fine. Is that a good enough answer?"
"Then I will help you." She felt a small nudge against her side, and when she looked down, she saw a claw with a cup of coffee held out to her. "Oh, what is this? And thank you, I appreciate it." She said, taking the mug.
I ask simply because I'm curious, and I know some of you are enjoying the story as is, but I wanted to know which you prefer!
"I was hoping to ask you the same question. He has not returned from his mission, and I am very worried."
"Well, hello there chef Romanoff. What's on the menu today?" Her head snapped to look at him and he saw her lips curve upwards into a smile.
. Fucking. Touch me." The God of Thunder just looked at him, understanding where his anger was coming from. "I tried to help solve this whole situation, and instead I put myself in danger; no, not just myself, but the rest of us as well! I'm not going to do this, I cannot and
"I'm not weak," I stated. I felt his hand grab my chin again, forcing me to look at him. His hand was under my shirt, resting on my stomach.
He trusted this man. He
"No," Steve said, "I want to do this. I want you." As Tony gazed into his eyes, he noticed those blue ocean eyes were a shade darker, tinted with lust written in them. It made Tony bite his lip in response as he's never seen this side of Steve before, and it thrilled him, even more, to know that this was a side of Steve only
"I'll be back later. Hopefully if or when this all blows over, I'll be back at the tower before you know it."
"Nobody has ever said that about me before. It means a lot, truly it does. Thank you, Mr. Stark."
"I got you, big guy. Do you trust me?"
"You let yourself get caught so easily. And I'm so disappointed in you." He whispered. The gentle caress of his hand on my cheek soon turned into a vice-like grip on my chin. I couldn't turn away from him, I could only sit there and let my eyes stare into his. "Why were you stupid enough to get caught like that? I thought you were stronger than that."
"Well you totally can, but the question is do you want to be my boyfriend?" The soldier's smile grew in size, he leaned forward and captured Tony's lips before pulling back.
"You passed out genius, do you not remember anything?" Natasha asked. He groaned and sat up, a cup of water is presented to him by Bruce. He smiled at the good doctor and brought the cup to his lips, savoring the feel of the crystal clear cold liquid splashing against the inside of his mouth, a content sigh escaping his lips after he swallowed.
"Hello?" He said softly, putting his clothes on in the process.
"I meant the Tower in general, but you're right. We'll fix that later, right now I have other important things to worry about."
"Not one bit." He chuckled at her response, practically feeling her smirk across the other line.
"So uh... What-what's wrong?" He hoped it wasn't anything
"With all due respect, sir, is that really such a bad thing?" Jarvis had a point, is falling for the Captain really such a bad thing? In a sense, no, because he adored Steve, he adored everything about him, it was never about Steve's body, it was about who Steve was as a person. Even if Steve was the ninety-pound asthmatic he was back then, Tony wouldn't treat him any differently than he would now. He was just afraid that with all the insecurities bottled up behind an iron wall inside his chest, that he would hurt him. However, Steve has assured him that he would treat him no differently, and would go through all of his insecurities with him. That's what always made Tony feel more optimistic when it came to the idea of a relationship.
"I love you." He whispered to himself, staring at the one sketch he has of them cuddling in his room. He presses his soft lips against the smooth, papery surface, kissing it with a touch as light as a feather. He couldn't do this to Tony, because for one, he knows the genius harbors no feelings other than hate towards him, and the fact that he's damaged that genius immensely. He's lost all privilege to touch, hold, kiss, and hell, maybe even
His eidetic memory always came in hand whenever he drew, always being able to recall everything perfectly. Tony flipped open the book and was met with the usual drawings he saw at the beginning of the book. Flowers; from roses to lilacs, to chrysanthemums and daisies, it was true beauty how detailed every flower was. Flipping through more pages, he remembers the buildings he drew. Avengers Tower, the Shawarma shop they went to after defeating Loki, the Avengers compound, was all magnificent. The best part about the book, in Tony's opinion, was the drawings of him. Steve captured every detail, once again, perfectly; from the way Tony's shirt hugged his torso, showing off his curves, to the way his pants clung to him, showing off his ass, how he always bit his lip when he was concentrating really hard on a project, and even small moments in the lab where he slept on the couch, hung out with DUM-E, and even moments where Steve was involved, whether it was cuddling in his bed, watching movies together, you name it, it was within this book.
He was so caught up in his emotional turmoil, as he would classify it; because initially, that's what he's experiencing, that he never noticed the elevator stopped with a ding. Ass the elevator doors opened, he saw Fury waiting for him, dressed in his usual all-black clothing, with his signature black trench coat to cover over his normal clothing, and his signature black eye patch.
"Hey, Tony," Bruce said softly, causing the genius to look at him through teary eyes, "it's not your fault."
"Well, nice to see you too, Tony." She said, taking a small sip from her glass of freshly made tea, courtesy of Bruce. He rolled his eyes and dragged his feet over to the coffee machine. Hopefully, a nice cup of coffee will help him relax.
Tony thought. If the mission details that he gave them were simple reconnaissance, then the data
"Makes sense, you got some powerful abilities from that stone they used on you." She smiled at his attempt at humor, lightening up the atmosphere between them. "All we can do is work day by day to make sure he gets back to himself. While I cannot get anywhere near him, maybe the rest of you can and it might work. You willing to try to make his life better, without powers?" She nodded her head, making him smile. He put his arm around her, starting to walk once more.
"Always. You can always come to me if you ever feel lonely." Steve smiled in return, grabbing Tony's hand and letting the genius lift him off of the floor, following him to his room.
The genius placed a kiss onto the soldier's lips, surprising Steve, but he kissed back regardless, his hand moving behind Tony's head to deepen the kiss. When they pulled back, Tony whispered, "I'm gonna make you feel so good. Let's make your first time special, baby." It sent shivers down Steve's spine when Tony's breath hit his ear, causing his erection to twitch in response. The genius smiled and chuckled softly, moving back down to give Steve's cock attention once more.
He's tried so hard to find peace in the situation, tried so hard to allow the man he loves, who just so happens to love him back, comfort him in a way that nobody else knows how. It's not just a simple hug, or a simple kiss, or simple words of affection you can just get from anybody- no, these are gestures and words from a loved one. It's when Tony kisses his eyelids, or just below them when he's crying does he remember that it's ok to feel this way, that he doesn't have to hold all his emotions in. It's the way Tony understands what he's going through and doesn't complain, nor look at him like he's damaged. It's the way he only sees the love in his eyes, the care, the compassion, and understanding does it make his heartache because of how much he's pushing him away.
"What?" Tony asked.
A small click was heard behind him and he turned around. His eyes widened as he saw Steve, standing there with his shield, and a gun pointed at him with his lip split, scratches on his throat, clothes ripped, and his bandages bleeding. He raised his hands slowly, an instant reaction from having someone hold a gun at you, his mind bringing back the image of the fake Fury threatening to kill him.
"Alright, listen here you super asshole," Tony sat down on the chair across from Fury, taking his phone out of his pocket and showing him all the information that he and Jarvis gathered, "this data was heavily encrypted, and I wondered, 'why exactly would Fury not tell his best agents the whole details about the mission.' So, I did some digging and found this crucial information, which, surprise surprise, turns out to be you sending Steve and the spy twins to their doom. So what's your play, huh?"
"Hey." He replied.
"Are you telling me I just painted a target on my back?!" Tony exclaimed.
had something on his mind- whether it was a new invention for Stark Industries, or the team, or his neurons firing rapidly inside his brain and giving him thousands of things to think in one sitting, his brain always had an idea of what his hands should be occupied with. But for now, it was just blank. Empty, fogged, clouded, shrouded, any word you could think of describes Tony's head right now- well, that was almost accurate. His mind wasn't fully blank, as it was still thinking about the soldier.
There's a small intimate scene in this chapter. It occurs while the two are talking, but just know it doesn't really escalate as far, it's just more like a tease, I suppose.
It was when Tony kissed him a second time, softer, more gentle, and not as passionate or deep, did he speak to him for the first time since they got here once they pulled back for air. It was those five words alone that he spoke, that gave him peace of mind, making him forget his problems, and letting him focus on the one thing that matters the most to him, and that was Tony. It was the five words he spoke that let him sleep that night, wrapped in the embrace of a lover who was scared to let him go and lose him. It was those five words that he spoke, that made him truly feel like he was safe and secure.
"I'm sorry..." The words caught him off guard because he did not expect Steve to say that while he is
wanted to talk to him, but more so the fact that he let the genius see how distraught he was, how hurt and betrayed he was. He always tried to keep himself together, because too often vulnerability either got you hurt, or killed. In this case, Steve feels both.
"She was," he smiled, "I loved my mom very much. My dad, on the other hand, I didn't really know much about him, or rather I chose not to remember much about him. You see, my mom usually had nothing but good graces to say about my father, saying he died in the war protecting me and my mom, but later down the line, you come to question why everyone is asking if you were ok. I was confused at first until I had to find out that my dad was abusive to both me and my mom." He looked at Tony with a sad smile, the genius sitting there with a hard-to-read expression on his face, a mix of sadness and confusion Steve would conclude. "I was a child at the time, so it's pretty hard to remember much as a child, but when you grow up as a teen and learn your dad was an alcoholic who hit you and his wife, you tend to wonder what the world has come to. But, nothing much can be done about that." He shrugged and dug into his food once again, letting the silence fester between them.
"Home sweet home," Tony said with a smile on his face. Steve shook his head and chuckled, a warm, loving smile on his face as he laid down next to Tony.
"Oh, right." They shared a small laugh, a happy warm feeling spreading through both their chests. "I'm sorry."
It felt like hours watching Bruce come in and out of the room checking his vitals, making sure to refill his IV drips, occasionally bringing coffee to the genius which he thanked him for. It felt like just as the seconds ticked by, the big hand of the clock moving ever so gently closer to the little hand, that he heard the faint sound of a groan from the blonde. He perked up, his eyebrows lost in his hairline, his eyes wide as he looked at Steve's sleeping figure. He wasn't the only one who heard it as Bruce was already by the soldier's side.
He doesn't know why he was shocked, but it didn't stop him from enjoying what he was doing, or the way his stomach was tingling with butterflies viciously flapping their wings. It made Tony appreciate Steve even more knowing that out of everyone Steve
"Steve..." Tony said weakly. The soldier gave all of his attention to the dying man in his arms, eyes glassy with unshed tears, one hand holding Tony while the other grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers together. His head rested in Steve's lap, letting him look at the crying soldier above him.
Not just his hands, even though they are made to create and give birth to many great inventions, or simply to hold, or pleasure a loved one, they are still dangerous in the sense that they can break a person's heart. And he knows that he has broken Steve's heart- not once, but inexplicably twice. Why does he do this to those he loves?
"What I was going to say before I was rudely interrupted," he glared at the genius, "is that if we cannot get in contact with Thor, then we need to devise a plan with what limited resources we have."
"Trust me, I want to for what you did. But that isn't going to solve the damage you caused. So I suggest getting off your ass instead, otherwise, I'll do it myself." It took the sadistic smile on her face for him to get off his ass and dart straight out of his lab and to the elevator. God, how was he going to do this?
"Yes, it is..."
he thinks to himself as he gets closer to the edge. He inhales deeply and exhales slowly, turning around and noticing Steve, a two-finger salute cast in his direction. Under the helmet, he simply smiled and returned the gesture before he opened his arms wide, and fell backward out of the plane.
"Sure, I would like that." Steve leaned forward and placed a soft, gentle kiss on Tony's lip before pulling away and walking out of the lab. As he heard the door closed, the genius sighed softly to himself, finishing his burger and throwing the wrapper somewhere off to the side.
"He's not my boyfriend, and yes, I didn't have a choice. If I told you earlier, things would have still turned out the same way." He defended.
"I... Love... You." Tony whispered. That's when his body went limp, and the world around him was lost into darkness. That's when Steve kept pleading, begging, asking him to be ok. He held the genius close to his body, the tears continuing to flow down his cheeks as he waited on the roof. He didn't want to let go, he didn't want to live a life without the brunette in it, but once Thor had said the paramedics arrived, that's when he had to let go, watching as Tony's lifeless body was transported, and there was nothing Steve could do except hope that everything was going to be ok, but the fear that Tony might have just died in his arms spoke louder, overshadowing the hope he had.
"You sick, sadistic son of a bitch! When I get my hands on you-".
that the serum can't fix this; it won't fix it like the broken bones in his body, or the scars that litter his still oh so beautiful sleeping face, because this isn't something physical. Granted, in a way the injury is physical, but broken or injured muscles heal with time, and it's not something the serum will fix like his sternum or his ribs.
"Wait, what about you?" He spoke full of concern. Tony just simply smiled at him, and while it was another smile given his way, the situation made it impossible for him to enjoy it.
this man, but was the past participle of love the correct variation to describe how he felt towards him?
"That's beside the point, Rogers. You still lied to me, and I don't know where the fuck you get off telling me I'm a liar when you don't know a damn thing about what I've been going through."
Soon enough they did have to break away, and God did they both miss it so much. It felt so right to be in that moment, that they wanted more, they craved the feeling of their lips together more, but that could wait for later.
"Yeah. We got that already. Anything of
He swallowed the lump in his throat, taking a few seconds to calm himself down before looking back at the screen, his empty brown eyes staring at the soldier who placed himself back onto his bed, resting on his side and just staring at the wall across from him.
"Well, glad to hear that. Now if you'll excuse me I-".
when he wakes up." She sighed and nodded her head solemnly. She turned on her heels and started to exit the room, leaving Steve to his thoughts.
"Thank you, Agent Romanoff," Fury said, "as I was saying, we need to figure out where these extraterrestrials are holding the Captain. And on top of that, has anybody gotten a hold of Thor?"
He just sat there, crying through the night, wishing that everything was just different so he wouldn't have to suffer this much. It's morbid, and he knows it, but he wishes he died back then so he didn't have to experience this right now. How he wishes he died back at the raft so he wouldn't be trapped in this goddamn room, in the place he once called home. And he knows it's a really bad low for him, but how he wishes he could kill himself right now and be done with everything. Anything, was better than the pain and anguish he felt right now, the damaged and almost irreparable heart he kept in his thoracic cavity, he didn't want to feel this way anymore.
Throughout the three weeks, they've gotten closer and closer to each other. The kisses were more intimate, as well as the touching, they communicated to each other their issues with one another, meaning that whenever they weren't feeling 100% themselves, they would talk about it and help each other out. Tony got to see Steve smile way more often, and it was like the guy was never lonely and depressed anymore. Overall, Tony would say the time they've spent together was well deserved, and now he had a date tonight. Oh, right, he had a date to prepare for, he should probably get off his ass and go do that.
someone who is very close to you, and when you saw him you thought this was your chance to save him after the first time you couldn't and I get that. I understand that the Bucky you see, and the Bucky I saw are two different people. He was controlled by Hydra to do something he wouldn't normally do, but I want you to understand that it really hurts knowing that he killed my parents."
As Tony happily shared his bed with the super-soldier, running his fingers through blonde locks, lulling Steve to sleep, he wondered to himself just when did they get this close. Or rather, when did Tony let Steve get this close to his heart that he would allow him into his lab and his bed. Truthfully he didn't care, he just closed his eyes and let himself relax, a smile plastered on his face all night as he comfortably slept next to Steve.
"From the footage you had me record, if you take that piece of data and put the hologram side by side with the screen on the top right, click on the image in the bottom left, the timestamps are similar." He picked up the hologram and did as his AI instructed.
There's another scream, and once again he realizes it's his own, but it's different. He's sweating, hyperventilating, clawing at his clothed-covered body and his eyes move rapidly in different directions. And he realizes he's in his room, but he doesn't care. He's not worried about where he is, but about where he isn't. He races to Steve's room, dreading the worst that he might already be too late, and he might already find his dead body on the floor instead of hearing the gunshot go off.
Being the perfect human, or rather in the case of what the serum was used for, being the perfect soldier, didn't take away from the fact that Steve was a human. And that's what most people forgot what Steve
"I know you do, but I'm sorry." Another kiss was placed on Tony's forehead, the soldier's hand running up and down his back, calming his rampant bundle of nerves seated deep within him. "However," he said with a smirk on his face, "knowing you, you'd find a way to help, and I trust you to figure that out."
"Uhm... Steve, can I talk to you in private?" Tony asked. And truthfully he didn't expect that to come out of the brunette's mouth. Actually, he doesn't what he was supposed to expect, but he knows it at least wasn't that. Regardless, he obliges, stuttering out a quiet "excuse me", to his friend before he stumbles on over to the genius.
"You'd know all about lying, wouldn't you?" The defensive words started to kick in, and it shouldn't have made him angry considering Tony was obviously hurting and still upset with him, but he couldn't help it, it was just in his nature to get somewhat ticked off at the brunette, even if he was used to it by now.
He held him close, listening to Steve's weak heartbeat in his ear, the only indication that he was alive. It was so loud in his own ears, that he never noticed the Quinjet that came to their location, hauled with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that came towards him with a gurney, telling him he needed to step back so they could do their job. He let go of Steve, for now, letting the agents gently put him on the gurney, and carefully as they could get him onto the Quinjet. And he followed them into the jet, not wanting to leave the soldiers' side.
"You have a lot of explaining to do,
"For a genius, you certainly made sure to ask a stupid question." It replied. However, it shook its head and chuckled. "I'm sure one of us already told you if you hadn't figured it out by now, but we wanted to break up the Avengers in our own way, make sure there aren't any threats for other races who want to invade earth."
"Tony." He stopped to look at the blonde, whose face had a slight tinge of red to it, the only known evidence to the genius that he was embarrassed. "You can't be saying those things, someone might be listening in."
His body had a mind of its own and his feet carried him out of the room, his own tears slithering down his cheeks, dripping off his chin and onto the floor. He felt the wave of nausea hit him again, stronger this time. He leaned his body against the wall, keeping himself upright as best as he could. This was some sick twisted game he was in, and he wanted out. What did those assholes do to his precious soldier; the man who he wanted to just hold him in his arms and tell him that it was going to be ok, the man he wanted to whisper sweet nothings in his ear and kiss the tears away. But he couldn't go near him without drawing some painful memories, and it wasn't fair to Steve, and it wasn't fair to Tony. He wanted to do something, anything really, to make the situation better, but what could he possibly do? If he tried to go anywhere near Steve he was a danger to him, and he didn't know what he went through. Before he knew it, he was hunched over a garbage can, emptying the contents of his stomach into it. He felt a hand on his back, soothing circles being rubbed into it trying to comfort him. He spits into the trash bin and looked back, noticing the chestnut brown hair of the girl he met when they found Steve.
"You feel that even though you acknowledge that someone else is in your presence, you yourself feel unhappy because you assume, or rather, you feel as if you are just existing there. That you're unneeded, or you don't want to be there."
The world went black, and the only thing Tony heard in his ear was static, where Steve's beautiful voice used to be.
"Promise."
"It's safe to say that the greatest way to get inside multiple people's minds is to target something you all care about, that would be your precious Captain." Fury spoke.
"Me too."
Regardless of that, the first time he wasn't the one in the hospital bed and stood just like he is now, behind a glass window looking into the operating room where the patient lay was when Rhodey was hurt. He sat behind the glass window feeling powerless to do anything, feeling guilty that if he had just done something different this could have been avoided. Now, this is the second time he's behind a glass window, but instead of Rhodey, it was Steve.
"For a genius, you sure are an idiot." He chuckles at her shrewdness, but it's not really malicious or an insult, it's just her way of breaking the ice between them with a harmless joke. "In all seriousness, I think you should talk to him. Ya know, considering you guys haven't talked in five days, it might do some good."
He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror, the door half-open as he wasn't really doing anything that needed privacy. He ran a hand through his long blonde locks, sighing heavily as he looked at his reflection. He was debating with himself whether or not he should shave off his beard. He didn't really mind it per se, but he kinda misses his clean-shaven look just a little bit.
"I bet 50 bucks that you'd be the one to ask Steve out, and Nat bet Steve would be the one to do it."
And Tony smiled in response and let himself be held in the soldier's warm, and loving embrace. There was nothing to disturb them at this moment, giving the two some much-needed alone time. And it was when Steve pressed his lips against Tony's, drawing the genius into a slow, gentle, and loving kiss, did everything seem right within the world.
"Hey, Cap!" He heard Natasha call out to him, making him turn his head in her direction. "What's the plan?" And he didn't know how to respond to her because he actually didn't get this far, believe it or not. He's more focused on just simply getting into the Raft and coming out with Tony that he didn't think about how they were going to accomplish this. However, it didn't take him more than a few seconds to at least devise a plan, because, well, he is
"I know, but what if something happens to you? I don't want you to get hurt, and if anything happens how will I cope knowing you got hurt and I can't help you? What if... What if you don't come back?"
"Every time I come by this door, I get all giddy knowing I have Captain America looked up like the criminal he is." And wow, what a shocker it was to Steve-not really- that it was Ross who came here to speak to him, the same old sneer in his voice he's heard far too often since he was sentenced here. "I'm going to miss it, I'll say that." This had Steve furrow his eyebrows, causing him to look up. He saw the iron bars retreat sideways into the wall, the glass door opening, allowing Ross to step inside his cell. He felt the familiar aggressive grip in his hair, forcing him onto his wobbly feet. He was weak due to all the blood loss, but did Ross care? Did any of the guards care? No. They made him suffer, they left him in his cell to die slowly, to let his body eat at itself so he remained weak. He could barely stand, and while the center of the raft wasn't far, he still stumbled slightly, making Ross pull him by his hair harder.
"Thank me for what?"
"Don't hurt me anymore, please I'm sorry!" The blonde screamed as the genius tried to get closer to him. He stood there, frozen, listening to the small whimpers that escaped past Steve's lips, listened to the way he sniffled, watched as the tears cascaded down his cheeks. "I'm sorry for being weak, I-I'll be stronger next time! I'll be better, for you. Please... Don't hurt me again, I can't handle the pain!" He watched as he closed himself off from the rest of the world, knees held tightly against his chest by his arms, his head hidden away from him, the way his body racked itself as he sobbed. He couldn't do anything, he couldn't get close to him without Steve freaking out. He wasn't... He wasn't able to make him happy.
Tony hesitantly snuck a small glance at him, and it was just for a fraction of a moment, time ceased to stop as Steve got a glimpse at Tony's eyes. He could see the fear nestled into those brown irises of his, and it caused his heart to lurch once more. Tony was scared of him; and why would he not be? He knows that putting his shield in the chest of Tony's suit was about as low as he could go, especially after Tony confided in him about Obadiah and what he did to him, and he vowed to never be like that man. And yet, he went back on his promise and did exactly what he did, only worse.
"Hang on," he whispered, grabbing his shirt and quietly exiting the room. "Alright, continue. What's the issue?"
Steve sighed and nodded his head, popping the cap of the lube bottle and squeezing some in his hand. He coated himself first, shivering as the cold liquid made contact with his dick before he spread Tony's legs apart. He placed one finger against his entrance, slowly slipping his index finger in, causing Tony to shiver and moan softly, biting his lip shortly after. His finger moved back and forth inside of the brunette, rubbing against his walls and causing the genius's cock to twitch in response. He added a second finger, eliciting a louder moan from his partner, his insides being stretched just a little bit more. A third finger was added, and by this point Tony's knuckles were white, his hands holding the sheets in a vice-like grip. The pleasure from his fingers alone made the genius start to pre-cum, but god he couldn't wait to feel every inch of Steve inside of him. He whimpered at the sudden loss of his fingers, but he could feel Steve start to line himself with his entrance.
He released a breath he didn't know he was holding in, his knees finally giving out under him, causing him to crash against the floor. He panted heavily, his hands shaking violently as he was having a mini panic attack. It took him some time to finally get his breathing under control and for his hands to stop shaking. He picked himself up from the ground and grabbed his phone, all video footage recorded and ready at his disposal. He walked back to the medical bay on wobbly legs, realizing that not only was he one step closer to cracking this whole situation wide open, but that Steve was out there, and he was in danger.
"Ok, this should be simple, right? 'Hey, Cap, I'm sorry about what I said.' No, that won't work, I hurt him badly. 'Hey, I know I said some really horrible things, but I was wondering if you could forgive me.' Fuck, this is harder than I thought it would be." He spent a few minutes going over possible ways he could apologize to his best friend, but time soon ran out as the elevator doors opened, revealing to him the broken, unmoving form of Steve, sitting there in the hallway in front of his door.
It was from their team bonding exercise just a few short months after the whole Loki incident, popcorn scattered around the floor, soda cans standing tall on the table, smiles on their faces, hell, he could even still hear the laughter resonating from the picture. And then the wave of sadness came crashing down on him, full force, like a tidal wave submerging him a wet, mountain of sand, leaving him treading water, reaching for the surface to take that life-saving gasp of air. The more he stared at the picture, the more pain welled in his heart, pulling at the strings inside of the organ until he couldn't handle looking at the image anymore. They were his team; no, they were more than just a team, they were his
"I love you, Anthony Edward Stark," Steve whispered, eyes falling shut. Tony smiled and placed a soft kiss on Steve's head, wrapping his arm around him and holding him close.
"They brought me down to a secret room, and I... I saw him there. I watched him struggle, I listened to him plead for me to help him, and I made it worse." A small gasp escaped past her lips as the tears started to flow, the back of her hand moving to wipe them away. "They made me manipulate his mind, bringing his worst fears to life right in front of them. I listened to him scream, I watched as they handed him the scalpel, and he..." He pulled her into him, his arms wrapping around her as she sobbed into his chest. He too had tears in his eyes, but he quietly shushed her, placing soft kisses on the top of her head. "I'm sorry... They used me to hurt him and get back at you. I only found out the truth after they tried to leave him to die. I just had to rescue him before it was too late."
"We're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Stark. We don't get the luxury to sit back and play with our toys, we put our lives on the line to get stuff done." Tony scoffed in reply.
"Captain Rogers," he jumped as he heard the voice of Jarvis speak to him, "you have been glaring at the coffee machine for a solid ten minutes."
"What kinda idiot do you fucking take me for!? The mission you sent Steve, Nat, and Clint on, the one that got Steve captured, and also possibly getting your spy twins killed!"
He hates it, every second that he's away from the genius and looking at him from across the room, with that small, sad, yet beautiful smile of his, that he returns on instinct but doesn't mean wholeheartedly, does it make him hate the situation he's in. But what can he do about it? He can try to get better, he can try to make the effort to talk, but it would be hard for him. He just hopes the therapy will help him get his voice back, and as for his eye, he
"I have no idea what you're talking about." That smile stayed on the soldier's face as he leaned down and pecked Tony's lips, turning around and walking away after. "Meet you in the kitchen at 8!" Steve yelled before he disappeared from the lab.
"You should give yourself more credit than you tell yourself, Anthony." That got the gears in his head turning, nobody, and he means
"Considering the details of the mission my doppelganger sent them on, it would be safe to say they couldn't have gone far. I'll send you the location, you are to leave immediately." Fury said. His eye then fell upon Natasha and Clint. "Agent Romanoff and Barton."
"I'm sorry Antho-"
"What is it, J?"
"JARVIS!" Tony yelled, watching as screens flickered in his vision, indicating the suit's damage and energy level, "put power into the remaining thrusters!"
"You look so beautiful." He whispered, and it made Tony chuckle softly.
"Sorry, I'm guessing you don't like that?" He rubbed his thigh in comfort.
"Hey," Clint spoke softly, rubbing Tony's shoulder comfortingly, "we're gonna find him and we're gonna get him back, okay? Those fuckers will get what's coming to them, and you know Steve is too stubborn to die. He's probably fighting as hard as he can to see you, the
They walk in silence, and he's not sure where they're going exactly but he doesn't think he can complain about it. This is the closest he's been to Tony in a while, and he all but thought the genius had forgotten about him and moved on. So, for now, he'll take what he can get at this moment. Tony stops suddenly, and he does as well.
When he heard the confirmation from Thor, he continued his flight to the top of the Triskelion, the bright yellow light getting more blinding by the second, until suddenly it diminished in strength. He uprighted himself once he reached the top, cutting his thrusters and landing gently on the roof. He walked slowly, eyes boring holes into the back on the creature that was standing on the roof with him, a staff- no, a scepter, Loki's Scepter, in its hand.
"Not as much as her, but yes I am upset as well. Not much you can do when it seems like you're chasing after a ghost story, and every time you think you've gotten a lead you end up short." Steve sighed, and Tony honestly felt for the guy. It's been pretty hectic for Steve as well, with the suspicious activities of Hydra and the agents they've been apprehending disappearing, mixed in with illegal alien tech, he'd be pretty pissed too.
It's the mere thought of that simple statement in his own mind that leads him to start closing himself off from the shorter male, not really bothering to respond to most of what he's asking. It hurts Tony, and God does it hurt him too, but he's not comfortable with speaking right now. His voice, while still being the same octave it's always been, it's drastically foreign to him as if the stuttering has changed the way he sounds entirely; and in a way, it actually has, not by changing his tone of voice, but how he's able to form a sentence. He can't form a singular sentence containing, or beginning with consonants, because that's when the stuttering happens. Every sentence he could form, no longer an option for him. He could only answer yes or no questions with just a simple nod of his head.
"What are you doing in the meantime?"
"God, you're big. It's been killing me to see this for a while. I'll make sure to treat you well, Captain." Steve was effectively bigger than the guys he's done this with before, and it was going to be a mouthful, considering that as a super-soldier he was packing some heat in all the right places; not only his dick but also his ass. Seriously, Steve's ass was probably Tony's favorite part about him, besides his amazing personality. Without distracting himself any further, he licked the underside of the soldier's shaft, causing the blonde to throw his head back and let out a moan of pleasure, exciting the brunette even further. He took his time making his way up towards his tip, enjoying the way Steve trembled, his hands gripping the sheets at his sides. He placed the tip against his lips, soft kisses placed against it, causing the soldier to blush a little. It was so adorable the way Steve acted, all tough and dominant, but at heart, he was still just a little bit shy, and Tony adored it. He swirled his tongue around the head before ever so slowly, opening his mouth and placing Steve's cock inside his mouth.
"I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry, Steve. I've been an asshole for the past five days and I... I thought I was helping and doing something right by staying in the lab and I... I'm just so
right in front of him.
"Over here, Spangles." He voiced. He heard the soldier's footsteps carry him over to the couch where Tony resided, the seat next to him dipping a bit as he sat down next to the genius. He could feel the other staring at him, waiting for him to look in his general direction. He gave in and turned his head to look at the blonde, his own angry expression staring into Steve's stoic one.
like Steve, which made this more realistic than it needed to be as it closed its eyes once more, white light blinding the genius yet again. This time, when he was able to look again, he saw the creature was dressed up in Steve's Captain America outfit.
"We'll figure this out together, they're not gonna get away with this." He nodded his head in response, all words he wanted to say locked away, safe for only Steve's ears. Time seemed to move at an agonizing pace, the heart monitor seemed louder in his ears, even the humming from the lights above them seemed to pierce his eardrums. It was all too much for Tony to bear, but he sat through it. He wanted to be here for Steve, he needed to be here for him, he wasn't going to leave this spot until he got to see Steve wake up with his own eyes.
"We've apprehended one of those things that were responsible for the capture of Captain Rogers, so I thought you'd wanna ask some questions." A strange feeling washed over Tony; it pooled and swirled inside his chest first, making its way to his fingertips as they tingled, his fingers slowly curling until he formed a fist. It was a weird feeling of anger festering inside of him, but in the mix, he could feel something along the lines of revenge. Was that the feeling? It felt like it. He was going to march down there and let every ounce of hatred drip off of him in the form of either words or maybe fists. He was hoping for the latter.
The early morning rays of the rising sun coated the expanse of the room, leaving no corner untouched. The lone body on the bed sleeping peacefully, until he started to stir when the light started to cascade over his face. His eyes fluttered open briefly before they closed again, the sunlight hurting his eyes. He rolled over onto his side and opened his eyes again, noticing the ruffled blanket, and the huge space where he was almost certain, a blonde slept in last night. He stretched for a moment, feeling the satisfying pop of his joints before he turned back over and stared at the ceiling.
"He went t-to the R-Raft? Without m-me?" If Tony had just told him where he was going or, rather had told him more than just the simple fact that he and T'Challa made a plan, then he for sure would have gone to the Raft with Tony. If he had gone, he'd have someone watching his back- and he means in the literary sense of watching his back and not his ass- and he'd be back at the facility already.
"Steve... What are you doing?"
Imagine this; you're given a serum that enhances your body physically, turning a scrawny, dangerously sick person into the picture-perfect face of human perfection. All illnesses simply disappear, you get stronger, faster, you gain super hearing, and your body metabolizes food and drinks faster than a normal person, making it so that you eat more than an average person, and you are unable to get drunk. You don't need as much sleep, you can stay up longer than any normal human, you can go longer without eating, and you never tire easily. As Tony stared into Steve's eyes, of which were comparable to that of a beautifully woven spider web, or rather in this particular conundrum, a shattered mirror, he could truly see just how tired the man really was; not tired in the sense that he needed sleep, but tired in the sense that he was being put through so much trauma and he just wanted it to stop.
"What do you mean?"
be doing. The mission that Steve and the spy twins went on, definitely falls under his "shouldn't have done it in the first place" list.
He screamed, for the first time. He screamed out in anguish, in pain, in suffering as he recalled every hurtful event from his past all because of that stupid word
It was all just a matter of time whether Steve could fix things between him and Tony, or whether it was too late to do so.
"JARVIS?"
Tony with all his heart, and he was willing to endure as much as he could to return to normal. He wanted to see those brown eyes light up whenever he saw him, how sometimes he would lean closer to Steve out of everyone else when they had movie nights, how he would confide his secrets into Steve because the soldier was always there, ready to listen, how the little touches they shared set his skin ablaze, he missed all of it.
And that's all the words that he needed to hear to have him let out a sigh of relief because all the waiting was worth it in the end.
To Tony, Steve's teeth feel like fire against his skin; a hot, blazing fire that sets scorches the area it touches and litters his arms with goosebumps and makes a shiver run down his spine, causing him to arch into the blonde. It doesn't burn him as the super-soldier twists his skin between his teeth, no doubt making a very noticeable hickey, but he doesn't care because it feels
"How exactly can I move forward from this?" She questioned.
reaching his room, closing the door behind him, and heading over to his closet, pulling out a small book from the back corner. He sat on his bed, flipping to an empty page and letting the pencil dance across the wide expanse of paper, creating an image from memory. Each fine detail, each line was carved and engraved into the paper, his eyes following every motion his hand-created, pulling back only when the picture was complete to admire his work. It was an image of the team, captured in the most perfect scenario he remembered.
"You ok?" He smiled and walked over to him, wrapping his arms around his neck without so much as a second thought and pulling him in for a hug.
"I don't like the looks of this..." Clint warned. "Feels like a wild goose chase if you ask me?"
was to him. Their knees were practically touching each other, their bodies within proximity, and if he moved his hand just a little bit, he could hold Steve's hand.
He still believes that the genius is only in the lab because he's trying to find a cure that Steve
"I l-love y-you t-too, T-Tony." And once again those words hold a powerful meaning over the genius, that this time he doesn't leave during the night. This time he stays throughout the night, snuggled up close against the soldier's body as he holds him close, feeling his hot, steady breath against his ear, and the steady rise and fall of his chest. And for Tony, well, he's right where he should've been. He's right where he's always wanted to be
"Technically he does, considering it was S.H.I.E.L.D. who found your body in the ice and thawed you out. So whether you like it or not, your S.H.I.E.L.D. property." The word 'property' left a bad taste not just in Steve's mouth, but Tony's as well. It also left a feeling of anger swelling inside the chest of the super soldier, his hands forming into fists at his side.
"Anthony. You're rambling."
"I know you're a human being, Steve. But do you really think I have the power to talk Fury out of letting you come with us? Regardless if you're still adjusting to this world, or if you just got your life back, we do have a job to do." She was right, and that's the sad part. S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't care about whether the super soldier was still trying to adapt to his new life, if he was still capable in combat, or reconnaissance, they would use him for that. It sickened him that he was reduced to nothing more than a simple guinea pig.
And maybe it's weird that he's not fighting crime at the moment, or there's no one threatening him or his family, or his super-soldier boyfriend because it would just fall under the "normal" status quo of his superhero life. It's just too quiet for him, and it's just so unnatural. Even in his lab where he tinkers constantly- whether he's upgrading the Iron Man suit or his team's suits, it's always loud in the lab. But that loudness is different from the loudness of a supervillain threatening to take over the world or destroy his precious tower.
"You're a romantic at heart, but a huge sap as well. Not that I mind, I like everything about you." Steve smiled at how sweet Tony was, even if he denied that he could be a sap as well at times, it was nice that he showed his true self to the soldier.
I was back in Brooklyn, everything just the way it was before I went under the ice; the streets were bustling with people, gals with their arms around their guys, kids playing in the streets where the cars didn't drive through, normal people just carrying on with their daily lives. I miss this, I miss
"Do you wanna do this?" Tony asked quietly, his eyes opening slightly to see how close and intimate he was to Steve. He saw Steve look down for a brief second before looking back up into Tony's eyes. He licked his lips and nodded his head slightly.
a part of him. After all, it was inside his chest.
"I said thank you."
He wanted to bite down on his hip bones, raking his teeth across his skin so he left bruises on the blonde that would no doubt heal in a few hours. Every second he endured watching the soldier give himself to Tony, the more he was oh so close to seeing what lay under his clothes, and oh how badly he wanted to see what a super soldier's dick looked like.
So, they stayed there while Natasha dealt with Clint and the rest of the Avengers who filtered into the Compound, making sure they stayed away from the top floor. It was a nice peaceful moment for the couple, and after everything that has happened to them.
"My powers are very strong, and they bring out the worst thoughts in a person's mind. I'm not even sure I could get into his mind to bring forth any good thoughts he might be suppressing." She explained.
for him not to leave. It must've been a pretty horrible nightmare, oh who was he shitting, it was most definitely a horrible nightmare if the whimpering and prominent sweat were any indications.
"Mr. Stark." Fury's voice boomed, a hint of warning laced within his words. "Need I remind you why you are here?" Tony scoffed in response.
"I can just see the fear written all over you. Why don't I help magnify that fear by giving you a first-hand experience of what the mind stone can really do?" He was too scared to move, he watched as the scepter moved closer to his face, a blinding yellow light staring at him in the face until he willed his eyes shut. Specs of white and black danced around behind his closed eyelids until they suddenly stopped, but when he opened his eyes, everything was different.
"Wanda Maximoff, it's nice to meet you, Mr. Stark." He looked at her and furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them.
He watched as the scalpel made contact with his skin, cutting him open, creating a crevice in his chest where he could see a hemostat making its way inside of him. He shuddered, which only grew in size as he started to watch himself convulse, heard himself scream, watched these people put their arms on him to hold him down as he thrashed about, prodded at him, and felt around inside his thoracic cavity, feeling every ounce of pain he knew he was in. He closed his eyes, not wanting to look anymore, and then suddenly the screaming stopped.
Maybe it started back when he was just a skinny kid in Brooklyn, equipped with Asthma, and a medical list so long telling him what was wrong with him, that this feeling of loneliness started. No, that can't be right either. He wasn't really alone back then; he had his mother, - bless her heart, she was a strong woman and he still remembered all the things she taught him and how hard she worked to make sure he had all the necessities in his life - he had his best friend Bucky, the guy who always saved him from getting his ass handed to him on multiple occasions just because he didn't like bullies, and he had the girl. Peggy Carter was her name. A fine name for a fiery girl such as herself, but he lost all of them when he decided to put that plane in the water.
"Good morning to you, too, Stark. Just decided to cook everybody some breakfast." She replied. She turned off the stove and placed the bacon onto the plate, nestling up next to the eggs. She grabbed the plate and the glass of orange juice and held them out for him to take. "I was going to have JARVIS tell you that I made you breakfast, but since you're already here, might as well join the rest of us." He smiled and took the plate and glass from her, making his way over to the table and sitting down at the end of the table next to Bruce, who smiled at him as he sat down.
"Yeah. My foot in your ass, now, open the damn door!" He furiously jiggled the doorknob, still finding it locked. He heard footsteps and a heavy sigh, followed by the sound of the handle
He doesn't know how long he's been flying for, but once the calm waves of the clear blue ocean turn a darker, more greyish shade, and the waves crashed into each other, mixing with the heavy rain that made a hard pitter-patter against his suit, was he getting closer to his destination. He's not going to lie and say he's got this totally under control, because really anything can happen. Knowing Ross, he's obviously not stupid, and he's not going to let Tony simply slip under his radar. It was a risk he was willing to take.
"Honey?" Steve calls.
"Sir, I think you should take a look at the screen in the bottom left, the footage in the upper left corner," Jarvis said. His eyes moved over as well as the cursor, clicking on the image. He saw Fury entering the security room, his head turning in different directions, a gun hidden in the pocket of his cloak that Tony could see from the angle of the camera.
He was in a weird spot; not weird in the sense that he was uncomfortable in his current position but weird in the sense that usually he was the one to leave the other before they woke up. This was ironic cause nowadays, Tony never would get up early due to always spending time in his lab. Guess he was more tired than he thought he was, but that's what 3 days of no sleep will do to you before you decide you want to hang out with a super soldier and
He lays on his side just like he remembers from the first night. Snuggling up with Tony and holding him in his arms, feeling his lips on his, and all of that just gone within the span of five days, almost an entire week. He thinks to himself, where did he go wrong? Did he truly deserve this life he's cursed to live now? He blames himself because he's too in love to blame Tony; and maybe it's the love he
He had good news for Tony once he finished his therapy session, and he was really excited to tell him. He got his stuttering down to a minimalist proportion- meaning that he could at the very least attempt to form a coherent sentence without stuttering too much, but that didn't mean he was going to stop stuttering. Tony said he'd be back soon, and he thought that he'd be back by now, but as he opened the door he saw no sign of the genius. So, he waited, and waited, and waited. Seconds turned into minutes, and then the minutes soon rolled into hours, and he was getting more worried with each time measurement that was dwindling.
"Since when did you learn how to cook?" He stabbed his eggs with his fork, bringing the bits of food to his mouth. He stopped chewing for a second and just savored the taste of the eggs. They were so fluffy, such an amazing texture that caused his mouth to water as he continued to chew, his eyelids fluttered and he let out a satisfying moan. "Holy fuck, this is amazing!"
The first stop they went to was the shopping mall, because Tony decided it would be a good idea to have Steve try on an assortment of clothes just a size too small for the super-soldier, just so he could see the muscles and the toned body of his friend. Needless to say, Steve wasn't too happy being Tony's personal model, but the genius more than made up for it by allowing the soldier to pick out his own clothes. He relented at first because he liked his wardrobe as it was now, and didn't want the genius to spend money on him, considering he could do that for himself. However, Tony's stubbornness won in the end and he ended up buying one outfit he really liked. He really tried to talk Tony out of paying for the more than expensive outfit he picked out, but Tony assured him that it really didn't matter and that he was more than happy to pay for whatever Steve wanted.
"They wanted to keep us preoccupied with what was happening with our Captain so they could go undetected while they infiltrated the Triskelion," Bruce explained. "It's classic misdirection; you're distracted on one specific thing that you're unable to see anything else."
to get help with this. "Is there a place you have in mind?"
He heard laughter around him, loud, malicious laughter, and it got closer until the husk of someone's breath was right next to his ear. He let out a strangled sound when a hand grasped his throat, and pain shot through his abdomen. The fake world around him dissipated, and he was back at the Triskelion, Loki's spear embedded in his abdomen. Blood pooled at his mouth, dripping onto the roof floor, eyes glassy and vision blurred due to tears.
"Are you sure about that?" Suddenly it felt too hot for Tony in the interrogation room. He could hear Natasha speaking into his ear, he could see her trying to get his attention, but nothing was registering as the fear took control of his body. There was this random ringing in his ear, too loud for him to bear, the room was suddenly too bright, and his chest felt too tight. He abruptly got out of his seat, exiting the room and making his way towards the elevator. The entire ride up until the main entrance of S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ was filled with nothing but terror gripping his heart. He took off back towards the tower in his Iron Man suit, getting there as quick as he could.
He turns off the water and steps out of the shower, leaving his workout clothes on the bathroom floor to be picked up later. He traverses across his room, drying off his hair, small wisps of air hitting his bare skin. He noticed that moonlight was barely inching its way into his room, touching whatever inch of the room the moonbeams could find. Just how much time has passed today? He pulls out a pair of boxers briefs, the only article of clothing he needed in the middle of the night for bed.
"Show me all of 'em." Holograms appeared within his vision, and his focus was given to all of them. He enjoyed watching how Steve used to be so clueless on how to work today's modern technology, that a rather cute pout would form on his face. He appreciated how Steve always took the effort to be by Tony's side and make sure he was in tip-top shape, always putting his health first before anything. He loved how Steve would cook for him in the morning and bring him food whenever he could, it was the little moments they shared that brought a smile to Tony's face. All the little kisses and hugs, all the loving embraces and cuddling, even the first time they made love, and Tony smiled at it all. He didn't even know he was on the verge of crying until he felt a lone tear slide down his cheek. He whipped it away and just sat there, remembering the good times before everything was ruined.
"I want to." He watched as the soldier placed the belt off to the side, any words Tony wanted to say were caught in his throat as he watched the top piece of Steve's Captain America suit slowly start to lift, revealing the skin underneath. His breath hitched when he saw Steve's skin, and he so desperately wanted to run his hand over the blonde, feeling every inch of him, wanting to know just how smooth Steve felt under his touch. He bit his lip as he watched his thumbs slip into the waistband of his suit and the boxers he wore underneath, the fabric slowly sliding down his hips, revealing more of his skin to the genius. Tony was doing really well to not touch himself right then and there, the tightness in his crotch area absolutely unbearable, but he didn't want to move or he would miss the sight of his soldier unveiling himself right before his eyes.
"Then I assure you, sir, that Captain Rogers feels the same way. If anybody can make him happy, it is you."
"Captain Rogers?" Someone calls, breaking him out of his thought process. He jumps a little, his head bobs slightly and his eyebrows shoot upwards as he turns his head and looks towards the male doctor inching slightly out the door.
"I can't walk out looking like this, what will the others say?"
"Sir, I'm detecting a secret passage to your right," Jarvis said. The hologram disappeared and his hand pressed on a hollow part of the wall, revealing to him a staircase behind the wall. His breath hitched as he slowly walked down the stairs, footsteps echoing around him. When he reached the bottom, he noticed a desk littered with abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, rows upon rows of old tech taken apart, mixed in with ordinary human technology. His eyes gazed upon the floor stained with water, stained with just a hint of blood to turn it a shade of crimson. His eyes moved onto the lab table, noticing a scalpel coated in fresh blood accompanied by an empty syringe, the sight making his stomach knot. He noticed the chair with restraints tied tightly on the armrests.
"Oh, so you are willing to talk to me. That's nice to know." The genius rolls his eyes at him, crossing his arms, and shrugs his shoulders, his eyebrows cast downwards as an unamused expression washes over his facial features. And now Steve's hurt because it's as if Tony is blaming him for not talking to him when
He said, venom dripping off every word. The spy simply stood there, his hand behind his back after he closed the door. "Don't just stand there, you asshole, tell me why you sent them on that mission?!"
"No, no, it's... It's fine, I appreciate you caring about me and taking this slow. It's just..." He trailed off and sighed, taking his hands away from his face and looking side to side, trying to hear or spot any disturbance in the area. "Fuck it." He muttered.
"Yeah. There's more of him, but I always have a soft spot for Dum-E. He may not be the smartest, but he was my first creation." He watched as the robot settled itself into its charging station, its claw dropping slowly as it powered down and entered sleep mode. He smiled, memories of making Dum-E in his father's workshop coming back, and he kept him all these years. Tony cared for his creations, even if he gave Dum-E a hard time and always threatened to turn him into scrap metal or send him off to a college where they can use him for spare parts, he'd never do that, because he cares about him very much.
The footsteps stopped, pressure applied to his head so he could not turn in any direction to look, but did he care? He's accepted it, already. That this was the end of the line for him as the cold barrel of a gun was placed against his head. He didn't care to squirm, nor did he care to plead for his life. He had nothing to live for. He lost the girl, lost his best friend- two times in a sense, once on the train and once again to Hydra controlling his mind-, lost the life he once had, and he lost the man he loved due to an ungovernable situation. Steve Rogers had nothing to live for. The one thing he had to live for, Tony Stark, had betrayed him, broken him, left him unrepairable, and Steve just accepted it.
"Just k-keep guard!" He yelled over his shoulder. He pushed past the double doors and into the control center of the Raft, and just like the room before him, it was empty.
The ride back down to his lab was silent, giving him time to brew and fester in his thoughts. He hoped he didn't say anything that would set the soldier off; granted he's said a lot of things that had set Steve off when they didn't like each other, but this is different.
"Of course that'd be the first thing you say. Not that I'm complaining, it was cute, But that's beside the point, what did you have to go do?"
"So after you kicked the bad guy's ass, they just vanished into thin air?"
"Would you change what you did?" He looked Tony straight in the eyes, serious expressions on both of their faces. "If you had the chance to take back what you did; if you could have changed the decision you made about crashing that plane in the water, would you?"
He heard a window break just a short distance away from him, a creature bounding on all fours rapidly gaining distance towards him. He held his left hand out, firing at the creature. It leaped into the air, avoiding the blast and landing onto a banged up and discarded car, teeth bared at Tony, smiling at him. A shiver traversed his spine as he switched to the miniature rockets located on the suit's shoulder, firing a few of them at the creature. It was agile, it moved like a blur and it was hard for Tony to land really anything on this creature.
"Language." A familiar voice said. He turned around, brown eyes locking on to blue ones that belonged to Steve, a faint smile on his face, and the fresh mop of blonde hair swept in different directions, the only indication that he might have either just woken up, or he's been awake for a while.
afraid to hurt you. Do I make myself clear?"
It was the middle of the day, and the sounds of robots scurrying across the lab, mixed in with the swears and the shouts of a certain browned, curly-haired genius, were never dull at this time of the day. It's been three weeks already, and Tony can say with certainty that he finally feels ready to start a relationship with the good Captain, however, he doubts that he'll tell him any time soon since he still has those nagging feelings that tell him he isn't good enough. In the meantime during those three weeks, he's spent his quality time with Steve, going on dinner dates, finally touching the surface of Star Wars, which was funny in itself since there were a lot of pop culture references for Steve to get, nonetheless, he liked it.
"Let's go back in time real quick. Steve, Nat, and Clint went on a mission of reconnaissance that the real Fury administered, but when they captured the Hydra agents, they suddenly disappeared. I'm willing to bet that they were simply there as a means to get information on us. I'm inclined to say they gathered information on all of us and were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Except we haven't encountered their leader yet, it's just been the little ones giving us hell. There's only one place, or organization that I can think of that would allow them to blend in, for them to carry out their operation."
"Who says I don't already?" Tony opened his mouth to reply but was cut off by the sound of Steve's laugh filling the room. He closed his mouth and simply smiled, letting his AI have the last word, for now, and just enjoyed this side of Steve. It really did feel like the first time Tony ever truly saw Steve this happy, and he was going to enjoy it as much as he could.
"The man out of time himself, Captain America. Your little boy toy you managed to make property out of."
These thoughts confused Steve because, where he was raised, if anybody ever found out you were having homosexual thoughts, let alone actions with the same sex, it could get you killed. But here in the new world, according to Tony, it was normal to feel these things, let alone express them with whoever you loved. Where the confusion scratched the surface of what he was feeling, acceptance and a little curiosity seeped forth through the cracks. He wanted to feel this uncontrollable surge of happiness flooding through his veins, showing through his smile and his eyes whenever Tony was around. He craved it like a drug, except it wasn't exactly a drug. He wouldn't classify it as a drug either. To Steve, it wasn't a drug, because that implied it was something you were consumed by and couldn't stop wanting or needing. No, this was the feeling of attraction, a small crush forming when you meet the right person. Yes, he could feel the way he did when he met Peggy. The way he wanted to hold the genius and not let him go, how he felt his heartbeat quicken at the moment, how he adored those brown eyes of his and the pink of his lips, it made him feel so many things he didn't know how to express, but truthfully he did know how to express it, he just hoped it wouldn't backfire.
"Hey, Steve I-" He froze in place, head slowly turning towards the intruder standing in the doorway. He felt his face heat up, a deep blush of scarlet painting his cheeks, and he was hoping that it was dark enough for the other to not see how embarrassed he was. He was thankful that he was at least at an angle where the intruder couldn't see his front side, but sadly it gave the person a great view of his ass. He covered himself up and turned away from the door, too embarrassed to try and make any form of eye contact.
"Neither, cause we're not dating." Technically they weren't, so Tony wasn't exactly wrong. They were merely taking it slow and doing things that couples would normally do; which all include the following: holding hands, kissing, flirting, and spending time together. In actuality, maybe there would be a time where they would be official, but for now, taking it slow is something that seems to be working, even if Tony is still trying to adjust to it.
"Ah yes, your poor, precious, boy toy. How could we forget, his screams of pain are still engraved in my mind. What I wouldn't give to hear them again." He tried getting up again to punch the creature in its face once more, but Natasha's firm grip held him in place.
"And I just wanted to know what all
"Thanks, Tony. Well, I guess we shouldn't waste any time then. How about we start eating?"
"Oh, hey," he said weakly, "sorry you have to see me like this." Her smile was kind, her hand still rubbing circles on his back as she spoke.
After that first sketch, every page after was filled with Tony. His own smile never faltered as he continued thumbing through the pages, remembering each reason and memory of how and why this image was here. And still, to this very day does he continue to think Tony is beautiful; even if his eyes are cold, and his posture is stiff, he's more distant with him than he's ever been, and he averts his gaze from his own, he's never stopped being the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
"Trust me, my little witch, you can put all the blame on yourself if you want to, but that doesn't make things better. You messed up, but who hasn't messed up in their life." He pats her shoulder and smiles; a real genuine smile, not a fake one he reserves just for the public, but a real genuine down-to-earth smile. "I know I've messed up a lot in my life, but we can only move forward."
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I never said I wasn't going to hurt you, but right now the super-soldier seems to be gone. Emotionally gone, anyways."
The doors open for the last time, and he's being pulled once more by the soldier out of the elevator. His feet press against the cool wooden flooring, which soon turns into marble titles and he knows since he's the one who built this place alongside Pepper, that they're on the rooftop. He feels Steve let go of his hand, and so he patiently waits for his queue to open his eyes.
"We need to put an end to this somehow. We need to figure out where these things are and put a stop to it." Tony stated, tending to Steve's wounds in the process as he spoke. Shortly after the incident between the two, Tony took it upon himself to get the soldier cleaned up. He sent Wanda to S.H.I.E.L.D. so she could get Natasha, Clint, and Bruce back to the tower so they could figure out a plan to end this once and for all.
"What?"
"I know you are about to see Captain Rogers, but I think there are some things I need to tell you." She spoke professionally. He raised an eyebrow at her, however, because he was confused.
." It was the use of his last name, spoken out of anger and disdain that it made his skin crawl, littering it with goosebumps. Tony only ever used his last name when he was either angry with him, or just didn't care to call him by his first name; which by this point he's sure Tony will never call him that ever again. He's lost the privilege of being called Steve.
to put every ounce of trust he has that the genius won't betray him a second time.
"Tony?" He turned around and as he made eye contact with the genius, pain coursed through his shoulder. He grit his teeth, his left arm flying to comfort his right shoulder. His eyes widened in panic, the genius in front of him holding a gun, barrel sizzling with smoke from the shot he just took. "T-Tony? W-What are you-", he was cut off when the gun was angled down at his left leg, effectively dropping him to his knees, painful gasps making their way past his lips. He looked up and stared into brown eyes, a hand caressing his cheek as his eyes trembled.
It kills him so deep on the inside like a knife was just embedded into his chest and it's slowly being dragged downwards, creating unbearable pain and tension in his chest that he can't breathe. He hates the fact that Steve is so scared, and he's begging the genius to help him, but he doesn't know how.
Despite all of this, even with him having as much faith as he does in believing in his lover, it still doesn't take away the creeping pain that pulsates in his chest. He feels forgotten, neglected, used,
"T-Tony?" I said through chattering teeth. I looked at his face and noticed a bucket, water dripping onto the floor at the edge. Now I know exactly what woke me up, but I wasn't sure where I was, or why I was here. I wasn't even completely sure why Tony was here.
"Sir, I'm worried about you," JARVIS spoke once more. He sighed to himself and rested his head against his palm, staring at nothing.
mean no. You are not going on another mission without me. I forbid it." Tony argued. It has been a month so far and things have been going relatively smoothly for the time being. Tony and Steve have been spending every second of the day getting to know more about each other, going out on dinner dates, spending some quality alone time in their bedroom, and even going outside for some walks in the park, and whatever other activities they choose to do in the busy streets of Manhattan. And now, Steve was down here in his lab, telling him that Fury is sending him and the super spy twins out on another mission,
"I don't even know where to begin, really," she started, "we split up and I tried to get back to where we were originally before we split up. Next thing I knew, the lights started to flicker, and there was this shadow in the room. It wasn't exactly human, because humans don't move around that fast unless you have super speed." The trembling in her fingers got worse as she continued. "It for sure wasn't human, but what scares me the most was that it had Clint's face." She turned to look at her injured partner, his heart monitor beeping normally. "It got in my head, he attacked me and I held back because it was different. This wasn't Loki's mind control, it's like he knew what he was doing. I held back, but that's when things took a turn for the worse."
So, he spends his time listening to T'Challa talk about how he's been rereading the accords and feels as if there is a way to change the documents so that it will be able to guarantee the safety of Steve, and the other rogue Avengers as well. He thinks that this is a great opportunity to get the entire team back together, and hopefully make amends to the terrible situation everybody is in, but while he is totally on board with what T'Challa is saying, he also tells the king that Steve is his top priority right now and that he wants to try and help him out first.
Good things can only last so long, however, and as quick as it came it was taken away in an instant. The Quinjet rumbled and rocked in the air, red warning lights flashing inside and all around him. He panicked, turning his head to the side, noticing the right-wing of the jet was broken, smoking, and on fire.
"Thank you, Tony."
"They're still running around S.H.I.E.L.D. is what you're saying?" Wanda concluded.
"We just arrived. Black Widow and Hawkeye are about to land this thing. We'll meet you-". An explosion sounded in Tony's ear where Steve's voice used to be, causing his eyes to widen and a chill to go down his spine.
As soon as the words left Ross's mouth, Steve pushed the steering wheel of the jet forward, propelling it forwards and out the harbor entrance. He soared through the sky, past the vast oak trees, hovering above them. While the plan may have been full proof, and Tony had provided a good enough distraction, the soldier not only had no idea where to go but he was caught in a web of worry.
It's just a normal day for Steve and Tony, all while Steve is on his mission.
It was that stupid-ass nickname Tony had given him that had any sort of effect on him. All of his words he just ate up, but upon hearing the world
"Alright, Wakanda it is." He replied. They stared into each other's eyes for just a moment. So much emotion was conveyed and confined between just the simple gazes they shared. He saw the sadness, the perpetual fear that his voice would never be the same and that he might not get his perfect eyesight back, all within those deep ocean blue eyes. Steve saw the same sadness he had, mirrored in Tony's own brown eyes, flashes of guilt swimming to the surface and turning his iris just a shade darker. How they both were hurting, and how they both so desperately hoped that everything would be ok. And it was Tony who was the one to speak, his voice full of so much hope and confidence that Steve, even in his saddened state, could feel those emotions radiating and transferring to him for just a fraction of a second.
"Boss," Friday's voice cut through the silence, "there seems to be a mass quantity of vehicles approaching the perimeter of the compound."
"Well, I'm still trying to calm down the PR fire after the whole Loki incident, and the DODC is still working on clearing and fixing up most of the damage. Other than that, the company is doing fine and I'd thought I'd stop by and see how you're doing."
"What did it say? Did it tell you where he was?" Natasha asked. Tony shook his head, scrubbing his hand up and down his face.
"No, no, and I
After everybody got suited up and made their way towards the Quinjet, the vehicle took off into the sky, Natasha and Clint wasting no time in putting the jet into maximum acceleration once all the heroes were inside. Steve had gathered them all around the meeting room table, all except for Tony who stayed off to the side, but he was within proximity to them so he could still hear. Even Natasha and Clint had joined them after they put the Quinjet in autopilot once they locked in their coordination, so now it was time for their Captain to formulate a plan.
"Things may have ended badly, or good, I don't really know how they ended with you and Pepper, but you're better than you tell yourself. You loved her and showed her how much you loved her, always put yourself on the line to make sure she was ok, and you always risked your life to protect her. Granted, dying isn't always the best to keep someone safe, but what do I know?" He gave a sad smile and shrugged. How could Tony really argue with that? The guy practically gave up his
"You're okay, right?" And he's more than okay. He's ecstatic that
"Uh... No, no I'm okay. I-I already ate." And he knew this was a lie because Tony always had this little gleam in his eye that Steve could see even from this distance. It was also close to his eye, a brief shimmer in his brown iris that he has come to not only love but also come to pick up as a sign whenever Tony wasn't telling the truth.
"And I've been missing a certain genius."
"Nothing," he shrugged as he answered.
"Tony? Tony! Great, just what I needed." Steve sighed. "Widow? Hawkeye? Do you read me? Anybody there? Guess I'm on my own." He let his shoulder sag in defeat as nobody was answering him. It was a bit creepy the way the lights flickered on and off, random groans of metal coming from around him, the way his footsteps were loud in his ear against the flooring. His nerves were on high alert, his heart speeding up in pace. His hands clenched and unclenched, a lump forming in his throat as he swallowed. Why was everything so quiet? Just then, the faintest sound of footsteps in the distance was heard, prompting him to grab his shield and throw it in that direction. Movement was heard, his shield returning to him, his eyes scanning the area around him.
"Someone really likes that, huh?" He saw Steve nod, and it widened his smirk. "Well, what if I did this?" He let his tongue lick the hard nub once more, but his right hand tweaked his other one, causing the soldier to arch once more, his erection grinding against Tony's again. It drove Tony crazy the way Steve always lost self-control because of him. He remembers how when they first started intimately touching each other, how hard it was for Steve to not fuck Tony right then and there, the way he growled and shivered, the way he pushed Tony up against the wall every time they kissed, the way Steve took control. Now the roles were reversed, and Tony was the one in control this time. He switched over to licking Steve's right nipple, tongue flicking against the hard nub and his fingers pinched and tweaked the other.
"Well, with that smile that says 'I just had a really great orgasm,' I have an idea." He giggled and rose from his knees, his body coming close to Steve's, pushing him back slightly so that he was resting on his back. Their lips came into contact with each other, Steve playfully biting Tony's bottom lip, eliciting moans and giggles from him. "I'd say we have to talk about your language, but it seems the super-soldier refractory period is kicking in." He said, grinding his front against Steves, making him moan.
"Look, I told you," he stared, getting off of his stool and making his way over to her, placing a hand gently on her shoulders, "I know what you did, and trust me, I hate that you did it. Nothing is the same anymore, but you went back for him. You could have left him there to die, and possibly that alone would have killed me, but you saved him so he could be here today. There's nothing I am more appreciative of than that."
I found myself back at home, and I remember this particular scene. My footsteps were loud in my ear, but the sobbing was even louder. I watched my younger self, knees up to his chest, head hidden and arms wrapped around himself, sitting next to an open door. I remember coming home and finding my mother was dead, tuberculosis finally got to her, and I... I sat here next to the open door, sobbing so hard it hurt my chest.
"Yes, Man of Iron?" The Asgardian replied.
"Then it's perfectly fine to be talking about this. As far as I'm concerned, nobody is stopping you from showing me your goods. Specifically your ass, but I wouldn't mind taking a gander at your dick either." As much as he was enjoying toying with the blushing soldier, there was a small voice in the back of his head that told him to stop what he was doing. He couldn't quite tell past the hands that were covering Steve's embarrassment, but he felt, or rather, he knew he was moving just a bit too fast, more so for the soldier's taste. "Sorry, I'm just joking, don't take it seriously. I don't wanna move too fast and make you uncomfortable."
"Do what? You mean this?" Another sound of pleasure escaped past his lips as the genius ground against him more, his hips slowly thrusting forward against him. Steve pulled him close, leaning his head to the side as Tony started to bite and lick his neck while he rutted against him. They barely registered the elevator ding that signaled their arrival onto Tony's floor, their mouths detaching from one another so Tony could quickly lead them to his room.
"Of course." The microwave beeped, signaling that the popcorn was done. Tony pulled the popcorn bag out of the microwave and Steve let go of him to allow Tony to grab a bowl and pour the content of the bag into the bowl, fresh buttery popcorn spilling forth. "Jarvis, put on Star Trek, please."
"That's very nice of you, although personally, I'd think it's weird to not even call me so I could at least look decent."
He was starting to get sick of seeing everybody look at him like he was crazy or about to explode; which to be fair he was going to, but not at any of them, no, at the man who sent his super-soldier on that dumbass mission. Well, if one more person looked at him he was going to snap at them, maybe it might make him feel better? Ok, who is he kidding, only yelling at Fury would make him feel better.
"Iron Man, do you copy!?" He heard a familiar voice in his ear.
"The timestamps are similar, same date, same time, but different places. So, there actually is another Fury running around here..." He whispered to himself. He watched as one Fury was talking with his teammates, and watched as the other Fury was talking to the field agent department. His ears picked up on the faint sound of Fury speaking in the footage.
There were many things Tony has heard in his lifetime, most of them regarding how much of a pain in the ass he could be, or things about him being a billionaire and a playboy, but never in his life would he ever hear, no
Suddenly, a bright light flickered right above him, finally letting him see the expanse of the room he was in.
depressed." His words came out more aggressive than he wanted to, causing the genius in front of him to raise his hands in surrender, his eyes widened in response as well. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice a little before speaking again. "Sorry, it's just... I'm sure I'm not depressed it's just..."
being around, or at the very least seeing him. He needs confirmation that Tony is okay because he won't be okay if he doesn't hear Tony's voice ever again.
"I do feel like I made the right choice."
"Yes, it might be surprising but Tony Stark does indeed have a heart."
"You thought what you wanted was revenge, so when you seized the opportunity, you took it. I understand where the anger came from, and trust me it makes me sick to my stomach to know what you did to him. But the fact you came back, to save someone so close to me, proves that you have a heart and that revenge wasn't the answer. You saved his life, and that's all I care about."
"Why thank you, sir. I try." He rolled his eyes at his creation's sass. Seriously, he doesn't remember ever programming Jarvis with this much sass before, but like creation like master, it wouldn't take long for the AI to pick up on his sass.
He was a human just like everyone else, regardless of his enhanced body, he was still flesh and bones, muscles and cartilage, organs and tissues. It didn't take away from the fact that he was still a man; a man who could still get hurt, who could still experience trauma. The serum can't fix emotional, nor psychological damage, it can only fix the physical. It heals bullet wounds, bruises, gashes, all of it regardless of it takes its time. A broken heart, shattered or manipulated mind, emotional stress? The serum can't fix that, only time can.
"What is it?" He heard Thor reply, his own voice lost in his throat.
"What? From who?" Tony asked, shocked.
"Either of you two know anything about what we're dealing with?" Wanda shook her head and was the first to speak.
"Thank you, Captain Rogers." Although Jarvis is nothing more than an AI Tony created, he swears there is a hint of happiness in his voice that he could faintly pick up.
"That's nice, J. Least one of us is worried about me." He stopped staring into space to look at the bottle gripped tightly in his closed fist, eyes squinted. With some ounce of strength left somewhere within him, he uncurled his fist from the bottle and let it sit there on the metal desk where he worked. "I can't do this." He muttered to himself. He rubbed his eyes with the back of his palms, working out some of the tiredness that lingered within them. He couldn't do this; there was no reason to succumb to the sinful succulence of an alcoholic beverage that knew him so well since they'd gotten acquainted over the years. There was no reason to suddenly give up all he's worked for just to drown his sorrows into a bottle. He was better than this, and he couldn't let himself down.
"As good as I'll ever be. Got any ideas on how we're gonna stop these things?" Steve questioned, looking at her.
"I do."
He always thought Tony was so beautiful, and at that moment he wanted to capture the genius's beauty in his sketchbook, that way he could always look back at the drawing and smile at the fact that his favorite person was in his sketchbook.
"You need to step out of this room for a bit." He looked at her with disbelief in his eyes, not really believing what she had just said to him. He shook his head and looked back at Tony, biting his lip.
"I thought people's views on homosexuality were the same as they were back then. People could be killed if anybody found out."
"S-Steve?" Tony called. His voice sounded so small and far away in his own ears. He took a step forward, and his heart utterly broke when he saw Steve flinch in response.
Once Tony paid for both of their meals, much to Steve's displeasure, they walked through the park back towards Stark tower. It was a peaceful walk through the park, walking side by side, Steve enjoying the sights mother nature had to offer; as if the park was the only thing untouched by time, and it made him happy to see that. Tony enjoyed the time he spent with Steve, which if he was honest with himself, he thought was going to be boring, but the soldier happily went along with whatever Tony wanted to do, which was a surprise for him.
"Hey, Steve. I have someone here who's been dying to see you?" Bruce smiled back, motioning with his hand to Tony. He watched as the soldier's eyebrows scrunched in confusion, but he continued to smile as he turned his head. That smile that was once splayed across his face, turned into a frown as he looked at Tony. His eyes conveyed fear, those beautiful blue eyes were trembling in fear as he gazed in Tony's direction, and it made the genius sick to his stomach. He shakily tried to reach out and touch the blonde, but it freaked him out more. He watched as Steve frantically got out of the stretcher, his body falling to the floor, taking some of the machines with it. The IV drips in his arms dislodged themselves as he moved away, the heart monitor giving a noisy flat-lined sound. Bruce was the first to move over to Steve as he continued to stare at Tony with complete terror in his eyes.
"No," he answered truthfully, "because one life isn't worth millions. If I didn't do what I did, everybody would've been dead. If I didn't do what I did," he paused for a second, a small, genuine smile splayed across his face, "you wouldn't be here." It was nice to see Tony smiling, as weird as it was for him to feel that way, but really who cares. It was different when he saw Peggys' smile, that's for sure, but right now he felt happy, and that's really what mattered to him. "Thank you for today, Anthony. I'm glad you were willing to show me around. Makes everything a little bit easier."
"Tony... What?" I looked at him, confusion written across my face. All he did was stand there and smile at me, it was unnerving, to say the least. "Why did you shoot me? Where am I?"
"I'm not his property, I'm a human being. Or is that how you see me?"
his chest that he was constantly reminded of, but it was a different feeling than the Arc Reactor. Past the humming noise and painful strands of muscle and tissue around the reactor, slithering and traversing downwards, even past the shrapnel in his heart, there was a feeling of happiness.
"Tony," Bruce's calm voice reached his ears, his gaze locking on the good doctor who had a small smile on his face, "we're Avengers. We get into dangerous situations all the time. They come after you, or any of us, they come after all of us. We're here for you, and we're gonna stay by your side. Trust us." He sighed and looked at his teammates. They stood there, eyes fixated on him, small smiles on their face. Bruce was right, they were in this together and the stress and anger Tony felt was slowly starting to dwindle.
"I say, if you want to make Steve happy Tony, then just let yourself be happy. That's the first step. You've already kissed, so maybe do something he likes to show him you're serious about this. Just don't hurt him again, because Bruce and the others won't be the only ones on your ass about hurting Steve." He couldn't help but chuckle at Pepper's words. Sweet, loveable Virginia Pepper Potts, always the one to make sure he got his shit together.
"Who's double agent?"
"Of course, sir. Is there anything specific you would like to see?"
"I'll be there as soon as possible." He ended the call without waiting to hear any more of what Fury had to say. His mind was only focused on one thing, and that was getting down to S.H.I.E.L.D. and hopefully getting answers, as well as teaching certain alien assholes not to fuck with the people Tony cares about.
"No, Steve," Tony cut him off, getting off his stool and walking close to him, "I don't want you going on this mission without me. I mean, what if something happens, huh? I can provide intel, backup, I can have JARVIS give you the in's and out's of the place, I can even-"
"Haha, very funny. But nothing is going on between me and Steve, so drop it."
"Poor Steve," Natasha says before taking a sip of her freshly made coffee. Tony hums in response, not really wanting to say much more about the subject. In fact, what could he say? Sure he could talk about how things have been rough for the super-soldier, or how traumatized he really is. The more he thought about it, the more his appetite seemed to disappear as he let out a heavy sigh and dropped his fork on his plate.
"Tony?"
He didn't know when it happened, but his hands found themselves cupping the side of Steve's face, his thumbs brushing over his cheeks. The soldier grabbed his wrists, his lips forming a small smile before kissing the palm of Tony's right hand. Tony leaned in and closed the distance, surprising Steve when their lips connected, but he kissed back, moving his hands to the geniuses hips, pulling him in so he was between his legs. Tony pulled back slowly, never taking his eyes off of those adorable blue ones staring back at him.
The doctor offers him just a slight brush of her hand on his cheek, and while the gesture isn't enough to stop the overflow of emotions within his body, it's just enough to reassure him that he can do this, that things could get better in the end. He watches her walk away from him, leaving him not only to his thoughts but to have his alone time with the person who might not even be able to speak to him.
"Well you've been working pretty hard, and I thought I'd do something nice for you." Steve took his own bite of his burger, and he has to admit, the flavors were so divine. He loved the way everything was cooked to perfection and the way his nose also ran due to the spice, the way the cheese melted in his mouth and mixed with the juicy flavor of the meat, he's glad he made the stop on the way back. "This just became my favorite burger place too."
"I know you're out there. There's no use hiding." He spoke calmly. His hands were clenched into fists, ready for the first sign of trouble that would start the fight, but instead, they unclenched as a familiar figure walked out of the shadows, his eyes softening as he rushed over.
As they got closer to the Triskelion, they could see the mass hoard of creatures running to and from the building. The geniuses' eyes were so focused on the streets and the building, that he didn't see the yellow beam of energy coming towards him until it was too late. His eyes widened as the beam got closer to him, he attempted to barrel to the left out of the beam's way, but he was too slow and it hit him square in his right shoulder. It destroyed the majority of the suit, cutting off power to Tony's right gauntlet, sending him into a teeter mid-air as he started to descend towards the ground.
"As much I agree with Clint," Natasha said, walking ahead of the two of them, "Cap's right, we were obviously sent here with a purpose. We should see what the root of this goose chase is about, find out what we need, bring it back to Fury, and find out all the details we can about this mission." She turned around and crossed her arms, a small smirk plastered on her face. "Any objections?"
"Absolutely."
The outside of the ring had said, the words resting above the silver band. He loved it, he absolutely loved the ring, and he for sure loved this man standing right in front of him, with the biggest, happiest, and most love-filled smile he's ever seen.
"Sir, I would recommend looking at your phone. It is quite... Catastrophic." The genius rushes over to grab his phone off the table, holding it at the edges with his thumb and pointer finger, and flicking out a news screen. They watched as people ran for their lives, screams echoing through the air, creatures bounding into the streets, some from the Triskelion and some towards the building. They watched as people were slaughtered where they stood. Blood spurting onto buildings, the streets, even the sidewalks, organs and intestines swallowed by these foul creatures, dismembered bodies were thrown off to the side and left there to potentially rot. Lumps forming in some of their throats. It was too much to watch and Tony turned off his phone and put it back in his pocket.
"You don't have to say anything, I know." And of course, she knows, because she's a spy. Hell, she's Fury's top spy, always knowing everything there is on a person, but he's grateful that she knows because she's always been one of his best friends. "Actually, we both know. Figured if I knew, you'd want Barnes over here to know, too." And he's ok with his first best friend knowing because they've been through so much together. He feels... Strangely happy with both of them know, and it gives him just a small ounce of confidence within himself to speak to them.
He manages to get at least a few hours of sleep, quiet, peaceful, undisturbed sleep, but that can only last for so long. He moves around in his sleep, ruffling the sheets, whimpering to himself, squeezing the pillow close to him so incredibly tight, the feathers inside the pillow threaten to burst out from their confinement. He broke out into a sweat, the culprit of his actions were the nightmares that continued to haunt him through the middle of the night. It's no wonder why he chooses not to sleep sometimes, that, mixed in with the fact the serum more than makes up for the lack of food, water, and sleep. It's hard for him to really relax in the middle of the night.
"Alright, let's get this over with." He pushes the door wide open, and in an instant there are guns pointed in his direction, scattered around the room. He holds up his hands in surrender. "No need to shoot guys." And before any of the steady, trained fingers on each gun can pull the trigger, he's the first one to shoot six missiles at each of their corresponding targets, watching them all convulse as their weapons drop and their bodies hit the floor. "Let me do the shooting instead." He quipped.
He threw the pillow back where he took it from, and let his head hang, eye glued towards the floor. It's easier to give up than it is to try, and all he wanted to do was give up and be done with the therapy, be done with trying, done with
The landing pad descended, and the top of the Raft started to fold inward, encasing them inside the island. Steve curled his hands into fists, which activated the collapsable vibranium Wakandan shields that T'Challa had made for him, while Bucky and Nat loaded their guns. The pad eventually reached the bottom, and they held their breaths for a few moments. Nat leaned over and pressed the button for the Quinjets door to slowly open. They walked forward, tense and quiet as the interior of the Raft came into view.
"I cannot answer that for you. Only you can decide whether you made the right choice or not. If I may ask, do you feel like you did, sir?" This really was the question that needed to be answered. Did he make the right choice? He could argue that he didn't, that this was a bad idea, that this was going to end just like the whole Pepper situation. Although, this wasn't like Pepper. He and Steve both lived dangerous lives, but they could look out for each other when things got bad. With Steve's loyalty, Tony knew that if anything bad happened to him, Steve would scourge the ends of the earth to make sure he was safe. It was easier to look out for someone who was also a superhero, but what if his insecurities got the best of him? Steve deserved better than someone like him, the man deserved someone
"You're right, I should." The sound of the gun went off and he flinched, a whimper of fear making its way out of his mouth. He felt no pain, and he slowly came to realize that it was a warning shot that was fired in a different direction of the room. "Now, as much as I should kill you, I think it's only fair to throw you a bone."
He decided to do something he hoped he wouldn't regret, hoping that it would put the soldier's mind at ease. He exited his lab, feet traversing the cold, shiny metal titles that shone just a tad bit brighter thanks to the moonlight beams littering through the window. Soon the silver tiles turned more wooden, brown in color with a sort of caramel coating. The debriefing room came into view, with all its vast furniture and the big black oval-shaped table reserved for debriefings, as well as the kitchen that connected to it. He made his way towards the back of the room where the Avengers living quarters were stationed. He made his way past Natasha's room, taking a shaky breath as his hand curled around a circular doorknob.
"Ms. Romanoff is requesting access to enter your lab." Oh fuck, he must've messed up big time if Natasha was coming down here. What was the Black Widow going to do to him? Well for starters she would probably kick his ass for his stupidity, or maybe she won't waste any time to kill him right here and now by just shooting him. He shuddered at the mere thought of Natasha coming in here and wiping him off the face of the Earth, but if he sat here any longer and she continued to wait outside the door, his chances of survival and pleading for his life were slim to none.
"You never look decent, Tony."
"Trust me, I'll tell you if you're hurting me."
"Yes. Oh, god, please fuck me, Steve. I can't take it." He wasn't lying either, the teasing was turning him on and he really wanted, no, he
After the shopping mall, Tony decided to do something less extravagant. A simple walk down the street towards his favorite Italian restaurant would suffice. He watched as the super soldier's eyes roved the sidewalks, watched as the cars passed by, the wind jostling his hair in different directions, if anything he thought Steve was having fun, or rather, he was excited. He happily let Steve hit his arm a few times and let him talk about the old days from 1940's Brooklyn, where the movies theaters used to be dance halls, and all the fancy restaurants used to be a place where you could drive your car, park in the parking lot and just relax with your friends while listening to classical music and rollerblading. There was a small warmth flowing through Tony's chest at how giddy Steve was, but he wouldn't say out loud just how adorable he thought the blonde was, no those feelings wouldn't be brought up anytime soon, or so he hoped.
Even after the Quinjet made it back to Wakanda he still did not put him down. He continued to carry him bridal style up until they reached the facility. T'Challa welcomed them back and was concerned about each and everyone one of them. For Tony, it was hard for him to tell T'Challa that Ross broke his fingers, because not only did he remember the sound of his bones breaking, as well as the immense pain he suffered through and the acidic burn of bile in his throat, but more so because he couldn't imagine himself not inventing. He didn't want to admit that he might not be able to fix or upgrade the team's suits, but that wasn't as important as the thought of not being able to hold Steve's hand.
to talk to him, that he was finally able to maybe want to move past this with him. It was that trust he had- no, it was the
"It's ok to admit that you miss me even if it hasn't been a day yet. When I'm coming home exactly, Fury hasn't really told me when I'd be back, so I cannot give you the answer to that. I'm sorry."
The two talked for hours, thankfully undisturbed, otherwise Tony swore he was going to lose it if his Steve time got interrupted. In the time given to them, Tony had decided that maybe if he was going to accept that the soldier felt something for him, it would be better to talk about it when he got back, rather than doing it like this. It would be a conversation he most likely wouldn't ever be prepared for; even if he didn't know when Steve was going to be back and that gave him either a lot or a little bit of time to think about what he wanted to say, emotional conversations were still something he preferred to stay away from. If it was for Steve, then he would be willing to compromise.
While the words "I love you" are typically said between a couple, and generally in the simplest terms means exactly what it says, the words themselves hold a special power. The simple phrase of "I love you" when said to a friend is much different from that of when said to a lover; for that which saying those words to a friend can mean a simple "thank you", or a "words cannot express how much you mean to me". In the context of saying it to a significant other, they are those most beautiful sets of words in a sentence someone can say. "I love you" is in the context of "you are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with", or rather "there's no one else but you". This is what it means to him because love is very different for everyone and it cannot be the same for everyone. Everyone's definition of love is different, and for him, it comes with knowing that your heartbeat so quickly for one person, and your palms get sweaty, you find yourself nervous and stutter a lot- which is ironic because he actually has a condition that makes him stutter- and you generally want to get to know this person more. He never thought that after Peggy, someone who he did indeed have feelings for and loved deeply, despite not ever saying the words to her, that he would ever find love with anyone else.
Realistically he never stopped loving Steve, but it was easier to put up all the walls he built and the mask over his face, replacing any feeling of love he had for this man with hatred; pure, righteous, roaring flame-like hatred that coursed so heavily in his veins. But he never killed that emotion completely, it was just hiding away deep down in his bruised heart, crying for attention like a lost puppy, or a child needing attention and someone to care for it. The love was still there, it was just smothered by the hatred.
"Jarvis said you were having a nightmare, a pretty bad one it looks like." He doesn't move, nor does he speak as the genius runs a hand over his damp forehead, fingers getting lost in his blonde locks. The touch makes his eyes flutter for a moment, a warm feeling courses through his vein at the sweet, comforting form of contact Tony gives him. He watches as the genius stands and says, "I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get you some water." His hand shoots out, quicker than lighting, halting the Iron Man from leaving his room.
"Steve," she said softly, "I'm not asking you to stay away for the whole day, but you
"Yes, boss." The female AI replied. He patiently waited, but to himself, he didn't know whether he was waiting minutes or hours. It all just felt too long, and he feared that if he waited any longer, Steve would be dead- if he wasn't already, that is. "His heartbeat is weak. He's lost a lot of blood and is continuing to lose more as we speak. If he doesn't get medical attention within the next few hours, he'll die."
Natasha, Clint, and Steve nodded to each other, exploring the interior of the bunker. It was old and worn down, cobwebs literally the expanse of the walls, moldy walls with chipped paint crossing their eyesight as they moved down every corridor, doors creaking under the weight of finally being used, it was like an old facility that Hydra used back in the day, or rather, they stopped using it. As they got further into the bunker, they decided to cover more ground by splitting up.
"Where is he, Stark!?" Ross demanded.
"Well, I overheard your little conversation with Steve-".
tony to look at him; acknowledge him as the person that he is, rather than the criminal persona that he is making him out to be, because by heart he is not a criminal, he's just a man who tried to do the right thing, but ended up being branded a criminal by the other side. The genius coughed, clearing his throat and biting his lip before speaking.
"Oh, so you didn't have a choice in telling me your
He doesn't know who made the first moaning sound, whether it was him or Tony, it didn't matter, the kiss was amazing. He licked the brunette's lip, asking for entrance which was happily given to him shortly after. This was a new experience to him, and oh boy did he like the way their tongues danced for control. He pulled back a few minutes later once the need for air arose, their forehead resting against each other, smiles on both of their faces.
get some sleep. But it was weird to be the one left alone in bed this time. He thought he was going to wake up and still see the sleeping form of Steve, his blonde hair all messy due to Tony running his fingers through it, it was a sight to see, and he really wanted to see it, but sadly the blonde isn't here at the moment.
"No," Tony said firmly, "Steve's too damn stubborn to die, he's gonna keep fighting." He stared down at his coffee cup, knowing that it was the Captain's stubbornness that was going to get him killed, or even worse, damaged beyond repair. Tony wasn't ready for that, he didn't want Steve to come home damaged and broken, it would tear him apart. He felt a hand gently run through his brown curly locks, effectively calming him down. He leaned into the comforting gesture and raised his head, looking at Natasha, the corner of her lips curved upward in a small half-smile.
"Alright, now how about we get you into your room. Sleeping on the floor, or rather in the hallway, not as comfortable as it sounds."
he will not apologize for saving his best friend. It might seem shallow, and something that he should apologize for, and whether it be due to his own stubbornness and pride, saving Bucky was something he had the opportunity to do all over again, and this time he had succeeded.
He didn't say anything, because once again what was there to say? A simple "I'm sorry" would set Tony off, and while he absolutely wanted to tell the man those exact words, he withheld them. Instead, he just sat there staring right back at him, taking in his posture and how stiff it was; as if Steve were nothing more than a mere stranger to him, or he really didn't want to be in here talking to him. It actually hurt Steve more than he was willing to show, and it was only then that he looked away in fear that if he kept staring at Tony, he would see the vulnerability again and use that to his advantage. In a way he was like the ocean; a glistening surface where you could see all the innocent little things, while deep down it was hiding away all the nasty dark things it didn't want you to see. The surface was the light, the shallow end, while further out and down, was the darkness. Steve's eyes were the window into that darkness, because if just for a fraction of a second if his emotions gained control over his strong, steely resolve he worked so hard to maintain, one simple glance could reveal all he was hiding. All the ugly, nasty things he kept to himself were brought forth to the surface, things that no human should ever have to see.
"Help!" A voice responded, louder and clearer. "Someone, please help!" He raced towards the voice, not caring if his teammates were following behind. His footsteps were clumsy, he tripped on occasions but he pressed on. The voice was getting louder, more clear as he pushed through the snow. Finally, he saw it. He saw two figures in the snow, one of them belonging to his lover, and the other a woman with chestnut brown hair. His head rested in her lap, her hands gently slapping his cheek.
"But you want to accept that fact he feels something for you, or you want to accept that you feel something for him?" He nodded his head and he swears he's an open book for Bruce to just read, and he hates the fact that when he gets emotional, which is very rare, that it's so easy for someone to just pick out how he's feeling. Years spent perfecting a persona and letting the world see only what he wanted them to see, only for it to crumble around the face of those he's willing to let it, he hates emotions because it makes him feel weak. You can thank his dad for that one, because "Stark men are made of Iron," used to be the shit his father told him whenever the asshole would hand him a hot piece of metal and he would drop and cry about how it burned his hands.
"We leave in about a few hours, I suggest getting ready and doing whatever you want until then. I'm sorry, but it's already decided." He sighed and nodded his head, but as he looked at her, he realized her eyes weren't focused on him, instead, she was looking past him. He turned his head and his heart dropped. He saw Tony, standing there with a frown on his face. He heard footsteps disappear behind him, signaling that Natasha left.
"I j-just l-love y-you so mu-much." He stutters. The words are true as he speaks them because he loves this man
"Actually can I... Can I sleep with you instead? It gets lonely and... I don't wanna be alone." He noticed a hand in front of his face, and as he looked up, a warm smile plastered on the face of the genius.
"You can't expect me to suddenly just leave him after this long of staying here!" He yelled. She stayed silent, an emotionless expression on her face as she let him speak. "You don't know what it's like when the person who gave you everything: a home, a life,
"Y-yeah it's working r-really w-well. Uhm..." He bit his lip and remembered what Tony said about him and T'Challa discussing plans to change the accords. "W-Where is T-Tony?"
He thought that maybe it was a sign that Tony was ready to talk when he called him from the flip phone he gave him. But alas, it was nothing but a trap.
"Nah, no problem here. I'm cool with it. Nat and I are just having a bet when you two will get together."
"Yes?"
When he opened his eyes again, the cave was gone, replaced by fancy furniture, glass windows next to a cliffside view of the ocean, a liquor cabinet harboring every bottle of whiskey, scotch, tequila, just about every alcoholic bottle you could name sitting in the cabinet behind the glass door, a fireplace, wooden tiled flooring, makeshift kitchen a few feet away from the liquor cabinet and a spiral staircase that lead to the upper part of the building. He was back home, in his mansion, late in the middle of the night. He remembers what happens next.
be Anthony. My name is
"It's hard adjusting to a new life, right?" He nodded his head and turned his gaze towards the waitress, smiling at her as she greeted them kindly. They placed their orders, and soon enough, she was on her way. Steve turned his head to look at Tony again, noticing the small smile on his face.
you. I haven't been the best at showing it, and I know I said we'll get through this together and I mean it! I'm not going to do what I've been doing these past five days, I really wanna do this together, I promise."
"What's going on in that pretty little head of yours, Stark?" Clint's soft voice reached his ears. He moved back and let himself lay sideways on the stretcher, staring at the empty one across from him that Nat was brought on earlier in the day. He didn't want to tell them what was going on inside his head, it was nothing but chaos going on in there. He groaned in frustration and clicked his teeth, frustration turning into irritation as he let out an angry huff of breath. His foot started to shake a little bit and his eyes started scanning the room, looking at anything except his teammates.
Steve's face was tainted with blood; trickling down from his nostrils, the skin on the bridge of his nose torn and cracked, loose skin hanging off by a few inches, a deep gash on his forehead, and he could faintly see glass shards embedded in his skin. He saw the small pool of blood around his hair, staining his blonde locks the shade of crimson. He trembled as he reached out to touch the soldier, wanting to feel for any sign of life in him, but he was too shocked to will his hands steady as he just continued to look at him.
"That means a lot to me, Tony, thank you. If I may ask, what brought about this sudden urge to apologize?"
That was a good question. Just what was the
They held each other for who knows how long, but truthfully Tony didn't care. He continued to hold Steve as his lover held him close, soft sobs escaping past his lips. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Wanda, standing there with a smile on her face, which in return, caused his smile to widen. The only thing Tony could really care about, despite all the bad things that have transpired so far, was the fact that he was getting his super-soldier back, slowly but surely.
"We were attacked," she said simply, "I don't know what they were, but they appear to take on human appearances to mess with the minds of those they come into contact with. You let your guard down for one minute, and the next thing you know..." She trailed off, but she didn't need to finish her sentence for him to understand. He hummed in response and stared at the ceiling.
"Steve!"
"Look if you're not gonna say anything, just know that breakfast is ready." It was then that he wasted no more time and stood up, causing Tony to flinch. He frowned for a second, but he pushed away from the fleeting sadness that tried to claw at him, making his way out of the door and into the hallway. He waited for Tony to close the door before the genius started to lead him down the weird curved hallway, familiar steel beams that had just enough space between them for him to see the rays of the afternoon sun beaming down on the great grassy yard outside. And suddenly, it made sense where he was.
"I'm glad to know that something good has come from the world since I went under. It doesn't matter who you love, really, as long as you're happy." There was that smile again that just warmed something inside Tony's chest. Was it the Arc Reactor? No, that thing was still cold vibranium, it was more likely his heart, the small, gentle caress of a hand over his heart, the way its palm was placed ever so carefully over the beating organ, radiating nothing but goodness and tranquility over it- God, since when did he become such a sap.
The silence in the room seemed to drag on, minus the heart monitor that was alerting him that Clint was still alive. He sipped his coffee and just stared at the end of Natasha's stretcher, his courage to ask what happened at the bunker slowly fleeting. He needed answers, but was he really about to put stress on Nat to make her remember everything that happened?
He remembers it so vividly; the feel of the cold barrel against his skull, and how steady his finger was as he looked at himself in the mirror, willing to put an end to his suffering. But he didn't do it. Why? Because he still kept going, kept believing that one day the genius would call him and that everything would be right. He kept having the faith in his heart, swirled in with love that created this beautiful portrait of love and anguish; hues of pink and orange, with a dash of black and red, and it was a complete mess, but to him it was beautiful.
"As you wish, sir." Tony and Steve happily placed themselves on the couch as Jarvis put the movie on, no space between them as they sat close to each other, hands already reaching into the bowl and digging into the popcorn. Occasionally their hands would touch and they would smile, a small chuckle also escaping from both of them. Steve put his arm around Tony as the beginning of the movie started playing, the two of them relaxing, perfectly comfortable, and having a nice time next to each other.
"Yes, we can easily take care of ourselves, but this is Hydra we're speaking of. Considering you and your history with them, Fury thought-"
It was like a whirlwind of anger had seeped into S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, and it came in the form of one
His eyes were fluttering close, the loss of too much blood catching up to him. The world was lost behind his eyelids, darkness encasing the image of the Raft, while his ears picked up a few sounds in the distance. What Steve might describe as an alarm, but soon the alarm was replaced by a buzzing sound, which soon turned into static white noise.
"So, who asked who out?" Clint suddenly asked.
Before he knows it he reaches the door and the wall slides sideways, revealing the metal door behind it. He touches the cold metal knob, hand resting there. He sighs heavily before carefully, ever so slowly pushing the door open.
"Please," he says, voice barely above a whisper, "please don't leave. Can't I just... Can I come into your lab and just... Sleep there?" It was a pleading gesture, and he mentally kicked himself for that. It was bad enough the loneliness continued to fester in his chest, brewing and bubbling something so wicked he felt as if he was losing his sensibility, his sanity, too. He scowled more at himself than anything, but it slowly disappeared from his face as he saw the small half-smile on the geniuses face.
"I see you can at least get out of bed," came the monotonous reply, followed by a judgemental gaze up and down his body, "as for being able to stand on your own two feet, not so much."
He sighed to himself, running a hand down his face, biting his lip just shortly after returning the appendage in its place at the side of his body. Regardless of his own stubbornness, or wanting to stay as far away from the blonde as possible, he wouldn't be able to sleep tonight knowing that he had caused the other male tremendous amounts of emotional, and psychological pain.
"I gotta say, Stark here really played his part perfectly." Tony whimpered inside his cell and shook his head, looking deep into Steve's blue eyes.
"There are some things I wish I didn't know." It was the change in her voice that made him slightly stiffen, as well as the way her lips formed into a straight line. "Steve... He got real low one time and Uhm... He held a gun to his head and was contemplating ending it. He waited so many months, so many days for you to call. In a way, you saved him, by calling him, even if it was just to hand him over to Ross. So, I would think about that and go talk to him."
"How do you plan on doing that when you're at gunpoint?" He growled in frustration, realizing the creature was right. He couldn't do anything right now, he was in a life or death situation. "It's funny really, we, or rather
He's angry with Tony, but he's angry at himself for believing in the genius that this was something they were going to get through together. He's angry with himself that he thinks that because he's still in love and thinks it's hypocritical of him to be angry with Tony considering he said the same words that he did, and he left him on the cold, hard floor back in Siberia. He's angry that he has no confidence in himself anymore, because what's a leader without his voice or his eyesight to be able to guide his team, let alone have a civil life where he's allowed to relax and draw and speak sweet words into his lover's ear. And yet, he's lost those privileges; he's lost the privilege to see clearly, lost the privilege to speak, lost the privilege to speak to his lover, and it eats away at him every day.
"Yes?" He responded.
"You look like shit, too." Tony joked. Clint groaned as pain coursed through his body, a hand gently pushing him back down as he tried to sit up properly.
"So, I was wondering if you..." He trailed off, his eyes maneuvering their way across the little bit of Steve's body he could see. He has to admit, the super-soldier was fit; muscular chest, a hint of abs he could run his fingers up and down on, Steve was just breathing sex by just standing there.
to someone plead for their life. Don't end up like me Steve, it's a cold and dangerous path. For what it's worth, Tony will wake up." With that, she left the room.
some evil alien asshole to threaten to take over earth, or plan on wiping out half of all life on Earth, just something to disturb the quietness that is New York.
He sits down on the familiar blue cushioned bench he remembers from when Steve first went to his therapy session. He remembers being so proud that Steve was doing this, and he looked so happy when he saw him sitting there waiting for him. It even brought a smile to his own face as he sat there and remembered the days that passed after that one.
"They're called Axelons, shapeshifters that take on the forms of those we care about and lure into a false sense of security." Thor started.
Before he knew it, the elevator dinged, signaling its arrival towards his destination. He stepped inside and everything was just as he left it, all except for the currently awake super-soldier on the couch. He smiled at the sight of Steve's messy hair swept in different directions, the only indication that he might have just woken up.
"I know, but if it makes you happy then I must be doing something right."
"Yes, sir." He kissed Tony again, a small peck this time instead of a full-blown kiss. He got off the bed and grabbed both the mug and the plate, making his way over to the door. "I'll be right back. Gonna go put the dishes away."
"Secretary Ross." Steve's breath hitch, and looked at Tony in fear. The genius didn't meet his eyes at first, instead, he got off of the stool he sat on, making his way towards the large entrance in the front of the compound.
Steve was so trusting, willing to hope and pray and accept that Tony
He tapped the nanoreactor, making the nanites shrink and retract inside the reactor. He walked over towards one of the terminals, pulling up footage from about a month ago while he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a flash drive. "I want it all Friday; all the footage from Steve's capture and any file you can dig up on Ross, as well as a digital copy of those accords."
"What if you get inside my head, and show Cap what I'm most terrified of. I'm sure if he sees how much I truly care about him, how scared I am of losing him, that he might be willing to at least see me eye to eye and work on this instead of avoiding me." Wanda nodded her head slowly, taking in every word he said. It made sense really; when she brought forth Steve's fear of him being weak, they were suppressed memories, things he didn't want himself or anybody else to see. Of course, they didn't include Tony, because she made him relive memories, she didn't alter his mind in any way, she simply pulled forth things already stored in his brain. If she were to use her powers to make Steve see into the mind of Tony and what he was scared of, then it might just get him to open up a little.
Steve walked over to him, drawing the attention span of the brunette once more. He placed his hands on either side of Tony's face, cupping his cheeks in his hands. "You gonna be ok?" He asked sincerely.
"What's going on?" Steve questioned.
He did everything he could try and lose the enemy behind him, working with the damaged Quinjet as much as he could. For a second he thought he was going to be okay, that he could do this because his motto was: "I can do this all day." And he believed that he was going to make it out of this, but it all went downhill as the second wing broke off, damaged by one of the missiles that got lucky enough to hit its mark.
He could see a body laying on the floor, back turned towards him. He heard the glass shards crunch under his feet as he made his way over towards the blonde. He had hoped whatever injuries he suffered weren't too bad and that they could be easily fixable, or the serum would be able to heal it within no time. However, the sight made him just a little nauseous.
"Like Stark is the luckiest man alive." She replied. He blushed a little bit but smiled again nonetheless. Truthfully, he felt that he himself was the lucky one rather than Tony. He felt the genius could have anybody he wanted, and he chose him; someone who's no more than just a kid from Brooklyn who got lucky, in his own words. "He's waiting for you. I wouldn't keep him waiting if I were you."
right in front of him. The shock wore off as quickly as it came because right now, was no time to be thinking too hard about what to say. He just needed to speak, keep him and Steve preoccupied until help arrived. He could do that, he was Tony Stark, talking was his specialty.
It was for just this moment that he forgot about all the hate he harbored for this man; this beautiful, blonde, muscular, strong yet so gentle, man he had come to love for the majority of his life. He didn't see the fugitive that had betrayed him, left him to die in a cold, arctic tundra in Siberia, abandoned him for his best friend, he didn't see any of that. He just saw Steve. The man out of time, the guy who time and time again was always there with Tony; holding him close in the night, whispering sweet nothings in his ear after a nightmare, always bringing him coffee, or food in his lab when he forgot. He just saw his super-soldier. He just saw his
