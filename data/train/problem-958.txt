She seems to enjoy listening to my tales about you, which I discovered while she helped Mrs. Hudson and I clean 221B. I kept your violin, by the way. Mary said Mycroft would have taken it already if he wanted it, and that it would be nice to remember you by something you obviously used to love.
Or you would, would you still be here. Wouldn’t even need me to be present for this conversation, probably. No, of course not. You’d just fill in my words before I could utter a single one of them, and they would be perfect. You’d know exactly what I mean to say.
There is silence after that, not the comfortable kind, and I dig my fingers into the armrest between my thighs to keep them from twitching. Sherlock notices the movement – of course he does – his eyes finally leaving mine, and I’m not sure I like that but breathing just got a lot less complicated so I don’t complain. His head tilts in a way that is usually followed by a rapid stream of deductions and people getting offended left and right, and yet what comes out of his mouth next is too short to fit that pattern.
“I’m here as your doctor, nothing more! I’m not going to leave if you offend me – I’m going to leave when you’re
The pub comes alive with a roar the moment the ball passes the goal line, and Greg claps me on the back with a hearty shout, making me splash the table with beer as I stumble forward a bit from the force. He doesn’t apologize and we grin at each other madly, and for a moment things feel almost… good. Normal.
Faulty hunch as it may be, I find myself still staring at my ceiling when sunshine starts slipping through the edges of the blinds, and decide that there are, indeed, worse things than good burgers.
“That…” John’s fingers abandon my head as he steps around my chair, and my head turns to the left on instinct. He’s left handed – it stands to reason he would throw a punch with his dominant hand. Easier to turn with a hit if it doesn’t come directly from—
The weight of Mrs. Hudson’s stare settles over me with all the delicacy of a freight train, but I feel the corners of my eyes lift in a smile despite feeling like the single greatest disappointment in the history of mankind. God, how self-absorbed I must have been to worry her at such depth.
I can’t suppress the smile at that statement, because if John is able to make light of shooting not-nice men then he might be persuaded to shoot more not-nice men in the future, which would be… convenient? No, that’s not the word. Ideal, perhaps. Delightful. Brilliant. Luminous.
Thankfully the discussion is cut short when the D.I.’s mobile beeps, and he hisses a curse under his breath when he opens the text.
“Good.” Cue throat clearing. “Don’t forget to get that sutured properly,” he gestures towards my head, “and get an X-ray while you’re at it.”
I lean in and reach for her frame blindly, manage to push a kiss against her shoulder, and my smile turns a tad more genuine against her skin. I love how she always seems to smell of strawberries. “Go back to sleep,” I say and she hums in approval, already settling back against my chest.
Greg punched me in the face. One minute we’re watching a game in a pub in peace and relative quiet, and the next I’m clutching at my bloodied nose and we’re being ushered outside by the staff.
, so it works. I have to throw in a few more lines about catching him a serial killer and being in shock, but it works, and soon I’m standing right in front of John, giddy with adrenaline and vibrating with energy because John just killed a man for me and I
start paying attention to the way Sherlock’s right shoulder seems to sit lower than the other when the screen switches to a newscaster with blonde hair and startlingly pink lipstick, but her lips are moving too fast and how dare she take over the screen when I needed just a little more time, just one more minute with Sherlock, and why is it always, always pink when it comes to—
Greg took my scarf (your scarf) and told me (screamed at me) that I had to stop waiting for you to come back, that I’m not being fair to myself, to Mary, to you. In my defense, I didn’t realize I was doing it.
“I can’t just pour superglue onto a gash,” John is laughing again. “It’s quite toxic, people shouldn’t be doing this all the damn time. No, I’m only putting it on your roots, the braids will keep the wound closed. This would need at least five stiches normally, you know.
I grit my teeth as I overbalance and diffraction artifacts start to appear in the image, light halos obscuring the sickle cells Molly was kind enough to provide for a quick study, as long as none of them leaves the building with me. The fulfillment of that request is still up to debate.
There’s a smile in his voice but it’s not the mocking kind – it’s more like the ‘you poor sod, I wouldn’t want to be in your place’ kind, which levels my initial alarm into something more manageable. He simply doesn’t know the full story of what happened last Friday, that’s all. He wasn’t there when I took the screwdriver over to the Yard, Sally didn’t feel inclined to ask any questions, and my text to Greg contained very little information besides the fact that I will be delivering the evidence instead of the usual consulting detective.
Lestrade squints at the blurry picture before appraising me with a questioning look, finally realizing the photo was not included in any of the folders he gave me. Good.
I glance at the nightstand guiltily before I kiss her, knowing all too well what lies in the outbox of my text messages.
Mycroft invited me over to his home (palace? secret agency building? torture dungeon?) for dinner on Saturday. Well, me and Mary technically, but there’s no way I’m subjecting her to the more psychotic one of the Holmes brothers – no offense.
I can’t decide whether a handshake would be welcome by the standoffish detective so I offer what I’m hoping is an equally detached nod and a “Mr. Holmes” instead, but when I turn around after grabbing my cane there is a bony hand extended in my direction, and I’m sure there’s no masking the surprise that must be written on my face.
I’m sorry for that message the other day. Not that you read it, or will ever read it, but still. It was uncalled for.
“Mrs. Hudson!” I bellow when I shut the front door after arriving home, hoping this weekend is not the weekend when she’s visiting her sister. “Tea!”
The expression lighting up her face is honest and raw and more than a bit teary, but if her crushing hug is any indication, it’s far from a bad one.
“You’re not using your cane,” he says almost to himself, and I look at the offending item resting against the chair, within easy reach.
John glares again. His frown lines will become permanent rather quickly, at this rate. Not that they are unattractive.
Lestrade. Lestrade comes to Baker Street around noon, doesn’t find me there. Mrs. Hudson informs me as soon as I climb down from the roof, hours later, having figured out that ‘Rachel’ serves as a password for the victim’s find-my-phone account. Sentiment, probably.
him to disagree, to fight for his truth, but his frown turns conflicted – he’s reluctant, and the quite ‘okay’ he breathes after some hesitation feels like defeat.
“So—” is as far as I get however, because Sherlock goes on like he’s deaf to my voice, and my feelings about the situation decidedly take a sharp turn towards anger now.
I’m right! What was I even thinking, asking some random stranger in a pub to stitch up a head wound? I might need to go to the A&E, after all. I hope the morbidly obese nurse is not on duty – she keeps trying to pet my hair every time I’m there, like I’m in
I swallow a strange mixture of blood tinged saliva and the insistent urge to scream, and make my way deeper into the apartment. I recognize my destination only when the back of my thighs hit one padded arm of a chair – my old chair – and I lower myself onto the armrest in a nauseating daze I haven’t experienced since—
“Can’t say I have,” his smile is evident in his voice again. “The worst I had to make do with was dental floss... Aaand we’re done.”
A single, pale peach colored rose is laying on the desk, no vase – woman around John’s age, possible coworker, second date. No great attachment, at least not yet.
“Perhaps,” I say by way of goodbye, having no intention to take part in these outings despite the vague agreement, and John seems to know this. Good.
tears his gaze away from me with a light gasp, shoulders hunching up like a child caught with a hand in the cookie jar. His cheeks gain a reddish tint. Shame. At staring or at being caught? He didn’t seem bothered by me staring right back a second ago. Clears his throat. Deep breath, shoulders straighten again. Ah. Reflexive reaction then, conscious effort to stifle. Homophobic parent.
A white piece of plaster is pressed onto the skin above Sherlock’s shoulder, and the blond man starts to gather his supplies from the coffee table before I can start translating my thoughts into spoken words.
Sherlock is on his feet before I have a chance to properly take in the sight of him, but a strong hand appears on his chest, pushing him back down onto the sofa, and for a moment I’m blinded with panic because his inhuman noise of protest reverberates in my bones and dear God I
Also, I kind of want to punch you in the face for missing my wedding, among other things. But mainly I’m just going to miss you.
Then I spend the next ten minutes dry heaving over the kitchen sink while I wait for him to get into the tub.
I dim the display of my cellphone in a haste, mostly to hide the expression I know must be present on my face, but it’s too late. I catch a glimpse of the furrow of her brows before I put the phone on the nightstand: she’s concerned.
“No, it’s fine, go ahead,” I offer easily, knowing very well how important Greg’s job is. I wish I could stop being jealous over such a job every time he’s called in for a new case. “Is it a suicide again?” I do my best to keep the overt curiosity out of my voice, but Greg is too occupied with typing out a reply to notice anyway.
“I gave it to him,” he says, pushing his pint away as he studies the picture for clues he is not going to find without my guidance. “Cold case. What of it, Sherlock?”
“Did he, really?” Greg’s stare gains a new kind of suspicion, the kind that I’ve been trying to avoid all along, and I can’t help but straighten my spine a bit under his evaluating gaze. “You know, Sherlock is not… he doesn’t usually take to—“
“You haven’t unpacked,” I offer with what I hope comes across as a measure of indifference, but there’s no hiding from Sherlock’s stare – he must see the way I keep brushing my palms against my jeans to rid them of sweat.
, but Sherlock seems to understand because he doesn’t stop coming closer. My hands are flattened to the wall by my thighs, not daring to move an inch lest they startle Sherlock into retreat, but his gaze focuses on my mouth as he lick his lips, that beautiful arch of his Cupid’s bow glistening in the low light, and he’s ducking his head now, nearly there, closing the gap as he says:
I don’t bother waiting to see if she manages to stifle the very small, very contained fire in the sink that is currently being fueled by Mycroft’s ever so gracious
If it’s suddenly more uncomfortable to look anywhere near Sherlock when I have my fingers buried in his slowly re-growing locks and battling with shampoo that still refuses to produce enough lather, it’s definitely not because of the oppressive silence gaining a different tang than before.
The surrounding tables go silent at Donovan’s screech, pints momentarily forgotten in favor of morbid curiosity as I push the aforementioned photograph under Lestrade’s nose. To his slight credit the D.I. doesn’t bat an eyelash at my unexpected arrival, he simply moves an arm around the piece of paper to shield it from view and sends a glare at the room at large – a silent command to the masses to mind their own business. It’s disappointingly ineffective.
Yeah, because it won’t be awkward to start talking about bees out of the blue after three weeks of total, near stifling silence.
“Okay,” he breathes, but he must notice my incredulity because the next moment he clears his throat and steals his features into something closer to what I learnt to associate with him. “That’s… good.” He rests his arms on his knees and relaxes back into the cushions, but somehow he still fails to capture the aloofness that used to come to him so effortlessly.
John laughs at this, and his laugh is almost nice enough that I forgive him for looking at me like I’m the idiot here. Almost.
We hope we can still count on your participation on this much awaited event – please, kindly let us know if you can attend.
He stops speaking every few minutes while sitting in the tub, stealing a glance at my expression from the corner of his eye, but a small nod or a question is always enough to get him back into lecturer’s mode, even if only for a short burst before the next minute gap.
John sends a nervous glance to the Yarders busying themselves with the crime scene, gulps audibly, then directs those dark blue eyes back to me, like he’s afraid
“Your phone. It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you couldn’t afford it, not on your army pension. It has scratches. Not one, but many over time. Been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man on the verge of being evicted from his bedsit—“ shouldn’t have said that, too late, “wouldn’t treat his one luxury item like this, so it’s had a previous owner. A gift, then. Next bit’s easy. You know it already.”
Oh, that’s clever John, very clever! The redhead waiter will think John is an inspector of some kind. The kind that inspects restaurants for… regulations. There is a term for that. I likely keep it in the attic though, with the rest of the drivel.
Perhaps civilian life is not going to be as horrible as I imagined. As I still imagine it to be, if I’m honest.
“Not usually, no. But it’s easy enough to get rid of at the right stage, if you want to give forensics a run for their money. The killer might have missed a spot.”
“Not as bad as you might imagine,” I force a laugh, “he was pretty out of it, actually. Kept talking in circles about… chemistry, mostly. Bees. He knows a lot about football, none of which is useful to the actual game, but still.”
The shriek of the doorbell pulls me back into reality with a force that makes me jump, but I don’t bother with embarrassment because I see Sherlock flinch at the sound too.
Shouting at someone becomes rather imminent though very quickly, because within the box lay two items: a note that says “A gift from the Jiang family – they still had your measurements. – M”, and a pair of nearly identical leather gloves to the ones I left in the tender care of John Watson.
I’m still busy collecting my jaw from the floor when Sherlock passes my phone back, finally making eye contact and
Also, not sure if I can safely rule the torture dungeon out of the options, so… no. I’m doing this alone.
I’m their friend? Who are ‘they’? Is John included in ‘them’? What are the minimum criteria of entering a friendship? Isn’t there a time limit? A minimum number of exchanged words?
His muscles are tense as I peel the gauze away from his back, but his breathing stays calm and even throughout the whole hour I spend at 221B.
I’d agree with most of it – sans the latter, but the thing is, I think she is going to say yes. We might be moving a bit too fast, but it fits us, somehow.
John pushes two white, round pills into my left hand and a glass of water into the right. His palm covers my fingers for a second, not letting go until he’s confident the glass is secure in my grip. I swallow the pills dry before I realize what I’m doing, but I decide to take a few sips of the water under the weight of John’s glare. He did go into some trouble for acquiring it for me, after all. Probably. I didn’t see where he got it from. He could be poisoning me right now.
Ex-soldier, actually, invalided from… tan line above the wrist; Afghanistan or Iraq? Inconclusive, not enough data.
The next several Fridays I get a text from Mike without fail, all mentioning that John will be there. I don’t respond to any of them.
Mycroft’s superior grin doesn’t falter as a brunette steps out of the car and helps him into his coat, but his posture seems to soften as he turns back before disappearing behind the— wait, is that Anthea?
“So,” Mike waves his arm to recapture my attention, and his smile widens when my eyes land on the general vicinity of his face. It’s becoming unnerving, all the smiling. “I hate to do this, but I promised Lidia I will be back before nine. The kids,” he makes a vague gesture that could be interpreted in so many ways it’s impossible to interpret. “You know how it is.” Do I? Who is Lidia? “John, will you be alright—”
“Not a word, Sherlock!” I shout when I sense he is about to speak up, and don’t start regretting it until my phone chimes when I’m two streets away and still carrying the damned thing only for decoration.
I cut her off with a small huff, because yeah, even a small child would be able to tell where this is going and I don’t have the patience to wait until we get there.
“No, what I’m saying is that he’s not—“ he cuts of abruptly when he notices me, eyes going wide for a second before he steal his expression into something more unreadable. “Never mind,” is all the explanation the person at the other end of the line gets, and the call is cut off without as much as a goodbye.
Because John is not a detriment to the work – quite to the contrary, apparently. John, who followed me blindly for the better part of yesterday without a single complaint, who jumped into a rubbish bin and called me amazing and forgot about his limp in the face of danger, who kept worrying about my wellbeing even though he had absolutely no reason to even
Why is he so offended that John and I are not spending our Friday evenings together? Did he think that a simple introduction would throw us into—
“Uh, I’m sorry but I just remembered—” I start making my excuse, but the world’s apparently only consulting detective cuts me off like I’m not even there, and I can feel the tips of my ears go red from a weird combination of shame and anger. God, I can’t wait to be back at my flat.
My knee-jerk reaction is to say no, to deny him the possibility of negotiation, because I know he doesn’t want me to leave once he’s healthy again but I’m not sure I can give him that. Yet, the resignation in his tone cuts at something inside me, deep and wide, and the wound bleeds faster as he sighs like he already knows the answer to his question but can’t help asking nonetheless.
“Yeah, it really is,” he’s grinning again, slumping back into his chair with a sigh. “So tell me, did he say anything worthy of blackmail while he was concussed? I have been trying to get him drunk for
He places a hand towel over his lap, which is a better idea at preserving the tiny shred of modesty I remember him having than the bubble bath I forget to suggest. Better that way – his skin doesn’t need the extra chemicals.
manage to pull in a breath with some difficulty, it takes me about two seconds flat to realize what Greg meant the other day.
I’ll take up more hours at the clinic, start learning Serbian (there’s been a surprising surge in Serbian patients lately), and while I will never be able to forget about you (not that I’d want to), eventually, hopefully, I’m going to start talking about you in past tense.
Prior to last Friday I did not even know we had each other’s phone numbers. Must have happened during that time with the one too many pints, when everyone around our table seemed to wear an air of friendliness that doesn’t come to Englishmen without a certain amount of alcohol involved. I can’t say I mind, really – Greg is a good lad, and he could do with a bit more of a social life too, from what Mike tells me.
My hands seem to find the places where antibiotic ointment should be applied without conscious though, which is good because the rest of my thoughts are busy picturing him huddled up in a corner, knees drawn up to his chest, shielding his head with his arm from the flames.
“That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” I say as we slam the door to 221 Baker Street shut behind us, sweaty and panting as we lean back against the wall of the hallway, coats discarded onto the banister. Our shoulders are pressed together, the contact burning hot and transmitting every tiny movement, every shudder the other makes as we are trying to catch our breath.
Sherlock frowns, gracing Mike with an evaluating look, and I take the opportunity to try and announce my department again.
I feel laughter bubbling up in my chest when I realize my left hand is as steady as it ever was before Afghanistan, but my somewhat crazed amusement is seated too deep to break to the surface.
Protectiveness! Yes, that’s it. Greg is Sherlock’s friend, and Mike – and even Sherlock himself – told me how people usually react to the consulting detective’s deductions.
“Reading, television, crime scenes. I’m aware.” I’m also aware that the corners of my mouth are doing things without my permission, but fortunately John’s face reflects the sentiment.
“Excellent,” I make to stand but John’s hands press on my shoulders, then there are fingers sneaking down my nape, under the collar of my coat and jacket, settling their warmth somewhere between my shoulder blades. I wonder if I should inquire about the goal of this exercise, but John removes his hand quickly, his palm saturated with partially coagulated blood. Estimating blood loss, then.
A green bottle with a handwritten label serves as the shampoo, but it appears to be more aloe than soap so it doesn’t lather well, and I rinse it out of his hair with a plastic cup I don’t remember procuring. I’m already standing in the living room, preparing the gauze when I realize he might need help washing his back and shoulders as well, but he comes out dressed in pressed trousers and a dressing gown before I could offer any more assistance.
“It’s…” he pauses, waiting for me to cut him off. I raise an eyebrow just enough so it couldn’t be misinterpreted for a signal to stop, and it encourages him enough to go on, albeit not with too much conviction. “It’s true I cannot play most chords with the proper finger placement at the moment, but the presence of the fretboard alone makes the basics not at all dissimilar to a violin. Sustaining notes is a bit more tricky, but…” another pause, to make sure I’m still listening. “But I should be able to play at
He never mentions the way I stop using my cane the moment I step into 221B, so who am I to suggest sponge baths anyway.
Mike is silent for a few minutes, but he’s quite good at strategic silences, so I don’t let it lull me into a false sense of security.
I don’t manage a full blown smile, but the corners of my lips twitch as I reach for his hand to untangle the dressing from amid his fingers.
I might have a few bruised ribs and something small and sharp is stuck in my right calf, so I respond in the negative.
“Good,” I avert his gaze and step through the door before he has a chance to respond, not caring if I move with the urgency of a prisoner about to escape. “Bye, Sherlock.”
, but I don’t get any further than the Gents’ at the corner pub next to the tube station. Around the second hour the sounds of retching alarms the other patrons enough to notify the owner, who none too gently asks me whether he should call an ambulance or the police to get me out of there.
“The engraving,” he says mildly, and I can’t tell if it’s a warning, a challenge to do one worse so he would have ample reason for throwing the first punch, and his fingers are still probing around my very much
The glue doesn’t touch my skin, but I still feel the heat of it as it dries. I wonder if John knows that the cyanoacrylate in superglue reacts to the humidity in the air rather than the gases, as most people would assume. Electronegativity breaks a double bond in the monomer structure, which leads to—
There is a wary look on Sherlock’s face, one that he has been wearing for the better part of the last hour, I think. I can’t recall how well he handled being touched just now, but I hope it was better than how he did with the blond doctor. He never flinched away, that at least I am sure of.
“Right. I’m not buying that. Not with your cast,” I point to the offending item for good measure, and I catch his gaze not quite by accident, assessing me, head tilting a bit like on those rare occasions he forgets people are watching him when he’s deducing.
I want to ask what he means by that, but Greg’s smile gathers a hint of alertness, eyes narrowing with… suspicion?
John seems to ponder that for a minute, but another trickle of blood escapes my hairline, which seems to motivate him into making a decision.
It’s a light, cream colored thing with a white part under the strings, a black neck and black buttons I never quite learned what were used for. There is a speaker on the ground that looks big enough to drive the neighbors into instant insanity, something that resembles a pedal, and an amount of cables that seems way too excessive for connecting these three items alone.
“Um…” he looks around the scene once more, uncertain, then gives a decisive nod before braving one more glance at me. The last one he intends to send my way, I can tell. “Bye, Sherlock.”
“So, I hope you know I can’t let you go to the Yard in this state, let alone… where were you going to go to collect evidence again?”
. The blue scarf Greg tore from my hands the day before I first visited his grave, and the hat, that godawful hat is pulled down into his eyes like he never took it off, and he’s there, he’s really there and not lying in a pool of blood on the pavement or burned to ashes and stuffed into a urn because he’s
Molly brings in coffee and chats with Mike for a few minutes before taking her leave again, and the lab falls quiet for so long I’m beginning to think I’ve been left alone when Mike’s voice disturbs the peace.
“Oh,” he finally accepts the mobile, and I’m surprised to see a barely there upward quirk to the corner of his mouth. “Thank you.”
This is the third time he (futilely) invited me out to their weekly “pub night“ during the last two months. Timing sporadic, even though he didn’t skip the remaining five occasions, if Molly’s ramblings are to be believed. Not a simple social nicety then – he had a specific purpose in mind when selecting the dates. Something out of his control when it comes to schedule, something like— oh.
“Uh, yeah. Yeah, I went with him to the hardware store after I patched him up. He had a concussion, I couldn’t let him run around the city all alone, at night.” Too defensive, tone it down. “So yeah, he told me a bit about his work and how he does it.
“She was called in for a nightshift.” Mike is still smiling at me, and I’m just beginning to contemplate whether I’ve done something wrong already when I’m distracted by the feeling of my hair being parted above my vertex. I try to turn around to make sure it’s John standing behind me and not the redhead waiter, but calloused fingertips press at my temples and direct my gaze right back at Mike.
What on earth is John doing here? He didn’t come with Lestrade. Coincidence? I nearly scoff at the unintentional thought, feeble as it is. The universe is rarely so lazy. Why then? How?
“Are you alright?” I ask because the anxiety doesn’t suit him and I want to erase it, I want to replace it with something, something better, something wondrous and astounding and just as delightful as the fact that ‘
I don’t have much to clean besides the hand, so I give the remaining sutures on his back a cursory wipe and start on drawing him a bath. Waist height, not too warm.
The living room hasn’t changed much since the last time I was here with Mrs. Hudson and Mary, and if it wasn’t for the two figures occupying the sofa, there would be no indication it was lived in at all. The idea of knocking didn’t even cross my mind before I barged in, but if the surprised expressions I’m greeted with are any indication, it should have.
His smile is forced and fake, and it’s the most painfully beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.
go without turning back just once more, without making sure he’s there and real and breathing, without making sure he’s not going to disappear the moment I take a step outside. There go all those promises to myself about keeping things levelheaded and rational. Laughable, that’s what I am.
A quick glance at the clock on the wall makes me realize I’m about an hour late, and that Sherlock was probably calling Mycroft to ask for his previous doctor back, because ‘
Much to my surprise Ella doesn’t press any further, despite it taking me a while to find my voice again.
“Here,” his hand disappears behind his back for a second, and when it reemerges something is shoved against the bare skin on my forearm. Something cold and metallic.
The man looks ragged in the best kind of way: tousled hair and flushed cheeks, green eyes shining with a predatory gleam as he takes a step closer, palms coming up and pressing against the wall above my shoulders. I lift my chin in defiance, making no attempt at escaping the arms that are bracketing me.
the words are meant to be delivered with an air of detachment, but while there is no resentment hollowing his baritone, there is something raw and open in there, like a bleeding wound, one that makes Sherlock sound like he swallowed gravel. He sounds… wrong.
I spot a not even remotely discreet black car parking along the curb as I’m on my way to the main street, but Mycroft doesn’t seem to be in a social mood because he doesn’t stop me as I walk by. Very good – I’m in no mood for whatever he decided he doesn’t want from me after all, either.
“Yes, of course I’m alright,” he says a bit testily, but his hands are not shaking so I don’t think a total mental breakdown is imminent anytime soon, which is a relief. One less thing to fix before I take him to dinner.
“No,” he clasps my shoulder and gives it a squeeze, his smile gaining a more natural tint when he reads my confusion. “I don’t think I will.”
I grimace obligingly like I give a toss about the flowers or their color, and deliver the expected playact over dinner in which I try to futilely talk her into red roses or something that is apparently considered equally ludicrous for a wedding.
Suddenly I’m on my feet and all but run towards the kitchen, but the lack of microscopes, petri dishes or normal kitchenware there pushes my body through another terror-born surge of adrenaline, and I opt for pacing the length of the living room instead, hands tangling in hair I haven’t brushed properly in days.
She’s a new nurse at the clinic. Didn’t seem to be warned off of me yet, but I expect someone to give her ‘the speech’ before our second date. No matter. She’s nice but we don’t have too much in common as it turns out.
Lestrade doesn’t bother asking if I’m going along, offering some feeble joke about how duty calls, but Donovan stops on her way out, and I wonder how the doctor-soldier is going to react to the name calling. To my surprise, Donovan directs her next words not at me but at the blond man, addressing him with a tone that is light and amused. Interested.
My reply makes Sherlock chuckle, and it’s the most beautiful sound I have ever heard, and my blood is singing in my veins and adrenaline is still thrumming through my body and dear god I never want this to end,
“This is the last one,” the doctor retracts his hands quickly and holds them up in as if in surrender, and while his face is carefully blank, the  trace of exasperation in his voice is impossible to miss. This is not the first time he witnessed this reaction from his patient, and I’m nowhere near prepared to consider the implications of that fact.
No. He wants to leave. Not an unexpected outcome, all things considered. An apology might work in the short term – it usually does – but it wouldn’t fix the issue, not entirely. Nothing ever does. How many apologies until he stops responding to my texts?
I am so certain he is going to latch onto the reason behind my presence that I find myself gaping when Sherlock’s expression crumbles, morphs into a disturbingly unfamiliar picture of relief, and the corners of his mouth lift into a smile so soft and radiant it steals the air from my lungs for a second.
He tilts his head to the side, an inscrutable expression taking over his features, and I have no idea how long we’re standing there before Mike’s voice breaks the silence.
Ella asks the question as if she doesn’t already know the answer. Everyone does. Even Mary knows it, for god’s sake.
I take a shuddering breath and open the door in a now uncomfortable daze, surprised to find Angelo standing there.
Silence falls over the table, and even I can tell it’s not the good kind. The cellist looks at me with the same wide, horrified eyes he regarded Jessica Hopkins’ post-mortem photo with all those weeks ago. His gaze flickers between me and John, who, to his credit, hasn’t paused in his ministrations again.
“And frankly, a bloody awful cabbie,” he adds after a short pause, and the laugh that’s been building since the moment I spotted John just won’t stay suppressed anymore, but I don’t care because John is laughing too so it must be okay.
“No, no, that’s not—“ he gestures behind himself, indicating he has no pursuer that needs to be taken care of. I refuse to feel disappointed. “I need you to come with me, John.”
My heart lurches when I manage to open my eyes again, because the emotions flickering over Sherlock’s face are too fast to follow and not at all veiled, not like they are supposed to be. The surprise is the easiest to discern, but there is something else too – concern, perhaps? Yes. It’s the same expression Greg and Mary get when my breathing gets funny, or overly controlled.
“What do you mean you wouldn’t know? He didn’t come to the pub these last two weeks, I thought he was… you know, with you?”
Well, I guess my thoughts must have shown quite clearly on my face because Sherlock is crossing his arms over his chest defensively, the movement made awkward due to his cast, but his eyes haven’t lost a bit from their wideness which kind of ruins the petulant look he is going for.
I’m going to visit your grave tomorrow morning, on your anniversary. I’ll bring you flowers you would sneer at and hate with a passion, and I will bring Mary along because… because.
“You’re an army doctor – obvious. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp must be really bad when you walk,” he gestures in the direction of my cane behind my chair, “but you’re not favoring a leg when you sit or stand, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan or Iraq.”
Greg asked for my assistance on a case, if you’ll believe it. Something about army weapons – I’m not all clear on the details yet, but he’s coming over tomorrow with the necessary files.
, and bloody hell, haven’t these people been taught how to control their thoughts when they were in kindergarten? Everyone is thinking so
“Diener,” I interrupt again, watching the soldier’s pupils dilate as he takes me in from head to toe, slowly, eyes landing back on mine.
wrong, and this is nothing like how our first face to face conversation should go after eighteen months.
of all people, who’s been hell-bent on reuniting me with his brother ever since his return to London,
It’s just as well – I’m hardly fit for re-entering the dating scene anyway, if Ella’s increasing complaints about my general lack of progress is anything to go by. She would be pleased about me making a ‘sensible decision’, for once.
His torso is an array of colors, purples mixed with greens and yellows, all deep bruising at different stages of healing. The right shoulder has got the worst of it – it’s a blackened mess from all angles, decorated with two tiny puncture marks at the collarbone and a thin line that used to be held together by five staples. Surgery incision.
I stop pacing and attempt to take a calming breath, perfectly aware of the hole Sherlock’s stare must be digging into my back. He doesn’t say anything though, and for a few long minutes there’s only the sound of my ragged breathing filling the silence.
Twenty minutes later John opens the door to an incredibly dull, sparsely decorated bedsit with gray walls and barely any signs of a tenant, save for the army doctor blinking up at me in shock, caught in the process of tying his—
Ella keeps saying London is a city full of possibilities. What a joke. Baker Street is cold and alien when I step out onto the pavement, not at all like it has been mere minutes ago. The colors are dull and washed out, almost grey in their lack of intensity.
“Right,” he shuffles his feet awkwardly after I ring the bell – forgot my keys again – and slowly, cautiously, withdraws his hand from my coat. “Do you, um… is there someone—”
“Do you think so?” I blurt the question before my eyes could reach John again, John, who is looking down at me with… not contempt, not surprise, not exactly; this is something bigger, better, something
I don’t know what Mike was even thinking in the first place, honestly. What felt like an exciting prospect of getting to know someone new, someone
The words are entirely devoid of inflection, so I take them for what they are and resume peeling the gauze away with a somewhat muffled thank you.
I heave a sigh and start composing an excuse in my head, dressed in words that are apologetic just enough to be believable, but Mike seems to sense my hesitation because he follows up with another text before I could type out mine.
“Oh Sherlock, you’ve been out late again,” Mrs. Hudson puts a small box on the table as soon as she arrives, starting on the kettle without her usual complaints. Something’s wrong. “Your brother’s been in earlier.”
I feel my cheeks redden a bit – while Mike has been quite open about his match-making plans ever since he admitted to them after Sherlock’s first visit to the pub, discussing the matter feels a bit humiliating now that I’ve got a dose of the man’s brilliance firsthand. Forget leagues, Sherlock and I are not even on the same
He doesn’t say a word throughout the whole ordeal. Mycroft’s hand appears around his left elbow at some point, and it lingers, but Sherlock doesn’t react.
I'm not a native English speaker, so please feel free to point out any parts that sound weird to you or should be fixed for whatever reason. Hope you enjoyed this chapter nonetheless, and as usual, feedback is always welcome. :) Thank you!
“Well, that’s new,” I say by way of greeting, visibly startling Sherlock with my voice. He’s taken to waiting for me on the couch, nose buried in his phone, barely sparing me a glance before starting on ridding himself of his shirt. Greetings are usually optional.
Sherlock gives the tiniest pause in unbuttoning his crisp white shirt (it’s always white these days) somewhere at the end of Mrs. Hudson’s rant, and I realize he might not even be familiar with Mary’s name.
“Not— you’re not in trouble! God, I’m bollixing this up!” he laughs again, then makes an effort to collect himself. “Look, Anderson is on forensics today, he won’t work with Sherlock, and you’re an army doctor, and Sherlock is always going on about needing an assistant, I know this is a lot to ask, but if you could… just this once John, I swear—“
I find myself reaching behind my back for a gun that isn’t there for the second time in as many minutes.
“Cancel your date, John,” I say with as much confidence as I dare to put into my hastily formed plan, and step into John’s space. He’s not backing away which is an excellent development, because it will make the logistics of this next bit all the more uncomplicated.
I establish a profile as I make another attempt at pushing the orange blanket away, but it gets immediately replaced by the handsy nurse who probably thinks I’m about to spontaneously asphyxiate, seeing how she has checked my lungs three times already – twice out of which she did so without the usage of a stethoscope.
I open my mouth twice only to close it, before my vocal chords deign to work with me. My mind won’t supply the words, not the right ones at least, and what comes out sounds desperate to my own ears even as I say it, grasping at straws that aren’t there – that likely have never been there in the first place.
“So,” Greg starts once the excitement of the patrons has settled into a more contained buzz, not tearing his eyes away from the screen. “I hear you patched Sherlock up last week, after I left.”
We would like to inform you that due to some unforeseen scheduling issues, we have decided to postpone the day of our wedding to the
“Another time, then,” John offers but his eyes are resigned, the words just an out he wishes he was given before agreeing to come here tonight.
This earns me a raised eyebrow and a small pang of guilt, even though I haven’t directly lied to her. She just assumed Sherlock and I engage in the occasional small talk, and I didn’t see the point to correct her.
“You need to go the A&E,” he states with an air of finality, like he expects me to obey without questions, and I realize that submitting to his brief physical assessment might have given the wrong impression. If I would stop being dizzy for just a minute, I might even be able to say what that impression was supposed to be, exactly.
“Yes, he is,” he says simply, decisively, and looks me in the eye as he fires off instructions at the speed of light. “Keep an eye out for the pneumonia. He doesn’t need medication anymore, but you know how easily that tends to come back,” he smiles at me, and I feel like there’s a joke in there, built on our shared profession perhaps, but my attempt at copying his expression is half-hearted at best. “He is due for an X-ray in about two months, as I’m sure Mycroft will tell you. There is antibiotic ointment in the bathroom, and there should be some bandages left too, but I trust you have everything to redress his wounds, right?”
“Can’t,” the words are out of my mouth before I can contemplate my next set of actions, which is good, because: “Work.”
I have seen Sherlock face countless criminals during our time together, each with varying amount of contempt, but the sneer he is wearing right now has always been reserved for Anderson, Donovan, and the doctors who were trying to treat his injuries in an ambulance after a chase gone wrong. The tight knot of fright eases up its clutch around my stomach, but I still have to make a conscious effort to relax my shoulders.
He kept his right leg slightly bent in the bathtub. Not sure if it was an attempt to hide the reddened skin over his shin, or one to keep it out of the water, but in either case it didn’t work very well.
“Yeah, he’s brilliant, the git,” he says, sounding more fond than scolding. “A great man… someday maybe even a good one, if we’re lucky.”
John goes straight home from Baker Street: no undue money left from this month’s budget for a stop at a pub (was he tempted? inconclusive, but likely), too reasonable to spend on alcohol when procuring food becomes of essence. Happenings of the rest of the evening unclear, not enough data. No reason to suspect anything of importance though – it’s not Friday, and John has little to no social life outside of Fridays.
I don’t know who Greg is but John seems confident enough in his ability to deliver the object to the Yard, so I defer to his medical expertise. Rest sounds surprisingly non-horrible at the moment.
The next forty minutes are spent with companionable chatter, sprinkled with the occasional opponent bashing when it becomes apparent our team is going to lose. The conversation remains more or less centered around Sherlock, though. Greg tells me about the time they got several calls from concerned citizens about a man, who got on the tube coated in blood and wielding a harpoon (turned out to be Sherlock, of course), and I tell him about how Sherlock called his own hair thick, curly, and ‘quite nice’ while I was preparing to put superglue into his apparently luxurious locks.
“He did, huh?” he asks and— oh, that’s not suspicion at all, is it? It’s something more fierce, more like…
Others bear far less weight, like that one time you turned up in my bed in the middle of the night, wrapped up in a gazillion sheets and shivering violently, claiming that "a fevered mind cannot be held accountable for navigating its owner to the wrong bedroom". You sneered at me when I offered to make you soup and nearly bit my hand off when I tried to take your temperature, but for all the bark and constant stream of complaints about my mattress and the ‘frankly offending’ volume I was breathing at, you still refused to move. You didn’t sleep a minute for five days afterwards, and I wish I had asked you why that was, while I still had the chance to ask you questions.
“Shot in the dark.” I shuffle in my seat uncomfortably, fighting the impulse to explain. Futile. That’s a battle I never win. “Good one, though. Power connection – tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge, but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone, never see a drunk’s without them.”
His reply makes my eyes snap back to his, and it’s all I can do to stave off the panic attack my body insist on having all of a sudden. Stay where, exactly? In the flat? In the building? London? The bloody
of all people who’s been hunting the crowd – and he also does nothing to stop Anderson from snapping pictures as I’m sitting in the back of an ambulance with this stupid orange blanket around my shoulders that the paramedics just won’t let me get rid of.
Sherlock’s answer is accompanied with a shrug that doesn’t include his right shoulder nowhere near as much as it should, but his words make something in me uncoil nonetheless. Something rather enormous, apparently, if my chest’s freshly regained ability to expand to its full extent is anything to go by.
By the time the game is over I find myself relaxing into the banter so much that I make the mistake of mentioning how Sherlock fell asleep mid-sentence in the cab, right on my shoulder.
“It’s nothing,” I try to infuse an audible smile into my voice, hoping it doesn’t sound as strained to her ears as it does to mine. “Just the clinic. False alarm.”
Mycroft makes a show of dragging his eyes away from his watch and graces me with a scolding glare, which, okay, no. I’m not the one who spent more than a year pretending to be dead, so if Mycroft thinks he can make me feel
“Oh don’t be like that, he left something for you,” she motions to the black box and I decide to tear at the decorative bow before my anger could focus itself on Mrs. H again. She does so hate it when I shout at her.
Also, it has the added benefit of asking questions about Sherlock without having to pretend not being interested in the answers.
“Not besides the bare minimum. I tell him to move or turn when I’m changing his dressings, but that’s about it.”
Mary points at the half-empty bottle of Cyclizine on the bed, and I find myself completely unconcerned with the lie I’m about to deliver, having gained more than enough experience on how to sell it since Sherlock’s return.
Thank you all for the many wonderful responses to the last chapter, I am so happy so many of you are enjoying this story! I will respond to all of them after a bit of sleep, seeing as it's 5 a.m. here. :) Until then enjoy this chapter, hope you like it!
I almost, almost burst out laughing when I take in the scene unfolding on the screen, where the MET is apparently holding a press conference with Greg next to the podium and wearing an electric blue puffer jacket with a thick row of fur around the neck. Surely he’s not wearing that by choice, is he?
“Hence the false alarm,” the words are escorted with a breathless little laugh, and Mary buys it without a second thought. She has no cause for doubt – I never lied to her before, after all. “They paged the wrong guy.”
Well, I did let him touch my hair. And my arms. He’s still gripping my left shoulder, I think. I hope it’s him and not the waiter with the red hair. I don’t feel like chasing snipers today.
“Mycroft’s idea,” he mumbles, immediately focusing his attention back onto the brightly lit screen. “It’s the closest it comes to imitating the violin without a bow… or the tedious need for lung capacity.”
what you would say to that one: too soon, we’ve only been together for a few weeks, statistics about marriages ending in a divorce, the probability of her cheating on me within the month because of some astute deduction you’d base on the color of her nail polish.
John must have a concussion too, because not five minutes later we are sitting in a cab, side by side, as he listens (actually
It doesn’t hurt that his invitation lacks the subtle undertone of pity for the invalided soldier, which, despite his best efforts, cannot be said of Mike’s texts, as much as I try to ignore it every time he sends me one.
I smile in reassurance because Greg became a good friend over the last year, and he deserves better than a mate he constantly needs to worry about. I’m not his problem.
I don’t answer because what would be the point, but when John stops after a few steps and looks over his shoulder to add: “I’m glad you’re okay,” I can’t help but give a hum of acknowledgement.
John releases my head and grabs my biceps instead, as if he is afraid I’m going to fall without him keeping me up, and stares at me with a focus that tells me he is looking for pupil dilation and involuntary eye movement. The vertigo has lessened enough that I can keep track of his blue orbs without much difficulty, but that doesn’t seem to satisfy the doctor.
Three, if previous averages are to be believed. Perhaps five, in John’s case. He does seem to possess more determination than most.
“You were interested in her just minutes ago,” I blurt out before I could even settle on the type of reaction I’m trying to provoke, but John surprises me by not denying the truth of that statement. “What changed?”
John continues to work in silence, and I count three braids before he appears between me and the table, mumbling something about the angle, then resumes with a fourth braid. My sight is suddenly filled with the grey-blue wool of a frankly dreadful jumper, which I hope John chose to wear for its thick material and subsequent usefulness in hiding the gun against his lower back rather than visual appeal, because as far as presentation goes…
John glances over my shoulder and I turn back to see Donovan eyeing us suspiciously as she passes by, but she would need at least two more brains and a detailed map to figure out what happened here today so I graciously let John apologize and mutter something about nerves in her direction, which is a blatant lie but Donovan, of course, doesn’t stop to question it.
Lestrade, God, have you always been this dull-witted or do you have to work extra hard to fulfill your daily quota of idiocy?” I snap at the D.I. before I realize that I let my irritation with the cellist – with Mike – with
Extraordinary. My mind latches onto the word with a ferocity that makes my vision blur, although I do catch a glimpse of John holding the glue tube between his teeth as he takes his place behind me once more. He smells of gun oil. Exactly like last time.
implication right there is not something I’m willing to take, not even from Sherlock Holmes, because I may be invalided, I may be limping and scarred and too broken to remain a surgeon, but being a doctor is the one area where I am – and where I always will be:
I put my burger down and turn to Mike, intent on telling him I won’t be available on Fridays from now on, which given my state of unemployment and no social life is as transparent of a lie as it gets, but I’m feeling pathetic and juvenile and… yeah. This can’t go on.
I manage a sound of what I hope is a vague agreement as I take a sip from my drink and hope that will be it, but alas, Greg has different plans.
I know he isn’t. I’ve known for weeks, but it still takes me a moment to reconnect the figure on the screen with the person I exchanged those horrible, dreadful, amazing text messages with just a couple nights ago.
The quiet voice stuns the table into silence, and the blond haired man shift uncomfortably under the attention he unwittingly attained with his words. “It’s… um.”
I stop to laugh for a good five minutes, leaning on a wall and brushing away the tears streaming down my face, resolutely ignoring the berth people seem to be giving me.
Sherlock’s voice is steady but holds no trace of a smile, and I wonder if that was only wishful thinking on my part. I hope it wasn’t.
here, at 221B Baker Street, to do just that, since texting is obviously beyond Sherlock’s capabilities.
As laughable as that idea is, I find myself surveying the occupants of the rest of the seats. Both Lestrade and Molly defer to Stamford’s judgement when it comes to interpersonal relations, and I cannot help the flicker of curiosity over the person he would perceive as a
“Alright, how about this. I want you to make a mental list of the things you used to have conversations about with Sherlock, and see if you can bring one of those topics up the next time you see him. Sounds alright?”
Mike Stamford. Extrovert, sanguine personality, never a trace of negative feelings towards my person. Has been referring to me as a
“It’s for you,” Sherlock says all of a sudden, his face adapting the carefully arranged, blank mask that I’ve seen him wear after Sally had called him a freak the first time we’ve met, and that’s when alarm bells start to go off in my head, signaling something isn’t quite right.
I also went back to Baker Street last Thursday. Didn’t stay long and didn’t go upstairs – not quite there yet – but I shared tea and biscuits with Mrs. Hudson. She looked to be on the verge of tears only for the first half an hour or so.
All of a sudden it’s extremely hard to imagine how I managed to avoid running into Mrs. Hudson during my previous visits, but hindsight is refusing to tell me whether that was a conscious effort on my part or completely accidental.
I realize that my voice gets softer and softer as I keep talking, so I clear my throat and wash the words down with a rather large gulp of beer. After a moment of silence I chance a glance at Greg, who looks at me with a raised eyebrow.
My tone is uneven and barely above a whisper, but it’s enough to recapture Sherlock’s attention. His eyes are almost comically wide and full of wonder, his childlike amazement unmasked on a level it only gets after solving a ‘three nicotine patch case’, and God, the intensity of those sea green orbs hasn’t diminished one bit and I feel myself starting to collapse under his scrutiny, but just as I’m about to break eye contact Sherlock beats me to it, jerking away from the other man’s touch on his neck with unexpected vehemence.
Why am I panicked? Because I don’t want Greg to know I had been interested in Sherlock. Especially not now, not after all of Mike’s careful planning has fallen over with a crash – even if the man himself has yet to admit to that particular failure. Greg has a very down-to-earth view of the world due to his work, and he spends a considerable amount of time with Sherlock, again, due to said work. Surely he would see the absurdity of Sherlock (mad, handsome, brilliant Sherlock) being
Mary looks satisfied with the answer so I bag the bottle when she goes into the bathroom to prepare for bed, like the pills inside are really meant for Sherlock instead of me.
It’s hard to say whether that’s a command or a plea, but my answering nod must come across as a good enough promise because half an hour later Greg is back at the Yard, and my SIG is safely tucked away in my dresser, at the bottom of a drawer Mary would never look for.
I have no idea why there are words still coming out of my mouth, but John doesn’t seem to mind, so it’s fine.
My thumb catches on a ripple over the left thigh, which gives way to a ridiculous sense of embarrassment over my rumpled appearance. Sherlock’s black suit pants of course are ironed and impeccable, and I find myself wondering if he dressed up for the blond man. He never used to change from pajamas unless he was leaving the flat, and I have it on good authority he is not allowed to do that alone yet.
of those things dampen the feeling of amazement I feel when he gathers that the victim just arrived from Cardiff, based on nothing but a
I don’t know why that thought makes me as angry as it does, but the next thing I know I’m reaching for a painfully familiar handle and I don’t remember walking up the flight of steps behind me, much less closing the door downstairs.
I’m not sure if the disdain in my voice is sufficient enough to forestall any objections Mike might pose to my request, but when I look up from the microscope he’s standing right next to me, and his contemplative expression morphs into something more frustrated, angry even, before smoothing back into a forced smile that doesn’t sit well with me at all. Is that it? Have I finally managed to offend Mike Stamford into running? Are the forced smiles all he’s ever going to greet me with from now on?
The burns on the right side of his neck and his forearm are healing nicely. Not even the few spots that must have been blisters are likely to scar. The back of his hand is another matter – a thin layer of skin graft covers part of it just below the pinkie and ring fingers, and it’s easy to recognize the signs of a recent infection. This will take a few more weeks to heal completely, and it’s not going to heal well.
I went on a date today and imagined what you’d say about her only four times. I’ll call this progress, because if I don’t then that means I haven’t made any since you left and that’s just not acceptable at this point.
My eyes are getting dry but I won’t allow myself to blink, not if it means giving him a chance to vanish, to be swallowed up the by crowd around him and leaving me behind, because for all those ghastly thoughts about how life seemed easier when he was dead I cannot deal with the idea of him being out of my reach again, of him going somewhere I cannot follow.
Lestrade took my gun. He must have taken it at least two weeks ago, because he hasn’t been in here since then. Such an amazing deduction, isn’t it.
The cab doesn’t drive off until Mrs. Hudson has collected me from the porch, and by some miracle the next morning finds me in bed, alone, with a horrifying sensation I haven’t experienced in a while. Certainly not in this context.
after whatever it is that I’m about to walk into, but Greg is telling me about rules and protocols and “don’t you breathe a word about this to anyone, John”, and I can’t bring myself to regret my decision as I’m ducking under police tape, not even when I have to walk up the stairs to the second floor, limping.
Army doctor, but wounded in action; hiding a cane behind his chair, but not injured in the leg… psychosomatic limp. Nightmares, PTSD, frequently cancels on therapist. Unemployed, small flat, old spring mattress causing him back pain… Phone a gift, from sibling with addiction. Bad relationship. Plain clothes, deep-set desire to blend in. Atheist despite strict religious upbringing. Nurturing personality, wish to contribute, ordinary routine. Common. Dependable, craving stability. Harmless.
“You do it, then,” I blurt out before my mind has a chance to catch up with my mouth, and John’s amused smile vanishes without a trace. Shame – he has a nice smile. Was it really directed at me?
“…and nerves of steel,” I force the words through my lips, trying to focus, but it’s impossible with John here, eyes darting around the scene behind the police tape, catching my gaze just for a second before looking away innocently, like he has no idea what—
When we arrive John informs me that the trip seemed unreasonably short only because I fell asleep, which is such a ridiculous notion I don’t even dignify it with a response. He leaves his cane in the cab as he escorts me to the door, and at this point I start to wonder if his fingers will leave permanent indentations around my left shoulder. He seems to have developed an odd fixation with it as a main source of physical connection.
Sherlock looks bewildered for all of two seconds before those green eyes widen again, and I can read the reply on his face before it has a chance to be uttered.
identical only – the material is new and shiny and doesn’t have the slight cracks and creases my old pair gained during the last few years; these are not comfortable or well-worn or
“Stop tilting your head,” John chides and corrects my posture again without giving me a chance to do so. He’s a very physical man, isn’t he, this John. “Also, that was rude,” he adds, but he sounds more amused than chiding now.
Mrs. Hudson takes the flowers and hurries to put them in a vase, an act which is quickly followed by an offering of tea and pleasant conversation over her kitchen table.
. I thought I’d surgically attach myself to his hip and never leave his side for a single waking moment ever again, not even when he’d start kicking and screaming and ordering me to get lost because he’s sick of the sight of me, and I thought there’d be nothing, no force in the universe that could possibly keep me away from him for—
“So does this one,” the man proceeds to pour some clear liquid onto a cotton swab, oblivious, as if the tension in the room couldn’t be cut with a knife. Sherlock hisses when the swab touches his skin, and I watch as the familiar sneer washes away his perplexity over the words, as if it never existed in the first place. “His right forearm can probably forego the dressing next time, but the hand already got infected once so I wouldn’t risk that just yet.”
His hand goes back into his pocket a moment later though, and Mycroft is touching him again, freely and without hesitation, like such physical contact has been normal for them during their entire lives.
I know it’s a dream, but there are people, people who are trying to rip Sherlock’s arm clean off his body, so I scream because what else can I
“I just… God, I used to imagine him coming back so many times at the beginning,” and in the middle, and at the end, and yesterday, and five minutes ago, and likely tomorrow and the day after that. “I thought I would be… uh…”
. He gave the phone to you, that says he wants you to stay in touch. You’re looking for cheap accommodations but you’re not going to your brother for help, that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife, maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
“You’re bleeding,” he says as he pushes gentle fingers behind my left ear, and indeed, they come away red. Not surprising, with the force of the blow Hart dealt, although it’s a little disconcerting that I didn’t feel any blood trickling down my neck up until now.
“Hello Mike,” I greet him in what I hope is an amicable tone, and it must be working because Mike beams at me in turn.
I pass the manila folder back to Lestrade blindly, who heaves a sigh as he moves to stand up, gesturing for Donovan to follow. “Right. We better—”
, and he will keep doing it right until the suicidal tendency that every freshly returned soldier is shipped with rears its ugly head again, until he starts polishing his gun daily again, until the nightmares—

”), and he keeps praising my deductive skills all the way until he’s found the weapon, and then some more.
We end up at a restaurant named Angelo’s, where the owner is grateful to Sherlock for sending him to jail, and where Sherlock says “I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work” during a slightly awkward conversation where I fail to tone my interest down to an acceptable level, and even that is fine, it’s
“—and even if you don’t,” I probably do, “that wound is bleeding rather a lot. It needs to be sewn up.”
The papers on the desk have the NHS logo printed on the top corner – new job, most likely as a general physician, seeing how an intermittent tremor would prevent any doctor from performing surgery in good conscience. Sore throats and congested sinuses and the occasional case of a mysterious rash – John finds it exceptionally boring, hence the paperwork accumulating on his desk. He is so behind he decided to bring it home to catch up during the weekend. His cane is hanging from the back of his chair along with his coat, a grey woolen thing with—

John blinks in surprise at the inquiry, and the contemplative look on his face that follows ruins my good mood in an instant. No. He’s going to say no. But that can’t— why would he do that? He clearly enjoys the thrill that the cases could potentially bring, and he managed quite a few hours in my company without resorting to insults, so he should be—
My silent plea is forgotten when I feel a shift in the air around my face, and I open my eyes to come face to face with one Sherlock Holmes.
Well. Mike might be good, but he’s certainly not omnipotent. If there was a person in this world who is compatible with my…
“Hmm, yes. I do know about that one.” Of course he does. John is a doctor. “Didn’t follow a word of all that chemistry though, I’m afraid.” No matter. He knows about the ants.
I hear the smile in her voice and my breathing slows down a bit at that. I hang up my coat and join her in the kitchen, inhaling the smell of lasagna penetrating air. She thinks Italian is my favorite – the result of a misunderstanding I’m reluctant to correct, especially since her ravioli is to die for.
Ella doesn’t wait for me to elaborate beyond giving a short pause – she knows very well that I’m not above wasting a full session on sitting in silence unless she prompts me to talk.
“And as you might have noticed, I have one,” he responds with a huff, frustration at having to state the obvious palpable in his voice.
I take a deliberate breath and let the panic wash over me, knowing it will ebb with a few heartbeats if I just rationalize the situation. Like Ella taught.
He sends me a quick glance before looking back to the screen, the small gesture working miracles on dissipating my anger for some reason. I hesitate, more than a little lost, but Mike offers no help when I seek out his gaze across the table, sporting a knowing smirk while chewing on his chips.
