Mycroft organised for her to be housed in 221c, the flat down stairs in my building that no one would ever rent.  The flat had been furnished over the last couple of days. If I had been focusing on anything other than my son, I might have noticed delivery men coming and going.
John is flattered, surely, but it goes much further. The sentiment in the poems swells in his heart, and deep in there he starts to understand that this relationship requires a pronouncement, a declaration, something official.
But the shirts stayed packed, and John’s room still looked as if his occupancy was temporary. Sherlock wanted John to settle down, to ease back in against him, to come back home to the life they had shared.
The room was disordered and slovenly. Clothes hung over all available surfaces, the bed was unmade, shoes and purses and magazines were scattered all over the floor. The collection of possessions and pictures and the small indicators of her life and interests were pathetic, a little embarrassing to him. She was thirty two or something, may be older, but she lived like a teenager amongst ornaments of coloured clowns and pictures of her with friends in party frocks and a picture of nanna - hers or maybe someone else's - and a picture of her dog, posed besides a tapestry of a dog - all this coloured detritus that represented only parties and possession. No books, no hobbies, nothing in staid colours, only pink and baby blue and yellow.
He says his hellos, concentrating on being relaxed, friendly, but all the while noticing the way the light shines from Molly’s hair and the length of her pretty fingers.
The little girl is transfixed. She watches more footage, sees herself being held by her mother, sees her mother kiss her exquisite pink face, watches her brothers gather around, sees herself being held by her father and her mother leaning in again for more kisses.
I looked at it, and John read over my shoulder. Albion was currently trying to pull his hair, which required a more advanced skill because it was so short.
“No. I don’t want him. They can have him.” She said this politely, and not with malice. It was an honest statement but still I ached for my little boy, that his biological mother was unconcerned with his magnificence.
“Oh, yes.” John nuzzles the side of his face and whispers. “Tell me, did you ever think about doing this?”
If he’d kept notes and made charts, Sherlock would now have unassailable scientific proof:  poetry makes sex better.
On the sofa are three plans of a building that was once, for a time, Wridge’s Wine Imports in Putney.
And there's the murderer, dead before he hits the ground, flopping where he stood, directly at Sherlock's feet.
The mood lightens, and the talk becomes more general. John’s doctoring is welcome, and the bandage is much more comfortable. He checks the tablets Mrs Best is using, doesn’t like it, so writes a prescription for a more specific antibiotic.
At that moment a group of three boys, fourteen or maybe fifteen, walked towards them, jeering and catcalling. Ryan seems to shrivel before them.
"Ooooooh, I think you're going to love it." She tosses the paper over to him, misses and it floats softly to the floor. "You read about it and I'll book you in for an interview. Can you go now?"
I haven’t bought Albion any shoes because there’s no point, given he can’t even lift his head yet. I have got him some socks though, all of which I chose because they match or compliment his jumpers.
Our lives settled down substantially once John started his new job. I took more and more cases from Detective Lestrade and John, when was able, he came with me.
The ugly tormenting shapes Sherlock had carried around in his heart, those mean shadows always one quick step behind him, never disappeared, although they faded and disarmed as John continued his nightly rubs and quiet reassurances.
And for John, Sherlock feels right. He's all bones and long clasping fingers and jutting edges, a heavy head of hair that smells like sweet powder and oil, skin light like buttermilk as John unbuttons his shirt and feels the secret warmth in there, the shell like ridge of his ribs, the soft expanse of his abdomen and the thin trail of hair, everything lean and tense and underfed. John rolls his fingers under the hard cage of Sherlock's left rib.
John crept into the rumpled bed beside her, under the thin sheets and moved over towards the warmth of her skin to slip his arms around her ribs and to his surprise he felt peppery little tears spring to his eyes because he has not understood, until he felt this close embrace against his naked skin, how horribly alone he is every hour of the day. The wretchedness of his life is suddenly unavoidable. He wants comfort, and now is willing to do just about anything or anyone to have it even for a few harshly lit minutes.
He sits for a long time, his eyes moving slowly from the desk drawer, to the bird, the gathering night outside, back to the drawer. Not here, not now.
It’s difficult to know which way to go with this conversation, so John lets it drop and reaches for his mobile phone. Someone else can look after the carbs.
“Thank you.” John shrugged. “Doesn’t matter now. It’s all in the past. Ollie would have forgotten me completely. If any one ever tells her about me when she’s an adult, she’ll have to take their word for it because won’t remember me.”
I was, however, enlightened at first sight when I first saw John Watson, by which I mean my entire outlook became brighter because he brought light to my occasionally bleak world. Also, he wasn’t remotely fazed by me, which was maddingly attractive.
Mike, not Molly,  took my blood. “I don’t get enough practice!” he said with his hearty laugh.  He was right – it took him three jabs to pierce my scarred vein.
“What do you mean, ‘yours’? Did you steal him?” He glared at us both with growing distress. “Oh Sherlock, for the love of God – did you use that money to buy a baby?”
Uncle Rudy watches from the drawing room window. Behind him, Mycroft Holmes is curled on an old red velvet sofa with a plate of chocolate biscuits, engrossed in Churchill’s A History of the English Speaking Peoples (volume 2). Mr Holmes is in his favourite chair, reading the Telegraph, which he will follow the Lancet, and then Private Eye. Mrs Holmes is in Mummy’s Room upstairs, doing what the children affectionately call her Important Sums.
He took my face in both damp hands. He was on the edge of expanding his view of spectacular but he didn’t have too, because I could see it in his eyes. I love his smile when I he knows I’ve second-guessed his thoughts.
(Harry is John Watson’s sister. She is something of a mystery to me because John never talks about her. I know only what I’ve deduced from a phone she gave John four years ago, because he won’t introduce her to me. This causes me no concern. I would have shielded John from Mycroft were such a thing humanly possible.)
Albion, exhausted by a day of hair pulling and legal procedures, once more slept soundly.  I was having happy (and deluded, it would transpire) thoughts that he was starting to sleep the entire night through.
“Dr Watson, was it?” Ms Powers refused to be waylaid by the terrifying doctor. “We need to be certain that Albion is healthy. Could you confirm that?”
My son looks like me – dark hair, blue eyes, knobbly knees - but is not so like me in temperament. He’s gentle, has an adorable lisp, natural kindness, and reminds both Mycroft and I of his grandfather, who he adores.
This is one of the grey areas of sentimentality for Sherlock. He has many possessions that are meaningful to him, but – save a couple of random, hastily scrawled notes from John and a shopping list John wrote a few days before Sherlock leapt from the roof of St Barts – none of his sentimental possessions are related to anyone else. He doesn’t expect anyone else to keep things he gives them; he sees no reasons to keep cards or photographs, unless they pertain to John.
John doesn’t just go somewhere, stand at the lookout for a few minutes and go home. He walks up the main street, checks the map, finds out where the library is, has a look a the local museum,. talks to the volunteer who works at the museum, asks them where he should have lunch, goes there to have lunch, tries to pick up the waitress, goes down to the tourist information centre, gets a complimentary map, has a look at their appalling permanent exhibition of the history of the local jam factory (or insert whatever local attraction you think is appropriate), goes and looks at the factory in person, talks to someone he meets near the jam factory – you get the picture.
“That sounds like the perfect date,” is the best he can manage with his pasted on smile. “I hope you both have a wonderful evening.”
No aspect of that news made me feel good about myself. I was glad Albion would never know of his father’s shameful past.
Sherlock is hyperactive. He bounces in the car, narrowly missing John twice with his flaying hands, stretches his long lean torso around to yell at Greg as closely as he can.
“Hullo Sherlock. Oh, hullo John! Thanks for the postcard! Glad you came home – everyone should have a long holiday. You must be keen to get back to work. I need someone to supervise fourth years in trauma. Do you want to apply for a job here?
I expected therapy at the latest place to be similar, and that they would release me (or let me have a swim) when they had similarly flogged me into replicating an acceptable form of behaviour.
Rhonda wails on the back seat as they drive down to Highgate where the nanas live in the care facility that currently has no cat. Michelle and John do admirably well at pained small talk; each is very relieved when they get to the hospital.
John was not so lucky. He woke up agitated and fearful at 2.12, damp and wide eyed in the grip of a nightmare.
“What is that peculiar smell?” Mycroft said by way of greeting. Before I could answer, he started a bit then stood very still. “Who is that?”
It wasn't that she was smarter. It wasn't that she stabbed him with a syringe full of decidedly cheap opiate and furnished him senseless for five hours. She was smarter but it transpired he was smarter after all and he out smarted her eventually. It wasn't that.
“We have. Caroline, might I get you something to drink? We’re not stocked for guests but I could rustle up some whiskey or maybe”–
John is sorting through the thick dark curls, stretching them gently and watching them spring back into place. “Yes. Or as little as you want. I intend to make sure that you are not only the most pain-free but also the most content gay man in London. Are you measuring my ear with your tongue?”
There isn’t much to add, so Sherlock spends their happy silence watching their clasped hands and congratulating himself, for his original deductions were actually correct.
“Sherlock!” John Watson was in my face. Both Albion and I stood to attention. “I’d love to. I will sign now. I have no hesitation. You need to make up your mind if you want me as Albion’s parent. If not, it’s all fine. We can wait a couple of years and if it’s all still fine, I can apply to adopt him.”
Their walk was pleasant. Sherlock wished he had some nuts for the squirrels and said as much to John.
After speaking to a mostly unhelpful headmaster and a slightly more forth coming Geography master, Sherlock has learnt the name of the possible suspect – Jeremy Dyson - and his best friend Tom.
My mother rolled her eyes, mouthed HE WAS JEALOUS at me in a very theatrical way and then set about leaning over my father so she could snatch Albion back.
In the car,  Sherlock declares it would be a waste of time to come to Hastings and not get fish and chips.
I’d read something about it but at that moment was distracted by John’s large and complex scar. It was the first time I got to look it closely and at leisure.
It was horrendous to see him like this. I wanted to fix it. “Do you want to try and get her back? Mycroft would help.”
I have said before that John is a conductor of light and once more he was operating on full voltage. The drops on the table were just that – drops, not spray – which indicated that the victim had apparently staggered by the table before he collapsed.
Sally keeps her lips pressed tight until she’s regained her composure and can speak civilly. “How did he die?”
Sherlock closes his eyes as the fresh bandage is set in place. His heart beats a little harder when John gently cups his chin for a split second and says finished, all done.
I drained my first cup. “The British Government. He drops in every morning on his way to work to remind Albion that no one life can be perfect.”
Sherlock turns to John and takes a leap. "We could take them back to my place if you prefer, or we could eat them here - what do you think?"
Eurus has a sudden disturbing thought, and looks at Uncle Rudy with lowered, threatening eyes.  “Can I take my pencils?”
Albion’s first act of brilliance was, at eight days old, to stare, transfixed, at the rather dated, quasi-Victorian wallpaper in my flat. I knew his sight was still very limited, but I knew too that the thing he could see most clearly was distinct contrasting patterns (my wallpaper is a black fleur de lys on a beige background).
Sherlock is profoundly bored with all of this. He has already deduced that the gun is immaterial. He looks around the kitchen, notices the Arabia dinner service on the shelf, files away the pattern for future reference, notes that the family had chicken wings and fried rice for dinner last night, watches John handling the fake gun and files away his beautiful facial expressions for future reference, looks at the youth worker’s handbag then promptly deletes it and finally, when there is nothing left to interest him, turns to Jeremy and talks over Inspector Lestrade.
I laughed. “No. It was strange, hearing you call us family. I never thought of Albion and I being anyone’s family.”
“Mrs Best,” Sherlock asks, out of the blue, “I don’t mean to pry, but you have no photos of Mariah  here? “
"Bengals," Sherlock says as he scans the road for a cab. "I particularly like Bengals. They have nice markings. And I should like an Airedale too. Excellent snouts."
John has just folded his jacket to a neat parcel on the floor. "Actually, you might want to leave your shirt on."
"You're free to blog about whatever you wish." Sherlock is scrapping away at small muscle fibres, trying to conceal his satisfaction at being the topic of John's blog.
Papa, who in those days only emerged from his study if he thought an alternative reality may have appeared, shuffled out to the kitchen. He regarded both his sons silently. He looked at the smashed plates at Sherlock's long bare feet. He looked at Mycroft (also in bare feet)who had
“It’s an insignificant thing,” the Doctor told Social Services. “Sherlock’s a scientist, so of course he’s not going to consider toys important.”
John was home not long before midnight. There were tiny squeaks in the hall, the old floorboards releasing and contracting as he looked around for Sherlock.
The resident will take any crumbs he can get and talks haltingly about an older male patient who has non-specific abdominal pain and severe swelling. The resident thinks it's kidney stones.
A dentist? For a moment I couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t disclose Albion was with his father. Then I remembered to eighty thousand pounds.
I instructed Albion to make a very big fuss of John Watson so the judge wouldn’t hesitate to appoint him as his second parent.
John drops the beam to the floor and there she is, mummified from the cold and left as she was dropped forty two years ago, Mariah Best in a red and yellow frock, white socks and one brown Clarks shoe.
“What kind of bath sex?” Sherlock is now loosening John’s shirt while assessing the best way to show John how broad his chest really is.
Fiona? Sherlock flicked through the files in the admin office of his mind palace, the room where he kept temporary facts that he could delete quickly if they were untouched after eight weeks.
John is visiting a nice town house in Brent's Cross. It could be perfect, because the second bedroom is at the back of the house on the ground floor and looks out on to the garden. Out here no one would hear him screaming.
Feet shuffle under the table and John’s English brogues are captured inside Sherlock’s Italian patent leather.
Sherlock’s curiousity trumps shyness and he reaches out to runs the pad of his thumb over John’s umbilical scar.
And like a good Englishman, he keeps the feeling suppressed until it becomes so ripe, it bursts when he least expects it.
“Good morning!” I said to Albion, who smiled and made some vowels for me. We were delighted to see each other. “Have you been assisting Doctor Watson with raspberries?”
Sherlock, though he missed his sister desperately, wrote pages of letters, beautiful ebullient notes filled with news and positivity. It’s only 498 miles, Sherlock regularly reminded her in a letter, and the plane takes, on average, 52 minutes.  Uncle Rudy said he would stay a bit longer, and Papa says he will live in Switzerland for a few months when Mummy comes home. But Mummy is still going to come on weekends and sometimes with us!! We can play the violin together!  And you will come home for Easter! Victor will be home too and we can play ahoy matey on the shore again! And did Mycroft tell you that in September, we are both going to be boarding at Sherborne? But don’t worry, I can still sneak over and save you if I have to, even if I have to go to yucky old school.
“I was in the army. Did I tell you about that? We built all kinds of shelters and buildings in Khandar. Basic dwellings, shelters – all part of general training.”
John freezes for a second. Suddenly it seems like the cruellest thing in the world, to take a creature capable of flight and trap it in a cage. His heart is like wet cement in his chest but he has to keep going; each child watches as he gently lifts the little bird out of the box and feels those tiny little claws again, cups it in both hands and carefully puts him back in the cage.
Someone then jumped in to save both of us, because Mycroft was not a particularly good swimmer. He did get my head above water, though.
It wasn't that in her nakedness and gently curved smallness she reminded Sherlock that he was tall, broad shouldered, angular, manly and stronger than her, that he could pick her up and carry her across the floor with no effort if the mood struck.
“Then the Woodsman took the heart home to the wicked stepmother, who was an even bigger idiot we initially thought, because obviously a little girl’s heart would have been smaller than a boar’s heart. Unless of course the Woodsman trimmed it somewhat.”
John Watson watched the Holmes men with some interest. “Never took you for a person much interest in babies,” he said to Mycroft.
“Sounds fine,” John says as he pulls the phones from his ears and lets the instrument hang around his neck. “Anything else?”
“It’d be easy to build from scratch,” John says. Sherlock watches a gentle slyness rise in John’s eyes as he continues. “Actually, I could build you one but I don’t have the right tools.”
Before the night sets in, John walks to the local Boots to buy some gauze and antiseptic cream. Then it occurs to him that if he's going to go out on cases with a man who has no concern for his own safety, he should have a proper kit.
Saturday. He was born on a Saturday; that the idea of dying on a Saturday is satisfying for him is testament to how depressed he is.
Red rimmed eyes, heavy bags under his eyes. Not sleeping. Depressed. Weeping. Skin is slack, so not eating much either. Clothes are clean and cared for, so he's working, living somewhere with a laundry. There's cat hair on his trousers, one or two on his jumper. Has a pet, so living somewhere settled. No wallet, no phone. Why go out without either, yet carry his medical and army id?
And then it occurred to me that that’s what he had been asking. So I swallowed very hard and asked the embarrassing sex question.
“You can have whatever’s left over,” John Watson promised. “When I’ve finished. Until I’ve finished, the paint is off limits.”
John peers down into the black and see a long, sturdy ladder leading from the entrance., He does not wait for permission, and eases himself onto the steps, torch clenched between his teeth. Sherlock follows immediately. Lestrade is on his way down when John, already standing on the floor, shines the beam at the ceiling, and reveals a room almost fifteen feet high. The white light shows, bit by bit, a perfectly round cellar, lined in concrete and covered with wine racks, which Mr Wridge decided, in 1970, was far too cold a place to store wine.
My limited expectations were useful. We both turned out to be much greater idiots than we realised when it came to having sex.
I was certain Adrienne would be getting lots of help via a pipe, but chose not to disclose that here.
A miracle would be nice, Sherlock thinks. A very big miracle. Not nearly enough miracles these days.
“Once upon a time there was a handsome Prince who was quite smart but in essence an absolute idiot. He was born with a big brain but no one could find his heart.”
I made my indignant face but it was ruined when John Watson softly held my face still in his hands. He does that these days when he wants me to listen closely to his orders. It is very effective. John comes in loud and clear when he holds my face.
John has taken a few days off, partly to attend to some tiresome administrative matters and but mostly to assist Sherlock, who has finally been invited to help Scotland Yard on the mystery of the four armed robberies.
It was so inadequate. John Watson, who was an eminently capable doctor and changed nappies and made tea and manufactured a war of wills with a mild mannered nanny was so much more.
Sadly,  I never understood that I was in love with him until his wedding, and sadder still that I realised that he reciprocated those feelings the night before his wife shot me a second time.
“It’s actually more interesting on the other side,” and he leaned against me, face down and forehead resting just under my chin so I could see the other side. He was right, the exit wound was smaller and neater, but it was obviously that quite a lot of flesh had been disrupted as the bullet tore through him.
“That’s Peanut,” Jenny says fondly. “He likes to sit at the window and perve on people. But I have to go, I’m running late as it is. Maybe I can call in a week or so or find out if you’ve made any headway?”
I was able to work out why one generic person might love another generic person. I was able to work out why I loved my insufferable brother, my parents, Detective Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, my landlady and my friend Molly at St Bart’s lab where I steal test tubes and Petri dishes.
The Warlock isn't pleased. "Man, this means that we have to get someone else to help with the rent."
It is a common story. Two young people who met in a more conservative time, found they had a few things in common, enjoyed a mutual attraction and then married quickly to hide a pregnancy. It sounds so quaint now. There was no lasting affection, no strength in their relationship, but no animosity either.  He loved the baby, she loved the baby, but that was eventually all that was left to them. Their separation was inevitable. It was no surprise when he started seeing a woman he met through work. It was no surprise when that other woman came to the door to declare her place in his life. It was no surprise that he packed his things a few days later and paid six months mortgage for his wife and child before he left.
Mycroft turned around so all I could see was the back of Albion’s head and the delicate soles of his perfect marshmallow feet. He had the tiniest speck of nail on each toe. I have kissed each one countless times.
Sherlock goes through the findings and explains each one. "Dressed up, new fleece, girl from the suburbs who travelled to the city. London girls don't wear those shoes, that kind of fleece. Small traces of powder on her fingers means she's been handling baggies of the drug, grease on her fingertips and small traces of salt and grease on her lips and specks of potato on her back molars means she had chips. Her septum is unmarked so even though there is the faintest ring of powder around her right nostril, she hasn't used it more than a couple of times. She doesn't smoke but her jacket smells of smoke, so she's been with a smoker. Maybe the murderer? Doubtful, because there's no ash in here and no recent cigarette butts. Her teeth are very even and straight but her jaw is relatively narrow - chances are she's just had braces removed. Teenagers don't choose braces - their parents do. Her t-shirt's been ironed, her jeans are freshly washed. Teenagers don't iron t- shirts. Their mothers do though. How did she get here? The shoes are new but there's ample markings on the sole, so she's not driven or got a lift - she got a train or maybe a bus from a station quite some distance from her home: she walked."
"No. I'm won't. Now if you don't mind, I'm hungry and would like to get some food." Which is not strictly true, but it allows for a dignified exit.
I deduced it had involved Ollie, which was unsurprising, given John’s new role in Albion’s life and the endless discussions of parenting over the last twenty-four hours.  John’s subconscious must have been sodden with his feelings and grief for Ollie.
Sherlock, to whom things happen regularly & who only a short time earlier was flogging a corpse with a riding crop, doesn't look up from his microscope. He is mesmerised by small pools of blood that spit and shine like tiny stars as they burn in salty solutions.
shadow of his lips barely touching his face for a second. "Now sit still and if you must wail, do it quietly."
Lestrade dropped by whenever he felt like it - early morning sometimes, late afternoon other times. These seemingly spontaneous visits were planned, obviously to catch me if I was using drugs again.
“Why are you here?” Sherlock asks, feeling as if he is being watched by both the woman and her breasts.
Albion was asleep now, no doubt because he was reassured that John Watson was coming home.  I reduced my voice to a whisper as I carefully lay him on his little blankets.
Rhonda, who was born in a car park and rescued by a council worker before being adopted through an ad placed in a vet's window, had all her cat dreams come true when John eventually carried her to the kitchen and placed before her an entire roast chicken.
Sherlock chooses a night when the moon is waxing, only because it looks more interesting as it is growing larger.
“I’m not going anywhere,” John assured me as he sorted through the chips for the crunchy bits. “And leave my socks alone.”
Charlotte and her Warlock shift their eyes from John, to Sherlock and back to John again. John smiles a little.
“I’m Sherlock’s poof,” he says happily. “Now take your kid in hand, tell their parents to do the same and keep away from Ryan.”
"He isn't bringing anyone to the scene. He's accompanied by a doctor - a very good doctor from what I've seen - who actually helps him with the cases."
John, who used to be able to insert canulas in low light relying primarily on his sense of touch, is enjoying a large cup of too-hot coffee on his second last day. His hand is relatively still and his leg doesn't feel too bad.
That night, to Sherlock’s surprise, he finds himself a little more adventurous with John, who in turn is a little more expressive than usual. The indicators are tiny – more grasping, more involved kisses – but possibly, Sherlock surmises, related to the poem.
They were at their best when they were together. We are, they realised as their love grew and progressed, each other’s best man.
John and I had some sex, but perhaps not as much I think we should have been having. It was nice, gentle sex, not the kind of athletic sex I’ve seen on the internet or in movies I’ve deleted. John hadn’t complained about the sex, and I didn’t want to look like an idiot who embarrassed him by asking if we had normal sex.
Mycroft dragged a chair over and sat in front of us, as if he was observing an especially interesting zoo exhibition.
Angelo’s wife, Marina, his kitchen staff and the wait staff all gathered around us. Albion studied them all and assessed whose hair he would like to pull most.
I read each one so many times I lost count, and I never lose count of anything. No one has ever told me they loved me 108 times, in writing. (Or compared me to a penguin. The two things are now are indelibly linked for me.)
My flat, when I hobbled home from hospital that day, looked like nothing ever happened to the person who lived there. Every thing was clean, no dust settled on any surface, no mail piled up on the table, no random grime on the rugs.  A couple of dishes sat in the dish rack, rinsed and perfectly dry.
It looks different from his day but it's busy, like accident and emergency wards are always busy. Moans and sharp shrieks are coming from all directions, intercepted with dull beeping noises from drips or monitors. Two nurses are seemingly arguing at the nurses' station, a doctor rushes past, heading in the direction of an unseen female patient who is screaming behind a curtain at the end of the corridor and over there is an older doctor in blood smeared scrubs - undoubtedly, thinks John, the house surgeon.
John doesn’t want to leave 221b tonight, and he doesn’t want this known to Sherlock. If he were less distracted, he may have examined this feeling more closely, but tonight, while everything is fraught and the voice of a long dead child echoes just inches from their space, all he knows is that wants to be here with Sherlock.
She yowls loudly. No! Don't leave me here! Come back! There better not be any bloody warlocks here, Captain! Come back!
She batted him again. Captain, I'm hungry. I have no thumbs. I think there 's a cooked chicken in the kitchen. Could you help?
“I still can’t get over the fact the fact you’re a father”, he told me for twenty first time. (I was keeping count. I intended to call a halt to his exclamations of amazement when he reached fifty.)
I touched each tiny knee cap. I very carefully ran my index finger over his little rib cage. My whole hand overlapped his tiny chest but I could feel each little rise as he took his breath. There were tiny little lungs, smaller than my nose, in there too.
There are things to read, chemicals to burn and observe but Sherlock is quite content to lie there and watch over John. It’s funny, he muses, how saying something sentimental fills you with the urge to act sentimental. Funny, too, how that process acts as an invisible glue that binds you both more closely together.
After being exposed as a woeful raspberry blower, breakfast was in order. “I’ll make the tea if you want to do the formula,” John suggested tentatively.
“No. Not at all. It’s just a lot to take in. You think you know a person and then you find out they have straight boy pain.” John walks back to the kitchen to wipe the counter. “Sherlock, if someone’s led you on, or – you know, just been a dick to you, you’d tell me, wouldn’t you?”
After John has eaten a lot and Sherlock has eaten a little, they toss the box of crusts to one side and curl up the floor on Sherlock's cotton sheets. John is exhausted after a day of walking, a day of grieving and a night of murder, Sherlock - not so much. He waits until John rolls over and looks at all the marks on his back. There are lots of little recessions, tiny little dips which perfectly accommodate a fingertip. Rugby player, Sherlock realises, and puts that in the John Room as well.
“I’m starving!” John Watson declared. Albion was resting on his shoulders, thinking about whose hair he might grab next. “Let’s go somewhere to celebrate!”
It starts with a simple game – young Sherlock, in brand new wellies, running along the shore with his friend Victor, known, at least to Sherlock, as Redbeard. They’re playing pirates. Little sister Eurus watches from the sideline, trying to keep up, desperate to have an equal role in the game. She can be a pirate, she keeps telling them, but the two little boys are totally wrapped in each other and Eurus doesn’t register in this important game.
"I got a suspended sentence," Renzo says proudly. "Here, do you want a table at the back? I've got a fantastic fettuccini a longo on the menu tonight - I make the sauce myself from chilli and lime."
Work offers no respite. Once there he faces a whole different raft of issues that hammer at his crumbling psyche.
Sherlock, too, liked John being a prison doctor because he worked only three days a week, which allowed Sherlock opportunity to bask in the glory of Watson light for four days a week. Also, Sherlock knew quite a lot of John’s patients, and in many cases one or both of them had been responsible for the patients being in prison.
“What were you going to call me?” Sherlock wonders. They’re playing now, John tickling his ears, Sherlock tenderly smearing soft kisses on John’s belly as he watches him.
Sherlock is at his regal best. “I have every right to respond to anyone who challenges the safety of my friends, you tedious accountant. Pity you don’t police your own business as obsessively as you police everyone else’s.  And you can ask any of these people here” – Sherlock sweeps his hand elegantly amongst his friends – “who just witnessed these ugly rodents abusing Ryan. Who, I might add, is a dear friend of mine, as is his father. Now if you’d prefer not to have a bully for a son, I’d suggest you read a parenting manual or do whatever thing people like you do to cure your horrible children and ensure they LEAVE RYAN ALONE.”
Mycroft straightened up and looked me over. His face seemed placid but I knew he wasn’t pleased. “How are you feeling, Sherlock?”
Sherlock was right - the letter is boring. John throws it and the ripped envelope in the bin, then tries several times to engage Sherlock in a discussion about his university days. He gets monosyllabic answers so instead takes to the Internet to learn about Sherlock’s alma mater.
“Yes!” John kept beaming, waiting for Sherlock to disagree and explain too precisely why dating Fiona was a bad idea.
John stacks his small collections of belongings in the hallway and stands beside Sherlock, about to explain that he's leaving. Sherlock, though, has got it under control. He flashes a police warrant card.
The child’s real father had reported Mrs Watson to Social Services, for reasons I still haven’t learnt. I’m guessing they had some kind of disagreement.
Anya looked at the pieces carefully, read the manual a second time, leaned over and went click-click click and the entire frame was completed.
Sherlock agrees. “They look after their tails. That’s another thing I like about them. They’re clean and neat. Actually I like that about you too. I’ve never seen you looking untidy.”
“You were new born. This is three days after you were born, when Papa and I brought you home from the hospital. Look!”
“Well, what can we do,” Mr Holmes says with mild boredom, not looking up. “The psychologists are still trying to devise a plan for her. No school wants her – she already knows more than any of the teachers.” He folds the paper, places it neatly on the side table, and reaches for the Lancet. “Best let her play in the meantime.”
Everything was wrong because now, with the coast clear and both of them at very relaxed stages of their life, John chose – once more – to date another woman. Not Sherlock.
He's glad when the weary mother returns. She's holding a large cage in one hand a packet of birdseed in the other and dumps both on the floor.
“Absolutely. He was an enormous help. He always provides invaluable assistance on every case we do together. He’s a an experienced and very skilled doctor, and he acts like a conductor of light.”
“I was alone for two years, John. There were times when I had to make food or I would have died of malnutrition. I googled something like easy food and oddly enough found it could be quite interesting to prepare simple meals.” He popped a small portion of buttered soda bread into his mouth. “Except things with tomatoes.”
At the moment he's half-leaning towards going back to whatever horrible dark spot he can find for himself but it seems considerably less appealing now. Tonight has been great, he says to himself over and over. I learnt a lot and I had to think really carefully about everything. And then there was the stitching. God help me, I've missed it.
So is John, but about different things. The latest poem is starting to work its magic  - plisses scarf, he thinks over and over - but he knows well enough that now is not the time or place to discuss it.
I had a mental picture of Dr Watson making all the cold scientists cups of tea and taking photographs of the outsize penguins they have down there. Outsize penguins would interest Dr Watson. I would offer good money at competitive odds that he helps a few of them make their nests.
When they get to the hospital, John’s fury is at boiling point and he won’t look up. “Whatever this is, Sherlock, make it fast. In and out, understand?”
Across the road there's a tall man in a smart tracksuit with a head of grey hair streaked in shades of purple that’s been pulled back into a shaggy tail and secured with a length of sparkly elastic. The man is running across the road, oblivious to the traffic, his calls growing louder.
Eight months after John had settled in to Baker Street, Sherlock, who had been wandering around John's trees in his mind palace, asked him when he first realised when he might like him.
Finally, he wanted to do it where he'd be found quickly, but not by children, not in anyone's private space, not anywhere the ghost of a suicide would cause distress. A church, a cemetery, somewhere quiet and empty. And in London. He loves London. The thought of dying right on its heart was comforting.
Sherlock has taken John to not the most salubrious, but certainly one of the best Italian eateries in London. The owner could not be happier to see him and comes out from the kitchen with his arms flung open.
John, who used to think he would retire from the army aged fifty and come home to set up his own practice in suburban London, is about to start moving into Sherlock's radar.
(John foolishly forgot about the pelican and the following morning, admittedly in a haze of love sodden sex exhaustion, nearly jumped through the roof when he idly reached in the fridge and found a cold, rubbery bill where the milk should have been. But that’s obviously a story for another time.)
"It's only for a while, and then you'll be in a fantastic hospital where you can walk wherever you want and everyone will love you." She's not convinced and miaows louder. Out of here NOW, Captain!
John has just threaded the final suture. He stops for a minute, closes his lips tight and turns his face slightly. He doesn't know what to say so Sherlock keeps talking.
That night Sherlock is consulted on the case of the not exactly suicides. He meets the killer cabbie face to face and humours him for a while, pretending that he too will swallow the fatal pill. He listens to the cabbie's dreary brags and woeful excuse of an aneurysm as he texts Lestrade under the table.
“Remember to write to me and tell me how many favours you get in prison when the other inmates learn you where bluffed by an empty Coke bottle.”
Ademar has made tea and is sitting on the couch with Sherlock.  Today they are drinking from Doulton cups. Sherlock isn’t familiar with the pattern – he thinks it might be Autumn Leaves.
John is stretching a curl and watching as it winds back in on itself. “It was about one of the first computers. The mathematician who operated it programmed it to write poetry for the woman he loved. In the end the machine fell in love with the woman too and when it learnt that it couldn’t marry her, it spewed out enough poems for the mathematician to give her every anniversary for five hundred years, and then it committed suicide.”
He hands them to Sherlock. It could be an impasse, but it is so typical of their communication, the secret, intimate language they are developing with its roots in trust, experience and their ever expanding understanding of each other. They stand face to face, each determined to not to smile but end up smiling straight into one another’s eyes.
I thought it was a soon enough for Albion to experience how someone might hold him. Also – Lestrade has a horde of children. It was likely I could learn something.
I had my latest notebook on hand too, because there were many aspects of tummy time that I wanted to record for future reference.
John was more physical with his approach – he'd lay Albion over his shoulder, pat his little bottom and pace the floor, all the while repeating soft, kind things in a gentle way. It actually put me to sleep on a couple of occasions.
Sherlock is about to explain Papa when they hear heavy leaps up the stairs outside. John opens the door to Lestrade.
"He said it was a practice with some gangs in the US, if a foot soldier didn't call in to their dealer or the boss regularly, they'd take them and get the number they had to call tattooed on their arm. It was a partly humiliation thing, but sometimes a gang initiation thing."
After a bowl of baby custard and some low grade fussing, Albion dropped off to sleep just before 8pm.
We’d planned to spend the day buying the plethora of things needed so Albion could enter the fascinating world of food.
Rudy tries again. “She will be in permanent detention if she doesn’t get help soon. I’ve spoken with Ludwig at length on this. He says that despite her gifts, or possibly because of them, she is an immense danger to everyone.”
“Yes, but the Prince wasn’t particularly skilled in the area. The internet hadn’t been invented then so the Prince didn’t have the opportunity to work out what he should be doing. It was all a miserable failure, and the Prince left University and went to live in London, where he stayed with his big brother.”
We had nearly run out of interesting things to talk about when she grabbed her purse, as if an exciting thing had occurred to her. Which it had.
“Well, it was, but it turned out to be less about seeing if I was romantic, and more about telling you things that I thought you should know. And then it turned into a thing for us, and it was – well, fun. And you liked it.”
where he will have to be introduced to a whole raft of new people whose names he won't remember and be forced to sit through an endless deluge of pointless meetings in rooms done out in wenge and chrome with some colleague bumping him with their chair and waking him up.
My son is now four. He’s sitting on the floor playing his favourite game with John and I. We’ve have upended a full bucket of wooden bricks and have built three tall towers.
The electricity fills the cab for a while before John speaks again. "So how come no one knows about you? I mean, why aren't you in all the papers and being followed by a TV crew?"
“She figured that no one looking for her would have suspected her to be a nurse, married to a doctor, living in suburban London,” he explained.
Hugging people, I think, can be awkward. I never know exactly what to do when someone hugs me. Then there is the minefield of when to end the hug. I find I am always first, and end up holding myself very still still until the other person has finished.
The news that Mariah had been found resonated with the British public. Many people remembered the child’s disappearance, and many more empathised with Mrs Best. The funeral was small, but the little church was filled with bouquets and teddy bears.
The property was vacated in 1978, not long after Mr Wridge died. The business languished, and the property passed from developer to developer, while the council remained resolute that it would not be demolished. The planning committee insisted that whoever developed the awkward building would have to maintain the mostly ugly façade, and no architect had yet worked out how they might create maximum profit-making apartments within such limited parameters.
“Ludwig has said he can take her. He has been working on actually building empathy and sympathy in those that appear to be born with out them, just like an orthopaedic surgeon might build a leg for child born with that kind of deformity. He thinks that he might be able to save her.”
"They pay my expenses. And yes, I have received payment, or payment in kind, for services rendered to private clients." Sherlock is carefully lifting the lingual vein from the tongue. John watches and can see that someone has taught him basic surgery techniques.
Lestrade, bless his heart, had delivered five boxes of cold cases. All unsolved murders! One of his diligent and entirely misguided office juniors had drawn up a spread chart that detailed each case and an estimated time of completion. I threw it in the bin.
My desperate outburst at the hospital was not the first time I told John I loved him. I told him once after he left his wife (and came straight to me and slept in my bed), twice after I was shot and once when I came to after the first operation and saw him sitting there, reading a copy of Hello magazine with a slightly confused face.
Today, I look around the bright living room and see the crumpled waste of Christmas wrapping paper and the pleasure we took last week in gifts we could see.
John thought it would be highly charged, testosterone soaked arrangement. “I bet there’s a lot of aggression and fighting behind the scene.”
John, marked by his third year tutors as having the best bedside manner in his group, regards his therapist with the same patient disappointment he has for every one these days. She ploughs on regardless.
Mycroft bought my parents twice. They were monumentally disappointed in me, as they had been as far back as I can remember, and were also determined to assure me that they were entirely forgiving of me, and at great personal cost.
“Good. That’s - good. “ Sherlock sets the ice box down near the fridge and looks towards his room, certain of where he would like to go but needing a little encouragement to get there. “So do we  - I mean, have we got some time to ourselves?”
Dad tops Sherlock’s height by perhaps an inch and sizes up to him. “Who exactly are you? What’s going on here?”
“Ah, well. We all have our crosses to bear. Do you want to know anything more about my final drug fiesta?”
Sherlock can feel the curiousity zapping from John’s skin. “An acquaintance of mine told me about it.”
Some of the gang members had been arrested. Some, I deduced, had already fled the country, and one was currently being pursued around London.
Night after night, the squelching wounds, blood spraying from each strike – John’s thoughts become more graphic and distressing. Eventually he finds himself tied and tethered like Sherlock was, and all he wants is to heal him.
“Sherlock, we’ve made you a little supper and a warm drink. Anya’s got a feed ready for Albion too. Isn’t it awful, Mr Holmes? Poor Sherlock! It’s just not safe anywhere anymore.”
While Mike stabbed me, Molly held Albion, resplendent in his first band aid (it had Pooh Bear on it). She spoke to me about her latest boyfriend whose name is either Francis, Phillip, Felix or Peter, but I was thinking simultaneously about my son’s safety in Molly’s arms and about a student John Watson learning to take blood with Mike Stamford twenty years ago. A Young Watson would have had the same laugh and the same smile but his hair would have been brighter and his trust would have been in tact and his heart unblemished in those early days.
Sherlock nods, considers two dozen things in the space of six seconds, then strides around until he finds a small nest of beer cans and cigarette butts in between several large crates. He tucks his hands in his pockets, for he has the evidence he needs, then turns back and addresses Lestrade directly: They’ve been drinking. Obvious. They’ve been called here for a specific purpose and ended up drinking, so they were waiting for a long time. There’s been a fight, he says, not a deliberate act of violence but an argument that ended with a single blow. The victim was at least on friendly terms with his assailant. They’ve sat together discussed commonalities, which is what lead to a disagreement. The offender hasn’t meant to kill him.
During the course of the labour I learnt that Adrienne was twenty two, and that her last name was Portelli. At least that’s what she told them. I would find out months later that no person of that name at that age lives in Great Britain.
There was nothing, apparently, that seemed difficult for her. She was curious, asked excellent questions and showed no fear of any topic. She absorbed information the way the ocean might take a ship.
“That’s what you called it, yes.” Sherlock tries a weak little smile. “Maybe you should have called it the Blind Consulting Detective.”
Sherlock waits  patiently on the  couch,  stretched  to  his  full  length,  hands  pressed  lightly
She drops it as he approaches and John, who has fought violent addicts in emergency wards, the Taliban, crazed villagers and his own troops on odd occasions when they lost their minds, can barely bring himself to look at it.
He hangs his arms over his eyes and feels them grow damp. He's never felt so alone, a cure for this emptiness has never seemed so unlikely.
"Man, that cat is tripping on you." Colin the warlock looked at John with renewed interest. "Cats are really psychic about these things. She can tell you're the right person."
It’s Jeremy who Sherlock wants to target. John calls Lestrade, because Jeremy is only sixteen. Sherlock paid scant attention as John went on and on about young people’s rights.
When the brothers are advised that Eurus will travel to Switzerland for an unspecified period of time, Sherlock breaks in to blubbering tears. “Nooooo,” he cries, “You mustn’t take my sister away from me!”  He throws his arms around her and holds on to her for dear life. Eurus returns the hug with complete satisfaction, smiling with her eyes closed, relishing the attention and the love.
A familiar yellow light on a lumbering black cab is heading towards them; John stretches out his arm and whistles loudly and distinctly.
"Police men and women," Lestrade corrects. "Okay. I'm not agreeing to it but I'm able to be persuaded. Explain to me exactly what has gone on, and then I'll decide if you can call him."
Mrs Hudson was another, and most immediate. She is a great advocate of popping in, and there was only so many time I could plead nakedness. (My record is three days, although I was actually naked that time. For science.)
Anya was a East German born citizen who boasted a PhD in aeronautical engineering and had, for a time, been a member of the Stasi.
Suddenly there were noises everywhere. I know now it was police coming to arrest her but at the time, still half asleep and crazed by love, I thought it was the army. She raised her gun and this time aimed for my heart.  I stepped back and fell against John who was roaring at her and she faltered for a split second, lost her aim and missed my abdominal aorta by millimetres.
Ludwig found the little girl fascinating. Her intelligence was so vast, and so capable, that he had to devise new tests to try and measure her gifts. She spoke only English, but after one week was able to carry on a good conversation in German, and within a fortnight had taught herself basic French. By the end of the month, she was conversational in both.
He’d hoped to keep his file private – it’s a little embarrassing – but was hardly surprised that Sherlock snuffed it out within hours.
“Oh, then she definitely has. Military training was compulsory for the East Germans.” John leaned forward so I could see Albion’s face. “Is he asleep?”
When I wasn’t wondering why I loved John Watson, I had physical therapy to restore the strength in my abdominal wall, and I had to attend a 12 step therapy program which I’d done before with some success.
“I didn’t. I didn’t know about the pregnancy until the day before. His mother came to my home and told me it was mine.”
John draws Sherlock closer, slipping his hand around his waist and turning him slightly so his face is brightened by the moon.
I remember too that we went back to Mrs Best, just a little while after Dad and I moved into Baker Street, and there were photos everywhere of a pretty little girl.
“In which case, I’m moving to your bed. Let’s merge our socks. At the moment, though, I’m hungry. I don’t suppose Additive Simblebowers taught you about the joys about post coitus carb loading, did he? Of course not.  I thought as much. I’m going to make us some toast and some – well, whatever I can find in the fridge that hasn’t come from the morgue.”
A short time later she calls out to Sherlock with a melodic voice. "Hoo hoo! Are you around Sherlock? I've made you some scones!"
“I had rather hoped to have you discuss it last night. Sherlock, as always, made that impossible. Adrienne is hoping to return to New York in he next twenty four hours.”
“It’s lovely to meet you, Anya,” I told her over Albion’s head. “I won’t be requiring your services at all.”
“Oh do shut up, Mycroft. No, I did not steal a baby and no, I didn’t buy one. I impregnated a girl in the crack house and she gave birth last week. She came back here, told me her boyfriend was going to kill me, stole the money and left me the baby. So I suppose in a way I did buy him, if in fact you can buy your own son.”
It is a far more interesting case than Sherlock expected. CCTV footage allowed him to deduce the suspect is a public school boy, and this was enforced by the latest victim’s recollections. Sherlock and John were able to view CCTV footage from previous robberies on Lestrade’s ipad and before it was finished, Sherlock was hailing a cab with John scrambling to keep up.
This is why, when he stood at my bathroom door that horrible evening, he knew he hadn’t caught John and me in the middle of some erotic sex game, but instead deduced immediately that John was doctoring, and that Albion and I were his patients.
John, always the soldier, draws a breath and waits for his courage to come back. It takes a couple of seconds.
My father took the gift of healing to Sherlock when he took the case, and Sherlock returned the gift by putting his faith in a story that had no room for faith.
The brothers greet their father with enthusiasm and affection. "Hello Papa!" He accepts embraces from both and generously kisses each head. They wait with great anticipation to see who he will address.
(Aunty Patty is my father’s twin. She is famous in my family for having twinsets in every conceivable colour and being insufferable. I have never heard her and Father speak with or about one another fondly. Nor have I seen her grandchildren although it is without query that Albion is infinitely more attractive.)
Life is full of disappointments. Sherlock had been certain that an explosion could only be the start of something big, that something or someone sinister was sending him a barely disguised message that he was on notice, and that the game, the real game, was on.
He sighs as he reads through the typed pages. It’s a common story – the child was dressed for an outing, and ran outside to collect the mail. She never returned. Her mother went out about six minutes later and the street was empty. A postman told police later that he had seen a dark coloured car in the street, but didn’t notice the make or in which direction it went. He didn’t see the child.
He played Schubert's Serenade and it made him wistful because it was actually made to be played to someone and Sherlock had lived alone for twelve years. It was highly probable that he
He looks at the nuclear green graphs on the ECG machine, "Well, the good news is, your heart is healthy."
John holds his gaze for a second and smiles. “I know. I just – I just don’t know how these parents could go on.”
“Definitely. This piece here” – I pointed a small collection of chubby letters – was written by a person who has English as their first language. This one” – I pointed the container stack on top – “is obviously written by a person whose primary language is French. Look at the way they’ve written the seven, and the accent on this e.”
Detective Inspector Lestrade had organised for blood samples to be taken at St Barts. Lestrade had, while making this arrangement, spoken to Molly, and also explained to her how I obtained a profoundly beautiful baby boy. This spared me not inconsiderable grief. I hate disappointing Molly.
John and Sherlock’s venture into romance was seamless. They knew each other so well, and had secretly guarded one another’s hearts for so long, that adapting to physical intimacy seemed like the most sensible progression.
John nods. “The brain just keeps bleeding and even if you treat it immediately, chances are the damage is already done, so the victim falls into a coma pretty quickly. This fella fell hard. I can smell alcohol on him – you say it’s connected?” he asks Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson didn’t want to hold Albion. I was not remotely surprised – Mrs Hudson is very motherly but not in the least maternal (and probably has no baby confidence). She was, however, very interested to hear about Adrienne.
“Technically yes, but in practice, no, they’re not. They’re young thugs who no one is taking the time to correct. I’m helping them” –
“I was captured by a group of henchmen who worked for a large criminal enterprise in Serbia. They beat me with chains and pipes to find out why I was trying to infiltrate them.”
So John watches Sherlock’s face reflected in the window as the cab inches across London Bridge. He knows he is being watched and won’t lift his eyes but it doesn’t matter. John knows the expression. It’s happiness, contentment, an expression Sherlock uses only when he’s sure that no one is watching.
I looked out at the black water that never stills, never stops travelling, always circulating around London in a perpetual rush.
“No. I am painfully aware of that, and frankly still hurt. But I figured you wanted me to read them, and the recipients were willing to let me keep them, either out of pity or kindness.”
John had painted the walls blue, the skirting boards white, and had used a stencil to make clouds on each wall. It was very cheerful.
“I think it’s phenomenal. But I’m probably not the best person to ask, given my only other real alleged sexual encounters were so pitiful my brain didn’t even bother to retain the fact that I had sex, let alone what it was like.”
Sherlock’s poetry has had an odd affect on John’s psyche. He expected everything from Sherlock except sentiment, and it seems Sherlock has, contrary to what he tells everyone, a heart brimming with the stuff.
Sherlock takes another deep breath and texts Molly to take the box to the roof. He can feel the anger radiating from John in hot waves.
Lestrade saw how worried I was. “Don’t let it upset you. Just be prepared. You’re a great parent. No one doubts that.”
“We can always do this another time,” Ademar reassures. “Go to your case, and come and see me tomorrow.”
“Every hospital notifies social services if they think the child might be at risk. Two drug using parents are a fairly standard reason for a flagging.”
“Apologies. Now, the Woodsman was a very honourable man. He gave his service to the Queen – that’s the stepmother – quite faithfully, and when she told him to murder the little girl, he just nodded and took the little girl to the forest.
“Shut up now. Enough squirrels. How long do you think we’ll be here? I have to be at the bank at two.”
He's standing at the entrance, wondering how on earth Sherlock - or indeed anyone - would know of this place. It smells of concrete and smoke and excrement and something dead. Like the other place, the walls are covered with graffiti and there are countless spray cans scattered all over the floor, their small silvery glints available to John as far as he can see. From the foyer area where he stands, John can see there are two - no, make that three - main floor spaces divided by plaster walls that have been gouged and kicked at for years.
“It’s all changed, “ I said out of nowhere. It had suddenly occurred to me. Everything was different now. I had never felt fear before, and never held someone’s welfare to be so important.
When John has read the poem three times, Sherlock appears with a mug of tea that grows cold as John sucks him off, his fingers pressing into his buttocks, squeezing in time to the long wet strokes.
“She knew I would hunt her down for Ollie, and that would have exposed her, him and the whole family. I think she planned to stick around for a few years and have the marriage break up naturally.”
I took them into my room, showed them his crib, his drawers of clothes, his small sock index (he only has six pairs, which isn’t really enough for a proper index), his nappies, his bed clothes and his Peter Rabbit bunny rug. Then I showed them the bathroom, his change table and the small inflatable bath I use to bath him on the change table. They asked if I ever left him in the bath alone or if I left him to cry.
“About three hundred quid.” Jeremy is squirming, wholly mortified to have been caught and to be made explain, in front of his mother and the police, what he has done and why.
“No. But who does, before they actually have one? In any case, friends and my brother have ably supported me. And there’s a wealth of information on the internet. And Albion is exceptional but no different from any other human, in that he needs to be fed and rested and kept clean. Also, he is extraordinarily gifted in communication. Just a couple of days ago he stared quite meaningfully at Doctor Watson’s breakfast to indicate to us that he was ready to eat solid foods. Some adults are unable to make their wishes so clear.”
Sherlock’s endures yet another stab to the heart. He loves orchestral performances. He adores dancing. He looks much better in red than this cheesy blonde.
Greg Lestrade, who had planned his police career from the age of six, is tired of arguing with Sherlock. They have just found the dead girl's mobile. Lestrade wants to bag the phone because it's evidence, Sherlock wants to make a call from it because it may bring him face-to-face with an entirely unpredictable drug-addled psychopath who splices throats with broken bottles.
His eyes pass over their lounge room until he spots Sherlock’s violin. Everything suddenly becomes precious and irreplaceable.
“For someone who doesn’t take relationships seriously, you have a surprisingly clear insight into their machinations.”
And then she showed me nine different videos of Toby doing precisely nothing in her flat. It was actually very interesting because I deduced Toby realised he was being filmed and didn’t protest, which illustrates clearly that I was still not one hundred per cent recovered because I can’t deduce what cats are thinking. No one can.
“He’s fine, Detective Inspector.” I lifted Albion slightly so he could touch Lestrade’s face. “Can we fit anyone else in here? Do any of you people understand how inappropriate it is for you all to be in here?”
“Well, the lab manager came back from lunch with a Woodsman, who was apparently an old friend of his.”
Sherlock is in a wonderful mood when he gets home. Ademar not only gave him some much-needed relief but also provided all kinds of helpful advice. There’s no shame, he told him. John is a wonderful person, it is no surprise you fell in love with him. Don’t be ashamed of yourself. Continue to love John, but concentrate on channeling that love into your friendship. Keep reminding yourself how important the friendship is to you. Focus on making your friendship stronger everyday. We’ll exorcise your physical yearnings for John here and soon they’ll start to fade. As your yearnings for John decrease, you’ll be able to start looking for a partner, a man with whom you can have a wholly fulfilling relationship. Come and see me whenever you want.
Until now I was certain these happy days were a reward for those periods of misery, but as Mycroft would say, the universe is rarely so lazy.
Sherlock recognises the that John is palpating his spleen and turns a little, making it easier. Do people do that, he is about to ask, should I be doing that to you but is diverted when he catches sight of the dog tags dangling over John's fine chest and then the mangled whorl of scar tissue on John's left shoulder.
The stranger grunts and looks very closely at John's face. It's as if, John would think later, he was cataloguing me.
"We've got Rhonda working with some of Alzheimer patients. We find that they remember pets of their own when she's with them, and of course some actually think she is a pet they knew once."
It wasn't easy. No one in their right mind would want to live with him but the fact remained that he felt lonely sometimes. Other people had friends. Even deplorable people had friends. Look at Anderson. He was odious. He found a friend, the bristly Sally Donovan, and they were enjoying a very profitable friendship indeed. It can't be that hard.
Sherlock adds this important interaction to his cache of John material: He helps, and then he lets the person he helps return the favour. Emotional intelligence -this man has lots. Why then is planning to shoot himself? Why isn't he seeking some help?
Sherlock was barely visible in all of these incidences, because they were so large, and so consuming for many people.
Albion and I sat at her kitchen table. This calmed him down a little. Mrs Hudson leaned over him and stared very carefully, so I moved his blanket to enable her see his perfect face clearly.
Downstairs, Sherlock heaved under the weight of his care. He was finalizing the conclusion that John’s heterosexuality left him in no man’s land and that he had little choice but to go back to being nothing, like he was before he met John.
"I'm teaching third and fourth year pathology. All bright young things, just like we were. I hate 'em. I heard you were in some foreign country being shot at. How'd that work out?"
The morning’s drama had exhausted Albion. He missed his normal feed and went straight to sleep as soon as John and I started talking.
“So the mirror started telling the wicked stepmother that Snow White was prettier. The wicked stepmother was an idiot, so she told her Woodsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and bring back her heart as proof of her death. Although in real life, the wicked stepmother would have done it herself. I’ve seen several murders by stepmothers, and they have all been very capable murderesses and not all that wicked on first meeting.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes as he rises from the chair.  “Yes, thank you for calling. Good luck with your ghost.” He leaves the consultation to John and moves nimbly to the kitchen, where he has underway some half-interesting experiment involving chewing gum and cleaning agents.
The hand is strong, thorough and unbelievably slow. John's never been pulled so slowly. He waits for the strokes to quicken, shifts under the slightly frustrating touch to try and speed it up but Sherlock pays no attention. John grows impatient after a couple of minutes but Sherlock doesn't change his tempo, just leans down and whispers relax, just relax, it'll take a bit of time but I promise it'll be good.
Corinne Best lives alone in a small flat in Hastings. She is 68, and walks with a heavy limp, because a small scratch on her leg was not addressed, and is now a weeping, ulcerated mess.  It took ages to see a doctor, so a local nurse visits every day to change the dressing.
Ms Briggs was taking furious notes. I could only make out every third word. Her penmanship was poor.
“He’s been punched in the face, then fallen backwards and fractured his skull. That a potentially fatal injury – am I right, Doctor Watson?”
John hates approximate diagnosis. He shrugs his shoulders. “Fifteen minutes if he was suffocating, two, maybe three hours if he died from the cranial injury.” He holds the cold head with his fingertips and turns it slightly. “For what it’s worth, I think he died from a combination of all three.”
Sherlock sat between Mycroft and Eurus, both of whom held his shaky hands as he recounted clearly, and with perfect chronology, what happened.
And then another door to a room in his head flies open and Sherlock rushes from the room where he thinks of John and storms in to the room where he's keeping the current case and stamps around in a frustrated fury, wondering how he might keep himself alive this time.
I also learnt that babies being born is not one of the most attractive ways in which the human condition makes itself known.
They push their bodies together with great urgency; John watches with glazed, adoring eyes as Sherlock holds his fingers to his lips and tenderly tastes each one, then leans in to kiss his scar over and over. You feel so good, John whispers, I love how you feel against me. Closer, darling, come here, and they stare into one another’s eyes as they align their hips and twine their legs. They rub their cocks together with perfect rhythm and as he comes, John imagines Sherlock blindfolded, moving his knowing hands over every inch of his body.
"You really are brothers?" John's surprised. They sound like brothers but the resemblance is hard to pick.
Ademar hands Sherlock a Wedgwood mug filled with hot tea and sits down opposite him. “So,” he starts. “Straight Boy Pain.”
“I’m your father,” I told him in a very quiet voice. “I play the violin and solve crimes. You can sleep in my lounge room when we get home.”
John, who's starting to rather like this odd ball, moves across the room to grab the lamp with the long extender neck so he can illuminate the wound. His white coat and jacket catch a little on the trolley.
When I came home to my flat, it still looked like nothing happened to the person who lived there but that was a relief to me then. I didn’t want anything to happen to me. Too much had happened to me and I was not entirely recovered from it.
When they get home the flat is dark and they don't speak, just push into each other's arms without a word and kiss deeply. Sherlock steps back, raises his eyebrows slightly and John nods with the smallest smile, follows Sherlock to his room and they leave their clothes in small heaps around the floor. Sherlock sits on the edge of his unmade bed, his lips parted and his breath already shallow while John runs his fingers along the small pleats that form on his lean belly. Then John kneels over him, so Sherlock inches back and they kiss like that, John on his lap, Sherlock's arms wound around him, pulling him in as close, both still scented with sandalwood and amber.
Rosie loves Mycroft. He makes time to visit as frequently as he can, and is there now, cross legged on one side of the little table, facing Rosie, as they carefully address a large wooden puzzle that will – soon – depict a dog carrying a bunch of flowers.
She  is  wrapping her  legs  around  him but it doesn't feel  sincere.  There  is  no  desire  or tenderness; it is acts she has read about or seen in films and the lack of depth of her feelings for him mean they are actions only and not the heartfelt responses he craves. Her unwashed skin smells of artificial musk and a close reproduction of white flowers; her breasts are squashy and feel shapeless under his hands. She is thrusting at him with a lewd, gasping sort of laugh and he jams his eyes closed and aims at the slippery warm wetness that must, he hopes, offer some kind of payoff for this charade. For a few seconds he thinks it might but his heart's not in it and his mind races for an image or memory of anyone he might actually desire.
And a pretty pet it is too. John is not much for ornithology but he estimates that the hot parrot is an African love bird. He'd be right.
Later, as Eurus sleeps,  Uncle Rudy gathers her garish drawings and posts them to a former client in Switzerland with a long letter, outlining his fears.
Sherlock smiles. “Oh, definitely. Except not at all, really. But they’re brave and very smart. And they make excellent doctors.”
“Well, you’re being your usual difficult self, like now – which incidentally can be very alluring sometimes – and you’re having a bath” - Sherlock’s eyes widen slightly – “and you’re all sore from running around all day, and you’re naked, well, obviously because you’re in the bath, and you’ve called me to wash your back and I’m kneeling beside you –“
“Because the computer fell in love with the pretty lady and wrote her poetry. It’s nice to think that a machine could fall in love with a woman and try to woo her.”
Soon John found himself a job at as a prison doctor which was unusual, considering the kind of work he did with Sherlock. It was also sensible, because he worked only three days a week and made four pounds a week more than he did for a full week at the clinic. He liked the work and the prisoners liked him because he was fair and straightforward and an extremely capable clinician.
"Great." He turns to the Rhonda who sits in the hamper with her back turned to him resolutely. "Thanks for that."
I would have drowned – which I sometimes think might have saved a lot of people much heartache, inconvenience and/or dullness - but for the nine year old warrior that was Mycroft, who saw me fall in and jumped, fully dressed, to haul me from the bottom.
She also wanted me to eat stew for breakfast, which was a task beyond my physical capabilities. I like to start the day with hot liquids (tea) and move on to something small and starchy (toast, although I am partial to a small bowl of oats and brown sugar sometimes) about thirty minutes after tea.
I didn’t remember her name when I first saw her. In fact I remembered very little about her aside from the fact she offered to unpick my stitches with her nail file.
A few weeks earlier he had mentioned to Mike Stamford that he would like a flatmate. Because Mike likes to help, and because he likes crosswords, Sherlock sought to make the quest challenging and a little sad by adding that no one would want to live with him. It was a waste of human endeavour because Mike hadn't come up with anyone. Sherlock was pretty certain that he didn't even try.
Sherlock knows better than most people just how many things need to be organised in order to have a successful wedding, which is why he whinges to Mycroft to find someone to do it for him.
Sherlock, who right about now would be flinging himself off the top of St Barts if John walked through the park two years ago, has been responsible for a lot of things happening to John.
He studied all the customers’ clothes and the way the way the handed over the money and how they spoke to each other and he got very good at deducing.”
Sally and Lestrade moved immediately. I heard the handcuffs clicking into place while I closed my eyes and breathed in the delicate scent of Albion’s hair, only looking up when I heard the large crystalline shatter of a bottle hitting the cold floor. It made us both jump.
She's grateful for an ally and saddened by John's inability to catch his own food, so occasionally will bring him presents. Today it is a little wood mouse with a victim complex.
That next morning, Sherlock makes Rosie her porridge, and John boils eggs. There is a pot of tea already on the table,  and across the room the plans and maps lay where they left them last night. Sherlock chatters with Rosie about nursery school, and what she might do today. John gives Sherlock an egg, and squeezes his shoulder for the warmest, smallest second.
“You will love John Watson, if he ever comes home. He had a little baby too, a girl baby called Ollie who Social Services came and took from him because his wife was – well, she was wicked. Worse than any stepmother. It was her fault they took Ollie away. I didn’t realise how bad that would be until I held you. When you have a baby, the last thing you want is for someone to take it from you. It made John Watson very heartsick, and he waited with me in hospital because his wife shot me, and then he had to take a very long walk to get better. He’s still walking.
Then there's some photos but he doesn't really want to look at them. He knows who's there, he knows what happened to them, he feels their absence or their departure very keenly every day.
“I’m telling you now. Shut up. The Prince made up some ludicrous hypothesis about studying the properties of saponification with a view to creating synthetic fats that would produce very concentrated commercial soaps and at the same time followed Victor around, hoping he might notice him.”
When he’s finished, John looks at Sherlock with a shy smile. It’s hard to know what to say, because being the centre of Sherlock’s attention in this way is very new.
days or if he only just remembered now. As if he can extract his thoughts through his skin, Sherlock releases John slowly and looks up with a glazed mouth. "I've been waiting for ten days. Now stop thinking and just relax."
“Oh, right.” She then looked around the flat, as if was vaguely familiar. I’d deleted how entirely uninterested she was in anything.
The import case was not particularly stimulating – I’d give it  6.3 on my how-interesting-is that-crime scale – but I was impressed by the sheer size of the operation. It involved three separate criminal gangs who had joined forces and rented warehouse space near the docklands area to store and distribute their product.
"Me too," lies Sherlock, who almost never feels like eating after he's solved an important crime. "I know an excellent Italian place near here." He turns to Mycroft. "John and I are having dinner. I bid you good night, Mycroft." But he doesn't leave, instead leans in to his big brother and talks in a hush, indicating the pretty texting woman with a dip of his head. "What are they talking about?"
I lifted my boy from his little nest of blankets and nuzzled his temple. “You are truly are quite exceptional, you know.” Albion grizzled his greeting and pushed his fat little paw against my lips. He likes to catch the words as soon as they come out of my mouth.
“It’s actually very easy,” I assured him. “You’re designed to be able to do this, so you can then progress to crawling and walking.” I stretched my face up a little. “Like this. See?”
I use this tedious story to illustrate the fact that a lot of seemingly untrue things actually happen to me, which is why Mycroft, more often than not, will give me the benefit of the doubt.
Mike Stamford – who I have deduced to be admiring of Molly from a far for many years – was sitting at the bench. I have known Mike for years too. We’re not friends but I love him dearly because he introduced me to two medical degrees Watson. They had been students together and more recently were known to go to the pub together to watch Rugby games.
He is living in the sex house. Charlotte and the Warlock never stop. John hears furniture thumping and rattling in the unmistakable rhythm & wails of copulation in the morning, in the evening, in the middle of the day on Saturdays when he just wants to do his washing, at night when he is watching videos of soldiers coming home to their teary families and hysterical dogs on You Tube, in the middle of the night when he might be having a small stretch of purposeful sleep unaffected by nightmares.
He grew tired of thinking about taps and tap-related injuries so as he dried and dressed, he wandered amongst his lists of personal pleasures and stopped at Schubert.
I consulted Albion for his views. “Do you want to come with John and I to a boring cold warehouse full of seized narcotics?” He swung his legs and cooed at me, which was clearly a delighted affirmative.
Sherlock was good on his promise. He wrote to his sister from the airport, again from the plane, as soon as he got home and from the shore of the beach where they played, so Eurus got four letters in her first week.
“Who’s coming up the stairs?” John wondered as someone with a heavy step made their way to the door.
This was the kiss we had been waiting for. It was very warm, and very soft, and with it came the overwhelming realisation that this was it. This was him, in my arms, with nothing at all to come between us. There was nothing we didn’t know about each other. It felt like we had watched each other across a highway of never ending traffic for five years and now all the traffic had gone and we could reach other effortlessly.
It grates John. He lays awake in bed at night, reliving Mary, reliving Moriarty, reliving all the people who have tried to wrench he and Sherlock apart.
John and Sherlock are standing in freezing winds at a large factory down near Hastings. It’s 10.12pm. They hired a car because Sherlock insisted they had to get there tonight so he could count the security guards and make some odd calculations that he is certain will help him solve the mystery of the four armed robberies he read about in the paper.
They both know it will fall into place, piece by small piece. They make plans for the future privately and end up sharing them because they work best like that. John will cut back his hours and eventually leave the clinic so he can work full time with Sherlock who in turn is still half mad, half brilliant, always dazzling John with his fabulous mind. There will be soda bread and tantrums and laughter but there will be no doubt for either of them that each is loved and esteemed as he always hoped he might be.
“But the pretty lady turned out to be a bad person. She lied to everyone, shot the Prince twice and betrayed the Woodsman in the most awful way possible. She had a baby but “_
Eddie disagreed entirely that I was high functioning sociopath and insisted that all I had to do was work out how to love people and I’d be fine. Relatively.
"Now what? Turn around. I've got another thirty six to pluck." When John doesn't move, Sherlock gets impatient. "What?"
“He didn’t realise he was lonely. He didn’t have a heart. He thought everyone was born without a heart and that they experienced things the same way he did. He couldn’t work out why they all went to parties and regattas and balls.”
John laughed. “I’m not trying to embarrass you. I just want to be sure that you’re okay with me staying, and that you’re happy.”
Everything, thinks John, everything. It comes to him every so often when he least expects it. It's too many things to put into words and too many wonderful things for one person in one life time. Some times he feels like his heart is too full.
He moves over the bed on his knees, opens the flip top lid with his teeth and squeezes heavy cool puddles of hair conditioner over John’s cock and belly.
Uncle Myc took a couple of steps towards me, opened his mouth and left it hanging, unable to say anything.
Everyone rolled their eyes at me (except Albion, who just gurgled when I kissed his fat little cheek) and set about their respective tasks.
fulfill them through other people. In that respect Sherlock and John could not have chosen more wisely.
The stress of the arrest has dislodged the murderous cabbie's aneurysm and he expires in a greying heap as the large gelatinous clot bursts in his brain.
Greg looks at Sherlock, who has given given any indication that he knows Greg is here. He addresses Greg without moving his eyes from the lens while simultaneously lifting his phone from his pocket.
“Why are you here?” Sherlock says when he answers the door. His eyes pass over her quickly and the deductions rise through his brain like bubbles in champagne.
It was odd to be in a suit, and odd to be among very familiar people who were all looking at me strangely because they could not fathom how I became a father.
“I had no idea. I didn’t think I’d fit in with you both. I thought you’d prefer to have Albion to yourself.”
John, the evidence suggested, actually wasn’t inclined to love Sherlock, at least not in the manner Sherlock desired.
I raise that trivial point to give context to the abject fear I felt when the Mesdames Powers and Briggs came into my flat. My heart was pounding and  thin drools of sweat ran down my spine. It was a terror that I still can’t describe adequately.
“No offence, but it’s the mother’s fault,” the tall man said in the second conference. Ludwig chaired the meeting, Uncle Rudy was there, as were one the nurses who tended Eurus, a visiting French child psychiatrist who was enchanted with the child’s abundant gifts, and Mummy herself.
My son wasn’t ready to address the court and turned back to me, hiding his face in my neck and making do with my hair.
There's Sherlock, pushed up against the wall, hands flat on either side, facing a taller, thick set man who tears Sherlock's scarf from his throat and tosses it to the ground.
"Well, I rather ..." but Sherlock thinks the better of it. Billy, though, can hear the pain in Sherlock’s voice.
John shakes his head as he closes the third stitch. "Nothing special. Your tongue seems to be getting better. "
Having a nanny turned out to have many benefits, most of them for me: I got to have a shower every day and had time to enjoy the quotidian details -  make a cup of tea, take telephone calls, work out some things I could do with the bottle steriliser when Albion didn’t need it any more.
"No, but I know I know I don't need tetanus. I'll take the penicillin though. What are -" but Sherlock is interrupted by a young resident medico with a pained expression.
"Bye Bob." Sherlock, never one for sedatives, is already out the door. Bob watches the handsome navy suit disappear into the crowds.
John leans in and lowers his voice, carefully placing his fingers on Sherlock’s chest and seeking out the buttons, opening each one slowly as he whispers.  “And I wash your back and you’re complaining, but gradually you calm down, and I slip the wash cloth around to your chest, and then stroke your neck, and you flex up so I can see how broad your chest is, and I can feel your biceps, then you turn around all dripping and soft and kiss me.”
I knew nothing of he sort. John Watson seemed farther away from me than he’d been before we met.  It seemed pointless to say this so I just gave her a kind smile. “Say hello to Toby for me.”
He lies there quite still, and his first thought is that the wall must have got in first. Plaster dust settles around him and shards of glass glitter all through the carpet. When his hearing has settled and he can tell that he is not wounded or even slightly hurt, he feels a delicious flash of excitement spark in every vein.
He cooks a quiche, a tray of brownies and a large serving of peas, all of which he packs carefully in plastic dishes that he stacks in a box that was once used to transport two lungs and a kidney. He buys a thermos especially for tea, pours milk into an old jam jar that he closes with a satisfying wringing and packs it alongside two tea cups wrapped in a tea towel that he stole from Mrs Hudson.
He was teaching me too, just when I thought I knew everything there was nothing else to know about people.
Sherlock actually shudders. "No wonder you're depressed. Come with me. It can't be any worse. You can always attend to your - issues - afterwards."
Caroline talks about celebrities and television programs all the way to the restaurant. John has no idea who’s she’s talking about or why she is so obsessed with the tedious, possibly false, details of their life. He is thinking only of Sherlock, and his complete lack of interest in John’s love life.
“It’s special, this,” John stutters, his open hand moving back and forth between them. “It’s  - we have something good. We should do something.”
Mike Stamford is waiting near gate three. He stands with a boy about eleven in a Harlequin jersey, a reserved boy who has a mop of loose curls and thick glasses.
John shook his head. “I should have clarified – this client has a ghost.”  He expected a look of disdain but Greg’s face didn’t change.
After I settled him in his crib, I went on line to get some more formula and nappies. I wondered how long he’d stay in newborn nappies.  I wondered too about the formula - it bothered me a little. Obviously it would have been far more beneficial for him to be breastfed but even I have my limits.
The good uncle leaves the study and walks through the grand old house to talk with Eurus. He finds her on her bedroom floor, drawing yet another set of gaudy pictures that depict Sherlock being killed variously with spears, nooses and tractors.
Would it be alright if loved John Watson and never knew the reasons why? Would I love him better, and more authentically, if I understood why I loved him?
I threw up on and off for twelve hours. In the end I was just making the noises because there was not a scrape of anything in my stomach to bring up. Even my bile duct had got bored with the constant upheaval and stopped producing anything to be expelled. I was vomiting air.
They went back to her place in a cab where he kissed her first. She tasted of wine and a mint and some unidentifiable sourness that occurs in mouths as the small subtle stages of degradation simmer away in the digestive tract. Her mouth was surprisingly firm, her tongue was stiff and clogged his mouth.
I loved listening to his tiny breaths in the dark and I loved his little cry at three in the morning. Those early morning feeds were magic, just the two of us alone in a dark world. Sometimes I wished we could stay like that forever.
Sherlock eases onto his back as John gets on his knees, lifting Sherlock’s leg over his shoulder, stamping kisses all the way to his balls, rolling his lips over the soft creases, pressing his thumb over the crumpled opening. Sherlock loses count of the different kinds of pleasure John can make and bites his bottom lip in giddy anticipation as John takes him in his mouth.
“I understand,” she says. She speaks with resignation, the voice of a woman who has held on to hope until it crumbled in her hands.
“I don’t think he’s better yet. He’s sending postcards to all our friends so that I know he’s alright. One day he might send one to me and when he does I’ll know he’s better and that he’s coming home. You’ll love him as soon as you meet him. He’ll teach you to fire a gun, when you’re older obviously, and to cull boars, if  you really want to do that kind of thing.”
John, who hates treating attempted suicides more than any other ailment, has made up his mind to blow off the back of his head and now finds everything much easier.
I have the gift of good parenting, and in that gift find the gifts that Dad has brought to Sherlock, and the gift of life Sherlock gave to him when he was back from war, bereft of giving and trusting no one any more.
“I hate to say this, but we should ask Mycroft, and get Greg here too. Mycroft can access the electoral roles, and NHS numbers if need be, to help find someone. Greg can maybe talk to the police who worked on the case, if any are still alive.”
Sherlock’s tender heart may not have been so scored had Victor been around, but little Redbeard was already at boarding school and could not be persuaded to write as frequently as Sherlock would like. Still, Easter was coming, and Eurus would come home for two weeks, and Victor would be home for one week. The upcoming break lit up Sherlock’ landscape like an approaching meteor. He made a collage from an old calendar, spent hours on the floor with scissors and paste and his new coloured pencils.  Around the April 4th , Easter Thursday  that year, he drew big yellow orbs and pasted pictures of happy people he found in magazines.
I was thrilled to see that John Watson looked very well. His skin was clear and smooth and his eyes quite bright.
“Pelicans are the symbol of piety. Its based on the popular myth that if a pelican mother can’t find food for her chicks, she pierces her breast with her beak and lets her babies drink her blood.”
He also hates the MI6 agent because he has ruined Sherlock's insouciant near-nakedness by bringing clothes that Sherlock has to wear, although no one can give him a definitive reason why. In a way Sherlock is rather chuffed to be at Buckingham Palace and rather chuffed to be the only person (probably) who attended Court wearing just a bed sheet. Not Mycroft, the MI6 agent or the Monarchy can take that away from him. It's an accolade, Sherlock thinks sourly as he buttons his shirt, that should be shared with a friend. If Anderson had the gumption, wit, genius and connections to get into Buckingham Palace in a bed sheet, he'd be able to talk about it with Sally.
Albion wore a very attractive and warm one piece jump suit. There were trains on the arms. I’d added a hat and little knitted shoes that actually looked like socks. I didn’t have any mittens for him, but I did have an excellent sleeping bag that zipped up and made him look exactly like cricket larvae.
Mrs Best nods. “They were brand new. I’d bought them only a two days before.” She takes another deep, sad breath before the dark cold space that surrounds her. “I brought them half a size too big, because she was growing so fast…the lady in the shoe shop said she would grow into them soon enough. That’s why she lost one, I suppose, it came loose because it was a little too big.”
“That was a long time ago, and if I’d had a better understanding of the situation – if someone had been thoughtful enough to keep me advised – I wouldn’t have said it.”
“Unusual perhaps, but not weird. No one would be remotely surprised if the roles were reversed and it was a man who wouldn’t bother with a child he fathered.”
“It was his heart, which he never knew was there until he met the Woodsman. And the evil Prince threatened to burn it out.”
John yawned again and made his way to the kitchen. “I’m going to make an early breakfast. I’m starving. You want something?”
John flops on his back, giggling behind his knuckles when Sherlock returns with a bottle of hair conditioner.
She points to a low cabinet near the television, and Lestrade, the only person not holding a leg or toddler, goes over to retrieve it. The little dog goes with him, still growling.
Mrs Best wanders though the memory again as she recounts the events around the disappearance. It is a structure now, not a memory of an seemingly uneventful day. Every dish on the table, every glint of light, every movement is now set in concrete and she relays it piece by piece, a static scene that culminates in the child’s disappearance, which from that point, in her absence, becomes black and cold.
The flinching annoyed John. The thought of being restrained from touching Sherlock’s back made him touch it more.
This arrangement worked very nicely except for a brief squalling moment when Albion though I was taking his half-finished bottle from him forever.
forceps, a local anaesthetic and a tank of oxygen, has wandered the streets of London for nearly six hours. He has crossed the suicide bridge over Archway Road, pausing briefly to look through the wire at the City and at the streams of traffic below, struggled through the Saturday crowds of Camden, sat on the edge of a seat on the 34 bus, walked alongside Hyde Park and over to Bayswater Road, through to Marble Arch and along the tailbone of Oxford Street.
Blowing a raspberry on a wriggling pink tummy is not as simple as it sounds. It took me three attempts to get it right.
He slumps back on the floral pillow, exhausted, ashamed and full of loathing. Shona lays heavily next to him, snoring softly with the tiniest growl on each exhale. John pushes her shoulder gently and she shifts slightly, the growl reduced to gentle puffs.
Sherlock pounces. “What’s wrong with the hospital? Are you worried about running into Mike Stamford? I can get Mycroft to orchestrate his transfer to the outer Hebrides.”
I was delighted. He had deduced that he was in an element different from air, and he sought to discover what the element tasted like. I was convinced he was a genius, but only because until that point he couldn’t do anything unaided at all, except stare at wallpaper.
He curls up on his bed, jams his head under the pillow, closes his eyes and hopes that when he wakes up everything, including him, will be gone.
Sherlock takes a couple of shy steps towards him, perhaps summoning his nerve. "Make yourself at home," he suggests and John watches him carefully, nods just once so very slightly. Sherlock pushes him up against the wall and kisses him hard and gracelessly.
John answered first. “I did not.” Albion was trying valiantly to grip his hair and was passed back to me.
We laughed again. I didn’t know if I should undo his flies, or mine, or what to do, so I left it for the time being and enjoyed the access he allowed me to his chest.
My heart did something strange as I watched him. It moved, actually moved, something like a flip, something strong and pulsing.
The archive storage facility is a huge grey warehouse filled with kilometres of shelving racks, home to more than six hundred thousand files.
“After about six months it seems like forever.” John was spooning tea leaves in the pot. “Does Anya come on Mondays?”
When they get close to the hospital, John fishes a twenty pound note from his pocket and turns to the stranger again. "Okay, you're going to have fib a bit."
“I had too! John has never asked me for anything, except to not be dead, but obviously I wasn’t able to do that at the time because I had to save his life. But to be his best man – there is no way I would have refused him. I  - he was very hurt when I faked my death. More hurt than I ever imagined. I didn’t realise that until I saw him again. I had to make it up to him. He was furious. I was terrified I would never see him again.” Sherlock stops, baulks at how much he is sharing, but when he tries reign himself in realises how much better he feels. It’s miraculous, so he continues. “I can’t accept a life where John Watson isn’t my friend, so I did what ever I could to show him that. I wanted his wedding to be perfect. I wanted him to know that what made him happy made me happy.”
It was quiet for a few seconds. I have no idea what she does in there but I am certain it would surprise me.
The leg hurts, and the bandage is uncomfortable. The thought of someone relieving that tight bandage is welcome, and Mrs Best agrees.
The nurse was exhausted and didn’t care. He had worked a fourteen hour shift and had not taken a meal break. He had to get public transport to work and he hadn’t had time to do his washing.
The factory where Sherlock is currently confronting the Broken Beer Bottle Killer has recently been sold after languishing on the market for years. The hopeful owner is planning to raze the entire structure and build a series of nondescript houses that he can sell at a staggering profit but to date his plans are being wilfully ignored, languishing unopened in an inbox in the local Council.
When there was a knock at the door just after six , I thought it would have to be the delivery person but it was Detective Inspector Lestrade.
“The suits are very plain, straight cut from black merino wool.  We will be the belles of the ball. . And the photos will be perfect. Stop looking at me as if I’m planning your execution. It will all be FINE. Now tell me what will be in your speech.”
“I don’t want to see what I remember. I want to see her, as she is now, before I bury her. I want to see her one last time.”
“And you don’t eat and you don’t sleep. And you’re wound up like a ball of electrical wire. And you’re still recovering from your  - the hiatus.”
I silently thanked my stars that I had not been to seen Molly for a while and that there were no intestines in the fridge.
John smears some jam on a muffin. “I suppose this could all turn into nothing too. I mean, we have the Dream Lady’s claims, but it could all be a big coincidence.”
“Not strange, no. I might worry that it mightn’t be enough for you and you’ll run off with someone who doesn’t try to index your socks, but that’s my problem, not yours.”
Which gives him a couple of hours to walk down to the High Street and pick up some things for Rhonda.
There's a huge brass knocker cast in the shape of a lion flush in the middle of the door and small black door bell to the right.
Children aren’t easy to raise, relationships are relentless hard work, but the delight they cause me outweighs every disadvantage - John when he reaches out for me in his sleep, Bonnie when she stops in the park to show me a flower or Albion, when he comes home from Preschool with another impossible-to-decipher painting that he made just for us. (A couple of weeks ago his teacher told the class to paint something blue and red: my brilliant boy painted Doctor Watson in scrubs, holding a liver with the artery still attached. I’ve had it framed.)
The sit together on the floor, facing one another, with a map of London between them on one side, and the plans of the house of the other.
Sherlock has been awake for several hours and is covering his severed head with a couple of tea towels when he hears John stirring - little creaks on the floor boards, the low rustle of sheets, then the stillness of a man who realises he has nothing to wear except yesterday's clothes.
The destitute property, which was once a thriving factory that employed 140 people, has sheltered all manners of petty crime as well as the occasional substantial crime. In a bird-brained
Sherlock sits back, puzzled and determined. “John, I don’t know exactly what happened. I am surmising that if Julia is responsible – and yes, I think she is – that she dropped her boss at the airport, drove to Mrs Best’s flat here for what ever reason, and saw the child, and then, for whatever reason, took her and killed her. She was seen at work as normal, so she has had to have disposed of the child very quickly. To my mind, it would be quicker to do so at the Wridges office. To have tried to kill and dispose of a child in the early morning traffic on Easter Thursday would have been onerous. And obvious.”
John Watson is short and blond and smiles mildly when he’s about to break your jaw. He looks like a man who got lost in British Homes Stores while looking for the sleepwear section  but he is, in fact,  an incredibly passionate man with a continual rage on a low heat at all times and carrying a loaded gun. Fire him up and he bursts into flames.
If someone had asked me yesterday if I wanted to sit and watch a baby I would have insulted them and walked away. Today there was nothing in the world I wanted more.
John is just about to get on the tube when he gets his first text poem. It starts with a single line, then each couplet sent is sent separately at precise sixty second intervals:
Sherlock nods. “I know how badly the jump affected you and if you want me to keep saying sorry I will, but I jumped so you could keep your life. And you had your life and you did the things live people do - had a respectable job, got married, albeit to a most undeserving wench but that’s not what we’re here to discuss. What I’m trying to say – badly – is that I want you to keep having a life. I want to be a part of it. Barts is part of our life, and it was part of your life before I met you. I understand that you can’t reciprocate my feelings, but don’t let the whole wretched thing we lived through keep poisoning you.”
Sherlock is spooning tea leaves into the pot. “No. You wanted a public declaration and I am determined to give you one. In any case, people who turn up at weddings make investments, John, and they expect a return.”
There's the murderer, mouth wide open and his oddly white teeth catching the light. Cosmetic surgery, thinks John, whose heart beat hasn't raised a step as he carefully aims for the teeth and turns his hand slightly to ensure the correct trajectory.
So it was a difficult time for Sherlock, whose every impression made such a deep impact on his luminous, sensitive psyche: he saw his older brother the preferred confidant for Rudy, he saw his younger sister admired for the exceptional creature she was, and the focus of his parents’ attention. He saw his best friend killed, and only months later was sent to school.
A hot flare of affection bursts in his belly when he opens it, for Sherlock has not only inspected the slim anthology, he’s added a new poem:
John lifts his chin and accepts the challenge, stretching his hand to Sherlock and walking with him to his bedroom.
John smiles as the poem predicted he would, smiles at the sentiment and smiles at the thought that all Sherlock might think of is him.
Fourth, he wanted to be a considerate suicide and not leave any mess - physical or otherwise - for anyone to clean up. That means packing up his room.
He turned off the light and closed the curtains so I could see the phosphorescent stars he had adhered to the ceiling. Thus Doctor Watson had made Albion’s nursery a visual lesson in night and day.
"No, I made certain he fried." Sherlock is twisting the key to the door of his flat and opens it wide, ushering John in ahead of him.
John stays in the shadows, still and silent, waiting for the right moment to walk away, hands in pockets, as if he is just passing through.
I was still shopping on line when Adrienne called me the next morning to see if I had the money. I’d forgotten all about it, which isn’t like me.
“She fell at the scene. Her shoes were loose, her mother told us that. She has been called over to the car, got close, but something spooked her and she’s stepped back, and hit her head hard on the wall. That would account for her injury, and why no one heard her being taken.”
“But why would she go to Mrs Best’s home in the first place? She’s got the husband to herself, why would she go to see the wife?”
Albion had been crying consistently all night for about three months. There was no cure, nothing other than cosmetic remedies that lasted an hour or so. We tried them all anyway because you never know: lavender oil, warm baths, a strict routine, a lax routine, no routine, loose bed clothes, swaddling, gentle patting, being rocked to sleep in our bed, being rocked to sleep in his crib – all to no avail. Come night time, Albion was disappointed in everything.
“That doesn’t mean they don’t need to know.  What? It’s actually extremely interesting.” He is unblinking, earnest, utterly guileless and for a second John is filled with crippling, protective love.
“Sherlock! Hello Mrs H. Anya. John, you hero. Mycroft.” Lestrade made his way through the crowd, stepped right up to the tub and peered down at me. Albion reached both chubby little fists up to him.
Because my life is never normal and never just one thing at a time, our new relationship was the least of our problems when I woke up a few hours later. John was leaning over me, one finger pressed to his lips to keep me quiet. It was raining very heavily and there were noises in the kitchen.
“Thank God you’re back,” Sherlock sighs when he walks though the door, eyes all over him, deducing every millimeter. Why has he been to Boots? Lubricants? Massage oil? “Did you think about me today?”
Mike rests his hand on his son’s shoulder. “Sherlock texted me during the week to tell me there were enough seats.”
I caught his eye in the midst of the political unrest that was unfolding in my living room. “Welcome home,” I said with my whole heart.
“So you are both committed to his parenting. I wish every child I met was cared for so lovingly. My congratulations to you both.”
He started with the story of Jennifer Bannister who couldn’t sleep, and the gift of attention my father gave her when she first visited.
“It’s very becoming,” Detective Inspector Lestrade says, not at all surprised. “So. You got time for an aggravated robbery?”
John is stroking the fine cheekbones and watching Sherlock’s mental activity blaze in his exquisite eyes. “What are you thinking?”
To the side there is a drive way, which is closed by a large metal gate. Beyond the gate, Sherlock can see a large concrete slab that now covers where the glass house  stood. What used to be well kept lawns are now a mass of ill-shaped overgrown weeds. Only the pagoda, dilapidated old thing it is, still stands.
“On the projector.” Mummy takes a deep breath.  “Now. The doctors have told me that you have been sad because when you were a tiny baby, I was busy writing a book and didn’t bond with you the way I should’ve. They’ve said that you have a very high intelligence, and a very sensitive heart, and this means you need as much love and attention as you do intellectual stimulation.”
This was a ruse, for when I emerged twenty minutes later, clean and dressed and ready to hear John Watson’s litany of pitiful excuses, he was no where to be found.
He was unconcerned. “Just an army thing. You always do it when you meet a soldier from another country, particularly if there’s been hostility between the countries in the past. We were just letting each other know that we couldn’t be bullied.”
“Thank you. Now please take this opportunity to have a shower. You smell like a farm animal and I will not have my nephew subjected to that.”
Sherlock decides there are only two outcomes. “The child would have to have been abducted, otherwise, why would her shoe be found? She was taken quickly, by someone who probably didn’t notice or care she’d lost a shoe. So it remains that she was either taken by someone she knew, or a stranger.”
"Definitely. He'd know that he was badly injured, he wouldn't be able to make any noise because his trachea is crushed, and his blood pressure would be dropping very rapidly because the blood is spurting out."
His mother, meanwhile, was sound asleep. The nurse checked her pulse, shrugged his shoulders and left me to it.
Anya was apparently rebuilding my kitchen if the clattering she caused was any indication. I deposited Albion with Mycroft, considered starting an argument with him about the nanny but deferred because it was actually brilliant to have some one to assist, and also I hadn’t had a shower for two days.
He was still wide awake in the same bundled position at four forty-three the next morning. He had concluded nothing more except that he loved John, was pained by this love and wanted more than anything to remain John’s best friend as long as he could, before he was usurped by the next dangerous woman who would drive John to despair as easily as Mary had.
The mouse, it turns out, is fine, just utterly resigned to the futility of life. John picks it up carefully and, as far as his medical skills allow, can see no injury or even trauma. He wonders if the mouse didn't just throw itself in the path of Rhonda in a deliberate attempt at self harm.
“He needs his own room. Actually he doesn’t, but we do. One of us is going to end up in a wheelchair if we keep screwing on the floor.”
“Only you would have a kid that matches the décor. But look, I’ve got to talk to you about social services.”
On Saturday morning, while Sherlock is pacing his flat in his pyjamas trying to work out why he hasn't caught the Broken Beer Bottle Killer, John is carefully preparing the cat cage.
“In some respects I think you’re like a squirrel, yes. Actually I could make a Venn diagram about you and squirrels if” –
“I met a girl the last time I was in the crack house. We shared our stash. I apparently impregnated her. She turned up a couple of days ago, gave birth and stole eighty thousand pounds and my cigarette lighter. She left my baby here.”
It’s not a great case – Sherlock tagged it a 6 - but it’s mildly interesting and alleviates (somewhat) the frustration of Lestrade’s continued refusal to share the mystery of the four armed robberies.
“He’s my best friend who is walking around the world. He is a soldier and a doctor. I’m in love with him.”
clenched fists and a face marbled with rage, ready to reduce Sherlock to grain if he could only reach him. Papa nodded approvingly.
He takes a sharp breath. Ademar didn’t prepare him for this at all, it seems. “I don’t think I’m going to last very long.”
The house is large and littered with abundant evidence of children - pieces of Lego, plastic cars, a half naked Barbie with small scribbles of coloured biro on her face, DVD covers and lots of small coloured trainers.
Sherlock waited patiently for romance to blossom. He had no idea how to start a relationship but had complete faith in John doing that because John knows those kinds of things. He can plaster broken limbs, fix loose hinges and conceal small lethal pieces of metal in his trousers. John, Sherlock was certain,  would surely know how to initiate the first kiss and get them underway to a lifetime of cosy late night cuddling, blissful comforting oral sex and occasional frottage in the shower.  Sherlock could wait.
The next night when he comes there is only a quick glance and instant understanding. Sherlock silently rolls over and lifts his shirt himself. The poultice is different tonight.
"You're not poisoning anyone. I haven't seen him for fifteen years. Even if he'd asked me, I'd never would have agreed to meet anyone he thought I should live with."
He arrives home that night with a vast bunch of varicoloured roses and finds Sherlock in the kitchen, cooking dinner.
Sherlock’s breath grows shallow and he tips his face back. This is what he imagined it would be like if John were to touch him. John would be confident and wise and handle him with perfect pressure because he’s a doctor and has a penis of his own and knows what feels good. Sherlock trembles slightly as his underpants are tugged down his thighs and his lips part, wettened by his tongue as the skilled hands stroke his expanding erection to full capacity. He cries out softly when he feels Ademar’s mouth, still warm from the tea, slide over the tip and suck deftly at the delicate folds of his foreskin.
I was in hospital (or whatever they call it) for  a total of four months and three weeks. I understand the British Government paid my bills because (I deduced) Mycroft had represented my addiction and mental instability as being symptomatic of the work I did while I was dead and then having to come home and (theoretically) kill Moriarty, who is a marginally (alright, somewhat) interesting criminal with fabulous dress sense, a second time.
“It doesn’t matter. A child disappears, they should do everything to find them. In some of these older cases, police didn’t interview anyone for a week. They searched drains and parks, but didn’t actually talk to someone who may have helped find the child. Meanwhile someone else was busy perhaps disposing of a body and destroying any associated evidence.”
He seems to know what’s inside and takes the oversized foam container that is sitting on her doorstep.
Sherlock waited until John was at work and checked. Sure enough, John had never unpacked his clothes, nor indeed any of his belongings. Everything was neat in duffel bags, ready to be whisked away at a moment’s notice.
“You heard me,” I continued with a soft goofy voice so he’d know I didn’t mind. “I’m the one who has to clean it all up.”
"I was trying to work out how much my head would weigh with my hair saturated. Then I got to thinking about the weight of a human head after drowning. I thought I might also try and measure the coagulation speeds of saliva but then realised I was an idiot because" –
Third, he wants to return the bird but no one has come forward. That might, John concedes, be the one thing he won't be able to fix.
“Rubbish. All the toys in the world won’t help a baby to thrive. Love and care are what’s important,” the doctor snapped back. “Anyone can see that this baby is thriving on both. Toys are an optional extra. You people are unbelievable. If it’s really such a problem, I will personally go shopping with Sherlock and help him chose some toys.”
John gets up slowly. His leg is not so sore, but oddly enough his shoulder - which usually isn't more than a dull ache when he exerts it - aches with a jagged pain today. He rubs it absently as he heads back to his room, Rhonda calling after him.
Soon the scars on Sherlock’s back will fade into pale pink weals; John no longer twitches at the mention of St Barts.
"Your family must be glad to have you home." Sherlock is fairly certain there is no family to speak of but asks so he can gauge John's reaction.
Sherlock, poor soul, was crushed with misery. He had waited so long to get to this lovely stage in their relationship where there was nothing – no international consulting criminals, no faux deaths, no blonde assassins – to stand in the way of what he hoped would be the lovely relationship he and John were meant to have. He loved John; he had no doubt about that now. John loved him, or at least that was what Sherlock deduced when he sat down one rainy night, not long after John was married, and set about distilling every single thing he and John had ever said to one another.
“Good. Now shut up. The young Prince was raised by two well-meaning but very tedious people. They spent all their time telling the Prince that it didn’t matter if he didn’t have a heart and that that he wasn’t as smart as his brother. So the Prince decided that if he truly wanted to make up for the fact that he didn’t have a heart, he would need to be very smart indeed.”
I am a fraud, John says to himself with no evident concern as he ticks the first item off his list with a swift stroke. I am a fraud.
“I can’t. I think that’s painfully obvious. But it’s for you, not the New York Times, so I thought I could…you know, be honest. Sent-i-mental. And I hoped you wouldn’t mind that it’s not very accomplished.”
John had thought they would have good seats. He wasn’t expecting that they would have a corporate box. There is great appreciation as everyone admires the comfort, the privacy and the excellent view of the pitch.
His second act of brilliance was in the bath. He hated his first few baths, was indifferent to the next few, and after about ten days he seemed a little more relaxed when I slipped my hand under his fuzzy head and sluiced him. Then, at twelve days, I watched him actually taste the water as I carefully poured a small cup of warm water over his hair.
It was irritating but not critical. When Sherlock got home at 2am he had solved the case and felt only slight annoyance that John hadn’t been there to see that.
“You are needing to have blood food in the morning or you won’t awaken correctly,” Anya warned me. “Stews are good for the blood.”
“Did you have sex?” She asked this the same way you might ask a person about the unicorn they were riding.
“I see you’ve started an anthology,” Sherlock says nonchalantly as he flicks through the morning papers.
It's a bone of contention between them. Mrs Turner has married ones and has set the bar rather high.
Sherlock answers with a full mouth too. "No, this is the first time. It's also the first time I've had a guest stay overnight. Obviously she made these just to get a look at you."
It felt different. John whispered to me, small, sweet things confirming that I was his and emphasising that no negotiations would be entered into. He kept one arm around me and if I moved slightly he pulled me closer, kissed me harder.
Roaring babies are stressful. No one knows why they are roaring and according to John Watson, parents give up wondering why their baby is crying after about four nights. The focus shifts to getting the baby to stop crying. According to my observations of Albion, a baby will stop crying when they feel like it.
He tries to conjure up some positive thoughts. Maybe I could fall in love with someone else. Another man might like me.
Dr Watson had no love for Social Services. His tone and determination to disagree illustrated he’d been harbouring a lot of hostility for quite some time.
He holds them for a long time, smiles at them wanly, strokes the little metal globules that make up the chain on which they hang and finally, with a little awkwardness, hangs them back around his neck. They're cold, but he knows his heart will warm the up in no time at all.
John looks around him, still unsmiling under the darkening sky. The cold is imposing as he steps forward and wraps his arms around Sherlock tightly with no words, and when Sherlock carefully returns the embrace John lifts his face and kisses him deeply, and with great feeling.
I deduced Lestrade had a friend in Social Services, which would be highly likely, given he dealt with them whenever he oversaw a homicide involving a child. On that basis I had to accept his information was sound.
The nice home is being paid off, with some financial stress, by a solicitor called Charlotte, who insists as soon as they meet that John call her Charlie. She works at one of the big law firms in the City and is hoping to become an expert in intellectual property, which is, of course, booming. As they talk, John learns that until recently Charlotte - who doesn't really strike John as a Charlie - wanted to be an expert in criminal law.
The other big change is Mycroft, who has, surprisingly, become the cool uncle. Since Eurus died (willed her own death, poor creature) Sherlock and Mycroft have found a peace in their relationship that they could never have while she lived. Sherlock now accepts and sometimes even seeks Mycroft’s advice, and Mycroft is supportive of, and (on a least two occasions) impressed by Sherlock’s work.
The former client, Doctor Ludwig Bails, will study them carefully, and read Rudy’s letter twice. The drawings bring him a nauseating mixture of  fear and hope, tempered with a liberal dash of scientific curiousity.
My partner, my best friend, my doctor, my John, is the sun around which we revolve. He wipes noses, mops up spilt drinks, stares at me with patient resolve when I’m being ridiculous and with these quiet, unassuming practicalities, keeps us all safe. I owe him so much every day, this wonderful man who not only found my heart but thought it worth keeping.
Perhaps in hindsight I bought too many baby things. I had no idea what I was doing, and reasoned that it was better to have eight bottles and four blankets with matching pillows than being snowed in some bleak night with a freezing hungry baby and have nothing.
Adrienne was in labour for four hours and I had to wait there the whole time. She screamed a lot at the end. I rather wished I could too. It was markedly unpleasant.
They weren’t sure what else to do with me so I got shoved into the occupational therapy workshops and painted things. It didn’t make me feel better or worse, only momentarily interested in the composition of the paints and keenly aware that I had virtually no gifts for draughtsmanship at all.
“I heard.” ‘John surprised me yet again by quoting the story in an unexpected high voice. “ ‘Mew mew mew! In the well is fair Lupina! You have nothing but Pepina!’ ”
Now Mycroft appeared at my door, with Anya. It appeared they’d been to brunch together.  My flat was starting to take on the properties of that movie where so many are people are crammed in a small room, they all fall out when some hapless extra opens the door.
“Don’t be fwightened,” he told his sister when he explained boars. “If there’s a boar and it comes here, Mrs Hudson will hit with her bwoom. If she misses, Daddy and other Daddy will kill it before it can get us.”
John ushered us both straight into the bath as soon as we got home. Mrs Hudson and Anya appeared from nowhere and there were small noises in the kitchen. Tea, I suspect, and maybe a light meal.
"Obvious. Of course you're going to have a therapist. You've been wounded in a war and you've been invalided. You have psychosomatic ailments, debilitating nightmares, you're scared of the dark. You've experienced some awful things and then thrust back into civilian life. I doubt seriously you would have chosen to work in a pharmaceutical company or live with idiots. You're
Billy Kinkaid, known by police, assorted criminals, families of the deceased and London journalists as the Camden Garroter, has been a free man for three days. In that time he has eaten three pizzas, four curries and eight servings of hot chips because if there's something you miss in prison, it’s good fast food. Right now, Billy has a hankering for a kebab.
Adrienne refused point blank to feed our son. This created an enormous stand-off between Adrienne, the midwife and the extremely tired nurse who had been present at the birth. The midwife wanted Adrienne to breastfeed, the nurse said it didn’t matter and that no one should be forced to do anything they didn’t want to. Adrienne swore at them, made a impolite gesture with one finger  before pulling the sheet over head and sighing loudly when the discussion extended beyond thirty seconds.
“The cats loved Lupina because cats secretly love women who do their housework. Also, she very qualified to do the cats’ housework because she had spent her life being down trodden and doing all the housework for her idiot family. She was also a good cook, which was handy because these cats never stopped eating. They particularly liked casseroles, which is just make believe, because cats are in fact carnivores, like boars. Their guts have evolved to digest uncooked meat. You and I could eat uncooked meat but our teeth aren’t sharp enough to break it down, and because of the bacteria it holds, it would give us stomach ache or perhaps poison us, which happened to me once but that’s another story.”
Sherlock’s poem in this chapter is inspired by For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry, which is part of the Jubilate Agno, written by Christopher Smart in the 18th Century. Jeoffry shared the poet’s cell in an asylum and was his only company for many years. Christopher Smart studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge, as did Douglas Adams, who (in his Hitchhiker’s Trilogy) famously declared the meaning of life to be 42.
“I thought I might ask Lestrade for a case in a couple of weeks. Something short to start, and only during the day.”
John’s thoughts are misshapen and relentless: All I want is a relationship. Sherlock all but married me himself at my wedding. He stares at me with sad eyes and does everything he can to ensure my wellbeing. It looked like love, it sounded like love. What is it, if not love? And who in the name of fucking fuck gave him straight boy pain?
“Of course! He loves them. I’ve told him stories since he was a few days old. I hope, by the time I introduce him to books in a few months time, that he will be familiar enough with the narrative to associate them with the pictures, and this should help him with recognizing words. “
“Garbage. Tell me why you won’t come on cases with me. We’ve had three terrific ones, the mummified couple were extraordinary, and it would have been great to have you at the autopsy at Bart’s” – and then Sherlock saw it. Bart’s.  At the mention of Bart’s John’s eyes and mouth showed microscopic twitches that no other person would have noticed.
John smiles to himself as Sherlock sweeps into the lab where he had worked as a student and a registrar.
There's Sherlock's pale throat, right for the stabbing. It's long, thinks John, carefully raising his gun.
John twists a little, grabs Sherlock arm, roughly pushes up his sleeve and plucks one of the bear brown hairs there.
“Well, if you stayed in hospital as the doctors recommended and rested as you were instructed, you’d be completely recovered now.”
He sits up to investigate and finds the remnants of a serious beating. “What the hell? Who did this to you?”
"I came when I heard you were in danger." He seems a little offended that Sherlock would question this.
Mycroft made a sort of sympathetic face at me, which would have been effective had Albion not belched again quite loudly.
He follows the voices. One is loud and distinctly unfriendly, one is more refined and almost indiscernible, carrying on the still night air in a hum.
“All the things you’ve said and done, your personal preferences for food, drink and clothing, your favourite books and films and your sock index. And stop making sad cow eyes about being uninteresting. I meant that it’s uninteresting to you. It is endlessly fascinating for me.”
Lestrade's team are not quite so generous. None of them like Sherlock, and all resent that he might happy. They waste time trying to find out the real nature of his relationship with the gentle doctor.
I deduced that his world-wide trek had nothing to do with being sick of everything and everything to do with sickness from losing an adored child who he never really actually had.
Rudy sighs heavily and paces the room, hands clasped tightly behind his back.  “Brother mine, she is a disaster waiting to happen. Based on her drawings, Ludwig describes the likelihood of her killing a child as when, not if. He says he’s surprised she hasn’t already at least attempted it. You can thank Mycroft for his supervision these last few weeks, because I’d wager he is the sole reason that she hasn’t.”
“I’m going to leave here in about an hour. She’s out near Catford now, so I probably won’t get home until this afternoon.  Am I safe to leave you here alone?”
He learnt how wrong he’d been one day when Sherlock, distracted by having no cases, strolled out of the bathroom in just a towel to retrieve his phone. John’s mouth dropped open when he saw the grid of scars across Sherlock’s back. They were not marks from an accident. Someone had flogged him.
I’m not able to tell you much more about Adrienne except that she had straight brown hair, six tattoos, four piercings in her left ear and three in the right ear, an accent from Northumberland (rural, not urban) and we had apparently had sex of some kind at least three times.
“I have renewed the milk, “ Anya said as she reached for her handbag. “I hope you all have a beneficial walk and will be seeing you in the morning. Good night, Mr Albion.”
Lestrade's office, speaking with outstretched emphatic hands, as if he might reach out and drag Lestrade through his most recent deductions.
Sherlock waits for half an hour before he text Ademar Silver. It transpires that Ademar’s friend Penny the beautician is visiting but he invites Sherlock over anyway. Penny the beautician is lots of fun. She gives Sherlock a free pedicure and offers to thread his eyebrows. He takes the pedicure, because he always wondered what they might be like, but passes on the eyebrow shaping.
They don't speak for a while. John looks out the window, working out how he can do this. He knows Bart's back to front. Accident and Emergency on a Saturday night, even this early, will be hectic and mostly staffed by agency nurses and doctors. On a Saturday night there would be very few regular staff. An unfamiliar doctor won't register with anyone.
John has slept in his room a total of three times. These days he curls up in Sherlock's bed who, if he is actually in bed, likes to monitor his breathing, scour his skin with his magnifying glass or they devour one another until their mouths and bodies ache.
Bob shrugs. "Depends on the boss. If he's got a habit himself - and you know a lot of them are very fond of cocaine- he's going to be paranoid."
Eurus smiles proudly at both. It’s the first time, the first real time, she has been able to play with Sherlock and Victor, and it is splendid. She wants it to last forever. “Should we make Mycroft walk the plank again?”
Mycroft continued to be conciliatory. “I regret that I ever thought that, let alone said it to you.”
“Yes. I actually liked you with a beard – infinitely more than I did when you wore a moustache – but now you look like the vulnerable doctor who loaned me his phone at St Barts all those years ago. Now. What about my post cards?”
“Ah. Right.” John made a half-hearted effort to wring some water from my hair. “You know, I think the world’s water crisis could be solved if we utilised your head a little more effectively.”
