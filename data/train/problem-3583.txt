They sit like that for a time, on the floor in the bunker’s kitchen. Cas remembers how to breathe, and he inhales and exhales to the rhythm of Dean’s hands slowly rubbing up and down his back. They don’t say anything until finally,
Dean finally looked up, not bothering to wipe at the tears that spilled when he did so. “I didn’t have a chance.”
Cas can feel Jack’s powers probing at him, looking for something physically wrong that can be healed.
. Sam didn’t even want to think about when Dean was in purgatory. He’d been running from his pain, and it didn’t matter how hard he’d worked at it, he hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that that wasn’t where he was supposed to be, no matter how much of his childhood (hell, even part of his young adulthood) he’d spent dreaming about not having to deal with the monsters. No, he’d grown into the role that he’d carved for himself here without even realizing it; the monsters and hunters were going to be a part of his life, and he was going to make sure anyone who needed the information he had was going to have it.
Cas nodded, his expression quirking oddly. “Yes.”
There was a pause while Beckett let this sink in.
Immediately, Dean lunged at the man, pressing him against the wall, his forearm pressed against his throat. "Where the hell am I?" Dean demanded.
"Al," Beckett said. "Let him stay. We're getting nowhere telling him where to go."
After a few more minutes of silence, Al reappeared.
“Of course,” Cas said. “I couldn’t forget it.”
, but she was so solid and the way she was looking at him was so
"So this is what you do for a living," Beckett said, checking to make sure the bandage on his arm was snug.
Dean closed his eyes and hung his head, taking a deep breath.
"Let's go," Sam said to Beckett, turning to leave.
“Okay, I’m up,” Dean muttered. He rubbed Miracle’s head when the dog’s tail wagged at the sound of his voice.
“What
"That's probably for the best."
“Yes.”
Dean’s face lights up. He sets his glass aside and shifts so he’s on his knees facing Cas. He reaches forward and takes Cas’ glass and sets it aside too, to better take both hands in his. “I love you, Cas. I love you so much.”
"I don't know. Al hasn't told me," Beckett said.
Cas looked up, startled. He was sitting on a low branch of an ancient oak tree, leaning against the thick trunk. He smiled when he recognized Dean. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I didn’t know you came through in the afternoon too.”
Cas is panting now, less from a need to fill his lungs and more from panic. His mind turns itself over, searching for possibilities. Dean wouldn’t leave him. Not Dean who was so sure he’d lost his grip when Cas had shoved him out of purgatory, who trusted Cas even when Cas didn’t think he deserved it.
"Sometimes," Dean said with a shrug.
"For now," Sam said.
There was a crash from inside the barn, and Cas almost smiled. Had he expected anything else from the Winchesters? He thought he might as well join in, and he could make an entrance while he was at it, couldn’t he? He still had his grace for now, even if he could already feel it fading.
Al looked up, his eyebrows raised in surprise. He looked at Cas and then to Beckett. "This one can see me," he said.
The note was written on hotel stationary, and the address was somewhere in Oklahoma.
“Not just in pictures,” Dean said. He turned to see Cas with half a smile on his face.
His snack barely took the edge off his hunger, but he figured he was going for lunch anyway, so it was fine. At least it gave him something else to think about on his way to the park.
Cas was taken aback, but he stopped himself from denying it outright. Did he want to stay? He didn’t know. He’d planned on dying in the empty, dying
“What about not having his grace?” Eileen asks.
“Close enough,” Dean said. “I guess I should thank you for that.”
to die like this. This was how
Those words had played and replayed in Dean’s head since Cas had spoken them. He’d been stunned. He’d wanted to respond, and when he replayed the scene in his mind he would sometimes change the ending to one where the empty hadn’t grabbed Cas away from him, and he’d been able to cross the space to Cas and hold him and assure him that
Cas had to agree. There were fewer hard lines on this map, larger tracts of connected space. “What now?”
"Do you mind letting me down?" the man asked, his voice strained. "I'll explain, but it's a bit difficult to breathe."
"Cas?" Sam asked, looking around.
The footsteps haven’t stopped. A creeping feeling crawls up Cas’ spine. “Where’s Jack?”
Cas considered, then shrugged. “There are a few annual contests I like to enter. Some I’ll post for free use. I have a niece who likes to try to paint the landscapes.”
He stood carefully, thinking that maybe something had kidnapped him in the middle of the night. But that didn't make sense. He had been with Cas, and Cas certainly wouldn't have let anything take him. Unless whatever it was had gotten Cas too, but Dean refused to believe that.
“Come in?” Cas says uncertainly.
He was right. “You said you just had breakfast with him yesterday.”
More silence.
All the air in his lungs, all the air Cas doesn’t need, leaves him in a rush. He sways on his feet, but then Dean’s there, practically holding him up. “You…”
Now that was the question. Sam didn’t know how to answer. “I don’t know.”
Cas shook his head. “We don’t even know if the portal will work for an angel.”
“What if we didn’t hunt anymore?” Dean asked. He didn’t know who he was talking to, but he figured he might as well try the words out. He didn’t like how they tasted. He’d hunted his whole life, and for better or worse, he couldn’t just
"I cut him off," Ziggy said. "Boring conversation."
Jack smiled at him. “If I need help, I’ll know where to find you,” he said. “I don’t have a reason to think you wouldn’t help me.”
“Cas?”
"Good to know," Beckett said, shifting his arm around to try to feel where the knife was.
“Fine enough to get out of bed?”
“You’re right,” Jack said with a smirk. He got a faraway look in his eye for half a second, then nodded. “They’re on a hunt. Ohio somewhere. I can drop you right where they are.”
Once Dean has disappeared around the corner, Cas turns to the bathroom door and pushes it open. Every moment, he expects to step, once again, into darkness. He expects it as he strips his layers off, as he adjusts the water temperature in the shower, as he relieves himself and remembers why he’d thought it was such a nuisance the last time. As he towels off and slips into his borrowed clothing; the t-shirt is faded and just a little narrow in the shoulders, the sweats are comfortably stretched so they’re even a little baggy. Every time he blinks he expects to open his eyes to darkness.
They stopped outside the waiting room. "You know, I don't mind you so much either," Al said, a slight smile playing on his lips. "No get back to your brother."
Neither of them moved.
“We can stop for a while,” Sam suggested at one point.
“Easier to climb trees in?”
“Come back to the bunker with me,” Sam said. He knew everything was all over - all the heaven and hell, the light and darkness, the fate and destiny. They’d made it to free will, and there was nothing coming after them. He knew Eileen wasn’t going to go anywhere, and if he left, she’d still be right here when he got back. But he didn’t want to leave her again.
He can do this instead, Dean thinks, raising their tangled hands to his mouth, pressing his lips on Cas’ skin.
Cas doesn’t say anything back, his body feeling tense, perhaps embarrassed, in Dean’s arms before he starts relaxing slightly, arms coming up to hold Dean back. Dean closes his eyes and tightens his arms around Cas’ shoulders at that, letting the hug linger, needing it to.
“Cas.”
“So,” Dean says once Cas is full.
When he does, Cas makes a soft noise in the back of his throat that Dean can feel rather than hear. There’s a voice somewhere in the back of Dean’s head that warns him he should feel embarrassed, but Cas loves him, Cas knows him. So maybe, just this once, with someone there to catch him, he can allow himself this.
“Cas?”
at the thought of doing the same.
He turns the shower off after almost forty minutes and rests his forehead against the tiles, breathing deeply in and out, letting himself dry for a while. He’s not sure what time it is by now, but he’s wide awake, nowhere close to feeling sleepy at all. So he gets out of the shower and puts his clothes back on rather than the doughnuts pyjama pants he brought with him.
It really is going to be all okay, Dean thinks, happy ending that Chuck wanted to deny them included, and that, suddenly, makes him laugh.
He hardens his expression before kneeling next to Cas on the floor, dismisses any traces of panic as he slowly presses a hand in the middle of Cas’ back like he’s a spooked horse; like they’re both spooked horses.
By the time they’re back to the motel, Dean feels on the precipice of something he can’t explain.
“Don’t ever do that again,” he finally says in a shaky voice when they’ve exited the car and started approaching their room. They’re only a few steps from the door and now is probably not the right time, but Dean doesn’t fully feel like himself, the truth on the tip of his tongue. He’s definitely not drunk, but he’s something.
“But… It wasn’t like this last time? ” Dean whispers and this is not something he particularly wants to revisit, old shame curling in his belly. Cas… Cas always deserved better than Dean could offer, he knows that. He knows all the specific ways he’s let him down over the years, the guilt of it never quite far from the front of Dean’s mind. Dean with his anger and the right words always getting stuck in his throat, the wrong ones spewing out of his mouth like bullets, the only language he ever learned to speak. “Are you… Are you sure there isn’t something actually wrong, Cas? You’re sure this isn’t like when Jack lost his grace? I mean, okay, you’re human, but you… you look ill, and –”
“What?” he says, half-whispers really. Cas thinks… Dean shakes his head, still frowning. How could they be misunderstanding each other so. “You think I went to get you to stop Chuck?” Dean finally asks, feeling a bit offended, though he’s not sure if it’s on Cas’ behalf or his.
“Hey sleepyhead,” Dean calls over his shoulder, smiling to himself when Cas sleepily moves closer, pressing a few small kisses on Dean’s neck in response to his greeting.
“Yes.”
Cas hums, eyes fixed on the glass of water. “I still feel… quite tired,” he admits and he looks and sounds it, shoulders hunched forwards and dark circles under his eyes, skin still taut and pale. He’s not really shivery anymore, but Dean is suddenly, irrationally, too scared to touch him to check if he has a fever. “But I no longer feel ‘like death’,” Cas adds the last part as a joke, the corner of his lips turning up and one of his hands letting go of the glass to make a small quotation mark gesture.
Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror again, the tension between them cackling for half a second before Dean looks away. He can’t help but wonder, not for the first time, if he’s the only one who feels that electricity in the air when they stare at each other a little too long, a little too close. He can’t be, right? Then again, Castiel is an angel of the Lord, no matter how many times his allegiances have changed. Who knows what goes on in that head of his.  Besides, it doesn’t matter. It’s not something to dwell on. Or, more specifically, it’s not something he allows himself to dwell on.
After what feels like an eternity of silence where Dean is too shocked to press the issue, Cas finally tilts his head, stops looking at the dirty floor, soiled with black goo and bodily fluid, and meets Dean’s eyes. The last time they looked at each other head-on, Cas died and Dean’s heart squeezes painfully in his chest at the reminder. For a long second, it feels like time slows down, then, Cas nods in answer to Dean’s question, a small, almost imperceptible gesture, and the moment is broken.
. So he makes one for himself, then one for Cas, just in case, for later.
but somehow, this is more terrifying.
Cas deserves better than that. Right now, Cas deserves all the gentleness in the world and that’s what Dean is going to give him. The softest towel, the softest clothes, the softest blanket… The softest touches…
“What did you mean?” Dean repeats, neediness cackling like a live wire beneath his skin.
“It’s going to be fine, Dean,” Cas finally manages to say, eyes still closed. “I’m going to be fine. I just…” He pauses, then exhales. “The Empty wouldn’t let me leave with my grace,” he finally admits.
If this were anyone else, Dean would choke on shame at this revelation. Has he been filled with anything but terrible longing for Castiel ever since they first met in that barn so many years ago? Ever since Cas first cradled his soul? Ever since Cas
Dean feels his throat tighten and his eyes prickle. “Yeah,” he agrees, taking another swig of whiskey.
, and quickly tells Cas he
“It’s really,” Dean starts, voice strangled, “
“We’ll talk later,” he interrupts a little roughly, rougher than he intends, emotions bubbling to the surface as he leans away and starts fumbling with his bedding, making space for Cas to slide underneath. “Just rest for now,” Dean continues, pressing a hand to Cas’ shoulder, silently inviting him to lie down.
It doesn’t even take a second for him to feel the car shake when Cas closes his door and leans against it, mimicking Dean’s posture, their clothed arms brushing against each other, the slight pressure of Cas’ body against his so perfect Dean feels lit up from the inside. When Sam comes back around with both of their bags, Dean has to actively school his features into a neutral expression to hide the way his heart is thundering in his chest.
that Cas is here to stay now, that they can work it out.
Dean’s brain statics for half a second before
“It’s okay,” Cas whispers, one of his hands caressing Dean’s hair for a second before resting on the nape of his neck, pressing him a little further into Cas’ chest, blocking the outside world completely. “Say what you have to say, Dean,” he adds and that makes Dean cry even harder.
Where they stand is on the edge of a precipice and Dean is working up the courage to let himself go, to
He should probably text Sam back at some point too before he drives to the bunker in a panic that Dean off-ed himself in a drunken grief-fueled rage. No matter how much Dean told him he was
This is going to be hard enough without an audience, the last thing Dean needs is Sam’s well-intentioned meddling.
Instead, he stretches, leans as far as he can, to grab the towel from the toilet seat.
Cas jumps at the touch, nervous or in pain, Dean can’t tell.
“Cas!” Dean says, half a groan, half a whimper – he sounds more worried than he means to – before he runs to where Cas is wiping his mouth with a shaky hand, on his knees, one palm still on the floor, barely holding himself up.
, blue eyes wide with something akin to shock, tinged with a bit of compassion. He shakes his head, a no to Dean’s request perhaps, before speaking.
Then, he slowly nudges Cas down, so he can sit in the tub, his knees bent in a semblance of modesty. Dean wonders if it’s as hard for him to accept help as it is for Dean, if maybe he’s making things worse by highlighting how much Cas can’t do this for himself right now.
Dean chuckles to himself. He’s being gauded into saying something, he knows, and he knows he's going to fall for it. “Yeah,” he admits, voice low but not quite whispering, afraid of waking Sam. He fucking wishes he felt tired. Then, maybe his brain would just…
. Sometimes, irrationally, Dean envies Sam’s hands. They’re not Winchester hands. They’re Campbell’s or someone else’s up their line, but they’re not John Winchester’s, the fingers longer, the palm narrower…
“What were you thinking?” Cas finally asks after a while, when Dean still hasn’t explained.
So, Dean keeps himself busy, grabbing the sheets stained with Cas’ blood, with dirt, with whatever the hell the Empty is made of. He grabs the blankets that aren’t as bad but still needs a thorough wash. Then, he grabs the pillowcases off the pillows. He bundles it all up into his arms with the towel and the rest, probably dirtying himself in the process, and finally makes his way to the laundry room.
,” he whispers in a hoarse voice. “Dean, I –” he stops himself, shakes his head. “I love you too,” he says earnestly, like it’s the easiest thing in the world, like it’s been on the tip of his tongue this whole time and all Dean had to do was ask. “You must know that.”
Dean hovers near the bathroom door for a second, the weight of Cas’ stare pinning him in place. Cas breaks eye contact first, glancing down pointedly at Dean’s jeans before going back to the touristy guide he’s found somewhere in the room while Dean showered.
Dean tightens his right hand into a fist, trying to find the words to explain, trying to find words that aren’t too damning to express what it feels like when Castiel is gone, trying to find
“You mean,” Dean stops rubbing Cas’ back, “you’re human?”
It comes out a little plaintive, a little desperate, but Dean can’t help but need reassurance that they
If Cas disapproves of his drinking, he doesn’t say so. He just insists: “Did it?” and Dean’s resolve crumbles as he looks back at him.
“Why don’t you get in the shower while I get you some clean clothes?” Dean offers, gently nudging Cas towards the tub.
, Dean automatically sends a small prayer to him before he can stop himself.
“What are you looking at?” Cas finally asks, looking over Dean’s shoulder, his voice even lower in the mornings, Dean’s favourite sound, soft but rough at the same time.
Once he’s better, Dean thinks, they’ll go on a trip. He’ll take Cas somewhere warm and nice, where he can lounge and let his skin pinken under the sun, somewhere with water to swim in, where they can be rocked softly, weightless, by the waves, by the beauty of the world they saved countless times but never enjoyed. Somewhere where Cas can eat good food, where he can
“We’re stopping?” he says sleepily, giving Dean a thoroughly confused side look, still snuggled against the car door.
that’s been growing ever since they got rid of Chuck and he’s been the only one steering the wheel flares deep in his chest. “You can do whatever you want.”
“I’m alive,” Cas replies and of course, he gets to the crux of the matter in very few words.
So right now, he doesn’t want to be snappy and difficult, just for the sake of it. He doesn’t want to play this game of theirs, doesn’t want to feed their usual dynamic. He wants to be honest, for once.
“Cas?” Dean asks, uncertain, and instead of replying, Cas lets go of his face and his back at the same time, the warmth of him suddenly, brutally, gone, even though he hasn’t even moved away.
“You alright to walk?” Dean finally asks after a few long seconds of Cas slowly breathing in and out, leaning against the wall. Hypnotised, Dean follows the movement of his chest rising and falling under the blanket while waiting for a reply.
Right now, he’s scrolling through pictures of a house only a few miles away that looks so haunted that Dean can smell it from here, but has a really nice kitchen – good cupboards and great counter space. Well, Dean thinks, sliding his thumb across the screen to get to the next photo, what’s a salt and burn in their line of work? Dean needs great counter space. And staying in Kansas might be good, Dean figures, especially if Sam keeps playing team leader to other hunters. He’ll want to say near the bunker, that’s for sure. And Dean’ll want to stay near enough to where Sam is. So.
. So why can’t Dean calm the fuck down?
“But –” Dean starts rubbing Cas’ back again when he’s hit with a full body shiver. Fuck, Dean hates this.
“I know,” Dean repeats, insistently.
“Neither have I,” Cas replies plainly and maybe it’s that simple, maybe starting over for them doesn’t have to be a big deal.
“Are you alright?” Cas asks carefully and when Dean opens his eyes, he’s looking at him like he’s always looked at him, intense and sharply focused, except now, Dean knows what it means, knows it means
“Still hurts?’ Dean asks, all teasing gone from his voice.
“Every…” Dean shakes his head. Of course, it doesn’t matter because Cas is Cas, superpowered angel of the Lord or not. But clearly, this transition has been painful, is painful, and Dean… Dean can’t not feel guilt and grief for it. “Every part of you matters Cas. I know it’s harder than last time, more…. More painful, but we’ll figure it out, yeah?”
Well… He might need his room back.
He doesn’t understand, Dean thinks to himself, trying to calm himself down.
“What?”
But Cas is freezing. And Dean, hurrying back to his side, fingers tightly clutched around the blanket, can try to fix
Somehow, Dean hadn’t known that’s what he was going to say and, for a second, the weight of this confession is heavier than ever before, heavier than when he was its lone carrier.
They both know what he meant. Dean has been obsessively excavating every single word, every breath, every pause, of that speech since he first heard it. He knows exactly what Cas meant because Cas made sure there was no ambiguity and yet, selfishly, before he says anything else, he needs more reassurance. Still and again, disbelieving and overwhelmed, he wants Cas to say it.
Dean shakes his head slowly. “Chuck is gone, Cas. He’s… He’s been gone a while now. He doesn’t have his powers anymore.”
“This fixes it,” he whispers, softly, putting both hands on Cas’ hips and kissing him again.
“I can have a look through Sam’s stuff for a book for you if you’d like,” he finally says after a long moment of silence.
Not that Dean gives him a chance to argue back, opening his door quickly and getting out of the car before he’s entirely done speaking. He doesn’t want to have to explain himself, especially not when he doesn’t fully know what the fuck is going on with him. It
“You gonna be okay in there?” Dean asks, watching with careful eyes as Cas leans his entire weight against the shower wall.
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean mutters, taking his hand away half-heartedly. The buzzing under his skin doesn’t seem so loud when Cas is at hand. “You look good.” He pauses. “Great, even.”
Somewhere between kisses, Dean finally manages to talk.
Dean shushes Cas comfortingly instead of saying so, his hand heavy on Cas’ naked back. Touching him anywhere but where his hand is pressed feels like a minefield and it’s such a stupid thing to worry about at a time like this that Dean hates himself for it the minute he thinks it. But he thinks it.
Dean nods, finally fully stepping away, walking back towards the table. “I’ve got some broth for you and I’ve made a sandwich too? But if you want anything –”
Then, finally, a whisper against the skin of Dean’s neck: “You should look at land instead,” Cas says and Dean hums, a small puzzled noise, not quite a question yet, before Cas continues, “If we’re going to build a life together, we should actually build it.” He says it so softly, his fingers sliding into Dean’s where they’re resting on Dean’s stomach. “You’re good with your hands,” Cas adds, and on someone else’s lips, under different circumstances, it would sound like an innuendo.
“There we go,” Dean continues to babble as he crouches down next to the tub, turning the water on, adjusting the temperature, fiddling a bit to waste time, trying to fill in the silence with as many inane things as he can in a vain attempt to be comforting.
He also has no idea how to do this, is nowhere near ready, even though he’s been thinking about it nonstop for months now as he relentlessly searched for a way to get Cas back.
, blue eyes wide and piercing, awake and well enough to hold a conversation, awake and well enough to look like himself again.
and Dean hasn’t done anything weird or ill-advised without talking to him about it first. Ok, he straight up lied to his brother, but… There’ll be time to tell Sam once Cas feels better, once Dean knows where they stand. Sam sounded worried, obviously, because when doesn’t he when it comes to Dean since Cas died. He probably remembers last time as vividly as Dean does; the way he jumped on that chance to play dead, the way he didn’t even care if he was brought back or not, the whole world a fuzzy, blurry
Dean doesn’t know how long Cas sleeps for.
He does soften though, rubbing his thumb on the back of Cas’ hand in what he hopes is a soothing gesture. Dean couldn’t even admit he remembered Hell when he first got out, he can hardly fault Cas for looking away, even if he doesn’t want him to feel like he has to.
Not yet, at least. There’ll be time… Later. When Cas feels better. When Dean is more composed, when he…
Cas silently gets up too and the two of them leave the diner, both Dean’s plate and Cas’ coffee half full.
He hums, like he’s reading something fascinating, then turns the page slowly.
Glancing back at the rearview mirror, he thinks vividly that he cares
He blinks, hard, refusing to let
Dean thinks as he deepens the kiss, letting go of the bathrobe to cup Cas’ jaw.
“I was just thinking…” Dean trails off, thumbing his phone for a second before pressing it face down on the mattress, finally hiding it fully. They’ve been slowly easing themselves into this thing, this couple thing, enjoying each other between a case here and there, learning how to be better for each other, seeing how they fit, how they’ve always fitted. There is little that’s actually changed, apart from the physicality, if Dean’s honest with himself. Some days, he feels like he and Cas have always been like this. In love. A partnership. The only difference now is that Dean can say so. And Sam knows. But this? This is a big step… even if they’re already technically living together.
Relief, and something else, something deeper, spread through Dean’s chest at the sight.
Instead of joking along, Cas reaches up to cradle Dean’s jaw, thumb soft, tender, against Dean’s skin and he has to close his eyes, suddenly overwhelmed by the gesture. After a second, Dean feels Cas’ lips press against the corner of his mouth, then his jaw, his other hand sliding under Dean’s shirt to reach his lower back where the skin is tender. Dean stiffens without meaning to, a small whimper, more pleasure than pain, shamefully escaping from the back of his throat. Cas’ fingers are light on Dean’s back, warm, and it’s barely a touch but Dean feels it like electricity through his entire body.
It seems rather unfair to leave him when they’ve been separated for so long, when they’ve been separated so often in their decade of friendship, but Dean physically cannot stay still right now without making himself sick with worry. He keeps opening and closing his fists while he stares at the sleeping angel – ex-angel – hands desperate for something to do, something to keep them busy.
going to grab clothes and a towel for him if he wants to start cleaning himself up in the meantime.
But Dean has over a decade of arguing with him under his belt and he’s hardly intimidated by that tone anymore. “Cas, you’re a mess,” he says, aiming for stern but landing somewhere along the line of plaintiveness. Okay, not his best work, but he
“I’m gonna hit the shower,” Dean mumbles, feeling itchy all over, even stupid places like the back of his knees and down his sternum. It’s like there’s something about to burst out of him
“Yeah man,” he agrees with a bitter laugh. “Die.”
and that Sam could enjoy his time away with Eileen, the kid
without worries, for once.
“That sounds good, Dean,” Cas finally says after a lifetime. He shrugs, a puzzled smile on his face, before speaking again. “I don’t know what I could possibly do,” he admits, widening his eyes, seemingly considering a short human life for the very first time, “but I suppose it’s good to know you’ll… be there.”
“But we don’t need to stop uh,” he mumbles to himself, rolling his eyes, and he startles when Cas chuckles in the back seat.
“You okay?” he asks. “Feeling better?”
When he makes it back to the bathroom, his heart breaks a little seeing that Cas hasn’t even moved, still leaning against the shower wall, dirty as ever, the blanket hanging sadly from his shoulders. Dean can’t see his face, but he assumes he has his eyes closed, still trying to rest. Every once in a while, he scratches his torso, clearly still bothered by the layer of filth on his body.
“We should have done this a long time ago,” he mumbles, somewhere against Cas’ jaw.
If Cas can believe in him enough to die for him, if Dean himself can tell God off for believing the worst of him, then maybe Dean can be the better version of himself from now on.
“What’s wrong?” he finally asks in a small voice, hoping maybe Cas, no matter how unwell he is, will know. Maybe the Empty said something to him before… “Did it bring you back wrong?” he can’t help himself from adding, voice rougher now at the thought. “Did I…” but he can’t bring himself to ask the question, can’t bring himself to even hint that this might have been a mistake, that he might have selfishly ruined Cas’ eternal peace only for him to die again just now, but painfully.
There, he drops everything to the floor before grabbing one item at the time to check them over, spraying the worst of it with some stain remover and pre-washing the blood out with cold water and soap. He’s about to start the load when he looks at himself and his dirty, relatively rumpled clothes. He’s got a few wet spots where his tee-shirt clings, from the shower or the laundry, or both. Dean tilts his head, bringing his shirt up to his nose, sniffing, trying to remember the last time he changed. He’s not even sure what it is anymore, all of them blurred after Sam took off with his girlfriend. The movement unveils a big dirt stain on the bottom of his tee and Dean grimaces, taking the plaid shirt off, then the dirty tee-shirt underneath, throwing both in the washing machine. Dean scratches his lower belly absently, looking down at his jeans before shrugging, bending down to unlace his boots, taking them, the jeans, and his socks off. He leaves the boots aside and adds the jeans and socks to the machine before finally starting it.
“I see. Well, thank you.”
Cas puts the pamphlet away, then gets up from the bed, taking a step towards him, his hand already raised towards Dean’s forehead. “I could…” he offers gently, and it’s the earnest eyes that Dean can’t cope with right now.
tugging in his stomach whenever Dean thought of Cas and what he’d done, what he’d
He’s still thinking about it a while later, back to the very first picture of the outside of the house, when there’s finally movement behind him. Dean never considered himself an early bird, but a few months into this thing with a human Cas has him reconsidering his definition.
“Here,” Dean says gently, grabbing the glass of water he left on Cas’ nightstand and handing it to him, waiting patiently – okay, mostly impatiently, but Dean is
“You’re staring at me,” Cas declares and Dean supposes he has. He can’t help himself.
Dean chuckles. “Shut it,” he mumbles, but there’s no heat behind the words.
Finally, when Dean starts feeling like he’s indulged himself too long, he lets go, taking a small step back, not moving fully away before cupping Cas’ jaw and looking at him for a second, deep into his eyes, silently asking if he’s okay, or just reassuring himself that he really is.
Dean’s face slackens and he closes his eyes automatically in anticipation, bracing himself for tenderness the same way he braces himself for violence, body taut and heart rate quickening. Cas is delicate though, his lips like butterfly wings on Dean’s skin, there once second and gone the next. Dean is about to open his eyes again when he feels the calluses of Cas’ hands on his jaw, holding him softly like he’s precious. He feels those lips again, on his left eyelid, then his right, and it brings tears to his eyes again. He exhales, clearly overwhelmed, and the touch is gone, all of it. He doesn’t have the time to regret his reaction and miss it though, because Cas reaches for him again almost immediately, fitting his hand over the mark he left on Dean’s shoulders all those years ago in Hell, gripping him comfortingly.
Then, he grabs the dirty washcloth, towel, and blanket he left behind, bundling them in his arms before walking back towards Cas’ room.
“I’m sorry,” he says, sounding more annoyed than sorry. “I know…” he stops, then sighs. A shadow passes across his face before he tries again, calmer now, sincere. “I know I’m not as useful without my grace.” Cas says it plainly, like it’s obvious that a human version of him is far from ideal, like just the fact that he’s here isn’t anything short of a miracle for Dean. “I know that,” he repeats, voice firmer this time. “But you know I’ll do everything I can to help you stop God.”
Sam’s going to move out soon. He hasn’t said it, but Dean knows the guy and he can tell him and Eileen are getting really serious, really fast. And they’re not going to raise his nieces and nephews underground; there’s no way. So maybe… maybe it’s time for the bunker to officially be a pit stop for hunters, a resource, and for Dean and Cas to have a proper home that’s theirs and no one else's….
But maybe, Dean thinks as he very carefully, very tenderly, washes Cas’ back, his fingers barely a pressure on Cas’ skin, attentive to every tremor as he rinses the soap off, maybe they are Castiel’s hands too, remade by him bone by bone, tendon by tendon, pore by pore, infused with his grace, with his belief, when he raised Dean from hell. Not unlike Eve made from her lover’s ribs. Maybe, now that Chuck is gone, Dean can finally let his hands be good for this too.
And Cas… Cas looks at Dean with all the innocence in the world, eyes wide as he tilts his head slightly, the move so
Cas shakes his head, a slight movement before he starts squirming in his blanket.
When the empty spits out Cas, naked and covered in black goo, dirt and
Once they’re both in there, Dean helps Cas sit down on his bed and tries not to think too much about the implications, tries not to acknowledge his heart fluttering at the sight. Distractedly, aiming to look anywhere but at Cas’ face, at Cas’... everything, his eyes fall to his naked feet instead, toes curled against the cold floor. And that seems so wrong somehow, for him to be so warm, for Dean to have so carefully bundled him up, while his feet are exposed. It’s quite the oversight, leaving Cas unshielded like that, Dean thinks, something softening deep within him. He can’t let this slide, the instinct to protect too strong for him to stifle it, even if the only thing he’s protecting Castiel from right now is a cold draft.
At least one thing he didn’t fuck up today, Dean thinks distractedly, turning back towards his bedroom.
Dean grabs his bag and follows Sam inside the room, dropping it on the bed closer to the door. Sam quickly disappears in the bathroom to change and Dean takes a second too long to rummage through his belongings before having to face Cas again.
“Do you still feel like throwing up?” Dean asks when a pained expression passes on Cas’ face.
“Of course not, you deserve some sleep. Both of you.”
He takes a long shuddering breath, eyes still closed, scared and searching for the next words. But all he manages to do is repeat, more desperately this time: “don’t leave me alone Cas.”
Cas hums. “Knowing our luck…” he says leaning forward to press a kiss on Dean’s forehead.
Cas hums in agreement, mostly still sleepy, but gently mocking. “It seems like it.”
It’s typical of their lives and their luck that Cas’ return to life, to humanity, is marked with pain and disgust when all he deserves is the best the world has to offer.
In the face of Castiel’s continued discomfort, Dean’s dignity seems relatively unimportant which is why he gets up and quickly approaches the bed like something truly dramatic happened rather than a simple shift in Cas’ expression.
“I could always fix it,” Cas continues, contrite. “Now, I….” He shakes his head, grief written all over his face, and Dean knows it’s about more than the twinges in his back. It’s about Cas losing a part of himself and that’s not sorrow a snap of a finger, or one touch, can cure. “Witnessing pain is always a difficult process, but especially yours,” he adds, utterly sincere and Dean is pretty sure his heart is about to fall out of his ass.
It feels strange to be doing this for him, or maybe it feels strange that it doesn’t feel stranger, feels strange how much he wants to do it, but Dean swallows all of those weird feelings down, choosing instead to focus on making Cas feel better, passing his fingers slowly through his hair, making sure he’s washing every strand, taking the time to massage his scalp when Cas lets out a small moan that’s not pained for once. Dean repeats the movement Cas liked a few times, scratching his scalp front to back, letting his soapy hands rest on Cas’ shoulders for a beat, feeling the warmth of him, before reaching for the showerhead again.
Cas nods. “It’s… a lot,” he admits in a small voice, looking away, and Dean wishes he didn’t feel the urge to hide, but he can’t imagine what it feels like to suddenly be thrust back into the world fundamentally
“I know I haven’t always treated you right,” Dean finally manages to say. It burns his throat on the way out. All he’s had since Cas last died for him, since Chuck was defeated, are his regrets.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees for lack of a better thing to say, fussing with Cas a bit, making sure the blanket is still wrapped tightly around his naked body, flicking black goo off his hair like a mother hen. They’re still holding hands and the feel of Cas’ skin is burning a hole in Dean’s palm. Did touching him always feel like this?  “Let’s get you horizontal, right?” he adds when Cas sways on his feet, letting go of Cas’ hand to wrap his arm around his waist instead, helping him stay up.
The employee at reception is half-asleep and not the sharpest tool in the shed, but Dean eventually makes his way back out with their room key, silently sliding into the driver’s seat to park Baby right at their door.
He looks smaller than he ever has and Dean can’t help but clench his jaw at the sight.
“I’m –” Dean starts in a strangled voice before stopping, realising he doesn’t know what to do.
, that Cas is here. Then, he lets go and silently makes his way out of the room, quickly getting dressed in the corridor. Once that’s done, Dean slowly walks back to the kitchen.
He’s on all fours now, still not looking at Dean. They haven’t looked at each other once, not face to face, not face on, not that Dean is keeping track or anything. The shaking seems to have worsened now, actually, and it’s not until Cas’ teeth start chattering that Dean figures he’s probably cold.
“So did I,” he adds. It comes out bitter even though it’s mostly a lie. He didn’t stop their journey because he was tired, after all, quite the opposite.
back in his room, his flight or fight instinct utterly betrayed him.
“Sammy,” Dean whispers, putting a hand on Sam’s shoulder, making a soft noise in the back of his throat when his brother gasps awake a little too abruptly. It comes to him naturally, almost forty years of soothing Sammy’s nightmares under his belt now. “Let’s get you to bed, uh?”
It’s a long time before either of them say anything.
. And he’s lost Cas before but this time, he saw the light that was Castiel leave his vessel, he saw the scorched marks of his wings on the ground, and he supposes a dead body is a dead body no matter what animated it before, but it felt particularly empty without the heavenly host. It felt wrong.
start running around in circles in the back of his mind. It doesn’t go quiet again until Cas starts kissing him back, one of his hands gently cradling Dean’s jaw as he softens the moment and slows Dean down. His other hand is anchored on Dean’s hip, using it to move Dean around until his back hits their room door with a small thud. Dean moans. There’s not a sliver of space between their bodies, chest to chest, hips to hips, and still, Dean wants to get closer, wants to inhale Cas to make sure he never leaves again.
So, one day, he started actually looking. Looking at houses in the area, houses on the other side of the country, East Coast, West Coast, smack right in the middle of fuck-all nowhere land; Dean looked at houses all over the place.
It takes a while, and a bit of stumbling, but eventually, Cas is finally clean and dry, wrapped up in Dean’s clothes, the sight of it more satisfying than Dean ever expected. His hair is a mess again after putting the henley on, but Dean just smiles and lets it be. As a finishing touch, he holds his bathrobe up for Cas to slide into, shaking his head and making a small tutting noise when Cas opens his mouth to refuse it. He helps Cas put it on, then fiddles with the belt, tying it over Cas’ waist before finally taking a step back from him.
“Die?” Cas finally asks, sounding hesitant.
He makes a show of humming as he waits for the water to warm up, makes a show of telling Cas it’ll only be a second when he notices him shivering, makes a big show of saying it’s all going to be okay.
It doesn’t seem right.
Dean feels it all the way down to his toes. Dean knows he’s not the most open of guys, he knows that, but surely Cas has to know. He has to know why Dean went back for him.
“What is it?”
“I am now,” he replies before kissing Cas again.
For a second, Dean wonders if Cas knew it from the start, if he knew it in Hell, if he wanted back then before he truly knew what it meant. Did it creep up on him? The more he understood mankind? It certainly crept up on Dean, slowly and then all at once, until he understood he’d been there almost all along.
“This is stupid,” Dean mutters to himself, letting Cas’ hands go and getting up, his chair scraping loudly against the floor.
“Yes,” Cas agrees enthusiastically, his hold on Dean’s hips tightening again.
“It took… It took a minute to figure out how to…” Dean trails off. How to get you back? How to be a person again now that agency was on the table? How to untangle the mix of
Cas swallows hard before nodding slowly. “I uh…” he clears his throat, loud, which leads him into a small coughing fit.
“Of course I’ll be there for you buddy,” he replies like it’s obvious and the second the word buddy comes out of his mouth, Dean is filled with such fierce self-loathing he almost chokes on it. “You’re fa–” He’s about to carry on, to say ‘you’re family’ and Cas
good to see you up and about.”
This time, the urge to lie down next to him is almost unbearable.
“I just… I just thought, you and me…. You know. We don’t have to stay here. We’ve barely been hunting anyway, so we could get someplace… not underground. A house, you know? Somewhere with big windows, and a garden. You’d like that,” Dean adds like an afterthought, like he hasn’t been thinking about it non-stop, thinking about Cas, outside in the sun, tenderly caring for growing things, not a worry in the world anymore, the rest of his life stretching, filled with loving things the way only a heavenly soldier who rebelled for love can.
He’s always been a fight kind of guy. And this is something he definitely wants to fight for, something he defied more than one cosmic entity for. So why, when Cas gave him such a meaningful – such an open – look, did he fucking
“You gonna throw up again?”
Technically, no.
“It does,” Dean manages to say, choked up. He shakes his head, tightening his jaw as he looks away. Slowly, he passes a hand over his cheek, catching a tear. Why is this so hard? Licking his lower lip, Dean faces Cas again, nodding at him from across the kitchen table. “It does,” he repeats and this time, he lets himself smile back.
Dean cleaned up and cooked just like he planned, only stopping by Cas’ room once or twice every hour. He even man-ed up and called Sam, successfully convincing him that everything is
“You have the room key. Also, I’d like my bag,” Sam says, an amused smile on his face, like maybe he thinks he interrupted a moment.
He’s not quite sure how he’s going to explain the whole ‘I went and got Cas behind your back and without your help, because I was too chickenshit to tell you what happened before he died back then and I didn’t know what was going to happen if we were reunited’ thing. Dean still doesn’t know what’s going to happen, doesn’t know if Cas being human changes things, if he meant what he said, if he wants to forget the whole thing, if he….  He just doesn’t know.
And Dean knows that. Of course, he does, his hands are still tingling from the warmth of Cas’ skin against his fingers.
Cas shakes his head, eyes closed as he’s clearly hit with another wave of pain. Dean looks at him, really looks at him, and he feels his heart drop in his stomach. Without thinking he reaches for a bit of dirt near Cas’ temple, carefully brushing it off, wondering how something that is by definition void of
Still, it’s no reason not to be mindful so Dean very silently picks up a different tee-shirt, plaid shirt, jeans combination for himself. He’s about to leave the room to get dressed in the corridor when Cas moves in his sleep, turning away from Dean and wrapping his arms around one of the pillows, curling further on himself under the covers, the nape of his neck suddenly exposed.
Once he’s happy with the temperature of the water coming off the tap, Dean gets up to grab the showerhead, clicking it on before properly kneeling next to the tub, getting comfortable to help Cas wash up.
Dean smiles softly, unable to stop himself, and if it’s more fond than he’d normally like to let on then that’s his business. “Yeah, welcome to humanity again pal. It comes with all sorts of discomfort.”
He almost doesn’t want to clean it up, foolishly attached to what it means as he is. But he can just pop back into his room for proof of Cas’ continued existence if he starts worrying again. And Cas will need his room back – cleaned and functional now that he’s human – eventually.
“I know, Dean,” Cas interrupts, “I’ve always known,” and Dean, who has been haunted by Cas’ voice saying ‘the one thing I want is something I know I can’t have’ ever since he first heard it, doesn't think he does actually. But Cas carries on. “I could hear prayers, remember? But it was always more than that. Angels we… I could feel longing too.”
After a while, he stops, stroking the back of Cas’ right ear with his knuckles before getting up and offering him a hand. Together, with Cas holding on tightly, they manage to dry the rest of his body, the gestures a lot more hurried, more methodical this time.
Dean nods to himself, passing a shaky hand through his hair before finally going to his bedroom, rummaging through his drawers for something good for Cas to wear. He tries not to overthink it too much, grabbing the loosest sweatpants he owns and a soft, almost threadbare, henley. Then, he gets a big fluffy towel and his bathrobe, just in case.
He’s still shaking.
He hisses the second Dean first starts wetting his hair and Dean grimaces before asking: “S’not too hot, is it?”, one hand reaching for the nape of Cas’ neck.
“I’m not sure,” Cas says again, voice low. He still looks puzzled, looking down at the human body that’s more his than ever like he can’t fully understand it. Or maybe Dean is reading too much into it, maybe Cas just feels like utter crap.
His hands are light on Cas’ ankle, thumb rubbing on the bone. Cas visibly reacts to the touch, shivers, and when Dean looks up, their eyes meet, Cas’ already on his, intense and focused, the kind of gaze that told Dean his entire soul was bare for Cas to read back when he was an angel. It still hits the same even knowing Cas doesn’t have that ability anymore. Purposefully, Dean repeats the gesture. He wonders, briefly, if Cas has ever been touched there, if anyone he spent time with as a human ever gently pressed their fingers right there, if the skin is new, if the body is too. He wonders if the Empty rebuilt Cas somehow minus the grace before spitting him out back to Dean. He wonders if every single piece of skin he just touched in the shower was being touched for the very first time, if that’s why it seemed so overwhelming. A phantom hand burns against Dean’s left shoulder as he thinks back to Cas remaking him anew after his descent into Hell; Cas leaving a brand right there on Dean’s body, on Dean’s soul. ‘I touched him first,’ it said. Dean’s mind flickers back to the bloody handprint he never even tried to wash from his jacket… ‘I touched him last,’ the wound said. Dean finally looks away, rubbing Cas’ ankle again, fiercely imagining it leaving a thumbprint, wishing, beyond reason, that his touch could brand in the same way. Then, he slides the sock on Cas’ feet, one after the other, squeezing them once before clearing his throat and getting back up.
a rough hunt,” he finally admits, images of a crying mother flickering through his mind. “I could use a distraction.”
After a while, when Dean is clearly done talking about the whole sordid affair, Cas’ face lights up with a fond smile and he tilts his head, squinting at Dean intensely.
After leaving his room – and he refuses to think of it as running away even though that’s absolutely what he did – Dean goes back to the bathroom, quickly cleaning the tub from the mixture of black goo and blood that still stuck after he helped Cas wash. Somehow, there are flickers of ‘Empty’ all the way up the wall and Dean makes a show of growling at the no longer animated substance on Cas’ behalf, a nonsensical, yet overwhelming sense of victory and poetic justice taking hold of him as he washes it down the drain.
Cas got stabbed and Dean had to wrap his body, his vessel, knowing there wasn’t really anything left of him in there, knowing that body hadn’t really belonged to him anyways. It had been a temple made to worship him at first, fuelled by Jimmy Novak’s faith. Then, after Castiel became Cas and Jimmy died, he settled into it like it was his own. But neither of them ever really forgot, especially not Cas, that there used to be a man who inhabited it before him. And faced with it cold, lifeless, void of Cas’ light, it was hard for Dean to reconcile it with the man he loved. But Dean still tried desperately to find meaning in the funeral rites, in the tending of the body, in its ceremonial burning. He swallowed back down irrational desires to do those things, those gestures, for Cas’ actual true form  – something he knows he’ll never be able to see, feel, or reach – and he focused all of his tenderness, all of his grief, on Jimmy Novak’s old body. A hunter’s funeral is the best thing he could offer and when he finally spread Cas’ ashes somewhere beautiful and quiet, hoping it would give him peace, Dean did it knowing he would never know the feeling again himself now that Cas was gone.
“Morning, Sammy.”
"We hunt these things. Sometimes they know who we are," Sam explained, moving to check drawers.
“I thought you said you did?”
“Would you use it for this kind of thing?”
"Dr. Samuel Beckett is my friend, the one leaping from person to person," Al said, studying Dean.
He was happy for them. It might take some adjusting if anything actually came of it, but it would be natural, in time. Maybe it was natural, now, and he’d just never put all the pieces entirely together. And Sam loved them both. And wanted them to be happy.
Cas doesn’t protest when Dean steps beside him and takes him by the arm. “Spell?”
"Believe me, I've been hoping that since I woke up in that damn room."
“Your brother doesn’t know how to sleep in, does he?”
Why indeed? “Just curious,” Sam replied.
Eventually, Cas yawns. It takes him by surprise. He blinks in confusion and looks down at his body, as if realizing for the first time that it’s real and has needs.
He found a newspaper and the first thing he noticed was the date.
Case? What the hell? So this guy was some kind of cop? And had a partner?
Dean managed to stop himself before he said something he might regret. There were several reasons he wanted to save Cas, but he had to make a good argument too, or Cas would never go for it. “Why were you so determined to save
“Come in,” he manages.
“You mean you don’t remember?” Dean asks right back. “I know it took a lot out of you, but I didn’t think it was that bad.”
think it was a crime. With Jack in charge, Dean thought maybe he’d be able to catch a break, but maybe he’d just tempted fate too much in his time. So now he was going to die, pinned down by two vampires, on a hunt, just like he’d thought he would for so long.
There’s a roar in the distance, and it sounds like that portal. Cas pauses, even as his rational mind begs him to keep moving. He looks toward the sound, and then something reaches out to grab him, and the next thing he knows, he’s blinking into the old orange light of the bunker’s library.
"Fine, Ziggy. What do I need to do?"
She sat up and looked around. It was dark in her main room, the dim light of morning just starting to creep in.
“You are?”
Cas’ confused frown only deepened. “I don’t need to eat,” he said.
Dean hoped he was making it up to Sam, but he had a feeling he wasn’t. Last he’d known Cas was off with Hannah doing some angel business or other.
“She’s friendly,” Cas said, running his hands across Miracle’s ears.
Dean thought some more, his mind going back to the day he crawled out of the ground. “So you put my body back together, but you couldn’t get rid of the handprint?”
Cas nodded. “It’s okay.”
"Good," Dean said. "They'll all be down here asleep for at least twenty minutes before they change."
“-know what’s going on.”
get butterflies. But only a little.
instead of some
“It isn’t… easy, if that’s what you mean,” Cas said. How long had he not said anything? Once the words had started to have real weight, and he’d started to really understand the implication, he’d gone so long without wanting to stir up trouble. He’d come off the line with a crack in his chassis, wasn’t that what Naomi had said? What if it was something wrong with him? Something that would only make things worse? And he’d gone so long believing that Dean couldn’t love him back. It had taken a deal to
As they rose higher, the voices became nothing more than high-pitched screeches.
“I’m real, Cas,” Dean said. He covered Cas’ hand with his own, and tried not to let Cas’ expression tie his heart in knots. “And I’m here to take you home.”
, Dean offered. And then, since Cas seemed to like the emojis, he added one of a car.
and on
"Dean," Sam said, annoyed. Dean didn't seem to hear him, and walked to the back of the house. Sam rolled his eyes and continued upstairs.
Cas looks at his blade. He does. Have a weapon. He could use it. Didn’t he train for this, once? He shakes his head in an attempt to clear it.
The word crashed into Dean like a tidal wave. He rolled onto his feet in a flash and crossed the distance between them. He knew what he should do now: salt, silver, holy water. He had to make sure this was real, and not some sick game.
Sam shook his head. He gently disentangled himself from her and sat up; he had a lot to say, and he wanted to sign it to make sure he was clear.
Cas was already there by the time Dean and Miracle reached the hill from the day before; Dean could see him from down the path, silhouetted in the dim morning light. How early did this guy get there? On a whim, Dean took his phone out and took a picture. On the phone screen, it was impossible to tell who it really was, and besides, it was a nice shot, if Dean did say so himself.
“I will.”
"From the Cage?" Cas had asked, thoughtful. He had been about to say no when he saw the pained look on Dean's face. He sighed. "It will take quite a bit of power, but I should be able to get him." And in a flutter of wings, he was gone. That's how Cas always went, using his wings and Angel powers instead of just walking. Though Hell was a little far to walk.
Purgatory might be hell, but at least it wasn’t
“I gotta- We should-” Dean stuttered and shook himself. “Let’s go.” He put a hand on Cas’ shoulder to turn him toward the doors, as he’d done so many times before. A habit. He didn’t seem to know he’d done it, but Cas followed willingly. A habit.
“You don’t seem okay.”
Jack stepped up to the door of the bunker. He hadn’t told anyone he was coming today, but it seemed as good a day as any.
“Sorry I didn’t ask,” Dean said. “I just thought it was a nice picture. For a phone, I mean.” He could see the technical gears turning in Cas’ mind, but there wasn’t any judgment in his face.
She wondered again what
He could have been in his room for twenty minutes or six hours when there was a knock on the door.
“Anything.” Dean leaned forward in his seat slightly, and knew it was true - he’d promise anything to Cas. He’d do it all over if it meant he could end up here again.
"I see you've decided to join us," Ziggy said when Beckett entered the room.
He got up and paced the room. He’d managed a nap in the car, and coupled with how agitated he was, he could tell he wasn’t going to be getting any sleep any time soon.
"Of course I can see you," Cas said. "Don't be ridiculous."
There was something wrong with Dean, Sam was sure of it.
“She was good for you this week though?”
"We will," Sam promised. "Anything else?"
It was a new day, for one thing. A day where he had no agenda, no big picture. He could scroll through the internet looking for hunts, but he found he had no desire to. He’d been burned out a few times before, but this felt worlds different from even that. No, he wanted to hang around and watch movies. He wanted to go on a road trip for the hell of it, not to find some evil thing that lived in the shadows. He wanted to just
Now a response came in.
“I love you,” Cas repeats. He looks up into Dean’s face, but he can’t read the emotions there. “That’s what happened.”
“I’ll see you around, Cas.”
The other man was tall, taller than this Dean person, and his dark hair was a little long. He looked amused. "It's Sam. Your brother?" he said. "How much did you two drink last night?"
“What happened? Before you went to the empty?”
A thought occurs to him. He forces his breathing steady. “Where are you?” he asks the silence. No one appears. “I said,
The flash that felt like a dream crept back into her mind. It had been loud too, she remembered. Sound waves had a distinct feeling that banged against her chest when they were that loud, and even the memory of it made her ears ache.
The demon bent over to study Dean with white eyes at reflected the light with an eerie muted glow.
"You need silver," Cas said.
That was a good question. Cas knew the answer, of course. He’d considered it when Jack had asked him a similar question just the other day. No, the real question was, was it an answer Dean wanted to hear? “What do
“I’m well.”
Cas furrows his brow. “Okay.” When he looks up again, Dean is offering him a sandwich.
The nickname clearly caught Castiel off guard. “And you, Dean.”
“I told you to stop by whenever you wanted,” Cas pointed out. He stepped aside so Jack could enter. He turned and called Dean over his shoulder.
Dean had to think. Just think. So he and Miracle took a long way. And then a longer way. And then Dean finally managed to say, “I had the weirdest dream last night.”
“No.”
The room was quiet and tidy, just the way he’d left it. He sat on the end of the bed, trying to process what Cas had told him.
But that couldn’t be right.
"Yes it is," Al said. "Anyway Sam, Ziggy thinks she knows why you're here."
“I’m sure I’ll see Sam during the week. I’ll tell him then too.”
“Unless you don’t want me to.”
“See you then.”
"Are we talking about the same Apocalypse here?" Beckett asked, sitting in a chair and leaning forward with his forearms rested on his thighs. He had already told his story, and Sam had just finished his.
"Yeah, I understand," Sam said.
Cas looked back up the path, then back at Dean. “People usually make the right to come to the lake.”
Cas paused and turned. “What is it?”
“I was,” Cas starts, then pauses. Sam and Dean are watching him. Those footsteps keep drawing nearer. “I was dead.”
Cas shook his head. “Heaven hasn’t been home in a long time. This feels like home.”
There was one thing Sam had to give Cas, and that was that Cas was far more intuitive than he let on. “Someone didn’t come back.” It wasn’t a question.
it is enough. But the thing is, I never got the chance.” Dean pauses, but Cas doesn’t dare fill the silence. Dean smiles at him, small and warm and sad and nervous and sure and a million other things. “If the Empty made me say that we’re family, and that I love you, and that I need you, then fine. I won’t say those things. They’re true, but I won’t say them. Not unless you believe it’s me.” Dean moves his hands, catches Cas’ with them. His grip is callused and rough and gentle and reassuring, all at once. “I
Dean was grinning now. “It is a good picture,” he agreed. “You take good pictures.”
Cas and Dean looked at each other for a long time.
“Do you ever have weird dreams?” Dean asked, looking down at the dog in his lap.
Cas snorted a laugh, but slid in.
"You're a hologram," Beckett said. "You can't touch anything here."
Eventually Dean joined the main room, and the demons in the line flinched away from the light he still produced. But the fresh souls on the racks were brighter, and eventually Dean found that the demons didn’t pay him any attention.
Dean closed the distance between their lips carefully, not wanting to mess this up. He felt Cas’ hand gently touch the side of his face as their lips moved together, and tension seemed to melt out of his body. He managed to scoot himself closer to Cas without breaking their kiss too much, and he melted against Cas’ side when he felt Cas’ other hand snake around his waist.
"Can't do that," Sam said.
When the door opened, it was Cas who greeted him, his face lighting up when he recognized the visitor. “Jack!”
"The Winchesters," one said excitedly. "Oh, won't this be something special. Two hunters drop into our laps and they're
For all his confusion, Beckett was a good fighter. He dodged and blocked effectively, getting in a good hit every now and then. He kept a grip on his knife and managed to cut the wolves, even managing to kill one of them, though his face paled when the body fell.
"No need to be rude," Ziggy said, sounding annoyed. "I'm going to put him through anyway."
Another step then. And another. He called out again. There was still no answer, so he kept calling. Every few steps. He prayed, as if Cas might be able to hear him that way instead.
Cas answered almost immediately after Dean knocked on the door, a confused look on his face.
“He showed me how he processes his pictures.”
“You were going to save me?” Cas didn’t know why he was surprised at this. This was
He slips his feet in the slippers and takes his suit and coat to his room. He drapes them over the back of the chair at the desk for lack of any better ideas.
Cas stood another moment, taking the time to steady himself. “I don’t know how to thank you Jack.”
Cas looked up with a startled look. He immediately started to draw back. “I’m sorry–”
If this is real, Cas reasons, Dean will simply take him out of here. And if it isn’t, well, then not looking is only breaking his heart half as much as looking would.
Cas nodded. “A twin. His name is Jimmy.”
"Not at the moment," Sam said, opening the refrigerator. "Bingo."
He hated this day. He’d been dreading it. Last year it had brought back memories, and this year was no different. He’d managed to ignore the date for the last week, but it caught in his attention and couldn’t go away.
It took a moment for the confusion in Cas’ face to clear. “Is that me?”
“Dean–”
"Ziggy hasn't gotten that far yet," Al said.
The knocks sound again, slightly louder.
"Only he can call me Sammy."
He let himself remember his dream for all of five seconds before he forced it to the back of his mind. His hands were balled into fists at his sides as he stared at the ceiling, not trusting the darkness behind his lids. The noise from the shower helped him ignore the screaming in his head.
Cas takes them. His fingers brush Dean’s for just a moment and he looks down at their hands, kicking himself for dropping his gaze the second he realizes he’s done it.
Sam and Eileen excuse themselves. Sam squeezes Cas’ shoulder on the way by, and Cas smiles up at him gratefully.
“What do you mean?”
Cas nods. He could swear he hears the Empty behind him, but that could be the roaring in his ears. He can’t be sure of the difference. “It never ends.”
“How’d you come back?” Sam asked when he broke the hug, staying at arm’s length and looking Cas over carefully, as if he could find the answer written on his suit somewhere.
The implication seemed to be that if he didn’t take it everywhere, he definitely took it
Sam jumped and spun in the hall. “Oh, yeah, good morning.”
“The usual.” Dean offers a hand and hoists Cas up when he takes it. “That’s what happens when you come to save your best friend.”
. He’d thought that she would come back when everything was fixed - when Jack undid what Chuck had done. And why shouldn’t she? But she hadn’t. They’d driven by her place on the way home from the hunt. Sam hadn’t requested it, but he knew Dean was curious too. The place had been just as deserted as it had been when they’d left it.
Dr. Samuel Beckett had been leaping for quite some time. He never really knew how much time was passing on a regular timeline, since he was always jumping from year to year, and sometimes he would stay there for a few days, while other times he would stay in the other person's body for weeks. However, he never leaped to a time that was outside his own lifetime, so generally any leap to a time prior to 1953 was impossible. He could remember one or two exceptions, but he'd been doing this so long he couldn't be sure.
Cas smiled at him. “Don’t thank me. You made the impression all by yourself,” he said as he turned back to the camera.
Castiel watched him for a moment. Damn, his eyes really were blue. And then he smiled. It was a small one, but Dean would take it. “I’ll probably be here this week.”
"How?" Dean asked impatiently.
"Glamorous enough for you?" Dean asked.
being dead. She remembered her time in hell and as a ghost. Whatever had just happened to her was something else entirely; there was simply a hole in her memory.
"Oh?" Al asked. "Your brother called you Sammy."
"Why don't you have a seat?" the woman offered when they entered the kitchen. "I'll go write the directions for you."
If Dean was up and out the door with Miracle a little earlier than he had been the day before, it was only because he’d woken up before his alarm and figured he might as well just get up. No other reason.
"How are you here?"
He still regretted the whole demon business. He’d managed in hell without totally becoming a demon (though he wasn’t about to go claiming that it was because of his own willpower), but
"Why's that?" the officer asked.
Dean looks down at himself, and then over at Cas. He’s lit with one of those rare smiles he only wears when he doesn’t think to worry about who might see him.
“Thanks?”
“You’ll be able to visit others,” Cas explained, “your friends. You won’t be bound to one place.”
Sam considered that for a moment. “I have no idea,” he finally said.
Dean gives him an odd look. He steps back, but keeps his arm outstretched, just in case.
Perfect.
They stayed like that, kissing and holding each other, for a long time, until Dean finally pulled back, resting his forehead against Cas’. “I want this,” he said, so softly he almost couldn’t hear himself.
Dean eyed Cas suspiciously, but he crossed to a nearby tree and sank down to the base of the trunk and leaned against it. Then he held an arm out to Cas. “Come here,” he said.
Almost immediately, she saw the bubble pop up that indicated Sam was typing. It was gone after a few seconds. Eileen waited to see if a message would follow, and when nothing happened, she sent another message.
It was odd, to see the date on a newspaper in Hibbing and only think that he
“Yeah, I just,” Sam looked over his shoulder. He was too agitated for Dean’s liking.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut tighter. He tells himself this is fake. He tells himself the Empty is watching. He tries to tell himself any number of things, but Dean’s grip on his arm tightens, and he doesn’t have a choice but to look up.
“I like being up high,” Cas replied. He scrolled back through the pictures as he stepped up to Dean, briefly leaning down to scratch Miracle’s ears. He held the camera out to Dean without removing the strap from around his neck, so when Dean took it, he took the liberty of pulling Cas a little closer under the guise of getting a better look at the pictures.
"Can you guys hear me?"
“What are you going to do with them?”
He knocked on the door instead of just pushing his way in. He could hear voices inside, and he smiled.
Cas’ response to that was a smiley face.
Cas made a face. “Too bitter.”
There’s an exasperated silence. Then a sigh. “Look,” Sam says, “why don’t you just ask him?” There’s a sound of protest, but Sam cuts it off. “It’s almost midnight. I’d like to go to sleep. You won’t tell us why the Empty took him in the first place, so I don’t have any ideas.”
Dean nodded. “Hey Cas,” he said. “What’s the occasion?”
“Jack and I,” Cas said, his expression shifting to one of pride of its own accord. “Well, it was Jack’s idea. We’re removing barriers between heavens.”
“I do too,” Cas replied, pulling Dean closer to his side.
Once he’s on his feet, it takes a moment for Cas’ vision to right itself. He manages a strained smile when he looks back to Dean. “Lead the way.”
“Oh.” Sam wondered when he’d forgotten how to make small talk. “I thought you were human now?”
Cas sighed and crossed to where Dean was, sinking to the ground beside him. Dean leaned against Cas and scooted closer. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean almost automatically, without a second thought.
“And I’ve never done anything horrible?” Dean asked. He held up a hand before Cas could protest. “Look, Cas, we’ve all done some pretty bad things. But you didn’t let me rot in hell, and I’m sure as hell not gonna leave you to rot here.”
Cas leaned forward, knocking his forehead against Dean’s, a hundred different emotions chasing each other across his face. “Happy anniversary Dean,” he said.
Into empty space.
“Cas, you’ve been back for almost two days.”
Through it all, Cas watches Dean. He feels his heart skip every time he slips and looks away, but when he looks back, Dean is always still sitting there, arms resting on the table in a picture of ease that doesn’t quite reach his face.
Dean had tried to prepare this year, he really had. He didn’t think about hell so much when he was awake anymore. He’d actually gotten pretty good at ignoring it in his waking hours (he had more important things to worry about). When he was asleep – that was a different story.
"Always," Sam said, turning his hand over and revealing a pocket knife glinting on his palm.
“Getting something to eat,” Dean says absently.
A bitter laugh escaped Cas' lips. "You left," he said sourly.
“No.” The answer came a little too quickly. “I mean, I can go alone.”
Cas hummed in the affirmative. “And then I was talking to Jimmy after the first day, and he seemed so sure you were flirting with me. I thought that would be nice. To continue that. So I wanted to come more.”
“Very well,” Alastair said, drawing back. He snapped his fingers, and pain ripped through Dean as he found himself back in the line of racks.
, Jack signed. Eileen smiled at him.
Cas clicked over to an editing program, where one of the pictures was open with several different adjustment boxes open, showing different colors and levels that Dean couldn’t begin to understand. “I can do anything with them really. Mainly I play with shadows and contrast. Color saturation.” He played with different adjustments and explained to Dean what they did. Dean nodded along like he understood, and he started to, by the end. He asked what felt like a lot of questions, but Cas didn’t seem to mind.
And Cas was back. Was actually
Sam decided to risk it and took the Impala. He didn’t think he’d need anything from the trunk, but it was the best-stocked car in the garage. Just in case.
The way that grin grows across Dean’s face is something like poetry in motion. His whole face lights up and his eyes are bright. He holds out his hand. “Come home with me?”
Cas laughed, but it was a wet sound and he wasn’t quite surprised to find that he had tears in his eyes. Those he loved. The Winchesters. Sam.
come back. Where was the justice in that? Where was
"I only came to explain," Al said, turning to leave. "I need to get through to Sam so he can get out of your time as quickly as possible."
“You took that?”
“I can take you straight to Sam and Dean, if you want,” Jack offered. “Or I can take you somewhere else first.”
Cas swallows and tentatively steps up to the bed. He watches Dean watching him, but the anxiety that tangles his insides makes it difficult to commit the scene to memory. He has enough of a grip on himself to not be a shaking mess when he climbs in beside Dean and nuzzles into his space, eyes shutting of their own accord. “Thank you, Dean.” He feels rather than hears the deep breath Dean takes.
Dean choked back a sob. He did, didn’t he? Cas always came back. Dean hugged him tighter, determined not to let go this time because yes, this hunt had been a distraction. Everything they’d done since finally being rid of Chuck had been a distraction. All Dean had wanted was another minute like this with Cas, and the possibility of never being able to have one again had simply been too much.
The suspicion in that voice makes Cas feel small. “I don’t mean to worry you.”
“Of course.”
“There’s always something to take pictures of,” Cas said matter-of-factly. “And afternoon light is good.” He lifted the camera to his face and aimed over the lake.
They started in silence. The air still had a golden hue to it, but the temperature was slowly starting to drop.
He could feel Cas’ smile. “Then sleep,” Cas said, his voice rumbling through Dean. “I’ll watch over you.”
for me, so if you don't mind, I'd like for you to put me back."
First, Cas had made a freaking confession of
When he got up, he realized he wasn't dressed, so he went through a duffel bag that was sitting by the door to the small bedroom and found clothes. He kept the knife he had found in his pocket, figuring that if this person slept with it under a pillow it might be useful.
"And wait for something to happen? No thanks," Dean said.
"I remember I had to leave that hunt as you and Sam were going to the farmhouse. When I got back early the next morning, you had a funeral pyre going for Sam. You told me he was bitten and changed with the others when the full moon was out," Cas said gently.
"How can it be twenty twelve? It was just two thousand and ten. Who the hell are you?"
“Dean Winchester,” the demon said, its mouth not moving in the slightest. The voice didn’t seem to come from anywhere, and it rattled Dean’s bones. The hellhounds melted into the shadows around them. “Perhaps you will achieve what your father could not.”
“I hope I’m not intruding,” Jack said. Though he knew he wasn’t; one of the perks of his new power.
Dean’s brow creased. “Your names are James and Castiel?”
He wasn’t, but he nodded anyway. Now or never.
"Oh? You think you missed something?"
“Look, she’s a good dog, whether she finds me a date or not.”
Dean hadn’t been properly prepared to hear Cas’ voice so close to his ear, but he managed not to shiver. “They’re at home then?”
The walk back was more straightforward than the meandering path they had trekked to the lake. And the whole way, Dean felt butterflies in his stomach. He almost scoffed at the idea. Dean Winchester did
Sam made himself something quick and hot for breakfast while he mulled over his thoughts from the night before, his mind a little slow on the uptake from his lack of sleep. When he’d finished breakfast and had the coffee brewing, he heard footsteps down the hall. He thought Dean might be back, but it was Cas who entered.
that. But to love him specifically? Enough to say and differentiate it? “I thought….”
Cas counts to five. There are no footsteps down the hall, so he steels himself and rounds the corner.
Sam stopped short, his body itching to be on the move. “Yeah?”
“I will,” Cas promised, and he was gone again.
There was a terrifying moment of stillness, where Cas might have disappeared entirely, and then he felt solid again. Dean felt Cas’ hands move to his neck and his waist, felt Cas’ mouth move against his. He took his now-free hand and wound it through Cas’ hair. He thought he could live in this moment forever and not think about where he was or what was going on around them or what was about to happen to Cas.
*~*~*~*~*
Dean nods. “I don’t blame you.”
to do? Work in an office? “I want to help you,” she said. “I want to stay and fit here too.”
Cas closes his eyes and takes a steadying breath. This is it. He knows it is. He looks back up, but he still sees Dean watching him. He suddenly panics at the thought of Dean leaving again. “Can you come with me?”
Cas steps back to keep his balance, his arms circling Dean automatically. “Dean?” he asks again.
Around the motel room were a few empty beer bottles and quite a few guns and knives. It looked like someone had been cleaning them.
Her phone screen lit up then. Finally charged enough to unlock.
, and truth be told, she was enjoying him more and more. If their main goal had been accomplished, she was looking forward to having more time to spend with him, away from all the hunts. The thought of their date made her smile, and she longed for another one. She hadn't considered getting out of the life for a long time - because she was good at it, and because she had a bone-deep need to help others - but she was starting to think that there was a balance she could strike.
“Thank you. The stars are my favorite to do.”
They ate in silence for a minute. Dean had to admit it was pretty good.
Jack and Eileen entered with the last of the ingredients they needed for the spell. They set their possessions down on the table by the incantation, not wanting to interrupt.
Dean chuckles. “I know.”
"What the hell Ziggy?" Dean demanded.
“Speaking of,” Bobby said, settling further into his seat, “how are the boys?”
“How did you do that?” Now that he was focused and his grace had settled, Cas could almost hear the hum of power coming off of Jack.
They’re quiet for a moment. Dean shifts his weight from one leg to the other. “Whatever you need, Cas, you know you can ask.”
There’s a light so bright as to override his vision entirely, and when the afterimage has vanished, it’s still just as dark as before.
“Told you he’d be worried about the kid,” Dean says to Sam, who huffs a laugh and lowers his head.
Sam frowned. "No. But I think you need to get up there and take a look."
He could see the faces of the hellhounds, and if he’d thought they were terrifying on the mortal plane, then they were infinitely worse here; they were the size of horses, their thick bodies made of nothing but solid muscle, their teeth long and sharp and bared and sparkling in the white-blue light, each with several pairs of red eyes that watched him as the hounds circled his rack, their ears flattened back threateningly.
Dean relaxes, just a little. “What are you asking me?”
“I think this one gets my vote too.”
"Cas," Sam said. "It doesn't matter. He had a theory about the house. We'll go check it out and go from there."
"I have to leap," Beckett said. "And to leap, I have to change history. And Ziggy says the most likely way for me to get out of this one is to save Sam from being turned into a monster."
Cas stiffened ever so slightly. “Yes. Is that a problem?”
"Let's go find the guns they took," Sam said, heading toward the stairs. "Then we torch the place."
“Sorry, is Cas okay?”
But now there were more growls and snarls, and the shelves were being thrown aside so roughly that Sam had to back away to avoid being hit by debris. There were six wolves left; both of the children were already dead. Three leaped at Sam while the other three went for Beckett.
He regretted his decision that first morning, but he dutifully got up, fed Miracle (so named because she’d been in pretty rough shape at the shelter when Sam had gone to look at her, and he had taken her despite the fact that he hadn’t been sure she’d make it), and drove down to the state park where Sam usually walked her. Dean could have just taken her around the block, but Sam had waxed poetic about this place for a solid ten minutes when he’d mentioned it, and so Dean figured he might as well check it out.
"Alright," Sam said. "The report said he was found in the bedroom. Upstairs." He started to head up and noticed Dean wasn't following him. "Dean?"
Dean finally looked away from the screen and out toward the horizon. “Did you get any good ones this morning?”
Cas nodded and vanished again. Al said something about being back in half an hour and stepped back through his door.
Cas pursed his lips. “Then it’s up to you. I’m okay.”
Dean perked up and stepped inside, taking a seat at the desk lined up on one wall.
Cas almost believes it. Dean’s hand on his arm is comforting anyway. He looks around again at the room, but everyone is still there. No matter how many times he looks from one to the other, they’re still there.
Neither of them said anything for a minute. Dean was clearly out of words, and Cas could feel tears threatening to spill over. To think, he hadn’t expected any of this. He’d been happy to finally let Dean know how he felt, and now… He looked down at their hands on the table and rubbed his thumbs over the back of Dean’s hands. He let out a short laugh when he felt Dean’s grip on his hands tighten.
Cas looked like he wanted to say something else, but he let it drop, at least for now. “Okay.”
“Okay.” Dean tapped his fingers on the tabletop. “You chose to stay here? Instead of in heaven?”
And that was it. Eileen couldn’t remember much else.
“No need to thank me. Consider this my thank you to you.”
The thought was jarring. She’d come back to life once already, but twice? Maybe the Winchesters really were starting to rub off on her.
Cas hummed. “Why, do you not think you’re attractive?”
The getting up early had taken its toll on Dean, and he overslept his alarm by twenty minutes the next morning. He groaned when he saw the time; it was too late now to get Miracle fed and get them over to the park with enough time for a walk before Dean had to get back and get to work.
Cas nodded, though he still didn’t seem totally on board. “Do you want help?”
"No, I'm all for eating them," the second assured them. "I just meant that they're a pretty impressive meal."
“But you weren’t there those next two mornings.”
Cas risks looking toward the entrance to the library. Jack should be
“Listen,” Jack said, clearly sensing Cas’ hesitation. “You’re like humanity. You’re like the souls here. Nothing brings you joy like being with those you love.”
breakfast wasn’t that weird, right? It didn’t have to be a date.
Cas blinks. He stares at the hand. At Dean offering his hand. Belatedly, he reaches out to take it. He watches Dean’s thumb trace a circle across the back of it. Dean’s hand is calloused and rough, but the touch is gentle. “Home.”
And if he did, how could he possibly say they don’t have to talk about this, how could he possibly say he knows where they stand.
It’s too big to think about, so Dean doesn’t. Instead, he drags Cas out of his chair, looking for a better angle, never stopping the kissing. Dean doesn’t realise Cas is pushing him around until his back hits the counter, the bruises there flaring painfully.
The angle is awkward at best and Dean’s lower back twinges, reminding him quite unpleasantly that he was tossed into a bookshelf fuck knows how many hours ago, but he can’t care about this. Not now this is happening.
Dean takes a step back away from the bed, then another, until he’s leaning against the door, head hitting it with a small thud. He exhales slowly and surprises himself when he feels his eyes water. Cas is fine. He’s going to be fine, Dean repeats to himself. He’s not sure why he’s being so…. about it, when Cas is right here.
worried.
Dean makes his way across the kitchen in two strides, has his arms around Cas’ shoulders, pressing their bodies tight together before he even has time to decide he’s going to do it, Cas’ little ‘oh’ muffled against Dean’s chest as they hug.
Happy, perhaps. Afraid, most likely. The cursed combination of both that makes everything he’s metaphorically holding so fucking fragile.
bed. But something is thrumming underneath his skin that makes his hands shake inexplicably against Baby’s steering wheel and it gets stronger every time Dean catches Cas’ eyes through the rearview mirror. He’s fine though. Cas is fine. He’s back. Like always. Except Dean can’t quite believe it so he has to look at the backseat again, and again, and the buzzing gets even worse, distracting and overwhelming. He’s not sure what he wants or, more specifically, what he needs – a drink perhaps? to touch Cas’ arm? to make sure he’s actually there? – but he needs it bad enough that the drive seems unbearable right now.
When he finally feels ready to open his eyes again, he notices the pain on Cas’ face.
“Okay,” Dean replies, slowly turning Cas’ body towards the sink – closer than the toilet – just in case. “Just do what you gotta do, buddy,” he whispers, rubbing Cas’ back.
“No, I –”
“We’ll talk later,” he repeats, mumbles really, before hitting the light and leaving the room like a coward.
“Dean –”
It’s like an angel blade between the ribs, precise and sharp, the pain of the matter-of-factly way Cas expresses his gratitude, like Dean is going out of his way taking care of him, like he’s doing him a favour, like Cas is some sort of
Dean looks at his hands, soft on Castiel’s back. They’re strong sturdy hands, made for hard work and they have worked hard. They’ve killed and they’ve beaten; they’ve tortured and they’ve threatened; they’ve caused a lot of harm in the name of the family business. Carved by his father’s hands into his father’s hands. Dean can’t look at them without seeing his old man, fingers wrapped around a drink or a weapon. The older he’s gotten, the worst it is; the same calluses, the same veins, the same knuckles, the same wrinkles. Even the lines in the palms, unique to all, echo the one who taught him to tighten his hand into a fist and
Cas vomits again.
Maybe that’s why Dean was afraid of it. But with the comforting weight of Cas at his side, Dean doesn’t feel as haunted.
Dean hasn’t said anything yet, but he’s been looking a lot.
under all those new human tremors.
His heart is beating so violently in his chest Dean feels dizzy with it. Fear, worry, confusion; it’s all the same right now, all of it like poison in his veins making it hard to focus. He tightens the hand not pressed on Cas’ back into a fist, trying to get a grip on himself, and he almost misses it when Cas shakes his head, eyes still fixed on the floor.
He can’t be too badly off if he’s joking? Right? Dean swallows hard before reaching for the glass, seeing the way Cas’ grip on it is slack at best.
“Nothing,” Dean says, mostly to himself. “Just really happy to have you back.”
Then, he leaves the bathroom and doesn’t look back.
“What’s the plan?”
, something just for
Cas nods, not even opening his eyes. He looks incredibly tiny for a second, and filthy. Dean hadn’t realised how much while he was curled up on the floor, but debris from the Empty, from God – Jack, Dean mentally corrects – knows what and where sticking to his skin. It must be uncomfortable, but Cas looks two seconds away from passing out so Dean swallows back down his offer to help him get cleaned up.
It gets stuck in his throat, it always gets stuck in his throat. Dean closes his eyes, tightening his hands into fists on the table, inhaling deeply.
“Have you been sitting there watching me the whole time?” Cas asks, still half asleep, squinting at Dean from the bed, fuck knows how many hours later.
He doesn’t think there’s a word that’s been invented yet for all the things that Cas has come to mean for him. And if there is one, Dean, with his GED and his practical brain, doesn’t know it.
“It’s just…” Cas looks like he’s struggling for a second before settling on “growing pains.” Cas heaves once again – it looks painful – and, for a moment, Dean thinks he’s going to puke one more time so he slides his hand up, wrapping it around the nape of Cas’ neck in silent support. “I’ll be fine after I’ve rested.”
He’s still thinking about it, mentally making a weekly recovery meal plan for Cas as he mops the vomit off the floor.
Sometimes, Castiel sees through Dean so sharply, so easily, it’s like a knife to the gut.
But Dean shakes his head and tucks Cas in without meeting his eyes again once he’s horizontal.
“Dean, please. I just…” Cas shakes his head, what looks like centuries of exhaustion poured into the movement. “I just need some sleep,” he finally says in an empty voice. “Please.”
He doesn’t look like he’ll be able to take the blanket off his shoulders, let alone turn the shower on, but Dean isn’t going to hover. No matter how much his fingers hitch to do it all for him. There are some things a man – well, an ex celestial being newly turned human – is entitled privacy for. Cas deserves a moment alone, so Dean swallows back down his worry, his fear, his
And that… that is so far from what Dean expected him to say.
The light over their room door makes a slight buzzing sound and flickers a few times before turning off completely, but they can still see each other in the dawn when Dean finally meets Cas’ eyes.
Next, Dean grabs soap and a washcloth to get started on Cas’ body. But he flinches at the touch of the cloth on his skin, too sensitive perhaps, Dean doesn’t know. He still hums in agreement though, dropping the cloth at the bottom of the tub straight away, soaping up his hands instead, careful when he tries again.
“That hardly matters Dean,” Cas replies in the darkened kitchen, the skin between his eyebrows pinched as he frowns.
“Fuck,” he mumbles to himself, trying to stop, hoping he won’t wake Sammy or their neighbours, and he’s about to untangle himself from Cas’ hug, to try and get this shit back under control when Cas tightens his hold around Dean’s shoulders.
Somehow, at that, Cas’ face morphs into a slightly irritated look.
Dean moves from Cas’ back to his shoulders, down his arms, to his own hands. He washes them, finger by finger, scrubbing the dirt and the blood off Cas’ fingernails. He remembers doing this for Sammy when he was little, finger sticky with whatever Dean fed him that day, remembers the purity of it, the innocence, helping Sam because he was too small to do it himself and Dean loved him.
So, cowardly in many ways, Dean sidesteps this landmine Cas laid on their friendship in his corpse’s wake.
“Oh.” A look of utter confusion settles on Castiel’s face as he’s trying to puzzle it out.
“Don’t leave me alone,” Dean repeats needily against Cas’ mouth when they finally break apart for air, Dean panting between them while Cas barely looks flustered. Damn angels and their lack of human weaknesses.
Dean swallows, hard, suddenly moved without fully knowing why. Naively, he thought maybe the fact that Cas has done this before would make it easier, but he’d be the first to admit that he didn’t exactly have an easy go of it. And this? This is worse, as per Cas’ admission.
Maybe he is just emphasizing the awkwardness of it all, but he can’t seem to stop.
“No,” he repeats, angry at himself for having called Cas his brother one time too many in an attempt to stifle his own feelings. “No,” he says once more, a whisper this time and maybe the third time’s the charm because he decides right here and there that he’s not gonna do this shit to himself anymore. He’s never going to witness Cas’ death again with nothing but regrets on his lips. So he reaches for that new trench coat he isn’t quite sure he likes, and he drags Cas into a biting kiss, years of yearning finally coming to fruition.
Dean barely has the time to sort through the mixture of
“No,” he replies, mostly to himself it seems, head bowed down.
He’s met with silence and he knows, he
Dean laughs. There was a time Cas wouldn’t have cared about such trivial things. It wouldn’t even have occurred to him. And sure, the evident sarcasm in his tone hints at him not caring much about it now, but something loosens a little inside Dean’s chest anyway.
They make their way through the bunker slowly, in silence, until they reach the corridor leading to the bedrooms. Dean hesitates for a beat before leading Cas towards his old bedroom, a door he’s been avoiding even looking at ever since Cas was ripped from him. Opening it while supporting Cas’ weight is clumsier than Dean would like, the ache in his back twitching a little as he twists his body to make it happen. He’s going to regret the moves tomorrow when the bruise aches something fiercer, but Dean would take a lot more pain, for a lot longer, for Cas’ sake.
“Okay, why don’t you lie down. Do you need clothes or –” Dean stops speaking when Cas lets himself fall sideways on the bed, like maybe all he was waiting for was Dean’s permission. He’s asleep the minute his head hits the pillow and Dean spends a few minutes fiddling with the covers and the sheets, making sure he’s properly wrapped up, making sure he’s warm, before stepping away.
If… If he wants to stay, of course.
Dean drops the room key back in his pocket and turns to look at him, heart in his throat when he realises Cas’ face is entirely blank. Someone who knows him less might call it calculated, but Dean does know better.
“That’s alright,” Dean says as comfortingly as he can manage, taking a small step forward. “I’ve got you,” he adds, wrapping an arm around Cas’ waist to support him.
He swallows hard, taking a step aside, away, then shaking his head. He’s not sure what he’ll do if Cas touches him just now, even though he wants it more than anything. Besides, sleep wouldn’t help.
Cas nods, docile and still looking thoroughly exhausted, not even trying to smile – or roll his eyes – at Dean’s feeble attempt at humour. “Yes, I think that would be preferable,” he declares before trying to get up from the bed.
Dean must blackout a little, tired himself out, because, by the time he comes to and starts untangling himself from Cas’ embrace, the darkened sky has started to pinken, hints of the sun starting to peek through. Dean looks at the horizon with stinging eyes and sticky lashes instead of looking at Cas. He can feel the weight of his gaze on his face though and he can’t ignore it forever.
Sam nods, looking a little like a grumpy toddler. “Maybe this wasn’t such a bad idea,” he reluctantly admits with a yawn, awkwardly trying to stretch his long limbs over his head before opening the door and getting out.
“Yeah,” he says, a little breathless, feeling a little dazed. He doesn’t have to only tear things down anymore. “Okay.”
Dean’s not sure why it’s the one thing that finally makes him crumble, he’s not sure why he falls apart like this when he could burst with joy, but his face falls and suddenly, he’s sobbing into Castiel’s chest, the hands he kept on Cas’ shoulders tightening for a second before they fall to his waist, Dean hugging him closer and closer, trying to muffle the sounds of his sobs.
now, not indulge the greedy selfish monster that lives inside of him, the one that orders his little brother around to protect him in his old man’s name, the one that’s so scared of being alone and will never say, the one that clings angrily and leaves claw marks on those he doesn’t want to let go of.
“No,” he replies, voice more hoarse, more tender than he means it to. “Same handsome face, same ugly trenchcoat,” he teases, throat tightening a little on the word ‘handsome’. It’s true, but he rarely lets himself say it. A second passes, then another one, before Dean squints a little. “Although,” he adds, slightly uncertain, “did the Empty give you a makeover?” He reaches across the table to feel the fabric of the coat, a little irritated at the thought of a cosmic being messing around with what he’s long considered
“Did it bring me back wrong?” he asks voice teasing, that smile widening a little.
He could say it now, if he had the courage. But Cas still looks so small, so overwhelmed… And Dean… Dean swallows it all back down. He certainly has enough practice doing that.
Okay, Dean thinks, edging towards frantic. It’s going to be okay. Then, to convince himself, he says so out loud: “Yeah, it’s me, buddy, you’re going to be okay.”
He says the last part hesitantly and the weight of his confession settles over them heavily for the first time.
He stumbles a little, still clinging to that first blanket Dean gave him, but manages to steady himself, one hand against the wall, the other not letting go of the fabric. Dean hovers close just in case, scared this little boost of energy Cas seems to be having isn’t here to last.
“Would you like me to lie?” Cas asks, tilting his head in a gesture Dean has seen him do hundreds of times and suddenly, viciously, he’s reminded of who Castiel used to be, puzzled over humanity’s many quirks and customs.
When their eyes finally meet, they both know that they are thinking about it. Dean knows he must look like a deer caught in headlights, if the way Cas smiles, slightly tense, and mostly knowing, is any indication.
“No, I’m –” Cas starts saying, voice hoarse, just as Dean exclaims “hang on!”, finally letting go of Cas’ back, getting back on his feet and running through the disordered library, the evidence of many all-nighters scattered across the tables and the floor, until he reaches the green blanket he left in one corner a few days ago.
that his dumbass plan to go after him
. “Oh,” Cas whispers, realises. Dean thinks he might be hallucinating a faint glow around him as hope blossoms. “I…”
“Hey,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’ wrist, stopping the movement. He tightens his grip for a second, a pulse of a touch, morse code on Cas’ skin that only Dean understands. “Why don’t we get you cleaned up? You’ll feel much better once you aren’t covered in….” Dean hesitates for a beat, before going with, “the Empty’s spit.”
“Do you have any from a couple days ago?”
However flimsy the certainty, Cas grasps it tight and holds on. He angles his head and slowly, carefully, closes the distance between them. It’s clumsy and tentative and a little awkward, but from the way Dean holds him closer, Cas thinks it must not be so bad. He relaxes, lets Dean lead him through the kiss. It’s slow and almost chaste, and Cas can feel the restraint on Dean’s end almost as much as he can feel it in his own chest alongside his galloping heart. He thinks he would be overwhelmed if it weren’t for the way Dean’s hand traces up and down his back.
“So what now?” Dean asked. He and Cas were sitting together on a sofa in the projection room. They’d rearranged the room a bit to make it more comfortable, and had spent the whole day watching movies. At least in theory. Dean knew he hadn’t really been paying attention to them. He didn’t think Cas had been either. But Sam and Eileen had been around, so Dean hadn’t really had a good time to ask until Sam and Eileen had turned in.
“Cas, are you coming?”
“Good morning,” Cas says and signs as he enters. He accepts Sam’s offer of coffee, and gladly accepts Eileen’s offer of creamer. He pours the one into the other until his drink is less brown and more beige. He sits quietly as they get back to their conversation.
"Don't you dare tell me I didn't help him the first time through. Don't you dare, Cas."
“I think I can rebuild heaven’s ranks,” Jack said with a nod. He turned his gaze back to the table. The map was gone, replaced by a list of symbols, each representing an angel. “I want angels to
“I am saying that. Are you saying that?”
Dean laughed. “Figures.” He wrapped Jack in a hug anyway.
Dean shrugged noncommittally. “Miracle needs a couple walks a day,” he said by way of explanation. Then he took a chance and said, “She missed you the last couple of mornings.” We missed you.
There was some combination of embarrassment and delight on Cas’ face that Dean would be remiss to say wasn’t adorable on him. “You can. I don’t promise to pick up on it though.”
They sit in silence for another moment. Dean leans forward on crossed arms. “No,
Another frowning emoji.
Dean didn't like the murderous look this Cas person was giving him, but he continued. "My name is Dr. Samuel Beckett. I'm a quantum physicist. I developed Project Quantum Leap to explore time travel. I stepped into the machine, and I've been leaping between people ever since."
"That so?" Sam asked.
Sam nodded as if this made perfect sense, though perhaps it did. “Right, um,” he said. He looked over his shoulder at Dean, who was still on the floor of the barn, propped up on his elbows. “I should, uh, go find the kids.” He nodded as if giving himself permission, and ducked out of the barn.
It does take some time, in the unchanging landscape, for him to realize that he’s awake. He shouldn’t be. He knows he shouldn’t be. He waits for the Empty to appear, to do
“You’re hurt,” he says with a soft, yet disgruntled voice, like the mere thought of Dean being in pain is a personal affront.
Dean has to admit he looked and sounded a lot more awesome in his fantasy. Not that he allowed himself a lot of time to daydream about reuniting with Castiel, the fear it wouldn’t happen, the pain of the loss, too tangible for him to lose himself in the comfort of an imagined rescue. But when he did… Well, Cas wasn’t in pain for starters. And Dean had more to say that half-hearted reassurance. The reality of it is cold and scary and Dean feels… Dean feels utterly helpless, wants so fiercely to fix it and doesn’t know how.
No. He needs to sort out the library. There’s still puke and black goo all over the floor, an entire bookshelf of books and scrolls and volumes scattered everywhere after Dean was thrown against it, not to mention the result of days and days of neglect while Dean was researching the best way to sneak into the Empty; dirty plates and notebooks as well as too many coffee mugs for Dean to own up to spread around the tables. Some of them on the floor. It’s a mess and clearly, Dean thinks, as he gives Cas one last look before finally leaving the room, he’s got time.
“Well, you clearly need the beauty sleep,” Dean replies, gruff, defensive, before turning the car off pointedly.
do this. Not yet, not now.
It’s late one morning, months later, Dean’s room darkened except for the light coming from his phone as he silently scrolls through houses listings, trying his best to angle the screen so as not to wake Cas, sound asleep behind him, his arms tight around Dean’s torso.
Seeing Cas so vulnerable is harder than he thought it would be, it tugs at something in his lower belly, makes him shake with a fierce need to wrap him up in his arms and never let go again. Not after the Empty, not after all the ways he’s lost him before. Except Dean needs to take care of
“Think this motel is haunted?” he asks jokingly, voice hoarse, eyes looking up to the burnt-out lightbulb for a second.
It’s an understatement too. He almost died today. And he didn’t care.
Usually, highly emotional situations rob him of his tongue, but now, nervous like he’s never been before, Dean can’t seem to shut the fuck up.
It’s as void of any personal touches as ever, but the sight of the obviously slept in bed makes Dean smile, half a grin, only a tiny thing in the corner of his mouth really. Dirty sheets and twisted blankets, one of the pillows on the floor, not to mention the glass of water and the bowl Dean left behind; all proof that it’s real, that Cas is really here.
“It’s been a long day,” Dean insists and there must be something in his tone, on his face, because Sam shuts the hell up.
Cas doesn’t laugh, thoroughly unsatisfied by Dean’s dismissal of his own suffering. But then, he always was; frowning disapprovingly every time a fake ‘I’m okay’ came tumbling out of Dean’s mouth over the years. Dean always wondered if Cas’ was too powerful to be lied to, or if he just always knew him too well and could see through the facade.
It quickly becomes apparent that Cas isn’t well enough to make it there on his own, so Dean wraps his arm around Cas again and helps him in.
Dean startles when Sam knocks on his window and he frowns at him before opening the door and finally getting out of the car. “What?” he asks, a little shorter than he means to be.
Dean slides into the room carefully, barely pushing on the door to close it, making sure he’s as silent as possible. Though he’s pretty certain with how exhausted he is, Cas could sleep through the next apocalypse.
, takes his breath away.
“It…. It all feels… new,” Cas finally adds, slowly, painfully, like every word is costing him. “It’s a lot,” he repeats in a mumble, to himself, the low rumble of his voice still comforting for Dean who, for the past few months, thought he would never hear it again. “Being human, it’s….” Cas shakes his head, the puzzled expression on his face alien and angel-like, a reminder it’s still
, his brain unhelpfully supplies, reminding him that he does, in fact, know. He dismisses the thought, as he always does when the topic of his time downstairs is brought to the front of his mind.
Dean closes his eyes tightly for a second before rubbing at them. Against his every instinct, he leaves the room.
“All I’ve done is rest since I’ve been back Dean,” Cas says matter-of-factly. “Tell me,” he demands, putting his other hand over Dean’s, the two of them tangled, and suddenly, it’s not enough, it seems so ridiculous how far apart they’re sitting, considering.
“I never thought it meant…” Cas smiles, softly, privately. “I never thought it meant what I wanted it to.”
Silently, he holds an index up to stop Cas from sliding under the covers and when Cas tilts his head, eyes sleepy, Dean smiles at him, unable to hold back when he looks so rumpled and relaxed, wet hair ruffled and sticking up everywhere. Once upon a time, Castiel led armies in Heaven and here he is, adorably falling asleep in Dean’s bed. It helps that colour has finally started to return to his cheeks, the nap, and especially the shower, doing wonders for his well-being. He still seems tired, the exhaustion of the reshaping of his entire cosmic being not something that will vanish with a couple of hours of shuteye, but he no longer looks on the brink of death. The gnarling in the bottom of Dean’s stomach, the incessant pit of
