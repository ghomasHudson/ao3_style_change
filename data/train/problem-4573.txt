The demons stop their mad rush at the Hunters and look up the hill, to find it bristling with iron-tipped holy-water-doused arrows, salt-round loaded rifles with flints about to strike the pans, and mages starting to whisper incantations under their breath. Sam and Sir Robert sit side by side on their chargers on the cusp of the hillock, the prince’s hand held high, ready to signal and rain down holy hell. The demons thought they were the ones doing the ambushing, following the straggling group of Hunters who seemed to be so helpless far from their main forces...  but for once Crowley’s underhanded information proved reliable, the main forces knew exactly where and when to circle around the marshes to make it up the hill on the demon’s left flank, and the humans have now turned the tables.
But Dean was not allowed to look for a shortcut, he got the full explanations anyway and even had to provide some of his own on the whole ‘hookup’ concept, which was made a tad less boring when the hogtied soldier of the Lord at his feet looked like he was having an aneurysm every time Dean said the words “the angel I’m screwing.”
“Oh, it’s fine, I know how my reappearance after such a long absence seems strange,” says Lutecia with a kindly smile at Dean which she then shares with Castiel. Her voice is light, it lilts like a songbird’s, it’d be quite pleasant in other circumstances. “I’ve already explained the circumstances to your liege and his councilors, but you were not there at the time, my good sir. Yes, I was in Lawrence during that fateful spring of 1226, I had just arrived that day in the allied camp with a small contingent from Raspail to offer our assistance, paltry as it was, I with my healing skills, while my guardsmen were to join the army. But then the attack… so horrible…” Her expression clouds over, sorrow pales her cheeks, her hands flutter to her chest and clasp as if in prayer. “So many dead… but I found his majesty just in time. The good Lord himself guided my steps to that fortification, that is the only explanation. But healing the damage that the spawns of Satan had inflicted… it used up all my magic and nearly cost me my life. My faithful bodyguards had to remove me from the field, insensate.” Her graceful gesture takes in half a dozen men standing behind her. They’re in the more wearable and furniture-friendly hauberk mail rather than full plate, but the white surcoats mark them as more Crusaders. Their hands are on their swords and their eyes are on the one-time angel. Lutecia did not seem to mind Castiel’s questioning, but her men don’t seem particularly pleased.
Dean’s next words are cut short by a crackle of magic like a lightning strike. The light of the sun wavers and dims, and the muddy sand of the beach roils and shapes itself into strange, profane patterns.
over him. It riles him that his problems have once more taken front and center, and everyone else is running around him trying to compensate for his screw up.
With his usual foresight, Sam closes the office door behind them to indicate the two alphas don’t want to be interrupted. John putters over to the sideboard for a mug and some hot water from the kettle on the kerosene burner that’s always lit while he’s in his office, next to the decanter which spices the tea up as heavily as needed as the day drags on. He hands Dean the leaves and strainer, sits down, takes a sip of his own brew, patiently waits for his eldest son to broach the subject that’s making him fiddle with his fingers and clear his throat repeatedly.
“If you’ll excuse me- oh, Garth, can you?” Victor scoops up the puppy, giving his troops a picture perfect moment that Dean is gonna treasure forever. Damn if it that ain’t cute.
“Yeah yeah, you’re gonna need to go to bed soon. How are you going to manage with all this illegality going on?”
Dean was already asleep, with the proficiency of a soldier used to a decade and a half of campaigns. Normally he slept on his back, snoring faintly; tonight he’d turned on his side, facing away from the angel and the fire. Maybe it was significant, maybe it wasn’t, but Castiel did not think he was imagining the small distance there, a bit of a breach. Yet they hadn’t entirely lost the connection that’d arisen between them for all that. It was a bond he was having a hard time defining, woven from the danger they faced, the isolation, the silences and the occasional talks, as well as from Castiel’s sincere admiration for Dean’s abilities to hide his trail from anything supernatural and natural. This bond was made up of earlier memories too: Dean laughing, building a table for their family, trying to get him to taste pie ‘because who the hell can’t like pie, man!’ This link between them… sometimes Castiel had the rather blasphemous notion that the Machine had only just slapped its benediction onto something that was already there. These past few days of seeing Dean at his savage best, eyes keen, easily riding the tension as if evading angels and the damned alike was a vicious game...it reminded him of the elusive man he’d chased through the streets of Paradise. Those were his very first memories of Dean; colored by a blend of irritation and faint admiration, crystalizing in fierce satisfaction when Dean Winchester
By the counter, the waitress glances at her watch and sighs. The way those two are making googly eyes at each other, they’ll be here awhile yet. So much for getting off early on her weekday shift. Anniversary, right. Who celebrates an anniversary over beers, dinner burgers and a discussion about raccoons…?
“I’m just saying, Cas, the more of these infernal lieutenants we kill, the better. It’s been six months since we last had an incursion over the border back home.” Because they’re not even in Lawrence at this point, they’re four days into the eastern wilderness far from a friendly fortified base, and Dean thinks it’s wise to take
This quiet moment after dawn is an opportune time to jump right back onto that. Alternatively, he could use Sam’s laptop to look for leads on Metatron. Or he could just sit here and cogitate on the strange incident of the beer bottle. Nothing else has exploded in the two weeks since that occurrence, and the Winchesters haven’t found anything untoward haunting the bunker, but beer bottles do not spontaneously self-destruct. There has to be something odd and possibly ominous going on there.
Even Dean’s anger deflates under Cas’s single-mindedness in the face of all distractions. Like Cas, he promptly classifies Lydia and her objections as non-events, not worthy of attention, and turns to his scattered group. “The injured, go into the cabin.” Roy has a bullet hole in the shoulder that Nicola is putting pressure on, Cole and Marina have through-and-throughs to the forearm and the butt respectively, and Jo has red streaks on her cheek from a bullet that hit the tree trunk and sent splinters flying up towards her face. “Warm up, drink water, keep pressure on those,” he adds to the three with bleeding injuries, field-packed. “Taylor, go with them, start helping. Cas will get to them after he’s done with Victor. The rest, and you guys,” he faces the Ranchers. “Put up a ring of defenses. There are some nine hostiles still out there, maybe more.” Pretty gutted hostiles, he thinks, but he’s not taking chances. “Just close ranks for now, and start sorting yourselves out into groups for patrols. When I’m back, we’ll do sweeps.”
Castiel looks down at the cut made by a demon’s greataxe. Castiel has never had to sew anything in his life, at least nothing as delicate as the cotton and velvet embroidered surcoat of a king. Back in Lawrence, the kindly castle housekeeping staff darn his socks and fix the holes he also picks up in his clothes from various weapons, and quietly thank him for watching over their king when they return the articles. But he and Dean are not in Lawrence at present, or in the comfort and safety of the king’s castle. Castiel was the one to remove Dean’s bloodied surcoat to see how bad the injury was a couple of hours ago, and he was left with the proof of the close call in his hands once Max took the king away from the battlefield for healing. He sponged off the blood - most of it invisible in the deep rich brown - but the hole seemed to gape wider and wider as Castiel waited for news from Max in the makeshift infirmary. Finally he sat down and fixed the gap with a piece of cloth cut from one of his spare jerkins, the underside of which, was a reasonably clean untainted linen. He cut it as big as his concern at the time, so it widely covers the cut. He wanted to be sure the repairs held, so he darned it very carefully and repeatedly along the edges, all around the sleeve.
“That’s… a surprise. I mean, I sort of wondered- hell, what am I saying, I’ve been wondering for years, but I’m still surprised. If this was going to happen, I thought it’d be ages ago, not-... well, now, what with everything.”
“-do us some good, yeah, yeah, don’t worry, I think I can sleep now,” Dean lies, pushing back his chair. “Goin’ to bed.”
The demons glance at each other in search of moral support, as unlikely as that is for Satan’s abominations. Fortunately when the Pit was handing out infernal merits, it seems to have missed these jesters. The summoning ritual that brought them out of Hell to possess the humans must have been a quick and dirty affair, grabbing the first half dozen fiends available, and since there are a whole lot more minions than masters down there, the chances were good that the summoner was not going to luck into the best of the best. Lutecia, if this is her doing, must have assumed six demons of whatever stripe was amply sufficient. Her miscalculation.
A long time ago, there were breeds. He’s seen them in an Old World book in their small schoolroom, full of gloriously colored pictures so real they leap off the page for all that age has yellowed and dimmed them. Big dogs, ridiculously small dogs, super-lean dogs, massive mutts, weird things with extraordinary floppy ears or bodies that go on forever.
“Heard of those, hm? We garrison staff are more likely to fall foul of them than you soldiers. They’re awfully clever little things, if utterly ruthless. Any invasion of the mind triggers a sigil that releases a portion of the soul’s power right into the face of whichever angel has his mental fingers in the pie. I heard Uriel tripped one of those and it clipped his wings - at least when it comes to reading minds now,” said Balthazar, who might no longer be part of Intelligence but was still a determined gossip by the looks of it. “I take it you’ve not had the pleasure.”
The words of panic rush, a rising wave. The cambion has toddled through sand and reached the angel, fastening hands on the edges of his trenchcoat for balance and looking at Dean with frightened eyes full of tears.
“No! You're nasty to him!” said Ben, apparently not afraid of irony. Though his next words indicated that he was perhaps talking from a place of a child's clarity: “You don't just tease him or fight with him, you really hate him! I hear how you talk about him when Dean’s not around!”
And if that failed to temper his dark moods, he’d reread all the letters exchanged with his brother Gabriel, exiled for twenty years now in a far northern country where they worshipped pagan
“You can only turn back into a prince,” corrects Dean in deference to the tidy white uniform with gold epaulettes, shining buttons, coat of arms picked out in gems on the breast pocket and regal circlet on top of the guy’s nut - “when you’re standing in the water of this lake under the light of the moon. Otherwise you’re stuck as a swan. But you can still talk.”

In her spot wedged between the door and the fireplace, Ginny, sleeping on her back with her legs in the air like she just don’t care, gives a sudden sonorous snore and flops over on her side without waking up. Watching the snoozing dog puts ten pounds of tiredness into Dean’s drooping eyelids. He carefully wraps up the book again, making sure everything is in place, and turns the knob of the lantern. He’s asleep before the flame even gutters out.
“But they are.” Seeing how seriously Cas is taking this, Dean forgets his rag in the goose grease jar and puts the boot down on the floor. “Hon, relax. Three months after
Balthazar rubbed his eyes, one of his quaint human gestures. “Cassieeee, don’t be so naive. Yes, that’s a great explanation, but I know how these yahoos work. There’s a reason they’re not on the front line, or working in a Paradise. These are the most dogmatic unimaginative angels you can dream up. They would not have put two and two together unless there was an unofficial note on the report - the kind I’d stick on to highlight dangerous situations while keeping it on the down low. Somebody put a great big warning label on this order so that by the time it arrived to get sorted and followed, it was obvious there was a serious problem and it needed to be booted up to someone with pull. I’ll talk to the guys in charge there, I have my ins and outs still, but I’d be surprised if they can help me track where the original warning came from. My intuition tells me this is going to be a dead end. It tells me something else, too...”
Sam stared, then looked over Castiel’s head as if expecting Dean to intervene. Dean was staring straight ahead at the road, as he’d been since leaving the Harvelle residence. He said nothing.
Off to one side and out of his line of sight, his two ‘guests’ jumped a mile. Colt heard the rustles of weapons being drawn and the creak of hammers being thumbed. He instinctively analyzed each tiny noise with the precise ear of a connoisseur. A Derringer - that’d be Charles then - and a Lefaucheux. Ah, Henrietta. Both weapons had been heavily modified and retrofitted with Colt’s new mechanically-rotating cylinder system, and they never left their owners’ sides.
Cas returns the embrace in silence for a few seconds. “She’ll be pushing. And she won’t be the only one if I can’t quash them adequately from the start. If we don’t feel as if I’m mastering them… then my body won’t respond and I won’t be fertile.”
“Blow me down, I actually made it.” Dean came through the door and leaned against it like he was expecting a phalanx of soldiers to burst through behind him. He didn’t look directly at Castiel, just thrust out his hand. “Here, for you.”
“Very well,” concedes Sam with a certain lack of grace. “I’ll cover the skies while you kick down the front door and roust him. Do you have your eyeglasses?”
Cas let out a huff like a chuckle against Dean’s forehead and pulled him close, putting an end to any conversation.
“Is that a problem? And don’t give me the ‘you’re the king so I don’t get to judge’ crap, just-... just don’t.” Dean speaks sharply, but there is something oddly vulnerable in his very abruptness.
“What the hell was that?! You were supposed to wait for me!” Sam shouts, waving a now-useless machete around at the three dead critters, strewn around in pieces throughout the room which is doing slow spins around a pummeled Dean. That really was a close one… Dean’s good enough to go toe-to-toe with two vampires, but three? No, that shoulda been a certain one-way ticket outta here. Fortunately when he kicked the china cupboard at the third asshole, desperately trying to buy himself enough time to finish off the guy’s two compadres, the stupid fanged bastard managed to trip on its legs and fall into its glass panel head first, doing a fairly decent job of self-decapitation, at least decent enough to last until Dean came over and finished the job.
Castiel tears his eyes away from a swaying Lutecia to stare at Dean. “No she’s not. Which makes her a liar, and probably part of a plot to-”
In his arms, the sleeping baby twitches and his face tightens. He suddenly looks very red and grumpy.
“Wait, the Machine didn’t tell you? Like, why? Wait, don’t tell me, you don’t know and you don’t question.” Dean rolled his eyes. He was annoyed at Castiel’s unquestioning obedience to his Father’s manifest Will rather than furious at his elimination of over three hundred people. Castiel wondered briefly if this would make sense if he, too, were human.
The eyes of the central figure came back to him in a flash. That glare over the bandanna… It’d been faintly familiar, but he’d not had time to place it in that split second. But he thought he recognized that hateful glare now, and no, not a friend. And though his group fell under the four-and-twenty blackbird umbrella, they were not a part of the railroad or the Joker’s branch of the resistance, not at all. Gordon and his lot had their own agenda. Dean had good cause to know. Back when he’d been marched off to war, in the horror and the fury and the fear of the third year of his deployment. The Hunters had fallen back and he’d been garrisoned in temporary camps and some endangered Paradises, and there he’d joined in with Gordon and his lot. Just for a few months. Fortunately he’d not been in deep enough where he could not back out. But deep enough where he’d done things he’d regret - deeply, harshly - all his life. Deep enough where he’d seen what kind of man he could become if he let himself.
Cas straightened up from the tomato plant he’d been instructed to check for aphids. Dean saw him stare at the far corner of the communal garden area.
“You dare- Castiel- this monkey-” Zachariah gathered himself up and threw a venomous look at Dean. “You will show some
of curiosity, he’ll ask you questions I never even thought of.” A friendly omega will make Cas more comfortable.
...Dean had questions now. This was the point where one pumped the brakes and asked for explanations.
“We’re back in I-don’t-give-a-shit territory. Get to the part where you send me home, and if you do it in under ten minutes, I’ll even spare you a few drops of my blood instead of settling for a gallon of yours.”
“We thought you were dead. We mourned you.” Castiel sounded gutted - worse, betrayed. The spring of insane anger slowly coiling up inside Dean tightened another notch. “And you were hiding. All this time. You’ve been colluding. With the humans.” A wild glance at the man next to Gabriel. “With The Enemy!”
Her fine glare bounced right off his hide. He hooked her by the arm and headed towards the kitchen. A glance back before the door closed showed that Cas was staying put, though a look of almost painful indecision was scrawled over his face.
Castiel, with reflexes he didn't know he had, grabs a shield and puts it between himself and the advancing beast just as the raccoon leaps at him.
Even across the feet of space separating him, he can feel Dean flinch. His lover’s hand flies to his mouth, hiding his expression, but his eyes are wide and boil with conflicting emotion.
“Will be here by tonight. I radioed Woodson first thing yesterday. They relayed the message, and our people were in an outlying post near the border with a receiver station. They’re double-timing it back. Woodson were kind enough to provide them with dog sleds and a team to help. They should be here soon.”
The Pit was Lucifer’s greatest insult to God. Even after his death, it churns out ceaseless hordes of demons meant as twisted parodies of their Father’s angels; genderless, dimensionally-fluid beings wielding unnatural magic in lieu of grace, the dark to the angels’ light. But to be perfectly honest, despite the mockery these sick creations represented, most angels in Heaven had been subversively happy at their appearance during the first age of this world. What were the celestial beings supposed to do otherwise, sit on a cloud and preen for the rest of eternity? But here was something that was in direct contradiction of God’s final commandments, a mockery of his great work. The angels fell into ranks to defend humanity and all of creation from Lucifer and his army, a hard battle at times, but at least it was something to do.
As one, they transfer their pondering look from the bed, to the empty space on the opposite wall (handily near the chimney so Cas can keep warm) and then to the table, which honestly was only ever big enough for one person anyway. At the far back of Dean’s noggin is a sort of wonder at what he’s doing right now. Okay, let’s get one thing straight, no way no how can the label ‘romantic’ be stuck on Dean ‘The Dude’ Winchester. Let that be clear. But okay, he’s occasionally had daydreams in the past- an impression, really, an idea, let’s say, of what it’d be like when he finally got mated. He imagined it’d be sex pretty much continuously, bar some occasion where a loudmouth beta rookie would show up out of nowhere to insult Dean’s mate, allowing Dean to show off by beating the bastard up in the best of traditions before dragging his other half back home where it was safe and they could have a lot of sex all over again.
Dean remembers (barely, he was only four) a few strange empty years. He remembers hunger in the winter, he remembers haggard faces and people missing in the spring, he remembers betas fighting savagely out in the open, and John coming down like God’s hammer left, right and center. He remembers the day they brought his mom’s body back, the winter sky as grey and heavy as the smoke lifting from the Weeping Grounds south of camp, where all the pack’s ashes go to rejoin the earth. No, these days, not many stories have a happy ending.
“No, what I mean- the behavior I’m talking - the initial impression people had for a long time that wolves had alphas, betas and lesser members, a strict hierarchy, is incorrect, it was based on observations of wolf packs that were set up on large nature reservations by humans. For a long time, people thought they were representative of how wolves in the wild behaved, but that’s inaccurate. These caged wolf packs were composed of random members unrelated by blood, heavily stratified, with constant contestation from the beta layer to the single alpha breeding pair. Which is pretty much what we have, if you count obvious differences due to the fact that we’re an intelligent species. But this is not natural, it’s artificial. Do you remember our discussion from a few months back, when you told me that the organisation of our packs - with breeding alphas, betas, omegas, do you remember you pointed out that this is the law of nature? Well that’s not the case for wolves at any rate. Wild wolves are different. There are not really alphas, betas and omegas among them. Almost all wolf packs are nothing more or less than families. The alphas - you can’t even call them bends anymore, there’s just two parents, the breeding pair, and the children. And that’s how they live.”
Eileen was looking at him keenly, eyes flashing between his expression and the two kings sitting back near the fire. Fortunately she couldn’t hear what they were talking about, or she might wonder at the way Castiel’s face had fallen. He knew what Dean thought of him, but it was still hard to hear him toast a dead woman when his husband was in the room… His fingers were white around the column of the candelabra, the light of the candles shook over Queen Mary’s portrait.
Unspoken, the words were like a spring, winding Cas up and setting him on that pacing. Now they’re out, he’s stopped moving, face turned towards the fireplace, hands propped against the mantle, staring blankly into the fire with an unhappy turn to his mouth.
nice timber. Deep and- and kind of like the feel of running your hand over freshly carved oak, it catches your fingers subtly on the grain before letting them slide smooth over hard wood… The thing is, Dean’s been a hunter for nigh on six years, and as John’s eldest boy, he’s active in and around the whole camp. He’s damn sure nobody has a voice like that around. Definitely not the couch, which has never bothered to speak to him before.
“You okay?” Dean asked, because even though he’d only been at the heart of the flash for an instant… he’d gotten pretty badly nuked. His demonic ability to heal was being put to the test. It’d already gotten its monthly workout trying to get him functional earlier after Michael hit him. And good thing it’d glued him back together before Magic Mike smote him for real instead of merely toying with him. That… would have been painful beyond belief. It would also (likely, probably, according to the latest polls on the subject) not have actually killed him, leading the host to investigate this phenomena of an apparently immortal knight of hell. If the Blade or the Mark had come to light while Dean was helpless, he’d be currently sharing an address in Nowhere, Missouri with a pissed-off Cain...
Dean ripped up the note, trying not to give the ravine a suspicious scrutiny. “I don’t rightly know. He’ll have his reasons.”
“Dean!” Lutecia cries out, sounding frail and young and utterly terrified. “Save me! This hateful man attacked me! He had demons with him - they slaughtered my friends!”
“Sam?” Cas ground out, his gravelly voice deepening with pain. “Why would they- wait!” He didn’t let Dean squirm away, holding him so tight it made Dean’s bones ache.
“… I made a mistake. I am not familiar with the art of malediction. I don’t have that level of power yet anyway, I am only a few hundred years old. My mother handed me the reins of her own master spell to shape as I will to create the curse, so I put the people to sleep to protect them from the killer plants-”
Each and every time he and Sam close in on a new demon, they only find a human, either dead or in a hospital raving about black eyes and rotten eggs. At first Castiel thinks the demons are getting slippery, but then he overhears a few of the victims mention they’d been saved by someone. A ‘Mr Smith’, he apparently called himself, from what the victims babble to their nurses, police detectives or psychiatrist.
“Aah, gotcha. Got a last name? Uh, not that you have to tell me if you don’t want to.” Foreign betas, now, Dean’s used to dealing with those, but foreign omegas are rare. The only thing rarer is a foreign alpha who’s not trying to rip Dean’s throat out. Bringing up any stray’s past is fraught, an omega even more so, and the way Castiel’s eyes are now once more firmly fixed on Dean’s clavicle informs him that, yep, Dean’s a moron who just made shit awkward.
That wasn’t Castiel’s recollection- was Alfie even there for that first meeting? He can’t recall. And what was that ‘saved’-
Yeah, that’s Thing Two Dean learns. That even at death’s door, he’s not worth a return phone call from their father.
The silence grows thick and tangled, and there’s a precarious little moment there, but Crowley quickly lowers his head - that’s the mutt’s gesture alright - and he also holds out his hands, nice and empty and clear away from his belt and any weapons. Submitting to the strongest person present of the pack whose territory he invaded unintentionally (or so he claims.) Dean’s a long shadow of silence and threat still, he’s aware of where everyone in his team is and god help this Crowley if he looks away from Dean’s chest and lets that gaze linger too long on one of Dean’s people.
These memories shine brighter than the billion years of being an angel that precede them, they feel more relevant by far. There’s even times when Castiel almost… not forgets, no, but he only remembers intellectually those unchanging unyielding millenia of cold duty, all melding into a blank wall of Before, one that he lost - or escaped - to start anew in the world. His memory, his very life truly started the day he met Dean. His lover and his friends accept this, that Castiel cannot talk about his past, that he has none in a way; and as long as his future is with them, they seem content with that.
There were checks and balances. The humans had had to create them in order to simply spiritually survive this- this killing kindness the angels had imposed on them, this perfect world. Even more so to survive the occasional snakes still left in the Garden, snakes like Uriel.
A clunk and a splash echo from the kitchen, and suddenly Kate is in the room with them like a jack in the box, hands all soapy.
His brother has mastered the art of the loaded ‘oh’. This one says, ‘and I’m sure that the fact that Charlie and Rowena have started setting up a nursery has nothing to do with your sudden love of nature. I see you’re still giving denial a good workout.”
He finally looks back at Dean, who’s slumped in the sand. His lover is staring at them, his breath fast and choked with blood, or possibly sobs. His face is such a mess of blood and bruises, it’s hard to tell, but Castiel thinks he might be crying.
Henry (not his given name this morning, but it was now) stared blankly at nothing. The child had seen the person he thought was his mother ripped apart by Croatoans two days ago, before Colt could intervene. He’d not said a word since.
A rapid series of flutters- shit! Doing a fast search again! Dean felt a massive bulls-eye on his back, felt like any second now he’d get grabbed-
“A landmine.” His voice is dull, heavy. “Of all the things of the past to reinvent-... never mind. Did you get a look at it? At what was left? Did it throw up fragments?”
True, Dean hadn’t actually said that. But it seemed he was-... not polite, no, but he wouldn’t try to hurt someone’s feelings for all that. A small mercy; Castiel's feelings were not often spared. Michael and Naomi castigated him freely, the  courtiers had followed their lead, albeit more subtly and behind his back. Even Chuck, when he lived, had wondered aloud and in Castiel's presence what could possibly be done with someone so lacking in interest that, if he were in one of the king's tales, the author would have killed the angel off promptly at the end of the third stanza. In contrast, ‘this is a political marriage so there’s no need to actually lay together’ was almost refreshing in its honesty and lack of immediate insult, while the tacked on suggestion that Dean might one day change his mind, though unlikely, was at least a palliative to the idea that Dean didn’t want to touch him at all.
He expected caves of doom beyond the dread portal, and was rather surprised to find a tidy space the size of a large barn, a typical looking railroad waystation with benches, blankets, camp beds in a corner for potential refugees, a cheerful fire crackling in an open hearth in the center - because it turned out, it
“Right this moment? Staring down at you in wonder. Never thought I’d see the mighty Castiel flat out on his stomach.” Balthazar had his customary amused drawl firmly in place.
“Balthazar. He’s chased half the skirt and tail in 342, those that weren’t scared of a bit of penance if caught.” So not that many in sum total, but Balthazar didn’t seem to mind the myriad times his flirting was shot down.
Dean force his hands to stay innocently at his sides, though he was not actually armed. Even his demon killing knife had been left behind with Benny, who would continue serving the railroad for as long as humans survived. Dean had nothing on his person that could be construed as a weapon, though he had slipped six bullets in his coat pocket on leaving, ammunition Colt had thrust into his hand ‘on the off chance’.
After a whole thirty seconds of silence, Cas said in his usual matter-of-fact voice, “Do not push the bullet in deeper.”
Dean staggered in the sudden tornado of dust and paper that had sent every torch in the place whipping like banners. Loose pages full of Kevin’s scribbles lifted up on a sudden sharp wind and carried away his hat. And he’d seen something, a flicker in the air, like that time Balthazar had shielded him from Michael’s light; as if something massive and bright had moved through the air in front of him for a brief moment, intangible and almost invisible, a massive wing sweeping out, and -
What exactly might had been in the cards, Castiel isn’t entirely sure; the whole “You had me at Hello”-kissing-intimacy bundle, probably. That had been a potential outcome, though Castiel hadn’t thought of it until Dean mentioned it. It's good to know what is or isn't possible. Now he's going back to the library to look for ways to get rid of the Mark and keep the man he loves from disappearing forever, beyond hope of recovery.
“Yeah, hope you didn’t mean for us to sleep out in the street. I think there’s a decree against that,” Dean drawled.
But unexpectedly, it's not Castiel's phone that rings four hours later, it's Sam's that goes off like an alarm in the early morning quiet.
Next chapter is almost all written, but the bit that's not yet written is fighting me (or it may just be that my concentration is shot nowadays.) I'm still hoping to have it out next weekend, or the weekend after that. Then there'll be only one chapter left!
Cas didn’t react with ridicule or reproach like many of the other chicken hawks would. He just seemed to absorb that information like a sponge. Then he looked up. “Do you like that name, Samandriel?” he asked gravely.
“C’mon, we got stuff to do,” he said abruptly and stomped off, trying to figure out what ‘stuff’ possibly needed doing so urgently in Paradise on a Sunday afternoon now that he’d gone and said that.
Bobby listened to the tumbled-out explanation - Sam! Kidnapped! By the Joker! Wants me to come! With Cas! - and he read the note twice, and then he listened to Cas suggest giving Dean a few supplies so they could leave right away.
Yeah, that would actually make a sort of sense. He was dead. Deceased. Passed away. The proverbial doornail.
“Right, right, tell Eileen- something.” Dean looked too distracted to care, his feet once more treading flagstone.
He hadn’t actually thought as far as the ‘hooking up’ part. Which is strange in hindsight, since Metatron force fed an entire oeuvre of romantic movies and books into his poor cranium. He also knows Dean has had a few trysts with men before, though this is something the angel has been repeatedly told by both Winchesters is Not Discussed Ever (for some reason). But Castiel has a hard time putting together the human puzzle even when he does have all the pieces. In this instance, the strength of his realisation had blindsided him. Only now does he remember that in human books and movies, “I love you,” is usually followed by a lot of talking and misunderstandings before somebody says, “You had me at Hello” and then kissing and intimacy follows.
Dean's taking this just about as well as Rosemary does in the eponymous movie, and for much the same reason, but his attitude will change eventually...
Alfie was embroidering, they all believe that a -a blond woman in a white dress- that she’s Dean’s destined love, but Dean himself knows better and won’t fall for that, he’s no idiot, he won’t be fooled by such a blatant falsehood.
...Where the hell did that power spring from? These demons are meant to be a raiding horde, not an organized force, but that kind of spell is a siege-breaker, a major use of arcana, only deployed with intent. Damn it, Crowley- but if the demons had this much power at their disposal, why didn’t they hit the Hunters with it right off the bat? Was their threat too small to-
“Move on? Just like that? What, you don’t believe in destined souls? Or love at first sight?” Dean asks languidly, watching a couple of crows settle on a branch and look disappointed at the lack of plunderable battlefields close by.
Confusion gave way to understanding. He did know where they were, he’d seen this very spot from his window every day for the past two years, he’d just never been up here before. The old north tower had been barred at the base by king John when he’d built further fortifications with bartizans, making this edifice redundant as a watchtower and too costly to maintain during the war. It hadn’t been used in ages.
“I tend to agree, but who is doing this then? You said weird shit was going on before I even heard of you, think this is more of it?” Dean scratched his head with an air of frustration.
“But…for this to happen...” Sam’s crawling through conclusions like a soldier doing the barbwire challenge in an obstacle course. “You’d have had to… er… with a guy. Without, well, protection, and you never-”
The leash had missed the animal who’d jumped in his direction, heading, in a panic now, towards the open door. Three humans were too much for her, or maybe she felt a killing intent that’d been missing before.
Dean lifts the ox horn every hunter wears and blows his signal - two short calls - followed by a longer one after a pause. Jo and her dog Hooch fade back into the underbrush to listen out for the other teams and lead them in.
“We’re disciplined more than here, I’d say.” Cas’s gaze drifts towards the direction Lydia stomped off in earlier. “But we are very protected.” He says that in a strange way though.
“Cas? You okay?” Dean is looking at him worriedly. There was a time when Castiel had been unreadable to mortals...
One hand slipped and flailed at Cas’s shoulder, the other was on his own erection as the growing pressure touched off every point of his body with flashes of pleasure and lightning and
“Sure do, Dean, there's a couple of them left.” There it was, that eye twitch, looking around to see where Cas was, because he’d always been at calving-rope distance before. She didn’t say anything any more than the others. Dean almost wished she would so he could explain... something. Urgh.
is one of many closed books in his study back in Lawrence’s royal palace.) But the scenery is ringed all around with a wall of thick gnarled trees as twisted and dark as despair, which cuts down a lot on its appeal as a tourist destination. Dean only happened upon the lake by chance; he’s been adventuring in and around the dreaded woods for over a month now, helping out the local populace, battling unforgiving undergrowth, maze-like hawthorne groves and bramble bushes, exploring the forest at large while fighting the vegetation as well as various garden variety monsters. Sammy, for his part, gave up on day two, claiming he preferred inns and towns with nice libraries to camping out in a forest which obviously did not welcome visitors.
Dean’s mind ran scared over his and Jo’s words, looking for anything actionable. Sammy was nearby - actually it sounded like him and the others were clustered right at the door, probably worried stiff.
“You think maybe he’s seeing more than is there,” Dean said quietly, which was a much nicer way than Castiel had ever hoped to put it. “He cares about you. A lot,” he added, as if that was an important point that could excuse many a failing in his books.
Heaven would be Donna baking cakes nobody would taste anymore, other than figments of her own memory. Old Man Pete’s stories and tall tales only told to the children of his imagination. Dean - even if he did Ascend, Dean would be without Sam. Without Bobby and Ellen and Jo. Without his web of connections and family-
Turned out, Dean had learned chivalry, thank you very much, and didn’t feel like macking on some unconscious chick, so he went to find the witch who’d cast the spell to convince her, with the help of a few pointy arguments, to undo it. He came back with a strong alliance signed by the empress´s own hand, but no daughter, and at that point the wiser heads in Lawrence began to suspect there was a problem.
“Yes.” Balthazar heaved a sigh as he stepped away. “Yes, I can. And since I would like you to be able to come back one day, I’ll create a masterpiece of reporting that’s going to make it sound like you really had no other choice but to do as the abductors ordered, rather-”
Feeling numb, Dean followed instructions and sliced around the bullet - more light trickled out, an odd feeling, that this here,
From the horrified look Cas is giving him, he’s not interested in hearing a family anecdote right now.
After that, Dean slows down a little on the death-baiting, as much as he can what while being a hunter and all. No need to hurry, right? His year is almost up.
The pinprick was now a sphere larger than the Machine, so bright it seared afterimages in his eyes even when he glanced away immediately. The air around it was warping. The deer had run away- and still that impression that this thing was not growing, but traveling towards them - even though distance itself disagreed - at a thundering speed, like a meteor. Dean grimaced and turned away. They were running out of time. In fact, they were probably out of it already. Shit.
“Dad... he left too. Even when they were both here, they were kind of gone. It’s... these two strong personalities. Both too strong, too independent, too sure they were right.”
Something changes. The body plastered to his own is now as supple and responsive as a plank of wood. Dean twists against the table’s restraint, the movement pulling the shirt out of Castiel’s grip before it can come off.
Ginny’s head comes up, so do her hackles. Black eyes in snowy white fur fix on the woods. Slowly her upper body sinks, her feet grip snow, and a growl echoes from her large chest.
Dean grins proudly. He seems to take personal pride in making Castiel laugh, a feat since the latter still doesn’t fully understand humor, ten years since his fall (chances are he’ll never fully grasp it at this rate…)
Cas still looks absolutely fine, so Dean gestures at him to stay where he is, out of grab range, and goes to look the guy over in more detail. Drew’s around Dean’s age, solid, well fed but with nothing soft about him. Clothes are rugged, boots well-worn. There’s a scar across the back of his hand, there was another on his chin, and there’s something… tough here, something like the hardiness of a wolf trying to pass itself off as a dog, but maybe that’s just the ‘hormones’ talking. Dean’s riled. Real bad. He knows intellectually that it’s the wolfie inside taking over; Cas is unharmed, only a bit startled at being approached out of the blue, nothing untoward happened, nothing was going to happen what with Ellen and Jo right there- but the foreign beta broke the roadhouse rules for reasons unknown, which makes human Dean suspicious, and disinclined to rein in the wolf inside, snarling in out-and-out hostility. Guy talked to
Dean opens his mouth to say that Cas doesn't need to pick up their mess, but that’s not right. Lydia might be a bitch, but she is a beta, and, well, the supplies do need carrying and the other omegas are busy. There’s courtesy, but then there’s the way a pack works, and it-... well, it’s just the way it works. From the way Cas is heading towards the boxes, calm and collected, he knows this and he doesn’t even mind. If the bitch had just said please, the supplies would be squared away by now.
“Gratitude wasn’t the point,” Sam shot back ironically, but he seemed less hostile than before. “Let’s just try to get through this dinner without anyone getting arrested.”
were okay, went on to their so-called Reward, so screw them. When the dust settled and Lucifer had been destroyed along with a good half of the planet, Mickey-boy was pretty much the only one left standing, though a persistent rumor in the resistance suggested he’d been badly injured in some way, and couldn’t leave Heaven anymore.
The young guard leapt back as if he’d been bitten. “I- I’m sorry, Dame Ellen, we tried, we really did, but word got out.”
“I’m sorry. I know you don’t understand. But I could not stand by, Dean. I saw what they can do. I will not let humans fall prey to one of these creatures again,” Castiel concludes, and he
Uriel had stopped talking, small mercy, but now he had a hand on Sam’s shoulder as he stood behind him and the pain... just... drilled... away...
“As soon as possible,” Cas answered, but there was something in his tone, as if the words were hiding other words behind them.
The being dismissed that concern out of hand. Duty was all, and there were few left to do it. The eyes narrowed (once more, completely uselessly) while his intent spiraled in. In. In.
“I think this is a rather crude test of Dean’s ethics,” Castiel responded, rotating his vessel’s right shoulder and listening absently to a whole lot of organic stuff squelch and pop as it realigned and healed.
Dean tosses back the fifth (sixth, seventh...?) shot and finds the answer at the bottom of the glass. Definitely C, both of the above.
Balthazar cocked his head and looked at him for a short time as if saying, you think about Dean a lot. “No idea. Because John died as a rebel and with a mind trap, his soul didn’t make it upstairs, so he was never officially recognized as deceased. Tell you the truth, the whole episode is wrapped in mystery. Old Yellow Eyes being so tough was already odd. I was more involved in that side of things than you were at the time, and let me tell you, the demony toff was downright eerie. Virgil got him with one of his weapons, and Virgil does not miss, yet Azazel walked away laughing. We couldn’t figure out how to kill the bastard - which was why it was so fortunate Mary clipped his wings by helping take out his small army of demons and Croatoans. Then years later, a couple of Asmodel’s trackers stumbled upon Azazel’s remains, with John Winchester’s body nearby. Seems Azazel stabbed him, but John took him out... somehow. Azazel was gutted
You’d think they’d be more grateful, but life had been so very interesting for everybody these past few months, Dean begrudgingly understood why some people would like their eternity in Paradise to get a little boring again, please and thank you. Still, the way they reacted to his arrival, you'd think he was one of the Plagues of Egypt. The one with the boils and sores.
When Castiel finds a powder-blue pacifier stuck at the very bottom of Sam’s hunting bag full of deadly weapons, he starts seriously worrying about his human friend's mental health.
“Nah, it was definitely none of those things, but good guess, thanks for trying. Sam, get her out of here and figure out what the fuck she’s up to, will ya?”
“Yes,” said Cas, still giving veggies a run for their money in the crisp-’n-chill department. “I can see the quality of this entity’s grace. His deeds echo through the spheres, the orders he’s followed, the people he’s killed. He’s not worth much, I’m afraid.” Thirty feet away, hogtied Castiel’s eyes bulged. “And he wants to kill you very badly. He could hurt you and a lot of humans. You should have ended him.”
“No,” Cas ground out, and then made a noise of sheer pain, a ragged croak as he swayed on his hands and knees.
Gabriel did the dead man’s grin again. “Oh, that’s easy. In terms of power, Michael has the edge on Lucy, but the latter knows that, so he brought big friends with him. The Horsemen, Princes of Hell, Knights, the whole hierarchy. Rafael and I have been ordered to attack those notables where they have gathered, and kill as many of them as we can before they eventually bring us down through sheer numbers. A suicide run, plain and simple, though Mike had the decency not to call it that. So what I am going to do is visit every liquor joint and brothel still standing between here and Armageddon, and then I’m going to go and get myself killed.”
Cas isn’t saying anything. He’s looking down at Dean with a soft expression on his face that suggests he’s quite happy doing nothing more than this until the second coming, and even then he probably won’t look up for more than a minute. Dean grins, rubs his nose, feeling pretty pleased with himself. I mean, sure, love is grand, crucial even, but on a more superficial level you have to feel kinda proud for hooking a guy like this too, even more so for making him come twice, practically sobbing for air and shuddering with pleasure- down boy, jesus, what is he, sixteen again? Dean pillows his head on his arm - the other one is snaked around Cas’s waist - and relaxes fully and contentendly for the first time in months. All that’s put a few questions to rest, hasn’t it.
That was your 5 minutes of 'Mal puts waaaaay too much thought into her hobby' ^^;  Don't worry, next week, the 'Joker' shows up and nothing can stay serious or gloomy around him.
“If you kick his majesty out of the castle, it will just be a big mess, so I'll be happy do it for you instead,” said Sam in a voice like steel caught in ice as he watched his wife’s fingers, yet not at all alarmed by what she was doing. "I have that right, as he's gone and insulted not just one but two people in this castle that I truly appreciate. My wife has a message for you, Michael. She says: Surprise, guess what, the vacant cow can talk.”
“I don’t- I never- I mean, I liked Lisa. A lot.” Dean started moving around the room in agitation, giving Castiel the occasional disbelieving stare. “But I was nineteen and really stupid. It wasn’t love, just an infatuation. I married her, of course I did, I was responsible for what happened to her, pulling her out of her world, thrusting her into this- this thorny bush of politics and stuff… I tried to be a better husband than I’d been a fiancé, but at the end of the day, our connection could only go so deep... What I shared with her, I mean, it wasn’t what I have with you.”
Dean managed not to get gutted in the next second, caught a couple of wicked jabs against his forearms while he stepped back, finding space to maneuver, then he stabbed with the First Blade, aiming to miss. He knew Castiel was gonna fade out of the way, catch his arm, wrench Dean forward to disarm him with a twist of the wrist- instead of fighting the pull, Dean leaned right into it and headbutted the angel hard.
...and he was a vampire. Nominally an enemy, like angels should be... Dean had always known that out on the edge where he operated on the railroad, battles lines were never that clear cut.
“He’s been with Marcus Olson since this morning, Sam’s helping him with a small Penance Uriel was getting sweaty about.” Dean rubbed his forehead. His tiff with Uriel felt like it’d happened days ago.
these things, if only to keep them honest. It is also a good introduction to the similar duties of running a kingdom. Now go get out of your school clothes and into-”
Massive bonfires set the night on fire, illuminating the large gathering space right outside the camp, a stretch of a hundred feet by a hundred between the outer fence and the river. The time of year is not ideal for this, what with the snow and all, but when it’s time, it’s time. The March snow is so tromped on by now, it’s fair to call it nothing more than mud, but Sam, with considerable foresight, emptied a ton of sawdust over the large circle, and people are bringing out woven reed mats and cushions to sit on.
Then Dean looks at him. Really looks at him. Eyes pace over his features. Measure the slump in his shoulders beneath the trenchcoat.
The remark isn’t an objection; Dean meets and matches Castiel’s surge of lust, matches and surpasses, hand gripping his hair, the back of his skull, forcing their lips to meld, the other hand landing on Castiel’s rear and shoving them together, a crude rutting movement born in three savage hip-thrusts.
“Yeah, got it confirmed by this hunter, Kelly Branson. He found the victim in Albuquerque just now, off in the industrial zone near the airport. The demon got sent back to where it belongs right before Kelly got there, but at least the human survived, he’s driving her to the hospital right this minute. Good job, mister Smith, right?” Sam gives Castiel a sunny smile, only slightly marred by exhaustion. It crumbles in stages when Castiel stares stonily back.
He was sitting by a campfire that he’d lit for both warmth and light. It was noon according to his old pocket-watch, but it was as dark as soot. One of the many weird things that had happened in the past two years. So many weird things occurred on a daily basis that one hardly even took much note of them anymore, once categorized as fatal or non-fatal. A man appearing next to Colt out of thin air barely raised an eyebrow from the tired people around them, though a few shuffled away just in case smiting was in the offing.
Dean opens his mouth and finds himself a little stumped at summarizing the two talks he’s had with Cas. I mean, “Electricity and packs” is correct on the surface, but that doesn’t cover the depth of what was said, the interest, the way Cas can turn a phrase and knock down a wall in Dean’s head, like the beta is suddenly at the top of a really tall wind turbine alongside him and seeing much further than he usually does as a result.
“Really? After what she did to Balthazar and the others? After what she did to you?” Remembering the raw pain on Cas’s face these past few days, the only regret Dean would feel if he pulled that trigger was that he couldn’t kill her twice.
Yeah, no point in denying it. Dean had found his soulmate, and was fast and firmly in love with him.
He put the tablets down on the Machine, propped up against the flange he'd gripped earlier in an area where they wouldn’t get in the way of any gearwork, then he turned away. He thought he heard a faint gritty noise as one of the tablets shifted against the other, but he didn’t look back. He covered his eyes with his left arm, enough to block out the light but still see its outward glimmer turning the grass to ash beneath it. He pulled Colt’s cursed six-iron from his belt and walked straight towards where the great big blazing ball of pain and torment stood poised over his husband, and with each long stride forward Dean pulled the trigger, sending one bullet after another thundering straight into Michael.
hasn’t thought to assure the safety of his heir.” Zaccaria’s tone was fastidious. “The only ones to check on Benjamin all morning were those little pests.”
For a second Castiel thinks the attack, whatever it is, must have missed, but the horrified look on Dean’s face bursts his delusion. The attack hit, it just wasn’t aimed at them. Castiel looks over his shoulder at the top of the hill.
“Worse,” Dean admits, curdling inside as he knows this is in a good part his fault, “he’ll be following in our footsteps, which will bring him to the lake first. And if he reacts like others have when faced with a talking swan- Adam is kinda excitable and trigger happy, it comes from all that jousting-”
As it turned out, ‘ahead’ was no more safer than the rear. The echoes of running feet, of snarling, and that weird throaty chuckle the Croats made were bouncing off the surrounding rocks, so both the human and the angel were taken by surprised when they rounded a grey outcropping and found themselves practically nose to nose with two ragged figures, clothes hanging off them, hair long, eyes those of animals, mouths springing open into rapacious grins.
. “Keep your eyes peeled, hunters, remember the way the herds spooked yesterday, it’s always possible-”
But Cas is no longer the omega he was a year ago, nor is he easily mastered even by his own emotions. The half step he lost, he makes up for, surging forward in cold controlled anger, righteous and condemning like an angel of judgment: “Unforgivable! Unforgivable, Luke! You took- you took what we learned together, our research, our history - and you did
Dean snickers, a muffle sound, as the back of his hips bump into the library table. “In a hurry, soldier?” he mouths against the skin of Castiel’s cheek, next to his ear, making the angel shudder - has it gotten abnormally warm in the bunker?
“I am going to make one thing very clear,” he finally said in the kind of voice in which God had dictated commandments one through ten. “Feel free to run ahead and tell your masters. If any harm comes to Sam or Dean, I will lay waste to any and all I find down there, regardless of whether they consider themselves
“I see this primitive owns you after all.” Luke’s still all spite and spittle, fuck it, and Dean’s done putting up with him.
Cas continues telling him about distilling chemistry-related stuff to help make and store electricity as they head towards the meeting spot, but it’s a short distance, the den being right next to the stompin’ ground. That’s what the hunters call the empty circle of beaten dirt at the center of their small compound where most of the social shit goes down. Now it's rapidly filling with folk streaming in from the cabins and the warehouses surrounding it. Dean waits until the flow slows to a trickle before stepping in with Cas at his heels. Benny’s group is out on long patrol, that leaves some forty hunters in the compound, at present forming in a half circle in front of alpha Victor, front ranks taking a knee so back ranks can hear and see properly. Most of them are only half dressed and still damp from horsing around at the stream, but they’re as attentive as soldiers nonetheless. Dean hangs back at the outer edge of the formation, two steps back rather than his usual two steps forward so he can stand with Cas, who lingers on in curiosity.
...but chains sunk into the deepest part of his heart bound him there, staring at the depth of Dean’s revealed feelings, the honest worry without a hint of anger or disappointment or suspicion… This is unworthy of you, sermoned his conscience, but Castiel just couldn't stop.
This is why Sam’s been so tired lately. It’s not the demon chase that’s exhausting him. It’s keeping a watch on Castiel, making sure to follow clues while obfuscating them from the angel.
He doesn’t have to. It’s winter, people don’t wash much in the cold, Dean stinks of sex and of all other sorts of things, and he’s probably radiating that Mated look at a hundred paces.
“I stopped myself, to get rid of the Leviathan overtaking me,” Castiel corrects tonelessly. “Though I failed, as it were.”
“Wait till next Sunday, it’ll be spectacular,” Dean grumbled, shaking his head at a nearby star poking its nose through the gathering dusk.
“Surely you don’t need to know death, famine and disease to abhor them. You’ve known a bit of pain in your life-”
Castiel’s perception - wobbling on the edges from the emotions thundering through him as well as a bit of hemorrhage - finally catches up to events.
One crossroad deal later, Dean has a definite expiry date. Sam is as distraught as only Sam can get, but Dean is secretly… well, almost relieved. He’s saving Sam, and all it cost is a life that doesn’t serve any purpose other than killing and getting killed. Yeah, Dean is finally going to get off the merry-go-round for good, instead of having one foot off and one foot on, hopping along like an idiot. ‘Bout time. Next time Dean Winchester kicks the can, that’s
“Maybe you can kiss it better? They always said you were the most optimistic of the Seraph, Cassie.”
They’re zeroing in on their target, but their failure to rouse the citizenry means that the sorcerer has a town full of human shields a short flight away from the tower, so the brothers cannot afford to draw out this fight, or battle him in the streets; they have to nail him directly in his lair.
But there’s not much left to hang his imagination on. The place is too devastated. The counter and a few skeletons of shelves remain, piles of mildewed and much-chewed fabric that might have been clothes or couches… here and there, specks of colored paper that would be the little remaining of torn off book covers. A pile like party-colored snow peppers one corner where the wall and floor are blackened .Someone in the last fifty years tried to light a fire for warmth using the books as tinder. Yeah, traces of the end of times predominate over the previous more civilized uses of this room. That door over there was broken down with an axe. The setup of shelves in the northern corner don’t look natural; might have been used for a barricade. Above them, between two statues, one knocked down and desecrated, someone daubed CROATOAN on the wall.
“I don’t know about that, but I do know I can’t wait for you to get back on your feet so you can strut your stuff. We got sparring rings here. I’ll take you on myself if you don’t mind.” Dean’s strong features are alight with enthusiasm like an echo of bright soul-light. “I’m mighty eager to get the measure of my latest mysterious recruit. You show up outta nowhere just in time to wheel into action during the battle, you save dozens of men, and by all accounts you fight like a demon. An expression, of course.”
The words were out of his mouth when something deep within him shifted, like a painted screen of some idealized landscape falling away to reveal a window behind it.
try to bring this stuff up, what do I get? Just your best John Winchester impersonation and nothing more! What the hell, Dean? Why can’t you and I talk about this shit too? With me you always go on about how much you lack smarts, but with Castiel, you obviously-”
The angel was on the north side of Dixie, a hundred yards away and getting slowly closer if Dean was any judge. Dousing was more an art than a science, but Dean’s life had depended on it time and again, it certainly sharpened the skillset.
“Do not kill them.” Michael was talking about Panic and Pudding. An angel stood at a standstill over Panic, blade raised, looking back obediently at his boss. “Those two may be involved in summoning this… aberration. They can help us find the reality that spawned it. Once we have finished in this world, we will have a new task, a new plane to cleanse.” The look he gave Dean said the latter was all the affront needed to justify genocide on the reality that’d produced him.
He had barely started to unlace his surcoat when a knock at the door interrupted him. And here he thought he’d sorted out all the issues that could possibly crop up.
Dean jumped out of his skin. Cas was sitting there, blood-free and merely looking puzzled at the way Dean was holding him.
Dean’s grin was unrepentant when he rejoined Castiel. “Your workplace is so much fun, I can’t imagine why you spend all your time stuck at home.”
The bunker rumbles and huffs: air circulates, pipes groan, electricity hums, but it feels so much quieter than it actually is in contrast to the airplane and the car. Like being wrapped in a comforting blanket after a winter’s day outside. Angels cannot feel the cold and they have no need of blankets, but Castiel was human for awhile, and he remembers both sets of sensations, a tactile memory that touches his shoulders with the ghost of past warmth.
“That I do.” The stranger nodded hugely. What Sam thought was a large toothpick in his mouth turned out to be a stick of hard candy.
The alpha sways back a step. Bony face goes white. Blood spatters thick down the knife hilt, into snow. Hands lurch up towards his neck only to fall again. Then his legs buckle.
Having actually met both of those notables in their new bodies, Colt was hard pressed to figure out who to root for. “Can’t you stop them?” he asked without thinking.
“Of course, storing power is just as important as generating it.” Cas’s blue eyes sparkle, he’s the weirdest thing this side of the Appalachians and Dean is quite happy to let him ramble. The repairs appear to be finished since Cas got out of the hole awhile back, but Dean is not gonna say anything. From the dirt covering the omega, he’s been hard at work today already, he deserves a break. Don’t have many people these days who can fix stuff, or even better, make stuff; gotta cosset them a bit. And Dean is loving this conversation. He grew up in Winchester pack, he knows most of the people in it as well as he knows any member of his family. Talking to someone new is always a pleasure, especially when it’s someone who’s got something to say.
him, and Dean loves him in return; they’re family, they work together and fight back to back, they saved the earth together. But at the end of the day, as heart-wrenching as it is, they are two different species, and their motivations don’t always align. It’s inevitable. Some things they just cannot see the same way. This past year of grueling service to the Host has taught Castiel his duty once more, the cruel demands of it, the acceptance of it that only an angel can muster. He will have to do his duty now. And his friends will have to do their muddled human best to do what they think is right. And if this causes them to clash once again, then that is inevitable and not the first time that’s happened, but they will hopefully sort themselves out at the end of it as they have before. But that only applies if - and that takes precedence over everything, really -
Castiel listened until he heard the neighbors’ door shut and a very distant murmur of calm voices begin. It was surprising that Bobby and Dean were at ease enough to let Ellen and Jo leave unattended. Just because the killers had fled as soon as their assassination failed, did not mean they would not come back. Paradise no longer felt as safe as it should for the Seraph.
floated above it all to justify their actions! We were even expected to thank you for it! Hail to the God Machine! Amen!”
“Oh, no, that’s what I had to write down just in case Michael ever found my notes,” says Cas offhandedly as he resumes his scrubbing.
Sam did a great fish-on-a-line impression, glare going from one to the other. Then he threw up his hands. “Fine! Great! Welcome to the family! You fit right in! Hallelujah, hosanna and praise the Machine.” The kitchen door slammed behind him two seconds later.
Castiel smooths down the sleeve over the unblemished skin, then puts his hands on Dean’s shoulders, trying to catch his lover’s gaze. “Dean, whatever you had to do, promise or pay, please, please let me help you.”
“Hm,” was all that Cas said, though still without any hint of judgment. Dean felt surprised, and yet not surprised in that part of his gut which was starting to map out the edges of the strange foreign country that was Castiel. The guy was weird and uptight, but he wasn’t an out and out puppy-kicking asshole. Which was probably not all that surprising if they were actually soulmates after all (this thought set up yet another chorus of “Jumping Jehoshaphat I am bloody
Nothing moves. In the oppressive silence of the magical forest, only a breeze ruffles the ivy and the moss covering the old stones.
- but dammit Cas had better remember he’s one of their main repairmen and science boffins. He’ll be working to pass on that knowledge to others as quickly as possible or Cesar, for one, will empty out his skull and wring his brain into a keg (his exact words, according to Cas.)
Baby doesn’t respond to his sarcasm, though the sudden burst of static breaking up the tinny pop number on the radio sounds a little like a raspberry. Dean stops at a red light and rubs the bridge of his nose.
Castiel sits on the curb and composes himself. It takes a few minutes. The Host’s missions are getting few and far between, but exponentially harder. Initially he had a chance to convince the runaways that they can reintegrate Heaven, that it’s safe, but those few left now are the hardcore elements. They fight him tooth and nail right out of the gate, he doesn’t have a chance to get a word in edgewise. They ambush him in public, they use bystanders as human shields, they hire demons or monsters to help - they have no limits.
...He remembered Dean working hard to smooth the plane. A gleam of pleasure as fingertips lingered on the satiny feel of the wood. His hands on his hips and a faint nod when Sam and Castiel had helped him set it up in their kitchen... Dean tasting Donna’s pies, talking fillings with her. Looking at his brother when he thought nobody was watching, eyes soft.
“And how many others creeping up behind me? Maybe with a gun to my head - or to someone else’s head - forcing me to go up to you and disarm you?”
“I think you may have a lot of anger in there that you couldn’t address when you were an omega, and now its out of its box.”
“Good. Then have a drink of water and a bite to eat first,” Dean orders calmly. “You’ll focus better.”
As an angel, Castiel could see effortlessly into the multi-dimensional; in fact it took rather a bit of concentration at times to remember how humans saw the world. So he could see the Garden, spreading out forever around them, and he could see the nearby edge of the Sphere cutting that ‘forever’ in half, the doorstep to Heaven. He could see the beautiful, unsullied world born from the heart of their Father, and he could also see the small metal dome they were locked into and which someone was currently beating with a large hammer.
Dean stared as if he’d not expected Castiel’s acquiescence. But Castiel knew the numbers, and he knew the number of humans these last two hundred years who had approached the Rit Zien and asked them to end it for them. They died, they Ascended, they went to a better place, so it had to be part of the Plan too, but that part was... a little hard to decode.
Dean aimed and let his shot roll across the turf that ornamented this side of Kiowa junction. “See, like that. You need to get it closer to the jack, the small ball. So, how’d it go with Zach? Have they figured out how the Machine went wrong and got us mixed up?”
“Come in!” Robert Singer’s voice drifted through the open parlor window in answer to Dean’s knock. “Ellen’s busy in the- quiet, woman! The boys are old enough to open a door!”
“Good.” Dean turns on his heels without bothering to see if the men leave as ordered and walks off in the opposite direction with a simple, “Cas, come over here. And keep that cloth on that injury.”
“Jo, you sure he reacted to that name? Crowley?” John finally asks, the first question since he entered the roadhouse, glanced at the body and then at Dean with: Are your people alright, son?
It’s a big surprise when Dean dies the first time around. Well, to clarify, it’s not dying that comes as a shock. He’s a hunter, it’s rather expected he’ll die young and bloody, just… not more than once.
“I really don’t think it’ll matter. My job is not at risk, nobody can order me around. Other than my alphas,” he adds waspishly, then scolds himself with a head shake and a put-upon sigh. “What I need to do is just quickly establish myself into the pack -
Dean examines her profile in surprise. Normally Rowena doesn’t share that much voluntarily. Taking her side against Charlie may have induced the old hag to open up a bit. Wonderful. Now if only she had good news to share, rather than ‘it’s complicated’. He also wishes she would stop mentioning Cain. The notion that the father of murder is walking around intrigues the witch, and she’s insinuated before that she might need to meet him in order to figure out the ‘mystical motion’ of the curse. Dean can’t tell if that’s true, or if she’s got some ulterior motive (possibly related to Crowley getting knifed), or if she’s just fangirling, but since Cain disappeared for all intents and purposes, they’ll have to do without the bearded bastard. That’s got Dean’s ballot. Shit is bad enough without getting Cain involved. Who knows how he’d react to what’s happening here?
“He could have loved Lady Kate too, if she hadn’t died…” Sam’s voice was softer, Castiel could barely make out what he was saying. “Maybe we’d have had another brother.”
She gestures over the red candle, burning, sputtering and dripping big fat globs of pungent wax onto the cat’s skull it’s using as a holder. The candle flame goes out and the pain abates.
“Their intentions may be considered good, their methods are not,” says Castiel, glancing at the bullet-ridden jeep spilled in a nearby ditch. He’d been examining it when Dean’s call came through. The vehicle is near the tree to which three men and one woman have been tied, cuts running up and down their bodies and eyes burned out. One of them was no older than sixteen.
“Let’s cut to the chase, because I’m sure we’d like to get out of each other’s sight. Help get this Mark off and I’ll forget to put a bullet between your eyes, at least until the next time we meet.”
“You don’t believe me, but you should. I can see it so clearly now. In five seconds, you're going to throw down your rifle, put these on and come over here. And you’re going to kneel. Then your friends walk away.”
“We can no longer allow humans to run rampant and procreate without restriction. Karen was blessed with finding her match, her soulmate. They lived for decades in peace and comfort-“
“Seraph, I need to draw my gun now, so don’t drill my back with anythin’ more sharp than that there scowl on your face,” Benny announced without turning around.
Dean had cleaned himself up at the pump, swilling off dirt and sweat before pulling on his shirt and jacket again. He’d looked both startled and a little miffed when he turned around and found Castiel once more pristine in his suit and duster. Castiel had belatedly suggested he do a similar cleanup for his human spouse next time and Dean had given him the same look as when Castiel had offered to restore his stamina, throwing up his hands while backing away and saying not to bother.
“It saved a lot of angels’ lives. And humans too,” Balthazar added before Castiel could remind him who were the ones in charge of protecting who. “As for John Winchester’s biggest ripple effect-... oh, maybe you don’t know.”
“Really? My home? Is Paradise 1 my home any more than here?” said Cas in a voice layered in irony. Dean hadn’t known he had it in him.
“I’m glad your father decided not to give you that right,” Cas said steadily, harking back to other arguments between them. Yeah, it was a-OK in Cas’s books for a dad to take away his children’s freedoms in order to keep them safe.
“I conveniently put myself on patrol around the southwest section of the wall,” Balthazar added. “So you should have a clear run of it. Maybe keep to your usual ploys anyway, just to be safe.”
“Interesting.” That word comes too quick for Dean to dig himself into a hole or out of one. But Andrea doesn’t look all that interested in Cas-the-brand-new-beta right this minute, or how Dean got him hooked three hot seconds after his transition.
“Yup. She’s going places, that kid.” Not really a kid anymore, at that. In Winchester, you're an adult at fifteen, you take your place in a pack, you start climbing the ladder and finding your rank.
“Look, I really don’t give a fucking bent penny,” Dean said, words tight through clenched jaw. “Keep your war stories, both of you. I just want to find my brother.”
He’d probably said some of that out loud. At least the swearing. Because Cas said, “Dean?” in somewhat concerned tones (but otherwise not sounding breathless for a bent penny.)
They picked a new spot on the concrete floor of the warehouse, one that wasn’t too dusty or covered in chunks of angelized debris, and set up a pretty standard summoning pentagram. Panic clasped his hands together and trotted out some Latin. Nothing happened for a few seconds, then a faint shiver appeared in mid-air at the center.
“Samuel, short version, please.” Sam, who’d taken a seat right next to Dean on the bench, rubbed his forehead.
“Yeah, he got all the magic talent in the family, see. Our mom was Queen Mary of Lawrence, kickassiest magician in the entire central lands. She’s passed, alas, but Sammy has picked up the mantle well enough. He’s untangled a few curses in his day, he can have a crack at yours.”
...When Cas had ‘stopped the sun’, Dean had slapped ‘bible shit’ on that and walked away without thinking. This sounded more subtle and more complicated and a lot more
“You got hit in the back. We’ll need, uh...” First aid for angels was not something Dean had ever had to master.
“Yeah! They just vanished! Never seen anything like it!” echoes one of his friends, equally inebriated. The townspeople gathered around them cheer and buy them more beers.
“As far as we’re concerned,” says Roy, looking at his neighbors, Pah-Ne-Me, Mike and Everett, for support, “the position ain’t up for debate. But if it was… then you’d be the last guy in this pack I’d choose, and I think that goes for us all.” Roy and Everett were two of Cole’s recent victims in his upward push for power, Dean recalls. He’s so far beyond Cole’s provocations by now that he doesn’t even bother reflecting on how consequences are a bitch sometimes, or how amusingly affronted Cole looks right now; instead he starts to calculate how much this will impact the make-up of the teams now the Hierarchy’s been given a shakeup, and how he can compensate...
Sam makes a helpless gesture. “Over there. These people showed up during our march this morning, they’re from some northern kingdom. Raspail? Rasepal? Some place we never heard of. There’s around a hundred of them. They said they came to join our alliance. I had them back in the rearguard, but they… they suddenly showed up, and two of them picked up Bo-...” His face twists in sudden pain  “I couldn’t- I couldn't protect him. Dean… it’s bad. It’s real bad. I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault…”
Under his audience's scrutiny - Cas confused, Dean suspicious - Luke shrugs. His weatherbeaten features are still twisted in a mou of disdain. “Those lunatics are useful tools - no, no, I stand corrected, since I’m here and they’re not. They’re not only smelly, undisciplined, primitive, brutal and shortsighted, they’re also pathetic. They-”
”...What?” Zachariah looked from Dean to Castiel as if he expected the Seraph to be miraculously fluent in Dean’s meaning now.
Even picking out the curtains - since that’s what they’re doin’, in essence - is not a chore with Cas involved, it’s a goddamn pleasure, and boy, Dean’s got it bad.
There was a few seconds of silence from an angel who’d just stripped a gear and was trying to recover.
Dean forces his fingers off the guy’s nape. He’s born him all the way down to the ground until the stranger is flat on his stomach. Steering clear of Ellen’s line of fire, Dean gets to his feet and goes to check Cas. The omega isn’t panicking, though he’s tense at the scene unfolding before him.
“Paradise, Heaven or nothing, huh?” Dean said in a very soft voice. “Those really your only choices, Castiel?”
“Cas,” says Dean as he pulls on the sleeve of his hauberk, “you know you’re not supposed to talk to me like that, theoretically.”
for him, leaving him with nothing more than an exhortation to kill Sam if need be. Like Dean really needs to be the last man standing of his entire family. They haven’t yet invented the flavor of survivor’s guilt that would require.
John and Sam absorb this in intense silence. For Dean, that was just one more hiccup on the path to becoming alpha in the past four days, but for the two others in this office, this is big, weighty news. Very big. For Sam, it’s a game changer. Andrea’s ambitions were never a secret. There was always that chance Benny might cave and join her in Ranchers, the two of them becoming serious contenders if something happens to John. Very serious contenders, since Sam is still unmated.
Dean strides through the big house’s front parlor. Like Vic’s house, it looks different today; it’s a large room where an alpha can have mediated meetings with members of other packs, and that means it’s gone from ‘place I walk through to get to dad’s office’ to ‘place I have the authority to use to conduct inter-pack business and shit’. Has it always had this many chairs…? Dean tries to picture himself at the head of the table there, like he’s seen Vic a couple of times, and he can’t really do it. But it’ll come to that sooner or later, now that he’s alpha. Yup, he’s alpha...
“I can’t broadcast sound with just the crank. Just a minute-” Cas is tapping a button near the mike in a strange pattern.
“Why?!” Dean shouted, mind still reeling beneath the various flavors of emotional racking he’d undergone in the past few minutes, apparently for nothing.
“He’s eighteen now. Dad had us go out and kill stuff when we were barely able to reach the saddle. You murdered your first monster at twelve.” Sam sounds slightly sour. Not only has he never agreed with John’s ‘medieval’ methods for dealing with the unnatural, he does not approve of just about anything their dad does, or what he made his very young sons do. John would have brought Adam up the same way, presumably, but Adam’s mom, Lady Kate, didn’t die and leave him alone to be raised by a royal fighting and killing machine like Mary did. No, Kate is alive and well, and she put her foot down. Adam’s had the chance to grow up unscarred, practicing his battle skills in classes with proper instructors, and recently gaining continent-wide renown for his jousting skills. Dean’s never jousted in his life; when he puts a lance through a target, it’s not a well-armored opponent with a safe coronal-tipped spear coming at him, it’s something that will rip his throat out if he misses.
“She’s the only healer we’ve ever met who could have performed such a feat.” A few feet behind the old man, Sam nods vigorously in confirmation with the confidence of one who knows of which he speaks. “And I had a couple of men on fast coursers travel to the nunnery and beyond, her story all holds together.”
“But you’ll need to learn that some words can start a war when you’re king,” Castiel continued relentlessly. “Now you will get ready and you will meet me in the great hall promptly.”
So, it turned out there were worse things than being married to a bloody Seraph in the eyes of Earth and Heaven and the people of P342, and that was to be married to a bloody Seraph who was now conspicuous by his absence.
This is not a good time to poke a Seraph, but Castiel keeps his simmering feelings under wraps while he gives a curt no-progress report, and then listens silently to two solid minutes of Crowley mocking his and Sam’s hunting abilities.
There’s a large thump on the door and someone shouts to open up for him, please. Cas starts like a colt catching a blackfly, he drops his mittens and damn near loses the toolbox too. He picks everything up and hurries over to the door.
They’d sat down at the table as they talked. Dean took Sam’s hand and held out the other to Castiel. So did Sam, who looked puzzled when the angel didn’t take it.
“S’up,” he mutters. He hasn’t opened his eyes, he can tell Castiel’s light tread apart from his brother’s.
“But,” Jo whispers, strangling into a whimper as Alastair turns suddenly and grins at her like he's carving her into briskets in his head.
Dean vaults over the lamb pen’s fence, ducks under a few drying sheets, runs up to the foot of the Rancher’s secondary wind turbine and slams his forearms against the wooden structure of its tower to look up its scaffolding a short ways.
Gabriel had said the tablet managing earth, the mundane sphere, was still in place. Dean dodged and weaved around the Machine, but couldn’t see any other stone slab. Where - where were they supposed to go?!
His opponent cocks his head, which doesn’t hamper that dead-eyed unblinking stare. The wings beat once, twice, a gesture that’s more like a man tapping his chin in thought than any concession to the art of flying. Then: “Oh. Him.”
“Benny! Put that goddamn thing down!” Dean barked. “You guys did not have me haul him out here just to shoot him!”
Luke gives Dean a vaguely triumphant look that suggests Dean’s gone and proven the bastard right in his approach all along.
anymore. Lucifer is dead and gone and good fucking riddance. You know what’s worse than a pecker-head who wants to kill everyone everywhere? A pecker-head who wants to do all that, but still convince you he’s hard done by if you give him half a chance to talk about it.” Samuel horked up and spat on the flagstone floor. It seemed to be a bona fide means of expression in his books. “The only good thing Michael ever did was shove a blade through that asshole.”
The situation had so improved that the royal couple was free to make their first visit abroad without worrying that a revolt would occur the minute they crossed the border. Michael had taken the occasion for a state visit, making this a tripartite meeting of the powers of the region, and Castiel’s cup runneth over, because having to manage the pomp and ceremony of two royal visits on top of having to deal with his brother might just push him past the point of sanity.
The creature leaps about with great agility. Dean, who’d been prepped for dodging fireballs when he walked into the tower, is now thundering over the wreckage he himself caused, trying to nail his target without getting pinned in return. The man - if that’s what he is, and Dean’s not betting on that - is more agile than any normal human, and when he hits, poniard clashing against Dean’s blade, it’s like being kissed by a battering ram, sending the hunter rolling back into a pile of broken suit armor that clanks sadly.
Sam stares at him like he’s gone insane. “Not tell your- er, the guy you’re-... involved with-... I think he’s going to notice, Dean.”
“Enough to bring him in. I didn’t see much, though. Sam Winchester has a well disciplined mind, and he fought me hard to protect his brother.”
Dean gasps and fights back as the darkness lurking around the cobwebbed chandelier takes shape - and grabs him!  He frantically tugs at what’s hauling him off by the shoulder, feels claws - no, talons! He’s gripped by a monstrous bird of prey! It’s hefting him up in the air and towards a window.
“It’s late,” Dean states, getting abruptly to his feet (it’s only 9 pm, but Castiel doesn’t correct him) “I’m going to bed. Alone.”
his father’s plans, he’d been, as Dean had put it, a patsy, he’d been right to question-) But- but surely the blasphemous idea now pervading his mind like a dark stain cannot possibly be correct. No, it can’t be. Dean is where he always is, watching the witch. His lover has kept them apart for months because it was so important to crack the Mark, unwind all its magic, and keep an eye on Rowena. Why would he fail in that last duty now?
“Hey, handsome-” Dean caught himself. Oops, damn, okay, surely the angel would not think that was flirting since Maurice was married and with a kid older than Dean, even if Maurice himself didn’t look it. “Uh, can we grab something to drink? Got any food to go with that?”
“Cas. Hey. Y’re back.” Dean, scratching his stomach through his t-shirt, eyes half closed, heads towards the kitchen.
“I’ve asked Balthazar to go to Ellen Harvelle’s house. He appeared there three seconds ago, he says they’re fine. He’ll stay to insure their security.”
“You’re the only one who’s never asked. To the point you’ll sprint off into the night rather than hear it.”
Dean is quiet for a moment, then without breaking eye contact, he fishes in a small embroidered satchel tied to his large belt and draws out a coin.
“He’s also the Joker you guys all admire so much, and I’m afraid you’re not going to like the next bit.”
In which we are reminded that real life usually requires a few more details than Happily Ever After.
Baby scores the gravel of the driveway and slews more than rolls into her parking space. Dean is out the door before the motor fully shuts down.
“Will do, alpha. Come here, lil’ fella!” Garth gives Clancy a hug and a head-scritch. “You’re way too small to go hunting! Soon you’ll follow your dad and the others!” (Garth couldn’t master an omega’s quiet obedience if his life depended on it, and his pack has learned to work around it. Hell, they like him better that way.)
“We worship Religion in New Eden. I mean we worship God naturally, but we deify Religion itself at the same time, that and the Hierarchy. Religion is what brought us out of the dark ages decades ago, and yes, the preachers are right, I’ll give them that. Secularism and pluralism are luxuries of the past -”
Vic stops the group a stone’s throw from the ice bridge, narrowed eyes sweeping the area. “Dean,” he says softly. “Rear.”
Dean rubs his nose contemplatively. He’s got freckles, Castiel notices, visible in the late afternoon sunshine. “I gotta few spots for this sort of thing. Thirty minutes away from here, in the woods. I’ll release her there.”
, away from their protective compound. Some other beta bastard might have started yelling at them, shoving them, maybe even cut himself a switch from a nearby tree. That would get them moving too, and a whole lot faster. But Dean’s not that kinda guy, and he knows the omegas will work better if they get there at their own pace, feeling safe and protected. So he talks calmly and ignores the small cloud of impatient steam rising off nearby Jo. Fortunately she knows who’s boss, she won’t derail Dean’s slow progress.
Dean’s almost distracted by this furtive glimpse into the creative process, but then he re-focuses on practicality. They only have today to make a whole lotta decisions. Dean’s on a hunt rotation starting tomorrow and he doesn’t want to leave Cas with more of the work than necessary.
This gives Dean access to the tall rounded windows. Nothing ominous stirring in the early afternoon outside, warm and inviting in contrast to the stark architecture and the damp cold of the room-
Dean nods. Relief washes through him, sweeping away in a flash flood the tiredness and the worry. Must be someone else mixed up in all this, some stray beta who came into camp in the last year. Not Cas after all.
Dean batted away Gabriel’s arm, ignoring the archangel’s attempt to get him to step back. “You think?! Hell, I’m mad!” He was, too. Furious. Damn it, he liked Balthazar, who was Cas’s brother in a way that actually counted. The last time he’d seen the angel kept playing through his mind, the light extinguishing, that apathetic dullness taking over again- hell, maybe he couldn’t snap a table in two, but he could damn well kick a leg and wish it was Naomi’s shins!
“Just have to choke down your dignity,” Efram says unpleasantly under his breath from where he stands five meters away, looking down at the wreckage with his angel blade still in his hand.
Castiel, a hammer stopped mid-swing, stares down at him, and then he smiles, oh glory, such a smile. “That’s correct, Dean.”
Rowena scowls, a raw expression that’s a far cry from her usual theatrical ones. “I regret telling you about that binding spell. That is-… It is not something I would wish to do to anyone, and certainly not to our little Robert. I have personal experience with it, and it is-”
Seems the only thing Dean can say these days that does offend Cas is when Dean tries to apologize yet again. The way Dean sees it, he’s due to apologize until the third millenia rolls around for all the screw ups and the lack of trust around Robbie’s birth. And then Cas explains once again that he understands why Dean couldn’t trust him, what with his past mistakes. Dean counters with 'bullshit'; Cas has changed so much since he came to earth, Dean
He’s alone in the stables with the dogs, a few horses and an old mule, John already went back to the house. Dean doesn’t think he’d have done any differently if John was still watching, he’d have just been ready to hear a lecture on survival and shit.
“The largest change may not be intentional, and has to do with development of sex organs in the womb. Spe-cifically, the human race’s new-found- and then there’s that word.”
The man gave him an unimpressed look. “Hold your horses, Dean. We’ll get you there, but it’ll take longer than five minutes. More like a few hours.”
Chuck raised an eyebrow in an exquisite imitation of a human gesture. “Wow, you guys are all romance.”
There’s a small silence during which a human would say, “What’s wrong?!” or “Where are you?!” or the stupidly redundant, “You sound terrible, are you okay?!”
“Dude, we- it- have you seen us? We’re both pretty healthy guys. My ass has been hanging off the edge ever since we shacked up!”
that we’re split between - between obedient drones, hyper aggressive bullies - sorry, not you, but most betas- and - and then of course overbearing leaders who are the only ones who can have children and thus perpetuate the whole system, the only ones allowed to give orders-...” Cas stops talking like he just bit down on a nail and is now chewing on the broken teeth.
Speaking tonelessly never impressed the good dame. “Do you know how much this fête is going to cost us if we light the rooms with pure beeswax candles
Not for the first time in the past few months, Castiel wonders if he should say something. Could he drop a hint? Or… should he lie a bit? A little white lie that would hide his use of grace? He’s never done that before, he’s not sure he’ll be any good at it. But, says an internal voice, you can still say, ‘Dean, since you still haven’t forgotten about it a year later, I should let you know, I was the one who saved your life - and it wasn’t a damn lily or a cross, you just saw the reflection of light off my blade as your healed eyes came into focus.’ Just to set the record straight.
“Say...” Sam had turned back to the window again, but he tilted his head towards Castiel. “You are aware Bobby and Ellen are living together, right?”
“Hi Robbie!” chirps Charlie, leaning down and waving at the tiny face (she’s ignored like it’s going out of style.)
Dean whistled loudly. Castiel hadn’t thought his barely adequate throw had warranted that kind of reaction. Reining in his inherent strength was making this harder than originally estimated.
“I’ll give you pointers,” Jonah says condescendingly. Efram smirks, cold and hard, an expression that does not touch his eyes or echo in his grace.
“Oh really,” says Andrea, gaze going from Dean to Benny and back again with the focused attention of a wolf watching a deer herd, waiting to see which one will totter and weaken first.
Uriel’s jaw dropped as he stared for a split second. Balthazar, with considerable foresight, threw himself at the Protector, but not before the infuriated angel conjured a blast of force straight at Dean.
Fic should be in the 15 chapters range and is already 90% written. Should be updated every Saturday bar real life happening. Comments, kudos, questions and cookies are all very, very welcome, because the 10% is kicking my ass until I feel like Dean's beer bottle there...
Dean mirrors his pose. “Then me coming by the next day to board up your basement already counts as a date, Cas. That’s why I say our first year anniversary is the day we let mama out and watched her scamper off.”
Needless to say, Dean’s winter is a miserable one until shortly after new years, when a bombshell of scurrilous gossip explodes across camp.
To have called him, she must be on earth too. The thought drifts through his mind. But then he focuses.
Belatedly Dean craned his neck to check through the kitchen window into the parlor, made sure his brother was still sitting at his desk, poring over his legal stuff and sipping his tea. This brought Cas and the latter’s suddenly closed-off expression into his line of sight.
Cas tilted his head to one side - Dean actually shuddered under the sudden onslaught of many emotions - and looked puzzled. “I don’t know what you mean.”
To the court’s surprise, rumors were that Sam was madly in love with her. The third floor chambermaid and the second butler had both assured Castiel that she was a witch, her deafness a curse from God for bespelling the poor king. Castiel had put them in their place, angry that they could malign this woman they’d never met and who was in a similar position to his own in a foreign land. For his part, he rather hoped Sam did love her and that she loved him. Not all noble marriages could be rife with heartbreak after all.
“Oh, come on,” Crowley crowed. “Since I’ve started sub-letting the place, I’ve improved the comfort ten-fold.”
wouldn’t tell you!” Bobby affirms it don’t look too serious, but what he cannot do is guarantee that Cas won’t die, because he doesn’t know what the problem is and neither does the doctor or Cas himself, even though the latter has a whole medical library in his brain. Dean learns all this from Adam who, still worried that Dean’s not his usual self, doesn’t take too much persuasion to become Dean’s informant. But all he can tell Dean in final is that it’s not the usual winter cold. Whatever Cas has got, it requires Bobby to brew him turmeric tea with a few drops of ghost plant tincture, so Cas must be both in pain and have a fever.
“One way to find out!” Henrietta declared, picking it up and fishing out some bullets and powder charges from her bandoleer. She ignored her brother’s legitimate objections to firing a gun built by a drunkard.
“No, the spheres were intact during the Apocalypse, by the mercy of our Father, otherwise we would have had to fight a war on two fronts: all the demons of hell and the Leviathans as well. Many demons escaped during the Apocalypse, but not the entirety of the Pit. No, this current situation is not part of the Plan. It happened on the last day of the Apocalypse, the day Lucifer fell. He somehow shattered the spheres. We believe it was a last attempt to get his entire army to earth to join the battle at his side and turn the tide. It was too late for him, but the damage was done. The barrier between the spheres has been destroyed. Non-mortal beings can freely move about. Fortunately the Leviathan and Eve's faction were too busy infighting to invade out of Purgatory right away, but the massive force Azazel led out of the Pit after the Adversary’s defeat taxed us enough on its own that we-”
“Dean,” Sam chides in his patented nanny voice as he bandages up his brother’s palm. What’s he bitching about? It’s not like Dean got chewed on by a werewolf or a skinwalker; this lil’ booboo will heal in no time. It wouldn’t have healed if it’d connected with Dean’s carotid, where the ghoul was initially aiming, but luckily the bastard’s foot slipped on an old well-gnawed tibia, and so he chomped down on Dean’s raised hand instead of his throat. And for a hunter like Sam, breaking down the door to an abandoned crypt and finding his bleeding brother wrestling with a copy of himself isn’t cause for panic, it’s a Tuesday. They know how to sort that shit out and apply first aid afterwards, no big deal.
Another corkscrew stairway, normal in size this time, snaked up from the landing. The place was dusty and felt unused. Eileen was half a turn up, waiting for him, but she ignored his frantic gestures to come back and walked up the stairs instead. There was a lot of debris strewn about, old bricks, wreaths of cobwebs so thick they were almost solid, and a lot of bits of old tapestries that had been nibbled away and carried here to make nests for an entire kingdom of mice. Castiel coughed, covering his mouth and nose with his hanging sleeve, and promised himself to come back here with a cat. Eileen had slowed down up ahead so he could see where he put his feet by her candlelight. If he lunged he could catch her trailing skirt, but he risked plunging them both down the stairs if he did so. And she just wasn’t stopping. Helpless, he followed until a second landing. An old oak door opened with a thunderous creak of its rusted hinges just as Castiel reached the queen, she slipped outside before he could quite catch her. Stepping out into the cold night air, Eileen made a wide enthusiastic gesture as if she was handing him the whole castle around them on a platter.
“Castiel.” Sam turned fully away from the window to face him. “Did Bobby threaten to kill you, yes or no?”
The note written in a childish hand saying ‘yur mean! eat shit!’ had been taken to the schoolroom and analyzed in regards to its lack of grammar and penmanship in front of the others. Castiel had also invaded the schoolroom when one of his ledgers had gone missing. A giggling gaggle of schoolchildren denied their involvement in the petty theft, so Castiel loudly declared that the maid must be at fault and would be punished. Arrested. Convicted. Sent to the dungeon to subsist on bread and water - if she were lucky. Castiel hadn’t even gotten as far as considering the use of stocks out loud before a furious and shamed prince Ben stepped forward and confessed, returning the book. Castiel had found it very promising that the young boy would not let a false accusation stand even to protect himself, he really was his father’s son.
, but Cas isn’t at full power either without his wings, and Dean, for one, doesn’t want to bet his lover’s life on the outcome of that cage match.
Nobody is answering his calls anymore, not Dean, not Sam, not Charlie, not even Crowley (but after being passed around five different demonic receptionists each claiming to be Crowley’s unique personal assistant, he finally learned that the King of Hell is in Bermuda, and unreachable at present.) He only receives the occasional reassuring text message from Dean, but that is not enough. Castiel heads back to the bunker with his mind set on finding strands of Dean’s hair, four black candles, rosemary, seer stones, sulfur and whatever else is needed for the location spell he happened upon while examining (and then burning) the cultists’ occult library. The bunker is well provisioned with all kinds of mystical materials, he should find what he needs for the spell there.
said something, and I remember it quite clearly. One word, lady, repeated twice, and clearly heard too because my savior shushed me with a hand to my mouth to bid me save my strength. Can you tell me what I said?”
“I just found out the head of the resistance is a celestial prick of the same kind that I’m usually fighting, and that I’m archangel chow myself. Trust me, I’m flat on my ass too.”
“Never mind, we’ve been talking too long already as far as I’m concerned, and I’m sure birdie here agrees.” The bound and gagged angel at his feet growled a counterpoint while trying to discreetly wiggle out of the cuffs. “So, you guys - I’m talking humanity in general - are up shit creek with a lollipop paddle, fine. Why am I here?”
The demon looks ever so surprised when the blade nestles into its chest. They’re arrogant, these misshapen beings born of Lucifer, they’re always flaunting their strengths until an ex-angel plugs them full of holes, and then suddenly oh, dear, how dramatic…
Ginny, who’s been looking from one to the other and back again, suddenly rears up, slamming Cas into the boards to lick at his neck. Cas lets out a whoof of surprise, dropping his hammer to squirm around and elbow the dog who enthusiastically continues to explore his arm pit with her nose.
Charlie looked like a red-headed waif, but she was an experienced operator and a tough customer beneath that sparkly smile and heaps of nervous caution. She was also one of the best magic casters Dean had ever met; she’d have been hacking the raw material of reality apart and rebuilding it while she was still sailing through the air, banishing her traces, her image and her very existence from the angels’ perceptions. Then all she’d needed was a distraction to vanish completely, a feat only Ash might be able to replicate in Dean’s entourage. Happily a couple of civilians interfered and gave her an opening, was what she said when she made it to the basement beneath the Roadhouse, cut and bleeding but still on her feet.
Ginny is as dumb as a bag of hammers, truth be told, and took twice as much effort to train from day one, but Dean applied himself, and once Ginny learns something, that thing is
It’s probably stupid, but Dean keeps looking after the bitch for another month until it’s time to choose under John’s stern gaze and Kate’s encouraging one.
Castiel lets his angel blade slip from his fingers. It feels… too heavy. And maybe if he’s not threatening, he’ll survive a few more seconds and have the chance to plant a precious seed of doubt in Dean’s mind. “Dean-”
He watched in awe as Cas threw back his head, lost that insane focus of his, lost everything for a moment melting into rapture… The body beneath his bucked and pulsed, Dean could feel it in every inch of skin that connected them, against his muscles and deep inside, deep, deep, a warm rush inside.
The dancing flames of the candles led him down the stairs to the broken spring door, and then to the narrow corkscrew, which was harder to descend safely than it was to ascend… Down and then further down, past their original route. Castiel frowned and caught up with her when the stairs evened out into a narrow corridor; this time she wasn’t trying to outpace him. Eileen watched him point upwards, then shook her head and gestured on. He followed her slowly. Come to think of it, last night’s hidden panel in the sideroom was the only exit that way. If he came out there, he’d have to walk through half the consort wing to get back to his room, and the place would be bustling at this time of the mid-morning. The passage in his garderobe must be accessible through another path. Sweet lord’s grace, he had a secret passageway into his garderobe twenty steps away from his bed. It was fortunate no assassin had known of this. First thing tomorrow, Castiel was calling for a stonemason...
Dean’s step faltered as he glanced around at the darkening landscape, then up. “Whoa, lotta clouds.”
Eventually the raiders were all exterminated. More and more packs joined the Concordat, settling the midwest. Life in Winchester pack got a little less hungry, a little easier, and the pack seemingly unthawed from one spring to the next. John met Kate, a stray from another camp that’d suffered too many losses and was shedding its betas to compensate. She was no Mary Campbell - then again, who is? - but she was a good woman, and maybe John could not do it alone any longer, or simply did not wish to.
endurance here? His mighty angel was still hard as an oak within him, while Dean had just turned to boneless soup ready to trickle off Cas’s lap - or he would have, but Cas had leaned back another inch or two, holding an impossible angle that would make a human’s stomach muscles tie themselves into knots, if his spine didn’t do so first, all so he could cradle Dean, hold him safe and keep the sweat-bedraggled limp rag of a human husband from sliding off onto the floor. Dean lifted his head and focused his eyes…
Mary Campbell. She is still a legend to this day. She was no stray, no sir, she was deputy hunter of the Okxa pack, up in what used to be Iowa, almost three weeks travel away from Winchester. Times were hard back then; raids from the old Chicago area were frequent, leaving death and hunger in their wake, and disease soon followed to make up the quota of Horsemen. The Concordat set up a punitive expedition composed of the best hunters from five different packs led by the two toughest betas they had, and you can guess what happened next. But it’s not exactly a ‘they lived happily ever after’ kind of story. There’s few enough of those around these days.
Samuel stoppered up his earthenware bottle. “Because humanity is on the brink and we need to take chances. Or because I knew your daddy and he was a good man, and the alternative to bringing you and the angel here was to kill you both, so I wanted to make sure you got brought. It's one or t'other o' those two, take your pick. Good enough?”
There’s a small sound on the line, as if Dean has licked his lips. “Ah, yeah, ‘bout that. We’re still working on the Mark. And Rowena says that at this juncture, it’s important that she not be disturbed.”
The coffeemaker is burping. The smell of warming bread wafts from the toaster. Dean has nudged the coffee pot aside so the dark liquid runs directly into his mug. He’s propped himself up, hip against the counter, shoulder and head leaning on the upper cabinet, and his eyes are closed. Dean is not a morning person.
There’s a lot of hard moments. The little tyrant has four adults on rolling shifts around him and abuses that. Charlie’s fast asleep at 4pm because of a tough one last night.
Even an angel didn’t stand a chance of coming out of that unscathed. Cas went down like a bag of flour hitting the floor, the vessel out like a light, the higher being equally stunned.
It only takes five minutes for Castiel to grab the apples and a change of clothes, and now he’s riding in the van’s passenger seat as Dean leaves Riverview and puts his blinker on to indicate a left turn.
Bobby was a hunter once upon a time, but joined the Makers to be with Karen, back before Dean was born. They rose to alpha and held the position for three years, but… Dean doesn’t even like to think about it, as if his thoughts on the matter might be too loud and hurt the old man.
What will Sam say? He wants Dean to be his partner alpha. What will Benny and Vic say? Where will Dean even go? He’s not falling of course he’s not- but if he is, no way he’d be able to stay with the Hunters, not with- with Lydia and Cole and Tyler and all of them- ohgodohgodohgod- ordering him around like they do Garth and- nononono-
“...Right this moment I can’t remember, because every carefully researched fact I ever had has vanished and all my brain can do is picture you naked right now,” Cas says, and whoo, that’s quite the predator gaze he’s got going there.
Cas breathed in sharp, and his hands held Dean still, then slowly pressed him down again. Dean crooked an eyebrow down at his husband. Had he seen a- a weird flash of brighter blue deep in those so-blue eyes? The hands on his back relaxed, just a breadth - and then pressed him again. Cas’s eyes widened.
Rowena looks up from the tiny footie PJs she’s smoothing out. “It is still dormant. At this juncture that is all I can say. I have not been keen to disturb the wee bairn with any magic.”
Years of training against John, against Victor and Sam and Benny - a legacy of blows, parries and thrusts woven into his very fiber. Dean lets muscle reflex take over. His body and all its experience and scars and training are a piece he can use, one of many, the castle in a chess game he plays with Cas at their table in the evening. The clarity of it - it slows time, it makes things achingly sharp and clear. Still frightening but Dean’s riding that terror now, he’s going to use it like one more pawn.
“She was telling her friend about him earlier, and that she would either be going home with him or with the best looking consolation prize in the place,” says the angel who could overhear and keep track of every conversation in the bar.
Jesus I hope I’m ready for this, Dean mutters inside. The gravitas of his father’s office seems to look down upon him judgmentally, he feels ridiculously young all of a sudden… He wishes Cas was here. Cas always makes him feel like he’s got his shit together.
Dean didn’t answer. He was sitting on the log, the match illuminating the note. Castiel thought there’d been enough of the fading light of day to read it. “Dean? Do you need assistance?”
It’s no wonder no one tries to stop him from leaving. Theoretically the garrison is supposed to hunt down fallen angels, but they understand that Castiel is not the type to create an army of demons or anything dramatic. So everyone is just going to pretend he’s gone for a long walk to cool his head until his Grace runs out in a few hundred years, and he either crawls back to Heaven to recharge (nobody believes this will actually happen because Mount Castiel is also very stubborn) or he turns mortal and dies, and they’ll never talk about him again.
...Explanations were going to be skull-fuckingly complicated as well as boring, Dean was sure of it. Good thing he’d decided to bypass them in favor of torture time.
Only a gargle emerged from Michael’s open mouth, but then he caught himself and spun around. “Dean!”
Chuck had been examining the circadian rhythm of the humans; Castiel could have done the same for one Paradise, with a lot of concentration. The Machine was doing it for every Saved Soul now and for the past two hundred years simultaneously. He glanced over His shoulder at Dean. “Hmm? Can’t do what? Turn off the Machine? Why not?”
“Yeah.” Then Dean did a double take as what Cas said sunk in and matched up with fairy tales from The World Before. “You mean, it wasn’t always like that?”
“It’s okay, it was an emergency,” says Dean with an easy grin that is one of the most beautiful things Castiel has seen in awhile.
Dean finds Sam in the most boring place in town. He first stopped by the mage school, thinking his brother was brushing up on his spellwork. The maesters there had seen Sam, worked with him for a week, with the scorch marks on their walls to prove it, but then he’d moved on to the capital’s small library and university. There, a reeling librarian - who’d seen most of his precious volumes dismissed with ‘read that already, read that too, good god, man, you have this piece of crap? I wouldn't use this for kindling’ - pointed Dean in the direction of the local fiefdom’s record rooms in an offshoot of the palace.
