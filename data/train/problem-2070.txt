"I've hardly seen you fully dressed over the last few days," John reminded him.  The Sheet Incident hadn't cured Sherlock of meandering about, only technically decent, when he felt like it.  Good lord, what kind of father would he even
"No, why me, what did I do?"  John felt helpless, sure he'd given some offense but utterly unaware of what it could have been.
“It’s alright, Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock has the egg.”   He touched his hand to her forehead again.  Even in the few seconds that she’d been away from it, she seemed to be improving.
“He texted me while you were changing.  He knew I’d been out all night, saw the footage of me slipping and falling into the Thames.”
“Or the fear of a foetal loss, I'm sure,” Sherlock said, seeming to read his mind. “We can at least be reassured on that front.”
Such a cold, clinical word, but it sent a jolt of heat straight to John's cock.  "When, ah, when should that be?"  His mouth had gone dry, making speech difficult.
“And Egzanthe?”
"The singer?"  John ran his hand down the back of the egg, wishing he could feel movement, or the bumps of spine and elbow and knees.  "I thought babies did best with Mozart."
"We will have a baby," Sherlock said.
“Too wise, John,” Sherlock said, kissing him again before letting him go.  “But yes, that too.”
That was, oddly, comforting, but John pressed on.  "We should make sure that our stories are the same, at least."
“You do realize that list was essentially what a baby needs you to cater to?”
Sherlock texted back.  John growled through clenched teeth, but left anyway.  He’d been pushing his luck, taking shifts that he didn’t even strictly need just to get out of the house.  He held the egg when he got home from work and in the evenings, but it was easier to hold the egg while sleeping, and then he and Sherlock often held it between them.  Work was a way to get out of the house when Sherlock was in a strop, which, considering the fact that he felt tied to the house, was all the time, of late.
Sherlock's movements seemed uncoordinated, his hand fumbling as John continued to yank up on Sherlock's hips with every thrust.  It didn't matter, though, the coiling pressure and heat that had been building inside him finally reached a tipping point.  He tried to hold himself still as his cock pulsated, hot shocks of pleasure rocketing through him, arching his back, Sherlock held all the more tightly to him as he tried to stand.  Sherlock came then, too, rippling waves of heat squeezing John's over sensitive cock, and he heard himself grunt as he came, feet pressing hard into the mattress as he leaned back, lifting Sherlock off the bed, held tight into the curve of his pelvis, the entire world seeming to shake and crash as he spent inside him one last time.
“Absolutely.  Your mind is already halfway home anyway, I can tell.”  She took the folder from him and waved him off as she walked down the corridor.
"I'm going, I'm going," John groused.  He would have to walk fast to get to the surgery, and he'd be sweaty when he got there, between the nerves and the exertion.
"  It was all going so closely to Sherlock's predictions, her blind faith in the fact that he was telling the truth, her desire to make sure he had
“The eye rolling?  Yes. She can’t really control her eye muscles yet.”  John felt a swell of relief as she sighed, inflating her tiny chest and pressing her spine against his hand.  She was a small but healthy baby, by all appearances, but her unusual entrance into the world had him watching her like a hawk.
“Is he sick?  Are you sick?”  Her eyebrows were drawing together, real worry creasing her features.
“Or Mycroft,” John insisted, reminding him of his options.
Sherlock had to force his head back into the cushion to look at John.  "I've known for a while."
John sighed, letting his forehead touch the surface of the desk.  The phone chirped again.
The feeling that washed over John felt surprisingly like heartbreak, a sudden jolt of sharp pain to his chest. A wave of overwhelming love and warmth seemed to wrap around him, Sherlock, and Egzanthe, all receding as the pain left.  It stood to reason that if his love for his child would make his heart grow it might be by cracking open and healing over, and he felt it as a new tenderness, a new vulnerable spot that he would carry for her forever. He turned his hand palm up to squeeze Sherlock’s hand, just for a moment, needed to turn it back to keep a firm hold on Egzanthe.
“I could,” John said.  The thought had never filled him with any particular distress.
He kissed his way up Sherlock's exposed neck, nipped at his jaw, then claimed his mouth, desperate to be as much inside him as possible, tongue tracing the smooth backs of his teeth as his cock slid in and out in ever lengthening strokes.  It was bliss, heaven, a slow sweet build that he could have ridden forever, until Sherlock spoke.
"Then I would remove you from 221B and you would not have any contact with Sherlock in the future."
"Like him, how?"  John had assumed that Sherlock had a heretofore unknown case of IBS, or an acute case of food poisoning, not some genetic issue.
Sherlock finished his tea. “Do you think you can sleep for a bit more?”
“Really?”
“Sherlock’s taken to texting me in French.”
John kept rubbing Sherlock's hip, wondering if it was hurting him to lie on his side for so long.  "How could I not have noticed?"
John looked out over the flat.  “We’ll have to sort this place out before she’s crawling.”
John didn't have time to point out that it wasn't an answer, as Anthea was pulling up to the curb.
"I need to go home.  And we need to stop at a shop."
Sherlock sighed, his head in his hands.  “That’s what I do,” he said, his voice strained.  “That’s who I am.  I might as well ask you to stop being a doctor.”
“That,” Sherlock said, looking at the mobile.  “Do you know what it is?”
Sherlock kept his hand over John’s, but didn’t look at him.  “Why?  Because the egg will require so much less attention and care when it’s actually a child?”
John walked home, pausing by the Sainsbury’s.  Sherlock had an endless supply of water and a nearly endless supply of food, but he was impatient, and easily bored.  John wouldn't put it past him to become dehydrated just because he was bored with water.  He darted inside and quickly chose two litres of water that claimed to be flavored with essence of cucumber and white grape, respectively, and a litre of blood orange lemonade.  The phone was mercifully silent the entire way home.
John found her by the sink, just out of sight of the rest of the party at the table.
As they entered the living room Zilpha stood up, offering a hand to Sigurson as he unfolded himself, and they stepped aside.  Sherlock scooped the egg up in its nest of blankets and sat on the sofa, John leaning against his side as they both stared down at it.  Peripherally John was aware that someone made tea, and more toast, that people were sitting around them and talking in soft friendly tones, but it all faded to a noise like ocean waves as Sherlock’s steady breath and the curved egg shell were all he had attention for.
"Did you accept?"
"He stayed in Norway and Mummy and Mycroft and I moved back to London."
"Yeah, I am.  Did you have somewhere in mind?"  He could have kicked himself, but in the stress of not knowing quite how to tell her, he hadn't even thought that far ahead.
“You're right,” John said, “and I would have been tempted to ask had I known there was a way to guess.”
“Oh?  What would that be?” Sherlock accepted the bottle from Mycroft as John sat down next to him on the edge of the bed.
“Not tired yet, you know that.”  He swallowed the last of his tea and stood, rubbing the towel over his head briskly.   “Are you ready to go?”
"You could sit up, you know."
“Our first date,” John said, realizing it.
“How is everyone in Strynn?” Sherlock asked.
The web of cracks became clearer as they were forced open from the inside, a new line forming from the crown of the egg downward to join the first, a shard that seemed to wiggle at the tip like a loose tooth, but kept settling back down.  John took a deep breath, the tears finally stopping as suddenly as they’d started.
John looked down at his phone, as if willing Sherlock to intrude on the madness that was the inside of the car.  Within the space of four breaths, he did.
“Everything alright?”
In the case was the warming pad as she had promised, and a soft flat pad for the baby to lie on in a bigger bed with raised firm sides.
“It’s new to me.  What did you think of my mother?”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. “Your experiments with Esperanto not withstanding, I'm sure.”
Anborg wrapped a thin band around the egg, snugging it down to the widest point. “Already bulging,” she said.  “The outer shell is just starting to thin.  Six weeks at most, now.”  She smiled at John.  “You might want to start dropping hints that you’ll be on leave soon.”
"Did he bring the new bed?"
"I hope so.  I have been eating constantly.  Mummy also sent me some suggestions, but the hunger was nearly insatiable.  I've consumed a great deal of meat."
“That would be lovely, thank you,” Anborg said as she unpacked some of the other more prosaic baby things. “With milk, if you have it.”
"Right, of course."  He tore his clothes off, barely aware of where they landed, hissing a bit when he dragged the cotton of his pants over the exposed head of his cock.
"So nice to see you again John," Mycroft said.
The fireworks started, the noise a tinny chaos through the phone speaker.  John muted it, then glanced at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s mouth quirked in a small smile.  “We don’t know that her hair will stay golden.”
“You must let me get you a boppy pillow,” Sarah said.
“What happened to your clothes?”
John was distracted from the lovely sight by a sudden realization. "Books.  Oh my god, Sherlock, we need to get books.  And proper clothes.  And soft toys."  He put his hand to his forehead.  "There are so many things we haven't thought of!"
"I am attempting to find a reliable source of human milk for the baby, but in the UK donated milk is set aside for premature infants."
"It's alright, John, it only happens now.  Only every seven years."  Sherlock's voice seemed almost scared, and John pinged to why immediately-- scared of being thought a freak, now, after everything else John knew about him.
John let the phone sit heavy in his hand.
"To whom?"  Sherlock did open his eyes, the usually piercing blue gray somehow softer after sleep.
“Remember, John, he is like me, but he is not me. I am my father's son, but I had the tempering softness of my mother as well.”
"Mummy had two children, Sherlock and I, but she had conceived shortly after she and Father were married.  This pregnancy, and her next, sadly ended in miscarriage, and she made the bold decision to cease attempting conception through the usual placental means.  In her hometown, in Norway, her decision would have been seen as the norm, not the exception, but there is a greater community there of people like her.  Here, in England, it was bizarre in the extreme for her to embrace this aspect of herself, but Father approved."
“We knew,” Sherlock said, bending to kiss the top of her downy head.
John grasped the door jamb, overcome suddenly.  Mycroft anticipating their need for a bottle was the very least of all that he’d done, along with Sherlock’s parents, and then there was the support they’d already had from the “cousins” he’d only heard about. The egg was hatched and Egzanthe was here, a real living child, but Mycroft and the rest of Sherlock’s family weren’t going to disappear now that this bit of drama was over. He looked up at Mycroft’s perpetually placid face, his impeccable suit, and was hit by the realization that Mycroft must have endured incredible suffering keeping Sherlock’s whereabouts a secret for the years that he was gone. Without that sacrifice from this man that John had always found intimidating he wouldn’t have Sherlock, or Egzanthe, or the rest of his life as he knew it, for however many years that might yet be. Mycroft, who had held the egg with such tenderness, who had helped engineer John’s acceptance of the entire idea of Sherlock bearing an egg, who had supported them from the very first,
"Technically, yes, but the truth is that hatched children do well on either babymilk or real milk, and it's at a high enough demand here that I would not want to deny a truly premature infant of what it needed."
John waited the three hours that  Sherlock had estimated, then sat on the edge of the bed, choosing his spot carefully to avoid being tipped onto the floor.  With the blanket over him, he looked merely like he was sleeping, curled up, but the egg had become a reality in John's mind and he didn't doubt it.
"To Lestrade.  My work.  Mrs. Hudson."
He watched as she processed that, counting back the months, surely.  "Since just after he came back?" she asked.
"So, lunch tomorrow with Sarah," Sherlock said.
Sherlock and John debrief after supper and discover that incubating the egg isn't a barrier to intimacy.  (Can't really be tagged "pregnant sex" because it's an egg, but the idea is the same).
John turned the page of his paper, barely aware of Sherlock across the table from him reading his own section of the paper.  He seemed to be flipping through the pages quickly, more quickly than usual, and he'd been restive all morning to boot, but it wasn't until he slammed his hands down on the table that John paid him any mind.
"Phone me if there's any trouble, John, not that I expect there will be."  Mycroft was already looking disinterested as the car slowed to a stop outside of 221B.
“Hello, I’m John,” he said.  The woman standing in front of him was wearing a traditional jumper, her blond hair in two thick plaits, and her answering smile was so warm that John immediately felt his expression shift from trying to be pleasant to being truly pleased to see her.
It was an easy rhythm to fall into, a subtle back and forth of teasing pressure and retreat, Sherlock being the first one to insinuate his tongue into the proceedings.
John felt the interior of the car swimming before his eyes.  This was it.  Years of being Sherlock's friend had finally caught up with him.  He had gone insane, and was now hallucinating Mycroft telling him that Sherlock was getting ready to lay an egg.
“Come and see,” Sherlock said, tying the egg to his abdomen with practiced ease.  John felt a stab of jealousy, then relief as Sherlock started walking up the stairs.
"Obvious.  A previous lover is too complicated, and would require stretching the point of believability."
John went, leaning over the arm of the sofa to kiss Sherlock goodbye, a startlingly normal moment in the midst of what had been nearly three days of madness.  Even though he knew the temperature was normal, he couldn’t help but feel the difference in Sherlock’s lips, couldn’t help pressing his own forehead against Sherlock’s to gauge his fever.  Still low, but definitely there.
“You were expecting someone?”  John was already starting towards the door.
"What is this?"  He pulled his hand away and held his fingers up to the light.  They were coated thickly with something crystal clear but viscous, clinging, copious but not dripping, and as fever-hot as Sherlock seemed to be.  "Oh my god."
Sherlock looked at him carefully, slowly scanning his face in a way that John had come to know had less to do with actually looking at his features and more to do with accessing his mind palace, the files marked John Watson.
"Good."
“Table that for now,” Anborg said.  “Come see what I’ve brought,” Anborg said.
“Please,” Sherlock said.  John nodded as Mycroft walked past them, squeezing John’s right shoulder briefly before he left.
"I think that if it came down to quantifying it, despite his truly spectacular lack of some common knowledge and occasional lapses in what you might call common sense, he would have the higher IQ, but that wasn't why.  There are some genetic tendencies in my own family that, while they wouldn't have stopped me from having children in a more traditional way, I'd rather avoid if possible.”
John leaned back and reached down with his free hand, fingers skimming along his skin, pushing in just slightly, and gasped before his fingers had even come close to their target.
John let his face go carefully blank.  Sherlock had been gone from his sight for a year.  Then there had been a terrible month when Sherlock had returned, and John had been simultaneously drawn to him and repulsed by the sight of the man who had caused him so much pain.  It had taken the entirety of the month for John to absorb the message that Sherlock had truly staged his death to protect him as well as Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.  Since then it had been less than a year, but he could not imagine being without Sherlock again, ever again.  The realization hit him almost as hard as the fear itself, and he coughed into his fist.
"Yes.  We are indistinct, as the shell is quite dense, and the noise is distorted due to the curve.  Still, she will find our voices reassuring when she emerges."  Sherlock seemed to have no opinion on the gender of the baby, referring to it by whatever pronoun John had most lately used.  "Oh, and a Moby is the fabric wrap my mother gave us for the egg.  It serves well for a baby also.  Sarah will easily discern that you are woefully unprepared and unless I am mistaken as to her general nature she will want to remedy this.  Even so, I'd prefer that you are home by three.  Anborg will be coming over."
John hadn't kept track of where they were driving as Mycroft had been speaking, but he felt a tug in his abdomen, and he was willing to bet that it was towards 221B, all set off by Sherlock commanding that he come home.
“It does.”  John said the names silently to himself.  “Why Watson Holmes, instead of Holmes Watson?”
“John and I are going to take the egg to our room,” Sherlock said, holding it to himself as he stood up.
"I couldn't trust myself to think of a way to tell you that Moriarty couldn't intercept or extrapolate from your innocent movements.  You might have stopped for a sandwich on the way to work one day and he would have concluded that your appetite was better prior to the time predicted by my death and concluded that I was in fact alive.  It had nothing to do with trusting you or not, just as my filing of Lestrade under I for Inspector in my mental hard drive has nothing to do with my esteem or lack thereof for the man."
John let himself be moved by Sherlock, hands tilting his head as Sherlock’s tongue traced the edge of his lips.  John chased the astringent taste of peppermint around Sherlock’s mouth, laughing softly as their kiss became more of a game as they both struggled for dominance, until Sherlock played dirty and nipped at the center of John’s lower lip.
"I want the baby to have a leg up, socially," Sherlock said.
“Why are you so sure it was you? There are plenty of things I could be having nightmares about.”
he thought, irritated for only a moment.  "Well, there is the fact that I agreed with him."
"John."  He spoke as if the words were being punched out of him, all sudden breaths.  "Please, I'm going to be ill, just leave me in peace.  Go, ah, go visit your sister."
The morning went blessedly quickly, even his paperwork tidy by the time Sarah came around to the doorway of his borrowed office.
John pressed his hand down over Sherlock's hip, felt the sharp angle there, and pulled back the edge of the dressing gown.  Even though his lightweight pajama trousers the definition of Sherlock's hip bones was evident.
"Who will keep the egg warm if you and I are both out?"  John could only imagine being told to rush home from work if a case demanded Sherlock’s attention.  Sherlock had respected his need to work for the past few months, but John could see the egg wearing on that hard won boundary.
“Of course.”  John pulled off his shirt and vest and reclined, accepting the warm smooth egg onto his abdomen.
"Makes sense, doesn't it," John said, wiping his fingers off on his own thigh before curling close to Sherlock again.  "To help the egg come out?"
He paused at the doorway to his room.  The bed was accompanied now by a sleek bassinette in the same finish, a simple black and red mobile hanging over it.  Having already seen the bed John walked over to the mobile, reached up and touched it.  The simple structure was two thin black bars, curved, with a series of rounded red triangles.  It was unaccountably pleasing to the eye, and John found himself grateful that Mycroft had chosen something that was both appropriate for a baby and tolerable to the adults who would have to see it every day.
“We’re going to let Sarah and the others believe this baby is coming from a surrogate,” John pointed out.
"Right, ok."  John kept peering at the screen, and finally the phone was lifted out of the pocket, and held up.  It was nighttime, and the images were blurry, leaving trails, but it was easy enough to see the Millenium Eye, outlined in blue, clearly visible just as the muffled voices began something that sounded like a chant.  Or a countdown.
“No, no, it’s nothing bad, it’s just,” he sighed.  “I’ve got lots more to tell you, all good things, just, it’s a little odd, I suppose.”
John peered at him over the top of the egg.  “Yes you will.”
“We will do.  Though we’ll have visitors far before that.”
Sherlock was lying on top of the bedcovers, clad in pyjama bottoms and a soft t-shirt, though that was possibly in deference to his mother as he pulled it off the moment John walked into the room.  The glass was on his bedside table, empty, and John filled it, Sherlock already drinking thirstily as John sat on the edge of the bed.
“Some groceries, Tesco will do, our usual.  He can consult my receipts if he can’t deduce what the usual is.  For right now, Chinese from the end of Baker Street, and do ask him not to muck about with the fortunes. John finds it off-putting.”
Sherlock shook his head. "He attends Saint Mary's in Belgravia.  Purely for appearance, of course."
Sherlock gave him a wry look.  “I can note, and appreciate, an aesthetic.”
John snickered.  "You make it sound like I was going to torture the information out of you."  He turned his head as he shifted, snuggling closer to Sherlock, breathing deeply as he did.  "Are you releasing some sort of pheremone?"
“You'll have to keep it tasteful,” Sherlock warned. “Mrs. Hudson is a traditionalist.”
pour you a cup of tea."
"Sherlock?" he asked, scared.
He paused.
He sat down and had a scone and a cup of tea at her urging.  He was just pouring his second cup when Sherlock emerged, wearing a fitted black tee-shirt over jeans, a towel still slung around his neck to keep his dripping hair from soaking the shirt.  Seeing Sherlock in such casual clothes was still something of a shock, even after all these weeks.
Sherlock held his hands out for the egg.  "Look in the dresser," he said as he sat on the edge of John's bed.
“What do you mean, she cultivates this image?”
John nodded and closed his eyes, relieved.  For Sherlock to say that it was distasteful, that was harsh enough.  That he knew it was not desirable was more than John had hoped for.
“Sound thinking,” John said, getting down onto the floor to look at the egg more closely.  At first it appeared to be no more active than usual, which was to say not at all, but as he watched it seemed to shiver, rocking on the large end.  “I left work early because I just felt like something was going to happen.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose, as if that was going to help stave off the impending headache that was building behind his eyes.  Before he could answer the phone buzzed again.
“Brilliant and strange as ever.”  Her laugh was kind; he was clearly well loved.
Sherlock sighed.  "Obvious."
“Yes, right.”  John rolled his eyes, irritated, but not sure if he should say
John, Sherlock, and the egg have a house call from a doctor familiar with their situation.
She laughed softly.  “In a way we’re all cousins, I suppose.  Sigurson is a good friend, but  if we have a common ancestor it’s probably no more than you and I share.”
"Feel you," Sherlock managed to whisper.  "Swelling."
He set the egg back onto his lap and turned on the early morning news show, then switched it off as he realized he was listening acutely for any sign of what Sherlock might have been involved in.
"No, I," John started, then trailed off.  "A bit, yeah."
“Thank you,” John said.
“It’s only the albumin,” Annborg said.  “Just press a little.”
“Isotonic movements,” Sherlock said. “They are hard to feel.”
"That one I know!  It's a sort of bag you put the baby in.  I've seen parents with them."
"Yeah, I'll have to look into that.  Thanks."  Inside he panicked for a moment, thinking that paternity leave meant proving that the baby was real, that it had been born, in the usual sense, and that he was its legal parent.  He was trying to figure out how to cover up the lies that would have to spring from this, to Sarah, at least, but then she would check on him, asking Judith if he'd put in his forms.... He was distracted for the moment by the arrival of their starters, a cold pea and mint soup for him, and a single caprese bruschetta for Sarah.
"Yes," Sherlock said, pressing himself back and craning his neck to kiss John.  The angle was awkward, Sherlock's teeth snagging on John's bottom lip.
“Yes, fine, alright.  I get lonely.”
"Did he offer to buy us a new bed?"
"No, I was only just up the street and Sherlock's brother happened to mention to me that you were on your way to Piccadilly.  It would have been silly of me not to give you a lift."
John accepted her, holding her with both hands around her rib cage, easily encircling her tiny form, before setting her against his shoulder, his right hand holding her bottom.
"I said, it's not a trick."
He managed to type back.
John remembered then the distance she had travelled to help them.  “Can I get you anything?  Coffee?  Something to eat?”
"Shall we talk some place more private?"
John heaved a huge sigh and leaned back against the couch.  Trust Sherlock to infuse even a sincere apology with a damning insult.  He wouldn’t even see it as such, the implication being that John wasn’t using his mind but relying on modern machines, so it wasn’t even worth pointing out.
“I wasn’t going to do anything,” John protested.  The few seconds he’d spent with Sherlock’s mother she’d seemed an intelligent woman.  It seemed beyond the pale that she wouldn’t have questioned Mycroft at some point.
"John, stop."
Sherlock's spine slowly bowed outwards as he pressed himself hard into John, his head coming to rest on John's shoulder.  John turned towards him, mouthing over his neck, his jaw, wet, wide-mouthed near-bites that were too desperate and disorganized to be kisses.  Sherlock twisted towards him, struggling in his tight grip, a high pitched grunt of exertion bringing John back to himself for a moment.
"I would have gone wherever Mycroft went, of course, but as far as I know the choice was not presented to him.  Mummy and Father divided their tasks along fairly well established gender lines.  Mummy raised us, but we went to Norway for summer holidays and once every winter."
"Sherlock has made no secret to you that he has, in the past, been addicted to cocaine.  When he was twenty-one he was also experimenting with heroin.  He was removed from his disreputable dwelling and brought to our family's home.  He underwent detoxification and his cycle in the same week.  Due to the ravages of the withdrawal from drugs it is not clear if he experienced a strong urge to have his egg fertilized, and it's just as well.  He did feel that urge, to a certain extent, when he was fourteen, and despite fully understanding the fact that the egg itself was not, in fact, genetically speaking, a true egg, it was still agonizing."  Mycroft brought his steepled fingers to his face, a posture John had only ever seen in Sherlock.  "I wonder, sometimes, if the drug habit he developed later in his teens wasn't in response to trying to self-medicate that pain away.  Regardless, he has never returned to drugs, and as long as he has his work, I believe he never will."
"Why," John started to ask, then fell silent.  It wasn't really his business, after all.
“The only reason Sarah believes your far-fetched story is that the alternative, the truth, is so ludicrous.”
"Sherlock is extremely unusual, on one of only seven such individuals in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though northern Europe has a small population of people like him."
"Which part?  Detoxing?  Or..." He wasn't sure of the proper verb to describe what Sherlock was referring to.
Any further replies from John were cut short by Mrs. Hudson appearing at the still open door, a tray of scones in one hand and a teapot in the other.
The egg hatches! There's some crying, none of it from the baby.
Not, I love you.  Not, John, I love you.  John, I do love you-- as if Sherlock had predicted over a month ago that this would be part of an argument.
John sighed.  "Yes, that's it.  I know it's shallow, but one expects certain half truths from ones," he paused.  "From one's lover," he finished, the word carefully chosen.  One might not expect flattery from a partner, a pragmatic mate in all of life's endeavors, but from the man who had literally talked him into bed, he had been expecting at least a little massaging of his ego, slight though it was.
John looked down at the packaging on the bottle, which featured a photograph of a jolly baby, and breathed.
John looked up quickly, wondering how Sherlock could have deduced that Pret was exactly where he would have defaulted for lunch with Sarah, and realized that Sarah and Anthea were having a pleasant conversation.  He listened for a moment, realized it had something to do with cosmetics or moisturizer or something incomprehensible, and turned back to his phone without guilt.
John laughed in spite of himself and looked up at Sarah.  "Apparently we're going to the Criterion, courtesy of Sherlock."  He left out the fact that it was, actually, Sherlock's brother.
The egg is laid.
“Anthea.”  She smirked at him.
When he was done pondering all of that he looked up at the clock, surprised to note that it was past ten.  The QI reruns had given way to Cash in the Attic, and he hadn’t even noticed.  He listened to Jaunty tell someone that their Royal Doulton was, in fact, quite worthless, shifting the egg off his stomach as he did.  He’d been sitting in one place for so long that it had left an oval of warm pink skin there that he scratched at absently.
“Thoughtless!” John countered.  “Likely reckless as well.  Where the hell were you?”
“The head is developing nicely, and the placental sac is robust,” she said as she kept measuring.  “If we hold still you can see the pulse.”
“It’s a pleasure to do something a bit different,” Anthea said.  She was breaking down a chicken, now, and the way she sliced through the joints John wondered if it really was all that different from her usual set of duties.
"Can't we?"  Sherlock raised one brow at him.
"How did I not know that?"  John frowned, more at himself than her.  They'd dated only briefly, but it seemed like the sort of thing he would have discovered, either when they were speaking as friends, or when dining out together.
John shrugged, standing with the egg as she walked into the room.  She shooed him away
"And how is that likely to go?" John asked.
She turned to him with a glare, once more.  “Zilpha loves her sons, and love, as they say, is blind.  Her belief may be next door to a complete fiction, but she has never challenged Mycroft and he has never offered to disabuse her of the nature of his job.  It’s safer for everyone this way.”
"He wanted Irn Bru when he was fourteen.  That was his first cycle, and like most cycles at that age it produced an egg that in a bird would be called a dud.  There was no genetic material in it.  It was the equivalent of a polar body."
John only managed a cough, in any case.
"It's taken care of."  Sherlock stretched, his feet striking the foot board then sliding up over the curved edge.  "Mycroft concocted a story about how I'd finally given in and begun working for the government.  If Lestrade is in a tight spot and needs my particular skills, he can call on Mycroft."
On the bed the egg looked smaller than ever and John felt fear wash over him, bewildered at how a viable infant could be curled up inside.  When Sherlock laid himself down next to it, pulling it close against his stomach, the fear subsided.  He kicked his shoes off and got onto the bed, aware that he was ignoring Annborg but unable to care.
"So, are you ready?"  She already looked excited, John noted, though purely at the thought of receiving some new gossip.  She didn't know how right she was.
John waited until he'd walked away.  "I didn't know you didn't eat gluten."  The combination of Mycroft's thoughtfulness with his ever present need to remind John that he was watching and aware had left him on edge.
Sherlock smiled at her, meeting her gaze without a second thought, as if he weren’t literally naked, in bed.
"Good.  Then I don't have to worry about being under some kind of spell when I tell you that I love you too."
Sherlock and John have a disagreement, then go on a date.
John settled down on the bed, curled into the angle of the mattress, and pushed in with his middle three fingers, meeting the barest resistance, a sense of healthy flesh, but nothing more, the muscle and connective tissue underneath softening by the second, every push he made answered with a sense of giving way.
“That’s quite usual, anyway, even among people who aren’t gestating.”  She took out a handheld doppler and switched it on, a familiar hum as the unit readied itself.  “Shall we hear the heartbeat?”
Sherlock cleared his throat before speaking, but it didn’t lessen the roughened quality of his voice any.  “So do you.”
I would be able to discern it in an instant.  Likewise the cleft in your chin, your philtrum, and brow ridges.  Each of your features is unique to you, but my point was that taken individually they are common enough in our population that a resemblance between you and your child could be written off as mere coincidence."
“I did, though,” John said. His eyes filled with tears that had nothing to do with the smoke. “I believed you Sherlock. I believe you, full stop. Stop whatever this is that you're doing. Tell me where the egg is.” He knew he was pleading with a madman, but maybe there was enough of the Sherlock he had come to love still left inside that he would have only hidden the egg, not any other unthinkable possibility.
"It wasn't that I wanted to keep secrets," John said.  "We were together, and no one knew.  Then a few months went by and I thought, alright, I'll tell some people at work, and then we decided to hire the surrogate, and I thought, alright, we'll get this underway and I'll tell people that we're together, at least, and then she was pregnant right away and it just was all too much to say in one go, and I kept putting it off and putting it off and well.  Here we are."
John's brow furrowed as he tried to place the acronym, then remembered.  Oral rehydration therapy-- technically the mainstay of his practice in regards to people with GI complaints, though outside of the army he hadn't actually referred to it as ORT.
“Our car will be here soon,” Sherlock said, looking up the street.
Mycroft actually looked sympathetic.  "You must understand, John, I've been exposed to this idea for many years.  Most of my life.   I was six years old when Mummy laid the egg that was going to be Sherlock.  Towards the end of his gestation, when he was very nearly viable, I was allowed to keep him warm."
“That didn’t seem to be how you were operating at the time,” Sherlock said, his voice so quiet as to be almost without inflection.
"I'm sorry John, I don't usually lose my composure like that."
"You're holding it," Sherlock said.  "You're a doctor, I'm sure you understand the concept."
“That’s... not inaccurate.”
"Yes?"  John also didn't turn his head, still studying the flocked wallpaper.  Really, considering the abuse Sherlock put the entire flat through, it was in remarkably good nick.
“I should hope not,” John said.
"Because they wanted to stay married."
"John, you should know.  Your features, when taken as a whole, your face, is far from ordinary.  It is the only face that causes me, upon seeing it after an absence of some hours, to release certain chemicals in my brain.  Oxytocin, I believe.  Possibly dopamine as well."
John had been looking at Mycroft, couldn’t miss the narrowing of his eyes when Sherlock had said his name, the release of tension when Sherlock referred only to height.  “Can’t say the same will happen for you, Egzanthe,” he said, listening carefully as she grumbled and sighed, trying to decide when she’d had enough of being winded. She made a tiny squeak as her entire body jerked, and John stopped patting her back, looking from Mycroft to Sherlock to confirm that he’d heard an actual burp.
“Gestational infants probably cry to help clear their lungs of amniotic fluid, and because of the pressure of birth.  Maybe the light and the temperature difference too.  She’s consumed all the fluid in the egg so her lungs are dry and she’s been used to this temperature for a while.”
"I'm going to tell her about our impending baby."  Sherlock was well within hearing range, but just out of sight, setting up the microscope on the kitchen table.
“How did you choose her?” Sarah asked.
"No, I know, it's fine," he found himself babbling, stopped, said the first thing that came to mind.  "I'll keep him safe.  I'll keep both of them safe."
John nodded. “I've let Sarah know I won't be available around that time.”
He struggled to relax, loosening his collar and fidgeting the entire short trip home.  Once there he bounded up the stairs, pausing before the door of the flat only long enough to hear the click and hum of the front door locking itself behind him.
“The egg is fine,” Sherlock said, running his hands down John's arms. “Let me turn on the light.”
John laid his hand gently along the side of her chest, feeling the comforting rhythm of her breath.  It was the usual erratic pattern of the newborn, several shallow breaths followed by something like a gasp or a sigh. “A golden haired woman.”
“Sherlock never went to sleep.”
John let himself curl even more tightly against Sherlock's slighter frame, the firm, warm curve of his arse tantalizing.  A quick shift and his cock was aligned with the warm smooth cleft, only his willpower, nearly in shreds, keeping him from simply pushing forward until he found the pressure and heat he so desperately wanted.
“You’re a horrible liar.”
It was the first time John had ever sat in the back of the car with Mycroft, and he found the setting almost comforting,   It was natural, after all, to look straight ahead, or out one of the windows.
“Dare I ask about your father?”  With his eyes closed he felt like he was floating in a warm cloud, Sherlock and the egg the only grounding forces.
John looked at Sherlock, who grabbed his hand again.  “John, please.”
In the corner of the drawer there was a stack of small socks, also in white.  The next drawer down revealed more colorful fare, in larger sizes, but still tiny, though these with long legs, some with feet on.
“Technically, I’m sure,” John answered.
"And if I don't?" John asked.  His first impulse was to say
“No, Sherlock, it is not.” John realized that Sherlock was wearing entirely different clothes than the ones he’d left in, an ill-fitting pair of jeans held up with a belt and a sweatshirt, of all things.  Possibly he’d found them in the lost and found at NSY’s gym.  The thought was appalling enough without the implication that his own clothes had been ruined.
"As you can see, John, I'm naked."  He strode off towards John's room, leaving John to look at the carnage of Sherlock's room-- broken bed, disheveled linens, pants all over.  He sighed and went to answer the door.
John sighed as she drank again, this time holding the glass herself.  “Be that as it may, Sherlock, it’s the done thing to express your concern at your unwitting culpability when something like this happens.”
“I really do not want to know why that's even an issue, do I?” John asked.
“How on earth did he know we were going to need a car?” John asked as they got in.
"Yes, as I said, it's alright with me that you share this with her. When the baby arrives it will be inevitable, but beyond that I know you trust her. She's not a dull woman, even if she was eminently unsuitable for you, and it may be useful to have her aware of the fact that we're expecting a baby.  Certainly you're not going to be able to be at her beck and call for covering shifts all over London."
"Now, please, are you satisfied?"  Sherlock moaned as John withdrew his fingers, deliberately dragging them over the swell of his prostate as he did.
“How much does she weigh, do you think?” John asked as he began gently patting her back.
"No, not that strange at all that you helped hatch egg-Sherlock."  John groaned, still resigned to being within the throes of some hallucination.  "How the hell did your parents keep you from telling the other children at school?"
The doorbell saved them from having to explore the issue further.
John typed to him.
"Was it something I did?"
“That he will never be without help again, for the rest of his life,” Mycroft said, finally letting go of John’s arm.
"Sure, that's a," his mind went blank.  "It's a sort of toy, right?"
Instead of placing the egg inside, Sherlock handed it to John, then placed his own hands inside the box, a look of intense concentration on his face.
“About four milliliters,” Sherlock said. “Not bad considering her stomach has never taken in anything other than her own saliva.”  He pulled the bottle away, leaving her open mouthed.  “I’m sure she could do with winding.”
“You could ask Mycroft,” John said.
He looked up to see Sherlock watching him, his gaze unabashedly traveling from his head to his toes.  John swallowed hard, realizing that he was cupping his balls in his hand-- either an unconscious masking or he was offering himself, he didn't even know.
"Sherlock's brother?  Does he work here?"
"Why didn't you correct me when I said the egg would have to be incubated for nine months?"
Sherlock didn’t pause, kept sliding down, John groaning out loud as he was finally seated in Sherlock’s throat, the flutter of muscle around him all the more stimulating for the trust that Sherlock was placing in him, giving John power over his very breath.  John closed his eyes and let Sherlock set the pace, his hips rolling slowly against the bed as Sherlock encouraged him to slowly fuck his mouth.
“Are you sure? What if you need to move around?  What if you’re ill again?”
“Just about,” John said, pleased that the lie seemed to be working.
them, all of the people in his family, including John.
“Pulse is ninety-two,” Ann said, moving the doppler about slightly to find the loudest point.  “Perfectly normal for this stage.”
John slid in, curling around the egg as Sherlock straightened his legs.  The surface was warm and dry.
John lifted his head, ready to challenge him, then thought better of it.  “Yeah, alright, but I get to do the same to you.”
“No.”
“A mobile.  Yes.”  Sherlock touched one of the triangles, pulled down on it gently, and let go.  The entire structure was so balanced that it barely bounced as it settled back into its original shape.  “One of the first mobiles, actually.  A Calder.”
John leaned away, teeth worrying the slightly swollen place, knowing full well that it drove Sherlock mad.  Sherlock fixed him with a hard stare, almost a glare, a clear message that while he knew what John was doing he was also not going to stop himself.  Instead of launching himself at John, however, he stood, walking to John’s side of the bed and grasping the waistband of his pyjamas, pulling once he’d made sure John had a firm grip on the egg.
"Not cruel, no.  Maybe a little blunt."
John threw his arms in the air. “I’m gone for those hours,
Sherlock shrugged.  “He won’t notice the state of it, though he’ll notice it’s contents.  Sort of a forest for the trees situation.”
"His family tree goes back ages, and there isn't anything obvious, beyond the usual heart disease here and there."
“I did have one idea.”  John leaned against his upper back, looking down at their daughter.
He set the bags down as she stood, smiling.
John leaned towards Sherlock, his eyes closing before their lips touched, secure, as always, in the knowledge that Sherlock would find him.  Sherlock’s hands cupping his head felt cool,  one hand dropping down to rest with John’s hand against the egg as their bodies shifted closer.   The egg was an ever-present entity in John’s mind, and no matter where he was moving his own body he was aware of where the egg was in relation to himself.  Still, it was comforting to have Sherlock’s hand resting next to his on the warm smooth shell, protection against either of them rolling over onto it.
"My word not good enough for you?"  He held Mycroft's gaze.
"Anthea doesn't seem to know about your mother."
There was the briefest flicker of confusion on Sherlock's face, tightening around the eyes, and then he was unfolding himself, standing up on the sofa for a moment before stepping down to the floor. "Why Scots?" he asked, affecting not to care, a sure sign that he really wanted the answer to something he didn't know.
"I'm more comfortable lying flat at the moment.  It's beginning to take up quite a lot of room and my choices have come down to standing or lying flat."
“You know, I don’t think a tablet is a good idea,” John said.
"What about when he was twenty-one?"
“Most?” John asked.
“I’m guessing that she likes to garden?  Or perhaps she has horses.”  He knew he was wrong from the moment he spoke.
“Of course.”  She took out her phone and stepped into the kitchen as Sherlock sank down on the floor next to John.  John shifted as Sherlock put his arm around John’s back, holding him tight as they both stared at the egg.
Sherlock sat down next to him, a firm hand on his leg. “You said at the beginning that not knowing was one of life's last great mysteries, even for parents who are having a gestational child. I inferred that you didn't want to know.”
“I did not.”  Sherlock folded the shirt and set it aside, a slight moue twisting his mouth as he looked away from it, but not back at John.
Sherlock chuckled as he gathered the egg up, leaving John his vest. “Yes, well. Despite her mein and her various accomplishments in the machinations of our government, I believe it is still a description that suits her, when it comes to children.
Sherlock had pulled this trick, of going and not coming back for hours, but not since the egg.  John picked up his phone and thumbed out a text.
"I know that."
John started with surprise. "You'd let Mycroft do that?"
“And things for the baby.”
John waited but nothing else came. "Alright?"
John shifted himself to the edge of the bed.  “I’ll go down and get a bottle for her.” Just walking to the door felt like tearing himself away, and he startled as he opened the door only to reveal Mycroft on the other side.
When he returned to the lounge he found that Sherlock had tidied the coffee table, placing a pitcher of water and a beaker within easy reach, as well as the television remote and Mrs. Hudson’s knitting basket.
"It's not obvious, because it sounds as though it should be the stuff of rank fantasy, or science fiction.  But it is very real.  Still, at the moment, you have nothing but my word."
“Doesn’t he?”
“We’re fine.  Go to work.”  Sherlock kissed him hard on the mouth, then turned back to his book.  “Yes, Doctor Watson, I’ll drink plenty of fluids and I will eat while you’re gone.  I promise.”
John sighed deeply, holding the egg against his abdomen.  "I swear, I will always tell you the truth," he said, his face pointed towards the egg so there could be no mistaking who he was addressing.
She was also clearly unsurprised by the presence of Anthea at the worktop, wielding their sharpest santoku knife and turning a series of vegetables into neat thin strips.
“She’s throwing off her own heat now as well as using your body heat,” Anborg said to John.  “As she nears the limits of the egg in terms of growth, she consumes the yolk at a faster pace.   It’s like a last burst of growth before she hatches.”
"Boys.  Dinner."
He needn’t have worried.  Sigeursonn was even taller than Sherlock, clad in similar clothes to what his son preferred, but his face was entirely different.  In that moment John realized that Sherlock had his mother’s features, entirely, except for his hair.
“Essentially, John, I do not want our child to ever use the word survival to refer to her childhood, her time in our house, or us. I hope that is enough to reassure you that even though we may differ in how we approach her, our aims will ultimately be the same.”
“Are you sure?” John asked, already half hard, watching with rapt attention as Sherlock returned to his own side of the bed.
John watched, trying to make some sense, some reason as to why Sherlock would have bothered to go down to the Embankment on New Years, why he would film it with his phone, what it had to do with John.  The picture jostled, Sherlock holding the camera up with one hand, a sea of peoples' heads moving about beneath the bright sky.  Then, camera still held high, Sherlock held out his small notebook, flipped it open, and trained the camera on it.  In the next flash of light, John could see what he'd written there, in block letters across two pages.
When Sherlock looked at him the corners of his eyes were wet, the slightest tremble to the corner of his mouth.  “No, I never did.”  He laid his hand along the top of John’s where he held Egzanthe firmly to him.  “I never dared.”
“I’ve made you drop your shopping, so sorry.”  She stepped past him to pick up the bags before he could stop her, and he found himself following her into the kitchen.  “Sherlock is very fond of tart things, he’ll love this.”  She set the bottle of blood orange lemonade on the table and shelved the others in the refrigerator, apparently unbothered by the large plastic container labeled “viscera.”
He looked at Mycroft.
"What are we going to do with you?" John asked.  "I mean, now.   You're going to become insufferable, aren't you, asking me to fetch things?"
"We are always to the point with each other."
"I probably did, and deleted it.  I don't know about the solar system, remember?"  He stretched his arms over his head and leaned back, shirt coming untucked from his trousers as he did.  "I'll leave the literary allusions to my blogger."
“Yes, from now on, and things for the baby.”
"Well, he's got you to look after him."
," Sherlock growled, shifting so that John's fingers were all but guaranteed to slip inside him. John let it happen, two fingers sliding in up to his second knuckle with only the barest amount of resistance.  He pushed in deeper, Sherlock's walls silky smooth around his fingers, not a single groove or texture, only heat and slick as far as he could push.
“It’s material that is warmed from your own body heat.  You wear it while you’re caring for your baby and when it’s time to put her down you lay her on the warm pad.  The old ones were made of specially fluffed wool but these new ones are even thinner, very safe to place a small infant on.  You know she can’t have blankets or pillows, right?”
"Yes.  That's the plan."
“Boys, I’m fine, the egg is fine.”  She drank the rest of the Lucozade thirstily.
John's phone buzzed on the desktop and he looked down, irritated at both it and himself.
John sighed, aware that it was pointless to argue, and followed Mycroft out to his car, just pulling silently up to the kerb.
“And our child,  and teenager,” John said, having a sudden vision of the sorts of gifts Sherlock would likely find appropriate.  Far from what he’d expected, Sherlock had a deft hand when it came to choosing gifts, and with a child John was fairly sure that he’d follow the maxim of giving what he’d like to receive, or what he would have liked to have received.
his traitorous mind supplied, but he had that on his branch of the family tree too.  It evened out.  "It was my decision too."  Even though it was a base lie, it felt true.  Had they hired a surrogate, he would have preferred Sherlock to be the donor.
"Are you alright?"  He forced himself to hold still as he waited for an answer.
John managed to shuffle backwards, awkwardly, on his knees, trying to pull out of Sherlock slowly, as if that would have an appreciable difference in terms of the likelihood of conception.  It was almost too easy, after how tight Sherlock had been, and as he looked down at Sherlock in the low afternoon light it seemed that he was more open than ever.  John reached out, tracing a fingertip around the dark pink flesh, marveling at how slick he still was.  He added a second finger and slipped inside without any resistance, pushed down to feel the expected elastic resistance, but there was none, Sherlock's flesh giving way as easily as if he were pushing on the corner of his own mouth.
John's arms and legs were shaking as he carefully lowered both himself and Sherlock to the bed.  His knees fought to find purchase on the smooth sheets, his head spinning as he made sure that Sherlock was all the way back down before he relaxed his arms.  A moment later he realized why everything felt so wrong.
“What about sorting it out for your father’s visit?” John asked.
John sighed but did as she’d suggested, laying out the last of their mismatched (but genuine) silverware just as Mrs. Holmes came back into the kitchen.
“I’ve already phoned Annborg.  She’ll be here in less than an hour.”
"It will."  Sherlock's phone chimed at him, and he angled his head to see the screen.  "Speak of the devil, that would be Mycroft.  As you can see I can't leave the bed, so you'll have to deal with him."
“Having met her, I wouldn't have bet that tempering softness was her defining feature.”
John grabbed his bag from his office and nearly ran out the back door, slowing himself to a fast walk when he got to the pavement, lest he bowl someone over.  He looked frantically up and down the street, wondering if the bus was coming, or had just been, then gave into impulse and hailed a cab.
"I want this too," Sherlock said.  "I've wanted this, too, before now.  For months.  Since before," he paused.  "Before I left."
And it would continue to be a while, he thought, as he glanced into Speedy's.  He'd been interrupted from his own cup of coffee by Sherlock's... emergency, and he was considering stopping in, having a cup there, maybe a look at the paper, see if there was a copy of What's On lying about.  Instead what he saw was Mycroft Holmes, looking decidedly at home, umbrella propped against the side of the table as he drank his cup of coffee.
Sherlock had left the dim bedside lamp on, and his pale irises seemed to pick up and reflect the light.  John had always thought of him as other-worldly.  Now, with the egg between them, it seemed that in one way he was right.  In a much broader view, it was quite the opposite.  Sherlock was of this world, but John, and most of the people in it, didn’t observe all that was happening.
"A surrogate," John said.  “One that was a stranger to us, that we have no connection to.”
“I see.”  John opened the door to the flat, thinking. Sherlock had never shown a casual closeness with any group before, and referring to all of the egg-born and their children and families as his cousins revealed a side of him that John hadn’t seen before.
John knelt behind him, gently pushing on Sherlock's lower back until he'd lowered himself to the proper height.  John's erection had flagged a bit in the open air, the slick fluid cooling on his skin, and he groaned as he sank in, feeling himself fill and press against Sherlock's soft walls.
“Who she pretends to think has a minor government post,” John finished.
“Annborg.”  He sounded pleased to see her.
“As far as Zilpha is concerned, Mycroft does have a minor position in the British Government.”
"Like Mycroft," John mused.
“Now, John, the tact you love so well would have been exemplified by you not saying that.”  Sherlock picked up his tea and all but hid behind it, resting the saucer on the jumper-covered upper curve of the egg.
"It's taken care of."  He put on his jacket and they walked down the hall together.  Even though they exited through the side of the building he was unsurprised to see one of Mycroft's cars waiting for them, and only slightly surprised to see that Anthea was driving.
Sherlock looked unusually relaxed, pliant, even, the opposite of the alert calculating look he might have assumed Sherlock would take.
“Well, that took all day.”
“Sorry?”  John had been lost, not in thought, but in a pleasant quietness.
As soon as she was gone Anthea set the knife down and turned to John.  “I need you to understand something,” she said, her voice low and urgent.
"Mrs. Hudson.  Mummy will be by often.  Even Mycroft."
Mycroft held his gaze, silent once more.
"Which is why I need you
“Siguersonn isn’t much of a mystery, I have to say,” Anborg said, a slight laugh coloring her words.  “He’s quite literal.  And I’ve never known him to hurt anyone’s feelings intentionally, but he’s quite blunt.  He doesn’t have an abundance of tact.”
"We hired a surrogate, and Sherlock and I decided that he should be the donor."
"Of course.  Isn't everything?"  Sherlock drained the last dregs and held the glass out imperiously.
From the corner of his eye John could see that they both had their mobile phones out already. He let his head fall back on the sofa, already exhausted by the speed at which their minds worked. Whether or not Mrs. Hudson wanted a fortified foyer she was going to get one.
"Naturally not, it's posterior to the ovipositor."
“I've had more practice than either of you,” Sigeursonn said. For all his strange concrete manner, his hands held the egg with a gentle practiced cradle of his palms. “She feels strong.” He smiled. “If the child is a boy, I will of course change my use of pronouns.”
“Um,” John hesitated too long to brush the question off entirely.  “It’s more than just that we’re together.”
“A couple more weeks, right?” John asked. He knew it was, he could count, but he wanted to hear Sherlock say it.
Once inside John was totally unsurprised that they were led immediately to a corner table, a waiter appearing as if out of thin air as soon as they were seated.  As he handed Sarah her menu he opened it carefully, pointing inside.
"I can't breathe lying on my back like that.  The egg is taking up too much room."
“She had been here once, and not a lot had happened, as compared to a,” he paused, catching himself before he could say
“I wouldn’t know anyone like that.”
"Why should I deal in half truths when the truth itself is so indicative of my feelings for you?"
"It didn't seem like a good time to shock you.  We will adjust."
“We are very lucky,” Sherlock said softly, as if volume could keep the fact that he felt such a sentiment secret.  When the toast popped up Sherlock buttered a piece for each of them and they stood leaning over the worktop to catch the crumbs.
John stalked off to his room to change, vowing that whatever happened, Sherlock was not going to drag him on any adventures or cases that day.
“At eight o’clock on a Friday morning?  They don’t.”
“Not what, John, who.”  Sherlock picked up the swaddled egg and made his way to the stairs, moving slowly, both hands holding it to his stomach as John followed.  “As you’re not holding the egg, you can google it.”
John's mouth tightened. “You are correct.” Whereas Sherlock had indulged himself in his aloof pursuits into adulthood, John had run headlong into a career that dictated that he had dozens of men he referred to as brothers. It was too obvious, even without Sherlock pointing at every sign.
“That’s just ego talking,” John said, but there was an uncomfortable sense that he might be right.
That had to have been going on for days, at least, maybe weeks.  He rinsed the glass out at the sink, half filled it with Lucozade, and brought it to Sherlock.
"So, that tends to be a long process.  How is it going?"
"Did either of your parents ever remarry?"  John found that his body had adjusted to the higher temperature-- instead of making him feel feverish he felt relaxed, totally at ease.
“And it is only a guess,” Sigeursonn said. “Well, it's an estimate based on probability, but you could still have a perfectly healthy boy with a ring like this.”
“You say that like it's a bad thing,” John said.
“I find myself feeling a bit empty handed though.” John leaned back, listening as Sherlock hummed his response. “What do you and John need?”
“It might be, yet.  You’re doing a half day today, aren’t you?”
“You could have told me which days she was coming.  I do work per diem, Sherlock, I can have any day off that I want, within reason.”
“Well, what is tact other than a lie by omission to keep the other party comfortable.”
John laughed, covering his face with his hands.  "If that's what you're calling it."
“Yes,” she whispered, but didn’t look at him.  “Oh, John, I’ve got so weak all of a sudden.  Where is the egg, did I drop the egg?”
“Slow down, won’t you?   There’s jam.”
John nodded, sure that Sherlock would gloat when he heard that it had all gone so perfectly to his predictions.  They both looked up when their waiter appeared, bearing a sticky pistachio and pastry sweet for John and a dark chocolate mousse topped with a raspberry and a mint leaf for Sarah.  As John’s pudding was set down he detected the unmistakable scent of rosewater.  As Sarah exclaimed over the perfection of her treat John felt something like a quick sharp stab in the gut.  Mycroft just couldn’t let a gift be a gift without a subtle reminder that he knew John, knew where he’d been.  It was delicious though, the sticky shredded wheat pastry around the ground pistachios reminding him of a hot distant place that he was just as glad to have been as to be back from.
John went to the coat hook, pulled his jacket on, and slowly walked down the stairs.  As a doctor he was worried about dehydration, bleeding, and, worst of all, the possibility of a vaso-vagal episode.  As a man, though, he understood Sherlock's request for privacy.  He was standing on the pavement when his phone buzzed.
“The agency had us interview a couple of women.  She just seemed genuinely bright and kind.  And to tell you the truth, she looks a bit like the Watson side of my family.  She’s got similar coloring to me.  Similar nose.”
“How does she explain the car, then.  His suits.
"What are you talking about?" John asked.  "And what does this have to do with Sherlock being sick?"  He texted:
“When she cracks the shell you’re going to be very tempted to help her.  It’s much better for her if you hold back and don’t move any of the pieces of the shell until the cracks are at least as wide as your thumb.  It’s even better if you wait until the largest crack is separated by two thumb widths.  If you’re not sure, I can come have a look.”
“That makes sense,” John said.  The fact that there was a human foetus in there, just about half term, formed with hands and feet, face and eyes, fingernails, toenails, entirely recognizable, still hit him with a sense of vertigo at times.  He’d become so used to thinking of it as the egg, an entity unto itself.  The fact that the last burst of consumption before birth reminded him of the golden glow, the one energetic lucid time that the dying sometimes had, using up the last of their resources before leaving the world.  It was analogous, in a way.  Their daughter or son was going to leave the inner world of the egg and enter the outer, a place nearly as alien as the afterlife would be to anyone else, but he doubted that Sherlock would appreciate the comparison of the hatching to death.
Anborg chatted amicably with them for a bit longer, until John had cleared the tea things away.  John realized that after the baby was shown to be healthy she really would not have any reason to come around, and yet, she was, at least peripherally, Sherlock’s family.  Thoughts of visiting Anborg and the others with the baby in tow filled John’s head as he did the washing up.
John merely shook his head as he went up the stairs, but when he did wake, sprawled in the middle of the bed, the sun was well up.
In the kitchen he found the second bottle of  Lucozade that he’d bought just about six weeks before.  It was unopened.  He poured it into a glass and brought it out to Mrs. Hudson.
“He is. Siguersonn isn't one to call excessively ahead of showing up. He said he would be here tomorrow and so he shall be.” Sherlock glanced at the clock. “Later today, in fact.” Sherlock was quiet for a moment, but with the air of waiting to say something else. “I know that you will get on with him, but I do hope that you like him.”
“I’ll get her some,” John said, standing slowly from where he’d crouched in front of her.  “Just wait here.”
“No kidding,” John managed, gasping as he fought to sit up straight. “Sorry. Sorry. Is the egg alright?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, his entire face becoming pointier, an expression John hadn’t seen since they had been in Baskerville.  “You leave me alone with the egg every day.  You think I haven’t noticed that you’re picking up shifts all over London?  I have.  You’re seeking them out.  We don’t need the money, John.   You’re leaving to avoid,” he trailed off, sitting down heavily in one of the kitchen chairs.  “You’re leaving to avoid me.”
"I had considered mailing a letter to myself, leaving the postmark intact, and presenting it to you should this situation arise.  However, I suspect that you consider Mycroft both able to interfere with the mail and willing to help me."
Egzanthe threw her arms over her head suddenly, eyes opening as she smacked her lips, turning her head from side to side.
"I'm an idiot," he said.  "An actual idiot.  I didn't even ask how this baby was going to eat?"
John shook his head.  “Not remotely.  Sherlock, I’m in my clothes from yesterday.”
Annborg handed John a soft blanket and he gently wrapped the baby.
"I know.  But this," he sighed, knowing he was dangerously close to insulting Sherlock's family.  "I'm not used to it."
“Let’s see if it fits.”
“And you claim not to be sentimental,” John said as he pulled away.
"And this is particularly meaningful to me because?"  Sherlock was still not in the habit of polite conversation, and in truth John could have simply plowed ahead with the entire contents of his thoughts, but he was still caught in the rhythms of how ordinary people spoke.
“It was still a betrayal. I know that you feel that you would have preferred to have made the choice, even though it would have led to your death. Merely giving you the choice could have led to your death and the death of others, but that does not mean that you didn't spend a year living in the grip of what you thought was an unforgivable betrayal of trust and love.”
“I’m not,” John said, shifting the egg in his arms.  “I’m not trying to avoid you.  It’s only that you’ve apparently decided that of the two of us you should be incubating the egg and I’m a convenient second.  It leaves me at loose ends when I’m not working.  Why shouldn’t I go to work?”
John's head snapped up. “You weren't in it.”
"Her husband was aware of the presence of Klekket Barn in the UK and the United States and for reasons unknown decided that it was incumbent upon him to rid the world of a few freaks."  His eyebrows drew together. "Mrs. Hudson was entirely unaware of his activities, but when I became involved in the case I had to reveal my own history."  He shifted, adjusting the egg.  "Or I should say, I wanted to tell her.  She is of a certain age-- some people become close minded and bitter, especially people who have suffered a change in their fortunes, as she has.  Others begin to realize that there is truly nothing new under the sun and become very accepting and," he paused, searching for the right word.  "Sweet."
John sighed, happy to let the thought go.  Sherlock was right, and while it had stung, while he would have welcomed the chance to take on the risks for himself, to work with Sherlock, it was water under the bridge.  Sherlock was here now, and John couldn't help but admit that he was glad that they both were alive.
One of the employees crossed the lawn, glancing up at them for a moment.  The first crowds of the day were already amassing at the gate, tourists with itineraries and too much to do in one day crammed on them, to be sure.  John watched the man walk over to the ravens’ enclosure.  He opened the door, and the bird sat on his arm, looking proprietary and calculating.
John and Sherlock peered down into the egg.  Their heads, pressed together, blocked much of the light, but John could just make out what seemed like a soft pale dome, rising and falling minutely, as if she was already breathing the atmospheric air that she’d let in.
John hardly knew what to do with his legs as Sherlock folded himself up, knees near John’s chest, plane of his stomach curving around the egg, face lowered to John’s hip so Sherlock could nip and suck at the soft thin skin there.
John shifted, edging away from Sherlock's chin, but Sherlock only held him tighter.
"Greg.  He's bound to notice you're not turning up."
“I felt that, but I thought it was just the way the egg was. Even bird eggs can have little ridges in them.”
“I didn’t think I could decide before meeting her.”  Sherlock brushed his hand over the top of her head, her sparse hair catching the late evening light and glowing a warm gold.
"They're paid well for their discretion, you can be sure," Sherlock said, but stood up, cradling the egg against himself with the blanket draped over it.
"He's generous, clearly, but he won't know what you need.  Do you know what you need?  Do you have
“Bassinette,” Sherlock said.  “Or a proper cot, I can’t tell which.  Though if it’s being placed in my bedroom, I’m guessing bassinette.”
"One of our cousins will come and assess it soon, but I feel that it is.  If it were not alive it would already be putrifying."
“Do you have everything you’ll need?” Anborg asked.  “I hope you say no, because I’ve got a care package from Strynn here.”  She indicated the largest case that she’d carried up with her.
"I'm not at all bothered by it," she said.  "We only ever went out for Thai or Chinese, and those are easy enough, and when you came over to my place I cooked."
“Sherlock, I got you lemonade,” John called as he let himself in, closing the door behind him by leaning on it, his hands full with keys and the carrier bag.  “It’s blood orange, so I think it will be tart, do you want a glass right now?”  When he looked up he froze, for a moment, realizing that the person in Sherlock’s usual chair was not, in fact, Sherlock, but a woman, her silver hair swept up into a loose chignon.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said.  “There was no way to predict this.”
“A university student,” Sarah said. “She must be young.”
"What?  Who?" Sherlock said, rolling towards him, egg cradled against his belly.  Despite his fairly clear tone John was quite sure he'd awakened him.  Sherlock gently pushed the egg into the space between them and John took it.
“Where did your love of the understatement come from, John, is it a misplaced nod to modesty?  My mother loves you and considers you a part of her family.  I suspect that she’d happily kill for you at this point.”
John shook his head. “You don't have to get up in the middle of the night to make me something to drink,” he protested.
“How so?”  John found he could barely keep his hands off the egg, wondered how he was ever going to manage to eat if he was holding the egg during dinner.
“That's something I've never heard you say before,” John said. “Though based on what you and Anborg have told me, I'm sure that I will, once I get to know him a bit.”
"It's a poem," John said.  "A fairly famous poem.  I'm surprised you didn't learn it at school."
She pressed her fingers under her eyes and smiled at him, composed once more.  "I know you will."
"I have, but she knows that there's something more."
"I was thinking to myself, about the milk, had I ever heard you be that altruistic.  Then it occurred to me, that you hiding for a year, knowing that I thought you were dead, that would have been altruism as well.  I just thought of that year, and how I'd never really truly considered what it was like for you."  He sighed, his breath shuddering as if he'd been crying, though his throat hadn't even felt thick.
“Let me just get you two settled,” Annborg said as she followed them.  John took a deep breath and allowed it, the need to be alone with only Sherlock and the egg almost overwhelming.
Sherlock’s father grasped his upper arm and looked at him for a moment, the closest, John presumed, that they’d come to an embrace.
“I knew she would be,” Sherlock said.  “Will you tell the others they can come up in a bit?”
“You see but you don’t observe,” Sherlock said.  “I know this.  This time, though, I put it up to willfulness, or, as you might say, thoughtlessness.   That was perhaps unfair of me.”
Sherlock shook his head as he lowered his legs, John leaning back to make it easier for him.
John forced himself to look up at Sherlock, noting the way the tip of his nose had gone pink, and the triangle of forehead above and between his brows.  “Sherlock?”
“On the weekends we usually see her at least once,” John said.  “She lives outside the city but she’ll come stay with us closer to time.  She’s a university student.  Sherlock keeps pretty close tabs on her anyway and she lives with her family so we’re not concerned that she’s off getting into mischief.”
Sherlock wasn't even looking at him as he spoke, already turning back to the kitchen and his experiment, but John turned his face to the wall anyway, hiding the hurt expression that he knew had to be settling there.
“Well naturally. He’d never met Egzanthe before.”  They leaned closer and closer until their heads were touching, casting her in shade, the curve of their bodies a warm space for the sleeping infant.  Everything John knew narrowed down to the sight of her, the press of Sherlock’s hand and side against his own, the sound of their breathing. Eventually the door would open, other people would come in.  She would need a nappy, soon, and clothes. For the moment John allowed the tiny space to be his entire world, and dared to believe it was real.
"Fine.  This is the truth, at least, as it is understood right now.  There is much we don't understand about the theory of evolution.  While Sherlock and Mummy are both incontrovertibly human, there are traits that they share that are not commonly found in humans, or, indeed, in mammals.  The platypus and other monotremes are notable exceptions, but as far as we know they are the result of an early branching of mammalian evolution.  There is no direct link between the eutherians and the monotremes, but that leaves the branch of the human tree represented by people like Sherlock and Mummy a continuing mystery."
"Is this New Year's?"
"Oh god."  His phone buzzed and he looked down at it.
“John, go, we’re fine.”  Sherlock was half-reclined on the couch, the egg a bump under his jumper.  His right hand held the egg steady while he held a thin book in the other hand, balanced against the back of the sofa.  (The book was written in French.
They both stared at Tower Bridge, aware that some of the tourists were looking up at them, too far away for their expressions to be seen.
John brushed his teeth, getting angrier by the second.  Once out in the lounge again he checked his phone- no messages.  He sent one more.
She sat down on the sofa with it.  “Hello you precious thing.”  She smoothed her hands over the shell, lingering over where the developing foetus’ head was.  “Any guess, Dr. Watson, as to whether it’s a boy or a girl?”
“I can’t believe we didn’t decide before now,” John said.
“I’ve never seen him so besotted,” Sherlock said once they heard him going down the stairs.
Sherlock tossed a folded cheque on the coffee table, where it opened just enough for John to see the amount of naughts.  If it wasn’t enough for him to quit his job, it would be at least enough to provide enough padding for a lengthy paternity leave.
