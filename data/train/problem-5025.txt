Bucky surged out of the chair and threw his arms around them both. “We won’t lose you?” His voice was shaky.
Clint pulled away from Tony, struggling to keep his breathing even. He swiped at his face, brushing away the tears. “Couldn’t do anything,” he said, his voice raw. “Nobody could.”
I reread the comments over & over - they give me incentive to continue. Thank you all for the support.
Thor held out his arms and Matilda leaped into them. The rumbling purr that started immediately after had them staring.
Steve slouched on the sofa in the corner of the workshop, ignoring DUM-E's attempts to foist a no-doubt poisonous glass of what-the-fuck-ever on him. He looked edible. It was completely unfair. “Hi there,” Steve said. “Thought I'd better bring you something to eat.”
“I love you like a brother, man,” Tony said and then stopped, eyes flicking between Thor and Loki. “I love you like a brother from
“That is my intention,” Thor agreed. “I have come to tell you of where the casket that bears our friend has been placed.”
“Ooh, I’m so scared,” Tony shivered, clearly anticipating something of the sexual variety. Steve moved to Bucky. “You look better,” he said, bending to kiss him. It felt so natural that he wondered why he hadn’t ever tried to act on this back when they’d been growing up.
day!” Tony declared, channelling his inner Aragorn. He smoothed the back of Rhodey’s shirt. It had gotten a little crumpled in his sweaty fingers. “Thanks for lying down on the grenade for me, Petal.”
Thor turned to Steve. “I would be happy to spar with you, Steve.” He smiled. “Expending a little energy would be just the thing, I think.”
Thor and Natasha followed, Tony draped across their shoulders which left Steve the last to cross over, walking backward, shield and gun out. The gate closed the moment Steve’s feet hit the ramp.
Tony went cold. “What the fuck are you talking about?” he demanded. And then stopped. He looked over at Rhodey with horror in his heart. “Extremis,” he whispered. Rhodey’s eyes went wide.
“Were you ever on our side?” It was Sam who asked the question, who leaned into Wanda’s space with no fear.
“Good morning, Captain Rogers. It is five am and you are in your room at Stark Mansion.” Without prompting, F.R.I.D.A.Y. continued the ritual that J.A.R.V.I.S. had begun when he was still in Stark Tower.
Tony. No way would Tony Stark be okay with being a mindless puppet. No matter what was coming. Tony wasn't the sort to hide. He faced things head-on.
Barnes slipped through the house like a shadow, careful not to trespass, not to offend. It was making Tony nuts.
Bruce chuckled as the doors opened on his floor. “I believe the term is ‘pwned’, Stark.” Tony was impressed with Bruce’s street speak.
Scott’s shoulders slumped. “It’s just, I want to go home. Maybe it won’t be the same, but I’m not used to hanging out with a team. I want Cassie. I want Hope. Hell, I even want Hank.”
“Pep?” His voice sounded scratchy, hoarse as though he’d been screaming for days. He turned his head to look at her.
Rhodes sighed, indicating that Steve sit in the co-pilot seat. “I’m so pissed at you, Rogers. I have no words just how mad I am that you …” He stopped. “Tony trusts two people in the world. Pepper and I. That’s it. That’s how it’s been since his parents died. He created J.A.R.V.I.S. to have someone around who didn’t want anything from him but him.”
He was jealous as hell and he had no idea how this had happened. It didn’t make sense. Nothing felt like it made sense anymore.
“So, Iron Baby, how about explaining why you ran away?” Rhodey glared at him. Out of the War Machine uniform, he sat in front of Tony with his arms folded across his chest and impaled Tony with his angry eyes. If Tony was wood he'd be ash. Actual charcoal. Dead. Deceased.
“You are completely ridiculous,” Steve told him, rolling over and trapping Tony beneath him. He stared down at Tony’s laughing face and turned his head a little to meet Bucky’s gaze. “Both of you are.”
“Uh-huh,” Bucky said, leaning his head back against the side of the jet and closing his eyes. “I need reassurance.”
“remarkably vigorous lovemaking with my Lady Jane”, it wasn't something that Tony needed to know. Well, not more than he already did.
“There is nothing wrong with my systems, sir. I ran the usual diagnostics this morning,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. assured him.
“I’ll do whatever I have to,” Steve assured him. “Let’s just make sure there’s an ‘after’ to deal with.”
“I am told by the All-Father that it is one of the Titans who seeks to dominate all those who refuse to subjugate themselves to his will,” Thor said.
Tony pushed Bucky’s hand away. “You bust my beautiful arm sparring with god knows who, and got drunk on Asgardian mead with Steve without acquiring photographic evidence. You are so far from being allowed to tell me to do anything. I saved the fucking world!”
“You’ve been working on the armor for the past three days straight, Tony. I actually thought you’d have passed out by now and they’d have been here and gone before you knew it.” Steve had not spent enough time with Tony in that other timeline to understand just how immersed Tony would get in a project. He’d heard Pepper mutter about it, but to experience it first-hand, had been an eye-opener.
The glowing circle of fiery light didn’t move. Steve scooted a little over and peered through at a room on the other side of the circle. It looked like a library. An old one.
“You are the most oblivious dude in the history of history,” Sam told him with a small laugh. “Stark has always thought the sun shines out of your ass.”
“I don’t count here, hon. This is your family. Your choice. I certainly won’t hold it against you if you take the asshole back.”
“Just had a moment,” Tony said, pulling away. For a moment Steve’s arms tightened around him, but then he let him go.
Tony was already pulling a t-shirt on. “Hang on,” he grunted, muffled for a moment as the shirt went over his head. “I’ll trace you using your phone’s GPS.”
Fury’s smirk was especially annoying today. “As if I don’t know every stupid name you’ve come up with, Stark.” He fell into step beside the three of them. “You don’t know what
“Ross gave the order to shoot to kill in Leipzig.” Tony said against his chest. “I asked him for three days. He gave me thirty-six hours.”
“But surely you wish the person who murdered your parents to face the consequences of his decades of atrocities.” T’Challa gave Tony the opening he so desperately needed.
Steve woke up with a start, alert in a heartbeat as only those who had spent time sleeping under fire were able to wake.
“Okay.” Bruce leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “When it comes to multiple worlds or the multiverse, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability.” He looked at them all. Tony made a ‘go on’ gesture. “Now, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different universe. Suppose a six-sided die is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to a quantum mechanics observable. All six possible ways the die can fall correspond to six different universes.”
The clattering of footsteps down the stairs heralded the arrival of the rest of the team, led by Rhodey. “Talk to me, Tony,” he ordered as they came in.
Sam squeezed him a little. “Don’t wait so long between calls, Barton. We like to know that our friends are still alive.”
“Can someone please explain just what the fuck that was?” Dean Winchester’s bellow had them all looking at him. Sam stood at his shoulder, one big hand on his brother’s arm, either keeping him calm or holding him back. Tony wasn’t quite sure which.
“Theoretically,” Bruce said. “But the power source will have to be infinitely bigger than anything we can come up with on Earth.”
I'm getting there, I swear! These boys are playing a long game. Thanks again for all the comments & kudos. It's a blast & I'm loving it.
Thanks so much for all the comments & thoughtful concrit. It really does help me flesh out the story. I love to read every single one of them (even those that make me a little sad).
“Not if he’s off the radar. Tony's an idiot.” Natasha said, tone dire. “I know what happens when he goes off the radar.”
“What news?” Steve asked, impatient and visibly irritated. Tony wondered if it was Loki ogling his boyfriend or Thor being….well, Thor.
Steve stood up, startling Tony. “It sounds like you have things well in hand,” he said, clearly not having a clue.
Thor didn’t look any happier. “I shall bring you a gift from Asgard,” he declared. “As recompense for my lack.”
Tony beamed at him. “I’ve done it.” He looked at Vision. “I need you and Bruce to give it a once-over, but I think we’re good to go.”
Steve felt his shoulders loosen for the first time in weeks. “It’s good to see you, Hawkeye.” He shook Clint’s hand. “I hear you’ve missed the action.”
to change,” Bucky said. “It took Steve almost  dying because of me to kick-start my memories.” He sounded bitter and angry. Tony wasn't going to let him keep blaming himself for actions he had no control over.
Tony kicked his shin. “You. Are a dick.” He wagged a finger at Strange. “I’m telling Professor X on you.”
“Do we have to kill a reaper then?” Natasha asked. “I think Steve is trying to avoid having to kill anyone or anything.” Steve flashed her a grateful smile.
Another sigh. “Oh, I have no doubt that you will.” She hugged him. “But I won't worry the next time.” And that was a total lie. Despite not being together, they were still friends. She would always worry. It was part of the reason they
“My mouth has possibly gotten me into trouble a time or two,” Tony admitted, hobbling towards him. He gave Natasha a wide berth. Collapsing against Steve, he asked, “What did I miss?” Steve obliged by wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
“I thought we were,” Steve said. “But Tony didn’t tell me that Bucky was there with him. He knew how much I wanted to find him.”
Tony whimpered when Bucky pulled back. He was vibrating with need. “Okay, enough messing around, and
Steve’s shoulders drooped even more. Tony thought he was going to end up looking like Eeyore if they dropped any lower. “If you, and Bruce, and Thor can’t come up with anything, what kind of plan could I make?” he asked.
Thor shook his head. “There is a reason Loki is called the Trickster, Captain. He is the very best of us all at illusion.”
“He’s being Tony,” Bucky shrugged. “If Steve’s worried though, then maybe you should get him to the doc just in case.”
“You told him you wanted him to give me back,” Coulson said in his dry as dust voice, making jazz hands. “Ta-da.”
Tony kept his eyes on Strange. He moved closer, around Clint and Steve. They were too busy prodding at Loki to notice. “It’s a mathematical formula,” he said, sitting on the coffee table in front of Strange.
Agent Coulson cleared his throat, and Tony realized that Steve had abandoned his protective stance and was standing beside him again. “Mr. Stark,” Agent Coulson began, “We are not the DOD, FBI, CIA or any other agency. We’re a separate division with a more...specific focus. We need to debrief you…”
“Not always,” Pepper said. “He was apparently a scrawny kid who only bulked up once he started with football.”
so I've seen several of you asking about Dean & Baby. That will be resolved. Promise. Never fear. I have reasons.
“They don’t advertise it.” Natasha shrugged, producing a knife from somewhere on her person and using it to clean her nails. Tony shuddered,
“Huh,” Tony said, sitting down on the bed to pull on socks. “How come I didn’t know that?” He thought about sending Pepper a betrayed glare but decided that living was preferable.
“I am my own man,” Tony insisted, body melting into the soft leather. “Oh my god, I am going to sleep for a week.”
Tony snort-laughed. “A, she’s not my lady anymore and B, she would eviscerate you if she heard you.”
“Uh...Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home?” Tony’s little brain bee buzzed a tiny bit louder. “This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really
“Just how are you communicating with him?” Natasha demanded, still not entirely happy with Wanda after everything that had happened.
He wasn't going to look. He was a rock. An island. A bastio....Fuck. Apparently his dignity was at the bottom of a vodka bottle. Tony leapt to his feet and went to where the other three were peering out at the garden.
“I’m not used to you being this chatty,” Steve said, mouth curving into a sly smile. “I’m happy to see you, Tony.”
“How many times must I remind you boys that we are, in fact, in Hell?” Crowley asked, gaze dispassionately going around the room. “This isn’t Happy Hippo’s Holiday Camp.”
“My Jane is a great lover of the romantic comedy movie genre,” Thor said. “I have spent many a night enjoying the company of Bridget Jones, Anna Scott and…”
Tony breathed a sigh of relief as he followed them to the balcony. Wanda and Vision stood on either side of Thor, their hands on his shoulders.
“I hate you all.” Clint’s voice had Tony turning around. He hadn’t noticed him perched on the counter in the corner, curled around a large cup of coffee.
“Nice try, asswipe,” Tony growled at Lucifer. “I hope you like your prison, ‘cause you won’t be seeing anything else for a good long while.”
“Jörmungandr has begun to eat the sky and Ragnarök is upon Asgard.” Loki’s monotone didn’t hide the panic in his face.
Steve folded his arms, staring at him. “What was I doing at a courthouse?” he asked and Tony could practically hear the ‘I’m only humoring him’ tone in his voice.
“We bid you farewell until we meet once more,” Thor said, clasping Tony’s arm and practically crushing his hand.
“She was in danger. She’d broken the Accords and needed to be safe.” Tony sounded more than a little defensive now.
“Why didn’t you call me sooner?” Steve yelled as he spotted Tony on the ground. Bucky was like his shadow as they skidded on the tiles to reach him.
Even Steve could tell that was a bunch of crap. Before Tony could blast Scott, Bruce stepped in. “So, just to be clear, you want to pull off a… What do you call it?”
Steve nodded. “Yeah, just like that.” Tony saw Steve and Carol share a knowing look. Superpowers sometimes made people extremely annoying.
Bucky shook his head. “Something happened just as you got here,” he tapped his head. “Tony said something, he finished our catchphrase.” He looked up at Steve. “The one you said to me on the Helicarrier when you were trying to make me remember.”
“You’re idiots.” Rhodey’s blunt words had them staring at him. “Soldiers follow orders. There’s a chain of command. Steve Rogers was never the head of that command.”
“Now what?” Clint asked. He rummaged through the case, packing out item after item including a pair of glasses that looked like something out of one of Bruce’s god-awful James Bond films. He passed the laptop on to Natasha who promptly set it down on the dining table they’d been given to use.
Steve was startled. “You’ve always been Tony to me,” he insisted. “This life or the other, you’re the one I love, the one I can’t and won’t live without.”
Tony whistled. “Now that’s some pent-up anger you’ve got there, buddy.” He patted the chair next to his. “Take a load off.”
They all looked at Steve. “So I guess it’s my turn, huh?” he said, mouth twisting. Tony saw Bucky reach out, put his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeeze. It shouldn’t have made him angry, but some tiny, petty, jealous part of him was furious.
“I try.” She waited for the nurse to finish taking blood. “Can I take this idiot home now?” she asked. “If you don’t say yes, he’s going to leave anyway.”
Steve stared at Natasha. “You know where...?” He couldn't believe she'd known all this time where Bruce was and hadn't shared it with them.
Rhodey’s faceplate slid back. “Somebody better tell me something or I start raining pain down on your asses.” He didn’t sound like he was kidding.
“What?” This had better not be about his fucking panic attack, Tony thought viciously. “You guys will need me for this.”
“She’s gone, Tony. She’s gone.” The simple phrase was devastating to them. They’d known Laura, loved her as one of their own. The Barton home had been the one safe place they’d managed to find in the midst of all the Ultron chaos.
Tony took a longing look at his screen as Bucky and Steve towed him out of the lab. “I just want to….”
Tony folded his arms. “Are you chickening out on me, J?” He glared. “I’m a certified genius with an infinite capacity for awesome. What could possibly go wrong?”
“I will make amends if I can.” Wanda stared down at her hands, at the tendrils of crimson mist that seemed to seep out of her pores. “When we find him, I will help him see that even if he is a monster, he is still in control.”
“That is still going to come back and bite us in the ass,” Bruce said as he pressed the elevator button.
“I’ll try to do better,” Tony assured her. He remembered why he was here. “How do I deploy the formula without a computer?”
“Are we all perfectly sure that dude is on the level?” Clint asked the question that Steve desperately needed to feel sure about.
“What did you see?” Thor’s question was a gentle one. “You were the only one she ensorcelled then. The rest of us only had our visions in Wakanda.”
was a mental image he hadn’t needed in his brain. It appeared as though a comfortable Steve was a smart-alecky Steve. Tony was beyond turned-on.
Thor returned with news of Thanos. “I used Stormbreaker to cut off his head!” He boomed, following the announcement with a graphic sound. Everyone winced.
Steve thought that Rhodey gave in too quickly. He almost bit his tongue trying not to say anything more.
Tony cackled. “Whatever makes you sleep at night, baby.” Bruce just rolled his eyes. He sobered up. “What made you think that I wouldn’t understand about Barnes?” He sounded curious now. “When, in all of our years of working together, did I make you believe that I was an unreasonable man?”
“It is not natural for a parent to outlive his child.” Vision lifted his hand, touching Tony’s cheek. “You’ve never treated me as anything other than human.” He pulled back, the shining liquid on his hand making Tony aware of the tears running down his cheek. “I have learned about love from you, creator, friend, Father.”
Bucky’s eyes narrowed, as though tracking just how far out of reach Tony was. It made Steve’s face heat up even though he wasn’t sure why. Yet another thing to think about later.
Vision was as serene as ever, completely at ease wherever he chose to be. Tony refused to think about where he slept. Or
Coulson nodded. “I’m not going to ask,” he said. “It’s better that I don’t know.” He looked at Tony carefully. “Who else knows?”
However, as with everything, Thor did whatever the hell Thor wanted. “Only beings of immense power can wield the stones. It is why my Jane almost died when exposed to the Aether.”
“I’m not going anywhere.” Steve walked to the nearest door. “I’m going to do whatever I have to do to make Tony my friend again.” He pushed it open and felt a sigh escape him. He’d never been here, but at that moment, he felt like he’d come home.
“Tony said something to me once.” Steve met Bucky's gaze. “He was held prisoner for a while, tortured, came out the other side as Iron Man.”
Natasha shrugged in that inscrutable way that drove Steve nuts. “If Thor was the last of his kind then it would be of no matter.” She tipped her head to the side, looking at a visibly uncomfortable Thor. “Your hammer is your totem.” It wasn’t a question.
Bucky got to his feet, moving like a lazy tiger, all leashed strength and rippling muscle. “Enjoying the show,” he drawled, leaning down to press a kiss to Steve’s mouth. “Looks like my lessons have paid off, babe.”
Derek gave a snort of laughter, looking away as Rhodey whined, “Why do you always have to make it weird?”
“I had to make sure first,” Bruce defended. “It was pointless to talk about it until I could confirm it.”
“It was just a little note that I slipped into Vision’s bag of tricks,” Tony hurried to explain. “I asked him to keep an eye on us and to pull us out if things got….hairy.”
Natasha raised one shoulder in a shrug. “Don’t care.” She turned to where Clint and Thor were still struggling to hold the animal. “Just let me kill it,” she said, pulling out her truly terrifying knife. “That’ll stop the blood-letting.”
Tony nodded, heading for the bar. “Too classy for me.” He tossed back a shot of whiskey and poured another before heading back to the living room area.
Bucky reached up and tugged at Steve’s underwear, pulling it down to the floor and letting Steve’s cock practically smack him in the face. The precome gathered at the tip smeared across Bucky’s cheek. Tony licked his lips in anticipation.
Steve moved to stand next to him, reading what Clint had been jotting down. “That makes absolutely no sense,” he said.
“I’m not entirely sure,” Loki admitted. “The child was taken from me by its mother. I have no real knowledge of what is it capable of.”
Tony stomped into the shower, muttering under his breath about super soldiers and their lack of respect. He stepped beneath the waterfall of water, turned to the perfect temperature a moment later. “I’m breaking up with both of you!” he yelled over the water.
“We still have our rooms there?” Clint grinned. “Sweet.” He looked at Steve. “Not that I’m not deliriously happy to be back with the team, Cap, but my suite at Avengers Tower is literally home away from home.”
a ship,” Tony corrected him. “Short for ‘relationship’.” Sue him, he loved the internet. Any stories, especially those about him were of supreme interest.
Steve obediently moved close enough for Tony to snag his waistband and pull him in for a kiss. “What was so important that you had to leave me to wake up alone?” He put a deliberate whine in his voice that had Tony grinning.
“I’d support Steve, no matter what the politicians wanted.” He knew he was sleeping now. Knew that he was talking to someone while he was sleeping.
“And then we’re going to have to figure out how to stop whoever it is that’s hunting for the Infinity Stones,” Steve said.
“Tony.” Steve frowned at him. “You know Doctor Strange the best out of all of us, it has to be you.”
Tony nudged him back. “Well, of course you have to be the mature one in this relationship,” he said with a smirk. “You are almost a hundred years old after all.”
Suddenly Steve could move again and he jerked forward, grabbing onto Tony. “You don’t have to do this alone,” he said, keeping his voice low.
“General Ross has something like that tattooed on his arm,” Bruce said, face troubled. “I remember it from when Betty and I were together. I can’t think that this is good.”
“The time for talking was when Tony came to you in Siberia,” Rhodey said. “You left him there knowing that the suit was broken.”
“Use him?” Steve walked in, Bucky at his side. “I don’t like the sound of that.” He glared at the crown in suspicion.
Bucky nodded, his gaze considering as he stared down at Tony. “When the fear gets too much, I try to find a way to release it,” he said, apropos of nothing.
“Everyone understood your grief, Tony.” Thor dropped a big hand on his shoulder. “We all grieve in our own way.”
“Oh it most definitely did!”  Tony was indignant. “That piece of Hydra crap had to go with the wind.”
Natasha swallowed her next words, looking as though it physically hurt her. She walked to Wanda and dropped into the seat beside her. Wanda’s slender hand covered hers, ruby swirls wrapping around Natasha’s wrist in a snake of comfort.
“I believe that the world is about to change,” Xavier said, wheeling to the front door where an impassive doorman stood. Tony and Richards followed his lead. “And not for the better.”
Something moved behind Wanda’s eyes, something dark and angry. “I did what I did to all of you,” she said, tone flat. “I showed him his greatest fear.”
Tony scowled. “That isn’t the first time that dick has done this.” He propped his hands on his hips. “I’m fucking banning Mjolnir forever.”
Irrefutable logic, however, wasn’t high on Tony’s list today. “He can’t make me leave.” Tony focused on the intricate welding he was attempting while his brain was in freak-out mode.
“And most unlike you, Captain,” Vision said. “Many of your actions since discovering that your old friend was alive have been counter to the person I have come to know.”
Vision was nowhere to be seen. His usual companion, Wanda, was curled up in a large recliner with a book. Her eyes were closed.
“Shut the fuck up and run,” Steve growled. Something in his face must have made Loki rethink his position because he picked up the pace at once.
Crowley came up beside him. “I don’t like to brag, but…” His smug little smirk made Tony want to rip him apart at atomic level.
Coulson stood beside Clint, leaning a little against his legs. Tony watched as Clint subconsciously adjusted his position, taking a little more weight. He was happy to see that some things were progressing as they should.
Clint kept his gaze on the horizon. “T minus five to landing, Cap.” The Quinjet banked and began descending.
Tony sighed. “The correct answer is: “The same thing we do every day, Pinky. Try to take over the world”.” He was tempted to bang his head on the nearest hard surface.
“Perhaps she would understand if we told her of its evil?” Thor sounded doubtful. Tony resolutely refused to think of him as a golden retriever, thanks Bucky, you asshole.
Tony finally managed to push away from Bucky, giving him a firm look. “We’re going to have a little chat about that later, Buckeroo.” He flapped a hand between them.
“Sorry, big guy.” Tony patted his shoulder. “I get confused with all these Norse legends.” His eyes were glittering. Steve thought the combination of laughter and manic excitement was slightly terrifying.
“No,” Steve protested. “It wasn’t. It isn’t. Tony, you gave us a home, a refuge, a place where we could just be ourselves without putting on our public faces. You gave us a family.
“When Steve died.” Bucky’s low answer had Tony turning to him. “Since he died, it feels like it’s all falling apart.”
“I’m not sure exactly,” Bucky admitted. “Tony made me take a bunch of them over time while he was working on my arm.”
Tony staggered back, hand coming up to grab at his chest. “Not cool,” he wheezed. “Fucking uncalled for. I never built you to be able to lie.” He took several quick breaths, trying to get his heart rate back to normal.
Barnes met his gaze squarely. Tony admired that courage. He sort of understood why Steve loved Barnes so much. “I remember all of them.”
Tony wondered just how much he should tell them. “I first got wind of the SRA thanks to some old school buddies who are part of the wheels of the Congress machine,” he began. “With the whole world knowing that I’m Iron Man and the shitstorm that resulted from Ultron, they’ve tried to keep me posted with what’s going on.”
,” Tony repeated. He closed his eyes, trying to get his brain to shut up. Steve was on his way here. Along with the man who had murdered his parents. And the friends who’d betrayed him.
I am still trying to wrap my brain around the surreal news that David Bowie has returned to his home planet. From Loving the Alien to As the World Falls Down, he was the single most important musical influence in my life. #RIPThinWhiteDuke
Steve knew it was the guilt that ate at him. That Tony blamed himself for every death his weapons had caused. Wanda watched him warily, eyes narrowed as she tried to figure him out.
“Probably at least a day,” Bruce answered for them. Tony glared at the back of Bruce's head, willing his hair to catch fire. Then he remembered that if that happened then the Hulk was likely to show up, and that would be the end of his precious, precious lab.
Silence again and then, “Guess it’s Rogers then. Barnes is fine.” Tony’s reply was as flat as Natasha’s had been.
“Don’t ask,” Bruce begged when Steve looked over at him. “There were things seen that can never be unseen.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You and Potts are quite the team, aren’t you?” He stopped as he saw Rhodey’s dark skin go a little darker. “Wait a minute. What? Seriously? You’re hooking up with my ex?” He glared at Rhodey. “Way to break the bro code, asshole.”
“Magic isn’t mathematics, Tony Stark.” Strange gestured for him to take his hand again. “Now come, let us get this done.”
Tony put up a hand. “While this is all very fascinating - and Wanda, you and I are going to have a long chat later about the special sort of crazy that you saw in his brain – can we please get back to the matter at hand?”
“Jeez, I step outside for some fresh air and come back to a threesome.” Clint’s laconic drawl had Tony smiling.
Tony let the armor fold away into the suit-case sized...suitcase he normally carried around. “Not that this little reunion isn't faboo, but I really need to talk to the
“Unresolved Sexual Tension,” Tony explained with a flap of his hand. “I was literally drowning in pheromones.”
“Yeah,” Bruce said with a quiet grin. “That’s not going to happen.” He met Steve’s gaze. “The Other Guy would probably have something to say about that.”
Bruce rolled his eyes and put his phone on speaker. “This is sort of pathetic, you know,” he observed. “The protectors of the free world squabbling like children.” He frowned at Tonysuddenly. “Hey! I thought
“He’s all romance,” Tony agreed as Steve leaned over his shoulder to kiss Bucky. Steve tasted lube and sweat and something that he knew was uniquely Tony. He shouldn’t be so turned on by it. The era he’d grown up in wouldn’t have understood whatever this was between them. He wasn’t entirely sure himself, but he wanted it.
“Harm. Yeah, I got that,” Tony said, frowning at Strange. “How does it know he’s telling the truth?”
“There’s a note,” Tony said, without looking away from whatever was in that box. He picked up the thick piece of parchment. “From Odin.”
Steve nudged his shoulder. “So are you, Tasha, Bruce, even Clint.” He smiled ruefully. “I forgot that when I stopped listening to Tony.”
“I seem to remember something about Jörmungandr being a snake that poisons the sky,” Natasha said. She met Loki’s gaze. “And a prophecy about it killing Odin, Frigga, Loki….”
She just looked at him. “There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.” Amend that, Tony thought. He fucking
That smile widened. “Only a bit? I’m losing my touch.” Steve tugged Tony closer so that their bodies met. “Now, where were we?” Then he kissed him.
Bucky crawled onto the bed, flopping down on top of Tony. “That’s okay, babe, I’m sure Steve and I can amuse ourselves while your old bones recover.”
“Whatever extra juice was added to Extremis healed him completely,” Tony said with a grin. “He actually, literally kicked my ass.” He glared at the cape. “Stop that.”
Steve went from asleep to wide awake in less than a second. From the tension in Bucky's body, he'd woken up as well.
Vision opened his mouth to object. “I think he’s right.” Tony nodded. “You’re not always going to be the last word in science, V.”
“Would you like me to let Captain Rogers know that you're in Kabara?” Vision asked. He didn't even try to pretend that he hadn't been colluding with his AI behind Tony's back.
Just then, a noise made them all look to where Bruce’s pants were buzzing. “You’re vibrating,” Tony noted.
“She was worried about you,” Steve told him. “And listening to how shaky you sound, I’m worried too.”
“How the fuck…?” Tony was genuinely flummoxed. “You’ve been gone for years, and yet you waltz back in here and are already a pain in my ass.”
Bucky was a sneaky fucker, Tony thought with reluctant admiration. Steve went bright red and Clint practically hacked up a lung he was laughing so hard. “They are brothers.” It was Tony’s only defense.
Tony held up a hand. “I’m totally not interested in apologies. Just so that you know, the chain of command is that you all answer to me for the foreseeable future. If you don’t sign the revised Accords, you’re grounded. If you do, then we can talk about missions.” He waited for Steve’s nod before turning his face away.
Natasha got up and put a hand on Bruce’s shoulder. “Deep breaths, sugar.” He turned to look at her, visibly fighting the transformation. “Do we need a lullaby?”
“Apparently the farm was compromised so Laura took the kids to the safest place she could think of.” Clint’s mouth twisted.
They were both breathing heavily when Steve pulled back, climbing off the bed again. Tony would deny his protesting whimper to his dying day.
Dean made a high noise that practically burst Tony’s eardrums. Only Sam’s hand on Dean’s shoulder prevented him from lunging at Coulson.
Clint muttered something dire around a mouthful of scrambled eggs. Natasha’s eyes narrowed. “What was that, Barton?”
Tony sighed. “Nobody regrets what happened more than Bruce.” He met Ross’ gaze, saw the anguish of a father who wanted to avenge his child. “He would never have hurt her. And she would never have wanted you to hurt him.”
The traitor moved away from Tony's existential crisis and went to sit next to Sam. Tony was revoking the best friend privileges forever. War Machine would
“No.” Tony put a hand on Rhodey’s shoulder. “The time for talking was when you found out that the Winter Soldier killed my parents. We could have cleared the air then. You think I don’t know what a fucked-up life Barnes had?” He pointed at Barnes. “Why the fuck do you think I sent the technology to you to help him?”
“When I’m dead, you can call the morgue,” Tony said, flinching as the shower water starting turning to tiny, evil, freezing cold stabby things.
get us up into space, but we have no idea where this Collector guy is, and so I'm thinking this is one of those needle in a haystack things and...” He paused. “Thor, Loki, a little help?”
“And you’re lying through your pearly whites,” Tony said. “But because I’m not the trusting sort like Cap and your brother, I’m going to ask you to make me a promise.”
“Ah baby, I know how much you love me,” Rhodey crooned. He released Tony with a grin. “How come Bruce is the one who called me and told me that you were here?” The armor rolled off as he stepped along the platform. F.R.I.D.A.Y. handled War Machine as efficiently as she handled Iron Man.
“I have no idea what these two see in you.” Sam stalked past them, shooting Bucky a glare. “I’m seriously counted after a fucking robot?”
“Indeed he did, Sir. And something that I have observed about the Captain over the years he has been in residence here at the Tower, he does nothing without purpose.” JARVIS knew exactly how to deliver that one-two punch to the gut that rendered Tony defenseless.
Tony shook his head. “He’s not come up for air since Bruce outed his crimes. I’ve got F.R.I.D.A.Y. keeping an eye on all channels to be ready for when he pops up again. And he will.”
“Oh for…” Natasha huffed impatiently. “I’m not some wilting flower who’s going to get the vapors if you mention the one who got away.” She propped her hands on her hips. “Get over yourselves.”
Tony sucked in a breath, trying to keep calm. “Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.” They all watched as Captain America’s shield and Wilson’s wings were carted away.
“Am I okay?” Tony’s voice was so shrill that he was sure the bats at Carlsbad Caverns were responding to the sonic flailing. “I’m dying, you asshole. There is nothing okay about me.”
Tony felt his knees wobble. He sat down abruptly. “General Thaddeus Ross?” he asked, wanting to ensure he wasn’t freaking out unnecessarily.
Steve couldn’t bear it any longer. He put the case on the large coffee table and almost wept when his old code from the tower worked to snap it open.
“He just opened up a portal and walked through,” Rhodes said, pointing back to where Thor had been screaming.
Tony felt suddenly very sorry for Steve, and he put his hand over the hand Bucky had pressed to his chest. “He doesn’t understand.” Bucky turned to look at Tony. “He’s been free all his life, Bucky. He doesn’t understand.” Even after all of the things they’d seen, the things he’d done, Steve was still to all intents and purposes, innocent.
“Are you kidding? With Thaddeus Ross the mastermind behind it, there was always a hidden agenda.” Bruce took off his glasses, cleaned them absently with the bottom of his shirt. “But then Tony sent me the revisions, the proof he had of what Ross planned to do. I couldn’t stay out of it then. He was out there, facing them on his own.”
“Steve wants you.” Bucky’s blue eyes were very clear, very sure. “He never thought he’d get the chance to have you though.”
“Don’t care,” Tony said, giving Bucky just the slightest of head-tilts. “Hook your fingers onto my belt, close those pretty blue eyes, and let’s get through this as fast as we can.” He met Steve’s gaze. “This
Tony felt cold. The bone-shuddering chill of the cave seeped through his body. “I wish I hadn’t seen it,” he said, turning to look at her, suddenly furious. “You showed me a future that’s impossible. Now I’ll spend the rest of my life hoping for something that will never be real.”
“Why do we have to go there?” Tony couldn’t look away. He was barely aware of Bucky’s hand dropping on his shoulder.
“Dollar for your thoughts?” Tony’s voice broke into the silence, startling Steve so that he almost fell out of the hammock.
“No.” Steve tried to glare at Bucky, but he was just too damn happy to even pretend. “I’m counting on you to stay safe. Which is why I want Bruce to get those tiny machine thingys out of your thick skull.” And the conversation circled back around.
“The fact that you just used the word ‘cool’ in a sentence to describe your coolness tells me you know shit,” Bucky drawled.
Tony was abruptly more hopeful about what was to follow. Then he saw that Bucky was still fully dressed. “You made me naked and you're not naked.”
“I’m sorry, Steve.” Tony rubbed his eyes. “I wanted to call you the moment he arrived, but he was just…”
“People hate what they don’t understand,” Clint told him, and it sounded so much like what Charles had said earlier that Tony shut up.
“Stop thinking.” Bucky lifted his head, looking down at him. He was beyond gorgeous, Tony thought dazedly. Dark hair hanging over his face, playing some sort of sexy peekaboo with those stupid eyes.
“She was very careful not to let her skin come into contact with it,” Thor said, still holding Tony’s arm.
“Don’t be an ass, Steve. You’re better than this, than him.” Pepper stared at the group in training. “He’s your friend, not just Iron Man. Tony needs a friend right now.” Her mouth turned down. “And I can’t be that friend just yet.”
“I’m starting to think that maybe Bucky is right,” Steve said, pulling Tony to his feet. “You sure you didn’t get concussed after the fight with the Hulk?” His eyes were concerned as he peered into Tony’s face.
Steve stared at their hands, content to feel the reassurance of life beneath Tony’s skin. “She talked to you?” he asked.
“Oh hell no!” Wilson said. “If that thing has the ability to affect us then we need to make it go bye-bye right now.”
Tony threw an arm across Bruce’s shoulder. “The god-boys are back,” he told him. “Here’s hoping that we’ve caught a break.”
“That makes no sense,” Natasha observed, but Steve could see the little curve of her lips that was practically a Romanoff smile.
“Mr. Stark has left the building, Captain Rogers.” F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s tone was decidedly chillier than with Bucky. Tony built the
Loki shook his head. “We needed the Infinity Stone. I need to atone. The Collector had a price. It is done.”
Tony shook his head. “No, if this all goes pear-shaped, Earth won’t even know what’s hit it. Instant Extinction Event.” It made Steve feel ill just hearing it stated out loud.
“Right.” Bucky drooped next to him. They clinked their mugs together. They were united in their misery. It was like a switch had flipped and suddenly Tony was seeing the person Bucky had once been. To say that he was fascinated would have been an understatement.
“No.” Tony shook his head. “Just the time travel. The ‘how’ seemed a step too far into the woo-woo crazy. Although I
Fuck. Tony liked him. This had disaster of Hulk proportions written all over it. “You owe me nothing,” he said, dropping all his walls. This guy deserved more. Tony wanted to
“Okay.” Barnes took a breath. Tony released his, not realizing how tense he was. “How do we do this?”
“Why didn’t he ask me?” Natasha’s eyes were narrowed. “Steve and I are way more aware of politics than you are. And so is Rhodes.” She shook her head. “What aren’t you telling us?”
Tony rubbed his eyes. “Two years,” he mumbled. Bruce was the sneakiest motherfucker in the universe. And don’t let anyone tell you differently.
“I’ll leave some water and painkillers on your nightstand,” Pepper offered. “We’ll be in the living room.”
“Fuck yes,” Tony said, rolling out from under him and hopping to his feet. He held out his hand. “Come play with me, Cap.”
“I’d be delighted, Shellhead.” Steve took his hand and got up, mouth red and slightly swollen. It was
Tony had grown used to betrayal. His father, Obadiah, Stone, Hammer, god, the list was endless. But there was something about Steve that had broken Tony in a way that he hadn’t been able to fully recover from.
If anything, Thor's smile went brighter. “Ah, you wish for your beloved to remain anonymous.” He nodded once. “I can understand our Captain's reluctance for us to know that he is planning to engage in sexual activities with a team-mate.”
“I am the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth.” Strange’s mouth curled in a tiny smirk. “I have powers beyond those of mortal men.”
Steve stopped, mid-punch, and looked at her. “Thank you, Ayo. Where is the guest?” He tried to stay on their good side because they were as fearless and almost as fearsome as their king. He’d learned some devastatingly effective new  fighting techniques from the Dora Milaje.
“Natasha, Clint and Sam?” Steve pulled on one of Tony’s t-shirts. It was a snug fit but he wasn’t in the mood to waste time going to his rooms.
Still trying to be voice of reason, Natasha said, “Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.” And she was right. Even though the thought of what he was going to have to do made Tony want to throw up.
She kept the gun on him as she walked over to a computer console. “What are you doing?” Councilman Rockwell demanded.
Natasha screamed and screamed, her voice going hoarse in terror. Sam and Scott were on the ground, writhing and crying, blood streaming from their noses and ears as the pressure burst in the jet.  Steve couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move.
“This is going to be so much fun,” Clint muttered as he followed Bruce into the room. Laura wasn’t far behind.
“Well, Tones, I see you haven’t lost your touch with the ladies.” Rhodey’s drawl had Tony bark a startled laugh.
Steve shook his head. “I was afraid that I’d lose Tony too.” His confession was a muted thing, an acknowledgement of something that he hadn’t yet put a name to.
Steve was ravenous. He and Bucky had headed up to the kitchen on strict instructions to eat and leave Tony with his toys. They had both been reluctant to let him out of their sight.
“Tony…” Bruce sighed. “I’m sure Steve just likes to wind you up because you get so nuts when he calls you on your crap.” Tony opened his mouth to protest. “You do the exact same thing,” Bruce continued.
“They are in Mr. Stark’s laboratory, Captain Rogers.” Tony’s AI was either a mind-reader or he was really obvious in his panic.
Steve thought maybe Thor had a point. If humanity had known, or even suspected, what was coming, things might have turned out differently.
“I can’t keep letting this go,” Steve said. “We need to talk. We need to get past this. I need to ask him to forgive me.”
“You okay?” Steve asked softly. Tony nodded into his shoulder. Bucky ran a comforting hand down Tony’s back. It was still surreal that they were this, that they could
“I thought Hogan was your bodyguard,” Stane said, taking a step to the side. His annoyance was even more visible when Steve just moved in front of him again. He didn’t notice that he was suddenly flanked by two police officers.
“I shall contact Heimdall. Perhaps he can attempt to open the Bifröst,” Thor said. The look he gave Loki was concerned. “I would ask you to come with me, brother. We should learn of the fate of our home together.”
“Good luck with that,” Tony snarled back. “I’ve got the Winchesters in my corner. You’re not going to win this one.”
Steve flushed. “I don’t hover.” As arguments went, it wasn’t his strongest. He slumped into the chair in front of her desk. “He needs constant supervision.”
Jim nodded, still staring down at the arm. “I dream about them wiping my mind again,” he said, so softly that Tony barely heard him. “They would put a piece of leather in my mouth and strap me down and take everything away.”
A short pause and then, “I regret to say no, Captain Rogers. Mr. Barnes has been exposed to far too much gamma radiation as it is. Any more would risk his life.”
Tony perched on the armrest of the chair Steve was sitting on. “I’m a genius,” he announced to the room.
“If I see a situation pointed south… I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.” He didn’t even look vaguely apologetic.
Tony waved a hand towards the now arguing gods. “I can’t,” he wheezed. “It’s like the real life version of ‘Who’s Line is it Anyway?’. It’s fucking awesome.”
Steve held onto his hand for a little longer. “Thank you for risking everything to help us. It might not have turned out the way we planned but at least we made it out alive.”
“You won’t be alone,” Tony said to him. He turned his head to meet Bucky’s eyes. “You’ll have each other and that’s what will get you through whatever happens.”
Finally done - a million apologies for the wait but the plot bunnies have been nibbling at my brain & I have about 3 new stories plotted out clamoring for attention.
“Indeed, Mr. Stark. I need to get new shoes. You know me so well.” She patted his cheek and pointed at the rest of the team. “I’ll be back. And there will be talking. Don’t take advantage of Tony’s nature. He loves you all and this has been incredibly difficult for him. Do
“Shut the fuck up, Stark, and let the man apologize.” Rhodey leveled a “Colonel Rhodes” look at him.
Tony wobbled when Fury retorted, “Oh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?” Tony cackled like a crazy person and, then refocused on the task at hand.
“So, anyone want to know what happened?” he asked as he went about detangling them. It was clear that neither of them intended on letting him go anytime soon. And Tony was totally on board with that.
He nodded, following them out of the lab. “I’m guessing that the three amigos have already crashed out,” he said, speaking about the unholy trio of Sam, Clint and Rhodey.
The workshop door swished open again. “I’m sorry, I will never go anywhere ever again without telling you,” he intoned without turning around. “That was fast.”
devoid of humor surely? “Okay then.” A second later they were levitating off the cliff, dropping slowly down towards the gash in the ground. “That is remarkably cool.” He squinted, trying to see what apparatus allowed Strange to fly. He gave up. “Okay. How are you doing it?” he demanded.
Sam crouched down in front of them, staring at Clint. “Why didn’t you call me?” he asked. “Why didn’t you tell us?” His eyes were multi-colored. Every angle of light seemed to bring out another color. Tony was a little bit fascinated.
She reached out her hands and he grabbed onto them without hesitation. “We'll work something out,” she assured him. “Together.”
Rhodey handed Tony over to Bruce and Vision. “Take him. Keep him away from the rest of us until you’ve figured out what to do.”
“Nope!” Tony skipped away from his reach. “I don’t. I hate you with the fire of a thousand su…mmmf.”
“Make the first move?” Steve suggested. “Don’t give him the chance to take another step closer to us.”
“Because it’s the only way to keep you all out of prison for the rest of your life.” Coulson’s words had the impact of a bomb.
“Tony…” Steve held out a hand. Tony twitched away. He didn’t allow the sorrow crossing Steve’s face to touch him.
Tony was sure that he was hearing things. Had Steve Rogers, Captain Tightass himself, just come out and told him that he wanted to be Tony’s boyfriend?
“I don’t even want to know how you knew we were going to be here,” Clint said, shaking his head. “You bring the jet?”
The betrayed expression on Clint’s face was priceless. They were all laughing their asses off then, even as the bride and Steve headed towards them.
“No it wasn’t,” Pepper countered. “You only drank yourself into a stupor for a week. That’s barely a heart-bruise for you.” She looked like she wanted to laugh. He needed new friends.
“I’m a selfish man,” Tony said. “I’m used to getting my way in almost everything.” His arms tightened around Bucky. Steve lifted a hand to cover Tony’s. “I know you, James Barnes. I know you because you let me in.” His smile was a trembling thing. “Everything that has been done to you hasn’t changed the core of who you are.”
Bucky’s gaze met his. “Next time, I get to watch,” he gritted, plunging once more as Tony shouted his release. The come that hit Steve in the face took him by surprise but he stayed where he lay, fingers tight around Tony’s and heart full for the first time since he’d woken up in this wild new world.
“What about him?” Bucky jutted his jaw in Bruce’s direction. “I thought you went to find him so that he could help me.”
Tony knew they were being manipulated, but even the smallest chance of the Other Guy showing up ensured his cooperation.
“You and me both, Stark,” Bucky muttered, putting him down onto the toilet seat and propping him between the wall and the bog roll. “Stay,” he ordered.
“I can’t keep apologizing for that, Natasha.” Tony rubbed at his eyes. “I made a colossal mistake, I fucked up, but then I tried to fix it.”
A visitor makes Wakanda seem further from home than ever. The UN General Assembly have some things to discuss with Tony. There are some things that Tony will not budge on.
She narrowed her eyes. “You’ve no idea how long we’ve been together, Tony. You’ve not remembered our anniversary once.”
stupid. Bucky wasn’t his only friend, his only family. The people in this house were all part of his heart and he’d managed to break several of them.
Steve frowned at him. Thor was a pretty happy-go-lucky guy despite the fact that his entire race had been destroyed by the Wraith. As long as he had enemies to kill, food to eat and booze to drink, Thor had no issues.
The air exploded as Thor, Wanda and Vision slid down the dazzling column of the Bifröst, landing on the large balcony Thor was swinging Mjolnir almost the moment he landed.
Tony waved a hand. “Oh, I’m not mad at you for rushing to my bedside to hear my dying wishes,” he said, grinning a little at their scowls. “Just wondering where the errant sheep are now.” He didn’t
“I was supposed to still be in the cryo-chamber,” Bucky said. “When Wanda flipped her shit she shorted out the unit and I woke up.”
Steve carefully picked Bucky up in his arms, cradling him like the precious cargo he was. “Thanks Bruce.”
“I should call Clint,” Natasha said and Steve could see the panic flash across those normally calm eyes.
Bucky sucked a hickey on his thigh. “I hope you don’t think that this is how it’s always going to go?” he asked. “We’re equal opportunity fuckers and fuckees.”
When they’d finally collected themselves, Steve called them to order. “What did your father say?” he asked Thor.
“Captain Rogers, Colonel Rhodes, whatever is going on, I’m just letting you know, that guy in there is afraid.” The President submitted to the blood pressure monitor as he sat down.
“I came to find you.” Tony knew that was kind of obvious. “And I did. Tah-da!” He was extra-ordinarily proud of his success.
“I know you.” The words were simple and devastating. Steve stared into Tony’s eyes, seeing his reflection there.
Bruce fell back onto the coffee table, howling with laughter. “Stop!” he begged. “I can’t anymore.” Tears ran down his cheeks.
Sam handed the notebook back. “Tony asked me to spend some time with Barnes.” The words were casual, but his eyes were anything but.
“Brucie-bear, Brucie-baby, Bruce my goose, Bruce the boss!” he sang as he danced over to his brother from another mother. Or another science experiment gone wrong. He shrugged, grabbing him in a hug, squeezing so hard that Bruce’s glasses skewed across his face. “What brings you here?”
He took a breath and forced the doors open. Steve crouched on the stairs, shield in front of him, Barnes at his shoulder, rifle pointed straight at him.
“It’s very good to see you again.” J.A.R.V.I.S. said, that slightly soft smile in his voice that had always reminded Tony of the one person in his life who had loved him without reservations.
“Bucky?” He wasn't sure he wanted to continue with this. He had a feeling that things were going to go badly.
Bucky made a scoffing sound. “Seriously, we all know that it’s the old guy who’s trying to get it up over here who’s the menace.” He gave a yelp when Tony grabbed his hair and yanked. “Oh, kinky,” he purred a moment later.
“Sorry,” and he sounded almost sincere, eyes tightly closed, “Tony and Bucky are about all this Brooklyn boy can handle.”
Steve grinned. “Well, bearing in mind the first was a date and the last was a blow job, I’m prepared to let you tell me what you’d prefer.” His eyes twinkled. “I’m up for pretty much anything.” The eyebrow waggle was distracting. So was everything else about him.
Steve refused to think about it. Maybe if he pretended long enough it would eventually be believed into reality. “Open your gift,”
“He is afraid,” Wanda said. Her eyes glowed scarlet. “He loves as deeply as he hates, and it is all twisted up with his father and mother and brother.” She rubbed her forehead. “It is very difficult to read him.”
He held up a hand. “I came to terms with that a couple of years ago. I just didn’t know that it was Cap’s boyfriend.”
Tony’s throat felt raw. He took a sip of water, trying to get the words in the right order to make this happen. “I’m not asking you to dispense with the Accords, ladies and gentlemen. I’m asking you to take some time, read through my proposal and then help me to make the world feel safe again.”
Tony folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. He and Cap were friendly. Not friends, not yet, but they managed to run the Avengers Initiative together with very few disagreements. He was sure Cap would tell him that he’d found his childhood sweetheart and that he’d turned out to be the most lethal assassin in the history of the world.
Steve was the only one of them that came out of the game sober and with his reputation intact. Tragically, it had nothing to do with the super soldier serum. Steve was an actual real-life Boy Scout. Tony wondered what the hell Steve saw in him.
apolgies for the delay in posting. I broke my thumb and am only now able to type without howling iin pain. Sexy times are coming. STG.
Strange stepped a little closer to Steve. Tony wasn’t too sure how he felt about that. “Well, if we don't do our jobs.” Tony watched Steve lift his jaw, set in the way that only Captain America, the world’s most stubborn asshole could do.
Bucky nodded. “He knows. Just thought you should know too.” He sat down in one of the armchairs and put his head in his hands.
Steve saw his eyes gloss over. So did Tony. “No!” Tony poked a finger in Scott’s chest. “No tears. There have been way too many tears and I’m completely teared out.”
Steve started laughing. He couldn’t help himself. He tried to get himself under control but nothing worked. Eventually he was heaving breaths as he bent over, gusts of laughter billowing out of him. The tears that ran down his cheeks started out as happy but they turned into salted sadness as he dropped to his knees, sobbing.
Sam’s eyes slid to his brother and Tony saw the fondness in his gaze. “Dean was determined not to keep you waiting.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, rubbing a hand across his eyes. “Onward, McDuff.” He searched for Fury’s number in his phone and dialed it.
Tony lowered his gaze to his hands. Bucky and Steve were holding onto him as though he was a center that would prevent them from flying apart. He wasn’t going to be the one to make that come true.
“That was the project name for the development of the Super Soldier Serum back in the war,” King T’Challa said, not missing a cue. “The project that produced Captain America.”
“What does this mean?” The South African spoke up again. “All it showed us was that he wanted to take care of the woman he loved.”
Dean sighed. “You and Sam should have a talk about that too,” he muttered. “He’s a fifty shades of grey kinda guy.”
“I was the one who killed them.” Bucky met his gaze. “I remember your mother crawling out of the car towards your father, begging me to let them live.” His voice was a monotone.
Bruce grunted at him, accepting a shirt and trousers from Laura. “Thank god you created these pants, Tony. Thanks for not making me go naked.”
“The closer to the source of the original spell, the easier it will to detangle it.” Strange sat perfectly still.
“Uh-huh.” Tony still wasn’t sure where Steve was going with this. He glanced over at Rhodey and Sam who both wore expressions that looked remarkably like horror. He could practically see Sam wanting to clamp a hand over Steve's mouth.
Steve stared at Natasha. He didn't know what he was feeling right now. Part of him wanted to call Vision back and demand to know Tony's whereabouts. The other part, the part sitting next to Bucky in the Quinjet, wanted to do this the long way around.
Bruce pulled a small StarkPhone out. Tony’s eyes narrowed. The asshole could have been traced the entire time with his phone. Tony had been an idiot! “Nat?”
“King of Hell?” Dean looked around the room. “Seriously, does nobody know what’s going on in the world?” He threw his hands up.
“He has a really tight circle of friends.” Tony thought about the few times that he’d been around Steve in a social sense.
“All you have to do is reverse whatever you did to poison my friend,” Steve said as the transporter shuddered to a stop. Peggy had brought them right to the infirmary.
“The Director has confirmed that the SRA is in play.” Coulson came back to their group. “Things are further along than expected."
Steve dropped back down to the floor, holding his pounding head together with his shaking hands. His team was a mess, he was disgustingly hung-over and his best friend slash boyfriend was off saving the universe.
“We could go down to the gym,” Bucky suggested. “Work out a little of the frustration. Or the bedroom?” He waggled his eyebrows and Steve grinned at him. Bucky was more and more the man he remembered. It was one small spark of joy that beat through him.
Tony looked over to Steve and Bucky. They were watching him intently. It was a little unnerving. He wanted to go to them, to burrow into the heat of Steve’s body, but this was all still new and he wasn’t sure of his boundaries.
Whatever the reason, he woke at five in the morning feeling more at home in his skin than he had for more than a year.
Dean held up a hand. “Excuse me, can someone catch us up?” Tony got the feeling that Dean wasn’t the sort to ask politely a second time.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y. wouldn’t tell me a damn thing!” Pepper yelled. Tony could see that part of her anger was fear.
Tony scooted behind Strange. Discretion was definitely the better part of valor in this case as Skurge landed on his feet in front of them.
Tony suddenly understood why Regency heroines were always swooning when the heroes kissed them. He felt a little dizzy, clinging to Steve as he fell into the kiss.
The sound of an engine had them both looking up. “Time to face the music,” Tony said, pushing to his feet.
one other person. One other person who got into his space and wouldn’t let his money or his possessions or his bullshit push him away.” Rhodes took the jet up. “In case you missed the memo, that person was you.”
“How are you planning on stopping me?” Tony asked. “I’m out here and you’re in there.” He waved a gauntleted hand at the Cage.
Tony rolled his shoulders. “Each of you have a revised copy of the Accords on the tablets in your rooms. Read through them. Let me know what you think. If you sign on then we talk. If you don’t, well, you walk.”
Tony met that steady cobalt gaze. Still so much the soldier. Bucky had always been at Steve’s shoulder, guarding his left with Sam at his right. Tony had once been there, until he’d stepped out from behind his captain and fucked everything up.
Steve pretended to startle. “Oh my god!” He clutched his other hand to his chest. “So you are. Would you look at that?”
“You’re like a duck.” Tony leaned around Bucky and glared at him. “All serene and calm up top, and paddling like crazy underneath.” He sat back, muttering again.
Steve went cold. “Tony…” but Tony was gone, leaving Steve sitting on the kitchen floor with a heart cracked open.
Steve felt nauseous. Everything he’d done, every decision he’d made, had led to this. To his friend being so afraid to see him again that his heart literally broke.
worried. Bucky had just looked so sad when he’d heard that Tony wasn’t back yet. Part of Steve still wondered if his part in whatever the hell the three of them were was because Tony didn’t want him to feel lonely or to feel rejected.
“The Man of Iron, the Captain of America and the Soldier of Winter returned from Hel, having vanquished the enemy!” Thor beamed at Fury. “Tis a feat worthy of much festivity!”
“Do you have any idea how long I’ve been singing your praises to Steve and you go and demolish all my work in a second?” Pepper glared at him, hands on her hips and foot tapping.
Dean muscled his way past them to stand beside Sam. “This it?” he asked, looking up at the mountain of granite. The smell of sulphur hung in the air, a tangible thing that felt like a blanket dropping down over them.
Steve actually felt his nostrils flare. These little digs were getting tiresome. “Tony is still part of this team.” He tilted his chin when Fury stared at him. “Sir.” He said it with as much insolence as he could convey in one word.
“Not just yet, Cap!” Tony yelled back. “I’m just teaching this asshole some manners!” The two suits rolled in the air and then dropped, plunged several hundred feet before stopping. Steve’s heart was in his throat.
“The Secretary of State,” Tony answered. “He called for a meeting about something he has in the pipeline. I’m going to try to head him off at the pass.”
Tony held his nose, closed his eyes and downed the poison. He gagged, but managed to keep it down. “That is disgusting!” he wheezed.
“No bugs!” She glared at him. “Clean place. No bugs.” Tony wondered if bugs were the worst things to be found in a room in this place. He somehow doubted it.
She sighed, sitting down on the bed. “They’re coming home. What do you want to do?” She met his gaze fearlessly. “Whatever you choose, I’ll support you.”
“The Reality Stone,” Thor said. “The Aether that almost tore my Jane apart and destroyed half of London. That has been taken to Knowwhere and the Collector Taneleer Tivan keeps it safe.”
“I said he could come back here to see you guys instead of putting him somewhere else,” Tony told him. “The government isn’t very happy with some of the things your dad and his friends have done, so he needs to have supervision.”
“I didn't want to hurt anyone anymore,” Bruce said, just as sad. “God, Tasha, I'm so sick of hurting people.”
“Are you saying that you were instrumental in assisting the fugitives escape?” The American representative was on his feet. “You should have taken their place!”
“I want it all,” Steve said. He lifted his hand, cupped Tony’s cheek. “I want the team, I want my friend healed, I want the world to be safe. But most of all, even if I don’t get any of those other things, I’ll be okay if I get the chance to be with you.”
Clint raised a hand. “I followed Cap. Not an excuse, but my whole life has been one of being accountable to someone. Captain America was the guy I followed when Phil died. He called, I answered.” He rubbed his hands together. “I hated the idea of us being answerable to the same people that wanted to nuke New York.”
“Nat, Wanda didn't do anything. I swear. You need to chill out. This was all me.” Tony held up a hand. “Besides, you and Steve need to go and do your thing. You have a new team to test out. I just need some time to work this out.”
“Stark Mansion is considerably smaller than the tower,” Vision replied. “But there is sufficient space for you and the rest of your team. You will all have your own suites with bathrooms.”
Vision inclined his head. There was the vaguest suggestion of a smile on his face. “I believe that would be an excellent place to start,” he agreed.
Steve could hardly remember his own name; let alone what he’d been going to say. “Think we’re maybe rushing things?” He finally managed to get the thought out.
much of something.” He waved his other hand at Bruce. “Any chance you’ve got some clothes lying around the jungle?”
“You might want to monitor him after this next tidbit, Viz,” Rhodey said, pushing Vision towards Tony. “Not sure if this information will cause another attack.”
Well, he tried to call back, but Bucky’s tongue was busy making love to his tongue so he couldn’t really talk.
The others would come out and spend time with Steve occasionally. Natasha, Sam and Peter were his regular companions. Wanda and Vision seemed uncomfortable with him around so never stayed long. He never saw Tony.
“Double-dog daring, Stark,” Steve grinned, a small, but beautiful thing. “I have faith in you.” Tony thought that despite the sorrow and the loss, at least they’d worked through their anger at each other and become a stronger unit for it.
Tony looked around at his team. Waited for Steve. “You need to tell us everything,” Steve ordered Fury. “And no hedging.”
Tony tugged Bucky away from Steve, wrapping around him from the back. Steve kept his hands on him too, watching as Bucky slumped against Tony, back to chest with Tony’s legs on either side of Bucky’s hips. Bucky turned his face into Tony’s neck, clearly still hiding.
“I don’t…” he stopped. “Oh.” He could feel his stupid skin flush. It was a goddamn curse. “That wasn’t what I meant.”
“You almost died but instead of giving up, you not only survived, you’ve saved the world. More than once.” Steve hated the almost defeated expression in Tony’s gaze.
“We should possibly have had this conversation right after we found you,” Tony said, lifting one hand to push several long strands of hair out of Bucky’s face. “I really can't stand thinking about you having this on your heart all this time.”
