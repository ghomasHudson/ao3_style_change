That night his leg was stiffer than usual as he gingerly lowered himself into bed, and he hesitated before pulling the card from its envelope and propping it up on his bedside table. With the things Sherlock had somehow known about him, it was probably too late to hide this last, embarrassing revelation from him anyway, so John figured he might as well enjoy the comfort this habit gave him as long as he could.
John tried to be early to meet Sherlock, but the tube was delayed for maintenance and he ended up being thirty minutes late. He stumbled across the threshold of the cafe without really looking around, and was surprised when a gloved hand caught him by the arm to steady him from falling.
“Sherlock, duckie, listen. I can’t see you like you were yesterday,” John said. “You are not going to put off taking your pills until you’re practically freezing to death.”
“Oh my God,” John had said, wonder and a little bit of fear in his voice. “You’re him. You’re his brother.“
Finally the phone lights up. 3:37 AM, and a ding. Thought I’d turned the ringer off?
Sherlock muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “do you not know what Google is,” and John stifled a laugh.
Sherlock carefully rearranged his face into an expression of pure need, then held his arm out. It didn’t matter that his arm shook; it would be read as the shaking of desire, not the shaking of revulsion that it actually was. Sherlock closed his eyes when he felt a sweaty hand around his upper arm…
“Fine. But if it’s anything stronger than paracetamol, Sherlock, I swear you’re going to pee in a jar every day for the rest of your life,” John warned, but he went to get the bottle.
“Sherlock? Are you awake? I’d…I’d like to talk, if that’s alright,” John said from the doorway.
“I wouldn’t be, I don’t know, a bother, at your family Christmas?”
More than anything else, the picture on the card became home for him, and he sometimes wondered if the boy who had written it, who must surely be grown up by now, still lived at the manor house. Or still lived in England at all.
“I have a date,” Sherlock announced nonchalantly as he closed the medicine cabinet.
“I can’t promise that,” John said, his throat dry. “I don’t...it’s not...”
Sherlock yawned and stretched his way to a sitting position, and reached for the tea.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” Sherlock said coolly, pushing the bathroom door open and stepping inside. Enough of this.
, Sherlock thought, fighting the urge to grin widely.
Sherlock leaned into him. “Hmm. Thank you.”
“Right. I’m off,“ he said, turning and pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, the only part of him currently visible above the duvet. “I...” he hesitated.
John laughed softly. “If anyone could do that it would be you. You would have made an amazing chemist, in the muggle world.”
THE Sherlock’s eyes scanned him. John wasn’t sure what he was looking for, and wished that he would glance away for a minute so John could get a better look at him without Sherlock seeing, because from what he saw so far--well, it was bloody unfair how beautiful he was.
Got to stop thinking about that. It was bad enough last time and I’m only making it worse. Wait a few minutes, let the phone get charged up enough to turn on, and check the time and see if I can get any more sleep before I have to be at the surgery. Early shift tomorrow: a scheduled surgery, non-emergency procedure, patient will have fasted beforehand, maybe not slept much the night before. Cranky, scared. So there’s that to look forward to.
“Right,” John said when he returned. “Let me clean your arm a bit, and we’ll see if you need stitches.”
There. That moment, only distinguishable if you’re looking for it, and sometimes then only in that instant after it has passed, when night falls. That precise angle where the sun is no longer bright enough even to call it dusk...in spite of the stiff back, the sore knees from the climb up the tree (fell out twice, one of those times landed wrong, on the bad ankle--will have to get that looked at if, when? ...if he makes it back to London) he breathes out a little contented sigh. The game, indeed. Would be more pleasant (read: less stiff and cold and achy, or at least more tolerably stiff and cold and achy) with certain company, but--not this time. Couldn’t risk it.
“Yes, John. It’s where two people who like each other go out and have fun,” answered the detective, rolling his eyes. “Or have you forgotten?”
“I’ll work on a potion, then,” he said. “I’ll invent one that will trick the curses, if you take it—make them think you aren’t muggle-born. Then you can come visit next summer.”
Sherlock finished unbuttoning his shirt and pulled it off. It had soaked up most of the blood and was probably not salvageable.
Hidden in a tree outside Dmanisi cathedral ruins. Georgia. Night settles over the hills, and the sounds of crickets start to overtake the chirps of birds as the passeriformes settle down for the night. It will be a long night, and likely as uneventful as the past few nights.
Emily
“Mmmm,” John agreed, circling his hand around Sherlock’s wrist. “But yer thin, thinner than you were before you left. I need t’feed ye up a bit,” he said, and giggled. Sherlock caught a strong whiff of whiskey as he leaned in.
“What kind of stories?” John asked.
Despair welled up in Sherlock. This was the end, then. He would have to say the hateful words.
“Aarrgggghh,” Sherlock groaned into a throw pillow, kicking his feet in the air.
Because that’s back, now he’s--fucking gone. Sherlock fucking bloody Holmes is gone and I, John Watson, am an absolute wreck. Finally admitting it to myself, not even out loud, does absolutely nothing to help.
Cheers.
Sherlock heard footsteps approaching, but they were much too light to be John’s, and besides, their owner was clearly wearing heels.
“I’m afraid I don’t see your point, John,” Sherlock pondered, stepping closer toward his friend.
Sherlock flung himself backwards, breaking John’s grip, and fled to his room.
He turned and nodded briefly to John, then headed around the corner for the basement door. The lock was an embarrassment and he had it picked and the door opened by the time John caught up with him.
“Well....yes, he’s the one that found you. He texted me. You know, because he won’t ever do his own field work,” John said, slightly defensively.
was not in the
And then John had hugged him, and Sherlock had allowed it. There really was no other word Sherlock could assign to John’s actions. Was this just a bromance thing? Sherlock wasn’t sure. He wasn’t entirely convinced that the term was even real--Molly had introduced him to the concept, saying that she had learned it off one of those misspelt blogging websites, and suggesting that it might be an apt description of what he had with John. More intense than a simple friendship, but not sexual. Sherlock supposed that the term didn’t matter much so long as John stayed with him. And if you averaged it out over time (which Sherlock did), yes, they both had left but they had both eventually returned, and stayed. He supposed that at the moment it might not look that way to John, but he was not supposed to know that this current disaster of a mission had been intended to be fatal.
“Sherlock, can you come round to the yard and have a look at—“ Lestrade started to say, but Sherlock rounded upon him with a glare.
This train of thought caused Sherlock to finally stand up and clap his hands together.
“There was never a date, John. I never saw or spoke to Brian again. ”
“Have. Present tense,” Sherlock mumbled, feeling his face burn.
“A bit. I drank too much. I don’t usually—I mean, with the pills. I just take the minimum to keep the cold off,” Sherlock said.
Lestrade guestures at my phone. “Him, on there, what’s he saying?”
“Hmph.”
The first days out of the hospital turned into first months, and his limp improved incrementally.
“John, I—I’m fine,” Sherlock started to protest, but John shook his head.
“It’s all yours,” Greg said, producing the bottle (hidden in his coat! Sherlock could have kicked himself for not noticing) and handing it over. “Merry Christmas.”
What he saw erased any trace of sleepiness he felt.
Sherlock was at home when the cab stopped in front of 221, and John could see his outline through the curtains – he must have been watching for him to arrive. By the time John had ascended the stairs, however, Sherlock was flopped on the couch, looking as though he had been there all day. John only smiled, shook his head, and went upstairs to deposit his belongings in the room that really had never stopped being his. There was nothing he could think of to say that didn’t sound idiotic, redundant, or pathetic in his head, so he never said “I’m home,” or “I’ll have that second bedroom, if it’s still available,” or worse yet “Oh God Sherlock, I made a terrible mistake and I missed you so much.”
“Well. I would congratulate you, but...” Sherlock looked pointedly at his empty glass. “Where is my mead?”
John inhaled sharply and finally recognized the unpleasant sensation gnawing at his insides.
But the things that Sherlock said––it struck something raw and painful.
“I don’t care,” John swore. “She deserved it. I’d do it again.”
“Yes.” Sherlock brushed his lips against John’s elbow and closed his eyes. A moment passed and he realized that he had not started to drink yet, so he bit slowly into the soft skin, then froze when John sighed.
I mean I’m basically assuming by now you don’t see any of this, not sure why I’m writing it. Maybe as a reminder of what I want to tell you about when you get back. JW
“I’m going to bed,” Sherlock said, rising stiffly to his feet. “Rest assured I pose no threat to you. I’ll move out in the morning if that’s what you need.”
“What’s that?” Mike pointed at the card.
I know you’re awake, it’s bloody 11 AM already GL
“Hey, Chief, did you get the statements on the—Oh, out without your boyfriend?” Donovan poked her head around the office door and called to them.
“He was just playing, he said,” Sherlock tried to sound dignified, like someone who had not just unintentionally and abruptly relocated his face to the floor, but the words came out as a cracked sort of whisper. “I don’t think he planned to kill me. Wanted me alive, addicted. I’m not. Wasn’t enough to do that.” Sherlock sounded almost petulant. John thought he felt a headache coming on. This was rapidly becoming more complicated than the “shoot kidnappers, get Sherlock out” plan he had gone in with.
“Anyway, that doesn’t scare me. What does, a bit, is that at twelve years old you, Master Holmes, know so much about ancient Dark curses.” John paused and frowned. “And how did you know it was a dark curse she hit me with? Do you even know who she is? I don’t think I’ve ever told you…”
One evening, after the sun had mostly set, John rose from his spot on the grass, brushed a few early-winter leaves off his knees, and started towards the main path to the Regent’s Park gate. They were closing it earlier and earlier now that the days were getting shorter again, and he didn’t fancy getting locked in. One night near midsummer he had stayed until well after sunset and found the gates locked. Somehow, infected with the bright moon and the strength of the solstice, he had managed to scramble over the hedgerow wall, but he didn’t fancy trying it again in the late fall with a leg that seemed to only be getting dodgier.
4:53 AM
“There’s nothing to bloody well figure out!” Sherlock yelled, losing all patience. “I’ll email you my statement. I’m not staying here and listening to this.”
He didn’t remember the field hospital, or the first surgery. He was briefly conscious in Germany, only long enough to register that the actors speaking in the show playing softly on the TV in his room were speaking in German; almost the moment the thought registered, he was gone again.
I’m listening.
The door creaked open, and Sherlock quickly wiped the expression from his face.
Bainbridge’s response was less than enlightening. “Oh, you know, Cap,” he said with a wink, and hopped on his broomstick and flew off.
“Well, that’s useless,” John said. “Bunch of gibberish and some old fashioned music?”
A faint blue glow in his hand.
age could not be delivered
“Of course he’s all right, why wouldn’t he be?”
Sherlock saw a flash of metal, and then a screaming pain lit through his back. “Encouragement.” The sudden stab, the invasion, the sharp, bright, wrongness of it knocked him to the side and Sherlock struggled to sit up again. His back felt wet, and he willed himself to ignore it.
“Nice of them to label everything so clearly,” John noted.
“John! I found it!” He called.
Then Sherlock bit, tentatively at first, and John’s mind flooded with sensation. He understood with razor clarity what Sherlock had meant by saying it was a lot and in spite of the stinging burn in his neck that seemed to be intensifying the longer Sherlock kept drinking, John wanted it to continue forever. He wanted the warmth to continue pouring out of himself, filling Sherlock until every cell of him was rosy and warm from John.
“Yes you have,” Sherlock insisted. “You’ve got something and I can’t figure out what it is. What have you got in your pockets?”
“My tie seems to have been taken,” he said. “I don’t know where it could possibly have gotten to.” Sherlock hoped that his expression was still neutral. Someone he did not recognize at the Gryffindor table snickered loudly.
“See, what if that hit somethin’? Ye’re basically making fireballs out of toxic metals in the kitchen,” John said.
“Don’t tell anyone,” Sherlock grumbled.
John mused.
“I like christmas cake,” Sherlock said. He didn’t intend to sound petulant but once the words were out, he realized that he definitely did.
“Okay, looks like you don’t have a drink yet, Sherlock,” Greg proclaimed. “Come on, let’s go find you one!” He handed John a third shot and steered Sherlock towards the bar that had been set up on the reception desk. John followed, trailing a bit anxiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come on, John,” Sherlock said, and swept from the room. Lestrade would follow, or he wouldn’t. It was likely that John had his gun with him and Sherlock had his set of lock picks in his coat pocket and well, between the gun and the lock picks and Sherlock’s mind and John’s Captain Watson Command Voice, as he privately titled it, they could handle anything.
Disregard any texts recieved last night, if you did receive them. Was slightly drunk. JW
“I’m sorry, John, forget about it. I wasn’t––“
“Well…I’m not sure how you know that. But okay, you’re right. It wasn’t a they, it was a she. She interviewed all us mudbloods,” John corrected. “And yeah, I didn’t take well to her…tactics, and I kicked her in the shins. She cursed me pretty bad and it took me most of the year to recover. My shoulder didn’t heal pretty.”
Alright, now that’s just out of line. I’m not his pet. What the hell, Lestrade.
“Hey John, can you come have a look at this body we’ve found?” Lestrade sounds more stressed than usual. “It’s...well, I don’t know what to say about it. But I figure you could take some pictures and text them to him, and look it over yourself...” John gives a little huff of laughter. He never did get around to coming clean to Lestrade, and now he actually could show Sherlock a picture of this latest crime scene…
This was not going the way Sherlock had planned. John was supposed to let him in the bathroom to do his exfoliating, and then John would see, and then he would probably kiss Sherlock, and then---well. And then things would be better, whatever that meant.
“Tell me what you need, Sherlock,” John sighed when they finally broke apart for air. “I’m yours,” he murmured as he planted kisses on that long, pale neck. “I’ll give you anything you need,” John panted. “Anything.”
There was no answer but the sound of a door creaking open.
“Here love, let me,” John says, gently taking the gun back from Sherlock. Their hands brush as he does and Sherlock shivers; only then does John’s brain catch up to what his traitorous mouth has said, but there’s no time to deal with that. Cosplay Moriarty is limping towards them, his gun still wavering in his hand but its sights still set too closely on the detective for John’s liking. He shoots once and the man falls.
“What’s your point, Donovan?” John asked tiredly. First Lestrade, now Donovan….The taunting was getting old.
“Well, you, actually,” John said without looking at Sherlock. Mechanically he pulled it from his pocket and handed it over.
Sherlock was about to protest that it was hardly his fault that he was not wearing his house tie, when--
Is it possible to miss someone so much you start to think like him, start to turn into him? Because I’m a little afraid that’s what’s happening. I spent three hours researching error messages that different phone operating systems send when messages cannot be delivered, for goodness’ sake. I highly doubt this is something I would have done before Sherlock fucking bloody Holmes. I would have been idly curious and then let it go. But I had to know, had to find some kind of proof that being sick in a wastepaper bin at work (on a Thursday, which made it worse, because then I had to go back in the next day and see the pitying expressions on the nurses’ and secretaries’ and other doctors’ faces telling me that they knew) and going home and drinking far too much whiskey had at least some solid meaning behind it.
“Ah, Sherlock...” John was not at all sure how to bring this up.
“Freak’s here,” Donovan called from across the room.
Sherlock paused in the doorway, turned and faced John as he tied his scarf. “Yes,” he lied.
“Ever the dramatic, Lestrade,” he said, while John smirked. Well. That was one potential disaster avoided, at least.
“Bedroom.” Sherlock’s voice was completely serious, and John ruffled his (floury, and now sticky) hair fondly.
“Hullo,” John said, unfolding himself from his armchair and stretching, “why are you on the floor?”
Sherlock drifted away, reading the labels on pots and shelves, and peeking around corners before checking the next row of plants. He worked his way gradually to the back to the greenhouse, ducked underneath a banner with the word YULE written in green glitter over a hand drawn mug of beer, and breathed a soft ‘aha.’
“It’s just Mummy and Mycroft and Graham and me,” Sherlock said, “and she’s been after me for ages to...oh. Oh. I--sorry.” He looked away.
“He isn’t going to kill you, at least not without some other interference,” Lestrade offered, shrugging.
Since this is a WIP, I'll also give an update on the progress of this fic here. You now have before you chapter two; chapter three has been written and is sitting on my hard drive, ready to be edited. I need sleep so that will not be happening tonight. Chapter four has been sketched out, and an epilogue has presented itself to me, so I've made a few notes on how I want that to go as well. Rest assured that I WILL be finishing this fic, because it is very dear to me. As always, THANK YOU lovely readers for sticking with me. I would love to read your thoughts/reactions/yelling about Johnlock in the comments if you are so inspired.
What do you mean missing JW
Sherlock ignored him. He’s drunk, he’s drunk, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, he repeated to himself, but the litany did nothing to ease the leaden knot in his stomach. He took off his suit jacket and draped it over a chair, then slowly unbuttoned his shirt.
Sherlock must have realized he’d given something away, because he closed his eyes immediately and bit.
John sat on the edge of the sofa and leaned back against Sherlock’s outstretched legs. “Well, let’s do it properly this time, then,” he said.
“After I wrote that letter I couldn’t stop thinking about the soldier who might get it,” Sherlock said, ignoring John’s words entirely. “I would make up stories in my head where I would somehow meet him, what he would be like, look like.” He paused, and something in his expression had become vulnerable, almost shy.
Greg smiled. “You’re almost there, come on, you can work it out.”
“Johhhn,” came a quiet voice from the floor. “I want to leave.”
Two hours after John left the flat, Sherlock was still standing in the living room. He can’t remember when he picked up his violin but it was perched against his shoulder now, a comforting weight against his body while his mind felt anything but calm.
John shook his head and Lestrade only stared. “Right, so that just leaves…the entire rest of the world. Glad we’ve narrowed it down, then.”
“Uh, right, I gotta get to Herbology. See you at practice, mate,” John replied, pushing open the great hall doors and hurrying out onto the lawn.
“Do…do you want me,” John asked, his voice very quiet, almost not a question. Sherlock twisted his head around to look over his shoulder at John. His eyes washed over John’s expression, the seriousness and the worry and—fondness?
John sighed. “Look, I know you mean well, mate, but I have it on pretty good authority that he doesn’t feel things that way, ok?” John said.
“Mike, hi,” John said.
“Ok, let’s go check this place out,” John said, and Sherlock winced. Lying by omission about the suspect’s presence: mistake number two.
“You picked the lock in about three minutes,” John said.
“Yes.”
“Why? Tired,” he said. It had been a long day of sitting motionless (or as close as a fidgety detective and bored doctor could manage) behind a dumpster followed by a sudden and unsuccessful chase through a sleepy Hebrides town that ended with the both of them wet, muddy, and exhausted.
It hurts like hell having you gone, you know that right? JW
“Shouldn’t you put your tie on? You’ll get points taken from Hufflepuff if you’re caught without it,” John said.

“I am a chemist,
Thanks for reading! Please leave us a comment and let us know if you liked it :)
“What—what are you—,” Sherlock asked, flustered.
“Well, have a good evening,” John said cheerily to the suspect, who was struggling futilely against the handcuffs that held him to the other side of the doorframe. “Scotland Yard should be around to collect you soon.”
“You know why,” John said, his voice coming out a little more gruff than he had intended. “What should have been my first year was the year…the year the ministry fell. They interviewed all of us before we were sorted…us mudblood students, tried to force us to say we had stolen our magic from a wizard. I don’t know why. It was obvious at the beginning that they were never going to let us come to Hogwarts,” John said, his voice level now. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. I got in the next year, after Potter killed him.”
If you're still reading, thanks! I got off track last week, and I'm hoping to catch up this week/end.
Sherlock said seriously, to open guffaws from the Gryffindor table.
Sherlock took a roundabout route to Bart’s. He stopped at eight of the larger parks in London, collecting four soil samples from each. That blessedly occupied the rest of the morning and beyond, and it was well into the afternoon by the time he stepped through the doors of the pathology lab, his pockets bulging with carefully labeled plastic baggies of dirt. He made a mental note to himself to replenish the stash of plastic zipper bags that he normally kept in the pockets of his coat – he had used up almost all of them in the dirt-collecting project.
Is setting me up to be killed by a communist terror cell any way to treat your dear baby brother? I dealt with your little problem, Mycroft. Now leave me the hell alone. SH
When he was gone, Sherlock snatched up his violin again and dragged the bow across the A string, which had flattened to 398 Hertz from his earlier mistreatment of it. He turned the peg a hair’s breath, bringing it back to 442, the slight sharpness that he preferred. Sherlock closed his eyes, called up “Forest Green” in his mind, and began to play.
The elder Holmes brother said nothing, watching him with a raised eyebrow.
“Sherlock?” At the sound of John’s voice, Sherlock dropped the bag of golden raisins he was holding and whirled around.
Very sincerely a
I’ve started bringing a few things with me when Lestrade calls, not much, just a few things to help me identify the cause of death faster so that I can get away from Lestrade and his questions faster. Every time it’s the same--“Where’s Sherlock“ “You alone again” and “Just like him, leaving with no explanation“ and more questions I can’t answer. Doesn’t he know I want those questions answered more than he does, more than anyone else probably? He’s not Lestrade’s flatmate, he’s mine, and I don’t think it’s too much to ask to want to know where he is.
“Look, mate,” John had started, his face heating up, “you’ve got no right to--”
“I know you don’t care!” There was another note in John’s voice besides anger now, one that Sherlock could not easily identify.
“See what?”
“Bathroom, now.” It wasn’t a question or a suggestion, and John steered him towards the door without letting go of him.
“Ha!” Sherlock scoffed. “Splendid advice from a man who married an assassin. An assassin who lied about everything––including a child who wasn’t even yours!”
“It’s not like Secret-Keeping at all,” Sherlock replied. “This curse is mainly about controlling a large population, and their access to information, keeping it suppressed…it works on the assumption that a few people already know, but doesn’t require the caster to have identified those individuals,” he finished.
Sherlock reached out to steady the top volume in the pile as he pushed the stack of textbooks towards the centre of the dresser. The 1976 edition of Recent Advanced in Ecology--hmm. Sherlock settled on the floor with his back against the bed, the book in one hand, and his tea in the other. Sometimes, there was the most fascinating unfinished research in these old journals…
See, was that so difficult? Who cares about the dirty wall though. GL
“No, no, it was. It was good,” John replied, looking anywhere but at Sherlock. “I’m—it’s fine.”
He opened the first vial.
SORRY FOR THE ANGST
Suddenly, Sherlock opened his eyes, an idea crossing his great mind.
“You know what? We’re leaving,” John said, snatching the calendar away and tossing it at Greg. “This is not funny and we have better things to be doing.”
“I don’t care what he wanted,” John said, as he put an arm under Sherlock’s less-injured shoulder and dragged him to his feet.”Disinfecting and dressing this disaster-” John waved at Sherlock “-is going to be painful for both of us and not a trivial amount of work, and I’d rather not do it here. We are leaving now, and you are going to stand up and try to walk.“
“I…I don’t understand,” he eventually said.
Calling him a stalker, (which he knew he was not, but could admit that it might look that way to someone else) or maudlin (he would readily admit to that), or even calling him to call off their---what was it? A date? John wasn’t sure of that--were nothing compared to how much it would hurt to lose the card.
“Right,” Sherlock said, planting himself in front of a whiteboard with a marker.
“Is my nudity making you uncomfortable, John?” Sherlock asked. “Perhaps you could grab my robe from the coat rack? I believe we’re almost done here.”
“You’re leaving something out,” John said. “You’re not a very good liar, at least not to me.”
In England, after the third surgery, he finally woke and stayed awake. The hospital released him sooner than he’d hoped, and then he had too much time and too little money and no idea how to fix that.
A snuffling noise from somewhere above him drew Sherlock’s attention back to reality.
Sherlock gets naked (again), John walks out, and interesting things eventually happen.
Isn’t it?
Sherlock did not completely trust his brain at the moment, so he didn’t tell John that his stitches were always straighter and more precise when he was keyed up, and instead extended his stitched-up arm for John’s inspection.  Fingers ghosted along the stitches, which were of course far more precise than John had expected, and eventually John nodded, satisfied.
a Gryffindor,” Sherlock giggled. He couldn’t help it—it was such a Gryffindor, such a
“How do you do,” John nodded, turning around to face him.
“Why won’t you show it to me?” Sherlock asked, releasing John’s elbow as soon as he was back on his feet.
“That must be it. It must have been taken at some point during the night,”
They apprehended a suspect in an arson case and the man kept giving false statements. After five hours of fruitless questioning, Sherlock was finally able to deduce where the man hid his gas-soaked clothes. This caused the suspect to break down in tears and confess to committing the crime.
“I’ll explain the pills,” Sherlock offered. “If you stitch me up. I’ll explain them and then if you still want me to go to the hospital I will.” It’s the very last concession that he has to offer, because he has never looked into what the medical establishment knows about his condition.
“You might find our games tiring, and wish for some rest?” His captor mused, almost to himself, and this time he traced the bridge of Sherlock’s nose with his knife.
“Sorry, sorry!” Mike said hastily. “But really, you should come meet him!”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was an interesting point where the noise made by the heating water got louder and louder until just as it began to boil, the noise dropped to a whisper. Admittedly, the property was more easily distinguished with boiling N2, but for those who knew what they were listening for it was possible to hear it in water’s phrase transition as well.
“Oh,” John breathed as he stopped outside the open bathroom door. “Going somewhere?”
“Time for you to move on, son,” said the bartender as he passed by John. “We’re closing in five minutes.”
“Take what you need,” John whispered.
Handcuffs. Right. “Coat pocket,” Sherlock said. He fished them out with his left hand and tossed them to John.
But now John was late.
An hour and a half—Sherlock checked his watch. Half four. That gave him until six pm before he would start displaying symptoms that John would not be able to ignore, an hour and a half in which to solve this crime before the truth of his nature made itself known to John and quite possibly ruined his entire carefully constructed existence. John would leave, and without John there was nothing.
“Try me.”
“What?” John asked, crossing his arms.
Lestrade’s irritated and seems to think I am too--impossible to convey tone over these short messages. I’m actually excited, my thumbs twitching over the touchscreen, because I think I’m onto something, and he just thinks I’m repeating what Holmes says. Well.
“He says to have a look at the light fixtures, that there might be something in there, I don’t know, he doesn’t say what. Just that it’s unlikely that so many would go out at once and be left that way.“ I put my phone back in my pocket, pick up my bag. “I’m opening the surgery today so I’ve got to go.” Start walking away quickly, get away before he can ask me any more questions.
“You got these from Mycroft.” It wasn’t a question, and Sherlock’s tone gave away nothing. Sherlock dropped the coat, then sat down next to it and began fishing in the pockets for his lock picks.
Mycroft had not warned him (had not known?) about the condition that Sherlock would be in by the time John got there, and John found that he was deeply unprepared to see Sherlock this way.
Sherlock are you actually (hit send too soon, hands still shaking)
“John, John, John,” chanted Sherlock, almost delirious with want, his pale body undulating restlessly on the sheets.
“Ok, I might have given him a bit of a sedative once and then he got really chatty,” John admitted. “I didn’t ask anything inappropriate, you volunteered the information, Sherlock!”
“It’s half molar.”
John took a deep breath and blew it out slowly. “Greg, mate, I wish you wouldn’t have said all that,” he said.
“Fine,” Sherlock replied, intending to do nothing of the sort. There wasn’t time to wait for Lestrade, who would undoubtedly be required to obtain a warrant before breaking and entering into the townhouse.
“Thought you’d like that,” Greg said, satisfied.
“Mycroft, of course. This bunker isn’t new. He found blueprints to the three locations he thought it possible you were being held, and I memorized all of them.”
“See what, Sherlock?”
“John, I—” Sherlock paused. “I’m not angry. You, you know that? Right? I was just…I was scared,” he admitted.
I’m sending you pictures of the crime scene, just forward them to him and see what he says GL
Sherlock wrung the final notes of the concerto from his violin, a trio of rich double stops in a minor key, and let the bow drop from his hands, his violin settling back into its case almost of its own accord. His eyes drifted shut and he stayed still for a moment, breathing in the last few motes of rosin dust as they settled out of the air. Later, his shoulders would ache. Later, he would arrange his scarf to cover the angry red patch on his clavicle where the shoulder rest had rubbed his skin raw. Later, he would regret the slashes of tarnish on his purpled fingers, but first he was still, hearing the last few notes of the concerto in his mind.
Empty Beer Bottle Number 2 seemed nonplussed at this revelation, so John decided to focus on Empty Beer Bottle Number 3 which was currently wrapped in the warmth of his now trembling hand.
“NO” That was not supposed to come out as a shout. What the hell.
“Good.” Sherlock wrote “dirt” and “Dover?” on the board.
(See the end of the chapter for
John took a deep, steadying breath. “I’m all right,” he said, tearing his gaze from Sherlock’s eyes, then smiling fondly. “Ah, you’ve got a bit of— ” He brought his thumb to the corner of Sherlock’s lips and dabbed away the small red smudge.
John looked at the floor. “Yeah. Well. I mean. I’ve been trying to hide it but. It er. Does something to me, when you.” He flushed, fairly mortified by this point. “When you drink. It does—“ John shook his head, unable to actually say those words out loud to Sherlock.
“It’s….please. Please just let me take them first,” Sherlock said, hating the whiny note that had crept into his voice.
It’s more than what would he be thinking, though--what would he be seeing? What am I not seeing? What does he see, when he stands in front of a broken window or a body? All those details, all linked together, a path of tiny facts leading to an unassailable conclusion. It’s amazing, really.
Apparently at some point during that last thought I stopped breathing--I can see it so clearly it’s almost like we’re back at Baker street again, everything normal, well, as normal as you get with Holmes as your flatmate--
“In the bathroom,” Sherlock replied, listening as John’s footsteps approached closer.
“John, can you…can you listen to something, while you sew,” he said.
“And somehow, you, John Watson, in spite of your impure blood, you seem unaware of your place,” the man had said in a tone far milder than the words implied.
A little harsh but seriously Lestrade, I had my hands inside some poor drunk’s liver for half the morning, have a little respect.
“I don’t want you feel like it…like we have to do anything. Because of what we have been doing,” John said.
Sherlock plans his escape back to Britian, and might have just given away that he's been reading all of John's messages all along.
No, someone has to have been in there and made that mess on that wall. Find out who that is. Could be important JW
“Your hands are tan, but you’ve no tan lines above your wrists, I can see just there where your coat sleeve is pushed up a bit. So you’ve gotten some sun but not sunbathing. Abroad for work, then. The way you hold yourself says military and your limp, which is almost certainly psychosomatic clearly says recently injured under traumatic circumstances. So: military, been abroad recently, and injured. That leaves Afghanistan or Iraq.” Sherlock’s words rushed out in a torrent, threatening to pull John under.
It took an embarrassing ten seconds for John to realize that it was him who made that sound.
“I’m not going to talk about it.” Sherlock drained the rest of his tea in one gulp and set the teacup in the sink. “I’m going to Bart’s. I’ll be back late. Don’t wait up.”
He waited a few moments, making sure he heard the faucet turning on and John’s inebriated, mumbled curses as he stumbled his way into the bath. There were a few splashes (John dropping the soap, then a washcloth, and finally his opened shampoo bottle, Sherlock theorized, based on the noise) followed by some half-hearted curses, and then it was time.
The front door opened, and his heart stuttered.
Then John put a hand on his arm, just below the cut, to prepare to stitch him up, and they both flinched.
. Sherlock leaned forward and peered into the mirror, smoothing some of the cream into the skin behind his left ear.
Two mornings after.
“Well, here we are, so feel free to get started with the threatening and lecturing,” John said wearily, sliding into the booth opposite Mycroft.
I’m not paying any attention to Lestrade at all now, just took another picture of the part of the tracks where the victim clearly was when he? she? don’t know; didn’t ask was hit. But those lights, though.
He was about to slide the card back into his jacket pocket when he heard a familiar voice.
“My feelings for you aren’t that simple. They’re not easy to explain.”
“Crime stories. I knew I wanted to be a detective from the beginning. I would need a partner, and you were always with me on stakeouts, listening while I talked through the evidence...” Sherlock shook his head. “It probably sounds creepy.”
“You’re one to talk!”
,” Sherlock insisted. “The principles of muggle chemistry and potion-making are astonishingly similar.”
It was a little too late when Sherlock realized just how ugly his words were. John’s face had turned expressionless.
“Uh--sorry?”
“Funny, I was going to ask you the same thing,” John hummed as he suddenly lifted Sherlock like a groom carrying his bride.
“I’m not doing your drunken secret santa,” Sherlock said. “I don’t want it.”
“And what question would that be?”
“N-normally neck,” Sherlock replied, his shivers making him stutter. “But I don’t…I…no.”
The best laid plans...Sherlock's boat trip goes a bit awry. He is detained by an unknown party and tortured.
“Brian. Good to meet you,” Sherlock greeted as he held out his hand. “Welcome to 221B,” the detective continued, closing the door and ushering the young man up the stairs. As he climbed up the steps behind his guest, Sherlock allowed himself to smile a little. He couldn’t wait for the experiment to begin.
“You want to say something but you’re not sure you should say it,” the detective noted.
Good thing there's a cab to get our still slightly drunk and very sleepy duo back to Baker Street from St. Bart's!
No that’s what I’m telling you Sherlock god GL
“He’s always around here, making a nuisance of himself,” Mike said. “Begging body parts off the medical examiner, stealing my time on the liquid chromatograph. He’s a terror.”
Sherlock mentally scolded himself. John knew him far too well.
“It’s just that I never know where I stand with you.”
The floor was very close, and there was blood on John’s shoes. It was fresh, judging from the colour and viscosity.
And I try to hide it, to bury these thoughts so deep he won’t be able to deduce them, even though I know that normally he can read every thought that crosses my mind. But the texts and the waiting keep dredging everything back up to the surface and I don’t know if I can bury it anymore.
“I haven’t got anything,“ John said, feeling his palms start to get warm. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Ok, that was a bit uncalled for. Anyway, my phone beeps again.
Sherlock are you there JW
“Bed?” John asked, after he trusted himself to speak. “Not—I mean can I help you to bed. You look about ready to pass out,” he added hastily.
Well, who’s been in the house since the last pic? JW
“What do we know?“ Molly, Lestrade, and Mycroft stood around him in a small semicircle.
“Mmm…” Sherlock purred appreciatively as he opened the bottle, releasing the scent of cherry blossoms into the air. He gently rubbed the silky liquid across his chest, shoulders, thighs––everywhere he could reach. A few moments later, Sherlock stood proudly in front of the bathroom mirror, naked as the day he was born. The shimmering lotion was worth the splurge, after all. His pale skin looked wonderfully soft and radiant. Sherlock grinned at his reflection. Just then, he heard the doorbell ring.
John imagined Empty Beer Bottle Number 1 giving him a sympathetic glance. He turned his eyes to Empty Beer Bottle Number 2, which was standing precariously close to the edge of the table.
If anyone could come up with a way to make their phone answer that but actually be reading the texts it’d be you right JW
“The pills. I didn’t—I didn’t account for blood loss. I should have taken four,” he said.
“Mmmph,” Sherlock agreed, this time mumbling because his mouth was full of John’s wrist and John’s warm blood.
“Ok, I’m going to go get the first aid kid from the kitchen. Do you want me to bring you a cuppa?”
Another case from L--he wants you here JW
John held his breath, mustering up all his strength to not pound into Sherlock right then and there. The lisp appeared rarely––only when Sherlock was incredibly exhausted. But now, hearing Sherlock lisp while begging for release sent a shockwave of lust through John’s system.
What? I drop my coat on my chair, change to the lab coat. Put my stethoscope around my neck, great, completely look the part of a doctor who is seriously concerned about this possible scarlet fever case and not obsessing over whatever in hell his flatmate is getting up to several time zones away (I assume? Mycroft said Eastern Europe after all) without me.
He didn’t open the card as often anymore; he mostly knew the words by heart and usually what he really wanted was to look at the house. To imagine the warm hearthfires that must be inside, and the wide sofas and deep armchairs with soft cushions.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but nods. “Fine.”
“It’s—you’re—,” Sherlock fumbled for the words. “It’s for a…condition I came to have while I was away, those years. I have to take it.” He was aware that he was making it sound as if he had some sort of chronic illness, but really, what better way to describe it? He would die without the pills, he knew that. The alternative was unthinkable.
Moron. I’m not going to fall for that the way your pet doctor did. Answer me. MH
“Dull,” he had hissed as the fifth lit cigarette sank into his back, ashy and hot, and the man was hardly capable of understanding that Sherlock referred to anything other than his pitiable torture techniques. That had been the tenth visit from the man in twice as many days. (Why wait so long between visits? Sherlock knew by that point that the man did not intend to kill him. Perhaps he thought his...work was more destructive than it actually was, and intended for the detective to heal, however perfunctorily, during those intervals.) This was the first visit involving burning, which turned out to be more difficult to ignore than the knives.
“About that,” John said. “If you want to—”
Sherlock played it once through in F major, because that was the key that the version he had memorized was written in. Then he played through the highest of the three harmony lines even though he had always disliked that particular harmonization. He switched back to the melody and played it again, and then flexed his fingers and launched back into this melody, this time in a different key.
It’s not like they had agreed on a specific time. But “every other evening” had wound up being “every other evening five minutes after John finishes his dinner” and while the precise time had varied on days that John worked a little late or didn’t work at all, it had never been later than seven pm.
He kept only a month’s supply in the bottle that normally lived at the back of his sock index, preferring to secure the rest in a safe underneath his bed. He took two pills every morning, as soon as he woke up, and was warmed up to a more human temperature within thirty minutes. If he took another two pills before midnight, his temperature never dipped below thirty-five Celsius.
“Fine,” Sherlock agreed. “Speedy’s cafe on Baker Street, tomorrow at seven.” He turned on his heel and stomped off, making considerably more noise than Mike and Ryan had.
“John,” Sherlock began, his voice muffled into John’s coat, and the words coming out a bit slurred--Jaawn. “John, you are a friend and an Englishman.” John wasn’t sure what to say about that, so he patted Sherlock’s curls awkwardly.
I’m listening.
“So,” John began, putting his hands in his pockets. “Who’s your date?”
John Watson rubbed a hand across his eyes, not remembering at first where he was. Blue and yellow drapes hanging over the window? That couldn’t be right...His confusion vanished the moment he rolled over and saw the other person in the bed, and something warm and glowing settled itself in his chest. That’s right. Last night they had finally, finally...
“Right,” John said, going to the kitchen and switching the kettle on. “Have you taken your pills this morning?”
Someone giggled.
“Hmmm, don’t you though? But maybe I need it.” John leaned in closer to Sherlock and took a deep breath, curling his hands around Sherlock’s waist and pulling him forward.  “Come on, let me give ye what you need.”
“Ok. We should have some help coming, but I don’t see them yet,” John says, scanning the horizon. They’ve emerged at what looks like a small airfield, with a single runway that trails off into an overgrown grassy field, and a narrow road of crumbling cement that presumably leads to other roads that will convey them back to civilization. Or so John hopes.
“Where’s John?” Sherlock didn’t bother with a greeting. .
“I’m not crying you’re crying what the hell, Sarah“  Ok now she is crying, shit Watson what did you do that for.
Sherlock shook his head. “John, I—it’s not—can you just,” he finished, tugging at the buttons on his shirt. John nodded and stepped back a little.
And it had taken him some time, longer than he cared to admit, but Sherlock had eventually worked out that Doctor John “Not Gay” “Three Continents” Watson was bisexual.
See you in chapter 8!
John supposed that he should have asked Mike
“I’ve got the other two bottles of that mead in my coat pockets,” Sherlock grinned.
“It turns out we have so much in common,” Sherlock continued. “He’s actually quite interesting.”
Ok, that last one I was channeling my inner Holmes I bit. I admit it. I can just picture him standing my the window with that violin, punctuating his words by stabbing at the air with his bow while I read him Lestrade’s latest text, his expression at once irritated with how moronic he thinks Lestrade is being and excited about having found a clue, dictating to me because for some reason he’s decided it’s beneath him to text that day--
A cheery Scottish folk tune played for a few seconds, and then a woman began to count, pausing for a breath between numbers.
“R-right––right drawer,” Sherlock whimpered, mesmerized by the sight of John’s strong and compact body.
“What? Are you serious? I can’t go like this,” John protested.
John is embarrassed by the text messages he keeps sending even though his rational brain insists that Sherlock is not seeing them.
It’s one of those weeks again, I can already tell. I keep telling myself it’s not like last time, but the hollow feeling doesn’t listen, maybe can’t listen, and it whispers in the night or in the surgery in between patients or when I’m waiting in line at prêt-
Besides, WHEN he comes back, who knows what kind of condition he’ll be in? Could be an absolute mess, it’s happened before, and with him its usually the kind of mess that it’s best not to go to emergency with. If I’m still living here when he comes back, if it’s a mess (he’s a mess, he’s always a mess) then, well. I’m his doctor and I’ll patch him up.
Age: about forty, getting a bit portly, black suit (Westwood), black mother-of-pearl cufflinks, no tie. Shoes has been shined recently. Both suit and shoes were very clean, no traces of mud or animal hair to give him the foundations of a deduction. Very well--that in itself was telling. So someone who liked his suits very clean, who either took the care to clean his shoes thoroughly himself or with the ability to pay to have them cleaned, and the (definitely) Wedgewood suit would suggest the latter--Sherlock raised his eyes to examine the man’s face, and that was when he knew he was in trouble.
Sherlock tilted his head and looked at John intently.
Time slowed down, or maybe it sped up, and consequently Sherlock had only the foggiest idea of how long it had been when John appeared in the doorway. Sherlock set down the spray bottle he was holding.
“I’m standing here in nothing but a towel, Sherlock. I might die of hypothermia soon.”
He stood still though when he heard the sound of someone humming. The voice sounded a lot like Sherlock’s and it seemed to come from the bathroom. John readjusted the towel around his waist and proceeded to investigate.
Because if John had wanted their ...whatever it was to be more than whatever this was, he  would have done something toward that end. John had no qualms in asking people in whom he was interested out on dates. Or even picking up strangers in pubs. Sherlock had seen a preponderance of evidence that attested to this fact.
Another few moments of quiet then, before...there is is. The first shot. He doesn’t suppose that he would be so lucky as for that shot to actually hit someone, but it does. Curses, and a moan, and then three more shots in quick succession. He snaps few more photographs with his phone, zooms in on the area around the orange firelight. Two bodies are on the ground, one man standing with a semiautomatic held at ready, one man frozen in the act of fleeing into the (east, the opposite of where he thinks Interpol are) woods, one missing.
“You’re forgotten the most important thing, as usual,” Mycroft said, his words slow and precise.
“We got the mead, though, so it was worth coming here,” he pointed out.
“Is this?” John asked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s (also floury) waist and drawing him in for a hug.
John mentally remarked, the empty beer bottles still his captive audience.
John, who was behaving in the most fascinating and inexplicable manner. He smirked a little when Lestrade asked him how his evening had been, and hen refused to elaborate. Sherlock could put that down to John’s obvious danger kink, but then there was the impatient way John cut off half of Lestrade’s remarks, tried to finish his sentences, and generally acted as if he had somewhere better to be.
The experiments continue...
Sherlock opened his eyes slowly, lying on a concrete floor on his side, some objects in front of his nose...He blinked slowly. His eyelids felt heavier than they normally did and it took a bit longer than usual for the objects to come into focus.
Quit keeping secrets GL
This mess
“John?”
And so here Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective and sometime vampire, found himself lying on the floor of his sitting room at nine o’clock on a Saturday morning, feeling as warm and cosy as if he were wrapped in a wool blanket in front of a roaring fire.
Sherlock blew out a slow breath. Somehow, they were now standing on the pavement in front of the townhouse. If the suspect was at home and possessed of even a modicum of intelligence he surely would have noticed them already.
“I will, mate,” John replied as he stood up and left some cash on the table. “I will.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked down, taking in the parts of John that were no longer covered by bubbles from the spilled shampoo bottle. His face flushed--this was not in one of the three possible outcomes of the conversation that he had planned for and he wasn’t sure what to do.
“What?” John asked.
alone,” John finished. “I will hex anyone I have to hex. I don’t have to resort to shin-kicking anymore now I’ve got a wand and three years of Hogwarts under my belt.”
“You know exactly what I mean,” John said. His initial anger had cooled and he dropped into his Captain Watson voice. “You invade my bathtime and now you won’t talk to me? I don’t think so. Turn around, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock woke up several hours later, in the quiet part of the early morning when the sky was hazy and pale. He stretched lazily and stood, wrapping his dressing gown around himself before unlocking his door and peering out into the hallway.
“If you don’t want this I’m going to drink it,” John said. “I’m not much of a wine person but it actually smells pretty good.”
YES I AM SURE it is a different picture, took the damn thing myself now SEND IT TO HIM GL
Once John was safely outside of the apartment, Sherlock stuffed his phone into his dressing down pocket and vaulted over the side of the sofa. He hurried to the kitchen and started pulling bags and jars off of the shelves. He checked the time on his phone--if it took John an average of thirty minutes to walk to the clinic...yes, there should be time. He switched on the oven, then turned to the ingredients arranged haphazardly around a mixing bowl.
I’ve tried texting him, of course. I’m not dense.
“Feelings? Of what nature, John?”
“I don’t want to go back to Mycroft,” Sherlock had grumbled. The weather had turned warm early that year, and so John and Sherlock were sitting on the battlements above the Owlery.
Seasonal Fucking Cheer Ficathon day 3: " Love, Actually: That porn stunt double does not look like me AT ALL what are you on about"
“Started without me, I see,” John said, clapping Greg on the shoulder and accepting a shot glass of whiskey.
“I’ll just come back after dinner,” John uttered when he finally found his voice again.
“Survived what?” John asked. “Oh, that’s nice,” he added, finishing the mead and passing the glass back to Sherlock.
“Fine, but you aren’t going to like it,” he warned.
“Please what, Sherlock?” John whispered as he bent down to gently nibble on one creamy thigh.
“I have done this before, you know. Trained for it, in fact. The Fifth’s main assignment in Afghanistan was extracting captured noncombatants from occupied territory.” John tightened his grip around Sherlock’s waist. “Now. Are you going to be able to make it up that ladder?”
“Ha!” Mike chuffed. “You aren’t going to believe this, but
“I…you, what?” Sherlock asked, utterly bewildered.
“I just wanted to see.”
It was empty. He let out a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, then went to the kitchen and switched on the lights.
He wrapped his coat more tightly around himself and swept from the room.
The flat was dark and cold, and Sherlock wrapped himself in a blanket and promptly fell asleep on the sofa.
You must know I keep a close watch on your little friend. When he received a text message that caused him to vomit into a garbage can, I assumed you were involved and traced the source of that text. How banal, Sherlock. MH
“I’m hardly your boyfriend’s keeper, brother mine,” Mycroft replied crossly. “Find him yourself.”
“When did you..?” Sherlock held the calender out at John.
“I would be honored to be your first. If you’ll have me,” he whispered, ignoring the way his voice cracked and his stomach churned when he said the words that were so close to the words he actually wanted to say but never would.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, fine,” he relented. “Take them.”
“You fifth years are bloody lucky you don’t have classes this early,” John grumbled as he dressed.
“Can I see it?” Mike asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but shut the door gently behind himself as he left.
“Thank you for noticing,” Sherlock said. “We had to break in because I don’t think she’d let us actually look at the mistletoe, especially if she’s the killer. I want to get a good look at exactly where it’s grown, see if there’s anywhere a killer could have hidden nearby, and maybe get some more samples if there are fallen leaves or any bits I could take without anyone noticing.”
Sherlock smiled at his reflection and muttered ––
It wasn’t a bad way to spend his first days out of the hospital, and he had time to think.
Bagged blood had never done this for him. While he was working on the pills, he drank infrequently, and only the minimum amount necessary to stave off hypothermia. The blood was disgusting and had turned his stomach, and pills had seemed vastly preferable. The pills had no side effects, were tiny (might as well put that chemistry degree to use), and in a pique of whimsy, had a pleasant, robin’s-egg blue colour.
“Oh, it gets weirder. I’m actually on my way to see him now. Come on, come with me!” Mike insisted, clapping John on the wrong shoulder.
He went to the door and checked that it was locked, then turned out the lights and got into bed, tucking the covers around himself like a caterpillar, and waited to see whether he would fall asleep before the yelling stopped.
“You…you like it?” Sherlock asked, frowning. “I—I don’t understand.”
“Yes, well, we couldn’t get a cab and ended up walking most of the way here,” Sherlock said.
Here we are. Chapter 3. This one was a long time coming and if you're still reading this I really appreciate it. This chapter begins right on the heels of chapter 2.
About an hour later, John Watson trudged up the stairs to 221B. It had been a long day at the surgery.
Oh hell why’d I send that. You’re already gone. Getting sentimental, ignore. JW.
why would he do that, why would he say it the exact same way as last time he’s not random, not imprecise like that--
“Oh, suddenly Sherlock Holmes is volunteering to help with paperwork? I don’t buy it,” Lestrade said. “You are trying to distract me, probably because I’m getting close to figuring out something you don’t want me to know.” He glanced between the two of them, looking for a tell. Lestrade was fairly confident that he knew all of Sherlock’s tells after seeing him high and defenceless so many times, but this time the detective’s mien gave nothing away.
John’s next words caught in his throat. Sherlock had hinted at this before, but the confirmation stunned him.
As soon as Ryan’s back was to John and Sherlock, Mike turned around and threw a grimace at John over his shoulder. John shook his head.
“Him again!” The man dug the point of the knife into Sherlock’s shoulder, wiggling it around a little, and Sherlock whimpered. He supposed he must have said John’s name again. “You won’t even be able to think about him when we’re done here,” the man hissed, suddenly angry.
“Oh, you.” John shook his head and deposited their bags on the floor. He sat on the side of the bed and ran a hand through Sherlock’s messy hair, tangling his fingers through the curls.
“Ah, no ma’am. I mean I’m very interested in them, ma’am,“ John said. He was glad there were no other muggle-borns in this classroom. They would probably have gotten an ulcer trying to restrain themselves from laughing just as much as John.
, and caused the petal to smack John squarely in the forehead.
“Right....sorry Doctor Watson”
No sudden movements, nothing that will set off the hair trigger these morons are clearly operating on. He nudges the phone with his bad foot until it’s easily within reach. As soon as they make a move, he’ll duck down and scoop it up. Have to be able to contact John. Going silent again is not an option. (Mycroft’s irritating voice in his head demands that he explain why it is not an option. No. Shut it, Mycroft. File it away and examine later.)
“Why.” It wasn’t a question. Sherlock sprayed a few more puffs of the sodium solution into the flame for good measure.
John’s eyes didn’t know where to look. Should he focus on Sherlock’s lovely shoulders? The deep curve in his lower back? The tender swell of his buttocks? To his horror, John felt his cock beginning to react. He should probably go back to his room before ––
Something warm began to blossom in John’s chest.
“How…?” Sherlock managed to get only the first word of his question out, but John seemed to understand anyway.
“Good, innit?” Greg asked as Sherlock tore off the final bits of paper and tape.
The little vials he had retrieved from the safe where he kept his regular pills were lined up along the edge of the table in a precise row. Sherlock always opened them in the same order, always used them in the same order. There was something comforting about the constancy of their effect. What was in the vials would never lie to him, never betray him, never lead him to think one thing and then deny it vehemently to Lestrade mere hours later.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Sherlock said, a stubborn note creeping into his voice. “I’ll write to you first.” He rubbed his dripping nose on his shoulder, strangely feeling no need to extract his wet, undoubtedly slimy and disgusting hands from where John held them on his knees.
“Oh, you are
Sherlock licked away a few stray droplets and dared a glance up at John’s face. His eyes were a soft, and he flexed his fingers in Sherlock’s hair when he caught his gaze.
John watched him go, then stood in the hallway for longer than he probably should have, thinking.
After that I never brought him up, never said Sherlock fucking Holmes’ name out loud, barely even thinking his name, carefully avoiding anything connected with him, anyone connected with him. Thinking that would solve it, but apparently that made things worse, and then Mary was accusing me of pining, can you believe it? Me, John H. Watson, MD: pining? I do nothing of the sort.
Smudge on the wall above the coat hooks-left side. That wasn’t there in the earlier picture. JW
“This is hardly a kidnapping,” Mycroft pointed out. “Perhaps I fancied a…pint.” He gestured at the glass of amber ale in front of him.
Because it was always pills, never blood, and especially never fresh blood. Blood was messy, unpredictable, and quite likely disease ridden. No, the pills were better. He made them himself in Molly’s pathology lab from compounds he synthesized from scratch, a novel synthesis birthed from his desperation to avoid interaction with others, to avoid touching. The pills were perfectly calibrated to give him everything this absurd body required, they had a shelf-life of a year at room temperature, and they were smaller than a paracetamol tablet. He was a chemist, after all.
John was stunned into silence, aghast that Sherlock would bring up something he had been trying so hard to forget.
The way John smiled at Brian.
John was sitting at the table, his head in his hands. He looked up when the lights came on, and his eyes were red-rimmed and wet.
(another picture of that burnt out house from the other day) GL
“Can we not do this until after I’ve had my tea?” John asked wearily.
“It hasn’t!” Sherlock shot back. “I love potions class. I love my room in Hufflepuff tower. I’m glad I’m a Hufflepuff,” he finished, glaring at John in defiance. “I hope everyone knows it! Sherlock Holmes, Hufflepuff! I’ll tell everyone in the world!” His knuckles were white where they clutched the prickly wand, and he slowly let out his breath.
“Um,” he tried. His throat seemed to stick to itself. “I rolled over and fell off?”
“Hm. No,” Sherlock groused.
Some time later, Sherlock became aware that there was a cup of still-warm tea on the table beside the sofa, and that John was curled in his chair, gazing at him with fondness tempered with worry.
“Like...I don’t know, wearing old clothes and and I’ve probably got grass stains on these jeans, and mud on my shoes, and I don’t know what else,” John said.
John could only nod, a tingling feeling creeping up his chest.
“Can I—,” Sherlock reached out for the bottle, but John held it just outside his reach.
At first he tried not to think about Afghanistan, but of course that was impossible. Those memories rose to the surface constantly, at once blistering hot and bone-shatteringly cold. He heard cannon fire in car horns and the screams of his injured mates in children’s playground yells.
After a few minutes John cleared his throat and stepped back to retrieve what he had dropped at the door. “Right. I brought you some things,” he said, passing Sherlock his coat. “Your lock picks are in the pockets.” John continued to refuse to think about what Sherlock may have learned from his actions thus far.
“Right.” Sherlock stared at the floor. At the first stick of the needle through his skin he winced, then swallowed.
We aren’t going to make it, Sherlock realized. The blood flow had mostly stopped, but not soon enough. It would heal, but he needed his pills. He needed to get to his pills and avoid going to a hospital. John would want him to go to a hospital, though. These thoughts swirled around his mind like leaves in muddy water, and by the time the cab stopped in front of 221B Baker Street, Sherlock was shaking too hard to hide it, and John guided him up the stairs with a hand on the small of his back.
A bitter laugh escaped John’s mouth. It was probably for the best that he and Sherlock had this row. He really didn’t mean what he said earlier. He didn’t want to leave Baker Street. Baker Street was home.
“Oh for the love of--” John turned around and faced his fellow Gryffindors, apparently catching the most obvious of Sherlock’s innuendos. “Will you lot lay off? Yes, we’re, um...“ he trailed off, not sure if Sherlock actually wanted to keep this a secret. They hadn’t talked about it, after all. They hadn’t talked about much of anything, to be honest.
“Come back to bed?” The question came out a whisper, softer even than Sherlock had intended. John glanced around them, worried they might be overheard, but the corridor was empty.
He crept up to the side of the building and peered through the basement windows. The basement was an absolute disaster. There was a narrow trail winding through the basement, which seemed to be all one room divided up by enormous mounds of junk. Stalagmites made of newspaper reached almost to the ceiling, supported by heaps of pop bottles and pizza boxes.
“It’s not like him to stay out this late,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I hope everything’s all right.”
“Then why did ––“
When he awoke, he dragged his consciousness into a newly created room of his mind palace--a situation room at the Yard.
After five minutes, the familiar “This message could not be delivered” has not appeared. John throws on a coat, grabs his doctor’s bag and gun (it’s Sherlock, after all) and leaves the Baker Street apartment, unaware that he’s taking the steps two at a time. He’s not waiting for Mycroft’s damn car.
“Of course you won’t touch it,” the man continued, gazing straight at Sherlock, who refused to hold eye contact. Sherlock’s eyes darted around, searching for anything in the room that could be used as a weapon. Excluding anything concealed upon the man’s person, there was nothing in the room except for the five hateful objects in front of him and the chair upon which the man sat.
Notes poured forth from Sherlock’s violin, notes he would be ashamed for John to hear if he were here. John, he thought, and forced his fingertips harder against the strings, his knuckles whitening as he gripped the bow. A few bow hairs had broken in his fury and he knew he would regret it later, knew he would be wincing as he typed or texted for the next few days, but that was rather the point--not the notes.
In retrospect, John thought that he should have expected that the pub he chose on the simple virtue of its being the first one that he saw would already have Mycroft Holmes sitting inside a shadowy, corner booth. After so many years of acquaintance with the Holmes brothers, he should have expected that Mycroft would, by some intrusive surveillance or freaky leap of logic, be able to predict which pub John would choose before he even became aware that he was going to go to a pub. John rolled his eyes and went to the bar to get a pint.
“You don’t want a drink, you need one,” Greg insisted. “You look half frozen even with your coat on.”
This message could not be delivered.
“It—we’ve got to talk about this,” John said to Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock replayed the whole scene over and over in his mind until finally, he paused over one minor detail.
Things had begun to unravel soon after John moved back to Baker Street permanently. That morning, as he set his wedding ring on the kitchen counter and hailed a cab, carrying is army-issue duffel and a cardboard box, John had felt a sense of rightness, a certainty that finally his life was done with change and catastrophe. He would go back to Baker Street, where he felt more at home than anywhere else in the world, and he intended to poke and Sherlock until he agreed to give up drugs, and guide him through detox, and everything that had been so heart-shatteringly terrible for the past year would sort itself out. John was so absorbed in his thoughts that he barely saw London passing by outside the cab windows.
where the hell are you ?? JW
Sherlock shivered and burrowed deeper into the duvet stolen from John’s bed. He scowled at nothing in particular. It had been two weeks since their agreement and that was the longest he had gone without risking hypothermia ever since it had happened.
“I’m sorry, but…your family terrifies me,” he said at last.
Sherlock took a deep breath and released all the tension of the day with a great exhale. He then opened the medicine cabinet and reached deep into one of the upper shelves, behind a stamped, black-on-white label that read TUESDAY, where he hid a thin tube of foaming cleanser. It was an Arab brand that he discovered while on a secret mission for Mycroft in Dubai. He also grabbed a bigger tube of exfoliant. Unlike most of his exotic beauty products, this exfoliating cream was actually purchased at a nearby Marks & Spencer. He loved the self-heating formula and it always gave his skin a nice glow.
“Remind me to send Brian a ‘thank you' note,” John quipped.
“An explosion in the shed where this mead was fermented destroyed most of the batch, and I thought the rest had been drunk years ago,” Sherlock mused. “How did you get this?”
“John? Is that who you think brought you here?” The voice was amused, but there was something beneath the amusement. Something sharp, predatory. Sherlock became aware that he must have screamed John’s name. He scowled.
“I do still want to talk,” John said. “I’m—I I know I can say it won’t happen again and I’m sorry and everything but I want—I want to show you that it won’t. If you will let me. That’s the only way that will mean anything.”
“I don’t want it,” Sherlock said flatly.
John waited, a fond and curious smile playing across his face.
“We’re not really,” I say, to put this silly idea out of her head. Drain the tea, grab coat and umbrella, head towards the door.
“Hm.” Sherlock slumped against John and hummed. “You haven’t, I don’t think.”
Sherlock looked up as he finished picking the lock on his handcuffs (intolerable that he should have failed to pickpocket the key off of his idiot gaoler for so long) and glared at nothing in particular until a spot of colour on John’s (predictably awful) jumper caught his eye.
“Give me back my little pet and you’re free to go,” Cosplay Moriarty states, and Sherlock stiffens.
Thank you to Unpopcultural for the beta read and excellent suggestions, and to The Toast (this week's Ask Bear) for the phrase "goat rodeo".
Realized I never told you that I didn’t get to tell L that wasn’t you texting me earlier today--might have sent him on a bit of a fool’s errand this morning I’m afraid. JW
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed, coming back to himself. He looked out the window, thinking they must be almost there, but the cab was barely a block from Scotland Yard.
Is six months and eight days too long, he wonders? Did the last disappearance (necessary) make the situation at Baker Street more fragile than he had previously thought? Unclear. More evidence needed to make a conclusion. Need to revisit Baker Street...once/if this is ever resolved.

“I’m just…he’s seemed off, lately,” Donovan said, a little hesitant. “Just...keep an eye on him, will you? As much as he bugs me I do want him to be okay.”
“When do you normally take them?” John asked. “Do you have a schedule?”
and figure that’s as good as I’m probably going to get with my damn hands shaking so much and hit SEND
“I’m going out to the clinic to pick up some charts I need to fill out this weekend,” John said, tucking his keys into his pocket. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was curled up on the sofa in his dressing gown and pajamas.
“Mmmmf,” Sherlock hummed. “John, I…” He dabbed at the last drops welling from the small punctures with his lips, then looked up at John anxiously. “Are you…I mean….I can…..go,” he finished.
“Sherlock Holmes. Care to explain why you’re trespassing in my greenhouse?”
“Right yes, sorry,” John said hurriedly. “I shouldn’t have—I should let you sleep.”
After last time...I’m just not ready for you to be gone again. JW

Privately, Sherlock felt John was making a bit much of these burns, but he decided that this was not the time to argue about the length of the convalescence that John would indubitably force upon him.
“He’s right, I should try to be normal for five minutes and do this,“ Sherlock said. “How bad can it be?”
“Good,” Sherlock said again, and wrote “no murder” on the board. “What else?”
Checking his watch, John found that he had slept through both his other morning classes and lunch, and was now almost late for Herbology. He stood and stretched, stuffed Sherlock’s wand and his Arithmancy book back into his bag, and began the trek down to the greenhouses.
An enormous thank you to artfulinanities for reading some the parts of this chapter that I was most uncertain about and helping me talk through my weird, disorganized thoughts.
“John. I want—” Sherlock closed his mouth, pressed his nose against John’s ear. “I’ve wanted—something like this for a long time. But if it’s just about the—the drinking for you then. ” His voice dropped to a whisper again, and his next words were very faint. “Then I don’t want to do it, because it—it isn’t about that for me.”
John leaned around the corner: hallway clear. He ran to the door and put an ear to it, and when he didn’t hear anything from the other side, shot the lock with his Browning and kicked it open.
“Why are the lights out?” I don’t realize I’ve said it out loud until Lestrade answers.
“Believe me, Greg, he isn’t. He had plenty of opportunities to make that known, and he didn’t. So for the last time, fucking drop it.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” he said with a shudder. “What have I done?”
He handed it over.
But that’s not really what it is, is it, says a nagging voice in my mind. Life with Sherlock. This is only half of a life with Sherlock, half of what this life could be.
“All I know is that he’s freezing cold, and that you didn’t do a damn thing to figure out what happened to him or how or anything, so you—” John waved his hand at Mycroft, somewhat unsteadily, “can piss right off. I’m going home, because in case you didn’t know I had to put eight stitches in his arm today thanks to some idiotic hoarder-murderer, and I want to make sure he’s not gone into some kind of shock. If he can even go into shock, that is. So piss off, Mycroft.” For good measure, he reached across the table, grabbed Mycroft’s (untouched, as expected) amber ale and drained the glass in one shot.
“Nice one, Captain!” Jones, a beater on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, said, slapping him on the back.
In my mind, Watson is bisexual. I am not. While I have read up on bisexuality and read interviews with bi folks, I am likely to make mistakes while writing him. I'd appreciate any suggestions or constructive criticism on how I can write a more realistically bisexual Watson. I myself am asexual and the version of Sherlock that I write will be informed by that. I don't claim to speak for asexuals in general or really any ace folks other than myself.
What he saw inside made his heart stop.
“That’s him sorted. Now come on, Molly or someone should be along,” John says, wiping the powder burns on his fingers along his jeans. Does Sherlock’s eye follow the motion of his hands as he does, or is that wishful thinking? John can’t be sure.
“No.” Sherlock saw no reason to lie. Lestrade was being tiresome and he did not appreciate the sudden noise.
“N-no––no, of course not,” the doctor answered as he stepped aside to let Sherlock pass through the door. He followed behind Sherlock as the taller man walked into the living room.
Apparently my lack of a reply spurs Lestrade into further loquaciousness; that, or he has nothing better to do while standing at a crime scene because he’s completely forgotten how to solve crimes on his own.
“Hey,” John began, clearing his throat. When did his voice get so husky?
Thanks for reading!
“All right, settle down everyone,” Professor Sprout called good-naturedly as she entered the greenhouse. “Since everyone in here either plans to go into healing or Auror medics, we’re going to go over something that will be a major part of your day-to-day jobs: medicinal herbs.”
“I’ll always want this,” John said, ruffling Sherlock’s hair. “I’m willing to continue as long as you are.”
“As sentimental as this sounds, we’re just––we’ve lost that thing––that thing that used to make us work so well together,” John croaked, willing away the lump that was forming in this throat.
So this chapter is written as an homage to Xistentialangst's amazing fic "The Detective and the Pin-Up" which you should all go read asap because it's so, so great.
“Fucking--oh,” John said with a sharp intake of breath. “We’ve been walking for twenty minutes, Sherlock! You should have bloody well said something earlier,” he hissed, trying to keep his voice down in case any hostiles were nearby.
So where does that leave me? “I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and don’t you dare fucking leave me again?” I can’t say that to him and I can’t trust myself not to say it, can’t trust the words not to spill out the instant I see him.
Sherlock skipped the scales and the usual études that he would play to warm up his hands and launched straight into the concerto, smashing his fingertips into the strings greedily, chasing after that burn as his soft, unprepared fingertips gave way to harsh metal. There would be bruises afterwards, Sherlock knew. He crushed his raw, unprepared fingertips against the E and A, playing a triplet more roughly than the score technically called for. He hurtled through the first phrases of the tone poem, fingertips heating up as the indentations formed by the opening notes were criss-crossed by the strings as he mashed his fingers against them in slightly different positions. At the brief, three-beat rest he barely paused, taking only the shortest moment before throwing himself back into the music.
"It's fine. It's all fine," John replied, smoothing his hair. "Now, where were we?"
He was almost relieved when the man walked in the door openly carrying the knife and a filled needle. The cards were on the table, then. This was the plan: he would torture Sherlock, the entire time letting him see that the needle was there, and then at the end...oblivion, and addiction.
he was heading to meet Sherlock Holmes of Sussex Downs, but by the time it became apparent that their destination was a morgue, he felt it was too late to back out.
John was supposed to hand him his robe. He was supposed to come close enough so that Sherlock could feel his wrist and check his pulse.
“Humph. Bit inappropriate for the season,” Sherlock said. “This is a floral mead, better for summer. There’s only one person who could have gotten ahold of this vintage and had the self control not to drink it for so many years…” He trailed off and focused on Greg.
“I don’t know how to be without you anymore.”
“Ye-es,” Sherlock replied every time, because he was back on schedule with the pills, taking them regularly every morning as soon as he woke up, and every other evening before bed. Between the regular pills and the…other thing that they were doing that he did not want to think too much about, Sherlock was warmer than he had ever been since it had happened.

Thanks for reading! As the work schedule starts to settle down I'm hoping to start posting more regularly.
I tap out my reply with one finger, the rest of my hand covered in shaving cream and my razor (also covered in shaving cream) held in the other hand. Normally I wouldn’t shave just for this, but I intend to come clean to Lestrade tonight about the cases, and being cleanly shaven will make me look more put-together and credible and not insane, which is the look I’m going for, so. I shave for Greg Lestrade, apparently. Mary would have...
I glance at my phone again, and with the one finger that’s clean of shaving cream and blood tap over to the last message from him. Because that’s what it was, it has to be. I did some reading online, looked up about those messages, and there’s no reason for it to have been split in half like that. The collective wisdom of the Internet has assured me that the phone’s operating system would never have done that on its own. When the impossible has been eliminated…
Welcome back to the Seasonal Fucking Cheer 2016 Ficathon! Today's prompt is: "Inappropriate gifts: benefits and drawbacks"
“Right, that’s a laugh,” John said. “You know everything about everyone from your bloody cameras and your bloody deductions and you want to ask me questions about your own little brother?” He finished his second pint—where had that all gone? John only remembered taking one or two sips of it at the most—and stood up.
Sherlock was sulking on the sofa, silently berating himself over yet another failed experiment.
It was the sound of a key in the door that drew Sherlock’s attention out of his book. He closed his eyes, tracing John’s path through the sound of his footsteps as he shut the door and walked to the stairs. The fifth stair creaked as always, and he heard John’s bedroom door open and...not close. Ah. The fifth stair creaked again, and now John’s footsteps were coming closer. Sherlock pressed an ear to his door.
A wet, angry and half-naked John Watson followed behind him.
“I don’t know where he is, frankly” is what comes out instead of something well thought out, because it’s the truth. I haven’t seen Sherlock since he got on a plane six months ago after shooting someone who in my opinion seriously deserved it. So far I’ve managaed to put Lestrade off with endless repetitions of “he said he’d  be back soon when I talked to him Friday“ while I identify the cause of death of some poor sod (which I’m sure he already knew, there is an actual medical examiner at the police after all) and pretend I have to be at the surgery before he starts asking too many questions about Sherlock. Because I haven’t talked to him Friday, I haven’t talked to him at all in months, haven’t heard anything from him in any way that I can figure out. No emails, no phone calls, nothing at all.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and pulled the blanket more tightly around his shoulders.
“A letter you got while you were over there. Who from? Your wife? No, you don’t have one. No ring. Girlfriend or fiancée then? Possibly, but you spent the day sitting on a hill in Regent’s Park, unlikely you have a girlfriend or you’d be doing something better with one of the last warm Saturdays of the year. Family? You’re clearly not close with them because you have traces of Scots in your accent yet you live here, in London, alone.”
not coming back?
“Sorry, what?“
“What, you don’t want to talk about it in front of Sherlock? He’s hardly paying attention to either of us,” Lestrade replied. “You got off with someone, don’t lie. I am an actual detective, in case either of you forgot.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock protested. “I need to build those calluses back up anyway.”
“Cap! We’ve got people waiting!” John signed, tucked the card into an inside pocket of his coat, and went back to work.
I’m listening, Sherlock.
“He can wait,” Sherlock replied, and headed for the shower.
“Oh God Sherlock I’m so—,” John swallowed, then took a breath. “I said I wouldn’t do that. I want to show you. It scares me when you’re so cold, and knowing that I can make you warm…I want to help. Please let me,” he asked.
“You thought that I was also a vampire?” Mycroft asked, and John choked a little at the word. “No. This is something that was done to my brother, or possibly something that he chose…though I rather think…well. No matter. But rest assured that it is not some peculiarity of the Holmes line.“
Sherlock agreed. The gifts had started out silly, and quickly traversed the line from “a bit rude” to “in poor taste”, landing at “downright mean”. The two of them had claimed seats as far away from the main group as possible when the gift-giving had started, and were watching the proceedings with dwindling amusement.
He said no more than six months, and it had been eight, and what had Mycroft meant by “assistance” anyway? Something violent, that’s for sure. I’ve got my doctor’s bag and some basic first aid supplies, and my Browning, of course. Beyond that...I don’t think I’ll ever be prepared for what this life with Sherlock asks of me.
Holmes had stared at him, utterly shocked by this development, and John had shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts, before continuing in a softer, but no less angry, voice. “So you don’t get to do this. You don’t get to threaten me, Mycroft Holmes.”
There was no way out.
You know how I detest field work. A car will be at Baker Street at 7 AM to take you to Milford. It may be nothing, but if my brother is indeed missing, I have reason to suspect the vicinity of Milford. MH
“What kept you?” Greg asked. “And hand that back, you need another.” John handed over the shot glass as soon as he had emptied it, and Greg refilled it with the bottle that he was apparently carrying around.
In John’s experience, a rescue operation that seems to be going well is always about to go completely to shit. He is therefore more exasperated than surprised when a man who he immediately dubs Moriarty Cosplayer, due to his Westwood suit and slicked-back haircut,appears in front of them, waving a gun. Of course. Of course he has a fucking gun.
“We’ll be there,” John said, leaning in close to the phone. “Let me just convince this madman to eat something and we’ll be right over.”
The first warning was the garish, red velvet curtains that he saw on the corner of the...whatever it was as he peeled the paper of of a corner.
Well what do you want, sending me the same picture over and over. I’m not going to send it to him twice.  JW
“Yeah, I started recording them after the second one,” Lestrade replied. “I am an actual detective, you know. ” Lestrade tapped his phone a few times, then turned up the volume and held it up so they could hear better.
“You can tell me to stop, love. If it’s too much, we can—”
He wasn’t sure how he had managed to hold onto the card through three surgeries and transport from Afghanistan to Germany to England, but he had it still. He carried it in his jacket pocket every day and propped it up on his bedside table every evening. The edges were starting to get worn, and there were little tears in the sides of the envelope from him taking the card out to look at the picture so many times.
“J-John? W-what––UNGHHH!” Sherlock bucked and moaned when he felt John’s tongue touch the most intimate part of him. John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s thighs as he continued his ministrations, slowly swirling his tongue around Sherlock’s rim. When John finally breached the quivering hole, a loud sob tore through Sherlock, waves of intense pleasure shaking him to the core.
Sherlock stared at him.
“Oh, he’ll love that,” Mike promised. “He loves that kind of stuff. He’ll tell you your whole life history from looking at the pattern of wear on your shoes, or something. Drives most people crazy.”
“Dammit Sherlock, listen to me!” John stood up suddenly, grabbed Sherlock’s shoulder and spun him around. “You do not get to come in here and wreck my bath and then not talk about this!”
Sherlock stumbled along beside John, trying to button up his coat with disobedient, shaky fingers. John’s arm around his waist was the only thing currently keeping him standing. The past weeks at the hands of his imbecilic captor had left Sherlock weaker than he cared to admit, in both body and mind.
Dear me, Sherlock. That level of profanity a little out of proportion, don’t you think? MH
John and Sherlock are late for the Christmas party, and Greg is impatient to give Sherlock an inappropriate gift by the time they arrive.
“What?”
Reaching into one of the upper shelves behind a stamped label that read THURSDAY, Sherlock took out his latest purchase––a ridiculously expensive bottle of shimmer lotion that smelled of cherry blossoms. The lady behind the counter promised that it would give his skin an irresistible glow.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It’s not. It’s very enlightening, actually. Scottish folk tune at the beginning, but the numbers in Welsh? Because they’re numbers, John. They’re trying to make us assume something about where they’re sending from. Probably both are red herrings, and the message is coming from neither Scotland nor Wales.”
There. A light in the distance, a campfire, perhaps, in the ruins? The glow partly shielded by the crumbled stone, but that is definitely a campfire of some sort. Idiots. After all these careful months? If they were going to be this sloppy, why not do it at the beginning and spare his knees and foot (shifts weight: ankle definitely broken. Likely simple fracture, as no bone protruding. Wishing there was a medical man on this mission. But then, this wasn’t supposed to be survivable. Indend to both complete mission and survive it to spite Mycroft.)
“Yes.” Sherlock rose, wobbling on his feet a little as John stood, then leaned into him.
With a shaky breath, Sherlock nodded his consent, his pupils blown wide with arousal. John ached with love for this beautiful creature who was now choosing to lay himself bare before him. He crept up the bed, cupped Sherlock’s face in his hands, and claimed his mouth, pouring every ounce of emotion into his kiss.
Why didn’t I see this last night? The last one is different.
“Don’t be a smart-arse, Sherlock. Answer the question.”
Lestrade not buying excuses this time JW
Sherlock shrugged. He didn’t recall promising that.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock shook his head. “Yes, but not for me. Mycroft…he said we should keep this quiet. Nobody outside Hogwarts knows, really. I think he used one of the old family curses—if anyone tries to say anything about it, they won’t be able to.”
I’ve got myself into a mess with Lestrade this time, I type. I think I actually just impersonated you on purpose. JW
“Why?” Sherlock asked. “Planning to drug me and then play truth or dare?”
, Sherlock thought.
Sherlock grumbled but accepted the biscuit. “Yes, there was...a bit of a problem with the way we er. Apprehended him. Not strictly legal, apparently,” Sherlock said.
“Or are you goofing off because you feel you’re already knowledgeable enough about medicinal herbs and don’t need to be here?” The head of Hufflepuff house regarded him sternly. John was, in fact, very familiar with medicinal herbs, both the wizarding kind and the muggle kind. He had mended many scrapes and magical injuries of Sherlock’s with the wizarding kind over the past few years. As for the muggle kind... he had brought only a small stash to Hogwarts with him, but he enjoyed smoking the occasional bowl on the weekends, usually with Sherlock. He generally abstained during Quidditch season, but in the summer he tended to indulge. Sherlock, on the other hand, had no such qualms and smoked as often as he could get his hands on his preferred variety of, er, medicinal herbs.
John swallowed. He hadn’t told Sherlock about it at the time, but Sherlock’s “pestilential brother” had made the precariousness of John’s position very clear to him back in John’s fifth year, back when he and Sherlock had started the slow transition from best friends to...whatever they were now. The morning after the night when John had finally screwed up the courage to stand on his tiptoes and lean forward to press a kiss to the Hufflepuff boy’s messy curls and mumble “goodnight, love,” before turning and fleeing back to Gryffindor tower-- that morning, John had arrived at the Gryffindor table early, having spent the whole night pacing in his room, terrified that he had just utterly destroyed the most important friendship he had every had-- he had arrived early to breakfast, before most students were even awake, and had found a tall, unhappy looking man sitting in the chair next to John’s usual one. He had slid into his seat cautiously, sneaking sideways glances at the man, taking in his severe expression and green and silver striped tie.
“Sherlock, what the hell?“
“Hey, well done Cap,” Bainbridge, the Gryffindor seeker said, clapping him on the shoulder as he passed John his broomstick and practice robes.
“Good old Bart’s,” John murmured as they passed through the doorway, patting the weathered stone.
How can the last one be different? Isn’t this just some automatically generated  delivery-failure message spewed out by whatever code is behind this texting app?
Maybe I shouldn’t bury it. Maybe I should just let the cat out of the bag, so to speak. Tell him how I feel and see what he does. But the one thing that would be worse than never truly having Sherlock is losing him completely. Losing his friendship. And if he is asexual, as I suspect, he’s not going to want a relationship. He’ll leave, I can’t see any way around it, and that is the one thing I truly could not stand.
“What?”
“And I received it eleven months ago in Afghanistan,” John said. “It’s not what it looks like, I wasn’t stalking you. I just ran into Mike in the park and I was holding it because--well, I always liked looking at it, the house, with the hedges and the snow and everything--and Mike asked to see it and I didn’t want to show him because it’s a bit off, innit, carrying around a letter from a stranger written twenty-four years ago, but I couldn’t think of a good excuse not to show him and I did and then he said he knew you and was going to meet you and practically
“C’est Menton,” said the spiky-haired thug impersonating a coast guard officer (poorly fitting uniform; badge in a style two full years out of date, type of gun at the man’s hip not the standard issue). Probably sent by Mycroft to bring him in. “D’ou venez-vous?”
“Have I taken too much?” Sherlock asked, his voice laced with worry. “It was difficult to focus…I had no idea. I had no idea,” he repeated, almost to himself in wonder.
Nobody, been cordoned off. Had PCs Jones and Jones stationed out front the whole time. GL
Well did Jones-and-Jones let anybody in JW
Lestrade was not pleased when they walked into his office at five minutes before noon. Sherlock rolled his eyes when Lestrade complained about them following the letter of his instructions while still managing to be a huge pain in the arse, or something like that. Sherlock couldn’t be certain-he tuned Lestrade’s voice out almost immediately he began speaking in favour of sneaking glances at John.
What are you talking about JW
“In––inthide,” Sherlock gasped, his hips involuntarily thrusting up in the air. “Inthide me, Jawn, pleathe.”
“Look, I have to go,” John says, and hangs up on him.
Sherlock groaned and rolled over, flopping unceremoniously off of the couch and landing in a heap on the floor. He rubbed at his eyes with his hands, trying to remember what on earth could have possessed him to sleep in the sitting room rather than his large, comfortable, and most importantly private bedroom.
“You probably are,” he agreed, “but humor me?”
“Jaaaaaaawn.”
Are you sure JW
“That isn’t helping,” Sherlock commented.
, John thought as he opened the door to his flat.
“We’ve got one dead body and some kind of weird messages keep coming out all our cell phones, ” Lestrade said, his voice rising. “It’s driving me bloody crazy.”
“Oh, well I wouldn’t worry. I’m sure everything is fine and he just had a few late patients at the clinic,” Mrs. Hudson said.
“I’ll take your silence as a ‘no’ then.”
Surely John isn’t looking at his phone, now. He won’t notice the held breath, the moment of hesitation. He’s at the surgery. Probably sent that in between patients. He’ll find it later, and Sherlock’s cover won’t be ruined, he’ll still be safely hidden away in this garbage heap somewhere east of Turkey. He won’t notice the almost answer. He’s won’t notice anything.
