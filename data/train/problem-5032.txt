And the dial tone cuts in.
Cause. Yall know that hits for Jack and Dean you KNOW. Anyway BYEEE i have SO much homework i should be doing lmfao
“Yeah.” Dean nods. Smiles, trying not to remember the rest of that day. “That was fun, huh?”
“Evidence points in that direction, Dean. Yes.” Cas bites back, matching Dean’s energy and stepping to meet him, stopping a couple of inches from Dean’s face. “I know it’s a harrowing image for you—“
care less.
He viciously twisted that thought off at the pass. Something was going on, yes. But, fuck he could
It was some kind of spell. The chant that had been echoing around the forest. It had been too spooky to not be magic. And it had infected them both. Drove them to– something unthinkable.
, he supposes. It’s taking up enough space to warrant the removal of his guts, at the very least.
“Okay.” Kevin says, in a tone Dean hates. “So… Not in a sharing mood, huh?”
They hit a pothole and Kevin has to brace himself against the seat in front of him to avoid sliding off onto the floor. They planned a whole talk to have with Dean (him and Sam) about seatbelts, but there hasn’t been an opportunity yet. A good opportunity, anyways.
“Dean,” Cas says, and it’s rough too--although he’s always rough. It’s urgent, demanding, somehow. Dean realizes he’s holding Cas by the bicep. He’s
Dean screenshotted the bio and deleted the app off his phone. Then he stripped and scrubbed and tried not to throw up.
“You have three dads, and… And I’d really like to do a better job at being a… a fourth for you. If that’s something you would want.”
sorry (SLIME SPEAKING) i was moving all month and now i am physically and mentally destroyed and my meds dont work anymore. we bring you road trip boys and crying into soup!
Sam had already left the room key for Dean on the table by the door, and who was Dean to disappoint?
Dean sighs. Rolls his thumbs over the broad edges of the man's hand. Breathes out. A kiss to save Cas’ life. Maybe if Dean loved him enough for the both of them it would work. Dean clings to that and leans in, brushes their noses together.
Dean rubbed his face, grimy and too warm. He hadn’t wanted to leave Jack alone to face this, aware of what losing a dad could feel like. Especially when they tried to trade their life for yours. Cas had stepped into the spray from the monster's maw, flinging himself as big and wide as he could to keep Jack from being touched by the poison. It had worked, but he’d dropped instantly. Dean had managed to get a headshot on the freak and rushed to Cas’ side— but he was too late. Jack was already there crumpled on his knees trying to shake Cas awake.
His eyes open again.
“Like..?”
“What happened?” Dean asks, when Cas finally stops retching.
He catches a glimpse of khaki coat and it registers in him that Cas is fighting at his side, terrible and beautiful. Dean wonders if maybe, years ago, this was how they clawed out of hell together.
Dean's soul was grabby. And bitey. And clawing and brutal and full of mistrust and hurt and radiance and pain. And Cas was a giant target. His soul had raked and yanked and pulled and, in a manner of speaking, got quite a bit of Cas tucked under his fingernails.
“Sam, Dean is perfectly safe with me.”
“Dean, what could possibly be out here? Surely you’d rather be in bed?” Cas grumped as he followed.
Then Dean unwound himself and Cas eased him into his arms, resting Dean’s head on his shoulder. They stayed like that for some time as Dean’s thoughts chased around themselves in his head and he wondered why he hadn’t just run back out to his car again and left it at that. He’d felt safe in his rooms the past few days and maybe that was why as he let this man, only a few steps away from being a stranger, hold onto him and soothe his wrecked nerves.
“Well, you know, lawyering things to do.”
They were a writhing mass of pleasure as Cas fucked into Dean, his thrusts timed and angled just right, hitting Dean’s sweet spot deep inside on most thrusts. The fullness he felt was perfect as his nerves lit up with Cas’s ministrations. Desperate to come, Dean pushed back until he leaned into Cas, coming to rest against Cas’s knees, forcing Cas to hold onto him as he thrust into Dean.
Dean wasn’t exactly going to give Garth the third degree over it. He was the assistant manager of The Bunker—if he couldn’t competently cover for Garth, then what was the point? Perhaps a part of Dean was slightly insulted that Garth always checked in before his calendar highlighted times off happened.
Setting a place for Cas at the head of the table and one to the right for himself, Dean tried not to think too much on what had almost happened. It was entirely possible he was picking up on the wrong signals—
Dean had counted: three mummies (of varying accuracy), six werewolves (including Garth choosing to have a joke at himself and dressing up as one—no accuracy there), three fairies (Dean had no idea what fairies might look like), one Banshee (Eileen, who was bopping along to the bass she could feel thrumming through the room), five witches (which included Charlie), Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz (as portrayed by a cold-free Dorothy), two pumpkins (including Kevin), three ghosts (including Jo), one old school devil (that was Ash), two Frankenstein’s monsters, and finally Cas as an angel and Dean as a demon. Bobby had declined the invitation for the party and was, as far as Dean could tell from Jo, off having a scary movie marathon with Jo’s Mom, Ellen.
Awkwardly and with sweat sticking his shirts to his back by this point, Dean and Bobby angled the mattress into the rear of the tan colored van. His bed frame, dismantled, was already in the van along with the few pieces of furniture he owned. He had a key ready in his back pocket for getting in and out of The Ddraig, its gates and the building, and his new rooms as needed. They’d take a second trip to come back and get the rest of his things.
He had no idea when last a ball had been hosted in the space—after all, he didn’t even know the name of the hotel, let alone that it had existed—but he imagined glittering events filled with people who perhaps had more money than sense. There was an air about the building that it was old, genuine art deco and not some weird modern recreation. Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on how he knew this, but he’d worked a couple of construction jobs before firefighting and one had been a hotel from a similar era, but a completely different design.
“You need to understand that I don’t just mean gobbling him up like some poor handmaiden. Dean’s been through a lot. Lost a lot too. I don’t want to see him go through something like that again.”
“Just a bit!” Bobby followed him to the window. “So, you like the place?”
“Dean, you cannot be serious!” Sam howled down the phone. Or at least that’s what it sounded like to him. He suspected Charlie must have said something to Sam since that morning, but Dean didn’t feel that betrayed. It wasn’t like Sam could stop him, and if he hadn’t wanted him out of the house so soon, Dean wouldn’t have even considered it.
When Dean returned with the tools that had once been Bobby’s, Dean set up his power extension and started plugging in what he needed. Cas continued to sit with his back against the counter, eyes looking anywhere but at Dean. He looked sad and dejected, like he was embarrassed that his condition had sprung up on him like it had.
Dean pulled off his gloves and pushed the goggles back. “Do you mind if I head over to Bobby’s? Then I’ll have access to all manner of tools.” He hoped Bobby wouldn’t mind the early evening intrusion.
“We’re ready,” Cas announced from behind them and Dean nodded as did Jack.
“At least they’re not getting married yet,” Dean pointed out. “I never understood people getting married before living together for a spell—you have no idea if they’re someone you can even live with and you’re signing a legally binding contract with them, essentially.”
But something about the “wards” was making him wonder at how he seemed to be the only one unaffected by them. It wasn’t until he’d finished scanning two more books that he set down the hand reader and walked over to where Cas was just finishing yet another book.
The kettle started to whistle and Dean took it off the stove top. He poured the water into a mug, peppermint teabag waiting and set Cas’s mug down. Dean went over to the coffee pot and poured himself a fresh cup and left it black. Taking the drinks over to the couch, Dean looked over to his desk again and shook his head at himself. He set the drinks down on the coffee table and settled against the couch cushions. Sons of Anarchy was still playing on the screen, but he didn’t recognize where the characters were.
“So tight,” Cas said, inching back and then thrusting forward. The movement jostled Dean and made him see stars. He was relaxed as he could be, but Cas seemed to relish Dean’s tightness. He put a hand between Dean’s shoulder blades, and held him in place as he reached down and around Dean, a hand easily wrapping around Dean’s leaking cock.
“What about you?” Cas eventually asked.
When Dean reached a cashier, he was looking at a bill that was significantly smaller than rent would be in nearly any corner of the continental US, though not necessarily cheaper than a night at a skeevy motel. But he paid up and took his bags of little podiatry-cum-pedicure luxuries back to the hotel.
Dean nodded. “I know… mind if I use the workshop to fix up furniture?”
Sometime later, Dean was vaguely aware of Cas moving around him and cleaning them up, before drawing Dean underneath his comforter. Dean was finally pulled into something resembling sleep.
“Hold it,” she said firmly, tearing her eyes away from the screen. “How’d the apartment viewing go?”
“Yeah, go for it. If we don’t like it, we can always pick something else.”
Dean paled. “A sacrifice?”
Turning his attention back to the front entrance, two towering doors set into the front of the hotel, with more pillar-like details, he knocked on the door.
Cas followed him. “Yes. Though I am surprised you can see them.” Tilting his head to the side and squinting, it felt like Cas was studying him.
“Okay, just slide your left foot a little closer to the side of the tub,” Dean directed. Cas complied and Dean reached out to the end of Cas’s little toe with his right hand while his left supported the nails on that foot. Bringing the toenail clippers to the tip of the off-white keratin, Dean set the clippers with a small slither of nail going between the mouth. He pushed down on the clippers, expecting a click and a “ping” as a slither of nail rebounded from the bathtub’s side.
. Dean headed off out and met up with Bobby outside the main entryway. Five minutes later they were slowly taking the mattress up the central staircase, Bobby and Dean both huffing and struggling as they managed the many stairs.
“Alright, Cas, I’m gonna try the clippers first at the ends. I need you to hold as still as you can, but, like let me know if it hurts at any point, okay?” Dean knelt down beside the bathtub.
“I can do Monday at 4 pm, like normal?”
Sam hummed and ummed down the line, his indecision and lack of faith driving Dean slowly mad, and eventually said, “Okay, Thanksgiving at yours.”
, Dean thought with a chuckle.
Dean just nodded to that and continued eating. They finished their meal in silence and didn’t say much to each other as they cleared their dishes away. Back in the kitchen, Dean got a beer from the fridge and offered one to Cas, who took it with a “thank you” and then led Dean back through the hotel. They started towards the foyer, but then Cas stopped in front of a doorway that Dean hadn’t really noticed before. It was closed and Cas drew out a key on a chain from around his neck and unlocked the heavy set dark lacquered doors. He pushed them open and Dean followed Cas inside.
For some reason, Sam hisses and instantly relents.
“This is about Jack?” He asks, hesitant.
Dean’s face burst into flames.
Dean inhales, deep and desperate. The arcid after-scent of vomit lingers around them and it pulls him out of his trance.
Briefly, Dean entertains the notion of Cas sitting straight up, eyes bright and patient. Thoughtful. They would rest on them each in turn. One by one. He’d murmur a question, what the problem was— how he could help. How he could fix it.
Dean washed his hands and then set to work making hot drinks. Pulling out the grounds from the refrigerator, and getting the filters from a cupboard overhead, Dean tried to focus on the work problem that had made him push away from his workstation in the first place. But as he reached for the box of peppermint tea in the cupboard, he just couldn’t think about work.
When Dean had needed help, Sam had come for him in Michigan and brought him all the way home to Sioux Falls. Driving a rental there and driving the Impala back with his few things. But a year was a long time, and Dean knew Sam had likely found “the one”—what Sam and Eileen had was something he didn’t want to get in the way of, in spite of the envy that was starting to creep up on him. But whether he moved to The Ddraig hotel or somewhere else, it was going to be a change. And Dean wasn’t historically great with change, though there was no way he’d move back to Lawrence, Kansas to live with their parents again.
Dean looked around. There weren’t any more customers yet and he was ahead of his morning opening chores. Plopping himself down on the empty chair at the table, Dean grimaced and sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. Charlie was the only other person, bar Dean, who knew that Dean sometimes “saw” or “felt” things that no one else did. It was kind of hard for her not to know, after the one time she’d invited Dean and Sam along to a Moondoor Live Action Replay (LARP) weekend she was taking part in and hosting. The lake near the event had a tragic past and Dean had seen an echo of it.
Dean dove out of the corner and spotted his boots, he grabbed them and dashed towards the doorway leading out of his bedroom. He rushed out of his rooms and out into the corridor beyond, then made for the stairs. He took them two at a time, legs pumping all the way as he did. In less than a minute, he was outside in the cool morning air, trying to unlock the Impala. But he couldn’t find his keys.
it was Garth?” Cas asked, voice sounding puzzled.
“It’s pretty awesome,” Dean agreed.
Dean grabbed the keys and with shaking hands, tried to open the door.
Dean took a moment to think back to their Dungeons and Dragons session the night before and considered how tough the squid had been. “Just right. Fair challenge just as we thought we were high and dry.” Dean grinned to himself.
Charlie rolled her eyes and got up from the couch. “So, when are we going to have a session over yours?”
“Guy’s got a strong grip,” Sam said in a surprised voice as they made their way over to what would be the main desk.
Dean turned to Cas, and at the same time that Cas turned to him. Castiel’s eyes threatened to swallow Dean up and yet he couldn’t quite bring himself to turn away as the air between grew warm with their breaths. Dean licked his lips and Cas’s eyes flicked down to track the movement and then flicked back to Dean’s gaze. Maybe it was the rush of emotions that Dean had been through in the past twelve hours, the horror, shock, surprise and earth shattering revelations, or the simple fact that Cas—with his any every which way hair, piercing azure eyes, just right stubble and what was clearly a well defined body underneath his slacks and shirt—was sexy as fuck, but Dean didn’t want to move out of Cas’s space.
Dean rolled his eyes and pouted. “Yeah, well, I’ve been busy.”
Worried, Dean headed on into the east wing and followed Jack towards the ballroom.
Dean didn’t need to get anything for his costume, he’d finished working on that the weekend before, but the store was doing good business as last minute Halloween purchases were rung through the checkouts at alarming speed. Tailing behind Sam, Dean sent an email from his cell to Cas, with details of who the remaining guests were and links to their Facebook profiles. Cas was in charge of finishing the spell, Dean was in charge of making sure Sam didn’t kill his bank balance.
“Cas what are you going on about? Are you about to tell me you’re some kind of uber ghost? Because if you are, you’re the exact opposite of every ghost I’ve encountered. You have a pulse and body heat for one.”
“Cool. I’ll be back in a few hours then.” Dean headed out and pondered, just for a moment, what Cas had done for this insane toenails previously.
“Sure,” Sam said, expression tight.
Sam’s face went briefly pale and then he recovered himself. Clearing his throat he said, “Right,” and ducked his face back into whatever photocopies he was busy highlighting the heck out of. Dean chuckled and headed into the kitchen, pronouncements on Castiel’s suitability paused for the time being.
The intercom speakers sprang to life.
He looked nothing like a guy who had freakishly long toe nails that needed such high level trimming as to warrant free rent. He looked like a handsome man sitting in a sunroom.
Dean shook his head. “I dunno. But suffice to say, I ain’t going to rent there.”
“Dean,” Cas reached out and touched Dean’s arm lightly, “You’re tired. I’m tired. Perhaps it’s time we call it a night, hm?” Without waiting for Dean, Cas bustled away and started leaving things in order for when anyone next started to scan.
The bed shifted as Cas stood up. Dean grumbled about being cold and Cas covered him in a comforter.
Dean saved his rooms for last. He unlocked the door and herded Sam inside.
“He’s had plenty of opportunity and hasn’t, Sam,” Dean finally replied.
But meeting Castiel’s eyes, Dean’s was treated to a beaming smile from his strange new housemate. “Why, thank you, Dean. Yes, I have worked hard to bring together my collection.”
Dean prided himself on always being on good terms with Garth. But after finding out his boss was a werewolf? Garth coming in for his first shift since Dean had last seen him, a quiet run-of-the-mill Sunday by any other measure? Dean had the worst poker face. Which was difficult for him, because normally he had the best of poker faces.
Castiel gently bit his lips and relaxed. “The Ddraig.”
Jack had already tried to leave the hotel and failed to do so, but he was still looking on the bright side. “So, now we know for a hundred percent that one of the spells found worked. We just need to finish getting everything for the one binding me and Cas here, right?”
, Dean considered as he looked to one corner and then spotted a full set of armor that looked like it was more than 600 years old.
Cas gave Dean a sympathetic look before reaching over Dean to stop the shower.
“Okay, look, I’m just gonna move you a little so you can lean against here…” Dean gently pushed and dragged Cas so he was leaning against the cupboard doors of a nearby counter. “And I’m going to go and get my tools. I’ll be right back.”
“Are you going to eat me?” Dean looked around for something he could use as a weapon, there was nothing.
“Hey, Dean, Mrs Henderson’s here!” Garth called from the front to the backroom and kitchen.
“And he’s like, not going to eat you, right?” Sam asked for what must have been the ninth time since Halloween and the big dragon reveal.
“I wanted to drop off a care package for you. You’re like never sick, y’know. I was really worried,” Dean continued. “I heard some noises coming from the basement. So, I went to investigate and, and…”
Dean shook his head. “Stay put for now.”
“This Charlie, she’s the one who already knows you can see ghosts?” Cas asks.
Dean knew he was looking at the time there. “Yeah, man, it’s past work time. C’mon, time to have a beer and binge some TV.”
“I better finish these yams.”
“Charlie, it is good to finally meet you,” Cas greeted.
“But Ger might know where that cave is!” Dorothy piped up. Her character was a wheeling-and-dealing dwarf rogue who liked to find ways to fill her pockets with gold and jewels as often as possible.
. Though Dean knew Cas was more than that.
“People to see.”
“Okay, the choices are…” Sam paused for dramatic effect and then began to run down the movie night shortlist. “
“So, Wisconsin?” Dean guessed, thinking of the trip that had led Dean in charge of the store with Aaron for a few weeks, rather than days.
Charlie giggled nervously. “And you expect me to believe that Castiel here is a dragon?”
Dean found himself being chased by messages from Sam. There was no respite, even when the two of them were meant to be busy at their respective jobs. The planning session on the previous Saturday had only led to Sam running away with ideas and letting them multiply like rabbits. The only details Dean cared about was his own costume, what food he was going to prepare and getting everything together for easing the wards on the hotel—which involved him getting photos of all the guests and plus ones they expected. He was planning on printing out profile pics from Facebook, but Charlie didn’t have a Facebook and so he needed to get her to provide something for them to use.
Jogging his mind back to their preternatural problem, Dean frowned. “Where do we even start looking for information on that sort of thing?”
Cas softened and pulled them closer, and the rest of the room melted away for a while, as Cas’s arms wrapped around his and Dean rested his head on Cas’s shoulder.
Waiting for the coffee maker and the kettle, Dean looked over to his new workstation area in a far corner of the living room.
“Fine. I’ll let Eileen know.” Sam smiled. “Look… thanks for not being weird about this.”
“Ah!” Dean yelped as his horns got caught in Cas’s halo, pulling at his hair.
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?” Dean asked, setting the tray down.
The Ddraig slowly revealed itself to Sioux Falls, as they wound down the spell that had kept it shrouded from the world. But Cas’s status as a dragon remained known only to Dean, Charlie, Sam, Eileen and Jack.
“I know.”
The third difference was that while Dean was still working at The Bunker, covering Garth whenever the full moon was due, he had also befriended the baker who supplied them. Benny was a vampire and had a wicked sense of humor that Dean allowed himself the chance to appreciate.
Heading back over to the altar, Dean picked up the reverse incantation and went through it. One awkward word of Latinat a time. As he finished, the air felt charged with electricity and then there was a popping sound. Dean set the notes down and found Cas was human again.
“But I couldn’t even warn you or anything. I couldn’t even get myself out of there!” Cas whined. “Now Eileen knows something is up.”
It took another hour for Sam to calm down, robbing them of valuable setting up time. But Dean took it as a good sign when Sam offered to take part in the scanning exercise when he was free next. Eventually, the three of them left the east wing, the wards adjusted correctly, and shut Jack away safely, locking the doors behind them, making sure the warning notices were visible. Cas even found some barriers to set up in front of the doors as well.
only it’s with vampires!”
And if being welcome to all meant that Dean spent fifteen minutes a week sitting with Thomas and his mom—so be it. Dean sipped his water as Mrs Henderson cut Thomas’s brownie into equal chunks. Once that had been done, she pushed the plate to Thomas and, without looking up from his train and with a brief pause, Thomas said “thank you” and took his first bite. Dean met Mrs Henderson’s eyes and smiled.
“The moon is beautiful,” a young, unrecognizable male voice said from Dean’s left.
“Hey, it’s not a problem for me, okay? I’m doing better. Honest.”
Dean thought) and trying to find out from Dean what his costume was. To which Dean would reply, “You’ll find out tonight.” From the need for fake blood, Dean knew that Sam was swapping his plaid and jeans for a vampire costume.
“I understand.”
Sam shrugged. “It’s Friday and it was just too loud back in the office. Someone on floor five was making a meal out of the start of their bachelor weekend and trying to get everyone involved. Did not want a part of that.”
Setting down the cloth he was using to clean the counter, Dean gave Garth his attention, resisting the urge to cross his arms across his chest like he was trying to protect his organs. “Sure.”
“Why aren’t you like, covered in scales and shit? How are you looking human?”
Dean held up a hand to stop Charlie as she rose from her seat. “Eileen’s moving in. And anyway, I’ve been looking for somewhere almost as long as I’ve been living with him. It’s no big deal.”
“Right.” Intellectually, Dean knew this was the better course of action the day he’d had. But it didn’t make Castiel’s rationalizing any easier to accept.
“How many books do you have on this stuff anyway?” Dean asked, realizing too late that he’d provided no context. “I mean, books on magic and stuff.”
“But, the tray,” Dean said pathetically, not letting go, meeting Cas’s eyes.
Hilariously, despite being a lawyer, Sam did pirate films on a semi-regular basis. A friend of his from school tended to get him releases before they were out on disc or available to stream. But if Sam liked the film enough, he’d buy it on disc when it did finally come out. His DVD collection had become a Blu-ray collection and was slowly growing. Though he only ever streamed shows like Deep Space Nine, because of the hack job that had been done with the DVD release and screwing with the screen ratio so badly—a point that Dean would passionately go on about if given half a chance, a mistake Sam never tried to make twice. But still sometimes did when he made an offhand comment about something they were watching.
Dean thought.
“I had hoped that my warning about the east wing had been sufficient, but clearly not. He can’t leave it,” Cas explained. “He’s bound to that place and I can do nothing about it.”
“Seems so.” Dean sighed and looked towards the door as more customers approached. “Listen, I better get back to work. I’ll text you later.”
“Cas?” Dean called through the gap, but heard nothing back.
Scrambling out of the front door, unable to hit the exit button fast enough, Dean raced outside and reached the side of the Impala. The air was warm and there was no wind, not even a breeze. Bent over, Dean sucked in big lungfuls of air and tried to get himself composed. The street was pretty much empty, bar him and so there was no one to see his freakout. It took a while, but slowly his heart slowed from a heart attack to a gentle jog and Dean straightened up to look back at the converted warehouse-cum-apartment building.
, Dean kept repeating to himself until he reached the ballroom. When he did, he saw Cas through the open doors and in the dimming daylight, Dean could see the markings on the floor that he had missed when he’d last been here at night. And then his vision focused and he could see Jack too, standing in front of Cas as they conversed.
“Pretty good. Though one student deleted the class’s entire file server on Monday, so that was fun. The good thing was that I had all their work backed up for them. The bad news? That didn’t include that lesson’s work. So, tomorrow, the first year AP class is going to be redoing Monday’s work.” Charlie sighed and started walking towards the tables. “But they’re good kids.”
Cas stopped stirring. “Hm, now that you say it like that, that would likely be insufficient. I assume you only read English?”
Now that Dean had Cas’s foot in his lap and was cradling it as he held it in place to let him work, Dean’s brain started to catch up with not only how bizarre his first evening in his new place was turning out to be and at the same time how holding Cas’s foot as he was the closest he’d gotten to another human being in months. Swallowing, Dean tried to focus on the task at hand—fulfilling his end of the contract he’d signed. So, he took the file and started on Cas’s right big toe, pushing the file along the length of nail, from the edge to the center of the nail. Push and lift. Push and lift. Over and over.
Cas nodded. “Yes… they can cause unexpected changes in… werewolves. Even when it’s not yet a full moon.”
“Sure,” Dean said exasperated and sat down at the counter they had set up as a breakfast bar. Perched on a stool, Dean tried to figure out how he was meant to handle knowing that not only ghosts were real, but dragons too.
Dean stayed by the door, leaning against the wall there. “Yep. Gonna take me a while to get some furniture together, but I’m alright for now.”
“Really, Cas?!” Dean griped, the sudden weight of Charlie in his arms making them ache.
Dean looked to Cas, who was giving him the full concerned look, all frowns and pursed lips. It was cute.
Cas set a cup of fresh coffee down beside Dean and then a plate of food.
Sam sighed, and Dean imagined Sam putting his fingers to his forehead and closing his eyes, like he normally did whenever he was feeling slightly stressed out. By this point, however, Dean was getting tired of Sam questioning everything about Cas. He knew Sam only had his best interests at heart, but he was annoyed that Sam had seemed more concerned about Cas than the whole fact that Dean had been seeing ghosts for years.
“Happy?” Dean asked Sam.
“I think you should get the chance to have a Christmas present as well,” Cas said, voice husky and full of so much promise. Grabbing Dean by the hand, Cas almost pulled Dean’s arm out of its socket as he dragged Dean back towards the hotel proper.
Cas didn’t reply, just shook his head to himself and went back to the newspaper he’d been reading.
“Yes.”
“You said you had something to talk to me about?” Cas asked.
“Just answer the question.”
Stack of pancakes beside him, freshly made blueberry syrup dripping from the top, Dean flicked through the auction listings he was looking at on his tablet. Charlie had set him up with a Tor browser, because what they were looking for was not available on normal, every day websites and more likely to be found in a corner of the dark net—a corner that happened to cater to practitioners of magic.
. I see stuff no one else does. Hear stuff. Feel stuff no one else does. I’m always one move away from going full
Dean locked the car and led Charlie towards the entrance. “We’ll see.”
“Dean, it is the middle of the night,” Cas pointed out in an unimpressed voice still groggy with sleep.
After the first week of December (and three shifts in a row covering for Garth as he spent a long weekend being a werewolf), it became apparent to Dean that unless they actually managed to free Cas (and Jack) from the hotel, then he wouldn’t be going back to Lawrence to spend Christmas with his parents. The rhythm he and Cas had established, the long evenings and weekends together, caught up in each other’s thoughts and activities was all too consuming to just spend a week or more away from Cas. Not that Dean knew if Cas felt the same way—he’d been too scared to ask.
“You could say that.” Garth flexed his hands, cracking his knuckles.
Eventually, some part of Dean’s actual brain kicked in and he broke eye contact with Cas, swallowing hard as he did.
“I am.”
“So, look, I’ve been thinking, you know what we haven’t done in like a million years? Halloween party. A big one. Costumes. Food. Booze. The works. Like when I was 17,” Sam rushed out. “You know, that big ass party we had when Mom and Dad went away to see Gram and Grandpa Campbell?”
, such was the luxury and attention to detail that surrounded him in the space. He walked towards what he assumed was a front desk—a mixture of black lacquered wood and pale off-white panels.
Dean called out an “okay” and stowed his cell away. He washed his hands and headed back out to help. Mrs Henderson was a regular customer whose autistic son Thomas would only sit quietly and calmly at The Bunker if Dean joined them. He picked up the drinks and cake that Garth had already arranged for them on a tray—an apple juice box for Thomas, large black coffee for Mrs Henderson, and a glass of water for Dean, plus chocolate brownies for Thomas and his mom—and headed on over to their usual corner spot.
That is, he pushes his dick into Cas and fucks him against the tree without mercy or slowing. Cas almost yanks his hair out and Dean is practically drooling with it, mouth open and frantic— painting wet into the thick muscle just before Cas’ shoulder, ruining the angel’s dress shirt.
But… The gore left behind. It was… brutal. Inhuman.
Sam does another kind of wrinkly frown, but this one means he's thinking.
Silent.
Castiel can tell the moment everything went wrong.
“Maybe it’s his birthday,” Harris says, mostly as a joke, but it makes him kinda sad so he immediately averts his eyes to the task at hand.
Right. This was the start, anyway. The start of being good enough.
And he doesn’t want Sam anywhere fucking near the wrongness that is screaming inside him. Urging him and tugging at him to do something bloody and brutal. His vision swims and Sam is still there. Still refusing to move. It feels like all of his teeth are loose and garbled in his mouth, like his bones are breaking in fistfuls and all he wants to do is rend.

. That doesn’t usually stop him from calling people. Calling… friends. Even if he’s somehow irreparably fucked up their friendship which— let's face it— he’s done with basically all his friends. The few people he’s ever called friends. The fewer still who had survived knowing him.
“Not communicating? Or listening? Or trusting each other to know what's best for themselves? Or-“

“I’ll say I learned more about women through life experience.” Dean waggles his eyebrows, “I could even offer to teach
Dean comes in from outside, the temperature difference taking it’s time to sink into his skin. He gets to the table, eyes locked on Jack. Jack looks up from his massive pile of pancakes and gives Dean a hesitant smile, so much smaller than it normally is that it snaps Dean's heart clean in half.
“Come on, Sam. You’ve seen worse than this.” Sam rolls his eyes at that.
Cas’ eyes drift, and the flower he had contemplated earlier stands— smushed into the sidewalk, ground to spring green paste. He wonders if Leliel saw it before the flash of grace took them, lightlocking their vision in a dazzling last sunburst. So bright you couldn't tell between light and dark: just the lack of everything else.
Charlie trying a half-shaved bob look—best poker face. Sam trying out cooking meatballs for the first time—best poker face
“This is some collection,” Charlie said a little breathily. “There, uh, anything you’re hoping to find out in particular?”
“Hours to bill.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not most people,” Dean griped, still trying to get the key to work in the lock.
Dean cleared his throat and met Cas’s eyes. “That whole toenails thing, that a dragon thing?”
Dean studied the loaf and-a-half that remained. “I’m sure we’ve got enough.”
Dean thought as they started gearing up for the mid-morning wave of customers. Usually stay at home parents with little ones needing to get out of the house.
“Can you get some shoes and a jacket, I need to show you something,” Dean said, pulling his own down-filled jacket on.
“Okay, okay. Talk soon.”
“And… I found a room on the third floor that was empty, overlooking the fountain outside. Would that be my room?”
Once everything was in pieces and Dean’s toolbox was there, Bobby helped him put things back together. It was easier to hold the sides of the bed together when there were an extra pair of hands available. They worked quietly and quickly, but once his bed, chest of drawers and side table were put together, Dean felt dwarfed by the space around him. He eyed the doors to the closet in one corner and wondered how he’d ever have enough clothing to fill it.
“What about it?” Dean returned.
“Say, I didn’t get you a moving in present. Is there anything I could get you?” Sam asked. “This is like an entire apartment, and then some, to fit out.”
“Yes.”
Sam pushed the bedroom door open, laptop cradled open in his arm. “So, get this… Can’t find any outstanding warrants for Castiel, or pretty much anything. The hotel has been there since the 1920’s! But there’s little on file about it. It’s like it disappeared, but obviously not. About the only things of note is an unexplained death some time in the 1980’s, some poor kid, but it was never treated as foul play. The reports? Less detail than usual. But my guy doesn’t think it’s really anything to worry about,” Sam finished, breathing hard.
No one fainted.
Cas shook his head. “No, thank you.”
That stopped Dean in his tracks. Despite his conversation with Charlie that very morning, she had not mentioned anything about their Dungeons and Dragons group or messaged him about it. Dean had joined one with Charlie and her girlfriend, Dorothy, plus a small group of friends who had slowly become Dean’s friends, not long after Dean had come to Sioux Falls. They played every two weeks and next Friday would be their next session.
for the third time... in two years.
Cas nodded.
“Fine.” Dean crossed his arms over his chest, ignoring the cup of black coffee he’d poured for himself.
“Sorry,” Sam said, poking his head into the living room. “The shit hit the fan with one of our clients and I had to scramble some papers together.” He sniffed. “Is that lasagna?”
“She better do, after giving us both a heart attack, because there’s no way I’m learning ancient Greek or Latin to help with this mess.” Dean hefted Charlie into his arms in a bridal carry and shifted her out of the library and in the direction of a small lounge close by.
“This is the library.” Cas walked to a bookcase in front of him, setting his beer down on a small table beside it. “I have books from all over the world here, in dozens of languages, including many ancient ones.”
Dean pressed down again.
Cas held out his right hand and Dean took it in his, carefully leaning over the side of the chair. They shook and then Dean headed on out, concerned slightly with how Cas might get around once he was gone.
Dean led Sam back to his and Eileen’s room first. Then went to the floor he and Cas were living on. Sure, it was the middle of the night, but Dean quickly realized that he couldn’t wait until actual morning to give Cas his gift. He reached Cas’s room out of breath and knocked on the door several times. Eventually Cas came to the door, with his sleep tousled hair, and blearily looked at Dean.
Secondly, Dean had found ways of handling ghosts that were different to Jack. The ones who seemed like echoes of their deaths or spirits out for revenge. And he sometimes went out to exorcise them, including the presence at the apartment that had haunted him in what seemed like a different lifetime.
Instead of his tongue returning, Cas climbed off the bed, making Dean whine in the back of his throat. Cas shushed him as he moved around his nightstand and then returned with a bottle of lube. Pumping some of the cool, slick liquid onto his right index finger, Cas then knelt between Dean’s legs. He placed his left hand on Dean’s right hip and then started to press his lubed finger slowly inside of Dean.
“And then I need to pick up a few things for helping you out.”
“Yeah. And it went a little sideways. I’m fine by the way, thanks for asking, just figured it was easier all round if I bought Bobby a few new things.”
Gulping, Dean shifted where he sat, trying to discreetly move his dick so that his arousal wasn’t obvious as he finished up with Cas’s right foot. Sneaking a look at Cas, he could see that his cheeks were flushed, much like the warmth Dean felt in his own.
Cas worked on getting everyone coffees as Dean worked on pie, and then they all pitched in together to make the rest of the dishes for Thanksgiving dinner they’d eat later, taking advantage of The Ddraig’s industrial kitchen. Over the course of the late morning and early afternoon, more of their friends turned up, including Charlie and Dorothy, Ash, Garth, Bobby, Jo, Ellen and even Kevin, who hadn’t gone back home for the holiday. Everyone brought food ready to warm up, chill or make. The kitchen became a huge hub of activity, with Dean grateful that they had the space they did.
He locked himself in his rooms, food forgotten for the moment, as he dumped everything and jogged into his bathroom, locking the door behind him. He’d at least set out towels for himself ahead of time, but Dean got the shower going in its cubicle near his own huge bathtub, and got in. The water was cold and he kept it that way.
Dean gave Sam a thoughtful look. “Well, I don’t have a table and chairs or anything like that.”
Dean’s jaw twitched a fraction. “Nah, just Cas and me.”
Dean’s gaze followed Cas’s. “That why you’ve got such a good fire system, hm?”
Dean tried to think back on the few dates he’d had since moving in with Cas and realized that it had been more than a year and that was with his ex, Lisa. He still talked with Lisa, but that ship had sailed. Looking around the apartment, Dean saw the blank walls in their communal space and wondered what had he been doing with himself for the past year.
“I have only your word to go on here. It’s not like I can talk to anyone else to vouch for you.”
Dean gave a small chuckle and said, “Live Action Role Playing. You pretend, with a bunch of other people, to be fictional characters and you sort of make believe at playing those characters. Like, I’m this fighter who’s skilled in swordplay and a few other things. I’m Charlie’s ‘handmaiden’ in game. She plays a magic and sword wielding queen. We act as our characters, fight monsters, party, solve puzzles—it’s pretty fun.”
Nothing.
“Oh dear,” Cas said forlornly. Dean looked at him and saw a look of worry and confusion there/
“I am thankful for Cas,” Dean said simply, gazing into Castiel’s eyes.
“Dean…”
“Yeah. I don’t know how big of a but, but Charlie would need to come here to help with it. And… to make it easier she would need to know what we’re up to. Because then she’ll have an idea of how to help us frame searches when everything is scanned.” Dean looked hopefully at Jack and Cas. “Well, what do you think?”
“Dude, you seem pretty okay with me being able to see ghosts and think that a ghost lives in this place, so I think we’re pretty well past that.”
“Yes, I think I have a way for us to look through all your books,” Dean explained. “So we can help both you and Jack.” That got their attention, so Dean continued. “My friend Charlie, she’s a computer whiz, and she thinks it would be possible to digitally scan all of the books in the library and match it up with existing translators. And those we don’t have? We could probably build out ourselves. It’ll take some time, but it would make everything more accessible…”
Garth nodded eagerly and hung his apron up on the peg it usually stayed on. “I’ll let you know if… if I can’t make it on Friday.”
“Like… bolt cutters? Maybe a saw? Sandpaper? It’s up to you, but I could try to get some surgical tools, though I’m not sure how I’d get those either.”
Sam looked away for the briefest second, a cloud of regret on his face, before turning back. “If it’s too much, too soon, you don’t have to. I’m sure we can figure-”
The usual mid-morning Tuesday crowd flicked through newspapers and sipped their drinks as Dean finished putting the latest load of grounds in a used beans bag. Looking up from the bag before sealing it, he caught Garth staring at him weirdly from the corner of his eye. He turned and looked at his boss.
“What about Jack?”
Dean gave Cas an appalled look. “Fine, you deserve to party. But we should probably find a way to at least make sure people can make their way here without me having to drive every single person. Or else I ain’t getting to drink.”
“Dean,” Cas tried again, but Dean wouldn’t look at him.
“Of course,” Cas replied, voice thick. “And perhaps free me of being bound to the hotel?”
Dean pulled back the clippers from the nail and set them down beside him on the white tiles of the bathroom floor. He picked up the nail scissors he’d bought as well. He hadn’t wanted to rely on them, because the control would be less than the clippers, he’d only wanted to use them for awkward bits. Positioning the scissors with a small section of nail set in them, Dean closed the scissors. Or at least he tried to, but the scissors wouldn’t cut the nail either, instead acting like Dean was trying to cut rock.
Dean watched as if in slow motion as the cutters bit through the impossibly tough nail and sent a short rectangle of white pinging off of the side of the tub and rebounding several times before it settled somewhere in the bathroom. Looking around, Dean found the piece of nail near the tool bag and picked it up. He held it towards Cas.
“Drive? What, oh, yes. It’s impossible. Walking is also incredibly difficult. But if I’m also being honest here… I can’t actually leave the hotel and its grounds.” Castiel looked away, cheeks coloring. “It’s quite embarrassing really. I, uh, can’t, you see.”
Dean huffed out a breath and picked up a towel to dry his hands with. “Of course I do… But, just so you know, I think I won our bet.”
“Dean,” Sam said firmly.
Dean watched Cas walk away and back into the hotel.
“Dean… what happened?” Cas asked quietly.
“Then you finally get to grow old and live your best life while doing it.” Dean smiled and wished he could pat Jack on the back.
Driving back to the hotel without having to help Bobby get there was easy as pie for Dean. He thought it strange as he pulled up at the parking space set aside for him within the hotel’s grounds. Still, it wasn’t the strangest thing that had happened to Dean recently and the streets around The Ddraig were all very similar and maybe the street signs weren’t as clear as they could be. Dean didn’t think for a moment about the fact that Bobby had a decent sense of direction and was the one who kept everyone on the right forest paths when they used to go out camping in the summer.
It didn’t matter how many times their younger son, Sam, an ER doctor, told John to stay the hell at home and why (in detail), John had still been trying to sneak off for drinks with the boys. Their mom, Mary, was a saint for handling it all and had been taking Sam’s advice very seriously.
“I’ll bet your guy in the department won’t find anything out about the hotel or Castiel,” Dean said.
Open ended, simple, perfectly innocent and as committal or non-committal as Garth wanted to make it. Dean’s eyes flicked to the broken number two pencil poking out between Garth’s fingers and Garth looked from Dean down to the dismembered pencil in his hand.
Dean tried to breathe and not rub himself at the same time. He was still turned on and shocked, and quickly turning into an absolute mess. And he had no idea how Cas was doing.
“Yeah. May I come in?”
Grinning up from Dean’s chest, Cas asked, “Are you saying you want me to fuck you, Dean?”
” Sam exclaimed again.
“How is it no one can find this place, it’s huge!” Sam exclaimed as Dean pulled up outside The Ddraig in what had become his usual parking spot.
Still, Dean worried about Sam being at the front line of this whole thing, though his brother kept reassuring him that the hospital was keeping the staff as safe as they could. And he worried about the other people he thought of as family who were marooned in their own parts of Lawrence. He’d done his best to phone round each day and make sure everyone had what they needed.
“Cas, what happened?” Dean called up to Cas.
Peppering the back of Dean’s neck and shoulders with sucking kisses, Cas fucked up into Dean, one arm across Dean’s chest as his other hand gripped Dean’s cock and fisted him in time with the thrusts. A growing sense of pressure built up in the base of Dean’s spine, and radiated out to his balls, he could feel himself on the verge of release, he just needed one final push from Cas.
“That memory foam stuff any good?” Bobby asked casually, taking a moment to pull out a handkerchief and wipe at his forehead and the back of his neck before ramming his usual trucker cap back on his head. Bobby was going a bit gray, but his beard was still holding onto what chestnut it could. He straightened out his deep green plaid shirt over this old baseball tee and fixed Dean with a look. “Well?”
Dean looked up at Sam, head going slightly upside down over the back of the couch. “Yes it is. Want me to heat it up?”
“Toenails, Dean. Toenails!” Charlie passed Dean’s cell back. “What if they have a fungal infection? And how does anyone’s toenails grow that much, that fast?! They just don’t, Dean. They just don’t.”
social life. “Don’t worry, Sammy. Everything’s fine.”
Cas’s eyes swept over Dean, unabashedly, lingering on Dean’s hardening length as he did. “I hope you don’t mind,” Cas started, licking his lips as the spray dampened them, “I… couldn’t stop thinking about you last night.”
“I’m a cam boy.”
Dean put the cell to his ear. After five rings, the call connected.
Dean looked up from the floor, trying to keep his stomach under control and looked around the open plan space again. Sweat prickled on his back and he wondered just why he’d come to this place.
“I can’t stand it anymore, I need to take the rest of today, maybe tomorrow off.” Garth grimaced. “Sorry, Dean, but I think you need to ask Aaron to come down early.” Garth reached for his apron and untied it.
“Garth… I know you’re a werewolf.”
The weekend passed by in a blur once Dean said yes to Cas’s lease and signed two copies—one for Dean and one for Cas. To Dean, the weekend was just one long shift at The Bunker with small moments in-between coffees. Like Benny, their cake and pastries supplier, dropping off some extra supplies after a visiting group of college art students piled in on the shop Saturday afternoon and left them near nothing to see them through Sunday. Thank god they didn’t drink them out of coffee and tea, but Dean was glad that they would be having their regular deliveries on Monday.
Sam smirked. “You’re on.”
In the background, the episode of
Cas let out a long breath, blearily opening his eyes. “Touch my wing again,” Cas said in a husky voice dripping with want.
“Some nice things you have here,” Dean said lamely, making the understatement of the century.
Cas smiled. “Okay, Dean. We’ll find a way to ensure your inebriation. We just need to find the right spell to pull down my own wards for a while.”
“Yes.”
Asking if a place was ghost free was not exactly something Dean could just go out and do. Charlie just about believed him that he could see them and that they were real, but hardly anyone else in his life had ever shown such openness to the whole afterlife being kind of real and often full of ghosts. But as Dean tried to find some semblance of calm and the nerve to say that he was moving out and thanks and all to Cas, he wondered if maybe, the guy with impossible nails might be open to the idea of what he’d seen.
There were other times when stuff had moved around weirdly or the temperature had suddenly dropped. So many to count over the years—Dean had put it all down to weird microclimates and enthusiastic maids. But as he laid on his bed, on top of the black sheets, he was starting to think that something more had been going on. And that was just stuff he suspected may have been… ghosts.
And then it punched Dean in the gut, as he tipped over and made a mess over his stomach and Cas’s hand and sheets. Behind him, Cas stuttered to a halt, hips shaking as he spilled into Dean. They cried each other’s names and eventually fell into a messy heap on Cas’s bed.
“Well, Sam, you seem to have thought about this a lot…”
“How to bring a ghost back from the dead, and free them and me from the hotel. I can’t leave,” Cas said simply, arms wide.
Feet on his pillows, head at the foot of the bed, Dean flipped through the latest issue of one of the few trade journals he subscribed to. Printed on thick pages and with a lot of hipster aesthetic inside, Dean couldn’t have pictured himself reading something like it ten years ago, but working at a place like The Bunker had given Dean a new appreciation of the artistry of coffee and the communities around it. From bean to cup, Dean found the whole thing fascinating and had been working on his latte art since he’d started in his job. The latest issue of
“I was thinking of mostly trying to have a look in Goodwill.”
Nothing.
Sam came to a stop beside Eileen, eyebrows disappearing into his hairline. While Sam had known about Castiel’s condition, he’d never actually seen what his nails could be like.
The creature snarled and strained towards the window Dean was standing by. Dean got to his feet and backed away, forgetting the treats he’d brought with him, and headed for the safety of the Impala. Dean’s hands shook as he unlocked the driver’s side and slid in, and he wasted no time in starting the engine and pulling away to somewhere without snarling creatures in possession of wicked looking teeth.
“That’s it, work it for me,” said an unfamiliar guy’s voice.
Dean thought as he looked all around himself, unable to turn his eyes away from the mish mash of opulence. Nothing looked like it had been bought just for the sake of it, instead every single item had the signs of use and wear that spoke of being well loved.
Sweat started to bead at Dean’s forehead as he leaned over the tub, the cutters in hand. He lined the cutters up with the end of the curled mess that was the nail for Cas’s left little toe and paused. Slowly, in his head, he counted down. Five. Four. Three. Two. One—snip!
Dean ended the call and looked from his car window to the gated wall that lined the sidewalk. The brick work was covered in smooth render painted a pale coffee color. Trees were visible on the other side of the wall, some cottonwoods and elms, shading the sidewalk from the afternoon sun. The black gates set into the wall were made in curling iron, flourishes of vines and flowers worked in with the curved bars of the gate. He couldn’t see the hotel beyond the wall, but Dean was wondering how he’d never seen this place before. It contrasted with the Sioux Fall streets around it like a rose among thorns.
What Dean is learning about spells is that knowing components and what to say is easy, finding and/or buying components for spell work is hard. SO HARD. He kept being outbid by practitioners or those he suspects were rich criminals who wanted to eat highly forbidden food stuffs. As Thanksgiving approached, Dean started a new ritual in the mornings of monitoring their current bids while he made breakfast at the hotel, or got started in The Bunker. He wished that he could buy everything from the few magic shops he’d uncovered from some careful searching on Google on the regular net, but they just didn’t have everything.
And again, Cas said, “Okay.”
“Don’t get devoured by cannibals, don’t accept any food or drink, check reflections in mirrors. Got it. Anything else?” Dean joked.
“And if you were to be the one to organize it, I don’t see why we can’t have a… shindig with yours and Dean’s closest friends.” Cas mouthed to Dean “it sounds fun”.
They shook hands and Dean felt a weight lifting from his shoulders. And in that second he realized that at some point, Sam would probably want to meet the guy, and Sam was far fussier than Bobby. Dean stood by while Cas and Bobby chatted a moment about the hotel and the superb condition it was in and then Bobby was all business again and determined to help Dean finish moving his stuff some time that century.
“Yes, Sam! Chrissake, man, I am pretty damn sure at this point. So, as we can fit everyone here, how about we have Thanksgiving here at the hotel. We have plenty of room in the kitchen.”
“Thanks, but no thanks,” Dead said as he surveyed the dining room. Their party guests were busy getting down to the tunes being busted out by the DJ who Dean did not know, but appreciated the varied selection he was going for.
This was the effect that the tweaking in the wards was meant to enable and Dean was glad it was sorted in time for the party. Parking up, Dean and Sam proceeded to shift the decorations from the car to the dining room. Piling everything up along one of the shorter walls, Sam then helped Dean move the tables and chairs into a buffet area and then one of the smaller tables for the DJ they had hired.
And while Dean navigated his new relationship with Garth, helped scan Cas’s private library, fixed furniture up and generally tried to get on with his life—Sam was there in the background, and increasingly forefront, plotting a Halloween bash that sounded like it was for a hundred people, not their close friends and their partners. In all, Dean estimated that about thirty to forty people were going to visit The Ddraig, photos for the ward spell changing here and there. When it finally came to the afternoon before the party, Dean cornered Sam and got the last few names from him, while helping Sam get decorations from a local party supplies store.
came and Dean had had some lovely rehearsing sessions with a transfer student who liked to run his lines with Dean. Not that anyone in Dean’s family or the wider school knew this. And Charlie only knew it, because, well, Dean felt safe talking to her about that sort of thing.
Dean nodded. “Yes, I really think she can.” He looked to Cas. “We could also help her with the scanning.”
Sam’s eyes widened in shock. “You’re as pale as a ghost, Dean!”
The sky was a calming azure, streaks of clouds dotted along it like the beep and pause of Morse code. What surprised Dean was that he didn’t feel scared, like he would if he was going to take a flight across the country. Instead he felt safe and protected by the creature between his legs, and when he leaned down during particular steep dives, lining up with the creature’s neck, he felt a comforting warmth that bled through him and made him think of long nights curled up on the couch, a thick blanket draped over himself and a lover—with a roaring fire in the fireplace and hot coco.
Back in the kitchen Dean gave Sam a concerned smile. “Okay, so we’ll act mostly normal,” Dean’s eyes flicked towards the auction and he let go of the rolling pin to fist pump the air as he saw the message saying he’d successfully bid for the feathers. “Yes, normal.” Dean schooled his expression. “Would you close that for me?” He asked, pointing at the laptop.
Leading Charlie to the library, they met Cas inside and he and Charlie shook hands.
“No. I don’t eat people. Not my kind of thing.” Cas shrugged.
“Left foot, please,” Dean squeaked and Cas obliged.
“As per the contract, yes you are.”
“So you’re a dragon, but you can’t get rid of ghosts?”
“Hello?” the ghost said.
“I bet,” Dean muttered.
“I’ll do the dishes,” Cas said and that was Dean’s cue to leave.
Dean smiled at Cas. “Hey.” He held up a hand in greeting to Jack. “Hey, Jack.”
“Hey there, Janet. Hey Thomas,” Dean greeted as he set the tray down. Thomas was seated beside the window, a toy train he was obsessed with making trails over their table. Once the tray was down, the train started to do laps around the tray.
“What’s there to not be sure about?” Dean asked as he stepped away from preparations.
“Right?”
“Dunno, maybe like some kind of demon, if you’re going as an angel? Not that I have any idea what a demon would like.”
“Dean, at least have breakfast first?” Cas pleaded. “Please.”
It was so incredibly warm and nice and normal to sit on a couch with Cas watching cheesy holiday films together, though he was planning on putting
The group played every other Friday, alternating each session with either pizza or potluck. Dean preferred the pizza sessions, even though he was an excellent cook, on account of the fact that the same couldn’t be said for some of their other players. Dorothy kept coming up with concoctions that rarely waded into tasty, Kevin was obsessed with hot dogs, Charlie tried to over complicate things and usually ended up with a mess, Jo tended to just bring bar snacks (which was criminal when Dean considered the buffalo wings served at The Roadhouse, which Jo had easy access to), and Ash? Ash would only cook one thing and it was a tuna casserole of varying levels of tuna. Not the worst effort, but Dean was positive he’d found squid in one once.
“I don’t know.”
“The Gaggia?”
Dean paused and caught his breath.
Dean walked down the entryway and to what would be the front desk if the hotel was open, and looked to the sweeping stairway that led up to his rooms. He started towards the stairs and then stopped. An icy chill ran down his spine, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and his skin break out in goosebumps. He didn’t know what compelled him, but he looked to his right and the closed off East Wing doors.
Cas, unlike their first meetings, stood from his seat and turned to greet them with a smile on his face. He’d also changed, and was now dressed more softly, in a pair of distracting washed out pale blue jeans, a baggy gray band t-shirt for The Strokes (which Dean would be having words about) and a pair of pool shoes.
“Get to the point, Cas.” Dean set the dishes down and waited in front of Cas, the distance between them more like friends than freaked out human and understanding dragon.
“Two good matches,” Cas said, sounding a little breathless.
“I was thinking I might go as an angel.” Cas picked up another book to scan as well.
The lock in the front door turned and Dean set the tablet aside as he waited for Sam to find him in the living room. It was past nine, Dean had eaten hours ago and had left Sam’s food in the oven, ready to be heated up.
“Okay, mom.”
“Yeah, afternoon… what are you doing home so early?”
Cas set his coffee cup down and gave Dean a thoughtful look. “Vampires, werewolves… sirens. Uh, fairies. Shifters. Ghouls…” Cas paused, looking toward the ceiling and then back to Dean. “Merfolk, kelpies, wendigos—pretty much anything, bar aliens. It’s all real.”
“How are your classes going?” Garth asked as he finished the sale.
“Just need to find someone to share it with,” Dean observed to himself but Sam heard him.
“But your nails?” Dean asked, puzzled.
“I’d say cozy, but this place is
, Dean thought. “Cool, well, I’ll let you know when I’m heading out again and when I’m back, okay?”
“Well, I think that worked,” Dean said simply.
“Cas, I know when we first kissed, you didn’t want to go further, because I’d just found out about you. But I’m still here Cas,” Dean said in Cas’s ear, so he could hear him over the music.
The break up with Lisa had been painful, but it was the work incident before that had left him raw and nearly broken. A call gone wrong every which way it could, during a night shift. Big family home. Arson. The family trapped inside. Two colleagues lost. Dean didn’t come back from that call. He’d be reliving it in his nightmares and waking hours for as long as he still drew breath—but Sam, therapy and the friends he’d made while working at The Bunker? They all helped to keep things under control. He’d found some balance, a center around which he could live and heal.
“Are you sure, honey?” Mary Winchester asked, long blond hair tied up in a bun at the back of her head. She had on a red frilly apron, decorated with a cute repeating cross stitch design of reindeer. It looked at odds with the down to earth plaid, Henley and jeans combo she had on underneath.
With Cas’s right foot in his lap again, Dean wondered what he had been thinking as he finished sorting Cas’s cuticles. Because the next course of action was to moisturize Cas’s feet and there was no way he could do it without it being some type of foot massage. It had seemed like such a thoughtful thing to do and necessary for the guy who was letting him rent for the mere inconvenience of cutting impossible toenails. But Dean could remember all the times he’d massaged the feet of Cassie and Lisa, and what that had led to. They were in the guy’s bedroom, for god’s sake!
“That could have gone better,” Dean said, wiping a hand down his face when Cas greeted him upon his return. Dean had dropped Charlie back at her place. She’d met Jack as well once she’d been calmer and that had gone better than Cas’s reveal.
“East wing,” Dean observed and then turned to his left. “This way it is.” He marched off, determined to give the place a thorough examination. He probably should have been freaking out like he had the other day, but there was something about Castiel’s sincerity and bizarre situation that made Dean feel for the guy’s plight. Heading through a pair of tall doors like the east wing’s, Dean found himself inside a grand ballroom-come-dining hall.
“Got her to move the LARP she was running.”
Cas pulled back for a second, warm breath ghosting over the moistness of Dean’s pucker and it felt agonizing to be bereft of the insistent pressure of Cas’s tongue. “You like this, don’t you?”
“Yeah, he did.”
“That’s mine!” Ash called from his corner of the table, favorite dice already picked out of his dice box and lined up in front of him. Dean doled out Ash’s pizza to him and then checked through with the rest of the orders. Charlie and Dorothy had a Thai Chicken Pizza to share with some garlic bread, Kevin had a Big Kahuna, Jo a classic cheese and tomato sauce and Dean had a All Meat, which he would not be telling Sam about on Saturday.
Dean’s breath caught in his chest.
Dean made a hasty decision on how much cheese to lay on and asked, “May I have this dance?” holding his hand out as he.
Sam audibly gasped as they walked inside, the towering, elegant front hall and foyer, with its perfect everything clearly making Sam’s inner interior designer freak out. Dean smiled as he led Sam to the sunroom, where Dean had learned Cas liked to spend much of his time during the day. Knowing Cas was a dragon, it had finally made sense to Dean—
A low, muffled growl. Like a dog waiting menacingly behind a front door. Dean was pretty sure Garth didn’t have a dog.
“No,” Dean lied. He looked back at the TV. “Ha, so they’ve gone down to a planet and it turns out everyone on it is a hologram!”
“Fantastic.”
“Some Gaelic. Have you ever been to Wales?” Eileen asked.
“Okay, you get comfy and let me know if this is too hot or too cold, okay?” Dean asked.
Their progress was slow, their mouths insistent and hands all too everywhere that they stumbled over Cas’s many chairs and foot rests as they made their way through his living room. Cas shoved Dean against a bookcase and claimed his mouth, sending books toppling to the floor as he rutted against him, pushing his leg between Dean’s thighs. Cas was eager and hungry, like the freedom he had been given had left him slightly wild. There had always been a degree of restraint with how Cas had treated Dean before, but as Cas lifted Dean so that he could wrap his legs around Cas’s hips, it was becoming clear that Cas wasn’t holding back as much as usual.
“You’re worried I’ll break his heart?” Cas asked in a surprised voice.
“A ghost. Jack’s a ghost, Sam.”
Castiel nodded. “Yes, yes it would be.”
Okay. By the way, has Charlie asked you about Dungeons and Dragons yet?”
“But that’s not possible. And why can’t you leave the hotel? Dean said you’re agoraphobic. You can leave if you get the right treatment,” Charlie said, voice getting a little higher.
The two of them continued to chat, Thomas nibbling on his brownie and sipping juice as the train continued to circle around the tray and table. It was awkward, but a million miles better than the first time Thomas had come into the shop, which had found him freaking out until Dean started talking to him. Slowly, Dean had helped him out of his freak out and settled him at the table they were now sat at, plying him with juice and a brownie as Mrs Henderson apologized over and over.
“Yes. I’m Castiel. Thank you for coming. You are the only person who’s so far responded to my listing.” Castiel nodded solemnly. “Of course, I want you to understand the gravity of my situation and offer, before you have a look around.”
“There’s a laundry room that will be available for your use. It is the hotel’s own room, but I have some more, uh, standard sized machines for domestic use.”
“Wow, that was real magic,” Charlie observed when the three of them (with Jack dressed in some ill fitting sweats, t-shirt and fluffy socks) sat together in the kitchen an hour later, mugs of hot chocolate between their hands.
“Hey, why don’t I cook dinner, huh? I looked up this sweet burger recipe earlier and I’m itching to try it out.” Dean stood, taking his coffee with him.
Clouds of nail dust smoked into the air, and Dean felt his biceps ache as he continued the motion, over and over. Moving slowly but surely from one nail to the next. Then, once most of the work was done, he added a buffing attachment to the end of the Dremel and smoothed away the little rough edges still there on Cas’s nails. One by one, until Cas’s nails were smooth and looked nothing like they had when Dean first met the man.
Dean turned and ran. Ran as fast as his feet would take him. He barreled out of the east wing and headed for the stairs instead of his car. Behind him, the door slammed shut, but Dean kept running. His legs screamed at him to stop as he went up several flights of stairs, but he didn’t stop. He just ran, heart hammering in his chest.
“Wait, what?” Charlie looked back to Dean. “Sorry, did he just say something about resurrecting the dead?”
“Well?” Charlie prompted again.
, which would also be awesome for Moodoor, but a place like that with huge grounds? And art deco decor? Maybe we could run like
… stop me if you want to know more about any of these by the way…
before you agree to live here, hm? I truly wouldn’t want you to regret moving here.”
As the dust drifted away, Dean pulled his goggles and mask off, and Cas copied him. They both marveled at Cas’s toes, leaning in closer than perhaps they’d intended to. Dean quickly shifted back, back ramrod straight.
Dean was about to say he was going to, but then he looked at Cas standing before him in the moonlight, all the awkwardness of when his nails were long, all gone. He recalled the impossibly long nails Cas had endured and found himself worrying what would happen to Cas if he were to leave, permanently. Not that Cas was Dean’s responsibility.
Later that afternoon, Dean returned to The Ddraig and went to find Cas. Not finding him in the sunroom or his rooms, Dean pulled up Cas’s number on his cell and hit dial.
Ducking down to get eye level with Dean, Cas huffed a warm breath at Dean and with his big blue eyes, gave Dean a look that could only be described as “kicked puppy”.
But Dean looked up into Cas’s eyes, their masks and goggles removed now that there weren’t bits of nail going everywhere. The air between them felt full with potential.
After some unknown amount of time that likely would have covered the length of an actual viewing of the apartment, Dean turned on his cell’s screen. He went looking for the ad he thought he’d been responding to. Dean tried several rental sites, but nothing came up. No worry—he had screen shots of the listing. Bringing that up from his gallery app, he looked at the pictures, saw that the price had been incredibly low for the kind of place it was. But then he looked closer at the outside shots and something stirred in his memory.
“Today’s the October seventh, yes?”
Charlie went back to the couch and dragged her laptop over to herself. “Good stuff.”
Dean huffed and looked to the ceiling of his room, praying for any deity to give him strength. “Jack wouldn’t hurt a fly.”
Charlie’s eyes went wide. “How’d you get in?”
“Cas, are you okay?!” Dean asked in a panic, pulling his hand away.
Without any further warning, Dean started to cut Castiel’s nails back down again and while doing it he wondered why Cas’s nails grew the way that they did. Working carefully at every single nail in turn, Dean slowly came to the conclusion that it was a little like how nails on pet dogs or cats worked. If nails don’t get worn down enough from everyday use and movement then the nails normally needed to be clipped.
“I still need to file them though… think you can walk to your chair in your bedroom?”
Charlie did what Dean had done the first time. She fainted and Dean only just caught her in his arms. Dean was just about ready to join her himself, considering that seeing Cas’s shadow was many steps beyond seeing his actual dragon form.
“And what kind of name is Castiel Novak? Well, okay just Castiel? Sounds like some kind of angel,” Sam huffed. “Plus, why does he need you to cut his toenails?”
traditional. So long as the Grandparents don’t find out too soon, we should be fine.”
“No, the library. I’ll show you after dinner.”
And then there was a whoosh as Cas moved from where he had stood and to the doors out of the library, almost as if he had teleported there or moved with unimaginable speed. His true shadow continued to linger on the walls and shelves.
“That’s good.” Dean nodded.
Dean opened the door and felt his wide as he looked upon the splendor that Cas had surrounded himself with. From the tops of the walls, nearly all the way to the floors, hung richly detailed tapestries depicting all manner of bizarre and beautiful beasts. There were couches, lounges, floor pouffes in a dazzling array of styles and levels of comfort scattered about the living room. Along one wall was set a deep white marble fireplace. Here and there were sculptures ranging from classical design of people to abstract that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a modern art gallery. Then there were bookcases and bookcases stuffed full of all manner of books. The original black lacquered floorboards were covered in a series of rich rugs ranging from Persian to slightly more gaudy 60’s numbers.
Sam chuckled and put a hand through his hair. “Fine. I’ll pick out their Christmas present this year.”
All too soon four hours had passed and it was time they started wrapping up. With a group of knights incapacitated after they’d made a daring escape with Ger, who Hirst was by then on side with Lady Ellis in thinking they were going to be betrayed soon enough, it was time to wrap things up. Dean pulled his dice set into the bag that Kevin had hand knitted for him and pulled its drawstring tight, closing it. With having covered Garth the previous weekend, Dean didn’t have to worry about getting home to sleep and be ready to head in early for a shift, but he was still feeling tired enough.
Slowly he filled his basket with the tools he needed, including disposable gloves, cuticle sticks, and some kind of moisturizer. Several store assistants watched Dean with mild interest as he stalked the aisles, looking for the right tools and treatments. He finished off his hunt looking for a thick pair of socks Cas could wear after Dean was done to make sure that the moisturizer had a chance to condition Cas’s skin.
“Wanna coffee?” Dean called over to his roommate Cas who was sat on their white leather couch watching
Dean stopped his approach to the chimney and looked over at Mary. “You… you think?” he asked, not sure if he was allowed to let himself hope for this to go in his favor.
Dean rolled his eyes and crossed his arms across his chest.
Dean was laid out on his black bed covers,
“Not unless I meet someone in the next three months.”
Dean mouthed at Cas “no he hasn’t”.
And Dean knew he wasn’t ill, just feeling ragged after what had happened at the apartment. “Oh, uh, after looking at an apartment. After my shift.”
“The place was haunted.” Dean gave an uneasy laugh. “Like, the place felt like it was crawling all over my skin and something horrible was going to happen, levels of haunted. There wasn’t even anyone there when I went inside.”
“That too.” Dean stopped by the swing doors. “Hey, um… my brother, Sam, asked if he could come by and check out the place this weekend. Is that okay? Clearly not going to invite him over to talk with our resident ghost, but uh-”
Dean rolled his eyes. “How about I put the hotel owner on the phone, huh?”
Charlie snorted and turned sideways so she could look between Dean and Cas. “Haha, great joke Dean, but you can stop now, okay. Seriously, there’s no need to make up some convoluted story to make me take an interest in scanning some books.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean moaned, body now warmed up after their trip outside. He wanted to push down on the press of Cas’s tongue, wanted to, but Cas’s strong hands held Dean in place.
“It’s too early for brunch now. I didn’t get my lie in.”
Dean finished his last mouthful and set his plate aside. He picked up his cup of coffee. “So.”
“I’m gonna miss this,” Sam said with a sad sigh as he helped Dean clear up. “Dean?”
Dean frowned at that. “Hey, don’t you worry. Aaron and I have got this covered. You go lie down, take some aspirin or something, you hear me?”
“Mhmmm,” Dean nodded, during one final marking on the north wall of the room. “This here is the epicenter of the original spell that ended up trapping them both here. I got the final ingredient for what we think is a counter spell, earlier before I picked up mom and dad.”
“And whenever have I said no?” Dean pointed out. He picked up a cleaning cloth and wiped down around the espresso machine.
“Yes.”
“I hope you do realize that I still care about you. You get that right?”
Dean nodded and settled against the cushions. It was almost six and he’d been working since seven that morning.
“Come on,” Cas finally purred. He took Dean upstairs and put him to bed.
“Because I am looking forward to the Halloween party!” Garth grinned and then his face went serious. “So, what’s up?”
if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person. Hell, I don’t even tell my therapist I can see ghosts. And if I say the truth to Sam… I could never lie to him and say something like, it turned out you played Celine Dion all night or whatever—Sam’s going to see through that eventually. And then I’ll crack, say the wrong thing and, yeah. Goodbye life. Hello, three square meals with a side of pills and all the pudding I want.” Dean slumped over the counter top.
Cock curving up towards his stomach and leaking, Dean wanted to come, but he wanted to do it on more than just Cas’s fingers.
Dean tossed the notices and got behind the counter again as Garth checked out the cash register and made sure the float was okay. Turning to a fresh bag of coffee beans, Dean opened it up, the waft of high end beans making his toes curl as he then upended the contents of the bag into their big red coffee bean grinder. He started the machine and hummed as it crunched and churned, nearly deafening him. After a minute, the grounds were ready and Dean switched off the machine.
“What were you doing, installing shelves?”
“Cas, would you, be okay with me using woodworking tools to cut your nails down?” Dean tried.
Thursday started much the same as Wednesday, only with the addition of it being a day Charlie was able to grace The Bunker with her presence. Once she was set up, Dean brought over a double espresso—apparently it was a serious morning—and he was about to leave her to whatever work she already had her nose buried in, the top of her head only just visible above the lid of her laptop, when she reached out and grabbed Dean by the wrist.
Dean’s throat felt tight. “Thanks, Sammy,” he managed.
“Because humans have a great habit of ignoring the obvious or making up stories of their own. And there aren’t as many of us as there once was. Our numbers have been sharply declining since around the start of the medieval period. I think the last time I spoke with another dragon was maybe some two hundred years ago.” Cas drained the last of his coffee and got up from his stool to begin tidying away.
Dean gave Cas a desperate look. “Please!”
“Likewise, Castiel,” Sam greeted, taking Cas’s hand. Dean noticed Sam wince ever so slightly as Cas gripped Sam’s hand and Dean wondered what the hell that was all about.
Dean didn’t push things any further, but he called Aaron as Garth got ready to leave for the day. Sorting orders for the odd customer who came in and clearing tables as they freed up, Dean kept an eye on Garth as he made the usual checks he would make before heading off on one of his pre-agreed breaks, where Dean and Aaron would be in charge for days at a time.
Jo put a clean hand on top of her head. “Well, Lady Ellis has never trusted Ger, and has little reason left to trust him. Remember the rumors of what he did back in Jonda? Those are Lady Ellis’s people.” Lady Ellis was a lawful-good paladin, a half-orc, and overall defender of the meek and unrepresented.
“Through here,” Dean said, half dragging the mattress before hefting it up again. He steered them towards what was meant to be the bedroom, which had the en-suite attached to it.
Cas licked his lips and Dean found himself looking down to those pink lips, slightly chapped, and wondering just what they might taste like.
“Just do it.”
“Mmm, well, if you don’t like it, know you can always spend awhile with me.”
“Yes, though it was a long time ago now. In my youth,” Cas acknowledged.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, bringing a hand up to Cas’s face and cupping his cheek.
Dean looked around the shop, making sure no one remained who might overhear them. “Garth, I went by your place on Tuesday, after my shift.”
“Hey, Dean we brought-”
Eventually, Ash, Charlie and Kevin went to decorate the main table in the dining room and Dean found himself working in one corner of the kitchen with just Cas.
The two of them worked together to get the bath running, which was a small pool in size. It had high sides, three that weren’t against a wall and easily accessed, and the right amount of room for Cas to sit on an inbuilt seat. Finding some towels, Dean folded a blue one into a cushion for Cas to sit on, and then helped Cas to get into the bath before he started running the water. Cas had hiked up his shorts a little, to make sure the backs of them didn’t end up in water.
Leaving the huge space behind, Dean found himself in a bar and lounge area that looked like it was waiting for a jazz band to descend and then somehow wound his way into the kitchens. The kitchens were immense, with gleaming steel worktops and enough utensils to get just about any kitchen job imaginable done. Towards the back, something glinted as he approached and he came to a stop beside a counter that was loaded up with an espresso machine that looked to be original Italian, 1920’s build with a huge lever jutting out of one side. It was an antique and near enough mint condition, with some signs in a waste tray that it was still regularly used. A modern bean grinder, not unlike the one from The Bunker, stood beside it. The coffee machine alone was nearly enough to convince Dean that he should come to live at this weird ass place with its handsome owner.
Dean fell asleep between the first floor and his bedroom, but woke when Cas had laid him out on Dean’s bed and was removing his boots, slowly and carefully, trying not to wake him. He wondered what it would feel like to have Cas’s feathers brush over his skin.
“Stop it! If you have Eileen living with you, you can’t go hiding your face like that.” Dean grinned.
Dean was surprising himself by not freaking out. Unusual toenails just seemed easy after Tuesday’s ghostly encounter.
“We still do that,” Dean reassured.
“Yeah, we did,” Dean lied.
Dean tried to say something but his voice cracked into a whine rather than words.
“Unfortunately I can’t. I’m bound to this place. Much like the specter I hope we can help.”
“Look, could you all give Cas and me some space and leave,” Dean asked. “The sunroom is great at this time of day, even with the snow.”
“Hey, Cas, I’m back!” Dean called through the rooms, a canvas bag slung over his right shoulder, its contents clinking together with each step he took.
They kept chanting for what seemed like hours, but it was likely only minutes as time seemed to be sucked out of the room. Without warning, the lights in the bathroom exploded, and the water in the bath foamed and boiled and then as if being raised on a dais beneath the surface, Jack emerged, naked and shivering and very real.
“I’m Dean Winchester. Here to see apartment 3A.”
“I’ll ask Cas what he thinks.”
“Dean,” Cas greeted.
“Uh, yeah. Does this place still operate as a hotel?” Dean asked, thinking of the rooms he had seen.
Dean turned to the laptop that was set up on a table and chugging away data to the server Charlie had set up.
Cas’s long, feathered neck flowed towards the ceiling, while his long tail snaked along the floorboards. His wings were set against his back, the feathers folded down and out the way. And Dean was able to finally see that Cas’s front legs, head, neck and wings were covered in golden-black feathers, while the rest of him was blue scales. He had claws that looked like they were doing little for the floor, and as he shifted, Cas scored the wood beneath him.
Dean set the scissors down and stood to face Cas. “The clippers and scissors I bought can’t seem to do anything.”
Appreciating the change in topic, Dean led the way to his bathroom, as they walked from the living room, to the bedroom and then to the ensuite. “You would not believe the size of the bathtub or the water pressure I get in the shower. It’s amazing.” Dean opened the bathroom door.
Setting the chai latte and banana bread aside, Dean knelt down and peered through the murky glass, past the bars that covered the inside. In what light there was filtering into the basement, he saw an outline of what looked like Garth, topless and straining against a set of thick iron manacles. Only his arms seemed thicker, and his fingers ended in wicked curling claws. Another growl and then a visible deep sniff, and whatever was in the basement turned and looked to Dean as he peered in through the window. Its pupils were pinpricks, irises a bright yellow, and its teeth looked like long sharp fingers of white enamel, ready to rip someone’s throat out.
“Uh-huh, well I’m heading to the shop,” Dean called over to his shoulder as he opened the front door. “I’m fine. See you this evening.”
They didn’t say a word as the two of them trooped out of the ensuite, Dean bringing the files and Dremel with him, dragging the extension cord. Once the filing was done, Dean would check over Cas’s cuticles, though perhaps soaking his feet again but in a bowl, and then moisturize and have Cas put on the fluffy socks Dean had picked up. As Cas got himself situated in his reading chair and Dean took a place on the stool beside it and patted his thigh, inviting Cas to put his leg on Dean’s leg. Cas obliged Dean and he picked up the grade of file that he figured would make the easiest work of Cas’s inhumanly strong nails.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Dean muttered as he nodded and headed out.
Cas held out his hand. “Castiel Novak. Infrequent hotelier and avid reader.”
And while there were several supernatural creatures in his life, Dean didn’t dive head on into it. Instead, he helped where he knew he could, and spent most of his days making Cas happy and helping him to discover parts of the world that he had never met before or had forgotten.
Neither of them knew that a PO Box in town had taken a delivery of the ground cockatrice beak earlier that day. Instead Dean had picked it up on his way to get John and Mary from the airport. But it wasn’t until everyone was asleep that he had been able to get alone to do what needed to be done.
“Eileen’s moving in! Oh my, that is serious,” Garth said, after a long pause in which Dean wasn’t sure his colleague was going to answer. It was questionable for a moment, because Dean could almost hear the gears in Garth’s brain turning as he assessed what Dean had told him. Garth was well informed on Sam’s lack of any real life outside of his job for Hendricks and Milton, but apparently the Eileen news was a shock.
Dean could feel Charlie doing the math. Cas looked to be in his late thirties as it was.
“Hey,” Dean said quietly.
It wasn’t curiosity that made Dean’s feet walk him towards the open door. No. It was a sense of foreboding as the temperature started to drop, the closer he got to the wing, phone light illuminating a small sphere in front of him. A part of him knew he should just turn away, maybe just give up on living anywhere and run all the way back to his car and drive back to Sam’s.
One door was pushed in, leaving the doors open.
“Mm, thought you were making brunch.”
Garth didn’t say anything, he just stood there in shock. Dean hurt to see the look on Garth’s face and decided to steer him to one of the nearby tables and sit him down in a seat. Then he fixed two chai lattes and slices of banana bread and set them down in front of Garth and joined him.
“Has it… y’know, happened while you’ve been out looking for a home before?”
Instead of fully admitting anything to anyone, even his therapist, Dean persuaded Sam to ask their parents to come out to Sioux Falls, and convinced Cas that he wanted him to meet his parents. He’d be coming out, though Dean knew his mom had always suspected something. His dad? Dean wasn’t so sure. Dean was expecting some form of emotional pain over the holidays he just wasn’t sure what yet.
“Excellent. See you then.” Rowena hung up and Dean locked his cell again.
“I suppose.”
“Yes, every single one. But I still haven’t found anything that can help Jack and myself.” Cas sighed.
Cas let out a long, sad sigh. “You met Jack.”
“What if it doesn’t work?” Jack asked nervously, shimmering form rippling with ghostly energy.
A floorboard creaked as he did and Cas’s eyes flew to him, panic in them clear as day.
A cool fall breeze blew for a moment and Dean felt himself sighing in relief as Bobby secured the doors of the van.
“How’s Sam?” Garth asked.
“Dean, you are welcome to have guests whenever you want. Though yes, it’s probably best you don’t tell Sam about the ghost, for that matter, or that I am a dragon.”
“It’s an amazing place you have here, Cas,” Dean said, the nickname slipping out unbidden.
Cas stood up and let his arms fall to his sides. He gave Dean a long suffering look and shrugged. “Nothing happened. You fainted and I carried you to your bed.”
Getting out from behind the counter, Dean went over to the front door and flipped the sign there from “closed” to “open”. Outside, the morning was just starting to really brighten with September sunshine. He went back behind the counter and checked on the industrial filter coffee pot they always kept going during open hours, for the “no time to make a fuss” drink crowd who just wanted caffeine—and given the chance to absorb intravenously, probably would.
Dean lapsed into silence, unsure how to keep going. Garth didn’t fill the silence either, like he knew what Dean was about to say and had given himself over to the inevitability of where the conversation was heading.
“So, why don’t people know about them?” Dean asked, head spinning a little at the information.
“Do you have any further questions before you leave?” Cas prompted.
in a rental listing before. He wasn’t sure if it was a prank—it was a good one if it was. But there was something about the tone, the way the lister had described their desperate situation that made Dean suspect that this was a genuine ad. A bizarre one—yes—but real. And it still sounded a million times better than what he had experienced the previous day at that apartment. Sure it was a little weird having a big ol’ hotel to yourself, but if the place was clean and Dean could handle cutting those toenails, it had to be worth a shot. Especially with free rent—if he saved the money he would have spent on rent, there were so many things that Dean knew he’d be able to provide. Whether to himself or for those around him.
Reaching the Impala, Dean felt as if a veil had been lifted off of his eyes. The street outside and the people going about their day seemed more real and present than Dean had experienced before. He didn’t know what to make of that feeling and for a moment he thought that the afternoon had been a hallucination and then he focused on the weight of the envelope in his hand and he realized it really had all been real. Toenails and all.
“Woah, did you guys cut the hedgerow or something?” Sam asked as The Ddraig came into view from the side of the road.
The air grew several degrees warmer and Dean kept his eyes on Cas.
“Everyone okay for the next game in two weeks?” Charlie asked as everyone, bar Dorothy, started to gather to leave.
The roll of Sam’s eyes was practically audible. “Right. Just text me when you’re leaving, okay?”
Dean, still with his battery powered lantern, led the way through the hotel and out through the front main doors. Snow was drifting down lazily from the night sky, the moon a thin sliver above them. They walked down the main driveway and past the now snow filled fountain. Their breath misted in front of them, steaming up into the frigid night air.
Dean pleaded with himself, but he kept walking until his breath was misting in front of him. He took a deep breath and squeezed past the open door.
“Jerk,” Sam snarked back and finally hung up.
Castiel’s angel outfit included a halo fashioned from a coat hanger and spray painted gold, black and gold wings that looked a lot like his own, a tunic and a small harp. Meanwhile, Dean had used Bobby’s workshop to mold a pair of horns for the demon costume using resin. His clothes were just a nice, charcoal suit he had. A purple tail poked out the back, attached to a belt loop, covered by the back of his suit jacket. Their costumes were holding pretty well together, three hours into the party.
Days listed: 1 | Contact: 1 | Applications: 0
Garth exhaled and gave Dean a grateful smile. “That’s what I thought. Just wanted to be sure, Dean.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean called as he saw a tuft of Cas’s hair on the other side of his favorite chair. “Alright if Sam and I come in?”
