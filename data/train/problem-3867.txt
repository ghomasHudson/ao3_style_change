“I do want to get my own place one day though,” Dean admitted. “I mean, Bobby gave up his own privacy a bit to take me in. I don’t want to overstay my welcome.”
“Mm-mm,” Dean said. He leaned forward and buried his face into Castiel’s neck, breathing in his scent and feeling his body scream ‘mate’.
Dean removed his own jacket, picking up his apron and putting it on. He was a little proud of his apron. When he had first started working he had just had a general store apron, but a few weeks ago Kali had presented him with one with his first name embroidered onto it. He finally felt like part of the Holy Perk family now rather than just a temporary fill in. He took it as a sign they intended to keep him around.
“I tell you, just five minutes alone with him,” Dean said. “Cut his grace out and tie his intestines in a bow. He’ll break.”
He waited, watching as Crowley began to pace in the centre of the room. Castiel completely shut down his bond with Dean to prevent him from sensing him. He could feel Dean hammering at it, trying to get a read on him. He remained silent and willed Crowley not to make a mess of things. He did have faith in the King. They had made a deal and Crowley never went back on his deals.
They headed inside, finding a booth that had just been vacated by a leaving couple and taking a seat. The waitress cleared the plates from the last occupants and handed them their menus.
Dean’s eyes widened as he felt his phone snatched out of his hand, and turning he discovered that at some point that Bobby had entered the room. No doubt he had heard Dean’s raised voice and guessed what was going on.
“Oh come on.” Dean pointed to the spot where his shoulder met his neck, right where his scent gland was. “Just a little mark right here.”
“I bet if you really thought about it you’d remember,” Dean said. “Maybe I can even send you the memories over our bond.”
He could feel his anger simmering up again. Castiel set his jaw. He knew Dean was right – he had made many mistakes over the years and others had been the ones to pay for them. People and angels had died because of him. Nothing he could ever do would allow him to repent for his sins.
Dean felt his heart skip at that. He knew he had the beginnings of a crush on Castiel but he hadn’t thought that there would be a chance. If Castiel was attracted to men then it opened up possibilities. Of course it would first require Castiel to be attracted to him. Dean hadn’t seen any sign of Castiel showing interest in him. Then again, Castiel was agreeing to meet for dinner which was apparently out of the ordinary for him.
“I noticed,” Dean said. He narrowed his eyes. She was definitely fishing. “Look, I’m not going to tell you anything that’s going on with the Shurley family because I don’t know what’s going on outside of gossip.”
“About half the menu,” Dean said, wandering over. He pointed out which ones he knew, Castiel listening intently. “Basically the easier ones.”
Gabriel disappeared out the door, leaving Kali and Dean to finish cleaning up the shop. When he returned he had a tote bag filled with goodies, setting it on one of the tables with a piece of paper with the address. Gabriel helped them finish cleaning up, Dean getting the feeling that Gabriel and Kali were on the clock and needed to be out of there by a certain time.
Dean glared up at him for a moment before he flinched, pulling at his bonds. He groaned, grimacing in pain. Castiel stayed ready with the holy water in case he tried anything but instead Dean seemed to be fighting with something inside himself.
“Hopefully the way most alphas react when they go into rut,” Dean said. He pointed to his neck. “Should give me a little mark right here.”
Sam tried to register what was going on. If Dean was miscarrying then that meant that he was pregnant. His omega brother was pregnant. Sam knew that Dean would never have allowed himself to be in such a position and couldn’t help but wonder if Dean even knew who the father was. Sam worried his lip as he got them to the hospital.
“More or less,” Castiel said. “My wings are broken and Heaven is weakened so I am not as strong as I once was.”
“Cas took me to an awesome pie bakery,” Dean said. “They had a platter of samplers. It was Heaven. Then we caught a movie, had dinner, and then went back to the motel.”
“I just don’t get how they can abandon one of their own,” Dean said. “Two really. Anna and Gadreel.”
“I cannot allow a demon to have it,” Hannah said, her angel blade appearing in her hand. “Hand it over peacefully.”
She stood and left, Dean watching her go. Something still felt a little off to him although he couldn’t really put his finger on what it was. He shrugged it off and finished his coffee. He was paranoid from his years growing up. Still, what she had told him sounded like it was on the up-and-up. He just hoped he could find some way to help.
Deciding he needed answers Crowley headed down to the dungeon. He growled to himself as he passed more bodies, knowing that his numbers had been severely thinned during Dean’s little tantrum. It meant Crowley was going to have to find new guards that were loyal to him. Strong and loyal alphas were a rare thing in Hell. He was going to have to make do with betas for the time being. Maybe he should mix things up with a few strong omegas. They could be quite vicious.
Word had gotten back to them that the angels were indeed looking for Dean. There had been nothing said about them knowing he was pregnant so they doubted it was because of the Nephilim. No doubt they viewed Dean as a threat and wanted him eliminated. Either way that was how Crowley had convinced Dean to stay in Hell for a while until they knew just what the angels were planning.
“I see,” she said. “He is still captive in Heaven. There are strict orders for him not to be removed from his cell.”
“No, it’s not,” Dean said. “Have you ever stopped to think that maybe I want you alive just because I do?”
“Yeah, I guess.” Dean finished putting the vegetables in the pot, then started cleaning up the scraps. “Hey Bobby, exactly how messed up is the Shurley family?”
“You’re not a deadbeat,” Sam said. “I know that’s what Dad called you when you left, but you’re not. You’re working hard.”
He pulled absently at his chains, his wrists still bound. He was happier now that he could move more freely through the space instead of being bound to the wall. He tried to make sure that he kept himself moving so that his body didn’t deteriorate. It was awkward but he had designed himself an exercise routine to keep himself active. The chains that attached him to the wall meant that he was limited in how much he could move around though. He couldn’t reach the cell door, for example.
“Had to do a supply run for Gabriel,” Dean said, closing the apartment door. “He wanted me to drop some stuff into Castiel.”
Dean allowed Castiel to pull him to his feet, Castiel stepping into his arms and kissing him firmly. Dean wrapped his arms around him. He could taste the pb&j on his lips as well as the honey cake, and they hadn’t even gotten to the alcohol yet. Dean kissed Castiel back, his mind singing with the word ‘fiancé’ over and over again.
“The only way you can help me is to help find Cas’ grace,” Dean said. “That should be your top priority.”
She nodded. “It’s stage 2 but it’s developing quickly. She can be treated right now but no one will take her on. We haven’t got the money.”
Castiel’s eyes slid closed when Dean added a third finger. Dean instantly missed the blue, pulling off Castiel’s cock.
“No he wouldn’t,” Dean said. “We did what he wanted and handed over the cash. I mean, I wanted to tackle him and all but there was no way to do it.”
“No,” Dean said defensively. He wondered why the guy would even think that. “We just stayed cool and went with it. No heroes.”
“I love it,” Castiel said, hugging the stuffed bee to his chest. “I didn’t even know you could get them.”
Resettling on the bed Castiel probed their bond and felt the anger simmering from Dean. He was definitely still very much in denial about what will happen if he gave birth. Castiel decided to leave him be for the time being. Perhaps if he kept telling Dean the truth enough it would eventually sink in and cause Dean to make the right decision.
“He was working as a security guard at the museum,” Bobby said. “Let some guys in who stole some pricey pieces.”
He finished off his chores for the night before taking off his apron and grabbing his jacket. He pulled it on and noted that Kali was counting the money in the till.
“That bitch still around?” Dean said. “I thought she knew how to crack an angel’s skull. Doesn’t she perform grace lobotomies?”
That piqued Dean’s interest. This was starting to sound even more like the way Castiel had said things would go. “How?”
It had been nearly two weeks now since he had been cured. Dean’s body was slowly starting to recover from the whole ordeal. The Mark still itched and cried out for blood but he had been resisting the call. It was easier to do that now he was human.
Dean studied him, Castiel feeling him probing their bond for any dishonesty. Dean dropped down to sit beside Castiel, leaning against the wall beside him. “What did you tell him?”
There was also a definite drop in the number of school aged students that came in. A significant drop. Dean wondered if it was because so few of them would actually walk to school in weather like this and therefore not pass the shop. On the plus side it meant that Dean didn’t have to run around as much making drinks, but he knew that it would hurt the shop’s revenue.
There was still hesitancy in Castiel’s kisses, Dean pushing back hard against him in an attempt to assure him that yes, this was indeed happening. Slowly Castiel became more sure with himself, kissing Dean back with equal fervour. Dean slid his hand behind Castiel’s neck as Castiel gripped his other hand tightly as if he were scared Dean would let go.
Sam had been researching ways to remove it before Dean had died. Hopefully he had found something by now. When Dean’s body had disappeared they had both assumed the worst, but this was far worse than what Castiel had ever imagined it could be. It would only be a matter of time before Sam realised what Dean was. He knew it was going to break Sam’s heart.
Dean gently put the cups down, flicking his gaze to Castiel as he pushed the buttons to open the till. The man threw a bag at him.
“Just wish he’d pick a place and stick with it,” Bobby said as he sat at the table across from Dean. “It would be better for everyone if he did.”
What surprised Dean about all of the routine of things was that he wasn’t getting bored. After his life on the road he was actually enjoying the stability. It was nice to know that he had a soft bed to sleep in and guaranteed food when he was hungry. It was also a bonus not to be having to tiptoe around his dad, never knowing just what mood John was going to be in when Dean came home.
Dean, on the other hand, Sam had gotten some word on. Apparently he had been seen in the vicinity of an alpha vampire nest shortly before they had all been slaughtered. Sam had gone to check it out and people had confirmed that they had seen his brother, and one person had mentioned the presence of the First Blade. That meant Dean was killing. Sam wasn’t sure what to think about that. If anything it worried him.
Like the weekend before there wasn’t really any rushes, but rather an uneven stream of customers. They came in waves more than anything, particularly around certain times on the clock Dean noted. He wondered if it was connected to the pickup times at the Sugar Heaven. Nevertheless he kept working, taking advantage of the times when the store was empty to clean and restock.
It didn’t take long before Dean began to feel Castiel’s knot starting to swell, Castiel’s body betraying him further. Dean grinned, baring himself down onto Castiel, taking him in as deep as he could go. He could hear Castiel chanting ‘no no no’, the angel straining against his bonds. Dean dug his fingers into Castiel’s hair, pushing his face into Dean’s neck. He willed Castiel to mark him but knew that it wasn’t going to happen.
“Other stores have tried to negotiate with Gabriel for the recipe,” Castiel said. “He says it’s a secret blend.”
“Which tells me he’s tried.” Sam said. He felt sick not knowing what the demons were doing to Castiel. He could barely imagine what they were putting him through. “Have you tortured him?”
Castiel’s eyes snapped open as he heard a distant voice. He frowned, trying to focus on it. It was carrying over ‘angel radio’ which made it distorted. He could barely make it out but he knew what it was. A prayer. Someone was praying to him.
“Dean,” Anna said, reaching across the table and touching his arm. “You didn’t deserve it. You were just a child.”
“Then we’ll find something else,” Dean said. “I don’t know. I could set up something in purgatory if you’re that bothered.”
“Dean is losing himself,” Castiel said. “The demon in him is getting stronger. The Mark is taking control.”
“Nice choice,” Dean said, crunching into his burger. He chewed, swallowing his mouthful. “So do you eat out often?”
They police approached them to take their statements separately. Dean answered as many questions as he could, his body still shaking from the adrenaline. He glanced up and saw that Gabriel and Kali were also talking to the police, Kali leading them back into the coffee shop. No doubt she was going to retrieve the security footage for them.
The demons had moved Castiel from the chair to the wall. He was still sitting, his hands shackled on either side of his head against the brickwork. He had his eyes closed, focussing on his breathing to pass the time. As a full angel breathing was just a means of keeping the vessel alive, but he was more human than angel these days. He could still feel the stolen grace burning within him, but it was growing dimmer by the day.
“Uh…” Dean frowned, not sure how much Castiel had actually told Gabriel about his affairs with Anna. Dean didn’t want to be the one to let the cat out of the bag. “That’s something you’d have to ask him. He just said she might.”
Their connection still felt chaotic. Dean put it down to the fact Castiel was still lost in an induced rut. All he could sense from the angel was desire and the need to mate, to breed. He wondered just how long the spell would last for. Not that he was complaining – this was some of the best sex he had ever had. He hadn’t known that Castiel had it in him. Maybe he should convince Crowley to induce the rut again once it was over so that he could get more of it.
“We’ve tried to help him,” Kali said. “But he says he doesn’t care what things look like so long as they’re functional.”
“No,” Dean agreed. “He was pretty strict about what we could own. If we couldn’t wear it or use it for school it was gone.”
Dean broke the kiss to look over to the doorway, spotting Sam standing there with his mouth hanging open.
“Not that your brother really needs babysitting anymore,” Bobby said. “Your phone in your name now?”
“Because nobody else would,” Bobby said. “Nobody else is qualified. And apparently nobody else is trusted.”
There was no reply. Castiel hadn’t expected there to be one straight away so he stood where he was, waiting for the gate to Heaven to open. He knew that he could always enter Heaven himself but decided against it. He still was not the most welcome angel in Heaven with a great many of his brethren blaming him for the fall. Hannah was a rare exception.
His new shoes were definitely a help so he was glad for the recommendation for them, although he was already starting to worry if they were going to last long. He spent his entire day on his feet and they were already starting to show some wear. He asked Kali about it and she had commented that it wasn’t unusual to go through a lot of shoes. It was simply a matter of finding what was comfortable for you to spend all day on your feet in.
“He travels around going from job to job,” Dean said. “We never stayed more than six months in a place. Usually it was a couple of months here and there.”
“Me too,” Bobby said. “Problem is Sam’s still a minor and your dad still has custody. Nothing we can do until he’s 18.”
“She’ll learn if she has the police called on her,” Gabriel said. “It’s the only way to get through to her.”
“I did,” Dean confirmed, absently wondering if he should be offended by the insinuation that he would jump in bed with the first girl who offered herself. “I also told her to skip town.”
The demon shook his head, the group retreating out of the throne room and closing the doors behind them. Dean turned to Castiel, looking down at the crumpled form of the angel. As a demon he could see Castiel’s grace burning within him. He frowned at how dim it seemed to be, remembering the stories of how Castiel’s grace had been taken. He already had demons out hunting for it and knew it would only be a matter of time before they found it.
Dean scowled. He hadn’t even thought about his dad. He wasn’t even sure where his dad and little brother were. All he knew was his dad had been pissed at him for taking up Bobby’s offer to join him as a mechanic at the workshop and scrapyard. “Yeah, I guess I better. Maybe I’ll just send him a text. I’ll shoot Sam an email while I’m at it.”
“Isn’t that what angels are for?” Crowley said, frowning as he spotted something. “Your famous for your faith, however misguided it is.”
“Just that she’s worried,” Dean said, deciding not to tell Gabriel that Anna had been watching them. He didn’t want her to get into any more trouble than she was already in. “About them still being at home with your dad.”
“Sick Juliet on them,” Crowley said. “She’s trained to get through most demon warding. Otherwise just burn the bloody house down.”
Bobby appeared to have been pacing when Dean arrived back at the apartment above the workshop. Dean could see that dinner was ready and on the table although Bobby hadn’t touched his yet.
Dean gazed around him and tried to work out just what he could get to fill that void. He spotted a toy shop and a thought occurred to him. He wondered if they sold them. There was only one way to find out. He closed the rear door of the Impala and headed for the store.
“Just making sure,” Kali said. “It’s going to be all hands on deck at Sugar Heaven so Gabriel and I won’t be able to come in and check on you.”
They soon found themselves caught up in the first school rush of the day. There were tons of inappropriate questions that Dean just ignored. He noted that Kali wasn’t answering any of them either. Some of the kids shared how they would have been the hero and taken down the robber, but Dean knew that it was all bluster. Most of them would probably wet their pants if they’d been in his shoes.
“Listen to me, Dean,” Crowley said, leaning forward. “There’s one thing you need to learn if you want to survive around here. You don’t leave yourself open. You get rid of your weaknesses. That means Feathers and Moose need to go.”
Castiel nodded. “That is the general idea. When the coffee shop first opened it was open every Saturday but we found that there were very few customers in winter on the weekend.”
“I guess both of us are early in our education,” Castiel said. “Although mine was delayed by several years.”
“See, we’ll make this work,” Dean said smiling. He liked the fact that he still had some connection to his brother. Sure they couldn’t see each other physically and that was hard, but they still had lines of communication open other than just the phone calls. He almost looked forward to being able to read through the play with Sam, whatever the play turned out to be. He just hoped it wasn’t Shakespeare. He’d never gotten his head around the language of that.
“Not necessarily,” Sam said. “I was thinking – what if Metatron wasn’t the one who hid Cas’ grace? What if it was Gadreel.”
“Gabriel always lived in his own bubble,” Anna said. “He was always too busy with Lucifer to really care about what happened to the rest of us. That is until Castiel got a bit older anyway. He took an interest in him.”
Abruptly Dean stiffened, a hand going to his abdomen. He gave a grunt of pain, then a louder cry as he doubled over. Sam’s eyes widened as he grabbed him, Dean slowly sinking to the floor as he whined.
“And some people can’t live without it,” she agreed. “That’s why we bring in hot chocolate during the bad season. It boosts our numbers a little.”
“If you say so,” Dean said. “I prefer fiction myself when I get time. Reading one of your dad’s books at the moment, actually.”
“Fine,” Dean said. “Just throwing it out there but have you considered cutting out his grace and holding it hostage until he gives you the location?”
With a sigh Castiel began to move, rolling his hips as he began to ride Dean’s cock. Dean licked his lips, raising his own knees up so that he had leverage on the bed. He began to roll his own hips in time with Castiel’s, thrusting up into him as Castiel ground down. Castiel kept shifting on him until on one move he cried out softly, his head falling back. Dean knew they had found his prostate and began targeting that spot.
“He is too non-confrontational,” Kali said. “I can complain for him if he wants. As his boss, I mean.”
He started the task of pulling the junker apart, Bobby giving him an area to spread out the engine parts. As he worked he found different parts that would need replacing and made a list of them for when he went to put the engine back together. He studied how the engine was built, noting how each component slotted together and trying to make a mental template for when he rebuilt it.
“We’ve been over this,” Bobby said. “It’s just ‘Bobby’. Enough with the ‘uncle’ nonsense. That’s for 10-year-olds, not 18-year-olds.”
“There is now,” Kali said. “They’re in business because of Gabriel. They export to a lot of the surrounding towns and cities now.”
Dean pressed a gentle kiss to his lips, Castiel chasing his mouth when Dean pulled back. Dean smiled at him and walked over to his bag to grab his sleep clothes. He headed into the bathroom to change, coming back out to find Castiel seated on the side of the bed waiting for him. Dean eyed the fact Castiel was still mostly dressed and wondered how comfortable that suit had to be to sleep in. He made a note to get something for Castiel to sleep in for the future.
“Most likely,” Benny said. “They’re in a desperate situation. She could be looking for a meal ticket.”
He rubbed his tired eyes as he settled back into his chair. He had managed to get a little sleep but he was still mostly running on coffee and energy drinks. The talk with Dean had not done him any favours. His dreams were now plagued with nightmares about Dean with black eyes. Part of him was thrilled that his brother was alive, but the rest of him was horrified by what he was.
“You have a lot of faith in him,” Hannah said as she walked the aisle beside his, scanning the books.
Hannah averted her eyes. “There are those of us in our ranks who have practiced torture, but we do not.”
“He kept me in line,” Dean said. “That’s what matters. Whenever I got distracted he put me back on the straight road.”
Hannah narrowed her eyes as she gazed at him. Castiel did his best not to shift under her scrutiny. It was as if she was trying to look deep into his grace to search for answers. After a while her face softened, a look of determination on her face.
Crowley had assured Dean that his scent hadn’t really changed to give away the fact he was expecting. The only real change was that Dean’s omega scent was apparently a lot less potent these days, but Crowley put that down more to the fact he was mated more than anything. Dean didn’t know if his scent would change the further he got along. He hoped not. The last thing he needed was anyone outside of Castiel and Crowley knowing.
It was another reason that angels didn’t mate. Angels were eternal – humans were not. Losing a mate, especially a truemate, was detrimental to the surviving mate. The broken bond would leave you vulnerable and broken. Sure the bond could survive to Heaven (or Hell) but while you were still on Earth it would burn. Mating with a human Dean only to lose him would cripple Castiel.
“Need something, do you?” Gabriel said. “Because you only ever call me ‘brother’ when you want something.”
“Anyway, it’s the perfect weather for lemon and honey drops,” Gabriel said. “And maybe some eucalyptus drops.”
“So your dad didn’t make the whole thing go away?” Dean asked, surprised. He always assumed that the Shurley family would pay to prevent there from being any consequences but it sounded like there had been some.
“We need to talk to Crowley,” Sam said. “I’ll text you some coordinates. I’ll meet you there in a few hours.”
“Your family seriously sucks,” Dean said. “I’d never dob Sam in for something like that. I’d tell him to be careful but that’s it. And I’m pretty sure he’d never tattle on me either.”
“I don’t make promises I can’t keep,” Crowley said. “Castiel is Dean’s responsibility. He decides if anything happens to him.”
He managed to only make a couple of mistakes, Dean knowing he was going slow compared to what the customers were used to. He heard at least a couple of them grumble about him but he paid it no mind, knowing that if he sped up he would make mistakes. He kept himself on task, not rushing things and handing the drinks to Kali who would decide if they were satisfactory. She seemed to think so, and no one was bringing the drinks back to complain so Dean guessed he was doing okay.
“And what about the bloodlust?” Crowley asked. “The Mark isn’t just going to be dormant because you’re knocked up. In fact it could make it worse.”
A Nephilim. Dean knew that Castiel had killed the last one when Metatron had tricked him into expelling the angels from Heaven. He knew they were powerful, and that Heaven would probably do everything in their power to try and destroy it before it was born. Dean frowned. It was entirely possible that Hell would also try to destroy it.
“Yes, but it will incentivise the other angels to try and rescue him,” Crowley said. “You haven’t thought this through.”
Dean gave him a measured look and went about eating his pie. He tried to pace himself, making sure to smooth the dollop of cream over the slice. It really was good pie. He would be able to tell Gabriel and Kali that he had tried it now. He wondered where else they would recommend for him to try out. He knew the rest would probably be fine dining though and he wasn’t too keen on that.
“I simply told them you had cut contact with Anna,” Castiel said. “They had been worried about you.”
Dean paused as he watched Castiel, a memory flashing through his mind. “You’re okay with this, right?”
“I’ve been trying to track his path,” Sam said. “Work out where he went and try and narrow it down.”
“No,” Sam said, looking at his computer. “It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. I don’t know where to even start. I just need more information to narrow things down.”
“Give me an hour,” Crowley said. “I’ll get you your list. Although I still fail to see why you’re wasting your time with him. He’s a liability and will be even more so when you’re mated to him.”
“He’s probably trying to glamourize college life,” Bobby said. “I bet he still has access to his dad’s money.”
“He is very experienced,” Kali reminded him. “If he doesn’t talk to you don’t worry – that’s just how he is. Straight to business.”
By the time the shop opened and the first few customers wandered in Dean had the hang of it, although he still felt daunted by it all. He took his time to make sure there were no mistakes but the customers seemed to be understanding toward him. A few of them tried to chat with him but he was concentrating too hard on his job so Gabriel had chimed in instead.
“Fucked you,” Dean answered. He drew back, feeling Castiel’s cum flooding inside him. He gently caressed Castiel’s face and took in his panicked, wide-eyed look. “Relax, Cas. Enjoy it.”
Dean slid out of his seat, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out the little box he’d hidden there that morning. He’d been carrying it around in secret in his bag for some time now. He opened it, kneeling next to Castiel and holding it out. “Castiel, will you marry me?”
There was a growl, Castiel lifting his head slowly as Dean approached him. Most likely Castiel could scent the other alphas on him. Dean knelt down beside him, reaching out and capturing Castiel’s chin with his hand so that he could lift his head. He gazed into Castiel’s eyes and was pleased to see that there was almost no blue left in them. Castiel’s nose was twitching as he scented him, and he was pulling forward at his bonds.
“Life on the road is difficult,” Castiel said. “When I was younger we moved around a lot. My father believed in finding inspiration on the road. It wasn’t until he adopted Samandriel that he decided to settle in one place.”
“I am,” Dean said. And he was. He was only putting some of his money aside for Sam while saving the rest for himself. “I just want to help him, that’s all.”
“It was a lot of trial and error,” Kali said. “And luck. Especially when Starbucks opened down the street and tried to take us down.”
“This is nothing like watching movies at the bunker,” Dean said as they settled into their seats. “The surround sound alone makes all the difference.”
When Castiel had appeared he had actually greeted Dean by name. Dean was glad for his pleasant greeting, although he could see the question in Castiel’s eyes. As Castiel had moved to relieve him of his shift Dean had grabbed him by the sleeve.
“He hasn’t seen most things,” Gabriel said. “He just crams with knowledge for school and leaves no room for anything else.”
“Just information on each other’s backgrounds,” Castiel said. “We are still getting to know each other.”
“Warehouse jobs like you?” Dean asked. “I want to be a mechanic. Bobby’s training me. I’m good at it, too.”
With one hand Castiel wrapped his fingers around his cock, beginning to stroke it in time with their movements. Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away as he watched the pure porn on top of him. Castiel was grunting slightly now, Dean answering him with his own grunts and whimpers. They moved in sync, Dean feeling his orgasm approaching quickly.
“I’m sorry, boy,” Bobby said. “You’ll have to play with the junker yourself for the next couple of weeks. Maybe you can help around the shop with a few of the smaller tasks but no, I won’t have time to train you.”
That was why Dean had gone off his own suppressants. He had been keen on mating Castiel and had hoped that being able to scent that Dean was an omega would wake up that part of Castiel and make him realise they were truemates. Dean had known they were for some time now but had been denying it to himself. Now he was a demon he had decided to just take what was his.
Dean dug into his food, feeling slightly queasy about it all. He finished his meal and helped Bobby with the dishes, sensing that this conversation was most definitely over. Instead Bobby was happy to talk about the Cadillac and the work he’d done on it to repair her, Dean asking questions and hoping to learn something.
Dean’s scowl deepened as he looked down at Castiel. He seemed to be inspecting him for any foul play. Seeing none he looked back up at Crowley. “I think your minions were looking for you. Something about a fire in a warehouse in Brooklyn.”
Castiel gazed around the room he was in looking for some means of escape. There were four windowless walls surrounding him. A door was at the end of one wall and looked to be made of wrought iron. Along one of the walls there were chains. More chains hung from the roof. There was a table at one end of the room with manacles attached. And then there was the chair Castiel strapped into.
“That’s what money does to you,” Bobby said. “If I’ve got to give Gabriel and Castiel anything it’s that they’ve actually worked a hard day. Can’t say the same for most of the family.”
“But it was fun,” Dean said. “You kept pinning me to the bed and fucked me over and over. Your knot barely ever went down. It’d go down and boom, ten minutes later you were climbing right back on.”
“Actually I found a tutor,” Sam said. “They’re doing it for free and everything. It’s part of a community program in the town we’re in.”
Dean glanced at Kali and saw that she was busy, so Dean could only assume that the man that had come through had to be Gabriel’s brother. Sure enough the man emerged back out into the serving area wearing an apron, stepping over toward Dean. Dean blinked as he got a good look at the man, instantly drawn to the blue of his eyes. He knew he was staring when he saw the man frown at him.
“So you’re here to pick a fight,” Dean said. “Tell you what – you walk out that door right now and I’ll let you live. If not…” he shrugged.
A thoughtful look crossed Dean’s face. Crowley could see him plotting something in his head. Crowley rolled his eyes, feeling a bubble of frustration pushing up from inside him. Dean seemed to be getting on his last nerve today. He hadn’t been lying when he said he hadn’t been in the best mood. Everything hadn’t been going well and Crowley was ready to lash out.
“Red, white and blue candy,” Kali said. “From the lollipops to the gumdrops. You’d be surprised how well they sell.”
Castiel smiled, shifting slightly up the bed before leaning down. Dean turned his head so that they could press their lips perfectly together. It was a soft kiss, Dean expecting Castiel to pull away but instead he leaned back in for another. Dean parted his lips in invitation, one that Castiel took. They kissed passionately for a moment, losing themselves in each other.
The man was very aware of him too, waving the gun back and forth between them. Dean raised his hands, his heart pounding in his ears as he let out a long, steadying breath. He knew if they cooperated they would be fine. There was definitely nothing he could do right now. If he moved then the man might shoot either him or Castiel.
“It’s less than he used to write,” Castiel said. “One year he wrote six books. We never saw him at all that year.”
He knew that his prayer probably fell on deaf ears but it was all he could do. Another name crossed his mind, Castiel swallowing.
“I mean is it going to wipe us all out?” Crowley met Dean’s eye. “It’s the offspring of an angel and a demon. It’s bound to be powerful.”
“Ah.” Bobby looked over at him. “You want to help me look over some of these cars. I have a few I’m thinking of buying.”
“A Nephilim cannot be allowed to exist,” Castiel said. “Especially not one between an angel and a Knight of Hell.”
He glared down at him, sensing Castiel seem to decide to settle. Now that the rut had faded Dean was able to more clearly sense Castiel through their bond. He was disturbed by the amount of calm that he found. Castiel seemed to be suppressing his emotions, no doubt to prevent Dean from knowing what he was feeling.
There was the sound of shuffling and yelling at the door, Dean straightening in his seat. The throne room doors were thrown open, a small group of lower demons entering. What caught Dean’s eye, however, was the present they had between them. He sucked in a deep breath, scenting the air and catching the familiar scent. Alpha.
“He’s just misunderstood,” Gabriel said. “Anyway think you can stop in? I know you have to drive by there.”
“Right.” Dean grabbed the mop and began to wash the floors, wiping away the muddy footprints and puddles of water. “At least we don’t have carpet.”
It was while he was making dinner on Thursday that he heard the footsteps on the old stairs, Bobby walking wearily into the flat. He had grunted an acknowledgement to Dean before heading for the shower, Dean finishing up making dinner. He was just putting the plates out when Bobby had walked back into the room, freshly showered and changed, and taken a seat at the table.
“I’m always right on time,” Castiel said. “If you’re referring to Kali and Gabriel they always exaggerate my timing. They would prefer that I was earlier.”
He broke off a portion and handed it across to Castiel. The angel took the bite, slipping it into his mouth and chewing.
“Long enough to get the message out,” Crowley said. “I’d have it in here except it would stink up the place.”
He felt Castiel dragging his teeth over his neck and felt a thrill run up his spine. Already he could feel Castiel’s knot beginning to catch at his rim. He knew it wouldn’t be long before he popped his knot. Dean breathed in the alpha scent deeply, feeling another rush of slick wash out of him. He longed to claw at Castiel’s back but he was pinned firmly to the hard ground. Perhaps he should have brought a bed in with him.
“Well anyway,” Dean said, breaking the silence. “What say we drive around for a bit and then go find somewhere that serves pie.”
Dean made his way over to her, Anna stepping forward to give him a hug. He stood stiffly, frowning when she leaned in to kiss him. He turned his head away, Anna’s lips brushing his cheek. Where had this come from? He had made no indication to her that he was interested in forming that sort of relationship with her. Was Castiel right?
“Copy that.” Dean put the mop away, removing his apron. “Is that everything that needs doing tonight?”
The alphas exchanged a weary look, Crowley having a feeling that this wasn’t the last he was going to hear about it. Sure enough one of them cleared their throat.
“I see,” Castiel said, sliding his hand free. “I take it this is the part where we have intercourse.”
“Hey yourself,” Sam said. He reached out, taking hold of one of Dean’s hands and giving it a squeeze. “How are you feeling?”
She nodded. “Special orders. I work the counter for pick up while Gabriel and the rest of the workers make the sweets. People have specific pick up times so it’s going to be fairly tight shifts.”
“Oh come on, Sammy,” Dean growled. “You know that’s not going to work on me. I have more than just demon juice running through these veins.”
“You don’t last long if you don’t make local connections,” Kali said. “When Gabriel first opened the sweet shop he did a lot of community outreach to get the name out. He did the same when the coffee shop first opened. It gets you on the map.”
Dean snarled, eyes black as he stared Castiel down. Castiel checked the bonds again to make sure they weren’t going to give. He was glad he had decided to stay in the room with Dean now. He hated to think what a free roaming Dean would have done. He would no doubt want revenge for what was happening to him.
“The angels told me about the Nephilim,” Sam said. “They also told me that the human and angel involved must die.”
“It is the one time of year we see each other,” Castiel said. “Provided you are unable to find an excuse to excuse yourself.”
It had taken him a few days to track down the vampire nest that Crowley wanted dealt with, and another couple of days to wipe them all out. It had been a fairly large nest. Normally Dean wouldn’t have stood a chance going up against such a large nest solo, but now he was a Knight of Hell with the Mark and the First Blade he was virtually unstoppable. He had relished their blood as he had slaughtered them, leaving nothing but bodies in his wake.
Bobby was still training him in the workshop. They were starting to let Dean work on some of the more simple jobs solo now. He often got stuck with doing oil and filter changes, the two jobs he knew that no one enjoyed. He hadn’t caused any major spills so he took that as a win. He had even managed to spot a problem with a car that the others had missed at one stage, Bobby giving him a slap on the back and commending his good eye.
He had started shaking now and not from the cold. He felt so tired that he had been dozing on and off, only waking when someone walked past his cell. He willed his end to come as he knew it was probably the only way he would be able to leave this place. He felt bad for Sam knowing that there was nothing he could do for the younger Winchester and hoping that he could find some way of saving Dean.
“That would make sense,” Dean said. He knew some people spent years just trying to adopt one kid, but Chuck had 16 and they all seemed to be in short order after each other. He was definitely playing the system. “Sounds like they had a pretty sucky childhood.”
“There is a nearby café that has several baristas,” Castiel said. “She will often hire one of them for the day.”
Dean knelt beside him, catching Castiel under the jaw and lifting his chin to gaze down at him. “Crowley wasn’t kidding when he said your grace is fading. You need juice bad.”
He moaned, closing his eyes and savouring the taste. It was definitely one of the best pies he had ever tasted. He wasn’t sure if he’d call it the ‘best’ though.
The demons dropped the form to the ground, one of them looking up at Dean. “We heard you were looking for this.”
“Yeah, I know. He told me.” Dean shrugged. “He’s planning on easing me into it. Start with training in the workshop first and then ease me into the business side of things.”
The other demons were causing issues though. They didn’t like how close Dean was to Crowley. The alphas in particular had tried several times to put Dean ‘in his place’, leaving Dean no alternative but to kill them. Crowley had reprimanded him on more than one occasion for killing important demons. On a plus side slaughtering a few of them had caused the others to back off.
Castiel walked Dean to the door, unlocking it and letting him out. Dean paused on the other side and turned back to Castiel. He thought of how to phrase things. Dean was never really good with goodbyes. But he did find that Castiel was interesting, and not to mention kind of hot. He didn’t get why people found him hard to talk to. Dean didn’t seem to have a problem with it.
“Anna’s a whore?” Gabriel pulled a face, one mixed with disgust and surprise. “I didn’t realise she’d fallen that far.”
“And how about Heaven?” Dean continued. “Whose fault is it that the gates got slammed shut and all the angels got booted out?”
“Family my size there’s more than one,” Gabriel said. He sighed. “It’s my lunch break. I’m going for a walk to cool down. Ring me if you need me.”
They both looked up as Dean moved, slowly waking up. Sam grabbed the holy water flask from the table, unscrewing the lid. Beside him Castiel drew his angel blade at the ready. Dean had tried to escape on them at least two more times in the last few hours, and each time they had increased his bonds. The escapes usually happened right after he awoke so they were ready.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I usually ring him on a Saturday but I couldn’t today. I’ll probably call him tomorrow provided Dad’s not there.”
Sam couldn’t even imagine what Castiel must have gone through. He knew from the cage what Hell could be like. Hearing about what Dean had done to Castiel made him feel sick. He reached out and placed a hand gently on Castiel’s arm and squeezed. He wanted Castiel to know that he wasn’t mad at him.
“Running a business is a lot of work,” she told him. “Hours of paperwork and having to keep up with inventory.”
That was a lie. Dean knew that Castiel had access to the safe. He’d taken the till out of it that very morning, and Dean had seen him put the till away last Saturday.
“Question is what to do next,” Dean said. “We’ve got all afternoon and I doubt you want to be cooped up in the car with me.”
Gabriel sighed. “Okay, that’s reasonable. I’ll give you that one. But why did you keep meeting her?”
“Yeap,” Gabriel said. “Just keep doing what you’re doing. You’ll be fine.” He glanced at his watch, eyebrows rising. “And I better skedaddle otherwise the fire breathing goddess will be on
Sam stared at him for a long time, Castiel’s words sinking in. He felt a wave of anger wash over him. “Was it you?’
Castiel added a second finger, Dean relishing the feeling of it inside him. He rolled his hips slightly in time with the movement of Castiel’s hand. Castiel’s fingers were just missing the spot inside him, Dean feeling a little bit of frustration wash over him.
Dean paused, frowning. He sobered and leaned forward again, the fun gone from the moment. “No, I’m not.”
Dean nodded. He could see that. “So the sugar shop doing special orders again today?” Dean asked as he began to take the chairs off the tables.
“It’s probably busier than normal,” Kali said. “Although it gets busy during the Summer with all the tourist groups coming through.”
Reaching the motel Dean pulled into the parking lot, switching off the engine. He sat for a moment, glancing quickly at Castiel and noting that the angel seemed to be waiting for him to move. Instead Dean cleared his throat, licking his dry lips.
“You mean about your pet’s grace?” Crowley said. “I had a conversation with Sam two days ago. They have nothing although they are interrogating Metatron as we speak.”
Gabriel spent the next hour before opening teaching Dean the beginnings of using the machine. Dean picked it up relatively quickly and was soon able to make basic drinks. Gabriel showed him a note hidden just below the view of customers that explained what each drink size and strength meant in regards to its name which helped a lot.
Kali pulled her phone out, scrolling through it and bringing up a photo. “Here. This is what he looks like.”
Anna reached across the table and rested a hand on his arm. “Remember – you’re stronger than they think you are. You can be anything you want to be.”
“Handy thing that bond,” Crowley said. “Although I don’t know how he managed to escape. That was one of my strongest cells.”
“Squirrel,” Crowley said as he spotted Dean. “Been a couple of days since you were in here. How goes the torture?”
“I know,” Bobby said, unable to help his smile. “Anyway you should grab a shower while we’re waiting for dinner to cook.”
“The Mark began to control Dean,” Castiel explained. “His demon was becoming stronger. He was losing control of himself as the Mark took over.”
“Look, I’m sure Gabriel and Castiel still keep an eye on them,” Dean said. “Maybe some of your other siblings. If they’re the only ones still at home then the others can’t be bullying them, right?”
“In a manner of speaking,” Isiah confirmed. “We suspect even Metatron may not know the exact location of the grace himself.”
There was a knock on the door, Dean’s eyes snapping back open. He rolled onto his side and glanced toward it. He wondered what Sam could possibly be wanting at this hour.
“I don’t know what to think,” Benny said. “I just know is that you shouldn’t be spending time with her.”
“So I’ve been thinking,” Bobby said as he took a drink from his cup. “I want you to pull that entire engine out of the junker and take it apart completely.”
Benny left them to it, Dean picking up his wrap and biting into it. He felt a little less guilty knowing it was one of the cheaper things on the menu, but he still didn’t like that he wasn’t going to pay. Then again he wasn’t one about to turn down free food, and he could see that Castiel was going through a similar struggle in his own head.
Castiel nodded and did so, Dean watching as he folded them and hooked them over the back of one of the chairs. Dean waited for him to say something as he removed his own shoes.
Bobby was still in the workshop on Sunday, Dean wandering down to see if there was anything he could do to help. Bobby had chased him back out and told him to make the most of his day off. From a glance Dean could see that Bobby was near completing the Cadillac. Dean was definitely going to have to make Bobby something nice to celebrate when he finished. He wondered how often Bobby got big jobs like this and if it would be a regular occurrence.
“Actually they have,” Sam said. He had been pondering whether or not he should tell Crowley about his meeting with Hannah and had decided that he would the next time Crowley got in contact with him. It had been three weeks now since their meeting in the playground, Sam running through his head exactly what he was going to say.
Dean did as he was told, then retreated back behind the counter to wait for the first customers of the day. They weren’t long coming with people stopping in on their way to work or school. Dean didn’t remember it being this busy the day before but he had been preoccupied with just getting the drinks right. He found himself glancing at the cheat sheet a few times as he prepared the coffee, still being careful not to spill any.
“You’re not like the other angels,” Dean observed. “You feel emotions. You feel doubt. You don’t follow orders. You actually have free will. As far as the other angels are concerned you’re broken.”
Castiel looked like a deer in the headlights for a moment, glancing around the diner. After a moment he seemed to relax, a slight smile on his face. “I’d like that.”
“See, that’s just weird,” Dean said. “Why would you name your kids after angels when you don’t go to church?”
“Just the basic ones to begin with,” Gabriel said. “Once you get the hang of them we’ll include a few more.”
Bobby leaned back in his seat, stretching his back. “So what’s your new boss like? I take it you met him.”
Come Monday morning Dean found himself standing outside the coffee shop again. His hands were cold so he had them buried deep in the pockets of his jacket. The mornings were definitely getting colder, but Dean was thankful for the fact it wasn’t raining. The clouds looked threatening though so Dean couldn’t wait to get inside the shop.
“Nah, I don’t think you’re going to fuck me tonight,” Dean said, grinning wide. “I think I’m going to fuck you while you’re wearing that trench coat.”
Castiel looked away, staring at a mark on the opposite wall as the warm heat of Dean’s mouth surrounded him. Dean wasn’t gentle or slow, seeming to be keen on getting Castiel to come as quickly as he could. His head bobbed up and down in Castiel’s lap, Castiel once again trying to force his bonds to break and finding himself trapped fast.
“So what they’re doing to her is fine?” Dean asked, feeling a flicker of anger. He couldn’t believe that Bobby would agree to something like that.
The rush seemed to go forever, and when the last of it finally petered out Dean looked at the clock and was surprised to find that it had gone on longer than it normally did. There wasn’t going to be much of a break between now and the next school rush so Dean took the opportunity to get through his chores as quickly as he could.
“You really thought we’d be able to go through with our plan while you’re naked?” Crowley asked, dropping the clothes onto the bed beside Castiel. “Now get dressed.”
That was why, even though he was an omega, no one realised he was. That and the suppressants he had been taking since his first heat. Most omegas took them these days and the suppressants made them register as betas to everyone who didn’t know better. The only time an omega went off their suppressants was when they wanted an alpha or intended to breed.
“That whole damned family is weird,” Bobby said. “But they practically run this town, so no one looks too deeply at their dirty laundry.”
“That’s not how he sees it,” Dean said, feeling sadness wash over him. “I just wanted to make him proud but instead I made him angry.”
“I’ll mention it next time I do,” Dean said. He reached out, tugging at Castiel’s trench coat. “Hey, can I ask you something?”
Dean frowned and wondered what he meant. It took a moment for the puzzle pieces to click into place. “You mean Anna.”
“My mother was my teacher,” Anna said. “When I told her about what it was like back home she offered to take me in. One day it just got too much and I ran away. They took me in and I haven’t looked back since.”
He closed his eyes, trying to sense Dean through their bond. He knew that Dean had been killing. He had been able to sense the adrenaline as Dean had been fighting. He had caught glimpses in his mind of what Dean was doing and he had seen Dean squaring off against werewolves. He had been a long way from where Castiel was but it was still not far enough away that Castile couldn’t sense him.
Dean sank back into his seat, gripping the arms of the chair tightly. Crowley waited until the last of the demons had left the room and closed the doors behind them before he rounded on Dean. He stared him down.
“I’m sure they’ve tried,” Dean said, taking a sizeable drink from the Whiskey. He gestured to it. “This is good stuff. Where’d you get it?”
“Yeah. I think I was six last time we were there,” Sam said. “Anyway he’s been calling the schools to find somewhere for me, so next week you call we’ll be in Illinois.”
There hadn’t been that many more customers come in before the shop closed, Dean and Castiel cleaning the store and putting the money in the safe before Castiel had locked everything up. Afterward Dean had agreed to meet Castiel at Benny’s before wandering to his car. He had driven it down Main Street to the diner, pulling into the car park and spotting the Lincoln Continental as it pulled in beside him.
Dean finished setting up the store, watching as Castiel did all the things that Dean was used to seeing Kali do. This was definitely not Castiel’s first rodeo. Dean wondered how long it would be before Kali trusted him to do all the jobs. Probably a year given the rate things were going. Dean still didn’t think they’d fully gotten over the Anna thing either.
“You should not have let the angels know,” Castiel said. “They will see Dean as dangerous and seek to destroy him at all costs.”
“And you’re stuck here.” Crowley ran his eyes over him, Castiel sensing that he was looking deeper than the surface layer to Castiel’s grace. “I can see it decaying. Unfortunately there’s not much I can do to prevent that outside of finding your own grace. I’m guessing that won’t decay as fast.”
“Lose her number if you have it,” Bobby said. “Cut her off completely. Word’s probably already gotten out you’re associating with her. You can’t afford to be seen with her.”
“Because I was hoping we could share it,” Dean said. He leaned in, pressing a kiss to the side of Castiel’s face and burying his face into his neck so he could breathe him in. “I think we should take it slow. Go on a few more dates before we sleep together.”
They found the bakery without any real hassle. Castiel knew the directions and Dean spotted the banner making the pie claim as they drove down the main street. He found a park not far from the bakery and they walked back. The bakery was busy, most people picking up orders for cakes and cupcakes, with the occasional pie.
“Sam, we have bigger things to worry about,” Hannah said. “A Nephilim has been created. We must find it and destroy it before it can be born.”
“Personally I think he should just let Feathers die,” Crowley said. “But he wants his grace which means technically we should be working together.”
“I’ll double check any work you do,” Bobby said. “But you’re the one who’s signing off on it. It won’t officially be a workshop job.”
Dean decided to take the opportunity to count the stock, noting that they were low on small cups. He headed out the back and found the packet, opening it and grabbing a stack. He heard a voice, surprised by another customer. He figured Castiel had it as he picked up the cups and headed back to the front of the store only to stop dead.
“That’s the lot,” she said, locking the till. There was no money in it, Dean knew, but she always locked it anyway. “You’re right to go.”
The bath bombs had turned out to be soothing though. Sam had convinced Dean to give one of them a try, Dean reluctantly relaxing back in the tub. He had almost fallen asleep. It had been years since he had simply taken a bath to relax. His whole body had thanked him for it.
Interestingly Dean had begun to doze after the last injection. He had passed out from the pain after Castiel had thrown holy water at him. Castiel watched him for any sign of deception but couldn’t see any. He set his jaw, running his gaze over Dean and feeling a pang of protectiveness. It was altogether possible that this ritual could have the effect of killing Dean. Castiel was ready to take that chance if it meant Dean would be human again.
“Busy,” Crowley said. “Hell to run and all that.” He looked to the side and spotted Hannah. “I see you brought a friend.”
Dean grabbed a knife and began to make their sandwiches, having to admit that Castiel was very good at keeping secrets. He hadn’t known at all about Castiel and his rock carving. Dean wondered if maybe he should take up a hobby. Castiel had commented once that he loved Dean’s drawing. Maybe he should draw a picture for Castiel for his “becoming human” day. He just hoped he would be as good at keeping it a secret as Castiel was.
Dean pulled out his phone and unlocked it, sliding it across the table to her. She entered in her number and saved it. Dean took the phone back and sent her a text message so that she could have his number in return.
Anna nodded. “It’s been so much better since I left, although they still try to make things hard for me.”
It didn’t take long before Castiel was flushed, Dean marvelling at the fact that he didn’t seem to sweat no matter what they did. Dean smoothed his hands up Castiel’s thighs and then over his chest, tweaking his nipples just so. He admired the way Castiel’s muscles were rippling beneath his fingers, the faint pink to his skin. The trench coat was flapping ever so slightly as they moved.
Castiel picked up the bag, taking the money out of the till and dropping it into the bag. Dean assessed his options, wondering if he would have time to jump the counter and tackle the man. He looked at the counter and realised that it was definitely too high for him. He’d have to go around, and there was no way he’d make it in time.
Dean finished straightening his clothing as he walked through Hell back to the throne room. He’d spent the last few hours with Castiel, fucking him twice more. Each time he’d exposed his neck and offered for Castiel to mate him; each time Castiel had refused. It was frustrating. Dean had known they were truemates and had for a while. Now Castiel knew he had hoped he’d jump at the chance. Apparently not.
“A few people,” Dean admitted. He didn’t see any reason not to tell Castiel given what Castiel had disclosed to him. Dean was more than happy to play Twenty Questions with him. “We moved around a lot and I managed to find someone in each town we stayed in since I was about 15.”
“Will probably take me longer given I’m only working part time,” Dean said. “Bobby’s not exactly paying me much for my apprenticeship.”
“Is that an attempt at humour?’ Castiel asked, his own voice sounding foreign to him. It had been a while since he had spoken to anyone.
“Always,” she said. “Either way it’s a busy few weekends. And the extra business at the sweet shop means extra business at the coffee shop.”
It took Dean a lot longer than he had hoped to find the man that Crowley had sent him to find. And it was a man – not a demon. The way Crowley had talked Dean had expected the man to be some kind of monster who was too hard for any other demon to kill, but no, he had just been an ordinary man. Nothing special about him although he did seem to be adept at witchcraft.
“Leave it be, Hannah,” Castiel said. “There will not be a second Nephilim. Not from the host and angel in question.”
He pressed their lips together again and found Castiel to be extremely responsive. Castiel was clearly still not used to kissing but that didn’t mean he was bad either. Dean knew that there was a lot he could teach the angel, and he planned on taking all the time in the world. But right now he was content with just kissing Castiel until sleep finally caught up with him.
“And I thought I was working hard,” Dean said. “That sounds like a nightmare. Maybe we shouldn’t meet on Saturday’s if he’s schedule is so packed.”
Dean watched as Bobby retrieved his meal, checking to see if it was still hot. It must have been because Bobby made no move to reheat it, dropping into his seat after retrieving a beer to go with his meal. Dean watched as Bobby ate, Dean noting the worry lines on Bobby’s face.
Sam felt his stomach twist. He still hadn’t fully come to terms with the fact that Dean was a demon. He almost needed to see it for himself before he would believe it. He didn’t entirely trust Crowley, but still this wasn’t something that Crowley would lie about. The Dean he knew would never have allied himself with Crowley though which means that Dean must be using him for something.
Either way Dean was now mated. He absently rubbed the mating bite on his neck that was right on his scent gland. You couldn’t see it unless Dean pulled his shirt collar down so the majority of demons didn’t know he even had it. Dean was still a little disappointed about the whole thing. He had expected the bond to be stronger than it was given they were truemates. He wondered if maybe Castiel was somehow repressing their bond from his end. He wouldn’t put it past the angel.
“You really should be moving around.” Crowley frowned. “Dean has a thing or two to learn about keeping prisoners.”
He saw Castiel’s nose twitch, the alpha sucking in a deep breath. His eyes widened. “You’re an omega?’
After a while Dean began to doze off, almost dropping his phone in the process. He slipped it back into his pocket and gazed around the room. He briefly contemplated trying to read one of the many books in the room but Crowley had almost filleted him the last time he had tried to touch anything in this room. It was a “no touching” room. Considering the amount of potions and things in here Dean could understand that.
