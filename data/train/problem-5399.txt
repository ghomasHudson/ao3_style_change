“Oh, no sir, we’re terribly sorry. My wife did not mean to imply that you and your partner didn’t have the right child. Simply, well. Peter is a bit of a trouble maker. We have actually been having rather significant problems with him recently.”
The pair part way with Ned at the school gates, they time their walk quite well as the train has just pulled into the station when they arrive.
Harry’s breath ghosts over Peter’s face as he continues to sing along so softly that if there were other people in the room only Peter would be able to hear him. Harry smells faintly of tobacco and cologne and once again Peter finds himself captivated by the boy. Frozen and staring as Harry’s eyes slowly close and he leans in just a bit closer so that their lips are pressed together lightly.
Not usually one for confrontation Peter has concluded that it will be the only way to get the former assassin off his back. So, a few hours after their bizarre interaction in the gym Peter finds himself in the elevator on the way to Bruce and Natasha’s floor to address the woman’s suspicions head on.
“Romamov! What the hell are you playing at?” The intense staring match between her and Peter breaks as Tony comes running into the room. She moves off of Peter allowing his dad to help him up off the ground.
“We’re so proud of you Peter.” Steve pulls the boy into a hug as soon as his husband releases the boy.
They’re walking down the hallway now, MJ a few paces ahead of them, so Ned whispers slightly when he says, “Whatever you say Peter. Why don’t you just ask her to go an a date?” With that he heads off to get in his mom’s car that is already waiting in front of the school.
Peter ignores the way his heart speeds up and how natural the weight of Harry’s arm feels around his shoulders.
“No, you shouldn’t have!” Peter knows he’s shouting, but he can’t help it. “I’m going out.” Bucky tries to call him back but the teen doesn’t listen, scared of what he might say if he turns back now.
Confused, Peter pockets his phone and pushes through the crowd of students and parents to the area behind the stage. Standing there waiting on him are Steve and Tony ‘in disguise’.
Bucky picks his arm up and reattaches it with ease. “Don’t be jealous just because she thought of at least ten improvements you didn’t.”
“Actually, on that note. Just a forewarning Peter.” He turns his attention to Steve now who shifts on the couch so that he can face Peter fully. “Bucky can be a bit…”
Peter wolfs down his sandwich in record time as Ned waits on baited breath to barrage the boy with questions. Peter can see the desperation clear in the other boys features and thanks the heavens once again for blessing him with Ned Leeds.
Spider-Man is too unpredictable. Familiar, yes, but much more unpredictable than school. School has a routine; always starts at the same time, Peter knows which classes to go to and when, he knows the teachers and the students. It’s rare that anything changes at school, it’s a nice comfort. Being Spider-Man is unpredictable and dangerous in a way that school could never be.
The blinds on Peter’s windows slowly open to let sunshine stream into the room. “Good morning Master Parker. Mr Rogers and Mr Stark are having breakfast in the kitchen when you’re ready to join them, they insist that there is no rush.”
His mood does lift slightly when both of his adoptive parents engulf him in a hug as soon as he steps out of the elevator. They weren’t due to be home until later that night so it is a nice surprise to have them home earlier. They catch up about Peter’s day at school and how the mission was, which Peter personally thinks is far more interesting than how his English exam went.
He decides to take a seat on one of the many bar stools sitting by the island and watches intently as Natasha takes a drink of her coffee. “Have I done something to upset you?”
Steve explains that while most of the Avengers have floors in the tower they don’t all live there full-time. “The only people that live here constantly right now are Natasha, Bruce and Bucky. Is that right Tony?”
“This is an honour, really sir.” Peter can hear Mrs. Baker laying the pleasantries on thick which must mean this is somebody hoping to adopt one of the kids in the house.
Peter’s slightly shocked, he wasn’t sure if he could go as far as to invite his friend over to the tower, he had planned on meeting Ned in a nearby park to tell him. “Would that be okay?”
The girls mumbles something that Peter can’t quite hear. She clears her throat and again in a louder voice says. “My friends call me MJ.”
“Well, this is quite worrying. Anyway, that is a matter for another time. I need you to go and get changed for me, nice clean clothes please. There’s a couple downstairs that are interested in adopting you.” It’s difficult to not let Mrs. Warren’s infectious warmth get his hopes up. Even as he’s getting dressed Peter reminds himself that this might not go the way he is hoping it will. Given his track record chances were this couple would take one look at him and decide that the Bakers had been right all along.
“That should be fairly easy considering I’m standing under the Avengers Tower.” Harry laughs and Peter has to stifle his own.
Thor goes back to joking and chatting with the group as if nothing happened but Peter gets the impression that Natasha isn’t going to let it go as easily. If the expression with a single raised eyebrow and head cocked to the side she is currently watching him with is anything to go by.
Peter considers this for a moment while looking deep into Harry’s eyes where his emotions are laid bare. He reaches out to take the other boy’s hands. “Sometimes. But just because they’re gone doesn’t mean they’re not with us. The one’s that love us never really leave us.”
He certainly couldn’t deny that the very definition of a date fits perfectly with what they had been doing all afternoon. He also can’t deny that he finds MJ very pretty, and he really does like her a lot.
By the next morning the Tower is strikingly quiet, Peter notices it particularly when he decides to have breakfast on the main floor and isn’t greeted by the now familiar sight of Steve whistling and cooking whatever his husband has convinced him to make that morning, usually some form of baked good.
The pair are waiting for him smiling like the cat who got the cream. Bucky shoots him a sympathetic smile as Tony and Steve begin a barrage of questions.
“It’s not even your work Stark.” Bucky strolls out of the elevator into the workshop. “Don’t let him fool you Peter, he’s not as smart as he wants everyone to think he is.” Bucky whispers making the younger boy laugh.
The first thing he spots upon leaving the elevator is the stack of books waiting to be packed in preparation for returning to school tomorrow. The sight causes dread and anxiety to rise so Peter grabs his backpack and heads down to Tony’s workshop, planning to tell the man he’s going to meet Ned, then to actually go out and patrol for a while.
This one is a bit shorter than my usual chapters, but there's a lot of dialogue and a heavy amount of family-bonding in this chapter which I really enjoyed writing.
Getting back into the swing of being Spider-Man takes Peter a bit longer. Not only does he still carry guilt about not being able to save Uncle Ben, there’s now the added crushing weight of thinking that if he had just decided to stay out a bit longer, to swing home and climb in through his window rather than changing and coming in through the front door, that maybe he could have saved his Aunt May.
The green-guy, as Peter has dubbed him, speeds towards him again throwing more of the small orbs, each one exploding and slowly destroying the building bit by bit. Green-guy continues his pursuit of Spider-Man, cackling maniacally the whole time.
Peter sighs, just when he thought he was going to get away with this, why did he ever think he could keep his identity hidden from Iron Man and Captain America? Just when it seems hopeless an idea dawns on him. “Hey JARVIS. Can we make a deal?”
Bucky raises his hands up. “Whoa kid don’t flip your wig, I was just concerned that’s all. Stevie used to get picked on real bad back in the day, and I know times have changed but there will always be homophobic jerks out there.”
His words hurt. “You know what Harry? I’m sick of this attitude, if you don’t want to be my friend anymore just because I’m dating MJ, then that’s fine. But don’t pretend this is about anything other than the fact that you clearly don’t like MJ.” Peter turns around and begins to walk home.
“Dude! I don’t think we’re supposed to be in here.” Ned whispers, but he follows Peter further into the lobby nonetheless. “Um, what are you doing? Where did you get that?!” He exclaims as Peter pulls a security pass out of his pocket, tapping it to a pad on the wall beside an elevator.
Peter's friendship with Harry develops, he has another run in with his new mysterious foe and Bucky helps Peter cope after a rough night.
“Um, you could say that…” Peter scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. “Not really someone as much as the entire student body.” The new boy laughs, the sound is warm and positive, it eases just a little bit of the tension Peter is carrying.
“Sorry.” He shuffles his feet staring down hard at the kitchen counter. Peter takes a deep shuddering breath and then explains. “I found out that my dad, Richard Parker, worked for OSCORP and I would really like to read some of his work but it’s not available to the public, and I know it’s like totally inappropriate but could you maybe…”
This goes on for about half an hour until Ned is somewhat satisfied, more like he finally runs out of questions. “This is insane dude. So, were you fighting that new guy, the Green Goblin, last night?”
It’s not like Peter is expecting Michelle to shout at him or to be overly mean, it’s just that this behaviour is so out of character he’s legitimately worried about her. In all the years he has known her Peter has never seen Michelle willingly engage in a one-on-one conversation with another person.
The smile remains on Peter’s face looking at his adoptive parents. They’re so openly comfortable with one another, Peter hopes he can be that relaxed and in love with someone in the future. “Harry has tickets to a concert tonight, would it be okay if I went?”
Nothing. Not even when he got back to his room that night, when he was alone in the dark and the silence. Nothing.
He follows Steve and Tony into the elevator and they explain to him what all of the floors are, although Peter is fairly certain he’ll need a refresher because there are close to one hundred buttons on the panel.
Black Widow waltzes over to him next, every step she takes is calculated and precise giving the impression that she’s floating and not actually walking, Peter is mesmerised. “Natasha. Nice to meet you.” She smiles at him, but Peter can tell she’s surveying him and trying to figure him out.
Peter: Well you obviously don’t think it’s that boring if you’re texting me asking when I’ll be back.
Peter meets Rhodey, the Super Dads head off on a mission and while they're away Peter's life get just a bit more complicated.
“Peter, this situation appears to be something I should inform Mr Stark and Mr Rogers about.” He curses out loud, he had totally forgotten about JARVIS.
“Oh, he’s this new kid at school. Ned and I have been hanging out with him lately, he’s really cool, and he loves Star Wars almost as much as Ned and I do. It’s okay if he comes this weekend as well, right?”
Also, has anyone been watching WandaVision? I'm utterly obsessed. It's nice to have new Marvel content again after almost two years of nothing!
He’s certainly not pulling punches the same way he was with Steve but Natasha can tell that he still isn’t really trying. Resolve hardening, she moves forward quickly attempting to back the boy into a corner and just as expected he dodges every hit, eventually sending his hands forward with lightning fast speed to catch both of Natasha’s hands just as his back hits the wall.
Someone clears their throat causing Peter to jump, he hadn’t even noticed someone else was out here. Not someone. Harry.
Sam and Bucky explain that they’ve been dating for a few months now but they didn’t want to tell anyone because it was so new. Once his parents have finished gloating they tell the couple how happy they are for them.
“Peter, may we have a word?” Mr. Baker asks one night after dinner. Peter knows by now that when they ask to speak to him like this it’s usually to shout at him for something. Normally because he’s been loud when having nightmares, or because he sometimes shuts himself in the bathroom while having panic attacks, preventing others from using it. This time however the prickle on the back of Peter’s neck tells him that something is different.
“Someone’s having fun in the kitchen? Unheard of.” Tony walks in and wraps an arm around Steve’s waist. “So, I’m intrigued now, why was there fun being had?”
“I should really get home now. Thanks for the coffee, nerd.” She walks away without another word but from MJ’s attitude alone Peter is fairly certain he missed something.
“Except for… me…” Their eyes meet for a second and then they both become very interested in the floor as the elevator speeds upwards.
Unfortunately the Green-guy picks this moment to develop an interest in Spider-Man again, chasing after the two boys as Peter tries desperately to get Harry to a safe place and out of danger all together.
Natasha Romanov is many things and unobservant does not appear on that list. Since her very first interactions with Peter Parker a short few months ago she could tell there was something lurking beneath the surface. Something hidden behind the façade of an innocent geeky teenager.
“Would it really be so bad if they knew Peter? They could help you. I mean you’re safe and not dead, but last night was really scary. What if it happens again? Or gets worse?”
As they were leaving the school courtyard Ned had wiggled his eye brows and winked at Peter until he eventually disappeared out of sight. Peter has desperately tried to push all of the comments everyone has been making out of his mind but the closer he gets to being alone with MJ the more nervous he feels. Maybe this is a date?
It’s different from holding hands with MJ. He felt nervous and sweaty when their hands met across the bus seat. But with Harry it feels natural, like their hands belong together.
Peter swears he can see a blush dusting across Harry’s cheeks. “Thanks Peter, I might just take you up on that.” They share a soft smile almost not realising that the train has pulled into their stop.
Natasha doesn’t say anything she just lifts Peter’s pant leg up far enough to view the injured area. After inspecting and prodding the area a few times she gets up to go to the bathroom and returns with a roll of bandages. Wordlessly she wraps Peter’s leg tightly and he instantly feels some of the pressure on his leg alleviate.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Tony broaches the subject tentatively, giving Peter the opportunity to say no. But Peter is trying to get better at expressing his emotions, he’s finding that talking things through helps with future panic attacks. So slowly but surely he explains what caused the panic, Tony and Steve listening intently all the while.
They manage to snag an empty couch where Peter sits in the middle with Ned making love heart eyes at Liz on one side of him, and MJ and Gwen chatting away on the other side. Turns out the two girls know each other quite well, but any time he asks how he’s met with giggles or stoic silence, so he decides to give up on that pursuit of knowledge.
“In the William Shakespeare work A Midsummer’s Night Dream there is only one non-human relationship, which pair form this romance?”
“Of course it is, come sit with us.” Peter makes his way over to the couch and sits carefully beside Bucky who smiles reassuringly. “So,” Sam begins again after a few minutes of quiet, aside from the TV. “Harry seems like a nice kid.”
Despite the cleanliness of the room throwing Peter off slightly, he is actually thankful to be in such a quiet atmosphere. The police station was loud and chaotic, which did not help with the significant amount of stress that Peter was already experiencing. In the quiet of the room Peter is able to focus on his breathing and calm his senses that have been haywire all evening. Eventually he begins to feel like he is finally back in his body, back in touch with reality. As much as this pleases Peter, it also means that all of this has been real and not a terrible nightmare like the young boy had been hoping. Before he can start over thinking and panicking again Peter decides to focus his hearing to try and pick up on what Mrs. Warren and the Bakers are discussing.
Rhodey, Sam and Clint split their time between the tower and elsewhere due to work and family commitments but Sam is apparently around a lot more often than the others. Steve and Tony share a knowing look while explaining this, peaking Peter’s curiosity, but he figures it isn’t his place to pry.
Thor smirks at the man and places the hammer back onto the table. “Be my guest.” He gestures to the object with a humorous glint in his eye.
“Okay… Well, just save me a dance, alright?” Harry winks and then waltzes through the doors of his apartment building leaving a dazed, confused and blushing Peter standing on the street alone.
The Green Goblin pulls out two small sliver disks and sets them spinning towards Peter. As they get closer he can see that there are four blades pointing out of the disks in all directions. The Goblin keeps firing them at a rapid pace and Peter has never been more grateful that his Spidey-sense allows him to see oncoming targets as if they were in slow motion.
Even now, sober, in the light of day Peter feels lightheaded and giddy at the memory. He almost can’t quite believe it happened however as he stumbles out of bed and catches sight of himself in the mirror there is a painfully glaring reminder of the night displayed clear on his face.
Peter greets his other guardian and takes a seat at the table where a breakfast of toast, bacon and eggs awaits him. Truth be told he doesn’t really feel like eating but he doesn’t want to be rude, so he forces down two pieces of toast, some bacon and a forkful of eggs.
Following a quick introduction Ned slots into the conversation, taking over with fresh excitement about a new Spider-Man sighting. Ned’s interest in the masked vigilante borders on obsession, he lives and breathes all things Spider-Man. Peter is fairly certain he has notifications set up on his phone to track news and updates about his alter-ego.
Harry sits down on the bench and lifts the lid carefully. Everyone else situates themselves in various areas, between the couches and the bar stools nearby. Peter moves to stand beside Bucky and Sam near the window.
Clint suggests a number of methods including a flash mob, a barbershop quartet and sky writing. All ideas are shot down immediately by the rest of the group for being impractical. Peter personally doesn’t think he would have the confidence or bravado to follow through with any of those ideas anyway.
The news headline flashing on screen proclaims a new foe has been spotted battling Spider-Man in front of the Oscorp building. Shaky cell phone footage shows the fight from different angles and Peter watches himself rescue civilians over and over again.
“Yeah, MJ is cool.” Peter happily shoves a forkful of pasta into his mouth. “It got a bit weird at the end though, I think she was annoyed with me but I don’t know why.”
Michelle is the only one in the library when Ned and Peter show up after school for decathlon practice. They had shown Harry to a Biology lab for tutoring before coming walking to practice so they assumed they’d be the last two to show up.
Slowly the two boys slump closer together, Harry’s arm comes up to wrap around Peter’s shoulders and he pulls the other close against him. It’s very cosy and feels right. Being under Harry’s arm, snuggled up against him, feels natural just like everything with the boy does. Peter can’t quite believe he was denying his feelings for the blonde boy for so long. He wants to travel back in time and slap his past self across the face.
Peter stands up now, feeling anger coursing through him. “It’s nothing to do with that! It’s just a dumb joke. What are you trying to say?”
Harry moves away from the railing now too, closer to Peter again.  “Oh yeah, what about you? Where’s your little girlfriend run off to Peter?”
When the call ends Peter sets about clearing the rest of his notifications which is when he comes across one text message he missed earlier. It’s from Harry:
Steve nods. “Absolutely sir. Tony has been tracking it for weeks now.” Tony launches into an explanation of the tracking process and notable points of activity over the past few months. Eventually he hands over to Bruce who discusses the energy signals the tech is giving off which confirms it to be alien.
There’s barely a split second between the words leaving Harry’s mouth and Norman raising a fist above his head. Without even thinking Peter pushes Harry out of the way and lets the fist come into direct contact with the top of his cheek. The sting left behind promises a black eye by the morning.
Peter joins in with the laughter. “Actually Harry your talents haven’t failed you today, you’re in the right place. Follow me.” Without waiting for a reaction Peter strolls back through the doors of the Tower.
Ned rolls his eyes and sits up so that his feet dangle over the edge of the bed. “I’m guessing you’re smiling like an idiot at your phone because you’re texting MJ. Dude, she’s literally down the hall. Just go talk to her.”
“Alright Pete I can take a hint, old man’s cramping your style. I’m leaving don’t worry. JARVIS will call you when it’s time for dinner.” With one Peter hair ruffle Tony’s away and the boys set about tackling their newest Lego project.
“Why do you keep saying that? Why would it matter if it was homophobic? It doesn’t affect me, because I’m not gay!”
“It’s, um. It’s really no problem Mr. Rogers.” Peter says stuttering under the gaze of Captain America, still in complete shock that this is even happening.
Clint stands and strides over to the object. He places one hand onto the handle and pulls upwards. Nothing happens. Then again with two hands. Again, nothing.
Mrs. Warren takes her leave about twenty minutes later, after explaining to Peter that she will be back tomorrow to discuss more about the foster care system, adoption and everything else with him. The Bakers are nice enough, if not a bit too stern, they show Peter to his room where there is a clean pair of pyjamas and a toothbrush waiting for him. As the Bakers leave Peter gets acquainted with his new surroundings and sends a thanks to whatever God might be out there that he doesn’t have to share his room.
“Just stupid school stuff, nothing to worry about.” He tries to reassure Steve but he can tell it hasn’t worked. Desperate to avoid questions he gets up hastily and mumbles something about going to the bathroom. As he walks down the hallway towards the bathroom he can feel Steve’s and Tony’s eyes burning into his back.
After landing in front of the blonde boy Peter sees the recognition of Spider-Man’s presence briefly pass across Harry’s features before the pair are up and swinging through the air.
As Ned leaves the room Peter decides he should probably check his phone now. Talking about not wanting to cause his adoptive parent’s any stress reminded him that they’ve probably tried to get in touch with him and might be panicking, Tony tends to do that.
Every time he tries to move the beam the motion intensifies the pain in his leg. He’s panting hard trying desperately to get a breath in knowing that if he can’t move this beam he will definitely die in here.
Apparently, Harry had started sending people along to his house before he had even left the school grounds, so when they finally arrive there are at least a hundred people already wandering around dancing and drinking. The apartment is certainly big enough to hold this many people but Harry has hired a DJ to play and the flashing lights on the DJ stand make the space feel a lot smaller than it actually is.
Peter only just remembers to text Happy and his dads to let them all know about going back to Harry’s place, although he doesn’t mention that every other person in their school has also been invited. As far as the adults in his life know Peter’s on his way to a small gathering of just his close friends.
“Sorry dad it was kind of a last-minute decision.” Harry’s posture has changed dramatically since Norman entered the room. He’s standing straighter, almost rigid, and his hands are balled in fists by his side.
Sam and Bucky are sitting casually on his couch when the boy steps out onto his floor. “Hey Pete.” Sam greets him as if it is a common occurrence to find the pair here and not the last thing Peter was expecting.
“No, no, no. JARVIS please. I would really like this to remain a secret. They can’t know I’m Spider-Man. Can you please keep this between us?”
As the room swims into focus Peter finally begins to feel in control again. His breathing returns to a regular pace as he focuses in on Tony’s words.
At some point he’s introduced to JARVIS who didn’t make his presence known until Tony formally introduced Peter to him, which he greatly appreciated as Peter isn’t sure how he would have reacted if the ceiling had started speaking to him with no warning.
Ned: Oh yeah bro sorry. Michelle asked for your number, y’know cause she’s the captain now, and I’m honestly scared of her so I just gave her it.
Happy is waiting for them a couple of blocks away in the same spot where Steve and Tony dropped Peter off this morning in the aim to not draw any unnecessary attention. Ned is chipper as always in greeting the man however Peter is beginning to suspect that Happy exists in a permanent state of grumpiness if his gruff and reluctant “Hello” is anything to go by.
“We understand that you have been through a great deal of hardship in your life Peter. However, we want to make it clear that no amount of recklessness or poor behaviour will be tolerated here.” Mrs. Baker becomes very serious, fixing Peter with an intense stare. “You seem like a very polite young man, and I’ve been informed that you perform well at school. Our hope is that this continues. We have several rules here Mr. Parker and we expect them to be followed at all times. Is that clear?”
At some point Harry pushes Peter up against the railing of the balcony, their mouths only detaching to breath in air when their heads start to swim from lack of oxygen. They kiss for what feels like an eternity until a yell of anger has them jumping apart.
Tony takes a seat on the stool beside Peter now turning to face the boy fully. “Speaking of duty kid, it looks like there’s an Avengers level issue happening across the seas. So, Steve and I are gonna have to leave you for a few days. Bucky, Bruce and Natasha are staying here, so that will foil any plans you have to throw a wild party.” Tony winks at him, humour bright in his eyes.
“Harry!” Squeal two girls who run full speed towards the boy and practically tackle him to the ground. The three teens fall into rapid conversation that Peter can barely keep up with, so he hangs by awkwardly trying not to look out of place.
Steve chuckles. “Don’t worry, I was exactly the same when Tony brought me here for the first time. Took me a while to get used to it, but then again I had been frozen for 70 years, so I’m sure you’ll adapt a lot quicker than I did.” The blond lays a comforting hand on Peter’s shoulder just as the elevator comes to a stop.
“Yeah yeah. Go back to talking to building your ice castle, or whatever it is you do all day.” Bucky chuckles as he saunters out of the room clearly pleased at getting a reaction out of Tony, although he does throw a ‘thanks’ over his shoulder before the door closes.
“Okay so there’s a fully stocked bar with servers, who I paid heavily to serve to minors so take advantage, and Peter you remember where the bathrooms are, right?” He nods “Great, I’ll catch up with you guys in a bit, hosting duties call!” And just like that Harry has disappeared into the crowd and from sight.
This chapter should hopefully make up for the last one, I'm much happier with this one over all and its the length I usually aim for.
“Um, I’ll need to get back to you on that one. I’ll text you the address.” They end the call after a few goodbyes and Peter flops onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
Peter decides to stay in the guest room on Steve and Tony’s floor tonight, with Tony promising that first thing tomorrow they’ll start shopping for furniture and things that he can use to decorate the floor and make it his own.
Apparently, Nick Fury had personally asked for Peter to be present. Tony and Steve were completely opposed, wishing to keep their son as far away from Avengers-related business as possible, but what Director Fury wants Director Fury gets.
Once safely in the bathroom he locks the door, the click of the lock bringing him into serene silence. He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and takes a deep breath, only just realising how quick his breathing has gotten. It’s been a few days since Peter has felt the full weight of everything that has happened to him. Living here in the tower has helped a lot, feeling like he finally has a support system again, has managed to alleviate some of the pressure that had previously been suffocating him. He hasn’t felt the familiar urge to escape as Spider-Man since he was back in the foster home but here in the bathroom, with his emotions dialled up to one-hundred, Peter concludes that the only thing which will truly help him calm down is escaping into what is familiar.
“Thanks JARVIS.” If a few days ago someone had told Peter that he would be living in the Avengers tower and talking to an A.I. in the ceiling as if it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary he would never have believed them.
“I mean, not really.” Peter shrugs. “I asked her if she wanted to do extra Decathlon practice on Wednesday after school.” They’re waiting on the platform now, neither boy meeting the other’s eye. Something heavy is hanging in the air between them and it’s clear they can both feel it.
Harry and Ned visit the tower at the weekend, and Bucky and Sam notice something between Peter and Harry that neither boy has even realised yet.
“Peter, this idiot with no manners is Clint.” Tony supplies as Clint shakes Peter’s hand with a smile, apologising again for almost hitting him in the face.
It’s on his fourth week in the foster home that Peter returns to school. At first, he’s desperate to get back to normality, back to classes, decathlon, getting to see Ned again, and when he arrives at school he’s actually kind of happy and excited for the first time in a month. This changes rapidly however when he walks into the main hall and all eyes turn to face him. Then the whispers start. No one approaches him, but Peter knows that they’re all talking about him. Some people shoot him sympathetic glances, or sad smiles, but most just talk about him as if he isn’t even there.
After breakfast the trio head out into the city. Peter meets Happy Hogan, a man he has seen in the press numerous times and who is just as grumpy in person as he appears to be in pictures. Tony and Steve have put on disguises, poor ones Peter muses to himself, but they want to do everything they can to make Peter feel comfortable so he appreciates their efforts to not get stopped by crowds everywhere they go.
“Everything okay Peter?” Steve breaks off from his conversation with Sam looking concerned. The boy tries to soften his features to no avail, painfully aware of the scowl that is currently etched there.
As he lies in his bed that night, his new bed in his new home where he feels safe and welcome, Peter thinks that maybe he is finally starting to catch a break in life.
The fact that Iron Man and Captain America are married doesn’t throw Peter as much as it probably should. There have always been rumours about the pair but he had never really paid them any attention; Peter’s logic had always been that at the end of the day it didn’t actually matter if the two were romantically involved or not.
“Yeah yeah. ‘The kid’s a genius’, ‘she’s smarter than you’. I’ve heard it all before Elsa. Do you want your arm back or not.” Tony can clearly sense Peter’s confusion. “I made the first round of developments on the arm, but after the Ice Princess here went away to Wakanda to learn how to control his ice powers or something, the King’s sister got her little hands on it.”
Harry nods. “I was actually there, and prepare for insane jealousy Ned, I got to meet your favourite spandex wearing Super-Hero.”
When Peter gets back to the tower he decides to go straight down to Tony’s workshop instead of going to his own floor.
Mr. Stark walks around to Peter’s side of the table, perching on the surface beside Peter. He removes his glasses and places a hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Peter, we’re here because when we heard about what happened Steve and I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Stark Industries is heavily involved in the clean-up of every Avengers-related tragedy, that’s how we learned about what had happened to you. So, we looked you up, spoke to your social worker and we think that you could be the perfect addition to our family.” Mr. Stark says all of this while looking Peter dead in the eye, not breaking eye contact once. When he’s finished speaking Peter feels a bit teary, he can feel that Mr. Stark is genuine in what he says, that he really means it, really wants to adopt Peter and make him a part of his family.
Peter crawls up the building beside him to get a better vantage point and notices three armed gunmen exiting a bank. After a brief chase Peter manages to get the three men webbed up pretty easily, and he returns the stolen money to the bank, before going back to the alley where he left his stuff to change and head home.
Ned’s eyebrows draw together as he pulls a face. “Oh please Peter, I’m sure your new life update isn’t that incredible.”
“Sup Penis? You went MIA again. Did you finally realise how pathetic you are and decide to spare us all from having to look at your miserable face for a few days?” He keeps walking despite Flash’s attempts to bring him to a stop by walking directly in his path. “Come on Dickwad what’s the matter? Ignoring your superior is pretty rude.” Flash continues to throw insults at Peter as the boy makes a beeline for his Physics class, which his aggressor thankfully does not share with him.
Peter can see Harry’s blonde hair before he’s even left the lobby of the Tower. The sight of his friend makes Peter’s heart beat faster and suddenly he feels nervous. Before he can truly give in to the odd feelings and over think them too much he’s stepping out onto the streets of New York and calling Harry’s name.
The brunette pushes himself up into a sitting position and is thankful to find a fresh glass of water and two pain killers waiting for him. The pain killers won’t be of any great help, thanks to the enhanced metabolism, but they might take the edge off slightly. Peter’s not the biggest fan of his mutated abilities right now, they’ve screwed him a bit too much lately for his liking.
Despite himself Peter allows his eyes to slip shut mirroring Harry. The blonde boy presses forward slightly increasing the pressure so there’s no denying the fact that they’re kissing.
Natasha has witnessed enough that she could very easily guess that he’s Spider-Man. He really shouldn’t have let her get to him earlier in the gym. He figured out quickly what she was trying to do and instead of giving up he had experienced an intense need to prove himself. Sitting here now under her withering gaze he doesn’t feel quite as confident as he had earlier.
“And so what if it is? What does it matter to you? What does it matter to anyone?” Peter raises his voice slightly catching the attention of a few other passengers in the carriage they’ve just climbed into.
Tony clears his throat. “I don’t have a good relationship with alcohol Peter. That much is well documented in the press, and my issues started when I was your age.” Steve rests a supportive hand on his husband's shoulder. “I’m not saying you’ll end up like me but I’m sure as hell going to do everything I can to make sure you don’t.”
“All I will say is I have a second date on Saturday and I will not be answering anymore questions until I’ve eaten.” His parents back off seeming satisfied enough with this response for now.
She also knows pop culture references almost as well as Peter does, and his pop culture knowledge is something he takes a great deal of pride in so he considers the fact MJ could rival him very impressive indeed.
He feels the loss of May every single day and tonight the pain hurts just a bit more because he knows she should be here. Knows how much she would’ve loved putting him in a suit, showing him how to tie his tie correctly, taking hundreds of pictures and teasing him about his date.
The suit has a few holes in it from where bombs had caught him, and it's not until Peter is lifting his arm to put his t-shirt on that he feels the searing pain in his shoulder. Carefully he examines the area only to find a sizeable burn on his right shoulder.
Tony continues to fuss over Peter, ensuring his son isn’t seriously hurt. As the pair leave the gym the teenager looks over his shoulder to shoot Natasha a meaningful look that clearly says he isn’t going to forget this quickly.
Peter waves him off. “Don’t worry about it, I’m not really one for parties anyway. I don’t mind.” Tony gestures to the boy and fixes Steve with a look that says ‘
“Hello family of mine, how are we this evening?” Tony asks while taking a seat across from them. Steve explains what they’re working on briefly to his husband, he gives the credit for all of the hard work to Peter which is nice of him to do given how colossally useless the boy actually is at world history. “Well I decided to pop up to ask you about your weekend plans Pete.”
“I might…” There’s a long pause. “If the right person asked me I probably would.” MJ is looking at him intently now.
The God of Thunder seems to have recovered from his momentary shock as he picks the hammer up with ease and swings it around as if it weighs no more than a piece of paper. “Exactly right. None of you would be fit to rule Asgard.”
Natasha Romanov is many things, observant is probably at the top of that list. One thing that certainly is not appearing on that list is the ability to figure out Peter Parker.
When he gets to school Peter spots Ned waiting at his locker for him, and surprisingly enough Harry is with him. It was nice having someone else to talk to and sit with in the classes he doesn’t share with Ned but Peter figured Harry would have found more interesting and cooler people to spend time with.
Peter spots the cause of the explosions easily from his vantage point. The flying Green-guy is back, and he seems intent on causing as much damage as possible.
“I was going to say sensitive.” Tony snorts causing Steve to narrow his eyes at him again. “You said back at the foster home that you knew who we were and what we do. How much do you know exactly?”
They agree to meet just after lunch on Saturday at a coffee shop not too far from the Tower. Takeaway cups firmly in hand they begin walking with no real destination in mind until MJ asks if Peter would mind visiting a book shop with her. Of course, he agrees, and the curly haired girl leads him to a small shop crammed from floor to ceiling with every book imaginable.
Norman narrows his eyebrows disapprovingly. “Are you going to continue to be rude or are you going to introduce me to your guest?”
Of course, Peter knew who the man was the second he set eyes on him. War Machine is every bit as intimidating in person as he seems on the TV. The man approaches Peter now with a hand extended. “Nice to meet you Peter, I’m Tony’s long-suffering best friend, Rhodey.”
He leaves a few minutes later after Natasha expresses that while she won’t tell anyone she also won’t cover for him. He can work with that, but Nat is right he really does need to get better at lying.
Steve nods and Tony turns his attention back to the prototype he’s working on. “Sure son. Will you be back for dinner?” He decides to just grab something while he’s out and tells Steve he’ll probably be back around seven. “Okay, just make sure you’re back in enough time to get ready for school tomorrow.”
It takes a few weeks, but eventually things at school start to feel like they’re back on track again. People still stare and whisper, and more often than not Peter struggles to stay awake in class thanks to the constant nightmares, but there’s finally a small piece of his life that feels familiar again.
When Peter has finally had enough he swings around a pillar allowing his feet to collide with the green-guy’s chest, knocking him off course and sending him spiralling through the air.
“Why wouldn’t we be sure?” A second mystery male voice asks, this one sharper in tone than the other man.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t really, filthy habit. Mr Workman’s English notes are driving me to it though.”
This is another thing Peter really appreciates about his new friend. He doesn’t ask questions. From things that have been said he’s been able to piece together that there are things Harry doesn’t want to talk about, so Peter never presses and Harry grants him the same.
They get all the way back to the Tower and have just entered the elevator when Harry finally speaks. “Thanks.” Peter reaches across the space between them silently to squeeze Harry’s hand in a gesture he hopes is comforting.
Eventually Tony and Steve let up on the mini-lecture, both heading off to bed so that, in the words of Steve, “we can be ready for your big day back at school tomorrow!” Steve asks him not to stay up too late and leaves with his husband.
The night of the dance Peter is subjected to more humiliation by his extended family who insist on taking thousands of pictures of him in the suit. He pretends to be annoyed but the look of joy on his adoptive parent’s faces make it a bit difficult to really feel any emotions other than love and happiness.
When Peter stands up on Monday morning he finds that there is virtually no pain in his leg, a pleasant surprise to say the least. He decides to keep it wrapped in Natasha’s expertly applied bandages just to be safe.
There’s a hearty laugh and a tall blonde man stomps toward them. “It appears your offspring shares your same passion for food Rogers.” Peter looks up at the man with wide eyes. Standing in front of him smiling with all his impressive Asgardian might is Thor the God of Thunder. “Glad to meet you young Peter, your fathers have told me many great things.”
The next time Green-guy zooms towards him Peter doesn’t jump out of the way, instead he waits until his foe is in the perfect position before jumping up and pulling one of the turbines off of the board.
This is definitely an improvement on the foster home Peter thinks to himself. That feeling of hope settles itself nicely into his chest, replacing a small amount of the guilt and panic that usually resides there. It’s not much, but it’s a start.
“Very good sir, I have informed your parents.” Peter nods distractedly barely making it to his couch before passing out and falling into a deep sleep.
Peter waves him off. “That’s alright Harry I can call Happy. Don’t worry.” He continues making excuses as he collects his backpack and Harry is still insisting he does more to help as Peter finally gets in the elevator, the doors sliding closed on Harry’s worried features.
Every time Peter looks at the suit, or goes to put it on, that guilt is there pressing and present at the front of his mind, demanding his attention, reminding him that he isn’t good enough. He couldn’t save Uncle Ben and he couldn’t save Aunt May.
He shrugs. “She didn’t really say anything, just that she was only going to go if someone asked her.” There’s a smattering of laughter around the table and Peter looks up to see everyone trying to contain themselves. “What?”
“Okay Peter, we have a proposition for you. I don’t think you’ll say no but please know that you can if you want to.” Tony’s intro doesn’t give anything away and Peter’s curiosity only grows more with each passing second. He simply nods in the hopes that his parents will get a move on and just tell him already.
The next day Peter wanders down to Tony’s workshop around midday, he’s been working on a new upgrade for Falcon and Peter’s been enjoying watching the genius work. He usually just perches on a stool near Tony and occasionally hands him screwdrivers or any other tool he requires.
Peter’s response appears to please the Bakers as they share a look with one another. “A young man with manners, always nice to see.” Mr. Baker praises. Peter nods, unsure of what he’s supposed to do in this situation, and nervous about what the pair wanted to discuss with him. “As you might have noticed Peter, my wife and I run a tight ship around here. We aren’t what you might have expected from a foster home.” Peter nods again in agreement, interested to see where this conversation is going.
So, following at least three pictures with every Avenger and ten minutes late Peter finally makes it to the bus that’s waiting to take the entire Decathlon team to Connecticut.
“Woah! Good reflexes kid.” Clint walks towards them with an impressed look on his face. Upon closer inspection Peter discovers that the offending object is a cereal bar. He notices that Steve and Natasha are watching him closely, obviously both wondering how he caught the bar so easily when it would have hit any normal person. Peter makes a mental note to try and ignore the Spidey-sense as much as possible when he’s around the Avengers, if anything is going to give him away it will most likely be that. “Sorry about that, I was aiming for Rapunzel.” Bucky glares at Clint but there’s no heat behind the look.
Peter’s head is spinning with thoughts as he makes his way to bed. He’s just about to turn off his light and crawl under the covers when his phone buzzes on the bedside table.
To Peter’s utter shock and surprise Nat is actually really funny. Before long the three are laughing together as stories are told about Hawkeye and Black Widow’s best escapades.
Since Peter stormed out of the Tower yesterday at around lunchtime Bucky had texted and called him an impressive seventy-two times in total. The last two had only come through in the last half hour.
There’s a look of confusion painted clear across Peter’s face now but Natasha doesn’t give him any time to over think the situation. With an expertly executed swipe of her foot Natasha knocks Peter’s feet out from under him, a move that should send the boy crashing to the floor. Instead Peter lands on delicately placed fingertips and flips himself over with practiced ease.
Natasha and Clint don’t hang around for much longer, both having to leave for a meeting that sounds extremely confidential and important. Natasha says that she will be back in time for dinner, but Clint lets everyone know that he’s going back to the farm. Before he leaves Clint claps Peter on the shoulder and says it was nice to meet him. Peter decides that out of the pair Clint seems to be the most approachable, and on the other hand he thinks it might take some time before he feels even somewhat comfortable around Natasha.
She is full-on smirking now. “Spiderling. Like a baby spider.” Peter’s ready to retort but is cut off by the image of Nick Fury appearing on the monitor at the front of the room.
The story moves on drawing comparisons between this attack and several others over the past few months, speculating about the new villain’s involvement in the others. And that’s when it happens.
“We should probably start building this Millennium Falcon, right Ned? It’ll take us all day at this rate.”
He drinks two more of whatever the bartender is pouring into the cup before a girl from his English class appears at his side to slide a tiny glass of clear liquid and a wedge of lime into his hand. There are people all around him now chanting about shots but Peter tunes them out and concentrates solely on the burn of the clear liquid as it slides down his throat.
He’s in the process of tweaking his web formula when a wad of paper hits him on the back of the head. It lands quite perfectly beside his pencil and falls open enough that Peter can tell something has been written inside.
Peter blushes, dropping Dr. Banner’s hand from the handshake which definitely lasted too long. “Well yeah… I just, um, read them for fun?” Bruce is still staring at him disbelievingly.
His Aunt May is gone. The woman that has raised him for over ten years. His only family. The last person he had. Gone.
“Okay, how do I fix it then?” There’s resounding silence from everyone who was more than happy to tease him a few minutes ago. “Oh, so you have nothing to say now? Convenient.”
Steve rolls his eyes, clearly this is not what he had wanted Tony to say. “Peter, we want you to be comfortable here. I know how hard it can be to settle into a new environment, trust me on that one. It helps sometimes to have a space that is just yours. So that’s what we wanted to give you.”
Feeling a deep sense of regret at over how he treated Bucky yesterday and guilt over seeing just how many times the super soldier had tried to get in touch Peter responds:
Carefully Natasha rises, rounding the kitchen counter to stand closer to the boy. “Just… observing.” She looks him up and down, Peter doesn’t know why but he feels as though she knows all of his secrets without him ever having said a word. “Might want to get that limp looked at.” The boy blanks, his eyes going wide. “I won’t say anything.” With that the female assassin glides off to the elevator, heading away with not another word spoken.
Harry on the other hand greets everyone with a charming smile and takes all questions thrown at him as he does everything, with ease. Peter wishes he had half the amount of confidence and composure Harry has on a bad day.
“No, it’s not you don’t worry.” He says through gritted teeth. “Could you help me?” Peter gestures to the bed sheets and Ned quickly gets the hint, rushing over and gently pulling back the covers to reveal Peter’s lower half.
It’s safe to say that Harry and Ned are as excited about their new Lego project as Peter is. The only complicated factor for Peter now is revealing to Harry both where he lives and who his parents are.
Lunch is finished, everyone dispersing, Tony asks if Peter wants to join him in the workshop again but Peter declines, excusing himself to his room.
“Best way to win a dame over is with dancing, believe me. It was my signature move back in the day, isn’t that right Stevie?” The super soldier winks at Peter, grin still firmly in place.
As she observes him now from the doorway of the gym she notices something else. Peter is currently sparring with Steve who recently decided to teach Peter some self-defence after the boy came home from school with a nasty bruise on his cheek bone. He claimed it was nothing more than a silly school fight but once again Natasha didn’t believe that to be the full truth.
Peter can feel eyes on him and he briefly meets the gaze of Natasha Romanoff who is staring him down from where she is sitting in the kitchen. He flicks his eyes away from the steely gaze as quickly as he had met it, from that brief moment alone he can tell that Natasha doesn’t believe a word he has just said.
Peter doesn’t go home. He walks for half an hour until he finds a nice alleyway where he changes into the suit, always stored in his backpack, and scales the nearest building to sit on the roof.
“How about we agree that this whole Spider-Man thing remains a secret between us, unless I come home really seriously injured. Because if I’m not hurt and you don’t tell Tony and Steve then you aren’t breaking any rules, right?” To Peter’s utter delight and surprise JARVIS agrees. Apparently, Tony hasn’t made JARVIS’ protocols so strict that there are no loopholes. After asking JARVIS to tell his parents that he’s gone out for a walk and not to worry, Peter shoots off a web and begins swinging through the city.
The adrenaline rush he has felt all afternoon and evening is almost addicting and Peter didn’t want to lose it again. He decided that the next night he’ll sneak out of his room and go on patrol, to test how it feels after so long. He’s already breaking rule three, why should he quit while he’s ahead?
It’s just about to turn eleven o’clock when Peter rounds the corner and enters the ice cream shop. He immediately spots his best friend, sitting near the window with two ice creams in front of him; salted caramel, Ned’s favourite and Peter’s favourite, mint chocolate chip.
Peter doesn’t need to be asked twice to try out his childhood fantasy of holding Mjolnir so he makes his way over to the hammer. Of course, he isn’t expecting anything to happen so he makes a bit of a joke and a show out of rolling up his sleeves and placing both hands carefully on the handle. Then he pulls up with his full strength, not seeing the need to hold back as obviously nothing is going to happen, and the hammer moves.
Peter hesitates, he feels awkward talking about this, he hasn’t even come to terms with everything himself let alone having to put it into words. “I’m…” Harry waits patiently for him to figure out what to say, Peter’s heart flutters with the care being shown to him. After taking a deep breath he begins to speak. “I’m just trying to figure out how I fit into this. I’ve been denying how I feel about you for weeks now,” Peter tries to ignore the look of pride that flits over Harry’s features at his words, but honestly he felt the same when hearing Harry has liked him for so long. “And now that we’re here I don’t know what this means for me.”
Despite his tendency to keep to himself and remain as invisible as possible, Peter feels inexplicably drawn towards Harry. He agrees to show the new boy around and the pair chat away until class begins.
Steve rolls his eyes at Bucky’s words. “Buck, don’t call women dames.” He rises and walks closer to his son. “He’s somewhat right though Peter, come here.” Steve takes up a stance, legs shoulder width apart and arms raised. When Peter doesn’t move he gestures to his son. “Come on.”
Michelle (Decathlon): It’s Michelle. Who else would care enough to text you about something as boring as decathlon?
Harry smiles in that way Peter likes just a bit too much. “So, I was thinking, especially after how much of a train wreck tonight was, of throwing a party after the dance next week. Thoughts?” They’ve started walking away from the warehouse now.
“Haha, yeah, Steve’s watched so many it’s almost as if he was there the way he talks about it sometimes…” Peter trails off laughing to himself. “Have you got a lot of work? I know they’ve been laying it on thick to get you caught up.”
He pushes through the crowd of sweaty bodies dancing in the centre of the room and manages to make it out into the long hallway Harry had led him down the time Peter came here to study. The time they listened to music. That time Harry kissed him…
As much as he isn’t over the moon with Ned giving out his number Peter can’t really blame Ned, Michelle is quite intimidating. He saves the girl’s number in his phone figuring it can’t hurt to keep it.
Peter can feel his thoughts descending into peak overthinking mode but it is quickly overridden as his Spidey-sense goes into overdrive. There’s a massive explosion as the roof of the warehouse is torn off exposing the crowded room to the dark New York sky.
The boy shakes himself out of his shock, catching the clock he realises it’s almost half past nine. He can hear Steve’s voice in his head, reminding him to get a good night of sleep so that he can be ready for school tomorrow. Despite how much he does not want to go to school Peter doesn’t want to stay in this kitchen any longer.
“Oh good, you’re awake. Mrs. Warren will be here at ten, but Mr. Baker and I were wondering if we could speak to you before the other kids wake up.” Peter nods and rises from the bed to follow Mrs. Baker downstairs.
“It was good, thank you for asking. Hey, um, JARVIS could you tell Tony and Steve that I’m on my way up?”
Tony leads them back over to the couch where Peter curls up in between both of his parents, head resting on Steve’s shoulder and feet placed on Tony’s lap, to watch Harry fight off Voldemort in a graveyard.
Decathlon practice always passes quickly and soon they’re putting tables back and tidying away the chairs.
“I’ll be fine Pete, honestly. He’s clearly drunk and in half an hour he’ll be passed out on the couch.” Peter isn’t convinced and wants to protest further, but Harry’s pushing him towards the door again. “I’m serious. I’ll be fine but you need to go. I’ll call you tomorrow, okay?” Before the elevator doors shut Peter pulls the boy toward him, pressing their lips together one last time so that he can savour the smile on Harry’s face as the doors slide shut.
“Pete why don’t you give it a go?” Tony suggests and everyone else is quick to jump in with agreement.
Everything is just a bit too much for Peter and he starts sobbing openly. Tony rubs his back comfortingly and Steve runs a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry… I just- I’ve felt so alone and it’s been so long since I’ve felt like anyone cared.” He mumbles into Tony’s chest, effectively sandwiched in between the two super-heroes.
“My math is never wrong.” Tony winks at Peter then invites Ned to stay for dinner, an invitation which he accepts with glee.
With a sigh Peter realises that Ned is right, he hasn’t been very fair to his best friend recently, especially considering that he has been pretty much the only person who has been there for him. “You’re right. I’m sorry, I really am. There’s just been a really major change in my life, again, and I needed time to process it before I told you.” Ned inclines his head awaiting the rest of Peter’s explanation. “If I’m completely honest I still haven’t fully processed it. But you’re right, I owe you an explanation. There’s a lot for me to explain here, and I need you to promise me that you won’t freak-out.”
If the confused looks on Ned’s face were wide and comical before, they are nothing compared to the way his eyes bug out of his head when Peter casually strolls into the Avengers tower.
This seems to appease Mr Osborn somewhat. He encourages Peter to help himself to the medical journals lining the walls, and despite it being exactly what he’s looking for Peter puts up a protest. “I assume you attend the same school as my son Mr Parker, and unlike him, I’m assuming you have the same knack for science that Richard did. So please be my guest. Richard was not only a colleague but a friend. He would want you to have them.” He agrees after that desperately trying not to smile in triumph. “I’ll leave you now. Harry don’t con my staff out of access to areas you don’t have clearance for ever again.” He turns on his heel and strides from the room in the same fashion he entered.
“Phone social work and tell them you don’t want me staying here anymore if you want. I don’t care anymore. Do what the fuck you like.” Peter pushes away from the table and storms upstairs, Mr. and Mrs. Baker shouting after him about his poor manners and lack of respect.
Although they haven’t exchanged any words Peter knows Nat is keeping a close eye on him. After last night he doesn’t really blame her, he did a really poor job at covering up his limp and did an even worse job playing the situation off when the assassin pointed it out.
“No, don’t go.” He pulls Harry back onto the couch. “I’ll reply later. It can wait.” Harry looks like he wants to protest so Peter pulls him into a quick kiss. “Please stay.”
Their gaze locks again and this time there’s only hope in Harry’s expression. “Don’t do this if you aren’t sure.” It’s Peter’s turn to look confused now. “I can’t handle it again, if you pretend nothing happened, like… like the last time. After that day when we studied… That day when I kissed you.” There it is. The first time the kiss has been acknowledge out loud between the two of them. “I can’t go through that again Peter.”
Thankfully MJ had gotten bored and wandered off leaving just Ned and Peter to read the board in absolute shock. They turn to face each other slowly with twin looks of astonishment.
Thankfully Harry’s friends from the concert, Liz and Gwen, appear at Peter’s side and pull the trio into the fold of the party. A cup containing something that is definitely not soda is pushed into his hand by Liz, but unlike his two friends Peter decides not to drink. He’s fairly certain his increased metabolism means he can’t get drunk but right now doesn’t feel like the best time to test that theory.
Thankfully it’s dark when he reaches his destination and he manages to scale the building rather successfully considering he’s basically a leg down. He finds the window he needs and yanks the glass open pulling himself over the ledge and landing rather unceremoniously in a heap under the window.
“They’re back from the mission?” Peter questions, playing dumb to the fact that he already knows the rest of the team are home. One the way to the communal floor Tony makes small talk, mainly about Peter’s return to school in two days’ time. Tony, Steve and Peter had met with the principal yesterday to discuss Peter’s return and the fact that all information referring to both where he lives and his guardians has to remain confidential. Peter doesn’t want anything to be public knowledge, and he doesn’t for a second believe that if it were public knowledge that Flash would stop bullying him just because of who his parents are. Instead, if any questions are asked the cover story is that Peter is an intern for Stark Industries who has been working closely with Tony Stark.
Seeing this Peter takes pity and forgets his own misery for a second. “No, I’m fine Harry honestly, I think I should just go home.”
“Alright I’ll come if you stop doing that.” This only causes the shimmying to intensify until Harry’s putting his hands onto Peter’s shoulders and forcing him to join in.
Mr. Baker is sitting at a large dining table waiting for them. He faces Peter with what the boy can only assume is an attempt at a smile, but the man’s face never seems anything other than harsh and severe.
The boy jumps up from his seat practically ripping the box out of Tony's hands. “Are you serious? This is insane! Tony! Oh my God!” Steve laughs at his son’s excitement smiling fondly over at his husband. “This is so expensive, I can’t believe you bought me this!”
When Tony also can’t get the hammer to move it opens him up to a fair amount of goading and teasing from the other team members. Everyone takes a turn one at a time with no greater success than the person before them. Eventually they only team members that haven’t tried are Steve, Bucky and Natasha.
“It’s been good so far, yeah.” Peter responds, still slightly in shock at how kind Bucky is. Not that he had been expecting a monster or someone evil or anything like that. Steve had spoken to him at length about Bucky and what to expect, he’d explained that Wakanda had helped and that Bucky was basically back to his normal self again. However, there had still be a part of Peter that had expected to meet the cold and calculated assassin that was reported on the TV.
“So, the date went well?” Tony asks that night as he puts dinner down on the table in front of his son.
“Get them for you?” Tony supplies helpfully. “The short answer is yes. I absolutely could. The long answer is that I shouldn’t.” Peter’s eyes fly up to meet his adoptive dad’s apologetic ones. “I had a pretty nasty falling out with old Norman a few years back for doing exactly that, I won’t get into the details, but I’d rather not drag all that through the press again. Sorry kid.”
“There he is! Our resident merrymaker Peter Benjamin Parker, party animal extraordinaire.” Tony is speaking very loudly and given the smirk on his face Peter has no doubt that he’s doing it on purpose. He glares intensely at the man as he slides onto the stool beside him at the breakfast bar. “Whoa! That wasn’t there last night.” Tony’s face shifts from amusement to concern and Peter really hopes he doesn’t have to see the alarm on Tony’s face again anytime soon. He really needs to not do anything for at the next forty-eight hours that could cause worry or any level of anxiety to either of his parents.
“So,” Peter continues as they head down a busy New York street. “Are you headed home to start the dreaded homework now?”
They pass their morning of classes as they always do, with Peter helping Harry as best he can when the teachers have their backs turned. Eventually lunchtime rolls around and Peter is delighted to realise he hasn’t even thought about Saturday’s events, any of Satuday’s events, until he sees Ned waving them over to a table.
He can faintly hear JARVIS saying something but its drowned out by the sound of sirens. Sirens that aren’t actually there but that are deafening nonetheless.
Eventually the pair make their way to the park where they sit on a bench and MJ tells Peter stories that cause him to practically double over in laughter. Being so observant and yet so quiet clearly has its perks as MJ seems to know just about every secret and sordid affair that goes on in their school.
Peter is unsure of what to do with himself, the emotions he feels are overwhelming. Every time he opens his mouth to speak he doesn’t trust himself not to cry while doing it. Before he knows it, he’s being hugged tightly by Captain America. “We are truly so happy to have you here Peter.” He relaxes into the embrace and when they pull back Peter is fairly certain he can see unshed tears shining in Steve’s eyes. Tony walks over, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist and pressing a kiss to his forehead. He lifts his other arm and tilts his head to the side which Peter takes as his signal to join the hug.
Eventually they seem to remember that Peter is standing with them and Harry introduces them all. The first girl with impossibly long, pin straight blonde hair is Gwen. The other girl with darker skin and warm brown eyes introduces herself as Liz. Turns out that the trio went to middle school together before Harry started getting shipped off to various boarding schools around the world, but they all kept in touch.
Bucky is intimidating to say the least, he doesn’t look as harsh or angry as Peter remembers him looking on the news a few years ago, but there’s still a presence about him regardless. So, you can imagine Peter’s shock when the soldier reaches out to shake his hand with a smile that can only be described as welcoming, or even charming.
In his alcohol daze Peter is vaguely aware of Tony settling into the armchair in the corner of his room, but he could also swear down the room is spinning so he’s not sure how much he should really be trusting his own judgement.
Peter laughs a bit at the face Tony pulls when Rhodey says ‘long-suffering’. “Nice to meet you too, sorry you had to hear my terrible singing. Not a great first introduction I guess.”
Peter spends some time with two other residents of the tower, however one of his encounters isn't exactly ideal for someone trying to hide a secret.
A split second before it happens Peter’s spider sense clues him into the impending attack. He flips onto the roof behind him just as a small device collides with the fire escape sending the structure crashing to the ground.
The pair watch him go with fond expressions. “We got lucky didn’t we?” Tony says to his husband, reaching over to hold his hand.
By the time he’s left the Tower and walked about three blocks Peter has calmed down quite a bit. Perhaps shouting and storming out was a bit of an overreaction but Peter chalks it up to teenage mood swings. When his head finally clears he realises he didn’t actually have a plan or destination in mind. He just grabbed his backpack and left.
Peter sees Harry waiting for him near the gate as he always does on a Monday. While Peter is at Decathlon the other boy gets tutored for Physics, which he hates but the tutoring is part of the agreement that allows him to attend Midtown.
There’s a beeping noise from the kitchen which signals that that the dryer is done. Ned proclaims that it’s Peter’s Spider-Man suit and goes to retrieve it.
“Whoa, ultra-polite. Good to meet you kid.” Tony’s face gives away easily that he’s thinking about something. “Why is you face familiar?”
The panic he felt thinking that Steve and Tony might have known that he is Spider-Man has essentially disappeared. Nothing has been said, aside from Peter’s one slip up a few days ago, that suggests either of the pair suspect anything and he is content to keep it that way. The thought that telling Tony and Steve could actually help him had crossed Peter’s mind a few times, but in the end, he had always reached the conclusion that the pair would probably try and get him to stop being Spider-Man, which could absolutely not happen.
“I was wanting to ask you something…” MJ doesn’t say anything she just watches Peter expectantly, both eyebrows raised in anticipation. “Would you maybe wanna go to the dance with me? You know, if someone else hasn’t asked you yet.”
“We really wanted to take you on a proper vacation this year, but unfortunately some things have come up that we have to go and handle. Nothing bad or dangerous, but important nonetheless.” Steve takes over from Tony. “The place we’re going isn’t your typical holiday destination, but we figured you might like to come regardless of that.”
Once back at the tower they settle at Peter’s dining table quickly covering the surface in textbooks and notes from various classes.
“Better not be.” He says accepting the kiss with a smile. “Ignore him Peter. I’m sure she’s a lovely girl and I’m looking forward to meeting her.”
“We can’t always save everyone, but sometimes the universe gives you an opportunity to put something right.” Steve has appeared on Peter’s other side, taking a similar stance to his husband. “Peter it would mean the world to us if you considered letting us adopt you and becoming a part of our family.”
Harry is being uncharacteristically quiet. He doesn’t even say goodbye when they get off the train, just lights a cigarette and walks off.
“I shouldn’t have said all of that. If you’re happy with MJ that’s all that matters.” His pleading eyes lock with Peter’s, and as always with Harry Peter finds himself entirely entranced.
“People of New York!” The rushing comes to an abrupt halt as one of the figures speaks and everyone turns towards the sound. “We have one request, bring us the Spider-Man.” Peter doesn’t recognise this first voice, but the second is all too familiar.
Harry and Peter are pushed around in the crowd as people run screaming towards the door. Their joined hands drop but Peter is frozen in spot staring up at the open space where the ceiling used to be, he’s aware of Harry pushing him, trying to get him to join the fray of panicked people but Peter is transfixed by the sight of two men floating at the edges of the warehouse.
“Please, if you can, let us know where you end up. Just so we know that you’re okay.” Mrs. Palmer pulls Peter into a hug, rubbing comforting circles into his back before Peter turns his attention to the awaiting Policeman.
“Oh, hey Nat. Sorry I gave you guys all such a scare, I’m the worst at remembering to charge my phone.” Peter walks further into the room trying desperately not to wince as he forces himself to walk normally. “I’m totally beat so I’m just gonna go straight to bed I think.”
“Excellent timing Pete, come help Tony chop the tomatoes before he chops off one of his fingers. I can’t handle the whining if he damages his precious hands.”
He spots a few people he knows from class and asks them if they’ve seen his friend and someone says they think Harry went into the room at the end of the hall. Which makes Peter feel stupid, because of course, why didn’t he check Harry’s bedroom in the first place?
Peter decides to head to bed not much later, he bids Tony and Steve goodnight before heading to the guest room.
Peter is quite looking forward to having some peace and quiet in which to unpack the confusing thoughts swirling about his head, but of course in his home that’s too much to ask for.
Tony walks out of the elevator a few hours after the questions have almost all but ceased and the pair are watching Star Wars. Ned is invited to stay for dinner but he had promised his mom he would be home to eat with his family. Peter walks Ned out and promises to call him that night so that he can attempt to answer even more of Ned’s questions which he is sure the boy will come up with in their time apart.
Throughout the duration of this conversation Ned’s head is whipping all over the place, trying to make sense of what is happening. “Hang on, did you just say Tony and Steve?”
So, Natasha knows! I wasn't planning on any of the Avengers finding out so soon originally but it felt unnatural given Natasha's behaviour that she wouldn't push the boundaries and try to figure it out. I hope you liked they way I included her finding out.
Peter’s is frozen in complete shock, but Harry seems to have expected this as he opens his mouth to respond. “Sorry dad, can’t help it. I just love dick too much.”
Everything appears to be relatively quiet and then Peter hears an explosion followed by screaming, never a good sign.
With a grace and ease that Peter doesn’t think he will ever achieve Tony rises from the couch and makes his way over to the pair, hand outstretched for a hand shake.
“It has come to our attention that you have not been respecting the rules of our household.” Peter masks his face in a neutral expression, aiming to play dumb. “Peter, we know you’ve you been sneaking out of the house at night.” Mrs. Baker narrows her eyes at him, facing him with a scowl.
Peter helps prepare the dinner with Steve, although there isn’t much left to do, before long the dinner is ready and being served to just the trio. The two Avengers ask Peter about his day with Harry, he spends the whole conversation desperately hoping his face isn’t flaming bright red and giving away his inner monologue of:
Mr Osborn shakes Peter’s hand as he slowly draws the disapproving glare away from his son. “Richard and Mary’s boy?” Peter nods wilting slightly under Norman’s imposing gaze. “That certainly explains why you entered one of the secure areas. No doubt it was my son’s idea.” The sneer moves back to Harry’s direction now.
“I’m really sorry I upset you both. If it’s any comfort at all, I don’t wanna drink ever again. I feel awful.”
The next morning Peter is awakened by a loud and persistent buzzing noise. He cracks his eyes open and blindly reaches his hand out, searching for his phone. The light from the device almost blinds him at first but he squints through the discomfort to see Ned’s name flashing on the screen. “Hello?” He answers, his voice cracking slightly from sleep.
“Heard it all before kid, forget the excuses. Are you okay?” Peter reassures the pair that he’s fine, all that happened was that he and Ned had lost track of time and he forgot to check his phone until he was nearly home, which technically isn’t a lie.
The scene at Harry’s apartment doesn’t come remotely close to the words ‘small’ or ‘gathering’, it’s full on chaos.
“Okay…” Peter begins slowly. “Before I say anything I want you to know that I love living here and I love being your son and I don’t want anything to change and I really, really, don’t want to upset or offend you in anyway.” Tony just nods and motions for Peter to continue. “You can say no to this, of course, I’d never want you to abuse any influence that you have for my benefit and-”
“You know you can just go talk to MJ right?” Ned says breaking Peter’s attention away from the phone as it continues to ping with messages.
“Hey, welcome to your new home kid.” Peter turns around at the sound of Tony’s voice, looking up to see the Avengers Tower in all its glory.
Later that night when he’s lying in bed Peter realises that this is the best he has felt in a long time. The high of managing to stop the criminals hadn’t left him even when Mr. and Mrs. Baker confronted him after dinner for waking up two of the other kids with his screaming last night.
The entire table is looking at him now, Tony and Bruce in particular are giving him looks akin to someone trying to peer into another person’s mind.
Harry Potter has been the Captain’s most recent series to catch up on and he’s been quickly making his way through the books, watching the corresponding movie after he finishes each one. It’s been more than a little amusing for the other Tower inhabitants to see the Super Soldier’s reactions to some of the biggest moments from the series.
“Let’s go son.” The officer leads Peter towards a cop car, waiting with open doors. He ushers the quietly sobbing teen into the back seat before getting into the front and beginning the drive to the police station.
The sight of his two guardians greets the young boy. The pair are standing with their heads bowed close together clearly in deep discussion. Peter doesn’t want to intrude and is about to head back upstairs when Steve spots him and waves him into the workshop.
Tony wanted to drive him to MJ’s house but Peter had managed to wear him down to letting Happy drive them. Peter really wanted to get a taxi but that idea went down like a led balloon. So Happy driving was the best compromise.
Hello everyone! This is going to be the final part of this particular part of Peter Parker Needs a Break, but I have already started planning and writing the third part which will be called 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'. I'm hoping to have the first chapter of that out by next weekend!
Peter looks up to meet Ned’s concerned gaze. “That’s exactly why I can’t tell them. Tony and Steve would never let me be Spider-Man if they knew. I couldn’t put them through that stress.” Seeing the clear determination in his friend’s face Ned decides to drop the topic knowing that he won’t get anywhere.
“Peter’s the genius of our team actually. He’s probably the smartest kid in school.” Ned says nonchalantly in between forkfuls of his dinner. Peter glares at his best friend but it’s pointless as Ned doesn’t even notice.
Ned looks up sheepishly from the doorway. “Sorry…” All around his feet are the broken remains of a plate. “I thought I’d bring you some breakfast, clearly it was a terrible idea.” He crosses the room to the bed where Peter has laid back down, an arm covering his eyes to block out the light. “So, you’re Spider-Man?”
Harry lets out a laugh that causes Steve’s brow to furrow. “Sorry, it’s just that I’m pretty terrible at all science and math related topics. The idea of me competing alongside these two geniuses is hilarious.” Peter joins in on the laughter as the confusion around the table doubles.
Just as the band are taking the stage Liz and Gwen announce that they’re going to the bar for drinks so Peter and Harry make their way into the crowd without them.  The group are comprised of three men and a girl on drums, their name is a bit odd,
He shakes his head. “No, it’s okay Ned let’s go. I’ve been a bit of a party pooper over the last few hours, sorry.”
Both men crack smiles at that, the tension leaving the room. “Strangely, it does make me feel better.” Tony laughs as Steve smacks him on the head.
“Peter we’ve been over this, the Tower is your home you should feel comfortable to invite over whoever you want.” Peter can feel the slight exasperation in his adoptive fathers voice at constantly having to remind the boy of something both Steve and Tony feel is common sense. “Go on and tell them then. Your History work is done anyway.”
Tony’s eyes light up mischievously. “To practice… Uh huh, okay. Sure Pete, I used to do a lot of ‘practicing’ when I was your age as well.” Even Steve laughs light-heartedly at that one
In this exact moment Peter has a lot of sympathy for Ned when he first met the Avengers. He’s truly speechless.
He certainly hadn’t expected Natasha to be so blunt. “How would that even be possible? I’m just a kid.” Peter attempts to remain calm hoping he can throw Natasha off the scent. She doesn’t even dignify Peter’s poor attempt with a response, she just raises an eyebrow as if to say ‘really?’. With a shuddering sigh Peter asks, “Who else knows?”
He finds that being out as Spider-Man actually helps to numb the pain of losing Aunt May, it’s a good distraction to be able to help people. The nightmares continue but he also discovers that after being out on patrol he’s more likely to be able to sleep for longer than if he hasn’t been out. It’s as if his body is hard-wired with a need to be Spider-Man, and he actually functions better when he is fulfilling that need.
He takes off to start running back to the tower but as soon as his left foot collides with the sidewalk he cries out in agony. “Yup, that’s definitely sprained.” He muses aloud to himself. “How did I not notice that?”
He spots Harry from afar, blonde hair perfectly styled and leather jacket firmly in place despite the fact it’s the end of May and currently seventy-one degrees out.
“Promise me.” Harry takes his hands, the still burning cigarette lies forgotten on the floor. “Promise me you won’t run away this time.”
“Ned’s your best friend Peter, of course you can tell him. Invite him to come over if you want.” Steve suggests.
There’s an awkward pause in which Peter can tell there’s something on Harry’s mind. He’s just about to ask what’s up when the question is answered for him. “Are you still going to the dance with MJ?” Harry is pointedly not looking in Peter’s direction.
“So, Peter and Ned, what have you been up to for the past few hours?” Clint startles Peter slightly by addressing him so directly. He hasn’t had many interactions with Clint however the man has never been anything but nice and welcoming so maybe Peter shouldn’t be so shocked. He does have his own kids after all, it’s not like he’s unfamiliar with interacting with people under the age of eighteen.
Peter tries to talk to Harry but the boy seems to have all but shut down so he sets about collecting all of the journals that deal with anything remotely related to arachnids, gene editing or radioactive experimentations. He stuffs them into his backpack before ushering Harry out of the door.
century now in case you’ve forgotten. Ace’ll get the crap kicked out of him if he goes to school in a nice pair of slacks and a jacket and asks to meet the girl’s parents first.” There’s no malice behind Bucky’s words and Peter actually finds himself agreeing.
“Yeah, yeah.” Peter rolls his eyes. “So, first thing, I got adopted.” Ned’s eyes widen, he smiles and tells Peter how happy he is for him. “Thanks, I’m really glad to be away from those awful people.” His friend nods understandingly. “The second thing is the bit that I need you to not freak-out about.” Again, Ned doesn’t look convinced and Peter is fully prepared for the boy to do exactly what he has, now repeatedly, asked him not to do. “The people who adopted me are kind of famous, I guess you could say?” Peter finds himself at a loss for words, unsure of how to tell Ned. “Actually, it might make more sense if I just show you where I live now.”
“You want me to come with you on Avengers business?” Peter is only becoming more confused by the second.
“The game is over birds of paradise, drop the act.” Iron Man takes up his classic stance, hands raised towards the two villains.
“Oh.” Mrs. Baker finally responds after a few seconds of silence. Peter moves quietly to the top of the stairs so that he can hear better. “Are you sure?”
But MJ is pretty in a really understated way. Her hair is wild and unruly, it should really consume her but her bold personality shines through the mass of curls.
A look of confusion passes over Harry’s features. “Who’s Steve?” Peter remembers suddenly that he hasn’t divulged much of his background to Harry yet, it’s odd how comfortable he feels around him after only a few days.
“Peter, sweetheart. Your Aunt May… She…” Mrs. Palmer breaks off looking to the ambulance closest to them. Mr. Palmer manages to catch Peter before he hits the ground, holding him up as the tears break free. At this point Peter has lost enough people in his short life to guess what Mrs. Palmer was planning to tell him.
“Dude, do you have a crush on MJ?” Ned approaches Peter from behind, catching him completely off guard.
Towards the end of dinner, when the debate has gone unresolved, the topic changes to where the two boys have been all day.
The other boy looks like he wants to take Peter up on his offer to bail but quickly steals himself. “I’ll stay, you’re my best friend… and someone has to be here when you pass out again. What do you need me to do?”
“Um, 4.5? I think… That’s what it was the last I checked.” Mr. Stark looks as though he’s about to ask another question, but the Captain places a hand on his arm which Peter takes as him telling the other man to be quiet.
Peter’s mind races with all of the reasons he’s nervous, all of the reasons he can’t voice and the things he desperately wishes he could scream about but can’t, not for fear of having Spider-Man taken away from him.
“Hang on,” All eyes shoot over to Bruce. “if you’re so terrible at science then why do you go to a science focused High School?”
Dinner is just being served by Steve and Bucky to the group of Super Heroes who appear to be debating something loudly.
“No one. They aren’t half as observant as me.” She’s moved to sit beside him now. “I won’t say anything.” Peter’s eyes shoot up to her in shock. “It’s not my secret to tell. But you really need to get better at lying kid.”
Of course, there’s also Harry but Peter shoots down that idea as soon as it appears at the corners of his mind. Harry has a bad enough relationship with his dad and the family company without Peter asking him to access private company files.
Tony flops down onto the couch on the other side of Peter from Steve and nods. “Makes sense for Bruce to be here because we work on projects together a lot, and because they finally got their acts together and became an official item Nat’s here much more often than she used to be. Which basically means hell for me because I now have two trained assassins creeping about my tower.”
MJ has stopped to speak to a few of the other team members just shy of the gate as Peter gets closer to the girl he can’t help but think of what Ned said. Does he have a crush on MJ? Lately it seems as though everyone knows something about Peter’s romantic life that he doesn’t.
Harry’s face breaks into a delighted grin. “You are adorable.” He leans forward to grab Peter’s hands, holding them carefully in his own. “This is whatever we want it to be. Would it help if I told you what I want us to be?” The brunette nods. “Okay, well, I hope I’ve made it clear that I like you… a lot.” Making Peter blush seems to be a goal of Harry’s if the amount which he is causing it to happen is anything to go by. “And I’d really like us to date, maybe? If that’s something you’d like?”
“Thanks, I appreciate it, I really do… But it was nothing honestly…” Peter trails off, one look to his left and he can tell from the look on Bucky’s face that the man isn’t buying it. “It really was just some stupid school stuff, it made me mad. Much angrier than I really should have been, so I left to go and walk about the city. Just to get some space.”
The look on Harry’s face is priceless but he doesn’t question anything until they’re in the elevator.
Natasha is a much better teacher than Steve was, as good as the man’s intentions had been Peter just felt clumsy the entire time. Nat on the other hand makes Peter look graceful, which he didn’t know was possible outside of running about as a crime fighting spider.
“Um, yeah. It’s nice Tony. Just, it’s quite bare? Doesn’t feel like anyone lives on this floor.” He makes his way over to the large glass windows, looking out across all of New York.
“Ooh, Petey-pie’s got a girlfriend.” Are the first words out of Tony’s mouth. “From the moment I laid eyes on you Pete I knew you would follow after me; brains, looks and killer game with the ladies.”
Peter clears his throat suddenly very uncomfortable. Although he isn’t sure why. Harry knew he was planning to ask MJ to the dance, that isn’t something he has to feel guilty for. Is it? “Yeah, yeah I am…”
“My dad always does this, says he’s sent a car for me but it never shows up when it’s supposed to. What good is having a driver if they can’t do their one job right?” With a chuckle the tension is lifted.
Peter is over the moon when they finally get back to the Tower, shopping is unquestionably not his favourite pastime. Bucky and Sam are waiting for them in the kitchen twin smiles of mischief painted on their faces, the smiles are explained as soon as Sam starts pestering Peter to try on the suit for them.
So, he finds the bar and asks the bartender to give him whatever she comes to first. He gulps down the liquid, ignoring the distinct burn at the back of his mouth. Now seems like as good a time as any to put that theory about his metabolism and alcohol to test.
“Your observation skills are unparalleled my friend.” Both boys chuckle and a small amount of tension leaves the room.
He only realises he has made it out when he can finally feel fresh air filling his lungs. Running on adrenaline now Peter ignores the throbbing pain in his leg and swings away from the burning wreck heading to the only place he can think of.
“Thanks. I just wanted to check because I know we talked about not making it public.” They had discussed that over dinner the previous night. For how high profile their lives are, especially Tony, when they had gotten together and then engaged and finally married the pair had decided to keep all of it very private. Something peter found endlessly impressive due to just how famous the two are. When it came to Peter and their adoption of him they wanted to do the same, keep it very private and amongst just friends and family, which Peter had agreed with whole heartedly. He’s never been one for the spotlight and announcing to the world that he’s been adopted by Iron Man and Captain America, who by the way are married, would more than thrust him into a spotlight.
Peter tries not to let the shock show on his face, realising too late that they didn’t know he had been listening in from upstairs, and it’s not possible for a regular human being to have heard that conversation unless they were in the room.
Although she looks a bit perplexed by the invite at first MJ accepts then turns in the opposite direction from Peter and begins her walk home.
After a few upbeat songs, the tempo drops dramatically to a slow and pleasant melody backing soft lyrics about first love and life changing events. As the second softer song begins Harry’s fingers brush subtly across the back of Peter’s hand, so carefully that he might not even know they were there if he didn’t have super-senses. He slowly turns his hand over so that his palm is facing towards Harry.
“Is there even a book in here you haven’t read?” Peter whispers over her shoulder. “Every time I see you you’ve got a new book in your hands, surely you’ve read them all by now.” MJ just laughs slightly in response and then settles on her new book, pays at the counter and then they’re back out in the New York summer.
Peter had stored away the small bit of information Tony had given him about the weapons that caused the explosion, planning to do some research of his own so that he can start trying to take down the guys making and selling the weapons. If Steve or Tony found out that he was Spider-Man and that this is what he was planning to do, there is no doubt in Peter’s mind that they would try and stop him.
“… this young boy has experienced several tragedies in his short life. He’s very much so still in shock, the poor dear…”
Ned is where Peter left him but he isn’t alone. Tony is sitting beside his best friend chatting away. “Hey there’s the worst host ever. Didn’t anyone ever tell you that its rude to leave your guests alone?” Peter rolls his eyes.
Before long he’s being put into another car, the passenger seat this time, and Peter’s beginning to question whether or not any of this is actually happening. It all feels like some sort of fever dream and he doesn’t think he’s been fully tapped into reality since he first heard the explosion so many hours ago.
“Or there’s a few spare rooms on Cap and I’s floor, which you’re more than welcome to. Whatever makes you feel comfortable kid.”
“Huh?” Mr. Stark points to Peter’s shirt, one of the only three that he owns, which just so happens to be his favourite. Aunt May got it for him on his birthday last year. It’s a plain black t-shirt with ‘the physics is theoretical but the fun is real’ written on it. “Oh, yeah I do. A lot actually.”
“Is that from MJ?” Peter nods. “If you want to deal with that now I can go.” Harry begins to stand from the couch.
Peter doesn’t want to disturb so he just joins their comfortable silence. The thing is, Peter is a fidgetier, ever since he was a child whenever something is bothering him he fidgets. So, he makes it all of twenty minutes into the movie before Tony pulls away from his husband, who isn’t breaking concentration from this movie for anything less than a world-ending event, to gesture to Peter to join him in the kitchen.
It takes ten minutes of awkward feet shuffling for Natasha to step in. “This is too painful to watch, take a seat old man I’ve got it from here.”
Peter is in the bathroom, on his hands and knees scrubbing the tiles with bleach and a toothbrush, when he hears the commotion downstairs. He pauses the ministrations to focus his listening to what is going on.
Getting back on his feet after losing Uncle Ben had been hard enough, and in the last few months Peter had finally begun to feel as though his life was on an upward slope; he was doing well in school, he loved being Spider-Man, he had an amazing best friend, and he and Aunt May had never been closer. Now after one horrific night he’s right back at square one again.
Peter shakes Bruce’s hand probably a bit too enthusiastically. “Oh I know sir, really the pleasure is all mine. I’m a big fan. I’ve read all of you work.”
“Well are any of the other team members going to be there?” Harry presses further. No, Peter responds, it will just be the two of them. “Sounds like a date to me Pete.”
“Peter, I need you to come- What on earth are you doing!?” Mrs Warren stops in her tracks, taken aback by the sight of the teen crouched on the floor scrubbing bleach into the tiles.
It’s only a few hours later, when he’s lying on his bed in the dark, that the events of the night truly catch up with Peter.  The pain of losing Aunt May envelopes him, he can feel the grief in every bone of his body. He curls up into a ball, pulling the sheets tight around him and lets the tears flow.
It’s very quiet inside so they can’t do much talking but watching MJ wander amongst the books is a language in itself. The girl simply belongs here, Peter has never seen her more at ease.
“Pete! Harry! Excellent timing boys, settle an argument for us.” Peter watches as Harry’s face slips back into the mask he presents to the world, joining in gladly with the debate.
“Hey miss, I’m here to help.” He approaches the woman slowly now, not wanting to startle her. She has a blanket wrapped tightly around her but Peter can clearly see her shaking in fear. “I promise I’ll get you out of here safely, you just need to come with me.”
Harry doesn’t appear until the evening is nearly over, Peter’s desperately trying not to think about the fact that the sight of the boy takes his breath away something that hadn’t happened when he had seen MJ.
Peter expects it to take much longer for everything involved with the adoption to start moving than it does. But he supposes when Tony Stark is involved that this is how quickly most things happen when you’re a billionaire and a superhero. It only takes a day for all of the adoption paper work to be signed and confirmed by the relevant children’s boards and the like.
But the pain is easier to handle now because he has Tony and Steve. And Nat, Bucky, Bruce and Sam. Even Rhodey had texted him to tell him to have a good night, and not to let his Dads embarrass him in front of his date, which Peter is planning to stick to.
“Peter!” He keeps walking despite hearing Harry clearly. “Pete, come on please stop.” They’re outside of the Tower now. “Look I’m sorry I was being a total dick.”
He’s reached the uneasy conclusion that he’s just good friends with Harry, nothing more, and the only reason it feels so intense and different is because Harry is so different to any friends he’s had before.
“You know, nothing makes me feel better after I’ve had a bad day than punching the crap out of something.” Bucky smiles at Peter and pulls a punching bag into the centre of the room. “Fancy a go?”
“We’re not here to quiz him about school Tony. Honestly,” The super-soldier rolls his eyes and turns to Peter with a kind smile. “he doesn’t know when to stop. Sorry about that.”
Peter can feel the anger bubbling up inside of him. “What is your problem? You’ve been weird with me ever since I asked MJ out on a date.”
“I knew this was here but I never made the connection.” He shrugs apologetically at Peter and pushes open the doors.
Peter manages to make it back to his alley way without any other issues. He’s now officially exhausted, the adrenaline which had been pumping through his veins before having subsided.
In many ways MJ reminds Peter of Harry. In the way she doesn’t take herself too seriously, or how she doesn’t openly or outwardly express the things she cares about but deep-down MJ is extremely passionate and proud of all of her accomplishments. She presents a mask to the world that portrays her as someone who is uninterested and above it all, but really, she cares just as much as anyone else does.
The look on Bucky’s face switches to sympathetic. “I hear that kid.” The silence falls around them again, much more comfortable this time. It feels safe and trusting.
Harry scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Please Peter, it’s so obvious you don’t actually like her. You could do so much better.”
Peter swallows before speaking, not trusting his own voice at this moment. “A bit shaky still, but better. Thanks.” He smiles slightly at the two men trying to reassure them both.
The two boys make their way to Fifth Avenue, not Peter’s go to spot for shopping, but Harry explains he really wants to get a reaction out of his dad and the best way to do that is to spend ridiculous amounts of money on pointless items.
Harry leaves just before dinner time. Peter walks him down to the lobby and watches the fancy black car until it is out of sight. When he gets back in the elevator he lets JARVIS take him straight to his parent’s floor.
They have just enough time to unpack and relax for half an hour or so when they reach the hotel. Peter and Ned make themselves comfortable quickly, lounging out on their beds in companionable silence.
“It’s hard to miss them when you never really knew them, isn’t it?” Harry vocalises exactly what Peter is thinking. He looks at the blonde boy to see a vulnerability on Harry’s features that has never been present before. “My mom. She died when I was five. I look at pictures of her and I feel like something is missing but I don’t know what it is.”
Peter apologises profusely for being late but Mr Harrington promises that it’s fine and begins to usher everyone on board. He follows Ned onto the bus and is about to sit next to his best friend when he gets pushed into the seat beside MJ by said best friend. Ned just winks at him and takes the seat behind them.
Tony isn’t facing the elevator when Peter stumbles out onto his floor of the Tower. “Welcome home party animal. When Happy said he wasn’t coming to get you anymore I decided to wait up for you.” Peter suppresses a groan, those drinks he gulped down too fast are really starting to not agree with him.
It’s just passing eleven so he doesn’t expect anyone to still be in the common area. Normally by this time of night Tony is in his workshop or one of the labs, where Peter has been joining him recently, and Steve usually can be found drawing or watching some movie or tv show he’s been recommended to catch up on; recently he’s been making his way through season 4 of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. He’s not been here long but already Peter knows the routine, of course the introduction of the rest of the team means that this is likely to change, as Peter discovers when he enters the kitchen.
