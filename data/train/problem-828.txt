“My son, thank you. This means more than you know.” The Shining One’s face glowed with pride and love. Cain shot an annoyed glance at Abel before speaking.
"John." Sherlock said, wincing when he voice came out higher than normal. He half ran over to John's red armchair, freezing when he saw him sitting there, newspaper spread across his lap. "What are you doing here?"
“Don’t mention marriage to Victor.” Sherlock’s voice rose, and John could hear a tinge of panic in his tone. “We haven’t been dating all that long. I don’t want you to scare him off.”
“I didn’t like anyone at the time, but it made Mummy happy to think me in a committed relationship.” Mycroft replied.
“It’s not like I broke it to them gently.” He reminded Mycroft. “’Mentioned’ is such a casual word.”
“I can’t say the same for you.” Sherlock huffed. He wouldn’t give John the satisfaction to know that he
"We originally had ocean-like protection in there for him," another scientist said, glancing at the first. "But he refused to come out for further study. We had no choice to sedate him and remove the obstacles for now."
“That’s my style.” John grinned. “And they never said it would automatically inject sedative into my neck if I picked the lock.”
Sheol smiles at his friend-brother, knowing that the likelihood of travelling with them is low. But he agrees with him quietly, if only to appease him.
John opened his eyes, surprised to see how close his face was to Sherlock's. He licked the water from his lips nervously, heart fluttering when Sherlock's eyes flicked down to watch the movement of his tongue.
“Of course, that’s what friends do, isn’t it?” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he looked at John in panic, worried that he had made a mistake.
Leaving the makeshift morgue, Sherlock strolled to the source of the commotion, unsurprised to find a slew of doctors surrounding a man who has already started to glow.
all related. There were similarities, sure, but something about the group indicated that they were merely colleagues, not related at all.
“Anyway, I was calling to confirm the seating order.” Mummy continued. “Victor is still coming to our winter estate for Christmas, correct?”
"The gunshot wound was approximately the height of a shooter of 5 foot 6 inches." Sherlock said, breaking his silence.
“That would be…nice.” Sherlock says, looking faintly surprised. “I confess, I’ve missed your family.”
"Ha." He said, grabbing the newspaper and beginning to flip through it. "It's a fool’s holiday, contrived to convince people to purchase more candy. It has no import to the daily lives of-"
He walked up to the dying man, ignoring the doctors that are frantically milling around him. They are unimportant. Why bother memorising their faces when he would just have to watch them die later? His eyes focused on the one who is dying, and he removed his leather glove, reaching a hand out to take the man’s soul.
“John?” Sherlock asked in confusion, but John just shook his head with a smile, gesturing for Sherlock to follow him. He led Sherlock through a winding path through the estate, ending up in a small, enclosed porch with a crackling fireplace.
“Victor will read it this year.” Sherlock said, plopping back down in his spot. “But if he reads it wrong, then I’ll read it next year.”
“Sorry, rules are rules.” Donovan said, not unkindly. “We’ll take you into the station, and sort it out from there.”
“That won’t work.” Sherlock said as soon as he opened the door, watching the blond jolt. He snapped on both cuffs before untying the scarf expertly. “But a good escape attempt anyway.”
“Sherlock!” I call at the end of the day on Friday, running to catch up to the curly-haired brunet. He gives me a wary glance, but he stops.
They spent the rest of the afternoon talking, the girl storming off in a huff after Sherlock deduced her failing grades. John, it turned out, was an excellent rugby player, and he wanted Sherlock to come see him play. Sherlock told John that he was an excellent violinist, and that he wanted John to hear him play. When they parted that evening, it was in high spirits, and Sherlock was pleased at how well the evening had turned out. He snuck back to his pod later that night, taking off while John was still asleep. There were several missed holograms from his parents, and at least five just from Mycroft, but nothing could bring him down.
Mummy gave them a disapproving look, and both Sherlock and Mycroft hung their heads in shame and fear. It was never good to cross mummy.
Mycroft smiled at her, brushing invisible dust from his Prefect badge. "While I'd love to have one last chat, I'm afraid I must make my way to the prefect carriage."
“Boys! Dinner is ready, and- good lord, you two aren’t smoking out here, are you?” She demanded, looking upset.
“I will not.” Mycroft said, not denying the fact that it could happen. “We need someone to do your job well, or bad things could happen.”
John nodded once, using his arms to lift his body out of the water. Once his caudal fin had cleared the surface, he swung his body around, lowering himself over the side.
“After all,” Sherlock continues, oblivious to my staring. “You’re still trying to flirt with him even though he’s obviously disinterested. I believe scaring you away is the next best thing.”
John was cut off again, but this time it wasn’t with words, but something that sounded very passionate, and slightly wet. Sherlock took a step back, feeling the blood drain from his face.
On this day, August 31st, in 1990, a child by the name of Robottko was born. It was decreed that every year on her birthday, she shall update every fanfiction that is a WIP. So, it is with great honor that I present to you this update.
“Sheol!” A voice called, full of excitement. The sound pulls Sheol from his thoughts, and he looks at the leaves around him in mild surprise, as if the tree had grown around him instead of him climbing it just this morning. “Sheol!” The voice calls again, and Sheol knows that it is his friend-brother looking for him. Sheol looked down from his tree branch, a smile creeping over his face.
“Right, well, I’ll talk to Father about all this.” Molly sighed, shuffling her papers. “You’re free to go.”
Jennifer’s face went a brilliant pink, matching her sparkling dress quite well. Without another word, she whipped around, darting through the crowd of people to get as far away from Sherlock and me as possible.
“Oh, you can read?” the elder dragon said, and John’s new master turned to look at him with increased interest.
They circled higher and higher, until they flew above the goal posts. John pulled back so that he was flying next to Sherlock, and they soared around the pitch several times in silence. It was beautiful up here, with the lake glittering in the distance. The Forbidden Forest was an imposing wall of trees. Even from this height, Sherlock couldn't see the end of it.
“Yes, but you never keep them.” Molly replied, looking down at the papers. “In fact, you rarely even bother bringing them to your realm at all. Yet you kept one John Watson…”
Mummy's shriek of joy made the two of them jump. Sherlock looked over at her, startled to find that she had tears in her eyes.
“No, it wasn’t you.” Sherlock says after a minute. “You don’t have the disposition to kill someone in such a manner. But this means that someone is trying to frame you.”
“You’ll share that sentiment with my family.” Sherlock promised. “The wishing to be rid of me, that is. Don’t worry about not fitting in with them.”
“I’ll be right back.” Sherlock replied, opening his car door, the keys clanking in his hand. “I just have to relinquish my phone and keys, and I will promptly release you.”
“I’m going to their winter estate in Yorkshire.” Sherlock said, not for the first time. “Not their home. And I wouldn’t leave early. For one thing, Victor isn’t done with work. And I don’t want to spend a second longer than I have to with my family.”
Jim beams at me, clapping his hands together happily. “Oh, I knew you wouldn’t be mad, Johnny boy! You’re just
John had not been expecting someone to be waiting for him when he walked past his favourite bench on a rare sunny afternoon. He was lost in thought, despondent after his many failed attempts at talking to a certain angel, when a voice broke through his musings.
“No. Well, I suppose one final time.” John sighs. “But until then, I shall be on my best behaviour.”
The next thing Greg, Mike and I try is bleaching his jeans, but that ends in failure as well. By the weeks end, everyone has bleached their overpriced jeans, trying to follow Victor’s trend.
“Yes.” Mycroft managed to look only slightly guilty. “I have important work to do, and I can’t just leave my mobile for days on end. Sherlock has my personal phone.”
The only person who ended up leaving was Sherlock, as most people don't take kindly to being called an idiot. Not that being thrown out was going to stop Sherlock, of course, but it did put a damper on his mood.
“Sherlock has been crushing out on you from day one, don’t deny it.” Mary replied, holding up a finger to silence Sherlock. “I saw the way you would watch him during rugby last year.”
Sherlock was famous for his temper, and even more famous for his genius. If you got on his bad side, he would pick you apart and reveal your darkest secrets. Or so John had been told. He had seen the aftermath of Sherlock's deductions a few times, but he had never witnessed it for himself. Whenever John was in the room, Sherlock seemed to claim up before disappearing, which frustrated John to no end.
"Jim?" John asked, raising an eyebrow. "I haven't actually been pursuing him. That's all on his end."
“Lestrade.” The DI said, causing Sherlock to frown at the non-sequitur. He turned to look at the silver haired DI once more.
“Then I will stay.” Sherlock brushed his greatcoat, silver waistcoat flashing in the sun. “But you must be careful around strange boys, especially ones that have a jealous ghost following them.”
John Watson had been living with Sherlock Holmes for five months, and he had never been happier. Not that he would admit it, of course, nor did that mean he no longer wanted his freedom.
“Ah, brother mine.” A voice said, and Sherlock looked round to see Mycroft standing there, a lit cigarette in hand.
"What makes you think the creature is intelligent enough to communicate with us?" A third man said, clearly a politician.
He started the car, allowing it to warm up, and to give John ample walking time, before putting the car into drive. It takes only five minutes before he sees John’s hunched figure, arms wrapped around his body to keep himself warm. He rolls his eyes again before rolling town the passenger side window.
"Oh, you're a muggleborn too?" Molly asked, looking far more hopeful. "Is it hard, trying to catch up with everyone?"
Cain bent down as well, pressing his hand to where the glow had appeared. Panic spread across Cain’s face, and he shook Abel harder. “Brother! Wake up, oh please wake up.”
“Don’t be like that, Sherlock.” Father said. “Sebastian Wilkes Sr. is our neighbour, and it would be in poor taste to miss such an important interview. If you get the job, you would be working with your old friend, Sebastian Wilkes Jr.”
“Um…excuse me?” A soft voice interrupted, causing both Sherlock and Molly to jump. The blond man with the frumpy jumper stood there, looking vaguely amused, and Sherlock noted distantly that he was much handsomer than he had originally thought. “I was wondering if I could order my coffee.”
The professor waves his hand lethargically and Mike shrugs in response, catching my eye before digging into his burlap bag, pulling out the candy canes one by one. “One for Timothy Dimmock. Nice, Dimmock! One for Jim Moriarty, you deserve it, Jimmy! Four for Glen Coco, you go Glen Coco! One for John Watson, and none for Sebastian Moran. Bye!”
John continued walking along an unknown London street, his limbs feeling heavier by the second.  He ducked down an alley, trying to confuse anyone who would think to follow him. Not that anyone noticed him, but the less straightforward path he took, the better. He had almost made it out of the alley when his knees buckled, sending him toppling into the side of a skip.
“Sherlock.” John grinned at him, looking entirely unconcerned that his life could have ended. “It’s good to see you.”
Mycroft sat primly at the Slytherin table on the far end of the hall. The other Slytherins clustered around him, but Mycroft paid them no mind. He focused his entire attention on Sherlock instead, looking strangely...proud, and Sherlock figured he was seeing things.
Molly had been having a nice dinner with Tom when the police arrived at her door. Tom was, of course, very confused. Not that Molly wasn’t, of course, but when they mentioned Sherlock’s name, she could hardly bothered to be surprised.
“Mrs Hudson, dear.” She hummed, welcoming them in. The landing was small, and John could see a small staircase leading up to what he assumed would be their flat. “Just up this way! Come along!”
“Bring him to paradise.” The angel said softly, turning back to Sheol. “He gets to rest in comfort forever with The Shining One.”
“I need all night to prepare.” He said, breaking away from their small group and dashing towards his livestock. “I want my gift to be perfect!”
In front of him there was a shock of blond-going-grey hair, and Sherlock grinned, quickly hiding himself. While most people saw right through Sherlock, John had discovered how to
“Oh, hello, Sherlock!” A cheery voice said, and Sherlock looked up to see one of the only angel’s he could stand. Molly stood there, a big smile on her face, and an even larger ream of papers in her hand. She waved a hand, ushering him into her office.
“A caged animal, no matter how small, can be very dangerous.” Mycroft replied sombrely. “Do not take them lightly.”
Kublai Khan, fourth son of Tolui, grandson of Genghis Khan, was a powerful man indeed. Sheol had seen his work as he reaped souls, admiring the man’s strength from afar. He had come up close and personal to the leader when he took the soul of Chabi, his favourite wife.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking, sometimes I don’t talk for days on end,” Sherlock replied, trying to sound breezy. “Potential flatmates ought to know the worst about each other.”
“Sherlock!” Victor grins, “You’re eating with us today. We’ve missed you so much. You probably haven’t met the newest member of our group! Sherlock this is…John, what are you wearing?” Victor’s face wrinkles when he sees my shirt.
Sherlock turned his head to look at the Gryffindor table, unable to contain his grin when he saw John wave at him. Sherlock gave him a small wave in return before turning to face the front of the Great Hall.
"I didn't know, I saw," Sherlock interrupted. Best get this over with as soon as possible. "You're a military man, judging by your haircut and posture, and you've got a tan, but it only goes to your wrists. So you've been overseas, but not sunbathing. It wasn't a difficult leap."
“Nasty habit, cigarettes.” Mycroft said, flicking ash to the snow below. “But I can’t quit it. Never take up smoking.”
“What sort of business is he in again?” Molly asked, placing the milk under the steaming wand and starting it up.
“Never met them.” He replies, snatching up my laptop. I debate on complaining, but Sherlock doesn’t seem the type to care who’s stuff he’s using, or if it makes the person upset.
“I love you too, John.” Sherlock said, leaning his forehead against John’s, sharing his air. “I missed you these past couple of months.”
John looked down at Sherlock, slowing his breakneck pace. His hair was just as lovely as the first day Sherlock had seen it, and he reached out to touch it, his limbs moving slowly.
It was later in the day, at least, from what he could tell, when he came upon a strange looking planet. The majority of it was blue and it had white swirling around in its atmosphere. Under the white, Sherlock could catch tiny glimpses of green, and his curiosity got the better of him. He flew around the planet, deciding eventually to land on a smallish island just off the coast of a larger landmass. There was a large area of light near the south, and he avoided it, heading instead for darker areas.
"No, not that," John said crossly. "The...whatever you said about my limp and cane. You said I don't? Don't what?"
Afghanistan was, as always, brutally hot. Being dressed in dark colours didn’t do anything to alleviate that fact. But he refused to remove his gloves until he actually needed to take a soul. His youth was filled with souls taken entirely too young because of a careless gesture or a friendly embrace.
The blond snorted, and he resumed looking out the window, leaving Sherlock to his thoughts. This soldier was…pleasant to be around. Far less annoying than Victor had ever been, and less annoyed with his deductions as well. Sherlock was fairly pleased with how things seemed to be turning out. If he and the blond could become…well, not friends, but perhaps form a mutual approval of each other, then this weekend wouldn’t be completely awful. Of course, it was that moment when he had decided to make a proper introduction that the petrol light needed to come on, the bright chime dragging him from his mind palace.
“I’ve never seen you take such an avid interest in a mortal before.” Greg’s voice floated from behind him, and Sherlock turned to glare. “Not even with your name-sakes, or Otto.”
“Carl Powers?” I ask, surprised that I know the name. “That’s the boy that stopped me in the cafeteria yesterday.”
Sherlock shot John a pleased smile, wriggling ever so slightly in the red and gold armchair. "It was nothing special."
John pouted, but he ran over to Sherlock, giving him a hug. “Please come back soon? I don’t want you to get in trouble, but maybe your mum and dad will let you visit again?”
and it wasn’t until he was in the car, a shiny new stockpot in the back seat, that he realised what had happened.
Sherlock's hand was shaken multiple times and he was quite sure that the limb would fall off in the next few hours or so.
"What are your thoughts on vampires?" Sherlock asked, stopping quickly. It took Watson a few seconds to realise he had stopped, and he turned around to join him once more.
"Tom." John nodded once, an odd expression flicking across his face. Before Sherlock could comprehend, John's face became studiously blank.
“His name is Sheol.” The Shining One says behind him. “And he is your punishment for sin. For no matter how far you run, he shall find you. For you were made from the dust, and to the dust you will return.”
"This doesn't make sense," Sherlock growled, scales forming on his neck in annoyance. "No human would be able to do this."
“Because you were a doctor as well as a solider.” Sherlock said in a clipped tone. “And half the dragons at the Yard are complete idiots. Are you coming or not?”
"He just transferred," I interrupt, gently pushing Oliver off of me. "He did it to surprise me. Now excuse me, I have to go find someone."
“You were in the desert with me.” John said, completely ignoring the man’s angry accusation. “You saved my life.”
“I would like for you to kiss me.” Sheol said softly, his pale face going slightly pink. “I believe it would be mutually beneficial. And perhaps if you began the contact and you aren’t my soul-mate, then you might be spared.”
“Yes, fine.” Sherlock grabbed his glass of wine, staring at the red liquid in deep thought. “When I was younger, probably eight or nine, my family spent Christmases in our regular home near London. We didn’t own the estate yet.”
He could hear to pairs of feet walking toward him, and he could barely contain himself, practically leaping from his discovery.
If there is some one in history that you want Sheol/Sherlock to encounter, please tell me, and I would be more than willing to write about it! Feel free to leave a comment or message me on my Tumblr (Robottko) and I will totally do that for you!
“Can I talk to you Sherly?” He asks, his lip pouting slightly. Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at Victor.
“Dad, not funny.” I say, which causes him to crack up even more. Shooting an apologetic look at Sherlock, I practically drag him into my room.
"That's what I had suspected," Sherlock replied, "but the finger prints on the gun we found were human sized. Even when a dragon is in their humanoid form, their fingerprints are much larger. They're running the prints now to see if there are any matches in the system."
“Thank you, brother.” Mycroft smirked, handing him the key to John Watson’s chains. “This is for you. Be careful.”
"Anderson, Phillip" Became a Ravenclaw, to which the table on the right burst into applause. It was after that Sherlock lost track, their group slowly dwindling. Student after student made their way up to the Sorting Hat. Sometimes the hat would make a decision, other times it would take a while. Mycroft told Sherlock that it had taken the Sorting Hat five minutes to sort him, something that had made him oddly proud.
Oh, this was bad. This was very bad. Sentiment on its own was a destructive force, but to fall in love with someone who was so impossibly out of reach was a death sentence.
“Naturally. I don’t know why you act so surprised.” Sherlock chuckled. He earned nothing but an aggravated sigh from Mycroft, who quickly entered the warm house, Sherlock tailing him closely. With all the excitement that had happened over the past few days, you would think dinner would be calm.
"Oh, my baby is getting married!" Mummy cried as John slipped the band on Sherlock's finger. It fit rather well, considering it was a woman's wedding band. A bit snug, but not so obvious that it was meant for someone else.
He walked over to the hook, pulling the scarf free. If he took action now, he might be able to catch Tom before his blind date gave up looking for him.
“And you killed him.” Mycroft retorted. “I will not remove you from your duties. You are stuck with them forever, and we are stuck with you.”
John floated awkwardly in the middle of the tank, looking nervous and unsure of what to do. Sherlock gave him a small wave when he looked around, and John relaxed minutely, swimming a tight circuit of the tank to the delight of the crowd.
“Sorry to say you won’t be the best anymore.” Greg says as Mike calms down. “We’ve got a genius in the class.”
“A ward for dangerous humans?” Sherlock rolled his eyes at the markings above the door to the corridor. “How on earth could
the eye roll from Sherlock. “I would have done the same thing if it were a female dragon. Sentiment is foolish, and women are not my area.”
Tom was great, really. He was handsome, funny, and moderately clever. He was everything John should want in a potential boyfriend.
“Nice job out there, John. You look…really good.” She says, her face reddening before darting back out onto the stage to continue the program.
“You missed Victor putting the star at the top of the tree.” Violet said. “But you’re just in time for ‘
He pocketed his card and receipt, keeping hold of the fuzzy handcuffs as he exited the rundown petrol station. The whole situation had been far too close for comfort, and it was taking every ounce of Sherlock’s self-control not to bolt to the car.
Mycroft merely smiled at her before turning his full attention on his food. A comfortable silence settled over the dining room, each person enjoying the comradery without having to spoil it with useless chatter. A small movement from John caught Sherlock’s eye, and he looked over, surprised to see John grinning at him. He smiled back, a warm, swooping sensation completely turning his brain offline for a second.
“You really are.” I agree with him. “I bet Jim is looking for you. He called to tell me how much he missed you over winter break.”
“No, I can’t.” Sherlock pants, pushing away from me, looking guilty. “I’m sorry, I…can’t cheat on Victor.”
The room is silent as Sherlock's family muses over John's words. Sherlock couldn't bring himself to look at John, worried that he would find pity in his eyes.
“That’s because I created the job.” Sherlock told him. “Only one in the world. I’m hoping to be able to work with the police soon. Naturally, they refuse to take me seriously because of my age.”
John didn't notice the posters at first. In fact, it wasn't until Friday afternoon that he bothered to read one.
He was glaring at Mycroft, dark blue eyes locked on the taller figure, clearly searching for ways to escape. The lack of clothing, save for a small swatch of leather over his most intimate parts, showed straining muscles, trying to pull the chains from the wall.
He moved his body closer, forcing Sherlock’s legs apart as he stood between them and leaned over him. He slid his hand around to cup Sherlock’s jaw and tilt it up so he could press a kiss to the man’s neck. He could feel his pulse jumping wildly under his lips.
He recognized the shape and size instantly as the one that had haunted his thoughts for so long now.
Sherlock immediately whirled around, and for the second time in so many hours, John was fixed with a wide-eyed stare of horror from his best friend.
Sherlock probably would have managed to avoid John for days if Lestrade hadn’t texted John later that evening.
In the cab, John felt remorse tugging at his stomach. Sherlock had seemed uncharacteristically awkward at the crime scene, nearly bumping into not one but two different Yard officers. The flush, too, returned to Sherlock’s cheekbones any time he caught John’s eye. To John’s immense relief, Sherlock continue to rattle off observations to him here and there. John silently thanked the other man for this, because it meant he couldn’t be
It was something John couldn’t explain to other people who knew Sherlock, because as far as he knew he was the only one allowed entrance to this secret corner in the vast and intricate labyrinth that was Sherlock’s life.
He opened the door to his flat and shrugged off his jacket, noting the silence. Sherlock had been there when he’d left, but the place was dead quiet. Perhaps Lestrade had called with a case and Sherlock had scampered off?
John stared at dark-haired man who was sitting at the table typing furiously into his laptop. He hadn’t acknowledged John’s presence as he’d descended the stairs, nor as he fixed a cup of tea. Make that
Ah, yes. Of course. John pulled away and his posture softened, but he maintained a close eye on Sherlock’s actions. Anytime drugs and Sherlock were involved, John took no chances, even if the man was simply gathering evidence from less the than savory characters involved.
Sherlock didn’t respond – hardly moved – but John could feel him crumple a little. He let his eyes drop from John’s intense gaze.
"I reconsidered." he said grimly. "I know him better than anyone, I know what kind of man he is. Grieving for however long I'll be away would certainly damage him, if not... worse."
John took a few seconds to process the information. "Cause there aren't enough men in the British Secret Services to take care of this, huh?" he tilted his head to the side.
will never say, but he'll miss you even more than I. Would you try to spare us from losing you again?" Sherlock felt himself near tearing up again, but at the same time, the landlady's words brought a smile to his face.
When they locked eyes again - to phrase it the way John most definitely would've -, Sherlock could've sworn sparks were flying, violently, swiftly, capable of catching fire at any given second. Chills ran down his spine as he felt his breath against his lips. He had to grab fistfuls of John's sweater to ground himself. It was happening. It really was.
"Look, John, I don't think I could ever say anything quite like what you told me in the cemetary," he looked up at him shyly, "but I'll have you know that I've never had the luck to encounter anyone quite as brave, wise and kind as you. Anyone, who'd believe in me despite how much I've lied to and hurt them. Anyone, who'd mourn me if I died and missed me if I left. Anyone, who praised what I do instead of cursing it. You do your fair share of cursing as well, but to be honest, I don't blame you-" John didn't have the patience to wait for the end of it. He stepped down and pulled him close, burying his face into his shoulder. Being used to the situation by then, Sherlock didn't hesitate to return it.
I'm so sorry I took so long with this, lovelies! I worked every free minute I had to give you the most beautiful ending I could. Here they are, my boys, going out with their quiet little explosion. Enjoy, and see you in something new sometime soon ~ xx
*, was not part of the plan in the slightest. People like him don't deserve to love people like John. And yet, here he was. Longing so stupidly after a man who would never look at him the same if he told him. Running after a train that wouldn't wait for him.
Long minutes passed like that, in silence, in the warmth of each other's embrace. But, as per usual, the cogs in the detective's head were still turning endlessly. He wanted to say the words, wanted to know the answer and finally settle everything that might hold him back and turn his mind away from the mission he was given. But what kind of bloody fool says goodbye with a love confession? Even he wasn't so dramatic. Plus he didn't want to raise questions that he might never get to answer. No, it was either in a moment better than the one they shared there, or never.
That day was merely a fragment of his imagination. His Sherlock Holmes was very much alive, regarding him with a curious look as if he hadn't just been screamed at. And he had physical proof as well. He just tossed him his charger.
It'd been two weeks since that conversation. Both Holmes brothers were completely silent, and while John understood how serious the situation was if Mycroft Holmes stood up from his desk for it, he couldn't help being impatient. Not giving him a sign was so much like them, but what if... what if they didn't signal because both of them had been buried six feet underground somewhere in the Serbian woodlands? He barely ate and barely slept in those two weeks, though Mrs. Hudson and Molly tried their best to convince him otherwise. And that rainy April day, he had been sent home from work several hours earlier, and told to "get some fucking rest" as he looked "like death warmed over".
John clearly enjoyed their situation. First, it was only continuous huffs of air well audible in the quiet room, evolving into giggling, then full-on laughter. With him or at him, Sherlock had no way of knowing. But oblivion sounded quite blissful for once. Just that once. The consulting detective himself let out some embarrassed chuckles. Even though he was squished to the ground face first, he had to admit - there was something quite amusing, maybe even humourous in how they ended up.
a.k.a. Sherlock and John fucking sit down and talk instead of repressing everything and waiting for the other to read his mind and understand.
John smiled at him for a split second, ever bitter and faint, but still there. "No. You didn't." He lifted his left hand from the armrest, it still trembling as it touched Sherlock's own. Despite everything, his touch was warm as ever. A breath of life against the detective's cold skin. John's eyes were fixed at the rug below their feet again for quite some time, before he cleared his throat again. "Excuse me" he said, and stood up from his chair, heading out of the living room and towards his own, away from Sherlock.
. "I asked you if you could help me with a blog title." he said, giving Sherlock a look with the slightest hint of disappointment.
He's broken. He's scarred. He's definitely not the same person who left. But he's here. He's his. And John Watson is never committing the mistake of letting him go ever again.
John completely lost track of time. Next thing he knew, he was tugging the detective by his bathrobe towards the armchairs. Sherlock was surprisingly submissive, and surprisingly eager to be kissed or touched. Had he never had any romantic partners before? With the ways he acted around people, it was entirely possible.
protect people." he got up from his seat, and followed his flatmate outside. As usual, he didn't know where or why they were going, no one ever knows with him. Was the nod the invitation? John shrugged. That was, by far, not the strangest thing to have happened to him.
John woke with a start. It wasn't yet morning, else some light would've seeped through the curtains. He wondered for a second what could've woken him, and when he heard the whimpers from the other side of the bed, everything became clear. Sherlock tossed and turned, distress written on his face, and the doctor had no idea how to help him. Whenever he had a nightmare, he'd wake to the same song being played on the violin every single time. (Another thing Sherlock figured out probably by deduction. John kept a list at that point and it wasn't exactly short.) Nothing good could've possibly come out of it if John tried the same method. But there had to be something to soothe him.
"Is it my fault you're practically a skeleton?" There was a bit of edge in John's question. And, as Sherlock had observed before, a riled up John was, by far, the best to conversate with. There was no way he could've left him without an answer.
"You stuck to me like glue. Which is... good, as I could still fit next to you lying down, but also... the last time I slept like this with another man was during my military days, when we had a 2-person sleeping place for the 5 of us. You're like them a lot. You hold rather strong. People couldn't tell if they looked at you." responded John, a smile still evident in his voice. So, what he cuddled into merely minutes ago... what he thought was a pillow was actually...
"What do you want me to say?" the detective sprung to his feet to face him. "If I let you come, it's inevitable you suffer, and there's a good chance you won't make it. I'd have to watch you die, and then the whole past week, me jumping off a bloody roof and you grieving would be worthless!" he explained with increasing volume, taking small steps even closer to his flatmate.
The early afternoon found Sherlock Holmes asleep on his bed, pulled curtains making the room adequately dark. He looked so... peaceful, lying there. The sight was so rare, so sacred that John would have felt it a crime to disturb him. His blanket kicked to the end of the bed, the younger man slept with his shirt off, back turned towards the door, towards John. He was even thinner than before, if that was possible. And as he gradually came closer, he noticed them.
He glanced out of the window. Judging from the position of the moon, it must've been around midnight. He was ready.
"-and Mycroft will cover my half of the rent. He just doesn't know it yet." Sherlock explained with a sly smile, already envisioning his brother's face in the moment he tells him.
"SHERLOCK!" he called out, his desperate cry ringing in his ears. Once again, not what he intended. He wanted to call his name much quieter and softer, why did he scream? He shivered again. Of course. That, too, was from that day, wasn't it?
"He called you a couple minutes ago. It woke me up, so I answered it while you were knocked out." The detective couldn't help but wonder how that conversation went. Now that he mentioned it, he might have heard his ringtone in his dream, but didn't recognise it. As he looked at John, the older man was still grinning at him.
"I got sent home as I look like shit." he grinned, and crouched down next to the man, who still looked confused to see him. "If it helps, I didn't expect you to be back either. Neither of you texted."
Yet there was no riding crop this time. As the consulting detective was preoccupied with a microscope and whatever it was he was examining, Molly treated John to coffee. He found it odd, since the woman never particularly sought his company. Her smile a little weak and tired, stories about cats and decaying corpses not very amusing. But he listened regardless. With all the cold ignorance she had received from Sherlock, at least someone had to listen to the poor thing. It was definitely worth it for at least the coffee, she'd got better at making it.
Yes, the time would come, but first, he needed to take care of something else. The stage was set, the curtain rose, and he was ready to meet him. Meet Death, who was impatiently waiting for him in his own Samarra.
"There's been a slight change of plans, Mycroft." The younger got to the point immediately. He had a lot of time to think in the dark cellar he hid in. He knew exactly how he wanted things to go as long as he could still control them.
Hours passed like that. He kept on writing and re-writing, crumbling paper, discarding it and restarting from the very beginning, sneering harsh insults at the paper balls. It felt like the first time he ever composed. With a smirk, he remembered how he worked an entire week on that piece, and how proud he was of it when he finished. For about five minutes, before Mycroft called it tedious.
), the shivers when he ran his eyes over him, or licked his lips. And there was the memory. The moment of looking at his new flatmate and knowing: he shot the cabbie from the opposite building. His thoughts and heart raced each other then, trying to see which of them's faster, because John Watson, the very John Watson he met just a day prior, just killed a man
He threw his phone aside, and stepped off the ledge. Sherlock Holmes was falling, falling to his demise yet again, and there's not enough time to react, nothing to do, John failed again, failed to keep him alive, keep him by his side, Sherlock is dead, and-
"There you go. All ready now. Go and do whatever it is you're supposed to do. And maybe get some milk on the way back." he barely dared to look into his eyes.
"I want to visit Baker Street tomorrow. Come with me." Baker Street... he never thought he'd miss it so much, and it had only been a week since he 'died'. Agreeably, everything would've been better than his damp, ominous and quite lonesome shelter, but nothing quite as good as home. He missed Mrs. Hudson caring for him like his mother would. Missed the tea he found on his bedside table every single morning, the skull and the stabbed papers on the mantelpiece, the smiling face and the bullet holes on the wall. And John Watson. Lord, how he missed John Watson.
Dr. John Watson woke up drenched in cold sweat. It felt like somebody was standing on his chest, slowly crushing his lungs. His stomach in a tight knot, he was gasping for air, and trying to forget all he saw. But there was no forgetting the events of that afternoon. Sherlock's lifeless corpse appeared every time he closed his eyes, the body that was once him, the extraordinary man he loved despite all the pain he caused him. He broke out in loud, ugly sobs, not caring if Mrs. Hudson heard or not. Dreams might not have been real, but corpses were. Tombstones and funerals were.
A brief, but telling sigh sounded at the other end of the line. "You went to the cemetery when I told you not to go, didn't you?"
That night, in the dim light provided by the fireplace, Sherlock Holmes played his own requiem. When the thoughts, of John, of Moriarty, of his brother, and of the mission became suffocating, he took his dear violin in his hands again, laying a few blank sheets of paper on the music stand, and began playing something new. The calmer, soft melody in the forming did wonders. He used it as his own metaphorical shock blanket, easing him into a fragile peace of mind. Soon there was nothing but him, his instrument, and the diligent scribbling of notes.
His first steps led him immediately to the bathroom, to take a shower, then to his room to change. Only after that, on his way to the kitchen to grab a cuppa did he see that the flat was exactly in the messy state he'd left it in. Then... who was inside? And were they still in there with him? As he headed inside the so rarely used room, the answer became obvious as he glanced at the dinner table suspiciously. He took a step back.
John held him tight, muttering through his tears about how much he hated him, and how he was a bloody bastard. And Sherlock let him. He rubbed circles into his back, not really knowing what else to do, or how to comfort him. Nobody ever came to him for comfort. But that, there and then, felt right. John Watson in his arms felt right, more than anything ever.
What now? John asked him a lot of things. Title suggestions, whether he wanted coffee or tea, to buy something from the store, why were there eyeballs in the microwave, and so on. A thousand options, a million possible answers. No time to consider them all. "Black, two sugars, thank you." The coffee question was the most common, especially at that hour of the morning. Given it was still 9 o'clock. He'd lost count of just how much time he spent doing what he did. The talking continued. He could hear him, but ignored him. Probably not important.
That word frightened and motivated him at the same time. In order for John to know, he had to come home to him, or he would've been as oblivious as he generally was about everything else. He probably still thought love was a mystery to Sherlock. And frankly, it was. But he'd had cases stranger than that mystery. He could cope.
"Visiting." The elder Holmes replied as if that was the most obvious thing in the world. "I wanted to see how you are doing these days."
"I stood right there." he began walking forward, towards him, fists clenched. "I saw you jump! You had no pulse!" he yelled, now standing face-to-face with him. Yet, even if he was sure he was getting punched, Sherlock couldn't tear his eyes away from John Watson. He only had that day and maybe the next morning with him, then there was no guarantee they would ever see each other again. He didn't let a single moment go to waste. "I stood at your bloody grave, Sherlock Holmes, what have you got to say for yourself?!" The doctor grabbed him by the lapels of his coat, pulling him closer, way too close. His last yell came out as an angry, trembling whisper.
"Black, two sugars, thank you." The younger man responded, anxious thoughts spiraling into his brain, drowning the blissful ones.
"Often" Sherlock smiled. "None of them as good as this." There was a blissful silence between them. For once, nothing left unsaid, held back, nothing hidden. As their swollen lips reunited in a slower, more intimate kiss, the world seemed to have stopped turning, the moment creating them a perfect little infinity of their own. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. The way the started. The way they were always meant to be.
"So did I." the reply came immediately. For several, long-seeming seconds, they sat there, looking into each other's eyes, while John tried to figure out what to say to him. What do people normally say to the man they've loved for nearly five years now?
The passion in the next kiss was so sudden John forgot where or who he was for a split second. But, God, did it matter? Lips, tongues, teeth crashed as both men regained their previous confidence. The doctor held on to Sherlock's shoulders, fingers clutching hard, and pulled him close, closer, until their foreheads touched. Somewhere deep down, he was afraid he'd disappear if he let go for even just one second.
He hid behind the door as Mycroft entered their living room. Not even half a minute later, he heard John's voice from inside, loud and pissed off.
"He isn't." John sighed from relief. "But he's got himself in quite the trouble. I'm on my way there. If everything goes well, you'll see him again soon. But do be careful with him. I don't think I have to explain to you how war changes a man." And he hung up, leaving the other man no chance to speak.
. The whole thing was packed with milk cartons of various kinds, enough for a family of eight for a week. The sight was hilarious enough, and then came the note. A scrap of paper taped to one of the cartons, the message written with neat letters.
"Well, this is charming, I've really missed this!" he was nearly shouting as he stood up from his armchair. "The ice cold, solitary detective was a nice act, people and the press loved it, but can we go back to Sherlock Holmes, human being for a second here?! You can't do everything alone! For fuck's sake, Sherlock, I..." he stopped, left hand clenched in a fist to stop it from shaking. After taking a deep breath, and gathering his thoughts, he continued. "Give me a valid reason. Tell me why. Say the word, one word, and you know I'll stay. Just tell me why you don't let me help with this."
"Pink is intuitive and insightful, showing tenderness and kindness with its empathy and sensitivity."
He went through all that pain, suffering and agony just to dismantle a criminal web. And there was probably more Sherlock 'forgot' to mention in his texts not to worry him. The man, John concluded, was braver than some whom he'd met at his weapons training, who dropped out and ran along home after days. Maybe even braver than a few of his comrades. And he was the very man fate, taking the form of Mike Stamford, brought his way. He couldn't be more grateful. Even just his return was miraculous. "Still not a hero now, are you?" he asked with an absent-minded smile.
because he knew the man’s face would break into a wide smile for just a moment when he saw the doctor approaching. He continued to force Sherlock to eat and sleep. Only once more did Sherlock tried to pull the “transport” argument with him, and John cocked his eyebrow and fixed him with such a look that the detective’s mouth had snapped shut mid-sentence and he’d flushed so pink that he seemed to be nearly glowing.
He could feel the flush all the way back where his fingers were twisted in Sherlock’s curls. The man still managed to look mortified even though he’d just had John’s bloody tongue on his mouth. John had never seen a more enticing image.
They arrived at the address Lestrade had provided and Sherlock practically flew from the car like some bat creature, leaving John to pay as per usual. When he finally caught up, Sherlock was already hunched over one of the bodies.
Sherlock solved the case they’d investigated that night, and countless others in the coming months. John accompanied him for nearly all of them, and their friendship felt stronger than ever. Somehow, John felt like Sherlock was grateful for John’s reaction to The Incident. By ribbing him about it like a normal bloke, he’d kept the situation from becoming a point of tension in their relationship. It even seemed to make Sherlock act like a better friend towards John. He bought milk every once in a while, He slowed his pace to match the smaller man’s as they strode towards crime scenes. Sometimes he would wake John gently with a hand on his shoulder when John fell asleep on the couch during late nights full of pressure and research. He would tell John, in a voice that John could only describe as tender, to go upstairs and get some sleep.
He inspected the cut and the rest of Sherlock’s exposed torso to be sure there were no other injuries the man was withholding form him, eyes skimming appraisinly over the pale skin. Sherlock shifted, tense under the doctor’s wandering hands and eyes.
Now that the initial concern over the injury had gone, John couldn’t help wondered how many people had been this close to Sherlock before. The man, whether it was an act or not, always seemed to confident and sure of himself, but right now seemed about ready to jump out of his skin, the tension evident in the lines of his body. Yet he didn’t writhe out of John’s grasp like a sullen child, as John had half-expected, but sat very still and allowed his doctor to work, although the slight frown on his face clearly expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrangement.
At the comic display of terror, something snapped inside of John, and everything was suddenly intensely hilarious. He slapped a hand over his grinning mouth and turned his back to the people near him, who were beginning to eye him in confusion. “Sorry,” He choked. “Just remembering, uh – something that came up earlier…”
and carried them into the bathroom, holding them out in front of him the way a bachelor might handle a dirty diaper. He found an empty cage sitting in the bathtub with a small door on its side pried a few inches open. He deposited the amorous rodents inside and snapped the door securely shut. He dug a safety pin out of the drawer and secured it to the door as an added measure.
“Would you really be okay just pretending this never happened? If you wanted something—“ Sherlock’s eyes jumped up to meet his own, bright and sharp and blue. “If you wanted something,” John repeated, “You’d be fine to just ignore that and pretend like it didn’t matter? Like it didn’t matter that you wanted it?”
He glanced up to take in his friend’s expression again. Sherlock stared straight ahead, but John could tell he was aware of the doctor’s every move the way a nervous dog keeps a threat in its peripherals. John could clearly see a flush spread from his sharp cheekbones down his long, exposed neck.
“You know, I’ve wondered,” John continued, enjoying himself immensely, “why you decided to be in the living room that day instead of your bedroom… Did you want me to find you?”
“I swear to god they had rehearsed or something.” John shook his head, a little breathless. “I thought I was in a Monty Python sketch.”
“What do you expect me to feel like?” John demanded. “I find the photograph—“ Sherlock recoiled as if word had been a physical blow, embarrassment plain on his face as he dropped his eyes from John’s again, “—and it makes me think that you –“ He huffed in frustration, unable to string together the thoughts that crowded his mind. “And then you just want to act like nothing happened? Like it doesn’t mean
Spectacle over, John made tea and toast and cheerily dumped the rest of the biscuits into the trash. One little mouse was not going to ruin his day off. Hell, he was honestly surprised this was the first time he’d encountered a rodent, given Sherlock’s (nonexistant) cleaning habits and penchant for leaving organic matter lying about for hours on end.
John sighed and learned back in his chair. Food went a long way in mending bridges in John’s book. “Thanks for the dinner,” he yawned, stretching out a bit more. “Almost makes up for having to dig a mouse out of your sock index.”
John mentally kicked himself for not being there. He’d had to work, yes, but Sherlock was just so much better off if he had backup going into these situations.  If nothing else, he needed someone to attempt to reign him in and then patch him up when he inevitably refused to listen.
John’s anger was quickly joined by suspicion; a combination of emotions so linked to his relationship with Sherlock that John had considered inventing a name for it.
Sherlock paused in his typing to bestow upon John a small, irritated frown. As if he hadn’t the faintest idea of what the man was going on about. John held his gaze, feeling like a snake coiled and ready to strike. After a moment, Sherlock turned his attention back to the computer, the usual mask of indifference sliding back into place. “Ignoring it,” He stated, sounding bored.
John looked up to see Sherlock’s face pale. He could feel the man’s eyes rapidly searching his own face, trying to deduce what he was thinking. John wasn’t sure what he was thinking or even what expression he was wearing. He was too confused.
He felt Sherlock’s mouth open against his in another huff of startled breath and he took the opportunity to plunge his tongue inside the other man’s mouth, exploring, conquering. Sherlock tasted like tea and faintly of cigarettes. It was lovely.
“You’ve thought about this,” John said, his voice lower and rougher than he’d expected. “You’ve done more than just
“Well, take your shirt off. You’re an idiot for not cleaning this out sooner.” It was too bad it had to be John’s favorite shirt of Sherlock’s. Wait, since when did he have a favorite shirt of Sherlock’s?
“Cheers.” John smiled up at him and received a tight nod in return. He sipped his tea and was surprised to find it good. Very good.
“Well, at least give them a proper meal, I don’t think I’ve seen them eat anything yet.” He pulled on his coat as he prepared to leave for work.
John felt giddy with relief. He also felt more connected to Sherlock in a strange way. Now they had this shared moment, this secret knowledge between them. John wondered if anyone else knew that Sherlock did, in fact, harbor passion, a sex drive, underneath his façade of cold, calculating reason.
He’d considered poking around Sherlock’s things while he was home alone, but he knew the detective would have been able to deduce that he’d done so.
“That’s really not necessary,” Sherlock replied in the clipped and formal way had of talking when he got uncomfortable.
more than a little shocking considering – just considering Sherlock. But if this had happened with any of John’s other mates, they would just have a laugh and move on as if it never happened.
The morning had begun dubiously. He’d accidentally stepped in one of Sherlock’s experiments and had had to change into a fresh pair of socks. John hated wasting socks. But on his way to work a cute barista had flirted with him, so he considered the morning a wash. Then a mix-up in the scheduling at work had allowed him to take off early, and John decided things were looking up after all. Having no desire to deal with the flu epidemic that seemed to be sweeping through half of London, he’d been pretty chuffed to get out of the hospital and head for home.
before?) and was very aware of how close he was to the man – practically caressing  him – and when had Shelock leaned in so close? There didn’t seem to be enough oxygen. There was a buzzing in his skin that exploded in the places where he was still touching the Sherlock, who was tense, but turning even more  now, or was John imagining that? He seemed to be shifting minutely towards John the way a flower tracks the sun. Time felt slow and John’s thoughts were thick, sluggish. All he knew was: it felt good. Very good. Lovely, in fact, maybe the best thing John had every felt.
Strapped quickly to the bed of black-and-white, Hudson sighed, the vile thoughts settling down into mere musings. As the needle pierces his skin, he thinks back again to his lovely wife, the beauty he left on Baker Street.
“Could we stop this little love fest, Lestrade?” Donovan sighed, grabbing Sherlock and putting him in handcuffs. “We do have a crime to stop, or have you forgotten?”
“You can’t take something back once it’s already done.” Sherlock said after a moment. “Even if you realise right away that it was wrong.”
Several weeks passed, and nobody could figure out what happened to Susan Marlowe. Students continued on with their lives, slowly feeling safe to roam about the castle again. Even Sherlock had given up the hunt, spending his hours in the library chatting with John, (much to the chagrin of Madam Pince.)
It’s about a half hour later when Sherlock heard the blond groan, watching his shifting go from confused to panicked when he discovered that he is tied up.
"Thank you, mummy. Father," He said, and though he didn't show it, Sherlock could tell that he was quite please. Mummy could tell as well, and she beamed brightly at him.
The last thing John Watson remembered was the hot, sunny desert of Afghanistan; the sounds of gunfire background noise to the shouts of commanding officers. He remembered the hot pierce of a bullet, his entire left shoulder feeling like it was on fire. The last thing John saw before the blackness enveloped him was the panicked face of Private Bill Murray, his lips moving frantically as he reassured John that he was going to be alright, that everything would be okay. That’s why when John woke up on a cold metal table in the middle of a sterile white room, he was more than a little confused.
“That was…” The blond appeared to be thinking of a word, and before Sherlock could suggest the more commonly used ‘freak’ or ‘psychopath’, he finished his thought. “Amazing.”
"Why did I target people who had flirted with you in particular?" Jim asks, a grin on his face. "Because it was fun, and it was proper motive. Anyone with eyes could see how Sherlock felt about you. It was the simplest way to frame him."
“It has only been a day that I’ve been gone, yet I’ve missed you every second of it.” Sheol said as he brushed the brown hair away from Otto’s brow. Otto sighed, leaning into the touch.
John continued his stroll towards him, and Sherlock debated on vanishing again. Of course, Sherlock needed to know why Greg had been talking to John, and vanishing would just upset him.
"If you need assistance, I would be more than happy to help," Sherlock cut him off quickly, hoping that he was pulling off his normal aloof expression and not the dopey eyed look he got when John happened to pass by him in the corridors.
The apprehensive look fell from Tom's face, and he grinned brightly at Sherlock, who scowled back. "Oh, thank goodness. No offense, Mr Holmes, but Molly's told me all about you."
Sherlock nodded, trying to squash the horrible feeling of his heart being crushed. John was never his, and he had been foolish to allow himself to entertain the possibility that he could be.
"Well, there are rumours going around that you have to test your bravery to gain access." Sherlock replied, ducking his head in embarrassment. "I am
“Thank you so much for your time…err…” The silver haired officer said, holding out his hand to shake.
"That I was already head-over-heels in love with you," John said, smiling ruefully. "Which sounds frankly ridiculous, seeing as I've known you less than twenty four hours. But you're a man of many talents, it seems."
Snagging a paint brush and a cup full of black paint from the art department had been easy. He had timed it well, so that the entire school would be dismissed as he was finishing up his masterpiece.
“Bad boy!” The handler scolded, though there wasn’t much heat in the words. “You will respect your new master, Sherlock, do you understand me?”
The sitting room was silent for a few seconds before Violet and Siger began to laugh. Sherlock chuckled along with them as John stared at them in bewildered astonishment.
“Only to an untrained mind.” Sherlock said, walking into my house just after me. “Ah, this must be your family!”
Sherlock had never felt like this before, this unknown terror and pure elation mixed together in a heady rush. He had only known John for a few hours, but he knew that he couldn't live without him.
“Quite. He’s rather brilliant.” Mycroft said, and if Sherlock didn’t know any better, he would say his brother admired the blond. “Of course, we need to assign him a master. His punishment for the crimes he has committed will be a lifetime of slavery.”
“Okay, we don’t do this a lot, so you should know that this is a huge deal.” Victor says before I can ask them what’s going on. He flicks a look at Sebastian, who picks up on the one sided conversation effortlessly. It’s like they planned it or something.
The day arrived, and John felt more alive than he ever had. He went about his daily routines, an extra skip in his step. The day passed quickly, and he soon found himself in his bedsit, a glass filled with clear liquid in one hand.
He found an empty compartment that faced the platform, and after hoisting his trunk into the rack, he thrust his arm out the window to wave frantically at his parents just as the train gave one last whistle.
"Sorry, I know you're about to be sorted, and everything, but I need to know how you did that thing...you know, on the train?"
"You're the first," John replied dryly. "How did you know I could understand you? You were the first person to actually address me."
“No, you do not get to bring our room into this.” Sherlock said, correctly guessing John’s failed argument.
“Well, you fell down, and were knocked unconscious. I brought you to Molly’s car, and now we’re heading to Yorkshire to meet my family.” Sherlock explained.
Sherlock waited all day, and a great deal of the night before deciding to return back to Baker Street. He had briefly considered not returning home at all, but he quickly reasoned that it would not be easier to return to an empty flat in the daylight versus at night.
“Ah, Sherlock, you’re awake.” Violet beamed at her son. “Do you know what I did with my large stockpot?”
Sherlock turned back to John, his heart pounding erratically, and he could no longer ignore his symptoms.
“Mummy!” Sherlock protested, but it was clear from the rumble of his father’s voice in the background that Violet was no longer listening to her son. The pair prattled on for about a minute, arguing quietly before Sherlock heard a rustle indicating a passed phone.
“Of course not.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “At least, not anymore. I don’t understand why you’re not getting to work, you’ve got a murder to solve.”
The news spreads through the school like wildfire. Rumours that students are getting pulled out of class to get questioned spreads from person to person, and by lunchtime everyone is restless.
Don't worry, I will go back and explain why Sherlock doesn't like Mycroft, and also what happens to souls when they aren't collected. Promise! I just needed to get a bit of John in here (so you don't hate me completely!)
“Of course you do.” The man looked confused, and he cocked his head to one side, accidently exposing a long column of neck…
“Actually, that sounds wonderful.” John said, looping an arm through Sherlock’s. “We’ll be back around lunchtime.”
“Obviously the collar is too tight.” His curly-haired master said, red tail whipping back and forth. “Couldn’t you loosen it?”
“I call the downstairs room.” John said, carrying his box and placing it in front of the door. His dad just laughed, spreading his arms wide in surrender.
“I don’t know.” John chuckled as he realised Sherlock’s last statement was meant to be a jest. “I’ve already had a lot of excitement over the past few days. Some mad genius kidnapped me from a coffee shop just two days ago...wow, was it really only two days ago?”
A variety of emotions flitted across Sherlock’s face: surprise, confusion, and several unidentifiable ones before a pleased expression dominated his features.
“No, brother!” Abel said, shaking his head furiously, placing a comforting hand on Cain’s shoulder. “I would never-”
“No. He was going to bring his arse of a boyfriend- oh gosh, I’m so sorry!” Molly covered her mouth, embarrassed that she had said a swear word in front of the police. “Anyway, Victor broke up with Sherlock that very afternoon, so he went by himself.”
“So,” John began, plopping down and grabbing a cookie, taking a large bite. “We each need to write a Christmas list.”
It was at that moment a door rattled, John turned towards the sound, surprised to see the side door swinging open. He watched for a moment, beaming when Sherlock popped through.
“Er…hello, you must be the…ah…doctors?” John asked, his voice rough from disuse. He cleared his throat as he looked at the people garbed in long robes, each a different colour. They were all tall and pale, dark hair cascading from their heads. High cheekbones and strong jaw’s suggested that they all had a common family member, though John wasn’t positive that they
John’s head was pounding as he woke up, and he groaned, burying his face in his pillow as if it would lessen the pain. Something pressed at his throat, and he lifted his hand, tugging at the leather strapped there.
“They’ve been going out on and off for about a year.” Sebastian says. “Sherlock broke up with Victor for no good reason a couple of weeks ago.”
“I shall consider you my soul-mate even if I pass on.” He said, leaning forward to press his lips to Sheol’s.
John stared at himself in the mirror, a smirk flitting across his face as he came up with a plan. He turned, opening the door quickly, causing Sherlock to stumble slightly. John held up the phone, wiggling it in between his fingers.
"I don't believe you would do it either," Lestrade shook his head, "But with the overwhelming evidence already against you, I have to take you in."
Sherlock didn't respond, choosing instead to inspect the flat. John rolled his eyes and continued in his task, only finishing when the tub was sparkling.
Jim and Irene then looked to Sherlock expectantly, and Sherlock raised an eyebrow at them, debating on whether he planned to answer. Molly cleared her throat pointedly, and Sherlock gave a heaving sigh before raising his hand as well.
John worked to mask his smile as he watched his dad, who nodded sadly. “You’re right, as always. I don’t know what I would do without you.”
"Thank you, Victor, dear." Mummy said, patting her hair as she sat next to father.  "It was no trouble at all. It's nice to be able to cook for more people. Maybe next year Anthea will be here?"
“Yeah yeah,” The officer sighs, turning from us. “Get out of here before you’re escorted off the property.”
“Sherlock! John! So fantastic to see you.” Victor crows, placing an arm around my shoulders. Victor is a football star, unsurprisingly, and his cleats only serve to make him taller.
"A bit soon to be meeting your parents, isn't it?" John joked weakly, earning another laugh from The Shining One.
"You should let your hair grow out," John commented, watching him. "You'd look good with curls. The women would love it."
Victor snorts, and it’s obvious that he believes me. “Ugh, those two. They’re so weird. But they’re not important right now. Remember, we have practice for the talent show later on at my house. You’re coming, right?”
Sherlock’s smirk widened, and John watched as his blue eyes swirled into a terrifying black, eclipsing the whites of his eyes. John’s breathe caught in this throat, and in his attempted to escape, he fell backwards against the bed. The black eyed demon leaned over him once more, his grin looking wickeder than it had a few seconds earlier.
“Yeah, and I’ve invited you to the earlier ones too, and you never came to those.” John rolled his eyes.
"I told him a small party," I yell back. "I think he would have invited every school in London, otherwise."
Of course, all his good luck would inevitably come to an end. Sure enough, by the next day, he had received a summons from the heavenly council. The waiting room was stark white, and Sherlock pulled his dark grey coat around himself, feeling ridiculously out of place.
“I believe I must thank you for the same thing.” Sherlock said. “This Christmas would be unbearable without you here.”
The most hideous jumper that Sherlock had ever seen tumbled out of the wrappings. It was a deep blue, with some terrible red and white pattern round the collar and sleeves that completed the terrible ensemble. He opened his mouth to complain to his mother when John spoke up.
“I am up here, Cain.” Sheol chuckles, and Cain looks up both startled and relieved. “You are acting as if I had ran away.”
A/N: Thank you so much for your amazing patience as I continue to be the worst author ever. You are all such lovely people, and you deserve daily updates, truly you do. Next chapter: More John!
John came down less than ten minutes later, a button up that belonged to Father looked dashing on his short frame. In one hand he held a blanket, and in the other was Sherlock’s violin.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, his words faltering at the look on John's face. Instead of anger or disgust, he saw something akin to awe.
"Oh god, what has she done now?" John groaned, making his way to his bed and sitting down, the springs squeaking in protest. "Drank all her money away? Are you part of a...a gang or something?"
Apparently, this was the wrong thing to say. John stared at Sherlock for a full thirty seconds, his mouth opening and closing like a fish on land.
“So? He still liked you.” Mary clucked her tongue. “Ah well, I was hoping I would get to date John before you realised you two were meant to be together.”
If John hadn’t been so annoyed, the sight of a ghost jumping in shock might have been hilarious. The ghost stared wide-eyed at him in shock, his book falling out of his hands and flopping onto the floor.
“I told you that he’s hilarious.” Sherlock said, placing a hand on John’s shoulder, one that was promptly brushed off. “He does this all the time.”
Of course, it was always important to pay attention all the time, a fact John had to apparently learn the hard way. With his nose buried in his map, he didn’t notice the other person in front of him until it was far too late. He collided with a boy slightly taller than himself, sending them both sprawling to the floor.
They were led to a smaller room just off The Great Hall, filing in slowly. It was at that point that Sherlock heard someone whispering his name.
“That is for another time.” Sherlock smiled sadly. “We shall meet again, John, but not for a long time. Go home, and rest. You deserve it.”
“Oh, come here.” John said, turning towards Sherlock and grabbing the front of his suit coat, tugging him closer. “I know you aren’t fond of displays of affection, but a kiss in front of your family won’t hurt.”
“Would you like me to assign someone to pop your cherry?” He continues, and I am even more confused. Is he offering to buy me a dessert? I’m not fond of cherries, but I would happily eat something pear flavoured. As I open my mouth to tell him this, another voice interrupts.
"I am in need of a human blood donor," Sherlock said. "You would be required to live with me, and feed me when I need it."
“Of course, dear.” Mrs Hudson giggled, patting David on the arm. “I’ll be downstairs if you need anything.”
He watched with horror as John stooped down to help a friend, exposing himself to the gunfire. Before he could even move, John was on the ground, a spot of red spreading across his shoulder.
Sherlock paused, clearly choosing his words carefully before responding. “Your soul will not be destroyed, however, you will not be allowed to leave my realm.”
"Oh, of course not." Jim waves a hand. "Not yet at least. I need some sort of leverage over Sherlock Holmes, and you're the perfect candidate!"
He watched as John said something in her ear, making her giggle. She hit his chest playfully, before standing up and excusing herself.
care about you, you know.” Sherlock said, trying to sound as disgusted as possible. “Also, you never know what will be good for blackmail.”
“Me.” Another doctor swept in, his robes a lovely purple. His hair was curly, not unlike the other doctors, but his eyes made him stand out. While the other ‘doctors’ had average blue eyes, this man had shining blue-green. They were like small galaxies, colours constantly changing and shifting. The other ‘doctors’ seemed to hold this one in great respect, and they hastily backed away from him, heads bent low in what appeared to be reverence. “Homo sapiens, goes by the name of John Watson. He is a medical doctor on earth, intelligent among his race, and considerably brave. I have been watching him for a long time.”
Violet grabbed a stack of books, shuffling through them until she came upon a black and white and green one. “Here we are!”
“Martha?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. David said nothing, but John could detect a hint of red on his cheeks before he answered gruffly.
“Is everything okay?” I ask, jogging up to them. The police officer makes a face, clearly annoyed that there are now two of us. “What happened?”
And he does. Little Cain looks up to Sheol as a friend and brother. Sheol finds joy in Cain, and later Abel, and he believes that they shall live forever in peace and joy.
"You were an army doctor," He said without preamble. The words caused John to freeze in place, and he turned to look at Sherlock.
"Idiot," Sherlock sighed, his eyes falling upon his coat, the scarf still wrapped around the collar. "Did he not pay attention to anything Molly had said?"
All in all, it was a tedious affair that Sherlock couldn't wait to be over. He figured that his family wouldn't be bothered to attend, so when he saw his parents and Mycroft coming towards him, he was shocked.
“You two go out and have fun today,” was the first thing Violet said as soon as Sherlock and John walked into the kitchen.
"I suppose I do look a bit like him," Sherlock mused. "Molly has a type. Tall, dark hair, and high cheekbones. There's a Detective Inspector I think I need to introduce her to..."
normally put the angel on the top of the tree.” Sherlock’s voice said from behind him, and John turned to look, catching a brief glimpse of annoyance before his face went blank.
I look over Sherlock’s shoulder, trying to figure out what he’s doing. Apparently Facebook is a valuable tool for solving murders.
“Of course, Father.” Sherlock replied dully, his distaste for the interview showing through his voice.
“I’m not a psychopath, Stamford, I’m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.” A cold voice says from behind me. I watch Mike wince before I turn around to see the owner of the voice. He’s tall, with pale skin and dark curls. What really catches my attention is his eyes. They’re an impossible shade of blue, or possibly green.
"Holmes?" Watson asked, panting slightly. "You're the last person I expected. What are you doing following me?"
Father sighed, and Sherlock gritted his teeth against the sound of pure disappointment. He assumed he would have been used to the sound by now, but it still put him on edge.
It didn't take John long to walk to his new school, and he tried to relax as he saw other students arriving as well. He was early, but apparently he wasn't the only one.
As soon as they hit sunlight, they scatter, making their way towards their own homes. Sherlock is left on the sidewalk, feeling unbearably lonely. It’s ridiculous, as he’s no more alone than he was three days before, but the sudden realisation of it all hit him like a truck.
Of course, Sherlock found the attacks nothing but amusing. He had refused to own a slave his entire life, sending away the most professional men and women away with but a glance. It had been a strain on his mother and father, both of whom were convinced that Sherlock could not live on his own. None of their begging and pleading would sway his mind. It proved beneficial in the end.
“Er…that’s true.” I say slowly. “I mean, its fine. He’s probably just likes to gossip. But I’m not mad at him or anything.”
me?” Sherlock choked, setting down the coffee cup at long last, the customer who it belonged to grabbing it and grumbling about poor service. “Are you…are you breaking up with me?”
“Obviously. Now stop this nonsense at once.” Sherlock snapped, vanishing before John could say anything else.
Thank you so much for your endless patience as I worked on my second chapter. I want to thank QuinnAnderson for the marvelous review on fuckyeahteenlock. It was so wonderful, and it completely made my day/week/month.
“Really, Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice made Sherlock jump, and both boys turned to look at the boy who was fifteen sun cycles old. “I didn’t realise that you enjoyed such…trivialities.”
The first attempt at suicide had been real, of course. It had been the second time Sherlock had gotten to talk to John, and Sherlock had relished every moment of it, assuming the next time he saw John would be at his final death.
The doors opened just seconds later, and waves of people crowded into the tiny space, pressing themselves up against the glass so they could see John better. Sherlock found himself shunted off to the side unceremoniously.
Ten years ago today, 'Mean Girls' was released in theaters! So, to celebrate, I decided to not only update this fic, but also post a one-shot. It's Sherlock's perspective of the Halloween party! Happy 'Mean Girls' day, everyone!
"Well, I was sorta hoping that you'll come," John said, suddenly bashful. "I mean, I know we're playing Ravenclaw, and so you'll want to cheer for them. I just want all my friends to be there."
“Don’t be silly, David.” Ann said, though she knew her husband couldn’t hear her. “Of course you made the right decision. Who on earth did you think left those real estate pamphlets on your desk?”
The best crimes are committed when everyone is distracted. It was during the Quidditch game that third year Slytherin Susan Marlowe vanished, leaving no trace of where she had gone.
“I’m-” John asked, wincing as he patted his shoulder. He pulled a hand away, looking at the blood. “I was shot.”
No one was entirely sure why dragons kept humans around after they won the war. Human’s, though edible, were not a dragon’s ideal choice in meat. Humans were slower than dragons, and hardly strong enough to be a means of free labour, even though that’s what they were normally used for. Each dragon was given a human as a slave at a young age. Most dragons kept the same slave over the course of the human’s lifetimes; the more slaves they employed, the more prosperous they were. Though dragons lived longer than humans, a majority of them didn’t go through more than three or four main slaves. Sherlock Holmes was not one of those dragons.
It was only going to be a gentle brush of lips, but as soon as John tasted, he couldn’t get enough. He swooped in immediately, swallowing Sherlock’s gasp.
"I don't know why you insisted we attend this, John," Sherlock said, his right hand laced in John's left. "It's an event for people to pretend that they're doing better than everyone else, and to lie about their accomplishments."
"Of course." Angelo clapped a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "This man, he got me out of a murder charge."
“Human-” John began before being choked by the metal collar digging to his neck as Sherlock walked away. He followed with an angry sound, silently plotting the best way to kill Sherlock and Mycroft.
“Well, there is a Renaissance artist coming that I am sure you’ll be fond of.” Greg smiled, looking positively mischievous.
“Anderson. If you need to get a hold of me, all you have to do is call the Met and ask for Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
"Yes," John replied. "You saved me, and I don't believe you'll find yourself among friends if you return. Right now at least."
ask for, if Santa Claus could perform miracles. Then, he wondered if he should admit what he wanted aloud.
Finding Victor is easy as his early morning routine is always the same. I find him camped out in the nicest boy’s lavatory. He’s brushing away at his brown hair, trying to make it stick up the way he wants. I hold out the bottle of foot crème to him, and he shoots me a surprised look.
I open my mouth to apologise, but I'm stopped by a heavily intoxicated bloke, who proceeds to use me as a full body support.
“Yours?” John frowned, keeping an eye on the dark haired man circling him. “I don’t belong to you. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to go home.”
John hung up, grinning over at Sherlock. "He was checking up on me, making sure everything was going alright."
John stood off the chair he had been occupying, following Siger into his and Violet’s bedroom. Siger’s clothes fit, and John thanked every deity that he owned several jumpers. He tugged on a striped one and a pair of jeans, then went to meet Siger in the sitting room where Sherlock was waiting, a sour look on his face.
“I didn’t have any green, so I had to borrow something.” I say quickly, trying to look unaffected. It’s really quite mortifying, though.
“So it is true.” Sherlock hummed. “I assumed it was just over dramatization.  You also saved dragons, did you not?”
"Piss off," Sherlock answered. "Though I don't know if that's to my deductions, or to my being a demon."
With his parting words, Sherlock vanished. If he had asked anyone what happened after he left, he would have been told of how John Watson looked for him, asked every officer if they had seen the pale man in the long coat. They would have explained how John tried to find him, even as they dragged him in for surgery; how, as the weeks dragged by, John convinced himself that he imagined the handsome man in the desert.
"Of course," Sherlock repeated, the oddest feeling in the pit of his stomach. Usually cases sent a thrill of adrenaline rushing through his system, but now Sherlock couldn't be less interested.
“He’s killed people, Molly.” Sherlock reminded her, and she frowned down at her paperwork. “That means that he
"I do believe your people have named him 'God'," Sherlock breathed, and John's mouth gaped open. "No need to worry, John. He is our father."
“Oh, well done.” Violet clapped, and John took a bow, much to the amusement of Siger and Violet, and the annoyance of Sherlock.
"You've rather shown your hand there, little human," Moriarty chuckled as John flipped over to glare at him, blocking Sherlock from Moriarty's line of sight with his body. "As adorable as this is, I have to be going. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes."
“Second hand store.” I tell him, looking down at my multi-coloured jumper. “In London. My mum bought it for me as a ‘first day of school’ gift.”
?" Sherlock asked as Jim walked away. "That Sebastian is dangerous, and you flirting with his boyfriend is not helping matters."
The lady's entire demeanour changed, and she beamed happily up at him. "I'm Mrs Hudson, the landlady. Oh, I've been telling that boy for years that he needs someone to take care of him, and here you are!"
The Wall had been freshly painted for the summer, the blank expanse still a surprising sight, even though they hadn't seen it in 10 years. But there was already something written on the wall, a stark black sentence in John's familiar handwriting:
Thank you to everyone who has read the story up to here. I've been typing furiously away at chapter 3, which is looking like it will be twice or three times the size of this chapter. You are all marvellous, and I would hug each and everyone one of you if you lived closer to me, and you wouldn't find it so creepy.
He had to wait until the planet was facing the right direction, and Sherlock had never been very patient. When it finally showed the familiar little island, he scoured the area, letting out a cry of joy when he saw the familiar house.
John realised as he arrived, however, that he had no idea which flat was Sherlock's. They had only made it as far as the entry before John had left.
"You did plenty of that when we first started dating," Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he was unable to keep a pleased smile from tugging at his lips.
Less than five minutes later, McGonagall returned for them. She led them out of the room and into The Great Hall.
The top bunk was silent for a moment, and Sherlock wondered briefly if John had given up when he heard the tell-tale squeak of springs. Sure enough, he could see John’s foot emerge, climbing down the worn wood of the ladder.
"John..." Sherlock stepped closer to him, not even giving the kettle a passing glance as it began to whistle shrilly.
“Thank you, but we didn’t ask for your opinion.” Mycroft bit back, shooting the officer a cold glare. The guard rolled his eyes as the Holmes’ filed out slowly, making their way to the entrance of New Scotland Yard.
“I have many names. I am an arc-angel, beloved by The Shining One.” The angel’s smile softened lightly. “But you may call me Mycroft.”
He didn’t care if John turned out to be dumb, he realised as he fell asleep. John could be the dumbest creature in the whole world, but Sherlock would protect him, because John was special.
"With high cheekbones and curly dark hair," John added, looking slightly miserable. "That's what Mike told me at least."
I always wanted a fic where the humans were the slaves instead of the dragons, so here you are! (Hmm, seriously debating on continuing this one. What do you think? Yea or nay?)
“The ‘K’ comes from Kublai Khan, one of your most interesting adversaries. I don’t believe I’ve ever met someone so unwilling to die. The ‘R’ is for Raphael, the Renaissance painter.” Greg replied easily. “Simple enough for anyone that knows you. Now why this man?”
“Food always helps me think.” I offer helpfully. “Maybe we can think at my house? Mum made chocolate chip cookies yesterday.”
Jim moves quickly, and before either Sherlock or I have time to react, he's pulled out a gun, pointing it at me with casual ease.
John gave a few last hiccupping gasps and pulled away, embarrassed at completely losing his mental balance. Much to his horror, he found he couldn’t pull away completely and allowed his hands to remain loosely wrapped around Sherlock.
“I simply let it be known to a select few individuals that I was in need of a flatmate. Stamford is a doctor; it was likely that he would make mention of this to another doctor or medical professional, someone whose insight would be beneficial to The Work. I also mentioned it to Lestrade who would likely pass this information on to another investigator or someone else involved in criminal apprehension, someone whose perspective could benefit The Work. These are professions that generally call for above average intelligence, Anderson aside, and naturally select for logical people with solid deductive reasoning skills, again Anderson aside. After dropping my hints, I readied myself to wait. And then Stamford brought me you.”
Sherlock ignored him. John took a seat at the table next to Lestrade. He was a bit surprised to see Sally Donovan there until he remembered that she was on track to make DI herself soon. Mycroft took a seat at the head of the conference table while Sherlock eschewed a seat to stand next to the projection screen and began to speak.
“John? John! Don’t hang up,” Lestrade demanded, clearly agitated. “I need you down here immediately. It’s an emergency.”
“Very well,” Mycroft conceded. “I am either about to cost the NHS thousands of pounds in therapy or save it the same amount, and I really have no idea which it is,” he said as he crossed his arms and studied John intently. “You’re in love with Sherlock,” Mycroft said at last. He gazed steadily at Dr. John Watson and waited for the explosion. He didn’t have long to wait. Three…two…one…
“Yeah, … I began to suspect a couple of days after you uhmmm… fingered my arse that first time. I figured you must have gotten the idea that I was open to it from my private blog. Either that or you read me way too well. I was never quite certain of that one until you admitted it just now. I know you can pretty much beat any password or security I install on my laptop, so I always knew you could do it; I was just never sure if you would do it.”
Curiosity piqued, John stood up and quietly padded into the lounge where he found Sherlock had just finished lacing up his Oxfords.
John stopped walking as Mycroft’s words sunk in, his breathing becoming short and harsh, as if he had just been punched low and hard in the gut. Mycroft had been far more blunt about it, but both Sarah and Maya had essentially said the same thing to him. He had laughed it off at the time.
“She asked what she could do,” Clara sobbed openly now, pressing her damp face against her brother-in-law’s sodden shoulder. “And I told her I didn’t care…that I didn’t fucking care if she lived or died. I left her like that. My last words to her,” Clara said softly as she sat back and sniffled, rubbing the now soaked tissue over her face.
“As you are aware, the first two bodies were discovered at #11 Privet Drive on September 19th of this year.” The projector hummed and pictures of the first two victims flashed on the screen. “Both victims were found with their wrists and ankles bound in rope, the killer having used double constrictor knots with a slipped bight; this knot is also referred to as the torture knot. The more the victim struggles, the tighter it binds. The fingers, hands and other nerve rich areas of the body were repeatedly sliced by a sharp thin object like a surgical scalpel or a razor blade. Nerve clusters around the body had been repeatedly pierced by a sharp, long, thin object, likely a finishing nail to cause maximum pain with minimal physical damage. The torture wrought was extensive. When the killer finished, he surgically removed the face of the female victim, also likely with a scalpel. At the time, NSY believed the killer may have heard something or was otherwise interrupted before he could remove the face of the male victim.”
“I know. Mycroft sort of told me. I’m a grown man, Sherlock; I went into this with my eyes wide open. I’m not so easily duped as you think.”
“Yes, your schedule would be somewhat flexible, as much as I can make it, enabling you to continue working with Sherlock most of the time. In an emergency, a car or helicopter can pick you up just as easily from a crime scene as from the government center. Dr. Watson, you keep Sherlock from completely going off the rails. Don’t think I don’t know that or that I do not appreciate it. I will do all I can to ensure that continues.”
“I’ve disappointed you,” Sherlock said softly, sighing as he got up to leave. “Please try not to be angry, John.” Sherlock hesitated at the door wishing the right words to come to smooth this over.
A lump formed in John’s throat. He wanted to maintain his earlier frustration with Sherlock, but the man could be so inadvertently thoughtful sometimes.
“Two prostitutes,” Sherlock clarified in a bored tone. “More efficient that way. Weren’t you listening? Do try to keep up, Watson.”
It took no more than a misplaced box and a few seconds of inattentiveness for John to find himself on top of the consulting detective. The situation was both awkward and hilarious. His poor colleague was only trying to get from the sofa to the dining table and got crushed in the process.
"The thing about sleeping being boring and unnecessary is bullshit. We weren't even halfway through the film and you were gone." he chuckled, bringing a faint tint to Sherlock's cheeks. He glanced into John's eyes, relieved see them shining from happiness instead of tears.
And in the moment that would've made Sherlock's 'delusional fantasies' reality, his phone sounded with a loud text alert noise, breaking them apart. John looked at him like a deer in headlights, and the detective's gaze must've been something similar. How he hated Mycroft in that moment... but deep down somewhere, he was grateful. If they actually kissed, there was no guarantee one or both of them wouldn't regret it later. Sherlock for losing control over his actions, and John for letting him.
Wednesday, the 14th of September, 2011. Sherlock Holmes realised the true nature of his feelings towards Dr. John Watson.
Sherlock's eyes popped open at the word. The living room really was illuminated by the first rays of the morning sun.
The doctor didn't seem particularly pleased with the request. "You dick." he muttered, taking a seat on the couch. "But I choose the channel. You, shut up and don't spoil the ending." Sherlock sat next to him with a victorious smirk. He had never looked forward to cheap nighttime television so much.
As he was thinking John and kisses, he got reminded of the text surely sent by his brother. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, and opened it right away.
The detective rolled his eyes. "I'm alert even if I don't sleep. Sleeping is boring anyway, it's only you lot who find no other way to escape your problems who do it regularly. Besides, what good can seven hours do?" John gave him that puzzled, mate-you-really-are-an-alien look again.
Dr. Watson opened his mouth to answer, but no sound seemed to be coming out of it. The anger from earlier was all gone now, or at least, his flatmate dared to hope. The brave army doctor had fallen in a battle far too large for him to fight. He hid his face behind his hands, sighing. "Yes." he answered, his voice shaking as he spoke. Sherlock walked closer to him, carefully laying a hand on his shoulder.
"Sherlock, that's all very beautiful. And quite frankly, a bit nauseating. But you do remember why you are leaving, don't you?" It would have been hard not to. That was all he could think about, the one chance he got to stop Moriarty forever, before he ruins more lives. His own crumbling to pieces was more than enough.
A knock sounded at the door, dissolving the magic and warmth of the moment. Sherlock stepped away and turned back, the doorframe soon revealing his older brother in a pinstripe suit.
" It was now or never. The detective gathered some courage, took a deep breath, and stepped out from his hiding place. He knew exactly what to say.
John took his chances, and closed the distance between them with a soft press of lips. His arms snaked around the taller man's waist, trying to pull him closer and back into reality at the same time. He yearned for a response. Any reaction would've done it. But in a world of ordinary humans, he chose a marble statue to kiss. John felt the bitter taste of defeat in his mouth as he pulled away, arms letting go slowly. He misinterpreted it all along. There was nothing romantic behind his actions. Of course not. The man was Sherlock Holmes, he felt no such thing as love towards anyone but his own intellect.
. No, kissing John Watson was not an option. Could never be an option. Even though he was right there, gaze expectant, and it would have been so easy, it was out of question. Sherlock had his work as the one lover he would ever need, and John... well, John was straight. At the very least he claimed to be.
, he nearly shouted at him. One of them had to break the silence before Sherlock lost his mind and did something impulsive. Like... perhaps...
"To those. To us." John shook his hand strongly, nearly taking Sherlock's attention away from the sadness in his eyes. "Goodbye, Sherlock."
"You should have known I rarely do as you say." Sherlock rolled his eyes. "He spoke to me, Mycroft. He's not a born poet, you just have to read his blog to know that, but he's sincere. He might just be the only person who believes me. It might do him better if he never knows I'm alive, and there's always the risk of him letting the cat out of the bag, but I can't do it." That was the first time he'd actually admitted all that to himself, let alone to somebody else. Caring is not an advantage, his brother's words echoed in his brain. But no matter how much he wanted otherwise, he couldn't not care about
"Well, you sure as hell surprised me!" he shook his head with a grin, cupping Sherlock's cheeks softly. "But you don't need that thing on you. I was in the army, remember? I've seen worse." The younger man seemed surprised, but obliged. Luckily, John concluded as he glanced down, his chest was clear of any scars.
, he guessed, glancing at him. When he argued with Mycroft, they settled with simple but thorough insults in order to talk as little as humanly possible. John shook his head with a smirk at the thought, and turned back to his screen, now signalling the low battery percentage. And of course, the charger was all the way across the room, laying at the detective's feet.
"And I'm guessing 'Holy sheet' won't be an appropriate way to start." he said almost immediately, nonchalant eyes fixed on the screen. So it seems his attire made a deep impression on John. Sherlock walked behind him with a smile of surrender, and looked at the blank post draft on the screen.
He sat up at an alarming velocity, finding himself next to his flatmate, lying on his back, hair disheveled and grinning at him.
The detective took a long stride closer. "London air traffic is horrendous this time of the year. I definitely don't recommend it. Plus people give you those weirded-out looks in the parking lot... We've got to stick with cabs." he smirked, going along with the game.
he beamed mentally. But his blush was nothing compared to the one the next sentence brought to him. "You're very... clingy in your sleep, you know that?"
"Unless someone asks me for one last miracle." he hinted at John's speech, the kindest smile he could muster on his face.
The detective got lost in thought, memories of cases past clouding his mind and his attention wandered away from the conversation. Next thing he knew, John was starting to have enough of Mycroft. "What, the dead man walking? That's the single most distasteful joke you could make, really." Joke? Mycroft Holmes joking? Sherlock wondered for a second if he really had died and all that happened was a vision.
"Oh, shut up!" John laughed, rolling his eyes. "Is it over now? I mean, this whole Moriarty-fiasco."
"I'm gonna kill you one day." he muttered, standing up at last. The consulting detective wondered: why did he stay lying so long? The position was surely not so comfortable. Then why? An undecipherable mystery, that man, and he hated him for it. Loathed the feeling of something being right in front of his nose that he couldn't figure out.
"You know how." he responded, hoping the detective didn't delete the information over the years. "First, it's Sherlock Holmes in a grocery store, now in the kitchen... I could get used to this." John admitted with a smile. "Would it be ridiculous of me to ask you to clean up after yourself once in a fortnight?" he went on.
That day was oddly cold for June, the skies above gray as John got out of the cab. Sherlock had experimental business to do at Bart's, and the doctor decided to tag along. Even watching his madman flatmate whip a corpse would've been more amusing than the crap that was bound to be on the telly that day.
"But theological references are rather odd, even from you." The mention of theology caught him off-guard. The dead man walking. The Lazarus plan. Mycroft was talking about
. His heart was hammering in his throat as John's hands slid to his lapels, carefully tugging on them to pull him even lower.
come back?" she asked with her voice slightly raised, hands on her hips. She reminded him of his mother, standing like that. Mrs. Holmes took a similar position when scolding her children for misbehaviour.
John, head resting in his palm, laughed, still not believing what he heard. "So he shot himself? Just like that?"
By now, you must've figured out what the title "Waterfalls" symbolises. The tears of both the main characters and the readers. So sorry, guys, please stay with me for one more chapter~ m(_ _)m
He pulled away, and was about to start another shorter speech leading up to the three words he never thought he'd say, when John spoke before he could. "I've seen war before. Blood, death and suffering with every step. I don't wish for anyone to go through it. And here you are, willing to go and fight a bloody psychopath's bloody minions all around the world. You never cease to amaze me, Sherlock Holmes." he smiled, finally taking his gaze off his shoes and looking at him. His praise awoke some of those damn feelings of fondness in his chest, accelerating his heartbeat. God, how he hoped he didn't blush again. "I can't say anything new, it would be easier if you hadn't overheard me before, you bastard..." he muttered, making Sherlock laugh shortly. "Come back in one piece, will you? There are plenty of criminals here in London who are waiting for you to catch them. And... I'm here too. You better not forget me while you're away."
That April was miserably cold and wet. Not a day went by without a colourful display of umbrellas on the streets of London. John watched two raindrops slide down the bus window, rooting for the slower one to catch up, and win. Life had been incredibly slow in the past two years. Though, with his regular messages, it felt like Sherlock never left, he was always disappointed not to find him in their living room, experimenting, composing or dragging him with him the moment he entered to investigate a case.
"What's the jump got to do with anything?" The question was the last straw. He had to tell him, there was no other choice. He practically already did anyway.
He missed him. Terribly. Read and re-read all their conversations, always expecting for something new to appear. But there were no messages in a month, since his flatmate arrived to Serbia. To be fair, he
"No, no, I just... I missed this." he muttered. "Missed... seeing you. Like, in the flesh, not just in dreams and hallucinations." He got so quiet John could barely understand him by the end.
When Sherlock's breathing started to even out, he brought a hand up to his hair, twirling his locks around his finger and letting go. He got so lost in the game he didn't notice two pale and very awake eyes watching him.
, and the ever ironic situation. He was always in need of something when Sherlock's in his mind palace, and away somewhere when Sherlock wanted him by his side the most.
How do you say goodbye when all you want is to stay? How do you stay strong when your heart is shattering into pieces? And how do you vow to survive when the road you're about to set foot on is paved with certain death at any second? Sherlock Holmes is still looking for answers. But is he ever going to find them?
"God, I wish it was. The cat might be dead, but that means the mice are still running free, John. He has an entire, spiderweb-like network still active, and it's only a matter of time before somebody takes over. It has to be dismantled. And that's exactly what I'm about to do." he explained his situation carefully, secretly hoping for some praise like the words he always got.
!" He intended to greet him cheerfully, but the two words left his lips faster than he could register them. The sneer echoed in the laboratory, making John shiver. And yet, Sherlock gave him a half-smile. Molly didn't bat an eye. As if nobody heard what he actually said.
"I didn't want to come back at first. I didn't want you or Mrs. Hudson accidentally giving away that I'm still alive. But as I hid in the dark, in an abandoned cellar, I thought about what you've endured before. War, injury... That's when realised you don't deserve to be put through tragic loss more than you already have been." Sherlock's stomach sunk as he spoke, eventually not even daring to look at the man sitting in front of him. The man who saved him. The man he loved. The man he lied to and hurt, more than he could say.
"One would think you just had to look at a computer screen for that. You know, since you have our- ...the flat under surveillance."
"Perhaps coming here wasn't a good idea after all..." he muttered, defeated. "John, I'm so-" he couldn't finish that apology. The army doctor let go of his lapels, throwing his arms around Sherlock's neck and hugging him close instead. The detective stood for a second and hesitated. This wasn't the reaction he'd expected, but the one he didn't dare hope for.
Sherlock glanced up briefly, his eyes meeting Mycroft's, who was just about to leave. He mouthed him a reluctant 'Thank you.', receiving only a surprised smirk in return. His brother nodded, and walked outside.
"First of all, that bird's nest." he smiled. "I'm getting you hairties for Christmas. You look like a bloody scarecrow."
pattern was coming closer, faster than Sherlock could react. Something was pulling at his ankle; probably John's laptop charger lying underfoot was to blame. It wouldn't have been the first time this had occured, as John frequently left the cable lying around. He'd faceplanted into the rug rather gracefully a few times before. But that very occasion was still different. There were hands now, reaching out, seizing him by the arm to hold him back. In vain.
"Sherlock!" And he closed it immediately, turning around sharply, now standing face-to-face with his doctor. He was oblivious, but definitely not stupid. He surely saw the remnants of tears in his eyes. It would've been so easy to break down, to hold him and cry into his shoulder, but the detective chose not to. He wanted John to see him strong to be able to let him go. But it didn't look like the man squeezing his shoulder was ever going to let that happen.
"Mycroft nearly got sick to his stomach when he saw me" he admitted, and suddenly, the doctor understood why the elder Holmes was merely the puppeteer behind all action. "He came to Serbia, you know. Sometimes I entertain the possibility of him actually having a heart." He was so eager to tell his stories John didn't have it in him to stop him and say he was aware of it. He so rarely spoke of his brother anyway.
With slow and careful steps, he approached Sherlock's room, the door ever-so-slightly open. The floorboards creaked when he stepped inside, but he kept going anyway.
As he rested his chin on top of Sherlock's head, he couldn't help but be reminded of their goodbye, and the reluctance the detective tried so hard to mask. It was alike the incident in Baskerville, when it looked like it physically pained him to admit he was afraid of something. There was no hiding anything tonight. He experienced it himself, with his newfound distrustfulness and shorter temper, war changes a man in ways he had never expected to change. Yet there they both were. Fucked up, but with somebody equally fucked up by their side who understood. Who cared. Who, John dared to hope, loved and was loved in return.
He cracked a grin, shaking his head. That night could only become so much of a disaster. Holmes surely had something clever to say, with a probable undertone of cynism or sarcasm, as per usual. As per usual, but not at that very moment. He didn't seem to have an answer for this.
. He drew the ending bars in their place, and played through the entire song one last time. 'Reichenbach Requiem', he ended up titling it. As cliché as a title could be, but to be fair, he was never particularly good with them. That's John's job, he's the writer.
"I've never been particularly good at this..." Sherlock muttered a little later, as the two of them were stood on the stairs leading up to their flat. He was a couple steps lower, to be able to look the older man in the eye.
, as John said. But also, he'd have been lying if he said he didn't enjoy it. He hadn't slept that well in what felt like ages. And John didn't mind it, didn't push him away or left him there alone. If anything, his behaviour spoke that not only did he not mind it, he... was fine with it. Comfortable with his annoying dick of a flatmate falling asleep on him. Sherlock smiled faintly. If nothing more serious ever happened, if he could never gather his courage to tell him about his stupid infatuation, he'd still have that night to treasure. Nobody could ever take that memory from him.
They ended up in John's armchair, tangled into one another. In the heat of the moment, the older man forgot entirely about his paramour's injuries as he pushed him into the back of the chair. Sherlock hissed into their manyeth kiss, and John pulled away immediately, panting for air. "God, I'm sorry. I got carried away."
"Oh," he said when his gaze met Sherlock's. He untangled his fingers out of embarrassment of getting caught in the act. "Feeling any better?" he asked softly, only to be met with silence. The intelligent, observant eyes staring into his own were tearful, and yet he didn't try to wipe them away. "C'mere" he whispered to him, and the younger man didn't hesitate for a second to cuddle close, burying his face into John's chest, long, thin arms thrown around his torso sleepily.
"John? Are you coming?" No. Sherlock was very much alive, and looking at him from the cab, with an impatient look on his face. John sighed with relief, and got in after him.
Sherlock's eyes widened as he listened on. He still considered the flat as theirs. Even when he corrected himself, he didn't claim it as his. 221B Baker Street was theirs, and would always be.
"Lazarus returned from the dead as his journey wasn't done in this world yet. He served a purpose. For his family and close friends, his return must have been a miracle." Softening the blow with metaphors was not something his brother would've normally done. Oh, no. He was testing John to see how long it took him to catch on. Clever.
"Sherlock..." he heard someone say from far away, accompanied by a yawn. The person, undeniably a male, successfully woke him, but not for long before his eyelids forced themselves shut again. The detective whined, making a similar sound to a dragged 'no', and cuddled back into his pillow. "Sherlock, you git. It's morning. Wake up."
"Watch telly with me?" Sherlock asked in a last desperate attempt to keep John with him and hopefully avoid dozing off.
Sherlock sat there, blinking at the rug and blushing profusely (and not only because of his fantasies of John in a uniform), not knowing if he should be flattered or horrified. That was definitely not what he intended, not in the slightest. If he was awake, he wouldn't ever have dared to be that
Halfway through a discussion about last night's episode of the X Factor, a head full of unruly, dark curls popped up from the doorway.
