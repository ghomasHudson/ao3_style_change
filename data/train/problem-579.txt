“This has never happened before!” The man huffed, a desperate whine surfacing in his tone, hands thrown in the air; exasperated. “It’s been happening all day!”
“We know. We know. Just…” John breathes in. “Her mother has not been loving, then has been absent and then gone for good through a timespan of months.” He pushes out in a single, quick exhale.
-'to defenestrate' means to throw someone out of a window. And yes it is a rather bitter/cynical reference to the Moftiss comment on Tumblr during that Q&A. They said Sherlock was the kind of person who would throw a baby out of the window.
There it is. The look. That damned look… Sherlock pining him to the spot with his eyes. Speaking without words. Accusing without accusation. Still believing. Still holding on. But now actually asking for an explanation. An action. A relief. Reprieve. Something! As if all this could be erased if John just would…
“She said not to worry”. John lets his words be scattered by the cool stirring of the breeze but avoids Sherlock’s eyes.
“Booba?” A tiny little daring whisper. A tiny little palm extended, tiny little finger poking at Lestrade’s cheek and withdrawing with a whine, looking up at John with clouded eyes.
It takes hold. Like a sap buried in winter with its life renewed with sunlight, John’s back straightens, his face eases, and he can stand. A purpose. A path.
The kitchen was almost empty of utensils and plates, but they were placed sparsely in the cupboards, with plenty of room being wasted.
him close and judging by the time, his love has also slept late. Great sign, good sleep. John strolls over to the kitchen, places Rosie on her chair, washes the dishes, gathers old trays, straightens blankets, fluffs up the pillows, tidies away toys, lights the fireplace, moves their armchairs closer, fussing, fussing. He starts making their tea. Fussing.
3. Also, for anyone that might try this without having done CBT before: There are countless of sources online on how to do this mental exercise properly. We are no experts and the best advice we can give from personal experience is to learn how to do it first -educate yourself- and please, don't leave it incomplete like we did here for purely literally purposes. DO the positive thinking as well!
Sherlock watches as John’s silver hair turns messy, as his face heats up, as his laughter lines start to show. He doesn’t really want to act up anymore. But he still feels sore.
“Um. Brought tea”, Sherlock raises the cup a little. The fingers holding it are numb and throbbing with heat.
The silence is broken by Rosie’s soft giggle and they both look at her, a little bit wide eyed at how much happier than before she sounded; if that is even possible. Then John goes on to fix her breakfast and their routine catches them, letting them dance around each other again but not reveal more. And when John goes downstairs to put in the laundry -a small pink elephant showing at the top of their laundry basket- Rosie follows him with grabby hands and Sherlock rushes to help her get down the stairs. And John’s heart is still giggling with love.
They talk about the games/tests for some minutes, as they let her establish her comfort zone and then Sherlock picks her up again as Chloe brings what they need. She observes Rosie’s behaviour for about ten minutes more, without either of them interfering, and reassures them again after, all smiles and kindness, bidding them goodbye and sending them a list of helpful books to clue them in on the processes she usually uses, among them some good references for parenting and childcare, language acquisition and psychological trauma or imbalances in early life, along with their hearing tests prescription and the clinic she recommends, all to John’s email address, and leaves them to choose an appropriate date and time for their next appointment at the reception desk.
Sherlock chews on the inside of his lip. He wants to say something back, something clever, very clever, like he used to do. Wants to leave John speechless, maybe with a hint of that look he used to give him, that look that cheered amazing!, fantastic!, back at him. But now is not then. Sherlock doesn’t care to have the last word that much now, not against John. He lets it slide, smiling to himself as he closes the door of his bedroom behind him.
He hears it though. The screams. The terror in the deep baritone voice. His name. The relief. And again. ‘No, no, no, not again, not again, please, I don’t- I don’t want to again!’ he pleads and struggles but the streetlights can’t keep him close to reality enough for him to take control. Hands on his head, blocking his ears shut, he has to slow down. He’s shifting and struggling but he can’t move, can’t speak, can’t reassure or scream back. It’s distorted, and his eyes are wide as the fire builds and consumes him and a tall figure falls into it with intent, unwavering. Wanting to burn, to sacrifice its own self in order to save... save John from under the logs of the torturing campfire, from under the void...
John’s pinkies rest on the edges of Sherlock’s palm, steady as ever, keeping him steady too. He has the flashlight in his mouth again and a pair of medical tweezers in his good hand. ‘There we go, there we go, you can do this, love.’ He tries to communicate as he nears his target. The tweezers close tight around the shard’s edge and John pulls.
He thought... he thought they were getting better. He thought they were managing. For real this time. They looked at each other in the morning, they talked. A bit. Step by step, John felt getting closer to the real conversations lurking. His stomach a knot at the thought but he knew. He knew it was the right thing to do.
He shoves his keys in his pocket, his wallet, and phone. Pauses. There is one more thing he has to do.
Rosie grabs her small spoon, already laid there by John earlier, and shakes it through the air like a sword. She babbles and points it to Sherlock’s direction as well as John’s with a questioning sound. John shrugs at him. ‘Can’t ignore that, mate. She’s too cute for you.’
“Sherlock doesn’t think she has any hearing problems at all and frankly, I agree, she understands everything I say even.” He paused, bit his lip. “That’s what worries me the most. If I have said or done something -or many things- that she understood without me meaning to… If she’s…”
He hadn’t been able to speak. He had stood up, and walked to the kitchen, and had known at once that the wall between them had been rebuilt and taller than last time, that what he had done could not be undone with a simple word. John’s shoulders were hunched, a wolf nursing and hiding his injured paw, and Sherlock had kept well away, as his mind kept chiming ‘don’t look, don’t speak, for god’s sakes, don’t be annoying’.
“John”, Sherlock says again in appeasement, stilling mid-motion. He waits until John’s gaze falls, and then reaches for him again.
Sherlock blinks. Honeybee’s appointment, with the children’s psychotherapist and speech therapist. John had arranged it some days ago and was both intrigued by the fellow doctor’s abundant qualifications and worried about the procedure in equal measure.
“N-no. She stopped. Everything. She couldn’t- She didn’t even cry. She just looked at the ceiling at night when I got her back from-” He freezes.
“You don’t want to be”. It’s not a question, but not a statement either. An offering, instead. The ground is unsteady beneath their feet, and there are cracks on the ice that spread and grow thicker, like blackened dry branches.
He doesn’t think. He doesn’t want to. Everything he needs is with him. Almost as little as he had when he came home from the war. Most of it is Rosie’s. His daughter. Still asleep against his chest. Baker Street. That’s where all his medical journals and books or anything that his wife didn’t fancy are anyway. The upstairs bedroom. He feels like a refugee. A refugee trying to get home. Knowing when he gets there nothing will be the same.
He feels John’s gaze on him, and stops, the thread so tight around his finger it hurts as if it were cutting into his skin. He hears the small wooden thud of the cup being placed on the bedside table, and then a warm, reddened palm rests atop his hand.
“Thank you” He pushes out and leans, reaching. A soft peck for Rosie; met by a whine. Another for their treasured landlady that acts more like a mother.
“Me neither”, John grins, and goes back to washing the dishes. Sherlock’s smile only grows. He had not dared imagine it could be like this. Even though the sky is not clear and the clouds are still there, as well as the promise of cracked ice beneath his feet, there is a clearing now, sparse rays of sunshine reaching into the ruins in his mind, caressing them. Making them beautiful again.
Sherlock catches his gaze as he puts the phone away, back in John’s pocket. And he’s close. So close. And he’s smiling. An easy smile. A simple nod of encouragement. A nudge. As if John’s words to his daughter brush over Sherlock’s curls too. As if he already knows the soothing, steady tones and how they work. As if those tones are perfect in their broken imperfection.
Mrs. Hudson returns with the thermometer, handing it to him before rushing to the kitchen. “Will get started on some chicken soup. Some broth could help”
Rosie makes a weird coughing noise, sounding almost like exasperation -the toddler version-, and hides her face in Mrs Hudson’s neck as John reaches to hold her. His hand recoils, rigid on his side, and he offers an understanding disciplined nod, refraining from taking her from such a loving embrace that she has, and wants, from the elderly woman.
John tests the water depth with his fingers. It’s all bubbly and colourful now. There’s no reply until he looks back at them both, Sherlock standing tall and the little bundle in his arms, fingers so careful, so soft, not surgical, just tender, soothing over Rosie’s scalp.
“On the last day of September.” He finishes deepening his voice in a tease; dragging long round notes, resembling a poor imitation of Opera.
He is swimming, kicking, pushing his body forward, he is jolting half-awake, and the light that assaults his eyelids makes him want to close them again, even though where he will go the struggle will melt his muscles into pain and acid.
“Come on.” John walks to Sherlock’s side, leaning close, hand over his shoulder. “Let it be for now, hm?”
“John!” He gasps, breathless, instead and John is already kneeling beside them on the floor, scraping his knees on the rug at the force his need to be there for them both creates.
John slides the glass kitchen doors open, hands on hips, a fond look in his eyes surveying the situation. Rosie has decided to not particularly care for her penguin plushie today. Mrs Hudson washed it yesterday, maybe it has to do with the smell. Yes, that should be it. There is something about it that renders it good throwing material instead of cuddling. Sherlock finds it incredibly upsetting.
“Sherlock..?” John’s eyebrows raise. Sherlock huffs, looking down, mouthing at his lower lip with newfound intensity.
“Yes, in fact, thank you for recommending your colleague and going through every little detail with me when I couldn’t decide and felt… you know.”
“Shhh shhh, shhh, Papa’s here. Papa’s here, sweetheart.” His palm rubs over her small back as she settles with her face at the crook of his neck.
Sherlock is looking at him as if one of the eyeballs he used to keep in the fridge returned to haunt him on two legs. But he didn’t say no. He did not send him away. John was the man who had beaten him to death. Who would have. And the man who now asked permission to nurse him back to health. And his plea would be granted materialisation. It was almost too easy. Perhaps these good omens will dissipate if he concentrates on them too much. He turns on his heel, letting Sherlock follow at his own pace.
We are dealing, again, with some difficult themes in this chapter (mainly depression-anxiety). As always, please heed the tags.
Some days he can shower. Some days he can get dressed, stand, smile. Get a few bites down, face John, hold Rosie, will his hands not to tremble. Others, his bed is an abyss that won’t let him go. An abyss he has to fight. He does not want to admit those days are more frequent by far. That the good moments fleeting amidst dark waters. He focuses on the immediate action he must complete each time, on reaching the next hour on the clock. Small steps, small victories -that do not even feel like victories, because there is not much to win at all. The effort is to lose as little as possible each day. To not crumble.
“She’s only 22 months, though. That shouldn’t be bothersome for you.” Chloe always addresses both of them, but doesn’t press Sherlock to join in.
His phone buzzes. His fingers are itchy; it has not done so for a while. With a glance to make sure Honeybee is okay in her baby park and will most probably not need his attention for a little while, he retrieves the device from the pocket of his dressing gown, passes it from shaky left hand to impatient right one.
She didn’t ask for an explanation, so he kept talking, momentary freer than before, zoned out, lost in memory, in the way innocence played through Sherlock’s drilling blue gaze.
“John.” Sherlock knows now. He knows what this is about and is ready to reassure. John can read him.
“If you’re worried I might judge you or him based on what I already know; I need to remind you that I’m not here to judge anyone.”
Rosie is curled up in a small corner of her cot when John enters the room. Her elephant is squeezed tight by her bulky short arms and she’s chewing one pink ear into her mouth. Her blue eyes are wide and pale, her hair so messy John needs to shower her with affection in the next five minutes or his chest is going to explode.
“I joined a support group”, John blurts out. “For the…” He stops with a sigh, as if something were holding him back. “Might as well name it. We’re not children after all”, he murmurs. “The alcohol issue”
Greg quirks an eyebrow but John is just trying to hide his grin under a palm. There is a shifting balance between them for days. Changing from confident to hesitant, easy to awkward, painful to happiest. He hopes this is a point for the positive team.
“Sherlock…?” John’s voice is soft, his eyebrow knitted together, tugging that bit upwards. He is afraid. Tired. There is no façade now. It’s only the man that panicked because Sherlock might leave. The man that held his hand to soothe him. That leaned against him, as much as he took care of him. The man that smiled at him when he saw him in the morning, as if the sight truly gave him joy.
Rosie takes a careful step towards John, but his heartbroken tone makes her stop and kneel to crawl back to Sherlock instead, bulky, tiny fingers clinging at his trousers. Sherlock appears to have found no reassuring use of his hands now that Rosie is gone and so he takes the chance to reach and brush her hair as she sits on his shoe, his face serious and muscles stretched at the corners.
Rosie’s palms slip and he holds her steady, guiding her hands to rest on his chest. She looks up at him, serious glistening orbs are questioning the significance of the gesture. John’s spine tingles. He holds his palm over hers now. His heartbeat is steady and she feels it. She has obviously decoded that this soft sound that puts her to sleep when she’s crying and Sherlock or John himself sometimes are holding her over their hearts is always available and accessible, always there for her, whenever she needs it. She can always reach and feel it. Now, her plump cheeks dimple and John’s eyes are stinging.
to. It’s… It should never have been like this, and I… It’s not me. I know you’ll be quite right not to believe me, but… That… That fucked up joke is not me. I don’t want it to be. It… It’s my responsibility, and my fault, and I’ll change it”
was the one to blame. That thought he deserved the punishment of abandonment and loneliness. John's beating was just that. Sherlock had never looked at John to be his executioner, had never wanted the punches and beating to exist between them. How even John could deliver such treatment only signified, in his mind, the beginning of the end. John was his last hope, his last stronghold; the fraying last thread in a rope about to snap. If even John could beat him up, then Sherlock surely deserved whatever painful thing was in store for him.
Sherlock does not want to lose him. The knowledge aches, turns him raw from the inside. But isn’t he but a fraction of the man he used to be? A liar?
“If you’d like- to, help?” John empties the contents of the pan on their plates, moves the tray on the table, some bacon and cheese and pepper and salt, some beans too and their toasted bread coming. “Last few times haven’t been…” He stirs Rosie’s fruit purée, teeth dragging over his lip in concentration -and a little bit avoidance.
Sherlock was speaking to her in hushed tones, tender and careful. He was adamant about baby talk. John remembered from the days when her mother had gone off the grid.
“I have an idea. Do you want to put your drawing on the fridge, so that we can see it every day? It will be a beautiful memory. What do you think?”, he blurts out. She makes a soft ‘oh’ sound of interested confusion.
He can’t keep him. He can’t push him away, either. And no matter what he does, now or later, he is destined to lose him.
Not done then. John straightens up, returns Sherlock’s piercing gaze with his own. He can deal with that. Yes.
He is looking straight ahead, sipping his tea in silence, when there’s a shift of leather on silk, and a weight over John’s shoulder. He turns, curious, and there he is. There are his curls brushing over John’s chin. There are the cheekbones he so secretly desires. There’s the pale, freckled face of Sherlock. His Sherlock… His best friend… and devoted companion… and…
“What?”, she cackles drily. “What? You can’t even bear to hear the word, can you?” Her voice has softened.
The voice was there. John blinked, needing to make sure the physical presence was real too. There he was, as he hoped. The man himself. Blue was the only colour John could see, his eyes still clouded over. There was deep blue, silken, taking him in its waves, guiding him home. The nightgown transferring him to secret chambers, well-hidden memories of the old times. Happy ones. Of blue eyes, shining rainbows like diamonds. Crystal clear and sparkling with excitement. Laughter.
John blinks at him as if hypnotized. And then his jaw sets. “I have no idea what you are talking about, Sherlock”, he says, very, very slowly. His voice has lowered.
If John does not regret it by morning. If he meant it. Sherlock is doubting what happened even a mere moment ago. John could not really have asked him if he wanted…
Never had he been fortunate enough to feel such a novel emotion of tranquillity. Peace that was broken constantly by the rumble of waves against rocks. An unmoving lake turning to a monsoon, waves as high as the need for touch after enduring starvation of months, years, lifetimes. A colourful sunset splattered with tones of black shadows as the oily waters shiver into millions and millions of rippling fabric. Of miles and miles of skin to walk upon and explore. Of wishes thrown over a bridge and down to the river’s abyssal whirlpools. Destined to be taken away despite their secure weight and thrown into the ocean by the force of it all. The force of that love.
It shouldn’t be news, but it hits him like a wave. Sherlock is tired. Not the kind of tired John usually remembers fondly. The kind that has him slopping on the sofa as an adrenaline come-down settles in after a chase in London’s streets. Neither the hyperactive detective kind, not getting enough sleep in the middle of a case, brilliant enough to occupy his mind through endless hours of wakefulness in his early thirties without a hint of slowing down, finally dozing off anywhere he could find with no care for the world. It’s not the kind of tired he was when he couldn’t sleep well because of his body still trying to recover -although that might be part of it even now.
They talked little. Sherlock’s eyes travelling from his food to John and back. The other man would smile at him, tiredly, but his eyes would crinkle softly at the edges, after the way of his true smiles -which Sherlock knew so well, but whose memory had faded, turned foggy and distant. ‘When was the last time?’
Sherlock raises the plushie in front of his face, wiggling its small wings. Cautious, hesitant, shy even. Rosie is thoroughly enjoying herself. She grabs it to her chest, squeezes it tight, makes Sherlock gasp with hope and throws it away again. Sherlock freezes, his chin wrinkling as he tries to calm himself down from his devastated state. Alarm bells go off in John’s mind. Time to troubleshoot. His hyperventilating detective is malfunctioning and in much need of help.
There is no mistaking his bearing, his stride, the way his breaths rise and fall. In a sea of people, a million of them, as intertwined and inseparable as the drops that together make the water, Sherlock would know him, would
Sherlock's mind returns to the present, as the nervous impatience wafting from the other man strikes at him in waves. John unstraps the baby carrier and holds it, with some awkwardness before he glances behind his shoulder, almost comically, as if to make sure the boxes are still there. Rosie huffs and gnaws on her fist, whining like an annoyed kitten. It hits Sherlock then; John needs to carry the boxes and second suitcase inside, and obviously cannot do that with a sleeping baby on his chest or arms.
Sherlock’s eyes dart around the street, searching, dismissing, lightening in recognition or pulling away in confusion. Cars speed past them in the normal hectic morning rush and Sherlock’s fingers flinch every time a loud noise erupts between the monotone hum of the city; tires on asphalt, dinging of traffic lights for the visually impaired, honking. John hasn’t seen him in broad daylight in a while. Hasn’t seen his responses to the city’s overwhelming stimuli. Sherlock hasn’t been out at all. His birthday was spent just downstairs at Speedy’s, in semi-darkness.
John shrugs out of his brown parka and sits himself down. He reaches to place a kiss on Rosie’s forehead but she recoils, curling into herself. Maybe it’s the music, the people -even if quiet and calm and of course significantly fewer than inside the tube-, the lights or John himself. John doesn’t know and this is no time to find out. He knows what she has been asking since that intersection.
“He’s been a vital part of your life and your recovery and I was wondering… if you’d like to talk about him.”
Sherlock wonders what John would do if he found out. If Sherlock told him, with no preamble, no excusing, no explaining, just told him. He would not lose him. That much is obvious -and that was never the issue. But there is only so far John can go. The touches would stop. The closeness they have achieved, the trust would be destabilised. John would start worrying. Being cautious. Being reserved. Doubting. Avoiding. He would feel guilty, perhaps; for not knowing, for making Sherlock uncomfortable -as he would no doubt see it.
. Rosie will never hear a single shaming or hateful comment from him. Towards anyone. John will not let her life be like his. Harry is wrong. He’s the man, the soldier that whatever power he has, always considers twice before using it. He can be the man he wants to be, the man Sherlock believes him to be. Harry is wrong. He can be a father. A proper one.
“But- but she…” A sigh. Sherlock crosses his arms over his chest and around the plushie in the process. “She loved it yesterday…”
Sherlock sucks in a breath. Slowly straightens out, rubs his eyes as if he were drowsy. His neck is burning. But when he looks up, John is in the kitchen with his back to him, rummaging into a cupboard - standing
“No. Sherlock. It was my fault. Okay? You were right. You don’t deserve pity. And that is exactly how I made you feel. I fucked up, okay? There’s no excuse for that”
Sherlock snorts. “Don’t you think you’ve said enough for one day, Captain?” The word is blurted out before he can think about what he’s doing. His tongue dries up, and he wishes he could disappear in the cushions of the couch, crawl under the rug and just… die of hot-red shame.
He had appeared harsher than he wanted. He knows, but he can’t take it back. He can’t let Sherlock get sick. Not with his immune system, they had worked so hard to repair piece by piece.
There is a certain amount of novelty to the world John wakes up to today. A world where he has felt Sherlock’s lips against his own. A world seeming devoid of any sadness. One where Sherlock doesn’t mind getting involved.
“Don’t we want Sherlock to tell us, mm?” He smooths out her worry with a smile and her eyes shine in recognition. She reaches a palm to Sherlock immediately, grabby fingers kneading the air.
John startles as the weight is lifted of his arms and Sherlock is now standing, tall and firm, Rosie held over his chest already. Sherlock nods.
Just as Harry said. His life is departing without him. The kitchen is empty. No pig in the fridge. No toes in the microwave. No glass microscope slides filled with samples and immaculately catalogued and organised over the table. Maybe that’s it. That’s reality. Maybe he imagined it all. Maybe John is dead because
John coughs, trying to get his attention, the remote already in his palm. He waves it towards Sherlock in an exaggerated movement.
“Syllables barely fit in.” Sherlock mumbles, hesitant. His immediate backtracking comes as he fixes his gaze on the table.
The pool of milky siren venom drained to the back of his neck, flowed down his spinal cord, dissipated slowly as it entered the flow of his limbs. His vision cleared, his ears became unblocked, his throat opened, voice springing free with a small cough to clear the silence away. There was a numbness left behind still, but it resembled fatigue, like when he was climbing to the top that apple tree when he was seven. His muscles were boiling with it, but the sensation was not immediate, kept instead at the back of his mind, a constant low droning.
As they near the centre of the park, more people begin to intercept their path or pass by them. Few look, and even fewer linger on what they see if they do look. There are old couples swaying softly with their arms linked, mothers with strollers or toddlers, people walking their dogs, or others jogging by, their feet steady as a metronome as they thump against the ground.
“Thank you, Rosie”, he whispers, and holds her with both arms around her little body, frail and marshmallow-soft where it is not all bony and angle-y -on the kicking machines of her elbows and knees. Her hair, tight little curls that have grown longer to frame her face, have the same colour John’s used to have. And when he breathes in them, he can smell baby-powder and shampoo, beside her unique baby-scent; something sweet and yet a little tangy-savoury all at once, like a whimsical little fruit. Wild strawberry, maybe. Or mango. He knows there’s a storm brewing here too, beneath the quiet. A storm altogether different, but just as demanding. She’s growing. She understands, and she feels. The world around her she absorbs like a water-hungry sapling. And she needs. She needs stability, and safety. She needs her father. The longing for him, his smile, his praise, his time, his embrace, it almost makes Sherlock’s arms numb every time he holds her. The longing for a father who is drowning, in the same room as her, sinking, away from her reach without her being able to grasp him, to grasp why.
John smiles, hope rising in his chest, and she somehow -like always- sees him and smiles back. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t recognize the flash of pride growing over her features.
It drifts back to the few times his breathing had been joined by a deeper, steadier one. The times he and John had shared a room, or a bed, for a case outside of London. Times counted in the fingers of one hand. All of them times he’d fallen asleep to the lulling comfort of John’s body being so close to his own. Criminals and serial killers might be ruling the world, for all he knew, but in the darkness of the spaces they had shared then, Sherlock had felt safe; as if he were a child huddled in the illusion of the impenetrability of its tent against the vastness of the forest. All these times ended too fast.
He’s not going to look up. He’s only looking inwards. Trying to. The words are choking in his throat.
Of course, John is not stupid. He did not do it out of ignorance -most probably out of genuine emotion. Since he regarded Sherlock as  a member of his family, given his words tonight, he then took it for granted all this while that whatever he said and did had a very specific frame to be interpreted in.
With awareness came the questions about what he had missed, how long it had been. He glanced at his watch. It was almost ten o’clock in the morning. Didn’t John have a shift today, an appointment? Was Honeybee alright? Had she eaten at breakfast, how had she been? Had John eaten anything? His eyes scanned over the man sitting across from him on the bed with one leg beneath his body. This time there were no dark circles under John’s eyes, but there were fading lines over his forehead, and those hugging his eyes were deepened; John had been worried. Sherlock would know, or thought he would know anyway, what to do with that information; if there wasn’t that little detail, that warm palm over his. There was nothing he could explain now. He wasn’t at sea. He wasn’t on solid ground, either. He was stranded. Sherlock decided to opt for the worst-case scenario, even though it did not sit as well as it used to within him. He kept his gaze lowered.
“Now, now, let’s not be hasty.” A cutting baritone cuts the curtain of the world in half and John emerges, blinded by the light. “We all know who needs to reconsider, don’t we?”
Sherlock’s ribs are making him uncomfortable, the result of a restless night. John instructs him to straighten his spine but keep it relaxed, that it should help. He notes that they could try purchasing an anatomic mattress and pillow, once Sherlock gets better. He speaks with concern which is genuine, even though Sherlock is poised as a hawk, prepared to trace any sign of self-hatred and guilt. John’s knuckles are still bandaged up. John’s temple still bears a faint, yellowing bruise, from where he had struck at his own head.
Cold seeps through his skin, crawls over his stomach. Honeybee demolishes her little tower and begins to search for the cloth blocks that have animal faces on them.
Sherlock’s teeth dig into his lower lip. He doesn’t reply. His eyes cloud over. John pats the table with his fingertips and gets up, casually flicking the kettle on, walking to the living room and opening the curtains, allowing what faint light there is to help with the atmosphere around them. He’s no stranger to Sherlock’s lack of sleep, sulks or silences. He can handle it. He knows how easily bored his best mate can become and frankly, it’s about time, despite Sherlock’s need for recovery. Still, John wants to break through to the reason behind this one. It feels different although John doesn’t know in what way. And in any case, he knows how to give Sherlock space while keeping him close to reality, so if it proves difficult to break through the surface, all John needs to do is what he once did best. Be there for him. Be his friend.
Sherlock spent that first late-night remedying that. By the time he was finished, one-third of cupboards and shelves and drawers in the kitchen were clean and reserved for Rosie’s little dowry alone.
He suspects she gets it from her mother. Not that he has any baby pictures or trustworthy memory narrations to prove it. He had been a bulky baby himself but it’s not like she lacks any plumpness and her cheeks are pink and soft and round. She just has this uncanny way of getting places no one expects her to. It’s quite endearing when-
He sits on his armchair again. His left hand is shaky as he carefully places the thermometer under her arm and holds it close to her body to steady it. “Only for a moment, Rosie, I promise”.
John unexpectedly chuckles. The low rumble usually joining him -in good days bygone- doesn’t this time, but when he glances over the table, Sherlock is at least breaking a tiny smile.
The breaths flying through his lips are quick, frail puffs of air against the darkness. The swell and fall of his ribcage is uneven beneath bruised flesh and cracked bone. He hugs his torso with a steadying arm, traces his own ribs jutting angrily at his fingertips. Breathes.
‘Just like Harry.’ He thinks. He’s bitter. Of course, he’s just like Harry. It’s doesn’t matter how their lives turned out. What matters is, they’re heading on the same track and they come from the same childhood. End of story. Neither of them can be parents because of it. That’s why he can’t give her Rosie. That’s why he can’t give up.
Besides, Sherlock has accepted John is permanently lost to him (remember?). John was noble enough to save him from Culverton. But not even he could be noble enough to feel Sherlock mattered more than that (no one could be). He did not visit him in the hospital again, for Christmas or New Year’s (why would anyone want to see a drug addict in the throes of withdrawal, anyway). When Sherlock was allowed to return home, John had agreed to have a ‘shift’ in the meagre troop of people who would come to see Sherlock for the first few days to make sure he was doing okay (and was not tempted by the sweeties), but Sherlock does not know how this was arranged, or by whom -or how and why John had agreed (most probably because there was no one else to fill a gap in the schedule).
"Sherlock?" The spike in John’s voice pierce his feet, his hands, his belly. He is empty. He tries to move, but all he can manage is to sway, tries to speak but nothing will come out of his lips.
John looks at the positively dazzling figure beside him. He looks and he can see. He can observe. Finally. This is the man running to the fire to save him.
“Tomorrow.” He corrected. Eyes widened, realising. Sherlock hadn’t spoken. Sherlock wasn’t there. Sherlock had already gone to bed. He shook his head.
“We sure will, young man. Sure will.” She rushes downstairs with her wobbly gait and John rolls his eyes. He’s not
They were connected in ways Sherlock had never seen or felt before. Even though somehow, it had all been there all along. Like finding a long-lost precious toy in an innocuous, random hiding spot years later. Like growing into the body one is meant to have, the right skin and bones and vessels of blood. Like returning home.
He hasn’t stopped hearing John’s voice since. It comes and goes as it pleases, as if it has a will of its own. He doesn’t know where exactly it comes from, even though its details and mannerisms stem directly from his memories, from the wing devoted to John in what used to be a palace among the ruins. And it grew so real, that it did not have to say only things he’d heard John say but could say anything at all and it would still be unmistakably John’s voice. It would still be
Sherlock stares at his reflection in the locked mobile’s screen. He’ll need to shave soon. ‘When was the last time?
John grows tense, averting his eyes. Sherlock huffs beside him. Exasperation carefully covered by an expertly cultivated shield of indifference only John knows how to break apart. Rosie squeals in a quiet register, squeezing the elephant pillow to her little chest. Still shy, hiding in her shell.
He hears a thud, muffled against wood. His body stills, straining, to absorb more sounds. Nothing else comes his way. It’s not curiosity, or need, but worry that takes the better of him. A morbid kind of worry. The one that has him thinking the worst.
There is no divide. No wall or ceiling or door or mountain or ocean will ever stand between them anymore. John can’t feel anything of the sort. There are explanations to be made, important matters to talk about from both ends. But John doesn’t feel the rug is being pulled under his feet every time Sherlock is not in the room with him anymore. He woke up feeling as if he had slept beside the man, for goodness’ sake!
“You had everything planned and I-… I was angry. I was angry that you had relapsed, that I had left you alone and wasn’t there when you-” A breath. “I wasn’t sure why-” Was he the reason? The DVD said so but… he wasn’t sure. He couldn’t trust it. He could only trust Sherlock, whenever he was ready to share. But not now. Now he has to finish this.
John’s eyes rise to his face, again, but the ascend is slow, as if he needs to gather courage for every centimeter up.
“I’ve been... meaning to...” John’s palm presses against his kneecap. Pushing, patting, curling. All fidgety but soft motions, silent; not alarming.
How many secrets? Sherlock won’t be able to hide it forever. His broken mind, or his little problem. Some day he will not succeed at pretending. And what will happen then?
Sherlock glances at the menu chalkboard on the wall to his right. Toasties, scones, pies. He hadn’t paid heed before, but now certainly feels a shy pang of hunger.
Their cohabitation had turned more conscious. They sat together, one night, to draft a shopping list. They talked about perhaps changing some old furniture. John talked about his economic difficulties, let Sherlock give an opinion on what they could prioritize. Asked him which baby food brand Honeybee had been preferring that week, and whether it would be better to switch things up or keep her on the same brand, what flavour would be better in either case. It was casual, and though tentative, at first, conversation had begun to pulse between them almost in the way it once did. John was the one who initiated it the most, by far, but Sherlock participated. He tried.
“Every parent goes through that at some point quite intensely. I merely wanted to point out how well you’re both doing. Having reactions to each other’s actions, communicating.”
Why would he do that? Why would he try? He’s here because he shouldn’t. Why is his mind so fucked up? Why does he care what people say? Why did he ever? Why can’t he just be content with what he has? Just
For once, John doesn’t doubt him. Doesn’t demand why. He stares at him, boring into his eyes so hard Sherlock could topple over. But he holds his ground, not knowing what it is John is seeing, John is taking, but giving and giving and giving it, for as long as John needs. Then he smiles. A small smile, but it’s there. Sherlock smiles back, and he can breathe again.
He’s down the stairs, thrown by the waves of silence, yet he’s stopped. His only strength, his mind. His will to bring himself back to it. His chest expands to the fullest, but he still doesn’t feel like breathing. His heartrate is spiking, channelling much needed blood to his brain, his muscles, his body. His eyes close. That should bring back the calmness. That always helps underwater, doesn’t it? Letting one’s fate in the sea’s arms. Letting the waves lull oneself into sleep. Hearing but not seeing. Not feeling. Only the coolness of one’s skin and the bubbly rhythmic sound of water. It must help.
“The big ship sails on the ally ally oh, the ally ally oh, the ally ally oh.” John’s raspy voice sounds tender and the tune gets carried through 221B in the quiet hours of a winter London evening. The noise and constant engine hum of the rush-hour gives way to a tentative start of an intense nightlife in particular neighbourhoods while Baker Street itself belongs to the easy and normal closing hours, to Madam Tussauds’ visitors dispersing through the surrounding streets since 4pm, to taxis driving lazily past Speedie’s in an attempt to avoid any late traffic and big roads filled with buses, bursting with people from all ethnicities, looking for potential customers in alleys and late-open pubs.
Honeybee’s weight is lifted from his arms. He sniffs, swallows, and reaches for his phone. No time to waste. It’s not him that matters now. Honeybee needs to receive the best possible care. Honeybee needs to be alright, please, please, please….
think. He doesn’t need more messed up thoughts running rampant around his stupid brain. He’s unable to handle the patients coming and going. He needs the cold London air, the rush of blood to his temples as he runs behind a tall dark figure with a coat. The crack of a knee or jaw against his knuckles as he wrestles a body to the ground. The soft smirk. The clever praise of iridescent -crinkling at the corners- eyes. He needs...
This time John doesn't walk away. He stays and waits for Sherlock to fall in step beside him. Sherlock feels as if he's walking in space; no gravity.
way, is he? A junkie and a psychopath but brilliant and not dirty, not soiled, God’s child, not a sinner-”
He’s barely slept, but there’s no telling John that. Last night when they decided to finally go to bed, they had done so on the mutual promise that they would try to get as much sleep as possible. Before that, they had stayed on the floor by the fireplace, each under his blanket, until John complained that his back had started protesting, and as the ‘old man’ that he was, he couldn’t ignore it. They moved to the couch. No telly, this time. They just sat, side by side, blankets draped over their legs, and watched the silence of the night crawl by. Lastly, they had drifted to the kitchen for their customary late-night cuppa. It’s a relatively new find; John brought home a new, soothing chamomile tea last week. Said he hoped it would help them get some sleep. It normally did, but not that night. Sherlock’s eyes could not stray away from John for long each time. And though their eyes did not always meet, Sherlock felt John’s gaze on him, like a second embrace above that of his dressing gown’s. The words of John’s confessions and apology still hummed between them, comfort in their aftermath. They nestled under Sherlock’s skin, John’s presence beside him more solid than it had ever been before.
“Sherlock. I am sorry. For everything I’ve put you through. All the hurt I’ve inflicted upon you.” He swallows, his voice breaking. “I didn’t want to hurt you.” A whisper, reverent and shaky between the sure words of sincere apology.
“Okay, then”, John hummed, when the last carton had been cleared away, leftovers in the fridge or microwave.
Overlooking the mess in the sink –for now, at least-, he goes through the cupboards in the kitchen, looking for other brands and flavours of baby food. He talks out loud for each of his findings, letting her see the packaging, touch it, explore -along with her elephant, dangling all this while from an ear she holds tight in her hand. Eventually comes across one that is vanilla flavoured, and shows it to her, guessing she would prefer it over the mango and mixed berries. It takes a moment for her to nod and mumble her agreement.
“Oh. It’s… Wait-“ John sits up to reach better, frowning in concentration, the way he does when he types, when he makes breakfast, when he reads the paper. Sherlock can see him on the edge of his vision, but can feel his breath in his ear, taste the familiar scent of him, tea and wool, a whiff of his old cologne and a touch of earth and grass and musk. John brings his other hand to steady Sherlock’s head, warm palm cupping his temple as he’s working to remove the leaf without pulling at the messy, still gelled, curls. Sherlock wants to press into the touch, mush his face against the red skin of John’s hand, discover if it’s soft or calloused like his fingers.
But even if John’s initiative can be brushed away, for Sherlock the offence is in his nature. Written into every tiny helix of every cell in his body. And breathing in every beat of the treacherous hole in his chest. He wants to cower away, hide.
He thinks he does, but ceiling and sun-less bright sky blend into one, indistinguishable, overwhelming. He is adrift, he is asleep. He is lying, he is sinking. He is trapped in the covers, he is taken under by the tide. There is no time to breathe, to cry out. There is only the endless crossing from one world to the other, or rather the interminable lingering on the threshold, neither here, nor there, and so in both places at once. Terror builds up in his arms, his legs, like white, frothy foam; he cannot open his eyes.
“So?” It’s suddenly quiet. John’s eyes hurry to Sherlock’s face. It’s hidden from him, lowered, a head full of dark curls offered instead; he’s resigned, and that makes it terrifying.
John remembers now and doesn’t rush, doesn’t push forward in his worry anymore. It’s normal. To have lost the tender balance they once had. It’s normal to seek to find it again. To test it, modify it, work it to perfection. He knows how it is to lose it. Twice. It cost him everything. There’s no way he’s giving up on it again. Ever.
She threw the spoon on his shirt with a gurgle. At the same time, Sherlock’s door opened with a thud.
John is studying the tabletop, the scratches on its old wood, the cracks where the polish could not hold anymore.
“I don’t want you to be alone” It is bittersweet and caring at the same time. “These people they… They are your friends, your family. I wish they’d at least call”
Afloat: So this chapter title was inspired by a certain sea creature's mating dance. The pair comes together every morning repeatedly to perform said dance, courting each other and floating in the water while tangling their small bodies for hours and hours before actually mating.
John has already gone to the stairs cupboard, carrying wood for the fireplace. He tidies some kindling underneath, is careful when he douses it with medicinal alcohol, and lights a match, pushing it between the dry wood. A flame catches, so quick John’s hand flinches back and he shakes it before bringing a finger to his mouth. He didn’t get burned though.
Their gazes lock and John almost sees the same conversation running through Sherlock’s mind. He looks at his knees again.
Sherlock brings his knees up so that he could rest his elbows on them, bone against bone. The high of the panic is beginning to ebb away. Every part of him it vacates is left weary, heavier. He is overwhelmed with the need to do something, to feel that he is still alive.
“Complicated.” His fingers flex. He won’t say anything more. It’s their pact. His and Sherlock’s. They struck it but a few minutes ago. They won’t break it. They’re not here to talk about
A pause. She scribbles a word down, giving him time to relax his tensing up shoulders, let him realise he’s being defensive and self-hating at the same time. He does. He sighs.
Greg manages to get a small finger(hand)shake in the end, Rosie encouraged by her father and finding Greg’s facial expressions hilarious. John scratches his small beard while serving tea, Sherlock watching with the corner of his eye, mellowed out now with John beside him again. John’s fingers trailing over his arm from time to time.
John’s lungs expand and this time, well trained and soothed, they actually bring in air for him to breathe.
The two voices had stopped moving in tandem. Rosie’s crying got quieter, as John’s frustration blew harder about him. Sherlock flinched when it reached a sudden peak. “Enough! Enough, goddammit! Enough! Stop it!”
John opens his mouth, closes it. Winces at the lack of words, and then, clearing his throat, tries again. “I want… I want this”
“Divorced. Currently single. With a decade-long alcohol problem. Clean now, but- Is that a patch on your arm? Of course it is -The stress levels at your new position are quite heightened, aren't they? You're used to a 9 to 5, not a freelance career and you're
“I-I’m sorry.” He turned, facing the cold gaze, palms rubbing impulsively together. “I need some air.” He gestured to the door, frantic, fingers going through his fringe afterwards, trembling. “We’ll-we’ll talk later, yeah?”
His fingers flex. He’s standing upright, in attention. Phone pressed against his sweaty earlobe. Any thought of reconciliation vanishes. He’s burning from within. What infuriates him the most is how she’s playing him with words, how she doesn’t even seem affected by the conversation, how she’s reminding him he’s the angry one, the uncontrollable male, the one in power, able to do anything he wants. Privileged. He hates how she makes him be what he hates. How she makes him believe it.
As if he could ever stop smiling when Sherlock is fumbling to find the TV remote inside forts of pillows. As if the pout of Sherlock’s elegant cupid’s bow isn’t enough to make John’s chest heavy and his lungs constrained, fighting to forge out his laughter, an act which he is currently resisting.
! He jolts to his feet, hurries past a newly startled Mrs. H. and down the corridor and slams the door behind him. He couldn’t face her. Her, or honeybee. Or John. Especially John. Thank god John isn’t here.
That is why the line shifts. Why John denied it as fervently as he could, why he always took a step away under scrutiny, why he was so resistant to as small and stupid a trend as product in one’s hair.
Happy. Happy and confident and loved. She is proof he can fix whatever mistakes he has made, correct every one of his wrongdoings that hurt her. Proof their healing process has started and has actual results. He weeps, quiet and reserved, not pressing the button to his secretary for the next patient to come in, looking at how beautiful, just beautiful she is. He remembers all her firsts he has missed, all her achievements he passed by and never gave a thought because he was angry, mind self-absorbed in everything else going wrong and not caring for the one thing that was there and
They walk up to the black door and ring the bell. Someone buzzes them in. Rosie looks up wide eyed. Is she thinking they’re going to one of the hidden gardens from Papa’s stories? No. Probably not. But… A man can hope.
She doesn’t like being constricted, even for so little. Her eyes are huge when she looks up at him, and he can see the strain in them, the trust she is putting in him, by letting him do this. Her fear twists inside him like a blade.
“It’s alright, Sherlock.” John places the tray on the round coffee table before sitting. He takes a sip of his tea, nodding for Sherlock to reach for his cup too, which he does.
And John can’t end this. He can’t finish it with a click of a trigger like he once could have. All because of one simple reason. One major development that he hadn’t thought of when he put this off for years. Believing he would get better. He would get a normal family and the best man he ever knew by his side… It would all get better… But it hasn’t… and he can’t do anything about it.
“Rest…” John whispers, closing his eyes and reaching. Reaching up and up. Fingers brushing over stubbly cheeks. Auburn. That’s what Sherlock’s hair had once been in colour. Like his facial hair. John would fall in love with him then and now and in between. All over.
But even if there will be a smile, it will be on a different face. There will be no more cases together, or 'us against the rest of the world'. There will be a baby to take care of. John will be grieving. The things that happened will not be undone.
Sherlock is not sure why, but he has a feeling that he should give John some time and space. “Will make some tea”, he murmurs, retreating into the kitchen.
‘Still okay? You still want to? Can I be yours already?’ John is having a hard time shutting his head up.
He can hold her now. For one month he’s fought to give her everything 8 months apart had taken from them both, fearing each day might be the last when he would be allowed to smile at her, to watch her grow, learn, play. To feel her trust, her innocent, pure care for him -ever trying to feed him with her spoon. He did not want to encourage her to bond with him, did not want her to experience another loss a second time. He always felt their time was borrowed. But every time he tried to resist her sunlit smiles, he couldn’t. And now he can hold her.
“No. I am only offering you the facts. You are John Watson”, Sherlock continues steadily, “and what you are has quite literally speaking led to us being here, today, having this conversation of how you are taking steps and decisions to improve your life”
John flinches and screws his eyes shut, the upper and lower lids meshed in a riverbed of wrinkles and lines and blue circles.
Please heed the tags. Repeating here, just for extra safety measures, that this chapter contains, in particular: panic attack, depression bout, self-harm ideation, self-hatred. And more.
For some reason, the corners of his lips curl up. The light coming in slowly from the window registering as surprisingly pleasant. God, he sounds like Sherlock in his head. He feels like him even. Calculating, waiting for an alarm, considering plans for the day -first time in forever that’s happened.
They could have parted much earlier than 3 am. But neither of them seemed to want to drift away. Perhaps neither could. Sherlock remembers that it hadn’t been an option in his mind, at least.
“She’s sleeping like an angel.” John elaborates. His little girl being the only one able to get some proper sleep.
He waits for Sherlock to push his plate away. A known signal by now that if he eats anymore, he might be sick. They don’t talk about that. Not yet. John has, once, with Sherlock’s doctor. He was a mess then but he remembers how conversation about it, at the exact point Sherlock tries to fight it, can be triggering. Sherlock has talked with his doctor too, of course, and by mutual unspoken agreement they haven’t breached it between them yet. John wants to leave him time.
Whitewater: the breaking of a wave where the water appears frothy, filled with bubbles. More strictly, referring to river's rapids where turbulence is so much that air is captured inside the water, forming an aerated and unstable current.
Four days after his brain had shut off, it almost did so again. He was sitting on the sofa, as John was putting Rosie to sleep, and his mind began to drift. He could not be John’s friend again. There was nothing he could possibly offer. This wasn’t like before, and it never could be. The pain that rose with the thoughts, the images, the words, it overwhelmed him, and the buzzing sound and venomous pool of liquid started to build up again. He startled to John calling his name. With awareness came fear, his every nerve paralyzed and cold. He had wanted to scream, or cry, or both. He felt trapped, and yet all he wanted, insanely so, was to be held, to feel his body through someone else’s grip. John understood somehow. He sat beside him, held his arm, squeezed. “I’m here”. It was an anchor. They had ended up talking about the weather, about silly things, that Sherlock would have normally scorned. He wasn’t strong enough to scorn now. John urged him on. Kept his mind on the surface, until the numbness eased away. The next day John had still smiled, and still lingered close.
John steels himself. Feet obsessively steady and slow as he steps up the stairs. The flat is quiet. Yet, he is tense. The impression of a soldier waiting for a grenade explosion. Only he doesn’t run
He gets up on soundless bare feet. Throws his blue dressing gown on, hiding the trackmark scars on his arms.
She gives a small, hesitant whine. He can almost smell the fear. She must have heard them shouting. She must have picked up their upset tones and now she’s afraid because she whined and drew attention to herself. John leans and picks her up with gentle fingers.
Note: depression anxiety can be a weird combo. And in any case, not one person will experience these mental health illnesses/struggles in the same way as another. Even symptoms can vary. No individual journey through this storm is more trivial than another.
Lots of kisses and love! <3 We're always on tumblr if you want to open discussions over there! Hope you'll continue to like this! ^^
And they do. John cleans her up -she had some signs of diarrhoea but not much- and Sherlock prepares her food -a second portion of Mrs Hudson’s healing soup, lots of broth. She accepts the syrup quite easily after some healthy, tasty bites of chicken -welcoming the slight sweetness, John supposes- and then once again closes her eyes without a sound, but overall, she appears to be pleased with her care.
under the same roof, sharing their every day, their small frustrations and small victories, share in the fascinating miracle that was every day of Rosie’s life. If then John would keep saying
He pulled his pyjamas on with sharp movements, growing impatient at the way his left hand would not obey him, long fingers wobbly and feeble in their grip.
“I… Um…” Sherlock turns the colourful book over in his hands. His eyes skim over the bright colours and large block letters, but can’t see, can’t read. The booklet is so small it is lost into his palms, and he can only feel its soft plastic.
Sherlock is looking at him. John knows. Even from the corner of his eyes, John knows. He knows because he feels it. Burning. Relentless. He knows because he feels Sherlock’s pain, Sherlock’s cursed knowledge being validated, becoming truth, spoken by the person that intended to leave him. Again. Forever.
. John lies. Their tones seem too much like their latest personal conversation for him to be able and utter the truth. He knows it might all go down a hill he’s not ready to face.
1. So, things happened this week and we decided to find facial hair references of our John and Sherlock. Here you go:
Her sing-song voice drills through his brain and makes him see stars. He stops walking. Let’s the rain seep into his clothes. His nape of neck wet.
“All is fine, little rose, Papa is going to check on Sherlock, okay?” he brushes her cheek and she nods, making his eyes go wide.
Sherlock takes in the press of the warm, calloused palm, its roughened skin. He wonders if John can feel it, every shiver, every moment Sherlock ached for this and thought he would never have it. “Yes” John’s thumb strokes over his stubble, scratching just that little bit.
Dawn breaks over London. A lazy flicker of light has John waking with a start; his throat too tight to breathe. It’s quiet, the rustle of his blankets as he sits up being the only sound in the room. The morning light has gentled out in the few moments it takes him to orient himself, dulled by the usual London clouds of late January. Rosie’s crib is illuminated by a faint halo, placed as it is closer to the window, giving him some semblance of familiarity.
His hands move with measured movements as he dresses her and she’s too weak to protest. She falls asleep there and he stays silent, soaking wet, looking at her. He would give everything he has to know what is wrong with him, to know how to fix it, to know how to… She doesn’t deserve his mess. She needs someone better.
He doesn’t get any response but he’s not sure he shouted loudly enough. His vision is narrowed down to the white door still standing.
Sherlock takes in the dark circles under John’s eyes, the tired, tight-lipped smile, the way he insists just to be over with it already.
? No, that was out of the question. How could Sherlock know when John will snap next? How could anyone? Plus, the former -for the moment- detective wouldn’t even discuss it -or anything regarding
He closes his eyes and there he is. The man he almost killed. The man he loves. The man that loves him? In that special way of never saying but knowing it is there… Taking blows, gasping yet not a single cry leaving his lips. Left looking down at his own blood. That man. After everything, that man held him close, comforted him.
“And you can… You can touch me too. If you want”, John adds, but it sounds like something he has been practising how to say.
“What about this gentleman, flower?” He kisses Rosie’s temple, getting her attention. She makes an inquisitive noise. “Can Sherlock and Papa guess where he lives, do you think?”
They nod to each other in silent agreement and Sherlock’s starlit gaze is enough for John to pass by the pub he frequents on his way to the bus station without noticing.
Sometimes he wishes John wasn’t so good at this. “Didn’t sleep much. I was”, he twists the thread over his index and tugs, “worried”.
"Hello, Rosie", he murmurs, keeping his voice low. "Long time no see...". She giggles, and pats his cheeks with her palms, before she gives him a loud, childish kiss on the chin, mwah sound and all. It makes him smile. "How are you? Hmm?" She looks at him and pouts even more before hugging his neck tight with a whine. Long fingers trembling, he presses her closer.
She kicks a little, and he can see the tears beginning to build up, her eyes glassing over, and any belief in him that he can do this, fades. Desperately, he does the only thing that has never failed before; presses their noses together. “Boop”
If yes, he didn’t know how he could bare it. There were words, promises, memories... in need of discussion, of explanation. He was patiently preparing himself to face it all. Even when his skin itched for a drop of alcohol. That was his goal. He thought that’s what ‘not easy’ meant. Those upcoming and necessary conversations. But this... An elongated, deep sigh left his lips as he leaned over the sink, supporting himself.
Sherlock is immobile, eyebrows doing that admirable tremble of joining but retracting at the same time, unsure.
“Goodnight, John”, he murmurs. He takes a step back, toward his bedroom, and closes the door between them.
A smile sweet as the dawn’s morning light, pink and azure painting up the sky in slow brush strokes, grows over Sherlock’s lips. John mirrors it.
With an exclamation of triumph, John takes a step back and admires his achievement of having put both socks on his daughter’s feet. “Right. All nice and clean”, he kisses the golden curls and straightens up. “Don’t tell me it’s already time for her lunch”, he realises with a wince.
John pauses, and when his eyes flick upwards, there is the faintest shimmer in them. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock pauses at the door, cup of steaming tea in hand. His voice was hardly more than a whisper, but the breathing pattern of the man in front of him pauses, and then changes with a groan. He watches as John shifts to his back, rubs a hand over his face. The dark circles under his eyes make him look five years older. He pushes his fringe back with sloppy, sleepy fingers. His silver hair, not washed yesterday to remove the gel, is now caked in product. It separates thin strands of tufts into ridges that glisten in the bleak winter sun pooling in from the window as John straightens up in bed, accompanied by the sounds of popping vertebrae as he flexes his spine.
you. Ever since I was out of rehab I have wanted to mend things between us. Have tried to contact you, to talk to you. And I am always brushed aside. Fair enough, it’s your choice, but what can
.” The words fall heavy like stones and quick as lightning bolts. “Your makeup is not the correct hue for your skin tone and yet you have applied copious amounts to it; it is required of you but you
There are many other similar lists with ways to find help, we just offered one as a start for anyone that may find it helpful.
“Mmmyeah, you are.” John smirks down at Sherlock, a hand brushing Rosie’s curls and another at Sherlock’s shoulder. ‘When did it get there?’ He flinches as if to remove it but so it stays, persistent, and he doesn’t mind.
“I haven’t greeted you properly today, have I?” John leans against the counter, a hand scratching his nape.
Another surprising experience. John is glad Sherlock is happy today, more than usual even. He waits until Sherlock comes back with his –‘Of course, what else?’- ginger biscuits before serving him more tea.
Now, there are no shadows, no deeply in thought expression. The features are sharper even, accentuated by the almost non-existent diet, the jawline fuzzy from the auburn over-growing stubble, the shoulders slightly fallen, teeth biting on the inside of his lips. John can almost feel them dig into his own, foggy metaphors from last night sure to make their existence known into his subconscious.
Sherlock does not register the thuds and scrapes of the boxes being pushed and pulled against concrete and wooden floor, or John's heavy breaths and grunting. It's the click of the door closing that spells it out for him, that whatever was about to happen is happening, after all.
John has stopped at the door, his jaw set, both fists coiled at his sides. All the warmth and tenderness has evaporated from him, leaving behind a man preparing for a fight, coiled like a spring.
Today Sherlock had been anything but. He had faced John, commanded him in a way John had never seen before. Or he had…
young. He hesitates mid-smile to remind her of the pink elephant they left behind as they have already reached the lowest step. Rosie will for sure seek for it later, but he can bring it down himself after breakfast.
When John walks in, there is a tired smile onto his face, warm if feeble, a dying ember’s breath. He has bags of groceries in his hands. “We were running out of milk”, he says. It’s all Sherlock can do not to collapse.
“What are you saying?” John has already lost his calm, fighting over a topic that he could never win anyway. And only now does she reveal the sting at the tail.
John looks up at him sharply, gaze hopeful. He hadn’t known. Rosie had been kind of better with him for less than two weeks.
“There we go, there we go, Rosie. I promise you, there is nothing to be afraid of, mm? Look at those bubbles? They are colourful because of the shampoo’s formula. The purple is your lavender, the yellow has citrus fragrances and the blue contains some natural sea iodine. Not enough to make your eyes sting, of course. You have never been to the sea, have you, Rosie? It’s beautiful, like, like- Well, it has the colour of your and your father’s eyes and it is like your bathtub but without the bubbles. Oh, and much, much bigger. Two-thirds-of-our-planet bigger. But see? The water here is shallow. Safe. There you go… Shh shh, I’ll hold you, it’s okay. Yes, that’s it. Very good, Rosie. Very good. You are being very brave. That’s it. Oh, want your pirate ship? There you go. It is not a bad replica, for a toy. It seems realistic enough. Yes, Mr. Duck wants to join in, of course, there he is…”
"John snarls. No. Just a dream. Is it a dream? No. This is reality. His feet find flesh. His fists find hair.  A yank. A throw. A tuft left between cold fingers. Dripping blood. One lonely ebony curl. No. A step back and he’s on the roof again"
As Sherlock is strapping Honeybee in her baby chair, John is already halfway through making her lunch, humming to the tune of a song Sherlock does not recognise. Sherlock watches him serve the mashed potatoes and peas in Rosie’s favourite plate, the one with Rapunzel’s smiling face on it, and draw a smiley face with the tip of Rosie’s spoon on the flattened puree, just as she likes. He joins them, still humming, and sits beside his daughter, placing the plate on her table. He helps Honeybee hold her little spoon, kisses her head in praise at the first bite, asks “alright, love?”, in that soft tone he keeps only for her, and then patiently corrects her grip on her spoon again, never losing his temper.
Sherlock remembers her text, spiky and angry. “She has her reasons”, he replies. They were never friends on a proper basis after all, and she was right; he abused her kindness, in no way can he amend the harm he’s done. He regrets most of all that this is keeping Honeybee away from her godmother. The two were close… He decides to text her later, that if she wishes to pass by to see Rosie, she only needs to text him when and he will make himself scarce.
John doesn’t object to the break in their walk. He dumps Rosie’s bag onto the bench and stretches his arms over his head.
That doesn’t mean John isn’t worried though. He had opened the higher cupboards, searching for the bitter taste of alcohol that shouldn’t be there, three times in an hour. Most than he had for a week. Of course, the cupboards were cleared and of course, he has at least that much self-control left to not go to the shops to find some.
Sherlock gets up, pulls his dressing gown on, and walks to the kitchen. The curtains in the sitting room are pulled to each side of the window; no need for a light then. He perches on his armchair and closes his eyes. There is a possibility John will come. But even if he doesn't, the possibility alone keeps him warm, lulls him with its anticipation.
How easily one wants to brag about the achievements of their child. John breaks the contact, a flush gathering over his cheeks. Chloe brings a contemplative finger to her face.
Their eyes meet. Sherlock’s are shining in secret glee. John breathes a chuckle. They are of course thinking about the same thing. The same moment of utter relief, utter joy, adrenaline pulsing through them both. The thought everything will be okay after all. It prevailed then, bloomed for the first time in their shared smiles. Before it was gone the next day… Sherlock still at a new hospital. Going through withdrawal alone. Mycroft not letting anyone see him like this. Mostly John. Especially John. John drunk at home, desperate. Thinking of how impossible it would be to have what they once did.
John breathes. She’s got him. Almost. Not quite. But the implication is clear enough and his breaths are stuttering. She doesn’t know. Doesn’t know him. Doesn’t know who he is, how he’s lived,
Sherlock has only felt as powerless only once before. When John’s eyes were on him, with the otherworldly under-water blue of the aquarium lighting his face eerily, his entire frame shaking with anger; You made a vow. You
Rosie is shocked silent, gasping, at the sudden pause of any movement. Sherlock gives a smile, but it wavers just a bit. John had come down a while ago. He honestly thought his friend was asleep tonight.
of January. His birthday. All because Sherlock Holmes was too trusting and too blind to see the truth. All because Sherlock believes in John Watson. The noble soldier. Always.
She made a face. He stood up, letting her play with the cutlery, filling the table with food. He’ll clean up before work. His shift started later today. It was almost nine in the morning. Sherlock hadn’t shown up yet. John had once again made breakfast, keeping it warm for him.
Even if there are still things he and John have not resolved, things that may as well never be brought up, it’s a friendship on both old and new foundations, and some things are better left alone if they are to move on, to find a new way of being who and what they used to be. But it’s a thrill. It’s a thrill he had said he would choose over nothing, and he was right, after all. He wants John in his life, he
How much? Notes or coins? How do tickets work, by journey, route, line? He keeps his gaze locked on the target and pushes through for what seems like an eon until, like a drowning man clutching to a raft, he has reached the first machine. Queue? Scanning the surroundings like a deer at headlights. No queue. Sigh of relief. Surely there is no queue? Blue, sweaty doubt. Okay, no queue. So, no one to watch and copy. What if there is a queue after him as he tries, and they look to him to watch and copy? Sherlock realizes that he may have been standing there like an idiot for too long and begins to follow the directions on the touch screen, feeling that his every movement is festered with crawling ants, that his hands are weighed down by millstones. Is he too slow? Too fast? Should he press confirm here? ‘Think, dammit, think!’ What if they're watching him? Bloke in a long overcoat, collar turned up, sunken-in face of a junkie, of course they're watching him. His eyes flick to the corners of his vision, left and then right, quickly left again. He feels someone behind him, and his left hand convulses. He shoves it into a pocket, worried that someone may call security if they see the tremble. ‘Weirdo’. ‘Freak’. Every whisper and word and laughter around him turn into a storm of crows that flocks around him and pecks at his clothes, his hair, his face. ‘John!’ But John isn’t here, he’s back there, far away, too far away- Come on, print the damned ticket already! There! He snatches it, is very careful to collect all change so that no coin falls to the ground and he'd have to either bend to pick it up or ignore it -and maybe have some idiot run after him to return it, so that he’ll have to face hot, red shame. He turns, breathless, fights to spot John amidst the crowd. Did he leave? Did he not wait? Had it taken so long? But no, god, there he is! He’s reading the Tube map and pointing the stops to Honeybee. Sherlock feels as if his body has been placed in cool, tender water. Now he only has to make it back. He hurries, ticket held tight in his gloved fingers, eyes locked on John's index as it paints an airy map of the Tube lines.
His breaths are quieter now. His chest raising and falling. Steady as he remembers. As he wonders. As he longs... Oh, that sweet Tchaikovsky he used to play more and more over Rosie’s crib those first months and the ones following. When John didn’t appreciate it. When M- “Mary” had left him with a baby alone. When John was angry...
“Where are you going?”, John calls when Sherlock is halfway to the kitchen. “Come here” His voice all but spells ‘git’, the way it does when he is amused, and fond.
The world tilts on its axis and John’s eyes water. He brings a hand to his mouth, muffling whatever was about to come out of his lips. His little Rose stands proudly in front of their fridge, a wide smile on her face, playful tufts falling over her temples. Her gaze so direct, straight to the camera of Sherlock’s phone -or more accurately, on Sherlock- that John has to steady himself on his examination bed. She’s happy and her small drawing that might seem so childish, amateur and clumsy to anyone else, is a masterpiece on her father’s eyes.
“Oh” Sherlock leans back on his chair, and motions for John to sit too. The physical aspect of things. His heart kicks like a frustrated horse. What does that refer to exactly? What is things, and what does John want to change, what does he-
Instead, he resists and aches and sweats, ended up on a feast of sweet food. Biscuits, cake, scones, chocolate. It hasn’t really helped but… in a way, it has. John grips the sink hard.
Much later, after two hectic hours of flu patients and two sprained ankles John feels his phone vibrating again inside his pocket. He hasn’t had time to check but now he does, already smiling at the thought of another text from Sherlock. The letters on the screen make his blood boil. He turns it to silent and buzzes in his next patient.
hadn’t even asked about her own child all the way back to London. Not until John had brought it up. Startling her out of whatever else she might be planning. With something as mundane as bedtime stories. She had looked so startled. So out of place.
The feeling is not new; John has done this before. To ground him. To reassure him. But this… This seems like something else entirely.
When there’s no response, John turns the knob, slow and careful; Sherlock’s door tends to creak badly sometimes. The curtains are drawn but John thinks they have been since yesterday so Sherlock must have simply not closed them last night. Grey light illuminates the jumbled covers and John can make out Sherlock’s curled up body under them, turned away from the door, only a lock of hair peeking from the edge of his duvet. He never quite understood how Sherlock could make himself seem so small. It is endearing and adorable and he’s… he’s just so… tiny. Like a child. Waves of protectiveness wash over John, just like they always did, but now he understands them better. His deeper, gentler feelings. He’s a father after all, there’s only so much a repressed soul can avoid and lock away. Not that it would ever matter if he showed this side of him to Sherlock. John can imagine his incredulous face if he ever tried to cuddle him, kiss his curls, maybe feel his warm sleepy skin… No. Yes. That would be ridiculous. He can see the small frown, indicating Sherlock is thinking of how to let him down easy. Still, the sight is just-
drinking again, and this can't have left his job unaffected. Leaving Rosie with a nanny often must have strained his income severely, too. Sharing a flat is more affordable. Even so, the sudden appearance at the time when he was scheduled to only visit (to keep Sherlock
“I- I thought I was at the bottom. I saw you. Right there. At the bottom too. Reaching for me and all I wanted was to respond even if I didn’t know how and I still had this… this rage inside me. I always did. My walls were up but… I wanted to reach back. So much.
love her. He never did. If that’s not a clever comeback, then what is? It’s cruel and sharp and painful and he’s shaking with his skin rubbed raw, clawed open bit by bit. He could never be the same with Sherlock looking at him. Just like that. That look. That damned look.
Eventually, Rosie was back at her cot. John swallowing the fact his hands were shaking too much for him to hold her steady for long. He sat at the edge of his bed, looked straight ahead. The morning light peeked through the light curtains of his window. His fingers were tight fists by then. He didn’t dare look. He could just see it in his mind’s eye already. His wrist shaky, fist aching from the strain.
Memories too far away but in need for remembering. Reconsideration. Itching inside of him. Clawing to the surface. ‘When he came back.’
Sherlock walks with his spine straightened sharply, as if he wanted to slice through the air around him, stride sure-footed, chin slightly raised. He must. For John. For Honeybee. He wants to appear strong and proud at their side. He doesn't want them to be ashamed to be escorted by him. John is already doing him a great honour by taking him with them.
I know we promised better things coming, but honestly... our boys have a long way to go. So here is a mix of fluff with pain <3 Enjoy!
She didn’t want him to elaborate. For the moment. Good. She wanted to know the cause. His smile fell, just so.
Sherlock had told him about her first attempt at speaking. Her mother was gone then. They were searching, trying to get ahead of her, every time the GPS showed a new location, signs of movement, anything. He remembers how he came back from work grumpy and irritated, how Sherlock had told him about her blabbing the same syllable all day since John left, how that syllable had been ‘Da’ and how Sherlock believed she was trying to say ‘Daddy’, calling on John. He remembers how he had scoffed, said there were more important things to do than teach her to call him ‘Daddy’ which he would hate no matter when it happened. Sherlock had fallen silent and John hadn’t bothered to tell him that he would prefer ‘Papa’. Sherlock never told him anything else after that.
It is Sherlock that does the lingering the next time. Hovering close to John’s shoulder when John is washing the dishes.
“If you need to leave. I don’t want to be late to… to stop you.” It starts small but grows bit by bit, drop by drop. “I know I probably don’t…” The veil of fear overcoming him. “…do enough. I was not-” And here it chokes him again. “…worthy of knowing why you left and still am not now, just…” John is shuddering. “I would like to know.” Heaving. “If you…” Shake. “Now…” Pant. “I couldn’t bare it if…” Sob.
A wail. Rosie. He frowns. Was she trying to get his attention all this while? A grumble leaves his lips.
There is a knock. He would have missed it was it not for every ounce of his alertness being bent on what could be outside. Sherlock takes the first step down the stairs hesitantly. There comes another knock, louder this time, as if decided. Or perhaps, resigned. It draws him closer.
Sherlock folds the memory away, back into the cupboard it came from. Memories like it used to be stored in his old room, which is now buried in debris, bricks and cracked paint, shattered glass and wooden shards. It’s a miracle how this one survived the disaster.
John just needed the raft of his better self; chances to be who he truly was, and who he wanted to be. It would work. It could work. In the morning, after their talk, things had been… if not normal, then better. Of course, John had been sick, and his body was worn with hangover, his eyes sunken in his face, the skin of his eyelids bluish as if beaten up, his face ashen, thin lips a pale line. But they had eaten lunch together, leftover chicken and rice, sticky and too-hot from the microwave. They sat side by side, and for once, Sherlock did not feel that shame-hot need to talk, to cover that chasm between them; John did not pity him. He was not expecting anything from him. He just wanted to be able to be John again, and Sherlock only had to let him. And he would. Of course he would. Somehow, just when he’d thought all was lost, he had a use again. Not only was John not pitying him, but Sherlock could be
221B is sleeping. Honeybee is asleep in her cot upstairs, for a much-needed afternoon nap. Sherlock is curled up on the couch, dressing gown thrown over him as a blanket, dozing off with the baby monitor beside the pillow under his head. He is stuffed as much as he can be with Mrs. Hudson’s roast. She does not cook for them on an everyday basis -far from it- but often shares afternoon tea with him when John comes home late, and sometimes helps with the cooking at lunchtime to give him more time if Rosie is being a little stroppy, or when she is being particularly energetic -like she was today.
They find it behind an old box for aftershave in one of the cupboards. Neither have any idea of how it ended up there but now everything is secured at the higher medicine cabinet as always. Sherlock goes to rest alone for a while and John goes back to Rosie, who apparently soothed by the quiet, has been attempting to finish her food. He smiles at her and she responds in kind before focusing on her little spoon again.
The desert shining in front of him, leaving him momentarily at a loss of breath. He recovers, swallows, focuses on the mantelpiece of the far wall, hums to himself, reassuring, making sure this is reality again.
“Sherlock?” And there is a scrambling John Watson, getting up on his knees and holding his wrist with a clenched jaw at the pain -a sprain, surely-, finally back to the present, back inside his working brain, looking over perplexed at a slick, wet and very much naked Sherlock Holmes, peeking from the filled with water bathtub’s edge.
He had not seen what happened. He had heard a crash, and when he had looked, Honeybee was hugging the leg of the kitchen table to stay on her feet, her eyes twin lakes with a stone dropped in their middle, concentric circles reaching out shakily. Half the tablecloth and its contents were strewn on the floor, the jam lid still wheeling away before it had hit the side of the doorframe and collapsed, after spinning around itself like a coin.
“I… I meant it. It changes nothing you don’t want to change. Okay? And… And you don’t have to decide now, and, and you don’t have to decide at all-”
. But there is only so much even he can resist. John is sun-bright, and impossible to reach, and Sherlock longs for him. He is bound to John, dancing in circles around him, a little bee tied on a string. He
Sherlock blinked at him in confusion. John caring was not new; all these days John had been caring for him indeed. But it had been distant. Not in a negative way; in a neutral way. Sherlock did not doubt the noble drive behind John’s actions but saw them as just a natural part of who John was. Ever the good doctor, trying to find his footing, do the right thing. It had nothing personal to do with Sherlock. Sherlock encouraged it anyway, encouraged John’s confidence, no matter how little it did to quench the need inside him, the need he couldn’t stifle. This, however, was
The bearing is hunched now, the stride impatient, the breaths shallow. John is heaving at the door, left hand clenched into a stone-like fist, lips drawn inwards, sternly pursed, jaw muscles bulging and disappearing like bubbles poking at the surface.
John’s fingers clench into fists. He’s working up to it. He can’t give her the satisfaction of seeing him defeated. He can’t let her believe she might win her childlike battle for dominance over a child she hasn’t even bothered to meet for years. Sober and all but she wasn’t even in Rosie’s christening and when Mary disappeared… where was dear big sister Harry then? Dear you-can-rely-on-me should-have-come-to-me? Where?!
“I know.” He frowns, just so. “Rosie needs it. Balance. In her life and the people she interacts with” His voice trails off.
Sherlock has never seen John be cold with Honeybee. He can imagine him being withdrawn out of fear of hurting her, or so exhausted and wasted that he could not bring himself to look at her in the eye.  But even if there have been ample times where he could lose his temper -and any other parent might have- John only snapped once, when Rosie had accidentally pulled the tablecloth and caused all the contents of the table to spill across the floor. But even then, he had not shouted
We apologise for the delay (there were so many things that have gone wrong these past two weeks, lol!), and will do our best to go back to the schedule of 1 chapter per week. However, a heads up. September is a super difficult month for both of us, with a ton of things to do and arrange. So, maybe we'll be a little late again, or perhaps the day of the update will change (from the Thursday that it has always been). We will do our best to keep you updated, and please also check our tumblrs for updates and more info. Good news is, that towards the end of the month we will begin to settle.
He grunts. Why did he have to do that? He hasn’t eaten so much in ages. He’s been careful with his diet since sobering up along with Sherlock. How could he think he could take this? And he has to fight with his head at the same time.
If there are alternate realities, then Sherlock has certainly, somehow, been transported into one of them. Perhaps he did drown. Lost his mind, without knowing when. Right. This won’t do.
“Yeah, there you go. Hooray!” He chuckles, noting how after a month of so, her palms won’t fit both into one of his. He cherishes the moment as it is. Here and now. Hopes to never forget it as he reaches for a hairbrush somewhere on the nightstand.
John’s breaths are huffs of humid air. He can’t control himself, coming down from the high of intense panic, of mental asphyxiation, of revelation upon revelation. Because of course he could pretend to be confident about all of this in the light of day, in his best moods, but not now. Not now. Now he needs… this. Exactly this. He just needs Sherlock. And Sherlock is here. Giving John all he needs.
Is it for Rosie’s good to be taken by social services? When she’s not opening up to almost anyone? When she needs constant encouragement? Because John can’t imagine the social services would give her to Harry in any case. Not that she would be a better choice than a home. So, she’d be in a home. Alone. Among strangers. How the hell does Harry think she’s helping exactly?
They both remained still for a moment. He with worry, but Honeybee with fear, crouching low over her baby table behind him, clutching the hand he held for her behind his back. It made the skin at the back of his neck crawl, the way she made no sound until the door downstairs was pulled shut, like the young of prey waiting for the danger to leave. Only then did she wail again, clutching his palm with both her hands.
Sometimes, John talks to him about it. Others, he doesn’t. Sherlock accepts words or silence equally and knows not to ask, not to press him about it.
No. John wouldn’t take that crap. Sherlock didn’t actually know him anymore. They weren’t the same as before. They never would be.
know for the second. John sees hollowed cheeks and bruised arms, needle marks and broken veins. He sees death by the doorstep and fire on the path to it. He sees blue eyes sparkling with red. Trembling fingers ghosting over the flames. Smoke and bits of wood marring dishevelled darkness of curls.
It must seem weird. Him, asking. He hadn’t asked any of the previous days when he walked in after work.
Something is different. The voice seems clearer. He pays no mind, grabs at his hair tight and pulls. Helpless. Can’t even be decent and respectful enough to his own self anymore.
He spits the word in disgust. For himself. For being what he is and still wanting to fool the man in front of him yet another time.
Harry turns to the side with slow movements, trying to face the object threatening her dominant stance as discreet as she can be, but Sherlock has already walked to his armchair by the fireplace, John’s side of the room, silk waving behind him as he easily flops on it, hands forming a triangle under his chin in intense contemplation.
Sherlock brings an arm around his ribs and fidgets. John takes a look around, noticing the open higher cabinets, the messed-up pill bottles, the spread-out expedition of a whole lot of them over the sink.
Sherlock is clenching his teeth so hard his jaw is sore. His breaths are so shallow they tear his chest raw. The tiniest sound is drilling through his ears to his brain, and he can’t think, he can’t bloody
“Little rose, please, please, Sherlock is sleeping well tonight, you mustn’t-” He freezes in place, his eyes blinking at Sherlock’s form, leaning against the mantelpiece.
The empty maw of a window gapes open in the wall in front of him. The glass is shattered, leaving a jagged zigzag of it only, at the bottom of the windowpane. Perched on it, their tiny, branch-like feet bleeding onto the glass, wait, huddled, a cluster of magpies. Their white is deathly pale, and the black of their iridescent feathers so inky it humbles the darkness. They notice him, small heads turning this way and that as they peer at him with one dark eye, then the other. Sherlock extends his hand to them. Magpies… He knows what they are, the memory almost transparent with age, intuitive in its knowledge. The only life left among the shadows. Seven…
They sober up. Fixing gazes at the flames. John watches the edge of one log becoming ash, dissolving into a pile of black charcoal. Empty. Dead. But able to be resurrected. If used right. Like a phoenix.
“We can run some. Just in case. I’ll prescribe the tests to you and refer you to a trustworthy clinic.” She tilts her head, waiting for confirmation.
“I’ll help you look. It’s all fine. We wouldn’t leave Rosie in the bathroom alone, even when everything is secure.”
She scrunches up her nose, looks down and mumbles. She’s being shy, a flower afraid to bloom too fast. Sherlock can’t suppress a chuckle and another kiss for her. “Show me, then?”, he prompts gently.
They’ve been relaxing, taking turns soothing or watching over Rosie, anxiously waiting for the twenty-four-hour mark of when her fever started falling. Sherlock is downstairs, waiting for John’s verdict. One more check up and John can safely promise to their little girl that she can sleep peacefully through the night with no interruption. John finds he is sweating, fingers slippery as he grips the cot’s bars, looking over at his little sleeping angel. She should be okay. He shouldn’t be so worried. As long as she closes another twenty-four hours without a fever at all tomorrow, she’s good to go, but he’s quite optimistic that she’s all done with the cold now already.
“John, no.” Sherlock tries to reach him, takes a step closer. But John is sinking. Sinking. Nothing can reach him.
A boulder to lean against, to take refuge beside. That’s what he wants to be; the shadow of the boulder than makes John feel safe.
Sherlock does not know if he did good, or not-good. He does not know what else to do, what else he should have done. The overwhelming urge to close and lock all doors, black out all windows, create a cocoon of the warm, familiar darkness of 221B, of what 221B used to be, preserve whatever traces of the past he can find, is consuming him. But the traces are rusty and unreliable. Over five years old. Memories blurry and black-rimmed at the edges.
“Well that was… That was something”, John says, gently, as if testing the silence, whether it will give or hold.
Cold. Frozen. John Watson muffles another sob. Rosie still asleep at the cot beside his bed. He knew the next part all too well. The desperation of wanting to feel. To surrender. For someone. Anyone. No. Not really… Not exactly
It’s silent. He watches as Sherlock swallows, as the muscles of that sharp jaw work. His lips purse, and their edges droop. He shakes his head minutely, and makes a small grimace, both eyebrows raised, an ironic smile on his lips. His tone is incredulous. Bitter. Trying and failing to act surprised -
“Okay. That’s quite fine.” Chloe is smiling. John blinks, confused. “Does Rosie have any hearing problems?”
Because it’s all until his eyes drift to the empty desk beside the window. The barely filled bookshelves beside the fireplace. The missing music stand over the rubbed off carpet. The non-existent violin. The tidy kitchen with science equipment nowhere to be found. It’s all until he sees...
He sits on his armchair -is it still his?- and waits with a mug of milk warming his shaky palms. He’s not hangover. Not today. But they’ll shake for a while. He purses his lips in contemplation. He doesn’t like it. One more thing he has to change.
A car door slams, and Sherlock pauses mid-stride, ears perking up like a startled cat's. He is holding his breath, and a small frown forms above his eyes. It softens when the engine jerks into life, and soon has unceremoniously carried the vehicle away.
“I mean… I’m here anyway. And… It’s… It’s a pain. Pills and physio and a diet and… I know it’s fucking dull, Sherlock. And it’s… It’s, yeah. It’s what I want to do”, he mumbles, and then clears his throat. His hands twist, palms rubbing together, then his left hand curls over the right and squeezes.
When he tiptoes back to the kitchen, he has managed not to rage on the towels. At least. The sight greeting him makes him stop short. There’s no one there. He takes a few more steps and… there they are. He almost breaks into a purely affectionate smile -like the ones he gives them after work- before remembering what has transpired. John stands there, baffled.
“John, anyone who assessed you would tell you that you are a high-risk case -or in danger of being one” She pushes forward. “You can do better”
He trailed to his armchair, sat down, and brought her little hands to his lips, the little hands that had meant no harm, and kissed over them again and again, until her tears dried, and a small shy smile bloomed on her lips.
First, he attempts to stand. On unsure as if new-born feet and wobbly knees. It doesn’t work. He slides down, not gracefully, long limbs no use to him, not now. He collects them to him with a soft gasp when he finds himself sitting on the floor. He cradles what is left of him, chest rising and falling like that of a terrified bird. He will try again; there is nothing to it. Sherlock cannot bear to wonder how it came to this.
He has miserably ploughed through a library’s worth of neuroscience articles and journals since January in attempt to find a lead to the problem of his mind. But he does not remember the last time he did something he enjoyed; solved a puzzle, uncovered a mystery, traced a pattern. Or even just reading. Learning. Feeling the rusty gears in his head turn and turn, faster and faster.
. For it could only ever be him. His Sherlock. Theirs. John just needs to pay attention after all. Like always. He’s starved for knowledge all his life. His brain has proven to be a sponge, always seeking more. Excitement, fear, danger. He can venture to the unknown again. Can learn to be the father she deserves.
Sherlock, judging that he has no part to take in this conversation, and wanting to distance himself from what is potentially a line of fire, rises slowly and circles behind Mrs. Hudson and towards his armchair, ready to tiptoe if he must.
John is the one who helps Honeybee eat, and he cleans her up afterwards before he rushes to get dressed for work.
“You would?” John turns to him, and this time his eyes are open but vulnerable. They make Sherlock’s body rigid with decisiveness, with the will to protect.
No insecurities. Not this time. His focus should be his little girl for this discussion. Not them. When Sherlock feels better, they can discuss
He wants more. He wants to shower him in eternity with kisses, as many as the ocean’s drops. But no. Each kiss will be singular. Savoured. Painfully savoured. Ephemera, wings fickle under the sun, a kaleidoscope of longing.
John pursed his lips. Nodded, sniffed. “Okay. Yeah. Okay”, he said. He looked away. His right hand flexed, something his right hand never did. Oh. The left was still curled around Sherlock’s palm. Sherlock felt quite like an idiot, and he wasn’t sure why. Sherlock’s own left hand was shaking, faintly. The weight above it kept it steady.
Working on John’s healing, not theirs, is the only way forward. All the other bridges have burned to cinders and collapsed long ago.
John moans again; loudly. Sherlock frowns, and then his eyes widen, only for a moment. He is quick to look away, recomposing himself almost -why and for what John does not know-, and ask “You like it that much?” with trepidation.
Mrs Hudson’s voice reaches him as if he were underwater. His head is a whirlwind, he can see doom marching his way, can feel its hand close around his throat. He has to tell John. Has to call John. Who is at his appointment. To tell him that his daughter has a fever, and that it’s possibly serious and that they might need to go to the hospital, and ask him what to do because he has no idea, or rather, does not trust himself to do anything at all. He is going to be a problem again, nothing but a problem, and he should have taken care of her yesterday, and thought about how to protect her better from a cold or flu or whatever this is -please not a flu, please not a flu!- and he has failed, oh god he has failed Honeybee, and if something bad happens to Honeybee, then…
But how can he prove anyone wrong? How can he prove Harry wrong? She isn’t his exception. But she can’t know that. Not in a million years. He can’t defend himself. Or else he might reveal just too much. There’s a reason he kept his life separate. A reason he ran away, but not after her. He didn’t need any more dictating of his life. He wasn’t going to be one of those poor young adults from abusive homes always needing someone over their head to function. No, no, he hated that foolish stereotype and he wasn’t going to give in. She would dictate his freedom while he needed a clean slate. He hadn’t let that happen. He won’t let her do it now either.
He could not have imagined what used to be. Yet now, bringing the fragile memories back, he’s cutting his hands on their edges of their doors, the last doors left standing in his mind.
Their gazes lock and there’s such unchecked sadness in Sherlock’s that John fears he’s going to drown for real this time.
John finds he is not anxious. He finds he is at a plane of utter peace. All because Sherlock sounds so…
John looks as if he was punched between the shoulder-blades. “No”, he whispers. “No”. And then “Bloody hell”.
He hands Sherlock his impromptu ice-pack, and they both hold their bags of frozen peas to their heads interchangeably for a couple of minutes as is proper but then focus on Rosie alone. It takes some coaxing and carefully crafted stories for Rosie to let them bathe her properly and wash her hair as well. She scrunches her nose when a bit of foam goes into her eyes but the shampoo is baby-safe for little sensitive eyes, and they just help her to wash it off without much fuss. She’s starting to feel more at ease, making small sounds while playing around her bubbly space with some of her toys and John can’t help but sigh with utmost relief. It was the worst torture to see her suffer because of his own incompetence all those previous bath times. He only ever wished for this. For something to change. And this is it.
“You can’t keep avoiding me forever, John” Her tone has calmed down, shifted from that frenetic red. Sherlock only finds it more suspicious.
The world stands still for an indefinite amount of moments before Sherlock nods, straightening to rest back on the headboard. John doesn’t need to do or say anything else. He watches as Sherlock has already picked up the knife again, with his right hand and proceeds to fix his breakfast. John only holds his bread and a scone steady as he butters them up; their hands remaining joined as they were.
“As I said this morning.” John sniffs. “I am glad you are.” His cheekbones and nose feel hot by the pressure of emotion and unshed tears.
“Yes, Mrs Trevor, your son is just fine. Make sure to take that cough syrup every two hours and watch him. Come back in two days if he’s not improving.”
“She’s been better. With me.” He mumbled, apologetic of not speaking directly about this particular bit before but she didn’t show any signs he should have.
“Oh”. That damned irony again. John grits his teeth and prepares to push forward once again. Sherlock cuts him off.
She cannot understand the exact words, not yet. But he makes sure she can understand and feel their tone, their meaning. And to leave no room for doubt, he kisses her blushing cheek.
When first he’d heard John’s voice, in Serbia, it was when an iron rod was slammed down his back, to warn him of what was to come; of when the same rod would be dipped in fire and fed with flame, to melt away his skin. Frustrated barking crowded him, like a pack of hungry wolves, with eyes burning yellow in the dark. And the voice had only been one thing. The one thing he had not heard for what seemed like forever, amidst dirty alleys, and half-collapsed hide-outs, and people without faces or name. One word.
John does. He raises his head, his eyes. He looks right into deep blue oceans, dark with the shadows of their waves that can surpass anything. And they do.
He is letting them down. He asked John to stay, and there is an ‘always’ he must honor. There is the company on sleepless nights which he must repay. Ensure the sharing of time and space over meals and tea, every moment that gives John solid ground beneath his feet. Spend time with his little bee, bask in every minute spent with her. He must
Keeping the thought and noting down the urgent need to discuss this with John, Sherlock checks the watch on his wrist. 17.00. So… John will be back in two hours at most. In Rosie’s schedule that means that she will have eaten dinner and will be ready for bed.
Sherlock finishes the last of his tea. For the first time in a long while, the emptiness in the flat is not absolute. It is the emptiness that will be lifted at the end of the day; with a small smile that will appear at the door, with the deep-sea eyes that will look at him, and
It hits. It’s there. Staring at him. Yet, his brain keeps telling him it shouldn’t be. Defence mechanisms scream at him. Close the walls, they say. Protect yourself. Break them apart, logic says. Get out. Out.
“Left or right?” John asks, an ever-present grin straining his zygomatic muscle for which he couldn’t care less.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in exasperation, but then something breaks his resolve, and he just sighs tiredly.
? Well, he did not know, and it seemed that was how it had to be, today. Sherlock’s pulse hammered in his throat.
There is clatter coming from the bathroom as John settles Rosie in her baby chair, making sure she feels comfortable. John glances towards the corridor, but nothing appears to be fairly alarming, so he turns his attention back to his little girl with a smile. She looks away, a pout already set over her tiny -rose like her name- lips.
Sherlock chews on the inside of his lower lip. It’s a puzzle, a human puzzle, pieces scattered all over the floor. And he has to somehow put them back together in functioning order. Or at the very least, help them find one. He tries not to think how he has failed already, as he reaches for John’s hand on the counter. It’s bandaged with a cotton white handkerchief, wine-red stains seeping through on the phalanges and knuckles.
John avoided to point the blame at her at the time. He hadn’t chosen this either. They hadn’t talked it through. He understood. He tried. He wasn’t made to be a father but he could give his best shot. He would. For Rosie. Her mother had made it clear though… she wasn’t planning to do so herself. Nah, not for her. And then she went and all of a sudden, everything changed. She threw herself in front of a bullet, something John would swear she was incapable of doing mere hours ago. Why the change? Why the sacrifice? Why… He couldn’t understand it. Even now. Couldn’t map it out.
The smile that blooms across Sherlock’s face is soft and easy. He nods. John grins in reply. “Unless you’re sleepy”, he adds.
They exchange a flitting look. Understanding passing between them. John takes in the dark circles under Sherlock’s eyes, his haunted look of acknowledgement for John’s nightmares even if he doesn’t mention it. He almost reaches up to touch his own face, sure he can feel the taut, dry skin splitting under his fingertips, just like the one of the man opposite him.
Oh, how she loves Sherlock. How she wants to be held by him, play with him, interact. Sherlock coos and she gurgles happily and although John had been downstairs then, he knew exactly what was going on. His head falling and his heart clenching. Another pint. Another bottle.
Sherlock strains his neck to look over his shoulder, lips pursed insistently closed. John would think he’d be excited but instead there’s a tiny wrinkle between his light eyebrows.
“Sherlock?” John’s fingers curl and twitch and stretch, nervous. This isn’t- it’s not- Sherlock isn’t-…
. It could be worse. Now at the very least John does not pity him and is not driven into this by guilt. So why can’t he just let it go? Why can’t he just be
They got back to 221B after that. Him and Rosie. Moved in. Needless hassle. Sherlock let them move back in, actually. John doesn’t even remember the look on his face when he showed up with the pushchair and the boxes. He was ashamed, looking at his feet. What an idiot. Coward.
She turns around, but she won’t be able to sleep again. John has watched her before. She can’t sleep again if she wakes in the morning. It’s about her time anyway, so that shouldn’t bother her in the long run. He makes a mental note that he left her alone without her elephant and without him either so that he can damper the pounding joy in his heart. He’s a father. He should focus on that. Too.
‘You lost this too.’ He recognises. As if speaking out loud. But it’s just a thought. Leading to another.
Sherlock nods, biting his lip. John’s palm brushes over his back, goes round and round and round in circles, tracing patterns. Sherlock’s breath eases a tad more, even though he averts his gaze.
“Hello.” She speaks with a low, smooth voice, made to communicate with children. “Dr Watson, I presume?”
Sherlock’s giggle brings John back to the present, clear as water stream, sparkling in the sun. The battle they’ve been watching has just ended and the contestants speak humorously with the judges and coach.
“Sherlock?” A finger brushes a circle over the shorter of Sherlock’s hair. “Sherlock, breathe for me? Please?”
Rosie hides again, mistrustful of the new facial characteristics she’s presented with. Doctor Chloe -John is so baffled by his own reactions he can’t even remember her last name, which he repeated to himself more than a thousand times already- steps down from her toes and back to her comfortable modern casual slip-ons and beams at all three of them.
“Nonsense, of course she wants a hug! Come here, darling, don’t listen to him calling you stroppy”, Mrs. Hudson coos, coaxing Honeybee into her arms.
until his face is submerged, and the pressure in his very soul is equal, until his ears truly can hear nothing but the beat of his heart. Slowing. Normal.
Sherlock stands up with reluctance, taking the penguin from John’s hand and holding it close to his chest. His face is a mask, impassive and pale, hiding so much underneath. It’s not as steady as it would be years ago. John can already see the cracks on the surface.
“I couldn’t ask for forgiveness. I couldn’t and shouldn’t expect it. I could never forgive myself either. If I asked and you offered it… Freely. I would hate myself all the more.”
He had fucked that up royally, hadn’t he? Because instead of talking, instead of asking, John Watson had gone and kissed the man. And did the rest later. Hadn’t that been a blast. But John can’t regret it for the world. The softness of two Cupid shaped lips, fluttering under his like small canaries trying to initiate flight. Yellow and warm feathers shaping around his own.
“Excuse me, missy, this is my home!”, Mrs Hudson’s exasperated and offended voice tries to trail after her.
And is terrified in this half-formed universe between past and present. He’s terrified it’s all a lie. It’s all going to happen again. The water was running before, wasn’t it?
“I wouldn’t because you don’t deserve pity, John”, Sherlock says patiently. “The situations you have found yourself in would be enough to break any lesser man”
This chapter meant to be even longer, but alas, we decided to move some scenes further down the line. Our initial writing plan for every chapter was 4k to 5k but we began to realise for the second week in a row, our lovely boys need more, need time, need love, and they are telling the story after all. So, poor us are going to have to adjust in order to accommodate both our boys and our Thursday updates properly from now on.
“Come on now…” John pulls him to rest on his shoulder, wrapping an arm around him carefully. “She’ll want it back in no time, you’ll see. There there…”
Sherlock stands, as carefully as he can with Honeybee latched onto his legs. John calls her over to him and she teeters her way there, squealing. For some moments, he’s at a loss as to what he should do and is left standing there, much like a hopeless scarecrow. Until muscle memory kicks in.
“Because all this… situation has been… Horrible”, she closes her eyes, as if the thought alone upsets her.
John’s book is resting on the kitchen table, its spine well-cracked. A hundred pages devoured only last night. When he passes by it, gentle fingers trace its cover as if in a silent kiss.
“Al’ight, ‘cause this is a social call, you know.” Greg nods and lightens the air again with a wink, going to kneel in front of Rosie’s table, face smoothing out to a fatherly one at once.
“That damned penguin?” Greg chuckles. “’Course I remember, you were crazy about it, a proper little married life mystery- Hang on, what does that have to do with…”
No. He can’t talk about any of it. It all had to wait. Had to be left alone for now. Remain words unspoken. A few more to join the rest flying in the air around them. Just for a while longer. Until he was ready.
“Want to watch something? Was thinking… maybe a film, this time? For the special occasion?”, John grins, remote in hand.
