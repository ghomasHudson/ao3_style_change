Lisa’s laugh is back, briefly, before she’s beaming at Dean in a thoughtful sort of way, “This sounds weird, but you remind me of my son.”
Playing dumb doesn't appease Benny, who doesn't explain. Cas tries, sounding more genuine, "Dean's a sore loser, but not violently so."
It was pathetic how his heart soared whenever a flutter of wings announced the arrival of an angel in the kitchen, but his excitement soured into fight-or-flight when he saw that it wasn’t Cas, but a goofy-looking tax-accountant type. Dean stuttered to his feet with a mild sway and tried to recall any sort of defense, settling for stammering a, “W-who are you?”
They don’t have much to talk about, after that. It seems Dean’s made up his mind, and Benny isn’t stupid enough to try and change it. And they’re both too much of a gentleman to gossip about their dates and besides, Dean is finally starting to get tired so he stands up, stretches and grabs his clothes off the floor.
Dean fixes him with a smile that melts some of the ice off his face, “So...how’d your date go?”
“Why me?” Dean doesn’t fully weigh what his words mean, just wonders why it’s up to him to do the angels’ dirty work again.
It was Cas’s turn to look uncomfortable, looking down at the tile-topped kitchen table where his hands lay, still now that he was finished with his coffee, “Well, to tell the truth, I would like to experience falling in love.”
“I don’t know…”
Dean throws the ball back just as easy, maybe a little far, because Cas jumps and arches back, splashing on his back as he catches it and sinking into the water. He stands and wipes the water from his eyes, lobbing it back towards Dean. Dean then throws it towards an unsuspecting Benny, who fumbles a bit but eventually catches it. Besides Cas, Benny is Dean’s favorite contestant, which is why he didn’t protest when Benny hoped in the water in hopes of joining their little game.
“You’re friendly this morning.” Cas says into his own mug, raising it up to his lips and Dean watches them curl around the rim, trying to look for any traces of a smile.
Lisa listens with sympathy and talks about her own father. She spends a lot of the meal talking about her son, Ben, too. Dean enjoys hearing about him and discovers he’s got a lot in common with Ben, so while the prospect of being a father might dissuade him at first, he’s surprisingly come around to it.
“Benny, have I ever told you how cool you are?” Dean tries instead, and he can see Benny’s mouth twitch towards a grin. Kevin and Cas, meanwhile, are watching the little display with smiles of their own, “I mean, damn. You’re just the coolest guy I’ve ever met.”
He can’t look. There sounds a nearly inaudible gasp, hushed under the hungry cameras, and Dean steels himself before dragging his gaze up and into Cassie’s eyes. He can’t fathom looking away. For a second, they both forget the cameras. Her eyebrows start knitting together with pain or confusion or longing or all of them at once. He almost breathes her name, it catches on his tongue like a worn key fitting into a new lock but he swallows it into silence.
“They…” Cas mutters, shaking his head like he’s deep in a conversation with himself and disagreeing with what he has to say, then stating, “His soul is in tatters.”
Dean nods, he obviously can’t say ‘no’, and in spite of himself is nervous. He taps his fingers against the seat of his chair as they fuss with the cameras. It’s painfully reminiscent of high school photoshoots and Dean feels out of his element.
Dean catches his lower lip on his teeth, mulling, “Well, did you give her a goodnight kiss?”
“Mortal?” Dean echoes.
Even for the iciness of the bathwater, any of Dean’s resentment towards Cas melts and, in its stead, warmth floods through him at finding Cas alive. His panic at escaping hasn’t subsided, but he’s so caught up in the moment he’s struck with the urge to yank Cas to him and kiss him.
Their group date for today is an adventure excursion that involves following a local guide on a five mile hike at an incline through the rain forest, and as they reach the summit that they’ve been traversing they’re surprised to see a zip-line setup to save them the trouble of going back down.
“I got a favor from one of the producers, I thought you should hear some real music.” Dean says, cheeky and nervous at the same time.
“Yes.”
“Of course it matters.” Cas is beginning to sound hostile. “Dean, you can’t have…”
Dean feels a little bruised but otherwise is okay, even if his ribs ache, but he eyes Cas’s battered face and the trickle of blood coming from his right temple courtesy of a particularly aggressive book. He clears his throat, “What the hell was that?”
Dean begins preparing the last drink, the ‘White Rabbit’, which involves espresso and several sweet-sounding ingredients that Dean adds hastily, maybe going a little heavy-handed on the butterscotch liqueur as he watches Cas to make sure he’s finishing up things alright.
Dean doesn’t have time to think of something before Benny is speaking, sounding more enthusiastic than he has all evening, “Let’s play FMK.”
“Were your brothers rude, or something?” Dean finishes his food in another bite, and wonders if it’s impolite to lick his fingertips.
The last seven contestants gather around the coffee table, with Benny, Cas, and Alfie sitting on the couch and Ketch, Micheal, Dean, and Ash sitting on the floor. They’re all stocked with drinks and a bag of potato chips is left opened and half-spilled so that everyone can partake, leaving greasy smudges on the cards as they get passed out.
His skeleton crumples to the ground but twitches as if to reassemble, so Dean uses the femur like a bat and smashes through the skull until the entire thing stops wiggling around and, when satisfied, throws the femur to Cas, “Cas!”
Bobby wrinkles his nose in the direction of the mug, “I’m not gonna pretend I can talk you out of doing something stupid, but you be careful, alright?”
Dean doesn’t know he has a guardian angel. Mary Winchester might’ve hoped, and Sam might’ve suspected, but only Castiel really knew: knew that he was meant to be here at the foot of Dean’s bed, watching over him as he slept like a sentinel. If only it were better circumstances. Sam is pissed, rightfully so, as he’s found out not only have he and Cas ventured into a different reality without him, but that Dean is now legally brain-dead.
"Oh. Am I?"
"I could, yes, back on Earth. I was able to scan humans' brainwaves to get the information. It's not possible to casually read a soul in any such manner," alright, this means that Dean can thirst all he wants without having to face the consequences— no, no, no! This means Cas is upset for a whole other unknown reason, and if Dean can't pull himself together and pay proper attention to this conversation he might lose all chances of ever getting that thirst quenched, and that just won't do. And it's not just about the thirst, of course. Right.

Dean thinks it's a good thing people don't actually know about heaven's existence. Earth's human population would drop, drastically, if they did. He tries not to think about all that existential bullshit too much, though.
"Well, we're— kind of famous," Dean looks very uncomfortable saying that.
are you alright?
[ Two women are standing in front of a huge pine tree, their backs to the camera. Jack's voice sounds from behind the camera.
"Great, thanks!" Dean pats Jack on the shoulder lightly, then looks around the kitchen. "You want me to make you something?"
am i the only one thinking these names sound familiar?
head for once? Because it only now occurs to him — Cas said he was falling, when he felt this way. He got all his angelic mojo back, now. Dean quickly let's go of the hand he was still holding.

i am simping for him so hard
Dean's face softens at that, and a more genuine smile touches his lips. "Of course I do, Jack. I like it as long as you like it, okay? And, uh, nice touch with, you know," he gestures awkwardly at Jack's feet, "—with the laces."
"Okay, you know what, what happened, happened. What about now? You said you wished you could have had me, as if... Don't you wish you could have me now?" And Dean is genuinely scared to hear an answer to that. He clenches his fists and braces himself for the worst.

Following
"Hello," the voice is deep and warm.
It's silent for a few seconds, but it almost feels like the dawning realisation could be heard. Finally, Dean speaks. It sounds like he's walking away.
"Excuse me," Patience turns to look sternly at Claire, "last time I checked these were mine? Shouldn't you ask me first?"
But that was then. As time passed, he realised that, maybe, Cas was avoiding
Dean sits on the pier, transfixed. Cas just stands there. And stands there. And stands there. Dean rolls his eyes and says, "Well don't just stand there all pretty, let's
"It was actually much shorter a time than I would've preferred," and yes, okay, Dean has walked right into that one, "I am very mad about you dying so young, Dean."
"You can go, Jack. She sounds very distressed, it must be important. And Dean would be delighted to help me finish with the dishes, I'm sure," when he talks about Dean a small smile appears on his face. It looks both soft and mischievous.
*wheeze*
"Oh, no, never," that instantly makes Dean more relaxed. Not that he could do anything if the answer was different. Dean takes a moment to breathe, and realizes that he can finally see Cas more clearly — not like a film damaged by overexposure, and— Dean is mesmerized. Cas is
, Dean steps forward, takes one of the smaller hands with an eye on the back of it into his own. It's still probably twice as big as his. He looks up at Cas, who's getting more and more curious. Brings Cas' hand up to his face and gives the palm a lightest kiss.
"Well, I do appreciate knowing that, Dean, but, as I said, I don't need a vessel here, and I can't really change my form in any way, so—"
Patience looks at him and Jack thinks. He does like the clothes he picked when Sam took him shopping, but, he supposes, things he wears do resemble Dean's and Sam's a lot. Claire scoots closer to him and pinches his plaid shirt with her fingers, tugging at it.
please leave a comment if:
"It's an app where you post short text messages that anyone can interact with. Just seeing your ugly mug isn't enough for them anymore, they want to talk to you now, too," Claire says distractedly as she taps furiously at his phone. Jack smiles a little at the insult — it always feels nice to know his sister likes him. He learned from Dean and Sam that insults is one of primary ways siblings show affection towards eachother, although he still isn't sure why that is.
"How do you know what it's like, then?" Dean is not sure if he's quite ready for that level of intimacy, yet. But later, who knows? He does, hopefully, have the whole of eternity to get there with Cas.
?" Dean thought nothing could ever surprise or bother him after facing God as the final boss (vampmimes notwithstanding), but this—
"Okay, but, uh. Okay. I swear I'm not tryin' to be an asshole here, Cas, but what is it you think you can't have?" Dean thinks Cas is kind of annoyed now, but he answers, finally. All of his eyes look upwards, as if he's looking for strength from above — which is funny, since they're already "above".
But his annoyance at the lousy morning falls away as he comes to appreciate that he’s in the beautiful Honduras, with crystalline waters and an idyllic weather that dissipates any of Dean’s storm clouds that might threaten to crowd the horizon. He’s smiling as he lays eyes on Lisa, dressed in a bubbly pink shirt that matches her cheery humor. He pulls her into a hug as greeting, trying to dodge the swell of nerves.
They sit on an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar house, the only homes being the ones they carry with themselves and with each other. Dean ignores the way his shoulder meets Cas’s or how Cas has crossed one leg over Dean’s outstretched ones; he misses his family and friends and his entire life, and it’s making him touchy. That’s all.
“It’s not about what you know, it’s about the connection.”
“Where the hell were you?” Dean asks, face going warm and red from the crowded atmosphere of the bar.
Michael, lounging on the couch and looking a little red-faced himself, peers over a magazine clutched in his claws and looks Cas coolly up and down, “I say drink up.”
But Cas wouldn’t wake. Dean couldn't surmise if it was an effect of the medicine or something else entirely, even as he assesses Cas physically for any other problems. He tries to squash down his rage, and his repulsion, but his eyes keep falling back to the spectral blue outline of a hand against Cas’s throat, the smattering of purple up his thighs, and the crescent-moon bite marks. Dean’s eyes sting and his fingers shake, gut-wrenched.
They nurse their respective heartaches on opposite sides of the room, and though Dean’s gaze doesn’t stray far from Cas for the entire night his eyes skiter away anytime Cas goes to look at him. Dean guesses they’re both waiting for the same big moment, and as Lisa is stolen away by each of the guys in turn Cas’s time on the show draws to a close.
The underside of Dean’s skin tingles like something’s trapped there, so he checks out the measly treadmill the hotel considers gym facilities exhausts himself by running until one of the show’s crew ushers him back to his room at curfew. After a quick shower he collapses into bed, trying to block out the light spilling in from his room’s window.
“Was it heaven?” Dean asks, suddenly remembering, “I thought only angels had the power to bring somebody back.”
Later that night, after the date, Dean decides to do some investigating. He sits down next to Benny where he’s playing solitaire across the living room’s coffee table. Discarded from earlier, Benny has a plate of picked-over nachos pushed to the edge of the table and helps himself to a stray chip as he eyes Benny’s game. Benny, noticing the company, sits back and mutters to Dean, “Got any suggestions?”
“Yes, bring us hope. Please.”
“Helping.” Cas retorts, frustratingly unhelpful and shocking both Dean and Bobby as he pushes his hand deeper and elicits a shout from Sam as he wriggles against his bedsheets in a frail effort to get away. Cas’s face is bent in concentration, his eyes almost falling shut as he studies something that only he can see, and announcing bleakly, “There’s something wrong with Sam’s soul.”
“Ugh...well, you know who I have to kill. And for the others…” Dean pauses, frowning as he thinks it over, “Damn, you really want me to fuck Cas, huh? Because I’d want to marry Lisa, of course.”
“I said to donate all of it. For me, too.” Sam tells him, then chuckles under his breath, “I guess it’s kinda fitting that we’re both gonna be gone.”
It’s different hugging Cassie. He draws her in quick and she startles, then relaxes in his embrace. He knows what Cassie smells like, knows how his hands meet the dips and swells of her. And yet he’s a stranger coming back. Unwelcomed in his own home.
For some reason, Dean’s gaze falls to the crappy motel-quality curtains lining the window of the room, quivering at their bottoms from the air conditioner being pumped into the room. It reminds him of how far away he is from his apartment, in that instant, because with the lights dimmed down and with the other contestants all asleep, when it’s just the two of them sitting here, it almost feels like they’re back home.
He and Caleb are led to a dining room and given tiny, ornate pins that read ‘Guest of Honor,’ whatever that means. Lord Berengerus slaps a hand to Caleb’s back, smiling, “I’m going to give Caleb the tour of the place myself, but my friend Baely here will show you around, and I’m sure you’ll find him to be excellent company!”
At this, Dean lunges forward. But he finds himself unable to move; it feels like something has wrapped itself around his midsection and refuses to let go, and as he looks down to see his hindrance he’s shocked to find shining silver threads of grace holding him to his place. Their glow must only be visible to Dean, who still flails to get closer to Cas, to save him as he bleeds into the water.
There’s also his feelings to consider. There’s only five contestants left after they said ‘adiós’ to Ash and Alfie, so at this stage Dean supposes he should be head over heels for Lisa, like Benny is. But, he does think he’s falling for Lisa and, besides, two grade-A douchebags are still walking around with the names Ketch and Micheal so Dean can’t exactly lower the quality of the dating pool.
This rings one of Cas’s bells, as he’s bringing his fingers up to tap soundlessly at the top of his thighs, “What do you want to know?”
Micheal gives a spineless laugh, “He played you.”
“Sure you do.” Dean says dismissively, still not turning to look at him.
“What are you doing?” Cas hisses without any real venom.
He rushes out of the shower and performs the Olympic equivalent of speed-drying before tossing on clean underwear, and the frenetic moment causes him to lose most of the gusto from earlier. He decides to forego his other clothes and strolls out, still towel-drying his hair. Lisa has also dressed-down, and in any other moment Dean might find her downright delectable sprawled out on the bed.
Dean can hear the launch and backflow of his heart sending too-warm blood underneath the slight of skin, flushed and rosy as he slides his fingertips under the expanse of elastic at Cas’s hips and begins to tug. He holds steady eye-contact with Cas, ready to stop if something seems wrong, but Cas just studies the whole thing unfolding with his tongue lapping at his lower lip, pupils blown wide.
“I said I liked it.” Cas chides gently, and gives Dean a small smile for real. It could barely be categorized as a grin but it’s there, lopsided and all, and it makes the stress of the day melt and slink away to become part of the floorboards, completely forgotten.
The lich is skeletal, like his goons earlier, but something tells Dean he’ll need more than just a firm kick to the head in order to take him down. He glows, eclipsing the torches in his illumination, and casts shadows on the walls around them from where he hovers above them, his staff holding another ball of fire that he reigns down upon them.
Dean struggles as Cas shoves Dean’s head underneath the chlorinated water of the pool, the surprise of the attack causing Dean to snort water up his nose. He emerges, coughing, shoving Cas away and cursing him playfully. Cas kicks off and dives towards the football floating next to them, which Dean tries to thwart by tackling Cas from behind. Cas is quick to flee and Dean only grabs ahold of his calf, Cas’s other leg slamming into Dean’s chest and forcing Dean to let go. Cas swims away, raising the football above his head triumphantly.
“You’re not falling for her, Dean!” Cas interrupts with a shout, “What are you staying for?”
“Dean.” said Cas, who’s glazed over with some unidentifiable emotion. He looks like he’s been hung out to dry.
Please just tell me that I’m still straight even though I’m doing this stuff with Cas, because I’m kinda freaking out. Wish I could hear your voice right now.
“He’s in prison. Rightfully so.” Cas’s expression is distant; he’s not in the pool with Dean at all, “He’s a teacher. Was a teacher. Gabriel and Balthazaar were the same age as my mom. She’s got Anna now, seventeen. Doesn’t know Anna’s met me, wants nothing to do with me.”
Dean’s answering whisper is a hoarse scratch against the wet heat, “I’m going swimming.”
“Zulges here is pretty rare, the only one in the entire province as far as I know.” She tells them.
Ash has been intrigued by their entire interaction, his eyes feasting on Dean and Cas’s faces though he plays it off mild interest, him being the dealer and all. The other players are similarly invested, hoping to see the tension between Cas and Dean come to a head especially because the pot is the largest it's been since the start of the game, each one of them refusing to back down. Ash takes longer than is needed to flip the last card, and everyone leans in to see what it will be.
Dean, though he secretly detests Michael, nods a little, “Look, even he agrees with me.”
Cas watches Sam scratch at his IV and resists the urge to shudder, “He’s not.”
Oh, great. For Dean that comparison can only conjure the image of airplanes and he finds himself fighting back a shudder. Still, when it’s his turn he goes bravely and death-grips the harness, squeezing his eyes shut as he steps off the platform and his stomach runs away from him.
“What?” Dean says, his mouth going dry, as his stomach drops to the floor,“You did?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m—” Dean starts, unsure of what he’s trying to say, then settles for swallowing it away and beginning anew, “What now?”
“You sneaky bastard, what would you do without me?” Benny teases, a smirk coming to light up his weary features.
“Thanks for the help.” The bartender says, but he doesn’t sound that grateful, “I’ll getchu a list of the families names, you can start by talking to them.”
“I’m—” He’s about to say something snarky, but is struck with a sudden paranoia that Cas will know he’s lying. Or deflecting. Back to being a bug under a microscope, maybe Cas has sussed out his mannerisms and is already reading Dean like a book. Dean opts for the truth, as close as he can put it, “My last relationship didn’t end very well. I was hoping to get back in the game.”
“Dean!” The voice practically growls, but Dean relaxes when he recognizes its owner.
“Hey, Cas?” He calls, interrupting Cas’s reading as Cas’s eyes fly wide.
“Can he live without a soul?” Asks Bobby, finally chiming in as the voice of reason in Dean’s relentless bargaining.
, laying on his back in a bathtub, unconscious and stripped down to his underwear. At first glance, Dean was sure he was dead. Cas’s skin was pale and grey, and he had deep bruises under his eyes, reminding Dean of the countless corpses he’d seen laid out across tables at the morgue. Still, Dean rushed to him, hissing as his fingertips hit the icy water Cas was partially submerged in. One of Cas’s wrists was slung over the edge of the tub, and hanging from it was some type of IV, made with an entirely different technology but having the same purpose of pumping Cas full of what Dean assumed was sedatives. Dean pulls it, wincing at the spurt of blood and watching the same golden liquid from before drip from its point, confirming his suspicions. He grabs at Cas’s shoulders, trying to jostle him awake, but he realizes the purpose of the cold water is to cool off Cas's raging fever.
Cas creeps towards the center of the room, where an ornate dagger lays unattended on the table. It’s beautiful, looking as if carved from something similar in color to amethyst, but which glimmers mystically with an untapped power. Cas reaches out to touch it and, despite its beauty, Dean gets a bad feeling in his gut as Cas’s fingertips brush the metal hilt and then pull away just as fast.
Dean’s throat feels dry as he thinks about them hearing his sappy, crooning version of the song he’d played like some lovesick fool even though he’d just meant it as a nice gesture, not a declaration of any sorts. But now, he figures, it’s supposed to be a declaration, and it feels all wrong knowing he sang it to Cas just earlier that day.
“Well, it’s just like—” Dean’s tongue curls across his bottom lip.
“The real me came all the way out here for a pretty girl. Pathetic, huh?” He remembers their argument, screaming up crows from houses over with bitter, angry caws of their own. They were so angry, burning out bright and fast and giving everything they had as an accelerant.
Dean rolls to a sitting position, disgusted with the angel that he had, for a time, cared about, “Sammy was dead! My brother had died, Cas! And I thought you were dead—Even now, I don’t know what’s going on. Sam’s sick, and we don’t know what brought him up, and—”
Cas gives him a small grin, picking up his beer bottle he’d been neglecting and holding it out towards Dean, suggesting a cheer, “To being friends.”
"O-kay. C'mon, then, let's finish the game...unless you two weren't done?" Benny's eyes flick between the two of them, looking like a chaperone.
Bobby had taken it better, knowing that whatever trouble they’d gotten into was probably Dean’s fault, too. As Cas explained where Dean’s soul was trapped, Bobby has just solemnly nodded along. And now he’d excused himself to delve into the books, looking as always for something that might help them, leaving Sam and Cas alone.
“Pediatric surgery.” Cas answers casually.
“Yes?” Dean says, hopeful.
Matilda looks to Cas, who has been practically mute throughout the duration of the interviews, and back to Dean before answering, “No. I mean, we had a little argument before he left, but…”
Cas goes along somewhat willingly, even if he spouts litanies about how, “We’re gonna get caught, Dean” and “You should just go back to your room.” Cas switches from complaining to standing, arms-crossed with a disapproving look that could rival Sammy’s as Dean loots an unattended maintenance cart and presents Cas with a single roll of masking tape. It’s the most exciting thing he’s done all night.
“I practically raised the kid, and he’s the only family I got besides my dad.” Dean wonders if Cas can hear how much he misses Sammy just from his tone of voice, “And you? You got any siblings?”
Sam had taken advantage of the ordeal to throw in a couple of swipes to the demon, just for kicks though he’d claimed it was an interrogation method. Dean hated seeing the way his smile curled so violently across his face, but hated more the way his energy had sapped out of him post-exorcism, sending him off to bed as one of his migraines came on again.
Dean studies his exact replica, resting peacefully on the frayed, eyesore-yellow bed sheets, and thinks that he’s never looked this good the countless times he’s died. Though it’s not technically a corpse and yet a hyper-realistic doll made from a little bit of blood Cas had taken from him earlier in order to harvest his “lifeforce,” something Cas had assured him he “wouldn’t miss.” It looked like it could leap from the bed at any moment and, knowing Dean’s luck, attack him, but Cas told him he didn’t know of any cases regarding people’s golems being aggressive towards their maker.
“Me?” Dean echoes weakly, and the blood in his body starts flooding to the tips of his ears, warming them up to a pink as he remembers what he’d just been up to with equal parts anger and embarrassment, and because he’s just remembered the rules he’s breaking.
thank you for reading!
“...It was you?” Dean blinks.
“You’re right.” He mutters, praying that the editors cut up this conversation so that it’s even passibly normal.
Dean reads the room, swallows, and strikes for lighthearted, “I was just telling Cas here that you looked handsome up on your horse, Michael.”
“That’s not a good story. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? You kiss your little crush before he dies?”
“Have a lot less fun, that’s for sure.” Dean remarks as he goes, closing the door behind him and smiling for a moment even as the darkness of the room overtakes him. He stares into it, let it overtake him as his eyes adjust and he’s able to make out the faint outline of his bed and the lights outside peeking in from underneath the heavy blackout curtains at the other end of the room. Everything blurs into a hazy shade of grey as he takes in one great gust of breath and lets it all fall out of him like a swirling mess of dust and sorrow.
“Dean.” Cas interrupts him, and Dean listens, for the strained urgency in Cas’s voice predicts something severe, “No, Dean. I wasn’t jealous of you.”
“Love?”
“You aren’t allowed to do that to us, to me! You’ve screwed us over so many times, Cas. You’ve hurt us by throwing yourself away, by coming into our family then leaving! You’re supposed to be my best friend!” Dean is yelling now, he’s so caught up in the moment, and he wishes that Castiel would just hit him or smite him or anything, really, instead of staring at him in way that Dean can’t help but to think, He loves me. He loves me. He loves me.
“Yeah, I mean fame, fun—”
“Were the two of you fighting?” Dean asks, trying to sound non-judgemental.
“What are you doing to him?” Dean barks, his concern for his brother overshadowing the former trust in his ally and friend.
“You had just lost Sam.” Cas’s voice is gentle, yet it’s heavy enough to stop Dean in his tracks.
“Quite the opposite. They’re quite free-spirited, though that’s landed them in trouble…” Cas trails off; he clearly has a complicated relationship with his brothers, “Gabriel adores snack food, actually. So much so that it’s turned me off of it, I guess.”
“C’mon, Cas, you just got here—” Sam starts, and then hisses as Cas preses a hand against his stomach. Sam curls backwards on instinct, head falling just short of his pillows, as his jaw clenches against Cas’s intrusion.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-“ Dean whispers.
“Yes, a reward.” She pauses, considering with a little tilt of her head. Then she grins, “There. Enjoy.”
Dean looks away, but he can feel Sam’s eyes on his face. Even now, after everything he’s been through, he looks for something in Dean’s expression. Dean doesn’t give it to him.
By the time filming wraps up, he’s pretty exhausted and relieved to get off the beach. Cas ended up falling asleep sprawled out on the sand, so Dean and Ketch silently agree on pouring a bucket of frigid seawater over his back in order to rouse him. He gives Dean the silent treatment as they part ways.
“It’s settled, then.” Benny says, already in route to the house, where he will announce they’re having a game.
“Thinking.”
“What?” Dean’s eyebrows shoot up, voice bewildered, “I’m not threatened by Cas. I want Lisa to end up with someone she loves, and if that happens with Cas and not me, well, I guess I’ll make my peace with it.”
“What?” Dean croaks hoarsely, as Cas moves to put himself between the screaming nurse and Dean.
sitting on the coffee table, seemingly reserved for him. Dean picks it up, feeling only a little emasculated, and flips through for something to do. At first, he thought the magazine was better than nothing but he’s about to change his mind when his fingers land on a ‘Are you REALLY best friends?’ quiz and he lets out a little snort.
Dean then sits, taking apart his guns for cleaning and reassembly, running a cloth over the metal in a familiar routine. It’s one that his fingers know well and are apt enough to do on their own, letting his mind go numb. If he tries hard enough, he can almost forget where he is as one hotel bleeds into the next and the monsters become a nebulous, writhing mass of evil in his mind. There are no breaks, not anymore, and he couldn’t stand them if he had them.
He can feel Cas’s cheeks rise as he grins, “I’m sorry that sex with me is so troubling.”
Dean doesn’t mourn that lost conversation, especially as the director who Dean now recognizes as Rowena, she seems to be somewhat of a top dog around here, is barking at them in a thick accent, “Everyone settle down! We’re about to start rolling.”
“What the hell, Cas?” Dean spits out through the pool water in his mouth as soon as they’re breathing air, not letting go for fear Cas might sink back to the bottom of the pool, “Didn’t know drinking would make you suicidally stupid.”
Cas thinks this question over, too, “Well, you’ve never met my brothers, of course, but I think they’d you better than they like me, if I’m being honest.”
The floor is so littered with furniture and people, many of them plastered themselves, that Dean half-prays as they pass over a wasted Garth lying asleep on the floor, Dean dragging Cas forward by a fistful of Cas’s wrinkled shirt. Cas, for his part, doesn’t fight it, instead he spews off various vulgarities mostly directed towards the other contestants.
Dean hates the pleasant fact-of-the-day delivery of Cas’s doings, hates how left-behind he feels, “I could’ve given you a hand, y’know.”
“Well, for me, too.” Dean can’t resist giving him a shit-eating grin, “So I don’t have to live with my best friend having a crap taste in music.”
In the morning the time for emotional hang-ups passes because the producers practically barge through his door and frantically fuss over him as he gets ready for his date and brief him on the day’s activities. He also has to sit through the worst sex-talk of his entire life, reminiscent of being a high-schooler, and he pulls a face nearly the entire time.
“What? He’s alright, besides his personality.” Benny defends his position, looking up with both his eyebrows raised like he’s challenging Dean to a counterpoint.
Benny looks at him, quirking an eyebrow, “Did you get an overnight date?”
Dean gives her somewhat of an awkward laugh, “Really? It’s a lot lamer than Honduras.”
“I was jealous of her.”
“Help me do a simple spell, a ward.” The magician explains, “I’ve got an unwanted admirer, and I was gonna do a spell to bolster my protection. I could use an extra set or two of hands.”
Benny looks at him a little disbelieving, and Dean feels his cheeks flare-up again on their own accord. He just told Benny he has a guy crush, for God’s sake. Benny speaks slowly, “Are you sure? I mean, the way you look at the guy…”
Dean swallows, battering back the sirens in his head. He follows them to a small room with a working set-up of monitors and technology that Dean doesn’t pretend to understand lining the walls. It’s clearly behind-the-scenes, and he’s not sure why he’s here as they direct him to sit down. Then, they pounce on him.
“The burger thing is good. Like, really good. And I’m sure music taste isn’t a deal-breaker.” Dean thinks Lisa might like someone who’s her polar opposite, “But, wait, you seriously don’t have a guilty pleasure food? A shitty, processed snack that you hate to love?”
“Dude, she’s like seven.”
“No, you were the one who tricked me!” Dean shoots back, his voice shaking as he realizes she might take Cas away from him yet again.
“What?” He says, blandly. He tries to ignore how Ketch and Benny are both also looking at him. The former with the same mild annoyance as Micheal and the second with something like alarm. Probably anxious that a fight will break out, Dean thinks.
“I was jealous.” Cas spits out, his thoughts miles ahead of Dean like he’s breaching some long-winded explanation, Dean scrambling to catch up.
It felt like something had changed. Dean looks around at the remaining  contestants with the same reverence found in the eyes of two strangers hunkering down under the awning of a bus stop during an unexpected storm, the kinship there unfounded and fleeting but nonetheless real. They stare back at him with the same. Something had  definitely changed.
“I can’t drop everything at your every inconvenience.” Cas says in that same measured voice Dean had gotten used to when he first met Soldier Castiel, heaven’s wind-up-toy.
Dean didn’t know what proving his worth would entail, but he went along with Cas dragging him to the bar, thinking whatever he had to do it couldn’t be too bad if there was drinking involved. The other patrons seem to lose interest, a bit, as they sit down but they are addressed by the bartender, a beefy guy who Dean saw was missing a finger as he poured two towering glasses of something that looked like a greenish beer.
And then, all that's hanging between them is the fact that Cas admitted his love. This comes raining down on Dean, who doesn't know how to respond without making an ass of himself. But in that moment, Dean gathers the little bits of faith he keeps securely tucked away and decides to just let himself feel. He throws in the towel, accepts the crumbling of his walls, and then there’s an amazing moment where he thinks, Cas loves me. And, I think love him. Of course we love each other, it’s been pretty damn obvious. And it has, for every laugh and smile and fight and death has proven time and time again that they care so deeply for each other.
"Fuck!" Dean yells and drops the phone. It lands on the counter. The picture is black, but the conversation is still audible.
"Why would you— in front of the kid! And when I was drinking!" Dean sounds scandalised, his voice is hoarse from coughing. Cas just laughs louder.
"I just realized. Even if you told me, back then, I don't think it would've done us any good, Dean. The empty would've swept me away the moment I registered the meaning of your words," and— shit. They were doomed right from the start, weren't they? But—
The bookshelves all have demon traps over them.

"You have such beautiful clothes," Jack says, watching as Patience holds a skirt to her body in  front of the mirror, then folds it neatly and puts in a stack with other skirts. "They're so colorful and bright. Dads usually wear things that are much more dark and muted."

"Of course, Jack, what was I thinking. We should probably buy the whole isle. Would that be enough to satisfy you?" Cas sounds absolutely deadpan.
"Okay! Now that has to boil for twelve minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to grate cheese and chop spinach and garlic!" Jack turns away from the stove and to the kitchen counter. It looks surprisingly clean compared to it's condition in the previous video.

“Asleep.” Dean says immediately, because he’s just come from seeing Cas off to bed, but pauses, “Uh, I think.”
“But you’re our leader. It’s your duty, unless you forget our mission?”
“Ash.”
Benny said he’d go for the right guy if the right guy came along. Maybe Cas is my right guy, but I don’t think I can do this with him forever. I can’t imagine telling Sam or Bobby or for fuck’s sake, my dad. It’s just one exception.
“You were acting upset.” Cas says, much calmer than he feels.
“Notes, magical artifacts, an indicator of the lich’s location, or anything interesting.” Cas tells him, looking distracted as he pulls out a table.
Cas’s eyes fly wide, and he leans away from Dean on instinct while Dean fills with horror. At first Cas’s brows come down, confused, and it’s like Dean can practically hear the gears turning in his head, and then his expression is dipped in anger, mouth parting like he’s about to yell.
Cas balances Dean’s head in between his two palms, looking into his eyes as they pull apart. He’s no longer crying, but the tears still pool on his face. He gives Dean a small smile with no fight left in it, "Okay."
“Pleasure doing business with you, Dean. Have fun on the other side.”
Dean tries to size-up his remaining opponents, and notices Cas is unexpectedly strategic. He knows Cas isn’t a gambler, but with a pinched, brooding face that betrays no emotion he scrutinizes the cards in his hands and folds more often than he bets, holding onto most of his money and taking away a few hands. Micheal is loose-fisted and aggressive when he thinks he has something, turning away most of the others except Ketch, who meets him enthusiastically. They both make away with big pots of money but their stacks dwindle over time. Benny is the most conservative, limping and wringing his hands before slapping his cards down in a fold. Dean thinks Ash is his greatest competition, going from announcing that he is folding at the start of each hand  to spree-betting, each change of play-style throwing off Dean and letting Ash win, all the while he talks nonchalantly to them like he couldn’t care less about the game.
"That's it!" ]
"Oh," Cas says after a slight pause, "But I'm still— I don't know how this could work, Dean," at that, Dean barely holds in a hysterical laugh. If only Cas could actually read his mind. Dean squeezes Cas' hand.

Castiel is nowhere to be seen, but Sam and Dean are sitting at one of the tables. They stop talking as soon as they notice Jack's approach and turn to look at him. Dean's face seems to go through several emotions at once, but then he speaks, his eyebrows high.
alright, I don't mind. Only if Jack actually wants to, though. Do you?"
"I'm... not sure what you mean, Dean. I can't... feel your emotions," and it's Dean's turn to be confused.
"Oh, I would love to, but you said no mojo in your kitchen, Dean." Jack manages to actually sound sincerely apologetic. Someone picks up the phone. It's probably Cas. The metal of the counter is covered in flour. There's a smudge of chocolate in the corner. Some of it seems to have stuck to the lens. "Shouldn't everyone respect—" video cuts off. ]
"Shut up, Dean," Cas moves his hand and takes the phone from Dean, who's still laughing. Last thing shown before the video ends is brown boots and a part of a shopping cart filled with colorful cereal boxes. ]

"I don't understand why you are making me do this, Dean. I did not think you enjoyed my suffering," and this is the moment all of Cas' eyes suddenly turn to the side — away from Dean. It's very disorienting.
"People in the comments to yesterday's video. It's the most views I've ever gotten! I love you, Jack, but that's completely unfair," she huffs and shoves some bacon into her mouth, angrily.
"Okay, uh, maybe a weird question, but do you have any smaller hands?" Cas' confusion grows, but he moves, and— Dean's breath catches. He even stumbles back a bit in surprise, but a strong, gentle hand on his waist keeps him from falling. What must be a few dozen hands are stretched out to him, all in different sizes — ranging from a couple close to the one he's currently standing on to several small, almost human-sized ones. Most with eyes on them. Concentrating very hard on not letting his imagination go

"How do I get myself a tiktok? People want me to have one, right? It could be fun!" The more he thinks about it, the more excited he gets by the idea. Claire spends a lot of her spare time on tiktok, and makes her own videos often. Jack thinks it would be a great way to understand her a little better.
"Yeah?" Dean's voice sounds slightly distant, like he's on the other side of the room.
"Exactly," Cas sounds smug as he says that.
Dean was crushed, heartbroken, absolutely devastated, when empty took Cas. It didn't cross his mind, then, to ponder the true nature of Cas' feelings. Dean knows that his own love for Cas is— it's not just romantic. He doesn't think the romantic part is all that important, honestly.

"No, Dean, that's not— I'm just... are you sure? How could you be— I must look rather like a horror to you," behind Cas' uncertainty, though, intrigue grows. Dean smiles.
"Impressive. Okay, Sammy? I think I know your answer but—" Sam's voice interrupts before Dean can finish the sentence.
[ "Alright, what about you, Eileen?"
"I mean. The last time we were in purgatory. I said I needed to tell you something, and you stopped me, told me you heard my prayer, and I thought you sort of just... Han Solo-ed me, you know?" Dean is the one who has to look away, now. The sun has long ago set, and the stars must have come out, but everything is illuminated by Cas, who's as bright as the sun, to Dean.

At the mall, Jack looks carefully at different clothes shops around him. He decides to explore one that has a mannequin dressed in style similar to what he tried out with the girls' help. Jack notices that Sam seems reluctant to follow and turns back to look at him, humming questioningly.
The pre-christmas meeting is to go as planned. 18.12 in the usual place.
"So, what are you going to cook, Jack?" Dean seems to be the camera man again.
[ Jack is filming himself on the front camera. In the background are treetops and a clear blue sky. The tips of his ears and nose are slightly red. He waves, his nails painted gold. His breath gets foggy when he speaks.
"I regret every decision I have even made in my entire life. From now on, Cas decides everything and I am just a 50s housewife, goodbye."
"No. Mojo-ing."
what he's seeing — who, to be exact. It's Cas. Of course it's Cas. Dean realises that he can feel it — literally. He just
"So, Dean. What did you wish to discuss with me?" It is in that moment that Dean notices. Beneath all the warm and fluffy feelings coming off Cas there's also something like— nervousness. And maybe fear? Or is it... disgust? It's very mild, so Dean can't put his finger on it, but it makes him panic more — what if Cas
"Well, you know. The whole "I am god" shtick."
"Oh, no, Dean, that's— it's completely different. I have but grazed your soul then. Got the barest glimpse of it's true vastness."
Cas moves, and light stretches in Dean's direction. A limb. It seems bigger and bigger the closer it gets, and Cas doesn't even need to step into the lake to reach Dean, just bend a little at whatever approximates a waste on his body, or form, or whatever. It stops in front of him, flat, just above the surface of water. It's a palm. There's an eye in the middle of it the size of a small pool. The surreality of the situation grows, as Dean recognises the exact color of the eye — he had way too many staring contests with Cas not to be intimately familiar with his eyes. He's confused, for a moment. Those were Jimmy's eyes, weren't they? And then it strikes him — the whole "eyes are a window to one's soul" is a lot more literal than he thought, apparently.
Jack smiles and speaks into his phone. "I'll be there in a second."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure whatever they told you was not nearly enough information. The most popular theories are that this is either an ARG or a PR campaign for some new show."
^^^this. there are tons of stories about real life supernatural encounters online.

"No. We do not eat the batter if it has raw eggs in it," Cas sounds like it's something that's happened before.
"But I thought this was urgent?" Jack frowns.
"I'm going to return it back where I took it from when the celebrations are over. It's bad enough I'm putting the stress of traveling on it, why mutilate it in such a horrible way?" Jack thought it was obvious they would just be borrowing the tree for a few nights.
know that. But most people around the world don't believe in the existence of supernatural. Come on, did these bitches educate you at all about how real world works?" Charlie puts her hands on her hips and stares intently above the camera.
"Thank you! Kaia suggested it, but I picked the color myself."
"Hey! These are amazing!" She takes something from Charlie's palm and shows it to the room. It's a heart-shaped, palm-sized lesbian pride flag with a thin string attached.

"Yeah, well, probably for the best," Dean mutters to the side, Jack barely catches the words. Dean straightens a bit and looks at Jack. "Anyway, what I wanted to say is, uh. You shouldn't show our faces on camera. Me, Sammy and Cas, I mean. I don't think you have yet, and I thought it's best if it stays that way."
Back in purgatory, Cas said that Dean doesn't need to say anything, that he heard Dean's prayer, right? So. So it would've made sense, then, for him to say "I love you, too", right? If the nature of his feelings was similar to Dean's.
Dean also hopes that, in case Cas feels his emotions the same way he feels Cas', his mortification overshadows the horniness.

"Two is enough, Jack, maybe let's go get some other things, too?"
"Pasta with cheese and spinach and a chocolate cake!" Jack is arranging food and cooking utensils as he speaks.
Later in the kitchen, when Jack is getting a banana for himself, Dean comes up to him.
[ Jack is standing in front of a kitchen counter. He's wearing a light green apron with smiling broccolis.
"I got a couple for you and Dean, too!" Charlie smiles and shows two similar hearts, only the patterns on them differ — one rainbow and one pink-purple-blue.

He concentrates and, without hanging up, appears in front of Claire. She jumps up from the windowsill and makes a weird sound, like a close-mouthed shout.
"Didn't you do it to me once already, though? When you got me out of hell?"
"Oh, Dean, there's nothing shameful in admitting that you're nervous. I wasn't aware you suffered from stage fright," slightly concerned but mostly teasing.
Jack keeps looking at the cereal boxes and hums. "No," he picks five more different boxes and dumps them into the cart.

"What Sam doesn't know Sam doesn't know."
“Hmm…” Dean strides to find balance between boring and dipping past personal boundaries, “What do you do for a living?”
“I’ll raise it to double.” Cas says, eliciting a gasp from both Benny and Ketch.
Cas tips his head back towards the ceiling, baring his throat and effectively hiding his face as he answers vaguely, “There’s been trouble in heaven.”
Dean thinks con artists are truly universal, even spilling over into different realms because of the innate selfishness woven into every living being he supposes. Luckily, he knows how to deal with them, “Yeah, on second thought I think we’ve got some bad info. C’mon, Cas, let’s find someone who can actually help us. Not some grimy kid.”
“We just wanted to talk–” Alphie starts as Max fidels with a keyboard, interrupting any conversation with a video.
Caleb enters the bathroom, his eyes flying wide as he sees Cas. Reeling around to Lord Berengerus behind him and exclaiming, “What’s this?”
“More like spectacular.” Dean corrects, “The trouble is that I’ve gotta head back before they kick me out.”
Castiel looks unsure of himself in Dean’s silence, and so he speaks, “I didn’t know if you were still awake. I just wanted to-”’
“I’m not against drinking, of course, but I’ve never done so in excess.” Cas uses his ankle to carefully flick water into Dean’s lap, coloring Dean’s shorts with tiny, dark blue spots that Dean is too preoccupied to fully notice.
“You two new in town, huh?” The guy’s voice was deeper than Cas’s and sounded distinctly like the rumbling of the impala. Dean supposed the most surprising thing about this ordeal so far is that they speak English, or at least he’s hearing English; there’s something about the guy’s words that don’t quite line up with his mouth, and Dean thinks it could be by the work of magic that they’re able to converse.
“Victor Hendrickson.” The harsh syllables whip automatic from his mouth, and it seems Dean has lost his interest because Victor doesn't tack on anything else, and Dean doesn’t press. Dean pegs him for a cop.
“He’s been back for a week.” Dean says, the accusation hefty on his tongue. He’s surprised at how easy his anger comes. In his defence, he was just startled from sleep.
Dean leaves them to their conversation, needing to get back to work lest he be a bad partner, and eventually Lisa moves on to the other contestants’ tables. Dean realized some time ago that he doesn’t get to speak to Lisa much on group dates, but just knows that she’ll be watching from afar to determine who she likes best, so he tries his best to have fun. Even in a competition like this, he’s happy to clown around with his friends while making drinks for a few hours even though it might not be the best tactical strategy in the long-run. Dean just hates suck-ups like Micheal who will interrupt everything just to make a passing comment to her, like having a couple extra seconds of contact will win over Lisa’s heart.
jshdhdhdjdjhdd oh my god i love you so much 😢😢
Dean quickly chops the spinach with the mastery of an actual chef. "Why did you even choose spinach in the first place? Why not bacon or something? Carbonara is always a good choice."
"So, what should we do now?" Patience asks. As reluctant as she was to agree in the beginning, other girls' enthusiasm seems to have infected her, too. "You should definitely hang out like this for a bit, feel it out."
[attached: picture of the impala on an empty road. On one side of the road is a pine forest, on the other is a field. The sky is dark with an oncoming storm, but it's not raining yet. Colors in the picture are deep and muted. It would not look out of place in a photo gallery.]

"I know you don't reciprocate my feelings, Dean. I know I have you as a friend, as family, but... that's not all the ways I wished I could have had you," and that's. That's very interesting. Dean's hope grows, even as his confusion does, too.
a. you have any suggestions re: what tiktok/tweet should jack make
"Hey, we should make a tiktok!" Clair exclaims suddenly.
"Hey, Cas. Hi, it's, uh— fuck, of course you know who it is. I was just wonderin' if— can we talk? No, do you want to talk? Cause if you don't, I don't wanna make you do anything you don't want to, I guess, but I'd— I'd really appreciate it if I could see you? Just this once, even. Just to know — know for myself, not from Bobby — that you're here, that you're fine. That you got out," Dean gets choked up a little at the end there, but no one is here to judge him, so he doesn't care.
"Oh, come o-on," Claire whines and stomps her feet on the floor in front of where she's sitting with her back to the bed. "I'd let him try some of my own but — and it hurts me to say this, and don't you dare tell Dean I did —  mine and Dean's wardrobe color schemes aren't that different. Pretty please, Patience! It's our responsibility as his big sisters!"
Jack looks at them sceptically. Dean appears to be trying to look encouraging, and Sam is switching between frowning at his brother and smiling awkwardly at Jack.
Patience's mood seems to turn a bit sour again. "Really? Why are you so obsessed with this app anyway? I wouldn't have pegged you as a tiktoker if I didn't know for a fact that you are one."
but also, what Cas just said—
"Hey, hey, no— no, Cas, come on, does it

"Okay! Okay. It's just weird to me, talking to the camera and all, alright? Uh, hi? Tiktok— people?" Second voice, Dean's, sounds both aggressive and unsure at the same time.
"Hey, Dean?"
"Jack, we've talked about this. No teleportation inside. And you've upset Miracle!" Cas, exasperated.
Dean stares into the eye. The eye stares back at him. Dean curses himself internally for being so slow and starts moving. Throws caution to the wind — he's dead, anyway, what's it matter — and jumps onto the palm. He feels it, then, a vague but strong feeling coming off of Cas. It's... affection. Dean feels his heart skip a beat. He looks back up at the whole of Cas. As he's being brought closer to his... heads? Faces? He's not sure, but they do become clearer.  One head is that of a lion. Another is of a bird, an eagle, most likely. Dean sees horns in the back — there's probably a head (or is it just a face, after all?) there, too, facing the other way. The face right in front of him looks like a mask with nine eye holes in two neat rows of four and five, but they're not

"I love cereal, but my dad Sam says it rots your teeth. I have to eat it during the night so he won't know." Camera turns back to show Jack, who puts a spoon of cereal in his mouth, briefly closes his eyes and crunches happily. ]

"Yes! But I didn't tell you about being on tiktok," Jack sounds confused.
"Kid, you sure you need cereal for that dinner?" Dean sounds like he's trying to hide his amusement.
why didn't you use the same username as on tiktok?

"But I'm god!" Jack whines. He also might or might not have stomped his foot slightly. It's hard to tell because his lower body is obscured by the counter, and the camera is shaking a bit. "I wasn't god last time! Come on, I'll make it so the eggs won't hurt me."
"Nuh-uh, no mojo-ing with the food in my kitchen, kid," Dean says from behind the camera.
"I'm not... sure I understand, Dean," Dean thinks about it for a moment. Looks around himself. Considers.
THIS. he's been taught about knives when he was a child? his grandfather tried to kill him?? he's barely comfortable with his sexuality even tho he has a child with another man???
"Are you okay, Sam?"
[ Jack is standing in front of a wall lit up with fairy lights, next to a closed door. He's wearing an oversized light blue sweater, the front of which is tucked into a yellow skirt, patterned with little daisies. On his feet are white crew socks and white velcro shoes. He smiles at the camera and waves, then does a little twirl that's enough to make the skirt flow. His nails are glittering gold in the fairy lights. ]
"Do you think this is a good Christmas tree?" He turns his head around to look at Dean, Cas and Charlie.
"You're— Cas, you're everything to me. You're my family, and you're my best friend, and I love you, and I—" Dean has to take a deep breath here, "in your own words, I lust for you," Cas' mood sours just a bit at that. Before Dean could ask, he looks to the side and speaks.
feel all the horniness he's projecting, doesn't like it, but still wants to stay polite about it? This is horrible, this is
When they finish what Claire called "setting up his profile", she gives his phone back with an instruction to "just write something so that they would stop bullying me already".
there you go fuckers, now leave me alone
oh my fucking god please let this be a tv series. imagine, so many lgbtq characters !!!!!!
. It was different back on Earth, even, but here, where Dean can literally feel Cas' emotions, he thinks it's only fair to share his own. And he's glad he did, because the reaction his words get out of Cas, it's— whatever feelings he managed to catch before, they were echoes, mere shadows of the love and
"Yes, Dean, I would also like to know why. Don't you know that forests all around the world are suffering as it is?" Cas looks intently at Dean.
Jack isn't sure where everyone is right now, just that most of them are out. He looks at his dads. They're looking at each other, seemingly engrossed in a silent conversation. Jack looks at Charlie, who shrugs at him awkwardly. Finally, Dean sighs and speaks.
"No, of course, not at all. And I'm sure Dean and Cas don't mind either."
Cas right there to see, and treasure, and love.
Best hunt of the year! pt.1
Merry Christmas to everyone who celebrates!
"What do you mean, you can't? Isn't this like. Part of the whole angel mojo? Cause I can— I can feel some of your emotions. It's kinda vague, but it's there," Cas turns thoughtful at that. He tilts his head to the side again, all eyes narrowing. A... hand, comes up to hold his chin. It shines bright purple, and looks humanoid, even though it has weird proportions — all slender and knobbly. And it has claws, how did Dean not notice the claws right away? His mind jumps to wondering what they'd feel like on his skin— Cas' hand drops away from his face, and he turns all his attention back to Dean.
Both Jack and Cas turn to Dean.
"Je-esus. I'm never getting used to this. Couldn't you teleport outside and come through the door?"
i wish i had parents as supportive as yours( mine would never agree to act for a tiktok lmao
"What? Of course n— wait, why is your phone— don't you dare post that on the internet!"
"I'm not— I don't— Shut up, Cas!"
excuse me I am just crying in a corner over deancas holding hands
She turns her anger to Cas, “You! You did this!”
“Yeah, it is.” She breathes, “But, I’m here trying to find a father figure for him.”
“No.” Cas looks forlorn, like he’s confessing a failure.
“But what if he loves you?” The voice taunts, “If you kiss him and he loves you, he’ll wake.”
They begin to climb into the rockier, more dangerous ledges of the mountainside and Dean feels himself becoming dizzy with the altitude. Growing at this height are plants Dean has never seen, such as flowers that open and close like they’re respiring and strange, silver ferns that form big loops reminiscent of a stretch of barbed wire. Turning the corner, they’re met with the most baffling sight of all: muscular, angry-looking hogs with underbites so severe their entire row of teeth hangs out of their mouth fit with gleaming, ferocious tusks. As soon as they’re spotted, the hogs rush them, squealing as they make their attack.
“Had a pipe burst in my room.” He explains, blinking the sleep from his eyes and looking Dean over, trying to piece something together, “What about you?”
Dean didn’t expect to get this far, if he’s being honest. But he’s beginning to think he could have a real chance to win and marry Lisa. It’s just up to him to decide if that’s what he really wants, he guesses he has a chance to decide that on today’s date.
Dean’s face grows rosy in a way he can’t blame on the sunshine.
“I’m stuck.” Benny says, sounding pained.
“This thing is giving me the creeps, are you almost ready?” Dean ventures, growing impatient from where he waits on a greyish brown chair by the door.
Dean doesn’t respond and the whole ordeal turns into more of a hug with Cas’s arms loosely enveloping Dean as Dean stills. Dean doesn’t think, just turns, his lips landing at the corner of Cas’s mouth in a curt kiss. He pulls away before it can become anything else and diverts his attention back to stirring the mixture in the bowl.
“Okay, fine.” Dean gives up his share of that territory, moving on to better guard his remaining turf. He looks away, this whole heart-to-heart in the middle of a shitty hotel hallway that looks the same as any shitty hotel hallway except that Dean’s in a whole different country making him want to shut his eyes and just fall endlessly into sleep, “But that doesn’t mean I could fall in love with him or anything. It’s just a guy-crush, or something.”
“You’re too scared to really tell me, then?” Michael crosses his arms with a little huff.
Cas gives him an unamused face, “Option 3, then.”
“It’s already over.” Dean says flatly. He doesn’t feel real anymore, and a weird complacency settles over him, “Cas is gonna leave tonight.”
