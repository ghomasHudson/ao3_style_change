John kneeled behind Sherlock so that his knees were pressed to either side of Sherlock's hips, just inches away from their bodies curving together. "Hands on your lap," he murmured, brushing his lips against Sherlock's neck, his hands coming to rest on his shoulders.
"I did this once when I was younger. I was bullied some, obviously, and Mycroft did this with me. Cathartic, I think they called it," Sherlock said, handing John a plate and picking one up for himself. He looked at John, pressing a small kiss to his cheek. "It's for you," he said, nodding towards the box before spinning and hurling the plate across the room into the empty corner where it smashed and shattered.
Sherlock nodded, sighing softly. "Yeah... of course it will," he said with a small smile, letting Katherine slide off his lap, where she settled on the floor, playing with the toys she'd received. He wet his lips, leaning against John and resting his head on his shoulder. "Perfectly fine."
John hit Sherlock in the shoulder, hard. "You disappeared for two years!" he all but screamed, ripping at his own hair. "You could have sent a bloody postcard or something." Anything. Anything would have been better than walking around blaming himself. "Your daughter doesn't even know you exist now!" His voice broke, and he shook his head, rolling over because he couldn't look at Sherlock.
John gently rubbed Sherlock's shoulders, nuzzling against his jaw and kissing his pulse. "I've got you," he finally murmured, though it felt more like they were holding each other up.
Sherlock hummed, looking down at Hamish. “Mm…alright,” he murmured. He sighed softly, reaching over to pet down Katherine’s hair. “Katty girl, baby it’s time to get up. You can’t sleep all day.”
Sherlock sighed. "It won't... it won't help John," he said quietly. "It won't make it stop hurting, whatever it is," he said.
Sherlock avoided John's eyes for a moment, only flicking his vision to him occasionally while he spoke. "But what if something happens? She's getting a cold, what if she has a nightmare?" he asked, starting to feel more anxious about leaving than he thought. Her bear, that was their bedtime routine... it never occurred to him how hard he might find it to leave her.
John shoved down the small amount of shock that rose on his face when Katherine mentioned the hair. He met Sherlock's gaze as he tugged on his jacket and snatched up his wallet and keys. How was it possible that Katty could actually remember? She had hardly been a year old at the time.
John's stomach dropped, but he shook his head. "I don't know. It shouldn't be," he said softly, walking over to Sherlock and sitting down beside him.
Katherine smiled, not noticing the slight change in John, Sherlock however saw it immediately and nudged John's foot gently with his own, trying to comfort him without letting Katherine know that there was anything else wrong. He started eating his food, despite not wanting to at all, he wasn't eating for himself anymore and he wouldn't dare refuse food with John looking at him. He ate the entire plate, feeling almost sick by the time he'd finished, but he almost always felt sick anyway. "I've had my eye on a couple different schools here in the city, good curriculum and class size. And I'm fairly certain that most of their teachers aren't complete idiots so that's good."
John smiled, nuzzling against the back of Sherlock's neck. "I love you, too," he murmured. "Kat and I are going shopping tomorrow for your birthday present," he said, pressing his palm over Sherlock's heart. "So you'll have to preoccupy yourself for a couple hours by yourself."
Sherlock watched John carefully, seeing him already in the posture of when he came back home. It had taken a couple months before he seemed to relax all the way. He sighed, resting his head on John's shoulder, hoping his proximity helped him relax. "After, we should get some lunch maybe... get you something a bit more than chocolate," he murmured. He almost suggested more shopping for Katherine – three months wasn't a lot of time to get everything done – but he was quiet on that point.
John woke up in a hospital with too much noise and too many drips and IVs attached to him. He knew why, and he still hurt, despite the morphine levels he knew had to be pumping through him. "Sherlock..." he groaned, turning instead to see one of the doctors that he had come to know. She told him how lucky he was to be alive, that they found him barely hanging on, but he didn't hear any of it. He didn't care. "I want my computer," he demanded, and he wouldn't hear another word or take any medication--even going as far as threatening to disconnect his IVs--until she finally agreed.
"I'll try to come back in one piece this time," he whispered, nuzzling against Sherlock's neck and scenting him. Sherlock let out a relieved breath when John took him up close. He sighed, managing to smile a small bit.
John smiled a little, kissing the tip of Sherlock's nose and jumping on the subject change. "I want a blond next time, so you had better work on that," he teased. "Boy, too, preferably. More your eyes than mine, though." He touched his finger to the tip of Katherine's nose. "Not that you're not perfect, Kat, but I can hope, can't I?"
John cracked his eyes open at the sound of Stephen's voice. He could barely see, his vision foggy from blood loss. He could feel himself dying – his heart rate was slowed severely, his breathing shallow and raspy.
John made a small noise, leaning up to look at Sherlock directly, his fingers still resting on the crook of his arms. "Sorry," he murmured, ducking his head down for a moment. "I wasn't really thinking."
Sherlock stepped into the room then, holding a now awake Hamish. He eased into bed, settling the infant down onto his chest. "Hey Katty girl," he said softly, patting her side.
John moved closer to Sherlock, nuzzling against his neck – where his scent was strongest – and inhaling. He hummed quietly, pressing his lips to Sherlock's pulse before he caught himself and pulled away. "Yeah. You smell like you again. But... stronger."
. They're not allowed to get too personal, and I'll stop them if they do. They're going to ask about eating habits and things that are going to potentially affect the growth of the pup."
John gasped around his bruised collarbone, blinking his eyes free of the dribble of blood in them. "Check in!" he called, his voice rough and scratchy. Amelia replied, and so did Adam from the back. "Demitri, you hurt?" John asked. There wasn't a reply. "Adam, check on him," he commanded, dropping rank and formality in his shock.
Sherlock stood up and moved over to the stove. He looked at the spoon John used to stir and lifted it to taste. "It's good," he said with a nod.  "And I don't think I have to cook for you, I just felt you did more today," he said.
He pushed out of bed, making for the bathroom and kneeling down in front of the toilet just in time to get sick. He grimaced at the taste, flushing the toilet and leaning back against the wall. Lovely, he had what Kat had. Sherlock was probably going to get it too, now. He groaned, pressing a hand to his stomach as he leant forward and threw up again.
John didn't notice the tears that were pouring down his face. All he felt was the gaping ache that was consuming him as he clung tighter to Sherlock, burying his face in the crook of his neck. He sobbed, and the sound was more wounded than anything, because he knew it was his fault that Sherlock was begging, his fault that Sherlock was so upset. "I'm so sorry," he cried, clinging tighter to his mate as the guilty ache ripped through him.
"Here," he said, standing up and making his way into the kitchen. He poured two glasses of red wine and brought them back out into the living room. "Happy Christmas Eve, love," he murmured, handing Sherlock a glass and kissing his cheek.
"I'm fine," John whispered, wrapping his arm around Sherlock's waist and pulling him closer. He wasn't hungry, and it had taken a bit of effort to even eat the chocolate. He wasn't sure why it was affecting him so badly, this visit, until they were nearly at the flower shop. "PTSD is kicking in," he murmured, squeezing Sherlock's hand as he paid the cabbie and stepped outside. He could tell that his posture was stiff, formal, but he couldn't help it. It was a natural reaction to stress.
John smirked, setting his hands on Katherine's sides and steadying her. "Come on, sweetie, you can do it," he murmured, grinning as she took a step forward. "There you go," he encouraged, smiling up at Sherlock. "Come on, Katty, you got this." She took another couple of steps, and John loosened his hold until his hands weren't there and she was going on her own.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock turned his head away from the glass at first, but his throat was dry, and he looked down at the milk. He sighed, taking a small sip of it, the milk almost felt thick moving down his throat. He winced as he shifted again.
John smirked at Sherlock, combing through Katty's hair and tucking a few stray curls behind her ear. "You know baby, Santa comes faster if you sleep," he murmured. "He has a special kind of magic that lets him know who's asleep, and he goes to their houses first." He gave a half shrug to Sherlock, hoping that Katherine believed him.
Sherlock sighed, moving into the bedroom to take his pill and then returned to the living room. He saw a television, though had no desire to watch anything, not that he ever really had before. Seeing a radio, he turned it on, finding a classical station. He shut his eyes as a familiar piece came on.
John knew it wouldn't help, but it would make him feel better. "I don't think anyone would mind if you have a little bit of alcohol in your hot chocolate," he muttered, but he was already deterred from the idea.
Sherlock was trembling a little, not sure where the almost panicky feeling had come from. Out of nowhere, it would seem, but it was probably chemical imbalance, he rationalised, but that didn't make it go away, knowing what it was. He took gulping breaths, dry heaving a few times, though his toast was no longer in his stomach to toss up.
John almost broke down right there, circling his arms around Sherlock's waist and holding onto him tightly. "So do I. I-I don't like feeling so out of control. Like I could hurt you – for real next time." He shuddered at the thought, silently damning Moriarty to the very depths of hell.
Sherlock nodded, seeing right past John's face. He sighed softly, reaching over and giving John's hand a squeeze. "I think Katty and you will both like them," he said, smiling over at her, and then John. We'll be okay, John...I promise, he thought, trying to convey the thought with his gaze, giving another reassuring squeeze.
"I'm perfectly fine I just... family interaction is not something I've been around a lot recently... and with my own before, well, it was different," Sherlock said, not mentioning that purely social interaction was something he didn't really know how to do, either.
"How are you both feeling?" Maria asked softly, setting her items aside and walking up to check on Sherlock's vitals, which were pretty much back to normal.
Sherlock looked at it. "See, a normal person finds a phone and gets a message like that, they ignore it. But the killer... would panic," he said, smiling.
, he whispered, over and over in his head, but he couldn't form the words, afraid that if he opened his mouth, he would do nothing but scream.
Sherlock sighed, watching John walk out of the room and following a bit behind, lingering in the hallway.
Sherlock cried out when John pushed into him, moaning softly as he did so, not wanting to wake up Katherine. He bit down on his lip, and tried to roll up his hips for some friction. "A-almost anything," he panted, knowing that the one thing he really wanted from John, John couldn't give him.
Sherlock took the plate, looking at the food. He glanced up at John, then picked up half of the sandwich, taking a small bite and chewing slowly.
He stopped for a moment, pressing the heels of his hands hard into his eyes, and leaned his back against a wall.
John smiled, knowing that he shouldn't feel so smug about being so important to Sherlock, but he couldn't help it. There was something about being the center of someone's world that was very... warming. He didn't say anything for a long time, letting their more tender and volatile emotions wind down a little before he pulled back a little from Sherlock so that he could speak. "I don't want to go through what we went through last time," he murmured, staring a little blankly at the wall behind Sherlock. "We have kids now that we need to protect. You... I think you need to know everything that happened to me over there," he said quietly, absently running his thumb over Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock hated this, but it had to be done. He made their tea, pausing a moment before slipping the sedative he'd hidden in the kitchen into John's tea. It tore his heart out of his chest to do it, but he had to. To protect John, and to make sure he didn't follow Sherlock, or stop him all together. It was enough... John would wake up in the morning... right on schedule no doubt to follow him, once the stage was set.
Sherlock settled back more into the bed with a small sigh. "Of course not," he murmured quietly, brushing a bit of hair out of John's face, exposing his forehead more and blowing on it gently. "You sleep," he ordered gently.
The Beta that had led John over growled in annoyance. “Got other things to do, hurry along for the man!” he said shortly, taking up Sherlock’s leash and yanking it. Sherlock pitched forward and fell onto his chest on the floor, wincing at the pain in his side, his head spinning. He didn’t move, eyes closing again as he lost consciousness.
Sherlock tensed a small bit as he thought back to the times before, his mind going where he didn't want it to. He was breathing heavily when he felt John stop, waiting for him, he supposed. Sherlock took a moment to bring himself back to now, not thinking about that place. Because he was with John, who was careful, and his.
John sighed quietly, following after Sherlock. He grabbed his wallet and keys from where he had dropped them yesterday and then held the door open for Sherlock, following him down the stairs.
John smiled softly, holding Sherlock's hand. "I know what look she was talking about," he said softly, closing his eyes. "She calls it a 'whole world' look, and she isn't wrong." He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist, nuzzling against him. "You are my whole world."
Sherlock closed his eyes as John's hand pressed to his forehead, feeling cool in comparison to his skin. He hummed a little as the cooler air landed on his face. "S'both hot," he said, trying to drag his eyes open, peering at John through the slits in his eyelids. He swallowed thickly again, his mouth dry. He didn't feel the want yet, on a longer break than before, but the flu-like symptoms didn't pass, and he felt wrong somehow, as if everything had built up from his irregular heats and were just flooding out at once, the inducers dumping everything out of him, and his body didn't like it. He shivered despite feeling warm and a small whine came out of him. "S'
It was several hours later, nearing noon of the next day, when John finally woke up, rubbing his eyes and snuggling closer to Sherlock, who was pleasantly warm. He realised that he was covered up now, and figured that Sherlock must have done that at some point during the night.
"Mm loved them... never said... when I got older," Sherlock murmured finally, the thought that had been needling him for a long time. He let out a breath, finally passing out, snoring softly.
It would last a minimum of two days, and Sherlock wasn't sure what would make him feel worse: being completely alone, or knowing that John's presence there meant he was missing his education to do what he loved. He wasn't used to feeling this conflicted about how another person felt; normally he didn't care.
"You're right, I wouldn't, and his condition sickens me." John launched into the story, telling everything that he thought was important. "That's why I was wondering if you'd be able to give him some nourishment while he's unconscious, boost up his metabolism a bit and get some energy in him."
John trudged back into the bedroom, still drowsy and not completely dried off, and walked over to the chest of drawers, pulling out a pair of khakis and a green jumper with a black shirt to put underneath it.
John knows what he wants Sherlock to hear, what he wants Sherlock to understand. He considers how and what he can say to get through to Sherlock to make an impact.
"John," Sherlock's voice was shaking. An acquaintance might not be able to tell he was nervous, but John knew, "Mycroft can really marry us, in case something does happen on the ship, and we can annul it when we return, if you'd like. It would prevent what happened when you had the concussion, and when I was almost arrested for breaking into your hospital room. At least if something happens on this ship."
"Not yet. I'm waiting for it to hit more news stations, to presumably reach the cardiac rehab hospital in Birmingham."
He stepped away from the jeweler counter fifty seven minutes after entering the door. The engraving, with the foreign language notation, took longer than usual. With a click of the bell, he came out into the dimmed sunlight, breathing in the London air. He patted his pocket, making a show for the cameras.
As he raised his head, Sherlock expected to be able to swing his legs off the bed and stand up in one fluid motion. He tried to roll over, or push himself up, but his back muscles spasmed in sharp, radiating waves.  He was stuck on his side, unable to move without excruciating pain. Sherlock winced, a tear rolling down his face.
John sat up, pushing himself up to stand, making Sherlock whine from the lack of touch. He was mortified by the sound.
As Harry stomped her foot and pointed her finger at the Sheriff, she slowly approached Harry, keeping her arms open and relaxed. She captured a wailing Harry and sat her on the floor, rocking back and forth with her, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."
Normally only allowed in after the victim was dead and the initial evidence gathered, Sherlock had arrived when a second victim had been found barely alive in an alley near the first murder. A doctor, walking home with his son, had seen the commotion and flashing lights. As his duty, he paused to see if he could help, and heard gurgling in the alley.
After a few moments Sherlock shook his head, handing the phone back to John, "Here," and gave a gesture that John couldn't interpret. Sherlock put his hands in his pockets, his gaze now on his shoes.
John lowered himself down, Sherlock coming down with him. They rolled over, Sherlock helping John with his left arm, until they were wrapped around one another, on their sides, facing each other. John kissed Sherlock and growled, "You're not sleeping on the couch tonight," and pulled his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock awoke, slightly disoriented. He could feel someone else in bed with him, and for a moment he panicked. Who was here? Why? He turned, and John was sitting up in Sherlock's bed, reading a novel. He was wearing a thin rimmed pair of reading glasses and his shoes were kicked off. John chewed thoughtfully on his thumb as he crinkled his eyebrows, concentrating on the novel. It was a bodice-ripper romance.
He didn't have enough energy to ask Sherlock if he was taking photos of this murder. Would've been in poor taste, anyway.
The two men printed brochures, playbills and actor databases. Every similar feature was pinned at drawn out, listing each feature. The plays were different and the locations varied. Sherlock pulled his hair in frustration.
Hamish was still looking into the microscope, completely laser focused and unfazed. Sherlock spoke up, nearly timid, "He's with me, he's my-"
"Sherlock?" John tilts his head slightly to the right. He smiles to himself, imagining that he must look ridiculous, rubbing Sherlock like this, tilting his head like a dog tuned to its owners voice, "I'm here."
"There is no life to beg for, Mrs. Watson," Mycroft says, his umbrella laid across his lap, "Thanks to your handiwork, all the way around, Sherlock is dying. Slowly. Of liver disease."
Mycroft puts his fork down and rests his chin on his hands, "Why would I not like to spend time with you?" Mycroft couldn't recall ever sounding like this.
Sherlock looked up into the rearview mirror. John's eyes looked tired, and a little wet. He tried for a joke, "Hamish, you're too young for a girlfriend, or a boyfriend."
"I know that, daddy. You just worry about me not having friends. Mr. Detective - Sherlock - doesn't have friends - and he solves crimes and stuff."
John pulled back, his hand now in the nape of Sherlock's neck, rolled in his curls, "You are so very lovely. I am so lucky. I don't know how I got to be so lucky," John kissed him again. Sherlock thought it was pleasant, and nice, but not something he'd do for hours. After a few minutes John pulled back, breathing heavily.
"Yes, John," Sherlock moaned, burying his face into John's neck, "Please, keep touching me, it feels strange, but good....don't stop. Please..."
this morning. Your poor fiancé is running himself sick caring for you and gathering his family and their clan healers in case you fell more ill. This is all while building your blackhouse. You will honor him by sitting still and
Harry, who had been best friends with Anderson since High School, started screaming, "Don’t you dare come over here. No! Don't you dare. Stay over there. You can't! You can't tell me that. You can't!"
John stands up, kicks his chair (away from other patrons) to the wall. It cracks. He marches away, his spine solider-straight, throwing cash at the hostess.
"There's no connection, Robert, between our departments. There's no proof that anything we do influences each other's career. We've gone to lunch once."
"I'm positive. I've told you before I was amicable to the match, but I'm even more sure now. I was frightened so much of who I'd be matched with. I'd been dreading it since I became of age last year," Sherlock rolled closer to John for warmth, "I don't know that I feel the way about you that my brother feels about his husband, as they couldn't keep their hands off each other from the start. If you are content knowing that I believe you're my equal, and I care for you and express that I find you beautiful in my own way, and we can be together in quiet, and loud, and work aside one another, then we shall have a successful partnership."
Sherlock went through his normal deductions and such, giving Lestrade as much as he could find. Lestrade took notes and when he was satisfied he dismissed Sherlock. As the tall dark-haired man left the crime scene he witnessed something that made his chest hurt.
Just at the edge of the crime scene stood John and a fairly attractive woman. Nothing too out of the ordinary until they kissed and left together. John was holding her close and very visibly flirting with her. But he and John were together and John was doing this. Sherlock never imagined John being the type for these kinds of actions.
"Where are what?" Sherlock asks, his sadness dampened brain unable to comprehend what John meant. This seems to anger John further.
"God no Sherlock, it was just the one kiss. We got to her house and I checked my phone and saw your text and-" John's voice was unsteady. He sounded broken and defeated.
Now thoroughly pissed with himself more than John, Sherlock angrily changed into pyjamas and curled up in his bed under all the blankets. Only then did he notice the tears that were blurring his vision.
He didn't so much see as he did hear John back away and leave. His vision was blurred with tears as he collapsed on the bathroom floor, letting his sobs and cries take over.
Sherlock wasn't sure when he fell asleep but when he awoke sunlight was streaming in through his windows while birds chipped and sang outside. For a moment he forgot anything was wrong but he was sharply brought to reality by the smell of cooking bacon. Reluctantly Sherlock climbed out of bed and pulled his dressing gown on and pulling it tight around himself as he shuffled out of his room.
Sherlock mentally shook himself. He needed to focus on the case but currently, that was proving difficult when it felt like John was trying to bend him over at every moment. Is this what it meant to be in a relationship with someone? Perhaps but Sherlock couldn't worry about that right now.
Just then Sherlock's phone began ringing pulling him out of his thoughts. He picked up his phone to ignore the call when he noticed Lestrade's name flashing across the screen. Oh, perfect timing, he needed a good distraction that wasn't John. Without much hesitation, Sherlock answered the call and placed the phone against his ear.
"I'm not entirely sure what we're doing anymore, I want to change that. I want us to go into something knowing exactly what we're doing. That night we got drunk and slept together made me realize something Sherlock. It made me realize that I want you, and that scares me. Beyond this, I've never been so attracted to a man before," John mumbled, his words coming out in a barely coherent mess but Sherlock understood him regardless. He paused for a moment before continuing.
John looked up from his plate and stared back at Sherlock, his eyes rimmed with red as if he had been crying or was about to. Now that Sherlock could see the other's face more clearly he could tell that John had indeed been crying.
Sherlock didn't think much of it when he woke up nude in John's bed. The two had gotten drunk the night before and John had kissed him. One thing led to another and he ended moaning underneath John while the blonde pounded into him like his life depended on it.
"Why don't you start by telling me what exactly we're doing? What are we, John?" Sherlock hissed, internally cringing at how harsh he sounded. John looked a bit taken aback by Sherlock's outburst and went quiet for a long time, probably thinking of what to say.
Ever since the wedding, Sherlock hasn't been able to stop crying. When he arrived home that night to an empty flat the realization dawned on him. He was truly and utterly alone. He'd never come home to see John typing away on his laptop or making a cup of tea or even napping on the couch. He'd never see any of that again. The flat would never feel like home again.
This time John leaned in, but instead of kissing Sherlock again, John simply rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock smiled and wrapped his arms around John. It was nice, peaceful and Sherlock felt loved.
Sherlock takes a moment and self-consciously touches underneath one eye. It was puffy and sore to the touch. He then let his hand drop back to his side as he made his way towards the bathroom.
Silence spread across the room, and John stared angrily at his plate. He was angry with himself, that much Sherlock could tell. Slowly Sherlock moved his plate from his lap and set it on the nearby table.
John came home one night a little tipsy and grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders before roughly shoving him against the nearest wall. The blonde then proceeded to snog him like there was no tomorrow and Sherlock could do nothing but hang on for the ride.
John awoke sometime in the night, unsure of how many days he'd been in the hospital. He wasn't sure if this was a new day, or a continuation of what he thought of as the day before. Sherlock was lying on the bed and his arm. John heard him crying, weeping, and slowly moved his right arm out from under Sherlock. His left fingers and arm felt heavy, so he couldn't reach over and stroke Sherlock's hair like he wanted to.
"John, I am, John..." Sherlock grabbed at John's hair, pulling him down for a kiss. He bucked his hips up, his legs unable to keep still.
Roderick gets up from his seat, and puts his hand on John's shoulder. John is dressed in his military uniform, Sherlock is dressed in a new, smart suit with a deep purple shirt that almost shimmers, and the rest of the guests are in casual winter jumpers. The grooms are absolutely incandescent, and everyone is more relaxed than they can remember being in years.
Mycroft meets Robert at a cafe a few blocks from work (after his bodyguards and operatives had scoured the area). Robert smiles at him after they order, and Mycroft finds himself smiling back. (He thought for a fleeting moment of Felipe and their first meal in Spain, then the moment passes).
The last rock was smaller, but long and flat. It was tied with a sinew of leather around the mouth of a glass jar, and in the jar was a half dozen roses. Sherlock picked up the jar, freeding the note underneath. He quickly grabbed the note and tucked it in his kilt before it could blow away.
Sherlock tried to ask John more questions, but John shushed him with a kiss. John stroked Sherlock's ribs, his hip, his outer thigh. He pecked a kiss on the end of his nose, "Read all my notes in order. I'll see you when you've solved the riddles."
Robert and Mycroft sit in the back seat of the black car. They are holding hands, sitting close, thighs warmly pressed close.
"I felt like I had to stay, but I couldn't stay, after she....I couldn't take watching you leave me again..."
His Da cackled to himself, leaving John and Sherlock alone. Sherlock looked down, watching the horse paw at the ground with its front hoof.
Sherlock shivered, then opened his eyes. His voice was raw from screaming, "I never knew it could feel like that. It was more amazing than anything I ever imagined. My whole body aches, but I feel as if I may be glowing."
"Robert, he'd been stationed, as a spy, from the Czech Republic, and he became friends with Roderick. He found him. His history checks out." Mummy and Daddy hold each other's hands, but do not speak.
Mycroft sighs, reaches out to stroke the side of Robert's face, "Where did you come from?" His eyes are wide with wonder.
John whispers in Sherlock's ear, "I can't wait to be your husband. We are going to take a month long, uninterrupted sex holiday."
. If Sherlock didn't get out of this town after this show, someone would be murdered. Besides American Theatre, which was slowly dying at the hands of this theatre company bit by bit.
"I don't want anyone else. I've not…I don't do this, Sherlock," John was pleading now, taking a step closer, "I know we've not really…been together all that long. But I've not been interested in anyone else for years. I assumed I'd always live alone."
John wakes around 3 a.m. He is sticky, warm, and Sherlock is wrapped around him. He untangles himself, slowly, kissing his temple, his jaw as he pulls away. It's cold on his feet, his thighs, his stomach as he goes to the bathroom for a flannel. He washes himself, smiling at the mess on himself, remembering how desperate they were to kiss and touch one another.
"And how long was he…" She stopped, biting her cheek, "Is your policy to allow theatre guests to inspect the equipment unsupervised, or do they always have a company escort?"
John returns to Sherlock's hospital room, shutting the door quietly behind him. John stops at the end of the bed, his eyes searching Sherlock's face. His palms are dry, his fingers relaxed, his breathing a little fast but his shoulders have settled. John rubs Sherlock's foot. He grabs another blanket from the end of the other bed. He tucks around Sherlock's feet, rubbing his ankles. He unfolds the blanket, up and over Sherlock, touching his calves, his thighs, his stomach, his chest, his neck as he unfolds the blanket over him. He tucks Sherlock's arms in, under the blanket, wrapping him in tight in both layers. Sherlock begins to shiver, teeth knocking together. John sits on the edge of the bed, continuing to rub both his arms, his legs.
"I need this photo on every screen, on every mobile device, Mycroft," Sherlock commanded. Sherlock was a minor celebrity with his crime solving and his deduction ability, and his link to the boy would likely cause the man to panic and give the boy up. Then, they could work on a permanent separation between Mrs. Hudson and her abusive husband.
"John, I'm sorry," Sherlock said, putting the plaid over John. John lifted his hips and wrapped it as best he could one handed. Sherlock leaned down, put his arms around John, pulling it around him and tying it. As John held onto him for balance, John's breath ghosted on his neck for just a moment.
in an exaggerated way. John grinned, pulling his fingers out of himself, dipping down to lay his entire body over Sherlock's to kiss him deeply.
After they entered the room, they got ready for bed, not speaking. They were both nervous, they both knew each other well enough to know the other was nervous, but they didn't acknowledge it.
John's head was pounding worse than ever after the encounter, so he went to Greg and told him he was begging off so he could work on his own presentation for the next morning. Greg crossed his arms, shook his head and simply said, "You need to get your shit together, Watson. You're behaving as absolute trash." Greg walked away and sat up front, Molly giving him a small wave and smile as he sat down.
John left the flat and kept walking. He thought he would just be gone for a half an hour or so, but every time he thought of returning, tears pricked at his eyes and his hands shook again. He'd been a fool. Again.
He woke up to hands stroking his hair and shoulders. At first, he thought Irene had put his head on her lap but the feel of the fingers was wrong. He turned his head, disoriented. He remembered the smell of John's bed, and he realized he was tucked into John's lap. He smiled, just catching bits of sawdust in John's hair reflected in the sunlight.
For now, he is content to kiss Sherlock gently, wiping him gently with the flannel. When they're clean, he moves his body close again so they are wrapped together; Sherlock's leg wrapped around John's calf, John's arm wrapped around Sherlock, fingers dipping to stroke the curve of his back and his buttocks.
"Yes," He winced in pain, "My parents are on vacation and my brother Mycroft and brother in law DI Lestrade are going on a belated honeymoon. Didn't know if you'd," he kept coughing, "met him at the crime scene?"
Sherlock wakes to the sound of rain against the windows and John humming against the back of his neck. He leans back into John's warmth, wrapping his fingers around John's forearms.
John realizes the morbidity of it; the countdown to joy, and the countdown to the end of a life. As the sky slowly turns from dark blue, to light blue, to pink, John remembers something Mary said to them, all those months ago. During their thunderous discussion of her past (present) as an assassin.
Near dawn break, Sherlock startled awake, pitching himself back away on the bed's edge. As John reached for him, he pulled back further, grabbing the blankets to keep from rolling off the bed completely.
Seanmháthair had explained to him, again and again, that either he or Mycroft would need to find an advantageous match in marriage. She'd known, years earlier, that the drought would come. She knew how foolish her one daughter would be, drunk on whiskey, leaving her children to fend for themselves. Tavis, Norris, Gavin and Price would have starved to death if not for the kindness and generosity of Victoria and Stuart Holmes. But kindness and generosity only go so far when there are eight mouths to feed. Especially on a farmstead only meant to hold a clan of four. They saved, worked together, used wits and strength, but it was still not enough.
Now, here, in his sitting room, Mrs. Hudson was covering up. Terrified of being discovered, she wasted time by wandering through Sherlock's living room. Her skirt flowed out as she turned, running her hands over the peeling wallpaper. The hem curled up, and he saw the yellow and purple patterns on her calves and ankles. He could deduce by her posture the blows against her spine. She might have internal bleeding, even though she was standing upright. She was prattling on about the rooms, the space, but Sherlock heard only the roaring of blood in his ears and the smell of fresh soil and the grip of calloused hands on his thighs.
"I, I don't mind. It's been nice to have someone to talk to-" Sherlock coughed, gasping for air. He felt sharp pain in his lungs, his sides. Dr. Watson came close, gently moving Hamish out of the way. He used his stethoscope to listen to Sherlock's chest and heart, gently running his fingers over the rib binding.
John jolts awake with a stomach cramp. He grabs at the bowl that Sherlock has placed near him and wretches into it. Vile liquid comes up, and John feels cold.
"Noooo. I fell on my bum." God, what the hell was wrong with him? He tried to bite his lip to keep from giggling.
"Come, husband," Sherlock giggled at the pun, stripped his shirt and jacket as he pulled John off of the sticky couch. As they made their way to the shower, they stripped each other, pulling clothes off as they went. John's arm was a little more limber since he'd been up for a little while, and he was able to mostly get his shirt off by himself. Sherlock smiled, "See, we got some physical therapy in!" John snorted.
"Oh, Sherlock," John gasped, he'd only had sex with men a couple of times, and none of them were Sherlock. Nothing compared to the feeling of the love of his life around him, his heart pounding against his own chest. He grabbed at him with his good arm, pulling him as close as he could. He felt his orgasm building, and tears prickling at the corners of his eyes.
"Romantic," Billy mutters, pulling his coat tighter around himself. He rubs his right arm; it did seem to ache more often when the weather turned colder.
"Yes, yes he'll be fine. Sleep, I'll be here when you wake up," Sherlock slept, feeling John's arm wrap around his midsection.
"We must let the world think Sherlock is back in the hospital.  Let him think he's running his plans, the hospital will be a cover for him to stay safe from Mary. We can persuade him to move in a direction, while helping him in what he believes are his choices."
"Oh, John." Sherlock breathed, his mouth open, his name said with wonder, adoration. This was defintely the most favorite way John had heard Sherlock say his name. It was as if he was the most important part of Sherlock's world. As if he were Sherlock's whole world.
Sherlock thought. He recalled being very tired the night before, but he did remember tucking a note under his pillow. It was a plain note, written in what he assumed was John's quick scrawl. He read it out loud, "Sherlock, look for the rocks tied with flowers. With the rocks are my notes with the clues for the next note. These notes will remind you why I've fallen in love with you and why I want you with me for all of my days. The notes will also have clues that will lead you from place to place, and at the last clue we will be waiting for you for the handfasting."
"But I-" Sherlock went over to his phone. He saw messages from Greg, Mycroft, John, and one from Hamish that were from the past few days. As he scanned his sent folder, he saw two messages: "John, come to Baker Street, if convenient.-SH" and "If inconvenient, come anyway.-SH"
John cursed his broken body. If he could, he would ravish Sherlock right now. Instead, he described what he would do to his husband, if he had the strength, "Sherlock, if I could, I would kiss you senseless. I would run my hands up and down your back, your ribs, leave bite and kiss marks on your neck where you couldn't hide them. If I had the use of both my hands, I would use one to run my hands up the back of your neck, into your hair, pushing you close as I kiss you with my lips, my tongue. I wouldn't stop kissing you, until you are writhing, and begging me to strip you down to nothing and have my way with you…."
Sherlock, in an act of petulance, is in John's chair. He doesn't want her in it. No one but John, and if not John, him.
Sherlock set his violin down, holding only the ring. John could see just a slight tremor in his fingers. The detective reached around the breakfast tray and took John's left hand in his. He kept his eyes down, rubbing his fingers across John's knuckles before positioning the ring on the end of his finger. But he didn't put it on. Sherlock lifted his eyes, looking into John's face.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, pecking a kiss on his head. John looked up and raised one eyebrow, "Ok, I'm short, you don't have to rub it in by kissing the top of my head!"
Sherlock was surprised by the tears tracking on his cheeks, "I was just thinking of my brother. I agreed to be arranged to be married so he could marry his love. I was just resigned to the idea, and the best I thought I could hope for was someone who wouldn't ask too much of me physically and would allow me to still work on my experiments."
"Or a terrible death," Sherlock muttered, watching John's face. John nodded, his shoulders sagging down into his frame.
As they ate, Elias Openshaw began to talk. He discussed the pride he felt at officiating the first same sex wedding onboard the Baetica. He beamed at Sherlock and John as he lifted his flute of mimosa, "To Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. It is an honor to see you finally married, and on our ship, no less."
"Are you alright, brother?" Mycroft asked. He too had circles under his eyes. He rolled his shoulder to crack the joints. He and his husband had been sleeping on two cots in Sherlock's room.
"Please, John, please," Sherlock thrashed his head back and forth, his hair sticking to his forehead.
Sherlock had blushed as John fumbled through his locks, hissing as John's thick fingers caught on tangles. He over-oiled Sherlock's hair, causing it to drip thickly into his eyes and onto his shoulders. William had huffed with impatience, "You're going to drown him in it!" But he acquiesced to John's wishes, standing back and guiding him in the placement of all the decorative beads, the interspacing of braids, and curling his locks by using his fingers.
John moves closer to Mycroft, their shoulders touching. Their group of soldiers took the nonverbal signal and readied weapons.
John gestures to his shoulder, and then Sherlock's chest, "Just a silly thought how these two bullet wounds led us here. To us."
John felt affection and love from every pore. Beneath him, spread out as a alabaster statue, was the most beautiful man he's ever seen. He trusted John implicitly, and had given himself to him, body and soul.
At 2 am, the sheriff arrived. They cleared the theatre, asking for everyone to leave except those who were directly involved with the raising of the scaffold. No one spoke as all the costumers and light techs left. Sherlock held John's hand and felt his fingers vibrating.
John didn’t pay much attention to Hamish as he fussed in his bedroom and laboratory. He was happy that Sherlock and his son were getting along, though the stretches of silence did worry him at times. He was leaving the sitting room to go down the hallway to help Mrs. Hudson with something when he saw Sherlock and Hamish on the floor of the lab, huddled over an experiment. John knew Sherlock had grown up too fast and was reliving some of his childhood, his best memories, with Hamish.

"Are you a detective? I saw you looking at things with a magnifying glass. We were watching the scene with the policemen and the detectives. I made daddy go down that street so we could see it better. We were watching. I saw you working, then you chased after the bad guys with daddy, but then you ran into the bad guy, and you would've died if daddy didn't save you by shooting him. He broke your ribs and stabbed your calf and the back of your thigh, narrowly missing your femoral artery with a six inch blade -"
Tonight is sweeter, even in the worry. There is no guilt in watching Sherlock's face, touching his hand, moving his curls from his forehead. He watches Sherlock toss and turn slightly, muttering in soft tones; nothing that's understood. John knows that if he would let himself sleep it would be the same sleep he had after he shot the Cabbie; remarkably calm and surprised at the absence of guilt. No matter the opinion of anyone else, the decision was the correct one.  He watches Sherlock sleep until sunlight slowly fills the room, until Sherlock wakes asking for John and a glass of water.
"I don't want you to go. Hamish doesn't want you to go," John puffed out his lower lip in a fake pout, "But I know you have to. And we'll actually
John knew he must have looked an absolute fool. His fingers were tingling, his face was  pink with anticipation. He went with Sherlock to brunch, proud of the beautiful man on his arm. As they neared the restaurant, John called his parents. He felt like a teenager, reporting back to them that they'd have to keep Hamish for a while.  Sherlock and he were on a date and working things out.
Tavis threw the bath water outside, then came back to check on Sherlock. He was already asleep, his long, damp hair fanned out underneath his head. Tavis covered him with a blanket, then exited the Holmes house into the front pasture. In the dusk light Tavis could barely see John Watson marching towards him.
Sherlock didn't smile often. He felt himself grin. His Da clapped him on the shoulder, "I'll leave you fiancées to it, then. Two weeks planning is quick to get to your estate, Master Watson. I've got to wake the hungover lads. I figure a good bit of shouting and banging pots should get them roused up!"
Daemon watched Sherlock grab his wallet and run outside. He tried to follow, but Sherlock shooed him back inside, asking him to wait there in case John was released.
Sherlock goes out the flat's back entrance; he's just kissed John goodbye and told him he'd be gone no more than an hour.
His heart bursting with affection, john crawls in behind Sherlock, pulls the blankets tightly around them. He listens to Sherlock's breathing and runs his fingers through his damp curls. His hands lightly touch his arms, his thighs; just rubbing gently in affection.
John wanted to open his eyes, but he couldn't. He heard the beeps of hospital machines, and it was comforting. It reminded him of work, of familiarity, of an environment in which he was used to navigating. He listened as hard as he could. Who was in the hall? He heard yelling. He heard feet pounding against the floor. He heard a nurse yelling, or a doctor?
John continued smiling, and John giggled when he looked down at Sherlock. To his mortification, Sherlock realized he had accepted a marriage proposal in his nightclothes.
" 'Lock, becoming beautiful?" He laughed, sitting on the bed. William continued with his treatments, pouring out some  rose oil to put on Sherlock's curls.
Sherlock coughed, his ears turning pink, "Sherlock is my first name. My name is Sherlock Holmes." John smiled at him, but Sherlock was unsure of what he'd said or done that was amusing.
He looked up to see the doctor, steady with his gun in his left hand, aiming it down behind Sherlock.
Sherlock let go of John's hand and stood in front of Harry, she backed up, dropping her hands from her brother's face. "Harry, you know your brother," Sherlock's voice cracked, "He goes over safety multiple times. Jim Moriarty inspected it. Everyone cleared it. Don't put ideas into his head-"
John put his hands up in surrender, "I don't know what you think I was doing Sherlock, but you know I am a terrible liar. Whatever you think I am playing at, I think you're mistaken. I am not playing at anything."
Sherlock ran his fingers through John's golden hair. Sherlock had to bite his lip again with another bout of sharp pain and dizziness. He felt John's arms around his waist, his head in his lap, his shaking shoulders as he wept.
Sherlock, who has only had one friend, only one love, is holding on to everything by the scrape of his nails. He can grab bits of sleep if he spoons three pillows. After the first miserable week, Mycroft picks up John's spare pillow and a couple of his threadbare jumpers. Sherlock builds a nest (Mycroft is honestly surprised that his brother doesn't dress up a couple of pillows like John) and he's finally able to sleep for four hours straight.
Sherlock chuckled, then pulled John's arm tighter around himself. John willed himself to breathe more evenly, and thought about Mycroft to will his aching member back under control. Just as he was going to drift into sleep, with his detective in his arms, Sherlock cleared his throat. He squeezed John's hands again, stating, "I find myself, upset, for having yelled at you, earlier. As we discussed the annulment. I'm sorry, I have just had to put off this case for two weeks. I'd been trying to work on any alternative to asking you to marry me."
"Yes." John disconnects, considers hailing a cab, but decides to burn off nervous energy by running instead.
Sherlock spoke from the floor, his face and fingers pressing into the carpet. He was reminding himself that he was here, in John's room, not anywhere else. "What time is it?" John crawled across the bed to his night stand, pulling up his phone. "It's 3am, Sherlock. Do you want to come back to bed?"
, both hands and fingers pinched together like a shadow puppet mimic of a kiss, that John knows he's not misread things. Sherlock writes down the word, helps with the sign, then taps his lips. 'Ever the gentleman,' John thinks, leaning in to give Sherlock a lovely and quick peck upon the lips. As he pulls away, John surprises himself with a sign, like muscle memory from what he practiced in the car earlier. He uses both hands to form the top of a triangle. "Home," he mouths, but to make it clear, he writes on a fresh napkin,
"Ok, gentlemen, I need to feed you up." John grinned, Hamish bolting for the dining room table. John stood up, helping Sherlock up by the hips and his forearm, pulling him up to a standing position and rewarding him with a quick kiss to the mouth.
"M'so tired," he yawns, as John ruffles his head and body with all the towels they have. He sits Sherlock on the small couch while he hastily changes the sheets. As he tucks Sherlock in, kissing his forehead, he sees a small note sticking out of the bottom of the door. John grabs it, reading:
John nodded, allowing Tavis to lead him into the Holmes main common room. A fire was going, but the two men were alone. They sat in chairs opposite one another. John bounced his leg up and down, waiting for Tavis to speak.
Sherlock opened the door slightly. His face turned pink, "Um, I'll talk to you when you're done. I just have two or three theories I want to run past you. And the Captain has invited us for brunch."
John remembered what Sherlock had been working on the night before, "But, the case, you were working on with Lestrade over the phone. Don't you need to go see some things in person?"
John grinned, bending down to place a kiss on Sherlock's forehead, "We'll do whatever we want. There aren't any rules. I'd like to keep seeing you. Keep working with you in the theatre, as long as they need me. But I know you're new to this. I don't want you to get involved if you don't want to. But I want you to know, I want to. I want you here."
As the meal wound down, Sherlock felt toes poking at his legs. He looked up and smiled at John, sitting across from him. He felt better, much more well rested than he had in a long time. He poked John's feet back gently, and he smiled back. Mrs. Hudson gave Sherlock a look that conveyed to
Sherlock felt his ears redden. He continued, "I guess, thank you, I've never felt good looking. Or had friends. I would see or deduce things. I would tell someone something, and they'd hate me, make fun of me. I just figured it was easier to be alone with my books and experiments."
No one wore the same multi striped tartan pattern that Sherlock wore. He stood at the end of the crowd, watching everyone talk and circle around each other's groups. In watching the milling crowd, he deduced the deep red tartan was for relatives of the Lestrades who had married into the clan. The green blue were distinguished guests from a neighboring clan of the Holmes with whom his mother was working towards an alliance.
Price interjected, "Oy, Sherlock, you need to get used to this. Dressed as you are. You're going to be showing off your family jewels to your own laddie soon enough."
John knew he'd loved Sherlock for a long time. The kiss wasn't amazing or dizzying, simply because they were both too nervous. But what made John's heart stutter was the idea that this was a cross into new territory. He and Sherlock had matching rings, they were getting married, but this kiss was confirmation, in the sunlight of their honeymoon suite, that Sherlock felt as John did. Or, that was his hope.
John leaned away from Sherlock, looking from one to the other, "You bought my son a pig's ear, and a blow torch?"
John sits up straighter. Major Sholto would keep his spine straight, not breaking eye contact, "When did I leave?"
"John Hamish Watson," He kisses his eyelids, his cheeks, his neck, his jawline. Sherlock draws John close to him so they are flush, chest to toes, Sherlock's lips pecking over John's neck. They've only made it as far as the doorway to the bedroom. "I love you, John, and I'm going to make love to you."
Mycroft asked after John's house design. Sherlock felt himself drift back to sleep as John was explaining how his clansmen were building the house up with rocks and mud with the plan of a sloped moss roof. Sherlock loved the sound of John's voice. Sherlock squeezed John when his voice cracked as he explained how he had laid out the plan to be open and wide in case Sherlock was ill and had to be carried from room to room.
Robert commands everyone to stand down in their headsets. Mycroft yells through the helicopter speakers in case they don't hear Robert.
Hamish had been gone for forty-five minutes when John caught Sherlock talking into Hamish's empty room, explaining that it was "impossible for the killer to have put vinegar in the sink after that type of cleaner as the combination would have caused a mustard gas reactive."
Sherlock rolls his eyes, then rests his chin on John's chest so he can look in his eyes. Sherlock is searching John's face, eyes moving across every part of him, while he speaks.
Now, they had one small flock, a withered patch of land, and one black horse for as far as the eye could see. A horse that didn't belong to their family.
"Sherlock, love, are you alright?" John sat beside him, and Sherlock, almost imperceptibly, shifted away. He still didn't speak.
The medical examiner, John could now see the title from her badge, tilted her head and looked into John's face. Her mouth formed a silent 'o', and she sneaked out behind John, closing the door with a soft click. John moved in front of Sherlock, pulling him away from Hamish around the corner by a fridge. The young boy was still oblivious, his eyes squinting into the magnifiers. John knew his son would only respond when he was ready.
John gave distance as they went outside, purposefully sitting as far away in the cab as he could. Sherlock felt more comfortable with anger, awkwardness, and hurt feelings. He knew this pain was the inevitable outcome, so he consoled himself with the idea he was being kinder by cutting it off as quickly as possible.
Mycroft is too overcome to speak at more than a whisper, "I'll give you time for your goodbyes- your 'see you laters.' " He gives a sharp nod, squeezes John's hand on his shoulder before he releases it, slips out of the flat quietly.
"Yes, but," He gets up and paces. Walking to the radio to turn it up a bit louder. He pulls out a notebook, grabs a pen. He gestures for Mycroft to come stand next to him by the radio, so they can stand up and lean on the bookshelf. He begins to write a note where Mycroft can read it.
"Er," Sherlock stuttered, the gift paper crinkling more in his hands, "What I bought you is an outfit. I was planning on laying it on your bed but you, uh, messed up the order of the surprise by showering first."
He'd taken so long to answer that John felt the need to fill the silence, "I'm sorry. You don't have to answer that. Especially if I've put you in an uncomfortable position."
That love, to see his family from losing their home, was what kept him from running away from John Watson out of pure nervousness. That is what kept him standing, in their field, with his father, John and John's stallion.
John shook, his cock jutting out from between his legs, "Oh, Sherlock, you are so hot and lovely. Tell me."
"Let's get you into the tub, dearest," John whispered into Sherlock's ear, guiding him into the tub. As John lowered him into the warm water he winced, realizing the bruises on his chest and back from his fall.
"I understand, leannan. You may stay as home as long as you like. We can get married here. You're so young. I don't-"
"You will sit here by me," John arranges him, Sherlock is quiet, as John takes off his jacket, his shirt, and they are both undressed from the waist up. John wraps his arms around Sherlock, they hold one another, quiet, not speaking. John rubs Sherlock's arms, rubs the back of his neck, draws circles with his fingers over his ribcage.
were you thinking?" John put his fingers under his chin, keeping Sherlock's eyes from wearing a hole in the floor. The doctor crossed his arms and huffed a breath, relaxing his pose when he saw some moisture in Sherlock's grey blue eyes.
Mycroft can't speak. John's face- he may pass out. Mycroft may fall forward from the shock of looking at John - the face from Reichenbach Falls.
As they entered, a tall, overweight man stopped washing wine glasses at the bar and ran to Sherlock, shaking his hand warmly. They signed to one another very quickly, the tall, heavyset man easily keeping up with Sherlock. Sherlock moved to take his phone out of his pocket to interpret for John, but the man stopped him, offering to speak.
He walks into the jeweler's store. An unassuming store front. Full of treasures from times past. He has in his pocket some jewelry that Roderick had given him nearly a year ago.
John remembers how when he proposed to Mary he never got down on one knee, how he was terribly nervous and could hardly speak. Now, he feels as if he could say anything, and Sherlock would understand. Every look and every touch, they'd known each other so well, so intimately, it was just now more intense.
"When you grabbed the headboard, must have been, there's a little blood on the wall. You didn't notice when it happened?"
John looked down at him, folded up into a compact space on the couch, tucked into his arms. He ran his fingers down Sherlock's braids and through his curls. John looked up when he felt someone pressing on the backrest of the couch.
Mycroft isn't sure when Sherlock began to shut himself off from the world, but it was when they were children. They were teased mercilessly for their intellect. It didn't bother Mycroft at all. He didn't care; his thoughts and mind were otherwise occupied.
had derailed the brunett's brain and body so completely. Though he was no consulting detective, John read Sherlock's face. His cheeks and neck were gorgeously flushed and his breath was heaving in his chest.
Dimmock then addressed Sherlock directly, partially blocked by John's head, "So, she's a bit hysterical. Think you can handle it?"
"John," Sherlock whispered. His body was so scrawny and tall. He pulled way from John, covering himself up from his gaze.
"Distracting me?" Sherlock is holding the letters tight to his chest. Tears begin to trickle down his face. John can't stop just yet. He needs Sherlock to understand.
a simple imitation of a steering wheel. Sherlock smiled, giving John a sign recognized as he mouthed it at the same time,
John gave Sherlock a look and Sherlock just smiled back. John recalled the first weeks of knowing Sherlock, and he didn't remember Sherlock smiling nearly this much. He knew that during that time he'd been nursing broken ribs, but he liked to think his happier demeanor had something to do with John and Hamish. He was no longer alone, but he had others who shared in their adventures.
John turns, and Mycroft is biting his cheek. His eyes are watery. A trick? John out of his mind? Both Holmes brothers, crying?
Sherlock lifted his chin, turning his head to allow John to kiss more of his skin. As he spoke, John continued to kiss along every bit of Sherlock he could reach.
"Oh for god's sakes," John huffs, smiling, pulling Sherlock tightly to him, in one motion pulling him close and stripping him. In similar efficiency John is tugging off his pyjamas. John is naked and Sherlock is dazed; his lips are kissing his face, arms wrapped around him, and one calf has looped up over his.
"Next piece is Moriarty. Mary is meeting him to discuss their plans. He's not shared this information with us. We will be there as well. We do need to keep her alive to make for sure she's not carrying John's child; though we know that's highly unlikely. I believe that's part of her reasoning. Protection."
Sherlock rose from the floor, taking one last look at Hamish before entering the kitchen. He wouldn't make eye contact with John.
Tavis passed Sherlock a cup of mead, encouraging Sherlock to join the rowdy conversation. Other cousins on the Wallace side, Norris, Gavin and Price, all made Sherlock feel like a tall and skinny pole. The two Holmes cousins, Jaime and Eric, favored Sherlock in their wiry looks and pale complexion. They all were loud, swapping stories of conquests. Sherlock had heard all these stories before, and, the same as before, he had nothing to contribute.
, to Sherlock. Sherlock opens his mouth, eyes on Mycroft, then shuts his mouth when he looks back at John.
Sherlock could imagine a place, easily, where Greg and John would be a far better match than Mycroft and Greg or John and Sherlock. The logical part of his mind understood that two single men coming together, who already had children, would best understand one another. If Greg didn't know before, would he act upon it now, if he knew? Would that leave both his brother and himself heartbroken?
, sleep, he traced patterns lightly over his cream colored back. He traced circles and lines, running the marriage proposal over in his mind a few more times.
John heard Hamish's voice clearly, brightly asking even though it was hitched with sobbing, "Is that why you love and want to marry daddy? Because he loves you? All the parts of you?"
John laughed, "No, I'm surprised you couldn't tell. I build houses, Irene had to get on me about screwing and gluing everything like it was meant to last for 100 years. She wanted me here for my expertise in making things structurally sound, but I imagine once this set piece is done I'll go back to homes."
"Oh, my sweet, dear boy. You weren't supposed to find out that way. I was going to give you the tartan after you accepted the proposal. Oh, dear," She stroked his hair, which caused Sherlock to burrow further into her arms and cry harder.
No answer. Sherlock moved to get off the bed. John blocked the door, "Sherlock, I am not going to hurt you, or keep you blocked in, but you need to tell me, why are you angry with me?"
She believes Sherlock looks off, but just considers it to be nerves. (Begging for John? For them to be together?)
Sherlock nodded. He bent down so John could more easily reach his braid to undo it. He heard Tavis snicker. John replied with a sharp "Shut it, now!" which miraculously kept Tavis quiet the rest of the evening.
"Sherlock." John says softly, his hands now on Sherlock's face, roaming over his gorgeous, sharp features, "Are you ok with this, with us? I'm going to go upstairs, and get a few things..."
Mycroft goes back through the weaponry again. He has to be sure he'll hit his target 98% of the time with 97% accuracy.
When John kissed Sherlock goodnight, Sherlock's stomach swooped, even more than when he'd been pitched from a horse.
When Harry returned, she was back to herself. Everyone had marching orders. Costumes were placed first, with protective capes on top, then makeup, then run throughs. Even though not everyone was needed, everyone had to stay close in case of a change or a fix.
John pulled Sherlock in for a quick kiss, "Sherlock, Mike Stamford teaches here. He's one of my other best mates. Hamish and I meet him in his office once a week for fish and chips. He discusses interesting cases. My best friend is Greg. Hamish and his girls play detective and murder investigations. Yes, it's weird when they get around other families sometimes, they think it's a bit morbid, but I'm not upset. I normally don't let him mess around with the equipment-"
"Last role was Salieri in Amadeus, talked about how dying would be part of fame, and he wanted to live a life to fame-"
"How did we survive, John, not touching each other for so long? I can't imagine not sleeping next to you, not kissing you."
Mycroft gives John a long look. John looks for a silent sign. Did Mycroft lie to him? Did he know this entire time Sherlock and Moriarty would meet here? Their plan was to neutralize Moriarty once and for all, now that they knew Mary had been working for him.
They moaned into each other's mouths, Sherlock doing his best to quiet John's yelps and cries as Sherlock entered him. Sherlock wrapped his arms underneath John, the only sound in the room their breath and the slick of skin and Sherlock's hips snapping against John's.
John giggles, huffs out his breath. His eyes are still shut, but he turns towards Sherlock, "You called me, you called me 'love'."
The last crime scene John and Sherlock had been at together had been active, alive, full of people, and difficult to follow. This scene was quieter, there was only the two bodies with lots of lights shining on them. They were posed as if they had been sitting on either side of a great hexagon.
"What? IV?" He rolls back into Sherlock's chest, grabbing into him, breathing, willing the nausea and room spinning to slow down.
Something clicks in his mind that nearly brings him to his knees. The man, a few years younger than him, zip tying his wrists. He's seen him. His ghost, he called him. Holding his bleeding shoulder in Helmand. Photos. Who is this -
He ran into the police station lobby, sliding on the linoleum. Daemon looked at him and began to talk, but Sherlock shushed him harshly, demanding to speak to Greg Lestrade.
John didn't even apologize when he bumped into Mycroft's leg, almost toppling him, when they crawled up into the airplane for the longer leg of the journey home.
"Americans," Sherlock said, as if that would explain everything, "when they clink glasses at a wedding, or an event such as this, it's traditional that the betrothed kiss."
Robert hops up from the bed before Mycroft can answer, and heads to the door, "I'm going to make coffee. I want you to take some time to think about us. I've lo-" Robert pauses, sighs, starts over, "I've watched you, for a long time now, and I need you to trust me. I've loved you for a lot longer than I let on. Your decision, by the end of the day. I won't pressure you. But we are on a deadline with Magnussen and I need to know where you are with us."
John knows he has to feign interest in Mary, the baby (non baby), but his skills can only carry him so far. He cannot put on different faces or pull tears on command like Sherlock. For something to sound true, or to come out of him with conviction, he has to believe in what he's saying.
The three boys and Mrs. Hudson found their particular way of life very agreeable. They all had enough space in the flat to be by themselves when needed, but they never felt lonely. Mrs. Hudson was happy to keep Hamish with her when John and Sherlock had to bound away on cases. John never got tired of watching Sherlock's mind work. His quick deductions, his conclusions drawn based on small amounts of available evidence. He loved Sherlock most when he could see him becoming impatient or angry with someone who didn't understand. He could almost hear Sherlock's inner monologue, as he'd taught Hamish to understand as well, "No one has a mind like you. But if you're cruel in reminding everyone how brilliant you are and how slow they are, you will be brilliant, Hamish. But you will be
Sherlock sucks on John's neck for a moment; John runs his fingertips across Sherlock's back, his arms, his shoulders, "Jesus, Sherlock." He's breathing, pushing his hips back so he's not grinding into Sherlock as much as he wants to.
At first, John takes the box to the bedroom, but he can't. His knees weaken when he gets close to the doorway. He doesn't want to be near a bed when he's alone. Without his Sherlock. His throat constricts; he wonders when he last called him
Sherlock stepped in the shower first, testing the water, then leading John in. His shoulder was still covered in bruises,the arm hung at a strange angle. It would never be the same, not after two injuries. As he took John's left hand, and pulled him into the shower with him, he started to weep. He was shaking, weeping, and John, strong John, the one who had been shot, the one he was supposed to be taking care of, was holding him.
John exhales through his nose, breathes in through his mouth, for a few moments. Just outside of Sherlock's hospital room. (Jesus, Christ....how many times has he waited outside a hospital room for Sherlock.)
Mummy pats his cheek gently, "Yes, sweetheart, but never with the boys. He's tended to ignore his heart. Both boys do."
John tried to reach Sherlock's hair to pet him, to hold him, but he was tired, and his eyes drooped. Sherlock moved the chair as close as the could to the bed, and lowered the side rail. He laid his head on the bed, using John's arm as a pillow. John drifted to sleep with Sherlock's hair tickling his chest.
Sherlock took the half eaten breakfast tray off of the bed, leaving the vase with the rose on the end table. As he sat back down, John grabbed him around the waist, pulling him close. Sherlock grinned as Hamish continued to explain, "I know that daddy loves you, papa, because we were lonely, too, before we met you. Daddy is so much happier with you here. He laughs so much more with you around, and he doesn't stay up all night after having his army nightmares."
"Jesus fucking Christ," Billy huffs, pushing back on his heels to turn and chase after Mary. He sends a text to Sherlock.
"Yes, I figured that out," Sherlock smiled, taking a few moments to breathe in and out deeply. He closed his eyes, opening them when John touched his hand after returning from the kitchen.
John sniffs in a breath of air, trying to relax. He knows he's looked and felt just like Jim, willing to negotiate anything for love, willing to work with anyone.
The term of endearment only made it worse. He was crying and sobbing, now, great wracking sobs that shook his shoulders. John did his best to wrap his good arm around him, kissing his neck under the spray.
John smiled, and for a moment he considered standing up in the tub to scandalize Sherlock further. Instead, he just left it at a smile, waiting to exit the bath once he was alone. He dressed in a bathrobe and met Sherlock in the suite's small sitting room. Sherlock was looking down at his phone, flipping through it with his right thumb. John felt a wave of affection and love, and his feet were moving on his own accord. His goal was to finally kiss Sherlock, properly. As he moved forward to kneel at his feet, the ship moved forward, pitching John nearly into Sherlock's lap. He landed on the floor instead.
They agreed on a Chinese restaurant, which was nearly empty and allowed them a corner booth all to themselves.  As they sat down at the table, Sherlock linked his fingers through John's. They didn't talk much, the adrenaline of the day wearing on them. John had shared more the last time they were together, so John asked Sherlock the obvious question.
"John, what's wrong?" Sherlock sets the glass of water down on the nightstand and strokes John's hair.
John pulled him in for another kiss, "Why don't you have a boyfriend? Why aren't you married? You're brilliant, gorgeous….." he trailed off pressing kisses against Sherlock's jaw.
"Yes, now. I have no ring. But we are going to be apart. I want you to know, without a doubt, that I am yours and you are mine. If you'll have me. I want to waltz with you, in front of everyone..."
John recalls another letter he'd left in Sherlock's bag, when he thought he was going to meet with Moriarty himself to kill him. Before the entire plan, his entire life, was even more fucked up than usual.
"Sherlock," John removes his hand from his to ruffle his hair, "Mycroft and I can have one secret, can't we?"
John sat up, pulling Sherlock close to him, "Not well enough? I am your husband. We always work better together.  I am not getting left behind-"
"I'm sorry, John, I'm sorry," He slurred. John shook his head, and continued rubbing Sherlock's back. The nurse explained to John, "He's been here for two weeks. It's been hard to get him to eat. We could tell that you're the husband that takes care of him."
"Oh shush," She coos, putting the gun against his lips. He's shaking, "I'm not done yet." She tilts her head and moves close to whisper in his ear, "You've got to kill him in front of an audience, so there is no question it was you. So you're sent away, or executed yourself. So I'm free of guilt, and John and I are together. Then, I am the leader, and you will truly be destroyed in every. Sense. Of. The. Word."
"Sherlock," John pulled on Sherlock's hand. They were at least comfortable with this gesture, "You may look at me, or touch me, whenever you would like to. Wherever. I will not touch you, or make you touch me, unless you explicitly ask me to do so."
"Oh," Sherlock answered, putting the leather bag down. He looked at John, considering placing his hand on his knee. He reconsidered, instead, spread the handfasting cloth over both of them, as there were no other blankets. He watched John guide the mare down paths and fields, hoping the hour would pass quickly.
"I wish you would have been there, Sherlock," he pulled Sherlock's hands up to his mouth, ghosting kisses across his knuckles, "when he was a baby and I was working and sleep deprived. I wish you could have seen him. He was so wild, even as a baby. Up all night, I couldn't get him on a schedule for anything. You would have loved him. I would have loved having you with me then."
to be walking near a crime scene that he's working, a crime spree that's delayed his honeymoon twice-"
Medical conferences were a mix of pure boredom and bottom shelf alcohol. It was a chance to meet colleagues and have mini reunions with old classmates while boosting the resume. It was also a way to become spectacularly hungover after shagging a knockout blond doctor from Wales who sucked you off until you screamed for mercy twice.
"Jesus, what a way to spend Christmas," Lieutenant Watson huffs as he surveys the five young Jordan civilians who were transferred in. They all have burns. One is less visible than the others; all on his legs.
Now, John was in Sherlock's arms, snuggled right up to him, every part if their bodies touching. John's back to Sherlock's front. They were alone in the quiet flat. Hidden from the outside world, just the two of them.
"Hey, I don't want to intrude, but why didn't you ever come? Mycroft mentioned his little brother a few times. I even think he was trying to set us up on a double date but you never showed up."
"Well….I'm trying. I've got most of the recipe for pancakes, so I'm going to try it. The recipe is specific with measurements but they aren't very specific with the directions about cooking it on the griddle. I'm not sure how to do that part."
Sherlock wanted to ask more about his relationship with Greg, but he decided to leave it. It was past midnight, and the drugs were suddenly taking effect.
John led the horse to the stable, gently circling the stallion so he grew acclimated to the stall. He tied him to the hitch post and  picked up a hand full of clean stray from the floor, then rubbed it across his horse's sweaty coat. The horse whinnied, then laid itself down.
Mycroft, arrogant bastard, sounds sad and unsure. John doesn't answer. He takes a rag and dusts his boots. He is in the same zone, same set of procedures, he had followed when he had some downtime every night in Afghanistan.
The only girl Sherlock showed any interest in was an older girl Sally who  helped him with an experiment. The neighboring clan was losing horses and sheep to an unknown illness. They'd reached out to Sherlock for his assistance. To reach a conclusion, their daughter Sally helped him dissect the  the neighboring clan's horses and sheep. They'd discovered the animals had gotten into some rotten feed that was hidden in the back of their stable.
"May I kiss you? And touch you?" John asked, pulling the blankets back. Sherlock nodded. John used his oiled hands to rub the oil across Sherlock's manhood, pulling the oil up in between his legs to his entrance. Sherlock groaned, feeling exposed, oil running over every intimate part of his body. John pushed his thumb into Sherlock's entrance, just slightly, as John kissed him. The kisses started tentative, then turned heated, as John began to alternate stroking him and pressing into his body.
John's came closer, keeping his eyes focused, "Sherlock, you don't have to do this. If you don't want to. We could find a way to merge flocks in trust, or set up loans. You don't have to marry me."
John pulls himself up and over so he is sitting on Sherlock's lap, not straddling him, so his arm is still free and facing the IV. He wraps his other arm around Sherlock's neck and pulls him in tightly, kissing him with his tongue and nipping his lip with his teeth. Sherlock moans and grabs John tightly around the waist, kissing his cheek, eyelids, neck.
"Thank you. Thank you all for allowing me-" at this, his voice began to break. Gregory unwrapped the tartan so he could put his arm around his husband's waist, "For allowing us to marry. I love Gregory so much. It would have been easy to go through with a match-made arrangement. Thank you, mummy and daddy, and Serg and Kara Lestrade for giving your son to me."
He jogs away before Mary, or any of her many minions, catch on that he's not just any vagrant in the alley.
John laughed, allowing himself to be pulled onto Sherlock's lap. He felt warm, affectionate, but still slightly dizzy from the pain medicine. His eyes would drift in and out of focus at inconvenient times. When Sherlock was kissing him, or helping him move from the bed to the bathroom, or whispering stories in his ear.
Mycroft rubs his palms across his eyes. He's tired. Only awake for maybe an hour; he's as tired as he was the days leading up to Lazarus.
In the past, there had been discussions like this when John just had to shut down momentarily in order to process information and then return to his son. There were so many blank minutes and hours that John had to explain weren't angry silences, but were honestly his time to research whatever Hamish had said. Now was one of those times. Within the span of a few minutes Hamish had thrown so much information at him he was unsure what to say.
Even though they did their very best to come back as dignified as they could, smoothing out wrinkled tartans and kilts and mussed hair, Sherlock felt that all John's kisses and touches were seared on his skin so his entire family would see them.
"What do you want from me?" He begins. He thinks of Sherlock's hands on his ribs, his mouth, his fingers across his jaw. Love must be his vicious motivator.
"Shower, shave, for god's sake, brush your teeth, then you're taking me out for brunch," Sherlock quirked an eyebrow up at her, "No arguments, go!"
Tavis grew impatient waiting for William so he boiled water and filled Sherlock's tub. He scrubbed his cousin from head to toe, pulling out fresh linens for him to wear and piling up his filthy older plaids outside the door. Sherlock was completely silent, ignoring Tavis' attempts at conversation. He felt stung as he remembered everything that had transpired during the day. When Sherlock was done with his bath and all dressed, his headache came back with a vengeance. He laid down on his bed, his arm over his eyes to block out the light.
"I'm not sure. When I was chatting up Molly last night he came up and talked to her. Well, by talking, they signed. I just figured it was the fastest way for them to communicate. That, or they wanted to talk about me."
John blinks, looks down at his coffee, "I won't lie to him. I won't tell him anything that isn't true. He doesn't deserve that."
Sherlock wrapped his long fingers all the way around John's wrist, pulling his hand slowly towards his body. Sherlock hesitated a moment, letting John's relaxed fingers drift over his belly. He turned, instead he brought his hand to his nipples. Sherlock was fascinated that he would even crave John's touch there. Looking down, he caught John's cock had jumped in response. He continued to grow, the pink, dusky head pulling out from the foreskin.
"Sweet Jesus pull yourself together," John said, out loud. Sherlock turned around at that moment and saw him, and John wondered if Sherlock had heard him. Realizing that was ridiculous, he paid the cabbie and began walking towards Sherlock, thinking how frumpy he must look in his work scrubs compared to Sherlock's GQ look.
"No, you're ridiculous," John kisses Sherlock, wrapping his fingers through those curls, tickling Sherlock's ribs with his other hand.
John wants to ask but it feels too close to his actions. He knows it's not "human error." It's what he's wanted and couldn't say, couldn't bring himself to say, and he's saying it now. Keep the nerves and heartbeat and clandestine meetings easily explainable.
Moriarty is watching Mary's flat from a dirty alleyway. It's been forever, it's been a few hours, he's been digging for clues just with his eyes. He crouches, his thighs tight and his knees ache. He thinks of Seb, and the only way out of this is through. To him. That's the only way. This, obligation. To his enemies. He shivers, pulling the sweatshirt closer to his body.
Jim Moriarty is supervising a team of 23 laborers who are proceeding under the assumption they are building a rather elaborate set piece for a traveling theatre company.
He looked over the crowd, scanning, but he didn't see anyone else in the Watson tartan. He saw a sea of blue and black of the Holmes, and the few yellow and green of Lestrades. He saw his parents, and the white embroidered fabric of the handfasting cloth and cord, this time woven with the fabrics of both the Holmes and Watson clans. He stood there, perplexed, until he realized the silence of everyone stopping their conversation and looking at him.
Sherlock's six cousins stopped and gawked at him. Norris dropped his glass of mead and stumbled to catch it. Eric opened and closed his mouth, finally speaking, "Oh, Sherlock."
Mrs. Watson laughed, patting Sherlock's arm, "Yes, it is a great name." She turned to John's father, "I like him."
Sherlock dropped his soap when William mentioned bedroom oil. Of course, he'd been talked to about the basic mechanics of lovemaking, but he couldn't understand how those particular acts between two men could be pleasurable.
Now, Tavis smiled and clapped his large hand over Sherlock's entire shoulder, "Mycroft getting married today, eh? Then little Sherlock will be next." Tavis winked. Sherlock felt his cheeks and chest flush. He knew that's what it meant, he was next in line, but he'd hoped to put it off for years. Mycroft was difficult to match, rejecting the first five suitors his mother brought forward. Gregory Lestrade was a rare love match. He came to their clan when his horse had lamed while traveling from his clan to trade wool.
Sherlock bounced up and used the stallion's mane to climb upon his back. He hadn't regularly ridden a horse for years, something he'd missed so desperately, and now he'd been given a horse of his own. He looked at his betrothed. Even though Soilleir was smaller and overweight, John looked regal upon her. He looked every bit of a clan leader, familiar with hard work and defending his flock and land from others. He imagined his Da had looked that way years ago, handsome and ready to take on the world.
John's heart aches, "Oh Sherlock, I am so sorry." He kisses his temple, his fingers in his hair, "Oh, Sherlock," John thinks of the plan for Mycroft. Today. He must make the inevitable happen today. "Sherlock, come up here, please."
Mycroft texts John and Sherlock that they need to be ready to move within the next two weeks. His intelligence is sketchy; the sources aren't quite sure when Jim and Mary are set to meet about their secret plan.
"No," John answers, arm over his eyes to block out the light, "I was a little preoccupied." He peeks out from under his arm to see Sherlock smiling.
"John, my love, look at me," Sherlock's nose bumps John's and they laugh, "I love you. I've missed you." They kiss, more sharply, as Sherlock presses in another finger.
"Because, we care about not catching whatever diseases were on that foot and fingers that were in there, and we care about you, too. Hamish thought you'd get mad and then realize we did it because we liked you."
From the text, he knew something volatile happened between Sherlock and Mary, but Sherlock was safe.
Sherlock felt a bit less shy in looking at him. John Watson was truly shorter, but compact with muscle. He was bronzed where Sherlock was pale. His hair was golden sunshine where Sherlock's was raven black. John's hair was a bit scraggly, but it was shorn close to the head. Sherlock had shoulder length ringlets. John wore a cropped, light ginger beard. Sherlock didn't have much facial hair, and what he did have he kept shaved. They were quite the opposite looking couple, but they wore matching dark tartans.
"I was, too. I've never been so terrified. Hamish took care of us, too, though, didn't he? I watched him pick up that chair and bash him over the head. It was amazing. I couldn't move fast enough to get to you, and he had already untied himself and was ready to help you."
The five men are set down, more gently than John anticipated, their weapons piled near the door by the tacticals. When they are sitting and they are secured with ropes, and they each have a gun barrel to their head, Mycroft begins speaking, "co víte o žena volá sama Mary Morstanová?"
Jim's eyes shifted back and forth across the video image as they listened to Seb on speaker. He was either the finest actor (which he was) or he was insane with worry. Moriarty wraps his arms around himself, cradling his arms to his torso, leaning into the voice on the phone. His whispers were passionate, desperate, concerned.
Hearing John say Greg's name, twice in the span of 30 seconds, and the snippets of context indicated John had just been on the phone with him. Sherlock hung up, John unable to hear him anyway.
"John." He gives him a final, dark look, "You will be alone with her no longer than necessary. Only at the very end of the plan will you reconcile. We are all working together; no secrets, but some pieces I must keep to myself for security and to ensure your safety. If you don't know, no one can pressure you for that information."
"Mary was to take me out- which she believes she has. Magnussen doesn't want to be on equal ground with Mary. He controls. Magnussen knows John is Mary's pressure point, and to control her, he's got to control John."
Sherlock has spent all day writing, typing, editing. Mycroft is on his way over to the flat with some food and movies for John (Sherlock hopes he's happily surprised.) John is still asleep in their bed. They'd spent most of last night wrapped around each other, facing each other under the blankets.
"Sherlock, you look exhausted. Food, and then sleep, ok? I don't want to have to nurse you back to health again," But John was still smiling, pushing himself up off the floor, giving Sherlock a hand to pull up and stand up. When they were both standing, John squeezed Sherlock close and kissed his neck and jawline.
Mummy Holmes is grinning, Daddy Holmes is weeping, "The last time they were together," he says, patting Billy's shoulder, "Is when Magnussen was threatening our family. He wanted to get to Mycroft, so he was going to pull everything about us into his papers. Mycroft's boyfriend, Sherlock's sociopath diagnosis, Roderick's affair with a woman 8 years older-"
Sherlock, however, was heartbroken. He didn't understand why he wasn't liked, why kids hated how he knew everything, and why he didn't understand girls. It was maddening. He did his best to imitate Mycroft in this; not caring, marching along and explaining he was really a sociopath. Mycroft is not sure where that idea popped in his head, but he never corrected him.
John moved his thumb, curving a bit so he could push a finger into the ring of muscle, entering his body slowly, "I feel you. I feel your pulse. Please, my lovely boy. My husband."
John busied himself with the toast, turning the heat off the pan. It could be costumes. It could be a stakeout. It could be flying to Belize. Anything, anything at all. John was used to this, the never ending surprise. Over the past few months, he'd come to admit to himself that he loved it. He'd let the dates with women go to the wayside, preferring his time with Sherlock, as celibate as it was, than anytime with anyone else. He'd do anything for him.
She wasn't pregnant. No belly. No waddle. She was thin again, walking briskly. Possibly, thinner than when he'd first met her.
He backtracked his way towards the flat. When he was a few blocks away, he stopped by his favorite flower shop and created a custom bouquet of red roses surrounded with myrtle and purple violets. While paying, he saw a familiar black car through the shop window. He rolled his eyes, but he was grateful he didn't have to carry a large vase of water and flowers all the way back home. When he crawled in, he was shocked to see Sherlock sitting in the back.
"Mary shot him," John says, no hello, no start. Mycroft and he always get right to the point when discussing Sherlock. As before, everything moves so fast, they've always gotten to the point: "he took drugs and I found him in a drug house. Please come to the flat."
The two men sit, taking Angelo's recommendations of wine and food. Rather than typing on their phones, Sherlock requests more paper napkins, and instead scribbles notes and bits of conversation on them. It feels more intimate. Over pudding, and while easily buzzed over splitting two bottles of red wine, Sherlock takes John's hands and helps him properly form signs. It's when Sherlock teaches him the sign for
Sherlock jumped up, running his fingers along the bottom of each bill. He jumped up, his chair clattering across the kitchen floor, "Daemon, the understudies. Look at the understudies."
John notices the strange scrap of fabric wrapped around Sherlock's neck, in place of a scarf. It's a Tshirt.
"John, I…I care for you a lot, too. I'm not used to this, either. I am not good at this. But you don't love me. You love Greg."
Greg clapped his shoulder and left him to go to the interpreters and talk with Molly. John waved goodbye and went another direction. He knew part of his boredom was his work. He was going to change that immediately.
John pushed his chair back, grabbing the oil and pocketing it into his own kilt. He held out his hand, and Sherlock took it, shaking. He had no idea what Tavis had to do with what John was going to do to him.
Sherlock remembered how John said he'd wanted to be matched with him. John was fascinated by Sherlock and Mycroft working on experiments and then asked his clan matchmaker for help. John loved the very traits and habits that made him feel strange and off-putting to others.
John tried to come up with a good reason why he didn't think of Molly. He had none. He gave an honest explanation.
The room was quiet as Sherlock worked on his eyes, blending and smoothing. He felt John's breathing speed up just slightly, and Sherlock smiled. He smoothed the pad of his thumbs over his eyebrows, then quietly whispered for John to open his eyes.
John asked Sherlock if he was ok. No response. He stood in front of him. Nothing. Completely blank. He coughed, interjecting, "John Hamish Watson."
"John, my love," the violin is laid aside, and Sherlock pulls John's face up to his, running his thumbs over his cheeks. "My love, what's wrong?"
"William, that is not the Holmes tartan," Sherlock stated, holding it up in his fingers. The Holmes tartan design was mostly a deep blue with a few stripes of black. This tartan that he held was a woven design of greens, reds, yellows that formed squares as the small lines of colors draped over each other. So used to seeing all his family in the unlined dark blue, this type of tartan was striking and vibrant.
"You scared me, Sherlock. I never want to see you in the same room as Moriarty again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." John holds him, rubbing his back, "I didn't handle it right. I wasn't faking loving you, ok? I can't fake that. I was just intimate with you more quickly to cover up what Mycroft and I were doing. That's all. Please. Please, I love you my prince, forgive me. If you can't forgive me, I understand. I mean every word. Every word I said, everything in the letters."
John pulled Sherlock, manuvering him to sit on the bed. John stood in front of him, holding his head in his hands, "O' my wee li'l scone. I've been i'love wi'yee for a long time. You dont 'ave to wear a thing 'or me, laddie."
As they pulled up to the kerb of 221B, Mrs. Hudson nearly sprinted to meet them. Sherlock wrangled John and their small suitcases of clothes and toiletries until John could walk far enough so Mrs. Hudson could help steady him. John was beaming.
Tavis looked at Sherlock, grabbing a towel from Sherlock's bed. He started to speak, then stopped, then restarted again, "Have you ever wanted to, Sherlock? I've never seen you with anyone. Do you understand how lovemaking works between men?"
After he pulls the blankets up over him, Mycroft sits on Sherlock's bed, unknowingly on John's side, and smooths his brothers hair until he feels his breathing and muscles relax.
Sherlock grabbed John, shaking him by his shoulders, "It was Mrs. Hudson's husband. Get yourself together. We'll find them."
Everything they do now must be more quiet. No violin, no yelling near the window, no leaving the flat without protection and disguise. But the memories, and the hope of living together, in love, in the future, keeps Sherlock's thoughts from spinning into a sulk or self pity.
Sherlock hadn't understood why Mycroft loved Gregory, but he couldn't stand his brother's red rimmed eyes or Gregory Lestrade's slumped shoulders. He had gone into his parents' room, after thinking for hours for options, and offered himself as a groom instead. He knew that men and women thought he was attractive, and he would make the best of it, and hoped for someone that was at least tolerable. He knew he'd assured his brother's happiness, but he couldn't believe that he'd secured his own.
"Sherlock, I'm sorry, I'm sorry about everything to do with her, that was one of the greatest regrets of my life, truly," Sherlock didn't raise his eyes, but he shifted his weight from one foot to another. "I am not playing with you. You told me you need us to marry for a case, then annul it. I simply replied I am amenable to staying married."
John resurfaced as if he were coming up from underwater. For a moment, he thought they had just buried him at sea, not knowing he was still alive.
Tavis touched Sherlock's cheek, "Are you alright, rùnach?" He draped the tartan around Sherlock's shoulders, smoothing all his clothing, "If John Watson is not good to you , Sherlock, I will kill him. He knows that."
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's neck, pulling him closer into his arms. He continued to kiss the smooth surface of John's lip, his cheeks, "I know. But we'll move far too quickly if I stay here. If we stay here.
Mycroft continues, "He's safe in my bolt hole. He will be well cared for and returned to you once this is all over."
Sherlock blushed, "When you said that we couldn't travel very much after our first coupling. I agree with you, I imagine I'll be quite sore soon."
Sherlock looked around at all his cousins. Now, rather than looking amused, they were frowning, scratching at their beards. They all turned to Tavis, waiting for him to speak.
John put his arm on the back on the couch, "Based on your weight and size, you've got about an hour before you become incredibly sleepy."
Sherlock was ready to explain it, just small pieces (only lies have details); A shot. Grazing the liver. Then running around, not taking care of himself, staph infection on top of blood poisoning, HEP B from prolonged unsafe IV drug use. Perfect cocktail for a slow, fatal liver degeneration.
As morning streams in the windows, John considers his next action. He wants to kiss, stroke, pull him so close. He's hardly remembered what it's like to have sex with a man; heated and angrier than sex with most women.
William, red faced, looked John up and down. He pursed his lips, and shut the door with a small snap.
John swoops in for a kiss, pulling Sherlock's waist, and grabbing his arse at the same time. He feels Sherlock's erection against his and he he delves into Sherlock's mouth with his tongue. John had promised himself he would be slow and gentle, but Sherlock was grabbing at John in kind. They were pulling at each other's shirts, desperately undressing as they ground against each other.
The cruise ship left from Southampton every Monday at 7:00am. They traveled to Southampton by train on Sunday. During the trip, John dozed for at least thirty minutes. The rest of the way they sat in companionable silence, Sherlock smiling once when he caught John looking at him in the afternoon light. John felt butterflies when he thought about sharing a room, and sharing a bed, with his detective.
Everyone screams, jumps. The woman in black is gesturing, yelling at the rest of the group. They are panicking, crying.
After a few minutes,when John's face was red and Tavis looked fully chastised, both of them walked over to Sherlock. Tavis offered to go back inside, but John cut him off, "No, I want you to witness this, too."
His mother Victoria explained, "You've been out for two days. Moving and thrashing, talking in circles. You were fading out quickly. Your breathing was getting weaker. John and his clansmen are gone working on a blackhouse plot, set on flat ground, near our house, in case you were invalided. We were afraid we would be slowly watching you waste away…." Victoria Holmes dabbed at her eyes with her plaid. Stuart Holmes reached out and patted  her hand.
John groaned and closed his eyes against the rattle in his skull. "No, it was at least six weeks. I saw a chance and I took it. You have opportunity, you can do the same."
Sherlock went back to the kitchen before he heard any more, turning on the water in the kitchen sink. As he filled it to  the top with warm, soapy water and dirty dishes, he whistled to himself to drown out their conversation. As Sherlock was soaping up a plate, he considered how his ribs were nearly free of aches. Waking up alone in his flat was so much different than waking up here with John and Hamish.
They walked another block in silence. John continued to walk in front, his head still down, his pace fast. The sun was nearly up, the light casting large shadows on the street. They were nearly to John's apartment.
She's meticulous, fastidious, maddening. She has assassins working for her, she's brutal, willing to die. From this vantage point, he knows she hasn't left her flat in some time. The plan she's placed is still for Sherlock to kill Magnussen.
"Please, will you get in with me? I am so cold," Sherlock gave him a smile, "You are already stripped."
At 3:47am, an ambulance was called for Harry's panic attack, 52 minutes after Phillip Anderson was proclaimed dead due to major internal bleeding that couldn't be stopped.
John loved the way Sherlock said his name after kissing him, after he took him in his mouth. His voice was slightly raspy, but happy. No one else could tell the change in the timbre of Sherlock's voice, but John could.
Then his heart stopped. In John's arms. And John couldn't watch Sherlock leave him again. And Sherlock understood John.
John smiled, picking up the reins, urging Soilleir away from the crowd. the mare went at a brisk pace, unconcerned with the yelling and congratulations being shouted at the former bachelors. Sherlock sat right next to John, snuggling in for heat in the early morning air, "How long is it to your house?"
John led Sherlock into his flat. He rubbed his shoulders, the middle of his back. He could tell he was upset, breathing rapidly, eyes shifting.
John felt Sherlock lean away from him and lean towards Hamish, "You were worried about being able to call me Papa?"
Robert knows the CCTV cameras are watching him, watching everyone, so he dresses in his absolute best suit, dressed like a groom. Boutonniere and everything; complete with a nervous gait. He's wearing a blonde wig, makeup to lighten his skin.
His anchor for the Mary Morstan file, what ties it all together in a bow for him, is a large hunting knife. The imagery to keep it tied to her file is her using that knife 7 years ago to slit her husband's throat and then drown her 6 year old child in their tub.
John is content to lay in the grass, feel the air turn cooler and condensation settle on him as the sun goes down. He hears no traffic, no planes, and just sees a few lights click on at the other end of the airport. He doesn't have his phone, must have left it on the plane, so he assumes there is no way for anyone to track him. Or, they may be leaving him alone.
"I've been better. I've been worse," John tries to turn to face Sherlock, but the room starts to spin again, "Oh, Jesus."
"I don't....I don't know. I just...." John buries his face into the crook of Sherlock's arm, "I'm just sad for some reason. Sad for all the missed time...the way I've treated you...I don't know."
"Oh, Sherlock," John sobbed, falling to his knees on the ground, resting his head on Sherlock's lap, "You're awake!"
"Sherlock," John tugs gently on Sherlock's curls, kissing the corner of his mouth, "I will do whatever it takes. Whatever I need," John rubs his thumb, his fingers against Sherlock's collarbone, "I have some ideas, but I will do what I need for you to be safe."
John grinned, pulling Sherlock and Hamish close. Hamish giggled, "We'll need to get you a matching ring, then, papa!" Hamish looked at his daddy's face, then crinkled his eyebrows, "Oh, I think daddy was looking at white gold. It goes more with the army tags he also wanted to give you."
"Sometimes he does. Earlier, was trying to tell you to be quiet about the case when he was working on my back, right?"
Sherlock gets up, all legs, arms, crosses down to the end of the bed, is unsure. John gets on his knees, reaches, urges Sherlock to get in the bed with a pull on his wrist.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, "We have to get in there, we can't wait for the team to get here. I know the layout, I can climb up the back and get in there, see what is going on."
When Mycroft arrives he expects to sit down to a cup of tea and a serious, tear filled chat about John and Sherlock and Mary and John's marriage falling apart. (Mycroft conveniently leaves out the part that Mary was the one who shot Sherlock.) He doesn't know why he's rambling on about John and Sherlock.
tried to kiss me, I turned. I couldn't bear the thought of him touching me. Only you. When I touch myself, it's only you I think of."
Sherlock grinned as he ran his fingers over John's hand to take the phone back. He typed a response, turning the phone so John could read it.
Sherlock stripped down, sinking into the nearly too hot water. As his skin turned pink, he scrubbed at it with the ball of soap William handed him. After a few moments, he crushed fragrant leaves into his bath water. Sherlock raised his eyebrows in a question.
"I'll miss you," John said, pulling him close and tucking his head on his chest, "Don't get into any trouble."
"Oh, my prince, I'm sorry." John guides him, places him in the front of the tub where the water is warmer, the doctor climbs in behind him and adjusts so Sherlock is leaning back onto John.
John couldn't help smiling thinking of the future, of a possibility of being in Sherlock's world for the long term. He took the phone from Sherlock and put it on the bedside table, crawling up on his lap. He circled his legs around his back, Sherlock falling back onto the bed. He kissed the man, grinning, using tongue and teeth and moaning into his mouth. Sherlock was silent, except for wet sounds of saliva and puffs of air as he felt their desire grow. John pulled back, taking the lubricant, showing Sherlock as he moved his fingers to his own entrance to stretch. He didn't know how Sherlock wanted to have sex but he felt the tip of his cock pushing the cleft of his arse and he wanted him inside him. Sherlock moaned as he watched John curl back, impaled on his own fingers, their cocks lined up and bumping into one another. Sherlock tapped John's face and Sherlock made a sign, his entire right hand pinched in against his chin and then pulled out a way from his face like an opening flower. John shook his head, unsure, and Sherlock mouthed
"But your daddy loves you, and your grandma and grandpa love you, and people who try to be your friends, they love you exactly as you are. You don't have to be clever for them. They know you're clever. You also can't be rude to them. Or impatient. Or hurtful. You may want to, but those you love, who are around you all the time, you have to practice being patient."
Sherlock thought carefully before answering, "Not very long, Mrs. Watson. We just met at the theatre and we became friends right away."
Mrs. Hudson was shaking, but was set right with some whiskey. She couldn't imagine going back to her flat, and Sherlock made it clear that she could stay as long as she wanted, and forever would be just fine. She went to her bedroom and was asleep quickly.
"You sent everyone away?" Sherlock asks in wonder. He pulls on John's shirt as he moves onto the bed, falling backwards with a huff.
as John had taken to calling it, "Well, there is an issue with the owner of the ship we'll be on. This cruise ship, the Baetica, is owned Elias Openshaw. To commemorate gay marriage becoming legal in the UK,  he wants to hold a marriage ceremony between members of the same sex. He's assumed, like most of England that we're a couple," At this, Sherlock slows down, more carefully choosing words, "He would like to officiate our marriage," Sherlock is so close now, John has a hard time getting the food on the plates and on the table. John looks at his face, and Sherlock is biting his lip.
John gave Sherlock a smile, "We should ride back home on the horses completely naked. That will give them something to discuss!"
A hand fisted in his hair and pulled his head up, but he was too weak to even look the other man in the eyes. "Will you talk now?" the auburn-haired man asked. This was the third time he had asked. John shook his head. "Fuck off," he grunted, not even knowing the question that he was supposed to be answering, but damned if he was going to talk to someone who had just spent two weeks torturing him. John's hair was released and his head dropped back to his chest again.
John could tell that there was something else, but he didn't push. He stared down at his sandwich, poking it with his finger. He sighed and pushed the food away, resting his head in his hands.
"Oh, I'm definitely special," Sherlock murmured, tugging at John's hair lightly with his free hand. He let out a breath, smiling as John nuzzled his wrist. "I love you," he said softly, scooting down and cuddling down more to wrap himself more around John.
Sherlock sat up carefully, sitting Hamish between his knees and holding him so the pup could sit upright and watch them. He took the cup, not mentioning anything about the signs of crying, or the absence of John's tags. He took a sip, looking back at Hamish. "I think he is okay, he's only four months old, he doesn't understand what it is he saw. He seems attentive enough..." he said, smiling at Hamish who grinned at him.
“You remember precisely John,” he said. “You were stabbed, nearly died. However, I happened by you and was able to help. Just in time, as it were.” The tone from the other seemed to say more with the second statement. As if there was some unsaid meaning laced into the words ‘in time’.
Sherlock sighed. "Tedious..." he muttered, still smiling a small bit as well. He pushed himself up a little, John's tags hanging from his neck and brushing across the man's chest as he rolled off of him. "Alright... may as well just get it over with," he murmured, tangling his fingers with John's for a moment and giving them a slight squeeze.
“Careful… just, take it easy. You’re safe,” a baritone voice laced with worry said, as a pair of hands appeared and helped him sit up against the headboard. John blinked a couple times, rubbing his head.
Two. And I don't think I like how often they're sending you out. The dream was...was nothing. I just...I forgot to take my pills that day or something. In it I....I lost the baby. Not like that mind you, not like last time. I had him, he was already here and beautiful. I can't remember what he looked like. But then...he just wasn't. And I couldn't find him anywhere, and then you came home. You came home and it was supposed to be happy but I didn't have him, and you just kept asking where he was, what I had done. The conversation went on for a bit...nothing you would really say I know...you'd never say things like that.
He pulled his eyes open, realising that in his dreams he could never remember John's scent, and now he had it. He blinked a few times, looking at John and curling up on his side, curling into him. "You're real this time," he said drowsily.
"Because most are unconscious by now..." the man grinned, and Sherlock stepped back, looking at his arm and seeing a needle there.
Sherlock was sprawled on the sofa now, plucking at his violin and scratching at the patch on his arm. Only one today; he didn't have a case on so that was all he needed. What he wanted though... God, he just wanted to stop thinking. For a minute. Something to just make it stop.
Mindy nodded at Sherlock, complimenting how it looked on him. She turned her attention to Katherine then, watching her open the last of her presents. She stood with a happy sound, running over and wrapping her arms around Mindy's neck, which she happily returned.
John scrubbed his hands over his face, letting out a long breath into them. He supposed he had expected having to tell at least Harry; he just hadn't thought it would be right away.
"You know, I don't expect you to cook for me," John said, looking over his shoulder at the Omega. "I'm a perfectly good bachelor. I learnt how to cook before I even got to uni." He poured spaghetti sauce over the meat, turning the heat down to a low simmer before adding in basil and oregano and just a dash of garlic powder. "Come taste this, tell me what you think."
John swore loudly, slamming up into Sherlock as his knot swelled and he released inside of him. His legs shook, his hand holding tightly to the back of Sherlock's thigh, his other fisted tightly in his hair. "Give me a moment," he whispered, leaning heavily against Sherlock, unable to move at the moment.
John closed his eyes tighter, pressing his hand against Sherlock's chest. "I am sorry for leaving, though. I want to stay here with you."
"He's under sedation," she explained, leading Sherlock from the waiting room and down a hall. "He had a cracked rib, and his clavicle is a mess, but that's an old wound. He had a mild concussion, but he needed sleep. Heavy bruising on the ribs and jaw. Offensive abrasions on his knuckles." She opened a door, gesturing him inside. "He'll live. He'll just be hurting for a while."
John cocked his head, his brow furrowing as he watched Sherlock. "You really want me to go see her. How come?" he asked quietly. He didn't want to go, wanted nothing of it until he got back. It was going to be hard enough missing Sherlock; he didn't want to have a sister to miss on top of it.
"Papa's not bad though. Papa...got rid of bad man." She said, resting a hand on his uninjured cheek. "And helps people get better,” she said with a yawn. She shifted a bit on the bed, thumb entering her mouth once more as she started to doze off.
"Sorry, what?" John asked, looking over at Sherlock by the body. There wasn't time for an answer, however, because Molly chose that moment to walk in. "Hey, Molly," John greeted, raising his hand in a wave.
Wordlessly, John took Sherlock's hands out of his hair, kissing them gently and holding them in one of his hands, carding his other through Sherlock's sweat-damp hair. His heart clenched for Sherlock, and he was grateful that he was a doctor, or it would most definitely be harder for him to withstand this.
Sherlock shuddered a little, biting back a small sob as he hid his face in her neck. "I don't want them to take him away again," he said quietly, shaking a bit. "You know by now...if Harry didn't tell you, you know," he said, thinking towards the growing pup in him. He sniffed a bit, his face horrifically red from embarrassment. "I'm sorry," he said, straightening up and pulling away. "He's your son...you're probably more upset, and here I am....idiot," he said, shaking his head and walking over towards the kettle.
“It would appear so.” John looked at him steadily and let out a breath. “John, I understand you have questions, as is your right. But did you want to perhaps discuss that or the reason Mike brought you here?” he asked.
Lestrade nodded. "Yeah, stormed the place, got everyone out. They're not talking, though, much, maybe hoping they'll all get lesser sentences, but the conditions of that place, twenty Omega's to one room, and –"
Thoughts of the war, of leaving Sherlock, swarmed John’s mind, and he chased them away with images of coming home safe, of Sherlock pregnant and caring for their pups, who all hopefully had Sherlock's curls. He smiled to himself, relaxing against Sherlock and closing his eyes, eventually drifting off to sleep.
Sherlock sighed, sitting at the table and spinning his glass slowly. He supposed he did have a bit of an appetite. He sighed, picking up the sandwich and nibbling on it a little.
he remembered, taking another breath. He quickly moved down the hallway and into the room, crawling over the bed and reaching into John's beside drawer. He pulled it out, looking at it. It was different than the gun he'd shot that murderer with, and it took him a second to look it over, finding the safety. He backed up from the bed and headed back down the hall.
to be with Sherlock. His stomach had dropped, his heart in his throat, and he couldn't think past getting back to Sherlock's side. He whimpered when the door was shut on him, and he was stuck out in the hallway. He paced fiercely, up and down in front of the door. He looked up, hoping for news, his daughter getting set in his arms instead. He tried to ask how Sherlock was, but the reply that he was being taken care of was brief, and didn't settle John's stomach.
Sherlock sighed, gently rocking Katherine in his arms, soothing her. He couldn't take care of John if their daughter was screaming. He walked out into the living room, sitting down in his chair and unbuttoning his shirt, letting Kat latch on, she'd be fussing soon about being hungry, and Sherlock wanted to avoid that. He looked over his shoulder at John, waiting a moment.
John smiled kindly over at him. "I was already planning on making enough for two," he replied kindly. He stepped away from the noodles, working on the simple sauce over another burner until the noodles boiled properly and he could strain them.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, turning from the window to look at John. He turned and leant over, catching a look of himself in the hall mirror. "That's just my face," he said, a little bemused.
John smiled, feeling the bed behind him. "What's gotten into you?" he asked, sitting down and pulling Sherlock onto his lap, nuzzling under his jaw, licking a slow line up to his ear and sucking the lobe between his lips.
"Sherlock, I'm fine, alright?" John held Katherine loosely, having picked her up when Sherlock had left. "I just need some better sleeping pills and it'll all be fine." He ran his fingers through his daughter's hair, trying to force the motion to calm him, but he was still on edge.
John ducked his head, the anger fading out of him to be replaced by shame and sorrow for the brothers. "Sorry. It's just... seeing him like he was yesterday... I get defensive of him quickly."
He looked at the clock next to his bedside table, nearly four in the morning. He sighed, standing up and crossing the room to his desk. He pulled out his laptop, hesitating as he saw his Browning in the drawer. It was loaded, he knew it was loaded, because he checked it.
He held it out to Katherine, "Do you think you can take care of this one? Maybe someday you can go on a case with me." he said with a smile, "You can solve things around the flat till then." he said as Katherine gasped, taking the magnifying glass with a gleeful laugh.
Sherlock quickly changed Katherine and scooped her up, holding her head carefully. He looked over at John, smiling as he watched him bustle about the kitchen. "We're having some pasta for lunch. Though not for you little one. You wouldn't like it anyway," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead as the infant cooed.
Sherlock shrugged lightly. "I don't know, not really his thing I suppose," he said quietly. "For all he knows, I lost it entirely," he murmured. "Though he might check the records eventually," he said with a small sigh. He leant his head on John's shoulder more, settling more against him. "God, I'm starving. We're getting food like... as soon as we're home. Pineapple though, remember," he said.
"I like Michael," John said quietly, nuzzling against Sherlock before kissing him softly again. "I hope he is a boy as we're thinking. And I hope he has blond hair and your beautiful eyes. I don't want a carbon copy of me running around. One John Watson is plenty," he teased, worrying Sherlock's lower lip between his teeth.
John held onto Sherlock tightly, possessively, while the Omega napped, tucking Sherlock's head under his chin. "I don't want to leave you," he whispered into the empty room, closing his eyes and wishing it was that easy for himself to fall asleep.
Sherlock tensed a little as John lifted her so quickly, still cradling her head of course. "Um, she just ate so... be careful," he said, then realised what John said. "Don't encourage it! It's cute to a point then it's just..." he shook his hand a little. He sighed, smiling despite himself.
Sherlock hummed, watching them with a smile that felt permanently etched on his face. Katherine looked over at them, and then back up at her papa. "Been helping Daddy with Misha...jus'like I promised," she said quietly.
John pushed himself into a sitting position, sliding back against the wall and just staring. Both windows were blown in, glass was strewn everywhere, and he realised that that was why his arm was bleeding. His head was swimming, unable to make a huge amount of sense from what had happened.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. "I am... though I'm not sure why. I can hardly 'read' myself," he said quietly.
Sherlock settled on top of John, resting his head on his chest. "I love you...always." he murmured. He nodded a little, "I couldn't forget that John, never. I wouldn't be here...if not for you." he said quietly. "My life...it's yours, always will be." he said quietly. "Mon John," he breathed.
"We should probably eat something before you fall asleep, yes," John replied a little breathlessly when he had pulled back, smiling broadly down at Sherlock. "Come on, I'll fix us something. Do you want me to put a bandage on your neck?" he inquired, standing from the bed and walking into the kitchen, starting the stove and pulling out a couple cans of chunky beef stew, pouring them into a pot and setting it over a burner.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, looking down when he felt an uncomfortable nudge. He furrowed his brow, he'd hardly felt anything before... just small flutters that felt like nerves, but this... was different. He put his hand on his stomach, not able to feel it from the outside, but inside was different.
"Someone needs a change then? Maybe something to eat?" he asked in what he prayed was a calm voice, gently bouncing the infant as he walked back to their room, setting her on the bed and grabbing a diaper and some wipes. He'd become a pro at this, looking up at John occasionally.
Sherlock felt a tug in his chest, and tried to ignore it, but his body got the best of him and he leant back against John, letting out a slow breath, his red rimmed eyes looking across the room. He licked his chapped lips, feeling John's breath on the nape of his neck, his own breathing starting to match that of the Alpha’s.
John shrugged, picking up the bottle and moving for the stairs. "Alright, then. I don't want to hear you complaining when you get sick, then," he said, starting downstairs.
Base got tired of waiting, so they decided to send out a team to go looking for the bastards who sent the bomb threat. Guess who got the lucky job?
Harry however, was not. "Bloody hell, John, didn't waste any time did you? Congratulations!" she said, clapping John on the back, her comment making Sherlock's face warm even more.
John smiled softly down at him. "Alright." He turned to leave after one more gentle kiss to his forehead, but paused by the door.
"Stop," he commanded. "Stop apologising. Stop bringing it up, alright?" He didn't want to admit it, but every time he thought he had forgotten about it, Sherlock seemed to mention it again and it was like a hot poker getting stabbed through his ribs. "It's done, it happened, but now you're back. So
John's jaw muscle worked as he rubbed his hand over Sherlock's back. "I don't want to wait another three months to mark you again," he said, nuzzling against Sherlock's temple. Though, honestly, once Sherlock got far enough in go the heat, he would probably let him anyway. "And I can put an IV in myself, anyway."
Sherlock felt his chest tighten as John spoke, feeling more and more terrible for him, holding his hand tightly. He pressed closer to John, trying to be sturdy for him like he was for Sherlock.
Katherine dozed for a little over an hour, finally squirming in her rocker a little with a small whine.
Sherlock dozed for a little while longer before he woke up finally to hearing a noise. He blinked his eyes open a few times, seeing Katherine asleep on the bed across from him. He heard the noise again and rolled out of the bed, wandering down the hall and into the living room, seeing the knives sticking out of the wall, and the knife holes from where others had been pried out, most of the holes on the smiley face on the wall. He cleared his throat, announcing himself so as to not startle John.
"J-John... make it... stop," Sherlock worked out, curling up into a ball. He thought of those points John had pressed last night, frantically trying to find them with his own shaking fingers and soon giving up.
Sherlock's thoughts stuttered a small bit when John's voice took on that tone. He hummed lightly, his head leaning into the touch, one of his bandages tugging as some of his hair got caught under it, probably from sleeping. "Mm love your everything," he murmured. "Does that mean I win?" he asked, his eyes closed, a small smirk on his face.
John rubbed his eyes, setting the carrier down on an empty chair. "I took her temperature rectally. It was 38.5 degrees, and the device is brand new." He looked helplessly down at their daughter and then back up at the doctor. "I just don't know what it could be. She wasn't showing any earlier signs. It showed up within the time that I fell asleep, and for it to have risen that much..."
John rested his hand on the Omega's knee, giving it a light squeeze. "It's fine, love, really," he promised, forking up some of the chicken on his plate and eating it. Elbowing Sherlock in the arm, he ate another piece. "Take bigger bites than that," he said gently, smiling kindly at him.
“Six months is a good place to start,” John said softly, tightening his arm around Katherine so she wouldn’t feel left out. “But yeah, he probably needs it sooner with as much as he’s eating,” he commented. Sherlock nodded.
," he said quickly, rattling it all off and letting out a breath to try and steady himself before he started crying again.
John hid his wince with a skill that he had mastered over the last two years. "That's a bond mark," he said evenly, reaching into the medical kit for a needle and stitching string. He filled a pan with the alcohol and put the items into it, letting them sterilise for a moment.
"No," John said firmly, shaking his head and holding Katherine a little tighter, more comforting. "No, you are going to take care of our pups. This is my business; this is what I do. I am not going to have you getting hurt over this." The metal of his gun burned cold fire against the small of his back, and he couldn't wait to use it, couldn't wait to pull them all apart for what they did to him and his mother, and especially to his daughter.
John moved his finger around, slowly sliding it in and out and gradually adding a second finger. "Easy," he breathed, tightening his hand around Sherlock's and kissing his hip again when Sherlock tightened around him, resisting.
"I know," John said, grinning like a cat with a mouse trapped between its paws. "I also know that you like acting helpless when you're really not," he whispered, leaning down to trail his lips up the centre of Sherlock's stomach, having that be their only point of contact. "You could take what you wanted. Why don't you?"
John smiled, shaking his head a little. "You're ridiculous, you know that?" he asked, moving to lift up the right sleeve of his hospital gown. "I really did mean that I got tattoos, Sherlock. Damn the scars, I had those the first time, too." He pulled the light blue fabric back, revealing the seal of his company, merged with the seal of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. There was a lion on top, roaring and with it's claws extended, looking like it was pouncing at prey, and on the bottom was a golden eagle, swooping in for the kill. The outside of the seal was done in gold, and in interior in blue, with the names of both companies and the dates that he served. "And I did get my skin tags," he said quietly, rolling down the sleeve. "First day I arrived, that was the first place I went. They're on my left rib cage, but they're covered in a bruise now, so I can't really show you. I was going to get 'Property of Sherlock Holmes' tattooed underneath it, but I didn't figure that would go over too well," he joked.
"Can we, can we go home tomorrow?" Sherlock asked, his voice still hoarse with sleep and from crying.
"No, I'm stronger than I look," Sherlock gingerly sits on John's lap as John pushes the chair away from the table to make room. John hugs him tight, kissing at his arms and neck.
"Keep her into trouble. Monitor. Make sure she's not where Moriarty is, or anywhere near that side of town. I'm trusting you with the network to keep an eye on things." Sherlock cocks an eyebrow, "Quit smiling. You're not getting everything when I die."
They've run every eventuality - storming the house, pulling them out, shooting all the guards in the house.
John surprises himself. The tears drop down his face, just large drops down his face, breathing in deeply, but as slowly as he can. He married and loved the woman on the stretcher, under the sheet. Was going to have a family with her. That part was over a long time ago, those dreams, but now it's final. She's gone. The plan is completed.
"Mr. Holmes, I apologize for my son, he's, he's extremely bright and he can pick things apart which can be disconcerting. Is there arrangements we can make for someone to stay with you, or call in some other family members on your behalf--"
John put his forehead on Sherlock's,"Are you saying you don't want us to live with you? Is this too much?"
Sherlock did as he asked, his heart thrumming in anticipation. He loved holding John, loved his kisses on his skin, and he was hoping to convince him to stay. It was mid morning, sunlight streaming in the windows, but he was hopeful that a nap, with John laying beside him, would help set him right.
John carries his borrowed shoes as he walks out of the guest room; he's changed out of all his army fatigues. He folds them and leaves them at the end of the crisply remade bed.
"Sherlock," John huffed in-between kisses, "Sherlock, please….do you…" John took Sherlock's face between his hands, "I care for you, and about you, very, very much. I don't want this to be flippant, or to move too fast."
Sherlock slicks himself up, and they make love, crying, not even stripping, their pants barely to their knees. Sherlock plunges deeply into John, and John rocks against him, working on memorizing every nuance of Sherlock's groans, his hips, his neck, his lips. Sherlock comes quickly, spilling inside John and onto the bed. It takes John a few minutes later, as he's trying to breathe, to keep the great, large sobs from wreaking him. He's cried more these weeks than he's cried in years.
"Why doesn't he just tell me?" Hamish crossed his arms. He looked like a miniature John Watson, but his eyes were green.
He felt a bit panicked, working in the kitchen that was not his own but felt comfortable, wondering if their date was just a simple distraction. He'd felt a pull towards John, wanting to touch him and be touched as much as possible, but he was unsure if John had the same feelings. Or maybe doctors, or John, were simply more tactile.
"We are a mess," he huffed, covering John's erection in the lubricant. He moved his fingers and wrist in a circular motion, alternating with a light flutter against his balls. John grabbed Sherlock's arse, turning and rearranging one another so they each laid on their side.
John ran his fingers down Sherlock's neck, over the love bite. He lined up his cock over Sherlock's entrance, teasing him, his hot, dark red cock a contrast against Sherlock's alabaster skin. He rubbed the tip of his cock up and down and around, just barely dipping in and out of his entrance. Sherlock tried to push back, but John would hold him still with a palm on his neck or his upper back, forcing him just to take very small nudges of his cock.
"No, I just...I think I'm shaking because I'm finally not so scared," John pulled up close to Sherlock, kissing him, tracing one of Sherlock's cheekbone's with a fingertip, "I was afraid I'd never see your beautiful eyes again."
John was smiling. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see his parents looked slightly scandalized, but he didn't care. He reached forward and grabbed John by the back of the neck and kissed him, opening his mouth for a moment to taste him. Sherlock's heart ached with longing. As he pulled away from the kiss, everyone erupted into cheers and calls. John asked, "Are you ready to leave? I have the wagon packed."
As he watched the father and son make pancakes, Sherlock could see the back of John's neck and ears were red.
"I'm just going to tell you this, and then you need to ask me. Talk to me. Trust me. I'm your spy, Mycroft. My real title? My real jobs? That's not in my files. You can take that phrase, as being your spy, in a lot of different ways, and I mean them all. I report directly to Alex Younger. MI6. Almost your equal in every way. Almost," He winks before leaving the room, "But you are a bit more brilliant than I am."
Sherlock climaxed, wrapping his arms around John and burying his face into his neck. He shook, digging his fingers into John's hair, rubbing circles into his scalp. John turned, whispering into Sherlock's ear, "I am, my darling, I am. I love you."
John placed Sherlock in his chair, arranging him so he was balanced over the back. His knees were on the seat cushion, legs spread wide. John moved the plaid out of the way so he could look at his pink, rubbed hole. He dribbled anal lubricant right down his crack, and Sherlock shivered from the cold sensation. John leaned on his knees on the floor, resting his cheek on one globe of Sherlock's beautiful arse, himself as lazily fingered in and out of Sherlock's puckered hole. He watched the younger man desperately rut against the dangling fabric of his outfit that hung between himself and the chair back.
On his couch, Greg was sitting with his children, Emilie and Clara, and Hamish. Reading a story. He was acting out all the characters, and all three children were engrossed. Sherlock felt John inhale behind him.  He knew that if he looked at John, the psychosomatic injury would be manifested even stronger.
"Daddy is making a round check on other patients. All the other patients on the step down unit have friends or family here. This unit is for serious, life threatening injuries but with a good chance of recovery. You're here alone, and you're my daddy's age according to your chart, and it says 'S' which means you're single. Based on your age, you might not have parents that are alive-"
"Sherlock," John began, "I know you didn't want to get married, least of all, matched. You agreed to the match to save your family, and I love you for that. I will care for you and your family all of my days. I do not want you to feel that I am erasing you, or taking you away from your family. I want us each to wear these bracelets, with the Holmes tartan facing out, and the Watson tartan against our skin, to remind you that I love
John sucked in a breath. Sherlock bought him a gift. He bought him a gift, of clothing, and he was inviting John into Sherlock's
The incidents were so spaced out, and involved such various degrees of accidents and incidents, that Moriarty never expected a pattern to be found. Within a span of a few hours, Daemon and Sherlock found the link and a possible motive. Insurance payouts.
Hamish was quite put out when the grown ups were going to stay up past his bedtime, using the only child-like vernacular Sherlock had heard from Hamish thusfar. He was grumbling that "he couldn't wait until he was growed up so he could do what he wanted." When he was asleep, in the room just off the living room, and Sherlock was settled on the couch as comfortably as he could be, John brought him a small tumbler of scotch and some pain pills. Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
When the single bulb on the spindle of a lamp was set up, casting a yellow glow, he wandered through every bit of the theatre. He walked the fly loft, the house, the lobby, backstage, turning off lights as he went. As he walked to the large garage door that exited off the workshop, he could just peek through the curtains to see the lamp. He turned off the last light, shutting the garage door, locking the metal padlock.
Sherlock woke to Mrs. Hudson batting at his head with a blanket? Pillow? Towel? His eyes hurt and his head throbbed. His throat was scratchy.
John tried to give Sherlock his most dazzling smile, "Whatever you want, whatever makes you more comfortable. I'm going to go upstairs and start sorting through clothes and begin packing. Let me know what the plan is, yea?" Sherlock nodded, almost imperceptibly.
" 'Lock, you're working yourself up, breathe," Tavis tried to get Sherlock to sit back, but he rolled on his side, laying himself on the ground. He didn't open his eyes, as it made the dizziness worse. An ache grew, pounding his head right behind his eyes.
Hamish stood at the end of the bed, newspaper and notepad in hand, making notes. Sherlock wondered if the boy was making notes on his injury, "Mr. Detective, how long does it take a dead body to decompose?"
They melt into each other's arms, kissing and smiling. Robert strokes Mycroft's cheek, his ribs. They slowly strip one another, moving to lay down in front of the fire.
"Brother, dear. It is time to move you to 'hospital' to recover from your injuries and to move John back into 221b." John sits on the small lounge. His heart is pounding, staring up at Sherlock; looking between him and his brother. They are resolved, sad, and John will be embarrassed to admit it later; he's a little happy that Sherlock looks so lovesick at the prospect of he and John being apart.
Robert trips over his words, "Well, I mean...I told her. Dammit." He looks down a minute, then rests his forearms on the table to lean forward and look at Mycroft, "Yes, I wanted to, ask you out. She told me, not to, because you were seeing Graham-"
Everyone in the clan worked in shifts, some eating and resting while others worked. The Watson clan set up building in the same way, all young men and women helping to build the marriage gift to the
It took a while to believe the depth of Mary's deception and her motives; but rehearsing the plan with Mycroft soothed his nerves. It was as comfortable as marching orders in Afghanistan sand, as exhilarating as  running by Sherlock's side in the dead of night.
John grinned, following Sherlock into the restaurant. He noticed the people on the street who stopped to admire Sherlock, as he was an unusually handsome man. John walked close behind Sherlock so it was clear to everyone that they were together.
Sherlock shook his head. John gestured over to a corner with a pile of clothing, "Look at the tartan pattern. There is my Watson tartan lying on the clothing rack beside yours. In that dresser, if you open it, you'll find more of your family's tartan and the Lestrade tartan. The Lestrade clan aligned with yours when Gregory Lestrade married your brother. The rumor that came to my great uncle is that it was a love match." Sherlock raised up a bit, blinking. He didn't speak.
Before John could protest, Greg had grabbed his arm and dragged him to the front, easily visible to the interpreters. John was transfixed for a moment, watching them sign back and forth, curious about what they could be communicating. After a few minutes, the tall bloke turned over to look at them, then gestured to the female interpreter. The female interpreter came over, her face red.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand. They kissed Hamish goodbye, and took off for a cab. Sherlock felt his stomach rolling, both from nerves and from anticipation of being alone with John.
John popped his eyes open, "Sherlock?" he saw the brunette's head pop over his shoulder as he turned to look at John. John felt dizzy and unsure of what Sherlock wanted, but if Sherlock wanted to be held, John would oblige, "You want me to hold you?"
John looked at Sherlock, not answering, looking him over from his eyes, to his chest, his ears, and then he finally brought Sherlock's left hand to his mouth. He kissed Sherlock's knuckles sweetly, reverently, as he told him, "You are my delight. You make me laugh at how you see the world. I am not laughing at you. I am laughing because you wanted to be different than all the thousands of other Scotsmen named William. You made your own name."
They stood there for a few moments, just holding one another. John broke the silence, "This is going to hurt to matter how much I put this off. Goodnight!" He pecked Sherlock on the lips, then walked off quickly towards the tube station.
"Mycroft," Sherlock simply said, quickly and urgently pulling John's arm to regroup in Sherlock's bedroom.
Sherlock put his hand on John's cheek. Sherlock's fingers rubbed the red-tinted beard that covered his cheeks and jaw, "I remember you. You looked so skinny then, and sickly. You were clean-shaven then. You look so much better now."
He will use the bright moon and stars to guide his way towards the next town. He walks quickly as it's getting chilly now that the sun has nearly disappeared.
A Christmas dinner. Surprisingly, Mary agrees to attend, even though their communication has been short and nondescript. John isn't sure what Mary is up to; he knows that Mycroft, Sherlock, and in some ways, Moriarty, are pulling on her spiderweb.
John would say these vows to Sherlock, whether or not there would be time made for personal vows, or whether or not Sherlock would listen. He had to tell him. Whatever else happen, would happen.
Lord Watson stepped in between his Da and Sherlock, with his horse still behind him. Though John was shorter than both Sherlock and his father, he was muscular, his chest thick, and he puffed it out, his head held high.
"Yes," Sherlock smiled, raising his voice a bit, "I am especially rude and impatient to the local police force at times. Exceptionally. When they deserve it. I'm so hard to get along with, one of my only friends is Billy, my skull."
He sat up quickly and was caught with a wave of dizziness, and a pounding behind his eyes, that forced him to lay back down.
Sherlock deduced the affair, and couldn't keep quiet. The therapist, to try and discredit Sherlock, had fought back with a Sociopath diagnosis. Even after large fights, screaming matches, and the family coming back together, the diagnosis stuck. Even after other psychological tests were done that showed the therapist was wrong, Sherlock used it has his shield and armor to keep others away.
Today, Sherlock said only John's name. But the tone, the inflection, was altogether different. John was in the kitchen, cooking breakfast, when he heard Sherlock call his name from the living room. Sherlock had been typing on his laptop, in fits and starts, when he'd finally given up. He'd been pacing the living room, took down a book, put it back.
They ran through the secret wall between platform nine and ten to get to 9 and 3/4. The Hogwarts Express hooted, minutes away from pulling away from the station.
Mycroft returned the grin with a small curve of his lips. "Yes. Too much leg work. I shall leave the glory to the more capable."
“Off where? Oh, forget it. I better get back before somebody finds me out of bed and I’ll have to explain myself.” John bit through his bottom lip, eyes on the floor. He looked embarrassed.
She waited before he turned around to face her before she spoke. "I'm not going to pretend to even remotely understand your world but me and your dad, we're both so proud of you. And Harry is too."
"Not for every mundane activity. And keep your voice down." Mycroft hissed. “At least think about tutoring.”
It was a boy - not Mycroft - still in his pyjamas. He had his back to him and made no indication of having realised Sherlock had knocked into him.
“Have a pleasant journey. And be sure to change into your uniforms soon.” Mycroft said and left quickly.
“I’m sure he wouldn’t have minded.” Greg said. “He looked happy enough with his book if I’m honest.”
"If you aren't going to let me in then leave me alone." Sherlock waved his hands in the air, his wand still in hand.
John jogged down the stairs to the kitchen where his mum was sweeping away the remnants of a broken mug.
Sherlock sighed over dramatically. "I have already read it, reading it again won't change what it says. I don't see why you're so excited, mummy, I still have two more useless years of education. I did my OWLs early, surely they should let me do my NEWTs this year."
The moonlight strew through the tinted glass, casting a soft green filter onto Jim's features. Seb had to gulp again. Damn it. He wasn't supposed to be doing this, but here he was, a hair away from getting up and-
He whipped around, and saw Mycroft stood with a barely concealed look of amusement plastered on his face.
"Good for him. Must be smart, done his OWLs early. His brother is smart, anyway. Tutors in everything, apparently."
"Anyone who intends to behave in a manner similar to that can leave this instance." Snape added for good measure.
"Jesus, he has more balls than I thought. I've heard he's quite the wild card, difficult to put up with."
"I knew you'd complain." Jim said, smiling. The smile faded quickly. "It's so boring here. I can't wait to get out. Another two years of this drivel and I might just point my wand at my own head and curse myself."
Seb turned the apple over his hand and didn't speak. He realised a long time ago it would be better if he didn't speak when Jim was about to go off on a monologue.
“You’re the one making all the noise, you twat.” John whispered, making Sherlock grin. “What the Hell am I even doing here? Where are we going, Sherlock?”
"Time-turners can't be applied for, Sherlock. They are presented by the House leaders. As was mine, four years ago." Mycroft returned to his newspaper. "Clearly you haven't been deemed responsible enough."
Harry grinned a mixture of baby and adult teeth. She always had been behind in development: slow to walk, talk and teethe. She pushed back a rogue lock of blonde fringe. "Obviously, I can't tell you, dad."
Everything was brand new to him, he was a kid learning about the world all over again in a new light. It was fantastic. His parents would be lying if they said they didn’t see a difference in him after the first year, coming home talking about how he transfigured a toad into a teapot, eyes brimming with an excitement they had never seen in him before.
Greg looked over. He didn’t know her, but being the Captain of the team, he was used to people knowing him. Especially the girls. His team always teased him about having his own little fan club.
There was a stunned silence. John turned back around, he had to look at this ballsy idiot one more time before he got mutilated by Snape after that comment. Typical arrogant Ravenclaw. He saw Jim practically gleaming at him now, and it made him uneasy.
Mycroft sighed. "You're taking more than three extra books for your studies, and it's the first day back of term. You're only taking them for three of your subjects, so it's ones to struggle in. You aren't performing well in them then, and are attempting to improve your grades."
The entire school body had gathered in the Great Hall for the Sorting. He watched with mild curiosity as the first years were one by one brought to the front, the Sorting Hat placed on their heads, and organised into their houses. He watched with closer curiousity at the ones put into Ravenclaw. They seemed burly enough, though some looked like they lacked some spine. Others looked far too rigid, like they had too much spine. But people always said that about him, didn’t they?
Mycroft unsheathed his wand - applewood, dragon heartstring core, 10 and a half inches - and waved it with a swish and a flick, muttering "Wingardium Leviosa." under his breath. The books levitated to the highest shelf that Mycroft couldn't reach and returned themselves.
"I put it away for you, you left her out." Seb tossed the apple to the side after he was done carving a mess out of it.
"Doesn't mean I don't want one." Sebastian grinned, plonking himself on the leather sofa opposite Jim by the fire.
Sherlock lifted a hand to run his fingers through his dark curls. Tedious. Less than three days of being here and things were already tedious.
John's toad - Boswell - A famous quote from Doyle's novels 'A Scandal in Bohemia' is Holmes saying "I am lost without my Boswell", referring to Watson. Boswell was a Scottish biographer who famously wrote the biography of his best friend, called 'Life of Samuel Johnson'.
Mycroft raised a brow, took a bowl of cress, and poured it into his plate. He stabbed at it with a fork and chewed it, mirroring Sherlock’s expression.
Mycroft - Applewood (known for the unusual ability to converse with other magical beings in their native languages, the owner usually has great personal charm. I instantly had to give Mycroft this wand wood, since he is knowledgeable in so many languages and could quite literally charm the pants of anyone).
There was a small chance that maybe he wouldn't be so alone, so isolated from his own fucking family, and that had just be snatched away with an exhale from Harry's lungs, dissapating with the flame.
Sherlock blushed, trying to figure out what the boy was getting at. Sherlock thought about it, remembering John's stern warning about pain. "No, it hadn't really hurt, just been a little uncomfortable."
Molly and Sherlock looked at him, Molly's eyebrow tweaked and Sherlock's face completely unreadable. John stood there, wondering how he had managed to come across as an inconsiderate arsehole to two strangers within the span of one presentation. The three of them didn't say a word. They just stared, and John felt his face heat up, but he held his ground. When the next speaker began to test the microphone, the two interpreters left him standing alone by the coffee.
Sherlock grabs him, hugs him tightly, kissed him; using his tongue and teeth. His face was wet and slippery, John pulls back, leaning against the wall. Sherlock looks so much younger than his years.
It had been two weeks since the wedding. Sherlock was coping to the best of his ability without using drugs. He knew John would be upset if he started using again. It was a struggle to keep himself clean as all he wanted to do was escape this never-ending pain. But he managed and every day was on and off crying. Sometimes he never left his bed.
John took a deep breath before speaking. "Sherlock, I just- I was scared, about the possibility of being openly gay with you, I want to, don't doubt that fact, but after yesterday in the cab I was unsure and needed something familiar. This is all uncharted territory for me, Sherlock, it's a lot to process." Sherlock nodded before shooting another question at John.
