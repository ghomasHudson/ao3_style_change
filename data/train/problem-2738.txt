They sit there in silence for a moment before Dean moves to the other side of the table to finish his own food, and Cas heads for the shower to wash off the cemetery grime.
“How do you know? You don’t know the difference. I don’t think I ever really got used to it the first time.”
happy before coming for me. I didn’t tell you and I asked Jack not to tell you. I know your and Sam’s history with...deals. It didn’t seem like an imminent threat at the time.” He raises one eyebrow, sardonic and self-deprecating. “It still doesn’t. And if Chuck gets his way, we may not live long enough for it to matter, but you deserve to know. It’s not fair for you not to know.”
it, and that’s...that’s good. Whatever honesty he owes them or Cas, if he had to choke out the words
Hunters are a gossipy lot. He knows the broad strokes of what everyone says about him and Cas. He’s known for years. People have said enough of it to his face. But he wonders, not for the first time, exactly how that plays out in the wider Winchester mythology. What do they say about him, in between talking about God and Lucifer and walking through worlds?
He follows it as well he can, but it’s faint, like static stuttering in and out. He tells himself that’s just because his grace is weaker, not because Dean is.
are gone, and he’s been trying to figure out what to do with himself. He’s relieved and free and completely directionless and a little bit baffled that Sam can just...go on.
“Haven’t we all,” Cas says, one eyebrow cocked, and there’s an opening, if Dean is willing to take it.
Dean thinks angels have a limited emotional range, but that’s not exactly true. They feel things strongly - grief, fear, righteous anger. Love. But they do feel them differently -  distantly, and on a larger scale. In Heaven, there’s a cause or a mission or a charge. An angel might love humanity in the abstract, or grieve the necessity of a war, or be angry at the demon rampage over Earth or the corruption of Heaven. It’s not supposed to be
Dean fiddles with Cas’ phone. “We all missed it. And maybe we shouldn’t have been thinking more outside the box, but we all expected it to go after me next. We all thought it was Alexis. How could you have known?”
Castiel looks away. Dean's right. It is unfair. But the harm is that Dean won’t believe there’s another way, and Castiel doesn’t want to fight.
Dean doesn’t remember anything about a haunting in Virginia, but it may not have been one that originated with Sam. Eileen’s been working as much as she can, trying to keep busy.
Dean texts Sam and tells him not to follow. He grabs the Purgatory blade off the hook on his bedroom wall and almost staggers under the muscle memory of its weight in his hand.
“Let me finish. Just let me get this out. I know I’ve been a mess through this whole Chuck. I know I doubted everything, but you, and us and this? It’s always been real. I know that. Every time I’ve lost you, and I have lost you so many times, it’s like everything just goes dark.  I don’t know how to keep moving without you with me. I was going to try this time. I was going to try to be what you see in me. But don’t you get that everything is better when you’re here? When I asked you in the Empty to stay, I meant I thought I lost you again. I meant
“How is he doing?” Dean asks, to break the silence. Only Cas has really had any time alone with Jack since everything went down.
Dean can’t sleep and goes to the kitchen, where he finds Sam and Eileen, kissing against the counter, warm and intimate. He backs out of the room before they can notice him.
They lie there for a moment in the silence, and then Dean says, “I meant it. So there’s never any confusion, I need you to hear me - I want you here.”
“I know. It was logical. How could we have known the siren wouldn’t find it worthwhile to go after you?”
Dean knocks on the door and there’s a clattering from inside the house. He has his badge up, ready to go, but his normal spiel dies on his lips when he comes face-to-face with Jesse Cuevas.
“And you think we would let him.” Dean says, slowly, his face closing off as the pieces click into place.
He doesn’t sleep.  He should have known better than to try.  He also doesn’t leave his room until around noon, and when he does, Cas is nowhere to be found, which means he doesn’t really want to be found, but they’re in a good place, last night notwithstanding. Cas would tell him if he was taking off.
Dean took a deep breath. There were moments like this sometimes, the two of them alone in the dark, in the quiet of the bunker when time seemed to stretch and catch, tension between them drawn taut.
“I feel fine,” he says over dinner one night, rolling his shoulder as if to demonstrate the full range of movement. “We can move on.”
One day in late April he finds Sam and Eileen at the map table, bent over Sam’s laptop and signing rapidly to each other. It’s way too fast for Dean, and he feels a little bit like a shit brother-in-law for not having picked up more by now, but he catches a few things -
“You’re buying,” she says, “don’t wait up, boys.” She pauses, and turns back to them, narrowing her eyes. “And maybe -
“No.” Cas cut him off abruptly, looking up with something desperate in his eyes. “No,” he said again, more gently, squeezing Dean’s hand back when Dean made a move to pull away. “Whatever you’re going to say, tell me tomorrow.”
(Billie had said, “it’s your funeral,” with a nonchalant shrug and disappeared with a crack to the air. Dean was pretty sure she didn’t used to have sound effects, but she’d gotten increasingly dramatic over the years.)
Also, Dean has no idea how to answer that loaded question. He sighs, pushing his plate away from him. He thinks about Cassie and Lee and Lisa and Cas; how they were all so uniquely complicated. “It’s exciting in the beginning; something just clicks into place with a person and you know they’re important. But then it’s about someone knowing you - like,
Rowena and Jack go to the fancy bakery to get a celebratory cake while the rest of them are at the courthouse, and Jody and Donna bring the girls down that night. Cas manages to limp into the kitchen to participate and complain that the fondant flowers taste like rubbery disappointment.
“Dean,” he says, low and soft, and moves over to the bedside, hesitantly laying one hand on Dean’s forearm. When Dean can see him better, in the lamp light, he looks even worse than Sam did, pale and washed out.
; he really hasn’t sacrificed anything he feels like he’ll miss. Dean cuts him off, though, one hand shooting out to wrap around Castiel’s forearm and squeeze.
Dean’s grown used to hunting with Cas over the years, to the point where they have their own shorthand, and it’s almost as seamless and instinctive as hunting with Sam. He didn’t quite account for how Cas’s new humanity would change their approach, though. Dean chalks some of it up to being a little gun shy after the hodag incident, but it becomes apparent that Cas is cautious in a way he never was before. He’s not hesitant, never seems afraid, but he’s thorough and precise in his planning, quick to pull Dean back if he feels like they don’t have enough information, more inclined to call for backup when things get weird, even if Dean’s confident they can handle it.
They make sure no one with blood on their hands touches George Anderson’s body before it’s cremated, and they send the kid with Stevie back to the bunker and Rowena, when he seems willing to go.
Sam still doesn’t look happy. Eileen puts her hand on his forearm. “Things are quiet here,” she says. “Why don’t you go too? Might be a good break.” They share a Look. Dean hates being fucking
Dean huffs a laugh and takes a sip of his beer. “Believe me. It is far from the weirdest part of the story.”
They’ve got their hands on him, holding him back and pushing him to his knees. Years of mistakes come rushing back. The apocalypse. Heaven. Leviathan the first time. Naomi. Jack.
Cas looks up at Dean sharply. “I don’t...think I can really tell Jack how to be human when I haven’t figured it out myself. If he wants to hunt, he will. I’d rather he was trained and with people we trust, wouldn’t you?”
the life. I married a hunter. I’m not gonna go stalking Djinn for fun or anything, but there’s good to be done. We can take what the Men of Letters were trying to do, and make it better, more nuanced. I mean, we have friends who are werewolves. My therapist is a shapeshifter. One of my best friends is a witch. Saving people, hunting things, the way we were raised...it’s not black and white. We know things other people don’t know, and...we really have something to contribute here.”  He sits back in his chair and says, more gently, “You know, this doesn’t mean you have to do anything, right? You have a choice too.”
It comes out in a rush. They stare at each other for a moment, and Castiel can’t hear anything now over the rushing in his ears. Then Dean draws another shuddery breath.  He’s still looking Castiel right in the eye, pinning him here in this chair in the dark of the library.  Dean says, “I love you.  Of
The harm, of course, is that Castiel is a hypocrite.  He’s the one who taught Jack how much it’s acceptable to sacrifice for your family, after all, and Jack’s not above calling him on it. Not out of spite, but because he doesn’t know why he should keep Castiel’s secret if Castiel won’t keep his. Jack won't understand that parents sacrifice for their children, and it’s not supposed to work the other way around.
He masters navigating the kitchen on crutches, and throws himself into making dinner for whoever is in the bunker that day. Jack, Sam, Eileen, Cas, Dean, Rowena, and, apparently, Shawn actually live there, but there are usually at least four or five others passing through. Krissy swings by, and Other Charlie, who it still hurts a little to look at, and sometimes people he doesn’t even know, but he smiles and makes pancakes.
They haven’t run into werewolves or vampires or Djinn, and Castiel wonders if Dean’s reputation from the last time he was here lingers.
By eight or nine months in, at night, in the pitch dark, he was pretty sure Cas was dead. He never said it to Benny, since he couldn’t leave without knowing for sure. He wouldn’t think it to himself during the day, because that’s not how you keep moving. He didn’t even really think it at night, but the prayers became confessional and more personal, a way of keeping track of himself in the endless rhythm of Purgatory. He kept talking to Cas because it was the only way to hold on to hope until the sun rose again.
It takes a full clip to take it down, and by then it’s got its teeth sunk deep into the meat of Cas’s shoulder. Dean pulls off his flannel for a makeshift tourniquet to stop the bleeding, but it soaks through quickly.
Dean dreams of fire, of darkness at the bottom of the ocean, of Mary’s eyes, of the imprint of wings burned across the dirt, and wakes up shaking.
“But...how? The Empty can’t come to Earth.” And Sam is confused now, and still heartbroken, and there’s so much more. Dean doesn’t think he can get through this.
“I know,” Dean lies. He knows damn well from personal experience that you absolutely mean what you say on siren venom. It’s missing context and nuance. You don’t mean it quite the way it comes out, harsh and angry, words like barbs wielded to wound, but all those feelings the siren dredges up are pulled from an honest place of vulnerability and pain. So Jack standing there with that knife, full of human anger, as though using his angel powers didn’t even occur to him, saying, “I’ll never forgive you” and “I have to do this because I’ll be safe with her” and “this is the only way I’ll ever be safe” -  that came from feelings that were real.
“What?” Dean asks, amusement and relief in his tone, dropping his eyes in something like embarrassment as Castiel drinks him in. Castiel just shakes his head and leans in to kiss him again.
Dean laughs a little at that realization and takes another swig of his beer. “Well, anything he told you is almost definitely true.”
Dean knows why they’ve fallen into this configuration, with Cas always at Jack’s side. It’s been like that since Jack got back to the bunker, even before this misadventure. Dean gets it - Cas is fiercely protective of people he loves and everything with Jack still feels impossible and precarious. It feels petty, but part of Dean always wants Cas on his side of the table, and they had just been getting back to normal.
When Dean wakes up the next time he’s not sure how much time has passed, but it’s dark outside the window and now he can feel the ache in his side and leg. Sam is gone, but Cas is there, clutching a cardboard coffee cup and staring out the window. He turns with a start when Dean lets out a low groan.
He is happy, of course. But Dean keeps shooting him these glances, heavy with guilt and sadness, despite the way he stuck by Castiel’s side, kept his hands on Castiel’s shoulder, his back, his elbow, like if they stopped touching for an instant, Castiel would disappear. Castiel understands that uncertainty, after everything; he knows that Dean needed that reassurance of his family together and whole. It still made him feel exposed, Dean’s hands on him like pressure on a raw nerve, Dean’s eyes stripping him bare.
but he means it, all the same. If they survive Chuck, there’s no way in hell he’s letting things end that way.
? You’ve always had me, Cas.  You gave up Heaven for me, you rebelled for me, and I’ve never deserved any of it, so I thought we just didn’t talk about it. You are everything I want, and everything I thought I couldn’t have.”
“That’s pretty much what happened. But the entity wasn’t happy about it. Not then, and not later.” Cas sighs, looking down at the table where their hands are joined. “Then, when Jack died, the first time, and I went to find him in Heaven, there was a fight. Jack was part angel and part human. Both Heaven and the Empty wanted him, and the entity invaded Heaven. It killed a bunch of angels before it caught up with us. It had a claim on him, and it would have taken him.”
Dean chuckles, looking down at his whiskey and swirling it in the glass. “You can hear what I’m thinking?” He’s never been sure where exactly that line is or how much intention on his part it takes for Cas to hear him. That would make this easier, he supposes.
They get through about two days of business as usual. That is, they get through two days of finding bupkis, before Dean declares that if Sam and Jack get a break, so do they.
Cesar and Cas both head to bed around midnight, and Dean stays up with Jesse for just one more. It’s partly because he’s enjoying the night and the quiet camaraderie, but also partly because going to bed with Cas, at the same time, in the same bed, after a warm night with friends takes on a different kind of scary intimacy than exhausted nights in motels after the hunt.
Cas shrugs. “But it seems like a lot of work for someone you’ll never see again. I don’t really understand the appeal of having that kind of intimacy be so fleeting, when you don’t know the other person and can’t really tell them anything real. I was curious. When I was an angel, I didn’t really understand what you get out of that type of liaison, though you seem to enjoy it. I thought maybe I would feel differently now.”
He takes another swig from his glass and watches the light from the lamp flicker in the frosted tumbler. So he is not unhappy and he is human and he is free - of Heaven and the Empty.  All of that is true. He is also lost and wary of the future. Humanity was a mixed bag the first time around.
“Retired doesn’t mean out of the loop. We’re still mostly in touch with the Mexico hunter community, but New Mexico has some weird shit and people pass through. There have been quite the rumors about the Winchesters over the last few years. Is all that true?”
knowing you, not getting in your head and fucking around in your memories and trying to be what you want. It’s them really seeing you, and wanting to be with you anyway. And you see them for who they are and want to be with them anyway. You’re safe with them, and you trust them to be there for you, you want to be there for them.”
Castiel has always been a flawed angel in that regard, and over the years, he's come to understand human emotions more directly. That's been an asset in helping him understand humanity (in general), his friends (specifically), and Dean Winchester (in particular).
Sam was actually pretty put out by the fact that hodags are apparently hunter common knowledge and something else they missed by not having regular access to the wider hunter community, despite Men of Letters lore and John’s meticulous records. It was kind of funny. When Dean suggested sending someone to investigate Mothman, Sam huffed
. Jack mumbles something and heads for the bathroom, so Dean and Cas are left sitting across from each other in the booth, not really making eye contact.
“For what?” Dean asks, cautiously, and Jack looks at him, a little disbelieving. Dean’s pretty sure he learned that expression from Cas.
Cas sleeps in the next morning, and when he stumbles into the kitchen after Sam leaves on his run, Dean is waiting.
; it still sets him on edge that he feels like he doesn’t totally understand the extent of that. “I don’t think it would have changed anything.”
Cas doesn’t look particularly comforted by Dean’s words. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, and then reaches for Dean’s hand. Dean’s anxiety kicks up another notch because as much as he does feel like Purgatory cracked some kind of wall between them, their history of physical contact is still mostly limited to someone dying or returning from the dead. He lets Cas wrap their fingers together and squeeze.
The silence of the bunker in the early morning hours is a silence Castiel knows well. He has spent so much time here, like this, with only the hum of the generator for company while his family sleeps.
Dean just shakes his head. “I can’t, Sammy,” he says, with only the slightest hitch to the words, and he’s fine, he’s
The Empty sleeps. There is no devil now, there is only Hell’s benevolent Queen. There is no God now, there is only Michael, against all odds softened by the Pit and transmuted through loving just one human man.
They spend a few unpleasant nights running around the woods in the dark before they find it, if by “find it” you mean, “get attacked out of nowhere.”
Dean’s presence behind him before he sees him.  It’s strange, he always thought that ability was an artifact of his angelic senses. Of course, Dean is there now. Castiel isn’t ready yet.
want to go back to the bunker. If we go back, will you stay there?” Dean hesitates and Cas takes his hesitation for what it is.
Castiel looks down at Dean’s hand, clutching at the material of his trench coat, and then up at Dean’s face, desperate and open, and gives in to that desire to touch. He reaches out with his other hand to grab Dean’s other arm and reels him in until he can slide his hand up Dean’s shoulder and around the back of his neck, pulling him into a hug.  Dean stiffens for a moment in Castiel’s arms, and then relaxes, letting go of his grip on the trench coat and sliding his arm around Castiel’s waist.
It’s unnatural, cosmically wrong for angels to be in Purgatory. He felt it before and he feels it now, like a film on his skin, the way this place wants to expel them both. Dean had been so sure the portal would work for both of them back then, and of course he’d been right. It had just seemed unnecessarily cruel for Castiel to ever confirm that when it hadn’t mattered, after.
Jack moves around him, following his instructions. When he’s got everything combined, Dean hands him the bowl with the dry ingredients and a fork, showing him how to whisk it all together. They work mostly in silence.  Dean turns toward the griddle when it’s hot enough.
or they would have found it already, but he owes Cas that much. He owes Cas, everything, really. Everything in his life that is 100 percent
Cas nods and Dr. Fischer’s face shutters a little. “Good,” she says, then shakes it off, back to business.
Dean lies awake that night listening to Cas’s breathing from the other bed, debating what’s better for him and for Cas. Do they go back? Selfishly, he wants to keep moving. The rock of a mattress notwithstanding, he’s slept better these last few nights than he has at the bunker lately, which is a little strange. He usually sleeps better at the bunker than anywhere. He’s gotten used to a routine and a familiar space, somewhere where he doesn’t have to sleep with a knife under the bed or the gun under the pillow, somewhere he can fall asleep without facing the door.
“I’m here to help,” Cas says. “I’ll see this through.” He squeezes Dean’s shoulder again, and then he’s gone.
Sam sighs before he grudgingly sends them the info. “Dean, come back for a while. Or just take a break. You guys need it.”
And now here they are, staring down a rift to Purgatory. He’s not sure he can stomach going back there alone. He’s pretty sure he
“Thank you,” Castiel says, "I'll let you know as soon as I find anything." He moves to turn away when Dean leans forward to grab his forearm, pulling him back around.
Dean steps back from carving another X into a tree. “I wish we had Benny,” he says. Castiel does too, actually. Benny had been difficult, and his camaraderie with Dean had left Castiel on edge with something he hadn’t understood at the time and now recognizes as jealousy, but he’d had an innate sense of direction in this place, born either of time or of actually belonging here.
Dean pulls away first, with a reluctant squeeze to Castiel’s shoulder. “Go, if you have to,” he says, voice thick. “I’ll stall until I hear from you.”
It’s a powerful pull. And he’d been into Nick even before he got the venom in him. Nick had given him an out with the whole brother angle, probably to keep him from fighting it too hard because his repression ran a lot deeper back then, but desire of all kinds had been part of it. “But I thought I did, or at least that I could. It’s not real, though. It’s like being hypnotized, brainwashed, and some part of you knows it even while it’s happening. You felt the shift, right?  How quickly everything changes?”
Dean closed his eyes against the guilt, like a raised scar he could run his fingers across, and wished that wasn’t Cas’s takeaway.
They have quite a few beers, and several helpings of Cesar’s enchiladas as the sun starts to sink over the horizon, stripping the sky in gold and orange. Turns out Jesse and Cesar have been running something of a hunter roadside hostel - not hunting themselves, but gathering and passing on information, leaving the lights on for anyone passing through. Apparently they met Bobby briefly a few years ago.
“I can heal that,” Cas says. He nods to indicate Dean’s temple, and Dean reaches up, prodding just below his hairline where it’s still tender, a low ache that’s in the early stages of building to a migraine.
He stops by Dean’s room after to check on him. He’s not surprised to find Dean still awake and staring at his laptop. Castiel hovers in the doorway, and Dean looks up, turning to push the computer aside. He flinches with the movement where it pulls at whatever damage still lingers, and Castiel tamps down the guilt over not being enough this time.
It probably won’t, and it's not worth Cas' strength, but Dean is guiltily grateful for it anyway, as much or more for the weight of Cas' hand on him as for the way the pain in his head clears.
before this, he’d have lashed out, angry at Jack too, for this loss, for the deal, but Cas made his choices, and Dean was the one who…
Smiting sickness is a bitch, but a few weeks in it became apparent that Cas was going to pull through and the suffocating pressure in Dean’s chest unclenched a little. Cas is alive; Rowena and Jack are alive - in Rowena’s case, arguably an improvement, though she can’t as much as levitate a feather anymore. Adam fucked off with a powerless Michael somehow still living in his head, but left a phone number and a forwarding address; there’s an open door there, which is more than Dean ever would have expected and more than they deserve.
Dean is way too in his head for that to work, though, and at about hour two, he turns the music up loud enough to cut out all casual conversation and let the Rolling Stones carry them through. At hour four, he can’t take the pressure-cooker vibe of the car anymore and makes the executive decision to stop for lunch.
used to it. Needing to manage things like appropriate amounts of sleep and the effects of low blood sugar apparently did require a learning curve, but it set off a twinge of guilt all the same. He’d never really forgiven himself for the first time.
“No,” Dean says, bitterness coloring his voice. “I’m not even surprised that’s the catch, though I’m a little surprised it hadn’t occurred to us. Now that you’ve said it, of course.  Of fucking course. Why would this go any other way? Cosmic beings and their cosmic agendas. Fuck.”
So they don’t go back to the bunker. Sam is Displeased about this decision, but he sends them another file, and another after that, mostly keeping them to hauntings that are simple and straightforward, one of which ends up being a hoax. Sam swears he didn’t know and that it was worth checking out. Dean magnanimously doesn’t point out that that’s also what Sam said about hodags.
Dean does, depositing Cas in the back seat and breaking a bunch of traffic laws to get back to the motel. He’s tempted to go to the hospital then, but his hunter instincts override the frantic impulse. They look a mess, and hospitals are too many questions, even if this is Cas’s first major human injury, and he’s looking woozy in the streetlights, getting blood all over the back seat of the Impala.
Dean flinches, and Cas eyes him cautiously. The Empty Deal is the other thing they don’t talk about. Cas knows he knows, but it’s never felt like a good time to really bring it up. It hadn’t ended up mattering in the end, so Dean hasn’t known quite how to explain the way it eats at him, the knowledge of the narrowly averted crisis festering under his skin. It makes him wonder what else he doesn’t know, and whether he’ll have any warning the next time the rug gets ripped out from under him.
When Dean and Jody find them, they’re wasted and pouring through journals trying to identify the symbols on an old wooden box Dean wouldn’t open for all the booze or money in the world.
After being human, even briefly, he’d thought he’d understood thoroughly, but with waning grace, everything is sharper. And beyond his fear for the future and overwhelming, unwavering grief for Jack, there’s a bitterness he can’t shake. The way he’s felt since everything tumbled out of control is how he felt when he
to be open and give the benefit of the doubt, how determined Dean is to stop with the secrets between them. The aching irony of how this unnamed
Dean turns to survey the scene again and gets it suddenly. He thinks of Cas, shaking and wan, eyes bleeding after Rowena’s attack dog spell, and says, “Fuck. We should look for a hex bag.”
and it’s enough. Nothing about that has changed, Dean has always been enough. Castiel hardly gave up
, he’s going to lose it again, but that’s going to happen anyway, and maybe he owes them too - the truth, or some approximation of it.  They were Cas’ family too.
“Okay,” he says again. “It’s fine, Cas.  It just surprised me too; we just weren’t expecting it to go after you like that. At least we learned some valuable intel about siren venom.”
George Anderson dies in police custody that night. They have the station staked out, but he’s attacked by a police officer, so solitary confinement and the cameras didn’t help. They’d gone in as FBI, so they’re on the scene within minutes and it's the first time they’ve seen the immediate aftermath.
They both start using Kennedy, Eileen’s mother’s maiden name, and that’s weird to get used to, but why shouldn’t they? Maybe the Winchester family curse breaks if Dean’s the end of line.
but then, look at where that got all of them, and there’s nothing there anyway. It’s like something has been extinguished in his chest. There’s that roaring in his ears again, like white noise threatening to drown out the conversation. Dean drops his eyes.
“I know. And if we make it through all of this we’re gonna figure that out.” Dean says it like a promise, and maybe that is as close as they can get to anything right now, with Dean still on a razor edge of uncertainty about everything in his life. “You should sleep too, right?” When Castiel nods hesitantly, Dean says, “Turn out the light, shut the door, and come here.”
And if it also means that Heaven and Hell are sealed now, that the whole universe is “closed to the divine” (according to Donatello) and that every demon was spontaneously exorcised (good) and every angel left on Earth had their grace burned out of them from the inside (not good), well. No one told them that part, but cosmic consequences. Is there any other kind?
“No,” Dean says, and he doesn’t correct the pronouns, but he’s thinking about Nick. Dean had been so fragile at the time, and Nick had been an offer of everything he wanted.
fine. Dean knows that too. This kind of thing is just part of the hunter life. Cas’s humanity may throw a new wrinkle in the mix, but they’ll both get used to that too. Even Rebecca (who has deigned to let them call her Rebecca) says everything is fine; there’s no damage to the joint, and Cas can go back to “whatever stupidity you all get up to” as soon as the antibiotics run their course.
Dean lets out a wet laugh. “Yeah, no shit. Trust me, I get that now. Me either, and we’re both stupid. Come here.”  He tugs Castiel to his feet and back into his arms.  It’s not quite the desperation from their reunion in the Empty, but there’s something in it that’s fierce and possessive. This close Castiel can feel that Dean’s shaking a little too, a trembling that eases when Castiel runs his hand along the line of Dean’s spine.
There’s something familiar about it up close, though. Dean’s easing over toward the latest perpetrator/next victim, when Cas grabs his arm and yanks him back, hissing in his ear, “Don’t touch him.” Cas turns and says to the room at large, “Nobody touch him.”
Cas is back in the exam room for about 45 minutes, before a nurse comes out and makes a beeline for Dean.
“But I remembered a lot.” Cas glances up at Dean. “Too much for a human mind to hold, it seems. It’s strange what’s right on the edges.” He reaches one hand to rub at his temple and then drops it next to him on the car near where Dean’s hand is resting.  Their fingers brush lightly.
“For what now?” Dean asks, voice muffled where he has his head tipped against Castiel’s shoulder, sounding mildly put out in a way that makes Castiel tighten his arms around him.
“I’m sorry for what I said, too. With the siren,” Jack says, his voice getting stronger as he goes. “I didn’t mean it. I don’t believe you want to hurt me.”
And if they make it through, Dean will do next thing - whatever that is. Keep breathing. Love the people he’s got left, with whatever pieces of himself he can patch back together. He owes Cas that much.
Dean’s at the bar with Cas and Rowena. Rowena’s three drinks in and predatory with it, making eyes at some hot asshole in a cowboy hat at the bar. Cas is matching Dean drink-for-drink and lilting a little against Dean’s shoulder, warm and sweaty where they’re pressed together.
Everything was so deceptively simple here the first time, back when he still thought penance was the same thing as atonement or forgiveness. In hindsight, it was a typically angelic failure to grasp nuance.
“You took care of it, Jesse said,” Dean says with a grin, still taking in the house. He intentionally hadn’t gotten contact information from them the last time, not wanting to drag them into the mess with Amara, and he’d kind of figured he’d never see them again. There’s something soothing about seeing even just the edges of the life they’d built for themselves. “I thought you all were retired.”
Of course he’s fine, but it also hurts like a motherfucker. It’s the kind of thing that’s happened to him probably hundreds of times, and it’s an injury he’d have shaken off at twenty, but that now he’s going to feel for weeks.
“I just mean…” Dean cuts himself off, because he’s not sure what he means. Explicitly, no, they didn’t. But they
He’s hovering. He knows it. He knows Cas is annoyed, mostly because Cas makes no secret of it, waving him off with an “I’m
“This is an afterlife, Dean. They don’t die unless someone kills them, and they’re the alpha predator here.”
But Cas just looks back at him and shrugs, wincing when the movement pulls at the makeshift stitches.
“Damn it, Cas, then what’s the harm in telling us?” Dean says. “You think I don’t want another way? You think we wouldn’t want to help? You can't just leave without a word.  You can't just say 'if I don't make it back' and then...” he cuts himself off abruptly and looks down.
“Hey, kiddo,” he says, when he sees Jack standing behind him, hesitantly watching him sift the flour. “Want to help?”
He slows a little bit, softening the dizzying rush because Dean at this point pretty clearly isn’t going to do it. He pulls back, easing it with softer kisses, a brush of lips like a promise. “I love you,” he whispers again, and again between kisses, until they’re standing still again, wrapped in each other’s arms, Castiel’s forehead pressed against Dean’s temple, just breathing each other in.
It looks pretty much as described - a victim that looks like he had his eyes burned (fine, no demons, but goddamn), a perpetrator huddling in the corner and shaking, lashing out at anyone who comes near, looking pale and drawn, and bleeding from the eyes.
Cas seems pensive, rubbing one hand up and down Dean’s arm, soothing. It’s a long moment before he says, quietly,  “I promise you, as long as I have a choice, that’s what I want too.”
And he knows the fear Sam and Cas are feeling, of course he does. He’s been on the other side of this hospital bed.
Sam shrugs and squints and his computer, making a quick note in the open notebook next to him. “Nasty vamp nest, out in South Carolina. Jack and Derek want to go, but Jack’s still a little shaky without his powers and Derek’s so new. I trust Claire and Jody, but we still need to get their confidence up.” Dean does not say
Dean can’t sleep and he lies awake for hours, just watching the shadows on the walls of his bedroom, and telling himself they don’t look like anything.
“You want to share that?” Dean asks, nodding toward the whiskey bottle.  Castiel nudges it toward him, but Dean lifts Castiel’s glass instead, taking a quick swallow and grimacing around the burn. “I thought you were tired,” he says, softly.
Cas held up a hand. “That was years ago, Dean. We’ve changed. I just have to figure out how to do it now.”
“Chuck, then?”  Sam reaches out to put one hand on Dean’s forearm, and Dean lets him, takes a breath in the grounding touch.  He shakes his head again. He can’t. He
“Yeah, no one said you had to.  No one said you had to come last time either, actually, if I remember how that went down.”
Jesse and Cesar share a quick look when Cas steps forward to shake their hands. Dean says, “Cas, this is Jesse and Cesar. We met them on a hunt, what was it, almost five years ago now?”
“For what I said. Before. For putting it on you like that. It wasn’t fair. It was the only way, but still. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have done that if there had been another choice.”
He should be asleep too; this fragile, human body needs it. But that’s the thing about returning from oblivion. Sleep doesn’t hold much appeal.
Sometimes the bunker feels huge and echoing. It’s possible for Sam and Dean to go days without really seeing each other, and Dean knows from experience that that’s still possible even with four people in the place.
Their patient zero, Eric Bond, had always been the outlier of the victims. Definitely a dick, but the kind of dick who was a lawyer for criminals rather than outright being one himself.
“So the first person to touch the victim who has taken a human life is next in line,” Rowena summarizes. There’s a lengthy pause, and then she sighs. “
Apparently not, because Cas is leaning against Baby when Dean gets to the garage about an hour later. He’s wearing one of Dean’s old flannels rolled up to the elbow and the jeans he bought on the last Walmart run that hug the curve of his thighs. Dean’s not sure how you even find jeans that fit that well at Walmart, but that’s what happens when you let Rowena come shopping. The effect is something Dean is still adjusting to.
It’s still not quite the right question, but Dean’s terrified of asking the right questions. What if he still doesn’t like the answers?
Dean nods to the egg carton sitting at his elbow. “Crack two into that bowl over there with a cup of milk. Then melt the butter on the counter in the microwave and add that in.”
They haven’t done this since...well, since before everything went really bad. The last time, they’d had Mary and Jack here with them. Dean swallows hard and takes a sip of his beer, blinking against the sudden sharp pressure in his eyes.  They are
Castiel looks at Dean then - really looks at him, the tension in his face, the shadows under his eyes, the bottle of whiskey behind him on the counter, sans glass. None of it looks good.
Cas shakes his head. “No. I didn’t. I would have, I think. But I didn’t.” Dean squeezes his knee, not sure how to respond. Team Free Will, right? They’re such a fucking mess.
He wasn’t there long. Time moves differently in the Empty or, more aptly, there is no time. The Empty is an absence, after all, of time and space and being. He remembers only darkness, snatches of nightmares, a feeling of regret and pain, with nothing tangible to hang it on. It could have been five minutes. It could have been a decade. It could have been centuries.
Conveniently, he finds both coffee and Cas in the kitchen, luckily without Bobby and crew. Cas is leaning against the sink with a bottle of water, in a tracksuit, sweaty from a run. He wears tracksuits now, and he runs, possibly more than Sam does.
“Everything. I once spoke every language. I remembered...everything. Or thought I did. They reprogrammed me in Heaven so many times, more than I knew. I’m not sure I knew what was real.” And wow, does Dean know that feeling. He’s still not sure, even now, how much of the path of his life was Chuck, or how much of what and who he is is the weapon John Winchester fashioned in the quest for revenge, or even how different those things are, in the end, cause and effect spilling out through the years. Has he ever made his own choices? He hopes so.
Jesse gestures to the overstuffed leather couches taking up most of the living room. “Come have a beer and tell us about it.”
.  We talked about it. He doesn’t feel like he can just pick and get a job or go to college, or whatever; if this gives him a purpose, I don’t…” he trails off, then adds, “We’re all just feeling our way through this, right?”
Sam clears his throat. “Eileen ran into some trouble on a haunting case out in Virginia. I’m going to head out that way tomorrow to help her out.”
He’s impressed by this, though, the way Cesar and Jesse have built a new life from the raw materials of their old one. He wants to ask if they ever felt this unmoored and isn’t sure how.
“Part of family? But it’s a different kind of affection, a different kind of connection. Not more, necessarily, but different.”  He sighs, dropping his head into his hands. “I don’t know how to explain this.”
They kiss for what could be minutes, what could be hours. It’s a slow, slow build, every touch almost
Dean squeezes his arm again and drops into the chair next to him. So close, still close enough to touch.
Rowena shrugs, and looks at him out of the corner of her eye. “Those who can’t do, teach,” she says, self-deprecating and sardonic.
“You’re surprised?” Castiel watches the line of Dean’s spine, the curve of his neck, the hitch of his shoulders as he almost visibly collects himself. It’s not the kind of thing anyone in this bunker tells each other, and they both know that.
Dean knows Cas is annoyed he didn’t wait for backup, but he also figures partly the problem is just that they’re constantly tripping over each other. They’ve never really spent so much extended, unbroken time together. Dean’s never actually spent so much extended, unbroken time with
The Accident, as Dean comes to think of it later, the same way he thinks about The Fire or The Deal or The Mark or The Fall, like a formal, dividing line between before and after, happens in Ogden, UT. It doesn’t really warrant that kind of gravitas; it’s hardly on par with an apocalypse, but it’s a pivot all the same, a kind of slamming, sudden stop.
Sam goes to bed, and Dean knows he should too. He’s been awake for approaching forty-eight hours and he’s shaking with exhaustion and the adrenaline crash. The whiskey isn’t helping much either, but it soothes his still jangling nerves and slows the racing in his head.
Cas looks up at him then, something both apologetic and defiant his gaze when their eyes meet. “Dean, I made a deal. Me for Jack.”
It’s...different. There’s a soft knitted blanket on the bed in a deep forest green. There are stacks of books on the desk - research books from the library, yes, but also a tattered copy of Slaughterhouse Five and a hardback copy of the full works of Shakespeare - where did that even come from? There’s a picture of Claire on the shelf on the wall, and one of Cas and Jack together that Sam took and Jack used to have in his room. Cas must have had a copy made at some point. And there’s the mixtape, on the shelf next to the photographs. Dean inhales sharply through the sudden surge of emotion.
“Dean,” Cas says again, softly this time, more gently than he’s said anything to Dean since the night he walked out. “We have eleven hours and,” he checks his watch, “forty-five minutes. We don’t have time.”
tired of deathbed confessions,” he says, stepping back into the room. They stare at each other at each other and Castiel blinks first. “I love you,” he adds, helplessly, cutting right to complicated, twisted up core of it. He’s said it before - they’ve both said it now. He’s not sure what Dean will let it mean, or what he himself even needs it to mean. There are intricacies of human emotion that still leave him reeling, but he likes the warmth he sees on Dean’s face.
Cas sighed. “For what it’s worth, I think Jack made the right choice, and I think you were right to let him. Killing Chuck...I was willing to try when it seemed like the only way, but this way at least we maintain balance. God and The Darkness together.”
“I don’t know. It’s hard not to second guess everything. I feel paranoid, but I’m just so tired of cosmic influence.”
“Cas, listen,” he said. “If we don’t make it out of this,” he paused, trying to catch Cas’s eyes, but Cas was staring down at their joined hands, between them on the table.  Dean swallowed hard. “I think we will; I have to, but if we don’t, you should know…”
After that, Sam puts a moratorium on shop talk for the rest of the afternoon. The liquor store is sampling whiskey from Union Horse Distilling. They try all of the samples, and buy a bottle of rye. They get burgers to soak up the whiskey before they drive home. It’s a good afternoon. It’s been too long since he’d really just spent time with Sam like this, easy and companionable. They all probably could use some more breaks to offset the constant backdrop of apocalypse-induced anxiety. After all, if the word is ending they should probably think about how they want to spend their time.
There’s still so much unsaid between them. There are things he doesn’t know how to say, and there’s pain on both sides he doesn’t know how to heal. There have been times over the last month when Castiel has selfishly hated Chuck more for the wedge driven between himself and Dean than for any of the other horrors, and he knows there’s a tempest on the horizon, coming for them, ready or not. But he’ll take this in the eye of the storm.
He hasn’t had a moment alone with Dean yet. Sam and Michael were there in the Empty, and then once they were back, really back, Jack was there too, and Eileen, and Bobby, Charlie, Donna, Jody, Claire. The whole of his human family, relieved and alive and wrapped around him.
it meant it didn’t need to be a secret, so he still had a few things to learn about life in the Winchester family.
Dean stares at him. Of course. This is everything he’s been both afraid of and waiting for, with nowhere to hide. “Okay...”
He wakes up alone in the clearing at the foot of the portal with the grass flattened around him and Leviathan dead on the ground, oozing black into the dirt. He’s got Leviathan blood on him and it smells like oil and rot.
“I am sorry,” Dean says, and it’s the best he can do here in the dark with the pain building behind his eyes and Cas staring at him, gaze heavy with everything they haven’t said.
like possession, and Stevie backed me up. Right, Stevie?” He looks up at her expectantly, and she’s just looking back and forth between them.
Dean opens his mouth like he’s about to say something. Then closes it again and shakes his head. “Yeah, okay,” he says, swallowing hard. He stares at Castiel for a moment, searching, and then turns to continue their trek through the forest. Castiel follows.
Dean cut a swathe through Purgatory before. Castiel had taken down every Leviathan that came for him, and that was before whatever destruction Naomi and the other angels wrought when they dragged him out. They’re both strategists; they should have known they were walking into an entire world that wanted revenge. That’s the worst part. But Chuck, and the immediacy of the need, it clouds everything.
He doesn’t mind the easy hunts, really. They wrap up quickly, people are grateful, and he doesn’t have to think too hard about anything other than the investigation. Sam can pretend he’s sending them on cakewalks for Cas’s sake, while he gets his sealegs, and Dean can pretend Cas doesn’t call Sam to debrief on Dean’s mental state when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. Everything is fine.
“Hey. The first time. After the fall. I don’t if I ever really said I was sorry. I didn’t want you to leave. I should have handled that differently.”
, like a switch flicking off, they explained the plan. He’d said Cas was lucky his power had been so low to begin with, and that an angel at full power could never have survived something like that. And Dean had spent another week sitting by Cas’s bed feeling sick until Cas finally blinked open his eyes and asked for Dean by name.
Dean walked into the bathroom to find Cas wrapped in a towel, staring at his reflection in the mirror speculatively.
He gets off the floor and he texts Sam to tell him he’s alive and Billie’s gone. Sam texts him back to tell him everything he already knew. It was Chuck after all - it always is - and the others are gone, their friends and family snatched away in an eye blink. Sam’s a smart kid and must have caught the “I” in “I’m alive.” His next message just says they’re headed for the bunker and for Dean to stay put. Where would even go, alone?
That’s...a statement they should probably unpack at some point. “I always worry, Cas, but it’s not a reflection on your ability to hold your own.”
“No,” he swallows hard against the lump in his throat and closes his eyes, “it was the Empty. It took out Billie too. She had us, and Cas knew the Empty was the only thing that could stop her.”
Castiel isn’t sure how long they stand there. He's freaking Dean out a little; he knows it, tipping his hand that there's something else he's not saying. He can feel it in Dean's shuddering breath under his palms and in the apprehension spiking off Dean in waves that Castiel can detect even through his weakened grace. He’s never touched Dean like this, when it’s not a reunion or a resurrection or a definitive good-bye. He could get used to it, if things were different. If there was time.
Sirens are fucked up for a lot of reasons, but one of the big ones is motivation. They don’t feed.  It’s not about survival. They’re cruel and they just get bored. This one clocked them as hunters and was just having
He was never certain, before, if time passed the same in Purgatory as on Earth. Even with angelic senses, he’d lost so much sense of time in the endless sameness of the days. Dean had complained of the impossibility of telling the time by the angle of the sun with the way the hazy, directionless daylight seemed to fade in and out. The days never shortened or lengthened, and the temperature never changed except for the added chill at night. It hadn’t really mattered then, but it matters now.
“Goddamnit,” Dean swears, turning to drop the whiskey bottle onto the table with an audible thud. “He just wasn’t going to tell us?” He asks more quietly, with his back to Castiel.
His heart beat before. He breathed before. But it was different. There was a redundancy to those human responses of his vessel (of his body - it was his even then) when his grace threaded through him, when there was still part of him that felt separate from blood and bone and breath.
There’s not much space between the bed and the table, and when Cas turns to face him, their knees brush.
It’s humbling when Cas talks like that, the reminder that his crabby friend who can’t function in the morning before coffee remembers 300 million years ago and is somehow here with him, in the day-to-day mundanities of this life. But there’s something enthralling about that too, Cas and the limitless horizon.
“Not in those words. But look, that last case was a blow, I know. For him, and for all of us.” Dean knows that’s less true for Sam than for the rest of them, but Sam gets points for tact. “He needs a little space and to get his confidence back. He needs to feel like we trust him to handle himself.”
They pass on Cesar and Jesse’s contact info to Sam and Eileen and head for Denver, another haunting. Cas is quiet and contemplative on the drive.
They had two options - Billie’s way or Amara’s way, Death or the Darkness, mutually exclusive choices because if Amara’s way failed, there was no guarantee Jack would have enough juice left for Plan B. In the end it had been Jack’s call, and Dean had been guiltily relieved that for once it didn’t fall to him or Sam.
Cas glances at him sideways, wide-eyed and caught, and then gestures to himself, chagrined. “Celestial being. Super hearing. We
He pours two glasses of whiskey. When he looks up, Cas is eyeing him warily, but he reaches out and takes one of the glasses, easing down onto the side of the bed facing Dean. He’s not making any sudden movements, like he’s afraid Dean will startle. It’s a little insulting. It’s also fair.
Castiel flinches. He was going to leave a note. He wasn't sure yet what it was going to say. "I’m telling you now,” he says again. “And…” he hesitates; it’s a lot to ask, but “...I need you to not tell Jack that you know.”
“Yes, but it’s a clumsy analogy,” Cas says. He’s touching Dean now, fingertips light on his wrist, trailing up his forearm. Dean closes his eyes against it and breathes. “Really, I compared knowing you to revelation. To seeing and understanding the full complexity and beauty of the world for the first time. To being able to
“No, actually,” he says, tone clipped, and eyes not really meeting Dean’s. “I was too busy calling 911 and figuring out what I was going to tell the paramedics when they got there. Don’t worry, Sam sent in a cleanup crew after.”
“Yeah, there’s no way I’m sleeping tonight either,” Dean says. Silence falls between them - Castiel can hear the generator and the beat of his own heart. It’s not an uncomfortable silence, but it’s a loaded one - cocked and waiting.
But there’s still a tension between them, more now, that the siren came along to raise more questions. They’ve had things unsaid between them for years, maybe from the beginning; that’s not new. But Dean feels like something is
He drops his head into one hand and pulls in a shuddering breath. When he’s under control enough to speak, he raises his eyes to where Jack has sat down next to Sam, eyes wet and still wide, tears not quite spilling over. Dean can’t look at him.
“Why did it even work?” Sam asks, either ignoring the tension or just powering through. Dean’s starting to understand how Sam’s managed a lot of the last ten years by just pretending he doesn’t notice things. “He’s all powered up, and we know siren venom doesn’t work on angels.”
“Dean,” Cas starts again, blinking through the shock. Dean shakes his head and lifts his hand to cup Castiel’s face and run one thumb over his cheek bone.
For a while there, after he lost his grace, he sat in his room and stared at the walls, and Dean was a little afraid he wasn’t going to get up again at all. Then, when he finally did, he got all the way up and went to the gym until he learned to throw a punch with new human muscles and to the shooting range until he could hit a bullseye and now there’s jogging. Dean doesn’t hate it, but it’s a whole new world. The normal clothes, the flex of Cas’s bicep, the line of his throat as he swallows - it all still hasn’t stopped doing weird things to Dean’s insides.
Jack clearly does love the idea of getting out of the bunker and getting a chance to do something other than
They’ve talked since Jack got back, though Dean knows it’s not enough. Dean hadn’t quite been able to articulate his relief or his fear, or how his grief for both Jack and his mom had played on each other until he didn’t know how to see through any of it, how sometimes anger is the only emotion he can draw from when he’s looking for strength because everything else is so overwhelming it’s incapacitating when he can’t afford to be incapacitated. He’d settled on “I’m sorry” and hoped it conveyed any of that.
The physicality of sense memory is such a human thing, but he’s struck all the same by the way that Purgatory smells like rot, and guilt, and sacrifice.
Castiel edges closer to him out of that protective impulse he’s never really able to bury, especially not on a hunt, and especially not
The days were a warzone, but Dean knew what to do with that, how to survive while running on instinct, adrenaline, and single-minded devotion to a cause. There was a simplicity and clarity in Purgatory during the day - first, find Cas. Then, find Cas and
Dean closes his eyes. God, he hates hospitals. He can remember the house, the poltergeist, then nothing. He’s trying to do the math on the drive from Lebanon to Ogden, but his head is spinning and foggy and his thoughts can’t quite catch.
Once Dean has managed to stand on his own, he insists he can shower on his own and limps off toward the bathroom. Castiel gathers the rest of the spell ingredients together on the table - that’s for tomorrow, hopefully with Sam and Eileen back and Dean and Castiel both somewhere closer to fighting strength.
When Cas is in the bunker, he sits at Dean’s side looking for new leads and drinking Dean’s whiskey, even though it doesn’t do much for him. He watches Jack with cautious, worried eyes.
Dean looks down and clears his throat. “Yeah, well, it’s okay if you have fun too and don’t worry so much about him for a night.”
The way back is a battle, everything they’d been expecting from the beginning and then some. Purgatory throws everything it has at them, except Leviathan, and it feels like a trap, or calculated attacks. Leviathan are the only ones here capable of that level of strategy and interspecies cooperation.
When they get to the room, Cas is standing next to the exam table in just a t-shirt, and Dean can see he’s bandaged from shoulder to elbow. The doctor is standing against the sink, making notes in a folder.
Cas downs his drink in one swallow and eyes the glass thoughtfully when he sets it down. “Silver lining, though, I might be weak enough that drinking will actually do something.”
like her either, and maybe that meant something too. Dean’s not sure coincidence even exists anymore. “You know why I didn’t even bother with you, right?” she hissed in a whisper, “People pining like you are? You’re no fun. It’s too much work to get close enough for the kiss. You don’t want anything but what you have, even when you’re miserable. You can’t even see anybody else.” She’d cast her eyes toward Cas and giggled.
that obligation - something he never wanted to be to begin with - they’ve generally had some pretty radical differences of opinion on how that should be handled. Cas loves him and sacrifices for him, and for Sam and Jack and the world, but he doesn’t stay. It’s always something, and Dean’s always turning around and getting blindsided by Cas’s best intentions. (Case in point: the narrowly dodged bullet of the deal with The Empty, what the actual fuck.)
“Does it hurt? You’re not sick again? I’m sorry I didn’t...” Dean breathes out harshly and looks down, tapping his knuckles against the closed laptop. Castiel has things he wants to say about the last few months, and things he still wants Dean to say. He doesn’t know what to do with the Purgatory confession. That's the kind of thing they usually just let slide. He's not sure he can do that this time, but he also doesn’t want Dean’s guilt. Guilt has never really helped either of them.
When he says that, kind of flippantly, trying not to think about the pending surgery on his knee, the ache in his head that won’t quit, and the magic Sam is probably having to work to fake the insurance coverage, Sam just glares and Cas gets up and walks out of the room.
Cas narrows his eyes, searching, and Dean drops his gaze so they don’t end up in a staring contest he knows he can’t win.
,” Castiel says desperately. He knows, with a sudden and settled conviction, that he wouldn’t have, for better or worse, for Heaven or Hell. He’s not proud of that, exactly, because Dean wasn’t wrong that the stakes are world-endingly high, but he’d have stayed and he’d have torn Purgatory apart. They have that in common. Dean taught him to be human. What does he expect?
“Hey,” he finally says. Cas hmms in his throat, both an acknowledgement and a dismissal. The scrape of a turned page is louder than it should be in the silence. Dean beelines for the whiskey.
. It had taken him a hunt on his own and a week of sitting by a river with a fishing pole trying to meditate to sort out the threads of that.
“Yeah, to another hunter. Easier said than done might be right, but she’s the best. This is our friend Cas.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Cas says, “since what you said in Purgatory. There’s something else I need to tell you.”
now. There’s a conversation abandoned half-way through, an unanswered question hanging in the air, and it leaves him with this unsettled feeling, even when Cas is smiling at him warmly across the table or squeezing his shoulder as he brushes by. Dean put about half his cards on the table in Purgatory, but there are a few more to play. Cas’ cards are already out there, probably, but they’ve never made complete sense. Dean’s never been totally sure they’re playing the same game, and it leaves him on edge; a constant state of waiting for something he can’t quite bring himself to name.
“Cas,” he gasps, clutching at Castiel's shoulder and trying to push himself into a sitting position before flinching and dropping back onto his back with a groan.
Dean huffs a laugh, and flinches again, his hand going back to his side. “‘Course not. That shirt’s Sam’s anyway.” He looks up with narrowed eyes. “Are you okay, though? What’s going on with your grace?”
By the time they get back to the portal, the flowers have bloomed from the Purgatory soil watered with Leviathan blood. Castiel gathers a few. They’re shades of black and eerily delicate. They smell like iron and rot.
Dean isn’t dead. He’d know. That's always been simultaneously the most comforting and terrifying element of their bond - the low-key ache of Dean’s longing he can feel through the tendrils of his grace and how he feels it like a gut punch when it’s snuffed out. Dean isn’t the only one who sends out those waves of emotion. He can feel it from Claire sometimes. Sometimes from Sam. But Dean’s the only constant, this humming on the edge of his awareness, vague and wordless most of the time. They’ve never talked about it. He doesn’t know what it means. Before he’d been human, he’d never really wondered, and since then he’s spun in circles over and over for years trying to put words or context to what they are.
, Sammy.”  And he didn’t, or at least not intentionally, though admittedly he hasn’t done much of anything with any real intention for a while now. “It’s a ghost, right? Salt and burn. I’ll be back by dinner.”
But in hindsight, what does normal even mean? It doesn’t exist right now, and Dean’s not going to pretend it does. All routine cases - vampires, ghosts, wendigos, any monsters out of Greek mythology - are going to Donna and Jody and Dean is going to examine every document and artifact in the bunker or interrogate every single angel, demon, or ancient cosmic entity until they find an answer to Chuck. And he’s not going to die trying because that’s what Chuck wants.  And he’s not going to do anything that does NOT involve finding Chuck because
She leans against the sink with folded arms, eyes darting back and forth between Dean and Cas. It doesn’t strike Dean as a very doctorly pose. Then she sighs.
And then Dean and Cas are alone in the bunker for an unknown length of time, which Dean probably should have given more thought to before agreeing to this.
“Do you want company?” he asks quietly. Dean can only make a slight affirming noise, afraid to move too much because any movement at all threatens to exacerbate the pain. He doesn’t, really, want company in general, but it’s okay that Cas is there, offering silent comfort. Cas turns toward him and puts one hand on Dean’s shoulder, rubbing his thumb back and forth, a calming, grounding pressure, until Dean sleeps.
of protecting Dean and Sam both, and maybe the rest of the world, given everything his choices had gotten them to that point.
He finds Dean steps from a river.  It's a different one than where Dean found him all those years ago, but still. It makes Castiel wonder and worry, a little, about narrative and symmetry and the foundation of all of Dean’s fears.
The point was saving the world. Living through it was always just kind of a nice-to-have. Sam won’t like that if Dean says it out loud. “What?” He says, half-smile, one eyebrow cocked, a mask of bravado Sam sees straight through. “Hunting’s a day job now?”
Cas slips into the room, careful not to open the door too wide, and eases himself onto the other side of the bed, up against the headboard.
“Maybe not. But I should have told you.” He holds up one hand when Dean starts to interject. “And I know you forgive me, and I accept your apology too,
Then, while they’d been busy with their suspicions about Alexis, the bartender with the Led Zep t-shirt and the killer darts game who’d been flirting with Dean for days, the siren had gotten to Jack as the bubbly coffee-slingling waitress at the diner next to the motel. They hadn’t seen it coming until Jack had texted Cas that he was “going to talk to some kids from town and see if they saw anything” and then hadn’t come back.
Castiel is trembling, dragged under by memories of lonely Purgatory nights and a year of unanswered prayers, when Dean’s voice in his head fades out after that. He presses one hand against a tree to steady himself, and focuses in on the longing pulling at him, clearer now and shining like a beacon.
And it’s not that Dean doesn’t know Cas loves him. He has been paying attention for the last decade and change. But Cas is also impulsive and opaque. He has his own agenda and obligations, and even when Dean
After everything went bad, but before it went nuclear, when Dean was spiraling, Cas looked at him and said, “we are real.” Dean still doesn’t quite know what that means or which way is up, or how much of their heads and histories have been fucked with, but there are things that he can choose. He can choose what he believes in. He can choose how to react.
Dean’s making pancakes, just for something to do that’s not sitting in the library reading the same book for the fourth time, when Jack finds him one morning.
Dean says what they’re both thinking, when Castiel takes down the werewolf standing over him and pulls him to his feet.
They’ve been moving slowly, in expanding circles, so they’re maybe an hour walk back, but they don’t get far.
. You, me, Sam - we’re just spectators tomorrow, keep the attention off Jack, Rowena and Adam long enough for… I don’t know.”
Castiel nods and turns away. He turns back once, at the base of the stairs and their eyes catch and hold. Dean gives him a hesitant smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.
Jody, Donna, Claire, that witchy Shawn kid they liberated from Georgia, whoever else happens to be hanging around on any given day, they all hover around him, ready to pull out a chair or grab his arm if he’s the least bit unsteady.
She went after Cas as a witness the were interviewing - a very male, flannel-wearing theology student who knew a lot about old cars and wanted to talk all about his dysfunctional family and something called gnosticism. Dean’s still processing the fact that had apparently worked - and there is so much to unpack there he’s not sure he’ll ever get it fully sorted - but at least they’d learned that siren venom doesn’t work on angels.
“No. I’m not in pain. I don’t feel sick or even physically weakened that much beyond...it’s like I reach for my grace and I feel it but I can’t… I feel more…” he trails off again, out of words to explain the way his grace just won’t respond, the control and effort it’s started to take to do things that were once as natural as blinking or breath.
Castiel’s heart kicks up a notch, he doesn’t know how Dean doesn’t hear it now, echoing off the walls or in the hollow of his chest. There’s something like apprehension or the tendrils of treacherous hope churning his gut. “Dean, you don’t have to say anything. I want to be here. I know …” he starts to say, wants to make it clear that he
“Yeah, I know. But sirens get in your head and twist everything around, so you don’t even know what’s real, and…” Dean trails off and gives a wry laugh, no humor in it. “The kid’s had enough of that.”
For all the bouncing around the country he’d done as a kid, Dean was fifteen the first time he’d seen the ocean, and there was always something frightening and enthralling about the expanse of it, the limitless horizon.
“Fuck, Cas. What did we walk into?” Castiel doesn’t answer and Dean sighs. “There’s always something bigger and badder waiting for us. Awesome. I love being Purgatory’s most wanted.”
Dean’s still clinging to him a little, just as tight, shaky where he stands, and it’s so clear to Castiel now, everything he missed, years thrown into sharp relief. He’s not sure how he missed
As predicted, Cas does not love the idea of Jack going off to hunt ghosts with Sam and Eileen, but he also clearly doesn’t want to be too visibly against it for fear of insinuating he doesn’t trust Sam to take care of Jack. He eyes Dean suspiciously when they tell him the plan, but Dean shrugs and shakes his head, trying to use wide eyes and a neutral expression to indicate his innocence.
think I…” his voice wavers as he trails off again, unable to finish whatever he was trying to choke out.
Cas raises one eyebrow, deeply unimpressed. “I’ve witnessed a wide variety of human sexual acts since before your species had language. Yes, I think I understand the mechanics.”
“Okay,” Jack says, stepping forward to the counter, keeping just enough distance so that their shoulders don’t brush.
“You mean the helplessness, while you just wait, and watch? I do, actually,” he bites out, a little mean. “Welcome to humanity, buddy.”
, which Dean is not going to do, but he has learned that it’s best to just make vague, noncommittal noises. (“TBI can make depression worse,” Sams says, like a random observation he’s sharing about the weather, and not something Dean has received and ignored several medical opinions about by this point. Dean wishes someone would take away
It was clever of his family, really. He’s proud of them, all of them - his human family and even his obnoxious brother, because Michael came through. It was a good plan - wake up all of the angels, break them out, repopulate Heaven, and then lock it down, leave Earth to the humans, finally. At last.
which is 1) unhelpful and 2) just about all he’s capable of anyway. He’s been reactive for so long, hanging on a knife’s edge of desperation and limited choices, that he’s a little afraid it’s all he’s ever been capable of.
“Do we?” Dean asks, and he’s being sarcastic, but also honest. Angel hearts aside and all the best intentions, Jack’s still a wild card. May always be a bit of a wild card.
, every sound in the distance a threat. There were no benign forest creatures in Purgatory. Dean always felt watched.
“I’ve loved you for a quarter of my life,” Dean says, into the silence, and tries not to flinch, saying that out loud for the first time. “You’ve known me for the cosmic equivalent of less than five minutes. That can’t carry the same weight. I’m not doubting you. I’m not questioning that you want to be here.  I’m not questioning that we matter to you, that you,” he swallows, “love us, but...”
Cas is silent for a long moment. Too long. When Dean dares another glance at him, Cas is staring at the ceiling.
Dean shakes his head. “I’m fine.” He moves tentatively when he pushes himself back against the headboard.
If Cas thought. Not thinks. They had a shot at a future, a real one, a  better one than Dean ever knew or let himself hope for, but that’s over now. And when he lets himself sit with that - if he even gets a chance to when this is all over - it’s going to break him for good.  But he owes Cas more than to let that happen now.
Castiel sighs, but rearranges them to get one arm under Dean, careful of the side he's still favoring, bringing the other down to cover Dean’s fingers. Dean relaxes against him in the darkness, squeezing his hand. Castiel feels some of his own tension evaporate under the soothing rub of Dean’s thumb against his hip.
That night Dean decides it’s movie night. They’ve done sci-fi. They’ve done cowboys.  They have not done slasher flicks from the 70’s and 80’s. Dean has fallen down on his pop culture education job. Luckily, Dean picked up a bunch at sale at the used CD/DVD/bookstore in town awhile back. Cas narrows his eyes, studying the back cover of
“I’m not much of an angel. My grace has been at half-strength for years and is growing weaker, and if Metatron wasn’t lying when he took it for the spell, I have a soul now.”
He pours himself a drink, downs it, and then pours another. He considers for a moment and then pours one for Cas too, like the world’s shittiest peace offering, and slides it across the table. Cas starts and their eyes catch and hold - one beat, two, before Cas looks away. His jaw is tight, but he picks up the glass, rolling it in his hand so the whiskey catches the lamp light.
“I don’t know.” He’s been trying not to think about it too much; they'd had bigger problems. Though now he has to admit it's one of the big problems; he knows that his grace fritzing out in the middle of a fight could end up being a significant problem all on its own.
For the second time tonight, he reaches down deep, pulling from a well he's terrified is empty. His grace fizzles at his fingertips, sputtering before a weak spark finally catches. He watches the skin in Dean’s side knit back together until Dean inhales sharply and opens his eyes.
Sam smirks at him. “I’m just saying. I’ve been on the receiving end of that kind of worry, and it can be a lot. I know there are things we need to figure out, but let me do this. Let him do this. Eileen, Jack, and I can handle a couple of ghosts.”
They end up in Castiel’s room. He’s never made much use of it, and he’s not sure now he’ll ever have cause to know. He won’t need it, not with the way Dean is pressed up against him, still murmuring promises into his skin.
He wasn’t worth it, of course; he’s never been worth a damn, but if Cas thinks he is, if Cas thinks he’s worth that level of devotion, of
Dean can’t sleep and he finds Cas reading in the library. They sit in companionable silence until the sun comes up.
He never had a moment in Purgatory before when he didn’t feel watched, but now everything feels unnervingly quiet and still. He shakes his head. “It shouldn’t matter. They’ll come to us.”
Sam laughs a little wetly. Dean can see him better now, and he looks wan and tired, bags under his eyes.
He says, “What happened to Mom. What happened with Jack. We all saw it. I should have known. I think I did. It wasn’t your fault.”
“Yeah. I meant what I said to Sam. If what Chuck showed him was bad enough that he didn’t think it was worth the risk, I trust that. I think...we just have to trust each other." And he knows that's maybe not the approach he would have taken last year, or even last week, but something shifted in Purgatory. They do have to trust each other, or they're not getting out of this. And he desperately, desperately wants there to be another way. "Listen," he says, "the Mark, I lived with it. Hell, I died with it.”
These are the kinds of questions that keep Dean up at night when he’s not already being kept up at night by the end of the world. Sometimes he’s not sure which he prefers.
Dean’s a balls-to-the-wall, all-or-nothing kind of guy. He’s not sure he really knows how to do that.
On the other side of the portal, Dean trips, falling to his knees and taking Castiel down with him since he's still supporting most of Dean’s weight. When Dean clings tighter to his shoulder, Castiel tips their foreheads together, and they just kneel there in each other’s arms and breathe until the portal snuffs out behind them.
When he comes back into the room in worn sweatpants and old t-shirt (he may be too old for grave digging, but he’s definitely too old to sleep in his jeans), Cas hasn’t moved, and God, Dean is tired and he
Castiel hears a sharp grunt from Dean and the scuffle of a fight behind him. He whirls around, rushing back to Dean, Dick’s laugh still ringing.
counts as coercion, but fine. “Yeah, why does it feel even harder when it’s someone else’s sacrifice?”
It’s quick and utilitarian because the trappings of religion can fuck off forever, but it’s mostly symbolic all the same. Dean’s not sure it’s legally binding; everyone involved is legally dead and counterfeit last names are on the marriage certificate, but he goes to the courthouse with them as a witness and signs his real name in an illegible scrawl underneath his printed alias so that it feels authentic.
.” His fingers are still digging in tight on Dean’s arm.  Dean’s watching Sam’s face closely; he sees Sam’s eyes widen slightly when he really looks and takes in the bloody handprint on Dean’s shoulder; he sees the bob of Sam’s throat as he swallows down whatever else he was going to say.
Cas hovers around him as he gets to his feet, and Dean can feel Cas watching him as he limps back to the car, a low ache in his right hip that he knows is going to turn into a nasty bruise over the next few days.
After they order, Sam excuses himself to step outside, caught up in his texting conversation - with Eileen, Dean assumes, those he’s been cautious about pushing too hard with questions there.  It makes Sam quiet, and introspective and
Dean kisses him, just a press of their lips together, hand tight on Castiel’s jaw. Castiel freezes for a minute, struck by the enormity of this moment, too stunned to respond. But then he feels a slight hesitation as Dean starts to pull back, and that can’t happen. He leans in, catching Dean’s mouth more firmly, and feeling Dean open up and melt against him. Dean’s fingers slide around the back of Castiel’s head as he pulls Castiel against him more tightly.
Both let down and relieved, Dean just nodded and took the whiskey when Cas pushed the glass back toward him.
, and there was nothing to keep the doubt from creeping in. What if Cas and Benny were right? What if the portal didn’t work and Dean ended up leaving alone?
Apparently, what Cas told the paramedics was as close to the truth as he could get. He and his husband are ghost hunters, they snuck into an abandoned building, Dean lost his balance and fell. He was a little defensive about the “my husband” lie, eyes flashing like he was daring Dean to question it, quick to specify that claiming to be immediate family was the only way they’d let him stay.
“I’ll try not to.” And he means it - they could both stand to be more careful. He didn't survive literal hell multiple times, God, Lucifer, demonic possession, and all the rest of that shit to get ended by a teenage poltergeist in Utah. That's just embarrassing.
“Yeah, if I didn’t know better, I’d say possession,” Stevie says, closing Cas’s folder, and sitting back in the booth to cross her arms over her chest.
. You were an angel. You feel longing, you heard my prayers, you held my soul in your hands and put me back together, so you know things I’ve never told another living person about
He’s done this so many times - take the hit, absorb the shock, and keep moving.  Push through the pain, bury it deep, curl his finger around the trigger or his hand around the hilt of the knife, and step back onto the battlefield. It feels different this time because it’s the last time.  He knows that with the same certainty, settling in and making its home in his chest. He’s got one more fight left in him.
If Chuck’s going to  manipulate everything they touch anyway, Dean wants it to be a straightforward fight. He’s tired of guessing at the subtext of his own life. He’s just tired.
Sam looks up, a little startled, and looking a little disappointed when he sees Dean’s face.  “What?”
Dean sighs and takes a sip of his coffee, just for something to do. That answers one question he had a vested interest in, but opens up several more. Like, what, exactly, about the siren in that form appealed to Cas’ interests?  Like, was Cas not particularly interested in kissing the siren, specifically, or not particularly interested in kissing at all?
he had something to do with this - and we don’t know that for sure - then maybe it shows how he’s getting desperate. This wasn’t Cain and Abel here; it wasn’t satanic possession. It was just a monster.”
They went with a dog bite, in the woods, and the hack job stitches were because it was late and they got lost hiking. It’s a stupid story, but Dean’s pretty sure they can effectively convey being the kind of stupid people that would do something like that.
Sam’s a smart kid.  He knows his brother, and his best friend, and Dean sees when he gets it, or something close to it, gets enough that Dean doesn’t have to
Dean breathes out harshly; that’s where he was afraid this was going, but his body still goes hot and shocky. The anger wants to rise, but he pushes it down and breathes through it; at its core is the screaming fear he tries to never let out. Purgatory, the Mark, this. That’s three times he’s nearly lost Cas in two days. The hits keep coming. “The Winchester special. Jesus, you really are one of us,” he says. “That was over a year ago.”
“Hey, you two,” a familiar voice calls out of the darkness. “Fancy meeting you here. Now don’t be shy. Come out or we’ll have to come get you.” Castiel can’t see his face from here, with the way he’s backlit by the portal light, but he knows Dick Roman’s voice too well. Beside him he feels as much as hears Dean’s sharp intake a breath and the way his body goes tense and tight.
Dean gets one hand under Castiel’s shirt (it’s Dean’s shirt, he’s in Dean’s clothes, after all that mess of the Empty, and even that sends a thrill through him now).  Dean’s hand is a brand against Castiel’s bare skin. His other hand, still on Castiel’s jaw, is a demand, and Castiel wants to demand right back, demand everything he thought he could never have, that is now somehow miraculously already his. He doesn’t have much experience with this, but he doesn’t really feel like he needs it, not here with Dean pliant against him, everywhere they touch sending sparks through his new human senses.
They end up at a diner in a town that’s little more than a wide spot in the road on the Kansas/Colorado border. The diner itself has seen better days, all cracked linoleum and creaking vinyl, but the the coffee is serviceable, they have a bacon cheeseburger, and it gives them a minute to stretch their legs and get a little distance. Dean will take it, even if Sam makes a face at the “salad” options.
“Okay, one, you should ask Sam what’s entertaining about serial killers sometime because he loves that topic, and two, these movies are a cultural touchstone. It’s important. ”
Sam sighs. “You know there are caveats to that, right? You’ll be okay if you don’t hit your head again, or break your leg, or put too much stress on your knee. You walked away from that, and nobody was real sure how.” He pauses and swallows hard. “We don’t have to kill ourselves for this fight anymore, wasn’t that the point?”
Jesse squints at him for a moment, and then a broad smile takes over his face as he leans in the door frame and crosses his arms over his chest. “Dean Winchester? Well, I’ll be damned. If you came out here for that chupacabra, I’m afraid you wasted a trip. We took care of that a few days ago. But why don’t you come on in?”
The portal comes into view, gaping like an open wound and bleeding harsh red light into the darkness. There’s a crowd of shadowy figures gathered around it, and Dean stops Castiel with a hand on his arm, just behind the tree line.
. Cas comes in with another round of beers and distributes them before settling back on the floor, leaning against Dean’s chair. Dean squeezes his shoulder in thanks, and when he turns, Sam is just watching them, carding his fingers through Eileen’s hair. Sam quirks an eyebrow when their eyes meet, and Dean turns back to the movie.
Dean’s not sure he’s good now, but collectively the people he loves are, which was really all that ever mattered. All night he’s been trying to avoid saying how weird it is now that the story’s over and they’re living in the epilogue, which Dean wasn’t supposed to be here for and seems to suck at. The crisis is past, which he’s grateful for, but he’s also great in a crisis. He’s apparently not as solid in the aftermath. Which is a thing that he’s learning now because this is the first time he can remember when there hasn’t been a crisis. If your whole life is a crisis, does that still constitute a crisis? Self-discovery is great.
“It’s not…” he starts, and breaks off. Turmoil isn’t the word he’d use for it. He just feels tender, like his emotions are an exhausted muscle or a bruise that aches when he prods at it. “I’m fine.” He says, but that’s not quite right either, and Cas looks at him like he knows it. Dean takes another sip of his whiskey for something to with his hands and tries again. “I don’t know if any of us are okay. I’m a
? “And I know we have bigger things to worry about.” Dean knows that’s true, but in this moment, he doesn’t feel like it is. “And now, you’ve been so uncertain of everything,” Cas continues. “What any of it means. What’s real, what’s Chuck, where it all comes from. Do you still think Chuck had something to do with the siren case?”
Dean looks up at him from the center of the circle. Castiel is not close enough to see his face, but he can hear the desperation and apology in his voice. “The plan changed, Cas.
(Dean said that to Cas, once, and Cas, newly human and still sweating out the fever of his burned out grace, had just blinked at Dean blearily from the nest he’d made of every spare blanket in the bunker and said, “Your life has been very challenging, and I don’t think you have a normal definition of ‘easy’,” before passing out again.
Sam sighs, and drops his head, probably so Dean won’t see him blinking away the wetness in his eyes, though it’s definitely there.
“Dean. Dean, can you hear me?” Sam is saying. Dean registers Sam’s death grip on his right hand and the IV in his left arm, and then, as the fog clears a little more, his left leg, elevated in a sling.
They’re about to start the third one, when Cas goes for his phone again and Dean reaches over him to snatch it off the arm of his chair.
It’s a night for honesty, right? “Come with me?” Dean asks. “Sleep if you need to, or just watch over me, I don’t care.”
Not this time. He bows his head and reaches deep, pulling at the root of his dwindling power, and pushing up and out. His grace floods through him, and he hears something like an explosion, feels something in him crack and blow open before everything goes dark.
Cas’ face turns pensive. He’s drumming his thumb against the table, as though he’s thinking. It’s a very human mannerism. “You’re right,” he finally says, as though making a decision. “We have to trust each other. And we have to be honest. I should have told you about everything with Jack.”
Jesse smiles softly and intimately, looking down. “It’s what Cesar wanted. For so long I didn’t know how to want anything except revenge. He could see a way out when I couldn’t, you know? But I promised him this, and he was right to push for it; it’s amazing.”
Dean claps Sam on the shoulder and gives an impromptu best man toast. The whole time he feels a little bit like he’s watching his family from outside of himself and from a distance.
“What deal?” Sam asks, voice tight, and Dean lets Jack answer that one.  He was there, after all. Jack explains haltingly, providing more context than Dean was given in those few, life-altering minutes - the Empty infiltrating Heaven, the fight. The deal. The temporary reprieve.
“I’ll let you sleep.” Castiel turns to go. He probably should sleep too, actually. He knows where the sheets and the guest rooms are. He doesn’t really want to. He hasn’t really had to since he was sick with the stolen grace, and while he hadn’t minded it as a human, as an angel he doesn’t like it. Angels don’t dream and the loss of consciousness and missing, wasted time leave him disoriented, but with his grace this depleted, he knows his body needs it.
true, either. Dean kind of figures that if Cesar and Jesse didn’t clock him the day they met, all those years ago, it’s only because Cas wasn’t there to make everything blindingly obvious.
Dean spends another month in his room, avoiding most of the bustle of the bunker. He watches movies with Cas. He asks Sam and Rowena polite questions about the artifacts they spend their days digging out of the storage room and lovingly cataloging. He teaches Jack to play pool.
“I didn’t think you’d want me to. You’ve never wanted to talk about it before.” And that’s, well.  How long has Cas
The doctor glances up, pushing dark hair behind her ear and looking him up and down, and then blinks at him with wide, disarming brown eyes. It’s a little terrifying.
Then Sam drove the knife in - the knife they’d cut Jack’s arm with and covered in his blood. Dean stood there, reeling.
“You need to rest. I healed the worst of the internal bleeding and the blood loss, but I know…” he trails off.
Cas quirks a smile, but there’s no humor in it. “My grace.” He closes his eyes, briefly, and when he opens them again, there’s fire there. “It’s like an amputation,” he says, fiercely.
Dean shrugs. “Sure, maybe; there’s a direct link between the victims, and in some cases the only link is physical proximity. But then why does it only jump to one person at a time? You’d think with a contagion we’d have an outbreak.”
Castiel shrugs. “It takes...energy to maintain my clothes and my vess..my body. Not much. Usually it’s almost instinctive, background. But I exhausted enough of my strength that this was much easier. You don’t mind?” He doesn’t add that he couldn’t have done it with grace if he’d wanted to. There wasn’t even enough left for that tonight.
They get through two movies, and Cas is engaged, at least enough to spend most of the movie questioning the judgement of every character on the screen, but his phone is on his other side, and he’s checking it periodically.
It’s not a long way back, but it’s a difficult one. Dean is conscious and moving, but barely, and Castiel feels about as human and worn down as its possible for an angel to feel and still be an angel.
“It’s a milk run,” Dean says, sliding behind the wheel and shifting sideways to look at Cas. “I just need to blow off some steam. You don’t have to come.”
hurt. It’s embarrassing, which is another emotion angels aren’t really supposed to feel, and that has only made him angrier.
while I can.” His voice is flat, carefully neutral. Dean breathes in sharply and looks down; his eyes catch on Mary’s initials, carved into the table top.
Dean is unconscious and breathing, but shallowly. He’s right, the wound in his side is deep, and there’s a lot of blood. It makes Castiel's breath catch in his throat, and it soaks into the knees of his pants when he falls at Dean’s side with a choked out sob of fear.
“He surprised me; that’s all,” Cas continues, gently - too gently for the conversation they’re having, probably.
He  knocks on the door of Cas’ room. Or, more accurately, he knocks on the door of the guest room that he once offered arbitrarily when Cas was human before the Gadreel mess and that Cas now uses on the rare occasion he wants to put a door that locks between himself and the other occupants of the bunker rather than spending his nights haunting the library. Dean usually respects that and doesn’t seek Cas out there. He doesn’t like being in there anyway much; all these years and it still feels too transitory and impersonal; it makes him anxious.
Dean stands under the spray until the water runs cold before he accepts that it’s not going to scald him clean. He lies in bed for two hours before he accepts that he’s going to see Lee every time he closes his eyes, probably for a long, long time.
“I know. I know he did. It’s not your fault.” He doesn’t know that he wants to know what else Cas said about unhappiness, and he knows why Cas took the deal, can’t blame him for doing it, not for that piece.
“Something like that. It’s crazy to think.” Cesar eyes Cas speculatively. “So, you’re the angel, right? We never knew if we should believe that part of the story.”
The vampires come out of nowhere, and they don’t go down easy. When Dean has the last one backed up against a tree, Castiel reaches out to still his hand.
Cas says, “Okay. I’m thinking of how to explain it to you so you’ll stop being stupid.”  He pauses, choosing his words, and Dean waits, heart racing. “Some angels, for a long time, saw humans as a trap. And you were, in a way.  We were supposed to love you, but distantly.  We were supposed to see the beauty of humanity, but not...individuals for the most part.  That wasn’t always how it went. It was hard not to be curious. Some angels spent more time than they should with humans. Some formed friendships.  Some more. It was forbidden, of course, but,” Cas smirks, raising an eyebrow, “you don’t have to forbid things no one wants to do. You met Ishim. And you knew Gabriel.”
He pushed them all as hard as he could, through exhaustion and pain and walls of monsters, because if there was a moment when anything was quiet or still he couldn’t even talk to Cas to distract himself, even though Cas was
Garth and Bess come to visit, and Dean makes burgers and pie from scratch. They break out a few bottles of what he assumes is good wine from the old Men of Letters cellar and sit around the table for hours, just talking. Dean goes to bed after midnight, feeling warm, and full, and hazy, and still a little lost.
He pours more whiskey into his glass and drops his forehead against the hotel room window with a thud. Behind him, Sam is drumming his fingers on the table and clearing his throat, like he’s gearing up to say something he thinks Dean is going to react badly to. So he probably is.
Dean tries to smile, but he’s a little afraid it comes out as more of a grimace. “Me too. Did you at least get the poltergeist?” He means it as a joke, something to lighten up the intense way Cas is just staring at him, but Cas stiffens beside him instead.
something,” Sam had said, when Dean had asked him about it. “She feels like she’s a liability when she’s here with us. She doesn’t want to be used against us again. Chuck got too far in her head. But she feels like working is how she can help.”)
“Not good enough. I need you to say it. And then maybe in eleven and a half hours we have a conversation about the rest of that shit.”
“We can still go with you. Five heads are better than one, or whatever.” Maybe a break will help them all clear out their heads - even if that thinking is how they ended up with the siren debacle to begin with. But ghosts - should be - mostly safe, comparatively.
Cas nods. Dean closes his eyes and sees Cas letting go of his hand at the portal; Cas stepping out of a different rift, glowing ugly against a night sky in Washington, with an angel blade in his back.
When Dean asks for another case, Sam sighs and sends them to Wisconsin on a wild hodag chase. When Dean points out that
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas says. He shifts so that their fingers catch and he can curl his hand over Dean’s and squeeze. “I tried, in the beginning. To retain what I could. But I can’t, and that’s okay.”
Cas stands up from the bed and advances toward him until Dean finds himself backed up against the wall. There’s still space between them, but Dean can feel the heat of Cas’ body, can feel the thud of his own heart in his chest.
Wrong answer, then. Or insufficient one anyway, one tiny rock cleared from the rubble strewn between them.
The pieces fall like dominoes, the boundaries of their history redrawing themselves against this new backdrop, all of Dean’s actions cast in the light of his self-doubt colliding with Castiel’s own self-loathing, and Castiel is stunned. This is a very human physiological reaction, he thinks, distantly, the way the blood has all rushed to his head, and he can’t feel his face or his hands. It’s shock maybe; it’s also clearly true happiness, but the flip side of the calm he felt before. He might shake out of his skin. He also can’t form words enough to respond.
“Do you miss it?” Dean asks, and holds his breath. Maybe this is why they haven’t talked about it. He’s not sure he wants to know, but if Cas needs to talk, he’ll try.
Neither of them has a handle on mortal human alcohol tolerance, and they both drink too much and all the time. Dean doesn’t say anything because he might be a hypocrite, but he’s a self-aware one.
He is not unhappy. That would undo so much. He is not unhappy to be back. He is not unhappy about the joy on Jack’s face or the relief in Sam’s, or about the way Dean folded him into his arms and buried his face against Castiel’s neck, exhaling wetly against his skin and clinging on. He is not unhappy, but he is lost, slammed back into existence and physicality (blood and bone and breath) and he also doesn’t know what happens now.
“I’m fine, Dean,” Cas says, swigging the whiskey Dean sets next to him on the counter.  They have real antiseptic now, of course, but you can’t drink the antiseptic, so whiskey is still a key part of the process.
“I...don’t know.” Castiel says, with dawning horror. That hadn't even occurred to him; he'd been to used to there being no way out. “It’s angelic in nature, but it’s not part of the design of this place. The monsters, the dead souls, no; they can’t get out. It’s not like an alternate universe. It’s like getting out of Heaven or Hell; they wouldn't be corporeal in the real world, but not all of the Leviathan actually died before they were trapped here. It’s...I don’t know.”
He’s so tired. Humanity is exhausting. He’d forgotten that, or repressed it. But now his eyes ache and his hands shake and the whiskey burns his throat going down. He thinks he understands now, the numbness Dean chases at the bottom of the bottle. That burn can calm his racing thoughts and slow the zinging of his nerves. It tempers, a little bit, the way he swears he can feel the blood flowing in his veins.
When he chances a look at Dean, Dean is just gaping at him. “Cas, you saved me. Maybe made it possible for us to save everyone. I don’t..”Dean starts, and then stops, breathing deep and closing his eyes, before opening them again, and focusing all of his attention on Castiel’s face. Castiel shudders. “Are you telling me,” Dean says, quietly, a little dangerous, “that you just gave up your grace, gave up everything,
Except Dean knows he looks like shit, still bruised and haggard, where Sam seems fine - eager and even hopeful, like they aren’t ramping up for a suicide mission. Again.
“You’re a good teacher,” Dean says. It surprises him a little, how patient and thorough she is. He’d never have described her as “nurturing” before.  And if you’d told him even a few years ago he would have a coven forming under his nose, he’d have told you to get stuffed.
It was Jack who told Dean about the deal with the Empty, during the tenuous weeks the two of them spent at Cas’s bedside while he burned with fever and slipped in and out of consciousness and lucidity. Sam spent that time combing through the lore for answers while Rowena combed through the infirmary for anything that might help.
“Hey,” Dean says, voice rough as he comes into the room.  He claps one hand on Castiel’s shoulder, initially strong and sure, but then lets it trail down his arm, as if reluctant to break the contact.
in Dean’s eyes, and then, nothing, nothing, nothing until the infiltration of the Empty and this, choosing Dean again, because he always will.
“Nope, no, we’re done here. Don’t talk to me about the internet; I don’t want to know what you found,” Dean says, and he flees for more pancakes.
They stare at each other for another few minutes before Cas says, “You’re dead on your feet. You have to sleep,” but he doesn’t make a move to get up or untangle himself from Dean. Dean doesn’t remember the last time he was this tired, but he still doesn’t want to be alone, or let Cas out of his sight.
“He’s a little overprotective right now. Jack’s feeling a little...I don’t want to say smothered, but maybe a little confined.”
But now there’s nothing, and uncertainty crawls up his spine. Castiel watches Dean’s throat work as he swallows, then turns away to scan the trees.
“Okay. We both go. But I need you to listen to me when I say we stay together. Promise me. No separating. No splitting up to cover more ground. No leading Leviathans on a wild goose chase, do you hear me?”
Dean scoffs, and turns around so he can actually meet Sam’s eyes. “Sammy, are you telling me you feel good about
“Yes,” he bites out, tossing back the rest of his own whiskey and savoring the burn. When he looks up, Cas is leaning back with his arms folded across his chest, just watching. Dean says, “I’m sorry,” and it hangs in the air between them.
He goes to the bar by himself and puts the work in anyway. An out-of-towner smiles at him just right over their beer (never a local, not in Lebanon) and he goes back to the woman’s hotel room or the bed of the dude’s truck, parked out an old dirt road. It’s fun in the moment, but it doesn’t last, and he drives home in the Impala feeling hollowed out.
But there’s also been something grounding about the hum of someone else's presence in the room and the physical exhaustion of actually spending his days
. But you’re still right. We can’t keep falling into the same patterns. None of us.” He casts a glance to the doorway, as though to include Sam in that too.
They had a run-in with a ghoul outside Atlanta a week ago; they’d split up to do recon and when Dean had a break in the case he went out to the cemetery alone when Cas didn’t answer his phone fast enough, leaving Cas a voicemail about where to find him. Everything worked out fine, minus a few more mild bumps and bruises, but Cas has been snippy with Dean ever since.
Cas is human now, with the freedom of a human life spread out before him. He loves Dean; he loves Jack; he loves them all, and he’ll stay until he finds a purpose that takes him away, or until he decides unilaterally that it’s somehow in Dean’s or Jack's or the world’s best interest for him to go, and when that happens Dean won’t get a say because he never does.
“Yeah, it’s nothing. I’ve had way worse.”  He cracks a smile in Cas’s direction, but it falls a little flat when Cas just scowls at him as if to indicate just how low
Dean comes first, gasping into the hollow of Cas’ throat. Then he gets one hand between them and it doesn’t take much before Cas is shaking against him.
At first his prayers were tactical, a recap of where he’d been and what he’d killed or seen evidence of, landmarks if he had them - anything to help Cas find him. Then they turned angry. By the time he fell in with Benny they were a pleading for any kind of sign.
“I’ve never seen it like this.” Cas hesitates. “Is it strange that everything feels more sacred now? I feel time passing like I never did before. There’s an urgency to it. And something precious in the transience. The ocean looks the same, but it feels bigger than me now, timeless when I’m not. Do all humans feel like this?”
Dean threads their fingers together and stays close as they make their way down the hallway. There’s the same urgency to his touch that’s been there since they got back from the Empty, like he’s still a little afraid Castiel will vanish on him again, but Castiel gets it now, understand what Dean’s been saying for so long with everything except words, and holds back just as tight.
“Yes. Ectoplasm everywhere. Apparitions all over the place. EMF off the charts. No djinn or sirens or mindfuck monsters, I promise.”
Physically, he’s getting there. He goes to his doctor like he’s supposed to and she says things like
When they find the place, it’s a sprawling adobe ranch house with a porch swing swaying on the front porch, overlooking the pasture land. A little black cat uncurls itself from a bed next to the door and wanders over to twine itself around Cas’s legs; he bends down to scratch behind its ears.
“It’s not like that. It’s a tricky case; she burned one body, but it hasn’t stopped. There’s more than one spirit, and it’s an old town with a lot of Revolutionary War history. She just needs another set of eyes on things.”
Castiel takes a step forward, close enough to touch. He wants to touch; he always wants to touch, but it’s an even more intense desire since Purgatory, as his grace gets weaker.  As time gets shorter. “Dean. He made me promise not to. He’s determined to go through with it, if it’s the only way.”
Cas continues, “It was different, for me. Though I’ve always been rebellious in some ways, and I was interested in and curious about humanity, I was never really tempted to get too close… “ He trails off.  “One of my brothers once described humanity as our fruit in the garden. I didn’t understand what he meant. And then I met you.”
Patience and Alex come down by themselves to work with Rowena on harnessing Patience’s natural power and learning cures for supernatural afflictions that they don’t teach in medical school. They’re up all night in the garden on the full moon, and in the morning Dean finds them in the kitchen grinding herbs Rowena swears will speed the healing of any supernatural wound. She’s leaning against the counter sipping her tea and watching them with quiet pride over the rim of her mug.
Sam hovers in the kitchen and asks if he’s feeling better, suspicious and concerned in a way that makes Dean itch. Dean should be asking him that; Sam’s the one who almost died, apparently, while Dean was off...well.
As an angel, Cas could be passive-aggressive, petty, and sarcastic. As a human, he has lost any angelic restraint he once had.
Cas stiffens and drops his hand. “We do,” he says, evenly, staring at the wall, “but he’s still half human and I guess that was enough.”
They never did finish what they started in the library, and Dean hates himself a little for how much easier that conversation seemed when they were staring down the barrel of a loaded gun.
“I hope you’re not regretting your choice already,” Dean says, something dry and a little pained in his voice.
“Yeah. Great. Lucky them, immortality in this place.” His eyes catch on Castiel's, and then flick away.
And they’re alone in the bunker for an unknown amount of time. He pushes up on one elbow, leaning down over Cas because it’s barely early afternoon; the day stretches out before them, and they have plenty of time for the fancy stuff. Cas leans up for a kiss, and they’re off again.
“Oh.” Dean’s thrown a little by that, and kicking himself. This is Cas’s first hunt since...yeah.  He should have checked in more, not thought so much about himself. They haven’t really talked about it, at least not since Cas got out of bed and decided if he was going to be human, he was going to do it well.
Jack is looking down at his plate, pushing a pancake around in a puddle of syrup. “What does it feel like? Being in love for real?”
There are rumors of chupacabras wreaking havoc in southern New Mexico, so they head that way. It’s another “gimme” from Sam; chupacabras are pretty straightforward - fast, but not too big or bright, easy to find if you know what you’re looking for, and relatively easy to put down.
It should have been any of the rest of them, and the siren had tried. She went after Sam as the medical examiner (because of course she did; coincidence, Dean’s ass - this case had way too many callbacks) tough and smart and sweet, with a nerdy fascination for old books and a story about a haunting she’d seen as a little girl to explain why she was open-minded and willing to roll with their weirdness. And Sam, too guilt-ridden and self-loathing after Eileen and Rowena, had shut down every advance.
He knows Sam and Eileen are worried. Jody and Donna are worried. Jack gives him a wide berth most of the time, even now, and Dean and Cas are caught in this tense holding pattern, like the pressure drop before the storm breaks. Dean feels like everyone’s waiting for him to snap or do
“Mhmmm,” Cas says, unconvinced, but he settles down in the other armchair next to Dean as Dean presses play. Cas is still in the suit coat, but he’s shed the trenchcoat and he’s leaning in, stealing Dean’s popcorn, the way he does every time they do this, not because he likes the taste, but because it’s “part of the experience.”
Maybe wanting to be worthy of that kind of devotion has always been a lot of pressure and vaguely incomprehensible, somehow both more and less than he wanted, and way more than he deserved. So just for a moment, just long enough for Dean to torch his own life, it had made a sick and desperate kind of sense that it might all be Chuck’s game, in the end.
Cas tilts his head in an echo of the way he used to look at Dean when he didn’t get a reference or was trying to work out why the weird humans say the things they say, but there’s something so raw in his eyes that Dean has to be the one to look away. “For what?” Cas asks, like a dare, and waits.
The rift sizzles and spits, like water on a flame, a jagged red scar cut through the room, bleeding unnatural light. Dean can feel the heat it’s giving off from here.
He wonders if this is how Dean felt in the dungeon, watching their history rewritten and illuminated. Only for him, that new possibility was immediately snuffed out. The thought makes him ache; there’s a little thread of guilt running through it, but that’s not important now. What’s important now is the time they have, here, together.
“But I do know you’re right. After everything, that last case, not being able to protect him, it was harder than I thought it would be. I keep feeling like I should have known somehow. Like I missed something big.”
That’s Dean’s main takeaway from this case. That, and just when you think it’s safe to go back in the water, that’s when you end up dashed against the rocks.
“Yes, it was like suddenly she mattered more than anything. I knew it wasn’t like that before. I knew she was probably the siren, but everything she said made so much sense. I’d have done anything to make her happy. Part of me liked the way it felt.”
like some demon bullshit, for sure. There have been five murders already, like a chain reaction, something jumping from person to person - one perpetrator is the next victim, the next perpetrator is always someone who was at or near the scene. The current guy’s in custody, but so was the last one, so Dean wouldn’t put money on that doing any good.
Sam’s a little twitchy in the passenger seat; he opens his mouth likes he’s going to say something and then closes it again. Keeps checking his phone.
And sure. Dean knew that. Because why would Cas ever pass up a chance for misguided self-sacrifice, but he’s also damn sure that he can’t - he really
, he’s keeping it together because he has to, because the only way out is through, until he meets Jack’s eyes, wide and shocky where Jack is hovering behind Sam’s chair.
, and isn’t that surprising - but right now he just wants Cas against his lips and under his hands, moving relentlessly between his thighs.
There are some things Castiel has been trying not to think too hard about, since Purgatory - how Dean is committed to demonstrating that he trusts him, how hard Dean is
He wakes first in the morning to Cas’s fingers curled over his hip, and he lies there for a moment, just breathing, before the smell of coffee calls him to the kitchen and he leaves Cas asleep.
He should have known better than to try to sleep the night before the big fight. It wasn’t his first last night on Earth, but he’d never really been able to relax on the cusp on something like that. There were too many what-ifs in his head - all the ways it could go wrong, and the uncertainty of what would happen if it actually went right.
Dean shrugs. If the rumors are weirder than the truth then he doesn’t really want to know what people are saying. “Honestly, probably. It’s been a weird decade, man, I don’t know what to tell you.”
It’s not so different, except that everything is different. He was over and he was done, and he was at peace, and now.  Well, now here he is, alive and breathing with the rhythm of his own heart heavy in stillness.
Cas stiffens with a sharp breath and rubs a hand over his face. “I don’t want to fight with you,” he says, more softly, and walks out of the room, leaving Dean to wonder what the
place. They’ve been in-sync with each other; the old warmth and trust is back. Cas proved that when he brought Jack straight to them after Jack showed up again and Dean, despite some reservations and the still throbbing ache of grief over Mary, has done everything he can to prove that trust is justified and reciprocated, for both Cas’ sake and Jack’s.
“I mean, not tomorrow. I figure eventually you gotta get back on the horse, right? Just...carefully.”
“Dean,” he says, and waits until Dean looks at him. “For what it’s worth - that day at the portal. Confronted with a situation like that now, I would make a very different choice.” He doesn’t say “I’m sorry,” because he’s not, exactly. He’d done the best he could at the time, and other than protecting Dean, penance had seemed like the only right option. It had seemed like
something, Cas is right there. Water, pain killers, escape from the hum of the rest of the bunker, quiet company - Cas is right there, always, but he’s distant too.  Their banter falls flat, silences stretch a little too long and thin; there’s just a gap, something too hesitant and pained in the way Cas looks at him and then looks away.
“They spring up when Leviathans die. Not right away, but within a few hours. Leviathan blood and Purgatory soil, I don’t know. I didn’t think much about it at the time, running for both our lives and all that. But. What else could it be?”
Dick laughs. “Two against…” He looks behind him, seeming to count, and then shrugs. “A lot. And some vampires in the trees behind you. I like the odds.”
“Really? We can drag Dean over here and I’ll get a ride out of here in his arm. We’ll get this done however we need.”
Seeing Cas out of layers always knocks Dean back a step, and he feels particularly unprepared tonight.
He found Cas in the library, as usual, pouring over the lore, as if there was even a possibility there was something they missed, as if there was a book left they hadn’t read cover to cover a dozen times.
. Maybe all of their cards aren’t on the table, but this is an acknowledgement that they both know what kind of hand the other is holding.
They spend the next week in Rhinelander, resting and pumping Cas full of antibiotics. They move to a different motel with a kitchenette so they can eat something other than diner burgers and Dean can make sure Cas stays hydrated.
They step through the portal, the quick static shock of if giving way to the sharp chill of Purgatory. It's colder than Castiel remembers, but he should have expected that. He’s come to understand angelic grace as a kind of insulation that dulls physical sensation and creates a half-step remove from human emotion. He’d thought he was pretty in touch with his feelings, for an angel and all things considered, but now, with what’s left of his grace flickering like a candle flame, everything from cold to emotion to the passage of time feels dizzyingly personal and immediate in a way he hasn’t felt since his brief brush with humanity.
“Fallen angel, huh? That always seemed like the most far fetched part of the story. I thought my life was weird.”
“No,” Dean says, sharply. His eyes meet Castiel’s and there’s something wild there. “No,” he says more quietly. “I’m going to talk now. And yes, I do have to say something.” He swallows hard. “Apparently I have to say a lot.”
“Great,” she says, nodding decisively. “Here’s my card.” She points at Cas. “You come back tomorrow. And call me if the infection spreads.”
“I don’t know, boys,” she says, tinny through the cell phone speaker. “No hex bags; no other signs of ritual. It sounds like it shares a lot of the symptoms of the attack dog spell, but for someone to do a spell of that magnitude over distance with nothing to ground it and make it contagious? That would take a lot of raw power, and we’re talking naturally occurring raw power. I don’t see how anyone operating on borrowed power or a deal could have that kind of strength left. Do you know how it spreads?”
“Dean,” Sam says, sitting down across from him at the table. “What happened?” When Dean looks up, he recognizes the stoic and haunted look in Sam’s eyes, braced for another blow.  Sam, who lost Eileen, who watched their friends snuffed out, who drove back to the bunker through an empty world already guessing what he would find. Maybe Sam is the strong one, after all.
He staggers to his feet, unsteady. Reaching for his grace leaves him dizzy and winded. It’s there, faint and buzzing, but out of reach.
“No, it's okay. We’ll be fine.” Sam hesitates, and then - “I am going to take Jack, though. But you need to stay here, so that Cas will stay here.”
“I like him, your guy,” Jesse says, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye, still something a little questioning in his tone. Not prying, just curious.
“Cas. How can I help?” Dean is trying so hard. Castiel can see the struggle, the part of him that wants to argue, pushed down so that this parting is as gentle as it can be. It makes Castiel ache.
“It’s like drowning in all of the worst parts of yourself, every worst impulse you’ve ever had, and not being able to stop it. I know we’re headed for a shitstorm eventually, and I know we’re going to do what we have to do. There might be some no-win choices coming because that’s how this goes, but here, today? I’m not sorry we’re not going down that road, man.” He huffs a laugh, dry but not entirely without humor. “‘I’m glad you don’t have it, whatever that means for the future. We got Sam and Eileen out safe. So yeah, I think I’m mostly okay.”
