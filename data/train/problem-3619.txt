Cas just stared at him. “You defeated God. And you died from a fall?”
“Come on, Cas, don’t be shy,” Ellen said.
Charlie punched Dean’s arm. “You guys really made the Republic of Heaven, huh?”
“What? ‘S not like I have eyes for you to blind anymore.”
The gravel crunched under their feet as they walked back to Baby, shoulder to shoulder.
“This hasn’t been home in years,” Cas said wistfully. “I’d much rather—”
“Well, I approve,” Charlie said with gusto. “You know, while it was happening, I didn’t mind reliving Charlie Bradbury’s greatest hits over and over again, but in hindsight? Kind of terrifying! This is much better.”
“So we’re both idiots,” Dean said.
“And he topped up your grace, too, looks like,” Dean said, leaning back and going cross-eyed in an effort to glance at Cas’s wings. They crowded closer to Cas’s shoulders in response, hiding, almost.
“Cas,” he’d said. “You got your ears on?”
They were quiet for a moment, looking at each other.
Charlie nodded seriously. “Fair.”
She ran out in front of the car, waving her arms, like there was some way for him not to spot her. Muffled through Baby’s chassis, the rumble of her engine, just the faintest hint of her voice called, “Dean!”
just over the next hill. And there were other cars parked in front, now, and the door to one of them was opening, slamming shut. Dean caught a glimpse of red hair, glinting in the sun.
After getting into the Impala and leaving Bobby to his nice view and beer cooler, Dean had only driven for a short while before pulling over. The sounds of the wilderness around him had filtered in slow, once he’d killed the engine: birds singing in the treetops, a raven calling out far away. Somewhere, a stream, babbling in a bright, carefree voice. Dean had put his hands together and cleared his throat, a crease appearing between his eyebrows as he closed his eyes.
Heat rushed into Dean’s cheeks, like he was some sort of goddamn teenage girl with a crush. “Yeah,” he said gruffly. “What, am I out of practice?”
“Do you want to?”
“Dean, what are you— Oh.”
“Biblical Apocalypse,” Jo said.
“Nah, I’m good,” Dean replied. “Still just… trying to wrap my head around everything.”
“Good.”
“No.”
“Yeah, well, there’s no place like home, is there.”
Cas’s footsteps crunched up behind them, but she didn’t let go.
“No, no I’m not. You promised to be my personal taxi service, remember?”
“To new beginnings!” Jo said.
Cas accepted that. His eyes shifted away, back to stare out over the ravine.
“Cas! Cas—you’re okay.” An incredulous, choked noise that was half laughter, half something else, bubbled up into Dean’s throat, past his lips, as he skidded to a stop just in front of Cas. It was too unreal to get any closer. “You’re okay! Is it. It’s really you, right?”
“Everyone,” Cas said. “Do you want to see them?”
“Okay. Roadhouse. Rooooadhouse. Come on, brain, take us to the Roadhouse.”
Cas looked dumbstruck. “Dean?”
“Your mom says hi by the way,” Bobby said. “Couldn’t make it just yet, but she wants you to swing by as soon as you can.”
“Where you really want to go,” Cas said. “Not just what you say you want. Those two are sometimes very different, I’ve learned.”
“I can’t believe we just missed you the last time you were up here,” Jo complained.
“Your vessel is still gone, so, I mean on that point, it’s not like you can go home any more than I can.”
“Chuck had no influence there, but Jack isn’t him,” Cas explained. “He has the power of both the Darkness and the Light, and his own as an archangel nephilim to boot. He put the Shadow back to sleep in exchange for my essence. Honestly, I think it was just happy to be done with me.”
“As a matter of fact, it was!”
Dean was. He was straddling Cas’s lap. Just, like. Fully. He couldn’t sit up straight because if he did, his head would hit the ceiling. Because he was practically on top of Cas.
“Warden, huh? Tell me again how this isn’t jail.”
Dean snapped his fingers. “Right, where’s Ash?”
“Ellen! Jo!”
“Old school. Nice.”
“I know at that point, I’d be looking to straight-up retire,” Dean said, and thought he did a pretty good job matching the light tone from earlier, before he gave himself an existential crisis with information he already knew. When he was already dead, and the whole existential ship had kind of already sailed.
“I wasn’t made for this. I was created to be a, a soldier, not a soul warden.”
“You didn’t think I could hear it. I tried not to listen.”
“Oh, you know,” Dean said and shrugged. “Deposing God, killing Death, ending destiny. The usual crap.”
“Retire.”
Cas grabbed his forearm. “Stop that.”
Except, well. Dean could reach across and take Cas’s hand. And it wouldn’t be weird. And Cas would let him. Cas would like it.
not done with
“Oh. Cool.”
Dean stood up. At his expression, Cas’s eyes crinkled again. “Ellen?”
Despite what Bobby had said about people being just “over yonder,” the Roadhouse seemed to be surrounded by miles and miles and miles of just forest. There was nothing but trees and this inexplicably well-maintained gravel road, meandering through the wilderness. It led, as far as Dean could tell, to nowhere. At the same time, it seemed to go on forever. Granted, he hadn’t been driving along it for very long, but while it had never doubled back on itself or cheated in some other way, Dean still got the sense that if he started Baby back up, he’d run into Bobby again if he just went over that hilltop.
Cas tilted his head at her, puzzled, but didn’t comment. He seemed resigned to the fact that she wasn’t going to start making sense any time soon.
And, also, it was Cas. Cas always had his back.
The live wire sparked through him all the way down into his toes. It felt like his heart was going to burst out of his chest.
“Wait.” Charlie looked around, taking in their surroundings: the Roadhouse, the trees, the distant, snow-capped mountains. “That’s why everything’s different now!” She snapped her fingers. “I should’ve known it was you guys. But where’s Sam?”
It was Cas’s turn to let out a small “oomph”, Charlie attacking him next. Like the last time they’d met, he looked a little bewildered at the hug, but not as much, and his hand lowered to pat her on the back. He seemed almost as pleased as Charlie, something warm and fond in his expression.
Dean didn’t look back, but after a few moments, and what he could have sworn was a muttered curse under Cas’ breath and then he was following Dean, just behind him and at his left shoulder. Dean felt like a live wire, all raw nerves and no stimulation. He felt like a walking, talking bruise.
“Tell me how to help you, Dean,” Cas said, and it was a command. “Tell me what you want.” Dean sucked in a sharp breath. Cas had commanded things of him before, and it had always rubbed Dean the wrong way. Now, though? He’d fucking sing like a canary and do a jig if it meant that Cas would keep telling him what to do.
He paused, looked up at Dean. “Sit back down,” he said. “You’ll be more comfortable.”
to do something else. That had been a concentrated effort, and he wasn’t sure that he could do it again. Dean had a sudden image of Cas flinging him over his shoulder and toting him around like a sack of potatoes. “Please don’t carry me around like a sack of potatoes,” he mumbled, and Cas peered down at him, squinting his eyes even further, as if trying to figure out what Dean meant. Dean thought it made perfect sense.
The pleasure that had been growing heavy at the base of Dean’s stomach unspooled suddenly, washing through his body, and Dean tossed his head back, shouted Cas’ name as loud as he fucking
A smile crinkled the corners of Cas’s eyes. “I did,” he admitted, all quiet and soft.
For every kiss, that lightning storm feeling inside Dean’s chest faded a little bit more. He didn’t know if he missed it or not, but it wasn’t like he was going to stop kissing Cas. He wasn’t ever going to stop doing that.
“And change,” Cas agreed placidly.
They could hold it for about half a second. Then they were both smiling. Like dorks.
“Screw you. It was heroic, that’s what it was.”
“Sam’s still alive,” Dean said. “And if he doesn’t stay that way for a very long time, I’m going to kill him.”
“Is that why everything’s… different?” Jo asked, carefully. “’Cause I can’t really remember, but I know it wasn’t…” She trailed off. “Like this. Before.”
That drew a chuckle, a shift in his wings.
“Time, good friends, handsome angels?” Cas honest to God blushed, and hell yeah, it had been so worth it, spending the last ten minutes hyping himself up for that. “Doesn’t sound so bad.”
Dean pulled into an empty spot and had barely turned the key to kill the engine before he was out the door. Charlie was still standing in the middle of the parking lot, just off to the side of Baby’s tire marks in the gravel, grinning like a loon.
Dean had been wrong. The Roadhouse wasn’t just over the hill. They drove and drove and drove, and there was still just forest.
“Well, it’s like you said. You’ve got time. That’s what Heaven is.”
As a rule, angels didn’t have very active imaginations, which had been one of the reasons for the carefully cordoned-off cubby holes of the past. But Jack had brought forward the idea of sourcing environments from the souls themselves, and from there, it had pretty much been smooth sailing. After all, it hadn’t been too different from building personal little Heavens out of specific memories, and the new generation of angels, guided by the older ones, had been eager to get to work. And there was plenty for them to do.
“Sounds familiar,” Jo drawled. When Dean glowered at her, she winked.
“Well, duh,” Charlie said and rolled her eyes. “We’re in Heaven, dude.”
“Speaking of—what are you guys doing here? Well, I mean, I know the general mechanism by which people end up here, but being dead kinda puts you out of the loop a bit and it’s sort of driving me crazy, so. What’s going on?”
“In Heaven?” Cas didn’t open his eyes. “With all the things I’d done… I never thought I’d return.”
“Living forever. Is this—“ He gestured to the river below them, Heaven at large. “—what it feels like?”
“Jack brought me back from the Empty and restored me. You’re stuck in Heaven.”
want to?” Cas said.
Dean shook his head. “That goes for both of us, I think.”
Cas blinked.
noise as the air escaped, and pushed it across the counter toward Dean.
“Yeah,” he murmured, a thumb at Cas’s bottom lip. Cas’s eyes were blue, blue, blue with joy and warmth and affection. “Not too shabby at all.”
Blue eyes shifted away. “I heard your scream. It… woke me. Jack, he heard it, too.”
Empty-Cas let out a bark of laughter. Dean hated the sound. It was nothing close to the  low chuckle he was used to. “Castiel made a deal with me. He’s mine.”
“Can we get there, then?” he asked, drawing a laugh from Cas. Jack nodded and resumed his role as officiant.
“Beyond eternity itself,” Cas agreed, looking down at his husband.
Suddenly, Cas was there and running his hands down Dean’s chest, his breath teasing Dean’s lips with his whispered praise of “Beautiful.” It was said with a note of reverence.
Ash and Charlie had paired up to play DJ for the night, though they were glowering at each other’s choices more than actually working together. Ellen and Jo were behind the bar, slinging drinks at a mad pace. Rufus and Bobby had taken up space in a booth and had begun arguing about an old case while Aretha freaking’ Franklin and Karen, Bobby’s wife, sat next to them with exasperated expressions. Sam and Eileen were dancing together to their own music. Gabriel and Jess had bonded in their love-Sam-from-afar similarities and were busy working on getting as drunk as they could, as fast as they could. Balthazar and some other angels that Dean wasn’t familiar with were in their own pow-wow on the other side of the bar. They looked like they were having a good time, at least.
“Fuck. Oh fuck, yes. Cas. We need to…. Ohh,” Dean panted, as Cas began to roll their hips together, their hard arousals shifting against each other through the fabric of their clothes.
The Roadhouse was a madhouse. They had gotten past the awkward speeches and first dances and a delicious dinner. All that was left was to let loose and have fun.
The darkness around him was disorienting. He couldn’t tell what was up or down, forward or behind. He wasn’t even sure he was standing. He could have been laying. Or floating, even.
The responding “Jerk,” was a welcome sound. It had been too long since the brothers had exchanged their favorite affectionate insults for each other.
“Why, Dean? Don’t you know how dangerous… how stupid that was?”
Bitch-Face Number 46 came out at the comment. Surprisingly, that helped calm his frayed nerves. Something normal, so familiar, when everything else about this was uncharted territory to him. He breathed out slowly, letting his shoulders relax from their tensed position. Sam gave his back a pat of approval.
They spent the day pouring over old books. Dean felt a flame of happiness start in him while they talked and joked. It felt almost like before – when it was just them, searching for their dad. A distant memory of simpler times and less worries.
He tried to open his eyes. Nothing.
Sammy had offered to help with research that afternoon. Dean didn’t notice the entrance until a large hand was placed on his shoulder. He wasn’t sure if he had been too lost in his reading or if his brother was moving that quietly.
It was a good day – because he felt numb.
To saving Cas.
“You made a deal. Again,” his voice dropped with venom. Cas stepped away completely. The increased space and the idea of losing Cas again was too much. The words poured out his mouth in an angry fit, “How could you make another deal, Cas? How many times at—“
“Do you, Dean Michael Winchester, take Castiel as your husband, from this day onward?” Jack questioned, barely getting it out before Dean was answering with a hurried ‘I do.’
“Fuck, Cas. We… We gotta go.”
He felt Cas’ weight shift on the bed behind him. Hands dragged down his back, slow and heavy, until they reached the curve of his ass. Cas palmed the soft flesh before spreading his cheeks.
Help.
“Cas,” Dean sighed back, trying to catch the lips that were so close and achingly far away. Cas grazed over Dean’s lips with his own, but didn’t give Dean what he wanted. Instead, he began to work downward with the same light kisses Dean’s lips had received.
Dean didn’t bother to hide his emotions from Sam, as he might have done before. Relief, guilt, excitement, nervousness, happiness, sadness. He was jumping all over the map, unsure of where his final mental and emotional state was going to land.
He already had plans.
Dean had woken up feeling different that morning. The ache in his chest was still there, but it had dulled. He noticed that his hand wasn’t shaking when he added to the daily tally.
As fast as it had began, the torture ended. He collapsed as the creature released him. He might have vomited. He had no strength or will left in him. He should try to escape, but he can’t move yet.
He swallowed, urging that thought to leave his head. He couldn’t pop a boner here, in the middle of all his family and friends. “Sure, Angel,” he managed to answer back.
Despite having come minutes earlier, Dean felt himself start to harden again. His own voice abandoned him, so he settled for nodding his approval. Cas rolled his hips against him once again, letting Dean feel every bit of his arousal, before he stepped away and moved to the passenger door.
“Holy fuck, Cas,” Dean managed to say through his own jagged breaths.
“Do it. Claim me, Angel,” Dean agreed eagerly. ”Only yours.”
He didn’t hear Sam’s next words, but he knew by the grin and the excited movements that Sam was making that Dean’s search was over.
He couldn’t stand at all, actually. He felt the impact of his body hitting the concrete floor more than he saw it. The shockwave of pain that shot through him was different than the one in his chest.
Cas was relentless. He drilled into Dean with a speed and force that left the hunter drooling and incoherent. His muscles contracted tight against Cas’ cock. Dean felt the tight coil that signaled he was close.
The bitter disappointment was overwhelming. He thought he remembered that Cas had taken him out of the Empty, had come with him. Apparently not. He’d imagined it all.
A tilt of the head was his invitation to continue.
His eyes shot open as he remembered… everything.  He sat up, searching for the blue eyes angel. No one was with him.
It was barely a whisper, but it roared in Dean’s ears.
“Don’t stop, gonna come. Fuck. Fuck. Cas, make me come, baby. Wanna come on your cock so bad.”
Once spent, he collapsed onto the naked back below him, panting heavily.
“You’re perfect, Dean. So beautiful like this, ready for me to claim you,” he purred.
After that, he couldn’t hold it together any longer. Losing Cas had been hard enough. Essentially losing Jack right after felt like a shot to the gut. The final hit was when Sam had found Eileen.
He wasn’t sure who moved first. They could have started at the same time. It wasn’t the rushed reunion that he had pictured. They came together slowly.
As Cas wound the recap of the previous few days down, he paused unexpectedly. He searched Dean’s face for something. Dean didn’t known if he found it. Cas looked away from him.
It turned its back on Dean, done with the human.
They wasted no time getting into their house. Dean shoved Cas into the door as he closed it, claiming his mouth in a frenzied kiss. Cas pulled at Dean’s clothes impatiently, ripping a few buttons from the white dress shirt he was wearing. Dean didn’t even notice, busy with his own hurried attempt to rid Cas of his pants.
The hunter rolled his eyes. “Funny. Keep that up, and I’ll be asking for a divorce.”
It was Dean’s turn to fight back tears. It was so much more than the speech about how he felt. It was a promise that went far beyond Dean’s idea of marriage. It was a promise to the universe, infinite and powerful.
For the first time since The Day, he smiled. He was close to finding the answer, he knew it. His gut told him that today would be an
Instead, he felt himself become impatient as the figures walked toward him at a much slower pace than he would have liked. It felt like each step forward took a lifetime.
Jack moved to hug Dean, his own smile glowing brightly, before he continued on his way. Dean’s gaze swung to the second figure, raking in the sight before. The maroon suit was perfectly tailored to the toned body, dark hair that was perpetually tousled, full lips that had a smile playing at the edges, and a sea of the bluest eyes in all of Creation.
That was the day that he sent his first prayer to Cas. That was the day he had promised to find a way to get his best friend back. That was the day that he was going to follow his own heart, like he should done so many years ago. He wasted too much time.
He raised his hand to Cas’ face and brought their foreheads together. His closed his eyes and took in that moment. The soft skin against his, the warm breaths hitting his face, the smell of his own soap coming from Cas’.
Cas’ predatory grin made a shiver go down his spine.
After he had taken a moment to be by himself, he inhaled a deep breath and walked back to the party, surrounded almost immediately by well-wishers. As much as he loved them, they were all slightly overwhelming, and hard to shake.
“Yeah? Give me Cas and I’ll be on my way,” he managed to get out smoothly, laying on as much charm as he could. His hand held his still-sheathed knife handle tightly. He really hoped he didn’t get into a one-on-one with this thing.
With a chuckle, the angel left for a moment to grab the lube from the bedside table. Dean heard the squirt of the lube and felt the cold wetness of a digit at his entrance.
A blush spread across Cas’ face, but he didn’t say anything. Dean was about to take back the question when Cas told him.
What was taking so long? He should have seen at least movement by now, right?
What if –
He had not marked today on his list. Before the end of it, he planned to have Cas home and light the damn list in flames.
There was a million and ten ways this could go sideways. Dean worried about them briefly and dismissed them all.
Dean felt tears start to roll down his face. He had failed. Not only did he get himself seriously messed up and piss of another super-powered being, he also didn’t save Cas. He failed him.
“Go, before I change my mind. I don’t want to you or your little pet here
Cas slammed his hips against Dean’s ass, his movements becoming uncoordinated as he neared his own release. He let go with a roar, emptying himself into Dean’s ass.
“I misunderstand? Care to elaborate?”
If they weren’t out that door in five seconds, Dean swore he was going to burn the building to the ground.
“Hey, Cas.”
Dean’s hand shook slightly as he made the small tally mark that counted the days. Ninety seven small, uneven black lines mocked him, reminded him of how badly he had failed one of the most important people in his life. Ninety seven days without Cas – leaving him stuck in the Empty, suffering. He felt his stomach roll and a tightness start to bloom in his chest. He closed his eyes against the swell of panic and shame that was brewing inside him.
Help.
He nodded before continuing, “We were able to come to…. An agreeable arrangement with the Empty.”
The book had taken days to translate. By Sam’s understanding, the Key was to be used in a Place of Importance. There were instructions for a complex spell that Dean didn’t understand one bit of to get the location.
“Cas, please,” Dean begged. How could he stand it? Dean was losing his damned mind, and he’d been satisfied once ready. The angel was somehow not only holding himself together, but making Dean fall apart.
“What if nothing. It’s all going to go like planned. You have to stop freaking out. You know that, short of an apocalypse, nothing is going to stand in the way of this,” his brother said, moving his hand to Dean’s shoulder.
Dean leaned down to kiss Cas again. It was slow, sweet, and perfect.
Beyond eternity sounded good to Dean.
The hissed whisper broke through the worry that had been speeding around in Dean’s head. He looked over at Sam with wide eyes. Sammy smiled gently back, saying without words that he understood what was happening in his mind. Dean tried to smile back. It came out more as a grimace than as the grin he had intended it to be.
Cas needed to come home first.
The thing before him tilted its head curiously. The Empty pulled it off well.  It was a gesture that Dean had seen before countless times from the real Cas. He’d missed it, he realized.
“Oh. Are you okay? That’s big, Cas. Really big.” Another nod. Cas was giving him time to work through it.
It just didn’t matter.
“Later. Right now, I want to get you into our bed and make you lose control as I open you up, to feel you under me as I slide into you. I want to make you mine in every way possible.”
He screamed. Forty years in Hell had nothing on this. He could feel the darkness around him closing in, ready to absorb him into the nothing.
The nip of teeth was even more surprising than the tongue had been. Dean arched his back, letting out a harsh breath. Cas nibbled at his hips and down to his thighs through the satin. Dean was writhing, wishing Cas would stop teasing and just touch him already, but also not wanting the slow torture to end. When Cas finally settled his mouth over the painfully hard erection, Dean let out a strangled yell and jerked his hips upwards. The material of the underwear became wet under Cas’s hot open-mouthed kisses. Dean’s movements were uncontrolled, searching for more relief as the angel continued to tease him through the fabric.
Dean licked his lips wondering was he was planning with a look like that... “Should I take them off?” He asked.
Eventually, he had moved. The world had still kept spinning, his brother and Jack had been waiting, and Chuck had still needed to be dealt with.
“Yeah, I get that,” he replied slowly. “Look, I do. A deal is a deal. What about a new deal?”
“Okay, so no one that has ever met me would say I’m awesome at words, so don’t expect a masterpiece here…” he started, earning a chuckle from his angel, brother, and the majority of the guests in attendance. “I’m still trying to tell my brain that we’re actually here, actually doing this. It’s still trying to process the idea that I can actually call you mine. We took a long time to get to this point – took the scenic route, got lost a bunch, and then died a few times for good measure, before we were able to find our way to our destination: here and now, and forever. You literally saved me, Cas. I mean, you pulled me from Hell before I even knew you. I can’t believe that I’m actually thankful I went there because I wouldn’t have met you otherwise. And you kept saving me, keeping me upright through everything we’ve been through – which, if you don’t remember, is a whole freaking’ lot. You’re my guardian angel, my savior, my best friend, and I can’t wait to be able to add ‘husband’ to that list.”
His hand stayed steady when he added another line to the page. The panic didn’t rear up in his chest as he thought about the ever increasing number. His eyes didn’t sting with the threat of tears and the walls weren’t closing in on him.
He was speechless. How had he been so oblivious for so long? He was a blind, stupid asshole. Thank goodness or whatever that he didn’t miss the chance completely.
Thankfully, the eons that he guessed had passed since the music had begun finally ended, with two of the most important people to Dean reaching him at last. He beamed as he watched the two embrace one another.
The grip of panic loosened with each word. Praying to Cas, he had found, was the best way to stop an oncoming breakdown. He didn’t know if the angel could even hear him, but he hoped like hell that he was getting through. Cas needed to know that he wasn’t giving up. Dean didn’t care how long the search might take or what the end cost will be.
“I haven’t returned the favor yet, angel.”
Agonizingly slow.
Dean waited. His leg started to bounce uncontrollably. The hairs at the back of his neck stood on end. Had they actually found
good day.
He reveled in it – the change from emotional to physical pain. Physical pain he could handle. The other… He didn’t know if he could take it.
Dean was frozen, unsure of what to do. His heart was beating so fast. He could feel it trying to escape his chest. The rapid thumping filled his head.
“Dean,” Cas said in a low, no-nonsense voice, “You misunderstand.”
Everywhere Dean looked, he saw those he loved, those he had lost, and those he had missed. It was perfect. He wished he could have had others with him, like Jody, Donna, Claire, and Alex or Garth and his family, but he was beyond thrilled to be able to share the day with the ones he had.
Dean’s mouth had kind of spit out the age thing without consulting his brain, which now was spinning out completely, trying to picture that the guy sitting next to him was, well. That old. The age of the freaking universe. He’d been aware of it for as long as they’d known each other, of course. It kinda came free with the whole angel thing. But he hadn’t thought about it, really thought about it, until just now. Now that he could see Cas like he actually was.
“You back in the good graces of the powers that be or what’s going on? Thought you were banned from upstairs for life.”
The heavy sound of angel wings broke his heart. Cas was standing there, up ahead on the dusty gravel road, in his trenchcoat and suit and blue, off-kilter tie. He looked sad, and tired, and a little afraid.
Dean stopped the car.
“Busy beaver, that one,” Ellen said. “No idea what he's up to or where he is, but he’ll turn up at some point. He always does.”
Cas was still smiling, looking at Dean. “I’m right where I wanna be,” he said, and okay. Okay. That sure was something Cas could say, to Dean, right here. Right now.
“Your highness!” Dean said, and let out a soft noise of surprise as Charlie’s bird-boned body collided with his.
The relief had a half-life measured in seconds.
The ravine was like nothing Dean had ever seen before. It ran for longer than he could see, a deep crack in the mountainside that exposed the gray rock inside, contrasted it against the deep green of the surrounding forest. The broad, lazy river that had carved it flowed past far, far down below their feet, the stillness of its surface belying the force of its current. Every so often, a stray ray of sunlight would catch in a ripple and produce a stunning flash of silver or blue.
He tried to move. Nothing.
Cas ran a hand down Dean’s spine. Teeth nipped at the material of the panties, inching the satin down slowly, until it was pulled below the curve of his ass, the front pulled tight against his cock.
He hit the hay covered barn floor hard. He moaned from the pain that still swept across his body. He could hear a commotion around him, someone calling his name, shaking him, touching him. He tried to tell them to stop but no words came out.
“Shh, patience,” Cas cooed the word again, his breath hot on his hole. Dean let out a low moan at the sensation. Cas blew gently at him, causing his hips to jerk wantonly.
He wasn’t sure why this barn held more significance to Cas, especially when they had met in a completely different barn. Only fighting had happened here.
“Would you dance with me, Dean?” he asked, his voice taking on a low rumble that made another type of dance pop into his head.
“Cas, c’mon already,” Dean pleaded.
He wasn’t numb. He wasn’t panicked, either. Something new was bouncing around inside of him. A feeling that he hadn’t had in a very long time.
The soft touches combined with the rough scrape of Cas’ stubble sent Dean’s brain into meltdown. He was writhing by the time Cas reached the line of satin at his hips.
He should have been happy for them. His baby brother was in love, moving in with his girlfriend, and had a real chance at a happy future. He should have been elated for Sammy.
He tried to transmit to anyone who might be able to read him.
Dean took Cas’ hand in his, squeezing tightly as Jack started, “We’re gathered here today…”
He had managed to keep himself composed while they brought down Chuck and found their people safely returned from wherever Chuck had sent them.
Thankfully, he didn’t have to wait long. Cas had lost his clothing before he reached the bedroom. He stilled as he caught sight of Dean. A sharp inhale sounded through the room as his blue eyes roamed over Dean’s freckled body, over the white laced sides of the panties and the way the satin contoured around the cock and balls it held. When his gaze settled at the leaking head that was visible above the panty line, he let out a guttural moan.
“Fuck, baby. I’m gonna come. Make me come, I wanna come for you. Cas, baby,” he let out, thrusting his hips forward. Cas hummed around him, sending the vibrations to his core, and picked up the speed. Dean moved, pounding into Cas’ willing mouth. Faster, faster. Faster. And then suddenly, his body let go, spilling down his husband’s throat. Cas swallowed as much as he could, letting what he couldn’t dribble out down his chin. Goddamned, if that wasn’t one of the sexiest sights Dean had ever seen…
“What? No, you’re fine. Okay, first, you’re human now?” Cas nodded.
Dean didn’t think he’d ever driven Baby as recklessly as he did in his rush to get home. Cas hadn’t touched him through the entire drive, simply stared, raking his intense eyes over Dean with unsaid promises, and rubbing a hand against the bulge in his pants occasionally. It was a short drive, but by the time they pulled up to the wood cabin, Dean was shaking with how insanely turned on he was.
“What if –“ he started, only to be cut off by Sam reaching out to grasp the hand that had been fidgeting with the black tie around his neck. Startled, Dean relinquished his hold on the material. He hadn’t even realized he’d been clawing at it.
Sam turned it over in his hands, inspecting it carefully. “‘
From the new position, he ran a hand over Dean’s well-fucked frame, stopping at the feel of the white satin. He hummed, caressed Dean’s hip, before he snapped his fingers and made the cum-soaked panties disappear, leaving Dean bare except for Cas above him.
However, Castiel had other ideas. The wet tongue running across the top of the panties had Dean gasping. When the tongue lifted to avoid the tip of his cock, he thought he might cry. The tongue ran along the other hip, catching the skin above the line at times. Dean felt like he was being burnt by the wet trail left behind.
Instead, he felt himself shatter. His family was gone. He felt completely alone.
appeared.
He had no idea how long it was going to take him get through the daunting collection. He had no idea how much longer that meant for Cas.
The words were ones that anyone had heard at a wedding before. Jack had been too nervous to want to go ‘off script’ and Dean hadn’t cared one bit what words were said to get them married, as long as they got the job done.
He could feel Cas’ presence behind him. He glanced back. Cas was kneeling behind him, so close but not touching him, staring at Dean with lust-blown eyes. His hand, the one that had just been fucking Dean, was wrapped around his own lube-slicked cock, jerking slowly.
“More,” he choked out. He was shaking. When the mouth was replaced with hands clawing at his buttons and pulling him out, he could have cried. There was no teasing now. Dean was swallowed to the base in one swift movement.
Apparently, Cas didn’t agree. He reached down to take Dean’s ass in his hands, jerking him forward to feel how hard he was for Dean already.
One of the blob-like figures came toward him. Dean was able to make out the billow of tan fabric as it moved closer. He flinched away from it as it touched his face. He knew he wasn’t going to survive another attack from the Empty. There was no way he could.
“Mm,” Cas hummed, nuzzling at the material. “No, I’m already down here… Let me take care of that for you, love.”
Just before release, the fingers retreated.  Dean let out a sound of distress at the lost contact.
He was trying so hard to find answers and hadn’t  found anything more than hints at a ‘key.’ The accounts were vague and pretty much useless. He knew the answer was somewhere in the Bunker’s library. He felt it in his gut. Unfortunately, said library was utterly massive and getting through it was slow work.
“I’ve loved you from the moment I saw you in Hell. Your soul, as broken as it was, shone so bright. I’d never seen another soul like it in all of my very long existence, and I’m quite positive I will never see another like it again. As I rebuilt your body, I had believed that I had gotten to know you, and I loved you. After you were saved, I realized how wrong I had been. I hadn’t known you, not truly. That happened over the years we’ve spent together. You care deeper than any other being. You always put others above yourself, no matter the costs. You never give up, not if there’s still a chance, no matter how small. You are a hero, not only to the world, but to me. We’ve always shared a profound bond, deeper than anything I could have ever imagined. You’re everything. I love you and will always love you, beyond eternity.”
Which might’ve been one of the worst things Dean had ever been told. Holy shit. “I prayed to you, man. Every single day.”
Dean rubbed his neck. “Yeah, you should be thanking Cas for that.”
“Gotta hand it to you, buddy. Hell of a speech.” Bubbles were bursting in the hollow of Dean’s throat, equal parts nerves and joy. He’d done a lot of thinking, these last few weeks after they’d saved the world and Cas had still been dead. Or, well. He’d done no thinking at all, rather. The whole, sorry story had kind of cut through all of his thoughts, all the way down into the wriggling, raw, vulnerable thing hiding behind them. That didn’t mean he wasn’t kind of freaking out, still. “Were you really gonna follow it up with staying in Heaven forever and letting me think you were dead?”
The river flowed past them, quiet, occasional swirls on the surface the sole hint to the force it wielded. As time went by, the ravine would only get deeper. And the river would keep flowing, out into the world with an unknown end, on and on.
When Charlie stepped back, she was a little misty-eyed, but she was smiling again. She sniffled and wiped at her eye with a finger, shaking her head. “Hey.”
“Ya idjits coming or not?” Bobby called. He’d stuck his head out the front door of the Roadhouse, a bottle dangling from one hand.
“We made some changes,” Cas said. “I hope the transition wasn’t too difficult.”
This kind of death, Dean supposed, wasn’t so bad. When it wasn’t the end. Not by a long shot. And not really a beginning, either, the way it had been in Hell. It was just… It just was.
“What do you mean, ‘helped’?” Charlie sniped back. “I was the muscle of the whole damn operation, as I recall.”
“It’s, it’s because you don’t have a body anymore,” Cas tried to explain, which was so not what Dean was going for, here. “Angels touching bare souls—“
As a rule, Cas wasn’t very emotive. Dean had seen him laugh exactly once. Something about him and his vessel not being connected along all sets of wires, Dean had figured a long time ago. Just because his emotions weren’t super accessible didn’t mean he didn’t have them, though, and sussing them out wasn’t all that hard. But right now?
“Hello, Charlie.”
“I know your life’s kinda insane,” Jo said, “but that is not ‘the usual crap.’”
“To new beginnings,” they all chorused.
“Is this what it’s like?” Dean said.
“It doesn’t go on forever if you don’t want it to,” Cas said. “If you go far enough, you’ll find something new.”
Dean couldn’t do it, but he also kinda could. You know. Theoretically.
Cas’s wings came up around them. They were just hints of shadow in the corner of Dean’s eye, the suggestion of something with substance and weight, an aura of power that thrummed in his chest. But as long as he didn’t look directly at them, there were feathers.
Jo matched Dean’s grin as he swept her up into a hug. When they separated, Ellen was smiling at them, too, despite her gruff tone.
“Even so.”
“I think you’ll do great,” Dean said, sitting up a little straighter. The movement dislodged a rush of pebbles, clattering against the cliffside on their way down. Far, far below his feet, too far down to hear the splash when the rocks hit, the river kept murmuring past, moving hundreds of tons of water every second, despite appearing almost perfectly still. If he fell, Cas would catch him. “With this whole soul warden thing.”
“Oh, come on, not even you? If anyone’s put in the work to deserve it, it’s you.”
“I’m happy for you, man. I know you missed it.”
“You were due a career change, man. What, fourteen billion years and change as a soldier?”
Cas puffed up a little at the insult, and it was adorable. “My vessel was destroyed by the Shadow. This is my true form.”
They sat at the bar. Dean nabbed his beer from his old spot, while Ellen passed Charlie a fresh one.
Dean looked away. “Is it good to be back?” he asked, studying the scene below them. On the other side of the ravine, a deer had come down to the water to drink. Cas dominated his peripheral vision.
Ellen, Jo, and Charlie all stared at him. And then Cas, who shrugged. And then Dean.
With his eyes closed, Cas turned his face up toward the sun. His wings moved behind them, splaying to take in the warmth, too. The soft edge of a feather brushed against the small of Dean’s back and sent a zing of electricity sparking through him.
Cas nodded. Dean grinned and slapped him on the back; Cas stumbled forward a few steps, like he’d miscalculated how much—little—of a punch Dean packed now. Dean almost laughed at him, at the bewildered look on his face.
Cas mulled it over for a moment. “I’m not sure if I understand precisely what you mean,” he said, “but I think so.”
For the first time, he was seeing Cas, like, really seeing him. Not filtered through dull human senses, through the containment measure of a vessel, through the inherent limitations of existing in physical space on Earth. Just straight Cas, no hazmat suits necessary.
Six bottles came together with a clink.
“Well, I wanna go to the Roadhouse. Are we at the Roadhouse?”
“You stupid son of a bitch,” he said. “Of course you can have me. Do you know what a goddamn idiot you are?”
His fucking heart was going to burst out of his chest. He was sitting in Baby with his music streaming from the speakers—Cas next to him, Cas alive and well, Cas looking out the window with a quiet, content expression on his face. If Dean concentrated on that, it was almost like normal. Like a normal, really good day. Like they were driving home from a hunt that had gone well, and Cas was happy, and everything was okay.
“I, I dunno.” Dean’s hands clenched against the damp earth underneath him. He looked away, staring out at the ravine. A flock of birds burst from the treetops on the other side, a couple dozen graceful shadows against the white, fluffy clouds, wheeling through the air and singing for joy. Past them, the blue sky went on forever. “I dunno what I wanna do. But I’ve got time, right?”
“It’s exactly the kind of stupid crap we keep doing and not once has it not bit us in the ass! What the hell were you thinking?”
Jo shook her head. “No, no, it’s just… Um. Wow.”
Cas’s shoulders stiffened. “I thought,” he said, still looking out the window, “it was better that way.”
“Hey,” Dean checked, “you can fly again now, right?”
“Ah, no,” Cas said. “It’s built by the collective.”
Cas—pupils blown wide, lips kiss-pink, angel of the frickin’ Lord, amen—stared up at him like he was nothing short of a miracle.
“You’ve got all of eternity,” Cas said.
“Goo monsters! From the dawn of time, with a taste for human flesh.”
Dean got the niggling feeling Cas was not using the general pronoun, but he still sounded so happy, so. That was maybe all right.
“Yeah, because you dying instead was so much better.”
,” Cas said. “What are you doing here so soon?”
“I’m still not done with you,” Dean warned.
And damn if that didn’t hit like a truck. Because this was the real Charlie, his Charlie, and it’d been
Whatever he said, his lips were plush and soft underneath Dean’s, the warmth and wet of his mouth electric. His stubble scraped against Dean’s cheek as they shifted against each other, as Dean climbed closer, and it was dizzying. It was perfect.
“No.”
“I’m good. Just.” He shook his head. “Just kinda spaced out for a sec.”
“Dude,” Dean said, laughter quivering on the exhale, “kissing you’s like making out with a power cable, holy shit.”
“Dean?”
“Yeah, I…” Dean chuckled a little. “I guess we did.”
Dean winced. “I tripped?”
“I can’t believe you were gonna let me think you were dead,” he said again instead.
“Amen to that,” Bobby said and raised his bottle. “Cas, get your ass over here.”
“Let me hear you,” Cas said, out of the blue. Dean looked down at Cas, finding him looking like he was coming apart at the edges, disheveled, bright eyed, two bright spots of color high on his cheeks. Dean let his lips part, let Cas slide the hand that had been digging into his hip up his front to hook a finger into his mouth. Dean made an appreciative noise.
Cas reached forward a third time, and Dean couldn’t find it in him to come up with another excuse for why they shouldn’t be touching; why they shouldn’t have been touching
Cas’ hand fell onto his thigh and Dean almost jumped out of his skin. He opened his mouth to snap
boner.
It wasn’t quite enough friction. “Take us both,” Dean said, his own voice deep and gravelly, as if he’d been sucking on Cas’ cock, after all.
“Sam and I aren’t talking right now,” Dean muttered. “Why’d’you think I’m out here alone?” He pushed himself up.
He could feel Cas’ eyes boring into him, drilling a hole right into his temple as he reached down and slid a hand inside of his pants.
his lips, slid his hand along Cas’ shoulder to cup his neck, Cas shuddered into action, breaking the illusion.
that every touch Cas leaves on him burns just as much as that first touch that left the scar on his body; the one where Cas
And then, as if it caught him off guard, Cas came. He let out a strangled cry, cut off halfway through as if he was embarrassed to be making the noise, and Dean felt the hot slick of come joining the friction between their cocks. He closed his eyes, desire zinging through him, lighting him on
Well, now Dean was fucked, caught out in the middle of nowhere and staring at the personification of everything that felt like forbidden fruit to Dean, and every minutiae of his feelings about Cas was painfully obvious. He’d let this thing

back around his eyes. He’d been… almost human, for lack of a better phrase, when they’d been close, but now Dean could only remember that Cas wasn’t of this world, wasn’t human, and probably would see this as just another experience to soak up about life on Earth.
Dean wanted to reach out and caress Cas’s face like some sort of shitty rom-com.
“You’re distressed,” Cas said, and then he was all up in Dean’s personal space. Dean let out a noise that was definitely
He helped Cas, sliding his zipper down and taking his cock out. His breath caught. In the half-light of the moon, he couldn’t see much, but he could see
As it was, all he could do was make a sound low in his throat as Cas experimentally rolled his hips against Dean’s hand, pressing the line of his cock into Dean’s hand. Dean’s fingers spasmed, and he tried to regulate his breathing. In doing so, he completely lost control of his mouth.
Cas’ fingers skimmed the air before Dean’s face, and the coiled tension between them
“I’m good now, man,” he said, and shoved Cas away before he could do something even stupider, like pull him closer to… to what?
“You’re not sexless, I want you to feel this too,” Dean said, and though it wasn’t phrased as a question, he still waited for an answer from Cas. As if in answer, Cas wordlessly guided Dean’s hand to his lap. Beneath the loose slacks that were entirely too ill-fitting for an Angel of the Lord, Dean felt that Cas—Cas was hard, too.
“You said what you wanted you couldn’t have. Very wrong about that. You can have it, dumbass. You
With a smile, Dean nodded and pulled Cas in for a sweet, slow kiss. “Yeah, okay, as long as you’re also mine for forever too, Castiel Winchester.”.
With the time it had taken them to extract themselves from the bar, they had managed to worked each other into such a heightened state of need, they were both shaking from it.
There was noise everywhere. Screams and howls and chattering bounced around him from unknown directions. It was deafening but almost soundless at the same time. The darkness seemed to be trying to absorb the noise, dampen it – and it was failing.
“Don’t stop, don’t stop. Please, Cas,” he panted, shaking with his want. Cas lifted his head and looked at Dean, grinning before sliding slowly to his knees, letting his hands trail a hot path behind him. “Oh fuck, angel. You look so good like that.”
They separated, yelling goodbyes to the group, which was met with laughter and farewells. Unfortunately, not everyone had gotten the message, and they were delayed several times on their way to the door.
Before he could finish the thought, he saw them. His body relaxed and his breathing returned. Just laying eyes on them was enough to calm his fears.
Cas sat back suddenly, eying the twitching and leaking arousal with dark eyes.
He repeated the gesture, earning another cry from Dean. Cas pulled away, looking at his husband as he scraped the nipple once more. Dean’s head fell back, lips parted and face flushed. His breaths were coming  in short, hot pants. His hips were moving in small, inviting jerks, trying to find relief for his aching cock.
“Mine,” Cas ground out, mind lost to anything but the man in his arms.
“Hey, Cas. I’m still looking for a way to get you out of there. Don’t worry, man, I’m not gonna give up.  Give me time,” he prayed to the lost angel, making an effort to sound positive. He didn’t want  Cas noticing the flattened tone that came with the numbness.
He nodded and turned to Cas. “And do you, Castiel, Angel of the Lord, take Dean Winchester as your husband, from this day onward?”
“I apologize.”
Dean was close to knocking someone’s teeth out by the time they reached the exit. It didn’t help that Cas wouldn’t stop running his nimble fingers over his skin and dipping them into the waist of his slacks.
When they were asked if they’d like to say anything to each other, Dean swallowed nervously as he turned to Cas.
Dean hoped that they would go back to minding their own business, because he wanted to run his hands over his angel’s skin, strip him down, and make him lose it. Hard to do that with an entire bar watching.
Dean started a new tally that night. Days
“Soon, beloved,” Cas vowed, the blown pupils drinking in Dean in the most delicious of ways.
He didn’t remember any more.
“You’re sure you got it right?” He asked again for the fifth time. Sam rolled his eyes and walked ahead of Dean, done with answering him.
The voice of his angel. Dean smiled as much as he could with his face feeling like it had been hit by twenty of Thor’s hammers.
He found himself bouncing from one leg to another as Sam worked to open the door. He rolled his neck and put his hand to the knife at his side. He was ready.
“Wait!” It paused at Dean’s call. He opened his mouth to negotiate more when it was pressed against his front. Dean had never even seen it move.
His Cas – he was positive it was him - moved again to grip his waist and haul him up from the maybe-probably ground. He still couldn’t tell what was what. He thought he might vomit again with the movement. Thankfully, he did not.
The growled command sent a wave of pleasure through Dean. Though he didn’t want to let go of his angel, he obeyed. He stripped down as he rushed to their bedroom. A trail of clothing was left for Cas to follow.
Hope.
Dean pulled back, shocked. “Jack?”
When he felt Cas’ fingernails scrape over the skin of his neck gently, he opened his eyes and looked at his husband. There was a glint in his sapphire gaze, letting Dean know what he intended.
The sweet sound of “I do” coming from Cas’ mouth made Dean want to cheer, even if he had known it was coming. They exchanged rings, simple bands of silver and white gold, twisted together in a circle.
After a beat where they waited for Jack to continue, Dean opened his mouth. “So… Are we allowed to kiss now?”
Dean almost didn’t make the mark that morning. The stupid lines, so many damn lines, made him feel sick.
“Yes! Yours, always yours!” Dean yelled as he came, soaking the front of the panties.
He didn’t know what the expect. Sam had given him the basics. Same would use the key to open the door and call up Cas from the depths of the Empty. Dean would have to go in and play the hero. He’d be on his own, as Sam had to stay behind to keep the door open.
“Fuck. Cas, I’m sorry,” he whispered, willing his words to find their intended target. “If you can hear me, I’m so sorry. I’m going to get you back. Just… wait for me.”
“Dude, chill.”
Moving was interesting, too. There was slight force that pushed against him. Maybe it was that black space, maybe something else. Whatever it was, it made his skin crawl. Walking through the force was almost like walking through water. He found himself unconsciously moving to propel him forward.
Dean looked over at what he assumed was the voice of the Empty – the Shadow. It looked like Cas, except it didn’t.  Briefly, the memory of the Leviathans taking control of his friend’s  body came to mind. That was what this Empty-Cas resembled. It was wrong.
“That sound like a good deal to me. I got a question for you, though.”
Cas reacted as if Dean had slapped him. Wide eyes shit to Dean’s face, lips parted to respond, cheeks flushed. He looked dumbfounded and utterly gorgeous.Dean stepped closer, pulling Cas to him.
At least, until Sam cleared his throat behind him, reminding them where they were. Disappointed, Dean pulled back.
“Yes. My deal with the Empty was to never return. I gave it my Grace and was allowed to return here, with you. It wanted more than my Grace, though. My suffering, your suffering. Mostly, it just wanted sleep. Jack agreed to help The Empty with its slumber. It’s lucky Jack came to your aid.”
Dean stared at barn, confused. It had been years since they’d been there. He had asked Sam four times since they had pulled up of the coordinates were correct. They were.
“‘Ey, Ca’. Rescyoo.” That’s not what was supposed to come out. He tried to speak again, only to be shushed.
Fuck, he was a damned wreck.
Panic rose up in his chest. He couldn’t do anything. He needed to move, talk, see. Anything. Anything.  Why weren’t they helping? He needed help.
Hours ticked by. Sam had decided to stay longer than he had planned. After a quick call back to let Eileen, he settled in to the books again. Dean’s optimism was contagious.
Help.
All he needed was the one good reason he already had to do this: Cas.
Dean nodded, expecting a quick removal and fast return to their desperate race toward the finish line that they’d been on before.
Dean blinked as he processed. “Jesus, Cas. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have jumped to… Well, fuck. I’ve seen you die too damn many times. The idea of you in another deal…” he trailed off with a shake of his head.
“Cas, buddy,” he started, wondering if the angel would hear the smile in his voice, “I hope you haven’t given up in me yet. I’m still hitting the books hard. I’ve got a good feeling.  I’ll see you soon.”
Cas chuckled, drawing his new husband close to him. “Don’t ask stupid questions,” he growled before capturing his lips. It was like coming home and Dean quickly lost himself in the soft heat of Cas’ mouth.
The book was discovered by accident. It was on a haphazardly stacked box that Dean hadn’t gotten around to worrying about yet. Sam, somehow, had tripped directly into the mess.
“Get on your knees,” he demanded. He scrambled to follow the order. “Mm, good boy.”
It was the sight that took him over the edge. Dean looked down to see his cock being worked in and out between Cas’ full lips, the blue eyes staring up at him with blown pupils from his kneeling position. Cas’ own erection was straining against the confinement of the maroon slacks. The hand that was wrapped around his shaft caught the light with its movements, the ring that Dean had placed there hours before glinting with each pass.
“You’re not allowed here,” it hissed. Cold fear hit him. Pure anger and rage created those words.
Before the feeling took hold, he gave his brother a solemn nod and stepped through.
“Yes,” another snapped. The Empty-Cas. Dean didn’t like that voice at all. “We have a deal. Let’s finish it.”
Dean threw back his head at the sensation of finally being filled. “Fuck, you’re so big. Feels so good.”
The attack never came. Fingers glided over his face, gentle and light. Familiar.
He heard the bedroom door open. He didn’t bother to turn around. He wanted to be alone.  “Get the fuck out, Sam!”
“I know, Dean. Thank you,” the lovely voice replied. To someone else, he heard “Do we have a deal?”
There was a pause behind him before that voice he thought he had heard the last of spoke, “Hello, Dean. Do you wish for me to leave, as well?”
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean didn’t open his eyes right away. He felt the softness of his bed beneath him. The blanket smelled clean. He didn’t feel any pain. Just warmth.
He moved forward to kiss the angel, only to be stopped by a loud voice. “Hey, hey! We’re not at that part yet!” He could have happily sent Gabriel back to the Empty via an angel blade at that moment. He sent a glare over to the archangel standing behind Cas instead, deciding that killing his brother on their wedding day might be an unwise decision.
Blinking, he tried to orientate himself. He looked at what he assumed was behind him, to the portal. It was there, nothing but a small speck of light hanging alone against the nothingness. It helped ground him, knowing he had a focal point.
Dean listened. They’re going to need to talk other stuff. Serious stuff. About their time in the Empty. They’re both a little broken. He didn’t mention that yet. That can wait for a little bit. He’ll deal with it later.
There was a shifting next to him and a flash of blue. Against this pitch dark, the light felt warm and safe. It went away far quicker than Dean would have liked.
It was not as nice as when it talked to Dean.
Led Zeppelin’s Bron-Yr-Aur began playing. He heard the shuffle of clothing and hushed whispers as his family and friends turned toward the path that led into the garden where they were sitting. Dean locked his eyes on entrance along with them. His shoulders had tightened up again, and he seemed to have forgotten how to breathe as he waited and the tenuous control that he’d been able to gather over his nerves abandoned him.
“What’s so special about that barn? Your ‘Place of Importance.’”
“You’re really here.” Cas nodded. Dean pulled back. “How?”
He couldn’t help the scoff he gave as a response. “Seriously? Sammy, you’re gonna need better material than that. Apocalypses are kinda our thing, if you haven’t noticed.”
Instead, he focused everything he had into sending this particular prayer. He didn’t know if Cas could hear any of the prayers he had made, but he was going to try his damnedest to make sure he heard this one.
Lucky for the building, it was able to stay unburned, and Dean was safe from Ellen’s wrath. More importantly, Cas had pushed him through the open door, urging him toward Baby.
The book that held the Key to the Empty.
He couldn’t stop screaming. Wailing. Breaking.
“Dean, we should go home,” Cas rasped out after a moment, the need in his voice evident.
Sam was wrong. Even if an apocalypse did happen, he wasn’t on call. They – whoever ‘they’ were – would have to beep somebody else.
Cas led him out to the floor and Charlie obliged them with a slow song. Cas pulled Dean close, swaying with the music, and wrapping his arms around his shoulders to play with his short hair. Dean closed his eyes, enjoying the soft moment.
The not-Cas smirked. “You have nothing that interests me. I just want to sleep. Now that the one who woke me up is back, I can sleep again.”
Cas chuckled as he rolled to the side, “Yes, it was. I am an angel after all, Dean.”
“Shut up, bitch,” Dean grumbled.
Dean then learned that some of the best moments in life don’t pass by as quickly as se people say. They’re instead like a deep sigh. Soft and long, stretched out as long as the moment is allowed. Their eyes locked surprised green against brilliant blue.
Cas was tense as he walked them both to the door. It took an eternity – it was probably shorter than an eternity, though – to reach. He never wanted to be in the dark again. He hated the dark.
Some days were easier to mark than others. Dean hadn’t figured out why that was. The good days didn’t start any differently than the hard days. Some, like that morning, just seemed less difficult.
“Damn right, soon. Reception better be a short one, Cas” Dean returned as they walked down the path of the garden, arm in arm, husband and husband.
He didn’t have anyone there to worry about him.
Cas wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist and began to move. He started slow, but the thrusts quickly turned hard and fast. He slammed deep into Dean, hitting his sweet spot repeatedly. His hands gripped at Dean’s hips, stretching the material of the panties tightly over Dean’s hard cock. The stimulation from his ass being pounded into and of the soft satin pressed almost painfully into his erection had Dean nearly screaming in pleasure.
’” Sammy read, tracing his finger over the words. His face scrunched together and his eyes closed while he worked to translate the words in his head.
He dragged the angel up to attack his lips, not caring that he could taste himself on Cas’ lips. Pulling away from each other, they rested forehead to forehead as they tried to catch their breaths.
Cas lunged forward at the request, lining himself up with Dean’s ready hole, and pushing in. He waited for a moment, letting Dean adjust to him. When the muscles loosened around him, he slid deeper, as slowly as he could manage. Dean pushed back - done waiting -  taking all of Cas in. Both hissed at the movement.
A growl came from behind him. Cas pulled Dean against him, chest flush with Dean’s back. His hips never stopped moving, the thrusts keeping a brutal pace.
Bringing his own hips forward, Cas ground his own erection into Dean's.
That awful tightness in his chest hit him without warning. Instead of the usual slow coil of increasing panic, this was fast and came with the force of a lightening bolt. A roaring sounded in his ears and the room shifted wildly around him. He couldn’t stand it.
The panic attack that had brought him to his knees subsided slowly. Dean wasn’t sure how long he laid on the floor of his room. Only a few minutes? Hours? It didn’t matter, really.
Help.
That was what mattered.
“Cas…” Dean hissed as the fingernails scratched the same trail again, followed by Cas pressing his hips forward into Dean’s. The hunter swooped down to take Cas’ mouth with his own, earning a collective applause from the bar.
Cas pulled away, breathing hard. “Bed, naked, now,” he ordered.
“That’s where I knew I was in love with you. That I would do anything for you.”
The conversation continued, Cas explaining that Jack healed Dean before leaving again. That he had been out for two days. Sam and Cas had been watching him in shifts. They hadn’t been sure he was going to wake up, even with Jack’s help.
“We’re going to talk about that more, but later,” he said, pointing a finger at these angel… no, man, now. “Jack helped? Is he okay?”
Dean couldn’t decide where he wanted to touch first, hands scrabbling wildly all over Cas, who sat, still and stunned, as if he hadn’t expected this outcome when he’d been the one to broach the space between them.

“How can I help you, Dean?” Cas asked. If only it were that simple.
He’d danced to maybe two songs, three if he’d really lost track of time. His phone stubbornly refused to change its time, and when the numbers blinked, it was the minute, moving from two sixteen in the morning, to two seventeen. He’d been in there for
Then, finally, the rustle of wings. He kept his eyes closed, waited for Cas to speak. “Dean.” It wasn’t phrased as a question, but there was plenty of subtext behind it. Dean opened his eyes. Cas looked… well, he looked like he always did.
“Let me touch you,” Cas said, almost pleading. “To see what’s wrong.”
with his head was manufacturing this feeling. There was
Dean stilled, and watched Cas’ chest rise and fall rapidly, fingers digging into Dean’s sides almost painfully. It added to the sensation, everything rising between them, and Dean pushed his hips harder into Cas, letting their cocks slide alongside each other.
Cas had barreled into his life and wormed his way right up into Dean’s heart, carving out a place for himself while Dean was helpless to do anything besides watch.
He turned the Impala around, back towards Sam and the case, with this new knowledge. Everything would change now, but it was like slipping into a comfortable t-shirt, like coming home. All the sharp, brittle edges that had been grating alongside each other uncomfortably in his mind for
of all things. There wasn’t much he could do to deny that fact.
and that didn’t count. It wasn’t a real word.
Dean didn’t want Cas to look at this as something objective, a mission to accomplish. He wanted Cas down in the weeds with him, feeling what he was feeling. He wanted to watch Cas’ face change, to see what Cas looked like when he
Naked before God, just like the day they were born, no lies between them now.
” He went to move again, but Cas pressed a hand into his shoulder. Both points of contact burned like fire, and Dean wondered just how long it would have taken without the spell for him to
If Dean opened his big mouth, there wouldn’t be any deniability. “Let go of me, Cas,” he got out, the words all tumbling out together in an incomprehensible mess. He drew in a breath to say it again, maybe put a bit of actual emphasis behind the words, but before he could, Cas was leaning over him and pulling the door back shut.
Or something similar, Dean thought. It was as close to exasperated as Dean had heard Cas come to.
now, slotted into place. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I think we could swing that.”
“D’you…” Dean gestured vaguely, trying to think of a good way to describe it.
If not for Cas’ firm grip on Dean’s shoulder—right over the mark he’d left on Dean’s body when he’d dragged him out of hell, delivered him from a life of eternal torture—Dean would have fucking

Dean spilled himself into an alley, stumbling out from the throbbing, pounding beat of the club that had taken up a living inside of his bones, pounding right along with his heartrate. He tilted his head back, and realized that his depth perception was off when it
from the moment that Cas raised him from Hell.
He thought that if he had to spend one more moment in the oppressive heat of the car he’d called home for as long as he could remember what home had meant to him, he’d explode. Dean reached over to open the door ,but before he could, Cas had his hand wrapped around Dean’s wrist.
Dean would have grinned, had he been any less touch-starved, any less
Cas had asked. Dean hadn’t known that this had been the answer, until this very moment.
Dean pushed himself to his feet and approached the bag, much as he would a ticking time-bomb. He wasn’t immediately struck with the overwhelming feeling of being
He ran a hand experimentally down the shaft, and Castiel’s hand, which was still holding Dean away from him, spasmed. His eyes flared, and Dean could have sworn that he saw a bit of Grace slip into them, making them glow.
And while it was usually only Dean’s name that was layered with so many meanings, Dean found that he could read all of them just fine. This was Cas, saying that this was exactly what Dean had thought it was, that he hadn’t misread a single thing that had happened.
“What I meant—” Dean looked over at the abrupt stop in Cas’ speech. It wasn’t often that he was caught with the wrong words in his mouth. Cas always seemed to know what to say, even if it wasn’t socially acceptable, or correct. Cas’ eyes were wide on his, not vacant and detached. No, he looked almost… scared. Like he was watching something slip away in front of him, grains of sand through his fingertips. “Maybe we could do that again,” Cas said, almost tentatively.
Cas broke away first, and Dean followed, trying to capture his lips again. He could have done that all night, but Cas seemed to have other ideas. He held Dean at arm’s length, and he was breathing just as quickly as Dean.
and he didn’t want to pass out.
“Here,” Cas said, holding up a small satchel between them. Dean squinted at it, the little black bag swimming in and out of his vision. He reached out to touch it, and Cas yanked it away from him. Almost instantly, it was as if a veil had been lifted off Dean’s eyes. He blinked and shook his head. Cas tossed the little bag away, and Dean lost sight of it.
He’d been on edge for so long, far before he even
his body seemed to say as Cas continued forward, pressing himself into Dean’s space. Pressing and pressing until Dean finally released himself in every way he knew how.
pillaged. “Personal space, man. We’ve talked about this.”
When he had better control of himself, Dean opened his eyes and looked over at Cas, who was staring at him, the intense look not any different than any other time that he looked at Dean.
“Cas,” he said, lowering his voice and doing what he thought was a pretty fair impression of Cas.
“No,” he said, and it came out as more than a laugh than anything else. “Don’t stop. Please.” His voice broke on the last word, and he wanted to clear his throat, to call back some of his dignity. But he wouldn’t, not if it meant that Cas would keep looking at him, would keep his hand around Dean’s cock.
“Was that helpful for you?” Cas asked. “Did it achieve the objective you were looking for?” He looked genuinely curious, head tilted to the side and that signature goddamn

he was on the ground. When had he gotten on the ground? Dean shook his head. “Man, can you tell me what the hell happened to me?”
Dean cleared his throat and looked to the side, hoping that Castiel hadn’t noticed. It was glaringly obvious, his dick straining against the zipper of the too-tight jeans he’d shoved himself into to try to blend in with the young, hip crowd that frequented this club.
Cas’ hands settled on his hips, lightly at first, and his eyes seemed to be glued on Dean’s cock, bobbing up between them.  Dean reached down, and slid his hand along the length of it once more,
Usually, he didn’t seem to have the forethought to realize that he was being extremely awkward, but this was completely different than what they were both used to. Dean wondered if
