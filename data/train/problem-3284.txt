Bright. Too bright.
“The P&I monthly,” Inias says. “Rachel and Anna are already up there. Raph wants to know if you’re coming too.”
“It won’t,” Jack insists. “I know it. I’ll destroy the token and we’ll bring the Lynn sisters home safe.”
Cas sits across from the fake lovebirds, looking put-out by the whole experience. A rush of jealousy hits Dean; he slides his plate up beside Cas, leaning close enough to ask in a low voice, “Is anybody else getting a weird vibe here?”
The memory of a voice curls through him, brushing fondly up his back.
The queen runs a finger along the rim of her glass. “My cousin, Dijwar, has long disagreed with the legitimacy of my reign. Something about his mother being overlooked for mine.”
. But Bart clearly does not share her worries, seeing how his pompous smile continues to ignore her concerns.
As Raphael departs, Dean notices Castiel looking at him square-on for the first time since shaking hands. His attention is so focused, Dean feels almost caught out, like he’s being judged for doing something inappropriate.
Too soon Dean’s grip turned painful, grinding Castiel down against his groin as Dean gasped and finally spilled. Castiel eased up his weight, dragging his cock over Dean’s navel. Dean curved a hand along the small of Castiel’s back and urged him to thrust, and so Castiel rubbed against him until he likewise came.
A flash of brown panelling slides through his memory, rattling on a rusted truck bed with wood for bed rails.
Dean snorts, his grimace hidden by how his head is stuffed into the fridge instead of in front of the screen. “Guy can’t stop bugging me over messaging. He keeps blowing up my phone with stupid questions. S’bad enough I had to silence his contact after office hours.”
He coughs his reply. He tries again to speak, but his jaw is unable to move.
Dean grimaces, but he obliges only to the second half of the request, unfolding the cloth and draping it over his brow and cheeks. His bottom lip pouts out from beneath the cloth’s hem, damp and plush and terribly tempting.
Cas drags his mouth across Dean’s and Dean’s breath gutters, the swell of his lip catching on the stubble around Cas’ pink lips, and Dean’s easy, he’s so easy—Cas could ask for his dying breath and Dean would give it to him gladly, would collapse beneath the weight of such a would-be kiss.
Castiel’s jaw firmed. “It’s what you were doing.”
Alone, for eternity.
But he just doesn’t care.
The calls to the courthouse and county office come easier now that they have an agent to collect paperwork in-person. Sam puts in a request for documentation involving missing persons cases in the county, and Cas comes back to the motel with armfuls of intel spanning the past forty years. Patience organizes the records in order of occurrence and begins building a spreadsheet of basic details, looking for any patterns that crop up between the victims in the past two, five, and twenty years.
Dean fumbles at the shelving around him, trying to remain steady.
“Hey. Sleepyhead.” A wet towel drops into Castiel’s face, jarring him awake. “How long ‘til food?”
Cas wanders past the kitchenette, heading toward Claire and Patience and the piles of paper on the beds between them. He quietly greets them both, receiving mumbled greetings in reply. Stepping over discarded notepads, Cas turns in place, frowning. “What happened? You all seem stressed.”
“It’s okay,” Castiel says, because it’s jarring, absolutely… except Castiel can feel how he already knew all this before. “I asked for it, after all.”
A harsh breath blows out of Sam, and Dean figures he deserves this. He deserves the disgust and the annoyance and the rage. It’s his fault, after all. They wouldn’t even be here if he hadn’t lied to Amara. If he hadn’t thought he could stomach sacrificing parts of his family, cutting himself apart piece by piece, leaving Dean wounded but otherwise alive. A thing that might yet live free, outside the bonds of Chuck’s control.
“What’re you doing?” Dean asks, when her phone tapping comes too rapidly to relate to the trail app.
Dean is hurt. Gravely. He—
“A radius?” Dean shakes his head. “Doesn’t explain how Abbie’s whole family forgot about her, even three states over. If we can stand here without puking, how’re they affected when they’re so far away?”
Privately, Dean agrees. Inias is a solid developer, but it’s become clear over the years of working together that he appreciates it when other people tell him exactly what he’s supposed to do rather than figure it out for himself.
Dean groans again. With more energy than he should muster, he curls forward, rolling Cas onto his back by pushing himself atop him.
“Bart’s really pissed,” Anael tells him outright, when Dean can’t help but invite her to his office. She stirs sugar into her cup, preening as she’s prodded for intel. “He’s asking around for details around who just hired Cas, how long ago he started job hunting. Cas must’ve been honest about it—the idiot—because I heard that Bart went straight to the place hiring him and threatened them for poaching Cas.”
It feels a little like Dean’s easy to move on from. Easy to forget. Each time Dean thinks about it, it makes him want to wait a little longer, because suddenly it’s important that Cas be the one to reach out to him.
Rowena glances between them, frowning. “That means he wins, right? He must; there’s no way to confirm otherwise.”
Mary nods toward Patience and Alex, who lean against Jody’s truck with their own breakfast bags. “Where’s the rest of them?”
“I have to go,” Castiel said quickly, and with his wings he fled without awaiting Dean’s reply.
Dean stares at his brother, waiting, so Sam heavily sighs and says, all vocal fry, “
“Just a sec,” Dean says slowly, mind on the comparisons playing on his screen. “Okay. So the good news is there’s only four files that are out of date. The rest have no changes.”
A harsh breath escapes him, relieved. “Then how—” Castiel cuts himself off, realizing. His back straightens with reflexive deference, struck with the impulse to bow to command. “You’re God now, aren’t you?”
Dean huffs. He focuses on the water running into the sink in the coffee cubby, staring at the soapy rag he’s pushing around his mug. “Can’t imagine what you’re working on so late,” he says. “Seems like you were on top of everything this morning.” He switches off the tap, the sink growing quiet and still.
Not one bone in his body wanted to come into work today. The only thing convincing him to do so is that he’ll get to see Castiel there.
When Ryan’s old life ended with a jump through an inter-dimensional rift, she had just assumed that her mandatory routine training would’ve fallen by the wayside too.
What is it about Castiel that brings out the worst in him?
Dean bit into his sandwich, uncertain what further he should say.
That, and that Luanne better loosen the water heater’s manifold before he shows up at her door. “Can do, if you’re willing.”
Dean eats his jerky on the road, humming tunelessly along with the radio. Castiel peels his oranges in long, spiralling lines. He props the peel up on his thigh, and tucks stray pieces of whiteflesh inside the hollow sphere.The wedges burst brightly on his tongue.
The figure turns, and Dean finally sees him. A breath lodges in his throat.
Jack nods dutifully, and with a brief pat on the back from Mary he’s on his way.
“Do you want me to touch you?” Castiel asked softly.
Dean’s cheeks feel warm, even within the building shiver of the dream.
,” Jack says, voice raised.
“Nothing frozen,” Doug quickly amends, nose wrinkling. “Sorry, just—years on the road. He knows the difference.”
“I screwed up,” Cas continues. “I hurt you too. For all that I’ve dreamed of finally having you—”
Dean puts on his turn signal, avoiding the presumed perimeter up ahead. “Doesn’t sound like it fits the pattern.”
What Dean isn’t expecting is to find Novak sprawled out in the imaging ward’s waiting room, head bowed over the arms he’s tucked across his chest. Castiel wakes when he sees Dean wheeled towards him, rousing quickly and straightening in his seat. He holds a crumpled leaflet of papers in one hand, which Dean presumes are instructions regarding his post-discharge care.
Dean raises his gun as Jack’s neniven crosses by him, to which it squints its amber eyes at him and flexes its fingers. An electric shock runs up Dean’s arm so sharply he drops the gun. The creature shoots a foul look at the weapons held by Claire, Sam and Mary, but it leaves them be when they don’t make any further threatening motions.
Because Sam didn’t get to, with Eileen. Maybe Dean should consider himself lucky.
The full host. A return to life for all of his fallen brethren.
Dean clears his throat, stepping closer, and slaps a hand down heavily onto Jack’s shoulder. “We would’ve waited for you, of course. But everything happened so fast, and it kinda felt right in that moment. To make a cake. And celebrate.”
“Twenty minutes to the bunker,” Castiel murmured into the crown of Dean’s head, confirming the estimate with a glance at the clock radio. Too long; they won’t make it. Regardless, Castiel pressed his foot down harder on the accelerator, flexing the Impala’s speedometer.
He thinks of how close he came to missing Dean, calling him from a payphone only a couple hours later. This old version of himself so completely unaware how close Dean came to giving up for good.
“Do you have any other siblings?” Castiel asks.
“Wait, it’s from Bart?” Dean scoffs to himself. Bart's stuff automatically reroutes into a folder separate from his inbox. Even with Bart’s promotion, he hasn’t turned off that old rule yet.
“You missed the cake,” Castiel said, stepping forward, “so I brought you a slice.”
“I know,” Jack says. For once, his expression softens with something akin to regret; Castiel’s heart breaks. “I’m so sorry, Cas. But we can no longer interfere in these things. There’s no way to save one without wanting to save everyone.”
“Awesome. Good lead.” The footage fuzzes out on the latest angle, briefly blanking out. Dean frowns at it, hitting the heel of his palm into the base of the laptop. It scrambles again. “Huh. It wasn’t doing that before.”
,” Dean growled back. The flashlight swung in their direction, and Dean caught a searing eyeful of the beam. He held up his hands until Cas dropped his angle to the ground. “What are you doing out here? Thought we said to wait in the car.”
Dean cracks an eye open, casts it over to Castiel. He is kneeling by the side of Dean’s bed, disheveled but dressed, backlit by the sliver of light escaping from the dislodged bathroom door. The smell of freshly-brewed coffee stirs a few more brain cells into waking.
Jack shakes his head. “I’m sorry, Castiel. But Heaven will no longer interfere in the realm of humanity. Your help is needed here.”
Surprise! Here is another part to this 'verse~
The television plays on. Lizzie Hegel gets caught tampering with the dementia trial results by Dr. Piccolo, and their friendship grows strained. Three episodes from now, Dr. Hegel will be summarily written out of the show.
“Me too.” Dean pauses, working over what he’ll say next. “Maybe I’ve been kind of a dick to him.”
The SA they hired—if they hired one at all—must have gone to a more important project. Lord knows legacy is hardly a blip on the radar, these days.
“How’d’you—” Dean chokes up, arms seizing with an impulse to hold Cas tighter—to keep him
The bell above Suzie’s door tinkles out a proclamation of further customers, and Hank watches Kurt’s attention swivel, owl-like, onto the two older women who have just arrived—one with a bouncy blonde ponytail, the other with closely-cropped peppered hair. The women approach the baked goods’ display and order strudels from Suzie before heading for the nearest empty table. He catches the imperceptible nod the short-haired one casts the Scottish woman, and wishes briefly that Kurt wasn’t so sharp that he caught it too.
“Yeah. It—” Dean’s throat bobs. “It sucks. But I shouldn’t’ve freaked out and jumped to conclusions. The SA before you sucked, and I kinda forgot what it was like to have someone else handle that job instead of me.” A dry sound escapes him, some weak approximation of a chuckle. “Maybe this is why they never consider me for promotions. I just can’t give up control.”
Maggie nods, happier this time. “That’s the good thing about this world. At least we have the choice.”
Castiel tunes the television to the local news, stretches himself out along one of the beds. He catches a soft tune humming through the walls of the bathroom. He smiles and settles more deeply into the bed.
Rowena drags a dark look in Dean’s direction, one that speaks of bodies buried in places that will never see light again. “I know it’s a spell, you wee brain. It’s why you called me here, begging for help. Remember?”
Dean can’t help it. The scimitar clatters free from his fingertips.
Sam and Jack talk, and Dean laughs to himself, feeling around for another whiskey bottle.
None of it is a good sign.
“Huh,” Sam says.
“Maybe it’s like—the Darkness,” Sam says, frowning as he thinks. He looks at Jack. “Can you control it?”
“Is that it?” Dean snarls. “You just came here to gloat?”
Dean, for his part, lay back with jaws slackened, his glazed gaze bright on but unseeing, his chest heaving through rapid breaths.
“Jesus, Cas.” Dean rushed forward on instinct, ready to catch Cas before he fell over. Cas, in turn, allowed himself to be caught, one feeble hand stretched out from beneath the blanket. His fingers burned where they gripped Dean’s shoulder; his cheeks were ruddy and radiating a sickly warmth. That spicy smell enveloped Dean, and he nosed his way toward it, enticed by the scent.
“Got six pies coming to you by eight tonight,” she tells him, cutting straight to business. “That enough time for you to get the main course in?”
Castiel’s mouth twists with a sad smile, but he otherwise busies himself with his soup as well.
Dean raises a brow at it, so Castiel explains, “My contact information. Now that my work number is retired…” He shrugs, like it’s an answer to anything. “I won’t bother you anymore. Just know that I’ll be there, when you’re ready. If you feel the same.”
“Oh yeah?” Dean narrows his gaze. “How’s that?”
The boy freezes, as if caught out. Nat puffs around her lighter and waits impatiently for him to thaw. “Think it was a white truck, last I saw.”
Anael drops her cutting gaze.“So there’s an email from Bart, saying we’re taking on this whole extra workload.”
Dean claps his hands and waves towards himself affably. “Bring ‘em both! I can eat for two.”
Eventually, after an eternity, a tentative touch came to one side of Dean’s hips, then the other, and Dean all but sobbed with relief. His alpha did want him after all.
“Is this separate from the time with Ramiel?”
Castiel tugs to free his hands, even though they both know he’s strong enough to simply break Dean’s grip. Dean refuses to relent, however, and ends up being pulled into Castiel’s orbit, touching chest to chest.
He can’t help it; the guy makes it too easy.
Dean reaches for his brother’s hand, body trembling with adrenaline, with fear. “Sammy,” he says quietly.
In the morning, Dean wakes to warmth, and darkness. A night spent submerged in sleep.
Emboldened, Dean said, “I’m right, aren’t I.” He threw a wink that was lost to the dark. “Tell me what’s bugging you, angel.”
, for anyone wishing to support on Tumblr. Thank you for reading!
Cas grunted and returned to staring out the side window.
“So this is the dream team in action.” Dean twirls his keys around a finger, drops them into his hand. He dips his head to Sam, nods at the small wave Patience gives him, and greets Claire’s eye-roll with mock affront. “Got nothing in those bags for me?”
Castiel makes to stand, ready to step back, but Dean keeps his arm tight on his waist and just swivels them around. They’re angled enough that Dean can now see Jack, oblivious, reaching for a slice of cake.
She eyes a shallow cut on her palm, made some time during the scuffle. Her nose wrinkles as she pokes a nail along its raw edge.
The boy sighs, cursing.
“Excuses, excuses. I want to see that pulled pork in action, mister.”
With one arm cradling his grace bottle, Cas skims his free hand down Dean’s arm, nodding to him as he parts ways, aiming for where Mary and Max are in deep discussion with Jack. Dean sidles up beside his brother, bursting whatever bubble of conversation had been floating between him and Jody. Not far off, Alex and Patience hang close to Alicia, the three of them giving Kaia and Claire their space.
, y’know …” His hand made another complicated motion, which Dean stopped partway through and simply covered his face. He coughed and straightened his back, firming up whatever decision he had just made. “I could be a spotter, just incase, y’know … if you’re doing something freakishly weird.”
Dean himself has his face buried in his pillows, clutching for dear life at the bundles of fabric swept into his arms. The dog whimpers. Dean mumbles something, muscles twitching. Castiel senses his longing like a caress against his skin.
Hank shrugs neutrally. “Somebody’s relative, likely. Visiting from out of town.”
Castiel steps in, looking haggard. In his right fist, he raises a wine bottle by its neck.
Castiel nods.
“Just wanted to stop by,” Raphael says. “See how the project is coming.”
(Cas buys old pulp novels in bulk from the library, picking up mysteries and science fiction paperbacks for twenty-five cents a bag. His streaming tastes are slightly more appalling, geared towards trashy dating shows and reality TV, though Castiel accepts every show recommendation Dean offers him, and comes back on Mondays with talking points for each suggestion.)
The answer he receives is an even less coherent noise. Castiel carries his laptop with him and repeats his question through the door, to which Dean blearily responds:
With their mate.
Hank shrugs. “If you treat him nicely, I’m sure he will.”
His mother’s killer; his father’s obsession.
Dean will get through it all, goddamnit. He’ll do it for his team.
“Then
“Later,” Dean said, hastily pulling up his jeans. “Don’t need to shellshock him all at once, just … later.”
“No,” Castiel admits, bashful. “We’re not friendly enough for it.”
Dean felt his heartbeat stutter, even as the fear began to seep back into his body, reacting to an alpha lying so close to him. He pushed through it though, allowing the fear to become part of the exhilaration of pulling his alpha—god, pulling
Castiel answers it by inching closer, abandoning his pillow in favor of Dean’s own. Dean lifts his chin, making room for Cas to tuck his face into the crook of Dean’s neck. His arms drape around Castiel, holding him close, foregoing half of the bed entirely as they wrap themselves up in each other.
A foot kicks out in Dean’s direction; Sam only connects with his shin because the kid’s eight feet tall and has gargantuan reach. “You mean the marriage where I was roofied daily and handcuffed to a bed?” Sam says pointedly. He scoffs. “Yeah, I remember.”
“Jack can sense the tokens,” Patience answers, “and he has immunity to the perimeter. We discussed it while you were two out of it. He can take over for Cas.”
damn time he needs to lick his wounds and heal outside of work hours, and his boss is giving him more work instead. Dean doesn’t even know half of what Zach’s work day looks like, except it hardly includes legacy.
He breathed out harshly, figuring the subject was dropped. But Cas was still watching him in his subtle way, face soft, expression open. So Dean found himself digging out old memories that he had never told anyone, his nose tucked into the juncture of Cas’ shoulder, mouth moving directly into his skin.
“She is not broken,” Castiel growls. “The conditions for entry will
From the corner of his eye, he sees Sam has started signing his responses. Dean returns the entirety of his attention back onto the screen. “Eileen there? Give ‘er over,” he says, flagging his fingers.
“He gets like this sometimes.” Sam snorts, humorless, tucking away the shop vac. “Should’ve seen him after you died—”
Chuck’s smile turns rueful. He sticks his tongue out, blows a loud noise. “No thanks. Not interested.”
“The feeling is mutual.” Castiel laughs lightly. “I keep looking over at my coworker’s desk, thinking I might see you there.”
“It isn’t, I just—” Castiel exhales sharply. “My faculty is hiring, and if we run into my boss, I want you to have the best shot at getting—”
“And with that guy?” Garth releases a low moan. “
their end of the day conversations any more than he
“Because you cook,” Cas replied, “and Sam doesn’t like to.”
Michael appears in the corner of Dean’s bedroom, not too long into his fretful attempt at sleep—his thoughts on Purgatory, on the last time Dean had come close to cracking that chasm within him open, saying what’s never been said. Thinking about how Cas had stopped him before Dean could screw up and say the wrong thing.
Cas's fists slam down onto the table. “As if I didn’t have to watch him tramping around with you adulterous
Castiel listened as best he could with his vessel’s blood pounding, annoyance building in his chest. Despite Castiel’s perfect imitations, Dean continued to insist that Castiel was failing the most basic fellating gestures upon himself. Castiel followed Dean’s instructions to the letter, but he was neither pleased with the results nor in agreement with what Dean was saying.
Dean reluctantly let Castiel go, shucking off his underwear when Castiel brought him a fresh pair. He heard the old washing machine switch over, the dryer kicking up as Castiel exchanged the loads of laundry. The thought of Castiel gripping his dick in Dean’s washroom had Dean’s own prick perking up again. He willed the image away, reminding himself that he wasn’t like this. Dean wasn’t normally so wanton, someone who’d let an alpha’s cock inside of him.
Dean sighs. His eyes roll up to the ceiling. “Yeah, he’s spelled
Castiel sighed. A light fixture beside the bunker entrance, long thought inoperable, flickered on. “It’s a disturbance in the balance between my trueform and my vessel. The halation is manifesting in odd ways.”
“Well, you tried,” Dean says, biting into his burger. “Nobody can fault you for that.”
“Which ones would you steal from me,” the Shadow grumbles eventually.
Farther into the bunker, Dean can hear the occasional scream still coming. The thump of a body hitting the floor. He pulls an angel blade out from among the bodies and motions for Sam to be careful. They stumble their way through the corpses back to the library, now softly smoking. Singed, blackened, bloodied, but the bones of it intact.
Machines beep in the brief silence between words.
Alicia shrugs, still tucked up beside Claire. She extends her arm like an arrow aimed at the yard. “We only have the one angle keeping the farmhouse in sight. I’d say Cas should just follow it, see what’s being hidden inside.”
. All of that. To him. All while knowing he would never see Dean again.
Dean’s had to copy the whole lot into a Notepad document and fight through the apostrophes masquerading as single quotes, but so far the battle has come to no avail. As the clock ticks closer to the time the report is due, Dean’s patience shortens alongside the timeframe available.
Cain moves from his perch, rising to full height. “You both are adequate with the hatchets. You can move on to the axes this afternoon, if you’d like.”
It reassured Dean, though not by much; alphas were as instinctual post-mating as omegas were, while ramping into heat sex. Cas could be cuddling him with no say beyond his body’s reflexes telling him it was what he actually wanted.
And Dean
“I still get nervous,” Dean finished, “especially around an alpha in rut, but Cas… You’ve never done anything to make me afraid. It’s all just… younger versions of me, taking turns behind the wheel.”
Eileen is at work, and Sam has a rare evening free from the law office. He keeps Dean company while he decompresses, grousing about what happened—grieving it, really, the wound still fresh enough to sting. Sam is a good listener, can humor Dean as long as he needs. But sometimes some genuine advice gets thrown into the mix.
Castiel hums agreement. He holds Dean’s flower pot beneath the kitchen tap, sparing a moment to water his daisies as the meal cooks.
With calloused hands, Dean grabs fistfuls of Castiel’s trench coat and wrenches him in closer, knocking him off his feet. Castiel stumbles forward, clutching at the one thing that has always kept him steady. A hand lands on Dean’s shoulder; the same one he grabbed when he pulled Dean free from Hell.
Michael’s mouth twists ruefully. “Those that you’ve killed over the years. Anyone who might still hold a grudge against the Winchesters.” Michael gestures down at Adam’s body. “Hence why I’m here.”
"No," Dean says in a rush.
Dean kicked off his shoes, dumping them unceremoniously over the side of the bed. He punched the pillow behind him, then crooked his legs and planted his heels firmly into the bedspread. Tapping at Castiel’s leg, Dean gestured for him to follow suit. “Just get your pants down enough to—yeah, like that.”
“What? No, I ate when I got home.” He eyes Castiel shrewdly. “Have
Dean sleeps three hours, then hauls himself into the shower when his dreams of scorched earth catch the scent of burning pine. Just another fire that took his mother. He hangs his head beneath a stream of hot water, feels as empty as the drain.
The djinn queen smirks, her dark eyes bouncing playfully between them. “I gave you a fail safe manner of waking, if I correctly recall.”
“Well,” Zach says, his mouth a grim line. “Now that we’re all finally here, let’s begin.” He taps his stack of papers together, his gaze pointedly turned away from Dean.
There was a pause. Then Cas said, “I don’t think I stopped the movie.”
Claire nods back. “All web presence of the girl too—the hashtag, the conspiracy thread—it all just vanished. It was weird enough that Patience and I figured we’d swing by instead of heading straight home, but then we got here and, well…” She flaps her hands ahead of her. “You’ll see.”
“Dean—”
Dean trudges back through the ditch, aiming for Claire and the Impala. He spares a glance backward that he does not want to give, just enough to confirm that Cas isn’t following him, that Cas hasn’t been swayed.
Though the lights remain off when he gets in, Dean can tell that Sam is awake now. Dean pauses, feeling caught-out. He forces the feeling loose and, padding across the room, climbs back into bed. Sam can avoid sleep as long as he wants to, but Dean would rather rejoin the dreams that continue to haunt his bed.
A gift, not a payment. Dean is at least smart enough not to say that.
Sam curses, staring up at the balcony. “It’s happening.”
Frowning, Dean asks, “I thought you were a paralegal.”
Dean glances to the passenger seat, a sweep so quick he hopes Cas can’t catch the brightness to his eyes.
"Yeah," Dean says, as casually as he can. He shrugs. "I just figured, y'know, since you took care of me when you didn't have to, then they could be—I dunno, a gift?"
Castiel expects Dean to be watching the movie, but there’s a book open on the bed in front of him, and his tablet is likewise resting within reach. Dean checks the page and then pecks something into his tablet, then stares a bit at the screen before repeating the motions.
“What? No way.” Dean stares openly. “Who was bitching about you to him?”
help them,” Ryan hisses back.
“Sammy, please, don’t you dare—”
Anael is outraged, once the news breaks out. She places an emergency order for a cake from a bakery down the block, the details of which are settled frighteningly quickly with the employee on the other end of the line. While they’re waiting, Miriam gets a forwarded copy of Bart’s email, its contents plumbed for further insight into Inias’ future. Anael calls up her secret contacts on the other teams, confirming what rumors she can about the move, unveiling what little intel is out there about Inias’ new project. Even Hannah takes her break early to come upstairs, giving a big hug to Inias and promises that their paths will cross again.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean says even lower. “You know you can tell me anything, right?”
“Your help?” it spits out, rocking back on its heels. “
“Dean,” Raphael says, open palm extended forward. “This is Castiel Novak, your new system analyst.” He gestures with his other hand toward the man standing behind him. “Castiel, this is Dean Winchester, head of development on our legacy system.”
The corner of his mouth curves upward; Castiel touches the knot in his tie, buried against the hollow of his throat. His hand rests there warmly, a placeholder for the one he wishes it could be. “Dean,” he murmurs, “what would you have me do? What is it that humanity truly wants from life?”
?” Chuck laughs. “They’re gone, baby. Gone.”
“Hi. Wow. I recognize your voice!” Sam chuckles, awkward. “So you’re the one who’s got Dean socializing outside of office hours?”
That gives Dean pause. “If this is a spell, why wouldn’t every dimestore witch be sticking out these citronella candles? Seems like a damn fine way to keep hunters at bay.”
Like it or not, Dean’s fate in the league has been sealed.
Dean snorts at the finger-quotes Castiel makes as he speaks, knowing that the idea and the sentiment behind it likely came from Miriam. He then sobers quickly. “Wait, two days?”
The longer Castiel remains quiet, the more Dean worries. Gripping the edge of his comforter, he lifts up his bundle of blankets. A gap of air opens between them; a question posed.
His pocket vibrates. Dean digs out his phone. “Anael’s signed off on the bug. We should be in the clear to finish before production happens.”
The text bubbles float for eternity on Sam’s end, then drop off with a succinct:
As if sensing this, Cas asked, “What do you want, Dean?” His mouth caught on Dean’s bottom lip as he spoke. He kissed the corner of Dean’s mouth, as he waited for Dean’s reply, which Dean gave by chasing after him, licking his lips in pursuit of a proper kiss.
Dean fetches the corkscrew from the junk drawer and digs through the fridge for the jar of shakeable parmesan lodged in the back of the bottom shelf. Castiel handles the uncorking while Dean coats his pasta with an extra layer of cheese. With Castiel’s approval, he unpauses the television, and they both settle in to watch Dr. Sexy as they eat.
“Novelty shirts?” Dean deadpans. “You think I’m gonna wear novelty shirts?”
Dean grins. “You’d get along with my brother, Sam.”
“Claire? Patience?”
“I mean, were we?” Pamela opted to be sighted today, and so she glances sidelong at Ash, who seems prickly yet for no discernable reason.
The porch door bangs open some time later, and Dean perks up in time to see Sam climb down the steps with Jody. Sam takes a moment to spot Dean, then murmurs something to Jody before making his way over. Leaning over the back of Cas’ chair, Sam says quietly, “Trent and Abbie’ve decided—they’re not going home unless it’s on their terms. But this girl, Marie, and her brother, they’re willing to go back. Etri and Wemi are working on restoring their existence as we speak.”
“’M glad you came here. It was getting tough, doing all this stuff alone.”
In heaven, the once-empty halls teem with life the likes of which has not been seen in over a decade.
“Max,” Dean announces, tucking his phone away. He fights his way to his feet, swatting away Cas’ attempts to help him rise.
Dean glances up at the entryway, spotting where Cas has come bursting through the bunker’s main door, rumpled and breathless. Dean holds still, ears straining for further answer. The tension between Sam and the remaining djinn pauses, as if waiting to know what will happen next.
“She’s right, Dean,” Sam says. “Now that I’m looking, you kinda seem a little ragged. Have you been getting enough sleep?” He pokes at the skin beneath his own eyes in emphasis, drawing his finger down.
A demon smokes out inside the room, then another. There’s too many to keep from overwhelming the barrier of flames.
Cas sat slumped on the closed lid of the toilet, his good hand holding up his head, his long fingers buried in his hair. His jeans were off, his broken arm resting across his bare knees. The tub burbled as it filled beside him, clouding the room with steam.
Dean exhales sharply. Somehow he doubts that any job out there will care about him the way he invests himself in it. He mumbles, “Thanks,” to his brother, and soon after their conversation drops off; the call ends.
Without thinking too deeply about it, Dean tossed the tomato pots into passenger side wheel well, bowing their heads down to fit inside the vehicle.
Someone approaches along the motel sidewalk behind him, gravel crunching as they slow. A hand falls upon his shoulders and starts slowly rubbing, soothing the muscles in his back.
Dean squares his shoulders and walks with light feet across the cubicle floor. And he almost makes it to his office before a burst of clapping erupts from behind him, the raucous noise joined by obnoxious cheers. Dean deflates a little as he turns around, facing Anael, Miriam and Inias where they have popped up amid the cubicles, the trio boorishly celebrating his return.
“Somehow,” Cas rasps, quiet, “you’re angrier now than the first time I ever watched you sleep.”
Dean wasn’t paying attention then, but he is aware of it now, how without the tie Castiel’s collar hangs open, his chest exposed. The bottom of his throat lays bare, a square of tanned skin spread open for the taking.
“I don’t know,” Sam breathes, pushing back his hair. “I don’t know. I’m just grabbing all the information we can get before the wipe happens.”
Bart’s omnipresent smile falls slightly, flickering like a light bulb on the fritz. “Yes?”
Sam must sense the loss as well, probably more so than Dean. His shoulders stay tight throughout the drive home, his mouth and brow drawn onto his face in blunt, downward lines. He splits as soon as they hit the stairs, pulling a one-eighty before he even touches down in the war room. Dean spares hardly a thought before passing him the Impala’s keys. They don’t need to babysit each other, despite how badly they need the proximity of family on today of all days.
They drive past a nail salon and a Dollar Tree, then take a left down a narrow road leading onto a long side street. Dean parks a block back from where he’s expecting the perimeter, climbs out, and gruffly motions for Cas to follow. They hike down a road lined with boxy beige houses, the suburb so new that half a dozen For Sale signs still litter the lawns, and the spindly poplar trees planted along the sidewalk still have their nursery tags.
Naomi raises a concise explanation as to how the defect should have never advanced to pre-production in the first place.
“Holy
“Have you met him?” Inias asks. “Does he seem at all like he knows what he’s doing?”
Dean cracked a weak smile. “Who, you or me?”
Dean huffs. He’s not going to play this game. “Y’know, between the two of us, you’re the one that keeps leaving, right? Now I can stand here as long as you want, but I—” Dean shuts his mouth, shakes his head. They keep arguing about the stupidest things. Gaze tucked low, Dean mutters something that means something, at least to him. “That night, you knew what I was gonna say. You
He doesn’t want to come on too strong, too soon, but hell—if Cas feels the same way as him? Dean could walk on clouds all day. He’ll do whatever he has to to hold Cas like that again.
“Hester can,” Castiel replies, “although she’s not familiar with these maintenance requests.”
Dean angles back, just a little. “You don’t have a thermometer for that?”
Dean drags his attention upward.
“So did I,” Dean said. “Problem is the bunker is locked up so tight, there’s no exterior water line to tap into.”
“It was your decision, ultimately,” Castiel says carefully. “But we’re trying to offer a world that helps people be their best. Part of that is helping them avoid actions that would upset others. So Heaven offers you small… suggestions. To assist however it can.”
Ricky’s shoulders slump. He takes his balance from the curved top of the display case, waiting for his brain to reboot. He’s in his element for once, except that he’s not, not by any stretch of the imagination. What do you offer the guy that regularly asks for entrails?
“I don’t feel any different,” Cas calls out.
The night is warm, the breeze low and balmy; the sunset glimmers along the rippling surface of the pool. They sit for a bit, enjoying the evening, and then Sam brings them back onto the case, swapping motive and methodology as they drink. Dean stretches out his stiff legs and mostly listens while Sam goes over the usual suspects—somebody or something with access to the mystical, assuming the weird barrier is actually tied to the abduction and not some other odd mess keeping them from the city.
Castiel nods but doesn’t acknowledge the compliment any further than that. “More?” he asks, standing. When Dean shakes his head, Castiel cleans up both mugs, running the tap over both before dropping them into the sink. He wipes his hand on a towel, then lifts his head. “Tea?”
“Deserve each other,” Inias grumbles.
“She’d send some of her own people up to help us,” Sam advises, after his spell ingredients drop to cinders. “But she can’t promise they won’t join the other side of the fray. So instead…”
“He fell,” Patience says blankly. “Cas, he—dropped, like he passed out, o-or—”
The first touch of their mouths comes as a gentle graze of lips. Dean’s breath hitches, pulling back, disbelieving, but he cannot stop himself from pressing in again. Castiel’s mouth touches his, firmer this time, more assured. Dean tilts his head, adjusting the angle, leaning in to the hand Castiel has moved to cup his face.
Castiel sighs. “This is very complicated.”
Even still, the couple days Dean spent as Castiel’s pseudo-roommate just shine a light on all the subtle shades of life missing from Dean’s usual routine. He doesn’t have somebody to discuss a show on TV or what to have for supper; somebody who might share an observation about something at work that tangents off into bouts of laughter; somebody to brush shoulders against, as they brush their teeth together at the bathroom sink, one last lingering round of company shared before retiring to their separate beds.
Sam calls after them, “Have fun!” and Dean gives him a one-finger salute. When he glances back over his shoulder, his brother is the only one giving a parting wave.
In a creaky voice, Dean said, “First, I hope to God it happens on a weekend, so I miss at most a Friday or Monday. Call in sick only if I gotta, because I tend to lose my hourly job whenever they find out I’m not an alpha, and the company doesn’t want to start shelling out for heat days.”
Doug leans in toward the glass, staring down the chuck like it might offer its own take.
Chairs abruptly scrape behind them; someone clears their throat pointedly, and a hissed conversation breaks out. Dean turns to find Matty-or-Marky trying to hold Lenora back as she rounds on their table, expression apoplectic, her hands trembling with rage. “Garth,” she begins, her voice shaking, “I’m so sorry I have to do this, but someone needs to tell you that
“Okay for now,” Alex whispers back. “Help me turn him on his back? I want to start an IV.”
“So who are we meeting again?” Dean asks, tugging on his collar. He keeps staring over Castiel’s shoulder at the mirror, wondering who’s looking back at him in that button-down shirt and coiffed-back hair.
Hester and Uriel join them in the elevator, a floor up. Beyond exchanging idle pleasantries they all fall silent, nerves collectively kicking in as the elevator carries them upwards again.
They survive their way into the storeroom, their final destination. The last part of the bunker they’ve left protected. The door is still broken, blown off its hinges from Chuck’s last visit, but their remaining stores of holy oil should be enough to barricade the threshold for a while.
Castiel frowns slightly. “You didn’t know?”
Dean shrugs. “Sure, call up Max if you really want a second opinion. But he’s a hunter too, man. You really think it’s gonna make a difference?”
Bare chest, lightly haired. Strong, trim muscles. Solid neck, firm jaw. Attractive, as Castiel understood it. He touched at one pectoral, felt the flesh gently give way. He dragged his fingers up his throat, then down and over a nipple, all the while trying to understand the appeal.
“So, who’s the new guy?” Dean asks, voice low as he pulls a mug from the cupboard.
In the morning, when Sam still isn’t with them, Dean goes about the mechanics of making breakfast for one. He hovers over the frying pan, gets through eating a limp plate of eggs and bacon. Dean’s just about ready for cleanup when he spots the dishes left out after game night, the stale stovetop popcorn and the bowl of dried-out carrot sticks they’d cleaned into the sink in their haste.
Sam doesn’t miss his shot. He plunges the angel blade into the crook of Azazel’s neck, pushing until the hilt rams flush to his chest. “Fuck you,” he hisses out, slamming the blade down harder. Twisting. His eyes turn to Chuck, radiating a frosty hate. “And fuck you too.”
Dean doesn't say it, but he thinks they will. Everyone in management loves things getting done ahead of time. He pauses, mulling over what’s been said. “Is Inias okay with moving off BEAU?”
Something in Dean caves. His hands drop to the bed, pushing until he’s up on his feet. He looks at Castiel, really looks at him, his gaze not once faltering to the scar on Castiel’s face.
When the pasta finished cooking, Dean plated a heaping bowl, and debated what to do next. He hated the note that Cas had parted on—nothing had actually happened to earn Dean’s ire, even if it was a dick move for Cas to not tell him about his rut. They were both adults; Dean even considered Cas a friend. So the least Dean could do was hear out Cas’ apology before he left.
Maggie sighs, her smile turning wistful. “A bit,” she answers, nodding vaguely.
“Is this okay?” Castiel murmured into Dean’s shoulder.
“Sorry we make each other miserable,” Dean forces out through the warble in his voice.
“Raph’s trying to trick us into admitting time theft and occupational redundancy,” Miriam says simply, as Dean pushes his coffee mug into an elbow and begins flipping through the pages. “There’s a shitton of questions to answer, and a second set of timesheets for us to fill in. I’m assuming it’s for him to compare against our digital records, looking for errors.”
“Anyways,” Miriam says, rocking back on her heels. “Just wanted to tell you you’re a dick. And to stop working so hard. And I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
With it, Dean minimizes the messenger app on his desktop, and for the rest of the morning he tries not to think about Castiel and his corny little smiley face replies.
“It’s beautiful,” Castiel says, eyeing the woods and neatly-tended flower beds around the farmhouse, his nose nearly smudging the window.
Dean narrows his eyes. Over the top of his laptop, he raises his brows in question. Castiel responds with a shrug and sets aside his computer, seeming calm, though his wide eyes suggest a nervousness undeserved for what the conversation will likely involve. Dean tries to reassure him with a confident motion of his chin, right before he turns the laptop Castiel’s way.
that they do together.
Benny bumps his knuckles against Dean’s chin in an echo from earlier, to which Dean bows back, annoyed, and swipes Benny’s glass in retaliation. Dean sips at it, wincing straightaway at the flavor. “Sazerac. Really?”
“Just a jar of Italian mix. Except I need a new one of these,” Dean said, waving the spatula, “since you’re sick.”
That helped soothe the sting of rejection Dean’s omega had been feeling. Which was stupid, because his omega was also currently running wild within him because there was a rutting alpha in the same room as him.
The spell broken, Dean finally looks away.
“No fucking way,” Pamela says, laughing.
“Can’t. I keep thinking about the case.”
Miriam hums agreeably, sitting slouched and unresponsive, twisting back and forth in her rolling chair. “Nothing like scaling legacy back to bare-bones to encourage another project reshuffling. You’d think stealing Bart was enough, but nope.”
The entrance to the bunker begins to shudder, fists banging hard enough to shake the door on its hinges.
Jack crouches over the spray of flour on the floor, a dustpan and hand brush at the ready, waiting offside from the island. He glances up to Castiel, then shifts his gaze toward the speakerphone. “Are you sure this is the right recipe? Castiel and I have followed it exactly three times now, but the dough is still too flaky to roll.”
“Mm-hmm.” Castiel turns around, though his gaze drags along the floor, hanging far from reach. “Dean, I’m sorry for what’s happened with the BEAU project. I thought I was doing a good thing by highlighting your strengths as a manager.” Swallowing, he glances up. “I miscalculated how deeply it would affect you. That you weren’t involved on the ground level of development. The team layout decisions might have come from above me, but I should have pushed harder against them.”
His high spirits were enough that he could even forget about last night’s emergency defect, for a while, his mind instead drifting pleasantly in the shower, hands revisiting the places Castiel had touched him, gliding from hickey to hickey. But then the fact of the defect came crashing back, dumped on him like a bucket of ice water, Castiel’s fears rekindled as his own.
Breathing harshly, heat-shivers wracking through him, Dean clicked through the menus until the ‘Cancel Appointment’ option finally stuck.
updating a day early because 2020 is made up and time doesn't matter!!
Dean thumps a fist against his own table and swings his legs down, returns to standing. The remainder of the queen’s entourage titters as he moves closer, their bodies tensing for the scimitars currently housed in their scabbards. Dean leaves them hanging, briefly, before bumping his hip against the table where the queen sits. “So you came all the way here from Syria to tell us… why?”
A shiver runs through Dean, shaking his head. “Fuck no. Wasn’t planning on it, ever.”
Garth’s head turns on a swivel, his accusing glare landing squarely on Dean. He finishes his shot glass, and in a dark voice he whispers, “Is it true? Are you cheating on me?”
the one leaving
The face scrub tingles as Dean uncaps the jar and rubs a handful on his cheek. “Great. So we got nothing.”
The couple they are sitting with, a Matty or Marky and his fiancée, Lenora, makes matching baby-soft smiles as Garth pats his own lap, telling Dean, “Don’t you worry, hon, I saved you a spot right here.”
Out front, two white rental vans are parked and puttering with their side doors sprung open. Dumah, Gail and Indra from web services are clustered together by the smoking section outside the lobby, chatting among themselves. Bart gathers them up and goes over the itinerary again as they wait for Raphael to arrive a fashionable fifteen minutes late.
The wood crackles. Smoke builds. The white cloth wrapped around Dean’s body begins to turn black.
He flies by Claire, knocks elbows with Sam as he rushes past him, tucking his head down and barreling through the wall of nausea hitting him like a ton of bricks.
Donna hops out from the driver seat, greeting them with a distant howdy. She crosses the yard quickly, a giant smile on her face. “Heard you guys were throwing a party out here in the boonies. Would’a been a shame if you almost forgot to invite me.”
The boy accounts for so many of the photos on Castiel’s cell phone. He is in group pictures with Sam and Dean, and a woman Castiel now recognizes as Mary.
His footsteps track mud into the hall. Rainwater drips in his ears. Down his neck. No one has been here since…
“I know, right?” Garth chuckles. “Turns out he and his belle took a road trip down to Vegas. One drive-thru tunnel of love later and whoop”—Garth whistles—“we have a new family member added to the mix!”
“Any good?”
Heat flooded throughout Dean where their bodies were connected, a steady weight building inside of him as Cas made shallow thrusts through the repeated spurting of his dick. Dean closed his eyes and briefly reveled in the feel of Cas around him, inside of him. It felt so good, falling pliant into Cas’ arms, relying on Cas to catch him as he came down from his high.
Dean holds his breath, waiting.
They join Dean in his corner of the lobby, waiting for web services or upper management to come collect them for the day. Unfortunately, it's Bart who finds them first. He exits the elevator with his fake grin already plastered on, overwide and overbright. Upon locating them, he throws an arm apiece around Dean and Miriam, exclaiming, “How great is it we get to spend the day together?”
At least, that’s what Dean gleans from his brother’s phone conversation with Cas, Sam frowning out at the street ahead as he continues nodding along, listening to Cas blab in his ear. Dean debates pulling over into the nearest parking lot, just so he can eavesdrop a little easier, but he crushes the impulse and keeps the Impala on the straight and narrow, winding them around the eastern edge of the city instead.
The morning couples activities shunt Sam and Cas off to a yoga class together, while Dean ends up in a scrap-booking class with Garth. When the instructor asks for each couple to provide their own photos, Garth reaches beneath the table and pulls out a disturbingly elaborate photo album of he and Dean on their wedding day. Dean flips through the pages of the album, face pale as he surveys the stetson hats and matching fringed jackets Garth picked out for their would-be biggest day.
Sam looks up from his laptop, frowning at the girls’ giggling. “What’s so funny?”
“Aye, aye.” Dean mock-salutes, collecting the cutlery in Castiel’s wake.
Dean kicks at a lump of shirts Sam left on the floor. “Dude, didn’t I teach you to clean up after yourself? Looks like Goodwill threw up in here.”
This particular black car Nat has seen park by her pumps more often than the rest of the town combined. A beautiful piece of muscle, stopping by with the boys that own her twice a week or more, always needing more than the quarter tank top-up that tends to be favored upon the vintage models that cross her path. No, this old darling seems to earn her drinks pacing dirt roads every day. Nat suspects her mileage count is far beyond what average years would otherwise carry.
Dean laughs, breathless, biting back the tears. “Anything.”
“Sam, could I exchange room keys with you for the night?”
Dean can apologize later, once his mind has clouded over, the glass box dimming back to black. Once he gets back into the groove with work, the unsettled strangeness left in him by the dream will go away.
A lump moved on the couch facing away from him, tousled hair turning Dean’s way. “Dean?” the lump said, sleep-heavy, shifting beneath an exorbitant pile of covers. On wobbly legs it stood, shrouded by a grey comforter blanket.
His team is strong, and Dean has managed to keep the legacy system running smoothly despite how Raphael’s special projects keep poaching their better members (Bart notwithstanding). Dean’s grateful that his core group of dev and QA has escaped each reshuffle relatively unscathed.
“Hey, it could so be mine! But it just so happens I’m staying at a... friend’s. Until I feel better.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, his face growing warm. He had tried hard not to think too deeply about it, ever since he made the changes. He scratched at his neck, fumbling for ways he might hide his growing shame.
Plastering themselves to either side of the entryway, they spot the shadows moving across the red-streaked war room. Dean exchanges a tactical look with Sam, and on the same count they throw themselves out with weapons raised.
“Something simple,” Cas says, gaze darting as he thinks. “If the tethering wanted to keep us close together…”
Dutifully, Castiel recites the names of every angel he or Dean or Sam have unjustly killed.
“Let’s get you comfortable first.” Gently, Cas pushed off his bathrobe, and with the two of them swaying like slow dancers, he nudged Dean deeper into the room.
Claire’s cheeks flush at the names, leaving Dean to wonder which one is the culprit. She ducks away as she gathers up her hair, tying it up and off her neck. “It’s fine, whatever. Patience frets like a mom over her visions, and Alex is obnoxious now that she’s got another ally in the house.”
“Only the fallen,” Michael answers. “Those who sided with Lucifer. My brother,” he adds, like they would have forgotten about Satan himself.
He’s wearing the stupid party hat still—a blue cardboard cone designed to look like it’s covered in confetti, its elastic band fitted snug beneath his chin. He looks strangely young, his blue eyes guileless, taking Dean in like he’s something special to watch.
“—right here, if you would just talk to me,” Alicia finishes, hefting her backpack onto one shoulder. “Really humanizing, by the way. Thank you for that.”
Dean tries waving his free hand back at Cas, but the angel is staring pointedly at nothing, the retreat brochure crumpled tightly in his fist.
anything to me?”
Dean thinks back to the office, which already feels like a lifetime ago. Could he imagine that version of Cas saying he was happy there? Could he imagine himself, knowing what he knows now, saying the same?
Dean glances across the bow of his arm, confirming once again that Cas isn’t peeking. Assured, he continues to strip out of his shirt and jeans, his footing briefly stumbling when his ankle hooks on a pant leg. He slips on a clean undershirt and keeps on the same boxers, figuring it’s worth waiting until morning before swapping out for a fresh pair. Maybe Sam and Rowena will have a solution by then.
, not
Nat laughs, phlegmy. “You know him. Just spits them out the back seat and drives off again.”
“You didn’t?” If anything, Castiel sounds more heartbroken now than he did upon learning he missed Jack’s birthday.
Can’t think of Cas, smiling through the tears.
When trays of beers and nacho platters start making the rounds, the couple from New Mexico call everyone to join in a round-robin pool tournament they’re organizing. Despite their jovial promises to keep it casual, Donnie learns quickly to never bet a dime against any one of them—the entire crowd seems comprised of well-practiced pool sharks, the games playing out with a ruthless efficiency that inevitably favors whoever broke the rack.
“Before or after the leviathans tore me apart?”
Val raises her chin, angling out with confidence. “Back section, by the eggs and dairy.” She heads out, pointing them down the correct path to take.
Dean makes a sound that catches in his throat. It takes a while for him to collect himself. “Didn’t know you had a Led Zeppelin tape,” he says roughly.
“Ach, no,” Rowena proclaims. “I’m the one who will curse every last hair off your head if you keep bothering him about such ancient history.” To Sam, she tilts her head upward, inviting a kiss. “I’m the only woman for you, aren’t I, Samuel?”
Castiel waves back at her before squaring his shoulders, leaving with a flap of his wings.
“So what’re we signed up for?”
Lost in thought, Castiel stepped out from the bathroom, and was so distracted that he nearly walked into Dean.
The crowd erupts in a raucous cheer. Rowena pushes her way through the swarming attendees and mounts the podium, planting a lipstick kiss on Cas’s cheek. Sam performs a perfunctory golf clap, and Dean wonders whether anyone will notice if he throws himself into the lake.
Cas can’t be back, can’t be here, standing here—
“Another
“You okay?” Dean murmurs. His head lifts a little, though not enough to see much of anything, this time of night.
“Nothing.” Dean’s brows lift, mouth twisting, impressed. “Just didn’t take you for a guy who cooks.”
“You’re sick,” Castiel tells him, hauling Dean up onto his feet. “Here, put on your jacket. I’m taking you to a hospital.”
“You okay?” Dean said softly, his gaze hooded and heavy.
How Dean stumbled into growing a garden was apparently by accident. He certainly hadn’t set out to start one. Something as permanent, as helpless, as a garden really wasn’t part of his nomadic style.
Castiel turns around quickly, as if he’s been caught. “As long as you water it. It should have enough light.” He rubs his fingertips together, working at the remnants of dirt on his skin. “Make sure to deadhead it, to get it to flower again.”
In spite of himself, Dean doesn’t want to let him go.
He just wants to know that Cas needs him as badly as Dean needs him. Needs to know that he means something to Cas, even if it’s not in the same way Dean wants it to be.
Sam curses. “Damnit, Dean. Pull yourself together.”
Dean bites his lip and nods appreciatively.
How long…?
“Not far enough, in my opinion,” Rowena murmurs, saluting with her glass of wine.
The whole thing is too domestic for Dean’s liking, somehow seemingly normal despite the subject matter, and the situation being so bizarre. He ends up needing a breather and walks back to his baby. Dean lies down along the front seat, turns the key enough to play a cassette. He listens to Zeppelin with his eyes closed, breathing in familiar leather scents.
“Oh, good.” Adler breathes out a sigh, and Dean can hear the smile in what he says next, even as it makes Dean’s own grin disappear. “Thank you, Dean. Rest assured, it’s only temporary. The new SA will be starting right away, but without Bart there to train him, we’ll need you to step in—”
“We’re good,” the queen agrees. To Cas, she says, “I will see you again should we need another sapling.” With a coquettish look to Dean, she adds, “Have fun with my husband, oh lover boy.”
Chuck sighs, clasping his hands together, and saunters past them, heading straight for Jack. “Gotta hand it to you, kid. Waking up everybody in the Empty? Phew. I would’ve never thought of it if it wasn’t for you.”
The retreat turns out to be buried deep within one of Wisconsin’s endless forests, the dirt road belching them out into a tiny meadow reminiscent of every shitty campground John ever took them to as children. At the far end of the parking lot a sunny welcome sign directs visitors to the check-in building, which reveals itself to be a nightmarish mix of rustic-meet-snobby-minimalism, all high-end chrome and polished cement with log cabin walls. A few cars are already parked near the entrance, while a few more drive in after them. It has the makings of a busy weekend to come.
Dean knows, intellectually, that defects are still coming in. That the implementations team is still passing them impromptu updates. That products is still scheduling more work than he and Miriam alone can bear. He knows this is all happening—he can sense how the rest of legacy thrums with life around him—
Cas blinks, and before he’s had a chance to even process it, Dean loudly blurts out, “No.”
, to which Sam shoots back,
“Maybe you could have.” Castiel’s smile fades. “Heaven knows I couldn’t.”
“When I couldn’t,” Cas continues, lips trailing across Dean’s cheek, “I thought I had found a loophole. That to be close to you, to love you at a distance, it would be enough.”
“Oh.” Dean’s heart pounded like thunder. “So.”
Wriggling in his seat for emphasis, Dean rubs his shoulder pointedly into Castiel. He ends up jostling into both him and Miriam, who grumbles as she pushes away. “Aw, come on, you guys, grow up. Stop acting like children,” she proclaims, so Dean makes a point of leaning more on her side of the bench seat. Miriam counteracts with a sharp elbow jabbed into Dean's side.
Dean’s not an idiot. He knows he’s kind of kept to himself after Sam left, living in his work and not much else. He closed down, kept things simple with his vision narrowed. But Castiel makes him think maybe he can open up again.
Claire rolls her eyes again, her snark dampened by the handful of fries she’s shoved into her mouth. With chipmunked cheeks, she wipes her hands and slips off the tailgate, motioning for Dean to follow. “C’mon, I’ll show you.”
“It’s been… overwhelming,” Castiel says eventually. He breathes out roughly on an elongated exhale.
The girl shakes her head and murmurs, “Damnit, Cas, you had one job …” Back to Val, she asks, “Are pre-made pie crusts anywhere around here?”
Maybe Castiel has a chance to make things right between them yet.
Castiel ducks his head, smiling at the snow trails kicked around his feet. Snowflakes gather on his lashes, in his dark hair. Dean scuffs a hand through Cas’ hair, ruffling it, prompting Cas to nudge him playfully and tousle his hair in response.
Dean arrives late to work, again, his hair shower-damp but otherwise styled, mindset somewhere between electrified and frazzled. His alarm went off too many times this morning, the snooze button revisited more often than his accustomed fare.
to leave, then Castiel will have to let Dean win this round.
Ash frowns. “You can do that?”
“Hey!”
“I haven’t seen you in months,” Cas said quietly, putting aside his bowl. “I was hoping for one last time, before you moved on and forgot about me.”
Maybe if Cas had told him, Mary would still be alive.
It hit Dean then that Cas was probably sitting alone in his own room, having only just realized that he’d missed out on grabbing his supplies but too stubborn to come over and ask for them, even if he needed a toothbrush and a change of clothes before the night’s end.
“Hey.” Dean touches Castiel’s shoulder, the skin there warm. Lets his hand slip upward, fingers carding through dark hair. Even though fear begs him to shut his mouth, he whispers, “What’s wrong?”
Thundershowers slide in one night and linger, stranding them indoors for a couple days. Since the rest of them are at full health and planning a comeback, Dean finds himself alone with Cas for the duration of their downtime, cornered in the bedroom on their separate beds. Cas is awake for once and fumbling his way through research. His lingering cough sets the laptop he’s borrowed swaying atop his chest.
The hand has gone from banging cabinets to rummaging through drawers. “M’ coffee maker,” Dean mumbles, squinting through mostly-closed eyes. “‘S not where I remember putting it.”
Dean rubbed his hand over the sheets, briefly savouring the coolness of the fabric. Then want surged up within him, and he was then pressing himself tight against Cas, rolling the both of them onto their sides as he kissed Cas again.
“Cool.” He motions his chin toward the Impala. “Walk, carpool, or solo drive?”
The boy. Jack. He’s figured out that much, based on photos and logs between corresponding texts.
Dean blinks, and suddenly the archive room is gone.
They sit side by side on the couch, the living room dimly lit by lamps on the side tables. It’s a cozier space than what they had along the breakfast bar, glances now coming sidelong, elbows close enough to brush together.
It isn’t an answer, though it confirms the worst in what Cas said. A long and silent moment hangs between them, settling like a sheet atop their bodies. Then: “You’re right. I should have told you. About Jack. Maybe if I had…”
“Since before you were getting angry at me,” Castiel replies promptly. His expression softens. “Believe me, I’ve been dreaming of ways to fix BEAU so it’s better for everyone. Especially for you. I just haven’t been—brave. Until now.”
“Come in,” Castiel says without looking up. He sits hunched over a yellow legal notepad, fingers flipping between its pages as he cross-compares notes that he’s made. “Have a seat.” He waves idly at a chair.
Dean relaxed into the thought, trying it on for size. Maybe further time with Castiel could help him accept that.
“So it’s our last day,” Sam says. “Have we gotten anywhere on the case?”
“Can’t find where the sheet ends,” Dean says, muffled. “Looked for the edge, but I couldn’t find it.”
Castiel frowns slightly. “You didn’t know?”
Once Dean has calmed enough to catch his breath, Castiel asks, “So, for your birthday. Did you end up choosing a cake or a pie?”
Cas’ mouth meets his with a bump of teeth, followed by brief pressure and a breathless
on the higher planes.” Sam turns his laptop back around. “What do we all have in common, Dean? You, me, Patience and Claire.”
“Where are we?” Dean asks the empty room.
Rowena settles against Sam, draped like he’s a throne for her to luxuriate upon. She toes off her shoes and dumps her feet into Cas’s lap, earning a startled look on the angel’s face. Dean doesn’t think either of them seem put-out enough by the chaos Rowena summons in her wake.
The closer they get to the meeting, the more Castiel’s absence weighs on Dean like a stone. Were they supposed to get their stories straight before meeting the board? Just how much trouble are they all in?
“I know,” Sam breathes out, harsh and reprimanding. “I didn’t want to bother you guys, but me and the girls are having trouble.”
Castiel knows that necessity better than any angel. He nods sagely, relieved by her confirmation. “Thank you, Ellen. We’ll try again with something else.”
“We’ll see,” Dean says absently, thanking his lucky stars that they aren’t on the same team. He’s going to savor beating Bart’s ass into the ground.
“No,” Cas mumbled, “I suppose not.” He dropped his hand, righting the flashlight back onto Dean’s face. “Are you okay?”
With his eyes closed, Castiel tipped his head forward until the shower was pulsing directly onto the crown of his head. He felt his hair flatten against his brow and his temples. Felt warmth building upon his skin. Water sluiced down his brow and collected into a chaotic stream that dribbled from his chin. When he opened his eyes, the blurry sensation of the water within them made him quickly close again.
help? You, who woke me up—you, who made a mess of everything inside me, who made it
Dean dropped the duffel bags onto the tiles. “Thought you preferred showering.”
Dean pulls up and parks along the shoulder where Claire’s flagging him over, not far off from where Cas and Max have already stopped. Alicia and Patience have wandered past the ditch into the field, standing amid a waist-height tide of ripening wheat softly rolling in the wind. Dean and Sam climb out to see what they’re all looking at somewhere out in the distance.
From the other side of the table, Castiel leans in, hand half-raised, looking at Raphael. “If I may?”
Cas’s face is a mere inch away from his own, now that Dean is standing. When Dean breathes, his whole body squeezes up against Cas.
Dean has maybe an hour alone in his office before there’s a knock on his door. Dean waves the person in without looking, knowing that it’s Miriam by her general presence.
“No, I think it’s Patience’s hoodie.” Cas sits back with the article in-hand. “What are your feelings about salmon pink?”
“A unique case,” Castiel amended. “Your profile was very intriguing.”
How bad would it be if he wrote back—
The queen sweeps her black eyes over Sam, as interested in him as she was in the cut on her hand. “Terribly.”
“Again, it’s not always an emotion, it’s an
into the chaos. Their attention falls to him, one by one.
By time Dean fully comes to, it’s to the sounds of a fight erupting.
“I know,” Cas said. “I’m sorry. They were both—situations like
“Nothing, promise,” Max says, gently brushing his sister’s arm. “How ‘bout we get inside, see what these Winchesters have figured out so far?”
Cas’s hand falls through the pillows beside Dean’s head, crinkling something plastic. Dean breaks the kiss by craning his neck back, trying to land eyes on the culprit. He frowns, uncomprehending, until the sight before him clicks. “Are those
“Right,” Sam agrees. “But with this kind of magic, the witch builds the spell into a token based off an index, some element on these higher planes. Anyone that matches that element gets hit by the spell’s effects, depending on the radius built into the token.”
Dean pauses his fork, swallowing his mouthful. He waits for Castiel to finish his current bite, his expression cloudy and unreadable as he chews.
of the place, and the bunker’s not so different than back home. Ryan still has a schedule, still has duties to keep. Still feels like an interloper, a lamb among soldiers in a war she never signed up for.
“Baby, you’re so beautiful,” Dean murmurs, mouthing at Cas’ cheek, trailing the sharp line of bone beneath his eye. Cas moves a hand to Dean’s neck and holds him in place as he kisses him, his hips dragging against Dean’s belly. Dean gives up his grip on their dicks and just allows Cas to thrust against him, his own cock trapped beneath the weight of Cas’ body, his wet hand digging into Cas’ thick thigh. He mouths along the apple in Cas’ throat, tongue delving out to scrape the stubble, the full column of Cas’ neck now exposed.
Sam coughs, clearly uncomfortable with the silence.
“Presentation,” Castiel supplies.
Alright, so maybe Dean hadn’t looked too good when Cas found him. Maybe Cas was miffed that his injuries got him sidelined while Dean’s own got swept away.
It doesn’t bode well for his position in the bunker. Castiel would’ve thought he’d have more belongings here, if this room were any sort of permanent address for him.
And Dean loves it. If he could keep it like this, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“There is,” Cas answers, “but you’re not going to like it.”
“They’re neniven,” Cas says quietly, keeping his gaze trained on the pair chittering to him. “Relative to glaistigs. Tutelar creatures.”
“Yes,” Michael says, somber.
“This one is totally you,” Garth says, chuckling, as he holds up a shirt reading
Castiel wonders, after the third such endless, instant of communion, whether a perfect answer is even possible. Should perfection be sought in heaven? Human beings, after all, are perfect in their imperfections.
“Well of course, sugar buns!” Garth proclaims, and with deep reluctance, Dean allows his arm to be slung like a doll’s around Garth’s neck, although he draws a line at the forkful of scrambled eggs being airplaned his way.
The hall exits into a modest living room, with a couch and armchair and a flatscreen TV. The sky through the window behind the television is dark, suggesting early evening or shortly after sunrise; Dean assumes it is the former, since the jetlag fogging his head feels like he’s slept through an entire day.
His fingers slipped upon the first of his shirt buttons, shocking him with their tremble, but his touch grew steadier the longer he persisted. When the shirt was neatly folded and piled upon the coat and jacket, Castiel turned to observe himself in the small, now-cloudy mirror.
Uriel exhales heavily. Another long, intermediate moment stretches before he speaks again. “If God is here, then I am happy to know my purpose again. I will do as you ask.”
Dean pulls off the apron, shucks it aside to find the kitchen neatly decorated with streamers and a line of paper letters on a string proclaiming “Happy Birthday”. A two-layered chocolate cake sits atop a silver serving tray. Next to it is a fork and a knife with a paper napkin, the stack of which is tucked in neatly beside a freshly-baked apple pie steaming in a glass pie plate.
Castiel flushes. “I didn’t mean to—I mean, it’s been so long that I’ve been hoping we would—” He swallows down his embarrassment, tentatively joining Dean in his laughter. “Okay. Maybe I’m a little enthusiastic about this.”
Shrugs all around. Sam says, “No idea. We can’t get very far into it before we have to turn back.”
When Monday comes, Dean heads in to work with a mild feeling of trepidation, although he plays his return as casually as he can.
And it was good.
Against Sam’s advisement, Castiel creeps down the halls that night and goes to visit Dean.
“It is his time,” Jack says, gentle. “You have to let him pass.”
“But… are you okay?” Jody says.
Castiel must catch his discomfort, because he adds, “I mean it as a compliment, I promise. It’s good you two are so close to one another.” The soft smile on Castiel’s face tightens, growing brittle. “You could say my upbringing was the opposite of yours. Stable household, but no love lost between me and my siblings.” His voice turns brittle. “My stepbrothers only get in touch when I’ve done something to embarrass them.”
Outside the nest, the bedroom door shut quietly as Castiel returned. Dean felt the cold bottled beverage appear before Castiel himself arrived beneath the blanket. “Drink this, please,” Castiel said, so Dean dutifully drank down half the sports drink before Castiel allowed it to be set aside. The blanket lifted as Castiel reemerged inside, the scent of sex escaping with the gesture. Again, Dean felt horrified at what his body made him do to this poor man, who was only here because Dean was a charity case.
“Yeah,” Dean says, hands fidgeting, mouth dry. He can’t bring himself to say any more.
Low in his throat, Dean growls out, “Don’t.” He kisses Castiel to keep him from speaking again.
Dean exhales through his nose. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen anything like this happen before.”
“No eye contact then. Makes it too ...” Dean huffed away thought, shoving aside Castiel’s gaze. “You know the basics, right?” Dean asked, rummaging around the side table for what Castiel presumed was lubricant.
Dean arrives late, his hair sticking out at odd angles, still damp around the collar from his haphazard dash out the door. He hadn’t meant to linger overlong in the shower, but he did, and it devoured his time for breakfast and for shaping up his appearance for work.
“Not angry,” Dean murmurs. “Embarrassed.”
Cas shrugged. He waved his stiff arm limply toward the tub. “My options are currently limited.”
“Uh,” Sam says. “Is she okay?”
Dean does seem different, now that Castiel is standing before him. More settled. Comfortable in his own skin.
“Shut up and sleep,” Dean mumbles.
Growling noises emanate from the screen.
It’s Sam who finds him like that, of course—slumped over in a nook between the bookshelves, winged armchairs pushed askew in his quest to find a corner into which he could collapse. His little brother looms over him with his arms crossed, all six-feet-five-inches of fury scowling down at Dean, laying drunk on the floor.
It was enough. Before Dean could properly adjust to the thought, there came a hot, blunt weight against his hole, and then Cas was pushing his cock into Dean, his breaths stuttering as his chest came to rest along Dean’s back.
“Hey.” Dean tightens his grip on Castiel’s hand. “It’ll be okay. Whatever Michael decides to do, we’re still here here for you.” Dean clears his throat, adding quietly, “I’m still here for you.”
Still giggling, Dean drops his head onto Cas’s shoulder. Cas is jealous? Of
Once inside Dean’s apartment, Castiel remains studious on his box of flowers, as if he might offend Dean by looking intently at his apartment’s layout. He casts subtle glances around, though, ones that Dean might have missed if he weren’t watching Castiel so closely.
From what Dean can tell, observing from afar, Castiel isn’t having a great time with management now that his resignation has been put in.
“That’s what I said,” Anael replies. “So when that didn’t work, Bart gave this really awful performance review, just totally unprompted. Like that would somehow make them believe he wanted Cas back working for him?” She rolls her eyes. “What a shitshow.”
“Singer’s Salvage,” Castiel supplies. “Debating getting your journeyman’s, right?”
The wine rushes to his head as he stands, although he manages to reach his laptop with minimal stumbling. His hip bumps the table as he attempts to sit in its chair. Chatter from the television fills the silence.
By time the hour’s passed, Donnie has all but forgotten the odd phone call he fielded at the start of the evening, at least until a man in a trucker’s cap comes in late with a blonde woman, and the two of them head straight to Donnie to drop off twin stacks of boxed pies. The man extends a hand, calls himself Bobby, while the woman offers up
Softening, Cas gave a small smile. “I’d like to add to it, if that’s okay.”
“Of course.” Dean pushes a smile into his voice. “Oh, and sir? Do you know anything about the new hire? Are they an internal transfer, or did Raph hire somebody from—”
. The girl checks her phone list in between fielding texts from what seems like a hundred different people. It’s only while looking for the more specific party supplies that Val’s memory starts failing, and she begins to lead the blonde astray.
The way she says it, with this sober look on her face, makes Val think this advice comes from a personal place. Val does her best to bestow it with honor, nodding like it’s the wisest thing she’s ever heard.
“That I wasn’t there.” Castiel’s expression falls as he says it, puddling into a pout. Dean would say it’s cute if Castiel didn’t look so crestfallen, crushed by missing Jack’s first birthday… Well no,
Castiel hums agreeably. “This bakery also makes an excellent strawberry rhubarb, if you like that sort of thing.”
Excuses, excuses, and they all know it. Dean hangs up the call later with their worried faces etched into his mind.
“Are you even better?” Let me feel your forehead.” Castiel reaches out his hand.
“This,” Castiel says, “is where Jack was born. Where Kelly… died, and...”
Dean snorts. “If you can dodge a wrench…”
“Well, the retreat’s for supernatural couples looking to rekindle with their human partners. Her cousin’s girlfriend is human,” Garth adds, as if it weren’t obvious. “He was trying to get her comfortable with his lycanthropy.”
A couple pillows are stacked at the foot of the sofa, resting atop a blanket that has been folded messily into squares. Behind the sofa lies a breakfast bar with two chairs tucked beneath it, beyond which is a modest-sized kitchen, furnished in dark metallic shades.
“Believe me, you’re better for it.” Hank flourishes his pencil, dropping a 7 down into the center sudoku square. “Now, have you settled yet on your editorial? Because you might want to consider something more close to home, not whether your subject’s gonna come with a Pulitzer Prize.”
.” He waved his hand up and over his body. “My superiors at Alpha Services don’t really like that I’m doing this with you. They expressed concerns about my—priorities. And when
That question brings with it several more, like—why did Castiel volunteer to look out for him, bringing Dean into his home to recover? It’s not like their office has a great health plan, sure, but Cas could’ve easily dumped him at a hospital and be done with it, leaving Dean to whatever bills his dumb ass incurred for being reckless with his cold.
Gail and Indra take a visible step back.
Dean abandoned his shopping basket in an instant, his heat needs a problem for his future self. Right now he was determined to see Cas, everything else be damned.
Castiel shifted. His shoulders rose, then slumped. “I don’t want to upset you.”
Ruby seems uncomfortable with the trappings of heaven, as mundane as her surroundings are in the garden. She tugs at the sleeves of her leather jacket and plops down on the ground, leaning her elbows on her crossed legs. Her shoulders are tense, her gaze cast asunder. “Don’t really know what I’m doing here, Cas.”
“Jerk,” Sam says, sighing.
Cas pulled back, giving a glassy-eyed look around the room, and Dean’s belly flopped at the loss of contact. He helped Cas back to the bundle of covers on the couch, spotting the glass of water on the coffee table a beat before Cas himself managed to. Dean touched the side of the glass, found it to be room temperature. Cas probably hadn’t been keeping up on his fluid intake.
“Doesn’t feel like nothing.” Dean touched his forehead. “You drinking enough? Did you eat anything today?”
But Sam is shaking his head. “Listen. Just try to get your strength back, okay? We’ll catch you up about—well, everything—when you’re feeling better.”
Castiel wanted to know what it felt like to be so connected to another person. How humans could have such limited insight into their own minds and bodies, and yet such shallow physical sensations resulted in such deep fonts of joy.
Sam sips at his drink without looking up from his laptop. “I think Claire’s onto something when she says it’s affected by the weather. I took a look at the routes you’ve been driving, checked how they’ve updated after Patience’s transcribing. The perimeter remains roughly the same shape, but it shifts with the direction the wind is blowing that day.”
Just a bit.
“Didn’t stick around to see it, but I can imagine.” Dean sobers, smile drawing thin. “Why didn’t you tell me what he was doing to you? Before you left.”
Please,
“What is this?” Dean blurts, stumbling to a halt not six feet out from the family diner’s parking lot.
is cheating on you with his own
“Hey now.” Sam turns on Jack for that, assuring him, “You know that isn’t true.”
Gently, Castiel coaxes Dean to look up at him through tear-blurred eyes. He smiles at Dean, cradling his head in his hands, and says, solemn, “The world is lucky to have you. Do not doubt that for one second. ”
“The appointment today,” Cas said. “I called in sick to work. My assistant would have cleared everything off my calendar. I didn’t even know it had been booked until you called me about it.”
“You remember last month,” Castiel says, a few bites in. “The CAB meeting over that production bug?”
The boy narrows his eyes at that, head twitching through a waylaid comment. His lips shine when he licks them, and then he leans in, all business. “You saying there’s strange vehicles in town?” He looks around, as if suspecting they’ll all roll out from the fields as one unit.
“I should’ve said something to you,” Dean croaks out, scarcely loud enough to hear. “Before it took you. I would have. I meant to. I just—” Dean swallows, his throat clicking. “I didn’t know how quickly you’d be gone.”
“What? Oh. Just wait.” The rustling sharpened again; Dean took it to mean that Cas was looking for something. “I see it now. Meg must have…” Cas trailed off, his voice becoming a groan, scarcely muffled by what must have been his shoulder.
The central djinn locks eyes with Dean. She does not flinch back, not even as his hand closes around her neck.
Of course Bart can still run circles around Dean, just like old times.
. It says
on the website’s main page.
Castiel hummed. “Good. We’ll rest, and when you’ve fallen asleep I’ll bring you supper.”
Down from stubbled skin to jaw.
“No,” Sam admits. “But the memory loss, the family not remembering Rebecca saying she was going on this search? That fits. So maybe she only seemed like the right target for the abductor, right up until it realized she wasn’t.”
He crawls into bed with the smell of woodsmoke still in his hair.
Their usual routine, for one—dress as Feds, question the cops, visit the witnesses—is next to impossible thanks to the nausea-inducing barrier around the city. The only county office that lies outside the weird perimeter is Water Resources, with runner-up status going to the Highway Department. The latter sits close enough to the perimeter that Claire wagers they could visit there in-person, provided they only hang out inside for ten minutes or less. Not that the highway cops would have any useful information.
“Oh, god,” Miriam murmurs, “they’re taking us to a body farm. They’re going to murder us and bury us, for science’s sake.”
“Icebreaker games?” Dean asks, uncomprehending, as Garth jostles his arm and squeals, “Icebreaker games! C’mon, honey, let’s ditch our bags and get back here pronto.”
Dean sighed heavily through his nose. He didn’t want to think about it, but there was no point in sugarcoating it. Castiel was a professional; Dean felt he should know what it’s like for the majority of them that can’t afford Alpha Services’ specialties.
They might not be able to make a dent in this case, but that won’t stop them from scratching every last surface on the way out.
that counts. Gauging by the looks on the competitors’ faces, exactly no one listens.
“It’s a halo,” Dean repeated. “Already got that. Now hit me.” He threw out his arms in a blocking position, squinting. It was full dark now, and difficult to look at Castiel with the truck headlights burning to either side of him.
“It’s the bacon bacon bacon hangover burger,” Claire says cheerily. “By the look of you, you needed it.”
Cas reached across the island, plucked a tomato from the fruit bowl. “These aren’t store bought. They’re too small.”
As much as he was enjoying laying beside Cas, Dean sighed, wanting more. He wanted Cas’ hands on much more pressing places of his body.
“It’s not ready yet,” Castiel says, gesturing vaguely around the kitchen. “I’m slow at this, as usual.”
Carefully, Max unfurls the top of the bag. A whiff of sour feelings hits the room, though with a complicated hand gesture from Max it somewhat dissipates. He pulls a piece of torn leather out from the bag, turns it over between his palms. “What was this, and why did you destroy it?”
Without further pleasantries, the meeting begins.
Dean looks down through the hallway door, to where his mom’s looking up at him with a wild form of worry. He waves her off from the disorienting journey into the—room. Field. The room-field. “Don’t bother, the angle’s not worth it.” Dean gestures north. Up. “Try the upstairs door, see if it’s any better.”
“Resting?” Dean tries to rise again, pushing up on an elbow. He orients himself by the dull glow of a bottle on the nightstand. Across the gap between the beds he sees Cas, propped up by pillows and dozing, his arms across his torso above the covers. He’s been stripped of his trench coat and suit jacket, the dress shirt and tie too. The remaining undershirt is dotted with dried blood, and otherwise soaked with sweat.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says again, though it’s too late to even try to make amends. Dean doesn’t need any more of the pittances he’d share.
“Oh.” Dean feels his thumb brush skin a moment before he drops his hands from Castiel’s hips, stepping back hurriedly. “Sorry. Yeah. Uh.” He scratches his head, clears his throat. His attention turns toward the rest of their team. “Next up.”
Dean rubs a hand down his face, then scrubs it back through his hair. A harsh breath blows out his nose, as he counts backwards from ten.
Then it comes time for Castiel to meet with the last of the Empty’s new arrivals. Castiel motions her over to his favourite place in the garden, at the bare patch of earth tucked between the peonies.
Castiel swallows thickly around the trepidation he feels, now that he is knocking at Dean’s door.
Castiel jolts like he’s been thrown into ice water. His hand freezes. His cock throbs against his palm.
Inhaling deeply, Castiel makes the decision to enter Dean’s private workspace.
Castiel shuts his eyes against the Shadow’s encroachment, swallowing thickly. Its teeth graze the tendons in his neck. “I’m here to help you,” he says quietly, and the Shadow laughs. And laughs. And laughs.
Dean snorts, unsurprised. “You know where stuff is. Help yourself.” He turns around in his chair, hand waving in the general vicinity of the kitchen.
Christ, Sammy, lay off,” Dean grumbles, crossing his arms. “It’s just a runny nose.”
Dean whistles sharply. “Fuck, this is fancy.” He selects a bag of crackers and tears into it, devouring them by the handful.
“That way,” Dean slurs, waving his arm in a wide arc.
“Works for me.” Dean hefts the duffel across one shoulder and slams the car shut behind him. He tosses Sam the keys, leaving him to grab the cooler from the trunk.
Castiel sighs, lips parting as he inhales, and Dean braces himself for the same arguments he’s already thought up. Except Castiel takes it a step beyond what Dean’s expecting.
“Right,” Pamela says. ”That’s how it should be. It shouldn’t matter how much I wanna sit in your lap—” she guffaws loudly, briefly losing herself “—not that I want to. But it shouldn’t happen. Both people should want to be doing their best.”
All of his worldly possessions.
“Yeah, well, none of it does. Join the club.” Dean shakes his head.
Jack ends up beating him down the stairs. He runs for Cas although he does not hug him. His smile beams bright enough for all of them. “Are you back?” Then, frowning: “How are you back?”
But this is Cas. He texts horrible puns and adds stupid emojis to his messages. He drinks tea from a cowbee mug and makes soup when Dean gets sick. He offers quiet reassurances to the team and goes the extra mile, trying to ensure that everybody is looked after and not dealing with too much stress.
“Or something else? I mean, we gotta keep our batting average up somehow...”
The porch looks out into a small clearing in the brush filled with flower beds growing wilder than the smaller beds in front of the farmhouse. The trees here are cultivated into neat rows, the beginnings of fruit growing on their branches. Between the trunks, white boxes buzz with what Dean assumes are colonies of honey bees.
But Cas hasn’t called. Hasn’t contacted Sam or any of their friends about him. Hasn’t tried to check up on Dean. Cas just left, and he’s had a decent enough time away from Dean that he has no reason yet to cave.
“Nothing,” Dean says absently, fiddling with the format of their report. “You?”
Cas frowns, his lips parting. Firmly, he says, “That night, I shouldn’t have left you—”
“Like herding cats,” Castiel mumbles.
"Ugh." She grimaces and accepts the hug he forces on her, going so far as to pat him on the back before pushing him away. "Okay, enough of the feelings. The day has barely begun and I’ve already had my fill."
“I am,” Castiel says, gaze evading Dean, “but in the afternoon I try to lower my caffeine intake with tea.”
Sam winces. “I don’t want to make things uncomfortable.”
Since he came here with Kelly Kline.
The small, soft joys of life are precisely what he must bring into heaven. Castiel mustn’t forget the details. If heaven someday captures even a fraction of the unbridled joy residing in his heart, Castiel will count himself an accomplished man.
“Hm.” Dean rubs a hand along the ridges of Cas’ ribs, feeling out the wire-taut cords of muscle, the smooth planes of skin beneath his shirt. “Thanks.”
“She can return to legacy early too.”
fucking awful,” Dean says loudly. “I’m a goddamn delight.”
But then Castiel comes out from hiding when Dean is nearly out the door, the elevator kicking open.
Clearing his throat, Dean leans back in his seat. "Good. S’ good."
Castiel feels so warm and full, he cannot help the kiss he places onto the back of Dean’s neck.
With an effortless extension and release, Cas throws the caber overhand. It sails through the air like an arrow, flying over the tree tops at the far end of the pitch. Dean cranes his neck, his ears peeled for any sound of contact, but not even the supernatural among them can estimate whether the log ever reaches the ground.
Castiel freezes. His arms fall limp at his sides.
Castiel looks to Dean, a question in his eyes.
Knowing that it isn’t real means nothing to Dean. It still feels like fish hooks pulling loose from his skin, the effort of leaving Cas and his dream self behind.
on the function of the legacy project: what they do and how the system works; what kind of information Castiel will need to gather in order to keep dev working on their update requests; what analysis he’ll need to provide to help QA keep their maintenance operations running smoothly.
Would’ve thought that Dean would have been happier, too. To see him again.
Cas, his smile growing, shook his head. Dean took the incentive and helped Cas up, let him crowd in close. Cas touched his fingers, then his lips, to the cut on Dean’s forehead. “That’s something I can do.”
Castiel hums. “I’m not sure how, but she was able to merge a fix for almost every bug in one code commit. It has unfortunately made a code review necessary.” He looks at Dean. “Tell me if you hate the idea, but what do you think of becoming the assistant dev on BEAU? I know it’s not as glamorous as lead, but if Miriam takes on the bulk of the work, and Inias gets switched back to our regular legacy work, then you’d be available as backup to either project.”
“Hey,” Dean said, pushing his knee into the mattress. “Supper time.”
Sighing, Castiel nods. “Right. Okay.”
The resulting sensation was … pleasant. A gentle kneading of tiny droplets against his flesh. It was nowhere near the orgasmic sensation Castiel had thought it might be, considering how frequently Dean had moaned whenever he first entered a hot shower. It was a disappointing revelation, though Castiel would shoulder through it. An orgasm was the point of this experience, after all.
“Long enough to announce her position to the world,” Dean replies. He heard that part of the plan enough times, too.
"Maybe," Dean hedges. "If, y'know—we're not both busy."
Not his finest hour, maybe, but Donnie’s always been good at handling surprises. Birthdays aren’t in his usual business repertoire either, but the bartender life is nothing but unpredictable and Donnie considers himself adaptable. Once he found out who the party was for, well … It would be his pleasure to give Dean’s family a place to celebrate his day.
Dean’s bed.
“That’s not my—” Dean shakes his head. “Wait—no. I remember. P&I.”
There is a boy in many of the photos. Early twenties, but maybe younger, judging by his guileless smile. Sometimes he is posed with Castiel beside him, arms swung fondly around each other. Other times the boy is in photos by himself, smiling proudly at the phototaker.
Fuck. He just hopes Cas makes it out of this okay.
“I’m angry, yeah,” Dean musters eventually. “That you didn’t tell me about Jack. That Jack—and then Mom—”
Cas rested his hand atop Dean’s hand on the counter. “Is there anything I can get you right now, besides a top-up?” He reached for Dean’s mug, their fingers brushing together.
Castiel scoffs. “And here I thought the whole point of having an analyst is to allow you developers to work without worrying about big-picture decision-making.” He faces Dean forthright and says, firm, “If Bart was bothering you about decommissioning legacy—something even Michael hasn’t signed off on, by the way—then he was overstepping his bounds by a mile.”
Nat nods sharply at them, their armfuls of sugar water and potato chips, and hefts herself up with her cane. “Already paid for,” she says, brusquely slicing through their offers to talk. To the brother, now back on darling’s driver’s side, she offers him a feeble wave. “Happy birthday, kid.”
Dean shrugs. “No monsters, no body count. Doesn’t seem like too dangerous a case.”
Suzie nods once at the boy, when he glances to her guilelessly. She drags a scratchpad out from her pocket and looks between him and the man in the trench coat. “What flavor, what number, and what time,” she says, and the two men begin filling her in on the details.
“Good.” Dean whips him playfully with the towel. “You should. The heat in this place is great.”
Dean’s pretty sure Cas doesn’t need to stay late either. He just stops by when he sees Dean’s light is on and asks whether he’s interested in eating at some place Dean’s never heard of, Cas seemingly having dreamed up a different restaurant for every day of the month. Most times Dean agrees with whatever Castiel has suggested and heads out with him to the place they chose together.
Castiel’s tie is crooked, swept loose from its collar.
Dean bristles at the reminder, the flash of the camera as Dean was carted away. Only idiots would pick a fight mid-season at a gay bar, but apparently Dean is one of them.
“No, that’s not what I…” Castiel clams up, jaw flexing. His hands tighten again on the wheel.
Dean’s not an expert, not by a long shot, but when he squints and tilts his head just right, he can see how local landmarks might've made their way onto the paper, and he might just understand the weird, uneven scribbles of the puke perimeter criss-crossing over them. It’s a decent system, considering their limitations, and that Patience is neither interested nor trained in cartography, just stubborn enough to ensure her hard work isn’t wasted. Claire, however, doesn’t have the same enthusiasm for it, not when they’re on the road trying to get information down quick, so she gets around the information wipe by drawing digital foot trails down the streets where their stomachs flip.
Twenty-six families that have been left hanging, perpetually wondering what happened to that gap-tooth grin or bowl-cut that they used to tuck into bed. They’ll never know whether little Tommy ever really needed those braces they were trying to save for, or if Suzie ever grew into those ears. Answers will never come for these kids or their loved ones. Time got up and left them all behind.
“Is that—” Patience begins, eyes widening.
“You promise?” Dean murmurs.
“You wouldn’t be in the way,” Maggie chides, her grin returning. “I seem to remember you throwing some mean right hooks, both back home and back there.” Her chin lifts back toward the hall they just came from.
Castiel rolls his eyes and holds tightly onto Dean, their hands sealed together as they cross the icy parking lot.
“He okay?” Dean murmurs, his breath stirring the hair by Cas’ temples. Cas smells like sweat and stale shampoo, a deceptively earthy scent.
Dean’s not going to make it easy for Castiel to get rid of him.
His face softens. “Yeah, no, I get it.” He shuffles a moment, deciding. “You’ll call her to tell her I’m coming?”
Miriam and Dumah line up against each other, followed by Bart versus Indra, and Zach versus Dean. After a couple times through the line, Zach begins huffing with each throw, his shirt tails coming untucked and hanging loosely from his waist. Raphael placidly watches them all, updating the tally on the white board each time a hatchet manages to land.
“I should head home now,” Dean says loudly, snatching up their plates. He studiously avoids Castiel’s gaze. “Thank you for supper.”
Dean blows out a loose breath, grinning. “S’close, but I should be able to handle it.” He looks over Castiel, expression shrewd. “Just how long have you been sitting on this idea?”
The note reads:
. The case.”
A few grinding thrusts later and Cas quickly followed, his knot catching as he began to come. Fresh slick rushed out from Dean in response, and Cas hissed something filthy in answer, mouth pressed tight against the scent glands in Dean’s neck.
