He stomps over and snatches the jar. Shoves it back on the shelf hard enough the other glasses clink together.
“Dean. Everyone we know could probably kick our asses. Does it ever stop you from worrying about them?”
He doesn’t want Cas to become one of those people, a regret to carry with him for the rest of his miserable life.
Dean might have finally fucking cracked, but he ain’t going to whine about it in some diary for his shapeshifting shrink.
and then flitters off to whatever ‘big picture’ business she’s orchestrating, leaving them sat on their thumbs all over again.
That hasn’t changed. Dean has watched more friends die than he’s had haircuts, and it doesn’t make a damn bit of difference. Lee might have managed to get out, to leave every aspect of the life behind, but Dean can’t. He’s been pulled along by these puppet strings for so long he wouldn’t know how to do anything else.
He’s saved from having to make any big decisions when Sam skulks into the kitchen looking miserable as sin. Sam didn’t push him about Cas, so he doesn’t push about Rowena. That doesn’t mean he can’t play up the obnoxious big brother role to get Sam’s mind on something else.
The bartender, Evie, seems friendly enough and when Dean asks after a game she directs them to a man named Pax with no hesitation. Pax is a well built dude with a confident air about him, but he doesn’t seem overtly threatening.
He was right; however they ended up where they did when they did, they usually managed to help folks out, save lives. If God wants to break out every ghost and demon they ever sent to Hell, they’ll damn well find a way to shove them back in the hole.
“Nothing,” Sam reassures her, hunching his shoulders in that way he thinks makes him look less threatening. Like Jody hasn’t seen him kick in doors, decapitate vamps in one swing. Like she hasn't also seen him fumble a wine glass in his big stupid fingers. “Social call.”
Sam explains the whole thing in stops and starts. The snippets, the flash-forwards, getting worse and worse. Claire and then Donna, and then Eileen. Cas, losing control of the Mark so much sooner than they’d hoped. Dean himself, making a new malak box and locking Cas in, turning hopeless in the process. And Sam, fixed solely on revenge like their Dad before them, and the both of them holed up like common fangers in a filthy apartment, waiting to die at the hands of their friends.
Dean goes straight for him, has his knife out and one zip-tie cut before Eileen comes out of friggin nowhere and clobbers him from behind. He rolls over and up with the momentum from the drop, but he loses his bowie along the way and Dean really doesn’t want to hurt Eileen when she’s clearly in distress; shaking her head and mouthing
They have no lore books in the car except a few journals, and he’s been through dad’s and Bobby’s enough to know they never went up against the manifestation of luck herself. They’ll have to comb the interweb, and even Sam’s psychic wifi signal doesn’t get bars way out here.
Cas measures out the rockrose while Dean slices into the biggest fleshy tentacle. It’s tough, rubbery, and when it does finally give under the scalpel blade it smells of old blood and rotten meat. Inside is lined with small, black seeds.
“I’m not without doubts myself,” Cas says, measured. “But it might be our only chance to stop Chuck. And Jack believes this is the way.”
Dean moves first, gets a few good licks in before Lee shoves him into the table. He grabs Lee round the shoulders and throws him across the room, goes down after him for the pin. He doesn’t think about how close the straddle is to anything else they’ve done before and punching him in the face is a good distraction.
then curls into herself and stares blankly out the window. Cas slides into the passenger seat, shoulders tight.
They burn through hunts quicker than they have in years, with no impending doom hanging over them, and for four weeks they basically live on the road again.
They bury the kid and pack up in silence. They’re more than half way back to the bunker before Sam’s sulky window-gazing forces Dean to break the tension.
But somewhere down the line, in between catastrophes and probably longer ago that he will admit, Dean fell ass over tea kettle in love with a male-shaped angel and suddenly it matters a whole lot. Their chances are admittedly still pretty dicey, but if they do actually live through this mess, if they get any kind of shot at a happy ending… Cas is it for him.
Dean puts his gun away, too. His heart rate has settled again, now he’s just kinda offended by the shade of green on that awful little car.
Since this is now around 10,000 words long, with the next 5000 drafted, and the main pairing haven't so much as been in a room together yet, Imma go ahead and tag this slow burn.
Dean’s itching out of his skin by the time he gets back, enough that he resorts to straight up scrolling his national news app. No animal attacks, no missing organs, no weird bites.
“What now?” someone asks, and someone else answers, “Let them stew for a while,” but Dean hears it like he’s in a tunnel, echoed and hollow, and he can’t tell who is who.
Purgatory always did burn right through Dean’s BS, stripped away the simmering anger in his gut and the constant doubt in his head.
“God lied to me,” he says, before they’re even through the doorway. “I gave everything for him, I loved him. Why? I’m not even the only Michael.”
Michael doesn’t have a plan, but he wants to help, he says. He had a few ideas, he says, avenues to explore.
“Well what now,” Dean says, steels himself and steps forward. Takes the chance. “You’re not gonna dust us.”
It’s nice to catch up with Donna after all the shit that’s gone down recently, so they hang around for a few days. Sam cracks a smile or two that don’t look painfully forced and Dean is self-aware enough to know he doesn’t drink as much Johnny Walker if he’s already full of doughnuts.
, which is ridiculous even for him, but she doesn’t overreact, just keeps up that steady gaze and nods ever so slightly to show she's listening. “He- Well, he didn’t take it well,” he huffs a laugh,
The day after that, Dean charms the lady at the B&B into giving them free breakfast, and Sam somehow finds a wifi signal even though they’re in the middle of fucking nowhere.
She smiles at him. It feels a little indulgent, the kind of smile you give the kid who wants to grow up to screw caps on toothpaste tubes.
He’s snappy in a way that doesn’t suit him, and Dean can’t decide if it’s because he’s tired or because Dean’s never turned him down before. Kinda blowing his own trumpet, but he knows he’s a good lay. Either way, Lee waves him off, goes back to the window.
He drops one last clear vial into Dean’s arms, like a witchy mic-drop, not that he needed to after that low fucking blow. Sam lets the heavy silence stew for a moment, then says;
He tries, but he can’t switch off. It’s not new; he’s been plagued with dreams of drowning since Michael, of seeing his hands, brutally efficient, through a haze of grey and not being able to stop; dreams of waking up in a box, in a grave,
But there are blips, enough that Dean can’t be sure - he’d shacked up with that woman and a dog while Dean was in Purgatory, he’s talked a few times lately about meeting someone else in the life. If this is the epilogue of their story they really should discuss their long-term options, except Dean doesn’t know how to bring it up without sounding pathetically needy.
“But guess what?” Chuck says, soft and mocking. “Just like you, they didn’t think they were gonna do it either. But they did. And you will too.”
“Of course not, but, Dean--” and Dean isn’t getting this pussyfooted approach. They don’t have many options here. Kevin might have been happy to risk the open world, but Eileen clearly isn’t, and who are they to condemn her back to Hell.
Sure, Dean was John’s obedient little soldier back in the day, and nobody knows that better than Lee, but he’s had enough time to come to terms with his daddy issues.
The match drops, the magic flares, there’s a gust of wind and then the cold emptiness of Hell pushes all other thoughts aside.
Chuck’s strings or not, Cas always stuck his lot in with humanity. Chuck’s strings or not, Dean should have asked Cas to stay.
They walk aimlessly for about an hour in no particular direction, just hoping these flowers are gonna jump out at them.
“That,” Garth smiles, then all at once becomes serious again. “And because the Almighty is after you.”
“Not yet,” Sam says, keeps his eyes on Dean’s face until Dean’s stomach is in knots and he finally meets his dumb, earnest eyebrows. “My point is; Cas doesn’t deserve to be miserable forever. And neither do you.”
Swayze’s parking lot at isn’t exactly busy, but the bar itself is packed. Makes sense in a town this small; folks can get hammered and then walk the two blocks home.
Dean takes great care in keeping his voice low when he says, “No, not really,” but she already asleep and everything goes hazy and then Sam bursts through the door and the girl is gone.
Sam has a vague idea that Chuck might be off his game, but they don’t exactly have a play-by-play. They still don’t have a plan, they lost the only weapon they’ve ever known could hurt God, and even if they pull a perfect road-map and a new cosmic-grade weapon outta their collective asses they still don’t know where Chuck is holed up.
Dean tells him he better leave and Don sprints up the stairs in record time, bucket of wings and all.
He just needs a minute alone. Just a few seconds to shake off the emotional overload of the last few hours, get his head back in the game.
Dean drowns his sorrows, passes out for a few hours, then drags himself to the kitchen to eat leftovers and pick up a fresh bottle of scotch. Rinse and repeat.
Dean watches Sam clench his teeth, watches the dimple appear and then disappear on his jaw, and knows where this is going.
. Cas all but falls into him, which they should probably worry about, but right now he’s warm and alive and everything else can wait.
“But it did,” Cas replies, hoists himself up in the chair like he isn’t still panting. “Ruby said the Occultum was never in Hell.”
Dean checks his timer. 3 hours 8 minutes until the portal closes. It took them almost 3 hours to get here.
The conversation has veered wildly off track and this might be the closest thing they get to an actual talk, here in Purgatory where his defences are routinely dismantled, but Dean’s regretting going into it with a leviathan three feet ahead of them.
He’s gonna ignore the dead elephant in the room, he’s gonna swallow down whatever tasteless food they shove at him, and then he’s gonna drink until his brain is as floaty and numb as his body is.
“I don’t know if I can move on,” Sam says, a little manic now he’s started talking about it, arms flailing. “I can’t forget any of them, Dean. I still think about Jessica-  I- I can’t just let that go--”
, and then the scheming bastards kicked his ass in three seconds flat. He got them back in round two, though, unfair advantage be damned.
She toasts them, takes a sip. Doesn’t offer them a drink which is rude, but Dean’s read enough middle-fantasy to know a political power move when he sees one. They’re here not as friends, but as subjects asking for the Queen’s favour.
It’s pale, grey and white and sepia. Washed of colour except for the eyes, the exact shade of blue. It smiles at him, wide and gummy and damp, just like the last time he looked at Dean and it’s too much, he can’t, it’s not--
“Cas thought you were gonna do it, too,” Sam says, because Dean doesn’t feel bad enough about the whole thing already. “And then you
“He wasn’t lying,” Cas says. Sighs. “My grace might be failing but I can still see your soul. The effects of the Mark are faded now, scarred over. But the damage is irreparable. I’m sorry, Dean, but I can do this.”
And just reaching out, quietly in this empty woodland, no guarantee that Cas can even hear him, shatters every bottled up emotion in his chest.
“Whatever,” Dean grunts, rolls his eyes before he catches himself. He’s supposed to be making nice. “Hey, c’mon, man. You been staring at these chicken scratches for days. Would it kill you to take a break.”
He raises his hands, takes the whole place in. And it’s awesome, it really is, but something of shine is missing for Dean after Michael. He couldn’t stay here and trust it, isn’t sure he could stay anywhere reasonably safe and trust it anymore.
Normally, he’d be happy to leave Sam and Eileen to their heaps of dusty, itchy old books and their fancy online translators, he’d find a milk run and disappear for a few hours.
Danjal looked surprised, glancing at Baal who simply nodded and started to walk towards the back door.
"You fools!" Butch barked out, eyes flying open, they were blood shot with a deep, ugly yellow surrounding the tiny pupil. He looked around himself then to the floor at the circle of crystals that surrounded him.
The two men froze at the noise, slowly turning to look at the brute behind them. The Hawaiian native stood tall, muscular against the drugged out men whose eyes turned to the size of moons as they spotted Danjal.
"Come." Jack said to Dean, nodding to Castiel as he placed a hand on the hunters shoulder and vanished.
Chamuel looked at Abel in shock, he hadn't heard that before. The man pushed his hair up from over his face, nodding towards Chamuel.
Chamuel felt a chill skyrocket through his veins as he looked at Abel in horror, “How...would he look the same?” He murmured,
"Christmas," Chamuel pressed his finger against the hunters nose playfully, the man swatted his hand away.
Cas pulls him up by the hair, "Lube. Top drawer. Nightstand." He's breathing heavily as he releases his grip, cock covered in Dean's saliva. Dean reaches into the drawer blindly, grateful to feel the familiar crinkle of condom wrappers beneath a slim plastic bottle. He tosses them on the bed next to Cas before reaching under the smaller man and shoving him further onto the bed. Dean climbs up after him and hovers over Castiel, knees bracketing his hips. Castiel surges up and catches his mouth, licking into it hungrily, arms snaking around his back to pull Dean down onto him, groaning into his mouth as their cocks fit alongside each other. Dean can't stop the way his hips twitch forward seeking friction, wanting to feel that electricity dance through his veins again.
"Thought Mrs. Tran was takin' you to some TEDtalk thing today?" Dean calls through the fabric of his t-shirt as he rounds the corner into the kitchen.
"Get to class, bitch." Dean can't help the grin that stretches across his face as he pulls away from the high school.
Dean knows the place, Charlie has frequented it for years, but he rarely does, just the odd Saturday of Moondor. Cas pulls wrapped sandwiches from the plain brown bag on the counter, handing one to Dean. Scrawled on the paper in black sharpie is the word '
. Castiel isn't here to be ogled or to fulfill some masturbatory fantasy. He just needed somewhere to be. Dean rifles through his drawers, locating the newest pair of pajama bottoms he owns, a Christmas gift from Charlie last year — black with holly leaves and berries, red lettering on the band proclaiming 'Deck thy balls with boughs of holly!' Embarrassing, maybe, but they'll have to do.
"Waking up at four am." Cas kicks his way under the covers, tossing away the sheet he'd been kneeling on. "You're welcome to stay. But I'm going to sleep."
Dean's mid-text when he's startled by a light knock on his passenger window. He can't keep the grin off of his face at the sight of Cas, who looks thoroughly irritated. Dean glances down to see the chrome bar firmly set in the locked position. He leans across the seat to disengage it and pops the door open, illuminating the interior as Cas climbs in. He drops his head back onto the seat, breathing deeply, once the door has closed behind him — he's almost smiling when he (finally) meets Dean's eyes, "Hello, Dean." Damn, he is never going to get tired of hearing his name in that voice.
Dean blushes, but hurries Cas inside anyway. The place is mostly deserted, but he can tell they'd just missed a rather large lunch rush. It's just as kitschy as the exterior promised it would be; there doesn't seem to be a single matching chair, the tables themselves are disparate heights, different styles — it's as if the owner had bought out six or seven garage sales worth of furniture and tchotchkes and decided to justify her decision by designing a restaurant around it. The walls are adorned with old movie posters, bronzed baby shoes, there's a nonsensically-placed, full-sized carousel horse in the center of the floor.
They finish getting ready in companionable silence and constant contact, neither willing to allow the other from within arm's reach after so long a separation. Dean laces their fingers together as Cas turns to lock the door behind them, pulling him close to press lips against his forehead. "I missed the hell outta you," he whispers, wrapping his other arm tightly around Castiel's waist, reveling in the solidness of his presence.
They don't say much, but neither wants to be the one to hang up. Dean's not sure when he fell asleep, but he wakes with his phone still pressed between his cheek and pillow, blaring his alarm in his ear. It's Sunday, Bobby's is closed today, and Dean silences it, rolling over to drift into dreams about smooth skin and gummy smiles.
With Cas pressed against him like this, Dean can feel just how hard he is, can feel the slick head of his cock leaving trails of precome against quivering thighs. He nods weakly, "Yeah, babe, 'm sure."
"I missed you," And Dean doesn't miss the subtle tightening of the arms around his abdomen, or the way Castiel's lips brush his neck in all the right places as he speaks.
Dean sputters, because, technically, she's not wrong. Usually it's only enough to put holes in his shirt, but he can't deny that welding occasionally leaves him with more scorch marks than fabric. Charlie seems to sense his discomfort and changes the subject, steering towards safer waters in the form of Moondor battle plans. They spend another hour planning a siege against the shadow orcs, trying to find attacks that could draw them out of the forest.
Cas seems to get it, and offers him a sympathetic smile. "Come with me, Dean, I'll show you out." Dean follows after him eagerly, glad to be getting away from Gabriel.
have to answer inquiries about her death. That he could just say it and not be bombarded with platitudes and apologies. It's refreshing to know someone who gets it, the down deep sorrow that comes with losing your mother, the way it never really leaves you.
"Generally." 'Cassie's' lips quirk up into a smile, "But you already know all about that, don't you?"
"No way, Cas. I'm not leaving you waiting outside of some strip club for a fuckin' Uber at midnight." Dean sighs, climbing into his car, "Just — let me do this, okay? It'll give me peace of mind."
"Ok!" She's almost too perky for eleven am, "I'll send your receipt right out! Is there anything else I can do for you today?"
Three forty-five finds him on the doorstep of 365b N Claymont street, knocking at the door with his whole forearm. "C'mon motherfucker, I know you're in there!" When the door swings inward, Dean stumbles. He catches himself awkwardly against the frame, and looks up into the thoroughly enraged face of the hottest man he's ever seen.
The party is in full swing by time they arrive, music pouring out of the open door and into the night. Ellen hasn't quite closed the joint down for this, but Dean is still hard pressed to spot a face he doesn't know. He thinks he might even see Mrs. Tran dancing with Garth before he's got Sam and Charlie closing in on him to strap a party hat onto his head. After that the night is a blur of toasts and laughter; dancing to the outdated hits on Ellen's jukebox and drinking the strange concoctions Jo keeps mixing them. Dean's sure he's never had a better birthday - even Gabriel's presence can't bring him down; ( he guffaws loudly as Gabe and Kali waltz past dancing both out of style and off tempo to AC/DC).
Jesus Christ, that's hot. Dean remembers just how sinfully Cas had worked his tongue on other parts of him — the idea of being fucked open with the wet slide of it inside of him has his cock standing at full attention.
"Great. You're due for some good karma." Charlie pats his knee (the one currently unoccupied with his phone) in what he guesses is supposed to be a comforting gesture. "I mean, your last relationship was Lisa, and that went belly up almost a year and a half ago. Plus, I know this Gabriel jackass has pretty much been cockblocking you since last August." Dean opens his mouth to speak, but she hold up a hand to silence him, "Then there was the DUI in March, followed immediately with that sprained ankle, and you catch on fire, like, all the time. Your life is the most depressing sitcom ever."
"It was so weird, Charlie. I mean, it was weird 'cause it wasn't weird, you know?" Dean sighs, "The morning after, I wake up, and he's already working, giving fucking wifi advice in that sex voice he has. There was no real awkward 'I just met you four hours ago and we've already fucked' tension. It just felt... normal? I guess? Like I'd done it a thousand times before. I dunno, it's never been so...
Mrs. Tran drops Sam off at eight that night, and the little shit picks up on Dean's mood immediately, pestering him with questions, "Is there something I should know? You didn't win the lottery, right?"
Castiel rattles off the address, and Dean assures him he'll be there quickly.  "Fifteen minutes, max."
"Tell me what you're doing, Dean." How can he sound so authoritative and yet so desperate? However he's doing it, it's doing things for Dean, and so be obeys, describing every movement he makes, until he can't form words anymore, until the only sounds he can make are, "Fuck," and "Cas," and these breathy little moans that drive Cas wild. He can feel his balls tightening, the way the pool of heat in his groin feels ready to explode, and from the sound of things, Cas is pretty close, too, if his speechlessness is any indication.
, please. Dean watches in anticipation as he rolls the condom on and lines himself up. He lifts Dean's hips and then he's sliding in. Dean feels his calf pressing down on the bone of Cas's shoulder as he acclimates to the feeling, rocking himself lightly when Cas stills, panting, fully seated inside of him.
managed to find the perfect temperature) and presses in close. He can feel the evidence of Castiel's arousal against his thigh as he reaches past him, laying hands on his body wash. With his other hand, he pulls Cas in for a kiss, sliding his tongue in to run against the roof of the other man's mouth. He feels a shiver run through Cas's body before he pulls away, "Let's get you cleaned up before we get carried away."
"C'mon, guys, you don't have to talk about me like I'm not here." Gabriel whines, "I can't believe you're trashing me to your booty calls, Cas."
An hour later, Dean's stomach voices its protests at being neglected. The place he stops probably shares square footage with his apartment, and looks kitschy as all hell, but claims to have the best burgers in the state. Cas grumbles about Dean's bottomless pit of a stomach and pops the trunk to fish a shirt out of his bag. Dean waits at the front of the car, flipping his keys around his fingers, humming lightly. When the trunk slams shut, he looks over, Cas is wearing Dean's ancient Metallica tee, and the warm rush that floods through him when he realizes that Cas had to have consciously packed it is overwhelming. It's an epiphany, the swiftness of it like a punch to the gut;
It's not long before he emerges from the bathroom, back in his khakis from last night, still wearing Dean's shirt. And, yeah, maybe Dean's mouth goes a
"So anyway, Kev got mad that I blew him off, or whatever, which is stupid, since I hang out with him all the time, and it's not my fault Mrs. Tran said he couldn't go."
Dean just pulls the soft tee over his head — a little snug, but it'll have to work — Cas was right, his shirt isn't wearable. "Thanks, man."
is what he was going to say, but it's at that moment Castiel leans forward, flattening his tongue against the slit, and Dean's brain can't formulate words anymore.
?) when Charlie clears her throat. "So that's who you've been texting all night, then? Mr. Tall, Dark, and Dreamy?"
He spits and gargles, rinsing his brush and replacing it next to Sam's orange one. He runs a hand across his jaw, figures he doesn't need to shave today, because who's here to care? He twists the blinds in his room open, finding sweat pants in the low light that filters through. He hears someone rattling around in the kitchen, smells coffee on the air, and steels himself, grabbing a shirt, and putting on a jovial face (there's
He wakes up in an empty bed, an empty apartment, and disappointment washes through him — it's barely seven thirty, and the other side of the bed is already cold. Dejected, he heads back across the hall to the bathroom, not bothering to turn on the light, and starts the shower running. He doesn't care when he's assaulted with frigid water, nor does he care when the water makes a violent switch, heat turning his skin pink. He wants to wash the sour feeling off, the vain expectation that Cas would be there when he woke, the magnetic draw he feels to the man.
He's spent every minute since seeing Cas in his kitchen, his clothes, in a golden glow — he honestly didn't believe it possible, but that golden feeling swells inside of him, so much so he thinks the joy must shine from his skin.
Cas's brow furrows quizzically, head canting slightly left, asking for clarification without the need to stop eating.
Castiel pulls back, and Dean watches as he runs a lubricated hand along his shaft, head falling back as he presses in. In one slow, smooth motion they are as close as two people can become. Cas sets a rhythm with his hips, a slow roll that's surely agonizing for both of them. Dean's dancing on the edge, the feeling of Cas moving bare inside of him almost enough to send him over. Curses fall from his lover's lips as he works his own hips, thrusting up every time Castiel sinks into him, urging him to go deeper, faster, harder. His unspoken request is soon fulfilled, the roll no longer smooth or steady, picking up pace toward unrelenting, catching Dean up in a crescendo of stimulation. Cas shifts them slightly, hitting the spot deep inside Dean that causes sparks to go off behind his eyes, electricity chasing through his veins as he comes violently, clenching around Castiel.
"I'm sure you're gonna tell me." Dean sighs, hopefully it's only a three joke night. Last Thursday, this asshole kept him up until five. Dean hung up on him, and he just kept calling back.
"You were out of, well, everything," Cas continues, stepping forward cautiously, "I was hoping to be back before you woke up."
"I'm also sure that the first weekend of our senior year you talked a very drunk me into skinny dipping in the quarry."
As soon as he closes the drawer, Cas is manhandling him up the bed, taking the bottle from his hands, snapping it open. He squeezes a generous amount into his hand and wastes no time in prepping Dean. He has one leg thrown over his shoulder as he works the second finger in, moving to a third when Dean begins to squirm, panting out praise and profanity. Cas is stretching him open and it's almost too much, he can feel the precome running down the side of his cock, and it takes everything in him not to be patient.
"Need you, Cas," he chokes out, unable to restrain the whimper that escapes him with the declaration, pushing down on the hand inside of him. Cas's eyes darken as he removes his fingers, moving to open the condom when Dean stops him, fingers wrapped tightly around his wrist, "wanna feel
Dean almost drops his phone, because, fuck, Cas doesn't play around. He's busy wrapping his head around the idea that this is actually happening right now when the next message comes in.
He can hear Cas coming apart above him when he pulls off, gripping the base firmly, looking up through his lashes to meet electric blue eyes. Even blown wide with lust, Dean can still sense the love in his gaze and he's hit, once again, with the beautiful truth of his life. It's like a balloon swelling in his chest, the joy that fills him in that moment, the bouyant way Castiel's affection makes him feel. Before he realizes he's moving, he's surged upwards, pressing against Cas, claiming his mouth, pushing him back towards the kitchen, the stairs.
So, yeah, second chapter, y'all. I hope it lived up to expectations. Originally intended the phone sex/sexting to be the night of Gabriel's birthday, and the rest of the chapter to be the movie/lunch date Sunday, but, well, Cas is just one forward motherfucker.
Dean can see the tense line of his shoulders, the way he rushed through the past tense when talking about his mother. "My mom — she used to tell me that angels were watching over me." He can feel Cas swing his focus back to Dean as he continues, "She wasn't really religious or anything, but I remember her saying that to me as she tucked me in at night."
Dean flushes, realizing he'd been unabashedly checking this dude out, in his own kitchen, after waking him up and yelling at him. "You got any beer?"
Castiel tells him about this new Mexican place his friends have been raving over, and Dean agrees to pick him up in forty minutes. They hang up and Dean stares dumbly at his phone, almost disbelieving his luck. The moment is broken by Sam pounding on the door, yelling about consideration when sharing a bathroom. But even the bitchface Sammy throws at him as he leaves the bathroom can't dampen his mood.
Flight 627 out of Houston lands, as scheduled, at nine forty-five. He catches his first glimpse of Cas at nine fifty; tie askew, hair standing on end as though he'd run his hands through it twenty or thirty times, and he's the most beautiful thing Dean's ever seen. The time it takes Cas to walk to the car feel like the longest fifteen minutes of the last three weeks, but he fights the urge to meet him halfway, to sweep Cas up in his arms, kiss him passionately in the middle of the concourse, like they're in a goddamn chick flick. Instead; he pops the trunk, stows Castiel's bag, kisses him chastely; before wrapping his arms around him, reveling in the realness of it, the solid feeling that can't be replaced by any number of hours spent Skype calling.
And, of course the the first thing he does before he fucks off into the aether is to whammy them with the worst No Good Very Bad Day ever.
The family’s kid gets sick, beyond-medical-help kinda sick, and these rich hoarders who can’t take no for an answer turn to a faith healer. An attractive, angelic,
Sam thinks maybe they never could, but Dean remembers the drills with dad, test after test after test, waking up handcuffed to the bed; to the radiator; to each other, until they kept bobbypins in their pockets out of habit and sewed lockpicks in the seams of their shirts and they could pick the cuffs blindfolded, hands behind their backs, and then John’d moved on to padlocks.
This is exactly why he keeps an emergency stash of booze and snacks in his bedroom. Dean has enough beer and jerky to last him a week, but he only makes it about 30 hours before he’s climbing the fucking walls.
Dean reaches for his Blue Label, registers movement by the door and twists to block the jacket from view when Sam barges in, but the door is still closed tight.
“You don’t, Dean?” Lee laughs. “I am you! I’m just you who woke up and saw that the world was broken.”
Sam doesn’t even bitchface at him, which probably goes to show how much he’s struggling to wrap his brain around this new problem.
“Short version? Sammy lost hope and now I’m free,” Chuck smirks. “But hey, take it easy on the kid! Took a lot to beat it out of him.”
Bess takes over, thankfully, and Dean can breathe out again. She bids them goodbye and wishes them good luck and thanks them again even though they didn’t do anything useful except maybe motivate Garth to follow them to Minnesota.
“Merle had one job. Keep you in line,” Billie says. “She failed. We’re playing a big game here, and we’re only as strong as our weakest players. She had to go.”
Sam looks at him like he knows exactly where Dean is stuck on this, and that’s almost worse than Sam not knowing. He says, gently;
Dean digs up as much cash as they have stashed in the Bunker - a little over $800 and most of that will go on fuel. He sends Sam back for all their spare gas cans because they can save almost 30 cents per gallon if they stock up in Kansas, which might scrape them a motel room when they hit British Columbia, and Dean grabs the dregs of food left in the store cupboard.
This won’t help either, but all the things he’s pushed down are bubbling up and overflowing and the tears are coming before he can stop them and suddenly he can’t keep his legs under him, falls to his knees and only keeps from crumbling altogether by clinging desperately to the tree.
“Sure, okay. Detraction it is!” He takes his shot. “Remember that cursed fridge magnet we picked up in Ohio?”
He fumbles a shot, makes it noisy. Stage whispers, “I dunno, Sammy, I might be a little rusty,” and then looks back at the other patrons and cringes like he didn’t mean to speak so loudly.
Cas doesn’t say anything either, they both just look at each other for a long moment, a map of the world between them and it might as well be the real thing for how distant they feel.
Dean pulls Baby into the garage rather than struggle down the stairs with a prisoner. Cas hauls Michael out, starts heading towards the dungeon.
An eternity passes, and then Cas nods very slightly, swallows hard. Dean watches his throat bob and knows he fucked this up again. It’s not Cas’ fault Sam has that stupid bullet wound. It’s definitely not Cas’ fault Dean wasn’t here, wasn’t answering his stupid fucking phone.
Dean turns the grill on to preheat and then rummages through the freezer for the burgers he knows he bought. Fresh made is better, but he really doesn’t feel like going into town for ground beef, so frozen are gonna have to do.
Finally, Purgatory 2.0! Thank you for being patient with me while I wrestled this chapter into submission.
But that's just Dean issues surfacing again, when apparently Adam was just stuck in mandatory couples counselling. They should have been looking for him all along, and how are they even supposed to start apologising for that?
He’s just thinking the poor girl deserved better when he hears the click of a gun, and Lee cold-cocks him.
“You talked to him?” he says immediately, then realises how accusing he sounds, and apologises by answering himself. “Of course you talked to him.”
“Long time ago. His own kind, they didn’t trust him and they,” he makes an awful tearing sound in his throat, “Ripped him apart.”
“’Leave’. ’Get out’. ‘I want you dead’.” Cas shakes his head, looks imploringly up at the ceiling. “We didn’t bond.”
“It. It only jumped a few weeks the first time. We were researching in the library, you and me and Cas and Eileen. Like normal. Only not normal, because there were no cases, like
He sounds disappointed, looks at Dean like he’s got weeks to live. Which is fair, he supposes, because it might be true and it always kinda is with hunting.
Sam is crying by the end, ugly crying. About the possible future Chuck showed him or the uncertain one they’re left with instead, Dean isn’t sure. He’s snotty and gross and gasping in breath between sobs and Dean doesn’t know how to even begin to calm him down.
It’s like the last 12 years have been reversed in an instant, and it’s somehow even worse than that time a witch made him relive puberty.
“Yeah,” he says, because if God gave Lilith orders she must know more than they do about how all this bullshit works. “But that was- that was God too, right? I mean, just another one of his stories?”
“Well,” Cas says, too loudly. Claps Jack on the shoulder, smiles at the kid lopsided and oh so gentle. “We’re not gonna kill God tonight. Come on, we should get some clean sheets for your bed.”
Sammy emerges not long after, hair damp but looking less washed out than last night. He agrees to throw some dinner together outta their emergency pantry while Dean runs out for essentials.
In the years since John died, his candy coating has dissolved a little, piece by piece. He boxed up dad’s old leather jacket and just never got it out again, bought some nicer suits because he likes dressing up sometimes. He covets their kitchen, learns some new recepies and tries them out, because food isn’t scarce anymore and he wants to share it with his family. He likes watching cartoons and reading old sci-fi and it’s nice to have hobbies outside of the job. He likes the warm feeling in his chest when he’s enjoying good food with his friends, his family.
They stumble back through the portal with seconds to spare, and if Dean pushes Cas through first this time, that’s nobody’s business but his.
And Chuck, looking supremely unconcerned and maybe a little entertained, the fucker, says, “Well, Sam?”
Cas gets pissy at them for trusting Jo, but it’s not like they have any other options here, so Cas is relegated to maintaining the spell while him and Sam nosedive into the sulphur. Again.
They haven’t seen Bess for years, but she looks good. And Garth mentioned his daughter when they roped him into spending Christmas on dangerous undercover mission but now he’s got three whole rugrats, damn. Cute, too, even if they are named after Sammy and Cas.
“Yeah, done,” Dean says, brushes off his knees, tugs unnecessarily at his shoelaces, and starts forward again. “Follow my lead.”
, the voicemail tells him for the eighth time, and Dean can feel his pulse in his temples. Between that, his own irritable footsteps and the rhythmic clacking sound of Cas packing borax shells, it’s a cacophony of impotent frustration.
“Yeah. If, uh. If she needs something from me she’ll tell me,” he folds his hands together, prim and proper, what an old lady. “We have an agreement.”
“Would you put my Agent on the phone please,” Dean says, hopes he sounds like an asshole boss and not just an ass.
“Yeah,” Sam sighs, then says again more firmly. “Yes. But. This was powerful magic, Dean, and- and I--”
The case is weird, but old school weird. Less omnipotent meddling, more the Mean Girls/Twilight crossover nobody asked for.
His moment of weird nostalgia does remind him that he spent a year tearing through this sepia forest and never once saw any kind of flower, and Michael wasn’t exactly forthcoming with a description. Or a location.
“Sam’s visions,” Chuck nods. “They weren’t drafts. They were memories. My memories. Other Sams, other Deans, in other worlds.”
“You okay?” Dean checks as he steps back, claps Cas on the shoulder one more time but he’ still solid, still
the magic activates, vibrates though the whole floor and glows brighter than Moira’s coin and when it’s done, Joey’s coin is completely blank.
Pax sighs, maybe he thinks he isn’t good enough leverage, but mommy dearest turns up anyway - Moira. Dean might have known the two most attractive people in this backwater were deities.
“He really got to you, huh?” Dean sighs. “Look, man. Chuck is still kicking. The balance of the universe is still balanced. Cas didn’t take the Mark. I’m not gonna go all Miss Havisham on your ass.”
A weird kind of peace settles around the bunker, with the four of them back here full time. Things would almost be normal, if it wasn’t for the looming threat of God’s very literal wrath.
, is dried and stiff. A grotesque echo of what he used to have. His eyes burn when he catches sight of it in the bathroom mirror, but he won’t take it off.
And there’s a big difference between Sam making jokes about him and Cas bickering like an old married couple and Sam actually knowing that that’s exactly what Dean wants. Now he does and even though Dean was almost sure before, Sam’s casual acceptance makes his heart swell.
says the clickbait, and if it were five or six years ago he’d believe it but not with the state of Heaven now. Still, it’s as good a reason as any to stretch his legs.
Dean stumbles cautiously back through the thickest part of the forest, listens hard for any movement but there is none.
He doesn’t regret that, and even when he’s resented the cost, he did what he could to help people. Dean has always been a good little soldier, he’s been ready to die for the greater good since he was 16.
The room is too bright through his tears, to intense. But he closes them and it does fade, the room is actually glowing, shining bright as the fucking sun, or the white-out light of raw grace and Dean clamps a hand over his face on pure instinct.
Cas doesn’t respond, keeps looking at his own fingers like they hold the secrets of the universe. Dean takes a sip of his El Sol.
Dean thinks of Rowena and her list of regrets, thinks of Benny and Jack and Charlie and Mom and everybody he didn’t get to save, people he never got the chance to thank for everything they did for him, all the times he never got to say goodbye before they were gone.
One two three bottles smash as Dean ducks behind the bar and, god bless Texas, there’s a shotgun stashed by the pickles. He returns fire, but he’s only got two shells and an empty box, and they don’t do much. Lee got off a few more shots, and Dean only heard two but Lee did always have a habit of grouping in threes so Dean takes a gamble.
And doesn’t that just put a dent in Dean’s good mood before it’s even left the showroom. It hadn’t occurred to him that Lee wouldn’t know, somewhere down the line everyone in the life just seemed to have heard.
, which is canon-typical for Dean. It's vague and evasive, because it's Dean's headspace, but it there so take care of your triggers babes
And Dean pulls up short, that’s not what he was expecting at all. Thankfully Mike takes the reins again while Dean flounders.
“I admit I had my doubts,” Dean laughs. “But we didn’t think Jack was ever coming back from that. Ever. So coming home to this? Fortuna’s blessing might just be the real deal after all.”
And maybe accidentally summoning your dad from the past is the unbelievable secret shortcut to closure therapists don’t want you to know about but, still. Dean’s kind of offended that Lee thinks he’d still be trailing after his dad at 40 years old.
Dean cuts the engine, opens his door and swings his legs out but stays sat there for a minute, gives them space to find a quiet corner to hash it out. They’re both shaky and traumatised, the last thing they need is Dean listening to them air out their crap.
“Listen,” Sam says. “I can try to jerry-rig up some magic, using a substitute. Then again, the only substitute that would stand a chance of working is--”
They met Adam exactly once, and they tried to talk him out of trusting Zachariah and when he went anyway, they went after him. It’s not like they haven’t thought about him since, they just didn’t think there was any way to get him back.
He’s losing it, his can hear the shake in his voice. His eyes are burning and he can’t bring himself to care, there’s no one here but him and his long list of screw ups.
After a moment, she locks onto Jack like a shark scenting blood. Strides towards him and the whole room seems to flinch around her.
It's a goddamn miracle, that he somehow safely parks the Impala on some little dirt pull off, that he didn't hit a ditch or a tree or even a squirrel. Because Cas is currently swallowing around his cock, tongue working sinfully along the underside of the head, fingers stroking the soft skin behind his balls. He can feel Cas's other hand against his hip, fingers ghosting over the newly exposed skin, and Dean drops his head back, eyes sliding shut, lost in sensation.
Dean pulls him up, slotting their mouths together, tasting himself on his tongue. "I want you to fuck me," he whispers against Cas's lips, feeling him grin into the next kiss. "But not here."
Dean can practically hear his heart hammering in his chest as Cas closes those final inches, palming him through his jeans. The warm press of his hand is maddeningly light, serving only to remind Dean how very much he'd like all of the brunette pressed against him. He chances a glance to his right when Cas stops talking, momentarily meeting mischievous blue eyes. When those deft fingers move to his fly, he's glad — his pants were growing uncomfortably tight. The relief is only momentary; as soon as he's unzipped, those fingers are diving below the waistband of his boxers, wrapping around his shaft.
"Yeah, sixty-seven, actually." Dean's impressed at how close Cas was, and grins, "She used to be my dad's. He crashed it when I was sixteen, and told me I could have it if I could fix it." Dean laughs, climbing in, and reaching across to unlock Cas's door. "Pretty sure I know her bones better than my own."
As much as I loved this prompt, I actually never intended for this to have chapters. So, naturally, it's become one of the longest (and most popular) things I've ever written. I want to thank everyone who subscribed, commented, kudo'ed or bookmarked, please leave me more.
Dean lets out a groan, tightening his grip, adding the little twist at the head that he knows will rush him towards that edge, "Fuck, Cas, you felt so good around my cock, gonna make you scream my name, gonna —" he's cut off by a beautiful moan from the other end, and he gasps in response, balancing the phone on his shoulder to reach down and fondle his balls.
Castiel works him open slowly, and Dean's glad for the cool shower when a finger pad grazes his prostate, almost sending him hurtling over the edge. Instead he gasps out a soft, "Casti-
Dean leans in, placing a soft kiss at the bolt of Castiel's jaw, mumbling into his neck, "Why resist?"
"Is he always such a dick?" Dean says around the lip of his bottle, eyebrows quirking up as he takes a drink.
Dean chuckles as he sends the plastic carrier through the pneumatic tube to the drive-thru teller. He's about to ask who's calling in at seven in the morning when he's interrupted by the crackle of the speaker, "Good morning, Mr. Winchester, how can I help you today?"
"That's downright devious, Cas." Dean chokes out through the laughter the story has inspired, "I had no idea you were an evil genius."
Cas leads him to the bed, pushing at his chest until he falls back, catching himself on his elbows. His jeans are removed with care, the gentleness of Castiel's hands at odds with the sight of his cock hanging flushed and heavy between his legs. Dean can feel the urgency of his own arousal, bucking up slightly as a hand works under the band of his boxers. Cas takes the same care removing this last article of clothing, positioning his legs just so, before peppering the inside of Dean's thighs with kisses and affectionate nips. He feels him mouth at his balls then sink lower, tongue darting out to circle around the pink bud of his asshole. He can feel stubble scratching against the sensitive skin around his entrance, but it becomes irrelevant as Castiel's tongue breaches the tight ring.
Charlie almost drops her ice cream. "You already did!? And I'm just hearing about this now?" She swats at his shoulder, "I can't believe you didn't call me! We could have had a getting ready montage!"
"Woah, back it up. You're telling me that bad joke guy has a hot brother that you charmed into the sack in less than an hour? Respect, dude!"
Dean's phone chimes as they roll into town, and he fishes it out of his pocket, eyes on the road. "Read this for me, babe?"
Castiel seems to accept this and offers no further argument, instead reaching out to where Dean's hand rests on the seat between them and tangles their fingers together. It's only a few more minutes to his place, and Dean can't help but look forward to waking up with Cas in his apartment. With the easy way Castiel has fit himself inside Dean's head, the companionable silence in which they can coexist, the undeniable chemistry between them, he's sure Cas will fit in his home in much the same way. Dean backs into his usual spot, ushers Cas up the stairs, unlocks the door, opening it wide so Cas can enter.
His phone vibrates against his knee, and it's in his hands before the chime ends. He has to fight the urge to laugh out loud at Cas's description of Gabriel's birthday party (
And this is maybe the most grammatically correct sexting he's ever experienced, but he can just imagine Castiel growling it in his ear, and he's not sure he's ever been turned on so quickly in his life. He reclines on his bed, undoing his fly to relieve the building pressure. He rubs the heel of his hand against himself through the boxers and groans lightly, typing a reply one handed.
"Respect, dude!" Charlie raises her hand for a high five, "So, after you and the hot brother did the dirty, what happened?"
"He's here for you, Gabriel. Apparently you've been harassing —" His eyes shift back to Dean, "Sorry, with all the yelling, I never got your name."
"So," Dean can feel every syllable exhaled against his neck, "we don't. And you can help me with this shower."
"You wanna take this somewhere more private, Cas?" Dean runs a hand under the back of his shirt, slipping his fingers along Cas's spine, tracing over to splay them wide against his ribs. Cas nods eagerly and pulls away, leading Dean upstairs to a sparsely furnished bedroom. The door is barely closed before he's kissing Cas again, backing him toward the bed, sighing in relief as Cas undoes his fly and palms his cock through his boxers. Dean slides his hands under the waist of Castiel's pajamas, pleasantly surprised when all he finds is smooth skin. As Cas hits the bed, Dean pulls his pants fully off, exposing muscular thighs and the cock he's been curious about since the door opened.
He's supposed to work from three to seven today, (Bobby's solution for all the nine-to-fivers that pour in on Saturday afternoons), it's just past nine now, and Dean knows he has a few hours of things on his to-do list. He tells Cas, reluctantly, that they've got to head out within the hour.
Cas's shirt is all but ruined, and Dean's more than a little glad it means he'll be riding shirtless (even if dress slacks and no shirt is a completely ridiculous look.) They take a minute to catch their breath, exchanging soft kisses in the afterglow. Dean pulls back out on the road, right hand clasped tightly in Cas's left.
"Yeah, capisco." Dean releases the grip he had on his shirt, and Gabriel retreats, presumably back to where ever the hell he came from.
"Is there a reason you're waking me up at four in the morning on a Thursday?" Dean swallows at the sound of the man's voice, the rough gravel of it working to make him forget why he's there. "Or are you just an asshole?"
Fixtures hang over tables to create small islands of light, serving well to point out just how many people are already dining. Dean is relived to find there's only a twenty minute wait for a table, and the bar is fairly empty. When their buzzer goes off, Dean is in the middle of an anecdote about Nair and Sam's shampoo. The harsh sound of plastic against lacquered wood startles both of them, even though it's what they've been waiting for. Dean lets Cas lead as they follow the hostess to their booth, taking his time to appreciate the view. Because, damn, Castiel cleans up nice (not that Dean didn't appreciate him in pajamas.)
He swallows thickly and, temporarily mute, leads the way to his car. The low whistle from behind him as they reach the car unsticks his tongue, and he turns, running a hand lightly over the hood. "Yeah, uh, Cas, meet Baby."
a bitter voice reminds him, but he swats it away, pushes that doubt to the back of his mind. He quickly swaps his sweats for a pair of jeans, keeping the plain black tee he'd pulled on after his shower; heads back into the kitchen, pours another cup of coffee, and waits for Castiel.
"Shit." Dean groans, "I gotta be at work in an hour." He pushes himself out of the bed reluctantly, typing out a reply to Charlie's alarmed series of messages, assuring her that he is, in fact, alive, and promising details later if she drives Sam to school as he pulls on last night's jeans and boots. He's reaching for his shirt when he feels fabric hit his back.
"Yes, it can be very predictable work, but I am helping people." Cas starts out of the room and Dean follows, "What do you do?"
"NO! I mean, no, I'm not busy at all. Just getting out of the shower in fact." God, that sounds like a come on, and Dean winces inwardly.
He closes the door behind her, after a promise to call Sunday night ("Or Monday morning," Charlie had suggested, eyebrows waggling.) He cleans up; carefully rolling his map of Moondor, storing the different colored armies in individual bags, stowing all of it in a poster tube that he is sure to hide from Sam. (His brother may know Dean spends the first Saturday of every month LARPing in the park, but he doesn't need to know how very much Dean actually cares about the outcome of those battles.)
As they stumble out after midnight Cas gently pulls the keys from his hand, sliding comfortably behind the wheel to drive them home. Dean just rests his head against the cool window and watches the lights pass, drifting in and out of sleep. When they arrive back at his apartment Cas follows him inside where they collapse, still dressed, into bed.
This time, it's Cas pulling Dean in; molding their lips together, fingers carding through short hair. "I love you, too," Cas exhales against his lips before Dean's pressed against the warm metal of his car. It's a blissful fifteen minutes before Cas huffs a laugh against his cheek, "I can
Dean rubs hand against the back of his neck, "I mean, yeah? Unless you're into running errands with me, but it's all lame stuff," Dean has his metaphorical fingers crossed Cas will come with him, he hates doing this crap alone. "You know, groceries, Home Depot — I gotta go to the bank."
He sees the shift in Castiel and his grin grows wider. The stare which had been puzzled and amused turns predatory and suddenly Cas is just there, all up in his personal space, hand snaking behind his neck and it happens. Cas crashes his mouth into Dean's, tongue slowly working its way into his mouth. Dean can hardly believe this is happening as he slides his hands down Cas's sides, pulls them closer, lets Cas back him up against the counter. Cas grinds himself deliciously into Dean and groans into his mouth. Dean takes it as an invitation and slides his hands down to grip Cas's ass and it's as firm and perfect as he imagined it to be. Cas catches his fingers in Dean's hair, pulling him back and breaking the kiss. Dean's met with lust-blown eyes and pushes his hips forward lightly, loving the electricity that shoots through his veins as their erections meet. Cas must enjoy it too, if the broken "
Dean shifts his legs, nudging Cas's apart with one knee, groping for the lube. His hand hits it and he pops the cap with his thumb. He's forced to break the kiss, push himself back onto his knees, and Cas lets out a keening whine at the loss of contact. He squeezes the lubricant onto his hand and reaches down, resting his fingers against Cas. "This what you want?" Cas nods, rolling his hips toward Dean's hand. "Gotta hear you say it, Cas."
He can hear the shower running when he steps back out into the hall, but the door is still ajar. He pushes it the rest of the way open to reveal Cas standing shirtless in his bathroom, one hand thrust under the spray, the other adjusting the knob. Despite the warning he'd given himself, his breath catches in his throat at the sight of all that skin, the taught line of toned shoulders, the dark curls starting to form at the base of his neck just begging for fingers to be twisted into. He starts lightly when Cas speaks, back still turned. "Thank you, Dean."
Dean is suddenly very aware of his own arousal vibrating through his body. He's not sure who moves first, but they're quickly tangled up in each other, hands roaming, hips rocking together. "
He's washing dishes when his phone chimes again. He rushes through the last of it, leaving the silverware for tomorrow. Drying his hands sloppily, he reaches for his phone as it chimes a second time. (
The look on Cas's face as he finishes has Dean all but collapsing with laughter in the check out line, wiping his eyes as he swipes his card and selects yes, twenty-three dollars and sixteen cents is the amount he's agreed to pay for this transaction.
"Do you sleep like that with Alan? Is that why?" Danjal continued his questions until Robin shook his head, a small smile on his lips.
The door let out a loud angry grunt as it was unlocked and shoved open, the salt scattered away from the door as Sam stepped into the house. He first thought to go towards the bedroom but stopped, looking down at the blood on the floor he followed it to the couch.
“It’s rabid!” Someone shouted, a few collective gasps and screams as the patrons in the bar quickly moved out of the animal's way, all looking at the creature with confused and wide eyes. Chamuel slowly stood up from his seat,
"Wait for me," He called after, having never had to ask that of the hunter until this second, something was very wrong but he wasn't sure if he'd ever known as Donnie threw open the door for the two. Grabbing Abel the hunter hugged him tight, glancing at Cham but not giving him the same reaction which caused his heart to break even more.
"I should probably get some sleep," Abel laughed, flicking the butt of the joint to the ground below them.
"Well, if you're going to be rude about it, fine." There's a melodramatic huff over the line. "Why can't you teach a Jedi calculus?"
"Oh." Cas clears his throat, "Well, since you're, uh, clean now, I was thinking I could take you up on dinner."
Dean's not sure how long it takes them to regain their composure, but when Cas presses ther lips together again, the urgency of earlier has vanished. The kisses they share now, on the scratchy carpet of Castiel's bedroom, are leisurely, a slow slide of tongues and lips. Cas works his fly the rest of the way open, but makes little effort to remove the jeans, running his hands back up Dean's chest, his neck, to cup his jaw, tongue receding, the kiss turning tender and soft before he pulls away, holding Dean's face in place as he tries to chase him down to the floor. "I love you, Dean," he whispers, rolling so that they're on their sides, untangling their limbs, pulling Dean to stand.
He makes a strangled noise in his throat and stands abruptly, offering a quick "'Night," to his brother and quickly heading for his room, typing hastily on his way.
Charlie gets the details he'd promised her on Friday. (To her credit, she waits until after they finish epic amounts of Chinese take out to pester him about it.) He tells her about arriving, immediately embarrassing himself in front of Castiel, why Gabriel was calling in the first place, and is glossing over the sex part when she interrupts.
Cas removes his hand slowly, rotating to catch Dean's mouth in a heated kiss before shutting the shower off, "I believe you said something about a bed?"
not awake yet." He grimaces, "Which means I'd have to call Kali. I'd much rather accompany you. Even if you were going to the
On the way to the bank, he asks Cas about his schedule, sending him into a long explanation of call time averages and distribution of service. "The worst, though, is late night. Ninety-nine percent of people calling tech support at midnight are drunk, or stoned, or both. That's the shift they start people on. It's like sending people to Hell to see if they break."
Gabriel lets out an exaggerated gasp, "I wouldn't!" He looks mildly scandalized, as though the whole reason Dean's here wasn't his own antics.
When Dean wakes the second time it's to his six forty-five alarm. He's still bundled up, practically sweating beneath the full bulk of his comforter, and he never thought he would miss Cas bogarting all the covers, but he does right now. What he wouldn't give to have waken up with his boyfriend already in his bed. (
"How do you know it isn't Sam?" Dean's not sure how he manages to keep his face straight as he meets her eyes.
Even with a quick stop for a change of clothes, Dean rolls into the shop five minutes before they open. A little later than he likes, but if that's the price he has to pay, so be it. From the moment he pulls the first car in, he knows it's going to be a rough day. Girl had apparently run over a nail before vacation; leaving her car to leak all the air from her tire and gravity to slowly destroy the rim. So he has to explain to an upset nineteen year old that, no, it won't be a twenty dollar patch job, and that it would probably be cheaper to replace than repair. After a few hopeless tears and a call to her mom, he places the order for her wheel and tells her her car will be ready in a few days. The next eight hours are a series of estimates; pulling cars in to diagnose problems, only to have the owners decide that it can wait, or that the price Dean quotes them is too high. It's an incredibly frustrating day, capped with the fact that Cas hasn't even texted him. He knows it's ridiculous, but it had felt like, maybe, they had had something, however brief their meeting was. And, damn, if Dean doesn't want to see him again. When he heads across the street to collect his brother he's almost forgotten the five feet of reasons he has to avoid the place like the plague.
"Cas, stop 'pologizin'. I wanna do it, s'not your fault they sentcha." Dean stifles another yawn, glancing at the clock, "'sides, it's 'ficially the twen'y fourth, y'can't argue w'me, s'my birthday.
He grins, pulling the plug from his phone, and rolls to his side, burrowing back into the comforter. "Hey Cas, how's Houston?"
This time he allows Dean to lead them from the bathroom, one towel between them, and Dean's never been so glad his bedroom is the closest to the bathroom. There's no need to remove his lips from Castiel as he guides him backwards across the hall, crowding him against the doorframe, sucking a bruise just below his collarbone, grinning into the skin of his neck when Cas takes the initiative to push him the rest of the way into the bedroom. He feels the backs of his knees hit mattress, and lets himself fall, drinking in the sight before him. His bedside light is still on, illuminating an expanse of lightly tanned skin; his eyes follow a bead of water down his chest, his stomach, lingering at his cock, hard and leaking, before trailing back up to meet Castiel's, deep cerulean and lust blown.
tight and make his ass a work of art. The green Henley he chooses stretches across his chest almost as snugly as the shirt he'd borrowed from Cas this morning. He throws his favorite leather jacket on over top and coaxes his hair into place before pulling his boot on.
Dumbstruck, Dean nods and follows him into the kitchen, wincing as lights are flipped on. After the initial shock he's grateful for the light, because it gives him a better look at the man before him. He's barefoot, toes peeking from under the hem of blue pajama pants that ride low on his hips, the tight grey tank he's wearing showing off a slim, solid torso and toned arms. To top it all off, the guy had a head of hair that was just begging to have fingers run through it, and eyes blue enough to drown in.
Sammy. He pops his head through to meet amused blue eyes and something catches in his chest. He feels a grin stretch across his face at the sight of Castiel — he's wearing the pants Dean had left in the bathroom last night, standing in Dean's kitchen like he belonged there, faint bruises peeking from the stretched out collar of
When the fourth finger slips in and Cas grazes his prostate again, he breaks, begging for more, asking Cas to fill him up, to fuck him,
At the top, he turns, pinning Cas against the bedroom door, groping for the doorknob. When he locatēs it and the door swings inward, they collapse into a heap, arms and legs tangled together, half-in and half-out of the room. He can feel Cas shaking beneath him, the chuckles huffed against the skin of his chest, and he can't supress the laughter that bubbles out of him.
He holds Cas's gaze as he lowers his mouth back down, relaxing his jaw and sinking even as he feels the head hit the back of his throat. He releases his grip on his hip, letting Cas thrust up as he molds his lips tightly around the shaft, relaxing his throat as Cas fucks into his mouth. He feels tentative fingers curl into his hair, and moans around a mouthful of cock, increasing the suction as Cas tightens his grip. Dean slides one hand down to fondle Cas's balls, letting a fingertip brush against his hole.
Cas is smiling softly at him, back in his pajama bottoms, he expects it to be awkward, but it really isn't; there's none of the heavy regret borne of his usual one night stands, and Dean wishes he could just skip work and stay here, take his time exploring the body before him. Everything happened so quickly last night, whatever strange chemistry they had going on mingling with high emotions and exhaustion had led to amazing, if short lived, sex. It could be a great day lounging around with Cas, learning what made him tick, how to get him worked up. Dean wonders absently what Cas does with his days off, if he sleeps in, if they'd go out for breakfast, or if Cas cooks. Unfortunately he won't find that out, there's no way he can skip out on Bobby when he's short handed, and Cas is apparently already working. "So, tech support?"
"Fuck, you sound so good right now." He squirms out of his jeans, pushing them and his boxers down to bunch at his knees as he gets a better grip on his aching cock, "Wanna hear all the sounds you make when I ride that cock."
He can feel himself growing close to the edge, hips stuttering forward as Cas pulls back to flatten his tongue against the head. He whimpers when he feels a hand come up to cup his balls, "Cas, I —" the hand caressing his balls shifts up to grip the base of his cock, "Cas,
As they hunt through Home Depot, searching for fluorescent light bulbs, Cas tells him about the time Gabriel peed into a display toilet, "And he wasn't as young as you want him to be."
It is a truly awful strip joint, the garish neon sign bathing the parking lot in red and blue, casting strange shadows as it flashes 'LIVE GIRLS.' A single white light above the door illuminates a small crowd of smokers, an even mix of dancers and patrons; a few involved in conversation that was far too close to be polite. The lot extends around the left side of the building, dark and unwelcoming, but Castiel is no where to be seen.
"Well, you got it, pal, I'll stop calling you." Gabriel begins backing out of the room, "No harm, no foul, right? All's well that ends funny, and I can probably work this into one hell of a punchline."
"So beautiful," Cas murmurs from above him, and Dean glances up, taking in the way blue eyes dance over his skin.
" that falls out of his mouth in a breathy moan as he comes. The water has started to cool significantly by time he shuts it off, and he steps out of the shower just as his phone starts to ring.
considering it on the way over, but there's one big problem with that plan." Dean grins at the confused tilt to Cas's head, the quizzical frown that he just wants to kiss away. "I would never have a chance with his hot brother if I ganked him."
"I know you have an affinity for pie, drive some big black nightrider-looking classic car, and work at Singer Auto. I also know you've got a little brother," Gabriel raises a hand over his head, "Yeh tall, floppy hair, real brainiac."
"She's beautiful." Cas walks around to the passenger side, eyes flickering between the car and Dean. "Late sixties? She must be a lot of work to maintain."
Dean clears his throat, "It's no problem." He sets the pants on the sink, "Just, you know, take your time, and I'll change the sheets on my bed." And, shit, now Castiel has turned to face him, and he thinks he could maybe lose himself in those eyes forever, "Not that we — you don't have to — I can sleep in Sam's room, if you —"
"Look, man, I get it, ok? No more calls, scout's honor." He holds up three fingers earnestly, and Dean actually believes him, a little bit.
"Have you tried turning it off and back on again?" The low rumble of Cas's voice wakes him from a particularly restful sleep.  He squints one eye open to see Castiel sitting up, laptop open in front of him, phone pressed to one ear. "Good, now wait thirty seconds and plug it back in." Cas turns his head to catch Dean watching him and presses a hand to the bottom of his phone, "Good morning, Dean. I'll just be a minute."
The scowl on Cas's face when he turns around is fearsome, but it quickly falls from his face as he meets Dean's eyes. "He started that conversation with a bagel and a banana. It was rather graphic."
"I think I've got it just right," Castiel worms the fingers of one hand under the hem of Dean's shirt, pulling him impossibly closer,  "Want to check it for yourself? You could join me." His bottom lip grazes Dean's earlobe, sending shivers coursing through him. And maybe Charlie was on to something, maybe karma does owe him one, because he never could have dreamed up Cas. Dean grins and crashes their lips together, pausing only to pull his shirt over his head.
"Can I use your shower?" Cas is still standing in what Dean jokingly calls his foyer, the two by two square of linoleum that clears the swing of the door just enough for a small shoe rack. "I feel as though I'm covered in body glitter and residual 'daddy issues'."
It actually turns out to be a very informative trip; he learns that Cas speaks fluent Spanish, as well as Mandarin, Russian, and German. As well as what he describes as 'passable Hebrew.' (Dean thinks any proficiency in a dead language could be considered 'passable.') "So, uh, what language is Castiel from?"
Dean wakes up a few hours later to a numb right arm and an aching bladder. Gently, he slides a pillow down to replace his bicep for Cas and stands, wincing at the stiff feeling in his muscles. He pads to the en suite, turning the shower on to heat up as he relieves himself. He's just stepped in when he feels arms wrap around his waist. "It's almost six," Cas grumbles into his back.
“Oh my God, and then he just left?” Charlie exclaimed, staring at Castiel from her place beside him at the bar, “And he let you keep his hat? Dude, that’s like, I don’t know, a cowboy proposal or something?”
“Oh how nice, two volunteers. Mr. Novak and Mr. Winchester at the back there, would you please come up front, and bring your copies of the Tempest with you?” Crowley almost yells and Castiel snaps his eyes up to meet the furious gaze of his professor. Splendid, now Dean got him into trouble in class as well.
“Uh, no it’s my first time,” Castiel almost whispered, staring down at his hands. “My friends made me come. I’m Castiel.”
“Oh, right, thanks,” Dean beamed, and jumped down from the stage. “Sorry I wasn’t here last night to- y’know.” Dean sounded more nervous now, as he looked down and rubbed his neck. “Say hi,” he finished awkwardly.
Dean’s hands on his hips, pulling him closer, Dean’s hands in his hair, Dean’s nose bumping his is something Castiel’s still not used to. Not even after three weeks of kissing Dean. They’re now sitting on Castiel’s couch, watching some movie with people in it that are doing things. Or something like that. Castiel hasn’t really paid a lot of attention. All he can think of is Dean’s arm slung around his shoulder, Dean’s leg pressed against his, Dean’s other hand on his knee, Dean’s laugher, Dean’s cologne, Dean, Dean, Dean.
But the last thing, and most important thing, he’s learnt, is that Dean’s lips fit perfectly with his. Especially when Dean comes running back just as Castiel is about to unlock his door, and presses a gentle and soft kiss to his lips, running his hands through Castiel’s hair.
“Yes, of course,” Castiel replied and stepped out of the car, closing the door carefully behind him. One of the few things he had already learned about Dean was that the second most important thing in Dean’s life, after his younger brother, was his car. If Castiel was asked to guess, he’d say that pie came in a close third, judging by the obscene noises Dean had made the previous evening, when Castiel had baked him a thank-you-for-the-help-even-if-I’m-weird-and-you-don’t-really-know-me-pecan-pie.
Charlie couldn’t stop smiling, and she grabbed Castiel’s arm as if to make sure he absolutely didn’t leave.
“Yeah, I, um, couldn’t let you leave without- uh yeah, so I called in a favor from Charlie,” Dean whispers, breath hot on Castiel’s ear.
“But come on Cassie, it’s the first Friday in March and you know what that means!” Gabriel pleaded, trying to convince Castiel with his best puppy-eyes.
“We had a calving emergency on the farm, and I had to rush over right away,” Dean explained. Castiel stared at Dean in disbelief. Dean had wanted to meet him, but he couldn’t. Because he was even
“Aw Cassie, you can’t give up so soon,” Balthazar complained. “This is your literal dream man, and you’re going to let him go!”
“Yeah? Let me hear it,” Dean winks, putting one arm over the back of Castiel’s chair, leaning back slightly.
Castiel sighs. He’s forgotten the towel. Again. This is the third time this week. College life really isn’t something for him. Sharing shower rooms with others. Bringing your towel every time. Or well, not bringing your towel apparently.
“So, what would you say is best for a young man, with a gazillion books? I know he was talking about getting a bunch of BILLY’s, but what do you say?” Dean continued, now talking to the girl, confusion growing. Dean was asking questions about shelves, for him? What?
“I was actually really looking forward to seeing you again,” Dean continued, quieter this time. “But I get that you didn’t want to see me, I mean you’re out of my league anyway-“
“Cas-?” Dean had begun, abruptly stopping when Castiel threw his arms around the taller man’s neck. Dean chuckled quietly, and smiled into the kiss that Castiel placed on his lips. A kiss that begun just as chaste as the previous, but that soon grew heated and heavy. Dean licked along the seam of Castiel’s lips, coaxing his way inside. They had kissed for another minute, before Castiel pulled away, whispering a ‘good night, Dean’ before walking back to where he left his bag at the coffee shop.
kind of sex yet, but hell yeah I want to, with you. And it’s cool, we’ll just take it slow,” Dean says, hands running soothingly over the smaller man’s back, drawing patterns. Castiel sighs and nods, pressing his face into Dean’s shoulder. Dean smells like the garage, all oils and iron and burnt rubber. But he also smells like apples and leather. Castiel smiles and inhales, nuzzling his nose into Dean’s neck.
“Damn, this is good,” Dean says and hands it back, an honest smile on his face when Castiel finally looks up. He mumbles a quiet ‘thank you’ and turns to face the front, Professor Crowley demanding attention.
“This is a bad idea Charlie, I should go,” Castiel mumbled, but instead of leaving he leaned against the bar stool by their table, torn between his want to see Dean again and his want to not be embarrassed further.
“I’ve never had sex,” he blurts out, and continues quickly when Dean’s eyebrows shoot up, “I mean, never penetrative sex. And last time I, uh,
Three months have passed since the awkward first meeting. Castiel has met Dean for coffee a few times and dinner once a week. It feels nice, and not nearly as weird as he’d thought it’d be. Dating the stripper your brother hooked you up with for your birthday can be all kinds of weird. But it isn’t. Castiel doesn’t want to think too much about why it’s not weird, he just “goes with the flow” as Dean says.
Castiel sighed and sat down, eyes already glued on the stage. Much like the week before Dean entered the stage, basking in the spotlight and the audience’s cheers. He caught Castiel’s eyes quickly and shot him a genuine and surprised smile. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back. Charlie smacked his arm and mouthed an oh-my-god-did-that-just-happen to which Castiel shrugged timidly.
“I enjoyed it, Dean, I really did. You’re beautiful,” he replies, wincing at the dried semen in his slackers as he moves to stand. He looks up to find Dean staring at him, eyes wide and mouth slightly open, movement frozen.
He shuts off the shower and holds his breath for a minute, listening to hear if someone else is there. The only sound he hears is the dripping from the showerhead down onto the cold tiles by his feet, so he sneaks out of the shower, trying to shake as much water off as possible, before finding his boxers in the pile on the bench by the wall.
The ride back home in the taxi was miserable. Gabriel and Balthazar couldn’t stop with their pleased smirks and Castiel once again found himself sinking lower into the car seat, this time with Dean’s hat in his lap.
After walking around the entrance a few minutes he gave up and took the escalator to where he knew he could find his much needed bookshelves. As he came up on the new floor he saw a familiar leather jacket talking to a very good-looking, young, woman dressed in a yellow pike-shirt. Castiel’s stomach dropped. Of course, it wasn’t unexpected; Dean was good-looking, young, and flirtatious. He cursed himself internally for allowing himself to hope. He turned around to pretend to look at the apparently very interesting selection of coffee tables IKEA provided, letting Dean get the girl’s number before interrupting. According to his brother, interrupting wasn’t nice, especially not if what you’re interrupting is an attempt to “get a roll in the sack” as his brother so eloquently put it.
Dean hadn’t showed up at the Roadhouse at all after his performance, and Castiel had finally given up sometime after two in the morning. He and Charlie had shared a taxi back to the university campus on the other side of town, too tired to even share small talk.
“We should totally find a table nearer the stage Cas, so he can see you’re here,” Charlie said excitedly, dragging him along further into the room. She managed to squeeze past to young women and grab the last table along the edge of the stage, just a bit off where Castiel had sat one week earlier. He put Dean’s hat on the table and could immediately hear people around him whispering.
“Nicely done there, Cas,” Dean mumbles next to him and he turns his head to look at Dean, but he finds the other man’s face much closer to his than he thought it’d be.
“Mr. Novak, you read as Miranda act one, scene two, starting at line 422 ‘I might call him…’ and Mr. Winchester, you read as Ferdinand same act, same scene, and if you’re somewhat clever you can figure out when it’s your line,” Crowley barks and stares at them, urging them to start.
An hour later found them with a cart loaded with three white BILLY shelves and one blue toilet brush. They were walking towards check-out when something caught Dean’s eye.
Castiel almost giggles through the rest of his classes and all the way back to his dorm, and when he’s finally back in his room he throws himself on his bed, smiling goofily at the note. He digs through his pocket to find his phone, and composes a quick text to Dean.
“We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?” Charlie mumbled sleepily as Castiel walked her to her dorms, only a few minutes from his apartment. He nodded and gave her a hug, a silent thank you for sticking with him the whole evening.
“No one’s ever said that before? Ever? Dean, you work as a stripper for crying out loud,” Castiel says and moves to the other side of the room, circling his arms around Dean’s waist.
To his great joy, neither Gabriel nor Balthazar could join him at the Roadhouse the following Friday. Castiel had invited his friend Charlie instead, who he had met during his information sciences class last semester. He hadn’t told her anything about his first visit to the Roadhouse, but when he turned up with a cowboy hat in hand, she demanded an explanation.
He woke up the next morning, with a poorly formulated plan. Castiel would take his bike over to the Roadhouse and leave Dean’s hat at the bar, and then just not return the coming Friday. Dean was obviously not interested, so it felt wrong to keep his hat.
The following week was incredibly slow, and his supervisor was less than pleased with Castiel’s progress, or lack thereof. On top of his thesis related agony, his two roommates didn’t stop pestering him about whether he would return to the Roadhouse the coming Friday. He told them he wouldn’t, but Castiel had known the second he saw Dean walk out on that stage that he would be back.
“Great,” the man says and sits down next to Castiel and reaches out his hand, “I’m Dean. You ran away this morning, I had no time to introduce myself.”
Once inside Castiel walked directly to the large information wall, and not before long he found where he should be looking. He turned to point it out to Dean, who was nowhere to be found. Castiel sighed, they had only walked through the doors. How could he already have lost Dean?
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand,” Dean says and goes down on one knee, but that’s just for show. Castiel can practically hear Crowley roll his eyes when the redhead at the front wolf whistles.
“Yeah, m-me too, keep- keep going,” Dean agrees and mouths at Castiel’s neck, nibbling down to the edge of his shirt and up again, to whisper hotly in his ear, “come for me, angel.”
The second kiss on the other hand, half a minute later, was all sparks and moaning and tongues. Castiel had stood left outside, Dean walking away, blushing slightly, and it took Castiel a full fifteen seconds to process what had happened. And when he had, he realized that he’d liked it. But it hadn’t nearly been enough. So he ran after Dean, who turned around and crashed into him violently.
“If you would like to look here, in the catalogue, I can show you our different shelves. Of course BILLY is a classic, and it’s cheap but I personally like EXPEDIT because-“ the girl talked on about shelves, but Castiel zoned out, eyes on Dean’s, smile growing on his face. They stood close, listening to the girl, humming when it seemed appropriate, eyes looking at the pages but not really seeing, Castiel’s focus on Dean’s hand so close to his, their arms pressed together, heat radiating through layers upon layers of clothes. Every now and then he felt Dean’s foot against his or Dean’s fingers bump his underneath the table, making it really hard to focus on the employee standing before them.
As if on cue, he heard it. The earbud in his left ear hissed, a few notes of music played before it died again. His heart sank, she was waiting at the top of the tallest skyscraper for Abel.
'hey, you with Cain? He hasn't replied to me today. I'm super worried, he was going on about...something last night,'
"Well, my grandad was the one who had the picture originally. It looks like it was taken with an old camera from a book...or maybe a scroll?" Mishka responded, leaning back in the chair she had seated herself on.
"I'm fine, just run hot," Baal whispered, anxiety spiked through his veins. "How many folks have you used these on?" He asked as Theo adjusted the handcuffs to fit.
“Oh hey, Obizuth!” He scoffed, pain splashed over the back of his head but he didn’t go down as the male demon clawed at him. Turning on the male, he grabbed the demon and tossed him towards the woman roughly, he let out a grunt of pain as he collided with a dirty trash can.
"I ordered a few rounds, hope you don't mind," Arphaxat murmured. Abel turned his head back to the other, blinking away his general anxiety as he took the alcohol, downing it and slamming the glass to the wooden table top below.
"You get the first puff, man! Welcome to the team and all," Abel laughed, Robin visibly relaxed as the three enjoyed one anothers company.
The man's screams we're drowned out by the music that blasted over the loudspeakers, the bodies on the floor slowly started to rise; Eyes turning black as the night sky.
Pushing into Donnie's room Abel knew exactly why the angel was so worried, Donnie was curled up on the bed. Growling, shuffling, clawing at the sheets as if he were being tormented by nightmares.
She glared at him for a few heartbeats before the sound of the jersey devils scream caused her to wince.
Theo watched from his spot at the bar, his face bandaged up, Dagmar beside him. The bar was in silence as they watched the TV screens that played the live news feed, everyone murmured softly to one another. Israfil's monsters faded away to show humans with the anti possession symbol on their body.
"Fuck no you don't," Abel snarled, wings, vivid, bright as the glittering golden sun exploded from his back. He shot into the air as the thorny crowned blossomed, covering his head in flowers.
"I...can't believe you saved me," she whispered, he grinned down at her, hoisting her up so she could sit on his back, putting her hands on his horns. His body ached, he couldn't stay in the air much longer. He spotted an old junkyard, letting himself fly towards it and dropping to his feet.
"Alright, let me show you kids how it's done," the older hunter laughed. Bailey stood behind the couch with a hard cider in hand.
"Hey, Baal I found another door," Bailey shouted as she made her way back towards the pews with her face in her phone. Baal looked from Fran to Bailey, then turned to look back at Fran but the man was gone. The only thing that remained of him was a small, beaded necklace with a cross on it. Baal hesitated before picking up the beads, they didn't burn as he held it in his palms.
"What was all that?" Baal asked as Rooster guided them out of the home and hoisted himself back onto his steed. Tilting his hat at the others,
Yet, he knew it wouldn't last. Not with what Faith had told him. Not with the final part of his mission. He wasn't sure when it would happen but until then he knew he wanted to be beside the wolf until then,
"Oh, Abel," Abel's eyes darted to Cain who was sipping out of Mishka's glass. He held out an envelope with a smile on his face.
Israfil shot towards Mammon, flying past the demon and landed on the floor. The demon snorted, Israfil snatched up the white guitar that was leaning against one of the pews and raced towards the Adinkra. He grabbed it just as Mammon shot bolts of electricity at the angel. Wood exploded from the lightning that collided into it, sending shards of sharp toothpick sized pieces into the air.
The group fell silent, Abel looked around him again trying to find a lighter, iron, anything. He felt someone prod him, glancing at Booker who handed the man a small lighter. Abel shot the other a grateful look,
"Wait, okay, go back to the Adinkra. Who gave it to you?" Sam asked, sitting down on the floor now. Dean followed this as well, lazily leaning on his open palm as it was set to the floor.
“You alright? Can you walk? Run?” Baal asked, Butch scramled to his feet and held out his hands, the chains clinked together. Baal snorted at them, the sound of racing footsteps could be heard rapidly approaching. His science experiment must not have done much. He grabbed at the chain with a hand, they sizzled against the man's skin. The bottom of Baal’s hands seemed to turn black before the chains exploded from the intense heat.
"I got you something, I missed your birthday so I wanted to get you something...nice," Abel tilted his head at this, grinning at the other.
Abel looked at the man in shock, he knew Baal was a demon king. Though he hadn't been prepared to see how big the man was, he wasn't afraid of him. Baal simply stared at him, longingly. Abel blinked a few more times, smiling now he got to his knees as well. Grinning widely and placing two hands on the others shoulders.
"We can talk about that later," Cain breathed, turning to look at his brother. Why was he excited to see the other was okay? He had tried to kill him.
"Swnw?" Abel snorted, tilting his head at the word, letting it roll between his tongue. Israfil blinked at the King of Kings for a few heartbeats,
"Yeah, A walk, I uh, I-I couldn't sleep. You know, it's just one of those days. Maybe I had too much sugar before bed, or had some sort of...o-odd reaction to…" she trailed off, running her fingers through her hair a few times in frustration.
"I'm in the middle of this," Bailey said with a shrug, gesturing to the pages of books on the floor in the other room. "I'm almost done or I'd definitely go,"
Cain playfully nudged the angel that was smashed in against him, Mishka ruffled his blonde hair as Chamuel laughed. Glee flashing in his gaze as Cain handed the blonde his controller. Their hands brushed as the blonde took it causing a spark to race through Cain's fingers.
"What're you gonna do with him?" Baal asked as Bailey held the golden trinket up in the moonlight. She frowned as she noticed the green light in the vile had completely faded.
"I've seen you suck dick before, Mammon, I'm not the only fag," Robin snarled out. The men all looked at each other, ooing as they did so before the group snickered as if they were bullies on the playground.
"Good night, Dan," Robin whispered as sleep dragged him downward. Danjal wasn't sure he would sleep, his mind muddled with thoughts jumping from every direction.
He dreamed vivid, wild dreams of the child with his straw hair. Watching him turn and run into the cornfield, Baal followed after the child before coming to a clearing in the field. The corn was all dead, rotting from within. In the middle of the grotesque crop was the church, standing high against a red sky. As he stepped up on the holy Land more children started to show their faces. They stepped from the corn stalks, their eyes black as night. He took a few steps back as the straw haired child pointed at him, his jaw unhinged as he screamed an inhuman, gargled scream.
"It's eight am, it's definitely too early for this," Mishka agreed, leaping onto one of the chairs that were connected to the kitchen counter. Looking over the small group, Butch groaned again. Chamuel frowned, it was odd how hungry and tired Israfil had seemed recently. The angel shouldn't have to indulge in either unless he wanted to.
Danjal glanced at the side of the home and back to the roof, arrows. They had been stabbed in between the rocks that stuck out of the side of the home, only a few but it was enough for the archer to get all the way to the roof. Danjal opened his hands, leaning down and placing them on the earth below. The ground rumbled under him before it shot upwards, moving silently through the air until it came to the roof. Danjal stepped down on the tilted top of the home, sending the chunk of Earth back to where it was with a flick of his fingers.
Donnie rolled his eyes, Paul had been his biggest supporter of his sexuality since Donnie came out as gay and has, and continued, to try and find him a boyfriend. Though this often failed since the two men were so vastly different when it came to what they looked for in a significant other.
"I'm not sure who we're at war with exactly," Abel continued on the screens of the pawn shop, Fritz tilted his head to listen but didn't make an attempt to check it out.
"Yeah well, sounds cool." Abel followed the other gaze, the two glanced at each other before Abel moved his hand over the dot and clicked. They were immediately overwhelmed with questions, notifications, retweets, their inbox was practically exploding with interest. Both Abel and Chamuel's jaws dropped, Abel felt a weight lifting from his shoulders. It had gone viral. Something he had never expected to happen so quickly! But then again, it was them in the video.
Dean paused as he went to shove Uriel off, both men's attention was turned to Jack who glared down at them. His wings of gold shimmered in the darkness of the forest of life.
Abel snorted as he eyed the phrases on the beer mugs, scouring the crowd with narrowed green eyes until he saw the familiar blonde in a booth. The man waved him over, Abel let out a shaken breath as he marched towards Arphaxat. Sitting down in front of his ex boyfriend.
"Come on, Chammy!" Abel called to the angel who was pulling a bottle of beer from the fridge that sat beside the large couch.
Uriel leaned down, placing a hand on chamuel's back. Chamuel felt warmth spread through him as the bruises from the night before vanished, his exhaustion lifted.
Chamuel continued to watch over him for a while, making sure he didn't have a nightmare. He reached forward and brushed the blood that dotted the top of Abel's head away, almost forgetting about it. His mind moved from Abel to the voice he heard, who was it? Why did it want him to wake Abel so badly? What was happening to Abel? The thoughts stressed him out heavily as he rose to a sitting position, making his way to the shower.
"You're just beating them?" Sam asked from the phone, Baal had the phone set on a table in front of the two demons. The face camera on, neither of the twins would look towards the camera.
"We don't know what it is," Chamuel hollered back, the two continued down the tunnel attempting to not fall into the sickening black water. A thought flashed in the hunters mind, swallowing hard he turned around quickly. The monster roared, diving at Abel who pulled his small gun from it's holster. He had almost forgotten he had it attached to his hip before entering the home, holding it up now the way Sam had taught him. Saying a silent prayer to whoever was listening that the weapon wasn't waterlogged.
The sudden burst of sound caught the hunters off guard, the hum of a harp filled the air around them. Mishka glanced around frantically before spotting a small, white rabbit. It hopped out of the doors to the large building not far away.
"I didn't know you lived in Kansas," he said, the map on the screen of the phone seemed to glitch a few times. Bailey tilted her head at this, pressing on the screen with a finger with a shake of her head.
"Okay, we--" Bailey started, Bernard leapt at them without warning letting loose a loud, inhuman screeching. He nearly landed directly on Bailey only to be knocked back just inches before landing his sharp talons on her.
"Got it, Boss," She hung up after a few seconds, groaning as she leaned on the counter. Pushing the cold glass of coffee from one hand to the other.
His mind went back to the demon he had vaporized, was Donnie thinking about that too? Chamuel followed the two in, Donnies arm around Abel, talking a mile a minute about some new invention he and his 'assistant' had put together,
“Raul Ernesh,” He whispered, holding up the paper and pointing to Iggy’s name. Abel’s jaw nearly dropped, “Wait…” he murmured, turning attention back to the news article. It was from a few years back,
"What the fuck!" Abel shouted out as they started to slide down into the darkness as if they entered into a haunted house.
"I have a friend who's great with all this stuff, she was the only one who believed me for years about the demon."
"Who the fuck do you think you are?" Mammon spat out, getting to his feet and placing the drink on the coffee table. He stood over Robin now,
Abel laughed, slugging Chamuel lightly in the arm causing the angel to grin wide as Abel waved the laughter away.
"You woke me up to tell me to go back to sleep?" Robin asked. Danjal blinked at the other, thinking this over before giving a nod and a shrug.
"I couldn't wake him up," Israfil whispered, Abel glanced around at the mess. It wasn't uncommon for the genius to be messy but it was odd for it to remain this way. Israfil was very clean, often cleaning up after Donnie without question but it was like the genius was so quick to make a mess the angel couldn't keep up.
The two ducked out of the back door, not bothering to lock it behind them as they quickly took to the streets. Both men stopped in the middle of the walk when the loud sound of a crack could be heard, their heads went up towards the noise. At the very top of one of the biggest skyscapers Israfil had ever seen something was falling, it fell fast. When another crack could be heard, they felt the earth shutter under the great power. The windows at the top of the skyscraper exploded as a bright vivid light filled the skies like a rocket. Large, beautiful wings lit the sky before diving towards whatever had fallen.
His fathers voice caught him off guard, he turned towards the man with a look of anger as if he expected the other to challenge him.
Abel turned his attention to another coyote, smacking it back. With every hit of his bat parts of the animals would collide to the ground, blood and black sludge covered the area turning the grass underfoot black. Chamuel ripped the black sludge from the coyotes as they came, destroying the slizering black ooze as fast as he could. Feeling himself starting to grow tired, he could see Abel was running low on steam. The man's face and clothes were covered in a mix of blood and sludge.
Chamuel flew through the air at a rapid speed, he didn't care that he was being smacked in the face by bugs, it didn't matter to him how tired he felt. The man in his arms was fighting for his life, he knew he was. The hunter twitched, letting out painful gasped, bright red blood that was dotting his forehead and rolling down his cheeks. Chamuel felt such a deep rage towards Arphaxat he almost couldn't contain it, the urge to hunt the demon down and slaughter him was strong but love kept War in check. He had to get Abel to the hospital, then he'd find the demon.
Donnie laughed, “Well you’re not gonna be alive long if you keep doing this,” He mused, adjusting the glasses that sat on his nose.
“I think you’re losing it, old buddy,” Chamuel murmured to himself. Scooting closer to Abel, relaxing into the deep darkness of sleep.
"No duh," Paul laughed, only for him to be shoved aside by Buck. Causing Paul to let out a childish whine at his father.
"Also, if you want to seem more human," Bernard scoffed, reaching towards the demonic man and brushing dirt off his shirt.
"Well he's on his way here," Sam thought back to Baal, even if Cain was dangerous he had Baal with him. Though he was a demon Sam trusted that Baal would protect them, especially considering his reaction to the negative comments on Abel's twitter.
"It's called a devil's mark," She said, the man eyed her as she twirled the pen between her fingers.
"My dad's journal said he couldn't pass those crystals. Maybe we had the wrong ones," Sam huffed as they watched the flames eat away the skin and fur of the corpse.
"Weaken him, an angel has to have permission to enter a person. That is, in theory. Every so often you hear the case of an angel going rogue and taking the body of someone too weak physically to put up a fight."
Cain explained what had happened the night before, avoiding the details about Abel going to hell. He didn't want the others to get even angrier with him over what had happened,
"Don't call me that," Abel felt a shot of anger at the name. Clenching his bat until his knuckles turned white. The call of a crow echoed around them.
"No...I...I'm sorry," He whispered softly to Robin who let the bigger man wrap his arms around him, holding him to his chest as he hugged him.
Closing the phone app and switching to Twitter, he blinked in surprise at all the excess stuff that had been added to their Twitter but decided against looking at it. He opened up messages, noticing a few pictures had already been sent to the two.
"Afraid you'll never find a breath mint," Sam said after a few rapid coughs, he smashed his forehead into the owl demons again causing Bernard to roar in anger.
"What about me?" The other twin asked, puffing out his chest. Israfil scratched his head overdramatically and pretended to think hard.
"How long have you been doing this?" Cham asked, setting his shovel down and pulling out his cell phone.
"I don't have much time," Fran whispered, "I can extract his soul from his vessel, it will be up to you to take his soul to one of Faith's alters."
Abel took in a few breaths as he tried  to calm the swirling panic in his mind, staring at the spot the other stood only seconds ago.
"It's the final ingredient to create the ultimate darkness, the strongest force ever known to man, demon or angel. The end of times, don't you understand?"
