Prosper was somewhere up ahead, following a confusion of scents. Dean followed after, his flashlight beam shivering over torn girders and exposed cabling. The only guy upstairs in their corner, the only angel that Dean trusted, who'd helped Dean sic an archangel on Lilith's ass when she came for Sammy, and he had needed to tell Dean something, and now
Castiel refused to grovel, or to be distracted from his purpose, brushing aside Michael's pointed comment. "And the other angels, they're willing to accept the judgement of a dæmon?" Angels in general had even less regard for dæmons than they did for humans.
After, Dean found the half-empty bottle of whiskey still sitting on the table, where Ellen had left it the night before. He sat down in front of it, picking out two shot glasses and shoving the rest to the side. Prosper leaned against his knee, whimpering with each breath she took, and Dean would have pushed her away, but to do that he would have had to acknowledge her, her sorrow like an open wound in his own chest, her need for comfort, for a touch. Dean poured amber liquid into both glasses, drank them, and poured again. He kept at it until there wasn't anything left, until all that remained were two empty glasses sitting side by side in front of him, like an accusation.
Dean's hand slapped down on the table. "You know who gets to mouth off with their stupid, useless opinions?" He all but growled. "People who don't fucking bail on us. You know. Stand up guys, like Crowley."
"Don't do crap like that." He threw himself down into the seat that Castiel had left empty, adjusting his tone to a whisper-shout. "That chick thought you and I had something going on with Cas!"
"What the hell happened?" Dean muttered. He was standing with his gun half-lowered, staring down at Sam's neatly made bed. "You getting anything over there?"
The prophet Chuck put his hand on Jimmy's shoulder, his large, brilliantly green scarab dæmon crawling up his wrist to hover close, almost but not quite brushing the fabric of Jimmy's coat with her front legs. He dropped his hand when Castiel looked at him; prophets, in Castiel's experience, were very unique, even by human standards. His daemon retreated back up his arm, disappearing beneath the collar of his shirt. Castiel turned his attention back to the window.
Then, quite suddenly, it simply felt like the soft warm rain that followed on the heels of the summer storm.
"It?" Dean glanced at Prosper, because maybe he wasn't hearing right, but she was giving off the same incredulous disbelief that he was feeling. He looked back at Sam. "It's not an 'it', Sam. It's Cas."
"I - " Dean began, and then had to stop to clear his clogged up throat. He tried again. "Me too, buddy. I love you, too." And yeah, it sort of felt like a cop out, throwing the 'buddy' in there. A back door that he was too chicken shit to shut. But that was how it had started between them, right? In friendship, companionship. It hadn't made sense, but that had never lessened its intensity, and it had only grown from that strange beginning, had only turned denser, deeper. More and more impossible to describe. And Cas didn't seem to mind. Kind of the opposite, actually, judging by his expression.
"I don't know, Dean, maybe Jack gave me a pass or something," Sam said, evasive as shit, looking away, out the window where a desert was unfurling like a thrown open scroll around them.
"Cas. Hey." His grace lurched through him, his tattered wings flared out, when Dean's free hand settled, unexpected and hot, on the side of his face. Beyond this, Castiel managed to hold himself still, managed to only stare up at Dean, at his strangely tender expression. "What's going on with you?" Dean asked, far too gently.
Anna had ripped herself free of her grace, and even that in the end had not freed her, or spared her dæmon.
But they had. Castiel had told them everything, and they had agreed to it. It was messed up, but at least the guy had been honest.
"Hey, hey." He raised his hand, then stopped himself before he did something unspeakably idiotic. "Shut up, alright? You're not an absence of anything, Connie, don't be stupid." He scowled and looked away, motioned with his free shoulder towards the junk food display next to the check out. "Let's grab some grub, huh?"
"Then he introduced himself, and told us how he wanted to break down all the walls, rebuild heaven from the ground up." Charlie sighed, dropping her chin into her hand. "It was so cool. Best. Job. Ever."
Then he turned away, leaving Michael and his dæmon to what grief, if any, they might still carry for their fallen brother, and went inside the house.
"Cas," Dean said, as the footsteps came closer. He raised a hand up from behind the counter in greeting.
"This is amazing," she finally said. "I feel like I already know you, but that's not possible, right? You're not
"Wow," Sam said. He scooted off the booth seat, shifting around to sit on the opposite end where Ishim had just been. "Hell of a friend, Cas."
He followed him that way as Castiel continued along the road, hovering vulture-like over his head, circling a hunger that he no longer trusted enough to approach. He could fly away, Constant supposed. Castiel had freed him in every way imaginable. But it was impossible; he was still tethered to the being below him, bound by love and memory.
blushing, because he was a full grown dude in his thirties, not some dumb puberty-stricken kid. "Now c'mon, let's go break up the hair braiding session before it gets out of hand."
"And you two are gonna do what? Take on Metatron yourselves? That's smart. Oh, no, wait. You - " he pointed at Cas, " - you lost your angel army. And you - " He turned on Sam, " - you're trying to lock up the one guy who has a shot at killing the son of a bitch! Hell of a plan, fellas!"
"Humans are very confusing," Castiel said. Constant made a rude noise in his throat, and Castiel grimaced. "Regardless, there's nothing to be done. And there are more important things to concern ourselves with."
Dean's lips pressed against the corner of his mouth, settled there, a firm, warm pressure that inexplicably caused the entire side of Castiel's face and neck to scintillate with sensation. He held himself still, listened to Dean breath in, then out again. Dean pulled, his hand still tangled in the edge of Castiel's suit jacket, and then there was more for Castiel to think about then the hand on his cheek, the mouth on his mouth. There was the bump of Dean's hip against his waist, the sudden entanglement of their legs. Dean made a sound, low in his throat, and slid his lips more fully onto Castiel's mouth, and Castiel -
She had to get back. She had to...had to help Dean, although she wasn't sure exactly what that meant anymore. But she ran anyway, trying to remember where the hell she was, where she had ended up. West of home, she knew that much at least.
When he touched her, she pressed her head against his hands, freely, eagerly. He stroked a careful thumb along the bridge of her nose, ran his hand behind her ears and down into the thick fur of her neck. Words were paltry things against the glory and grace of love; Castiel endeavored to tell her in this small, terribly intimate, human way. How she was everything bright and vibrant and lovely, how when he had believed in nothing else, he had believed in her. Dean was silent beside them; when Castiel glanced up, he was staring at them with wide eyes, his lips softly parted in shock. A quick, careless glance at him might impart an impression of stillness, when in truth he was trembling.
Someone important, Dean supposed. Important like Sam and Mary were important, important in every way that mattered.
"You can just say it, man," Dean said gruffly. "You're glad I didn't go berserk and murder those two scum bags."
"Great," Dean said. "Awesome. And we're gonna do everything we can to take care of him, okay? Raise him right, teach him whatever shit he needs to know."
"No demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts," Bobby said, not ungently. "They gotta have something nasty planned." Dean looked down, fear and anxiety lurching up in his stomach.
"Don't do that," she said, snapped, growled. Even in the dark Dean could see the flashing white of her teeth. She crowded in against him, and this time he gave way, plopping backwards on his ass, holding on to her by her scruff as she snarled. "Don't act like it's not real, don't try to convince me that there's something wrong about the way we feel."
Midmorning, Dean pulled to a stop in front of a convenience store. Emanuel sat in the car while he and his dæmon went inside, walking next to each other as they crossed the road. Dean's head was turned down toward her, and Emanuel suspected that they had returned to whatever argument they had been in the middle of when they started their journey the previous day. He hoped that they would come to some sort of resolution, so that the car trip might begin to feel less fraught.
Dean, predictably, began pressing Benny for the story; Prosper left them to it, rising to her feet and moving away. She would do one final pass of the area before night fell completely. To her surprise, Castiel stood up as well, following after her without a word.
"Dean," Prosper said, and he clamped down as hard as he could on the space in his chest where he felt Prosper and Prosper felt him because,
"He's dead," Dean said to Lily Sunder's back. "Are you done?" She and her dæmon were standing over Ishim's body. She turned to face them; her Collie dæmon didn't.
"Just variations on the same topic," Cas sighed, sagging gracelessly down into the grass where Dean had indicated. "Jack hasn't abandoned heaven like Chuck did, but he does tend to disappear without explanation or warning, and often for long periods of time. The other angels find it...distressing. So they come to me, demanding answers." He slid a look at Dean from the corner of his eye. "They disapprove of his upbringing."
A few hours later, Dean laid on the living room floor and stared up at the ceiling. Sam and Temperance were sleeping on the nearby couch, and Ellen and Jo were upstairs in Bobby's hastily straightened guest room. Dean couldn't sleep, couldn't stop straining his eyes to see through the dark. He sighed and stood up, and Prosper, also not sleeping, climbed to her feet beside him. She followed him across the room, then through the door.
angry, but no more than usual. More importantly, he was worried, frightened and fretting for Sam, concerned for Castiel.
"It was the same for me," Castiel said. Dean's eyebrow rose. "That is...I wasn't in denial, I - I just didn't realize, for a very long time."
Angels. "What's the difference?" Prosper asked, lowering her head challengingly. Hannah blinked. Her vessel's dæmon, a green garter snake, was curled around her neck like an accessory.
Prosper gave a pained howl when the sound of static rose to an earsplitting ring, and when the windows shattered and pummeled them with glass, Dean threw them both to the ground and curled his body around her until it stopped.
Sam blinked, glancing over at Temperance. "Okay, not what I was talking about, but - but that's good, Dean." All of a sudden he was smiling, grinning like a jackass. Temperance spread her ridiculously large wings and sailed down to Prosper, making that chirping sound that she only made when she was thrilled beyond belief. "That's great," Sam said, still grinning.
Emanuel kept Daphne's hand in his as he turned and walked across the room toward the man. He was tall and well-formed, clearly capable, as Emanuel had already seen first-hand. Yet he appeared oddly defenseless as Emanuel and Daphne approached, staring back and forth between them with a faintly lost expression, drawing away without physically moving. His dæmon stood behind and to the side of him, her tail raised, her head lowered. Perhaps they too were on the verge of shock.
"Got it." He set his purchases down on the chipped counter, hitting on the clerk as she rang everything up out of sheer habit while Constant watched and listened intently. They left the store, and Dean paused outside the door. "Look, the whole kicking you out thing? I didn't want it to go like that, trust me." He raised his arm and Constant took the hint, moving down to the crook of Dean's elbow so they could see each other. "Me and Prosper, we've got some shit we need to take care of. That's just the way things have to be for now."
"Ash!" Dean said, slapping his palm down against the counter. "Focus. That's not what this is, alright? Now, just - " He motioned at the laptop, " - do your thing already."
They sat side by side in front of the fire as the dark fell around them, a small, comforting source of light and heat against the chill snap in the air. Dean tried to remember if they had ever done anything like this back on earth, sat and stared at a fire that didn't have the body of a friend or hunter in the heart of it, or a ghost's salted bones, or wasn't powered up with holy oil in order to hold an angel captive. There had been those camping trips that Dad had taken them on, but those fires had been more along the lines of wilderness training. They hadn't felt like this. He and Sam exchanged a look, and this Dean could handle, this not-talking, the silent acknowledgement that this whole situation, i.e., the afterlife, was more weird and wonderful than either of them had imagined.
"Sammy and Temper are looking for us," she said, pulling away, a warning and a sidestep all in one. Dean sighed and stood up, letting it go for the moment. Prosper would keep it between the two of them for now at least, and anyway, she was too pig-headed to promise anything further. He would have to be vigilant for the both of them. They walked back to the motel, where Sam and Temperance were standing in front of Baby, watching for them.
He and Sam bickered back and forth, like they always did. Dean wanted to go for the throat; Sam wanted to chase the tail around. Sam would roll his eyes and try to call it 'strategy', but so far as Dean was concerned, this thing, this
They looked at each other, then turned away from him again, huddling around the table in a wordless family conference. Dean didn't know when exactly his definition of family had extended to include a Machiavellian demon and his scheming witch of a mother, but what the hell? He was also in love with a brain-washed, nephilim-worshipping angel, so Dean's entire life was apparently tits-up at this point. Might as well roll with it.
"It's the other angels," Cas said heavily, which, duh, who the fuck else could put that particular exhausted look on his face, besides the angels?
"Of course you are. What other reason could you possibly have for rescuing me? Surely nothing so meaningless as filial loyalty to the woman who gave you life - "
"Ah." Cas' frown didn't lessen, but it changed, shifting from confusion to consideration. "It's possible that he may have gone further than I can follow. He was very upset last night." Dean felt a stab of guilt, felt it shudder across his face. Cas' hand came up to grip his shoulder. "I'll look for him, Dean."
"Whatever you say." He stretched out on the ground, and Prosper did the same, settling in between Dean's feet, her blood still singing through her veins and along the link, so clear and bright that she didn't see how she could possibly sleep.
The whole case was terrifying, if it could even be called a case. The point of a case was to save people, stop the monster. Not lure one straight down to you so it could smite your friend, again. But they hadn't been able to say no when Castiel stood close and told Dean that they were the only ones who would help him.
"Cas, let's go," Dean bellowed, tugging on Castiel's shoulder. Castiel turned back to him, leaning in close to be heard over the crashing reverberations of grace, filling the air like the voices of countless resonating bells.
"Dean, this is exactly how we screw ourselves," Sam said. "We make the heart choice, instead of the smart choice."
Perhaps he was unliving, as Dean Winchester and his glowing, silent Prosper would define life. Certainly, he was not composed of the spitfire rage, the white-hot fault line of love and pain that was the Righteous Man. Castiel took care to respect the delineations of self that humans were limited by; Dean Winchester did not willingly share his thoughts and so it would be an abhorrent act for Castiel to immerse himself in them. However, there was always bleed through. When Dean has caught Jimmy's arm in order to force Castiel to look at him in the human way, Castiel had felt it, the thrumming cry of
"An action that serves as a detriment to hell would be a gain for heaven. For God." Dean's fingers ceased their drumming, falling in a loose fist into his lap instead.
"No, Cas." Now he was frustrated, his relief boiling away. "I know you want to help, okay, I do, but helping angels is what got you in trouble in the first place. Now, I'm begging you, for once, look out for yourself. Until we figure out what the hell is going on, trust nobody."
"Alright," Constant said. He was exactly like Cas in all the most irritating ways; it was freaking impossible to tell how much was getting through the processing unit.
"I don't know," Castiel sighed out. He was uncomfortably warm; there was a new, curiously gnawing sensation coming from his stomach that he didn't understand. "What do humans want? Peace, health, companionship?"
And to think that Dean had begun to trust him, even if he didn't like or understand him. Ever since Samhain and their unexpected conversation in the park, Dean had turned thoughtful when it came to Castiel.
Sam was just warming up to start expounding away about why they should hunt down and interrogate the demons he'd followed to town, when the waitress came back with the slices Dean had ordered. Sam muttered a soft, "Thanks," as she set the plates on the table, then paused with his fork half-lifted when she pulled the empty chair back and sat down. She tossed her hair and looked back and forth between them expectantly. Her stocky, unkempt dog dæmon sat beside her, uncomfortably close to Prosper.
Dean glowered at him and looked around as he fished his phone free of his pocket. They were in a warehouse now, standing around wasting more time while Rowena performed some sort of ritual to 'bind her spirit' or whatever, because technically she was a ghost now and could only move around if she was tied to something physical. He glanced at the name and took the call, his heart ratcheting in his chest.
"We are by no means 'cool'," Michael answered flatly, still looking down at the table. "However, I will not invest my time or heaven's resources in a needless slaughter. Jack is in..." He paused, considering, "...acceptable hands for the time being." He stopped talking, still staring at the food.
Okay, working around to it. Cas slid a wary look at him from out of the corner of his eye, then looked away.
Or rather, Dean. Just Dean, fueled by grief and rage and the last vestiges of duty. Dean alone, no future Prosper by his side. He had glared and glared at her, that future Dean, unadulterated hate, an expression she'd never seen from
Judging by their scents, thick dirt and old meat, and the fact that they had dæmons, Prosper thought it was most likely a family of ghouls. She waited, feeling the steady jitter of Dean's breathing against her back.  Hopefully they would catch Benny's scent instead of his, and move on.
"No, Dean," Jack said, with low, startling force. "I won't listen to you. Not about this." He looked back up; if he had been anything other than God, Dean might have described his expression as stoic, or maybe eerily calm. As it was, it was more than a little terrifying, to have that unflinching gaze levelled at him. Was it just Dean's imagination, or was there a yellow shine to his eyes, a faint shadowing of wings stretching up along the wall, like Jack had retreated into Godhood, or wrapped himself up in it like a blanket. "I'm sorry," Jack continued, in that same remote tone, "but this is my choice. I don't choose you." Then he blinked, and just like that he was Jack again, all clear, blue eyes, fresh-faced and young. "I'm...I'm sorry," he said again. "I think I should go."
She caught Dean and Sam as they were going up the stairs. The link and Dean's jaw tightened simultaneously when he saw her, and for a moment he almost seemed to walk faster, as if hoping to avoid her, before slowing to a halt and turning to face her. Sam and Temperance looked furtively back and forth between them, then at each other.
Well, not anymore. Whatever Sam had done, whatever deal he and Temperance had gotten themselves into, Dean was getting them out of it. No way was his baby brother going where he had been, never. Even if Dean had to be ripped apart again by hellhounds, even if they threw him back on the rack and he never saw Prosper again. It just wasn't happening. He and Prosper agreed on that at least. Always had.
She heard his footsteps before he opened the back door. She had felt it, a few moments earlier, when he woke up, startling out of a dream. The door opened smoothly, quietly; it had been catching against the old, swollen wood frame so Dean had spent an afternoon last week replacing pieces and repainting the door. Now he closed it behind him, a hum of quiet satisfaction reaching Prosper through their link.
Early in the morning, just as the sky was beginning to lighten but before Dean and Sam would willingly wake, Prosper and Temperance left the house and began their route through the salvage yard, checking traps and sigils. Delia checked them most mornings, but they had gotten in the habit of looking them over on her behalf whenever they stayed over at Bobby's. Good habits, Prosper assumed, were important in times like these. It sounded like something Delia might say, in any case.
"And here I thought they might have learned something," Crowley muttered. He sighed, and shifted Lovelace to his shoulder. Then he stepped around the corner, standing in full view in the middle of the hallway. "What are you doing, you stupid, bloody prats?!" He roared. Sam's eyes widened, his fingers flexing along the grip; Mary put a forestalling hand on his arm.
Castiel nodded his understanding, then spread his fingers wide along Dean's ribs. In many ways, he already possessed an intimate knowledge of this body. Dean was prone to injuries, the result of a disturbing lack of self-regard as much as his line of work, and Castiel had healed him often, pulled him back to his feet often, stood close to him and taken his cues where he could find them, from every minute tell of Dean's stance and expression. But this was new. He measured the rise and fall of Dean's lungs beneath his palms, pressed his thumbs in, tracing the line of muscles beneath the flesh. Grace could lay everything bare, break Dean's physical body down to neural networks and hormonal messaging, and how miraculous, that this could all be true, what Castiel knew intrinsically through his grace, and what his hands now told him. Desire hummed and burned, its origins unknowable. He tightened his grip on Dean, to show that he did indeed 'mean it', and Dean sucked in a breath.
"Oh, so you don't know? The father of God over here, and you didn't know that the residents of heaven can apparently just go popping off down to hell to have high tea with the Queen. I mean, you helped fucking build the place, and you're gonna tell me you didn't know?"
"That I needed you," Dean answered anyway, his voice an uneven scrape. "That I - long as I had Sammy, you know? That's what I always told myself. I didn't need anything or anyone else, long as Sam stuck with me. But then you, you were always showing up and disappearing again, and each time you came back I'd think, yeah, this is how it's supposed to be, and each time you fucking died on me I'd think, God, I'm alone, and - " Somehow, at some point, his head had dropped back down to Cas' shoulder, to the crook of his neck. Cas' hand had left his waist and was gripping him by the shoulder, hard, so hard. It had started and ended this way; it should always be this way. Dean gritted his teeth and forced himself to continue. " - And so I knew, somewhere in my goddamn head I always knew, but I still wouldn't have ever admitted it. How much I needed you. Fuck, Cas. How much I love you, too, I'm so fucking sorry I never said it back."
Castiel hadn't flown since the Fall, and he didn't recall ever having felt so acutely vertiginous as he did now. But then, he had never been hauled along in another angel's wake before, and certainly not an archangel. Perhaps Dean had been sincere all those times before, with his griping complaints of gastrointestinal issues following winged travel.
It was super weird, walking across the lot with Constant on his shoulder. Took Dean back to when he had been a kid and Prosper could still shift. Back then, she had tended to change into a bird when she wanted to seem aloof, which was a lot, or when she wanted to escape a situation, which was also a lot. Since she settled, Dean's only exposure to anything similar came from the rare occasions during a hunt that Temper had landed on his arm or shoulder, carrying a message from Sam. He wondered what the handful of people they passed thought, watching them go by. Did they think the two of them seemed mismatched? Could they tell that Constant wasn't his, did they assume that Dean was carrying his lover's dæmon around, the way some obnoxious couples did, swapping dæmons in the ultimate gag-inducing example of P.D.A.? Holy fuck, was that basically what he was doing right now? Embarrassingly enough, the realization didn't make him want to jam an iron bar through his temple.
"It's angels and demons, probably," Castiel said, leaning toward Dean to better convey his conviction. He turned to Framingham. "They're skirmishing all over the globe."
"You're such an asshole," Dean said. "Why the hell do I love that about you?" He ducked through the door before Castiel could summon a response. He looked at Prosper, smiled when her mouth dropped happily open. She pushed her nose into his palm, and he ran a hand along her, smoothing out the fur that he and Dean had ruffled.
"If Ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to," Cas said, with a hell of a lot more fire in his voice than he'd had ten seconds ago when he had been talking to Lord of the Stupid Vests. And that was why Dean never should have let him go in there alone. Two minutes by himself talking to a couple of angels, and they had somehow managed to beat Cas down.
"Save the sweet talk for the first date," Dean said with a too-wide grin. Cas only stared in answer, and Dean's grin stiffened. "Or hey," he said, digging himself in deeper, "let's just skip the foreplay and get straight to the fun stuff."
"Nice," he said (lying, mostly), when they stopped by silent agreement on a wooden bridge. He propped his elbow on the side and peered down at the water below them, hardly anything more than faint silver flashes of movement in the low light. "You been here before?"
Prosper chuffed in agreement. "Maybe even Karen." It would be easy, after having to watch Bobby flit around the edges of becoming a vengeful spirit, after watching his familiar face take on an entirely unfamiliar expression, to blame it all on Delia's absence. It was a common enough belief for hunters to have, especially among their dæmons; without a dæmon to guide them, becoming a vengeful spirit was every ghost's eventual fate. But that explanation felt too simple these days, almost like an excuse. If you didn't have a dæmon to guide and speak to you, you were destined for ruination? That couldn't be true, she refused to believe it was true.
And the truth was, Dean had done the right thing, keeping his promise to Sammy and bringing them here. This place was good for them. Lisa and Neco were good for them.
Sam glanced over his shoulder to smile at him, wry and uneven. Castiel didn't need to reach out with his grace to know that Sam's soul was currently suffused with sunset shades, warm arithmetic to contrast the heat and chill of Dean's iron reckoning. "It does. Thanks, Cas."
? I felt pissed off, how do you think I felt? Being fucking lied to, again, then getting told that Jack trusts that psychopath in a pant-suit more than me - "
"And Billie," Cas added. "Where would Chuck have gone, if you and Sam had killed him? Some questions remain unanswerable, even to Jack and Amara."
"No, Dean," Castiel replied, wearily angry. "They were prepared to beat and possibly kill a man based on a story that a young girl told them. I don't care what happens to them."
"You put them on me, dumbass." Castiel lifted them, set them hesitantly along Dean's side. He stared at Dean, waiting for further direction. Dean huffed and rolled his eyes. "C'mon, you can do better than that. You gotta grab on like you mean it." He demonstrated his point by sliding his hand further along Castiel's shoulder, pressing it firmly against the back of his neck.
He was alive. She didn't need to leap to his side to know that. She was alive, and so Dean was alive. But she still pressed her nose down against his throat, smelled his skin and felt the blood coursing steadily beneath it. Then she planted herself above him, and watched with Castiel as Sam lifted a hand and ended Alastair.
This was a pointless thought exercise. Also, Castiel was having difficulty thinking. "If - if earth was safe, and heaven and hell were both stable?" Dean nodded, the light moving across the bridge of his nose, his cheeks. "Then I suppose I would return to heaven."
Prosper stood up, which was enough to pull Dean back to wakefulness. He didn't move, waiting on her; she bent her head over him, huffing a breath over his cold cheek. "Ghouls," she growled.
The coyote dæmon snarled and twisted free from beneath the grip of the abnormally large bird dæmon, similar in shape to a turkey but far more vibrantly colored, that had been clawing at her. She lunged forward, her teeth finding the bird dæmon's throat, and the man who had been standing with his back to the door moved in a similar fashion, one quick, fierce burst. The other man screamed, something moving, grappling beneath his skin, and the first man pushed him away, rolling his body down the steps toward Emanuel. On the porch, the bird dæmon disintegrated, not into motes of floating Dust, but into a pile of heavy gray ash. The man landed at Emanuel's feet, and for a moment Emanuel saw - beneath his flesh, beneath his face - another face, ravaged and torn, mutilated - then it faded, leaving only an empty body.
Dean's mouth snapped shut. He bent over them, one hand settling on Prosper's back, the other fisting in the collar of Castiel's coat. He kissed Castiel, an abrupt, fierce point of contact, his breath gusting out sharply through his nose. Then he pulled away, his mouth settled in a tense line, his eyes shining.
So there they were again, in the furthest reaches of hell, the black rocks and the gray abyss stretching out before them, the confident crack of Rowena's voice as she worked her spell, the leap of cold flames as she summoned the cage.
"What about the name of one of the prophets?" Daphne suggested. She was sitting in front of her computer, scrolling down through lists of names. "We could call you Moses."
"Alright, don't sugarcoat it or nothin'." He sighed and slid down off the bed, slumping against the side of it and letting his arm fall across Prosper's back. "We're gonna figure it out." But he couldn't put any weight behind his words. First Sammy and Temper go and turn into freaking psychopaths on them, then Cas pops back on the scene all 'You think I came here for you?' Uh, yeah, you always did before, asshole! And now they'd ruined things with Ben and Lisa, she wasn't even answering his calls anymore, and why the hell would she, and everything, every little scrap that they'd held on to and used to propel one foot in front of the other, it was all falling apart.
"You okay?" Sam asked, watching Castiel as he reached out to Temperance, running soothing fingers along her white speckled feathers as he helped her back to her customary perch on his shoulders. The familiar motion increased Castiel's confusion, his unexpectedly deep need for...for the other part of
"Calling Crowley," Sam threw over his shoulder without breaking stride. "We're gonna need him to get us in."
Jack looked suddenly at him, his smile fading, as if he could feel Dean's abruptly darkening mood. He had been sitting with his plate balanced in his lap, dipping his burger in a well of ketchup like the child he was, but now he dropped it back to his plate, his expression sobering.
The darkness, when he opened his eyes, was absolute. The air was still and close, pressing in against him. Fear kicked in his chest; he was afraid again, and it was a living, human fear, not the mindless, shrieking terror of torture, the blighting of the senses, the blood and sinew of the pit.
Dean shoved him away, not too far though, just an arm's length, keeping a hard hold on either shoulder. "Where the fuck have you been?" He close to shouted, looking him over. He didn't seem hurt, didn't seem scared. "I've been looking all over for you." Sam was staring at him, that same mildly exasperated, assessing stare of his. He glanced to the side, where Charlie was still standing.
Prosper just wanted Temperance and Sam. But she and Dean had also needed to get away from them. So maybe she didn't really know what she wanted, either. "I don't have a choice, do I?"
"Jesus, no," Adam said, with sudden startling coldness. "Fuck them, and fuck family. No, you know why you're gonna lose, Lucifer? Why you've always lost?"
"We're finding Cas first," she said in answer, sniffing the air for his scent and not finding it. Dean agreed with her.
Constant continued to listen, dividing himself into further pieces in order to absorb the implications of what Castiel had learned from his captors. So the angel who had healed Sam had lied about their identity, not trusting Dean with the truth perhaps? Or perhaps not wanting to be known as a Winchester sympathizer? Either way, it was worth further investigation, and Castiel was to be commended for making note of it while under torture.
"Perhaps you think that you've lost Castiel, that my existence has halved him. I am by my very definition the absence of his grace -"
"Okay," she said, because she trusted him, had always trusted him last and longest. "We'll be in the war room." Castiel watched her go, followed after her with his grace until she was well away, then stretched his arm out, reaching under the pillow and pulling the colt free. He stared at it, then stood up, slipping it into his pocket. He would have to leave through the garage; he would have to leave quickly. He stepped from Dean's room, beside himself with misery. What a strangely succinct idiom. Beside himself. To have had the world wrenched sideways, leaving everything changed, and nothing.
Castiel didn't know what name to put to the feeling that came over him, watching Constant and Prosper speak to each other, touch each other there in the gap of space between himself and Dean. He felt oddly exposed, chokingly dispossessed, a similar shade to the feeling of being held helplessly down while Metatron extracted his grace from his throat. Something integral and deeply private was being shown to him, dragged from the recesses of awareness and held to the light. Castiel looked at Dean.
Granted, there was that one time that Cas and Meg had kissed. Twice. Up against a wall. Right in front of Dean and Sam. That had been weird, but then again, Cas had just watched porn for the first time, and when Dean had made a joke later about giving Cas an hour alone with her, his response had been a quietly mystified, "Why would I want that?" So Dean had written it off as an idle curiosity, similar to the time when Cas had reached over and taken Dean's coffee cup out his hand, his forehead creasing in concentration as he sipped it. "You drink coffee now?" Temperance had asked. "No, I don't think I do," Cas replied. And he never touched the stuff again, or at least, not that Dean had seen.
Castiel glanced around the room, allowing himself to absorb it, if not enjoy it, the patina of comfort and security that the bunker seemed to shine with. It was undoubtedly a side-effect of Sam and Dean's long habitation. The war room table was covered with Sam's neat handwriting, there was the faint smell of unwashed dishes emanating from the kitchen. Fridge-stale pizza and Dean's attempt at spaghetti. Gunpowder and aging book pages and soap and flesh. They were in every room, across every surface. "Should I..." He drifted off, gesturing behind him at the doorway that Dean and Prosper had disappeared through. "I'll go apologize to them."
"Michael," Dean said, like it wasn't awkward at all talking to the archangel that had wanted to jump his bones in the not-fun way and had settled for his half-brother instead. "Been a while." Michael didn't respond, didn't so much as blink.
He went to Viridius first, loosening the cloth that had been wrapped painfully tight around his snout to bind it shut, then moving on to the knot holding his legs. Viridius regained his feet, pressed his head against Emanuel's chest, and Emanuel smoothed a hand along the back of his neck to soothe him, then stood and circled behind the chair to free Daphne. Behind him, he heard a harsh whisper and then the sound of footsteps; the man and his dæmon entering the house slowly, cautiously.
" - No, screw that, I mean it," Dean said, not looking away from Castiel. "You're an angel, so what? All of a sudden none of the rest of it matters? You don't belong up there with those ungrateful assholes, Cas. You belong here, with us."
"You know," Castiel repeated, bitter enough to make Dean's eyes narrow. "What can you possibly know about what I might want?"
Castiel stared at him, that old stare of his, like he was looking beyond muscle and bone to all the squirmy, secret shit beneath. He lifted a hand, and tapped Kevin's nose with the tip of his finger. "Boop." Kevin stared at him. His dæmon, who had burrowed herself so far beneath his collar that only her red, bushy tail was visible, popped her head back out. Cas turned away from him. "Meg, are you hurt?"
"You fellas are gonna try, you know, whatever. Whatever you're gonna try. But you can't kill me. You've never been able to kill me, and with witch bitch gone, you can't put me back in the cage, so like I said, you don't matter." Dean's hand curled into Prosper's fur; she leaned against his leg, looking up at Sam, at the phone in his hand. "Okay?" Lucifer said, his voice insidiously soft. "Buh-bye."
"What do you want to tell him?" Castiel asked, on the absolute precipice. Dean laughed, close to wild, to broken.
Dean shrugged, glancing over his shoulder at where Sam and Bobby were sitting together at Bobby's desk, marking routes on a map. "Don't know." But he had a suspicion. "She's around here somewhere." He took a pull of his beer, searching for a change of subject. "Here's a question, Ellen." She raised a brow. "What's next for you after we gank the devil and save the world? Any plans? A new and improved Roadhouse?"
"Dean - " Castiel started to say, stopping when the sound of a low, deep rumbling reached him through the phone.
"Well, I'm pretty irresistible," Dean said, his lip twitching, then giving way, his smile growing incandescent. "Even you would have to get a clue eventually."
"Welcome to the human condition," Temperance said, rousing good-humoredly as best she could from her cramped position.
"Fine, alright? I felt sick, is that what you wanna hear? I felt - fuck." He dropped his head, pressed it against the back of his fingers, the towel. "I felt so freaking tired, man, you have no idea." He breathed in, back out, raised his head. "But that's just because I've been on the bench too long, you know? Been sitting around getting fat off cheeseburgers in paradise. I can shake it off."
"I...to be honest, I mostly felt relieved." Dean made a noise of disbelief and Cas' fingers squeezed along his knee in response. "It's the truth. After being in the Empty, dreaming about my mistakes, my failures, and there are many, Dean, more than you know, it - it was an incredible relief, to be able to have that."
"You're damn right you're not," he said. A moment of strained quiet, then, halting and forced, "I kinda need you around."
"Um." Castiel gestured awkwardly toward the door, very aware of the many eyes observing him. "If you don't mind." Michael raised a brow, but turned wordlessly toward the door and preceded Castiel from the room.
The dæmon finally pulled away, wings beating to pull it further aloft. Constant watched it fly westward, inwardly scoffing. It must truly think him as limited in thought as any other angel, to assume he was foolish enough to follow after it, in what was clearly the wrong direction. He didn't know where Castiel was, but he knew the angels couldn't have taken him far from the motel where they had picked him up, judging from how quickly they had begun torturing him. Furthermore, he recognized an attempt to lure him out when he saw it.
"How much longer?" Dean asked. Prosper knew what he meant: how much longer until she could let it go, how much longer until she didn't feel this damned restless call for movement.
"No, it's more than that," she insisted. Dean scoffed, and she circled around the coffee table, close enough to touch. Dean didn't touch her. "Do you even remember Sam?" She asked accusingly.
"No," Cas said curtly, already walking past them toward Kevin. He sat down in the spot that Dean had abandoned, half-lifting a hand and holding it out to Nomi. "May I?" He asked, rumbling and low, tires over gravel.
He frowned and picked at the chicken breast that she insisted he eat. "I don't think I would enjoy that." Moses, he was certain, had been a dogmatic ass-butt.
" - Hold up," Temperance said, whip-like, her eyes intensifying on Dean. "What do you mean, if he was still human?" Dean stared at her, unbalanced, teetering. "Are you talking about Connie?"
Dean didn't know the area particularly well, but that didn't matter: he had always had a knack for getting lost. It only took him an hour or so of driving around to find his way to a good spot, a one lane dirt road running along a wide stretch of plain. Once he was confident that they had left the rest of humanity as far behind as they could, Dean pulled Baby to a stop and turned her off.
"Dude!" Dean threw his hand out, and nearly sent his beer flying. "That's private shit, what the hell?"
"This is the first opportunity I've had to ask," Cas said, his gaze moving between Dean and Prosper. "Did everything go alright with Benny and Evangeline?"
"He's gonna get himself killed." Prosper still remembered the way Chuck's house had smelled afterwards, the stench of flesh, ripe but not yet rotting, the lingering smell of wiring burnt out by a powerful surge.
"Huh," Adam said, rubbing his thumb and index finger across his chin in consideration. "That'd be some twist, wouldn't it? Make peace with Satan himself, the guy who did his best to torture and kill us for hundreds of years and also wants to destroy the earth." He made a face. "You know what, I think we'll pass."
"Yes, ma'am," he said, grinning, grabbing two more, one for him and one for Linda. He sat down on the edge of the opposite bed, watching as Nomi slid out of Kevin's arm, coming to perch on his knee. Prosper approached her carefully, sitting in front of her and pushing her nose tentatively forward. Dean gestured at Kevin's hand. "How's that feeling?"
Their time in hell, for one. It was still the most common of their shared nightmares: finding themselves back in the pit, reliving years of horrors. She also couldn't stand to remember that day in Cold Oak, when Temperance had disappeared right beneath her, turned to nothing under her touch, how she had howled and nosed along the dirt where her body had just been while Dean cradled Sam in his arms. Or the day that John and Clementine died, trading themselves away for Dean and Prosper's life, or the way Lisa had looked laying in that hospital bed, the way Ben had refused to look at them at all.
"You okay, Cas?" She asked. He looked tired and unhappy, but that wasn't unexpected. He had also, disconcertingly, grown facial hair in the time that they had been apart. Prosper didn't know what all went into maintaining a vessel, but clearly Cas had either ceased to care or hadn't been able to keep up with it.
"You know, the fights they would get into, the shit they would say to each other. And then Clementine would eventually just clam up and wouldn't let you or Temper near her, and Dad would get drunk, or pull out his journal, or run us through drills. Seems like the only thing they ever agreed on was hunting down Mom's killer." He waited a moment, but Prosper didn't speak. "You remember?"
"Stop showboating and just call the damn thing," Crowley muttered, pacing back and forth behind her. He looked calm enough, but Lovelace had disappeared into his pocket, and that told Dean all he needed to know about his state of mind.
"- Hold up, Dean," Temperance said. Kevin was panting, struggling to not pull away; Linda was half-rising from her seat. "Give him a chance."
"Why, you got somewhere to be in the morning? Gotta go kiss more feathered ass? Or maybe you and Sammy have some special archangel shit to do behind my back."
"Understand what?" Dean was trying to catch his gaze again; Castiel stared resolutely over his shoulder, seeing nothing. His hand twitched, remembering the patterns Dean's fingers had traced along its palm. Often just thinking about it was enough to make the nerves beneath his skin light up with false sensation.
"What're you saying?" Prosper said into the stunned silence. Rowena didn't answer except to glare at her, at all of them. "No. No, this can't be it, there has to be a way."
"Still in heaven," Constant answered for him. "Metatron had not yet cast him down." Dean stared at Castiel a moment longer before turning away, and Castiel, for reasons he was slowly beginning to discern the shape and weight of, found himself remembering Metatron's words.
"Yeah, you do. That's kinda the whole point here." It was pitch black with the door closed, so he stumbled his way forward by memory until he found the nightstand and the lamp on top. He clicked it on, then took a seat in the room's only chair, a spindly little thing that had clearly not been crafted with the comfort of a full-grown adult in mind, so why the hell was it even here? Not like the Men of Letters raised their families in the bunker, or at least, Dean didn't think they had. "You remember how Dad and Clementine were?" He asked.
"Just didn't bet on you actually - I mean, hell, Cas, I didn't even think you were interested in that."
Dean spun, hitting the one holding him in the stomach, and got tossed against an oversized metal canister for his efforts. They exchanged blows, then the demon's fist slammed down against the crux of Dean's neck and shoulder, and Dean fell to the floor. He could feel Prosper's desperation, surrounded by the dæmons, Temperance diving down from above to prevent them from closing in on her. Dean flipped to his back, just in time to get hit twice in the face in quick succession. A figure appeared beside them, a palm thrust against the demon's forehead, and radiance poured from his eyes and mouth as Claire, no, Castiel, burned him out. Dean jumped to his feel, scanning the room. Prosper had the last dæmon, a big, long-legged bird, on the ground, and was darting in for the throat, but the thing was putting up a fight, kicking and twisting its long neck to snap at her. Temperance was swooping across the room to return to Sam, landing with a rustling of her wings on his shoulder while he - while he -
"For the love of - you - " Dean groaned, his anger flagging and faltering before it could even get off the ground. He dragged a hand down his face, Jack disappearing behind his palm, reappearing again as concerned and trusting as he had always been. "Okay, first off, nobody wants you listening in on their thoughts, alright? And I get it, you're God now, you probably can't help it, but at least don't go around talking about all the shit you hear." He gestured between them. "If it was something I wanted you to know, I would've said it out loud to your face."
None of them had offered their names, which was telling enough in Prosper's opinion. Samuel could toss the word 'clan' and 'family' around as much as he wanted, but so far Prosper only knew Jokasta, and that was from nearly three years prior when Castiel had sent her and Dean back in time.
Sam turned to face him, looked at Dean and lifted his hand, and for a moment Dean thought - but it was to stop the final demon from coming up behind him, the one wearing Amelia Novak. She convulsed in Sam's grip, smoke pouring off of her dæmon and out of her mouth. Castiel stepped around her and walked away, so Dean was the one who went to her side as she knelt on the floor and gasped in huge, shocked breaths. Prosper joined him, collapsing down beside Amelia's dæmon and talking to him quietly, urging him up, assuring him that he was alright. Dean helped Amelia to her feet, and didn't look at Sam as they followed after Castiel.
"You mean undoing the runes currently binding him to his vessel," Rowena answered flatly. "It's possible, theoretically. If I had him in front of me, and if Diarmuid were with me."
Seeing Sammy again was like...like being able to finally take a deep breath, no longer having to fight for each lungful.
"Yeah, Delia, heard you the first ten times." Dean didn't need to look at Bobby to know he was bristling up, so he talked fast to get ahead of it. "What do you say we ring the dinner bell?" He and Prosper watched as Bobby began the summoning, chanting over the bowl while Delia stood attentively beside him. They looked more than a little ridiculous; a scruffy, ball-capped man who might have walked straight out of a low-budget truck commercial and his laughably predictable coonhound dæmon. Just went to show that appearances didn't mean shit, and neither did all those dumb 'What Your Dæmon Says About You' guides. Dean glanced at Prosper, tilted his head; she stood up and started making a circuit of the room, her ears pricked forward attentively. After a moment Delia joined her, nose lowered and sweeping back and forth, although Dean didn't know what scent she expected to catch over all the fresh spray paint. He got comfortable on one of the tables, and Bobby took a similar position across the way, and they waited.
"Okay," he said, gesturing with his beer. "That's a stupid freaking idea." He caught a sinuous movement out of the corner of his eye, and glanced over Sam's shoulder just in time to watch Jo's ass rising up out of its seat. Jo had a great ass, plump enough for a guy to hold on to, and those long limbs of hers, those legs. Sam turned in his seat to follow Dean's gaze.
No such luck. She heard a muttering voice, listened as the sound of their footsteps slowed and stopped. Listened to them listening for her.
"Dean," Castiel yelled, as Adam's eyes filled with stark blue light, Michael assuming control, his blade appearing in his hand. Lucifer finally managed to free his trapped arm and blade, turning, using another concentrated push of grace to aid him, ripping free of the lion's teeth at the expense of his vessel's flesh.
So he fried up some bacon, nice and crisp, none of that soft chewy crap, not for a PB&J. He pulled the sandwiches apart and layered their centers with the too-hot bacon, then folded them back together, licking the grease from his fingers. He pulled two beers from the fridge and put it all on the kitchen table. Then he turned around, looking up through the window.
"What?" Cas didn't answer, lifting his hand from his shoulder and moving it down, laying two fingers against the edge of Dean's hand. The pads of his fingers were rough, and surprisingly warm, real and immediate in a way that Dean for some reason hadn't expected. There was the familiar warm shock of Cas' grace, the flow of it beneath Dean's skin, and it was only then, after the damage had been reversed, that Dean noticed how his hand had been hurting. He rubbed his fingers along his knuckles reflexively. "Huh. Thanks."
"I can off myself?" Dean clarified, after a long, stunned moment. He pointed at himself, like there might be some kind of misunderstanding. Cas nodded. "And go where?"
They had only stuck together long enough to leave a note and then the bunker, traveling with Crowley to a low-lit bar, all warm amber wood and gleaming glass bottles. The music and conversation had been muted, the patrons well-dressed.
"'Cause you held out so well, right? Don't bullshit me, I know the truth." Alastair had told him, repeatedly, gleefully. God, he hated himself.
"It's Caesura," Metatron's dæmon said. "Don't mind me, go ahead and talk. After all, who am I gonna tell?"
He turned his head, sunlight fighting its way through pale, opaque curtains, casting hazy patterns on the floor and the bedspread. He didn't know this room. He didn't know...
April kissed his cheek, and the skin beneath her lips lit up in a tingling dance. Inexplicably, Castiel thought of Anna, gouging herself free of her grace, hungry for human pleasures before she could even comprehend their meaning. He had thought at the time that her daring could only be matched by her foolishness. But now -
"I'm not gonna crack," she promised grimly. They both had their ways of coping: Dean's nightly tumblers and her nightly excursions out of the house. Ben and Lisa had been the right call, Ben and Lisa had swiftly become the adjusted center of their world, but there were some needs that they would never be able to alleviate. The need to hunt, to pack up and go, the next town, the next case. The people and people-adjacent beings that they missed and would most likely never see again.
"Whoa," Charlie said, stopping at the bottom of the stairs. She had a large, plum-dark bruise along the corner of her mouth, but it did nothing to dampen her growing smile. Enzo hovered over her shoulder, filling the air with a soft, steady hum.
"Dude. No." Dean looked away, flustered and confused, because no, it didn't make him uncomfortable. Whenever he tried to think about it too much, this new thing between him and Cas, that somehow didn't feel new at all, that somehow just felt right, it wasn't discomfort that started to build up in his stomach, or embarrassment or shame, or even desire or longing. It was bitter, biting rage. It made him fucking furious. He took a breath, clenching his jaw and fighting the feeling back down. "I'm fine with it," he managed to grit out from behind his teeth. He could feel Cas staring at the side of his face; he trained his gaze resolutely forward and kept walking.
." Which was so patently untrue, Prosper didn't bother to dignify it with a response. "I'll do the heavy lifting. You just sit there and look pretty."
Prosper hesitated, watching the dæmon. It was looking through her, not at her. Why would Castiel care that Dean was drowning her with his pain, that he was seething and burning with it?
Sam cleared his throat. "Cas, you just lost Connie. Your dæmon. Maybe you should take some time, you know?"
Dean didn't remember much of their escape, he was so furious, so desperately, hopelessly enraged. He vaguely remembered fighting their way out, remembered Prosper's voice, Sam's hands trying to hold him back, to keep him from charging recklessly forward. He remembered hex bags that melted demons into liquid pools, and the jarring sight of Gallant and Lovelace moving in tandem, Lovelace with her twitching nose lowered to the ground, Gallant standing guard over her. But most of it was a red-tinged blur. All that, breaking into hell and rescuing Rowena, summoning the cage, freeing Michael, it had all been a mistake. He'd flown off and left them, and Lucifer was still going to kill Cas.
in heaven. And not problems like gateways to hell blasting open, or the four horsemen of the apocalypse rolling out onto the world, or angels falling to the earth. Just normal problems, like a pipe busting, or a board coming loose on the steps, or even a goddamn mole moving into his yard.
"It has something to do with the Mark," Constant said, still puzzling over Dean. But he knew that the Mark wasn't truly at fault, even as he said it.
"Wouldn't matter to us," he answered finally, reaching out to rub a hand along Prosper's neck. "Sammy'd still be the world."
"What?" Dean said. His head swiveled back and forth between Sam and Temperance, Mary and Gallant. "Seriously?"
He was distantly aware of Constant's discomfort, of the way he shied away from April's dæmon, fleeing in shuffling increments across the headboard. What, Castiel wondered, did Prosper do in situations like this, when Dean was lost in the warm body of a stranger, shared pleasure their only intimacy? Did she pace the room? Did she stare the other dæmon down, the way she used to watch Castiel in the days before she trusted him? He would have to apologize to Constant, for ignoring his wishes. Later. After.
"He doesn't know me from Adam," Constant said, a colloquialism that he must have picked up from his memories of Dean.
And yet, what was love, but the continuous decision to choose another, to choose them again and again, every day anew? Circumstances might change, time and fate might bend and shape them, but the choice, the
"Okay, why don't you come back down to earth with the rest of us," Prosper almost growled. "This is Cas. It's non-negotiable." That last statement was directed behind them, toward Crowley and Lovelace. Dean felt a surge of something like satisfaction move through him, through the link; it was the first time in way too fucking long that he and Prosper were in each other's corner. Prosper's ear twitched in his direction, as if she were tracking a sound instead of the stupid hopeful jumble in his chest. She moved away, putting a deliberate distance between herself and the room's inhabitants, Dean included.
Michael stared at him, his great wings curling intently as he assessed Castiel, picking through his grace and the features of his vessel. "Our brothers and sisters weren't exaggerating, then," he said finally. "You did have a dæmon."
"So, safest bet is to sit tight." Prosper, dripping wet and miserable in the back seat, coiled her muscles surreptitiously, but Dean spoke again before she could do anything further. "You shake water all over our Baby, you're walking back." He twisted in his seat to reach her, running the rag roughly along her fur. "Ugh, you stink."
When they had first come to stay with Lisa and Ben, Prosper had spent restless nights prowling around the house, a stifling, mind-numbing circle through familiar scents. They had only been there a few weeks when Lisa returned home after work one day with an animal door that she had Dean install in the corner of the garage. "Just in case you ever feel like a little fresh air," she said to Prosper with a soft smile and an accompanying wink. Dean had grumbled, but put the door in where Lisa instructed him. That night after she and Neco fell asleep, they came back down to take it apart again, lining the door's inner grooves with wards and salt.
Thank fuck Veritas lived in Casa de Douchebag, a good distance away from the humans she had been feeding on, or else there might have been someone around to spot them dragging Sam and Temperance's bodies back to the Impala.
"Gotta say, buddy," Dean said to his Cas, his best friend, "I wasn't sure what I'd be looking at here. Thought I might be talking to some huge, rainbow-colored bird-lizard or something." But instead it was just Cas, with the same weary shadows beneath his eyes, the same somber mouth. The Cas that had stood in front of Dean and said...said all that stuff that he had said.
No, this felt like a gathering storm, pregnant and laden with rain. This felt like the moment the clouds burst, the imbalance too great, lightning discharging in a flash of heat and violence to bridge the distance, the surrounding air swelling, gathering breath to shout the heavens down.
"Well, let's see. Fox dæmon, sulfur stink, and a tiny, feisty redhead shouting a bunch of mumbo jumbo. That sound like Rowena to you?"
"And if he doesn't find something?" Castiel asked. "If you run out of time, could either of you kill an innocent?"
"You don't improve on a classic," Ellen answered instantly. "And some things can't be replaced." She glanced over at Kairos. "That said, who knows? There's all kinds of roads. Hell, maybe we'll settle down around here, help Bobby and Delia out with this scrap heap."
"You should have found a rock to hide under while you had the chance," another voice said, one of their dæmons probably, advancing down the hallway toward Crowley.
"You too, huh?" He slammed the car door shut and turned to face her. "Do me a favor, don't act like you're doing it for Cas. You've been wanting this for years."
"About as good as you'd expect," Sam said grimly. He looked at them, he and Temperance both, hard and challenging. "Are we going?"
They didn't speak at first as they circled the encampment, attentive to their task. Prosper lowered her head to the earth, her paws crunching lightly over pinecone-like detritus, except these gave off a cloyingly sweet scent instead of a normal pinecone's fresh sharp smell. She listened intently for any unexpected sounds, which in Purgatory meant any sound at all. The wildlife here exceled at silence, the better to hide from the many monsters that might be on the hunt for an easy meal. Castiel, she assumed, was scanning the area in his own weird, angelic way, a level of awareness that she couldn't begin to imagine.
"Well," Metatron said, gesturing as expansively as he could with his cuffed hands. "We're here. Do you want your grace or not?" Castiel considered striking him again. Instead he opened his door.
He shrugged, keeping his focus on Prosper, her gold-tipped ears and the wending trail of ruffled fur his fingers were leaving across her neck and back. "Self-preservation, man. Look, I get that you're all about this kinda shit, you know, the whole honesty thing, and talking about our feelings, but that - I mean, what's the point if it's not gonna change anything?"
"That, um." Sam and Temperance looked at each other, a swift, inscrutable exchange, too intimate to interpret. "You know what, that's a good idea. You should talk to them." Now he was nodding at Castiel, with far more enthusiasm than the situation warranted, but then, perhaps Castiel had been too long in heaven.
"Heaven," Dean said, smirking and finger-gunning with more assurance than he actually felt. At least, they had been talking about heaven, he had no idea what the fuck they were talking about now. Charlie leaned in toward him, her elbows propped on the counter.
"You were speaking in tongues," the dæmon, Viridius, said. "Prophesizing. Daphne thought it best that we bring you home so we could tend to you."
At first she barely noticed it, scarcely more than a twinging pain along her ribs, as if she had run too far and too hard, except that was laughable, because she didn't have physical limitations any longer. Prosper dismissed it; after all, what was pain besides another sensation, as satisfying in its own way as the sight of the heavy-laden, pregnant moon, or the headyingly full taste of fresh meat. One of the many perks of becoming a demon: discovering the pleasures of food. When she had been alive, she had only eaten sparingly, from curiosity rather than need.
"I don't know," Castiel answered honestly. "He said he would be, but I suspect he was lying." Prosper's ears twitched, her mouth opening, a sign of her amusement. Impossibly, Castiel felt the corner of his own lip twitch in response. "If he is here, I can't feel him."
What would happen if he prayed to him? Would Cas be the only one who could hear it, or would Lucifer be listening in? Would Cas even notice at this point, or was he buried down so far even prayers couldn't get through?
It was another aspect of his gift, one that sometimes seemed more intimate to Emanuel, a true gift, bestowed upon him for the pleasure it brought. He knew this couldn't be the case; God was not so frivolous with his gifts. But it did please him, to press a dutiful kiss to Daphne's cheek, to grant Viridius a parting touch. To walk down the steps and then the sidewalk. Sometimes it only took a few minutes, sometimes he walked for hours. But eventually something would shift in him, like a lost thought almost recalled, or weakened muscles made momentarily strong. And in that transcendent instant, Emanuel flew. Or perhaps it simply felt like flying.
They pulled apart, picking back up where they had left off with the staring. Cas was looking more than a little stupefied, his eyes wide and intent as they roved across Dean's face, searching for that elusive something that Dean had never been able to put the perfect name to. Whatever it was, Cas must have picked up its trail, because he smiled, sudden and startlingly large and sweet. "That was...unexpected," he said.
"I'm leaving," she answered. She knew what her days would be like if she hung around with Dean: seedy bars and seedier sex, pointless drunken fistfights and the same goddamn songs they had been listening to for the past thirty years. She was done with all the noise, done with his voice in her ear.
"Sure," Prosper said, because Dean wasn't here to say it on their behalf, "You're the one who wanted Cas to 'punish' us with an angel blade."
He, of course, preferred that Dean not be angry at all, but it seemed to be a core tenet of his personality. His anger was a creature in its own right, mutable and fierce, a fire with a glut of fuel to feed on. Sometimes, usually in moments of physical danger, Dean and Prosper's anger seemed to be of a matching frequency. They were quick, implacable, sharp teeth and murderous intent. But more often than not they seemed misaligned in their anger. Prosper only grew truly angry when someone she cared for was directly threatened; more existential dangers and the staggering injustices of recent days left her only wearily grim. These were the matters that Dean raged against for both their sakes.
"I guess you're right," he muttered, and stroked the spot between her ears with sullen appreciation for its texture.
"There is no out," Castiel said to the prophet Kevin Tran, holding him in place by the fabric of his shirt while his dæmon clung to his shoulder and chittered with fear and anger. "Only duty." Dean and Prosper stood nearby, frustrated and displeased, but the stakes were too high for anything other than the stark, unhappy truth. The truth was, they all had their roles that they must play, regardless of how it left them scattered in the aftermath. The Winchesters would shut the gates of hell, and Castiel in turn would shut the gates of heaven, freeing the earth from both infernal and celestial machinations. Peace, happiness, healing: these were rewards Kevin, Sam and Dean would have to seek after their mission had succeeded. As for Castiel, the point was moot. It was no reward, to be locked away in heaven, parted from those he most cared for. But there was no going back, no other becoming.
Their conversation had veered in an unexpected direction, moving over treacherous, shifting ground. Castiel couldn't comprehend any of these new, unexpected concepts. A shared existence, a companion to help him bear the weight; what it might mean to them both, to be loved by the greatest of souls. He cleared his throat.
"An admirable idea." His dæmon pressed one foot against the back of Castiel's neck; Castiel bent his head forward obediently so that he could cross the bridge of upper vertebra to his other shoulder. "What do we wish for ourselves?"
"For what? You don't even need to breathe." But Dean helped him to his feet anyway, knocking Kevin's knees out of the way and maneuvering him around the bed.
"Sam. Jack." His shoes were still off, and now his socks had disappeared too. Dean goggled, watching Cas as he padded barefoot across the warm wooden porch boards, stopping at Sam's side and lifting a hand out to take the bowl of boring salad. No coat, no shoes or socks, what was next? Strip poker? Skinny dipping? He looked away, turning back to the grill and listening with half an ear as the three of them talked. It probably didn't bode well for whatever it was that Sam was going to tell him, the fact that he had brought Jack along. It was going to piss him the hell off, whatever it was, but he was willing to let that simmer for now, leave it untouched for a few more hours. After all, when was the last time they had been together like this? Just the four of them, no one else but them: Dean's smallest definition of family outside of Sammy, undefinable and off-balance and perfect.
That was what had eventually shut Dean up. Cas had glanced over Dean's shoulder, toward where Jack was standing wide-eyed, Juniper clutched against his chest as they listened to Dean argue at Cas' resigned face, and when he looked back at Dean something in his expression had shifted, turned entreating. And Dean had groaned, and rubbed a hand down his face, and said, "Don't give me that, you know we're gonna look after them for you."
"Human convention in this hemisphere typically affords the naming rights of a dæmon to its dæmonic parents."
"Holy shit, Cas," he muttered, his lips so warm and imminent that Castiel could feel their phantom touch along his cheek. He shivered, the entirety of his vessel drawing tighter, nearer. "That was too fucking close, man." And then, absurdly, he began to laugh. Their brows still pressed together, his shoulders shaking with mirth, his chest heaving. Castiel frowned into the scant space separating their faces and raised a hand to Dean's sternum to push him away so he could see his face. Dean, when he lifted his head and looked at him, only laughed harder, his hands dropping to clutch on to Castiel's arms, his head dropping against Castiel's shoulder. Castiel glanced at Prosper, but she seemed well, leaning against Dean's legs with a joyful open mouth, her tail moving in a dizzying circle. So Castiel waited, and held him.
"Naomi's priority has always been the stability of heaven," Cas said. "Sam and I, our loyalty is clearly with the earth, and with heaven's human residents. We needed someone to speak for the other angels."
"I'm sorry," he said again, some time later, after he had risen from the bed at Daphne's urging, following her and Viridius downstairs, where she offered him food and drink. He eventually accepted a glass of soda water; the bubbles tickled curiously along the back of his throat. "I don't know where my dæmon is." To be amnesiac was one thing, to have misplaced one's own dæmon was quite another. "And I feel that you should be more concerned by this than you seem to be."
"Give them some time," Temperance said. "For Prosper to warm back up." She turned her head toward Sam, her black-tipped beak sifting through his hair.
"If you're just sticking with me 'cause we love the same people, you shouldn't." A thrum of shock, of heightened curiosity. But no pain, thank fuck. Either the idea didn't hurt her at all or she was picking up on all the shit he couldn't communicate other than through their link. "I'm not saying you should leave or nothing, but we've got other options. We could try that new pill they've got out, the one that's supposed to kill what we got between us, or hell, we could go for the nuclear option and get that surgery. I'd get a hold of the money one way or another." He felt like maybe he was manipulating her, by keeping his chest open so she could feel everything that he felt when he thought too hard about doing either of those things, but God, he needed to be honest. "You said before that I want free of Sam and Cas, and yeah, I do sometimes. Sometimes I hate," he raised a hand, gestured vaguely toward his throat, his heart, "all this. But I'm still here 'cause it's where I wanna be." He stopped again, fought to pull in his scattered thoughts. "It's like, when you love someone, you have to give something up to them, something that should be just yours, you know? If I'm not giving that up, then what the hell am I putting on the table? And it pisses me off sometimes, knowing that I'd give up fucking everything. Makes me feel, I don't know. Helpless, I guess. And then I'd get mad at you, because you would just keep - fucking - " his throat tried to close up, he forced himself to continue, " -
"Where to, darling?" Lovelace asked, scampering down from Crowley's knee to stand beside Prosper's paw. Prosper growled and gnashed her teeth at her. "Then again," Lovelace said, retreating back up Crowley's leg. "Maybe I'll stick with you boys for a bit."
"No," Castiel said shortly as he slammed the door closed and paced away, "You should speak to me." Something was unraveling, loosening, soon lost. "We agreed that we would always speak to each other." He turned as far away as he could, keeping Metatron in the corner of his vision, focusing his attention on Constant. When he lifted his arm and held it out in front of him, Constant hesitated, then reluctantly shuffled down to his forearm so that they could face one another.
, that they were going to die, and then watching two ancient beings choose to let go and hold on and try again, well, that had put an end to any last remnant of distance between them.
Something, they had to do something. Behind them, out of sight but not out of awareness, Prosper and Temperance were still working together, outnumbered, only capable of harrying the dæmons. If they somehow managed to get the upper hand, it could draw enough attention for Sam and Dean to act, to turn this around. But he couldn't count on that, and they were running out of time. The demon was walking up to Jimmy's daughter, kicking Paola away as she clawed at him. He was picking up an iron bar, Jimmy dragging himself after him.
"I won't allow anything to happen to either of you," Cas answered, as if that was what Prosper had been worried about. "But all the same, I have something to say to you."
"Not all of them, Dean." He glanced at Hael, standing some distance away and clutching her vessel's dæmon to her chest the way a human child might clutch a doll. "Some are just looking for direction. Some are just lost."
"You're not trapped here for eternity, Dean. Heaven is not a cage. If you choose to, you can end your existence here. Anyone can."
And Claire's head shot up, her hand lifting to catch the bar, pulling it in and to the side, and the demon along with it. The demons' back was to them, but Dean could see golden light, could hear the demon's short, strangled cry.
"No!" She wheeled around, running back to the door. He had gone in without her, left her locked outside with no way to reach Dean. She scrabbled fruitlessly at the door, her claws screeching across the rusted metal. "Dean! Dean!" In the room beyond, she could hear the faint, scuffling sounds of struggle. She bent her nose to the floor, breathed in sulfur, stagnant water and blood. She could feel a howl building in her throat.
"I think they'll be fine," Castiel answered. He shifted in his seat, sticking his leg out akimbo so that Constant could perch on his knee, closer to Prosper. She stayed beside Dean but craned her neck forward so that they could touch, so that Constant's vision was filled with the reddish fur of her nose, her amber eyes. He purred happily. He knew that Castiel was watching them out of the corner of his eye, that Dean was purposefully not watching them at all.
But she wouldn't leave him, because she wouldn't leave Sammy. Dean fixed that in his mind, the unshakeable bedrock that everything else he knew was built upon. No one else loved Sammy and Temperance like Dean did, except for Prosper. At the end of the day, there was only one thing that mattered to them both: taking care of Sam. As long as they had that purpose to hold on to, they would have each other.
But then he'd have to break this stillness, this hush. He'd have to ruin this moment, the two of them at some sort of hesitant, careful understanding, sheltered by this blanket of stars.
Sam's mouth dropped open. "Wait, seriously? You never...when, though? You know what, never mind, I don't want to know."
So yeah, heaven was weird as fuck, heaven didn't make much sense if he really thought about it, but that didn't mean it wasn't awesome. Sammy right down the road, Bobby and Mom and Dad and the Roadhouse a little bit further down a couple other roads, Charlie in the nearby metropolitan area that she claimed to have largely built herself, with minimal angelic assistance. The way she and Ash told it, Jack and Cas had provided the outline and the raw power, and the two of them had done the rest.
"Maybe someday," Cas said hesitantly, hoarse-voiced and low. "When we're ready." And he lifted his hand from Dean's knee, sliding his arm slowly, carefully, around Dean's back, his hand fumbling along his side for a place to settle. They held on to each other, there on the steps of their back porch, and Dean watched the sun tip up over the horizon, his thoughts stretching out to meet it. He hadn't let himself dream or hope for much, when he had been alive. But up here...there might be enough space for it, up here.
Emanuel stood alone, demons at his back, a great, yawning space opening up before him. They were talking about him, although he didn't know why, or what it was about him that they felt the need to discuss in secret. Either way, the dæmon had been right. Dean's brother was in grave need of their assistance, and they had little time.
"Whose do you think?" She snapped. Another wave of grace washed over them, pushing them once more against the house. "Inside, inside, inside," Clarimond chanted. "Michael said the safest place to be is near the nephilim. He'll automatically protect himself from harm, so you guys should be shielded too."
Were they still connected, Castiel would surely feel this surge of exasperated affection. As it was, Constant was forced to resort to pulling at his hair with his beak. Castiel smiled, tipping his head in toward him.
"He's not a human, Prosper." She tried to pull away from him, but Dean held on, forcing her to stay beside him, to listen. "He doesn't even - that's just something he's sitting in. It's a vase, we're talking about fucking a vase." Shit, he was sweating, he was freezing and sweating at the same time, and his breath was coming all fast and thin, whistling through his stopped up throat. "You know that makes Cas a bunch of flowers, right? I mean, how fucked in the head does a guy have to be to somehow think he's got goddamn
ing shrilly beneath one of Delia's sturdy paws, her huge wings moving the air around, struggling to break free but unwilling to use her talons or beak.
"I like it," Constant said. He tilted his head to one side, then the other. "Do you think Dean will give me a nickname?" He asked hopefully.
Dean turned away as Emanuel approached, saying something to his dæmon. She answered back, and Dean made a short, abortive gesture with his hand, his features tightening in annoyance. He opened the back door, and Emanuel reached the car just in time to pick up his terse, "- keep it to yourself," as he shut it behind her. He turned to Emanuel, flashing him a hard smile, a baring of teeth. "Ready to go?"
"Dean said it earlier," Prosper went on, ignoring Dean and talking directly to Sam and Temperance, Dean freaking hated it when they talked around him like that. "He tried to be something that he's not, for us, and it broke him."
"It's Winchester," she answered, still walking away. "And we're done here." She nodded to Rowena, and Rowena raised a brow in reply, her hands lifting, hovering over the spell-bowl.
Castiel had always enjoyed Dean's car, primarily for the penumbra of contentment that Dean so often radiated when he was driving it, or rather, her, as Dean had assured Castiel on multiple occasions that the Impala was gendered and a female. As a human, Castiel could no longer bask in the warmer notes of Dean's soul, but that loss was at least partially replaced by a newly discovered appreciation for Dean's Baby. When he settled into the back seat, encased in her warm steel grip, enveloped by the scent of worn leather and Sam and Dean's perspirant, Castiel felt, quite suddenly, that he had come home.
"You bloody idiot!" She shrieked at him. "You bungling bean-counter! How could I have raised a son so - "
Then the door flew open and Sam stumbled backwards through it, his attention locked on something beyond their vision, his typical fluid grace lost.
"Golf," Sam said from across the room. He was holding a club, Temperance perched behind him on the top of the open door. "Really?"
"He's conferring with Jack," Cas said, muttering the words under his breath, addressing them more to himself than to Dean.
"Very well," he said, curling his talons along Castiel's wrist. "I think you should reclaim your grace."
"Ah!" Kevin gasped. He tried to pull away, but Cas' hands clamped down around his injured finger. "Stop, it's burning!"
Human language was limited, and the English language in particular was often so convoluted as to be rendered nearly useless. Castiel didn't understand; the simplest explanation was the most impossible one of all. And Dean's hand on his face was incredibly distracting.
"Nah." That was all he said, turning away from the mirror to wink at her. Prosper felt everything inside them lighten, her senses sharpening with sudden joyful purpose; they were never more at harmony than when they had someone to look out for. Her mood must have been infectious, because Dean grinned, big and fierce. "I got a good feeling."
The air was sweet with the scent of flowers and their fruit. There was no bird song, but there was the whisper of the wind as it moved through the trees, the murmur of nearby moving water. Ahead of them was a grove, offering coolness, the promise of shade. Two trees stood at its heart.
"I'll tell you what we're gonna do, we're gonna go fishing." Dean jerked his head in the creek's direction. "C'mon, the bass are biting."
He didn't blame Dean for choosing to keep his dæmon close, although it did make his claim of friendship with Meg highly suspect. To his credit, Dean had seemed very conflicted over the matter.
"No," Prosper said. But the link was humming with interest, an open road between them, like it hadn't been in years. Dean still didn't know how to say it, how to lay it all out in a row of words that anyone could make sense of, least of all himself. But he threw it all down the line to her and kept talking.
There was the barest breath of a pause, so brief Prosper doubted that Mary noticed. But Gallant noticed, his muted yellow eyes trained on Cas.
She wouldn't wake Dean, not yet. They could just be passing by, in which case she didn't want to risk giving away their position. Or they might be hunting, but something else, something specific. Monsters had their own preferred prey, here in Purgatory, and their own store of petty vendettas against one another as well.
"We've been killing a lot more demons than that lately," Temperance said, still watching behind them.
"Wow," Metatron said, staring down at the bat clinging sideways to his shirt. "You're not what I expected."
, a traitorous little voice tried to say, but Dean squashed it, pushed the conversation forward. "But why a mole? What's killing some dim-sighted rodent got to do with anything?" A new thought occurred to him, and he recoiled slightly. "Hold up, that thing isn't actually alive, is it? Like,
Castiel considered. "Prosper and Temperance's parents named them after qualities they hoped to endow them with. A full, flourishing life; a life of self-moderation."
"We'll just stay the night, in any case." They couldn't afford to stay any longer. The angels were closing in on them, wingless, circling.
Dean waited, but Cas was quiet, turning so that his back was set against the bridge rail, his elbow bumping against Dean's as he squinted up at the trees. "Something special about the memory?" Dean prodded finally. He'd always sort of wondered about Hannah. Cas spoke about her in certain way, like her name had more weight than most.
"No, man. In fucking." Dean grimaced and ran a hand along his face. "Not that - obviously we didn't  - look, I'm just saying, that?" He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder, at the bed behind them. "I wasn't exactly expecting it." They were staring at each other now, leaning against each other. Castiel hadn't realized, hadn't noticed his sideways list until Dean's face was inches away. Dean grinned, sharp and impossibly pleased. "It was freaking awesome."
It felt very much like what Castiel remembered of dreaming, from his time as a human. The thick, heavy-limbed uncertainty of the world, the anticipation, but for what? Always for an elusive, nameless prize that remained undiscovered. Castiel stood in Kelly's room, holding the small bag of mementos she had made him vow to give to Jack, and stared down at the crumbling edge of the earth, the tide's incessant destructive work.
She stepped forward, further into the light. She looked the same, but her scent was foreign now. Prosper checked her arms, the empty space around her feet. Theodore, her handsome and clever dæmon, was nowhere to be seen. Prosper contained the urge to cry out for him. She had known he would most likely disappear when Anna regained her grace, but had gone ahead and hoped for something else entirely.
Right, because Cas, it turned out, was a grabby, demanding little fucker, with a mouth like sin, and hands that seemed to have trouble letting go once they grabbed on, and Dean was more than okay with all of it. And if they weren't currently being watched by Sammy and the son of Satan, not to mention an archangel and Dean's
But he still wasn't in any kind of good mood, pretty much the exact opposite in fact, and so when he finally made it home and stomped in through the door to find Cas sitting on the couch watching television, he didn't bother with niceties, just shut the door two decibels too loud and turned around and said,
"But he'll forgive us," Constant said, attempting to reassure them both. "Dean has a great capacity for forgiveness, and Prosper loves us."
She looked up to see that Cas had joined them. He was staring at her, the faintest hint of a smile hovering in the corner of his lip.
"I'm fine," Cas answered. He seemed to hesitate a moment, then began walking toward them, picking his way across the ditch separating him from the road. "I...there's a lot to tell you both."
"Okay, Sam," he said, filling his voice with salt and iron, making himself hard, because that was all Sam had left him, "We're done talking about this." Sam's face fell, that same surprised hurt that always took over his expression whenever Dean turned harsh and cold on him. Dean fucking hated it, he'd always hated it, and here he was doing it again. Prosper whined unhappily, concern and doubt trickling into Dean's chest. He rubbed a rough hand along his jaw, tried to soften his tone. "I'm gonna say this just once, understand? It ain't happening. You want me to be happy, you want Cas to be happy, I get it. But that?" He held Sam's gaze and pointed his finger toward the war room. "That's not in the cards. I mean, maybe if he was still human - "
Dean scowled down at her, then followed after Sam and Cas as they left the room, sliding the shelved door shut behind them. "Sam," he said, slapping a heavy hand against the shelf's metal backing. "Sammy!" He turned around to glare at Prosper. "Thanks for the help."
"Baby." It was too damn cold for anyone to be sleeping outside by choice, but when push came to shove, the cold had never been much of an issue for Dean. He opened the door and let Prosper go in first, following after and shutting it hastily behind them. He stretched out along the seat with a relieved groan; he wasn't a kid anymore and Bobby's floor was hell on his back. "C'mere," he said, moving his arms out of the way, and Prosper scrabbled over him, dropping down warm and pleasantly heavy against his torso. Dean threw one arm over her and tucked the other beneath his head. It had been a while since they had been this close. Thinking back, the last time had probably been when he was in the hospital, after Alastair. He didn't know why it was so difficult for them, why it was so hard to have her close, such painful relief to push her away. But tonight everything between them was easy. Dean ran his hand up and down her back, felt her huff peacefully against his chin. "Where were you all night?"
"So she poked around but didn't touch," Dean surmised. "How the fuck did she get in? And nothing on Sam or Cas?"
"Yes, I'll simply click my Ferragamos together three times and wish us back to Kansas, shall I?" Crowley snapped. But he came to stand by Dean's side, his blade drawn.
It was a feather-light touch, hardly there at all. Maybe that was the problem. Not enough contact for Dean to feel repulsed, just enough to make him feel...anxious, aware,
Castiel and Constant looked at each other. Castiel rotated the phone, turning its mouth to face his dæmon. Constant tilted his head in consideration, then lowered it toward the phone.
"Ah." He reached out, stroked a finger along Constant's keel; Constant ducked his head and bit his knuckle affectionately. "I suppose you're particularly fond of his character?"
"Yeah," Dean agreed huskily. "Uh. Hope you don't mind. Maybe I should've - " he shrugged awkwardly, " -  put some moves on first. Tried to throw you some warning signals or something."
"You're talking about breaking into hell," Gallant said levelly. He and Mary glanced at each other, then looked back at Sam and Temperance. "Well. Why not?"
"What is that, angel code for dead?" Dean said. Castiel didn't answer, turning slowly to face Dean and Sam again.
To eat the fruit from the Tree of Life was to live forever, but Castiel had no use for that. Where was the sweetness, the wonder, in eternal life? He chose the second tree, gnarled and thick with age, its great limbs twisting out low and wide, heavy with gleaming red fruit.
"Okay, God," Dean groaned, some indeterminable amount of time later. He pulled away, but was brought back easily enough by a sure grip on the back of his neck. "Jesus, seriously," he said, after another too-short interval of kissing. "We don't got the time for what you're trying to get started."
"Hey, Manny, my eyes are up here." Meg said, leaning into his line of sight. "You're gonna give a girl ideas, staring into her soul like that."
"Hmm," Jack said, nodding again, smiling faintly as he looked out across the yard, as if Dean had given him something very interesting to think about, and wasn't it all so nice? "So what should we do?" Like he wasn't God or something. Like he was still just Jack.
"Dude, it's a joke," Dean huffed, shifting in place and throwing Prosper a half-exasperated, half-desperate look.
"I can't. Someone has to keep them appeased." He shrugged at Dean's disgusted look. "It hasn't been an easy transition for them, Dean. Jack didn't restore heaven, he rebuilt it. He's not interested in dispensing orders or receiving worship, and he's refused to create more angels."
"Come on, baby," Chastity said, reaching down and taking Castiel's hand, lifting it up from where it had been clutched against his knee, close to Prosper. Castiel cast Dean and then Prosper one last desperate look, then stood obediently, shuffling his way around Prosper. They started to walk away, and then Chastity stopped, looking down at Prosper. "Aren't you coming along?" She asked teasingly.
"Fine," he managed to say, dropping his hands. Sam motioned toward the door with a jerk of of his chin, and Dean recovered enough to mutter a quick apology at Ash as he all but shoved Sam out the door and toward Baby. "Okay," he said, once he had Sam back in the passenger seat where he belonged. "Start talking."
Dean loved Lisa, and they both loved Ben. As for Prosper, it wasn't love, not yet. But she could love them, given enough time. And she had never had a friendship like the one she had with Neco and Lisa. It made her reexamine the handful of relationships that they had termed friendships before: hunters that they worked well with and the occasional one night stand that they ended up staying in casual contact with. Those people hadn't been friends, hadn't even come close, Prosper could see that clearly, looking back. They actually talked to Neco and Lisa, about all kinds of things, about John, and Mary too, and about hunts they had been on and things they had seen, the good and the bad. Nothing was off limits, except for Sammy. That was still...way too much to talk about.
Take now, for instance. Their last moments together, though Dean didn't seem to realize it, or more likely simply refused to acknowledge it. Prosper was in her accustomed place in the back seat, directly behind Dean. She was sitting upright and attentive, but Castiel could feel how everything within her was crying with the need to collapse. This fight, this monumental sacrifice, had hollowed her, left her weightless but not numb. Never unfeeling, not Prosper. Dean, meanwhile, was intent on violence, knowing no other way to assuage his grief, his guilt.
