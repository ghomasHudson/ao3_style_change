''Okay,'' I express just as paced as her own words, a moment before. ''And Sherlock - why is he separated?''
Because then I can see his face, tear streaked and spooked - his hair spiked up by sweat, and his pajamas coated in dust. He looks grey and blue and all-too pale in the dark of the space.
''What significance does The Priory hold for you?,'' Yuri asks now, eyebrows furrowed. ''Obviously something.''
It's because they know that the other person needs that smile, or that kind word. That little shred of human kindness.
''Sherlock,'' I try gingerly, ''John obviously likes you as a person. He seems to respect you very much. He also told me, and gave me permission to tell you this - but he mentioned that he was confused about his own feelings for you. He told me that he spoke to you about that subject and that this is why he also is considering therapy for himself right now. Because he has feelings for you, and cares about you very strongly.''
He truly believes one meal, and one still not approaching a typical meal for most - has changed his form so considerably.
How can he be as grubby as he is, in those ridiculous clothes and sleep encrusted eyes, and be - somehow - even more adorable than normal?
Sherlock didn't respond, just toyed with the fleece blanket that he'd semi-wrapped around his torso.
When I finally meander into the kitchen it's just as the coffee maker's automation begins. Before long, the entire kitchen smells like hazelnuts and dark roast.
The psychiatrist holds out a hand for the folder, and Sherlock hurriedly hands back the photographs.
They were only an illusion. A mirage. An echo of existence - a light trail of people living very different lives.
''I know that!,'' he exclaims, the sound rupturing in his throat. ''Don't you think I know that? I'm just telling you what I feel! You asked me to tell you what I feel, and that's how I feel! Like I want to stab him over and over again until he's nothing! Less than nothing! And even then, I know it wouldn't even make a difference, but that's how I feel!''
Sherlock continues to stare at me: dead-eyed, face screwed up - mouth screwed up most of all - ears violet, shoulders hunched to his chin in discomfort.
“And you look – and feel - like you need a shave, love,” I reply, coursing my hands through his curls before kissing the side of his mouth. “But you taste like those sour jujubes. Again.”
''That's why you're in therapy? This has to do with John?,'' I ask hesitantly. Because I know I am missing something.
''And you're repetitive,'' I say dully. My chest is heavy. ''You did not go to see Yuri Pascal because I'm so-called 'sick.''
''We can't assume anything about what he's doing right now. And we can't assume he'd be emotionally...okay...with suddenly losing a coping mechanism if this is a practice he's relying on. But I do think that there is a strong possibility that he's purging. You told me about that time with the food, at night. All that food, that he then replaced. And he was sick after. I don't think that was entirely an accident or a nauseated response. There is a rather good chance he worked at making that happen. Same thing with his vomiting in the toilets at the hospital. You mentioned he said that you didn't understand, and that he did not want you to understand, John.''
Some part of me is alarmed at how easily Sherlock thinks a drink of Horlicks constitutes as a possible 'dinner.'
''Odd name, I know. A family name, from the Holmes'. Very old - hundreds of years old, and it had fallen into disuse. I thought it was equally rare to my own, but more than that - I knew it was a name from the family which had once held pride. Sigur, my father, was unaware of the connection and in retrospect, I am glad that he was. Not so attached to the history of his so-called noble bloodline as he wanted to be, I realized later. After the fact. I played it off as something made up, of course. I was fantastically playful when I was small, John. I tried to be given the constraints of how we were raised, anyway.''
“It’s not supposed to be like this, John. It’s supposed to be getting better. Isn’t it? Isn’t that what therapy is designed to do: help me feel better?”
It is several minutes later before I realize: I can't stop shaking. Even though the water is warm. Hot, maybe.
The rush of something cold very much afraid courses through my head, and I feel almost faint with his revelation.
''It's - you know - therapy. It's not exactly fun. In a different context, I'd probably like him more.''
''You know what I mean,'' and he frowned now, eyes blinking unsteadily. ''Sex. Not for me,'' he breathed oddly. Too quickly.
Nothing looks appetizing. Even with the lack of human ears or pigs hearts or anything else that normally would kill an appetite. I shut the door and the kitchen goes back to resting in dark.
''That's absolutely fine,'' I get out, briskly. ''I just want to know what I do now to get him help. Because I am not going to quit. And if you want to know the truth - then yes, I am confused about what I feel. And part of me is scared. But that's nothing compared to what I feel when I think about Sherlock. And you can sit there and pretend that avoiding talking about this is preserving your ethical status, but know this - if you send me away and I don't manage to help him, what did you really accomplish?''
This isn’t a therapy session. This is John. And he’s not paid to listen to these issues. What am I doing?
Which sounds so insane now. How could I have ever been so child-like in my thinking as to assume that Sherlock - who is perhaps the most passionate person I have ever known - could avoid feeling pain?
''Nothing,'' I breathe. ''Everything,'' and I wipe at my eyes and try to sound more composed when I speak next. ''I don't know. I'm just worried about him.''
Mycroft gives a haunted smile. So strange in form and expression that it is arguably - in truth - the complete opposite of a smile.
Maybe this one moment can be more than enough to help me get back to a place that I didn’t even realize I was missing until now.
I wait until the door closes, enveloping the room again in darkness, as the sun has already begun to set. A thin strip of light glows orange and warm from the hallway, and spills under my door, and for a second - I stare at it and into it and feel unusually safe.
''How can you work down here?,'' I shiver, ''it's freezing. You must feel miserable working down here.''
"They were the doors from our childhood nursery," he explains, calmly, his line of sight matching up with my own.
''Stop it right now, Sherlock!,'' John yells, his voice draining away as he continues. ''Stop it. You're scaring everyone.''
''I will ensure that Toby is able to get some sleep now. That he will be safe from here on out. And that you will get the help you need, as I promised your son. Because he loves you, Hope. He loves you, even if I don't understand why-''
It seems like he's taking my request seriously. And for a few seconds, that almost seems somewhat unnatural.
I'm accosted with an image of a jail cell being slammed shut, and I press at my eyes to get the image to depart.
"You are not disrupting me," my friend says softly from around the corner. "You don't have to sit out in the hall."
''You are extremely talented in navigating away from and out of conversations that you'd rather not have. That must be taxing to John, especially considering how concerned he is about you.''
This time, I pick up speed to overtake his steps, and since he has nowhere to go – nowhere to flee – I reach out and grab his gloved hand.
Because while I may not be asexual - as Sherlock is convinced he is - I understand romantic love as being distinct from sexual attraction. And I understand rejection, and I know that the heart will always come first for me.
So I turned back, and grabbed hold of Bisquick's collar, shortening the leash by circling the excess leather around my hand until the dog was barely inches from my side.
Pale hands race to his hair, tug at his strands. His flesh blanches around the area of impact, and I resist an impulse to hold him down.
''You're way too hard on yourself, Watson. Has anyone ever told you that? Come on. Let's meet up. Get a drink. We can talk more, if you'd like?''
And it is not in my nature to prolong considerable suffering that is covered by a gloss of surface discomfort. I'd rather push past immediate hesitancy if it would help someone get back on track.
On the other end of the line I hear a door open and secretary-Marnie mutter something. Yuri seems to muffle the receiver, but I make out: 'no, I will call her back after my lunch, Marnie. Unless it's an emergency, she'll have to wait.'
"I recall the near-hysteria on the morning I told Sherlock that we would be taking a cab into the city to see a doctor. When I told him the nature of what he would be expected to talk about...he started to cry. And when I tried to calm him, he ran from the room, and out of the flat. I searched for two hours, and by necessity had to cancel the appointment."
Sherlock's breath suddenly hitches, and I sense he is trying very hard to remain as immobile as possible.
I want to show the depth of my friendship, to offer him my support in a way that he can sense goes deeper than mere words or superficial expressions, and yet-
Sherlock slowly opens the folder, pulls out several photos. Stares at the first few, his eyes shifting in perplexed anxiety before he passes me a couple pages.
Sherlock looks confused now and I give him what I hope is a warm smile. Wait for him to speak yet again.
I find myself stricken with a bout of paranoia, as if Yuri is somehow aware that I've let myself peruse the contents of his bookshelves, or that he knows – again, paranoia - the reality of what I have seen among his personal photos. Then I tell myself that's an asinine thought, since he's far more likely to be concerned about Sherlock, and the tenseness stems from that alone.
''You've done so much. It's amazing, John.'' or ''No one would ever guess you had such difficulties learning things as a kid. You've come such a long way!''
However, just because I was not assaulted in the manner that he was...does not mean that I was not in pain alongside him.
"Perhaps it's because I'm poor with emotions in general. Evidence yes, I can sort out the linear steps of a murder. But I rely on evidence to indicate sentiment. Emotions confuse me," he states cleanly, because this is now familiar territory. His inability to 'get' emotions is nothing new. Or so says Sherlock. I have my own reservations about how little he truly 'gets.'
The place is both very, very different to how I last remember it, yet at the same time - oddly enough - superficially identical to how it was before.
''My father. Not him, but you know - my real father,'' Sherlock squints at the flooring again, the low light of day finally seeping into our kitchenette. ''Mycroft found him, and I wrote to him. He lives in France. Not even that far from where I went to boarding school when I was little. I would have been able to have walked to his house when I was 9. He has two other children, now. Two girls - Camielle and Delphine. They are teenagers. I have little sisters.''
"We don't have to talk about that night, if you don't want to," I say evenly, hopefully my tone reassuring enough that he doesn't shut down on us entirely.
“I’d actually pay to see you conduct a session doped up on Nyquil. For shame, these doctor-patient confidentiality arran-”
I'm starting to become used to his anger, and no longer find it quite as impressive. Not now that I've sensed his deeper, fuller fear.
So far I've added a request for two waters, a Vietnamese coffee for myself, and a Jackfruit smoothie that I wheedled Sherlock into accepting. It's a start, but it's still not a meal.
““Reactive Attachment-,” and I stop with a frown. “Reactive Attachment Disorder is defined as the condition in which individuals have difficulty forming lasting relationships”,” I begin, a lump forming in my throat. I can see passages that John has crossed out. Others that he has underlined in red. He’s been over this a lot, and I hate that too.
Still: I'm missing something so I press lightly against his arm. Tap his side. Let my hand touch his wrist bone. Briefly.
So that's my hope, now. One of them. A larger, fuller hope is that Toby can do this on his own. Confide in someone with words. And have that someone not be Sherlock. I know in some ways that it's a selfish thought. Borne of my own need to protect my friend, and my feelings of inadequacy if I don't.
Today is my 'off' day, so that means - usually - I lounge around, do washing up and laundry and boring adult tasks. Talk to the cats, water the plants, renew my library books online and consult my 'bucket' list of social activities (which rarely goes anywhere. The social activities, I mean).
My hands are sweating, and I rub them against my jeans. Again, ''Sherlock'' - a first name address. A way of showing familiarity and warmth? Some doctors try to reach out to family members by softening blows and hard things to hear with kinder references. I wonder if that's what is happening now.
His good eye drops down to his lap. He seems hesitant to either nod or shake his head in the negative.
John doesn't move or toss and I inch towards the bathroom. Once inside, I look the door, and place a towel under the door by the slit where noise and light would otherwise reach the hallway. Then I pull several reams of toilet paper off from the roll and deposit them into the toilet basin, before I proceed to urinate. The fire in my bladder slowly fades away, and I realize I've been drinking a pretty large amount of fluids lately. More than would be typical. Primarily coffee, which is probably doing my stomach no favours whatsoever. It helps to keep the hunger down to a minimum, and it can provide me with a sense of energy that I am needing so desperately these days. But it also causes my bladder to burn.
''Shut up,'' I whisper. ''It's...tricky. It's not perfect. And I can't speak for all the others out there. I can't speak for other men or women. I can only speak for myself. But as for myself... I know I would never leave someone because of physical issues, like sex. Or lack of sex. Or - you know. It's, for me-,'' and my face flushes red.
Mycroft, myself. Brandy decanters. An art deco glass door. Or was it art nouveau? And Mycroft telling me about the nursery, how it had been from Sherlock's nursery. Telling me about Sherlock as a child. How he had liked to paint with watercolours. How Mycroft thought that maybe he would become an artist, one day. Mycroft's soft voice, describing finding his brother, finding him with knife wounds through his thighs, a bottle of discarded anti-anxiety medicine by his bedside.
''Sherlock? Hey, c'mon. Try to calm down a bit, alright?,'' and I remove one of his gloves. The black leather which grips his flesh like a second skin. Let my thumb stroke his palm rhythmically.
Sherlock's chin lolled against his chest and he remained quiet as I worked the shampoo through his hair.
''So what you are saying,'' and he affixes his blue scarf to his neck, ''is that at my lowest ebb, I still managed to save a child's life. When - if it was up to the professionals at New Scotland Yard, he would have died. Most assuredly. So despite whatever I have had to deal with in my life that may be bleeding over into the present, my services are no longer needed. Because my 'friends' need to assuage their own concern. And what better way to get me to do what they want me to do... than to cut me off from working. Is that it?''
But it's at the flat that I feel the difference. It's not even a frostiness. It's an impending sense of something's going to break.
My fist slams down against the mahogany desk in a wave, in a roaring crack of explosive contempt. An old mug and remnant coffee shake about a bit, but otherwise all is still.
Because then I realize there is nothing under the surface but a droning sort of emptiness. A slate grey hum of noise where something colourful, even if painful, should be.
"Self-harm, Sherlock. If only related to your drug use, for starters. Using hard drugs? You knew exactly where that could lead, but you took part in it anyway. Not only that - but the misappropriation of substances in general, even legal substances, to modify your bodily limitations. You don't have allergies, but I've seen the pseudoephedrine purchases in the medicine cabinet. I've seen the dimenhydrinate you take so you can get to sleep most nights. I know the chemical cocktails you make for yourself when you are having an 'off' day. Your tendency to ignore physical signs representative of hunger, fatigue, cold, pain. Problems we've discussed before! Long before I even knew about this...issue. In short - you completely ignore what your body needs. And that's just your body. You are so much more than a body, Sherlock! And you are certainly not a machine, even though I know you wish it were that simple! So tell me - is that not reason enough to be concerned?"
Certainly he went from melancholic at times, manic at other times, and irritable often - from the time I first knew him - to confused, withdrawn, less manic, less passionate about cases. And losing weight at a fairly stable rate. But this all started within the last four or five months. He may not have ever been typical with his eating, or even tempered, but he certainly was much better off than he's been recently.
What's more: I highly doubt he's ever had someone whose cared about him with the same force and passion as I care about him, and I'm pretty sure that he knows that, too. Mycroft not withstanding.
''John!,'' she says rapidly, her eyes wide and heavy. I catch sight of red smudges along the forearm of her cream sweater.
''Don't be so hard on yourself. You're doing great,'' and he leans forward, attentively, ''Aesthetic appreciation can be distinct from sexual attraction, John. What else have you experienced?''
''Sherlock? You couldn't have wanted Mycroft to have gone through it too,'' John starts slowly, oddly. Getting half of it, but certainly not getting the gist of it. ''I know you wouldn't have.''
''Listen to me, Sherlock. I am not leaving. Ok? Do you...can you believe that? Can you please try to trust me on that?''
I realize then that even though, over the last four months, John and I have discussed a great many things I have never said that word aloud. I have never admitted to feeling – to considering myself to be – ugly, even though it’s been one of the words most frequently found taking precedence in my mind. Ugly. My mind is a rotisserie cooker and on display during my downtime (when my thoughts are not filled with casework and trivia) – when I have a moments reprieve to focus on my life the merry-go-round of my thoughts is nothing more than an obsessively hateful six-course meal of pejoratives.
It doesn't make sense. A sulk for a few hours. Until such time as we were able to discuss matters? Yes, I'd understand it. But things are getting weirder as time goes on. Not better.
But he wasn't healthy in his mind before; not entirely. So it shouldn't make me squirm with anxiety if he's wearing different clothes now. Or that he hasn't shaved. I simply knew a version of Sherlock that seemed healthier in the past, even if he still struggled with eating. Still struggled with dark thoughts and superficial success.
What's more - I can hear the tone. The false levity. I try to ascertain whether or not I could have said or done anything in my sleep to have disturbed him, and I pull my sash more tightly across my body.
''Oh, what does it matter? My stomach was bleeding! I was in pain! If I was agitated, I'm sure I had the complete right to be!''
Victor never said them either. Mummy - definitely not. I honestly don't think she told me when I was an infant. Too small to remember.
''Yuri thinks I have an attachment disorder!,'' he rasps, then glances at me, cursorily. His eyes are like X-rays. ''But you already knew that, didn't you, John? That's why you tried to cover up your discovery with mail order science circulations! As if that would throw me off track!''
''Oh come off it! Of course you do! You trail me around! Study my bloody book purchases, Mycroft! You want to know what trailing somewhat about like that might do to their sense of reality? Of course you spy on him!''
''Ahh,'' I say with a slight grin, ''but certainly a little bit of sugar now and then isn't the worst thing if I eat healthfully on the whole. Wouldn't you say?''
I can recall my amusement when Sherlock had asked the date after I inquired if he was going to actually join me in eating anything. To his question, I had informed him it was Wednesday of that particular week.
''Sadistic?,'' I repeat dumbly, helplessly. Because Sherlock's memories and fears and anxieties are clashing with the present now, and I can't help but think he's seeing sadism in a typical brusqueness that's all too common with doctors, unfortunately.
''I read your profile,'' I exchange coolly, ignoring the question, ''and supposedly you specialize in eating disorders in both males and adults. It's why the hospital assigned you to talk to Sherlock in the first place, isn't it? So don't make it out to be the case that you can't help him! I know you can fix him, if anyone can!''
A small, mocking voice pipes up in my mind: ‘Here, Sherlock. Look back on this wretched day, when this wretched thing happened to your poor little wretched child body, and don’t look away…’
''I think that one'll want to go home with you,'' I say softly. ''And I think Molly suspects it, too.''
His voice sounds awkward. The parsing is strange - as if he's unsure what he's saying. Speaking in a foreign language, and testing out a sentence to see if it makes sense to a native speaker.
''Sherlock, you can always help yourself to whatever is in the kitchen. I'd want you to,'' and he bites off a bit more toast, swallows, speaks again. ''In fact, I'd be insanely happy if you'd let yourself have a bit more.''
''My stomach is bleeding,'' I say solidly. Certain it must be the correct answer. Must be what she means. What she wants.
''Listen to me, Sherlock: you have nothing to feel ashamed about. You haven't done anything wrong. If you broke your leg...would you be doing something wrong in admitting that it was broken? Or to even expressing that it hurt you?''
''I am a doctor!,'' I explode, ''My name is Dr. John Hamish Watson. I have my identification on me here, somewhere,'' and I go to pad my pockets looking for identification.
“I don’t know,” I repeat, more softly than before. “I am confused. I just know I am cold now. I don’t know how to compare it to what I felt before.”
“Manners!,” I chuckle, locating the candy in my pajama top and brushing it off where it falls onto the coffee table. “Oh, right, of course – your favourite doctor is David Tennant.”
''According to Yuri you don't get anything,'' he replies, his voice cutting through the fog of my confusion.
''Your view of non-defective is not necessarily my view,'' I start with a cautionary tone to my voice. ''I would like something more specific. What are you looking for, precisely? What do you want in a nutritionist?''
''I remember everything like it was…like it…,'' he pauses, opens his eyes, and looks back to the television. ''Like it was on there,'' and he points over to the now-blank screen. ''Like it was happening, but not really happening. Happening on a television, perhaps? In my mind? It was black and white and fuzzy and strange like an old out-of-focus movie, and I was watching it as an outsider – not a participant. It was merely happening to someone else, and I was just forc-''
The pain comes at 65. Fast, hot pain. The Martian has skewered my body with his weapon. The Martian is killing me. I let out a holler.
''Victor didn't 'do' anything to me,'' I murmur, voice-low. Mostly spoken in my head, with very little exiting my mouth. ''I did it all to myself.''
John, luckily, just laughs, most likely too tired to make the necessary connections to be concerned about my comments.
Sherlock is nothing but outspoken, but if I am doing something that is unnerving him - he's never shared this with me.
I want to ask - and I feel that it is necessary to know - when Sherlock first stopped eating. When he first started skipping snacks, then meals, then the whole of it for favour of hunger and not ''fullness.''
"It was an extremely difficult time, yes. Made worse by the fact that I had not even pushed for punitive action against my own father, for what he had done to Sherlock. I had taken my brother away from the home where he had been hurt, yes - but neither of us had reported the years of abuse to the authorities. Sherlock forbade it when I tried to get him to even consider the possibility. Of course, being the logical perpetrator of such abuse in the eyes of the hospital staff, Sherlock finally broke his silence and decided to speak out. He was terrified, I am sure, and yet he did it to protect me."
I feel his hands slide up to hold my own. I feel the pressure of his fingers, tracing patterns on my own. It’s his thing. Driven by some belief, I have speculated, that in physically touching me in even a very basic way – I’ll not drift away into my mind.
I get up, briskly walk to the kitchenette. Find Sherlock's mobile, return to the living room, toss it to him.
''You can sleep now,'' I say softly, closing my eyes. ''And it's okay. Everything is fine. All fine.''
''I will take a kip when we get back to Baker St. I will be okay, John. I won't let myself get sick again,'' and his words are insistent and strong and said with such intensity that I feel temporarily relieved. But only slightly; he's still not meeting my eyes. At that moment the door to the washroom opens and Lestrade ducks his head in.
Because I am terribly hungry. What I said to John wasn't a lie. I am hungry, but I am repulsed by my hunger. And I know I can't go back to the clinic. To their high fat, high calorie meals. Or worse, potentially - to their feeding tubes and threats of sectioning. To Mycroft's aimless visits, and Mother's too. Her eyes cold and aggrieved with my continual existence. Her eyes almost willing me to end this charade, so she won't feel the need to keep up appearances.
''Something like out-patient, perhaps,'' I say cautiously. ''Nothing you can't do at home. Nothing that Yuri or I couldn't monitor, barring complications.''
''That's not fair,'' he says in upset. ''You don't know anything about this! I could be trying my damnedest and it wouldn't look like anything to you, would it?''
The realization that John thinks that way about himself, about his take on life and the teeming masses surrounding us... makes me feel atypically sad.
While the first half of this story dealt with decline, this chapter starts in on actual ways John and Sherlock are going to move forward, and going to try to get Sherlock healthier - in mind, body, and spirit. Because of that, it's going to get more focused on discussions between the two of them (and also with Yuri, and Mycroft to lesser degrees) and revelations.
''You've thought of it, and-,'' his voice is plaintive and confounded. As if he can't grasp the reasons I have for being shocked at his recent behaviour. That regardless of everything that has come to light recently, my own physical history with other romantic partners aside - I'd merely let him continue? Let him contort his body to suit whatever bestial part of me would take a fleeting moment of interest in his suggestion that we have sex?
I pick it up, inhale the scent of coffee, and let my lips taste the beverage. It tastes too sweet for two lumps of sugar.
I'm wearing my cherry cardigan and an anatomy t-shirt. It's of a Da Vinci sketching, and gifted to me from my old time Uni-slash-flatmate, Meena.
But in retrospect, it's so difficult to catch the signs of disorder when you don't know at the outset that anyone has a history of self-abuse.
I hesitate by the bed and then walk around the other side, crouching low by the frame. Sherlock's contorted himself into an almost fetal position. His eyes are crushed in upon themselves, as if willing to block out the light, the noise, the reality of the hospital.
''You're okay, you're fine,'' I rushed, then let my hands dance over his prominent spine. Traced the bone. ''Just a little intense, huh?''
I meander on over to 'my' chair, toss the bloody Union Jack pillow to the floor. Fall into the padded seat with a huff.
''I thought you might want to eat up here. I didn't know, really. You seemed so tired, and I barely had the heart to wake you as it was.''
''I should probably be telling you all this when you are awake, but I sometimes think you'd laugh at half the things my mind comes up with... You'd think I was overly sentimental, probably. What did you call it before? Maudlin?''
''Okay then. That's all I needed to hear. Or rather, that and your response now: want to come inside? Get some coffee? Heat up?''
There is no noise for a second. My flat mate is undeniably digesting my words, my not-really concealed anger.
''Will your trying be enough? I need to know if you can eat the bare minimum to keep yourself from getting sicker. If you can go through with eating say... 1000 calories a day?''
I finally reach the end of the stretch of sidewalk, and glance across the road. The houses here are brick and vine-trellised and I find that something inside me wants to curl up under one of the eaves while I try to push all the stuffing back inside my body. The stuffing that has come out of my mouth, run down my shirt, spilled from my eyes so embarrassingly.
And maybe that's my fear too. A little bit of it. He doesn't have a self preserving nature. He seems to care relatively little about his own body, and he's not coping well with the new memories that have been coming back to him lately.
Donovan sat stunned, watching the scene with an odd look of disbelief on her face, before removing her autumnal garment and passing it over to Sherlock.
''We discussed how you really aren't discussing anything with Yuri. Not really. How you come to sessions, leave ten minutes later. How perhaps I am enabling you? Does any of this ring a bell?''
''Okay,'' Sherlock says softly, a voice like silt lightly settling. The lack of weight in his tone - the lack of joyous vindication - tells me more than I needed to hear.
"I'm sorry I got so angry. I'll wash the floor in the morning, John. I'll make sure I get all the glass."
I wanted him to know that he could lose me, just as I could lose him. Not because I would ever leave him. But because his actions could take him from me. Actions he hasn't even admitted to being harmful, never mind potentially fatal.
“Look, Sherlock. This is going to be, as far as I understand it, much more efficient and far less unsettling than therapy. We’re going in, we discuss your current diet, your current health issues, we get a more detailed plan with additional target foods, and we’re out of there. Then we can do whatever we please with the rest of our day.”
The yearning I often had before the drugs. To go back in time. To erase it all. To have a different father. One that loved me. One that loved me properly. And to know I'd be different today.
I want to believe that deviations from the norm we had in the past are fine. Because while I have this mental image of Sherlock being 'fine' when I met him, I need to accept that he has never been wholly fine. He's been haunted, and he's struggled on his own for almost his entire life, and on his own he's done admirably.
It has lingered with him for years. For his whole adult life, likely. His response to the attacks of the children on our most recent case suggest child abuse of his own experience, but it had still been merely a suspicion up until a few hours ago. Mycroft's past comments, however, have indicated a perpetual or long lasting state of celibacy, and for a long time. Something I've always found odd. Not so much for the celibacy, if you want to know the truth. Sherlock is different in so many ways, I could have accepted that in and of itself. What got to me more so was Mycroft's lilted, almost testing tone. His seeming challenge for Sherlock to say something. Anything. To call his bluff. To respond. That is what struck me as odd.
''Well, these sessions are not so much for me, but for him,'' John starts by way of clarification. ''I'm here to provide, I guess, support. Sherlock doesn't have the best history with psychotherapists,'' he adds rapidly.
''You're being selfish,'' I had gritted out to him in disarming vexation after Lestrade had left the room, equally incredulous.
Decide against emotionally connecting a moment of such stress-relief with the added intake of alcohol.
Something twists in my guts when he grabs my hand. Because Sherlock Holmes never just grabs anyone's hand, and never in fear.
Sherlock bit his lip, shifted his focus to my coffee table. I saw him mouth something, quietly. Soundlessly. For a second, I was convinced he was reciting a string of digits.
“Then this is for you. We can cover some of this now to get started. But some of this you might want to complete at home when you have more time to consider the questions.”
I get an image of me with a knife stabbing it into the Martian over and over and over and over. Ripping his guts out.
Plus, he ran track. And rowed, but was considering giving it up because he found it ''repetitiously boring,'' apparently.
I feel a pinprick of coldness from my adrenals at Lestrade's words, then realize I'm nearing Baker Street, and utter a soft ''here's good'' to the cabbie.
Sherlock is currently the colour of milk, and I hate that this - not criminals intent on poisoning him, not bullying co-workers at the Yard, not the cruel speech of those who don't 'get' him, but a kind psychiatrist asking wholly carefully crafted sentences - could bring out such fear and anticipation of bad things, of dark things.
''Well, you're the primary contact now, and his appointed proxy. At any rate Dr. Watson, he's still in surgery.''
''It's hard,'' he whispers. ''But he's - good. And yes, it's a male doctor. It was deemed 'for the best'. John agrees, too. That it might help more, you know - with a male doctor.''
The sun was setting - casting unearthly shadowed faces over the statues and the busts that had been worked into the building centuries ago. As the quality of light changed from that of late afternoon to early evening, they appeared to be shifting in emotionality - also caught up in the music.
''You don't know?,'' my friend queries, sounding lost. ''You don't know if you have an eating disorder? Do you think it's typical to feel this way? Giving yourself what you need to be healthy? Do you think most people feel like this when they eat their lunch?"
I reach out and hold his hand briefly, watch his mouth open, close. His eyes flash up, meet mine, then quickly look back down at the cat again.
I used to dream that maybe when I was little - very, very little - that mummy would have come and picked me up out of the crib and stroked my hair, and would say, ''I love you, Sherlock'' or even just ''love you.'' ''I love you, Sherlock,'' would have been better, but any sort of affection would have made me so pleased. So I used to imagine that this is how she would have spoken to me when I was really small. Too young to have been a problem yet. Too small to be hated.
John adds various offerings to his coffee, and I pick up the nutmeg, give it a sniff. Add a light tap against my opened cup, before affixing the plastic top.
''It's none of his business,'' I seethe. ''It's none of your business! It's my life! Those things happened to me! Not to Mycroft. Never to Mycroft, and never to YOU!''
''Yes. That might be better, anyway. He's...he's sort of psyching himself out a little bit, Yuri. I think. But if it's short - a quick visit, at least initially - he might slowly come out of his shell.''
I wonder if that's partly what makes it so much more a crime. The fact that the sickness it invokes - even in those not directly victimized - makes people want to deny, to forget, to run away from the very idea of the subject.
In all honesty, while I can now admit to myself that what I feel for Sherlock is something different to platonic in feeling, I don't truly believe I have ever felt sexually attracted to him. What I feel for him is an intense emotional connection, with romantic highlights that come out at - unfortunately it seems - the worst possible times.
''No, he can't be,'' I concede, knowing that the man I am speaking to is more than reasonable. I already know where Lestrade is going with this, after all. I know I'll agree with his assessment. ''Did anyone complain about him?''
Then he takes a second bite, and when he's finished chewing he puts his sandwich back down on his plate.
''I don't really think I am,'' he whispers again, and something about the insistent repetition is unnerving me.
But something has happened, yet again. And it's something I didn't really feel in totality until after I saw the blood.
Sherlock's eyes flicker a type of atypical anxiety, but even I can tell that he doesn't really care about the state of my inebriation.
I could put up with guns going off, though that in itself was a type of insanity. Because who shoots off a weapon in - boredom?
My brain hisses 'nothing' and I sit back against her sofa, a strong pulse in my mouth now. Pounding away.
''I'm sorry,'' she says, sotto voice, and that makes me feel cold. It makes me feel like the worst friend in the world to Sherlock because in that instance, for a flicker of a moment, I almost feel sorry for her. For a woman who probably has called my best friend cruel names hundreds of times in the few years I have known her. About a man with destructively low self-esteem as it is. And whether or not she knew or could see that his put-upon arrogance was just that, I don't care. Certainly not now.
''And what's more, I have a very good friend who more than avails himself to me, whenever I need him. So I'm not looking for a friend. I'm not looking for concern. I am looking for ideas on-,'' and then I stop, unaware of what I even want to express.
When I feel slightly more composed, I wind on over to the vending machine and deposit some coinage, selecting a hot chocolate from the few options available.
Sherlock is not drinking his tea. Merely has his long legs pulled up to his chest, and arms entwined around his legs.
She deftly takes the recording equipment and turns it on, laying it down gently on the side table. Toby watches the proceedings soundlessly, and goes back to reading his novel.
His arms have resumed their tight wrap around his body, so I tentatively position myself closer to him.
''You were busy talking to Mrs. Hudson,'' he says, and the sound is petulant. Like I had done something wrong in giving him space. ''Busy eating scones and drinking tea.''
''Sometimes I used to pretend I was a pirate, and I'd board a ship and sail away, and when he'd hurt me sometimes - and it was always at night, when it was dark - I used to tell myself that I was being hurt at sea. M-maybe,'' and his voice is shaking now, ''sharks, or something like...an octopus. Because I'd fallen into the water, where it is cold and dark and where things like that can hurt you. So it made sense then, see? A shark would bite you, and an octopus would tangle around your legs and maybe even take your clothes off. But your dad's not supposed to do those things to you.''
The dishes have also been sitting for at least an hour because I have neglected to wash them. Instead, I've slumped down in chair in the far off corner of the kitchenette, considering ways to make this better.
He continues his brisk stride, never once looking back, and after a few seconds of composing what I want to say, I give up – and pick up my own pace until I match his tempo.
Sometimes, confusingly, I realize that I also want to be hugged, and for someone I trust to hold me or keep me calm or get that anger to go away without everything becoming a blinding fire-ball of aggression.
John's index finger flitters over to my left hand. I feel a slight wispy touch - back and forth; a physical attempt at assurance. It makes my stomach tighten. On one level, I like it. I think. Deep down, I think I love that he cares. On another level, I hate it. The touch, and maybe even the caring. The concern. It's not even sexual touch, and it still makes me feel funny. Still makes me feel wrong. And the fact that it still makes me feel like that - makes me feel like crying. At least it makes part of me feel like crying. And I hate that too - the splintering of emotions.
It's as honest as I'm going to get. I hope the admittance is enough to help turn the tide of inquisition.
Because I am not ready to give up this hunger for expected, mechanized fullness. I will never accept a reality whereby I eat when I am hungry and live in heavy weight - in that cloying stomach-warmth. With food passing through my body every day. Ingestion, evacuation.
I have read his essays on various chemicals, various experiments. I can see what he's passionate about, and I can sense how atypical he is as a person. How quickly his mind works and processes both the external world but also the internal world, too. The blunt, almost socially awkward way he writes about wanting to take on ''only interesting cases,'' and the brusque manner that seems to be infused with his genuine perplexity as to social norms and expectations.
"I've had over a liter of coffee beverages in the last two hours, Mycroft. I don't need any more fluids tonight. But - thank you. I appreciate the offer."
His baritone voice reverberates in my head. The pressure against my hand has increased. It's not painful, but it's firm.
''Hey, come on. It's okay,'' I breathe against his skull, my breath ghosting past his ear. ''Eat what you can, and if you can't, that's okay. We can discuss it more later.''
I hear a ragged breath on the other end of the line. The choking of someone just barely holding their breathing together.
Merely snippets of a different life. A better life, obviously - because in my dream happenings Sherlock was far healthier physically.
"You didn't. Wake me up, I mean. I couldn't sleep, I guess. Neither could you from the look of things."
I must not look at myself in mirrors anymore. As fascinating as the experiment is, it keeps the unreality strong.
''I...I'm not going to pressure you to feel or do anything, Sherlock. You don't have to love me, and you certainly don't have to be with me in any way. Although your continued friendship would make me very happy,'' I say with a tentative smile.
"There were noises from him too, like crying. Not crying, of course. But I didn't know about sex then," he admits, as if this alone fills him with a sense of mortification. The redness now almost looks painted on his skin, as the rest of his face is white. Paler than usual.
No one normal or sane wants to hurt. But I want to hurt...and...I don't want to hurt. I straddle both states of want and need simultaneously, and cannot find the words to express the complexity of living in my mind or of living with those thoughts. Additionally, I don't know how to tie that part down long enough so I can study it.
''Experiments make me feel calm, and nothing else does these days. Sometimes,'' and Sherlock licks his lips now, nervous, ''sometimes I think it's the only thing I have to hold onto, John. Numbers and certainty and things that should be. Input. Output. It all can be determined. Scientifically. I can...make it happen. I can control the data by controlling the input. With whatever substance I want; I can test it out, and see it change and it's an impact. An effect that I made. Does that make sense?''
''Okay. You hold onto Hedwig, and I'll call Greg and everything will be okay. Everything is going to be okay.''
He also seems rather insistent that he's at a perfectly acceptable weight for his height, even now. Even once we've established that he's not. Even though we have already talked about this issue quite a bit already.
''Please let me go,'' he pleads. ''I want to sit down,'' he says, voice suddenly trembling like he's fallen into very cold water. ''Don't hold me!''
It’s not something I have ever seen him do before and so I watch the display with a sort of foreboding hesitation.
Sherlock's quiet for a few minutes, and I don't needle him. Don't press him for a response. I let him process my words, their meaning, the options that have opened up to him. The reality that I've addressed, and how no one hates him for what he's feeling, or for what he did when he could no longer see a non-destructive way to vocalize his needs.
It comforts me, though. It's warm, and dark, and smells like chips, malt vinegar, sarsaparilla, and barbecue sauce.
''Before we head home, do you want to catch a bite?,'' I throw out easily, as if the suggestion is nothing.
So I cannot conceive of why just looking in his direction lately is making my heart race with anxiety.
Next I change into silk pajamas. A gift two winters ago from Mycroft. They are grey-blue, with little flying geese all over. A gift skirting on being just odd enough, just different enough for me to truly like it, but also lacking in any real masculine style. I don't know if that has any bearing on the fact that I rarely wear these garments or not.
''Tonight wasn't- we aren't-,'' he stopped, sputtered, looks frustrated with his inability to get the words out. ''Tonight wasn't normal. Not for friends. Not for ''just'' friends.''
To many people, even in the midst of relative suffering - they will perpetuate suffering because it is something that is known. As strange as it sounds to people who have never lived in such a world, that abuse then becomes emotionally safe. A variable they are familiar with when everything else around them is crumbling.
“And none of this decaf nonsense,” I add, feeling somewhat lighter in this moment than I have ages. Interests? Disinterests? Favourite modes of exercises? Pastimes?
“That wasn’t part of the assignment,” I reply tersely. “The last bit. Definitely not. I am simply supposed to-”
''We discuss things well. John is always available to me, regarding any discussion of which either of us would wish to partake.''
Finally - this is a long chapter. Longer than any of the others. I hope the invested time makes up for the delay in posting.
''You need to look for needle marks. You need to do a more exhaustive blood panel. Don't look for obvious poisons. Look for something less sinister. Something average. Something which, in certain contexts - might even be beneficial.''
Only later, after I heard Mycroft's breaths - even and steady and indicating sleep - I wound wind my way to the bathroom. I wouldn't turn on any lights. I moved on autopilot. And if the drink was still hot and full in my belly, I'd close the door to the bathroom, and I'd flip open the lid on the toilet, and sometimes I would stick two fingers down my throat.
It's the fact that since he's been a child...he's been engaging in these behaviours. Various and sundry forms of self-harm.
''Do you think maybe-?,'' he begins, then shakes his head as if the idea burgeoning forth is ludicrous. He obviously considers a direct question too nosy. Too intrusive.
''But I need a diversion. Do you have any spare parts?,'' I ask quickly, willing the world to stop spinning. ''Anything will do, but ears would be best.''
Even if I retreated now - got up and stammered and tried to run to the kitchenette to get my own mind and body under control, he'd always know that I had felt them. The scars. His body.
"You look pretty weighed down there. Care to share what's going through your mind?," he asks with a feigned casualness, taking a sip of his beverage.
And I am sad, of course. This whole morning has been nothing if not the worst sort of sadness. For me to witness what's happened.
I grab the broom from the hall closet and return quickly. Sherlock seems fixed in his position. His arms are wrapped around his midsection.
''You're not screwing up at all! You were seriously dehydrated, and now you are probably in a slightly safer place! 2 lbs is the minimum I'd expect in terms of weight gain when you probably were so dehydrated upon admittance!''
My fear now is that such an admission is going to completely destroy him, when he's basically just given me his heart.
“I’m sorry you’re hurting,” I whisper to myself – knowing that between the spray of the water and the music John has since put on in the kitchen – that he cannot hear these words. “I’m sorry that you feel like you need to hurt.”
''You look ready to drop,'' she agrees, and she leads me to her work station, where I sit down on a padded black swivel chair. The impulse to close my eyes and rest my forehead against the desk is almost alarmingly intense.
Lestrade continues to nod at the table, while I take a seat - my heart pounding violently. Angry that they'd overlook the moral obviousness of the situation - that DNA matters far, far less than addressing a little child's pain.
And he stops talking then. Breaks off. His body is clad with layers upon layers of clothing. But if we stripped those layers away, I'm sure we'd see a rapid inhalation and exhalation of his lungs. The fear of his mind made evident in his breath, the tensing of his flesh.
''But don't you need the physical act, too?,'' Sherlock mutters, his knee jumping in staccato beats against the lino. ''Don't most people? Normal people? Victor said-''
I pick up the ketchup bottle and draw a red smiley face on a serviette. Realize it looks rather furious for a smiley face. Poke at the ketchup with my finger, until the face is blotted out into a red mass.
This time, when I go to vomit, it is much easier, and I am able to get a large volume of tomato sauce and cheese up and out of my stomach.
My lips open, feel tacky, and I want to speak and I want to feel better and I want to be okay and I want to make everything right.
My throat is suddenly dry, and I take a sip of the Perrier. It fizzes in my mouth. Tastes vaguely like lemon, which makes me feel a little less woozy.
''Mmm, of course they are,'' I say without sarcasm, then study the colours and look at the banisters. Take in the scents and the imagery of Molly Hooper's apartment building. ''Your hallway is very clean. It smells like Pine Sol.''
''You are anemic, Sherlock,'' Dr. Rouse begins tersely, ''Severely anemic. Not simply in terms of being iron anemic. You also have pernicious anemia, in addition. You were also severely hypoglycemic upon your admittance. Your weight is at a level that qualified as moderately emaciated based on your height.''
"Four days later, I had had enough. Even in that short time, I could see that he was rigidly avoiding all forms of nutrition, and though four days without food is a far cry from starvation, I was concerned where his behaviour was leading. I knew he needed help, and so against his pleading, I took him to see the psychiatrist I had first contacted two years previously. I explained the basics of what had occurred to the doctor - and had stressed that he was finding it difficult to cope with the nature of the event and found it highly shameful. Still, I was encouraged to bring him in later that afternoon. Which I did. Surprisingly, since Sherlock refused to let me leave his sight, I had to sit through the entire session - which revolved around discussing the emotional and physical dynamics of adolescence. Or rather, it amounted to a lecture on male adolescent biology, since my brother refused to acknowledge any question that was posed to him."
But we were making comparatively little headway on particulars, and each new reveal usually had us cutting the session short since the very act of admitting much of anything seemed to exhaust him to a considerable degree.
But the man continued on silently for the next few minutes, as if my query had gone unheard. Suddenly, as we neared what could only have been his dormitory building, he looked off towards a grove of trees in the next courtyard and proclaimed, ''Sherlock. My name is Sherlock Holmes. And I, um, I read Chemistry.''
''I know you feel wretched. I know it. But is anything else the matter, other than what you've expressed just now?''
''I love him,'' he mutters, the pink of his face merging into something more intense as redness swims into his cheeks.
"You'd be best to do the introductions," I whisper, clearing my throat. ''He'll likely be less stressed by the presence of a strong female than by any male, no matter how gently I talk to him.''
At quarter past six, they return. Yuri enters first, Sherlock trails behind, shoulders tense, odd look on his face.
Good lord - he's lost all the reserve muscle around his torso. I can see the beating of his heart like an exposed organ in the air. The thought is sickening.
"Am I doing this alone?," I ask at last, biting my tongue and letting the previous matter rest. "Talking to him, I mean?"
"Do you think your 'what-if's' helps matters, John? To ask those sorts of questions? He coped as well as he could cope!"
''Still,'' I argued, ''I can't play anything. Never mind the fact that I am rubbish at advanced maths, too.''
''Ahh, yes, John. His entire body is bruised. Back, torso, belly. One really wonders what sort of physical activity could cause such extensive damage, Sherlock. Perhaps you could alleviate some of my...as you phrased it, melodramatic traits...by confiding in either John or myself - what precisely you've been up to recently.''
Her eyes are still smiling, even when her mouth relaxes. She really has no idea the tension I've caused.
"I am sure that you've heard enough horrible things for tonight, John. And I won't discuss this with you again, because frankly - it is far too difficult for me to face, except in times of utter necessity. But I needed you to know the complexity of the situation. The reasons for my concerns regarding you and Sherlock. Regarding any potential future developments. I need you to know that he may not be capable of returning anyone's affections, especially not sexually. In fact, if he feels conflicted about his relationship with you, it's possible that he may try to evict you from his life entirely. And I know that would probably bring ruin to him. You are - indeed - very good for him."
''Did you ever consider it's just an act? One big act to keep people away? To keep people from looking too deeply?''
He seems to pick up on my emotional state, and I hear a fuzzy voice near my temple say, tentatively:
Of course, I knew that I would never do this to Patrick. I knew that no matter how long it took, I would never desert him. Not just because I loved him – although that reality cemented my resolve – but because I knew that I had cared about him as a friend, first, and that our friendship was something that I wanted to preserve for the rest of our lives.
''Can I get either of you a beverage?,'' I ask, as is my typical way of greeting new clients. John, of course, smiles politely and requests a bottled water. Sherlock remains mute.
''I'm not going to see a damn thing of yours in the steam,'' I chuckled, a slight guilt lurking in my belly.
''Why aren't you dressed yet?,'' I grouse and Sherlock stops talking. Licks at his lemon meringue yogurt. Pulls one of the probiotic pills off the top and chews it up.
''Why not? It would fit. It would be textbook for this type of disorder, and it would also make sense given your history.''
I close my eyes and push the images back and away, because it is wrong and foul and dastardly. And it could never be a possibility.
I look around quickly then, reminding myself that I am actually in someone's living room - and not in a psychotherapists office at all.
What's more, I have never had a case of severe self-harm that did not occur in a patient that had suffered - at some stage of his or her life - severe abuse. Whether the abuse was even present in the mind of the sufferer (or repressed) was variable. But it is something that I almost always became aware of as therapy progressed.
''It doesn't have to be that stereotypically obvious. There is a range. Symptoms can encroach gradually, and worsen under stress. It could easily include or cover aspects of his behaviour that people have written off as Sherlock being merely eccentric. But he may be sicker than we previously suspected.''
His voice is so maddeningly suave in tone that if I hadn't recently seen Sherlock Holmes in the flesh, I would have had no inkling as to the horrid disorder ravaging his body.
'You can't honestly be angry at an innocent toddler, Sherlock,' imagined-John replies patiently when I don't answer. 'Babies never hurt you. Babies never hurt anyone.'
''That's what you were going to say, wasn't it? That you were just 'forced' to watch the proceedings?,'' I press my fingertips against my temples. ''Fuck,'' I growl, the word slipping out as if beyond my control.
I hear a giggle behind me, and look over to see a four or five year old holding up a package of wine gums over his younger brother. The younger child is hopping up over and over again, trying in vain to reach for the package, while the slightly older one keeps holding the treat just out of reach. The scene is so normal that I suddenly realize I'm in a god damn supermarket, and shouldn't be getting into anything weighty with Lestrade right now.
When we have finished our meal - Sherlock, yes, eating an entire serving of Vietnamese congee - we take a cab back to Baker Street, and Sherlock darts up the stairs.
'You're such a big boy, aren't you baby?,' the Martian speaks. His voice is buzzing in my brain, like an insect. Like an insect eating my brain. It makes it hard to think. 'Aren't you?'
The only thing I can trust and look to for guidance and support are facts. Quantifiable, unchanging data.
I know I'm blathering on and on, but I keep the wording and the pacing even and regulated. I hope the very act of explaining why he's experiencing what he's experiencing will help him through this with minimal anxiety.
WARNINGS: for conceptualizations and musings on self-harm. Rather detailed emotionality and speech about psychological duress. Nothing too involved, and really - this entire story deals with self-harm as an undercurrent focus - but this chapter is slightly more detailed on the subject. So proceed with caution.
Sherlock's lips come and dart out, like one of those bolting lizards that race out from under desert rocks - dashing for a bit of food or water, only to retreat once again to the quietude of their shadowed homes.
''Yeah,'' I mutter, looking down at my socks. One is torn, and the pink flesh of my heel protrudes from the argyle garment. ''Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you, Sherlock. Thank you for that, I mean.''
''Okay,'' he says so softly that I can't be sure the word is even intended for me at all. A little louder, then: ''I eat...soup. Most days, umm, I have soup.''
This - all of this - is not a response I would have expected for him. He's not phobic of blood, and he's endured far worse physical injuries in the past. And whatever has come over him has come quickly.
''I had no idea you've known one another for that long,'' I admit, now understanding a little better the warmth that I often see pass between Sherlock and our landlady. It certainly hadn't been a recent development. I knew that. But I hadn't known that it had taken over 13 years of cultivation.
When he catches sight of me at the door, he graces me with a fast and all-too fake smile. Taut, put upon.
It’s all too easy to hurt for him and I can’t afford to lose control of the situation right now. Not letting how I feel when a patient reveals something that has been wounding them for a considerably long time has always been the toughest part of my job.
''It's getting late, it's getting dark. At the end of the night, I can feel your heart.'' - Zola Jesus
''Cơm hến we make good. Authentic. We add shrimp or clam or what you like. Gỏi Huế rau muống with water spinach. Many people loves Gỏi Huế rau muống.''
To my left, a bay window cut out against the night and I could see the Japanese Maples in their reddish-purple intensity below.
I pull my arm back from his grasp and fold it over stomach, suddenly aware that my belly is hurting.
''What? What? Very amazing that a stupid, disabled man like me could finish elementary school, never mind finish University?''
After returning home from Maudsley three nights ago, I went on an all-out cleaning binge. If Sherlock thought I was being over the top before, he's going to be a little shocked to see just how restrictive I can be of his freedoms when it ensures he cannot hurt himself.
It'd be just like him to try to get me to talk to someone. Even though he hated going to a therapist, himself.
'''That determination.' And who gets to make that determination? You? It's never been an issue for you!''
''Dr. Watson?,'' and the physician extends a hand. ''My name is Dr. Marcus Riley. I was one of Sherlock's surgeons, and-''
''Because maybe I am a sociopath,'' I ground out, bitter. Angry. It was unfair. ''Just like I told you I am.''
''Has your brother stepped out, Mr. Holmes?,'' the doctor - Roarke? No, Rouse - asks briskly, and I feel a wave of irritation swell up in my heart.
I had stared at the text for what could have been 10 minutes before another one pinged in, alerting me to its presence.
''Did you figure out what you are, then?,'' I ask crisply, turning in a flourish to retrieve freshly made coffee.
“Please put these away too, before I chuck all of these teeny-tiny pieces into the linen closet for good,” I laugh, already sorting the coloured plastic into their respective bags – no real heat in my words.
I should really apologize. But I suspect that any apology I try to offer will result in mockery, and my nerves are frayed too.
Ironically, it was something I would later seek to hide from anyone who might have been able to help me.
It would just be like my flatmate to consume every last teabag in the package, and then to leave the package behind. This, of course, coming from a man who has a sock index. A clashing of traits, nonsensical at times.
When I stand up under the jet of hot water to rinse off, I suddenly feel the blood leave my head and see black spots. My heart begins to pound forcefully, and I suddenly can't hold back the wave of nausea. A second later, I'm vomiting out old tea, that smells of bile and whatever fermenting tea purged from my stomach would smell like - suddenly filling the air. Acrid, hot and disgusting.
''I...,'' and he points to his head. ''Too many thoughts, and-,'' I see him gulp-swallow air, overwhelmed. ''I don't-''
"Poisonous plants. I like poisonous plants. Reading about them helps me with cases,'' I mutter, as I follow behind. ''And that is a Ming Aralia. It is probably the dullest, least poisonous plant around.''
''I've told him about Victor,'' I wheeze. ''Told him we were together. Even - you know - even like *that*.''
"That must have been extremely awkward for a young boy," I mutter, feeling fresh concern blossom in my chest for my flatmate. "I can understand why he wouldn't have felt comfortable to discuss the subject. Especially not with his older brother in the room."
"It wasn't brand new to Toby, that's the thing. His teacher is about to have a baby. Apparently Toby asked her some rather - intrusive questions."
I bark out a bit of a laugh and move in incrementally slower, and - surprisingly - he leans slightly against me.
Needs me to tell him that he wasn't wrong for doing so. For changing it in his mind, as a child. For making it out to be something less horrific than it was.
And yet even I could identify the burgeoning signs of anxiety. Even then, as I identified them, I felt separated from fully feeling them. I could feel them distantly. As if a raw limb was defrosting.
He rubs at his eyes and I can sense that a bit of the tension has left his body. Not much. But some. It's a start.
When the moment passed, and my pulse surged forward into my skull - I felt sick with the simultaneous bodily sensation of calmness and the frightening realization that what I had just done to myself was more than just a little bit 'not good.'
''People care about you, Sherlock,'' I whisper. ''I care about you more than I have ever cared about anyone. I will never love someone as much as I love you. And I know right now you are struggling to feel that because everything is hurting you so much, but it's true.''
I wonder if we will ever have the type of relationship that advances to a stage where I can readily refer to him as ''Love.'' Where there are no restrictions on the usage of the word. And if so - what would that sort of relationship look like? What would it entail?
While everyone else bustled about their day, Harrison waited to be uncovered from his bed of leaves. Waited for someone to see his tiny outline against the rocks. Waited for someone to come along in rescue, before his remains could be pulled out on the tide.
Because Sherlock is my best friend, and as such it falls to me to do something more than I have done.
Sherlock is off to the corner, bundled up in a hunter green dressing gown and several blankets. His dark tresses look slightly greasy and fall over his eyes in weighted form.
''Initially,'' Dr. Riley admits. ''During the examination. We thought it best to try to work with him, provided he could answer any questions about his condition, but he was too worked up to avoid sedation altogether. Unfortunately, he was not in a state to tell us much. Once we had later fully sedated him, we were able to complete an endoscopy and see the source of the bleeding.''
I do, but find it excessively more difficult now that John has now finished his own. Still, I manage to finish the rest of the snack without too much of a delay, before rising and shaking off my coat to discard errant crumbs that have clung to the blue wool.
''Yes?,'' I ask softly. More softly than I want to ask, yet stepping close enough to the door that I know he can hear me.
I am getting to see in real time how he systematically removes himself from the moment. How he pushes down that which he equally needs to let up and express.
Sherlock stuffs his hands into his pockets. His eyes are closed, and he moves towards his bed, looking spent.
I cringe then, the anger not dissipating as it should. Sherlock's assumption that gentleness should only be granted in cases of fear or anxiety highlights just how little Sherlock understands about healthy relationships.
A flash of Sherlock's morning routine invades my thoughts: Sherlock picking up anise toothpaste at Tesco's, Sherlock buying toothbrushes with tongue scrapers, Orange flavoured Listerine. Cinnamon flavoured dental floss. Salon quality shampoos. He may be messy with his things, and he may rarely pick up after himself and leave his papers about - but he's usually very clean. His hygiene is usually impeccable. Nails scrubbed, never any scruff, clothes clean, smelling faintly of after shave and menthol.
There is no name attached to the file - just images. The first photo is of a child's arms, skeletal and scarred. A black jelly bracelet on one small wrist. The forearms covered in dozens upon dozens of various thin scars. Short, controlled nicks. Most of the scars are white, but some are obviously newer injuries and still stand out as a stark purple-pink against a backdrop of ashen skin. The body looks as if it's that of a young adolescent.
I have no intention of reading them, of course, but I'm hoping the question will help break the ice.
But I had guessed as much upon first meeting Sherlock when he had been admitted for his ulcer perforation.
That is an interesting development, considering I punched her husband without an obvious (at least in her mind) explanation.
They can threaten a person's physical existence, and from what I suspect of Sherlock - he's been struggling, acutely, for several months. And in a less acute sense, he's likely been engaged with disordered habits on and off since his childhood.
''What do you wish others would understand?,'' I ask calmly. ''How you feel? Why you feel as you do?''
Of course, my biggest, most idiotic moment in the last 23 years...and it had to be discovered following an unprecedented gastric attack landing me in the A&E?
Sherlock flexed his fingers when I was through with my tending, and I glanced about his space, suddenly at a loss as to how to proceed.
When that still doesn't work, I lightly touch his elbow, and he jolts back as if poked with a live current.
I bite back a laugh despite my nervousness, and Yuri opens the door yet again, indicating with his hand where I can sit.
I suddenly catch sight of Sherlock's Stradivarius (we won't talk about the insanity of how he keeps - or doesn't keep - his ungodly expensive bowed instrument in its case when not in use - another time). The lines of the violin, the richness of red - everything seems muted now.
''You have nothing to be sorry for,'' I say emphatically. ''I'm not...good at talking. I say things the wrong way sometimes. Most times. But-,'' and I take a sigh, ''I want to ensure that I can help you, but I don't know how. Unless you speak to me. Do you understand?''
His curls have been lightly brushed at best and are now drying in small ringlets about his face. He still looks a little petulant, however, as he shuffles down the hallway and flops against our black sofa in over-sized pajamas.
''You didn't intend to cut your thighs and your penis?,'' I whisper, and I know the words are harsh, and I know Sherlock is mortified when his face goes red and he looks down to the floor. ''How could ANYONE accidentally do something like that, Sherlock?''
I apologize for the terribly long delay between chapters. I've been quite sick, so thanks for simply holding on, and for continuing to read.
I scavenge my brain for anything that can help, and feel my cheeks flush as I say, ''I mean transport is...well, I can fulfill my own transport, can't I? So that would be a pretty sad excuse to let go of a bond that is deep and truly based on love, wouldn't it?''
"Mycroft was still at home," he adds a moment later. "He left for school, abroad, shortly before he turned 11 and a half, so I couldn't have been much older than three when it began."
''I don't think I find it quite as cold as you do. Anyway, we need to take your turtleneck off too, okay? It's not loose enough to roll up over your elbows.''
“I want you to stop thinking that I want to be removed from this. That I’m doing any of this for the outward display of doing the “right thing” – or to somehow check something off some friendship to-do list, alright? I want you to get it out, so it can be gotten rid of – these sort of feelings. It’s not weak to do that. Do you understand?”
Whenever he attempted to eat, he vomited out of fear that he would be 'punished' or that his family would 'suffer' and possibly die. From that conviction, he developed an extreme fear of eating - most notably a phobia of consuming solid foods. The fear of food was tied to a seemingly irrational fear of dying if he partook in certain activities.
I let out a bark of laughter. The absinthe has turned me into a saddening mass of need and tears and something hurting.
I hesitate. Decide that if Lestrade's going to be pissy with me, I'm likely to get irked in response. And John's seen enough of me acting like a child recently.
Because it means giving up all the customary and habitual (and soothing) routines that they have developed for themselves. Even if the routines are harmful.
All the same, I am starting to sense that there must be a distinct difference between romantic attraction and sexual attraction, since the latter is conspicuously absent here, while the former seems to be very strong - and continuing to grow in intensity.
''Can I have some plain water instead?,'' I croaked, my chest tight, my ribs pulled too far in discomfort at the request. ''This has sugar in it. It's bad for my pancreas.''
I give him a cautious smile. He’s always been caustically dismissive of this subject and as is my way – I won’t push him on this subject, either - though one day it does need to be addressed more fully. Probably sometime soon, too, given the direction that John and Sherlock have been heading as of late.
The boy looks startled. I am starting to suspect that he didn't so much as request to speak to me, as he did perhaps reference me in a moment of panic.
It was hurtful. Maybe because I've always credited John with being one of the few people in the world who not only noticed my differences, but accepted my eccentricities. But he's not accepting of them. Of me. He obviously doesn't get it.
When I get outside, it is dusk, and the lights of the nearby store windows are illuminated in the blue-black of the cooling night. Across the street from the Italian café lies the dark automobile, shiny and awaiting my arrival like a sea serpent waiting for its prey.
While we never discuss cases in any detail whatsoever for the obvious privacy reasons, he still checks in with me. He’s always been concerned by the possibility that one day I could burn-out. “Compassion fatigue” is the phrase he likes to throw around occasionally – usually after a rather draining session.
''There is no reason, John! I was stupid to think anyone other than you would truly want to help me with anything. This is exactly why I never see these types of so-called people! They always play mind games with you!''
''It's okay. I'm just opening the door, and then we will sit in Greg's police car, and you just have to close your eyes. You can sleep now, okay?''
It's a question I've never asked him before. Even prior to his lengthy stays, his intubations. His strung out days with needles and bands around his arms and track marks cording through his veins like acid rot.
Then I think: fuck it. What do I have to lose, really? Mycroft's respect? What do I care about more, anyway?
''you're in sherlock's organic chem class, aren't you?,'' Victor would inquire, politely. always so polite
Then, a few moments later, I see a slumped shadow fall towards the ground and hear the rustle of fabric against the door. His coat, I think.
I continue on - weeks and months of fear and frustration and growing anxiety quieting down as my words take shape.
It's a sanitized room. Sanitized, John feels, out of a particular need for my safety. Sanitized for my consumption.
''Okay, you don't have to tell me any more,'' I relent, my hand trailing to the nape of his neck. Eventually he starts to calm under the rhythmic motion of my hand. ''You've done really well, Sherlock.''
My breathing starts to slow down, assured that he's more or less okay if he can act like his snarky self.
''No,'' he interrupts firmly, brooking no argument. ''This is NOT your fault. You have been there for him since the beginning of your partnership, for lack of a better descriptor. You are attending therapy with him, John. Do you think anyone else would ever have had the courage to face the sort of things he has discussed with you? No one else has ever stood by him, but you have. Your loyalty has never gone unnoticed by me. You are most definitely not the cause of this. If anything, you are the sole reason he sought help tonight.''
And there was so little fanfare to that episode, too. He went in, spoke to doctors, spoke to Yuri, came home, and degraded further.
I don't disconnect our hands. Just trail their combined form up to our bookshelves. Point at the bookshelves, his fingers still entwined with my own.
So I can't ever abandon him. Not now and certainly not if he gets worse. I need to transmit complete faith in his mind, and his spirit, and the integrity of his being. For all his talk of being a sociopath, he is neither a sociopath nor a psychopath. He might be dealing with other conditions I have not fully considered, but he has a conscience, and his conscience is being batted about like a cat with a mouse right now.
"It hurts between your legs," I state after I've composed myself well enough to speak without Toby hearing my anger. "And it hurts, inside. Front and back."
''John,'' he hesitates, ''discussing Sherlock in this way - it's going to edge towards something ethically grey in my profession. I cannot discuss what I know about him with you.''
At 4:15 am, I waken yet again. This time my dreams are in technicolour as I was devouring red velvet cake. Large slabs of it with three inch high cream cheese icing. My stomach eventually became rotund with my mammoth ingestion. And what's worse is that Mycroft and John were watching my every moment of intake, silent and smiling and enjoying my consumption.
I see him frown at his stomach, and then see pale fingertips dance along his ribs, splay out over his torso. Press inwardly against his meager belly.
''This isn't about you, John. This has nothing to do with you,'' he pants. ''Isn't it possible that I could just be angry and yet – miraculously - not be angry with you?,'' he finishes, voice clipped.
''Just do your best,'' I say carefully, not wanting to give away how I feel. Tonal inflection is going to be the most overt clue I can give now, in the near dark, lying on my side.
Additionally, this is an experimental chapter (insofar as it is aiming to capture a very fractured mindset).
Because if anything could stir Sherlock to action, I thought - it would be mentioning getting his brother involved.
Mycroft's mouth purses into something distinctly off-put as he walks me through the entryway and into a separate room, separated from the hallway by a door that looks fashioned out of crystal. It is an art deco style. I can only guess at what it must have cost: undoubtedly, an exorbitant figure.
''I care about you, and you know I care about you - you have to know that much! - and yet we keep playing this game. Why? This pointless don't-talk-about it, talk-about-it, don't-talk-about-it game. Ad nauseum. When are you going to really face the truth? That your behaviour needs to change, and it needs to change right now!''
It's not to simply put John's mind at ease about Sherlock tackling his problems or facing his issues.
''No! I don't! I'm not some mewling, pathetic little child, John! I am a scientist. I can both discuss and conceptualize sexual matters far better than the average person, and you bloody well know it!''
(One of the benefits of an indulgent cocaine habit was a blissed out ability to fall asleep anywhere and at any time, and not have fear lurking about in my brain making me react like a scared child all night.)
"I cannot stop my idiot brother from discussing matters with you if he is so inclined, but is it too much for me to request that you do not look at me as you are currently doing?"
Then it is dark. Sherlock's frail form is pushed far away from mine, as he is trying to give me most of the space on the bed. I tug lightly with his hand.
I back up in my seat, almost alarmed, and close my eyes. I then count to 10, backwards, before continuing on.
The question so bare-bones, so in-his-face, that it leaves little room for Sherlock to hide. It leaves no room for shelter in words and meandering thoughts and displaced ideas. It's too blunt for that.
Foghorns had likely wailed in the distance, and most people were probably rushing to take the tube to work. Rushing to get chips with malt vinegar. Rushing to get to the park with their toddlers to feed the fattened ducks, or visiting their aging parents, or even returning overdue library books while counting themselves unlucky for their tardiness.
But there is no response so I move hesitantly back into the room, now darker than before if only for the setting sun.
''Why are you trying to make me upset, John?,'' and his voice is warbling. ''Did Mycroft put you up to this? Overweight oaf thinks anyone who isn't horrendously obese is sick, so I expect this from him. But this? This is not funny at all.''
I suddenly feel queasy. Something distant and alarming is clamouring up in my brain, trying to tell me something. A faint feeling of foreboding.
''No,'' I stress. ''I haven't. Hence my confusion. I mean...I am 42 years old. I should know what I am by now.''
''When you find that you feel this way, does it help to lessen the - swarming?,'' he tested, ''when or if you engage in certain things physically? Like working until you are very exhausted, skipping meals? Not sleeping?''
''Of course not. Will you be able to sleep in those...things?,'' he asks skeptically, as if the idea of my sleeping in anything that was not expensive silk is foreign to him. Which may very well be the case. In so many ways, his life has been this strange blend of horror, but also decadent indulgence. He never suffered for lack of materialistic goods. His suffering was primarily emotional.
''Oh God,'' I get out, as his hands seem to grasp for something to hold onto. ''It's over, love. It's over now. Just a few more minutes, and then we are going back home. You and me, and no one is getting in my way. You are almost out of here, Sherlock. I just need you to be strong for a little longer now, okay?''
Now, as I ascend the stairs and wander back to Sherlock's bedroom, I am aware of everything. How my knees pop when I move after having been completely immobile for hours. How the wood groans under my body as I move. How the door hinges most definitely need more WD-40.
''There is this scene, where this young woman is engaging with a character in the novel called the 'first talking robot.' It's meant to be, essentially, an artificial intelligence. And so this young woman, a student, is trying to ascertain the whereabouts of a secondary robot. So she asks the talking robot-''
So that's what I want to ask him now. What brought these demons back to life after such a long time of being suppressed.
If anything, I expected him to run off. Or ignore me. Petulantly ignore me until the weeks passed and the tension became so severe that he'd force me into reticence. A small part of me worried that he'd actually leave Baker street. It was a fleeting thought, but it was there.
''Ok. We'll get back to that in a few moments. I just want to clarify: you do, in fact, find him aesthetically attractive?''
He tenses, closes his eyes. I can see his hands are shaking, and when he opens his eyes again he looks somehow even more disconnected than he did a few seconds prior.
So I know that this is another topic we are eventually going to need to address. Obviously with Yuri, as I seem to muck everything all to shit when I try to deal with it myself.
''Sherlock,'' John whispers, suddenly grabbing my hand. I step back speedily, and the towel drops from my hips, exposing the pallor of my legs.
''I wasn't sick,'' he mutters, his throat swallowing convulsively, his hand holding onto mine with greater force than before.
''You wanted me to make an effort,'' he says in a stupor of sleepiness. ''I promised you that I would try.''
His left shoe had been displaced somewhere during the event. Lost among stones and sandy earth not even twenty feet from the edge of the river.
That made it even worse. The knowledge that I had gotten somebody else emotionally invested in my tiresome little life.
''A ringing endorsement, if I've ever heard one,'' she quips, and then adds, ''Something you don't hate. Anyway, I have four. Two boys, two girls. They're rescues.''
His plate looks almost the same as mine in terms of the size of the food offerings, the types of foods and my estimation of their calorie content. His sandwich actually looks slightly larger. Slightly, only slightly. But still...
''What's going on, John?,'' Lestrade mutters a couple seconds later, and that's it. That one question is enough to grab hold of me - to make me realize what I'm actually doing.
''Of course he left. He wanted sex, and I hated it, and he thought I didn't care for him. I wouldn't 'put out' as much as he wanted, and-''
Turning to Sherlock, I press against the glass partition with my shoulder as Yuri pads back down the hallway.
Distantly, I feel a part of myself wonder if this is how it seems to anyone when they aren't expecting something sexual to occur.
I want to cry and I don't want to cry. I want him to hug me and I don't want to feel his skin against mine at all. I want to talk, and I want to be me. I want to be me.
I close my eyes, let the shame of the dream worm its way through my mind, for in the dream we both wore our shirts, our socks. We weren't totally naked. It wasn't something racy or heated. The pace was too slow, the movements nothing if not gentle.
''He could come here. Come here, have soup with us. Different place, different atmosphere? Might help.''
I look down, and realize with horror that I've urinated all over myself. I turn around, slide out and come to rest on the other side of the bed, pressing my face against the wall. Willing myself not to hyperventilate.
I open my eyes cautiously now, my mind racing with superstitious, silly, childish thoughts. Thoughts that make no sense. Thoughts I rarely entertained - even when I was a child.
Sherlock seemingly ignores my question and brings his hands up and over into his peripheral vision as if making animal shapes. The type of physical hand movements a parent would do if wanting to project shadow animals onto a wall for their child.
''Do you sometimes find yourself anxious because you do not know if you can identify a particular emotion? You are aware, at some level, that you feel badly, but it vacillates, and it feels like an alien emotion? Something you can't name?''
“You do realize that feeling upset over what you’ve just told me would not be an abnormal response, don’t you?”
I give his hand a slight squeeze when he fails to respond, his breathing harsh and his chest rising in sharp bursts.
''No!,'' Sherlock hisses, eyes swelling with tears. I see a flash of white from his teeth cutting into his lip. ''Not anything like that!,'' he gets out in a rush, dropping his head down to his kneecaps, and encircling his head with his arms. ''I know Mycroft will never hurt me,'' he now mumbles from beneath the folds of his pajamas, his voice thick and heavy.
''All you have to do right now is rest. Rest, be still, give yourself a bit of a break. Because you've been pushing yourself for far too long, haven't you, Sherlock?''
I sigh. ''I asked if I could just talk to this kid alone for a few moments. In retrospect, it probably made it worse. The father got incredibly antsy and so I did my best to backpedal. Took blood, sent it off with the swabs, and told them both I wanted this young girl to see a specialist for stomach issues. Then I contacted a pal that worked over at...,'' I suddenly feel a fresh wave of pain. ''At The Priory.''
''I wish I could say,'' I give him a very weak smile. It's all I can do at the moment. ''I know sometimes things hold onto us for a long time, and don't let us go. And then one day we wake up, and the rawness of something...that has hurt us for a very long time...is gone. Or diminished. But I can't tell you why that happens, or what makes one random day the day when it hurts less.''
''Then he needs a clinic! Inpatient, right? He needs to go in, stay in, be fed,'' and my voice is soft. Strangled. ''He might hate me, but so what? Is that what you think he needs?''
I stand up then, feeling a deep need to pace. If I don't dispel some of the tension in my system, I'm going to start ranting, and that would not be to Sherlock's benefit. Not with the amount of adrenaline coursing through my entire body at present.
The dishes sit in the sink, doused in a covering of cold water and stale bubbles. The water is cloudy from cream and remnant bits of food.
''Sherlock?,'' I state with as much equanimity as I can muster. ''Am I doing something that frightens you? If I am, you absolutely have to tell me. You cannot continue to handle all this by yourself. It's not working.''
''Mmmtired,'' he mumbles, ''And I don't want to think about it all. I just want to pause it. Pause life. Just not deal with it any more tonight. I'm sick of thinking about it and talking about it. You must be even more sick of it than I am,'' he whispers. ''I bet you're half sick to death of me by now.''
''So no solids?,'' I test gently, knowing the answer already - and hating that I have to ask. ''Is it only liquids right now?''
''Of course it matters! Do you think anyone else would be so conflicted right now if they hadn't gone through what you went through?''
'''Like that','' he mumbles to himself, looking thrown by my word choice. Glances back up to me. ''Have you discussed what he did? How it actually unfolded?''
Sarah laughs. Not meanly. No twinge of cruelty or enjoyment. Her voice, her laugh, rings out like a bell. As if she finds my suggestion humorous.
John would usually change his order about much more than I ever did, and so on these trips, if I was standing in close proximity to him – I would catch notes of hazelnut, or French vanilla, or Dulche de leche with cinnamon and cloves.
Sherlock fidgets, and I grasp his hand. Feel the internal coldness bleat out against the heat of my own.
Warnings: this chapter deals with discussion of alexithymia, RAD (reactive attachment disorder) and abuse. Please heed the warnings.
So even as an infant I knew he wasn't normal. Because while as a newborn he had cried... as a toddler he rarely did.
''Alright. Why would his interest in being or remaining your flatmate make him an illogical person?''
''Are we going on the boat now?,'' he asks softly. Because this little boy likes boats. He draws them all the time and his mummy affixes them to his bedroom wall with double-sided tape. He has nautical print pajamas, and blue and white piping on his bed spread. He builds models of larger ships with his daddy, too. Some even get placed into green bottles, corked and placed above the fireplace in the McKenzie home. '''Cause I'd really like to go on a boat!''
Sherlock looks at me strangely, almost imploringly, before glancing up and over my head. He finally settles his vision on a bust enclosed in a glass partition on Yuri's bookcase. The marble of the sculpture is lit up by an internal halogen - on the underside of the shelving - and the cherry wood creates a heated glow about the figurine not unlike a burst of red sunlight.
''But you can't make them go away, and you never will be able to, Sherlock. So, you had to choose between fullness and hunger, and you chose hunger. Not once, but repeatedly.''
Anyway, since he didn’t take to the subject naturally I became something of a tutor to him over the course of the winter semester. And it was during those review sessions (and all the small moments shared between the two of us when others were not really around) that I slowly got to learn that first appearances are rarely all that accurate.
"I wasn't a bad kid," he whispers a few moments later. "I know everyone thinks I must have always been like this, but I wasn't bad then."
''Not gay?,'' I say edgily, not knowing what my problem is - aside from the pounding pain in my skull. Why I want to bait him.
She then opens the door to let me pass, and my eyes search out for a chair or a stool. Something I can sit on. Some way I can rest.
''Why?,'' he says dismally. ''You didn't - wouldn't - eat dinner. But you were up in the middle of the night ransacking the cupboards?''
''I don't want anything you can't give, and despite what Mycroft thinks or what you think, I'm not gay! Nor bisexual!''
'I'm sorry, little one,' my mind supplies to the ghosted image. 'I am sorry you had to go through so much pain.'
The fact that I can never be this open with him when he's awake isn't lost on me. Even so, I hope that some small part of him is hearing me right now. Hearing my words and stashing them away for such time when I can't be with him.
So when I met him, and when he opened his mouth and said such ridiculous things, and appeared so untouchable, so full of self-regard as to not let anything derail him from his passions - I wanted to learn his secret.
Something that likely could help Sherlock just as assuredly as it could rip a hole the size of a shotgun blast through his heart.
'Your brother is on the phone for you, Sherlock. We've had enough of this silliness, haven't we?,' and I nodded, sniffled. Grabbed the phone, and shouted into the receiver.
''I was 13, and Mycroft thought I was having some sort of...,'' and his voice trails off. ''I don't know what Mycroft thought, honestly. I don't know what it was. It was stress. Mycroft may have thought it was a 'break.' That was in his oh so humble opinion. He was only 20 himself, mind.''
''All done?,'' he says in a clipped manner, and I pull back at his phrasing. ''Or would you rather extend the length of this afternoon visit derailing the conversation by asking me questions about my personal life?''
Click the door of the vehicle soundly. Click my umbrella against my leg. An old habit, warding off danger.
I felt it radiate throughout the room; the sound of a slight and immediate rustling of clothes. As if he had pulled back or moved quickly.
''I've never thought you were weak, and I never will. And how could anyone in their right mind think you are less than brilliant, Sherlock?,'' I ask, almost irritated that he's digging it out of me.
I remember it quickly. Abruptly. Like a thunder clap of images and scents. Like a flashbulb going off in my mind.
I remove the afghan that I've pulled over my body and toss it back over the love-seat, then open the blinds.
''Yes,'' he responds quickly - without reservation - and I feel another surge of amusement at his tone. The interplay between his word choices and his question arguably insulting (to some) yet still (legitimately) asking for help.
I merely saw someone very sick, and thought that gentle nudges and encouragement and patience would fix him.
''But this is the opposite,'' and his voice is rough when he speaks next, ''there was no pain before. None at all. It happened so long ago. And now I feel like-''
But they go anyway. Because they don't want to see, either. Nobody 'cept the Martian wants to see this part.
''I don't know what to do,'' I admit, pointing to the groceries. ''I can make up for what I take, but-''
There is a delay - a tide going out with his words - and coming back with darker water than I would have expected.
''It does concern me! I'm your best friend, and I can see that you're hurting! I can see that you're confused and you're angry - and I understand that. I'd feel just the same if it had happened to me.''
It makes me want to hug him. It makes me terribly want to just grab him and hold him and ensure him that everything will be ok in the end. That he'll be okay. That he won't always feel like this.
''I don't care how you look,'' I test to his confusion, and his brow spasms with fear of dejection. ''No, you misunderstand. I don't care if you look any way - skinny or not - provided you are healthy. And right now? Right now I care a heck of a lot more about how you feel. Maybe how you feel about how you look, even though I doubt that this,'' and I make a wide arc with my fist, ''is about looking good or looking any one way in particular. I think it has a lot more to do with feelings.''
''Nope. All my doing. I think it's helpful to hold onto a little bit of whimsy in life. Especially in my line of work.''
Instructing me to clear a space on the grass, to make sure there was nothing sharp in the immediate area.
When I've taken our agreed upon six mouthfuls of soup, I turn away and collide into the mattress, face down.
Lestrade is studying me intensely, in the vein of Sherlock himself. His ease, his warm and bright smile is now gone. His presence of softness, yet competency, has now become competency merged with a steely, vacillating nervousness.
''Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade and Mike and Molly and many, many others deeply care for you and respect you, and you don't even know it, do you?''
''I can imagine that it would be an awful thing to witness. John?,'' I ask carefully, ''I want you to write down three things you'd like to see improve. In terms of how Sherlock cares for himself. And then I want you to read them out.''
And torches too. The blue-white light of Lestrade's torch cutting through the evening sky, swinging around the buildings, swinging around the lot from 100 meters away.
But sod this. Sod everything. Sod appropriate-John doing appropriate things and having a stiff fucking upper lip.
I blink quickly, moving the trolley aside when the cashier in front of me waves me over. I hold up a finger to indicate that I need a minute and take myself out of the line.
''That's the truth,'' I volley back. ''Even if I'm terrible at this; because I know I am. But that doesn't change the fact that I'm trying to help you.''
''Because your mind is playing tricks on you, Sherlock,'' I whisper through the slot between door frame and floor. ''Because for once, your mind can't be trusted. It's not giving you the truth any more. Not about yourself, and you are all I care about right this second. So you have to let someone else take over. And I don't care if it's me, or not, Sherlock...but you need help.''
''I wanted to, John. And then I realized how completely, unarguably insane that would be. I was feeling so awful, I was so angry – and my first impulse was to feel something else. Something not as wrong, I guess. But hurting myself is wrong, too, isn't it? That's not what I'm supposed to feel when I'm angry, is it? It's a bad response, and I know that, but I still seek it out. And I don't know why.''
The man drew back suddenly, not letting out a sound - simply cradling his nipped palm against his chest, eyes wide.
''You just said you couldn't live like this any longer. That means something. And since I am the one putting you through...this...it only could mean one-''
I pack a lunch of grapes, crisps, a cheese stick in colourful packaging intended for kids (and which I thought Sherlock may nibble on. No luck), and a thermos of black coffee. With sugar. For energy.
''Sherlock,'' I whisper. ''I want to understand. But you need to speak to me. I can't do this alone. You need to talk.''
"He was extremely depressed with developments that he could neither avoid nor slow. I have ascertained that it was likely due to the normal sexual changes he knew to expect. He was not coping well with even the prospect of their arrival, apparently."
''You are malnourished, for starters. That alone can trigger panic attacks. Remember last time this happened? Horlicks for dinner? And anxiety begets anxiety. You need sleep and-''
''I had him on the phone, you know? I asked him if he had gotten my letters,'' and his voice teeters off into something which can only be described as weird. Distant in a very odd, numbed fashion. ''Because I had written to him so much, and he must have received at least one.''
''I suspect your blood sugar is very, very low right now. You are incredibly pale, and that's going to lead to you feeling shaky, and possibly a little unreal. I know you feel a little scared to do this, but I want you to try to drink this beverage, Sherlock.''
''Romantic?,'' he tries, as if he's offering up suggestions to his past. I realize he's likely as confused as I feel.
I move his dressing gown away, slightly. Gingerly, so as to not generate more pain. His black silk pant leg has been torn, and the skin peaks out in identification of the injury.
''In a manner of speaking. The case is now in the so-called 'highly capable' hands of the New Scotland Yard.''
''I'm a freak!,'' he barks, his voice catching in his mouth and sounding warbled. ''Just like they always said!''
He gives me an appraising look, his eyes roaming over my frame. I nervously adjust my jacket, before taking it off.
''Ne-ed?,'' and my voice breaks into two portions, the word completely fractured. ''Sherlock, I don't need this from you.''
At first, I thought that he was injured, before seeing the small body cradled to his chest, the stick-man way Sherlock walked with the dead weight in his arms.
''Right, well come in. Lots of space,'' I say easily, keeping the tone and the dialogue simple. I have worked in this profession for long enough to know that taking anything personally, especially when a person is conflicted about getting better in the first place, would equal utter foolishness.
I know that gentle prodding, such as 'Please take these vitamins, Sherlock' or 'Can't you have just a little bit more soup?' will feel laden with meaning and fear for him, and will lead to a sort of begrudging sense of guilt for myself. As if the relative and short lived peace that their disorder offers them, even at their worst, really shouldn't be yours to take away.
''Sherlock! Get up! Get your socks on. Brush your hair! You're not four years old, and I'm not your primary school teacher; I shouldn't have to nag you to do these things,'' I grouse.
He was trying to keep this from paining me more than was ultimately possible, and I felt a sudden, irrational sharpness lance through my eyes.
He comes closer into my space, and I hope I don't look sullen. But I'm not holding out any hope that I don't.
But part of me knows that everything I have seen is a measure of pain, and the thought makes me feel hollow with hopelessness.
AN: this chapter contains a semi-graphic description of rape. It is veiled as occurring within a dream. The language use has changed somewhat to take on a more childlike tone, reminiscent of an eight year old (Sherlock at age 8). Please proceed carefully.
"I wouldn't eat," I admit, my voice sounding hollow and odd to my own ears. Almost as if another person is talking through me. Not me, not Sherlock. Normally, I'd be snarling at him for having the gall to even ask. Right now, however, I feel tired of denying, of running.
But the days past that time seem like a blur to me now. Mostly long days of working at the surgery, and nights of reading and trying to talk to him while dealing and processing my own stress and the intensity of our confrontations.
''I don't have the most amicable relationship with doctors,'' I concede, ''I don't like them, and they don't like me. So unless I'm sick, I don't go to a doctor.''
The easiest thing may be to have him serve himself, and I will serve my own meal separately afterwards. Additionally, if he doesn't select enough items to meet the caloric goals I have outlined for him (after going over a plan with Mycroft, too) I guess at that point we will have to add a meal supplement to his plan. Just as was the case in the clinic. He's not going to like it but it will be obviously something for him and him alone.
His lips were an unfathomable sort of pink, almost mind-boggling to see on a man sans makeup - and they formed a perfect Cupid's bow. His face was angular, and almost alien-like in structure, but handsome in a disarming, atypical way.
''I don't need you to be sorry! Sorry doesn't change the fact that I couldn't do my job, and no one else could see that!''
“What’s inside you that anyone could possibly hate? Hmm?,” I question gently. “What is inside you that deserves to be hated?”
''Sherlock?,'' and Molly's looking at me intently now. She's moved. From the loveseat, to the sofa, and I have no idea when that happened. How it happened. If I've been gone for ten seconds, or a minute, or longer.
''I care about you a great deal. I knew you were angry with me. I didn't know you were really hurt.''
''John,'' Mycroft says rapidly, glancing about, keeping his voice even. ''I will do my best to answer your questions but you must remain calm. Please. For Sherlock,'' he says with a hint of steel in his timber.
I can be impulsive at the best of times. I know this. But what I've done lately is beyond my ordinary display of impulsivity. I have screwed up on such a mammoth scale as to put Mycroft's blundering oversights - his very worst ones - to shame. And that, sad as it may be, is what really burns me.
On a metal shelf, I caught sight of an aquarium - probably 30 or 40 gallons, which housed the aforementioned chameleon - along with terrariums on the floor, which housed everything from a miniature botanical world filled with insects and slugs, to succulents, to what looked like a enclosure of aquatic plants, with affixed growth lights suffusing the flora in pinks and blues.
But I also know I can't expose this deep, dark demon that's sunk its claws into his frame. Not without causing him to lose the frail trust he's already placed in me.
His face looks ashen, and it is so strange, so bizarre. How can anyone be so afraid of eating a bit of soup, or a bit of salad?
I stare at the scale and press the ON button; the last weigh in digitally pops up on the display screen.
It feels like a warning. A commandment from a boss to a subordinate. There is a note of something in those words. An acknowledgement of a reality outside of the one I've been exposed to, and I don't like the suggestion one bit.
''I don't know if I can help anything, but if he would even listen to you-,'' I begin, but the DI utters, ''you are his friend, and he knows that. You're maybe the only one he's ever considered a real friend. But I can tell when a man is about to lose it, and what I saw today? Sherlock's about to blow. I thought I could at least give you a heads up.''
''I don't want this in your life in any form, Sherlock. The hope I have for you is not that you'll merely be borderline healthy for the rest of your life. I'm not concerned about rounding off rough edges, making you 'presentable.' I care about you, wholly you! To me, and yes I'm speaking plainly now - but you have a disorder, Sherlock. You have a serious disorder that is known to have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness! So, in part - you're right. I don't want you to just put on weight, or just look better. It's not about looks to me! It's about YOU! How you feel! How you feel about yourself, when no one is around, and when no cases are present for you to solve or obsess about. When it's just you, and those memories - and how those memories invariably make you feel, and what those memories make you want to do!''
''Sir,'' the woman tries again - this time with an edge to her voice - ''Mr. Holmes is not allowed visitor access for the next three-''
I frown, unsure how to voice the semi-formed ideas in my mind without having them shot down before I finish the first sentence.
I breathe out heavily. From what Greg had described - the vast amount of blood, Sherlock clutching at his stomach in pain - I had suspected as much. The details sounding like some sort of rupture.
''Don't be silly, John. Don't be utterly ridiculous,'' and now I am speaking to the groceries, and not to him at all. No, right now I am speaking to the melting vanilla ice-cream. To the bag of blueberries and the almond crescents. ''I got you Hobnobs, by the way. The orange-chocolate ones,'' I add rapidly, wanting to get off the current subject. John's current - and unfounded - fears. ''Those are your favourite, right?''
Slightly rounded, swollen eyes. Puffy, almost-allergenic eyes. But kind. Sea-green eyes, intense and both old and young and gentle and firm, all at once.
''It'll be after noon,'' I say dumbly. ''In about, umm, 45 minutes or so. If he calls back on schedule.''
"I didn't want it in my body!," I exclaim, anger and fear now coming to the surface, the image of John in my mind, my lips against his, and it's not real, none of it is real, and I don't think of him like that, and I could never-
I let my fingers cascade over my chest and along my torso as I rub at the flesh with the cloth. Eventually the skin changes colour from pale white to reddish, and that change, ironically enough, indicates that the area is sufficiently cleansed.
The face was now ashen; from mild shock or simply a trick of the light, I was not sure. But when I glanced to his hand, I could see it was rather violently torn, and I felt adrenaline pulse out into my body, like a tapeworm of heat.
What matters is that Sherlock doesn't continue to find creative ways to fight going to his sessions.
''No,'' he utters softly, ''like...stab him, John. Take him outside, somewhere cold and very far away from other people. No one to rescue him. No one to hear him or see him or offer him any hope. Tie him up and stab him over and over again. With something not quite sharp. And maybe put something into his mouth so he can't make any noise.''
And suddenly I have an awful sense of what is going on, and again - it is more than a feeling, but it is not really based on anything physically demonstrative. All the same, I can't just ignore it. I look back at his tray.
Mycroft never drops any issue he feels is of seriousness, and nothing could be much more serious than what happened to Sherlock.
"So tell me! Go ahead. How does something like that define "someone like me"? How do you think I've struggled all these years?"
Yuri looks as if he's about to speak, but refrains as our waiter approaches - a Coke in one hand, a black (decaf!) coffee in the other. Both items are deposited in front of us, and I pick mine up greedily. Not hungry, I don't think, and definitely not thirsty - but wanting to hold onto something warm. Something with which I can fidget.
I usually get to my stomach, and stop there. The data is confusing since my stomach often feels swollen and hot – as if an acidic bite is glomming onto my flesh and feeding. What’s more - I find that out of all the areas of my body I have difficulty understanding my stomach and head are the hardest to handle, hardest to consider - if only because I often seem to confuse the physical pains that could be caused by an ulcer, apparently, with the emotional issues that could cause nausea or waves of pain.
''I'm sorry for calling him, I guess. I didn't mean to embarrass you,'' and my face feels flush. I suddenly feel badly in adding to Sherlock's sense of shame. Because it's normal to want to preserve your sense of dignity at all times, but especially during something involving such trauma. ''I just didn't know what else to do.''
''And I know you won't want to, really, but I hope you'll tell me what happened to your throat. If someone hurt you, they are not going to get away with it. But I won't force it out of you. I promise you that; I will try to pay more attention to how you feel. I'm sorry I didn't hear you well enough before. I am so sorry if I contributed to your pain, or your anxiety. If I made you feel worse in any way.''
Devour the cereal within a few minutes, barely chewing. Into my mouth, swallow, gone. Into my mouth, barely taste, swallow, in, gone.
''You sure you don't feel nauseated?,'' I clarify again. Because he's sweaty, but he's certainly not running a fever. If anything he feels too cold, and-
My hand comes up carefully, and finally rests on the small of Sherlock's back. I move my palm in slight clockwise movements and see him brush at his eyes with the back of one curled fist. He starts to calm down a bit, although his face is now infused with pink.
I rested Bisquick at my feet, and made my way towards Sherlock's bed, let my fingers touch discarded pajamas. Indigo with a herringbone print.
''It wasn't hard to figure out. If you want to know the truth, realizing that point helped me - you know - figure out why you might have been putting up those 'boundaries' as you call them - in the first place. But it's alright Sherlock. More than alright. You guys work together. Fit together.''
''Not everything about you has to change. I don't want that, I doubt Yuri wants that, and if that's what is making-''
More than that, Sherlock reveals some new factors about why he may have done what he did to himself.
''I think he's anorexic,'' I grit out. ''And I think he's doing himself severe harm because he's basically stopped eating. But no one will actually *do* anything. So is he actively suicidal? Maybe not. But the end result is going to be pretty much the same at the rate he's going, isn't it?''
His electrolytes were badly disrupted, and his back was unnaturally bony. The vertebrae jutted from his skin like a knobbly snake of tethered stone, trying to rip through his body.
Sherlock's motions have become stiff. He wraps his arms, undoubtedly unconsciously, over his chest, then stops his motions. Forces them back down to his side in an effort to feign general composure.
''Did Lestrade say I make myself throw up? Did Molly? Well fuck them, and fuck you! I am not bulimic!''
''More than a couple pounds, Sherlock. When have you eaten last?,'' she asks quickly. ''And coffee doesn't count. Neither does tea.''
Certainly knowing that fact alone could make anyone feel complicit. And from what he's told me tonight, I now can comprehend why he's always seems so abnormally concerned about Sherlock.
So when I speak next, it's with a brute impulsiveness that is rare for me. Not rare for Sherlock, maybe - but rare for me.
Oh, for the record - this chapter was the hardest for me to write. But it ends much more hopefully than possibly any other previous chapter.
''Please - c'mon, sit down. We'll talk. We'll talk calmly. We'll figure out what we are going to do. We'll fix this.''
''How long has this been going on?,'' she asks cleanly, not exactly looking stern, but also not looking playful like she typically does.
''I've left a time-sensitive experiment going for hours now. Completely forgot about it,'' and Sherlock gives her a terse smile; his lips covering his teeth, his eyes darting around in anxiety for his shoes.
Suddenly, I have the strong sense to contact Mycroft if only to let him know that I am on my way. After all, I don't know if Sherlock has even been admitted under his legal name, or under that of an alias, or which ward he's been taken to...or anything else, really.
Molly calls us to her small, yellow kitchen not five minutes later. I take the middle seat - Sherlock takes a chair closest to the window. He attempts to awkwardly open the window with the roll out hinge, which Molly assists him with right away.
"I can't believe you are using that against me! That was a lifetime ago! And I told you that in confidence! Not so you could hold that information over my head like this is some sort of twisted poker game. And now you and Mycroft-"
Toby shrugs, then goes back to staring at his book. He abruptly closes it, his eyes flashing up to mine suddenly.
''Not at all,'' he murmurs, his voice - usually so deep and strong - now the lightest note on air. ''He's not to blame for...why I'm like this.''
''Yeah, that's the plan, Molly. I'm doing all this therapy jazz primarily to secure more organs from you. That's my most pressing need these days.''
''We found evidence of self harm on your body when we got you prepped for surgery. Concentrated mostly on your upper thighs. Some wounding on your genitalia too, which is an exceedingly dangerous place to cut.''
''What?,'' he rasps, ''are you possibly seeing in me that isn't self-destructive? Because I know that-,'' and his mouth screws up. ''I'm sick, okay? I know it's wrong. I know it's hurting John, and I know it's hurting me - and I still hold on to it. And I don't know why. Why I want it. Why it feels like I need it! So how is that not self-destructive?''
His eyes want to meet mine; I can sense that. I can also sense that he can't quite make himself do that much. Which alarms me.
I forbid myself to press against my stomach, against my hip bones – which are now rapidly disappearing. Or perhaps I should clarify: the feel of the bony outline, I mean, is rapidly disappearing – not my stomach, definitely not – which seems to be inexorably taking on a new shape.
Some faint trill. Some faint catch that isn't deception and isn't anger and isn't Sherlock just dealing with This.
John's hands have moved across my shoulders. Rhythmic motions against my spine, too. An attempt to be soothing, comforting.
''I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'' he hisses, upset and embarrassed. ''I just - I just don't need you to watch me-''
''No. That's not what I meant at all. I could get the deeper motivations. I meant - I could never understand why other people could not see more than the surface of it all. Because this thing? That you're fighting? I don't think you're doing this to hurt yourself. Not really.''
When he turns to me, I see a few errant tears that have leaked onto his lashes and have made them seem darker.
“I’m not playing games. Anger is a normal response to what I went through,” he replies quietly but with an edge of irritation. Not quite whispering, but almost. “And I think I am angry. I think I am furious.”
''My sister had problems - has problems. When she was a teenager she drank, but she also did drugs. Sometimes she was so high, I don't think she'd know if a bomb had gone off, never mind if her 10 year old brother was in the same room with her while she got it on with her girlfriend.''
Besides, sick or not, struggling or not: he needs his own space. I just have to ensure that the space is safe for him. That he can come to no harm while he decompresses and finds his equilibrium once more.
And Sherlock still hasn't answered, and this too makes me angry. Angrier than it would have if I hadn't grown up in a family of addicts who basically lost their lives to dependencies, and then nurtured those same dependencies with such seeming care over their own children.
I turn off the scale, pack up the box, and move it back into the position that I had previously found everything.
''I don't need anymore oxygen,'' I say in response, just to say something. Just to break through the awkwardness which my stupidity has caused everyone.
''He took what would have been a lethal dose of morphine. If he hadn't been taken to A&E, of course.''
But because you were too little to help anyone, even yourself - you just felt bitter towards them all. Bitter, then guilty, then bitter over feeling guilty. Until one day, as an adult, you said ''fuck this,'' and deployed to Afghanistan.
''We will get the fresh stuff last, 'kay? That way it stays freshest, longest. How does that sound?''
Silly because if Sherlock doesn't want to answer it, he won't. And I highly doubt he'd want to answer such a question.
''Thank you,'' he replied in hesitation, and it came out almost questioning in tone. As if he rarely even said thank you, the words themselves sounding brittle and foreign in his mouth.
It opens easily. Readily. And I try to dismiss the aspect of forcefulness here, knowing it is the lesser of two evils.
''We're flat mates, and best friends,'' I say cleanly, but my hands are still rubbing against my jeans, and I know I must look like an anxious lover and not, in fact, a best mate.
I smiled. Kissed his neck. The spot where his vertebrae extended furthest from his skin, almost obscenely in his thinness.
''I feel like you're stalling. You are talking, I'm not saying you're not - but you do not seem to be actively getting better. The talking is needed. I know it is, and I know you need to get it all out. But your physical health has to be stabilized first - before anything else, really. Mycroft's not exactly mistaken about that point, and I know you don't want to hear this: I am not being melodramatic, either, but the thought of anything happening to you terrifies me.''
So - of course he's cute - with his over-sized athletic sweats and stick-up hair. The fact that he was in the army takes the cake, though. Because if you didn't know John - I mean really not know him - most people probably would peg him as a primary school teacher, or maybe a kindly librarian.
These are truths he should have integrated into his being as a child. Should have been taught, kindly, from his earliest moments.
I kissed his temple, and he stilled. The fluttering motions of his hands, when worked up, stilled. He tightened his grasp around my torso, and I kissed his temple again. And then again, and then wound my kisses around to his cheek, kissed the corner of his lips.
''Do you think I really needed to talk to Yuri to figure this out?,'' I reply evenly. ''I can only imagine how unsettling this is for you.''
But I can't stop. Not really. Not if in an hour, or two, Sherlock is just going to reset, and firmly march back to his previous way of being.
''You got top honours because you have a gifted mind, Sherlock. That's the truth of it. But that could have been achieved without drugs, or sleep deprivation, or these sorts of problems. So let's not cloud the waters, eh? You know that your behaviour is more than just quirky right now - don't you? Your quirks - my God, Sherlock - I love your quirks...I don't want to ever see those be lost! If you want to get Chinese at 2 in the morning, while discussing a locked room mystery? I'm game. You want to completely rewrite the rules of Cluedo, or do science experiments in the microwave or riddle the fridge with things that really shouldn't be there? - and I can't believe I am saying this, really - but I LOVE that about you. Therapy isn't about taking those interests away, or those peculiarities or differences away. I never want to see you be just like everyone else. I love what makes you different...don't you know that?''
Sherlock's gaze floated over the little canisters of cream. 18% plain. 18% Irish Creme. 18% Hazelnut.
What I thought was quite a bit of anxiety on the train turns out to be a pale reflection of what I was to come to see, evidently.
Because I had a violin tutor when I was small. And my tutor very likely saved my life. He was the only adult I really trusted. He was warm, and he was kind.
''Shut up!,'' Sherlock suddenly yells in anguish, eyes wild and whole body taut like a bow that's been pulled back just a little too much.
I can calm a person whose been shot, sure. I can help set a bone, or get a soldier through the pain of re-popping in a dislocated shoulder. I can even deal with screaming and tears and excessive displays of pain when the pain is physical... But I'm not used to pain of this nature. And it is of a different nature. It seems less clinical, harder to name, harder to speak about. Harder to think about. It shouldn't be. The stigma of if partly lies in the fact that no one even wants to comprehend that such events occur.
