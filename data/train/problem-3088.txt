Suddenly the power shifted and I could taste his sadness on my tongue. Dean noticed the trembling in my body. He glanced between Castiel and myself before turning and stomping determinedly down the hall toward the lab.
Fresh tears coursed down my cheeks as realization dawned. I'd stuffed the truth so far down under all the killing and drinking. My best friend was dead. I'd gotten him killed because I couldn’t get my head out of my ass and say that I was thankful he was around. To tell him how sorry I was that I use him to compensate for my own lack of self-confidence.
“Oh my God, I am so happy to see you!” she burst, her hands shooting up to tangle in her mess of brown curls. “You have no idea how freaked out I’ve been!”
Castiel marveled at the way the hunter trembled under his touch. Wanting more of a reaction, the angel slid his other hand around to the small of Dean’s back and pulled him even closer. Like he hoped, the shivering became more apparent. Instinctually, Cas rolled his hips rubbing their cocks together. Dean was still too embarrassed to look at the blue eyes drinking him in and decided to hide in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder, letting out a low groan of pleasure.
“That’s fair,” Castiel said, when his laughter ebbed, “In that case, let me redo my metaphorical biography. Castiel Novak, reader, bee-enthusiast, aspiring writer, and a recently fell out-of-the-closet-on-my-face gay twenty-three-year-old.”
There was something familiar about the voice, but Cas couldn’t quite put his finger on it. The voice was too muffled by the walls.
Dean tried to remember to take it slow, that Castiel was still relatively inexperienced, and had only one person on his list. Something white hot and electric pulsed down his arms at the thought of the other person, April, the reaper touching Castiel in this way, getting to taste the purity of his kiss.

“You create your own prisons,” Castiel said wearily, “You make everything your sole responsibility. You create situations that force you into a state of mental isolation. Usually then you only rely on those closest to you, if they aren’t the ones you are hiding from. I just don’t know what I did that made you believe I wasn’t one of those you could take into your confidence.
It’s irrational that a fully clothed photo of his first love, who he hadn’t spoken to, let alone seen, in the past five years, distract him from the half-naked gorgeous body of his most recent ex who, in no uncertain terms, wants to rekindle a relationship that he had been sad to see end.
And Castiel had done enough work on himself to understand that he could love her, and still crave and seek a different connection.
The brothers were in Dean’s room. Dean on his couch, staring at Cas’ lifeless body and Sam standing in the doorway.
That’s what happened when you lived in a small, long-term psychiatric care facility where entertainment was limited – news travelled fast, and gossip travelled faster. He had heard the new name buzzing for about a week before the medical vehicle had lazily crested the hill at the edge of the center’s property early one Saturday morning. Castiel watched the van’s lazy descent as the sun rose, coating the sky in a soft, warm light.
“May I?” Dean asked, unsure as to where the sudden confidence came from but glad that he had it. Castiel looked at him intently, and then nodded once.
“So, Jack would be left solely with the Nephilim powers but none of the God juice,” Sam concluded, eyes wide.
“You make me feel so many things, Dean,” Castiel eventually said, gently squeezing his fingers with his own. “For so long, I didn’t feel anything. I felt like I was a
Castiel knew this, and his heart broke because of it. He couldn’t begin to fathom what Dean was going through. And he knew no matter how much work Dean had done, how much he had improved himself, his
“As her roommate, that is a very frightening idea,” Hannah chuckled. Castiel smiled politely. He could tell Hannah was reaching for more conversation, trying to draw out this time they were spending together. Castiel could feel her eyes on his face as he kept staring at the van.
Meg must have started a pot when they got home because the coffee was already brewed. He opened the cupboard and grabbed two mugs, filling them as Gabriel rummaged through the cupboard for snacks.
Castiel felt sleep tugging him under. Even when he went with it, however, he slept fitfully and couldn’t seem to make the final plunge into restful sleep.
He surveyed the living room, and when he was one hundred percent sure that Cas had cleared out, he shuffled in. He definitely did not tiptoe across the room. Definitely not. He is not a child avoiding punishment.
Castiel just kept staring at Dean’s bed, not even bothering with his book anymore, which lay forgotten on his pillow. As the clock trudged closer to three, Castiel couldn’t take it anymore. He jumped from where he was seated and started making Dean’s bed. As he straightened out the sheets and fluffed the pillows, he realized that it was very likely that Dean would come back to the room during the visitation hours. Amara didn’t usually stay for the full hour and a half, and Dean knew Castiel would be out of the room. Following this thought, he walked over to where his notebook lay and tore out a piece of paper on which he wrote:
Dean entered the room and dropped his bags on the bed that had remained empty for the past six weeks.
It hadn’t even been twenty-four hours. Castiel was being dramatic. He understood that. But he still felt deflated. Like he had failed Dean, somehow. Maybe pushing him away was the wrong thing. Dean had just not seemed like himself; he had seemed almost
“The fuck are you talking about? Of course I’m doing this, it doesn’t matter if I’ll be safe or not!”
“Cas?” Gabriel asked quietly and Castiel exhaled, finally grabbing Meg’s hand and using the momentum to pull himself up.
“Yes, I am sure you can. But, you do have your injuries, and I was told to take you to the loading dock in this wheelchair.”
Dean watched the interested eyes and was a little touched to see that all those eyes also held genuine concern, but he couldn’t talk to them. Not right now. He could barely force himself to eat right now, to think or breathe regularly.
Missouri walked in and greeted everyone as she took her seat. She told Jody that she had the floor, and she could start whenever she was ready. Castiel nodded at her when she looked up at the crowd with visibly shaking hands.
Dean looked at him, really looked at him, trying to make sense of his words. Cas must have noticed his expression because his face lit up with a soft smile.
“Well, yes and no,” Jack answered moving to stand over Cas. Dean watched as Jack placed two fingers to Cas’ temple.
“I just uh… I did something while you were away. Two things. And one I hope wasn’t overstepping, and the second one I hope you don’t find cringey.”
Dean was pretty sure he would have collapsed onto the floor if Cas wasn’t grounding him. He still did end up swaying unsteadily. Cas reached behind himself and pulled the visitors chair closer, right next to Sam’s unresponsive face. Cas gently pushed Dean’s shoulder down, and Dean followed the movement, dropping heavily onto the uncomfortable seat. His eyes never left Sam, but he squeezed Cas’ hand in thanks. Cas placed his other hand at the nape of Dean’s neck, gently carding through his hair.
Castiel ached to grab him, hold him. But he didn’t know what Dean wanted. What he needed. He wasn’t even sure what he was doing here. The last time he was like this, Missouri had made him stay in the
“I couldn’t make sense of it, Dean. I had died and come back. I had nowhere to sleep, to eat, and you told me to leave. You said…”
“Okay, well, maybe tell her tomorrow, see if it is something they can manage. Maybe they just need to change the dosage or the brand,” Castiel stood up and gently ran a hand through Dean’s hair. Dean leaned into the touch.
Cas observes Dean, his gaze fixed on where he had touched. A realisation clicks in his head, prompting a small sigh, “I apologise.” He starts, “Breast tenderness is a common symptom-“
“Hey Sammy.” Dean says in a cheery tone, he approaches Sam who doesn’t respond at first and looks over his shoulder, “Whatcha readin’?” He then plonks himself down and looks over to some of the various papers strewn about the table.
“Castiel.” Naomi turns to look at the angel with a distant fondness. Adorned in a grey suit, with hair sheet white. “I couldn’t detect you for a while. However, I was reassured by one of your former garrison-mates that you might be,” Her eyes narrow, “
“Unfortunately it is one of the “joys of pregnancy”.” Cas uses air quotes, cracking a weak smile from Dean, “Although I don’t understand what could possibly be joyous about morning sickness.”
The voices then converged, one angelic chorus, “A Nephilim has been conceived on earth. They must be found and
A strange heave of emotion grips at Cas’ throat. It’s suffocating. His mouth can’t seem to stay in coherence with his mind.
“I just – I wanted us to have clean clothes before the kid gets here. Less work for later.” Is the answer, more a shy whisper than a defence.
Just a little side note with this story - which I forgot to mention in the last chapter - this story is an alternate canon to supernatural season 12, so I've kept Cas' wings and a vague connection between him and heaven that is stronger than in season 12. Purely for plot reasons but also because I love Cas' wings :)
He thinks, his heart fluttering forcefully against his chest. Cas is willing to give up his angelic identity for him
The unhappy churning starts to rise in Dean’s throat causing him to hold back a gag. He pulls away, making Cas stir.
“It was fine,” Dean says, gently easing himself down onto the chair beside Sam. In recent weeks, his stomach has grown from ‘plausibly deniable beer-gut’ to ‘full-on-bump’. “A little busy, but we were in and out of there pretty fast. The entire time Cas looked like he was going to smite the next person that gave me a side eye.” He considers his bump for a moment, feeling a flutter of movement from within, unaware of the observing eyes.
“Stop right there Cas.” Dean finally pipes up; his features hard as anger starts to boil in the place of his shock. He turns to face Sam, meeting with his brother’s bewilderment, “Another time Sammy. Bigger fish to fry here!” His voice cracks, but he holds the tone, scolding Sam like a young child.
They stay like that for moment. Cas rubbing Dean back with one hand while the other stays firmly on his stomach. He mutters some kind words of sympathy as Dean just melts further into the stool. Which is growing increasingly more uncomfortable.
“I must go Dean.” His tone hardening only slightly, “Trusting Lucifer is one thing,” he thumbs at Dean’s stomach, “but, ensuring he’s right, is another.” The hunter nods slowly, loosening his arms. “We can shop for new jeans together when I get back.” Cas whispers against Dean’s temple before pulling away from their embrace.
“Run is a strong word Cas.” Dean chuckles, “I can barely walk around right now.” He adds with a wince, repositioning himself on the stool.
“Hello boys.” Her usual tone twinges with a hint more excitement than usual. “I see you’re in quite the predicament. Aunty Rowena can help.” She croons in a sickening sweet tone. “And congrats darlin’.” She adds, with pointed smirk towards Dean’s stomach.
So sorry for the slow uploads, this fic is a little harder than I was expecting to write, but I'm starting to get my mojo back and i've got a bit more time on my hands so hopefully more chapters soon (but don't expect them right away, it takes a little time)
Dean is whisked off the infirmary. Sam hooking his arm under Dean’s to steady him through the hallway. They pause halfway there, as Dean grits his teeth against another strong pain.
It's been a month since getting Cas back and they still haven't found a warding against heaven and Sam is greeted by an old enemy.
happening.” He echoes, his other hand absently pulling the hem of Dean’s shirt up to rest on his abdomen. It’s only a small bump that cups perfectly in his palm. Dean groans in protest at the sentiment, but, feeling too defeated, he just leaves the angel be.
That earnt a long sigh and fallen look, “While I was away I considered this possibly,” He starts not focusing on either of the expectant eyes boring into him, “I am willing to surrender my grace while Dean’s gestation period progresses. I want to stay with both Dean and the Nephilim. I have been human before and I do not mind being human again to stay present.”
“We’ll try to be quick. It’ll only be a couple of hours. You’ll manage.” Sam chuckles lightly. “And who knows? Maybe can give you some advice.” He shrugs before walking towards Cas.
Dean feels his cheeks heat up as he looks between Sam and Cas. He’s missing something. “Seriously, is no one going to tell me what the hell is-“
“A Nephilim pregnancy varies depending on the evolution of the human baring the child.” Cas turns to Dean, whose eyes dart quickly away, settling on the edge of the infirmary cot instead, “I suspect your pregnancy will last 40 weeks, as per the gestational period for humans. There have only been a handful of Nephilim born since their banning a millennia ago, so I am unclear on the details.”
“It is totally normal at this late stage, for you to feel the need to prepare for the impending birth of our child.” Cas croons in his sickeningly sweet tone.
Cas meets with his gaze, “I know.” He gravels, voice thick with sincerity, “You are not useless. But I can’t let you hurt yourself or our baby. You and this baby mean too much to me.” Cas’ expression is barely readable. A mixture of relief, concern, and adoration present. It’s a chaotic whirlwind of emotion so foreign on a celestial being’s face. Dean nods in silent understanding. He shouldn’t have gone out. But he did. “I should have stayed-“
Lucifer tuts, “This talk has been a real treat Sam, I really missed this you know. We should get together more often.” The sarcastic quip of his voice is really starting to piss Sam off. Despite the sour glare, he continues, “But our little chat isn’t the reason I came over. I’m looking for the dad- or should I say mommy-to-be Dean.”
“You’re killing me.” Dean whispers, interlocking them in another kiss. Cas kisses back passionately, placing a hand on Dean’s chest. A finger brushes lightly against his peck. Suddenly, Dean recoils from the kiss, a wild look present in his eyes. The touch, although gentle,
“Come on.” Dean begs, laying on his back and sucking in a sharp breath. He groans as he tries to button up his pants over his stomach. “God damn it!” He growls.
Even seeing the angel now, walking down the stairs of the bunker, Dean gets to truly be in awe. Cas’ gentle hand brushes up against the small of Dean’s back. Heat emits from the touch, it only lasts a second, but the hunter gathers that feeling and revels in its reassuring nature. He flashes the angel a smile, considering his eyes for a moment. The beautiful blue, gleaming impossibly more in the harsh lighting. Maybe that had something to do with the grin his features hold so perfectly. Even so, Cas was so God damn attractive. Dean tries to battle the blush that threatens to streak across his face, but to no avail. He can feel his face heat up as he looks away.
“Thank God.” Dean relaxes at that, “And give me all the good stuff.” He adds with a little bit more of a forceful heave. Cas eyes him wearily as he lowers himself back down into a nearby chair.
“Nothing is joyous about it.” Dean muses: head still perched on the seat. He grimaces at the smell of his residual meals, prompting Cas to lend himself for Dean to lean onto.
“Well, Rowena has given us the aiding spell to help with general pain relief.” Cas concludes, continuing the conversation as if Dean isn’t going rigid next to him. Sam nods along at that, typing something on his laptop. Is he taking notes? “But we haven’t discussed positions or location.”
because either of you two douche-nozzles told me to.” Just to sweeten the deal, he yawns right on que.
“Can I go back to sleep?” Cas nods silently, his hand returning to its post on Dean’s stomach. The small flutters continue under his palm. Dean nods and nuzzles back into his pillow with a smile.
“For now?” How do they not realise how insane they sound? “But what happens when he-what if he-“ This is too much, Dean can feel panic ebb in his chest. What if lucifer gets to the Nephilim? Will he hurt it? Kill it? He pales slightly at the thought. Cas places a hand on the small of his back. He hovers his head over Dean’s shoulder.
There is a silence, the phone static growing louder for a few moments. Sam can hear some muttering or whispering but decides not to pry. “Honestly? It’s sounding like it could be a demon. The time between murders fits, so does the consistent possession. If it is, that’s bad news considering we are kind of a magnet for the supernatural right now.” Sam’s bones chill at that. He hadn’t thought about what semi-local demons could mean for Dean or even-
find something Dean. Come on-” Sam stops, hearing the soft patter of footsteps. Dean’s ears perk up and a smile curls on his lips. Sam bites back a chuckle and gives the older hunter a knowing look as Dean meets with his gaze again.
“No Dean. I had thought about it as well.” Now it is Dean’s turn to be surprised. It is his turn to consider Cas’ face. The angel is serene. He continues as his gaze travels to the darkening sky, “I knew that I loved you when I felt your soul in hell. The secondary intimate feelings developed over time.”
He exits the bathroom and slowly plods his way to the entrance. As graceful as he can with his large stomach, he attempts to tip-toe towards the voices as they become increasingly louder. Hiding behind one of the bookshelves in the library, he tries to get a better look.
But, instead of yelling his response, or acting out, the comment makes Dean straighten up. His slouching position is shifted to lean more against the table. And he takes his hands off his back, “Bite me.” He practically growls.
In a way that was far more urgent than sexy, Castiel gripped the bottom of Dean’s shirt and ripped it over his head before pushing him flat onto his back. He fell forward, ungracefully, and attached himself to Dean’s neck, licking a long stipe before gently grazing his teeth over it. Not enough to leave a mark, but enough to threaten one. As Castiel continued kissing the column of his throat, all that was flashing in his mind was one word, an echo in his brain:
“Saw John hurt you?” The anger that had flared inside Castiel flamed higher, burned hotter, but he tried to keep his voice neutral and calm. This was not about him.
Cas gave him a questioning look, and when Bobby made eye contact with him in the rearview mirror, he rolled his eyes playfully.
“Anytime, Cas,” Dean said happily, and then shifted so that he was lying on his side, so he could look at Cas, “Really. Anytime.”
Sam wiped his hand down his face, trying to think of the best thing to do for his brother. Dean was unnaturally quiet in the back seat. Sam killed the engine and climbed out, opening the door for Dean, who was cradling his injured hand.
“She’s worse than the most annoying alarm clock sound I’ve ever heard,” Dean groaned as he rolled his neck.
Dean gripped Castiel’s hips firmly, his finger’s splaying over his lower back, “Someone’s confident tonight.”
But Cas wanted to say thank you, wanted to mend this rift between them, or at the very least, diffuse the unbelievable tense and awkward energy that seemed to filter into every single interaction.
, and the mere thought of burying his brother, the brother he is supposed to protect, made Dean’s body shake uncontrollably as his vision darkened and his lungs seized.
“It makes perfect sense to me. You were forced to grow up when you were very young, so you liked the story of a boy who never had to,” he said as he slipped into bed. Dean immediately clung onto him, resting his head in the juncture of his neck.
Trigger and Content Warnings: shock, mentions of a housefire and mentions of minor character off screen death.
The questions and thoughts that haunted him all these years, at those rare moments he let himself think about Cas, were now burning to be freed, ready to demand answers. But Dean wasn’t sure if he would get them, even if he asked. And Dean really wasn’t sure if he was ready to
Dean grinned devilishly, leaning in so that Castiel could feel his breath ghosting along the shell of his ear as he whispered, “Cas, not for nothing, but the last time someone looked at me like that...I got laid.”
“I’ll get it ready,” Sam volunteered, grabbing the dream root from Jack and then walking up to Cas and plucking a hair from his head.
Dean was sleeping in the visitors chair next to Sam’s bed, the chair he was sure was responsible for his spine contorting itself into a fucking pretzel, when Sam’s voice broke through the hazy gauze of unconsciousness.
They had a couple of round table meetings and discussions, but everyone seemed pretty on board with the idea. Dean had a couple of one-on-one discussions with Meg too. The animosity of their youth was not something either of them had forgotten, but it was something they both wanted to move past. At first, it was only because they both knew how important the other was to Cas, but eventually, they realized they actually had a lot in common, and slowly, they started developing a hard-won but deeply valued friendship.
Dean took a deep breath and, following the same instinct that had had him cupping Cas’ cheek earlier, got up from the bed and dropped to his knees in front of Cas, planting his arms on either side of Cas’ lap. Dean looked up at him, “And I should have said it years ago, I know that … I know that now, but I didn’t know how to say it, or when to say it. Even after everything… after everything we’d been through, I couldn’t find the courage… I could hardly admit it to myself. I could not admit that I needed you, that I wanted you around, wanted to love you and be loved by you. But, I can now. I understand now.  Castiel, I love you. Of course, I love you man. You mean everything to me Cas, everything. And I would die for you and I would live for you. And I’m sorry that I never said it before. I’m sorry that you died three times without having heard it. But I’m saying it now. I’m so stupidly, irrationally and probably co-dependently in love with everything you are.”
“So, you weren’t lying, huh?” Dean whispered after he walked to Cas’ side. Cas popped open one eye and smiled at Dean as he lowered himself onto the bench beside Cas.
“Well. Every weekday. One of the psychologists leads them. Some days it's Pamela, other days it's Missouri. And it’s not therapy in the way you think. It’s more like discussions: sharing of fears and the like, coping mechanisms, et cetera. And, when you reach the midpoint of your program, you share your life story."
He knew Dean was very tactile, found physical touch to be very reassuring, very calming. And for a second there, Dean seemed to lean into the touch. But suddenly, he became very rigid. He jumped upright, as if he had touched an exposed wire, the movement rapid and unexpected. Castiel stumbled backwards a bit as he lost his balance.
He stared at the ceiling as the light started streaming in from the window. He couldn’t find the energy to drag himself out of bed, to walk to his garden bench, to start the day as if everything was alright. He glanced over to the other bed in the room, unmade and completely empty, as it had been the whole night.
“I feel different, something feels wrong. There’s this sadness inside me, this dark feeling. And I don’t know when it’s gonna rear its head. I don’t feel like me. I don’t want Sam to see me like that.” The truth cost him something; he felt a wave of exhaustion threaten to crash over him.
“Yeah, look, the man was flawed, obviously. And damaged. But I knew how to manage him, deal with him.”
I just wanted to let you all know that this story will be concluding next week. I will be uploading the final chapter on Saturday and the Epilogue on Sunday.
“Yeah, a lot of fucked up shit happened that I haven’t dealt with. So now, as a reflex, I deal with things in the wrong way. And I have this unpredictable anger that lives right underneath the surface… I’m not where I need to be yet. It wouldn’t be possible after only two months.”
Dean groaned, and his hand stilled on Castiel’s back, his palm flattening out to splay possessively over the expanse of skin as he drew Castiel closer still.
The original hug scene in this chapter was inspired by a Misha Collins Cameo that has been circulating on TikTok. In it, he was asked what he would have liked for the Dean and Cas reunion. His response was that he would have liked to have seen "the most authentic and loving hug".
“You are good, Dean. A good human. And I don’t think you are without flaws, nor do I think you haven’t made mistakes. But I can tell that you, at your core, are a wonderful person, a righteous man. And you have made me feel things I did not know I would be able to feel, things I’d never thought I’d get the luxury to experience. Being around you makes me happy. Getting to know you makes me happy.”
“Please eat,” Castiel said. “If you are not scarfing a borderline ludicrous amount of food, it makes me very uncomfortable.”
Dean downed the last of his coffee, grabbed Cas by the arm and fell back onto the couch, dragging the angel with him.
The darkness was bleeding inwards. In seconds, his vision would be completely gone. He felt Sam grab the wheel from him more than he saw it, felt the car veer off the road into a field. He pulled the car door open and fell out before the Impala had fully come to a rest – needing space, needing air. He hit the ground hard, the momentum propelling him forward and he could feel his shoulder screaming in protest as it popped out of place when he rolled straight into a tree.
. Castiel didn’t want any of what happened with their physical relationship to be tainted with the distress they were working through in their own lives, not when it was so new.
“Let’s make some coffee,” Sam said running a hand through Jack’s hair, the kid smiling fondly “and then we will tell you everything.”
Dean reached up and softly ran the pad of his thumb just above Castiel’s left eyebrow. Dean’s finger left a warm trail in its wake, small flames licking at his skin. Castiel forgot how to breathe.
“You’re God now, can’t you just wake him up?” Dean asked, desperation turning the edges in voice sharper than he had intended.
“Like all my potential,” Dean said as he tried to pull his lips into one of his cocky smiles in an effort to ease the tension that felt like it was pulsing in the room.
She spoke of how she got better. How, thanks to her colleague and friend, Donna, she started coming back to the real world. And, even though she occasionally had severe depressive episodes that consisted of days of staring at empty bedroom walls, she was, more or less, herself again.
Castiel tried to will the blush to leave his face. He did not know how to talk about Dean, how to be candid about something he had been told for so long he needed to hide, to bury.
Sam left the room briefly to combine the ingredients with the dream root. When he came back with a glass full of the concoction, Dean’s stomach recoiled at the memory of the taste. But he reached out and downed the whole thing in one swallow.
“I didn’t feel like I had to do anything,” Sam interrupted. “Dean, you always put me first. Your whole life. And I knew– after I saw him hit you, I knew you had protected me not only from experiencing that, but from having to live through
Dean spent most of the morning deflecting Cas’ questions about his plans for their open session. He wanted it to be a surprise, so he avoided answering these interrogations through his stealthy skills of deflection and redirection. Cas was getting entertainingly frustrated and continually made huffed sounds of exasperation which Dean pointedly ignored. He secretly loved it though.
“Jack!” Sam called so enthusiastically that he started choking on the turkey bacon. He was out of his chair and wrapping the kid – or god now – in a bear hug, still slightly coughing. Sam clapped him on the back affectionately, and Jack looked up at him, an innocent sort of affection radiating from him.
Castiel knew that they should probably rejoin the others in the main hall, that Dean should be getting back to the fishbowl, that he needed to get to his room and finish the assignment. He knew, but didn’t care.
It took him a second to realize that this had to be Dean Winchester. And, another second to realize that Dean Winchester wasn’t breaking eye-contact. Castiel smiled slowly, and the other man returned the gesture with his own grin and then winked at him.
of people, the sounds of life and chatter making a house a home, well, Dean would be lying if he said that it didn’t appeal to him on a fundamental level.
“One month,” Dean said as he hugged Jack again. Eileen, Sam and Cas followed suit and all gave the young god farewell-for-now hugs.
“You look more cognizant,” Castiel observed as Dean walked out of the bathroom. Dean flashed him what he hoped was a winning grin, but it felt more like a grimace.
Dean’s memory gap was not a secret, but it was one of those topics that no one ever mentioned. At her words, all the quiet early morning conversation fell into silence and four pairs of rounded eyes stared back at him. Dean’s mouth dried out and swallowing suddenly became very difficult.
. Other things could include the wedding, the honeymoon, Sam and Cas' book discussions, their trip to Dodge City... anything :) If this is something you would like to read please let me know in the comments or you can message me on tumblr
Stevie shot him a look and then nodded again sharply. “Apparently he is asking for Amara. Is she close by?... Okay…. Yeah… I’ll let him know.”
Bobby explained that when Sam was originally hospitalized, and for the seven weeks thereafter, he was in a vegetative, unresponsive state. However, in the last two weeks, his level of consciousness began to increase slightly, and had officially moved into what the doctor classified
. Look, you don’t have to talk to me about it, but you should talk to someone. You haven’t looked this… I don’t know… out of it? Not since I’ve met you. And given where we are…”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted. The name tasted strange on his tongue. He hasn’t spoken it in years. The word hurt his throat.
“Aren't there things you’d like to say to him? I know I don’t know the full story, I wasn’t there, but I know some, and I know how you shut off completely when Sam mentions his name... I don’t know. I guess I just get the feeling that there were a lot of things left unsaid between the two of you.”
Now, it just sat in a box in Dean’s room, a forgotten monument to the most tragic love story of his life.
Cas nodded, “Well, I accept the olive branch, and I would love to keep you company. As long as you tell me all about your time in Dublin in return.”
“Cas,” Dean whispered in between kisses until he pulled back to look into his eyes, “I’ll get you back to me.”
“Are you ready for this?” Castiel asked when they settled into one of the couches in the visitors room.
“Castiel. I am sorry that this isn’t very romantic. I am sorry that I do not have a grand gesture or a beautifully thought-out speech. But now, when you were here in my arms, I just realized that I never want to be without you again. I am so fucking in love with you Cas and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to wake up with you every morning and raise a family with you. I want you Cas, all of you in whatever way I can have you. And I don’t want to wait a second longer than is necessary. If we can get some papers sorted out and believe me I will move heaven and hell to do so. Will you please marry me?”
“I just knew once you got out, it would take a while before you had time to put your focus there. But I didn’t like the idea of him being able to get to you or to Sam during his recovery time. And if you are amenable, Billie can start with the application for a
Secondly, the country where I live is having a really bad wave of COVID-19 at the moment, so I've been in isolation for over a week now due to exposure (but thankfully, it seems that I did not catch it). This did, however, leave me with a lot of time to write. So today, as it is about halfway through the story, I am going to do a duel update. I'm posting Chapter 7 now and will be posting chapter 8 later today.
“Last night, it was, uhm, the first time you’ve touched me in a while. Or like, initiated any physical contact,” Castiel knew his face would be glowing at this point, but Dean was in his bed and he just had to know.
“Yeah, actually,” Castiel turned to look at him, “It felt almost purifying. It’s like I’ve spent my whole life carrying this decay on my soul and pretending it wasn’t there. And today, I finally acknowledged it. That’s the first step, I guess. Admitting there was something that needed addressing.”
“Get dressed,” Cas whispered against the shell of his ear. It was the exact opposite of what Dean wanted to do.
Dean was just about to say that to Sam when he heard a thundering crash and a startled shout coming from Cas’ room.
“Hey, sweetheart, you miss me?” Dean grinned down at Cas. Cas nodded quickly and pulled Dean closer, crushing their lips together.
Dean was trying to remain calm. He was clinging to the thing that had shuttered his mind for so long. Castiel could feel the tension rolling off him in waves.
There were these seedy-looking tiny apartment clusters that were less than half the price. The place, however, at best, looked like the illegitimate love child of an
In the past three weeks, both Adam and Hannah were discharged. Both instances had been very emotional.
“Okay,” Missouri said kindly, but firmly, “You mentioned that he was a mean drunk. Why don’t you tell me more about that?”
“Okay, luckily, this is something that we can do quite easily,” Dean said instead of agreeing with Sam.
“You will not like my answer,” Amara warned as she leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and interlinked her hands. “But the basic and most straightforward answer I can give you is that your brother was not my patient – you were.”
“The accident? You caused it?” Castiel asked, the cold feeling intensifying, his blood turning into ice in his veins.
What neither of them realized, as they both dipped into unconsciousness wrapped up in each other, was that their lives, in fact, would actually become increasingly complicated in a couple of hours, when Dean would wake sweating and gasping for air.
“I remember,” Dean said hurrying out of the bed, scrambling as he tripped over the belongings scattered on the floor, “I remember everything.”
Dean’s grip tightened and he made a breathy noise that Castiel had never heard before, but immediately wanted to hear again.
“Well, it’s been nearly thirty hours since you came back to the bunker. So, I imagined you would be starving when you woke up.”
It would be easier if Cas, at least, felt some of what he did. It was cruel, and selfish and unfair. He never wants Cas to be in pain, not really, but the fact that he was alone in all this hurt and confusion and sadness –-
They would have a cat that he named Catstiel. Dean would wear a ring Cas had bought for him. They would have two kids. Dean would cook, and Cas would clean. They would fuck almost every night. Sometimes it would be fast and dirty, the kind of sex that ended with Dean biting into his shoulder, marking Cas as
They half collapsed against each other, both breathing heavily, and Cas had to fight the urge to lick Dean’s spend off his fingers.
Thirdly, the next three chapters are going to be quite heavy, and some things may seem confusing, but, if I did my job right, it will all come together (aggressively hopes I did my job right.) This is the climax of the story and it will take three chapters for it all to be worked out. Please check trigger warnings in the end notes. And please remember that this story does have a happy ending :)
So, all in all, most parts of his days were spent in the company of a lot of other people, which meant that Cas and Dean only ever spent the last hours of the nights alone together. And in those moments, they spoke about everything. They spoke of things as delightfully dull as the weather, and then, they spoke of the things that Dean never thought he would be able to voice – the blanket of night seemed to infuse their room with a warm sense of safety.
Cas’ eyes dulled a little, the joy and relief fading from his gaze. And Dean wanted to stop himself. He really did. He wanted to stop the venomous words suddenly exploding in his head, fighting their way forward. But he could not stop. And he was tired. He was tired of fighting the feelings. Tired of trying to control his emotions and thoughts.
“He drank a lot. I don’t have many memories of him sober. He wasn’t a happy or charming drunk. He was loud and destructive and… yeah, look, he was violent.”
Dean made sure to voice this to Sam again before the conversation turned to his honeymoon. Sam and Eileen decided to do a road trip through some of rural Ireland. Sam spoke animatedly for a while, and Dean was genuinely happy to hear his brother sound so blissful.
“Come here,” Dean gathered Cas close in his arms. Cas started fidgeting with the amulet around Dean’s neck.
The dinner went alright. The food was edible, mostly, and conversation was stunted but continuous. All in all, Cas would count it as a win. They talked about work; Dean had served two tours after college before finally settling back in the US. He’s been working as a firefighter for the past three years. Cas was happy that Dean managed to follow that dream; it was something he always wanted to do. He’s very close to two of his colleagues, Garth and Victor. Sam just got married. He’d just finished his undergrad a couple of weeks ago and was set to start law school when the summer was over. Dean spoke of his new sister-in-law, Eileen, very fondly.
He’s spent more than one-thousand, eight-hundred and fifty-two days trying to forget everything that was assaulting his senses now. The way Dean sounded, the way he looked, the way he smelled (because of course the scent of that familiar aftershave already permeated the room). It was too much, too painful to relive. He wasn’t ready. He wasn’t prepared for how visceral his reaction would be.
“Sam,” Dean interrupted, “It’s okay. I’ve told you this. You were half out of your mind with grief.”
Jody smiled a little brokenly, “When I had finished signing in, she looked me dead in the eye and told me ‘Jody, you’re not the things you are telling yourself you are. And you deserve to be helped’. Alex and Donna have come to every visitation. And I know now that I want to get better. For them. But also for myself.”
“That’s because it isn’t a no,” Cas said softly. He moves so that he is sitting up right. Dean follows suit and soon the two are looking directly into the other’s eyes.
Dean rubbed his forehead as he felt his throat tightening. Cas, with the hand that was holding Dean’s, slowly swiped across the pulse point in his wrist.
Dean rolled his eyes and tried to close the door, but Cas jammed his foot in the doorway and threw his weight against the door, forcing it open. “Oh, no you don’t.”
“Okay, I’m not comfortable talking about Dean when he isn’t here,” he started. Cas was about to interrupt Sam, but the younger Winchester held up his hand to cut Cas off, “but I think you need to know this.”
Dean grabbed him by the back of the neck and aligned their mouths again. Dean licked Cas’ bottom lip before teasing his tongue at the seam of Cas’ mouth. Cas gasped, and Dean’s teeth immediately closed over Cas’ bottom lip.
They worked non-stop for that week, sleeping in shifts but mostly staying awake from a seemingly endless supply of caffeine. And, although the work was difficult and slow, by the end of the week they had an actual plan. They knew a potion that could get one of them into the Empty and a symbol that could be used on a life force within the Empty that would enable passage back outside. The only thing they were struggling with, the last piece of the puzzle, was how they would actually find Cas once someone was within the inner boundaries of the Empty. Last time Cas had been in, when he went to find Ruby, the Empty had specifically woken Ruby up. Considering that they did not want to wake the Empty up again or let it know what they were doing, this was not an option this time around. Dean was happy with only two thirds of a plan, and Sam was sure that if he hadn’t stopped his older brother he would have barreled in already.
“Dean, avoiding talking about and thinking about your issues may reduce your worries and fears in the short run, but it does you no favors in the long run. Avoiding it and burying it only maintains the fear, the feelings of powerlessness, and prolongs your difficulty forming attachments outside of the trauma-bonded relationship you share with your brother. It prevents healing as it stops you from adequately processing what happened.”
She was crying heavily at this point, and Castiel found that he, himself, was unable to hold back the occasional tear that fell down his face. Dean had grabbed his hand before the first drop of water dripped onto his shirt.
“We spoke about my dad. In therapy, yesterday. And some things came up that I had pushed down. Well, a lot came up.” Dean pushed himself up, so that he was sitting against the headboard.
Not that Dean would want to rekindle it if he was given the choice. Not really. Cas leaving him broke something in him he’s spent the last five years desperately trying to fix.
“I am embarrassingly aware of when you touch me. I just wanted to know why.” Castiel dropped his eyes to his knees, not daring to look at Dean.
As he headed towards his room, hoping Castiel was still there so they could walk to the cafeteria together (due to his little episode, he had missed lunch and he as fucking
“No Dean I am being dead serious, you’re scaring me, whenever you lose Cas you become reckless… suicidally reckless… and I can’t just sit…” Sam inhaled sharply. The sound caught Dean’s attention, and he focused his gaze on his brother’s face, which was pulling tight.
“Well, what do you have so far?” Dean asked, inelegantly popping two pieces of bacon into his mouth simultaneously.
This was originally supposed to be a rather short and silly fic but I seem incapable of leaving angst behind lol. And this chapter is actually the longest chapter I have ever written. Sometimes stories just develop a mind of their own.
“Dean,” the woman interrupted, “It was a car accident, and as I mentioned earlier, your brother wasn’t in the car. It was you and your father in the car.”
Fifty-one years later, on a Thursday, Dean Winchester took his last mortal breath. He died as he had lived… he died loved. Sam was on his right and Castiel was on his left and the room was teeming with his family, with his children and his grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Tears slipping down faces that had known and loved Dean for the entirety of his very long and very full life.
And then it just disappeared, dissolved. She had stepped right out after a letter from a university in Ireland arrived in her mailbox. They had discussed it, and came to the realization that long-distance wasn’t something either of them wanted or knew how to make work. They ended amicably enough, but Dean had not tried to stay in contact. Being near her without being with her was not a pain that he had been willing to self-inflict.
Cas moved on top of Dean again, pinning him in place with his hips. He ghosted his lips over Dean’s chest and neck before breathily whispering in the hunter’s ear,
“I’m sorry I haven’t come sooner, Sammy. I’m sorry that I told you I was coming back and only managed to do that almost nine weeks later.”
The visit was pleasant. The past hour and a bit had been better than Castiel could have hoped for. He hadn’t seen Gabriel in so long that he had been scared that their interaction would have been fraught with awkwardness, but they had fallen back into an easy pattern. Like, slipping into their old routines and patterns with the ease of sliding into a pair of well-worn slippers – something warm and familiar. They hadn’t spoken about anything serious and had avoided the elephant in the room completely: where they were, the hospital tags around Castiel’s wrist that bulged under the hoodie sleeve he kept low over his hands, the event that had led to this reunion. They spoke about everything, except that which was glaring at them.
Dean tried not to think of her anymore. Of Cassie. Of the first person who had held his heart. Who had held it tenderly, never ripping it apart the way he had become accustomed to. He had loved her with so few defenses , which he had known he should have had more of. His heart was a poorly scabbed-over mix of breaks and mismatched jigsaw pieces that needed protecting. But, something about her kindness, her
Just an illustration I had in my head! Wanted to get it done before I updated again to say thank you to all of you that left Kudos! I'm having a lot more fun with this story than I could have hoped so it means a lot. Love you all! Stay happy!
Our girl stood on her plastic crate, holding her sign and yelling about environmental devastation. Her dull grey socks were losing their elasticity and were slowly slipping unevenly toward her Birkenstock sandals. Today she wore what I can only describe as thin pantaloons that billowed with every breeze and ended at her knees. On top she had a fleece North Face vest and long sleeve shirt. Her knickknacks were still strapped all over her body on hemp cord (feathers, crystals, a couple bones) and she’d tucked her dreadlocks under a beanie. All in all, she legit looked like she was ready to sail on a pirate ship through marijuana fields.
She was taken aback. I wasn’t telling her to stay back or stay safe or anything like that. How could I anymore? She was an adult. Had been for a long time. Something Jody had figured out faster than me. No one could tell her what she could or couldn’t do.
We waited for Sam for about fifteen minutes as he spoke in hushed tones with Marina. Or at least tried to. She seemed close to catatonic from where I stood.
It took them most of the night and the next day to ride out to Jericho where Dean had tracked the person that had been tailing him. A town that sprouted up overnight about a decade ago as hundreds of people flooded the area searching for gold in the hills. It boasted close to one hundred people, a general store, hotel, church, and saloon. Perhaps not for much longer however; gold was running low and people were starting to leave.
Joel turned back to me with hope in his eyes. He knew that I was aware of all the details of the case so far, so I might be having the same idea as him.
“How’d she pass?” Dean asked, careful to keep his excited curiosity out of his voice. “If you don’t mind me asking?”
“Right,” Sam muttered, taking the key the man had placed on the counter. “He staying here or something?”
drunk mind. Blinking through the tilting haze that obfuscated the room, I focused in on the person that had caught my attention and drawn me out from the bottom of my heavily fingerprinted whiskey glass. Recognition cleared my muddled thoughts as blue eyes found my own.
“What do you want?” Castiel asked, breath hot against the kiss mark he’d left. “You said you wanted me…tell me how.”
I rolled down Baby’s windows and stuck my fist out so all the other hunters in the cars in the garage and on foot could see the signal. Revving Baby’s engine, I looked into the Empty and muttered to myself, “See you soon Cas.”
The Empty, where Cas was because of the genuine happiness he had experienced in living the truth. In being able to tell Dean…
This was the scared child who was forced to grow up far too soon, who grew up terrified and was taught that violence was the only response to emotions. The kid who always had to fight, scrounge and claw to keep himself safe, to keep his brother safe. This was someone who was deeply frightened, who never had someone to hold onto, who only ever relied on himself because it was the only way he survived. The only way they survived. The man who was taught to never let his vulnerability show, this was someone terrified and angry and torn up.
her so much, and he didn’t like that he was so completely dependent on her for any sense of belonging. He didn’t like the pressure that put on her, didn’t like how she was so obviously carrying the weight of that while pretending she wasn’t.
Jack held out the plant to Dean, face full of pride. Dean tried desperately to avoid thinking of how much Jack’s face resembled that of a puppy who had just learnt to play fetch. That would basically be blasphemous right?
Cas laughed softly and placed his arm around Dean’s shoulders, drawing him closer. Dean settled his head on Cas’ shoulder, reveling in how familiar it all felt. With his free hand, Cas twined his hand with Dean’s where it lay in his lap.
Cas grimaced; his talents have never extended to the kitchen. He wiped down the worst of the mess, but because he didn’t want the food getting cold, he settled for cleaning after.
He knew their story was over. Just because he held the memory of Cas as delicately as spun glass didn’t mean the memory would materialize into anything tangible.
“No, absolutely not,” Meg interrupted, “You are not starting this conversation now. Not when we have ten minutes left. If you two want to do the whole heart-to-heart thing, that’s great. But, we are not doing it in the last few moments I have with Castiel this week.”
“To be honest, I am far sleepier than I anticipated I would be,” Castiel admitted as he ran a hand through his hair.
Cas jumped up and stalked towards the door. The way his fists collided with the door was far more of a bang than a knock. He didn’t care.
Cas, however, has always had almost no survival instincts, so he’d pushed anyway. Whenever Dean was in the living area or kitchenette, he kept trying to get Dean to talk to him or, at the very least, acknowledge him. He tried to do this in a way that wouldn’t broadcast how obviously desperate Cas was to just interact with Dean. Which, naturally, he was ridiculously bad at, but Dean hadn’t paid enough attention to notice Cas’ desperation.
Furthermore, Dean fought the urge to grab said creamer and make Cas a cup of coffee. With two sugars.
“She’s not here, Dean. She doesn’t live on the property. It’s probably not a good idea anyway. Let’s get you back to the room. You can tell me what you remember, or I can call….”
“So, that’s what you were staring at this morning. I just thought you liked looking at me without a shirt on.” Dean winked. Cas blushed and bit his bottom lip.
“Well yeah, it was,” Dean said after his laughter died out, “but now, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need some time to just think about it, but I can’t because he’s
So I know this chapter is two days early, but I had a really stressful and shitty day and writing & posting make me feel better, so here we are!
“Dean… I can’t… This… this is one of the most thoughtful things anyone has ever done for me,” Cas' voice seemed to waver a bit. Dean finally turned to look at him. Cas’ eyes shone, his hands were fluttering at his sides, and he swallowed heavily.
I hope you all had a lovely week and that everyone is staying safe. Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos and comments on this fic, it is greatly appreciated. And just a general thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this :)
“Okay, I’ll give you an hour to get to him, but if you’re not back I’m coming in after you.” Dean sighed in frustration, but he did not have the time or the patience to try haggle with Sam now, so he just gave a quick nod.
“I’ll have Charlie bring you one of the center phones then, so you can call Mr. Singer,” she got up, and Dean watched as she straightened out her jacket.
Dean was mumbling, making noises of displeasure as he put on his shirt, grumbling as he started slowly sliding out of bed.
Cas sighed. “Honestly? It’s an olive branch and a thank you. I don’t like how uncomfortable things are between us right now. And you saved me earlier. I thought this was as good a gesture as any.”
his lips never leaving the stranger’s neck. Sam had waited outside on a bench near the vending machine with a chemistry book in his lap. When Dean arrived about thirty minutes later, he gently clapped the back of Sam’s head and told him to get into the car and that they had to go meet John in the next town over. Dean had said nothing but had given Sam a meaningful look. And Sam knew what it meant, “Don’t tell Dad. Don’t say anything.” So, he hadn’t, and Dean never brought it up again.
That reason being Dean’s shirt, the one he’d been using to sleep in for years, and a pair of Dean’s old sweatpants (he’s aware of how completely insane this is) were the only pajamas he’d packed, and there was just no reality in which he would allow Dean to see that. He’d have to dig around in his luggage to see if he had any plain t-shirts, and maybe boxers counted as enough clothing to not mess with Dean’s ‘no nudity’ rule.
"I'll go," he nods, as if that's what he expected Dean to say. Through the haze of half asleep, Dean tries to remember if he's ever ordered Cas away. He doesn't think so. He hopes not.
"Yeah, well, just because you don't doesn't mean you can't. That vessel's still got taste buds, right? Here." Dean steps away from the stove, free hand cupped below the wooden spoon to catch any drips, and hovers the spoon in front of Cas's mouth.
Cas frowns. He sits up but Dean grabs his arm before he gets too far away. "No, Cas, no, don't leave. You gotta give me more, not less. Give me more, Cas. I can't wait. I can't do it. You gotta get this outta me. C'mon we're close."
"You ship out when?" Dean asks, careful to keep his voice low. He inches close to Cas, fingers finding the button edge of his shirt and fiddling with it half unconsciously.
Actually, Dean started out following recipes on soup can labels for casseroles—anything compiled from canned goods was easy enough for a twelve year old, so long as they were staying some place with an oven. There had been long stretches of PB&J sandwiches and ramen noodles cooked on camp stoves, of course.
Castiel doesn’t go home. He longs to, but the risk of not being allowed to leave is too great. Instead, he purchases some essentials in the way of clothing and toiletries and takes up residence on Meg’s couch. He offers to get a hotel room, but she rolls her eyes and shoves a set of sheets into his chest and that had been the end of that discussion, as such.
His eyes are closed when Dean's gel-slicked hand wraps around his erection. It's a surprise, but such a pleasant one he doesn't startle. He moans in his enjoyment. Dean makes a fist and now with each move Castiel makes, he is overrun with double sensation of Dean in him, around him.
Dean was meant to escape Purgatory. He was not meant to surrender his life for an unworthy angel. Castiel will not accept Dean's sacrifice for his salvation.
"There's nothing 'regular' about this, though, is there? I mean, if there was, Cas could just angel him better and . . ." Sam's voice fades as Dean gets that sinky sleepy feeling. The pain's eased up enough that in seconds he's slipped too deep even to be curious about the rustling noise behind him.
"Right here, man." Dean runs a hand in short, steady strokes down Cas's shoulder. "You're okay. You're safe."
Sam stops with a chuckle midway through his turn toward the stairs. “You know, Dean used to say that about everything. ‘We’ll figure it out.’ Drove me nuts, like he was ignoring realities. But maybe, maybe he just had hope.”
Dean can't move. Or maybe he can, but he sure as fuck doesn't want to. Castiel dismounts on his own and settles in on his stomach along Dean's side, chin posted on his chest. Dean chuckles to himself tiredly—just when he gets the angel all clean, he goes and dirties him up again. He closes his eyes as he laughs, giving his body a minute to recover.
Dean sighs and supposes he would've gotten a phone call if Cas had gotten caught streaking a grocery store. He peeks around to where Cas is poking at the center of the pancake with a spatula. "Here, lemme see," he offers, taking the spatula. "Leave the middle alone. You gotta wait for the edges to get hard, and when the center part bubbles like that then you flip it." He loosens the pancake from the pan and hands the spatula back to Cas. "Try now."
As if somehow Dean knows this, has intuited it, his hand drifts down, smoothing over Castiel's shoulder, his chest, wrapping around his ribs to draw him near, press them together. Dean's mouth slides across Castiel's jaw, his lips leaving a trail, until he latches on to a spot just below and behind Castiel's ear. There is no logic here, no sound reason for why that kiss takes his breath and makes him buck, but it does.
“You can shove it.” Dean pushes the air with one hand and Sam flies off his feet, barreling backward into the dining room wall. “I’m not talking to you.”
"Okay, Cas. I know you're pissed at me, but if you could get your feathery ass down here, well, I'd be mighty grateful," he mock prays aloud, chin tilted up toward Heaven from the empty street. "I got something to show you, so, you know, please."
"BOBBY," Dean tries one more time. He can see the thing's creepy-ass glowy eyes now. Sam's been sideswiped by a bookshelf and Bobby's just standing there. Dean doesn't care that the damn incantation is working, he's not gonna let Bobby be some bloody sacrifice to a lame-ass demigod everybody forgot about.
It's not one specific thing that wakes Dean up. It's not because he's in pain or because he has to take a leak. It's not the sound of birds or the smell of coffee, and he's not startled or disoriented. He's just
First of all, Castiel thinks, that’s not true. He purchased this house. By law, it’s his. Whatever happened in the past, the property had obviously been transferred out of Dean’s possession. The rights of the dead have no bearing here. And second of all—
Castiel reaches to put a hand on Dean’s thigh, and they both watch it pass right through. He makes a fist and swallows down the subsequent sadness—sadness that he can’t comfort Dean, and because there’s so much that needs comforting. “You obviously loved him a lot. What happened to him? Is he—?”
Cas makes a face and lets go, turning away. "Yes, it was. The things I've done, Dean . . . and for you to be punished for my sins—I can't begin to make amends."
Still, "This is not how I wanted this to go," Dean mutters under his breath. He doesn't let himself think about it a lot, but there's always been a
He drags Cas up to kiss him when he's done, Cas barely having time to wipe that stripe of come from his chin with his sleeve before Dean's got his tongue back in his mouth. It's not really a conscious decision to start pulling Cas's clothes off, but Dean doesn't stop himself. Elation is coursing through him. There's no pain because there's no stopping—Dean's curse is getting exactly what it wants as Cas kisses and caresses him.
“I only had time to start a few searches this morning but haven’t checked the results yet. It should be quiet now until school gets out, so I’ll get back to it. Just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to find you passed out from low blood sugar over here.”
The photos of reddish-pink marks left on the skin sleeping children he’d found yesterday had stirred up a panicky ache. His hand had drifted to cup his shoulder where Dean’s love bite had long since faded as he contemplated the terrifying difference between malevolent abrasions on children and how Dean had marked Castiel. Presumably, if Dean is capable of one, he’s capable of the other.
The house is uncharacteristically quiet during the week Castiel considers giving up. It aches in the spring winds as old houses do but doesn’t play tricks with the electricity or open doors on its own. Castiel notices without really being aware.
Sam gestures to the couch and chairs but continues over to the kitchen himself. “Can I get you something to drink? Eileen has some water on for tea, I think.” He joins a petite woman with salt and pepper hair in a low ponytail who’s standing at the kitchen island. She’s dwarfed by Sam’s height, and looks up at him as he speaks and signs introductions of Meg and Castiel. “They’re here about the old house,” he adds.
At first he'd liked how easy the job was, he explains. Compared to shouldering the responsibility for locking away Lucifer, it was a frickin' dream, and not getting chased around by monsters that wanted to eat him was a definite perk. "But now, I don't know. Sometimes I'd rather be making a couple hundred salt rounds," he chuckles. He grabs a paring knife and keeps going with both the chicken and his thoughts.
Castiel takes the opportunity to make a break for it, rounding the corner to the front of the house. He plasters himself to the scraped and sanded wood siding to wait, heart hammering, and has to swallow giggles between breaths.
Dean rolls out from under him and finally shucks his briefs. He scoots on his knees between Cas's thighs and Cas leans up to beg a kiss with his mouth. Dean gets himself slick—the first time he's touched himself all morning, but it only takes a few pulls to makes sure he's hard enough. Below him, Cas lays back and cants his hips, ready and waiting like the well-trained sailor he is. He smiles crookedly at Dean as though he caught the thought, but it disappears as Dean slides two fingers into him, teasing, testing.
Dean studies Cas for a second, not quite sure why the conversation took this turn, and wonders if he's missing something. But then Cas sorta snaps back to, looking right at Dean, so Dean just tackles the issues at hand, so to speak. "Yeah, I know. And that sucks, trust me, but it sucks more that I had to drag you into it."
Dean starts his goodbyes with Bobby. Bobby tells him to shut his trap and stop talking like he's dying. When Dean gives him a flat look, Bobby snaps, "You know what I mean," and walks out of the room.
"And he seemed okay to you? Like, normal?" It's a dumb question—it's not like Cas is ever exactly normal. But Dean wants to be sure Cas wasn't hit with some kind of kinky witch curse or something. So far as Dean knows most devil-worshipping trash got burned up with the plans for the apocalypse, but better safe than sorry, and it's the only explanation he's come up with so far. Not to mention, witches, man,
Dean lets his arms fall to his sides and collapses back against the wall. He's just so goddamn tired. "Yeah, how's that?"
He doesn’t quite feel watched, just a little more aware, like knowing someone has installed cameras for a reality TV show but not knowing when they may be recording. Angelus had cameras all over its building, of course, so living in semi-surveillance isn’t unfamiliar, and it’s just as true now as it had been then that Castiel has nothing to hide.
Dean's mouth touches his and Castiel seizes. His heart, his lungs, his hands where they grip the edge of the counter, they tighten without his consent. But Dean steps in impossibly closer, tilting Castiel's face up, pressing their mouths together more securely, and something in Castiel bursts loose. He sinks into Dean, everything inside him slackening, unraveling. His anxiety and pain and regret unspool, slithering to Dean's feet, only rise and wrap around him as appreciation, wonder, attraction.
“He thinks it’s his fault. It wasn’t. Courts charged the trucker with vehicular manslaughter, but Sammy . . .” Dean shakes his head. “He never stopped blaming himself.”
Sure, it’s not every day one converses with a ghost. But it’s difficult to maintain an appropriate amount of awe when the ghost picks an argument with you. A surprise smile overtakes Castiel just then and he even laughs, a quick shaky burst. So maybe he is in shock, or maybe it’s that in just one conversation he got back a little of his own with Mr. Dean “Dead-and-Haunting-You” Winchester.
One thing he’s not is scared. Dean was a surprise and he was stern, but he wasn’t horror-movie scary. It’s not a headless horseman or stripe-suited Beetlejuice or green ball of ectoplasm with too-human teeth haunting him. It’s a fairly attractive young man with a chip on his shoulder. If anything, Castiel’s relieved—at least his memory isn’t Swiss cheese.
There aren't words Dean could yell loud enough to make what he's feeling go away. Silent seething is a shitty alternative, but he manages it. Anger burns in him hot enough he feels tears spark at his eyes. Anger at himself, at Cas's selflessness, at those Leviathan fuckers, at God. Still, he wills it to stay back, all of it. If he says one thing it will be too many and too hurtful.
Nothing really changes about his routine. He gets up as usual, gets dressed as usual, drinks his coffee and gets to work as usual. What’s different now is that Castiel is curious.
Cas looks confused—less I-don't-understand-that-reference confused and more why-is-that-a-question confused. "I— Yes," he snaps to. "Of course."
"I'm not what I was. Even once I heal, I know I've . . . changed. But," he looks up at Dean then, "if all that I am is for you, then it's enough."
other day," Dean demands, not messing around now. He whips into the store lot and throws the Impala in park.
"No, stay," he hears himself say, and it’s suddenly very important to keep Cas here, close by. "Please stay?"
Inside, the entirely ordinary split-level is anything but. Whatever walls used to partition the kitchen, dining room, and living area from each other have been removed to create a great room. The space is brightened by a skylight.
“I purchased the house earlier this year, yes. I’d intended to fix it up and resell the property but that seems unlikely now.” He pauses and Sam indicates he understands the market downturn with a nod. “After putting so much time and effort into the house, well. It’s become home.”
Lisa kisses his cheek and makes him promise to come back and cook for them sometimes. Ben hugs him and makes him promise to come to his baseball games in the spring. Dean has no problem agreeing to either.
“Oh— Oh Dean, yes,” Castiel’s voice sinks to growl and he bucks as he comes, hands flying to dig hard into Dean’s hips, grounding him. Dean curses and laughs and follows him into orgasm.
Castiel gazes up at the hundred-year-old farmhouse that’s become his home. The windows reflect the fading autumn sunlight like the eerie shine of cat eyes, and the porch is a dark grin sweeping along the front. For the first time in months, he finds himself afraid to enter. Maybe this is what his poor realtor had felt the day of his first visit—and that makes him wonder how many times Dean had scared her off before Castiel arrived.
Their tongues push together and tangle for a moment before Cas slinks out from behind Dean. Dean falls back into the pillows as Cas shifts into place above him. He kisses his way down Dean's neck, chest, stomach. He doesn't seek out the splotches of come, but he doesn't avoid them either. Dean's knees draw up, hands fly to Cas's hair. He squeezes his eyes tight against his dimming vision, trying hard to hold on this time. He's pretty sure he wants what comes next as much as the monster curse is making him want it.
"What the hell? You're drenched, man. Here, sit up." He stands and hauls Cas upright, hanging onto him even as he peels off the filthy trench coat. The thing should just be burned at this point.
Dean lets out a shocked cry, half because Cas's thigh is back—pressing awesomely up and in against Dean, his own cock hot and heavy at Dean's hip—and half because he gets it, gets what's different now.
There's this terrifying split second where Dean gets no response whatsoever, but then a grin cracks wide and delirious across Cas's face and Dean probably couldn't have stopped the accompanying kiss even if he'd wanted to.
Deciding to add crown molding to the dining room seemed like an easy enough project, but now he’s spent two hours climbing up and down the ladder to measure and miter corners, dropping the tiny finishing nails, clocking his thumb with the hammer, listening to Dean prattle, and he’s about out of patience. He’s been tolerating Dean’s presence because his nonstop talking means Castiel is learning about haunting without having to ask questions, but for the most part it’s been “heroic” stories of Dean scaring children and frustrating housewives, with numerous asides to chide Castiel for not doing things right.
It’s the plan, Castiel reminds himself. They predicted this, or something similar. It’s why Castiel is the one with the matches.
There are voices outside. Reveille must've played while they were too interested in each other to notice.
Castiel turns in a circle where he stands, hands on hips, somehow expecting the room—the world—to look a little different, knowing what he knows now. It doesn’t.
It could be anybody here, but Dean's glad it's not. Cas is good for him. Having him back is good for Dean. He needs Cas, not just in case of sex-curse emergencies, but just because he does. Dean was always confused and scared but kinda flattered by the fact that Cas followed him around, that Cas chose him—even if he didn't really, not at first. But then he did. He did, he chose Dean, and Dean loves that about him.
Dean falls back on the bed the second Cas gets a hand on him, every too-tense muscle in his body giving way at the same time. It's gotta be awkward—Dean splayed out on his back, his cock hardly out of his pants as Cas leans over, fisting him—but he can't care. There's nothing, nothing other than the searing hot wash of arousal, the thrill of touch, the perfect strong strokes of Cas's hand. He feels the bed sag, feels movement down his chest, and opens his eyes to see Cas kneeling around his legs, his free hand deftly undoing the buttons on Dean's shirt. Dean groans at that, at the slide of thumb over the head of his cock, at the sight and feel of Cas pushing his shirt off to the sides, out of the way.
Castiel stops Dean's hands and meets his eyes. "It's my grace, Dean." He prays it's explanation enough.
Already thinking about his next moves—mattress delivery, grocery store, purchase more durable shoes—Castiel tucks his folded deed into his breast pocket and puts his best manners back on. “Thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Wilson. I’m very happy we could come to an arrangement.” He smiles at her and extends his hand.
Keeping my movements in check, I turned just enough to catch a glimpse of the familiar trench coat and the slouched shoulders under it. If Cas looked in my direction, I couldn’t tell. But his voice held no hesitation as he answered, “Of course. I will follow in my vehicle.”
“You two are the Rangers I’ve heard about, right? And that means you work for the state, and if you work for the state you work for the government, and if you work for the man, then you’re the enemy.”
Eventually I left everyone to their celebrating and slipped away to my room with Miracle. I flopped down onto my bed and let out a heavy sigh. The faint sounds of people talking and laughing carried through the halls. But it didn’t bother me. It was comforting thinking of all the people that cared enough to go into the Empty.
I’d barely even looked at Cas since leaving Washington. And here he was at my side like always. He wanted to look after me. I breathed deep, trying hard to get my wildly beating heart under control. For a long time, I remained tense and unsure.
Hands clamped down on his shoulders and wrenched him around. In the next instant, he was flat on his back with the bandit woman on top of him, grinding her pelvis into his own. A different shade of stars blinded Dean for a moment as he let out a gasp of pleasure. His dick immediately responded, twitching under her. She let out a satisfied cackle and ground down once more. The others cheered her on, shouting obscenities and encouragement.
“Okay then, maybe any scents or lotions you’d want to help keep you comfortable? Creating a clean smelling environment can help to keep pregnant people calm during labour.” Sam readies his hands over his keyboard.
His mind reels with too many thoughts. Thinking of Cas staying with him and their… Dean still can’t even begin to unpack that thought. It’s all too much. The room feels too small, too crowded, no matter that there are only three of them. He can’t breathe. He needs some air.
Dean really wants to resist, but maybe he’s gone a little soft or he’s just that tired, so instead he surrenders a small nod. “Alright, I’m beat. I’m going to go lay down for a bit. But
Sam frowns and moves past him. Dean’s throat grows scratchy and his mind knots as he tries to speak. His mouth opens and closes, but Sam speaks first.
Angelic grace is such a strange thing. It’s sensitive and revealing. The slightest brush of a feather or detection of an unknown presence causes the hairs to stand on one’s neck. The grace gripping around the force and trying to detect it, decipher it and analyse every fibre of the being that had disturbed the peace in the first place.
They meet each other’s gaze, Cas’ is slightly squinted, like he does when he surveys someone. His eyes flush with calculation and concern. They stare one another down for a few moments, before Sam clears his throat again, announcing that he is in fact in still the room with them.
“So is this place just open for anyone to walk in? Lucifer a couple months back and now this?” Dean’s voice takes the angel by surprise. They look at one another, Cas’ face falls and Dean’s is hard with anger.
There is a bit of destiel fluff, mixed with Sam and Cas being besties and Dean and the baby bonding. I hope y'all enjoy!
Sam’s brows crease, “Yeah…okay weirdo. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you willingly eat fruit.” The older hunter narrows his eyes dangerously, “At least that has nutrients I guess.”
“I’m not a chick. I don’t need fancy scents or whatever. I just want the drugs Rowena gave us, and for it to be over ASAP.”
and yet the hunter can’t even begin to fathom what’s going on. His body hates him sure, but it's housing something made up of both him and Cas, which should be enough to compel him to accept it. But he still can’t believe that they bought all this pregnancy crap for him when he doesn’t even want face it himself.
Cas nods, not a note of judgement on his face, “Yes, it does.” He pauses, a hand lowering to Dean’s midsection, “But they seem to like the nursery.”
As quickly as he can with his encumbered stomach, Dean gets up from the couch and stretches out. His back had probably cramped up while he slept. Sam and Cas share a shrug, as he waddles out of the den.
Dean picks up his phone and dials their local pizza joint. He orders 2 large pepperoni pizzas, a loaf of garlic bread and a bottle of ginger ale – according to Sam it’s good for heart burn. With his feast at the ready and multiple seasons of Dr Sexy taped, Dean relaxes into his bed. Maybe house arrest won’t be so bad.
A week after Dean’s ‘incident’ as Cas has come to call it, the baby started to move more. Small flutters turning into shifts and light jabs from within. Unfortunately for Cas these movements have only been felt by Dean, although they’ve tried to get him to feel them. Cas takes every opportunity to rest a hand on Dean’s stomach, hum songs or poke him to catch a small foot or hand. So far, nothing.
Rowena nods and considers something, she tuts, “And, the pain might be a sign that your birth canal is starting to form.” She concludes hesitantly.
Sam perks up, “Wait, Rowena how do you know all this angel stuff?” he says slowly, seeming to get the wrong outcome from their conversation.
With Dean’s pregnancy so close to the end, all the trio could do was play the waiting game. So, they had spent the day doing nothing. Most of it, Dean and Cas were in bed, finally resurfacing when Dean wanted to have lunch. But now, all three of them are existing together in the library.
“Positions? Location?” Dean echoes nervously, feeling very out of his depth. He places a nervous hand to his stomach.
That is until Sam stops her before she ascends the stairs, “Hey. Would I be able to ask one last thing?”
Dean brushes past Cas and gets to work on the groceries, pulling some bread from one of the bags and placing it in the cabinet. Cas, with seemly nothing else to do, leans on the counter, just watching him work for a moment.
“And you neglected to mention the fact that “when angelic grace is involved” means that it-uh-“  Dean interjects, but he stops talking because he wants to puke. All over Cas and his stupid face.
Dean’s face warms but his heart wrenches at the thought of how he left Cas the morning after. He was cold and unrelenting, pushing his fear and repression onto Cas. “I’m sorry for making you go.”
“Thanks.” Cas beams, his expression returning to his signature furrowed brow, “But what about my grace? If we need to ward against heaven, I can’t stay with Dean.”
Lucifer hasn’t moved. He throws his hands up, beaming that annoying grin, “Hey guys! Welcome to the party!”
Ms Mulberry’s eyebrows crease further down at that question. She ponders for a moment, eyeing Dean cautiously as she thinks, “Well, his boss always keeps things like that in the warehouse storage.” She starts, hesitating somewhat with her answer, “You’d have to ask around the warehouse. They might know more than me.” She offers, her look almost sympathetic.
Dean sighs as he settles back down on to the couch. Careful to place a pillow behind his back, “I’m fine, thankfully it passed.”
She hums an affirmative, “After Metatron attacked, I had a few reliable angels spread the word that I was dead.” She continues the conversation, seeming unphased by the dangerous expression being thrown her way.
“No.” Cas stops Dean’s train thought in its tracks. He turns to face him directly, “The risk to the Nephilim’s wellbeing is too high.” His voice softens to a whisper, “We can’t take any chances.”
Too weak to get up, Dean crawls towards the pile with his lighter in hand. The spirit comes too close, hands threatening their way to grab at his chest. Brian’s spirit shrills and screams, urging him to cower. He throws the lighter, hoping to God it’ll catch the gas that was liberally splashed over the pile. The fire ignites the ghost in front of him. Disintegrating the soul into a writhing ash of yells. Dean shields his eyes from the blinding lights of the flame.
They both look down to Dean’s ever-growing bump. In which the baby from within is kicking excitedly. Dean braces a hand to his back and lets out a shaky breath as a strong kick gets him in the ribs, “Let’s not get too excited.” He chuckles lowly to his stomach, “You’ve still got a bit of time before you can hang out in here.”
“Thanks. And what are you doing, judgy?” Dean grunts, grabbing the components of his “breakfast” from the fridge. The meal of choice consisting of yogurt, peanut butter with a chopped banana on top.
“A warding talisman? Yes, it seems to be Sam. Ten points!” Lucifer triumphs, “This thing keeps you out of Heaven’s range. And any
There are two voices coming from the entrance of the bunker. One, Cas, is familiar while the second voice isn’t. He notes that he’ll investigate after he’s taken a leak. The need has become more urgent now that he’s standing up.
“A drill in the head wasn’t gonna kill me. You should know that.” She seems too calm for Cas’ liking.
As Sam and Cas try to stay alive, the next hour goes by quickly. Hazed by the ebbing concussion, Sam tries his best to keep the poltergeist occupied while Cas slips away. When Cas is able to get out of the reach of the poltergeist, he gets the objects needed for the ritual out of the trunk of the impala. A hex bag and an incantation later and the poltergeist is gone. Doctor Halen wakes up, and Cas calls an ambulance for her.
