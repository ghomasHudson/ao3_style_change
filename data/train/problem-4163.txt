“I was wondering how long you would stand out there for” The man chuckled with a gruff voice “You must be Castiel”
The unsaddled horse gripped tightly in his clutches.
They both look to the door bracing themselves. Then the door is swinging open. Cold winter air rushing in with small flurries of snow. On the porch stands, Mary and John, wrapped boxes in hand and smiles on their faces. Swamped in their large winter coats, and Mary’s large scarf.
"Don't let that influence you though. I just don't want things to be awkward between us after this if I go too far. I don't want to ruin our friendship all because I can't keep a relationship" Dean said sincerely, stepping closer and placing a hand over the horse as well.
“I love you too Angel”
“Blanket hog” Dean mutters and shivers again.
Cas beamed at Dean, “really?”
“Nice to meet you” Dean says ensuring she can read his lips. Once he’s finished speaking he nudges Cas expectantly.
"Hello Mary," Cas says warmly before he is pulled into a hug of his own, but not an ounce of red dashes his face, however. Mary always makes him feel a mother's warmth even though he hadn't gotten that in a long time. Finally, she pulls away from the two of them, scanning down the both of them. Probably in assurance they are eating enough. Classic mom style. Cas too looks to Dean. Admiring the way his hair spikes a few fallen snow flurries effortlessly.
The three of them arrive at the small diner in town. The waiter seating them at a four-person booth. Cas slides in beside Sam, across from Dean.
“We’re done.” Chuck declares, his statement is final “I’m cancelling your show.”
But Dean only relented taking a step forward, grabbing Cas's hand "I mean it Cas. We are done with school, I can go home get my things, you won't have to steal your Dad's car, we can take baby." He practically begged all with a rush, referring to his impala, that was back at home.
From then on the two came to know each other well. Cas would give up part of his study time to chat with Dean. That is if the small shop wasn’t busy, otherwise the two would sneak glances at each other every so often between guests.
The two boyfriends stood in front of the mirror, after dressing the rest of the way up.
"You don't know that Dean. That is the kind of look that you just can't fake. Just talk to him." Sam gives him a pat on the back before leaving the dining room. Letting Dean think.
Everything- he crossed out the word like replacing it with love -
“Relax” Dean groans “I’m not letting him ride shot gun. Go get the Nephilim, I’m sure he won’t mind.”
They all look at each other, Cas to Dean, Jack to Sam, Michael to Dean, Dean to Sam, all around. Moving ever so slightly with anxious energy. Yet no one looks at Lucifer.
“I can maybe do you one better,” Dean winked after regaining his composure, scooping up the remained of the books “I may be able to fix your car”
”Dean” Cas says a bit troubled, with a measured amount of anguish in his eyes. He just wants Dean to be happy ”What happened?”
John scrubs his hand over his face slowly before continuing, his voice still a bit like a drill sergeant, "Dean I know I have been hard on you, your whole life. That I have treated you unfairly when it comes to um-relationships... and for that I am sorry. I crossed a line yesterday with you Ca-as, and I should not have acted the way I did. I can tell you make Dean happy and you clearly love each other." he looks over at Mary “That is what matters in the end.”
The three of them huff, while Jack gets into the car accepting this for what it is.
“Probably some god fearing good Christian girl with the personality of a saltine cracker. Because god forbid she actually recognize that I am Gay and stop my siblings from degrade me every time I’m around.” Cas fumed sipping down more of the scalding hot coffee. He didn’t mean to be so harsh about whoever the girl may be but he is angry. Christmas has never been one of his fonder memories at least not since he came out about three years ago.
Of course, he is, maybe he was just too blind before, but now maybe there is a chance. An itty-bitty chance, his feelings can be reciprocated.
"Let me help," Dean said, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend resting his chin on his shoulder. He guided his arms into the throw watching Cas's face pucker with determination, and clank - all of the bottles fell to the ground.
Then rounds the back of the gas station, hotwiring the abandon truck. With little suspicion he pulls out onto the road, bumbling along.
Though Dean should be more focused on the apology his Dad is giving him all he can feel the pang in his chest. He wishes what John said is true, the apology, the happiness, the love, he wishes all of it were true.
“She was pretty” Castiel’s smile is just barely there, “She had this long black hair that felt like silk. Blue eyes, Anna use to tell me, mine were just like hers. She was nice Dean – she loved us unconditionally and without fail. No matter what happened in the family she could fix it she could piece it back together. She made us all so happy…”
“Thanks Dean” Cas takes it into his hand, and he nudges the other boy’s shoulder. His chest feeling like something is about to exploded inside it. The feather glimmers with iridescent color still; no bother of the dampness of the feather.
And Dean has stayed silent long enough, voicing his concerns, his mistrust, “We reached out to you.” Dean accuses his adam’s apple bobbing “You ignored us.”
By the time Dean finished rambling his words were hardly audible over the sob wracking through his body. His hands clung to the the back of Cas’s shirt. He stuffed his face in the crook of Cas’s shoulder.
"What is this Cas," Dean asked in a low almost careful voice as if speaking too loud would cause Cas to run "These boxes"
After dinner the fake couple, washes and loads the dishwasher together in harmony. Just as they do back in their dorm, just a bit more touchy than before. Despite Mary’s insistence that they are the guests, and they shouldn’t have to do the dishes.
Castiel shakes his head at this, a no. Dean just watches.
The couple turn from the table, uncaring of the people around them ducking their eyes away as if they didn’t witness the Winchester family drama that just unfolded in the restaurant.
“Oh, did I forget to mention that” Lucifer says with fake shock, dramatically cover a hand over his mouth “My bad. Yes, Betty here is a reaper.”
There was a light drizzle of rain outside today. Sweeping in waves of thick pelts to the ground below, tearing of pieces of leaves, bark, and paint as they fell. Cracking like large lightning bolts between the flecks of paint. The halls were unusually cold and abandoned. Single red lights flaring, along with a blaring alarm through them.
Yet he doesn’t move, he doesn’t because maybe he thinks he deserves this moment. Even if it’s not real.
Cas stops writing, his hand a little shaking at how much he loves this man. Falling for him in every way possible. He has to be sure Dean is okay. He can just watch over him tonight and be gone before Dean wakes up.
Hay is stacked in one of the corners a whole pile of it musty and old. As if it’s been rained on many times. A thin layer of dirt coats the concrete ground. Dim light streams in between the wooden slats of the wall. Posts stand tall supporting the tin roof above. All around there is an assortment of farming equipment, and other supplies. Cobwebs from corner to post, some hanging in bunches long since abandoned and ripped apart by the weather. A small door to a built-in closet at the back.
“Goodbye my boy” Bobby waves with a  smile when Cas heads off in the distance back to work. For that short time with Bobby, Cas actually felt okay, content even. Maybe not happy, but content.
“I did too for a while, but with you” Dean smiles, when Cas gives his hand a comforting squeeze. Urging him to continue, the hope in his eyes spilling out.
Trying his hardest to not stare at his friend’s ass, because that’s all he is a friend. Just helping Dean by being his fake boyfriend. At this point Dean doesn’t remember why he had Cas be his fake boyfriend. Maybe that is the problem that is making him think he can actually have Cas, when he can’t.
Cas clenches his teeth together miffed by Dean’s anger ”no you are wrong Dean. I don’t pity you. The list is about you”
“Of course I care Cas,” Dean says, before pulling Cas into a hug that is more like a cuddle. However, Cas doesn’t mind, as he buries his face into the crook of his best friend’s neck.
Cas chuckles, Dean is such a Christmas nerd. He feels a slight discomfort swell in his chest “It’s nothing Dean, just thinking about Christmas, y’know”
“I can’t believe you are reading that again. I don’t get how you read so much.” Dean teases and Cas glances over for just a moment, “You are becoming just as bad as Sammy with that book.”
Dean gulps down his beer in a practiced manner. He looks to the window where Cas and Jack are sitting outside hugging. Dean notices how gentle Jack is with the angel, “What are they doing out there?” he scoffs harshly placing the empty glass back down.
Eventually the two break apart. Both feeling lighter than they have in – well since Cas left. Already Dean is back to light smiles and cracking jokes. Sam stares at his brother in disbelief. How dense can one man be?
"Okay, I'll be right back"
“Don’t you get it you already saved me.” His voice breaks. A single heartbroken tear, falling from his eye.
"Wait Cas- Stop" Dean yelled sprinting behind him, he spun Cas around, wiping away the tears Cas wasn't aware had fallen "Did you mean that"
"Listen son, I owe you an apology" John steps forward but not so much as to interfere with the invisible wall John created between himself and his son. Dean watches as he directs his attention to Cas, apologetically "I owe both of you an apology."
Vampire number three while still knocked out, Dean ties his hands behind his back. Perhaps tighter than necessary but he can’t bring himself to care. They push him down on a tree stump in the yard, yanking the mask from his face. To reveal a basic-looking middle-aged white guy. He wakes with a start, flashing his vangs just as they pull the mask from his face.
“We imprinted our devotion to God unto humanity. Our devotion to who we thought him to be, has endured.”
Dean flips through the book some more. Glancing up at Cas again who glances back, caught. There is only a scar left on the side of his neck where the empty had burnt him. When Dean sees it the guilt tugs at him again, and he looks away.
He is going to shut out the constant trepidation that rears up each time he almost slips up. Either way it goes, at least he thinks it will be out there it will be open. As he approaches the wrong side of 30 it’s about time. It may be terrifying, and one of the hardest things he’s had to do in his life and that includes going to college, but he needs to do this for himself.
“Jack” Cas sighs wearily, frowning at his son. He remembers that conversation, remembers telling him it matters because they loved them, “I know I am always supposed to be here, that’s what immortality is. But sometimes even immortality can’t last forever, you’ve seen that. I made that deal because I have had thousands of lifetimes to live and to experience humanity and watch as mountains grow. Even though all my choices haven’t been good or perfect I have lived. I wanted that opportunity for you too. I needed to save Dean now, so he could save the world.”
Cas smiled at Dean, his insides feeling a little warm and fuzzy, ”Well then I get to see my favorite barista, don’t tell everyone else your my favorite though”
likes his best friend.
Dean looks at him one last time with love, a love he will shove down to the depths of his mind. Never allowing it to resurface again, because Cas deserves to be happy and his brother deserves to be happy too. He looks away again, at least Cas will still be here. At least they can still be friends. Maybe one day this gaping hole in his chest will finally close.
Dean and Cas move from the fireplace to watch the movie on the TV screen. They lean against the couch in between Sam and Eileen, and Jo on the other side of them. Even though they move. Dean still reposisitions them back to as they were. his arms wrapped around Cas. and Cas's head on his shoulder. Occasionally nodding off to sleep.
“Come on Dean” Cas says, turning to the freckled face man behind him, a palm held out. Dean takes his dashing husband’s hand, a clink as their silver rings hit against each other.
That night the house is quiet, no happy chirping, no singing, and no monitors beeping. There is just silence.
“Must be Sam” Dean frowns, at least Cas stayed for once.
Dean burned bright red as Charlie elbowed him in the side. He knew he should not have told them about his crush on the blue-eyed college student. He wasn't even sure Cas is into dudes ”shudd up now get back to work”
“Stop Cas, I just-“ he runs a hand over his face looking back at the snowflakes. Maybe that will be their fate to but what if it’s not “look”
He pushed down the hurt that seemed to swell up.
There was no doubt they love each other, and almost none that Cas would say yes. But he couldn't help from being a bit nervous. What if it is too soon? It had only been a year of dating but they knew each other for 11 years now, living as roommates and then a couple for nearly half that.
He doesn’t mean for it to come out so callous, but he can’t stop himself. There are things more important than himself.
Gabriel wraps his arms around the front of Castiel, letting him cry. His big brother, whispers “It’s going to be okay” over and over as he rubs small circles into his back. The tires of the boxy vehicle can be heard in the distance churning over the gravel road as it drives away from their house.
He snaps his fingers. A girl appears beside him bounded by chains and gagged with a white cloth tied around her face. Dean notices Castiel’s change in expression, as if he’s seeing something they can’t. She appears to just be a woman though, “Who is she?”
”I know Dean, I know”
Tapping his foot Cas waits for Dean to say something to his brother about them, when the conversation dies down. A minute passes, and he still doesn’t.
“What” Cas asks, looking back to where the door has since closed, leaving Dean and Michael alone.
Cas stands with a wide smile, and takes Dean’s hand.
Gently he places the white feather back in the inside pocket of his coat where it had once been. Still looking at the black feather, as he makes his way back to the abandoned swing set.
“Cas-“
Cas smiles at the all too familiar face now blissfully asleep. He tiptoes out the bedroom, leaving the door ajar on the way out.
"hmh" Dean hopes, urging Cas to continue wishing maybe it doesn't have to be bittersweet.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says with a small blush, holding out his hand for Dean to shake “I’m Castiel.”
The first thing he registers is the cold wood of the floor beneath his bare feet. Reaching down he grabs the fluffy bee socks he discarded on the ground just before getting in bed. Pulling them on he looks back over at Dean, the small pout on his lips moving slowly as he breaths. Long, dark lashes fanning over his pale eyelids. A few darker freckles can be seen where the morning sunlight filters in through the bedroom window.
With that omission Dean stumbles out of the room, retrieves his bottle, and closes the door with a small click. Accepting the lack of light beneath the door.
“Damn it boy” John cursed slamming his fist on the table, to which Dean jumped “I knew it, I know that gay boy Castiel was no good. This is all his fault.”
“As far as we know only Death can open it.” Sam explains as clinical as ever. As if he is explaining how to put together an Ikea bookshelf, rather than killing God himself, “But… We were hoping you could too.”
As if sensing his tenseness Dean halted his words, "Can't wait to meet'er," Dean cleared his throat "Me and Cas better get unpacked 'fore John and Bobby get here."
“Jack?” Castiel looks around with bewilderment, as the beings approach them.
”Yes I can kiss” Cas huffed slightly offended sounding. As he crossed his arms over his chest.
The ang- former angel, is staring at his hand in morbid fascination, flexing his fingers. The wound moving with it, gaping open and close. His voice comes out rough, and a little too light, “I’m human now”
Cas sits there just listening without judgement, he lets Dean look away when it’s too much. He’s there to hear and to tell Dean that he didn’t deserve what happened.
The two never seemed to drift away after that day. They shared a mutual understanding and closeness. Best friends.
Cas’s graces balls at the center of Dean’s palm with a warm touch back to him. Then Dean drops his hand with a sigh.
"Mhm Cas" Dean rolls over reaching out to grab Cas's hand. When he rests his hand atop Cas's he sighs happily. Back to his still sleep. Eyes moving quickly behind his eyelids.
I never told you and now I never can.
Jack doesn’t say anything for a long while he just sits thinking, and Cas lets him, “Thank you Cas. I love you too. I just don’t want you to leave me.” He gives a small lopsided smile before hugging the angel, delicately careful of his wounds.
“Stop” they hear a voice grumble as their feet fall on their dirt, “You killed my entire family.”
Any second now Dean thought I’ll do it I’ll tell them. Any second he says again stirring the food on his plate. Mary’s casserole Dad’s favorite dish, for his birthday. The whole reason him Sammy, mom and Dad are all here together in the first place.
Hunching his shoulder Dean shuffles out the door. Wishing Cas would let him in.
“Yes” Castiel whispers an ache searing in his chest. Dean can’t even say his nickname anymore. Even though his mind is yelling at him to stop. That this is only going to break his heart more, he lets Dean pull him into a hug. He relishes in the way Dean buries his head into his shoulder and feels the hot tears from his eyes. Cas hugs back just as tight, probably for the last time.
"yes," The redhead answered, shaking her head.
Dean sinks in on him self cowering back into his carefully crafted, hateful John box. Cas only holds on tighter to his hand keeping him from shutting the lid completely.
His thoughts snap just as his hopes arise. It’s probably true too, Dean would have done something if he felt the same. He always has confidence with relationships, and his flirtatious manner.
Emptiness.
“Do you actually mean all of that you want to be with me forever, grow old, be boyfriends?” Cas asked in between gentle kisses, only a slight bit of trepidation remaining.
"Goodbye," Castiel whispered although there was no one there to hear him. He stuck the key in the ignition, the low purr of his car filled the air. Letting out a puff of air he shifted the car into reverse, letting his foot off the brake.
Cas watches as Jack reigns his powers back in. Just before the glow around him dies he snaps his fingers. Sam and Dean look normal again, the wounds all heal, and Cas can feel his own wounds healed. Though his grace remains the same. The brothers help him to his feet, letting each other go. Sam grabbing ahold of an arm and Dean pulling him up completely his hand resting on the small of his back, the other on his chest.
“Me too I turn eleven next week though” Cas answers, swinging their still joined hands as they walk together down the trail. The wind rustles the leaves as it blows gently through the budding green trees. Grasshoppers bounce around their feet, one latching onto his leg before bouncing off again.
Then Dean held his hand back at himself on his chest “and I am just a boy”
Cas lifts his head lips above Dean's ear, a warm puff of breath "I know"
Dean clenches his jaw, “Well that would be just like
Jack and Cas however stay outside, sitting on a blue rusted bench in front of the diner. Facing out towards the empty streets. Cas remembers the early days with the Winchesters. When he was afraid to rebel and only just begun considering it. How he would watch humanity, understand their actions, and learn from a bench just like this one. It was a bench where he felt for the first time the emotions humans so often glorified, in poems, movies, songs, and all of their creations. Where he first smiled and made his decision for humanity – for
“Deann” the boy groans slapping away his hand, he looks as if he can’t be much older than six. He fixes his hair giving Cas a curious look, as he fidgets beside Dean.
"Dean never told me that, he said he didn't know where the vases had come from." Cas tilted his head in confusion as to why Dean would have lied.
Sam delivers the final slice to his own vamp. When Dean’s charges right back grabbing Dean’s shoulders. Slamming him hard against one of the posts.
Cas shrugs "I wake up at four am most days for work so I'm used to waking up early. Dean hates it." he adds smiling into his cup. Though it is rare that he wakes Dean when he gets up for work, it can be hard not to in their tiny dorm. More than once he's had a pillow chucked at his head for 'being too Damn loud at the ass crack of dawn'. According to Dean who needs his four hours of rest. Yet can stay up late into the night blaring his classic rock through his headphones.
Michael shrugs, “he pulled Lucifer out. I think there is a lot of things God can do but doesn’t want us to know he can. All mysterious – a coined phrase with his all-mighty stature.”
“I love you too dumbass”
“No, you aren’t” Cas yells, grabbing his side with a pained expression, though his voice wavers he doesn’t relent “Chuck isn’t getting what he wants. Sam”
Dean’s chest tightens. Black spots cover his vision blacking out pieces of his brother, “Please Sam, Castiel isn’t coming” Only part of him believes it, after all the hurt Cas always comes back. A beaten dog returning to its owner. Maybe he hopes that the angel won’t make it in time that way he doesn’t have to keep letting him down, “It’s okay. I’m ready.”
Castiel frowns looking up at the boy. Crowley, Castiel’s bully. He is a grade above him and mean to everyone, always bragging about his three extra inches whatever that means.
They stared.
Cas looked up at Dean from under thick black eyelashes, seemingly even more beautiful than before, “I wanted to surprise you. Sorry for not doing it with you but I left room for you to decorate it too.”
“Jack…” Cas trails unsure of how to answer, the black goo of the shadow swirling closer. The shadow dredging closer, like its walking through sloppy mud. Cas eyes the shadow wearily, “Jack you shouldn’t be here, the deal –“
He lets the angel go with a bright shade of red high on his cheeks. Sam rolls his eyes and the three get in the impala.
Sam nodded “Is it true are you bi?”
This time there is no music or finger tapping of any kind. Other than the sound of  Sam fingers hitting the keyboard as he texts Eileen the specifics of the case. And probably a few other things judging by Sam’s smile. Dean just watches the road his usual gliding movements across the road, a little rougher.
The four of them snake around the halls to the living room. Far beyond excited the two finally have a bigger house that is all their own.
Unconsciously he wobbles to the room he's been sharing with Cas. Once he is inside, he sinks onto the bed. His face pressed into the pillows, inhaling Cas's scent. Old pennies, and rain. He just feels his heart breaking in his chest as it has many times before. Except this time, it's worse because this feels like the start of a breakup but they were just pretending.
“He almost died” Dean’s voice breaks when says it. Sam steps away, a confused look crossing his face “Cas almost died, and I just let him go”
Just as he did, he slammed his foot back down on it as the passenger door swung open.
Chuck pants, squirming on the ground, “So this is how it ends.” He looks up at them squinting, closing his eyes in the light he isn’t used to, “My book.”
They stop turning around to look back at Chuck, who is still sprawled on the ground, pathetic.
Cas tips his head to the side with a confused look and after a beat Dean speaks again with excitement this time “Hey do you want to go meet my brother, he wondered off down the trail a while ago and I have to go find him.”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye”
"Sorry, Cas" Dean finally pulled away once they entered the all too familiar room. His eyes fell on the small bed. The bed didn’t pose a problem, or at least Dean hoped it wouldn’t. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t shared one many times before, "I didn't think to ask what you'd be comfortable doing in front of my family when you agreed to this."
Dean’s eyes fly open. Crashing back against the post. He groans, a sharp breath retching from his open mouth. He grabs wildly at the Vamps mask. Feeling the sharp pain of something in his back. Struggling against him. The pain grows overwhelming. He lets out a breath when Sam slices off his head. Dropping his arms back to his sides, head to his chest. Tired.
But he also cried his shoulders shook violently. It was all too much. Each time he thought Dean couldn’t care for him more he did, he proved him wrong.
“Gone” Michael says with a distance in his voice. Castiel can see the pain in his eyes, a hurt that he knows too well. Something in the way he shifts his weight, and sighs. Unbothered by the volume of the storm just outside. Seemingly unaffected by their presence, other than the few flashes where in the different shades of light he can see Adam in the brothers. Cas knows this. A love lost.
Dean didn’t go pick up Charlie though. No guilt was eating him up. Dean may not know much but he knew how expensive makeup is. Thanks to his old girlfriend Lisa who always wore it. That meant Cas had saved to get those eyeshadows. Dean fucked up.
"It's like your flying" Dean stretched out his arms slightly "but without the scary parts."
"yeah it's so fun" Benny one of Dean's friends grumble from across the aisle shifting in his seat "The straw isn't poking up my rear at all"
“Alright there’s time for that later,” Dean says quietly winking back, ignoring the way his face is burning at the implication “Now get on with unwrapping yours”
Part of Dean has already conceded to the fact that, his family will react poorly to his bisexuality. He’d listened to enough of John’s complaining over queer people kissing on TV to know this. Though John often seemed harder to read to most, he wasn’t to Dean. He knew each eyeroll, each slight movement down to the tap of a finger of John’s mood, he had to growing up with him as his father. Dean has some hope in his uncle Bobby. After all he raised him, and his little brother more than John ever had after his mom, Mary’s death when he was four. But still, he could be wrong. He wondered if his mom were still here how things would have turned out, if she would have known, and if she would accept it. Dean supposes none of that matters now anyway.
Cas chortles “Sam hello”
When he’s finished saying his piece it’s like a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. For thousands of years, he was forced to follow God’s plan, and do everything in accordance with his will. Horrible, not Castiel things. Finally, that burden has been stripped away for the last time.
“There you go boy. See I knew you’d like Baby” He pats the roof of the car receiving a small bark from Miracle.
“There all done” Cas held out his hand pulling Dean to his feet.
“See” Jack places his hands on either side of the small plant. As it begins to wilt, power from it seeps into Jacks hands, till it is just a brown wilted sprig.
”Give me a second with dad angel, then I'll be back, ” Dean pecked Cas on his hairline before they broke apart. An act that was forever seared into Cas’s mind. He could get used to angel.
Disappointment colors Michael’s words. Without words his intonation claims that Cas deserved the treatment he received. Dean doesn’t say anything. But he feels the tendrils of guilt wrapping around his chest, suffocating. All the words left unspoken between them.
“So, I see it worked out” Sam snickered, pulling the two from their moment that had probably gone on way too long any way, but Dean couldn’t care less. The taller moose of a brother had entered the kitchen, and when Dean looked at him, he had a ridiculously smug smile on his face.
Cas nodded a look of hurt and embarrassment flashing over his face. He’d been outside building his confidence for almost twenty minutes just to ask the favor “okay it’s okay I can get an Uber or something”
"No nothing like that" Dean frowns looking down at his hands clasped over the table, "I-I"
“Ugh this is why we need to get an apartment like Benny and Andrea” Dean groans, before he remembers they aren't actually together. Not that he hasn't thought about them getting an apartment together, even if it's just platonically it would give them more space.
”What” Sam questions looking away from the show he is watching. Cas’s favorite show, Doctor who.
Before Cas has a second more to analyze the other boy, Jody is back a small bag of things clutched in her hand.
"Nothing" Cas squeezes his arms tighter around him, counting his breaths. Edging himself away from a panic attack.
“Hello Cas” Jack exclaims happily, raising a hand as he always does.
Dean hums in response.
Dean swallowed thickly, overthinking why would he pause before saying you “oh and what about after you finish the menu”
Cas turns to Dean and places a hand on his friends’ shoulder, “Dean” Dean whips his head over to look at Cas “We are friends. I don’t mind listening to your family ‘crap’ as you call it.”
It’s odd that things between them are just as usual. Only a bit of distance distinct in their friendship after the kiss. The occasional fluttering of eyes away when they meet, but almost normal.
The couple leaves the kitchen, strolling through their small three-bedroom house, to the door. Every space covered in a decoration of some kind, be it a snow globe, or some tinsel. A few handmade one’s hung on the wall beside their real family pictures. A knock sounds from the door as they approach it.
“For your son” Cas shifts his eyes to Bobby as he says it and then back to John, “I understand I may not have been the person you were expecting when Dean told you he was going to bring a date tonight. But I am here for him and I want to know the people that are important to Dean and are a part of his life. And-“
Cas draped the blanket over Dean’s sleeping body as he had seen in the movies. Flicking the lamp off, casting the room into complete darkness.
“Han solo is my favorite character,” Cas states over the phone watching as he runs around on the screen sweaty and dirty. Cas can’t lay a finger on why he’s Cas’s favorite, but there is something about his character. Wiggling back into the couch he repositions putting the crescent shaped phone to his ear to hear Dean’s response.
Suddenly he was home, he wasn’t even sure how he got there but he opened up the door. Standing there was Cas. His Best friend. He tumbled into his arms.
A low ring rises from the house.
With hesitation Dean takes his hand allowing Cas to pull him into the powder beside him.
The date they are on right now. He drinks.
For a moment before Dean closed his eyes laying down on the bed, Cas swore he saw hurt, but when Dean reopens them there is nothing there.
Dean lets out a breath at the pat, easing his mind from the clothing.
“Of course” Dean pushed himself up, fumbling around to grab his crutches. Desperately trying to get away from Cas, away from his sad eyes that probably were only pity for Dean. The man who fell in love with the most breath taking, incredible angel, who didn’t love him back.
Finally they broke apart smiling as Cas rested his forehead on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas nods leaning his back against the counter. Sending a quick text to Gabriel checking up on how his Christmas is. Though he’s not too concerned, Gabe could be in a meat grinder for Christmas and he’d still crack a joke about it. That is as long as he has candy.
Cas leans down sultrily whispering into Dean’s ear “Don’t ask stupid questions. There’s no one here to pretend for.” Just before he pulls away to kiss him some more, he pulls his ear between his teeth giving it a nip.
Dean surged forwards joining their lips, effectively cutting off any more apologies the angel had. The kiss had way too many teeth; he was sure he almost gave Cas a nosebleed when they bumped noses. But after a moment of stillness Cas’s lips were moving too, in sync with his own. As if it were what they were always meant to be doing, and it was perfect, “Son of a bitch” Dean breathed when they finally broke apart, still wrapped up in each other. Hugging each other for dear life.
Everything is so warm and he wants to live in this moment forever.  Watching flurries of snow melt into the road beneath the window.
“Then you are going to return everyone” Sam states with a nod, his confidence is weary but on the surface he looks strong. Cas knows.
Maybe it was just Castiel projecting, but a look of hurt flashed across Dean's face. He leaned across the seat into the back, flipping one of the boxes open, "Your books, and clothing, and my ACDC shirt I left at your house. Cas what is this?"
“Really” Dean yells holding out his hands “What the hell man”
Dean looks to the clock beside the table reading 12:07, he rubs his thumb in smoothing circles on Cas’s hand. Placing a small kiss to the bottom of his jaw “Merry Christmas angel”
“Let’s go angel” Dean laces their fingers, smiling despite the heaviness that is still there. He is totally and completely screwed. Because he is hopelessly in love with his best friend.
The last items on the list dismissive of a few smudges below indicating Cas isn’t finished.
I scream out in pain but it's the pain that I crave because you are in a place worse than hell. I know how much it hurts Sam when he hears my cries but I can't stop.
”Well not today” Dean snaps at Cas receiving a hurt look in return.
"What Cas of course not" Dean snorts, standing up, "why are you tired of me?"
Cas steps back in on himself, returning to his pensive state, listening.
“We do.”
The Angel stops abruptly, skidding on his feet. In front of his boy. He grabs onto his shoulders holding himself up. Cas breathes heavily catching his breath “It’s Dean”
“I know this has been really hard for you, but I am happy that you are willing to introduce me to your family as your boyfriend” Cas says after a minute of silence listening to the slow rumble of the parked impala.
Dean’s eyes widened a moment at Castiel’s words till he saw the stupid grin on his face. Throwing back on his flirtatious confidence, he wriggled his eyebrows “I guess you’ll just have to wait and see, lover boy.”
Dean drops his head into his hands, the overwhelming feeling coming back. He just wants to love and be loved in return.
"Shit Cas I- your makeup" Dean started taking a step closer as if he were going to try to help.
Noel Noel
Cas frowns, looking down at the sea foam green plastic in his hand that connects him to his only friend, “Right now. Can me and Dean talk for just a little bit longer, since he is at bobby’s and I won’t get to see him this weekend.”
“Did you say –“ Sam raised his eyebrows slightly “You and Cas”
“What” Dean asked looking around the kitchen, everything seemed just as busted and outdated as always.
Dean widens his eyes popping up from the bed, as Sam leaves. He walks to the door, smelling the ham and turkey awaiting them downstairs. Along with the rest of their family.
Since that day, in the park him and Dean became practically attached at the hip every weekend when Dean stayed with Jody and Donna. They met up at some point, somewhere to play, sometimes Sam would join them other times it was just him and Dean. On the weekdays when Dean was away at his uncle Bobby’s they emailed back and forth about their respective brothers, about school, about everything and nothing.
Cas shakes his head, “It’s not okay.” He demands.
Taking it from his hand and leaning in to place it back on the shelf. His eyes never once leaving Castiel’s.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s back ”Well I guess it's a good thing I'm the only barista who knows how to make it just right.”
Cas redden dropping his eyes to the ground, he squeaked out in a meek voice ”no”
Jack shrugs.
“With the hat on” Cas wiggles his eyebrows, looking over at where the cowboy hat sits on the desk.
Cas joins him after a moment, grabbing his bag out, just before Dean slams it closed with a - Clunk.
“I think I can stop Chuck.” Jack states, and Sam nods.
Cas stands his back still pressed against the tree, flicking his eyes to Jack and then the brothers. Both of which appear to be okay.
More people began to join the hayrack ride piling on until it was completely filled. Everything was so content, Dean thought how perfect. The tractor emitted a low hum as it moved them steadily along, away from the loud carnival where they had spent the majority of the day. All by themselves just the way Dean intended. Riding small rides, sharing pie and cotton candy, watching Cas fail at simple games.
"That's for keeping it a secret that our angel Castiel over here is your boyfriend." Ellen shakes her head, grinning at Cas. In return, a blush spread over his cheeks turning them an awful shade of red.
The other woman Donna is clothed in a police uniform wearing a large smile as she looks between the boys and Jody, “You betcha’” She holds out her arms taking the boy. Her voice has a drawl to it that is different from anything Castiel has heard in Kansas though he doesn’t know where to place it.
Cas swallows back the pain, not understanding it. How he is still here? The empty came for him. He felt it the nothingness calling him back once more to follow through with their deal, then it faded, and a blaze replaced it. As if the empty had been destroyed- maybe it had. He shakes his head, refocusing his energy on healing and keeping himself from twisting in pain, if only for Dean’s sake.
“No, it’s not okay” Dean yells with the same intonation, repeating the words Cas said early when he was dying. He grabs the angel’s – he is still Dean’s angel – hands again, “You always save me, saved everyone. Over and over. Sacrificing everything for everyone else – for me. Without thought as to the cost, nor hesitation.” Dean lifts Cas’s bandaged hand as an example, “You have always saved me Why won’t you let me save you for once.”
Dean just scoffed at them shaking his head. Beside him Dean's little brother Sam chimed "Don't listen to them, Dean is right it is a lot of fun. Plus since we are going to the carnival the tractor normally speeds up."
They do have Sam, don’t they.
The constant trepidation, eating him up. Dean shifted in his seat again. Studying the table in front of him but not daring to look up at his families faces. The square table had a white runner across the middle and a single orange rose in a small vase in the center.
"Oh and Castiel, my other boy" Mary smiles as she steps away from her oldest son.
“Of course, you did” Sam rolls his eyes at his older brother.
"I got to go help Mary," John scoffed. brushing past the couple.
"We tell them that we realized our feelings while spending copious hours together in our dorm" Cas suggests robotically, a bit too stiffly with awkwardness.
When they arrive at the case they pose as their usual shtick, as FBI agents. Asking the local police about the investigation. Learning that there were two kidnapped boys, mother with her tongue ripped out, and a father drained of blood. Most likely a Vampire as they suspected. From the reports.
Dean chuckles lightly at the sight. Just barely audible over the light 1980s Christmas melodies filling the apartment.
Dean smirked back to his regular self "I think your right. We better step it up, I didn't have you fake date me, just to not to convince my dad that being Bi is fake."
Cas sighed “and do what Dean, sit in my room eating instant ramen by myself on Christmas.”
Dean knows that he couldn’t do this without Cas. He’s the whole reason for it though isn’t he; because Dean never once felt this kind of love before. The kind that John always talked about with Mary. This profound bond despite everything thrown their way. Castiel is it for Dean.
I called you dorky, strange, and weird as good as my compliments get. But I also yelled at you, blaming you for things that weren't even your fault. Slapped you in the face with all my problems, all my insecurities because it was easier to take it out on you than admit what I felt.
Dean nods nervously, so Cas grabs his hand steadying him out. He knows how much he hates lying especially between him and his brother. After the falling out they had when the two of them were younger. Cas isn’t sure what exactly had happened, but he knew it was bad enough that Dean drove almost four hundred miles from Sioux Falls to Lebanon just to get a hug from Cas. When the Winchesters came back the following year for Dean and his senior year however everything seemingly had been resolved.
Michael lets out a strangled gasp, the skin on his face cracks with lightning bolts of white seeping from his skin. As Chuck presses harder against the invisible force of his power the more alight the archangel becomes. His eyes turning a shade of white, the sight stolen from him, light flaming from his mouth. Covering his screams of pain. Cas watches as Jack takes in all in consuming the god powers and as he does, his stance gets stronger. Suddenly Michael bursts a million tiny flakes of white light dying out just as Lucifer did.
Jack watches as Lucifer sits at one of the tables in the library. A set of their cards he stole from their game night stash spread in front of him. He thought he was gone for good after last time but as it turns out he’s nothing but a cockroach. Just as Cas had explained when he told him Lucifer was back. Their plan a.
It gives Castiel room to open up about why he’s crying but doesn’t force it. Dean wishes he knew how to ask if his friend is okay, how to be there for him.
Cas nods at Jo. In return, she tips her beer bottle towards him with a smile. A mischievous glint in her eyes. Cas knows he's screwed. Remembering back to the drinking games they shared, with and without Dean. Her pouring Cas shot after shot till they were both stumbling messes. Always he seemed to surprise her with his Alcohol tolerance, and she when she ended up making out with Dean somewhere. That one stung, Cas shifted back returning his focus to Ellen. This is awkward.
Sam frowns with confirmation of this, “What about Chuck?”
This only served to confuse the angel more, as the hunter had spoke to him one way or blatantly ignored him yet treated him another. Lovingly even.
Sam sighs “Look Cas I’m not seeing any other way”
Dean’s voice booms off the walls of the bunker, his voice breaking at the end. Sam just stares at him mouth opening and closing trying to find a way to comfort Dean. As if words could fix this pain. Tears build in his eyes, and his anger dies as Eileen steps into the room signing something to Sam a worried expression on her face.
Cas looks to Sam pleading. He didn’t save Dean just so he could give up, it wasn’t the Winchester way.
Chuck flips the pages back and forth again, “There is nothing there,” his words are colored with confusion. Face filled with fear as he looks back up at them.
He studies the metal door. The bolts surrounding it’s exterior with a growing rust on them. Scrap pieces welded on parts of the door as if repairing holes in the metal. It makes Cas choke up, he forgot about the little things.
After greeting them, John makes his way to Bobby taking a beer from him. While Mary reluctantly places Melissa down to talk with Ellen.
Dean blinks, “What?”
“Then you’ll have no excuse to stay away” Dean hesitated looking at Cas under the glowing light ”and I’ll get to see my favorite college student every Tuesday and Thursday”
In reality he should have seen it coming, known Dean wasn't going to be any different.
Dean’s cellphone lets out a ring before he has the chance to say anything else. He looks back to Cas and lets out a frustrated puff of air before pulling the phone from his pocket.
- yesterday -
Nothing happens, not even a shift of wind. He snaps them again. Then rapidly snapping them over and over. Jack watches the fear grow on his face as it doesn’t work. The useless action, that once would release however much power he wanted. Now nothing but a human signal.
Dean pulls his newly healed hand away, his head no longer foggy from the drunken state he had been in moments ago. He suspected he has the grace to thank for that too, ”I saw your journal”
“I love you Dean”
The wound heals, death edges away from him. But Cas as he pours every last drop, he has of his grace into Dean’s very being. He feels it. Humanity taking root in him. The angel can feel as the inner coils of grace peel away slipping from his fingertips into his love. Castiel can feel himself becoming human. Still, he doesn’t stop. Allowing the last drop of his grace to fall from his hand. In a defining moment. Sealing up the final seam of Dean’s fatal wound. Maybe he just doesn’t want to be the one who lives forever anymore. Maybe he just wants to be human, feel things differently, taste without tasing just molecules. Feel hot water in the most basic sense rolling down him easing the tension from his muscles. Feel the warming touch, and the course yet soft touch of Dean’s skin against his if only for this moment. Maybe he wants to grow old and be human. It doesn’t matter Cas just knows he wants it, so he lets his angelic self go.
“Cas” Dean whispered, a slight chuckle “fall asleep buddy”
Nervousness encased his mind, what if Cas stopped coming. He couldn’t lose him, even as just a friend. Sure they only just became friends but he loved texting Cas way into the night, and that time they went bowling alley together had been fun. Almost like a date but no, Cas made it clear it wasn’t, Dean wasn’t even sure Cas was attracted to men or anyone for that matter.
Turning back around he sees Cas still sitting on the bed. Dean holds out his hand, “Come on angel”
"Really, I can believe that." Cas chuckles imagining a sleeping baby Dean. Pushing the longing away for a future Cas to deal with. He sets his mug down on the counter with a small clank, "Would you like some help."
“Fine” John pointed at Cas with a snarl “You broke him. Ruined him turned him into something wrong-“
Before Dean had time to extend his disastrous bisexual panic further, Sam snorted. Walking out of the room with a smug smile laminated on his face, when Castiel walked into the kitchen.
As far as lies go Dean thinks this one has perhaps been his best one.
Lucifer chuckles at their shocked faces, he redacts his previous story, “Pops was the one who left me out of the empty. Ya know before it burned up or whatever he did.” Jack tips his head to the side in lieu of Cas, “Anyway I’m sort of the new favorite now.”
“Cas” He heard Dean call. He froze. why would Dean come back? Didn’t he ruin things.
Bobby rolls his eyes, running a hand over the scruff on his chin, adjusting his cap, "That boy can be such an idjit. I ought to go down there and whoop him myself."
“Stop here” Jack calls out pointing to a church on the corner of Rose and Napier Street. Three stain glass windows depicting Jesus and two angels at his side, serve as a focal point above the large wooden doors, “This is it.”
Cas feels his heart quicken, leaping forwards to hold the shadow back from his son, he pleads, “Please Jack”
Cas knew this was it the last time he would see the love of his life. The last sacrifice he would make to save the righteous man once again.
“I’ll call you back Cas” he hardly managed to mumble clicking off his phone.
Sam rolls his eyes, throwing the pillow back. Landing at the head of the bed almost where it had been before, “Come on you two, you left just before Christmas dinner and you know how Bobby gets when he has to wait for food.”
A sad sorta smile graced Dean’s face a moment, before he began singing along, his fingers bouncing to the melody. If it were anyone else they would have missed it but Cas didn’t.
“D-Dean” Cas giggled as he drug him along against his free will.
There is a light conversation that brews among them every so often, occasionally turning loud with all the voices. Dean beams at the way he doesn't have to include Cas in the conversation because Cas knows them and he knows how to hold his own.
”I love you” Cas repeats, the room around them melting only their two souls connecting in the room. All the voices grew silent. Only those three words existing in his mind with his angel’s speech. For a moment all the pain is lost.
The two of them look at Dean not saying anything studying his every action. Dean however doesn’t look up, kicking his shoes against each other.
Since most of the feathers on his costume had a sheen of blue to them he wanted to incorporate that with his look.
Cas pouted as the ball he threw missed the bottles for the third time.
”I’m telling you Benny” Dean sprayed a swirl of whip topping on a drink ”it’s strange he orders a new drink every day and then doesn't drink it”
Cas looks at Dean, noticing the fine lines that have begun to form in crinkles around his eyes, “With you always”
Standing back, Cas beams at their work. Two large angels lay on the ground, wings overlapping. In such a way it appears the two angles are nestled together amongst their sets of grand wings.
Dean looks back to Cas watching his eyes gleam under the lights, as he looks from person to person. Recalling all the times Cas babbled about enjoying people watching, the time he brought him to the park, the smile on his face that was breathtaking. When they met, Dean sitting on the park bench after cheerleading practice waiting for his father. Cas slumping down beside him seemingly unaware of his presence, a flute case in hand. Till he saw the freckled face boy and nearly jumped out of his skin. Dean remember unearthly blue, that was the first thing he’d been met with.
John doesn’t say anything to that. He instead looks away angrily stabbing at his food.
Looking at Dean his straight best friend, this close. Snuggled beneath a shared red and white blanket on a hardly big enough loveseat. Their sides pressed perfect together. On Christmas Eve, watching the snowflakes fall. Ready to spend Christmas with the love of his life. The unrequited love of his life.
Luckily Sam is the first to arrive, and the three of them order drinks, after Dean embraces his brother in a tight hug. They chat idly for a time, though Dean doesn’t add much a few comments here and there but otherwise he just fidgets his eyes darting back and forth across the table. From the glossy floor beside the table to the bottles of ketchup and mustard in the center.  Cas links his pinky finger with Deans at some point during their conversation as if sensing Dean’s internal struggle. Sam keeps throwing reassuring looks his way as well. Which is helpful and overwhelming at the same time.
But tonight, he gets to be sad, upset, and completely fucking drunk. Just for one night.
"Thank you sir" Cas nods, stepping back from Dean as a sign of reconciliation. Looking at Dean in question "I do forgive what you have said to me, but for Dean..."
Then tugs Cas along to the living room, after grabbing them both a sugary treat. Followed by the rest of the family with their cinnamon rolls awkwardly shuffling along. Last enters John.
“We missed you too” Dean says and both Cas and Dean eye the brown haired girl standing beside Sam. Whom Cas assumes is Eileen.
“Nice of you to join us Cas” Bobby grins with a gruff sorta bravado, John gives a nod. The way his dad is limited with interactions with Castiel even when they are all together, gives Dean a bit more worry. His father has always been skeptical of their friendship since Dean basically drags Cas around like a date, even while they were friends. Though his dad never seemed to bring it up, there was just a wary dynamic there.
You. Dean thought, Benny knew that I was in love with you. Although he wouldn't say that aloud "It doesn't matter Cas, it just didn't work out."
Cas gives a reassuring smile, as they soulfully gaze into each other’s eyes the way they have been doing for years. Unintentionally lost to the rest of the world, “I know Dean”
Cas plops his bags down at the foot of the bed “Yeah, he wasn’t too bad.” In respect to John he didn’t compare, Bobby was gruff, protective, not mean. Though Cas doesn’t say any of that Dean gets it.
Cas cocks his head to the side in confusion, “How?”
”You two look happy together, I'm glad.” Bobby confessed as soon as the door clicked shut.
Dean continues “It’s the ending where you grow old, you get sick, and you just die.”
He holds out his hand, and Cas's slots in his warm hand, fitting them together like a puzzle.
"Two please" Dean holds up his fingers, smiling at the grey haired lady manning the booth. Her tag just beside her beaded necklace reads Melody.
Cas tips his head resting it lightly atop Dean's, and they sit just like that sipping down their cocoa, and watching people. On the same park bench where they met each other all those years ago.
Dean pulled back this time out of breath but still kissing small feverish kisses.
"Are you sure about this Cas? This won't be weird?" Dean swallows thickly, his eyes darting back and forth between Cas's watery blue eyes. Stopping them from walking up the pathway.
But surely Cas wouldn’t be that scared, or mad about Dean knowing about the makeup. After all he had been listening to the mixtape, he made him while doing his makeup.
“It’s okay Dean” Cas’s shrugs, wondered around the room after they released each other. In an attempt to ease the tension in the room he says, “I like your room it’s very you.”
Michaels says it as if he didn’t mean to say it aloud. The words puckering his expression. Torn between a father whom he was created taught and beaten to serve, and worship no matter the ask or the consequence, and the rebellious nature that Dean knows in his eyes made him no different – no better than Lucifer, The choice to act against the one he dedicated such faith to for so long. Dean could sympathize and understand that which made it all the more crucial to his grasp of what he would do.
Quickly they are swept into the kitchen, Cas smirks as Ellen slaps Dean in the back of the head, before pulling him into a hug.
Dean blinks. He doesn’t prefer either of Michael’s theories. Demons getting a chance at residing in heaven after all the carnage and pain they’ve inflicted upon the world. Nor cosmic beings, no longer existing after death. What does that mean for Cas and Jack for that matter. What about the beings that were in the empty when Chuck tore it all down? What happens to them? What happened to them? Or anyone else for that matter, heaven, hell, purgatory? A million unanswered questions circulate in Dean’s head with no resolve.
“I thought you would hate me, for the makeup” Cas said between hiccups “like Naomi did”
Cas scoots away from Dean up the wall leaning heavily into, the pain finally reeling back to him. Dean lets him go, answering the phone. Cas watches as the storminess grows on Dean’s face.
What? No.
Dean’s face falls, when he looks up from the empty space where the dog once was, he sees Chuck waving from the ditch. Then he too disappears, and Dean can feel his hope fall too.
“Yeah Dean” Cas whispered back, lip worrying between his teeth. It wasn’t like Dean to lose his rambunctious energy and turn all soft during movie unless something was wrong.
The three glare him down as he tsks. Ever the disapproving father. From the corner of his eye Cas can see Jack sink further into the seat in an attempt to hide his presence.
Cas shakes his head shortly, as Dean answers with a “no – nobody.”
Dean just nods as the two of them calm themselves. Cas holds out his hand for Dean to take, calmer now “So does that make us real boyfriends”
Dinner goes by easily. The two boys with their knees touching under the table. Occasionally feeding each other bites of their food. If only to get a rise out of John, each time, his face shades a deep red. Cas smiles on the inside, glad to get under his skin. Other than John there is laughter and joy.
None of them spoke much of what happened to each other. Entering the side door of the bunker, looking at the paint peeling from the walls, the cobwebs high in the corner of the ceiling where the walls meet. The pots left abandoned in the sink from their last meal. Sam worries a moment over Cas when he stumbles slightly. But Jack is quick to step in taking him to his room to rest and heal. Dean looks away.
“Son” John clears his throat “Is this about the girl you said you were bringing to meet us tonight? Could she not make it”
He bit his lip waiting for an answer watching as Cas’s eyes widened before he answered a breathy ”yes”
After everything he’s done how is he supposed to fix it.
“What if I do?” the vampire asks, skeptically “you’ll what let me go?”
With that the brothers mutter out a rueful “fine” and the brotherly banter stops, much to the rest of the family’s disappointment.
By now the girl has ran off again in a flurry, but Cas doesn’t bring himself to care.
Castiel looked at the small cup reading the nickname Cas which Dean assigned him ”Thank you, I like the shortened version of my name”
“Damn can you fix my car next” the girl practically whistled, smiling flirtatiously at Dean. She was attractive. Long brown hair, curves in all the right places, maybe he would have been interested if he did not have Cas beside him. But all he could think about anymore is Cas.
“I think we should be able to start it now” Dean backed away from the engine after a couple more moments, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
