His ride back to the hospital was plunged into contemplative silence. It was getting dark outside, the electric, colorful lights of shops and houses passed him by. The events of the last days bustled about in Dean’s head; it seemed they were pieces of a puzzle he tried to put together: Castiel sitting in the flowerbeds with bees all around him; the shocked look in his deep blue eyes when he had seen Aaron for the first time. His wrecked face when he had confessed his fears about being not good enough for Dean, his worries about starting a family of their own. The night they had made love and held hands, as if they were silently promising the other to never let go. Aaron holding a gun to Cas’ head. Dean racing through Sioux Fall to get him back. Cradling Castiel’s face in his hands, their tears of relief mingling… Dean bit on his lower lip as he started to realize what it all meant, what his heart was telling him. Swiftly, he turned the Impala around, headed downtown to run an errand, resoluteness bringing a tender smile to his mouth.
The stranger placed his palm on Dean’s chest, right above his heart, and nodded solemnly. He didn’t understand his partner’s sadness, nor the inner conflict he was battling with; his bliss was overpowering him, blinding out reason. So with his right hand, he intertwined their fingers, gave him a winning smile, and then swiftly abducted him to one of the nearby passageways which were less frequented by partygoers. He heard the man give a brief, surprised laugh, and it made him giddy with rapture.
On the next early Saturday morning, Bobby announced at breakfast that the backyard was a mayhem and needed some serious tending to, whereupon Dean and Castiel in unison volunteered to help Bobby. Soon the three men were outside, under a pale blue sky while the sun still gathered strength. The roof shingles of some sheds needed to be exchanged; also, some of the corrugated iron rooves, where Bobby kept all scrap cars under, had partly come off and had to be fixed again. The garden shed needed a new paint, as the old one was already coming off in flakes. Castiel sighed at the view of the chaotic garden and the deserted veggie beds, where there were more weeds than he could estimate, and lots of bulk garbage, that needed to be driven to the waste-disposal dump. Bobby shrugged his shoulders when he and the two men assessed the mess that they intended to order.
“It’s all right, Bobby. He couldn’t know,” he said quietly. Then he closed the photo album and put it aside pointedly, but he couldn’t tear his eyes from it completely. With his forefinger, he patted on it, wondering if he could let the topic ever rest. He sensed Castiel’s body heat right next to him, present like the feeling of sunlight on one’s skin, and he felt drawn to him, longed to find some peace in his embrace. It would have been so easy to let go of himself in Castiel’s arms, to inhale his soapy, clean scent, and take a rest for a little, a rest from all the things troubling Dean. A weary sigh escaped his mouth when he realized he couldn’t have that, that he had to continue being on his own.
"You believe in evil spirits?"he asked, their eyes glued to one another. Dean nodded and squeezed Castiel's hand, held it close to his heart. Pain corded up his throat all of a sudden as memories of John's death came to his mind. How could he ignore that a demon had robbed him of his father, how could he not believe in evil? If only Castiel knew about the nasty things out there... He gulped heavily and averted his eyes.
Castiel's heart missed a beat and his jaw dropped, as he watched Dean getting on his knees in front of him, right there in the muddy snow and the gravel, ruining his suit pants. He saw how Dean loosened the silver ring he always wore on his right hand, the wedding ring of his mother, as he had told him in a night of quiet, lengthy conversations. His fingers were trembling as Dean took his left hand with his right hand, looking up into his eyes with the sweetest smile Castiel had ever seen, his eyes practically sparkling with love.
had found
It was the moment when Dean greedily stroked along Castiel's abs and the smooth skin of his ribs, that Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's hips tempestuously and held Dean hard against him. Dean reclined his head and sought for Castiel's eyes – he was enraptured to find the hot-blooded glare he had seen in so many of his dreams. Castiel's jawline seemed more prominent than usual; his lust-clouded, glassy eyes devoured Dean, so that heat was boiling vehemently in his abdomen. Pleasure ran down his spine and tickled him. Goosebumps appeared on his forearms as he shivered delighted in Castiel's arms. He was ready to abandon himself to the ecstasy of being with him. God, he was so ready to welcome him, to let him in..
Again, Dean fell asleep in his arm, and Castiel was satisfied as he listened to the rhythmic pattern of his deep breaths. He reflected the day and couldn't allow sleep to close in on him yet. He was immensely glad Dean's family accepted him and that they all got along. Nevertheless, a dark shadow clouded his mind, made it unable to relax completely. He was worried about Dean and the quaint insinuations he had heard from John and Sam about Dean's former love life. On top of that, he felt unsettled, an itchy sensation bothered him, as if it was scratching at his brain painfully. Today had been an eye-opener to him; to see how Dean and his brother interacted, how they had talked and laughed with their father, even though things had never been peachy, as Dean had told him – it made Castiel think about his own family again, harder than ever, and he realized something was missing in his life. His heart ached terribly, and tears welled in his eyes, as a brutal melancholia took possession of him. He tried to imagine what it would be like if he could introduce Dean to his parents as well – the mere thought, that it wasn't possible these days, made him feel extremely alone and forsaken. Just to think that Anna would never meet Dean, and that they would have probably gotten along just fine, detonated the dam inside of him, and silent tears were streaming down Castiel's face.
Castiel was overwhelmed when he realized how cosy and easy it felt to sit like this with Dean and to eat ice cream. It was as welcoming and as natural as desiring him, and Castiel understood he definitely cared more about him than just physically. Of course, he felt immensely attracted to Dean, and he still wanted to kiss him passionately, but now he was just fulfilled with the need to get to know him better. Again their toes touched and Castiel let out a happy laugh when Dean's big toe moved against his, tickling him a bit. He darted a glance at Dean grinning at him, and it made Castiel's heart bleed with love.
graveyard, Benny Montague would be laid to rest. The brief thought crossed Castiel’s mind that Dean would miss his funeral. It brought a pained grimace to his face. He couldn’t imagine what that must feel like. He surely grieved Anna’s loss, but he was glad he could pay his last respects to her… For the entire duration of the ride, Castiel contemplated the world outside through the blackened window, beheld the dark clouds in the sky. The world seemed to commiserate with both families, was about to cry its rain down on them.
"They're trapped, right?" Sam retorted at last, shrugging with his shoulders. "I'd say we leave them here and come back later, then we can strengthen the trap. And we should totally call Bobby and ask him if he knows a way to close this damn gate again."
“You mean we could stay in bed all day…”, he finished Castiel’s train of thought, smiling when the other just nodded, his eyes closed, as he was momentarily overcome with the caresses Dean’s hand brought him. Dean nodded and smirked, started to stroke Cas with slow, hard moves. He left a trail of airy kisses on Cas’ throat, hummed appreciatively against his smooth skin.
Castiel yanked his head up with a start and stared at Dean with tear-stained, widened eyes. His mouth was slightly agape in awe as their eyes were glued to one another for a moment, trying to read the other's mind frantically. Dean felt deep sympathy coming to life in his chest, his heart made violent, aching pounds. His blood thudded loudly in his ears, he felt strangely attracted and hypnotized by Castiel, so he took one hesitant step after the other into the room and knelt down next to him – but Castiel skid backwards like a wounded, shocked animal. He averted his eyes and wiped the tears hectically away, combing through his messy hair with a nervous hand.
„That’s really sweet of you, Dean. Thank you,” Castiel rasped. Dean shrugged his shoulders.
And the sandwich joints of Saint Louis, God, had he missed them. He stuffed his face with stupid junk food every now and then, digging in with gusto. At some point, when he was chewing his sandwich and moaning appreciatively, Benny frowned at him and asked him if he and the sandwich wanted to get a room. Dean sulked a little – okay, so he liked cholesterol maybe a little too well, so what? But then a vision of the past snatched him, made him remember all those times he had spent with Cas in Bobby’s kitchen, cooking together in companionable silence. His heart skipped a beat then, then started aching bittersweetly. He missed Cas. And even though he tried to block out all the memories of him, all the worries about him, Cas always came back to his mind.
"Yes sir", Gabe and Castiel mumbled immediately, and both their shoulders were hanging down when they left Rufus' office and closed the door behind them. Gabe gave Castiel a weird sideglance as they were silently walking back to their own bureau, and Castiel's mood bettered once he met Gabe's mischievous eyes, and the frown of confusion left him when Gabe grinned at him. Castiel laughed and wagged his head slightly.
Curiously he squeezed that bud with the tip of his tongue and Castiel jerked fitfully, his hips stuttered forwards.
„Damn it, boy! You’re really good at this,“ Bobby said stunned.
It was like a deathblow to Dean’s heart. He felt sick, wounded beyond imagination. Instantly, desperation arose within him. Then he realized Anna Capulet was standing next to Castiel and she whispered something into his ear, while her cool eyes rested on Dean’s, an unspoken threat. Castiel’s eyes found his in the crowd, and the same gruesome knowledge must have befallen him, for he became deadly pale, looked as if stupefied, as if he was seeing a ghost with the name Dean Montague. And now that they were standing side by side, Dean recognized the alikeness of Anna and Castiel which only kinsmen shared, which he should have recognized as a warning sign before losing his heart to him – they had the same sharp nose, the same clean-cut features, unfathomable deep, soulful eyes… But even though they were so alike, there was no trace of Anna’s cold-heartedness to be found in Castiel’s grace, and vice versa. But for the surname of Capulet, Castiel was immaculate to Dean, the personification of everything he had ever wanted…
Castiel took his time when he was dressed; he had found some toast and ate a slice of it, while he sauntered through Dean's apartment. He knew the bedroom quite well by now; the comfortable bed in the middle of it, the beige, time-worn acoustic guitar Dean had talked about leaning against a wall; the small nightstand next to Dean's bed; Castiel didn't mean to pry, but he saw a book on one of the shelves, with a bookmark in it. He took it in his hands and laughed when he recognized what it was – Ken Kesey's "One flew over the cuckoo's nest". So, apparently, Dean had returned to the book after their phone call a few weeks ago, and the idea warmed Castiel's heart soundly. He smiled to himself when he regarded the bookshelves and the CD collection in Dean's living room, letting his fingers glide over those records they had talked about, feeling close to Dean again. It was past twelve when Castiel shut the door to Dean's apartment behind him – it was weird to be in Dean's apartment without him, and the silence in the rooms had unsettled Castiel, so he had left.
Now it was Alastair's turn to laugh darkly, and it discomforted Castiel a tiny bit when suddenly two bulky bullies appeared to both of his sides, cracking their knuckles as they looked down on him; he could feel their tower-like stinking bodies next to him, and his eyes met Alastair's again.
After work, Dean rushed home to get showered and dress up. Castiel had already texted him his new address, and to Dean’s delight, it was within walking distance. Not even twenty minutes separated him from Cas. When he was freshly shaved and showered, Dean worried what to wear, feeling all kinds of antsy and uptight. He didn’t want to give Cas the feeling that he wasn’t making an effort, but he also didn’t wanna overdo it. In the end, he decided for his favorite pair of jeans, a dark gray T-shirt, and a green button-down, from which he knew that it really brought out the green of his eyes. Nothing too fancy, but he felt comfortable and confident in these clothes.
"I've got..." he dug around in his pockets and produced rumpled dollar bills, "twelve lousy dollars. Cab costs at least forty."
“My knight in shining armor,” Castiel quipped, and it made Dean give a breathy laugh.
"I think you still have to prove your skills regarding massages", Dean quietly said, a lewd glimmer in his eyes.
Outside, only a few people were standing together in groups; they shared a cigarette or chatted loosely with each other, none of them paid attention to him. Dean’s heart was heavy. Lost in thought, he strolled on the nightly paths of the spacious garden, passed by well-kept lawns and trimmed hedges. The hands in his jeans’ pockets felt awfully empty, bereft. Castiel’s soulful blue eyes reappeared in his mind’s eye, again and again, like the sweetest torture on earth.
They conversed as effortlessly with each other as anything, and Dean heard himself actually laugh heartily at some point; he felt so cozy around those two. It was a sound that startled him, because it had been quite a while since he had laughed so carelessly, he couldn't even remember the last time. It had probably been before his father's death, and that thought made him frown again and made the smile on his lips fade.
"Where the fuck have you been? Are you too busy to answer your phone?" Sam complained. Dean scratched his head nervously; he could already imagine what Sam would think of his today's pastime.
Thanks for follows / favourites! I'm glad you're giving this story a try x3 Please review though; I need some thoughts on this at the moment…! A million thanks again to Angelphoenixwings14 for beta-reading this chapter as well! I bet I gave her a hard time with some clumsy sentences and comma faults –laughs embarrassed- she did a great job again and helped me improving some lines x) Again, if you find further mistakes, please let me know.
"You know me, Gabe, a gentleman never tells", Castiel grinned; the annoyed groan of Gabe cheered him up somehow. Castiel grabbed his cup of coffee and lay down on his sofa, his limbs thankful for the break. He became serious again when he collected the thoughts of the last hours, a wrenched sigh escaping his lips.
Castiel raised his eyes to Gabriel’s, didn’t know what to say. An all-consuming black hole opened in his chest, sucked the life out of him, every good emotion he had ever felt. He was utterly devastated, he knew he was tilting at windmills. Was there no hope for him? No chance to escape this life and be happy with Dean? Gabriel caught the glum mask of Castiel and smiled encouragingly at him. He squeezed his shoulder amicably, shook him a little.
Dean was floating on a cloud of dizziness and joy while his abs constricted again and again with each wave of his ongoing orgasm, he shook terribly against the other body. When he came around he realized he was kissing Castiel breathlessly, wetly, unrestrainedly. Appreciative hums vibrated against his sensitive mouth, tickled a little, and he pulled away, still huffing and puffing as if he had run a whole marathon. A shy smile came to Dean's mouth, for he was a little abashed to have come undone so thoughtlessly – but Castiel cupped his cheek gently and kissed him again, slowly and thoroughly, and when Dean melted against his moving mouth, he knew all was good, that he had done no wrong.
“I miss you, Dean… that’s what I’m saying.”
"Cas, no, don't be sorry, please, man. I do listen, and I do really care. I'm glad you share this with me. Feels kind of good to know you...," Dean admitted, wondering if it was the wine speaking out of him, enhancing what he was feeling inside. He was sure, he would have felt utterly embarrassed had he listened to himself sober. But the smile which came to Castiel's lips was worth a mint – it produced a steady heat in the depths of Dean's stomach, and it made him all flustered and edgy.
Dean hurried when he heard the silvery bells resound – it was the call for evening mass. When the small white church came in sight, its outer walls were shining like a beacon in the vanishing sunlight. The gold-colored turrets of the chapel reflected the gold of the celestial body. Dean wasn’t religious, but it appeared like a sign from above to him to see Gabriel’s church such illuminated and beautiful. Next to the closed, heavy wooden doors, he waited, heard the mass proceed inside. The congregation sang and prayed, then Gabriel spoke again, his voice echoing through the marbled hall. Dean leaned his back against the cool wall, closed his eyes. His heart was about to explode it was racing so fast in his chest. His fingers were twitching, eager to be with Castiel again and feel him. The commotion reached its zenith when the heavy doors opened at last. The churchgoers gushed out, bustling and chatting blithely, unaware of Dean standing next to the doors. He took a deep breath, tried to soothe himself. A frail smile darted over his lips as he entered the church at last.
The day was still early when Dean and Castiel said goodbye to Sam, the position of the sun hinted at lunchtime. They left the Impala to him, and Dean warned him to never drive drunk again; Castiel drove them back to the rehab-center, holding Dean's hand gently in his all the while (Dean thanked the automatic transmission of the Toyota for allowing them this sweet opportunity). The short ride was silent, each man absorbed in his own thoughts about what the future might bring them. Dean was somewhat astonished when Castiel parked the car and got out to accompany Dean back inside, but when they neared the reception desk, a particular premonition coursed through his mind, as if he was guessing what Castiel was up to. He kept his respectful distance as he watched Castiel walking over to Karen, smiling grimly at her as her mouth fell open in shock as she discerned his bruised face.
He picked Castiel up during the transition of day and night – purple gray dusk hovered through the utterly empty rooms of Castiel's cleared out flat, veiling it as if this place had already become a distant memory. Only the bed and a few chairs and the dinner table were left, the rest of his belongings were either sold or stored away. It was strangely quiet in the apartment. His dark-haired lover stood opposite Dean in his blank living room. The multi-colored sundown shone vibrantly behind him through the window; a duffel bag and a small backpack leaned against a wall – everything that Castiel would take with him. Tomorrow. Castiel smiled and hinted at the empty flat with extended arms, a wistful, but also content smile looming on his lips as he regarded Dean. Mischief twinkled in his eyes and he let his arms drop to either sides.
The first week back in Saint Louis had gone by in a flash. Dean was currently sitting in the police car with Benny, having a little lunch break. Both of them were devouring their wraps, talking in between chewing bites. Dean and Benny switched driving duty every day, and today it was Benny’s turn to drive the car; it gave Dean time to think and dwell on his inner life, once he didn’t have to pay attention to the chaotic city traffic. Now the car was parked in a quiet side street, and they had the doors opened to let some fresh air in and kill the summer heat within the vehicle. Dean thought it was time to address his plans about moving away, which were becoming more precise with every day – during the last weekend, he had searched the internet for affordable, well-kept apartments in Sioux Falls. He had told Benny about his vague plans of moving back to Sioux Falls, mostly because only Benny and his job kept him here at Saint Louis, and because he wanted to live closer to Bobby – but that seemed like a lifetime ago. He swallowed his bite and contemplated Benny, twisted his bottom lip between his teeth. Benny caught his look and gave him a meaningful glance.
Again Castiel nodded, a subtle smile coming to life on his lips as he watched Dean fiddle with the car radio. He inserted a square piece of plastic Castiel thought was named “cassette” and soon quiet, classic rock music spread in the small confines of the vehicle. It had a calming effect on them both, the sounds of the weather's tumult were far away. For the moment the atmosphere seemed even peaceful, and Castiel wished he was nothing more than a human too and that he and Dean had nothing to worry about. He regarded Dean with a pensive gaze, studying his delicate features as Dean stared absentmindedly at the radio, biting down on his bottom lip. How would their relationship look like when they were just two simple men? The heart of Castiel's vessel fluttered excitedly at the mere prospect, a yearning he didn't understand overwhelmed him. Maybe this reaction had something to do with the way Dean twisted his lip between his teeth, how troublesome and sad he looked.
was alright… Unfortunately, this mantra didn’t really seem to help. His head was like a battlefield, with bombs dropping on every thought, on every atom of his body. He could hear Castiel in the other room, packing his things mutely. All the familiar noises of the house Dean had gotten so accustomed to over the last weeks… he just couldn’t believe that his last day here at Bobby’s had come, that soon he would sit in his apartment in Saint Louis again, where it was always deadly quiet and lifeless.
He knew of the morphine Gabriel had hidden in his chapel, the deadly opiate named after the Greek god, which would erase all his heartache. Black despair unfurled on Gabriel’s features as he realized Castiel was dead serious. He crossed his arms in front of his chest, in denial of Castiel’s wish, of the words he had just heard. With caution, Castiel reached out his hand and touched Gabriel’s, the urgent request lingering in his eyes.
"Dean, that's absurd! Who's supposed to eat all of this?", he laughed and Dean sat down opposite of him, shrugging his shoulders helplessly. Dean put his elbow on the table and rested his chin in his hand, watching Castiel looking at him tenderly, a tired smile flashed over Dean's lips before he pursed them.
Sam pointed at the side notes near the pyramid top and met Dean's eyes with a gloomy look, heavy with meaning. Dean gulped heavily, feeling his throat constrict with apprehension. That wasn't exactly promising.
Strangely affected, John froze, frowned at Castiel. Amazement appeared on his face, he revealed a careful, honest smile, then lowered the gun.
Soon the bitterness inside of him faded away, and he was left behind with a hunch of emptiness and exhaustion when his fingers ended playing Chopin. His remorse was still there, but so diminished that Castiel felt he could breathe again without these guilt pangs. He couldn't control his decision for the next composition, and his fingers started performing Liszt's "La Campanella", an ambitious delirious composition that required his concentration. A soft smile came to his lips when he got the notes right and when the vivid bassline escaped his left hand. Green clear eyes emerged in his mind's eye while the song became wilder, and he applied more pressure to the keys. His smile widened when the cocky smile of Dean appeared in his mind after this horrendous long week, and Castiel felt alive again, relieved, revived.
Dean shrugged.
Dean and Cas chuckled at that; Cas slung an arm around their cheeky son and pressed him to his side, shook him amicably. Now Cas and Jack were both smiling down at Dean, who was still lying in his hospital bed – and Dean thought, he had never seen a more wonderful sight, his husband and their son smiling at him as if the meant the world to them. He harrumphed; a bit abashed about becoming so emotional suddenly, scratched the back of his head.
“Dean, stop it!” Castiel laughed and nudged Dean’s side with his elbow. Dean was standing behind him, his arms slung around Castiel’s middle – and he just couldn’t stop showering Castiel’s neck and shoulders with sweet, innocent kisses. However, Castiel had other intentions, namely preparing breakfast for them all. Somehow, he had managed to mix the batter for pancakes together, again and again interrupted by long, voluptuous kisses from Dean. And now he was chipping a mountain of strawberries, chuckling whenever Dean wanted to steal another kiss from him. Dean was in a good mood, and on top of that, stupidly smitten with Cas, so letting him be was simply out of the question. He bit into Castiel’s shoulder playfully then, grinning like a Cheshire cat. Castiel groaned unnerved, then they both laughed.

Go ahead and give her some love, she has a Destiel AU story of her own now and it's daaamn fascinating (Second Chances on fanfiction dot net). Now, back to our hurt Dean and therapist Castiel…
“Dean, you know I love you, but you’re unbelievably stupid. Do you wanna catch a cold? You can’t just go jogging in weather like this!” Castiel scolded. He left a soft kiss on Dean’s mouth to weaken his argument. Suddenly, Dean’s mouth was on his throat; Castiel shuddered with arousal when Dean playfully bit into the delicate skin, then his tongue left a tickling trail down towards Cas’ collarbone. His fingers dug into the flesh of Dean’s back, held onto him, when Dean kissed his throat open-mouthed, his hands grabbing Castiel’s ass firmly, moving him against his pelvis. For a second, Castiel just stood there, overwhelmed with the hot waves of lust washing through him. He heard his lewd moan, felt himself become lax with want, as Dean had his way with him.
Cas nodded, wide-eyed. He seemed overwhelmed, nothing but flustered, when Dean took his hand in his and surely led him through the crowd, towards their stage. Dean’s tension immediately vaporized once he maneuvered Cas to his piano and gripped his guitar thereafter. He sat down on his chair, plugged in his guitar, and checked his mic. He regarded the crowd, all their eyes resting on the two of them, gleeful anticipation was written all over their faces. Dean took a deep breath, then he turned his head to estimate how Cas was doing. Their eyes met, and Dean couldn’t help but smile, thinking how gorgeous Cas looked tonight. A beautiful blush of nervousness painted his cheeks pink, and the smile he gave Dean in return was coy and sweet. Dean winked at him and nodded, wordlessly told him he was ready. Immediately, Cas’ features became highly focused, a mask of concentration as he turned his attention to the piano. The first notes fell from his fingers effortlessly, and the crowd became silent.
„Yes. The course starts at six, and we also have to drive there. So, we better get ready soon.”
With closed lids, he said the next words, an ounce of humor in his undertone.
“Like you, you mean?” he asked. “I wonder in whose bed you
Sam Montague held his aching forehead with one big palm as he read through today’s headlines. Then he massaged the bridge of his nose, hoping it would help him against the arising monster-headache he was about to get. John Montague, his dad, would be pissed about the bad press. Trouble was brewing. Suddenly, Dean, Sam’s older brother, walked through the front door. He greeted Sam with a boyish smile, doffed his jacket and shoes. Then he strolled into the kitchen where Sam sat. Dean contemplated Sam for a long moment when he realized something was going on. Leaning over his shoulder, he read the newspaper articles laid out on the kitchen table. He grimaced and met Sam’s eyes, shrugging helplessly.
A few minutes later, Dean parked the Impala in front of Bobby’s house, and by now, Castiel looked as if he had stopped breathing, he was all uptight. Dean contemplated him, sitting there on the passenger’s seat exhaling against his nerves, and he couldn’t help thinking how much he loved this man. Smitten with affection for him, he leaned forward and left a lingering, heartfelt kiss on Cas’ cheek, felt how it made Cas smile. They got out of the car and walked up to the front door, hand in hand. When Bobby opened the door, they heard Mary crying terribly loudly in the background, ear-piercingly loud. Bobby gave them a meaningful look as he let them inside.
“Also, you know, someday it may not just be the two of us anymore. We might actually wanna start a family or something. That’s what I thought…”, he admitted sheepishly, scratched his neck nervously. The fond glance Castiel gave him then nearly killed Dean with glee; he watched him walk up to him, allowed him to engulf him in a tight embrace. He hugged him back, his arms around Castiel’s hips, and buried his face in the soft cotton of his shirt. With delight, he deeply inhaled the scent he loved so dearly, which made his heart widen and shrink at the same time. He sensed Castiel’s fingernails delving into his flesh, holding him with a vehemence that was speaking volumes. His heart thudded nearly violently, he was so happy and flustered.
and so comfortable when Castiel cuddled up to him and pillowed his head on Dean's stomach. He draped one arm around Dean's abdomen; Dean could feel the hot, moist breath bedewing his shirt gradually, but he didn't mind. He put his arm around Castiel's frame and let his other hand stroke through the wet strands tenderly. If this was a dream, he never wanted it to end. How insane to think about ever leaving Castiel – how could he? His heart thudded gently in his chest, utterly satisfied and tranquilized.
Realizing that Castiel was about to leave, he was so pissed at him, Dean got up, trying to reason with him. He didn’t want him to leave, didn’t wanna fight with him. In the entrance hall, he stood beside him, watched him getting ready to leave.
"That's reassuring, it's only an evidence that the training is efficient", Castiel replied. Then his hands started pulling Dean's pants leg up again, and soon he was gently touching the naked skin and flesh of Dean's calf and the places around his knee, testing the structure and the temperature of his leg. Dean observed him while he palpated his limb, still wearing a tiny smile on his kissable lips. He looked so beautiful, Dean couldn't tear his eyes away from him. Finally, Castiel felt satisfied, and he fixed Dean's clothes carefully, meeting his glance. It seemed to Dean that he was pleasantly surprised to find Dean's eyes resting on him, because his mouth fell somewhat agape, and he was almost certain he saw Castiel's pupils dilate slightly. It made Dean all antsy and warm inside, clutching his heart with pride.
"I hope you know what you're blundering into, man. We've got to make a plan or something. So, uh... listen. When we get there, there will be demons. A lot of them. You know, they'll look like humans, but trust me, they won't break that easily. Sam has lost his mind, it's a desperate, bone-headed move he's attempting. I fear it will most probably end in blood and tears. I've got to burn a devil's trap into the ground, we should have a flamethrower in my car's trunk. If that won't work, hell, I'll dig the symbol with a shovel! It will keep the demons at bay, they can't pass the lines I drew. You will have to help Sam somehow to keep the demons out of your hair. I will beat every son of a bitch while I can, but the devil's trap has total priority. We can only save our asses once I finished it. Got that?"
“It’s okay, boy, it’s okay,” Bobby cooed repeatedly, stroking Castiel’s shoulder compassionately. Dean watched them and felt like crying, too. He couldn’t stand seeing Castiel being so miserable. Dean was going to stay here, and he was going to make sure that Castiel would be alright, he decided at this moment. Come what may come.
Bobby shrugged.
"Here, we have a huge vibrant activity in that area the coordinates are indicating at. The weather goes haywire at the moment, there are temperature drops for days now, not to mention the low oxygen content in the nearer surroundings... I'm pretty sure there are demons there, probably gathering."
A good while later, Castiel decided, it was time to go home, because all of them (except for Sam) had to return to their jobs the following day. Dean was all sleepy and clingy when Castiel woke him up cautiously, and as they stood in the hallway again, about to say their parting words, Dean leaned against Castiel's body. His arms were slung around Castiel's neck, and he pillowed one cheek on Castiel's shoulder, mumbling drowsily "goodnight and thanks" to John and Sam. Sam grinned cheekily and shoved Dean's shoulder ungently.
Outside the wind had abated, a mere breeze rustled through the trees. The shower of rain had transformed into scattered, thick raindrops, and the distant grumbling of the electric storm moved on. Castiel was at ease, and he smiled happily to himself, as his fingers stroked along Dean's spine. This was real, it wasn't a wishful dream or a hallucination – he really held Dean in his arms again, they had made the other theirs again. A warm ray of the setting sun struggled through the opening clouds and fell on them, still intertwined and tangled up in each other's arms, on the dirty, cold ground. Castiel opened his eyes and blinked against the golden light of the sun, and Dean uplifted his head and found Castiel regarded him. Speechless he observed how the light refracted in Dean's gorgeous, green eyes, and vividness and love were rekindled in Dean's gaze as he stared at Castiel in awe, and Castiel smiled affectionately at Dean. He framed his lover's face with his hands and moved him down, so that their lips could melt into a slow, soulful kiss.
Quickly, Dean turned around, lifted the ready waffle out of the pan, and put another doll of batter in. He lowered the heat of the stove, turned down the music a bit, and took a seat right opposite from Cas. His lover jumped with a fright, making them both smirk amused. Dean reached out his hand over the table and gently took Castiel’s in his, kneaded his fingers playfully. A sweet, subtle smiled appeared on Cas’ mouth, his eyes glimmered with the appreciation he obviously felt for Dean’s attentive kindness.
"My sweat on you, your sweat on me", Castiel whispered, and wild images came to his mind's eye – Dean's length buried inside of him, how he shoved himself into Dean's body in return, their fingernails working like claws, their mouth left open in mute screams... He could only pant and cry out in pleasure as he came inside Dean, losing his eyesight for a few seconds as he rode out each hot white wave of tormented lust. He felt Dean bursting into his second orgasm as well, splashing Castiel's hand enveloped around his cock, as hot spurts of white come leaked out of him, his insides massaging him and closing in on him. They were shaking as heat waves usurped them, blanketing them, and Castiel let go of Dean's softening length, and his fingers intertwined with Dean's as both of them savoured the sensation of their ongoing orgasms. For a while they held still and enjoyed their togetherness, their bodies still intimately conjoined, and Castiel let his nose inhale the sweet scent of his and Dean's body fluids mixed with each other. Then Dean spoke again, and his voice sounded shaky, upset even.
Jo shoved Castiel’s shoulder amicably.
It was Monday, and the last week of Dean’s vacation at Bobby’s had arrived. And now that it was time to go, this was the last thing Dean wanted. After a long working day, Castiel strolled into Bobby’s house, looking somewhat worn-out. He sighed as he walked into the kitchen, where Bobby and Dean were just drinking coffee. While greeting the other man, he undid his tie and helped himself to a glass of cool water. Sweat stood on his brow, as he gulped it down greedily.
“You know, we’ve got all day. No plans, no chores”, he said nonchalantly. Dean let one forefinger slide along his lover’s chest, down towards his happy trail. He noticed Castiel sucked in a sharp breath when Dean’s forefinger sneaked under his boxer shorts, then he engulfed Castiel’s velvety, hot hard dick in a tight grip, squeezed it lightly. It made Castiel close his eyes, a low moan fell from his lips, and it sounded like sweet music to Dean.
Thoughts? Opinions? Let me know what you think! Oh, btw, I think I'll update once or twice a week…! As always, your feedback is appreciated x3
“Are you just gonna stand there, turned into a pillar of salt? Or will there ever be breakfast in this house again? What are you cooking?” he complained. At last, Castiel freed himself from his paralysis, Bobby’s words setting him in motion. He turned around to the kitchen counter again and continued chopping strawberries. He put a dollop of butter into the iron pan, and its sizzling sound filled up the kitchen.
“Oh, Dean, you should have said something. I’m keeping you from tidying out.”
Hey readers! Are you still with me? x) So, an update on a Wednesday, huh, weird – but tomorrow I'll watch the Hobbit and the next days will be busy too, so... x) I received some nice comments about this story recently, so thanks for your support! ImnotaSatanistIjustloveLucifer asked whether I will include Karen / Cas / jealous Dean more often - tbh, I dunno, we'll see! Deep gratitude to the lovely Faith Valconbridge for beta-reading this chapter, though her days are so stressful! Yadda yadda yadda, here's the update 8D
But somehow, Dean wasn't troubled, because he thought Castiel was looking right through him – and Dean knew how rare it was to find someone who accepted him despite it all, with all his drama and the perils that were a part of a hunter's life. Usually, he felt embarrassed after every emotional confession he had made; he didn't want to lose his face of toughness. However, when it came to Castiel, he thought he was free of that risk. Each time he had become talkative around him, he had never regretted it. Quite the contrary, it soothed him to the very core of his soul to let Castiel see who he really was, and to find nothing but acceptance and deep admiration in Castiel's caresses and the manner he looked at him. As he was on the verge of drifting off to sleep, he felt the smallest smile creeping up on his lips, glad to have met someone like Castiel.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean noticed Sam and Benny joining him with wide grins.
“Aaron is… he’s unconscious. I knocked him over with a fire extinguisher. But I have no idea when he will wake up again. I don’t know how much time I’ve got left.”
It was late in the afternoon when Dean closed up the shop and said goodbye to Benny. They would meet again later that night, once Benny had arranged everything for the party.
A sly smirk crossed Dean's mouth when he approached Castiel's apartment complex, the memory of this afternoon still vivid in his mind. His lips tingled at the phantom touch of Castiel's mouth on his... He was already looking forward to feel this gut-wrenching river of warmth running through his lower stomach, eating him up like an acid fluid. He had often heard of the expression to have butterflies in one's stomach, and now he thought he had that symptom as well. Though it felt rather like a downpour of a whole-body tingling sensation – it made his toes numb and his fingertips twitch, his head was spinning with too many released hormones... The sentiment was enhanced many times more the moment Castiel opened the door and smiled tenderly at Dean. Dean was strangled and gagged with the magnificent feelings taking over him, soon they became too much for him. He followed Castiel inside, absolutely permeated with an unspeakable glee.
Charlie squeaked with excitement, a big grin on her mouth.
-Gasps, sighs, smiles- Thank you once more for your awesome reviews, they're really encouraging me 3 I started writing this for my own pleasure, but it excites me to the utmost that I seem to be able to make those lovely idiots in this story tempting for you too x)
“Talk to me. What’s going on?” Dean prompted him to open up. Cas sighed and looked down, shrugged helplessly.
Dean’s heart stopped beating. He wrapped his arms around Benny’s limp body, pulled him closer. Their cheeks were touching. Dean felt Benny’s scratchy stubble, inhaled his spicy tangy scent, which always smelt like leather and stony water – he thought he would lose his head. That he was going to explode. He felt Benny die. Felt how his breathing stopped. How the weight in his arms became heavier. He tried to breathe through several times, compose himself. To no avail. Then the earth-shattering scream went through him, like lightning, about to rip him in two. He screamed against the pain, screamed until his lungs felt as if they were on fire. It was a primal scream, filled with so much agony. Benny was dead. Dead! Anna had killed him.
“Where do you wanna go? I thought we could walk along the fields parallel to the highway,” Castiel proposed. Dean nodded absentmindedly, watching a car passing them by. They pursued the path next to the highway, and not a single soul was in sight. For a while, they walked in silence, looking around, and studying the environment. The sun was setting in the distance, and the mellow evening light tinged everything in orange, pink, and red. The cornfields were swaying in the soft breeze, which was blowing. The landscape looked peaceful and immaculate. Dean felt as if he and Castiel were walking through a timeless world, a paradisiac place they had accidentally found.
"Let me give you a lift. You can't drive like this, and I won't let you call a cab", Castiel murmured quietly instead. When he uplifted his head and searched for approval in Dean's hazy glance, he saw a sweet smile on these kissable lips and Dean nodded slowly and replied a simple "Thanks." A minute later they stepped outside and Dean staggered next to Castiel in front of the brothel – the chilly night's air met them, the air was damp with the late springs' weather. Castiel felt immediately awakened, but Dean shivered, as sleep-deprived and drunk as he was. They sat down in Castiel's grey Toyota, a small car Castiel had grown rather fond of. When Dean fastened his seat belt Castiel noticed Dean scoffed and gave him a broad grin. Castiel felt a frown on his forehead when he backed out of the parking space and drove along the empty streets.
"Good thing I invited you over, then." Castiel concluded, lightening Dean's mood. He nudged his therapist's shoulder friendly and smiled at him.
,” he confirmed, again and again.
Dean gave a jerk when Cas placed his hand above Dean’s, which was resting right over his stomach. He squeezed Dean’s hand once, affirmatively, then pressed his head deeper into the pillow to get comfortable.
“I think I need a little shut-eye, Cas,” Dean declared, whereupon Castiel got up and walked to the door. He looked somewhat confused and ruminative, but when he turned around at the door, he beheld Dean with nothing but affection in his eyes. He leaned against the doorframe for a moment and regarded Dean. His piercing knowing eyes met Dean’s, and again, Dean thought they were seeing right through him, that Castiel was understanding his reasons and motives without a word being said. It made him blush and scratch his head abashedly. He felt kind of naked when Castiel looked at him like that, with nothing but worship and understanding in his eyes.
Dean, permeated his mind, and he clenched his jaw strongly. He shoved his finger inside until the hilt, and Dean winced and mewled agonized as he welcomed him within his body.
„Just wait, Cassie, until Dean is on stage. I bet he’s stealing everybody’s thunder tonight.”
They kept talking effortlessly, and after one hour, Dean thought he knew Castiel for a lifetime. Once he got to know him better, he actually laughed about the way he spoke, with grains of clever irony. Something lingered in the air, though. Something that alluded to more than friendly interest in one another. Every cautious look, every careful smile made Dean's chest narrow. Sometimes it was difficult to breathe when Castiel squeezed his hand or smiled beautifully at him again. They were currently discussing their taste in movies, and a passionate debate took place when they defended their favorite movies – when suddenly, an electric light aroused their attention. They both turned their heads and realized, a bakeshop set to work. There was also a convenient looking café that belonged to the store. When the baker unlocked the front door, Dean's and Castiel's eyes met.
“Yeah, and he sounds like a bear in hibernation”, Bobby quipped. “Let him have a little rest… from what he told me last night, this past year must have been hell for him. I just hope this Aaron guy leaves him alone from now on.”
changed between them for sure. It was impossible to detect what differences that evening had created, and Dean couldn't lay his hands on it and explain what had transformed – but the alteration was tangible, so much that it made his body twitch and vibrate with alertness, overpowered by sweet exhilaration. Castiel was even more attentive than usual, and there was the softest gleam remaining in his eyes all the time whenever he looked at Dean. Their behaviour around one another was as effortless and as honest as possible, Dean didn't even think about restraining himself any longer. He let go of all the inhibitions he had kept in his mind whenever he had spent some time with Castiel, and now he showed him who he was utterly blatantly. Castiel seemed to respond to Dean in an equally delighted way, he opened up to him so naturally, it felt like breathing. Though Dean often felt his breaths stop and stumble when he felt another wave of infatuation carrying him away, becoming speechless due to Castiel's charming being.
Dean sighed, willing the lump forming in his throat. Deep down inside of him, he knew that Sam was right. But when then had Castiel looked at him like that, as if he wanted to jump on his bones right there and then? And why did it feel so good to spend time with him and talk to him? Dean stared outside and regarded Castiel conversing with Bobby. Dusk was creeping out from underneath the bushes, and moths were flying near the lamp lit near the house. Castiel’s eyes were following the flight path of fireflies flashing up here and there, and even from the distance, Dean could see the fondness within Castiel’s eyes, the little smile on his kissable mouth. Again, he sighed and closed his lids. He felt the pain thriving within him, getting a hold of him again. He thought fate was a little unfair to him, presenting someone like Castiel to him, and simultaneously making it impossible for them to be together.
“And here I was thinking
Anna’s heart was pounding. The blood in her ears was roaring. Dumbstruck, she stared at Castiel, who had just admitted he had gotten involved with Dean Montague. Their common arch enemy. How was this even possible? Castiel – who had lived as a celibate for years now, who was supposed to become a priest by next week. Anna burst out with her thoughts.
"No, you didn't. We're good, Dean. Have a good night," he replied with his dark voice, making Dean's skin crawl. A hot sensation flooded his insides, his spine tingled, his heart leapt into his throat. He nodded and returned the smile. "Thanks, Cas. You too", he said, and Castiel winked at him and left him with his late dinner and Sam on the phone.
“Hm, too bad I was born on a Wednesday, you little angel, you,” Dean joked with a grin, seeing how it made Castiel grin, too, and roll his eyes at him. “That sounds impressive, buddy. Big words.”
The need to feel Castiel as intimately as possible became worst on Thursday, the day before they intended to leave the clinic behind for good. Castiel had dropped in this early morning to kiss Dean ardently and hold him closely pressed against his chest, his arms slung around the older man's back. When Dean had withdrawn, his legs jelly-like and his breathing shallow and erratic, he had seen that specific look on Castiel's face again. How prominently his jawline protruded, underlining his masculine throat. There was heat in Castiel's glance, and it produced constricting excitement in the depths of Dean's tummy.
Dean shrugged and took both items out of Castiel’s hand, placed them down next to them on the sand.
“You’re right, Dean. If I was there, I could take care of you…”
“Do you remember when I told you I wanna do some kind of charity work?” he said.
? What happened to
“So, when you told me you were falling in love with me,” Dean heard himself mumble, his throat laced up with ache. He couldn’t even look Cas in the eye, thought all of this was a nightmare, a thing of his imagination, which would soon pass. He would soon wake up and be somewhere with Cas, where neither of them had to leave, where neither of them had insecurities about letting the other love him. There was a firm, meaningful kiss suddenly pressed against his forehead – Dean closed his lids and cherished the sensation of Castiel’s lips lingering on his skin.
A while later, Dean and Jack were munching on microwave-popcorn and watched the original Jurassic Park from the nineties. They had to lower the volume in order not to wake up Cas. Dean kept an eye on Jack, wondered if the boy wasn’t too young after all to watch a movie like this. Even he, as an adult, was still scared shitless about these damn Velociraptors, which were clever enough to open doors with their claws. But Jack didn’t seem afraid at all, rather thrilled, on the edge of his seat. He kept ranting about the different types of dinosaurs and what they were capable of, and it astounded and amused Dean greatly.
"Off you go! Have fun, stay sane and healthy, yada, yada, yada. Oh, and Castiel? Good choice," she said, winking at Dean mischievously. Castiel huffed a laugh and turned around. He strolled to the entrance with a flabbergasted Dean, to their new stage of life.
His eyes glanced at the clock in his living room, it was nearly two a.m. He basked in the slowly ceasing pains of his body, as if they were steeling his will. All at once he heard a key opening the apartment door quietly, and someone entered his home. He got up and saw Dean in the entrance hall, stopping in his motions as soon as he had seen Castiel in the darkness, standing still like a statue, looking at him mutely. Castiel observed Dean putting the key aside and sliding out of his shoes. His eyes darted briskly over Castiel's face, and he thought he could see a tiny smile on Dean's lips – those lips he hadn't kissed in hours, and at that realization hit him hard, he thought he was starving, in want of Dean's caresses.
He can't help but tremble and sigh with pleasure when he hears Dean reaching his climax, his mind is at ease when he practically feels the satisfaction rumbling through Dean's body. He wishes dearly to hold him, to feel his body in his arms and to come home to him. Unfortunately his obligations keep him from doing so; he still has to figure out what do to with the angle tablet, he has to find a place to hide it safely – only then can he return to Dean. He smiles softly when he hears Dean saying goodnight to him, praying he is sound and alright.
For a second, he munched his cheeseburger, wondering what to reply. He gave Benny a meaningful look, a boyish smirk on his mouth, then he typed away. Benny rolled his eyes.
Dean nodded pensively. It annoyed him to do nothing about the demons, he hated walking away from a fight, but it couldn't be helped. He held out his palm and raised his eyes, grumbling "car keys" sternly. Sam fumbled for them with a theatrical sigh, rolling his eyes at Dean.
“Tell you what. Why don’t you come over later and join me and Andrea? We’re having a nice barbecue tonight, and we can catch up on everything and you tell me what’s going on. Sounds like a plan?”
Dean couldn't help but become completely rigid once Castiel's wicked mouth traveled to the head of his cock, leaving airy kisses there as well. Scorching heat coursed through Dean's body, he felt his cheeks blushing vehemently. A wayward hand of his moved to his sweaty forehead, pressed hard on feverish skin as he felt on the verge of losing control. The world was spinning to and fro; he felt his heart racing in his chest wildly. Hesitantly, Castiel began licking along his delicate foreskin – his pace was terribly slow, but he seemed to know what he was doing. He had Dean writhing in the sheets within seconds. The coldness of the drying saliva made him shudder; he was rewarded for his patience, as Castiel's fiery, narrow mouth closed in on him oh so carefully. As he glided smoothly inside this tunnel, he could sense Castiel's sensitive tongue on the underside of his erection, how his palate squeezed him maddeningly. Instinctively his hands reached out when the tip of his cock pressed against the back of Castiel's throat and as he felt him hum against his pulsating member. The vibrations drove him insane while he sunk his fingers into soft, moist strands of Castiel's hair. He couldn't help but tug at them gingerly; between his spread legs, Castiel's head started bobbing up and down in a wonderfully gruesome speed. His tongue licked along Dean's length and he deep-throated Dean often.
Now another notion crushed him with its weight, as he longed to present Dean to his family as well; he wanted his parents to know that he had met someone important, someone who had changed his life, who had redefined him altogether. Castiel lay awake for a few more minutes, urging himself to calm down again. He was just tired out, he convinced himself. It did him the world of good to snuggle up to Dean and to feel the heat of his naked body warming him, as if he was unconsciously consoling him. He held on to Dean tightly, as if he was his anchor tying him to his sanity, and a great part of his pain was uplifted from his troubled heart. The drying tears on his cheeks were brushed away, as he buried his face in Dean's soft, short hair and inhaled his pleasant scent.
"So... when will I see you again?", Castiel asked, too tired to hide his need of being with Dean again. There was an awkward pause of silence, and it made Castiel quite insecure, so that he gnawed at his bottom lip nervously.
It didn't take them long to end up in bed again, as Castiel gently shoved Dean down on the mattress; both of them were laughing when the itchy crumbs of their breakfast delved into their skin. Dean's laughter became breathy, then it stopped and changed into breathless whispers and high-pitched sighs, as Castiel had his way with him. He took his time to cherish Dean's body, kissing and licking and biting his torso, every sensitive spot he was coming to know. He gnawed at Dean's clavicle, let his fingernails bruise Dean's smooth skin, and the man underneath him was slowly starting to lose it. Though they groped each other and though most of their kisses and bites were rather rough, a different notion seemed to have filled their heads, seemed to waft through the air. Their first times had been untamed and underlined with pent-up desire – this time they allowed themselves plenty of time, exploring their bodies in an unashamed, exciting way. Castiel loved the way Dean was writhing and sweating in the sheets, pressing his body against Castiel's sucking lips, his teasing tongue, his scraping teeth. Dean's hands were entangled in his dark hair, tugging at the strands quite desperately when Castiel went down on him, taking his rock-hard length into his mouth. Castiel was pleased with himself when he realized he was getting better at this, finding the ways to please Dean easier now.
"Dean... is there anyone whose ass you didn't save? I mean, how are you doing it? I hardly manage to handle my own life, but you... you're basically the glue to your father's and your brother's life."
“How come you have a key already?”
"I'm all ears. What do you suggest?"
He felt Castiel’s supple lips moving over his, and he inhaled shakily. Then Castiel was kissing him with gusto, his mouth gliding together with Dean’s hotly and affirmatively. A soft moan escaped Cas as their lips touched again and again, coming together for one kiss after the other. It was wild and overwhelming and wonderful. Castiel’s hand then slid down Dean’s cheek slowly, tickled Dean in an arousing way. Castiel’s fingers grabbed the back of Dean’s head and pulled him closer, intensifying their kisses. Passionately they kissed, slowly and deeply, and Dean started to lose every coherent thought. His balance became a memory in the back of his mind, as his knees turned to jelly. He dispersed completely in Castiel’s kisses, loved how he abused his mouth so perfectly. A knot in his abdomen was unraveling, and it filled him with extreme tingling heat. He could have kissed Castiel forever, it felt so good.
Then his eyes wandered the outer corner of the porch which took a curve like an L-shape. He paused in his movements. Someone was lying there motionlessly. It looked like a man dressed in blue jeans and a plaid blue-white shirt. Dean didn’t have to think twice – he instinctively knew it was Cas. He rushed forward to man. It was like a dagger to his heart when he realized it truly was Castiel. He looked awfully pale, laying there unconscious. His eyes were closed as if he was sleeping, but there was a sickly hue to his skin tone. Dean assumed the worst. He had come too late. An ache was forming in his throat, strangling him with a tight grip. He gulped against the knot as despair finally defeated him. He let his head hang down. An immense weight was on his shoulders suddenly as he fell to his knees beside Castiel. His eyes fell on the empty syringe in Castiel’s loose grip. Overcome by the realization of what must have taken place, Dean bit on his bottom lip, fought against the gut-wrenching scream which was building up inside of him. What had Castiel done?
Castiel's voice was quiet and contemplative, a fond spark gleamed in his eyes. He even smiled tenderly as the memories seeped through his mind. Affection pumped through Dean's heart, he was deeply moved by Castiel's explanation. He comprehended how much he meant to the other man, that he had left such an impression on him that Castiel rather sacrificed his morals than living without him – even if only for a few days. Absent in mind, Dean grasped the hand Castiel had laid on the gear shift, squeezing his slender fingers gently.
do this again, God help me, I'll kill you myself, Sam! Have you any idea how worried I was?" he exclaimed furiously. Sam gritted his teeth, Dean saw his jawline stiffening. He averted his gaze and nodded submissively.
Dean returned to his room when he was done with the workouts for today. He stopped dead in his tracks once he had opened the door – someone was lying in his bed! Outside, it was still broad daylight, for the days became longer and longer as the spring slowly transformed to summer. The person lying in his bed and sleeping like a log didn't care about the warm sunlight though. A wistful smile graced Dean's lips and he walked inside, closing the door without a sound. Hesitantly, he approached the unconscious body on tiptoes – even his own breaths sounded awfully loud, so he breathed deep and brokenly to reduce the noise level as much as possible. He halted next to his bed and looked down at Castiel sleeping in his bed, as innocent and as beautiful as an angel.
“I know, Sammy. I was scared, too. At first, I was just trying to get to Cas and save him from Aaron. And then that damn tornado came and wreaked havoc everywhere, and there were so many wounded people that needed my help. I haven’t seen that many ambulances in all my life. And then I was in the hospital, waiting for them to have a look at Cas, and…,” he stopped, his throat corded up with emotion. He was overtired, at the end of his strengths. It had been a damn long day.
I hope with all the texting in the messengers, it was clear who was who.
"How do you want it?", Dean asked ambiguously, resting his head on his palm as he set his elbow up. In his bright green eyes a playful notion glimmered, and Castiel felt as if in a dream. He bit his lower lip to constrain himself; how much he wanted to kiss these fine pink lips, press his against them to kiss Dean fervently... However, the urge to get to know the person beyond this body became intolerable, and he smiled when Dean joked "Fun facts or a curriculum vitae?", making Castiel laugh softly.
"Jeez, Cas, you scared me to death! Why are you still awake?", Dean asked nonchalantly and took off his jacket. He had just hung it up, as Castiel felt his body move towards Dean, still as deadly and as silent as possible. Something had taken over him, the switch inside his head had been flipped. He was seeing red, and all his thoughts were bent on Dean alone; he stopped in front of him, and their eyes met through the dim light of the night. He saw Dean frowned and the smile vanished from his mouth. Castiel breathed in several scents that were lingering on Dean's body, and it drove him mad. His heart thudded forcefully in his chest, as he observed himself, how his hands came to rest on Dean's clothed pecs and how he shoved him against the nearest wall ungently. Insanity rained down on him and clouded his thinking, as he beheld Dean's eyes widen as they searched for his. He pressed their bodies together in one harsh line and came as close to Dean's face with his own as possible. The stench of somebody else was gross and it formed aching knots in Castiel's stomach. A sweet flowery perfume, which indicated a woman, and a musky, spicy smell that made Castiel think of a man – they mixed with the clean odour of Dean's sweat and the usual lovely scent of his body. Castiel's blunt fingernails delved into Dean's clothed upper body, keeping him in place while he invaded his personal space. Dean's eyes flickered nervously and he licked his bottom lip, his eyes never leaving Castiel's.
The other guy to his right side smiled shyly at him; he was probably a little bit younger than Dean. His lengthy hair was dirty blonde and he had a phenomenal long nose. If the guy with the freaky haircut was the personification of rock 'n' roll, the other seemed like the epitome of country music.
Ahhh, you're all just wonderful! Thank you once more for your lovely support! It is really, really helping! Especially now, I'm struggling with the current chapters (just finished chapter 36). If there's anything you'd like to read or if there are some mistakes I made or whatsoever, just let me know, and I'll try my best.
Castiel blinked at him slowly, a friendly gesture, which made Dean calm and restless simultaneously. He watched in awe how Castiel disappeared and closed the door behind him, leaving Dean all to himself, gazing after him absentmindedly.
Dean filled up the plates with the food he had prepared. He opened the kitchen window and called for Bobby. Knowing Bobby a little too well, Dean didn’t fill up Bobby’s plate, but put the lid on the pan to keep his food warm. With a smirk, he arranged Castiel’s food and decorated it, feeling a little silly. When he brought both plates to the table and sat down next to Castiel, he grinned at the baffled and amused expression, which appeared on Castiel’s handsome features.
“Is that your girlfriend?”
Castiel pulled away gently and pressed his forehead against Dean's. At long last, Dean raised his eyes to him and drowned in the clear lavender-blue for a second – the tenderness with which Castiel beheld him was too much to endure, especially combined with the way Castiel's fingers dug into the soft flesh of his hip, pulling him closer and closer, bringing their naked bodies together naturally... Dean's breaths stuttered, his heart leapt into his throat, as he succumbed to the steady, confident look Castiel gave him. How weird to be put under his spell so easily. There was nothing Dean could do about it, he didn't even want to try to escape Castiel's charm. It did him good to be looked at like this, like he was the most important person on this planet.
"Are you wooing me, Castiel?" he asked with a come-hither look, laughing inwardly when he saw Castiel's blush deepening as his eyes darted over his face restlessly. His mouth fell open and a smile twitched at his corner of the mouth as he replied to Dean's stare feisty.
Castiel couldn't remember the last time he had been so annoyed with work, this Tuesday felt like hell, and the hours seemed to drag on so slowly that it was starting to unnerve him. He and Gabe were working through the paperwork of yesterday's event, recording statements of witnesses and labelling scraps of evidence; one hour passed in which they had to answer the detailed questions of a FBI committee, and Gabriel had to explain why he had shot the bank robber.
"Well, there's work, and then there's work, oh... and Sammy promised to visit me, so I guess I'm booked out."
"Yeah, it's me," he answered guiltily, receiving snarled questions in return.
"What kind of fed drives a Japanese women's carriage?", Dean teased and Castiel let out a laugh.
„Come, let’s get it over with,” Dean proposed. He grinned at Castiel and wiggled his eyebrows stupidly, loving how it made Castiel laugh a little. The dark-haired man nodded and let go of Dean, sighing extensively when he walked up to the passenger side.
"You can't do that to me, Cas... You're so good to me...", Dean whispered and when he did it, he uplifted his head so that he could breathe his hot moist breath into Castiel's ear, making him constrict violently as his body concentrated on each movement of Dean, so close, so dangerous, so stunning... Dean bit into his ear lobe and his teeth nibbled on it playfully, and before Castiel could protest, Dean's skilled mouth moved lower, left wet open-mouthed kisses on his neck. His tongue was darting out to lick the skin just above Castiel's shirt collar and Castiel's fingers seized Dean's back forcefully, searching for support as his knees went weak. A low moan escaped him when Dean's warm fingers crawled under the hem of his shirt and stroked his stomach and chest lovingly, with so much attention and expertise that Castiel became a groaning trembling mess under his ministrations. It cost Castiel all of his willpower to let his hands touch Dean's muscular fine pecs and to shove him gently away.
When his eyes subconsciously glanced at the glass walls, he realized Castiel was still surveying him with interest. He looked away and kept sulking. After a while, his teeth started to chatter on their own accord. He was trembling violently, but he refused to talk to Castiel again and ask him whether they could make up and get the heaters started again. If anyone in the world was the most stubborn person, it would be Dean Winchester. He hugged himself and rubbed his chill arms over and over again.
Dean walked around the house, searching for Jack. Dinner was ready and already waiting for him at the kitchen table. Jack often played in the garden, gathering stones and sticks, or playing in his child-like fantasy world as he acted as if he was a knight or a treasure hunter. Countless times, Dean had secretly watched him from the porch, smiling to himself about Jack’s endearing behavior. That kiddo really had an active imagination and lots of energy.
They sat down around the garden table, and had a few beers, and they quickly got to talking as if no time had passed at all. Dean felt stupidly happy in their company, remembered how good it was to spend some time with his friends. Dean knew Benny even before he had met Andrea, so he knew all about how they had fallen in love, how Benny had gushed about her for countless days on end… they had moved together and married a year after they had met, and from what Dean witnessed, they were the cutest, most affectionate couple he had ever seen – except for Sam and Jess, perhaps. In their pleasant company, he forgot his own worries and the melancholy about missing Cas. Of course, both Benny and Andrea grilled him about Cas and wanted to hear all juicy details, which actually made Dean chuckle somewhat embarrassed. But he recounted most of the happenings of the last weeks, leaving out some explicit content, of course – and now, dwelling on these weeks didn’t hurt at all, but brought a lovestruck smile to Dean’s mouth, making him feel blessed to have met someone like Cas. He heard himself raving of Cas endlessly, revealing unintentionally how obviously in love he was with the other man.
Castiel bent over him then, held Dean's face in both hands and pulled his head up for an ardent kiss that soon became sloppy and desperate. On any other occasion, Dean might have felt embarrassed for being so needy, but in this moment he couldn't stop moaning lewdly into Castiel's mouth. He uplifted his pelvis as an unmistakable request. Every breath they were still separated from each other became torturous. Castiel pulled back, his heavy-lidded eyes set on Dean's. He felt him lining up his cock along the crack of his ass, how his hands gently but determinately tugged his butt cheeks apart. Dean's whole body tensed unwillingly when he perceived the fat, round head of Castiel's erection pressing against his wet hole, slowly but surely penetrating him. His hands grasped Castiel's hips automatically, guided him and brought him further inside. He couldn't endure the heated gaze Castiel beheld him with, and soon, everything was becoming too much. He was so sensitive, it felt so sensual and filthy to be filled out this way... His head dropped to the ground and he stretched his throat, offered it confidently to his lover, who left open-mouthed kisses on Dean's skin.
"Whatever, man."
"What plans, spill it out! And who's Azazel?" he hissed. The answers never came. Before he could do anything about it, the demon used Castiel's fist to hit the possessed therapist right in the face. The body staggered a little backwards. Dean held his breath as he regarded the given sight in silent horror. Blood was dripping down from Castiel's nose, ran darkly and thickly over his plump lips. The black eyes stared at him threateningly.
", John spoke pensively, awakening Castiel out of his own world. He let his eyes scan John's and Sam's faces, trying to understand that he was the reason for Dean's state, and that he must have been some sort of exception in Dean's life. He could already feel the museful mien he was wearing as he thought about this, then he startled the moment he felt John's hand grabbing his, which still lay on the table, and pressing his fingers appreciatively.
Their eyes met. Benny was grinning, and Dean rolled his eyes.
"Yeah, okay. Thanks, Cas. Oh, by the way, I'm getting the cast off tomorrow," he said, beaming with delight. The ward physician had informed him he would get a metallic support bandage instead, but it was a substantial progress for Dean's healing process. It meant he would soon learn to use his leg again; he would be able to put weight on it and be more flexible. Castiel sat up all at once, excitement appeared in his eyes.
It was a heart-stopping moment as Dean felt the thick, long outline of Castiel's erection touching his lower stomach through the various layers of clothes, hammering with the same urge of blood. He was so hot, so hard, Dean was about to lose his mind. Unrest and impatience had their way with Dean, so he let every thought of control go; Instead he watched himself carrying Castiel to his bed, laying him down gently, only to collapse right on top of him, his hands supporting some of his weight. Everything was blinded out – Dean didn't care about the sunlight nor the chirping birds outside, he didn't listen to the soft murmur of the wind sifting through the canopies – the sight of Castiel splayed out in bed, right under him, was enough to make Dean forget the world and time itself. The way he breathed in staccato, how his eyes were glued to Dean's in awe, reading his every thought effortlessly. How brittle and loveable the smallest smile on his mouth was... His body seemed so ready and willing, his thighs opened up to Dean invitingly so that he could glide in between them. Dean's mouth was watering as he let his fingers touch the fiery skin of Castiel's torso, shoving the shirt upwards.
“Cas, what the hell are you talking about?” Dean said with a strained voice, speaking against the strangling pain. His fingers wandered into Castiel’s raven black, smooth hair, twisted some strands mindlessly.
“Meet me at Gabriel’s chapel in thirty minutes. I’ll explain everything to you then.”
“You know,” he said with closed eyes, enjoyed Cas’ fine subtle caresses, “it’s always been the same for me, too. Whoever I’ve been with, they usually only wanted the money or the fame. And those, who truly cared about me couldn’t take the heat of being together with a Montague. I get it. It’s risky being together with someone like me, just the name Montague sounds like a death omen to most people. So, yeah, I kinda get how you must have felt, Cas.”
“Cas, you haven’t seen him
„See you later, Bobby,” he called through the house, receiving a „Behave!” in return. He smirked and left the house.
Dean shrugged helplessly.
On the evening of the same day, Castiel and Dean had dinner together – he found Dean in the kitchen cooking them dinner while proudly wearing one of his silly aprons with a smiling hot dog on it (Castiel hated it and had threatened to burn it several times, but hey, if Dean liked it… they both knew it was an empty threat). He always loved to come home to Dean, appreciated their time together, especially when they could have a meal together. Dean’s shifts often didn’t make that possible, so tonight, Cas should have been thrilled to have his husband to himself for the whole evening and night. But his mind was miles away, still processing the trial of today. Jack’s big blue eyes seemed glued to his own retina, he couldn’t forget about the boy. For some reason unbeknownst to Cas, Jack had awoken his protective instinct – something he practically never experienced: When it came to Dean and when he got hurt at work, it made Castiel’s heart flutter with fear and wish he could save Dean from every bad thing in the world, that was the only protective instinct he had and was aware of; The feeling coursing now through him was akin. But it was strange – he didn’t even know the kid. Why did he care about him?
"I don't know... I just didn't feel like it anymore, you know? I used to be able to capture everything just right, and it was fun, and I completely merged in it, but... my paintings,... they became more and more painful to draw and it didn't make me feel better any longer, just sharpened what I was feeling. So I stopped. I miss it, sometimes, though. For example, last week, when I wanted nothing else but to draw your face..."
The radio operator of the police station was called Donna – she had wonderful, long blonde hair and a friendly, pretty face; her laughter was hearty and could be heard often, and it was so contagious, that Dean often found himself laughing too, without even knowing what was going on. With Donna, he often drank a coffee or ate a snack, and chatted with her blithely. Dean admired her for her knowledge of weapons and her shooting skills. They shared the same love for donuts – Donna had told him she had divorced last year from her douchebag husband, because he had told her she loved food better than him, and soon Dean and Donna had decided, that donuts probably were a better company than her stupid, unappreciative ex. Also, Donna had a big heart, was always compassionate and easy to talk to. She was a little older than Dean and gave off a motherly vibe Dean kind of enjoyed being the recipient of. There were worse things than somebody bringing you donuts and asking you how you were doing.
"Yeah, I'm fine. No questions."
"Seriously, Cas. I asked you this before – did it feel forced or one-sided? Do you really have the impression he's not enjoying himself when he's with you? And, you know,... I'm really happy for you, that you finally found someone again, someone you're interested in. Although it seems weird and a little difficult, maybe it's worth a shot. I mean, you're practically UNsexual around everyone, and if he is someone you can see yourself with, you should at least give it a try, don't you think? Why don't you tell him what goes through that pretty little head of yours the next time you're with him? Would be easier to just know, wouldn't it?"
ZZ Top "I need you tonight" (chapter 33)
Gently, he shook Castiel, trying to wake him up. After a few moments, there was some incoherent grumbling, followed by sighs and sleep-drugged blathering. Dean chuckled. Castiel was probably still in the tight grip of a deep sleep.
“Yeah, of course you did.”
„I think Dean’s right, Cas. You shouldn’t go alone. This isn’t a cute dramatic break-up situation anymore, boy. We’re talking about life or death here. You have no idea how far Aaron will go in his rage, and even though I know you can defend yourself, I’d feel better if Dean was going with you. You know he’s a cop, he’s got some fighting skills as well. He can even arrest Aaron if he gets violent. And wouldn’t it be better to have a witness when worse comes to worst?” Bobby said, laying a caring hand on Castiel’s shoulder, whereupon Castiel sighed, obviously torn in two.
"Cassie, you need a break. I've been hearing you talking to Dean-o for the last two nights, and somehow it's all cute, but it's also kind of eerie, unhealthy, don't you think? I mean, look at you! You look like the living dead!"
“Well, and I’m a judge,” he said, and they all smirked. Dean couldn’t resist as he stepped closer towards his partner, little Mary still in his arms, as he leaned in and left a sweet, lingering kiss on Cas’ stubbly cheek.
Sam had the decency to stay in Dean's hospital room for the day, though Dean suspected it was just because it gave Sam some pleasure to see Dean getting his syringes. Dean was almost too distracted by the busty nurse injecting him his medicine to glare at Sam's grinning face. She had dark hair, tanned skin, and a sporty figure. If all nurses in this hospital looked like this, he would have no difficulties to stay here for the rest of the day. However, he wasn't that fond of her anymore, when she ran the two syringes into his forearm indelicately.
“I know my way should have been a different one, Gabriel. By next week, I was supposed to become a priest. But now that I’ve met Dean, I can’t. I don’t want to,” Castiel said quietly, his words considerate and slow. His voice was wavering, laced with emotional upheaval - but he gripped Dean’s hand tightly and pressed it affirmatively.
In the following week, Dean returned to his work and the shared shifts with Benny. Most of the time, they patrolled the districts assigned to them, checking if everything was alright. There were some annoying cases about drug dealers, which had gotten out of hand and had to be dealt with. Near one local train stations, some cases of bag-snatching had occurred, so Dean and Benny scoured about said station every other day until they finally caught some dodgy dudes. It was good to be back on the job, Dean thought, for it kept him busy, kept his mind distracted. Also, he had missed spending time with Benny and talking about anything and everything.
A sudden fever pitch captured Dean, and he was reaching out for Castiel's ass and thighs, tearing at him demandingly; Luckily Castiel understood his intentions and he followed Dean's lead, making a little jump so that Dean could lift him up. Another fit of dizziness enraptured Dean as Castiel twined his thighs around Dean's middle, his arms still enclosing the older man's neck and shoulder. For a laughable second of self-control their lips broke apart and they stared at each other, huffing and puffing, trying to estimate the situation and their earnestness. Every doubt died away when Dean made out the furrowed brow of Castiel, his wet, swollen lips, shining in a beguiling, sanguine red.
In the distance, he spotted Dean and Gabriel – his heart nearly stopped at the sight: Dean sat right on the altar, his legs dangling over its edge, while Gabriel stood next to him. Dean sitting on the altar seemed like blasphemy, and yet like a religious epiphany to Castiel at the same time. It felt like a significant, affirmative gesture from above, as if something was showing him the right way.
Out of the corner of his eye, he registered a swift movement. Then a sharp pain throbbed in his cheek. Anna had taken a big swing at his cheek with her gun, rammed it against his face.
John compressed his lips thoughtfully while hearing that, than he patted Dean's shoulder friendly, and Castiel saw how Dean froze at the mere touch, going completely stiff. His father turned around and walked away, out of Castiel's field of vision, and inside the workspace of the garage. Castiel waited several seconds, while he heard his heartthrob rushing loudly in his ears – he couldn't tear his eyes away from Dean, how he stood there in the barn, utterly alone and apparently shattered, marred. His head hang down, and his shoulders were slumped down, and his torso quavered in an odd way. The second Castiel heard a car start and leave the garage, he shoved all doubts and thoughts aside and walked towards the door to the barn. He opened it resolutely – Dean was all that mattered, and he couldn't stand seeing him hurt so badly. The door squeaked, and Dean turned around with a start, a bewildered look veiling his tear-stained face.
"I would be grateful that someone cared enough about me to give up their life for mine. Though I think it's natural to have compunction. You wouldn't be human if you didn't care about the other's death."
Dean smiled and nodded understandingly. His stepsister could be a bit of a handful. Her fighting spirit was as strong as her pride – so there was no way she would put up with Anna Capulet mocking her.
“Let’s not go there,” he said quietly, dangerously and determined. Cas didn’t get it, didn’t hear the warning tone in his words. He gritted his teeth as Cas kept talking, his words passionate, oozing with the love he felt for Dean.
"That's it, now I've got to finish you!" he called out foolishly – a tickle fight emerged and Dean was making Castiel screech and squirm underneath his adept, knowing fingers. He knew exactly where to tickle and where to tease, and Castiel was becoming a huffing and puffing mess, grinning and whining simultaneously...
Uhm... I know I just posted a chapter yesterday, but I'm bored... hehe... thanks again for your lovely reviews x3 yeah, I'm sad too that there are only that few chapters left, but uhm... in the end everything will be fine x3 I received some funny suggestions, and no, I won't post every two hours lol! Hahaha uhm I think I will post every 2 or 3 days again...! Sorry in advance for the next chapter, but come on, you knew this was coming. Have a great Friday / weekend!
“You really didn’t have to trouble yourself making breakfast, Dean. You both should have slept in,” Castiel scolded him when their eyes met again – but the lingering smile on his mouth revealed how touched he was by Dean’s little gesture. Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes.
More sober, pragmatic thoughts filled his mind, as he got up on wobbly legs. He was slightly inebriated and only dressed in clothes for casual wear. If he wanted to see Dean, he would have to dress, and he would bail him out of prison if he showed up as an FBI agent, so he needed to get it together. He ignored his shaky fingers and the awful, aching throb in his head, as he staggered to his bedroom and changed his clothes into a formal suit. Before he was done, he thankfully had the presence of mind to call a cab, because in his state he was unable to drive. The wait for the cab was horrendous, and Castiel tried to avert his glance from his reflection in the mirror of his entrance hall. His eyes were widened in shock, and he saw how pale his face had become. All he could think about was Dean, why he was in prison, and why he was angry with him. For Christ's sake, why did this have to happen now? Somehow Castiel thought this was all a bad joke, a nightmare, and if he tried hard enough he would wake up, next to Dean, and instead of his angry words, he would see him smile at him. If only this was a simple nightmare...
He wanted to sit up properly and hug Jack, take him into his arms and never let him go, he was so happy – but when he moved, a sharp pain in his torso reminded him that his body was hurt and that he couldn’t do whatever he wanted. Jack grinned at him, revealed the cute gap between his front teeth.
"Hi Dean. How are you? Everything alright?", Castiel asked nonchalantly, closing his lids to focus solely on Dean's voice and the little noises his exhales produced. It made a shiver run down Castiel's spine and he felt himself harden at the bare thought of Dean's breath meeting his skin.
Dean turned his head and gave his younger brother a daring death-glare, which Sam replied steadily. He assumed Sam was right. There were major problems they needed to handle somehow, he had to concentrate and suppress his emotional outbursts. Now wasn't the time, if there ever was a time for him to break down and let himself go. So he nodded subtly and put the empty flask on the nightstand. He rubbed the fatigue and the remnants of welling tears out of his burning eyes and sighed heavily.
“Beautiful, right?” he said with his chesty voice. A sweet surge of devotion rushed through Dean, and he sank down on his knees, right next to Castiel. Cas looked at him rather perplexed when Dean raised a hand to his face and cradled it gently. He looked deeply into Castiel’s eyes with a firm look, sensed how he tensed up a little, how he sucked in a nervous breath.
He and Sam continued talking for over half an hour, talking about this and that. It felt good to hear Sam’s familiar voice and to know that he was doing just fine. However, Dean got a little annoyed, when Sam kept asking him whether he was doing okay as well… because they both knew how Dean had suffered due to the loss of Lisa, and that her death was still afflicting him. But Dean just didn’t want to talk about Lisa anymore. It always led to the same dark road, to the same hapless emotions, and he just didn’t want to deal with this now. Therefore, he decided to change the subject.
He noticed her presence and listened attentively, when she whispered into his ear, her words like venom.
Appalled, Dean froze, he studied his cousin as if he’d lost his mind. Maybe he had.
“Yeah, well. We got together that night. And man, it was
“I don’t care anymore what it takes, Dean. Even if our families painted the whole world red with blood, I have no ounce left in me to care about it. All I know is that I never want to part from you again. No more running away, no more excuses. When I look at you now…” Cas paused, and an enraptured, lopsided smile fled over his lips. “I just want to scream at the top of my lungs what I feel for you, let everyone know about us. Just - not tonight,” he ended with an exhausted chuckle. “I’m too worn out.”
"That's not it... You're beautiful, with or without them. They just make me realize that you put yourself in danger... that you're not invincible...," Castiel mumbled against Dean's supple abdomen, scraping his teeth over the fine line of Dean's left hip bone. Dean felt himself harden fervently, Castiel's ministrations made him flushed with tizzy. Oh how pleasing these words were... Did that mean Castiel was worried about him?
When they were upstairs, Castiel led Dean to a big room at the end of the corridor – the bedroom, he had shared with Aaron for all those years of their relationship. A king-size bed stood in the middle of the room, and heavy, long curtains robbed the room’s light away. Castiel drew them and let the perse daylight in. He then took one of the boxes they had brought and walked over to the wardrobe. He pointed at a bookshelf in the other corner of the room.
For a moment, Dean wondered how Castiel had even ended up with someone like Aaron, and why Aaron hadn’t appreciated Castiel for who he really was, how he had even dared to raise a fist against Castiel. How could one beat up someone so capable, so beautiful? Castiel was super clever; he was a religious man, and a man with morals. He could cook, he could dance, he could play the piano, and he was outrageously skilled regarding chess, poker, and other games. He was someone one could talk with for hours, someone with a functioning, beautiful brain, and Dean loved to converse with him and spend time with him. And on top of all of that, he was breathtakingly handsome, just gorgeous from head to toe, so that Dean wanted to fall down on his knees and worship Castiel and say prayers to him. And after all the pain he had experienced in his life, Castiel wasn’t bitter, just docile and gentle and so damn loveable… It nearly took Dean’s breath away the moment he realized what he was thinking when he caught up with his train of thoughts. He suddenly understood why he was thinking in this way, what his heart was telling him.
"No offense, Garth, but that's really not my thing, you know? I think I better find a liquor store and get drunk. I really don't know how you two are doing it, I can't imagine being here for weeks. I mean, there's stuff I gotta do, you know? And my brother's out there all by himself, he could use my support", Dean told them earnestly, receiving thoughtful looks in return.
Then he sank to his knees, held his middle. Anna’s gun must have gone off accidentally. In terror, Dean realized streams of dark red blood gushing out of Benny’s chest, how it dyed his hands crimson. Their eyes met in silent understanding. Dean rushed forward, fell to his knees next to him. His head was swimming, he felt nauseous with pain. A sickening taste was on his tongue, as if he had a concussion and was about to throw up. But he couldn’t care about his body’s signals anymore. His eyes were fixated on Benny, on all the blood pouring out of him.
“I’m afraid I’m falling in love with you,” Castiel said quietly, his voice low, nothing more than a whisper.
Dean brought his arms around Castiel's sweaty back and held him tightly. He listened to their mixed gasps and quiet hums in the aftermath of their lovemaking. He relished how their racing heartbeats thumped together, how good Castiel's weight felt on his spent body. He was amazed with the experience he had just made, knowing it was exceptional and life-changing for him. In that minute, when Castiel's plump lips touched the skin over his aorta and kissed it feebly, he understood the love he felt for the other man in its full extent. Slight desperation came over Dean and he cradled Castiel firmer, pressed a long-lasting kiss against his forehead and ran his fingers through his soaked through hair tenderly.
It was a weird case. The defendant was called Mark, but he called himself Lucifer and told everyone, who would listen, that he was the reincarnation of the devil. Insanity glistened in his pale blue eyes – the expert assessment lying in front of Castiel told him that this man wasn’t in his right senses and probably needed preventive detention. That was the one thing Castiel had first stumbled upon – it wasn’t common to meet a man who announced he was the devil himself. The other thing was the way he had killed his wife, Kelly Kline; with his bare hands, he had throttled and beaten her to death. Castiel had seen the photos of her corpse, had seen all the bruises on her battered face. The reason, why he had killed her, was also strange – Mark insisted, that Kelly had given birth to an angelic creature, their son Jack, and that Jack was his rival. He freely admitted that he had wanted to first kill her, then kill him. Their boy had seen the whole murder – it was a miracle that he had been able to escape and flee to their next-door neighbors.
“Give him some space… It will be alright,” he comforted him kindly. Dean looked up into Bobby’s face, studying the gentle light dancing in the old man’s eyes, the wisdom of age dwelling in them. Dean sighed heavily, feeling stupid and awkward about himself. He shrugged.
He listened to the voices in his head, fighting with each other for dominance and reason. One sounded so very tired, it begged him to quit this life, to find peace and safety, some kind of stability. To let others feel this weight on his young shoulders, to let others save those innocent people and to kill those evil beings out there. It was the voice of a former Dean, one that had asked himself the same questions over and over again – when John had made them leave another town behind, along with new-made friends, lovers and schools. This former, child-like Dean, that had cried secretly to himself after killing another being, scared and alone, and with no one to talk about it.
„What’s the occasion? Do you wanna woo somebody?” the old man asked. Dean scoffed a laugh and stole Bobby’s glass out of his hand. He ignored Bobby’s outraged outcry when Dean stole a sip of his whiskey with a broad grin.
When Dean complied, his gaze was clouded with lust, devouring Castiel as his eyes darted over his face and torso, his strokes becoming more moderate. Fitful exhales escaped him, and his cheeks were flushed with arousal; for a while all Castiel could do was look at Dean while the man jerked off, his eyes transfixing Castiel's. A shaky low moan rang out and Dean writhed in the sheets, his head flinging from one side to the other, his chest started tensing up. Castiel gently moved his hand along Dean's ribs, seeing Dean's lids flutter and then close as he breathed in sharply. Again his hand was accelerating its motions, and Castiel heard himself giving quiet commands with his funeral voice. He had no control over it, but he wanted to see Dean like this as long as possible, so the words took over him, revealed his desire before he had the chance to give it some thought.
„The main thing is that you get better, Cas. Let’s cross that bridge when we get to it, okay?”
"That's fucking awesome," Dean moaned. He rolled his head like a cat that leaned into a loving palm. The other let his thumb stroke over Dean's back of the hand, which felt all kinds of nice. He turned towards him and blinked slowly at him, a reassuring gesture.
“Okay, but I want extra chili and jalapeno,” she insisted, making Dean wide-eyed.
well guys, sorry for the late update :-) I was pretty exhausted, depressed and sleep-deprived lately, so I had to take care of my menthal and phyiscal health more. Kinda doing ok right now, not super but okay :-) Btw, actually each chapter was supposed to be like 5000 - 6000 words, now it's more or less always 8000 words... oops! Hope you like the next chapter!
"And you think I could so easily swap you with another person? I couldn't... After years of insignificant one-night stands and short-lived flings, you were the first one who really got to me, whom I couldn't get out of my head. Somehow you broke my protective walls bit by bit and took a hold of me. I gave everything to you, Dean, and I would give you more. You can have all of me... So don't ask me to cheapen that experience, don't ask me to find solace in someone else's arms. I only want you."
"Hey, Dean. What's up? I guess you're both alright?" Sam greeted him, sounding sly. It made Dean smirk.
„You know, when I was a teenager, I wanted to be a rock star. I taught myself how to play guitar… and I guess I was getting on my dad’s and Sammy’s nerves all the time, because I kept singing to loud music in my room…”
“Anna, it’s not like that, I swear,” he said in an appeasing manner, his voice quiet and surprisingly soft.
"What do you mean, going back to him? You're planning on continuing this thing between you two?"
Dean beheld him with an intimidating glare, though he was laughing inwardly about Castiel's nerdy, cute behaviour as he was telling him one stupid joke after the other, set on making Dean laugh. And these jokes were all very, very awful. Dean wriggled on the mat in Castiel's office, the slight layer of sweat sticking to his body like warm glue. He needed a shower. It was Friday and they had finished the last workout session for this week, thank God.
Dean’s eyes wandered over the colorful flowers: Blue forget-me-nots, yellow chrysanthemum, crimson tulips. The slight rainfall bedewed the withering flowers, put raindrops on their soft petals. Wistfully, Dean smiled, thought John might have liked the wreaths. All at once, Castiel tensed up. Dean felt the change in his posture, how he straightened his back. He pressed Dean’s hand hard. Dean looked up, followed Castiel’s glance. There on the path, a man was walking up to them. He was alone. Dean frowned. It was Raphael.
For chapter 17, I don't think I can keep up this insane writing pace, so forgive me if there won't be an update next week but the week thereafter.
But then you came along and took her from me! I’d rather die than see a Montague claim again what should be mine” he shouted in rage.
His eyes repeatedly fled to Castiel’s features, which were contorted with pain; Dean counted the injuries he could see on his partner; and even though it were many and it would take some time for them to heal, Dean couldn’t believe how lucky they actually were - that Cas wasn’t one of those poor bastards, who were screaming themselves hoarse now. He was still worried madly, about to lose his sanity because of all his concern for Cas – but deep inside of him, Dean knew that Cas would be okay.
Dean, in his stead, started to let it become a habit to let his eyes linger on Castiel's calm features observing him or his body while he chatted. He had learned to read his facial expressions, and now it was easy to see the littlest smile on those chapped plump lips while he spoke. And Dean spoke a lot, he couldn't even remember when he had spoken so carefree and emotionally the last time, or if he had ever talked like that. It came naturally in Castiel's presence, there was no way he could maintain his usual filter. It should have scared him or worried him at least, but it simply electrified him, fascinated him. Maybe it was down to the fact that Castiel listened so attentively, that he absorbed Dean's words so hungrily, and still he was asking for more – it made Dean light-headed, filled him with a bliss he couldn't put into words. Castiel seemed to bring out another side of him, a side he had buried a long time ago.
His hands touched Dean's muscular back, and he groped his shoulders and ass greedily while he observed Dean's face became nothing but a mask of sensuality and yearning. His lids were closed, his brows were furrowed, and his mouth stood slightly agape, as sweet moan after moan fled from him, while Castiel's hands roamed all over his body. Castiel's own desire was brain-damaging, there was something about feeling Dean's immense, hot erection pressing against his abdomen promisingly. It twitched several times, and Castiel wondered when he had felt Dean inside of him the last time. His insides twisted into a hot lump of lust, and his hole was already throbbing, in want of Dean's dick moving inside him.
“If you tell Sam about this I'll kill you with my own two hands...” Dean whispered, a cheeky smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. Castiel understood the concept of time perfectly, but it was utterly human to him as he thought, against all reason, that everything took place in slow motion, his perception was solely tuned to Dean. Everything was Dean, Dean, Dean. How he breathed in shivering intervals, how hotly his exhales ghosted over Castiel's slightly agape lips, generating a heated frenzy within Castiel's stomach. How Dean closed his eyes ultimately and pressed his mouth against Castiel's, making him twitch excitedly. By instinct he responded to the hesitant kiss, opening his lips for Dean slowly.
Dean stifled a grin, thought Gabriel must have read his mind. Castiel however grinned broadly, then he said “Thank you” to Gabriel – and before Dean knew what was happening, Castiel lead him by the hand, towards the entrance door he had come through before.
Stunned about Bobby’s blunt candidness, Dean gaped at him, his jaw dropped. But then, a slow smile crept over his mouth, and a spirited light started glowing in his eyes. He pressed Bobby’s hand gratefully.
"Actually, it's not sufficient, but I'll return the favour: Castiel Novak, aged 28. Current job: FBI agent, my partner is the cheeky bastard you know from the other night. I'm also not in a relationship or promised to anyone...I've too had a sibling, Anna, but she's dead for two years now... Sorry, I don't know why I said that. I never talk to anyone about her."
Dean breathed through several times, building up his courage. Okay, this was good. Cas obviously wanted to fix this, wanted to get over this fight. Dean knew he had a one-time chance now to repair the damage he had caused, and he didn’t want to screw this up. His fingers fled to the touchscreen and he typed away. He read the message three times before he pressed on “send”.
A few moments later, Dean had abducted them to a calmer section of their garden, so that they could have a moment to themselves. It seemed everyone wanted to congratulate them for a splendid evening and for the incredible amount of money they had collected – but Dean had realized that Castiel needed a break, and he himself also wouldn’t have minded a little breather. With cool beers, they now sat on some chairs at the other end of the garden, a few feet away from the bustling activity. Dean held Castiel’s hand loosely in his, sometimes kneaded his fingers playfully, absentmindedly. To feel the weight and warmth of his fingers in his was soothing to Dean, reassuring. A tentative smile graced Castiel’s mouth as their eyes met. Dean was ruminative, memories of the past springing to his mind suddenly.
Possessiveness rattled through Dean and blurred everything else, he only had eyes for Castiel, on his knees, between Dean's legs – he tilted his head and closed the gruesome gap between them, placing his lips chastely on Castiel's. They were warm and dry and tasted sweet, as sweet as maple syrup and pancakes on a lazy sunny morning, and the soapy, clean smell of Castiel's body, combined with the waves of his body heat embracing Dean, made Dean's head swim vigorously. He kissed Castiel intensely, he already loved the sensation of his full, slightly chapped lips crushing against his with the right amount of pressure and a healthy amount of teasing cleverness. How Castiel sucked at his bottom lip for example, or how he traced his tongue torturously slowly over the seams of Dean's mouth, only to dive between Dean's lips and ravage his mouth with skilled French kisses...
"Well. Looks like he's an ancient, powerful bastard, taken under Lucifer's wings. Sounds hilarious."
It was even worse than jokes or rejection – Gabe's pity. And that even he had concerns made Castiel more desperate, telling him how fucked up his whole situation was. He let his head fall against his desk, resisting the urge to bang it against the tabletop over and over again.
, so to say. I don’t think it’s good for him to lock himself away now and brood all the time. He needs a little company, a little distraction,” Bobby announced quietly, so that only Dean could hear him. Dean nodded and grinned approvingly.
They were alone, and only the night’s twilight shone inside.
aware of Dean's lips brushing against the skin of his ear, of his quiet words, the quaver in his voice...
“Yeah,” Cas said, laughing through his tears of joy.
Pensively Castiel let his palms glide down Dean's back, and he massaged the flesh above his ribcage, right next to his spine, and Dean's brows furrowed, his mouth opened sensually. He moaned loudly, sounding somewhat relieved while Castiel continued working on this terribly stiff back.
. That guy seemed to have it.
He felt his fingertips brushed over Dean's sweet spot, and Dean cringed, a tremor churning his whole body. The way Dean sighed, the way he moaned and fucked himself down on Castiel's crooked, invading fingers, it made Castiel light-headed and flabbergasted. He was startled, surprised at himself, because usually he wasn't like that, usually he could control himself and be tender and share slow caresses – but Dean simply made him lose it, and he wanted to make Dean lose it too. Castiel drew his fingers back, his gaze focused on Dean's entrance, reddened and spread and oh so ready for him. His erection pulsated terribly, and he took the condom out of Dean's drawer, rolling it over his dick carefully. He was already so close, and now Dean had moved so that he knelt in front of him, his head rested again on his forearms, his face blocked from Castiel's eyes. Quickly Castiel slathered his cock with lube, eager to be inside Dean again.
“Nah, I was just pulling your chain.”
"Why don't you make yourself comfortable? Sit down", the man offered, and Castiel awoke from his slumbering state. His eyes searched for a chair or something akin, but there was only the double bed. As his eyes returned to the stranger, he saw he was grinning at him and patted the bedside next to him. Castiel wasn't ashamed when it came to sex, but he was inexperienced with men and the hooker's smashing appearance and his self-assurance intimidated him.
Happy New Year! Omg, people, calm down! The onslaught of reviews for the last chapter overwhelmed me! *sarcasm* Thanks to the one and only Dragonfli who made an effort to leave me a review hooray ;) I'd be super-happy if anyone is still reading this story. Anyone out there? Am I talking to myself? Well, then that would be a lengthy conversation, phew! ^^" Apart from that, see below for author's notes, darlings! Oh, and a warning: This chapter isn't beta-read, but I proofread it thoroughly.
“Why don’t you unbutton your shirt,” he rasped, his voice already dark with arousal. Cas smiled a little, then sat up on his knees and pushed the laptop to the other end of the bed, so that Dean could see him completely. He looked into the laptop camera, his look piercing, wild with vehement lust, and slowly unbuttoned his shirt, button per button. Dean’s mouth became dry, his heart pounding, when he watched Cas undressing, teasing him. More and more of his tanned perfect skin was revealed, his lithesome torso… he pulled away the shirt, exposed his strong upper arms, the collarbones Dean felt the need to leave bruising hickeys on… Cas stopped at once, placed his hands on his thighs, and smirked a little at the camera.
A few days later, an unexpected package was delivered to Dean – he recognized the handwriting immediately and smirked when he accepted the package. It was from Cas. He probably wanted to return the favor. Dean ripped the package open eagerly, laughing a little when he found what was inside. There was a soft black old Led Zeppelin shirt he had seen wear Cas a dozen times; he assumed it was one of his favorite shirts as well. Then Dean found the jar of his favorite peanut butter brand, a fridge magnet in the shape of an ax with the slogan “Slice & Dice”, and this one really made Dean laugh. He had told Cas about his favorite horror movie series “All Saints Day”, and back at Bobby’s, he had even made them watch a part of it with them, and even though Cas thought it was stupid and likewise hilarious, he had remembered. His attentiveness made Dean feel appreciated, meant the world to him. The last thing he found was a CD with classical music – a compilation of Chopin’s piano pieces, and attached to it was a sticky note from Cas.
Dean beheld him fondly, a million thoughts flitting through his mind. This was important, felt so much bigger than them. He smiled tentatively, took a step forward into Cas’ personal space. Playfully he adjusted Castiel’s tie, their eyes locked. Dean tried to smile encouragingly at his partner to reassure him, as he saw how taut his posture was, how jittery he seemed. He quickly kissed his lips, felt Cas’ smiling against his own mouth.
"You know, I could still call that stud back. I bet you'll have a great night with him. I mean, have you looked at him? He looks like an actor, or a porn star, or"- Gabe gabbled on enthusiastically, but Cas cut him off annoyed.
Castiel unlocked the car and opened one of the backdoors, and when he got inside, Dean followed his lead.
„Hey, Cas,” Dean said friendly, greeting the other man. Castiel looked up, somewhat startled, but then he managed to smile a little at Dean. „What’s up?” Dean asked, „Why the gloomy face?”
The flames were crackling finally, and an invigorating scent of smoke filled the air. For a while, they sat side by side next to the bonfire. They stared out at the lake and watched the afterglow of the sun, silently savored their togetherness and this moment. Whenever their eyes met, it seemed to Dean they were having a mute conversation, understood each other without a single word being uttered. He could read between the lines, between Castiel’s kind smiles and the glint in his gorgeous eyes. He was just as happy being here as Dean was.
“So you mean to tell me you haven’t done
„This is confiscated,” he declared decisively. Then he opened the bag and took a handful of popcorn, to shove it into his own mouth and munch away all self-complacent. Bobby laughed – and Dean thought, if that was even possible, he loved Castiel even more than before at this moment. He wanted to worship him and lay the world to his feet.
Castiel didn't even try to feel awkward during the few times Dean stopped by around lunch time and handed him a homemade meal in a Tupperware box. He was pretty sure he had seen Gabe grin at that, and his grin even broadened when Dean had leaned in and kissed Castiel's cheek sweetly, only to be surprised with a passionate kiss Castiel gave him in return, feeling both his and Dean's knees weaken, while Gabe whistled impressed in the background. So maybe he was showing Dean off, and maybe he grinned proudly and told Gabe to shut up, but who could blame him? Dean was making him happy, and to know he had the same effect on the younger man (just the way Dean's eyes were practically
"I'm sorry, Cas. Wow, I... that must have been hard for you. I didn't mean to make you feel bad with questions," he clarified, and when Castiel uplifted his head, a fierce fire was burning in his deep, blue eyes, consuming every tender nuance lingering there. It had nothing to do with weakness or sadness, rather with passion and determination, and Dean admired him for this. He seemed less like a lost child, who had cared for his mother, he rather looked like a warrior, bitter and aged through his experiences.
For a moment, they sat there in silence, watched the cars driving by. Dean bumped Benny’s shoulder amicably.
“Why not? Don’t you miss me too? You have no idea how often I thought of you, I think of you all the time… and I tell myself not to, but I can’t help it.”
"I'm happy for you. It can be quite lonely in here without friends", Castiel contemplated loudly. Dean wondered if there was more to Castiel's statement, if it implied he felt lonely sometimes – he was about to ask him when Castiel stopped in front of an opened door, tilting his head in a welcoming gesture.
„All these times I beat you up, and now you finally hit back?” he asked in disbelief. Castiel smiled, a rivulet of his own blood running down his jaw. A knowing look was in his eyes as they were fixed on Aaron.
„You know, I invited Jo and Ellen over for tonight. I think it’s best if we keep Castiel
“How was the drive?” Bobby asked. He opened his door wider and let Dean inside, taking the duffel bag out of his hands. Dean let himself inside and looked around the tidied-up place. On each room’s floor lay beautiful oaken parquet, and Bobby had a thing for heavy solid wood furniture – so Bobby’s house always smelt wonderfully of wood, reminding Dean of forests; he just loved this scent. In the kitchen, the light was on, and there was a newspaper spread out on the table, along with a soup plate with steaming food in it. Dean must have caught Bobby having a late dinner.
“There you are,” Dean gasped, straightening himself. Cas gave him a half-amused, half-annoyed long look, as if Dean had lost his marbles completely.
“Oh, there’s something I can do about it, I’m sure,” John said sharply.
“It’d be an honor, Dean. Three times
There was a brief silence, then some more hammering. Castiel paused again.
Anna didn’t believe her ears, winced with a vehement wave of reluctance. With nervous fingers, she carded through her long hair, faked a smile at people looking at the two of them suspiciously. Had Zachariah lost his mind?
"I could not fail to recognize the alike weather patterns... those are information about the weather forecasts and the abstrusity taken place instead. I think the same thing is happening here now."
However, he didn't find the courage to speak up for his hidden desires, and Castiel didn't say anything either. His wishes were as good as forgotten when Castiel rode him that night; as he sat in Dean's lap and let Dean's cock disappear in his scorching hot, narrow heat over and over again. Dean was absolutely hypnotized by Castiel's face, contorted with both pain and pleasure as he slit himself open on Dean's throbbing length, his nails scraping over Dean's torso back and forth. He had his head thrown back, his lids shut – his mouth was agape and twitching as he released lengthy, high-pitched moans whenever Dean's broad cockhead stroked over that one spot that made Castiel limp and tense at the same time. Filled with admiration, Dean let his palms skim over Castiel's convulsing abs. He loved how they rolled along to the movements of Castiel's hips, how they constricted under Dean's fingertips. Castiel's eyes flew open when Dean's hand encircled his partner's cock tentatively, stroking and pumping it in a loose fist.
"You're good enough for me," Castiel insisted determinately, and Dean's heart gave up for a frightening second. These words simply made Dean fall silent, agitation close to bliss and panic ran over him as he lost every sensible thought in light of Castiel's fine visage. He felt as if Castiel gave life back to him as he smothered him with thousand kisses, breathing and licking into his mouth avidly. He pinned Dean's hands down with slight pressure and made Dean tremble and sigh wantonly as Castiel pressed against him lasciviously. He smelt of wood and something spicy that made Dean think of clarity – it was as if a cool breeze of air filled him up and flooded him with lust for living. The atmosphere was thick with sexual tension, Castiel's hardening length was pulsating against Dean's tummy. He clutched the back of his lover's hands firmly and used his abs to sit up, Castiel still in his lap.
"Listen, man, I was just joking. No need to get all tongue-tied on me, okay? How about you pick me up in half an hour? There's a place I want to show you, if you like..", Dean soothed him and Castiel was so grateful that his little dirty secret hadn't been revealed. He nodded, then he remembered Dean couldn't see it.
"It says Azazel will lead the troops of hell to pave the way for Lucifer's first borns – even older, far more mighty demons. And that passage I found interesting as well... here... it says Azazel will infest humanity like a disease, convincing mankind to support his cause."
Dean didn’t know where he was or what had happened – when he regained his consciousness, he found himself lying in an uncomfortable single bed in a room he didn’t recognize. He blinked against the sleepiness still tightly gripping him several times. Slowly but surely, he recognized two figures sitting next to his bed to his right side. He harrumphed, rubbed his eyes with his left hand. Finally, he realized it was Cas and Jack, who were looking at him with tear-stained faces. Dean frowned. Why were they crying? Cas looked the worse for wear. His eyes were red from crying and puffy; he was sickly pale and biting on his trembling lower lip. What the hell…? Then Dean’s looked over to Jack, who seemed exhausted and beside himself, sobbing and hiccupping every now and then.
