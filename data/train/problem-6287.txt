They were good suggestions. They made sense. They… worked.
A hand landed on his shoulder. It was shaking slightly. He looked over, expecting Natasha, but it was Rhodes.
“Right now?”
Tony was undeterred. “Whatever. The particle accelerator isn’t even the coolest thing in here.” He continued in a stage whisper, “Did she show you the rocket launcher yet?”
True to her word, Pepper kept them out of the same classes as Flash, but they still ran into him. “Hey, Penis Parker!” He called across the lobby, ensuring that a passing crowd of students stopped to look at them. Peter flushed, but didn't respond as Flash appeared beside them, looking unbearably smug as usual. “Did you see the flying car we brought? Pretty cool, right? I helped develop that. And what exactly did stupid Stark bring? A phone? It must suck working for someone so lame.”
He had been out in the Iron Man suit, intimidating criminals and stopping petty crime when a strange call on the police scanner had grabbed his attention. Ten minutes later, he found himself standing in the middle of three very confused officers from the NYPD, all four of them looking at the thief with the same baffled look. Tony actually stepped out of the suit to see it better.
“Man, what the hell is he doing here?” Sam asked, uncrossing his arms and moving to stand in front of Peter. Almost instinctively, Bucky mimicked his protective stance. Peter had to stand on his tiptoes to see between their shoulders now that they had created a barrier between him and their new guest.
“Is that -” Bruce seemed hesitant to ask, looking between Tony and Steve -
Like, a lot of spiders.
This information meant next to nothing to Steve, except that he was frankly impressed that Tony invented anything while he was being held against his will. He knew Tony was resourceful; this was something else entirely. To have a life-threatening injury and still create, still hope for an escape… that showed a strength that Steve had no idea Tony was hiding.
He tried twice more, but no luck. He turned to see three shadowy figures at the head of the alley. He’d trapped himself in here. Cursing under his breath, heart pounding in his ears, Peter did the only thing his panicking mind could think of and started climbing the wall. “Shit, shit -”
Peter gasped. They had threatened Tony? This had to be OsCorp. A chill ran through him. Peter hadn’t been afraid of OsCorp, really, until now. He had always assumed that the spiders were a freak accident that could have happened to anyone, but he should have listened to Tony: OsCorp was a dark organization with secrets to keep, and they would do anything to keep them.
“I don’t know. I was sort of hoping that my dear brother might find a way to contact me. There’s not much for me to work with here.” He gestured to the expansive nothingness around them.
“Was he always paranoid about reporters?” He asked, trying to lighten the mood.
With that, she turned the movie back on. Steve assumed the conversation was over, but then Natasha added carefully, “You know, there’s a whole file on Tony downstairs in the SHIELD archives. The guards take their lunch break at 12:30.” She glanced over at him, the bright light of the TV dancing across her features. “Just saying.”
all day. They were there for six hours. Wasn't that against child labor laws or something? Also, it was messing with Tony’s regular schedule of staying up until 4 AM and sleeping until noon.
“Hey!” Nebula snapped. “Before either of you jump off a cliff, you should know that the sacrificed soul may not be able to be brought back with everyone else. I’m not clear on exactly how it works. But the person with the Soul Stone should be able to go to the Soul World and snap their fingers, so to speak, to bring everyone back. I’m not sure if that includes the sacrificed person.”
Steve had been asking himself the same questions over and over since people started turning into ash and dust before his eyes.
Steve inhaled. Exhaled. Something clicked in his brain, some deep-seated training from his Army days.
Bruce fumbled the phone in his hand, and then his eyes widened. “It’s Tony,” he said quickly, before pressing the phone to his ear.
Update 2/7/18: This chapter has been edited because I thought the timeline and alternating POV didn't flow well, so I re-arranged some parts. Nothing is re-written, just re-ordered, so if you already read it, you haven't missed anything!
“Maybe pick a different method of testing your powers next time, huh?” Tony suggested as he held an ice pack to Peter’s face. This kid was going to be the death of him.
Peter and MJ split up for their next lectures; she went upstairs to learn about grant writing, which sounded boring, while he stayed on the eighth floor to listen to a professor talk about how to growing food on rooftops in cities for when they finally ran out of land space and the population continued to grow. Peter started zoning out after a while; mainly what he gathered was that they were all screwed after the population hit 12 billion. It wasn't that the topic was boring, but the way the professor droned on was making him wonder when this would finally end.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in school?” Steve asked warily.
go to law school and he’s currently having an identity crisis.”
But now here Tony was, asleep and distraught, a scene familiar both from their shared past and from the last two years of Steve’s own life. Two halves of Steve warred within him: One part of him wanted to comfort Tony and never let him go. They could fix this, couldn’t they? After all this time, after Thanos, surely, they could fix this one thing. The other part of him was reminding him that thinking like that was dangerous, stupid, potentially deadly. Even if Tony forgave him, what would happen when they just started bickering again tomorrow?
“Huh? Oh, sorry. Spaced out a bit.”
“It is a big deal!” Flash spluttered. “We’ve basically invented private flying vehicles, and what have you done?”
Just as they turned the corner to get away from him, they ran into Tony himself. “I was going to step in, but you seemed to have that under control,” he said, grinning. He gave MJ a fist bump and clapped Peter on the shoulder. “Now, I get to lecture that kid for half an hour on why his boss is so stupid. Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.”
He wasn’t entirely sure he believed him, but what choice did he have? He was pretty sure that Steve had taken his threats seriously, especially considering the quick turnaround from earlier, but anxiety continued to eat away at him. Pepper knew now, which meant that he would have to face a million questions in the morning. Peter would be upset that Steve knew. And now Tony couldn’t trust Steve, which - he hated to admit it, but that was disappointing, too. As much as Tony had complained about Steve poking around, he had become used to the other man, and even started to like him. Like,
“Business,” said Peter with a raised eyebrow and an unbearable smirk. “At one in the morning. Right. Of course.”
“I just wish there was some way I could help,” Peter said thickly. He was exhausted, injured, and scared. Sitting around was only fraying his nerves further. “I felt like I was helping when I followed Mr. Stark to fight Thanos, but then… but then… one minute I was on Titan, and then the next thing I knew I was here. And now I’m useless again.”
Pepper’s smile was a little more genuine as she said, “This is Steve Carter. He’s a reporter with the
“Yes, do you have a question?” Pepper asked a little too eagerly.
“Parker - look out!” Tony shouted.
“I did not say he was hot,” Peter said quickly, although he could admit to himself that Steve
“Spider-Man,” Peter corrected automatically, but no one acknowledged him.
“This day just keeps getting better,” she muttered.
have anything to do with radioactive spiders suddenly bursting into existence. But Steve had no idea how that kind of thing would even work; hell, he didn’t even know how the serum that made him into a super-soldier worked.
Peter was standing there. In his Spider-Man suit. With his mask removed.
There was a shift in the air when Thor, Valkyrie, and Rocket took off. The only ones remaining were Shuri, Okoye, Steve, Tony, Bruce, and a handful of grieving soldiers. Clint and Natasha stayed in New York to do damage control. No one said it out loud, but “damage control” was really code for
May hadn’t seen or heard from him since.
“No… no…
okay?” Peter’s tone was impatient enough that Tony could already see this conversation was going downhill fast. “I knew what the consequences could be when I decided to do this. No one else is going to find out. Steve wouldn’t -”
“Created the first skyscraper in New York that runs completely on renewable energy,” Peter pointed out.
He wanted to ask. What he said was, “It’s about Spider-Man. There’s something -”
Peter Parker, who fit the description of Spider-Man perfectly: small, young, agile; who had been looking Steve in the eye and lying to him for a month.
This was the part where they were supposed to kiss and make up, Tony knew. He was supposed to just accept that Steve wouldn’t hurt Peter, but Tony was rapidly derailing from angry to scared because he
May looked ready to faint.
Sam didn’t look convinced. “Yeah, well, I don’t mess with magic. Just stay away. We don’t need any more trouble than we’re already in.”
“He didn’t ask about Oscorp,” Peter said between bites. “He just asked boring stuff. What school I went to, what subjects I was interested in, why I wanted the internship. That sort of thing.”
“Wait! Wait.” Peter scrambled to his feet, pulling away from Sam to look him pleadingly in the eye. “He knows something. He can help us.”
“It’s okay. She won’t tell anyone. She won’t,” Tony said firmly at Peter’s raised eyebrows. “I promise.”
Something was wrong. She could feel it.
Peter knew that, to Bucky, who hadn’t been there, he was making absolutely no sense at all. Bucky took it in stride, though. “Well, things weren’t going much better in Wakanda.” He put a hand on Peter’s shoulder and started to guide him over to the group. Peter started recognizing faces: Wanda, Sam, T’Challa. The Guardians noticed them moving and they all met in the middle - well, if there was a “middle” to this endless expanse.
Peter didn’t know what to look at first: the bright lights and decorations, the celebrities, the ball gowns, the
It was almost ironic because Tony had worried himself sick about the danger he was putting Peter in by not telling May, by continuing to allow him to go out as Spider-Man, by pretending he had some control over the situation, by convincing himself that it would be worse if Peter was sneaking around behind his back instead. The truth was that it was just dangerous and stupid and Peter was a teenager and there was a list a mile long of things that could go wrong. (He knew that last one because Pepper told him all of the things on the list.)
Peter started to follow them, but Bucky turned and put a hand on his chest.
Steve couldn’t quite figure out why Tony was so opposed to him at first, but then he realized that strangers, and unfamiliar journalists in particular, were usually up to no good when they sought out Tony Stark’s company. Tony was rich, famous, smart, and handsome (Steve could admit that in the 21st century), and there were endless reasons for him to be suspicious of anyone looking to publicize the internal workings of his company.
“The Soul Stone,” said Peter, realizing it. “Nebula said that her sister -” He glanced at Quill, then continued, “died, when Thanos went to get it.
True to his word, Steve did not leak the story of Spider-Man’s identity to the papers. This was, of course, made easier by the fact that he was not actually a journalist. He had no one to tell. And despite his weak excuse to Tony about making the call to protect Peter, he’d meant what he said: He would never do anything that could potentially put Peter in danger.
Strange ignored him, continuing. “Out of 14 million possible future scenarios, I could see only one where we defeated Thanos. This is that scenario.”
Tony wasn’t sure what he was expecting to find – the blueprints of Stark Tower, maybe, with the Oscorp logo stamped on every page – but it was not this. He flipped through the pages, some of them catching in the light breeze coming across the park. It appeared that Steve actually did enjoy drawing. And he was
“I am Doctor Stephen Strange, Master of the mystic arts.”

As she approached the border, no one seemed to know what to do, until Thor suddenly shouted out and ran toward her. Apparently realizing that she couldn’t see him, he gestured to Okoye to lift the barrier. “She’s a friend!” It was the first time anyone had seen Thor smile since he arrived in Wakanda. It was the first time Steve could remember anyone smiling at all in three long days.
Tony dealt with their new reality like he dealt with a lot of things: by completely ignoring it until he couldn’t anymore. He kept his head down, avoided Steve for the next few days, and did his best to help everybody else: He helped Shuri invent entirely new weapons, untested, anything they could use on Thanos; he helped Okoye organize the remainder of the troops; he helped Nebula fix an injury in her wiring.
Tony couldn’t help it - he felt responsible for keeping Peter safe. After all, Peter wouldn’t even
Nat became more serious again. “No, it’s not you,” she said gently. “Frankly, I’m surprised that you’ve made it this far. You must have Pepper on your side.”
“This is for nanoparticles,” said Tony slowly. “What kind of experiment is a high school student doing that involves nanotechnology?”
As the ashes of Peter Parker slipped through his fingers, as his life blew away in the eerily silent wind of a strange planet, Tony realized that he was completely and utterly alone. Helpless. His genius brain couldn’t get him out of this one. There was no math that could fix this. There was no technology that would defeat Thanos, no calculation that would bring back Peter, bring back Strange, bring back the Guardians. There was no equation that could calculate the total physical and emotional loss that had just happened in the universe.
Tony wasn’t used to this. Well, he was used to being drunk at the holiday party. That wasn’t new. Historically, though, he was the messy kind of drunk that led to hooking up with people whose names he’d forgotten by morning, and he would wake up to Pepper giving him a lecture about how pictures of him looking completely plastered could be used as blackmail material in the wrong hands.
“He is no threat to you here,” Strange explained. “It seems that all of our powers are limited in the Soul World, and he is severely wounded. I brought him here because he knows more about this place than we do. He’s been here longer.”
A few days earlier, when he wasn’t playing Steve the Reporter and he was just Steve, he had decided to ask Natasha. She invited him over for a casual movie night, just the two of them, and they were watching
Steve was actually blushing, but he recovered quickly. “Tony, you should know that, legally or not… I was already yours.”
Tony sighed. Parenting a superhero kid was not easy.
They were both drunk - well, Tony thought Steve was drunk, but his voice was remarkably steady - and they had reached a point where Tony had practically heard Steve’s entire life story. People were starting to leave, and Tony was pretty sure that Peter’s aunt had picked him up hours ago, which meant that it was probably after midnight. It would have made sense for them to part ways for the evening at this point, but that was not what drunk Tony had in mind. Instead, he grabbed Steve by the wrist and said, “Come on.”
Peter shrugged. “No one, but I figured he would be there. I just thought it would be a good chance for you two to - uh, get to know each other more.” He was trying and failing to look innocent as he said this.
They all looked the worse for wear; everyone was grieving, panicking, or both. It was jarring and unnerving to go from fighting for your life to standing in an unexplainable void.
“I literally can’t imagine what you would be doing in the stratosphere,” said Tony dryly. “There’s a reason I didn’t give you a suit that could fly.”
The door had opened behind him, and he felt a rush of warm air as light spilled out onto the street before he was plunged into shadowy darkness again. He turned at the same time as he finished his sentence.
“Tony,” said Steve sharply. “Tony, wake up.”
. He’d like to write a piece about the prestigious internships that Stark Industries has to offer. He wants to interview Michelle and Peter, and you. I figured since Peter was already here -”
Steve, if that made sense, because this version was actually real.
this version of Steve just yet. What if this version of Steve was different from the Steve he’d gotten to know over the last few months? He had said nice things earlier, but that was when Peter was missing. It might have been an in-the-moment kind of thing.
Tony cleared his throat. “So.”
Peter wasn’t sure if he should ask, but he did anyway.
A strong hand grabbed his ankle. Peter cursed and tried to kick it away, but then he lost his footing. His attackers took advantage of his imbalance and yanked him down to the ground. They weren’t careful about it. It was a messy, short struggle as they all fell to the street together.
Peter Parker entered Tony Stark’s life as a bright-eyed intern, ready to learn and eager to please. The only problem was, Tony realized after three days of having Peter follow him around, he had no idea what interns were actually supposed to be
Strange looked like he had an impending headache. “The Soul World is expansive. It has to be, in order to fit half of the universe in it. You were all scattered about. I summoned you to this particular spot so that I could explain what was going on. I don’t know much more about this place than you do. I’ve read about it, but we all thought the Soul Stone was lost. No one knew where it was until Thanos had it. The Soul World was purely theoretical until -”
“What the -” Tony’s eyes flew open and his fist came flying at Steve’s face before he had fully woken up. Anticipating it, Steve easily caught his hand and deftly avoided a kick aimed at him in the same second.
“We don’t have a rocket launcher,” Pepper reminded him with a smile.
While they couldn’t speak for every galaxy in the universe, the galaxies they had visited were devastated by Thanos. The planets they saw were the same as Earth: Eerily quiet and desolate, or worse. As a result, they were unable to garner much support. The likelihood of reaching Thanos by word of mouth was slim. Unfortunately, it seemed that Thor’s optimistic plan to rally the universe around a common cause was unlikely to succeed. They would either need to keep searching the galaxies for him ad infinitum, or come up with a new plan.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat.
“My brother will go after Thanos himself,” Loki was saying. “From what I hear, he will be frustrated that he didn’t kill him the first time. Which means he’ll try to draw him back to Midgard.”
Steve’s eyes widened for a second, surprised, and then he huffed a laugh, ducking his head. And oh, there he was. So Steve the Reporter maybe wasn’t so different from Steve the… Captain America. “I - I didn’t want to lie to you, Tony,” he said, getting his expression back under control as he leveled a look at Tony with those earnest, blue eyes.
the search for Spider-Man. He’s had people on the case for months trying to figure it out. I was going to tell him that someone tipped me off, and it’s all just a big prank, some kids who are spreading rumors. I feel just as strongly about protecting Peter as you do. He shouldn’t have journalists chasing him around or have to worry about being caught all the time.” Tony was skeptical, but even he had to admit Steve sounded genuine. “Tony, you don’t have to trust me. But you should know that I would never do that to Peter. It’s my job to report on the internship, okay? Nothing else. I wouldn’t do anything to put Peter in danger. I realize it sounded bad, but I was trying to keep him safe.”
Unless they had the tech.
“I mean, it’s kind of funny,” said Peter.
Before, at first, Steve often succumbed to Tony’s incessant taunting and snapped back, the two of them bickering like an old married couple. And that initial spark turned into an uncontrollable fire, because even though Tony Stark infuriated him to no end when they were together, Steve suddenly found himself missing his voice when they were apart. They started spending more time together. They discovered that they were more alike than they thought initially: both stubborn, both proud, both lost and struggling without saying it to anyone.
Tonight was Steve’s warm gaze and expressive gestures, talking about his past without reservation. Tonight was Tony buying them a reckless number of drinks just to keep him talking. Tonight was staying in one place so that he had a good vantage point to keep an eye on Peter, even as MJ finally just grabbed his hand and led them to the dance floor, only to realize that Steve had been quietly keeping an eye on them, too.
Steve was about to see if he could contact Tony through the landline when there was a sharp knock on the door of his apartment. He frowned. No one knew he lived here except for Fury, Nat, and a scattered few of the others at SHIELD. Most of them would have called, and it was unlikely that he had missed a call in the short time since he had smashed his phone.
“Okay, I know why I have beef with them, but what's up with you two?” Tony asked, noticing Peter’s equally sour expression.
“I know it’s a lot to take in,” Pepper was saying calmly. Tony was impressed by her ability to handle this situation since Pepper herself had only just found out about Spider-Man. He was suddenly grateful for her ability to handle literally any situation because time was ticking and they needed to channel their emotions into finding Peter. “May, I know it’s a lot to take in. But let’s try and focus, shall we? When did you last see Peter? Can we start with that?”
“They don’t treat me like one of them,” he explained. He wasn’t sure why he was telling Loki this. “I’m not - I’m not more important than any of them just because I’m younger. I wish they would just treat me like everybody else.”
She tried to convince herself that Peter wasn’t in danger. He was probably with his friends. Or something. She couldn’t even think of a reason for him to have snuck out on his own, in the dark, in New York City, at nearly midnight.
“Is that a spider web?” One of the officers asked aloud.
The thing was, no one told Steve about the arc reactor, and he didn’t know how to ask without sounding rude. He only knew it was called an arc reactor because Peter mentioned it while he was babbling about all the cool things Tony had invented. Steve honestly didn’t remember how they got on the topic. Peter just talked constantly; it was inevitable that he would bring up Tony, because he seemed captivated by the man. It was endearing, but Steve couldn’t exactly press Peter for details about his mentor without him becoming suspicious.
“I won’t,” Peter mumbled.
Do you understand?”
Wherever “here” was.
Peter had come home upset. He had slammed the door and tossed his bag on the floor before he realized that she was home early, and then he immediately dropped his frown and greeted her with a forced smile instead.
“Not quite,” said Thor. He explained that since Thanos used the Soul Stone to make everyone disappear, it was likely that their souls existed somewhere… else. Somewhere unreachable. Someplace that no one had ever actually seen.
It took a few weeks, but their plan came together in two parts: Thor and Valkyrie, and Steve and Tony.
She wasn’t supposed to know about that, either.
There was nothing.
Steve felt like he was reading a strangely detailed Wikipedia page. How did SHIELD even know that Tony and Rhodes were friends? And that he was an alcoholic? Either he had since become sober or he hid it well, because Steve hadn’t noticed. Then again, he hadn’t been around very much. And he had a feeling that Tony was good at hiding things.
“Kid,” said Tony as he put on his sunglasses and pulled out of the parking lot, “I don’t know, okay? I don’t think Steve is going to publish anything. And if he does, I promise you I will make sure he regrets it. The problem is that once something like that is out there, it can’t be taken back. So if he changes his mind -”
“He sent a message.” Her voice was clipped, which told Steve that the situation was urgent but she couldn’t stop whatever she was doing to deal with it. Hence why Steve was on the other end of the line.
Things went haywire after the Spider Incident.
“This is Peter Parker,” said Fury, pointing to his picture, “and this is Michelle Jones. They were the interns that went with Stark and Pepper Potts to MIT that day. Your assignment is to go undercover as a reporter doing a story on their internships, so you have an excuse to ask questions. Your credentials are taken care of.” He handed Steve an ID hanging from the end of a lanyard, shiny and new, with his picture staring back at him. It said
sorry, Peter, no, no no… come back...”
“There’s a doctor here.” Steve wasn’t sure if that’s technically what Bruce was, but it would have to do. The hospitals were overrun; half of their staff was gone.
“Did you come up with the name Scarlet Witch or was it the media?”
“It’s fine; I asked,” said Steve, trying not to act too eager. Her vague description of
“What does that mean?” Quill had wandered over to see what was going on, followed by the other remaining Guardians.
The lobby of Stark Industries looked completely different decked out in holiday decorations. The ballroom (who knew they even had a ballroom?) was down the hallway, but the lobby had two bars, a long table with more food than Peter had ever seen in one place, and a crowd of hundreds milling around. Peter pushed his way past New York’s wealthiest to see if he could find someone he knew. After a few minutes of being shoved around, he decided to try the ballroom instead.
Also, I’m working on a new Stony fic, post-Infinity War, so keep an eye on my Tumblr @marvelsmostwanted for that. :) I think I'll post that one all at once, because clearly I cannot be trusted with WIPs!
you’ve been at your internship,” said Tony, smiling just a little too wide. “I wanted to come here in person and tell your aunt -”
“Johnny Storm, yeah, I get it. The Human Torch. You know, that’s not really funny.”
“I’m on my way, too.” He hung up before he could wonder what the hell he was doing.
All of the books and videos said so, anyway. But right now, Steve was bored out of his mind. He had been confined to SHIELD headquarters and his apartment for the last two months, and he was getting cabin fever. Even though he was technically allowed to access all of the stores, coffee shops, and restaurants on the block between his apartment building and SHIELD, it was starting to feel like he was on house arrest. He had been to every single one of those places, and now he even had a little routine: he went to the same place for his coffee each morning; he bought pizza from the same place every Friday night.
“Not even Steve?” Peter asked with a knowingly raised eyebrow. Tony didn’t like that eyebrow, didn’t like it at all.
Captain America was alive and well. Steve was cooperative, giving a handful of friendly interviews as Peter was quietly ushered away in the background, none of the paparazzi any the wiser.
Tony instinctively moved to block Steve’s view even though it was pointless. Peter’s eyes went wide, realizing his mistake too late. “Shit,” he breathed. There was a cut on his face, and the suit was ripped on the sleeve. “I was just looking for a first aid kit. I - I - uh -”
Loki continued, “Going after most of the Stones would be fruitless. The Mind Stone and the Power Stone wouldn’t bring us back. The Time Stone could, but again, they would have to take it out of the hands of Thanos himself. The Space Stone or the Reality Stone could also work, in theory, but even if they were able to get one of them from Thanos, they don’t know exactly where we are, so they wouldn’t know how to alter space or reality in order to bring us back. Which leaves -”
Tony refused to be embarrassed in front of a teenager. Staunchly refusing to think of a few moments ago when he and Steve were alone, he said, “He was - we were - discussing - uh, business.”
There were no windows in the workshop, and Tony hadn’t been paying any attention to the clock. He didn’t notice that morning had arrived until JARVIS interrupted his thoughts.
or even
Steve was shivering, standing on the sidewalk outside of SI. He could still hear the music booming inside, but the party seemed distant now that he had been so abruptly brought back to reality.
But that wasn’t how this worked.
“I’m Steve Rogers,” he said awkwardly to the robot girl as they made their way into the Tower. He wasn’t really in the mood for small talk, but he owed her a great deal. She brought Tony back.
Steve looked properly chastised, but he kept Tony’s gaze determinedly. “I understand,” he said sincerely, and when Tony didn’t look convinced, he added, “Tony. I would
“Thanks,” he said breathlessly.
None of them knew what to expect.
“I am Groot,” said Groot.
Bucky added, “Hopefully planning to save the world under the close supervision of Natasha.”
Even though Tony hadn’t technically done anything yet, the words left him feeling electrified, anticipation racing through his veins. Steve wanted this, too. He wasn’t imagining it. “Upstairs,” he said then. Feeling reckless, he took Steve by the hand and led him to the elevator.
He turned to find Steve the Reporter sitting on a park bench with a sketchbook open on his lap, looking up at him with a half-smile. Genuine surprise was difficult to fake, and Steve’s tone of voice didn’t sound like a man who had realized he had been followed here.
The argument was inevitable, really.
An echoing silence followed this proclamation.
“Tony’s not answering,” said Banner suddenly. He had climbed out of the Hulk suit now that the danger was gone, and he was holding a phone in his hand. “Pepper isn’t, either. I have no idea where Tony is, anyway. Last I knew, he was chasing Thanos into space after he hit New York.”
Tony’s mind was racing. “They didn’t mention the confession,” he realized. “The news. The threat they received was different than the one we did.” Of course. They were framing him. They were framing Tony for their mistake. The investigation into Oscorp was ongoing, but it wasn’t over. If Tony confessed to creating Spider-Man, then their company would avoid the blame. “Oscorp wants me to confess to creating Spider-Man so that they get away with setting radioactive spiders on a bunch of teenagers back at Science and Tech Day.”
“Huh,” Tony frowned. So this was what Steve the Reporter did in his spare time. He sat at the park and drew pictures of the world, probably right before he helped a little old lady across the street. Tony almost felt bad for following him. Except that he didn’t, and he wasn’t over his suspicion quite yet. “You’re pretty talented. A writer
“Like I said earlier,” said Sam finally, “we are never getting out of here.”
“We had a misunderstanding,” Tony confessed quickly, “and I am sorry about that. I was going to apologize to him today.”
“That dude,” Tony said, looking over his shoulder to a middle-aged man in a fedora walking a poodle, “
sent his thoughts racing. He knew that Howard hadn’t exactly been a great parent, and that he and his wife had died young. He hadn’t thought about how it affected Tony’s life. And it sounded like this former CEO took a toll on Tony as well. Steve was actually desperately curious to know more.
It was even more crowded in the ballroom, and louder. Music blared through giant speakers. Tables surrounded a wide space where some people were dancing, but most were just talking. The whole room was a swirl of tuxedos and high heels and glasses of champagne. Christmas lights hung from the ceiling, casting a twinkling glow across the whole scene. Peter felt even more overwhelmed here, and he was just about to give up and call Tony or Pepper or MJ to see if he could find them when he turned around and froze.
Steve shook his head, trying to stick as close to the truth as possible. “We… left each other on good terms. After the Army, things changed.” Technically, that was very true.
Steve huffed a laugh, and they separated for a minute so that Tony could properly take his tie off, but Tony just ended up pulling him closer instead. Steve leaned in again, and -
“Don’t go near him,” said a voice to his left, and he turned to see Sam with his arms crossed again, eyes on Loki. “He tried to destroy Earth once and nearly succeeded. I wouldn’t put it past him to try and destroy this place, too,” he told Peter darkly.
Tony’s voice split through Steve’s thoughts like a knife. He sat up in bed, startled. It sounded like Tony was right next to him, and for a disoriented moment, Steve looked around, confused - but of course, he was alone. His super hearing had picked up on Tony’s distraught whispers, several rooms away. Over the sound of his own heart pounding, Steve tried to focus on the distant noise. It wasn’t difficult to pick out Tony’s voice. There were only a few other noises at that hour of the night: Thor pouring a drink for Valkyrie, Nat softly talking to Clint, Bruce’s distant snore.
“Ned,” said Peter urgently at school the next day. “Can you keep a kitten at your house? Just for a while? May would never let me keep her in the apartment.”
His suspicion was confirmed as she confidently strode out of the room without waiting for an answer, her red hair like a beacon for him to follow.
good at it. Tony was no art critic (as Pepper frequently reminded him when he questioned her choices for the Tower’s gallery), but he was fairly sure that Steve the Reporter could do this as more than “just a hobby.” There were sketches of the city skyline in intricate detail. The next page showed a scene of the park. It appeared as though Steve had put thought into every line, every shadow, until the families picnicking and the cars rushing by in the background came to life in black and white.
He moved his feet, one at a time, to watch as the soldiers collected themselves. He owed it to them - and to Bucky, Sam, Wanda, T’Challa, and anyone else who had disappeared - to keep it together. He could fall apart later. The nightmares would come regardless of whether or not he kept going. So he kept going.
“What does that mean?” Peter piped up from behind Sam and Bucky.
As if Steve could read his mind, he said softly, “I meant what I said earlier. We’re all going to be here for you from now on. But before that happens, I think - I should apologize.” He frowned. “I’ve never been good at keeping secrets, and… that’s because I don’t like liars. I did it for a mission, but that’s no excuse. I shouldn’t have lied to you for all those months. You didn’t deserve that, and neither did Peter or MJ, and I’m sorry.”
“Peter was here,” Bruce said, meeting Tony’s gaze. “But Peter wouldn’t -” He trailed off, leaving a heavy silence between them.
Peter didn’t like this change of subject, feeling their scrutiny like a spotlight. He barely avoided a full-body flinch as the toe of a boot came in contact with his stomach as one of them lightly kicked him.
“Well, that’s your job to figure out,” said Sam, grinning. “Isn’t it? If this kid really got powers from some OsCorp tech gone wrong, then who wouldn’t want to get their hands on it?”
When Peter reached the eleventh floor, he started wishing he'd done more laps in gym when he had the chance. His heart was pounding and he was starting to sweat, but he kept going, one step at a time.
the kid. He’d grown fond of the way that Peter asked a million questions and interrupted his own sentences and rambled about Ned and MJ like they hung the moon. He knew Peter looked up to him, and he knew that if he was really going to be Peter’s part-time parent, then it was a long-term commitment and he needed to start by making amends for freaking out about Steve.
So why did Tony suddenly feel scared?
“He’s not you, Tony,” said Pepper softly.
He couldn’t believe he was actually here, physically, both of them alive to see each other again.
A small smile appeared on Natasha’s lips. “It’s Stark, isn’t it?” She shook her head. “What did he do this time?”
Bruce glanced up from his microscope, seemingly unconcerned. “Maybe he had a lot of homework,” he suggested.
danced through his head as he stared at the drawing of a man and woman, both in old-fashioned uniforms, both stunning. He felt Steve shift beside him, probably not sure how to respond. “Are these – people you know?” They looked vaguely familiar to Tony – maybe Steve had drawn them from photos in a book or a museum.
about all of this. He understood the impulse. Sitting around would drive him insane.
“What makes you say that?” He asked cautiously.
Bruce sighed and looked up from his work, putting it aside to come over to check Peter’s ears, eyes, lungs, and to take a tiny blood sample like he did every time Peter showed up. Peter sat still and cooperated, but continued to chatter through the whole thing.
The other Avengers looked at Loki with suspicion, but this was a strange time and a strange place, and they were in desperate need of information.
“Well?” MJ said expectantly, looking between them. “What are we waiting for?”
It had been so nice, in fact, that Steve didn’t want to think about it too much. He wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that he and Tony Stark might have been friends in another life.
Featuring the heart-to-heart between Loki and Peter Parker that you never knew you needed until now.
“Back to Earth?” T’Challa wondered aloud. “Surely that isn’t the best plan.”
Tony followed him on foot. He would have preferred to take a car to avoid being recognized, but Steve always walked to the Tower, so it wasn’t an option. Tony put on a leather jacket over his AC/DC t-shirt, and he donned a baseball cap and aviators to blend in. He waited ten seconds after Steve left the building, and then he snuck out a side door to follow.
Steve shook his head. The history of Tony’s company hadn’t seemed relevant to interviewing a couple of interns, so he hadn’t looked into it.
Tony, Shuri, and Bruce put their minds together to try and figure out the dynamics of the Soul Stone, but it turned out they weren’t necessary.
Peter flung himself to his feet and spun around, knocking one of the two men down with the chair as they shouted and flailed. He took advantage of their surprise and made for the door, only to be tripped up by the larger of the two, the one with the intimidating voice - he’d been right; the man was at least three times Peter’s size. His biceps were the same size as Peter’s head. He loomed over Peter, and raised his fist.
After a couple of weeks during which Tony worried and Bruce tried to reassure him that nothing was wrong, Peter started lingering around the lab again. He still wasn’t asking a lot of questions, not like normal. When Tony asked about school, though, Peter chattered on about Ned and MJ and what they were learning in chemistry and how terrible PE was, and it was almost like things were normal again, only then Tony noticed the second thing that felt off: Peter was working on something.
He heard one of the thugs say, “What the -” followed by a loud metallic clang echoing around the room. Peter opened his eyes to see a man in red, white, and blue standing over him, the two bad guys knocked out on the ground.
“We haven’t killed each other yet,” said Sam vaguely, and that was the whole answer to that question.
MJ and Ned were waiting with open arms when Peter finally extracted himself from his aunt.
“He is saying that we are dying,” Mantis translated. “The universe will not allow us to be stuck in limbo forever.”
Steve didn’t want to touch him, but he wasn’t waking up. Tentatively, heart pounding, he gently shook Tony’s shoulder.
He crept around the corner and spotted some students cowering behind tables. There were at least two other tables that had already been sawed in half by - were those laser beams? What the hell? There were five giant spiders prowling around, being generally creepy and occasionally, completely unpredictably, shooting off lasers towards the crowd of students. Peter had the advantage of surprise, so he used it to grab a chair no one was using. None of the students were paying any attention to him, their gazes locked on the spiders. Peter felt reckless and stupid and he really had no idea what he was doing, but MJ was up here somewhere and he was not about to let her, or any of these other kids, get hit by one of those lasers.
Avenue, sir.”
It was difficult to discern how time was passing in the Soul World. Dr. Strange had vanished with a vague explanation about finding “the others” and left them alone to contemplate their existence in this nothingness.
“Really?” Steve was surprised. What Sam was saying made sense, but something still didn’t add up. “But he hasn’t really done anything… wrong, has he? Why’s the government out to get him if he’s just some kid with a God complex, saving people?”
A loud, angry voice:
Or at least, it looked like a short distance. They seemed to be in a featureless space. The more Peter looked around, the less certain he was about exactly what he was seeing. There seemed to be no limits to the space. No walls or doors or buildings, just endless, whiteish fog. The only exception was the ground. It shimmered like water, only it didn’t feel wet. When Peter took a step toward Bucky, small ripples emanated from the spot where he put his foot down. It made no noise.
Despite his wounded outward appearance, he still managed to sound composed, his gaze alert as it flickered over Peter.
“Tony -” His blue eyes widened as Tony grabbed his tie and pulled him closer. Tony noticed every detail, from the sharp scent of his cologne to the way his cheeks flushed slightly. He leaned in. His intent really could not be mistaken. Steve took a breath, and Tony was so close to him that he felt his chest move up and down. “Tony, I’m not saying that I don’t want to do this but if we stay here, someone will see.”
The room was abuzz with questions, reporters shouting over each other until finally, one could be heard clearly over the others: “Mr. Stark, can you prove that Oscorp created Spider-Man?”
“I do not believe we are dead,” T’Challa added. “I have seen the other side of life, and it does not look like this.”
The annual Stark Industries holiday party was originally a gathering for SI employees only. It was a chance to to celebrate their successes from the year and blow off some steam before departing for their holiday break. Over the years, the party had become more and more extravagant, and these days it was one of New York City’s most anticipated events of the year. Anyone who was anyone was invited to Stark Tower for one night only. It was attended by celebrities, billionaires, politicians, and various scientists who always looked a little out of place among the glitz and glam, nervously hurrying past the hordes of paparazzi outside on their way in. The scientists came for the networking opportunity and the socialites came to be seen. It was a partier’s party.
“What? No, I - I didn’t -”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s –“ Steve began haltingly.
“Maybe not,” Loki shrugged, “but it could take years to find Thanos by searching the galaxies. Much more time efficient to draw him out. However, I’m sure that our friends on Midgard will be mindful of the fact that like the first time, their plan may not work. If they can’t literally chop off Thanos’ hand, then they’ll need a different course of action.”
Steve could literally hear Tony tossing and turning, could practically feel his anguish.
“- you should know.”
Peter looked down at his shoes, avoiding Loki’s gaze and focusing instead on shimmery, mysterious ground beneath his feet.
It bothered her a lot more now. It was obvious that Peter had lied. Why would he sneak out if he was just going to Ned’s? Looking back, it was a weak excuse that she had been willing to look past because she was just relieved that Peter was okay. He didn’t show any signs of having been out partying or anything like that, so she didn’t feel the need to follow up on it. Now, she wished she had been more strict in insisting on finding out just what he had been doing that night. Whatever it was, her instincts were screaming that it wasn’t good. Anything that had her nephew - her genius, nerdy, Star Wars-loving nephew - sneaking out in the middle of the night through his window couldn’t possibly be good.
do anything to hurt Peter.” He searched Tony’s gaze. “What you overheard - it’s not what you think.”
“Wait,” said Banner haltingly. “You mean, they’re not - dead?”
The two of them holed up in the corner of the bar felt cozy despite the people milling around them, the curious gazes that landed on them, and the general chaos of the party. It felt domestic, somehow, and right. Like they could just sit here and talk forever. But they couldn’t, and Tony was never one to let things lie.
They were going to rescue Peter.
“I - I -”
“Oh, we’re definitely interested in MIT,” she said emphatically. “Aren’t we, Peter?”
“But you aren’t just like everybody else, are you?” Loki asked. Before Peter could get insulted, the god continued, “You’re far too young to know what it takes to be a hero. The sacrifices. The sleepless nights. The things you thought you would never be capable of doing, but did anyway.”
“More likely she’ll ask him,” said Tony, laughing.
Eventually, they worked out a sort-of schedule: Peter spent the morning helping Bruce in his lab, doing boring intern things like cleaning lab equipment and recording data in Excel. In the afternoon, he joined Tony in his workshop to observe whatever project Tony happened to be working on. It gave him a glimpse into Tony Stark's brain, which meant the afternoons were chaotic and sometimes involved explosions. On any given day, Tony could be working on anything from the Iron Man suit to the computer code that created JARVIS. It wasn't exactly a comprehensive education since most of the calculations happened in Tony's head, but Peter always seemed fascinated anyway.
Which Peter was giving to him now.
Peter hugged May first, and she held him so tight it looked like it hurt. There were more than a few tears as May half-heartedly scolded him for not telling her, and then pulled him in for another hug.
“Kid?” Steve asked. He knew the man was described as small, fast, and agile, but he hadn’t heard anyone refer to Spider-Man as a kid. For some reason, he’d just assumed Spider-Man was an adult.
Tony looked at Steve for any sign that he had known the paparazzi was coming – but it would have been nearly impossible for Steve to anticipate that Tony was going to follow him and organize this without Tony noticing – and he looked even more surprised than Tony at the turn of events. “Yeah, I suppose so. Listen, will it bother you a lot if those pictures end up in the tabloids?” As they stood, Tony put a hand on Steve’s shoulder and led him away from their personal photographer. “Because I don’t really care, but Pepper can work her magic and make them disappear if that’s what you want.”
Peter wasn’t religious, but if he had to guess, Bucky was right: This was some kind of limbo. Maybe not between heaven and hell, but between universes or something like that.
They all froze, looking at the vibrating Stark Phone like it was about to explode. Tony said, “Jarv -”
It took a few weeks, but the walls around Steve's SHIELD colleagues started to come down. He learned that Natasha was from Russia, a place neither of them were eager to visit again, and that she had been trained someplace called the Red Room. In turn, he told Nat about Peggy and Bucky and the men he lost in the war, and the friends he lost after he woke up. In some small way, knowing that he wasn’t the only one with a mysterious past made him feel slightly less alien in this century. It also helped that Natasha was never starstruck around him. She didn’t seemed impressed by his super strength when they were sparring, and even encouraged him not to hold back. It was nice to have someone around who didn’t treat him with kid gloves, or like he was some sort of celebrity.
“Natasha,” Steve interrupted. Her gaze snapped back to him. “Go to New York.” A plan was forming in his head. An actual plan. “You and Hawkeye take the lead. Assess the damage. Find out if there’s anyone left - anyone - who knows how to defeat Thanos. I don’t care who - Deadpool, the X-Men, whoever you can find to help. Report back to me. Keep the city safe in the meantime. You know how to do damage control, or at least, however much you can.”
MJ was in the middle of listening to a kind middle-aged professor give a very boring talk when they had been suddenly interrupted by a blaring emergency alarm. At first, she thought it was just a fire drill or something stupid. But when they got outside the classroom, they had been met by a wave of giant creepy glowing spiders crawling up the walls.
If only he knew where Tony was.
Steve was sure that Rhodey didn’t intend to put the literal weight of the universe on his shoulders, but he found that it was an impossible question to answer.
“I have no idea,” said Peter, and he stepped forward with the intention of killing Spider 3, feeling better now that he knew they could be killed. Only he forgot about the laser beams part. And then it lasered him in the leg.
“Really, because that’s what it fucking sounded like, Steve. It sounded like you were about to sell Peter out thirty seconds after finding out his secret.”
Nat sighed. “I didn’t think so. Look, it’s not exactly my place to tell you what happened, but suffice it to say it’s a long story. One that changed Tony. A lot. I wasn’t there to spy on him, but against my better judgement, I got to know him pretty well anyway. Tony isn’t a bad guy, he’s just –” She searched for the right words. “He was raised by wealthy parents who had no idea how to take care of a child, and then he went through a series of traumatic experiences as a young adult that shaped who he became. And at first, he became an asshole,” she said bluntly. “He was a mess. The partying was out of control. He was reckless with his money, and he didn’t care. The mission that I was sent on – it changed all of that. Like I said, it made Tony a different person when Obe- when he went through that. I doubt his interpersonal skills have improved much,” she said dryly, “but he is trying. Or he was, when I was there.” She frowned. “Sorry, I was required to give my opinion for a psych analysis of him after my mission, so there’s plenty I could say on the subject.”
It took him two days after the night Steve found him shouting out, but he finally said Peter’s name aloud. Admitted defeat. Like the rest of them, he had become a person who existed only to bear the weight of what he had lost.
“Please, no. Not him. Take me instead…
like him. But his protective streak meant that he simply couldn’t trust him anymore.
Tony honestly didn’t know. It did seem out of character for Peter to sneak around and steal their lab equipment, but he
“Oh, God, that is so cheesy,” MJ interrupted, face-palming.
“We need help,” said Steve gravely. “Banner believes there is a way to defeat Thanos. We’re trying to find Tony Stark. We think he could have answers as well.”
And just like that, the entire city joined their search for Spider-Man and Osborne.
This was why Tony only had three friends. Things were much safer that way.
Thor, somehow, remained optimistic about defeating Thanos despite the unspeakable losses they had suffered. It was almost as if everything had gone so wrong and become so twisted that Thor was left with no choice but to carry on. He was on the edge of desperation just like all of them, and for the first time that Tony could remember, he looked tired. Dark circles appeared like shadows under his watchful eyes, and even his long hair was looking a little defeated these days. Tony didn’t understand; weren’t gods supposed to look perfect all the time? It was equal parts distressing and motivational: On the one hand, it couldn’t be good that even Thor was worn down. On the other hand, he was still making plans to defeat Thanos and if he could do it, then so could the rest of them. He gave them something to rally around.
All four of them turned at the sound of a familiar voice. MJ was walking toward them - how did she get in; there were security protocols - and she was accompanied by, of all people, Steve. Steve the Reporter.
“Hello? Anybody home?” Sam asked when Steve didn’t respond to something he had said.
Great. This was going great.
Didn’t any of them realize that Peter was just as invested in keeping
Pepper watched Tony and Peter bothering Bruce in the lab, Steve rolling his eyes at their antics. She smiled and turned away, heels clicking on the floor as she got in the elevator. She pressed the button for the lobby. She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and prepared herself.
“He is,” said Steve, too quickly.
“Yeah, call Bruce anyway,” said Tony even as Peter rolled his eyes. God, he was such a teenager.
“Whoa, slow down,” said Tony, awkwardly patting his back. “Listen, kid - first of all, you can call me Tony. We’re at that point. And I know you’re sorry. Getting kidnapped usually does that to people. Someday, I’ll tell you all about the time I got kidnapped. But don’t worry about any of that right now. I’m just glad you’re safe.”
“Breathe with me.” Steve met his gaze and spoke with authority, as if he had handled this situation before. Maybe he had. Or maybe he just knew Tony so well that it was actually frightening. “Peter’s going to be okay,” he said as Tony’s breath started to even out. Tony didn’t take his eyes off of Steve’s steady gaze, the calmest shade of blue. “I’m going to find him, and we’re going to fix this. In a few hours, Peter will be back. Good as new.”
He wasn’t quick enough.
He leaned against the bar and eyed Steve up and down with dark eyes. It would have been too blatant if it were anyone other than Tony, but it just made Steve feel the need to stand up straighter.
“You should go,” Tony heard himself say. He wasn’t sure why. His heart was pounding just as loudly as before, only now it was anxiety, not anticipation. He didn’t know what else to do - Steve knew. Steve
“He’s coming back?” Tony demanded. When Peter nodded, he rolled his eyes. “Oh, God.” And he had
“Tony -” Steve started. “This - it’s not what you think -”
Update 1/1/19: Fixed a few typos and inconsistencies.
“Yes, sir,” said Steve. He didn’t have a good feeling about this.
Peter and Tony meet Steve the Reporter, Steve and Tony get lunch together, Natasha gives Steve some advice, and Steve does some digging.
“Who says Steve was invited?” Tony asked, even as he started plotting in his head. Inviting Steve would mean getting to see Steve in action - he could see who Steve talked to, who he ignored, what he took sneaky pictures of when he thought no one was looking - and it would be a great opportunity to find out just what he was up to.
About an hour after that, they ordered Thai from Peter’s favorite place a few blocks over and shared a quiet dinner. Peter didn’t open up any more about his day. After dinner, he took a shower before retreating to his room again, claiming he still had schoolwork to finish.
He knew this night was too good to last.
Peter mouthed. He rolled his eyes.
“It depends on when you show up,” Tony said in response to his earlier question. “As often as possible, if it were up to me. We need to know that your powers aren’t changing or doing anything weird to your body.”
“There are rumors that when someone is sacrificed for the Soul Stone, that person remains in limbo, so to speak,” she said. “The theory is that the Soul Stone works because it possesses the sacrificed soul. If it is stolen or lost, or if a new sacrifice is made, then the person wielding it is no longer worthy. And the sacrificed soul would leave limbo and move on to death.”
“Dr. Strange said his powers wouldn’t work here,” Peter pointed out.
As soon as Steve launched into his apology, Tony’s fear melted away. This was the same Steve. His Steve. This version was even
“- then he could do it again.” Steve held back from rolling his eyes. He wasn’t sure what type of person Tony Stark was, just yet, but he was familiar with scientists who wanted to replicate the serum. They all wanted to play God or to create an army of super-soldiers. It never ended well.
Steve and Tony watched the friends reunite with equally fond gazes. Finally, Peter turned to them. He threw himself into Tony’s arms first.
Speaking of stress, Pepper was starting to feel her own nerves get worked up just being around these teenagers. What happened to the open-minded, confident applicants they had been on paper? She did not have time to go through a whole batch of applications all over again if none of these kids cut it. She hoped they came out of their shells in the interviews. Pepper was finally able to relax when, after showing them an entire floor of state-of-the-art labs, one of them - a girl with her hair in a messy bun and a general air of carelessness about her that somehow reminded Pepper of Tony - raised her hand.
at once, Tony worried that this wouldn’t be the last of their problems. What if Peter suddenly grew eight eyes or legs? They had no idea if, or when, the after-effects of the bite would subside. Would Peter be climbing up the side of a building one day and suddenly lose his ability to stick to things? Tony worried himself sick. Finally, Bruce threatened to turn into the Hulk if Tony kept stressing him out. Bruce ended up kicking Tony out of the lab and forcing him to work on something else for a few days.
She raised an eyebrow. “Well, then, I hope you find him.” She took another drink. “And I hope he knows what he’s doing.”
“I have an above average IQ,” he admitted. “But I thought you knew - I mean, MJ and I go to a science school for nerds. So. That's usually kind of a giveaway.”
“The call was untraceable,” JARVIS confirmed his suspicion.
“Probably none of them,” said Tony. “Hey, kid, time for your bi-weekly checkup.”
“Uh,” said Tony as he turned the page. “This is really good.” That was all that he, Tony Stark, genius billionaire, could come up with. Words like
Tony smiled brightly. “Oh, I’ll make sure of it,” he promised.
And that’s how Tony ended up sitting side-by-side with Steve the Reporter on a park bench eating a hot dog instead of doing the undercover stake-out he had originally planned.
W A K A N D A
He seemed embarrassed about it, but Tony wasn't having that. “Uh, I didn't exactly read your resume. I figured Pepper did that sort of thing. But there's no need to be ashamed of your nerd school, kid. I went to high school for one year and then I graduated from MIT at 17. It doesn't get nerdier than that.”
“In my defense, I was planning to climb down the tree, but I wasn’t expecting the explosion -”
Peter had gotten out of the car while Tony was talking and slammed the door shut in the middle of a sentence.
“He’s on his way to New York already to assess the damage,” said Natasha. From the tone of her voice, Steve could tell that she was worried. And annoyed. “He shouldn’t have gone alone,” she added when she could feel Steve’s curious gaze. “I mean, who does that? Your entire family just vanishes into thin air and you jump on a plane and - where did he even get a plane, I swear to God -” Her eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t seem to realize it.
been fishing around in a drawer the other day when Tony was out of the room….

A few nights later, Tony figured it out.
After perusing the inventions for a solid hour, Peter and MJ were ushered into a workshop on the potential merits of underground travel, led by Tony himself. It was actually supposed to be on his latest updates to the Stark phone (which included the ability to start your car remotely and project images holographically) but he apparently changed his mind after seeing the flying car. It was still completely fascinating and Peter loved seeing Tony in his element. Even though he claimed to hate these events, it was obvious that Tony enjoyed the opportunity to teach others about things he thought about on a daily basis, which were completely novel to his captivated audience.
Sam literally took Peter by the scruff of his neck and tugged him away from Loki while Bucky moved in close to Loki, Wanda glaring intimidatingly beside him.
They said their good-byes and Tony was almost to his car when Peter came running after him. “Here,” he said, handing him a rather heavy black bag. “It’s the microscope.” His face was beet red. “I’m really sorry, Mr. Stark. I shouldn’t have -”
“I summoned you here,” said a voice from behind them. Stephen Strange looked ethereal here, the only one who seemed comfortable in this space between worlds. He also just appeared from out of nowhere.
Pepper burst into tears in front of him and berated him for two hours about
“Tony,” Steve tried to interrupt.
Morbidly curious, he read on.
Tony stepped closer and lowered his voice so that Steve, who was standing behind them as if he was afraid to say anything, couldn’t hear. “She can call Bruce,” Tony added, “if you need Bruce. Do you need Bruce? Are you okay? What happened?”
The quiet apartment suddenly seemed eerie. “Peter?” May said one more time before she tried the door. It was unlocked. It swung open to reveal an empty room.
Tony understood that he had been dismissed. As he walked back toward the labs, he formulated a new plan. Despite the documentation he had just seen, he still didn’t trust Steve the Reporter. He was too convenient, too timely, too… handsome, was the word that popped into Tony’s head. It didn’t make logical sense, but Tony felt like something was off.
He told her everything.
The situation started to look up when Peter realized that he could focus his hearing when he was in a situation where he was forced to have all of his attention on one thing. Quiet moments were the worst - Peter had an exam one day and he was nearly driven insane by the clock ticking, pencils scratching, cars honking across town, to the extent that he had to ask to put his headphones in so he could focus - but adrenaline-inducing situations allowed him to drown everything else out. One day, he was in gym class and he saw some kids picking on Ned. It was like the rest of the world didn’t exist as Peter approached them. He excitedly told Tony about how he and Ned totally got beat up, but it was apparently worth it because Peter could hear exactly what the bullies were saying the whole time.
“Who would we sacrifice?” Steve demanded. “I mean - I’m willing to go, but -”
His hands were shaking. Breathe in, breathe out. The ashes kept slipping away into the air, further and further out of reach.
“Tony’s on his way to New York,” she said before Steve could finish saying
It turned out that Steve the Reporter, aside from being a talented writer, excellent artist, and generally handsome person, was also decent company. They sat on the bench and got to talking about Steve’s habit of people-watching in Central Park.
“I will not be paying the ransom,” said Tony, loud and clear. “I will not be threatened by people who would do something as low as kidnapping a child. You heard me: A child. Spider-Man is sixteen years old. He gained his powers after an accident involving radioactive spiders at MIT earlier this year. The accident could have killed him, but it gave him powers instead. This kidnapping and the ransom demand are an attempt to cover up that story. Oscorp created Spider-Man that day. And Oscorp has him now. They’re trying to use this as an opportunity to pin the blame on me.”
“I - I - an experiment?” Peter said meekly, but Tony wasn’t buying that.
“What’s going on? Where are we? Where is everybody?” Peter’s thoughts had started catching up with him, and now he remembered everything: Thanos, traveling to
cold, and I was thinking about how the suit could maybe be more insulated – not that I’m complaining. It’s great and all. But it just got me thinking, what if I’m up really high like you told me you were that one time and you almost froze?”
“Pepper, Pep,” he was stammering, mind racing faster than his mouth could form words. “Pep, the - the - Oscorp. Phone. Biting people. Remember?”
He stopped a robbery at a corner store. He saved someone crossing the street from an oncoming taxi. He scared off some guys having a fight in a back alley, and then he stopped to have a churro.
Bucky had said
It was snowing out and Peter was missing and May was crying in Tony’s kitchen. Pepper, who had showed up right on cue after May started yelling at Tony for letting Peter become a vigilante, handed May a steaming cup of tea.
“Where are you going,” Tony muttered to himself when they had been doing this little dance for about fifteen minutes and he lost sight of Steve again. This time, he didn’t see him anywhere. “JARVIS, location,” he said aloud as he paused at an intersection, unsure if he should cross the street or take a left and continue on the sidewalk.
“- because he’s a journalist, but he has proven time and time again that he is not going to turn on us, okay?” Peter finally stopped pointing his finger and just looked a little lost, like he too had realized that he was starting to act like Tony. He took on a gentler tone. “I just think you’re being too cautious about this, Mr. Stark. I understand why you’re worried, but Steve is not a bad guy, I can just tell -”
Kind/constructive comments and kudos appreciated :) I'm @marvelsmostwanted on Tumblr if you want to message/follow me/yell at me.
“Mr. Parker,” said Loki smoothly. “I was wondering when curiosity would get the better of you.”
Some of the students made it to the staircase before the first giant spider - and they were really giant, like three feet across - made it up and over the balcony and started shooting some kind of laser beams at them. That sent the rest of the class and the professor screaming, running, and hiding behind all available tables, desks, and chairs.  MJ didn't scream because she wanted to put off panicking as long as she plausibly could. Panicking was stupid. It made people do stupid things. So, she tried to stay calm and hid behind a bookshelf with a chair for a weapon in case she had to fight one off. So far, no one had been hurt, as far as she could tell, but a few of the tables that had been used as makeshift shields had been instantly cut into two by the lasers and the students behind them screamed and scattered. MJ even let one girl join her behind her bookshelf. She didn't like the way this was going.
“I couldn’t die because of the experiments they did on me. I’ve been unconscious a lot. Sometimes I would black out and then wake up as the Winter Soldier, or as myself.” He frowned. “Death was not an option for a long time. And I don’t think this is it, either.”
“Don’t you want to know how I did it?” He asked tentatively.
For reasons he couldn’t quite explain, he didn’t call Coulson back. And he didn’t tell Fury, either.
As if someone had just snapped their fingers.
Tony hadn’t been to Central Park in ages – mostly because he would be recognized – but he had flown over it a number of times, and it was always a sight to behold. Today, it was overflowing with family picnics and Frisbee players. It was sort of peaceful to walk through.
“You think he…” Steve trailed off, because he actually couldn’t even fathom what Fury was trying to imply. Sure, it was unlikely that a vigilante who could climb walls and shoot a web-like substance
“You bastard. If any -
go, and you can just -”
Steve said unthinkingly, “Yeah, I know.” When Tony blinked at him, he added quickly, “I mean, it’s what he was known for, right?”
Peter’s mind flashed to Germany, to fighting Captain America at an airport before Tony finally told him to just stay down. He thought of a ship breaking in two before his eyes, and his desperate attempts to fix it before Tony arrived to save the day again.
“Should we move him?” The second voice asked hesitantly. “Just in case they find -”
“Army, huh?” Tony raised an eyebrow. “I don’t remember Pepper mentioning that being in your file.” Tony was being fairly blatant about his suspicion, and for some reason, with a drink in his hand, Steve was determined to convince him that he was trustworthy. It went beyond the scope of the mission - he didn’t really care if Tony trusted him as a journalist. For some reason, he really wanted Tony to like him as a person.
- about this gets into the media,” Tony hissed, fist shaking slightly, “I will sue you and your organization for everything you are worth and more. And then I will drag your name through the mud so thoroughly that you will never be able to get a job in journalism ever again. And I mean that,” he warned. “I know your paper wouldn’t even publish a story like that without proof. But if any
“Tony doesn’t trust anybody,” MJ pointed out, “except Pepper. And his friend Rhodey that he talks about sometimes.”
As Sam and Bucky faded into the foggy, featureless distance, Peter did as he was told, even though he knew Bucky was just trying to distract him. It was incredibly frustrating that even here, in existential limbo, the adults didn’t want his help.
“Tony -” Steve was insistent, but his voice was cutting in and out. He sounded different, Tony thought; something was wrong. What
The only benefit to the challenge of finding Steve was that it meant Steve likely hadn’t realized he was being followed. Unless, Tony thought darkly, he’d been trained to shake a tail. “Scanning for facial recognition,” said JARVIS. “This may take up to 30 minutes given heavy crowds.” Tony groaned. Steve chose the perfect place to disappear: Central Park on a sunny day. There were thousands of people in the immediate area and it would take forever to sort through them all. Before giving up, he decided to continue on foot. He couldn’t have gotten that far.
The someone in question was a graduate student working as a lab assistant, and he checked over the laptop in his arms, apparently determining that no damage was done, before moving on to the elevator. He re-emerged on the fourth floor, which was entirely state-of-the-art lab space. He greeted Dr. Bruce Banner. It appeared that the doctor had been waiting for him. They started walking and talking at the same time, Bruce tapping away at the tablet in his hands while the student listened intently. They passed another researcher as they walked, another young man, who threw a greeting to Bruce as he rushed past to the elevator.
say he was hot anywhere in that sentence,” Peter insisted.
Tony looked around. “I’m sorry, has everyone gone deaf suddenly? I said no. I mean, really? Pep, I haven’t even seen any press credentials on this guy.”
“The English word for what I do is ‘telekinesis.’”
It was only Day 57 of living in this century when Natasha Romanoff entered his life, or more specifically, his gym, and made things less boring.
