He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he didn’t hear Natasha and Bruce leave. He just fell asleep in the upright position, his hand still settled atop Tony’s and his chin laying on his chest.
he said.
The rest of the Avengers had found the whole debacle immensely amusing. Clint especially loved to poke fun at the stories where Tony was an evil seducer that turned Captain America gay.
he murmured. His voice was so quiet Clint could hardly hear him but Fury's expression said that it was loud enough.
Bruce’s hands were already flying across the Stark tablet he must have brought from the car.
Steve looked down at the tablet, powering it on. He hoped this would give him some answers. It powered up and had a small circle in the middle that said
Tony murmured with a smile on his face.
the genius growled. The flex cage had apparently attacked a lamp. A lamp that was somehow attached to faux feet covered in purple socks. How the fuck had the man seen through his plan? Or avoided the spiders? Even though Clint clearly set off the trap on purpose with the lamp, the spiders should still have frightened him. Where was the birdbrain anyway?
Shaking his head, Steve headed for the door. He was supposed to spar with Natasha today, and he probably shouldn’t smell like sex for that. For her sake.
Steve asked, and he made it sound like a trap. Like whatever Tony said next might lead into unknown consequences.
Everyone waited patiently, and it was far nicer than Tony deserved.
Clint countered.
He walked closer, lighting up the dark corner with his gauntlet. Now that he could see, it was definitely injured. The person, Tony decided, looked like an adult male humanoid, though in the repulsor’s light it was hard to tell if the skin was just sickly pale or a grey colour. He certainly had red blood with the way he had dried gashes and bloody bandages all over his body.
Steve crossed his arms, pursing his lips in annoyance until Tony added,
to the tower, effectively waking up any Avenger who wasn’t already up. Tony just remained sitting on the floor, gaping at the doorway where Clint had left.
Coulson laid a hand on Clint’s shoulder, rubbing some of the coiled tension away.
Tony looked at the calculations in front of him. Ideally, the reactor should be able to recharge fast enough to make up for the extra power usage, but Strange did say things may not work normally here.
Steve scrubbed his tears out of the way so he could get a proper look. He was already taking apart the suit, muscle memory taking over.
They laid there for a few more moments, just content in each others’ company. When Tony sat up, Steve had to stop himself from whimpering. He wanted the genius to stay there, but he knew there was work to be done. Tony seemed to read his mind, because he turned to give Steve a long, deep kiss that left them both slightly breathless.
He quickly swept away the extraneous tables he had created leaving the mess a little less cluttered.
It was when Tony placed his sixth empty champagne glass on a tray behind him that Steve realized what was bothering him. Out of the thirty or so roaming servers in the room, the same one always seemed to gravitate towards them. Tony had only come in contact with the one waiter, though he probably didn’t notice at all. At first, it could’ve been explained away by the staff having assigned areas of the room. By now, though, Steve and Tony had been all over the large hall, Tony being one of the main draws of the event. They had to talk to all the big SI contributors.
a chuckle,
She looked up at him with tears hanging from the outer corners of her eyes. She took a breath to say something, but she shuddered one last time as the breath left her. She was gone.
Fury looked at her intently but she didn't flinch.
Tony said defiantly. He pursed his lips and crossed his arms.
Loki drawled. A brief look of disgust passed over his face before it returned to its usual smugness. Thor was standing behind him looking equally smug. Steve thought they looked more like brothers than enemies then, even if Loki had been adopted.
she stopped him.
to read Curse first, but it's more fun that way. As promised, any of these chapters can be read as one shots, and some of them are not even compatible with each other as one timeline, but this one is a continuation.

The sorcerer looked like he might be losing. It was hard to tell, because some of the attacks seemed to be mental or invisible, and some of them were energy beams. What he could tell was that Strange’s reactions were getting slower, and his screams weaker.
Steve shouted after him desperately. Why wouldn’t the man ever just listen?
Clint whined from his spot on the floor. He was leaning against Phil’s legs against the armchair, and the SHIELD agent was mindlessly playing with his hair, eyes closed.
At her nod he asked,
The bad Microsoft Word Art at the top said
Her voice was slightly gravelly. They both knew she was putting on a brave face. Even the slightest cold, if it lasted too long, could quickly throw an opera star into oblivion, forgotten.
She gasped in surprise.
Clint waved his hand dismissively.
Tony had a bad habit in antagonizing his captors. SHIELD had tried to teach him repeatedly how to undergo torture successfully, but their methods of merely repeating one’s name and identification code did not work for him. He only remained motivated to stay alive by maintaining his adversarial, sarcastic attitude. Otherwise he’d crumble.
JARVIS said as they stepped into the elevator. Tony gave a thumb up as he couldn’t speak because he had already begun attacking Steve’s mouth, pushing him against the wall. Steve moaned and gently pushed Tony off of him.
Sarcasm and humor were something Tony could deal with; a realm of comfort. Bruce was good at this.
he asked.
he said carefully. Why did he sound like he was walking on eggshells? Like Tony might blow up at him?
This was really all about Howard bankrupting Stone? That was over twenty years ago. Tony and Ty had only been children, barely broaching adulthood, how could Ty blame him? He’d had people hate him because of Howard before, it was nothing new, but never someone who really knew him. How long would he be haunted by the actions of Howard? The man made his life miserable enough as a child; it’d be nice if he could give it a rest from beyond the grave. His only hope was that someone would find the sudden vacation suspicious. Maybe Steve. Steve seemed to like him recently, like maybe he thought Tony wasn’t like the tabloids said. Steve looked at him with fond smiles and listened to his ranting with patience. Steve defended him when reporters shouted nasty questions no matter how many times Tony told him to let it be. He smiled at the memories.
Tony waved her off, already switching mindsets to design new components for the suit to deal with future possibilities. Maybe a toxin scanner? Yeah, it could check his blood toxicity like what he used when he was dealing with the whole palladium poisoning thing…
Steve felt sick. Tony had to continue to endure this agony for hours. Steve returned the hospital room where the center of his universe was squirming in bed. Tony watched him sit down beside the bed, dried trails of salt on his cheeks where he had been crying. Steve didn’t know what to do. How could he help? He wished fervently that he could switch places with the genius.
Tony leaned forward so Clint could see him better around the light fixture on the wall between them.
he asked, finally.
Tony begged that morning.
item on his mental list of
Steve took Tony’s clothes out of a bag and started to help him get dressed, but Tony refused.
Agent Boring:
Tony quashed the panic, there was no time. He lifted the faceplate of the suit as he lifted Jones’ light body onto the ground above so he could give mouth to mouth. He heard Steve sigh in relief with him when the girl gasped and began heaving in air on her own. When her eyes fluttered open, she was met with Tony’s concerned face. She wasn’t dead. Jessica began crying with relief, and the Tony Stark caressed her face.
She offered, as though any sane person would refuse that. He nodded.
It took several moments of gasping for his breathing to resemble normal again, and his sight to slowly make sense again. The details in front of him were blurry, but coming back like a camera being brought into focus. Steve was right there in his face. “Oh god,” he managed before pushing the man away and heaving. Stomach emptied, he laid back and promptly passed out.
he answered without missing a beat. Steve’s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they’d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fiancé. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he’d like to see Howard’s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.
was all he said. He clasped his hands together, sweeping his gaze across the three of them.
Tony scoffed. Given the myriad of instances Clint could cite where that was clearly not the case, he decided it was a pointless debate. He would never win it without one of the others to back him up.
So Iron Man had showed up to the battle ready to leave, and he went in hard. Loki’s magical birds that were harassing citizens and stealing food were felled in ten seconds flat when Iron Man shot small bullets at them all simultaneously. Loki’s grin had quickly morphed into a snarl,
the nurse caught his arm.
Steve gestured at all of Tony as if it explained everything.
she exclaimed. It was the first Tony heard her voice, and it sounded less humanoid than he had expected. The closest he could probably get to describing it was that it sounded like a few differently pitched voices speaking in unison. There was emotional inflection, which bode well for his hypothesis that she was an android and not a robot, unless she was just programmed to seem emotional like is LMDs (Life Model Decoy).
It was amazing how Coulson’s entire demeanor and tone changed immediately as soon as official business was put away. He stood and gave Tony’s leg a reassuring squeeze.
That wasn’t his wife. Maria’s understudy entered in her place. Where was Maria? Why was she not there? She had been fine when she left the house. Frank focused on his breathing, making sure he didn’t let the panic start. The kids were here.
He asked gently, taking a step towards the other man.
she said, pulling out a packet and handing it to Steve.
Steve interrupted his thoughts.
They both looked over at Bruce, who smiled affectionately.
Another flash of pain and this time Tony saw the Mandarin’s smiling face for a brief moment.
Jane asked in a worry laced voice. She reached up and tucked some of his golden hair behind his ear, searching his eyes for answers. There was so much fear and sadness there, and not the aching far away sadness she was used to with Thor, but a raw sadness; a fresh wound.
Tony met his eyes in the dim light.
stamped over his face in red ink. He was wearing a robe that was somehow billowing around him as if he were in a windstorm, but he was obviously in a closed room. He had a hand raised above his head and rings on every finger, an eerie glow emanating from them. It reminded him all too much of Loki’s scepter and Dr. Strange’s magic. He hated magic.
Tony groaned, looking up at the blond miserably. His breathing was shallow and his eyes glassy.
– Colonel Rhodes
Natasha shrugged.
This particular chapter is my sequel to, and includes the plot of,
He shuddered.
Tony nodded, like that rang true for him as well.
Tony rasped.
he turned to them.
she held out her hand expectantly.
Tony looked pleadingly at Strange.
he asked quietly.
Bruce smiled back at Tony. ‘Sure, let’s go.’
Tony removed his comm and Steve’s, beaming at the blond. THANKS, I TRY. he signed proudly.
That was a sentence Tony never thought he’d hear.
Jane said softly. Her lips were stained with blood but Thor didn't care anymore. He bent over and kissed her gently.
So what better time to try it out than October? It was the most stressful month of his year because he had so much to do. This could ease his life tremendously if he didn’t need to sleep. He was going to actually get everything done by their deadlines this year!
Tony heard her screams in his nightmares far too often, as her father was being threatened at gunpoint. The whole town was full of refugees, some who had lost limbs and family because of
he groaned.
Tony tugged Steve with him, leaving the library.
Tony glared at him, but he still felt too out of breath to say anything.
Tony had landed, broken the serial killer’s arms, and left Steve in charge of watching him. It had taken JARVIS and him a several hours to locate them, and it was hard to tell how long Jessica Jones had been underground. He wasted no time using a repulsor to blast away the dirt all at once. He melted the locks and ripped the metal coffin open only to see the woman close her eyes with a shudder. Her lips were blue and her hands were bloody from beating on the inside of the box. He couldn’t help the swell of panic that washed over him at just the thought of being buried alive. Tony thought the cave had given him claustrophobia, but this…
Steve yelled after them as they took off into his old neighborhood. He reached over to lace his fingers through Tony’s.
Tony was amazed that he was still conscious; actually, he was amazed he was still alive at all. By his calculations, he probably should’ve died about twenty minutes ago, but Dracula must’ve done something with the set up to slow it down. He was barely breathing, and the room had been spinning for a while now. Initially, he had been sweaty and hot, but now he felt like ice. Dracula had grown impatient with his slurred weak speech, so the astrophysics conversation ceased. Tony could hear the vampire say something about the Captain arriving, but Tony couldn’t really remember who he was or what was happening. All he knew was the spinning room and rapid, tiny movements of his chest as he tried to keep breathing. His heartbeat was less a beat and more like a flutter that occasionally took a small break.
Dr. Strange answered first.
Howard was handing him a glass of brown liquid, and Tony tried to give it back. He didn’t want it, it smelled bad and it reminded Tony of how his dad’s breath would smell when things were bad. Howard pushed it into his hand harder and glared at Tony, and he just wanted the man to look happy with him once. He downed the glass, and promptly broke off into a coughing fit while his throat burned and tasted acrid. Tony should’ve walked away.
the Mandarin’s deep voice echoed as he sauntered towards them. He looked at each of them, an arrogant smile plastered across his face until his gaze landed on Dr. Strange, wiping the smug look off in an instant.
As the milk came to a boil, he turned around in Steve’s arms, planting a kiss on Steve’s nose, earning a funny face when Steve wrinkled his nose.
Tony muttered into the silence Wanda had left behind. The rest of his friends could still have fun, even if he had to go fix his mistake.
Tony furrowed his eyebrows. He took a swig from the bottle.
Strange had returned with a team of SHIELD agents, including Coulson. Coulson gave Clint a questioning look, and only when Clint gave him a small nod that he was unhurt did he move with the rest of the team. They quickly apprehended the Mandarin's unconscious body and had a team assessing the captain while Clint, Bruce, Thor, and Natasha stood and watched, waiting to give their reports.
JARVIS really shouldn’t know how to be sarcastic, that just wasn’t fair.
she said softly, turning to look ahead.
He quirked a lopsided smile at his son. Peter was watching him carefully. He was enjoying the show, but he knew his dad well enough to know that Tony was only pretending to be blasé. His dad was going to tell him something important, and Peter would hang on every word like usual.
Tony leaned back, fighting a yawn.
he thundered.
He started to step forward but Tony shrunk away and he stopped.
Janet remarked. Tony just looked at him with wide eyes, feeling like he was falling in love with Steve all over again. This man was far better than he could have ever dreamed.
Roderick Krupp whipped his head around in Jessica’s direction at the sound of the detectives’s voice on her phone. She muted it quickly, silently cursing herself. She darted across the gap between the groundskeeper shed and the nearest mausoleum.  Krupp continued down the pathway, peering around with squinted eyes. The lights weren’t as bright out here on the outskirts of the cemetery, where all the mausoleums stood like sentries. Jessica held her breath, hoping he would give up the search.
Tony startled, looking up to meet Steve’s eyes.
he blurted stupidly.
He shouted after her as she stormed away to her car. She flipped him off without looking back. Once she was a couple blocks away, Jessica pulled over and parked, rubbing her face. She had stopped shedding tears over judgemental pricks years ago, but they were still exhausting. She emailed a copy of her notes and Mr. Marcus’ paper trail to the Detective, so she wouldn’t be bothered later with requests to go to the station. The asshole was gonna feel like an idiot later when Jessica dropped off the kidnapper tied up all neat with a bow.
If it sounded like Tony was desperately questioning God instead of asking JARVIS why Strange was there, well that would be because he wasn’t even sure which he was doing.
Phil and Clint shared a confused look, before Phil spoke up,
He pulled off his t-shirt and it all made a little more sense.
The tech in this ship was far beyond anything Tony had seen, and that included Wakandan technology. If he survived this, which he was starting to doubt as a possibility, he would love to get a look at the inner workings. He leaned his head back, resting the helmet against the wall behind him. Closing his eyes seemed like a bad idea, because it made the room go topsy turvy. So he stared at the bottom of the cabinet that hung above him. He heard Jenny banging around and using tools, but moving his head to look seemed like a lot of effort.
his voice dry. Right, the man didn’t have a weapon. Steve handed him the handgun strapped to his leg. He had the shield anyway, and rarely used guns.
Steve had learned in childhood that hospitals have a way of warping time. Sometimes an hour seemed to pass in minutes, while other times it felt like days. The pattern wasn’t consistent either, not obviously swayed by stress level or anything. The speed of time just seemed to ebb and flow with a mind of its own. He only remembered to eat because he happened to look up at the clock in time to note that the cafeteria would be closing soon.
Bruce took another sip.
They were like that now. The two of them could often communicate a lot without a single word. Tony was begging him not to do the trade. But how could Tony really expect him to risk Tony’s immediate murder? There was always the possibility that Dracula wouldn’t hold up his end of the deal and Tony would die anyway, but Steve thought it unlikely. Dracula was a lot of things, but he had always been a man of his word. Plus, the king tended not to do things that didn’t directly benefit him. What could he possibly gain from killing Tony? Steve wiped a stray tear away. All of this was too much.
At least, Tony tried to say that, but nothing broke the silence. Tony tried again, but his voice was gone completely. His lips moved uselessly. Now that he thought about it, no one had spoken since Wanda’s shout. He looked around in confusion, meeting fearful gazes from his party guests. The only one who seemed unconcerned was Clint. In fact, he looked confusedly at the distressed expressions surrounding him.
Now that he was closer, Natasha could see the details. The medallion matched the shade of gold that draped around Thor’s neck, and a snake was the only decoration.
Clint chuckled, his voice low and gravelly from sleep.
Foggy thought it was a great plan. Sure the Avengers generally stayed out of Hell’s kitchen, letting the local heroes sweat the smaller time villains and organized crime, but he had no doubt they’d help if asked.
Phil stated simply. No one could confidently refute it after that display. They all began to make their way home, ready to collapse from exhaustion. Everyone of them had at least some minor injury at this point, and no one had been sleeping well the past week. They all had nightmares, it was no secret, but they were never all plagued with them at the same time. Sleep deprivation was surely causing some of their mistakes on the field.
He walked forward with his hands up to show there was no attack planned.
He was already raiding the refrigerator, pulling out an egg carton, bacon, and orange juice.
it wasn’t a question. Tony nodded, expression twisted in a self-deprecating smile.
Tony groaned. They couldn’t strip now! There were dinner reservations. He tried to think of something gross to get rid of his hardening boner. He cleared his throat,
he whined.
and that got a giggle from Peter. Peter’s giggle always made Wade’s stomach feel weird. He didn’t really know why but it wasn’t completely unpleasant.
Tony focused on breathing, waiting for the world to stop spinning.
Steve opened the door where Tony was still knocking. He smiled down at his handsome boyfriend, stealing a kiss. The aroma of his aftershave burned Steve’s nostrils a little. He loved it all the same. No matter how hard Tony tried, he’d always have the slight smell of metal and oil clinging to him that Steve loved.
Phil asked carefully. Not pushing, but also not letting anything slide. Why have therapy when you can have Phil?
Phil’s smile was a small quirk at the corners of his mouth. Anything more was typically reserved for Clint.
Tony rolled his eyes and took a sip of his water bottle. The night was a bit chilly, so he had the convertible Audi R8’s roof up to avoid the chill. The air flowed openly through the vents though. If Tony liked one thing about October, it was that the smells of autumn hung in the air before being swept away in November’s cold.
Tony was pushing away from a work table to face the blond as he entered the lab. The table had a large silver case on it with a keypad lock. Steve idly wondered what Tony felt needed locked up in the safety of his own lab, that already had ample security, but Tony’s predatory smile was distracting. He stood, gesturing for Steve to come to him. Steve’s feet moved of their own accord while he focused on the beautiful man in front of him.
Thor said, walking towards the door.
This year, it was time for Tony’s revenge. He was going to make Clint have nightmares with his prank. Everyone but Thor was on his side this time, or at least they claimed to be. It was common for one of the other Avengers to double-cross the pranksters in the October games. To make sure he wasn’t screwed over by a last minute double cross, Tony had told them all one plan, but had a different plan going on his own as backup. He’d be lying if he said he put any faith at all in the plan that included the others. Trusting Natasha or Phil to work against Clint would be stupid of him, although Phil always claimed to be staying out of it.
he spread his arms open wide, bending to one knee.
she asked him. He shook his head.
Phil stood as well, putting his hands up in a placating gesture. His flat, calm demeanor was good for calming situations like this.
he finally found the courage to ask.
With that, she whipped around and stalked back through the double doors.
The question caught him off guard,
Natasha nodded, not willing to say it out loud. Bruce took off his glasses and began wiping them so he wouldn't have to make eye contact.
Tony looked up at him, scared himself.
Phil gathered his things and left to go talk with Dr. Stein. He knew any minute now he’d get the call from Fury, telling him that of course Phil should already be explaining the terms of SHIELD employment to the poor healthcare workers that were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Although Phil was pretty sure Fury would say right place at the right time. His phone buzzed in his pocket as he left the building. Yep, there it was. He answered it with a curt,
With the suit off, he couldn’t see what happened, but he heard one last yell from Strange, and his arm get tugged forward until he was laying face first on the ground, still trapped in the frozen suit. He hoped it was the ground of the tower, and not the castle.
Clint gaped in a mixture of awe and horror as Tony reached up his shirt and pulled out the arc reactor. Tony’s face only showed a small twitch that indicated Tony feeling a thing. Tony took the wire that connected the reactor to the electromagnet, and touched it to the uncovered metal of his phone’s lithium ion battery. The resulting sparks were numerous, and hotter than what someone can get with banging rocks together or twirling sticks by hand. Despite the dampness, the kindling burst into flame, and the fire continued to burn steadily after that. Tony yanked his hands back, only catching a few sparks on his skin.
Dracula, for his part, did look like he found the whole ordeal semi-regrettable, but Tony could see the glee already taking over the vampires features.
That brought out a real smile.
Steve asked, Peter was rarely nervous to ask them for things by now. He had been living in the tower for two years now, Aunt May having supported the adoption wholeheartedly. She still got to remain in Peter’s life, and he got to live with parents a little more… suited to his needs. May was great, but not a superhero. Plus she had never wanted him to see her as his mom anyway. Just a cool aunt.
Clint admitted. It was probably the one thing that had always impressed him the most about Tony.
he asked, standing on shaky legs.
Clint shuddered. Poor Steve, he was not going to be happy that this had happened again when he woke up. He looked at Natasha, and she was staring at him. They both knew that everyone had gotten hit with their fears, but the question was how. There's no way Tony would sell them out, especially Steve.
Steve ran full tilt into the kitchen, sliding slightly on his knees as he dropped to the ground to grasp Tony.
she started,
Loki’s frown deepened. Steve looked like he was about to retort, but Loki caught him with a glare first, giving a subtle shake of his head.
Fury asked the table at large.
Natasha explained.
he said quietly, but it still sounded loud when it broke the silence.
Which leads into October. At midnight last night, Tony replaced all toothpaste in the tower with a different brand. Clint would naturally be suspicious, and instead of risking it, he’d go to his emergency disappearance bag that he thought Tony didn’t know about. It was honestly silly that anyone in the tower thought they could own something and Tony wouldn’t know about it. His personal AI ran the tower! Natasha had her own bag as well. They were well stocked with everything one might need if they suddenly needed to go off the grid. It was a good idea to have, and finding Clint’s had made him consider packing his own. He decided against it, deciding that he would be useless without being able to use any traceable tech, so going off grid would never be an option for him. Plus, he was much harder to disguise than Clint or Natasha. His face had been in the news his whole life.
Dracula narrowed his eyes, waiting for the punchline.
Tony pushed the lava cake around his plate, watching it slide in a fudge trail. Steve knew he hadn’t really touched his meal either. Finishing his own slice of pie, he leaned forward to catch Tony’s attention.
He did not cry now, he just swallowed the pain and emotions, quashing them down for later. Instead he allowed himself to take comfort in Steve’s arms, nuzzling into those rock hard pecs. He was too embarrassed already to put up a fight when Steve brought up the wheelchair.
he said, pulling away.
Clint startled everyone by slamming his hands on the table.
Clint said as he walked up behind Natasha.
Clint insisted.
The point of the matter was that it was impossible to narrow down. It was like an old wives’ tale. When people break a mirror, they have seven years of bad luck. It does happen in real life. Now does it happen to everyone who breaks a mirror? No. But it does happen. Plenty would say that the bad luck and the broken mirror were a coincidence; that the correlation was imaginary. Psychology would say that confirmation bias leads a person to decide that their perfectly normal amount of bad luck has increased or that they notice bad luck more because they’re looking for it. The chaos of the universe seems more neat and logical if they have something to blame for their troubles in a bad time in their life. So were the Avengers under some curse or were they in the midst of a mental breakdown?
Phil and Steve let out the same long-suffering sigh. Tony had to say, getting hurt with someone else was more fun than alone. Wait, no, that sounded terrible in his head. It’s not that he likes someone else getting hurt, but it was less lonely. Whatever. His brain was not functioning properly. Actually, why had no one brought him coffee yet?
Phil shook his head, smiling and actually blushing. Tony didn’t know the agent could blush.
Steve took in a shaky breath,
Tony decided. Nothing like a kidnapping to inspire your love life, right?
Loki bowed,
I love Tony and Clint together. I think their banter is hilarious, and my running headcanon that they are hyper-competitive and prank each other keeps me going sometimes. So, I decided they needed some alone time. Also 'Tony Talks' are now a part of my avengers family. Take that as you will.
It felt a little like a confession of feelings deeper than friendship, but Steve hoped Tony didn’t focus on that. Steve was still trying to make sense of the tangle of feelings he got when he looked at the genius. He wasn’t ready to discuss them quite yet. Tony had stopped crying and was staring wide-eyed at Steve.
Tony hummed too.
Tony tensed as he felt Steve’s arms suddenly around him. He forced himself to relax into the embrace, because he didn’t want Steve to stop, he was just on edge.
he reached down and tickled Tony, startling him. Tony squawked, nearly falling off the seat, but Steve caught him, chuckling. Bastard.
Clint encouraged. Tony scowled like he didn’t believe it.
Osborn rewarded him with a slow grin, all teeth.
I've given up entirely on this being timely, but I am trying to finish it up, because I have other much bigger projects to work on. This was a hard prompt for me, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . I promise to finish eventually for those of you that are still reading! Kudos and comments give me life and motivation.
Tony’s face showed a range of emotions in quick succession.
Tony snapped.
The slow grin was wicked, and Morgana’s eyes were already glowing purple with hungry power.
Tony knew full well that he was rambling, but he wanted to talk about anything other than last night. He was sure everyone was already calling it his ‘relapse,’ and they were going to make a much bigger deal out of it than necessary. What had they expected, really? That Tony would stay sober forever? If they thought that was likely then they didn’t really know him. At any sign of trouble, Tony will always turn to the bottle and disappoint everyone else, it’s who he is and he had accepted it, why couldn’t they?
he whined.
Steve held up a hand to stop him. He pulled the work bench over and sat down.
he showed the medic who wasn’t currently taking Tony’s pulse.
Bruce was scrawling things down silently for a few moments. Bruce stood and grabbed a few water bottles from the fridge before turning to look at Steve seriously.
Tony replied, trying to be light. He was already trying to think of solutions in his head, maybe he could alter the reactor to also be the pacemaker. Though then he’d depend on the damn thing even more.
Clint started, voice careful and eyes watching for minute facial expressions in Steve before he could mask them.
Clint didn’t know what to think of this reaction. Steve sounded so emotionless, but he could see something simmering underneath. It wasn’t anger, at least not at Tony, and there was worry mixed in there. But the fact that he wasn’t the open book he normally was terrified Clint. Steve was hiding something from them. Clint filed that information away for later.
she muttered.
Not the reaction he had been expecting, Tony studied Clint’s horrified expression.
Steve shook his head.
His voice was quiet but echoed through the silent gym. He dropped to his knees, a sob ripping through him.
That… was a believable story. He wanted to think that people wouldn’t believe it, that his friends wouldn’t think so low of him, but he wasn’t delusional. Everyone knew he was unreliable. No matter how long it had been since Tony had pulled a stunt like that, there was always the air of anticipation for when the billionaire playboy would fail them all again. He was suddenly exhausted, resigned to the situation.
Clint asked, herding them into the portal. Strange nodded, and he closed his eyes. The portal began shrinking.
Tony wakes up, Steve beats himself up some more, and everyone's going to be ok... right?
Steve gave the packet over to Tony’s grabby hands.
Tony looked so lost for a moment, eyes glassy, but he blinked and he was fine. Clint could almost believe he had imagined it if Tony didn’t take a long drag from the flask he brought.
Dr. Nicholson stepped back, writing more notes. She turned to face Clint’s bed, where Phil was standing behind it and Steve was sitting in front of it. She pointed at Steve,
Tony’s breathing stuttered when Dracula pulled the arc reactor out of the socket. The panic that came with anyone touching the thing that kept him alive was far more powerful than the hypnotism. Dracula met his panicked gaze sharply, and Tony felt some of the panic subside. It seemed a strangely courteous thing to do; it’s not as though Tony could fight back. Maybe Dracula wasn’t completely evil. Villains came in varying levels of cruelty. It felt like an electric shock ran through him when the pin was stuck in. It was hard to explain how he knew, but Tony knew that the nanobots were all deactivated. He felt somehow dulled, like he had been constantly thrumming like a machine, and now he had been powered down. He hadn’t noticed that he could feel the nanotech until the feeling was gone.
he joked.
He searched Tony’s eyes for a hint of why this bothered him so much. All he saw was raw fear. He sighed.
As Clint sat next to Abram in the car, his hands tied behind his back, Natasha had already informed Fury of the situation and agents were en route to pick up the family. Natasha texted JARVIS, telling him that Raza was responsible for the poisoning. He agreed to immediately start searching the web and databases for any signs of the Ten Rings nearby.
Bravado always kept away the fear. He couldn’t give in to it yet, it was so early on in the kidnapping.
panic clawed at his throat, and some of the fear leaked into his tone.
Steve directed the last comment towards Peter.
Norman showed no reaction to Tony’s screams or whimpers, just continued to ask questions. Tony merely glared at the other man, clenching his jaw to keep from whimpering again.
She shrugged. The others sat in various positions around the room.
Clint scoffed over Tony’s loud ‘ha!’
By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone’s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.
he whispered as Tony cackled maniacally.
Tony had no idea what this guy was talking about. Was he a telepath like Xavier? Or maybe one of his rings could read minds for him. Maybe he was bluffing. Tony could hardly think straight. Suddenly Tony’s head felt like it was going to split open and then he was in his bed at home screaming.
Steve smiled and let out a sigh of relief. He got back up to the chair.
He had trouble believing that. They'd met a lot of telepaths over the years but it was hard to be like Charles Xavier.
Steve broke his stony silence.
When the symptoms had started, and he knew something was wrong, he took the opportunity as usual. Maybe, just maybe, if he didn’t make it this time, he’d escape from himself. His death to save others would be worth so much more than his life had ever been. He would never commit suicide right out; then he’d never atone for his sins. But if he accidentally died in the process of atonement? Well at least he would have tried, then.
She looked like she might laugh at the title, but held it in.
he singsonged. It was so at odds with the mood of the room, that it broke the tension. Steve could feel them all shift, changing focus and allowing the stifling emotions to dissipate.
Tony said easily.
Natasha asked. She took command quite well for someone that usually followed Cap’s orders, Tony thought. Though she used to work alone a lot, so she doesn’t need orders, he reminded himself. She probably only follows Cap out of respect.
He didn’t seem to hear any of it though.
It had to be Steve’s imagination, but Thor seemed to sneer at him. Thor didn’t sneer.
Steve entered the throne room at a sprint. His eyes found Tony immediately, and he almost forgot the plan. The brunette was sheet-white, with blue lips. He didn’t even look like he was breathing. The two bags were full of so much blood and how could Tony still be alive he had failed him he should’ve just come alone sooner and maybe Dracula would just kill him quickly so he didn’t have to live with this guilt and-
Peter looked filled with awe at the statement. He was so lucky to have so many cool aunts and uncles. Who else at school could say they had a god as an uncle?
the detective said sarcastically. Honestly, she didn’t deserve the attitude she got from the city’s officials, really. It was never her fault the police couldn’t do their jobs, nor was the increase in powered crime that she ended up tangled in her fault. She just seem to draw trouble.
he eventually broke the yawning silence between them.
A lot of little things began to click into place for Clint.
I know this is late, but I finished it at like 2AM promptly passed out. Original sin was such a tricky prompt to me, because it didn't really seem to fit the Halloween theme at all. And trust me, I already know that what I wrote about is not actually original sin, I went to Catholic school. But I figure Tony probably doesn't know his church teachings anyways.
he smirked up at Steve.
she said when she was done searching his face to see that he was alright. She kissed him on the forehead and walked away. Every time Steve thought he had her figured out, she did something he never expected, like that. He numbly followed her to the jet and buckled in.
The shock was starting to wear off as another leapt for Steve. He knew how to handle these.
Tony tossed and turned, unable to sleep despite his body’s exhaustion.
Tony bit out sarcastically.
Steve turned to look at Tony.
Loki causing magical chaos in New York was a pretty typical occurrence nowadays. Thor said it’s because he gets bored in Asgard and thinks humans are entertaining. The Avengers were used to it by now. Usually Loki would show up, scare some people, give the Avengers a run for their money, then leave with a happy goodbye before he could be captured. He rarely even caused injuries anymore, so Steve thought of it as harmless fun that helped the team train.
Peter stared at Wade for a moment in silence. He wished he could control his blush whenever Wade complimented him, it was so embarrassing.
Tony turned back to find Strange raising an eyebrow at him with a slight smirk. If the man wasn’t so irksome when he was smug, Tony would be relieved to see a little of his usual personality shine through this exhaustion and panic he seemed to be in tonight.
he suggested suddenly. It wasn’t trick-or-treating, but at least Tony would get to dress up. Peter would love it too, and he could just guess at how thrilled Thor would be to participate in another Midgardian holiday.
Steve didn’t look happy, but he didn’t start yelling either. Tony kind of wished he would, so they could just get it over with. Instead, the supersoldier just stood and walked away.
this is his fault.
he whispered.
Steve blushed. Tony could be shameless.
Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn’t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn’t joking.
Steve frowned at Tony, but Germaine gave a knowing chuckle.
When he looked at Strange, he had an odd look on his face.
Tony slid slightly down the wall into metal shackles that were waiting in the air for him, leaning heavily against the wall as his feet hit the ground and the shackles clicked shut with a cold finality. His wrists and ankles were chained to the walls with thick chains; it was probably a bit overkill considering he couldn’t do much without the suit anyways.
Before the discussion could go any further though, Thor burst into the room with a thunderous,
Tony’s voice was husky with arousal. Steve allowed him to hold him down on the bed, just watching the smaller man kiss a line down his front before gasping in surprise when Tony nipped the inside of his thigh.
Tony waited a solid ten seconds to see if Steve had more. When he didn't continue, it was time to set this nonsense to rest.
Clint grumbled, eyes searching for some street parking available.
Tony nodded, grinding his teeth.
She sighed.
Tony went to sit up, hissing when he moved his left arm. Clint let him use his shoulder to grip with the uninjured arm and helped the man sit up.
He was trying to keep his cool, but this was stupid.
he drawled.
The envelope held a ticket. Frank had a VIP ticket to the opera, a balcony to himself to watch the next show. It wasn’t poetry or a love letter, but it was something. This was Maria inviting him to actually enjoy her performance, enjoy the opera instead of working behind the scenes. He was going to have a better seat than many far above him in social status. He had to buy something nice to wear. The moment of warm happiness was quickly replaced with anxious irritation at the thought. At least he had been saving up money for a while.
Steve stood awkwardly in front of Tony, and everything they had shared before was gone. Tony didn’t trust him, and he didn’t trust Tony. It was the greatest surprise in the world that Steve had never actually died, but the suffering had been real nonetheless. And now that he was here, Tony had no idea where to start. He had failed with SHIELD, had barely survived the Skrulls, and his health was failing, his brain slowing. Steve shifted on his feet, sadness so clear in his eyes that Tony felt like it stabbed him in the heart. He needed to explain everything, that he regretted all of it, but his brain just wouldn’t seem to work fast enough.
Steve huffed.
The reactor was finished, drained of power. The pins and needles sensation in his chest was harsh, and he gasped with the sharp pain of the shrapnel moving. He was vaguely aware of the stranger’s hand still there on his chest. His heart was stuttering and he felt out of breath, and the effect was happening quicker than usual with a reactor failure. Tony could only assume he was still somehow stealing life energy. The sound of shouting somewhere behind him felt unreal, and Tony couldn’t make out the voice or words, anyway, with how loud his own struggling heart was in his ears. The blur of colour, probably Cap’t shield knocked the Stranger’s arm off of Tony. It was a little late though, and Tony felt a very distant acceptance that this might be it. He could barely suck in a breath for all the effort it took.
Clint and Natasha watched from a dark alley, waiting for the few late evening customers to leave before they made their move. Natasha was in a nice black gown, one side cut so that her leg showed through when she walked. Her gun strapped to her other thigh and a blade hidden in her hair, though she hoped it wouldn’t come to that. Clint wore a nice suit with the compact, foldable bow and arrows that Tony had invented tucked in the back of his slacks.
It sounded too forcefully casual even to his own ears. Clint cursed his inability to lie well to Phil. Anyone else and they'd never tell if he was lying... Except maybe Natasha.
he gasped, seeing Bruce’s face swimming in his vision. Tony could tell he was fading fast, and he wondered how much blood he’d lost while he’d been distracted by the damaged reactor. The sudden pressure on his wound, brought him sharply back to consciousness.
The first several hours were perfect. The dashed lines passing him by and the focus he could put into just the feeling of driving was therapeutic. The slight buzzing of the engine underneath his fingertips reminded him of his teens, the good parts, when he could get away with long trips to nowhere to escape everything. There was no time for brooding or panic attacks when autopilot wasn’t an option, like in the suit, and driving helped keep Tony from drinking. He sighed, life was going pretty alright.
Tony spluttered a little, coughing before drinking some more to calm down. Clint hadn’t even noticed that he was drinking from a flask, and not his water bottle. He frowned.
She nodded.
in the first season. It can be construed as canon-compliant to that universe, but where it would fit in the timeline is probably murky. Definitely before Tony gets stuck in another dimension, but pretend he developed the Bleeding-Edge armor before.
Clint could understand the reaction. This random stranger was talking about mind magnets and knew their names. Plus she may have just found out that her roommate was actually an intergalactic hero.
he turned back and winked, just for the pure pleasure of seeing Steve’s blush travel down his neck. Tony knew from personal experience that that blush could, in fact, travel down quite far on Steve’s magnificent body. Steve glared, knowing full well that Tony enjoyed embarrassing Steve at all possible moments.
he would be bouncing with excitement if it didn’t make his ribs pang.
Steve shivered. He was so cold. There was a source of warmth to his right so he turned towards it. It was so warm, he just wanted it to envelop him and get rid of this wretched iciness. At first he thought maybe it was a fire because of how hot it was, but he didn’t hear any crackling. If it was Tony then he had a worrisomely high fever. That was when Steve’s sluggish thoughts started catching up. Shit, Tony… Tony was kidnapped by the Mandarin… They had gone to save him and…
His husband and son were both crying now, and Thor sniffed loudly.
Tony looked furious.
he laughed through the question.
Quickly unmuting the phone, hoping the man was still there, she whispered into the mic before hanging up immediately.
The Avengers all deal with trauma in different ways.
he whispered.
Natasha sing-songed.
So much for getting along.
The armour removed any inflection from the words, but Steve was sure they were irritated.
he shuddered in Steve’s arms.
Something is living in the basement. The problem was, Tony couldn’t figure out what.
Clint watched Tony take a long drag of his liquor while he settled himself back on the ground. Tony motioned with his hand for Clint to continue from before, placing the hoodie on his lap like a blanket.
Steve said loudly, not sure where the microphone was on the tablet.
Tony’s voice was already rumbling with desire.
and Natasha’s face conveyed perfect calm and no malice, but her voice was dangerous.
By Odin, this was why he loved this woman, with such a pure heart. How could she expect him to leave her?
he murmured, chuckling to himself.
He let out his own self-deprecating chuckle.
Tony turned to see Steve enter the room, swaying enough that Steve thought he’d fall off. Tony scowled when he saw who it was.
Both men gave a half-hearted laugh.
he comforted. Peter was such a scaredy-cat. He should have expected a reaction like this. It was a real testament to how scared the younger kid was that he hadn’t thought of the obvious on his own. He grabbed Peter’s shoulders and pushed him out of the hug, forcing them to be face to face.
Tony winced.
and the movie
He had Thor/not-Thor in a full nelson, but he was too strong to be immobilized. Natasha hit him in the head with a weight to no effect.
The ride to the hospital was excruciating. He fidgeted, knowing that they couldn’t move any faster. Natasha handed him a tissue and Steve stared at it, confused. She sighed and gently used it to wipe away the tears he didn’t know were there. He gripped Bruce’s hand, probably too hard, but Bruce didn’t mention it.
Abram said petulantly, only to hiss when Natasha dug her nails into his shoulder.
Wade pulled him into a hug. Peter was trembling and hiccupping.
Tony chuckled, probably thinking along the same lines.
Clint just laughed silently, signing I NOT EASY OFFEND.
Steve slammed the door shut and let out a sigh. If MODOK didn’t have such an ego and superiority complex, he probably would have been much harder to defeat. Tony had explained to him before how MODOK always seemed to know what they would do before they did it. His ability to calculate probabilities so well was truly astonishing. The only way they had defeated them last time was when Tony had decided to act impulsively and irrationally in order to be unpredictable. That had been way too risky and Tony had broken several bones. After the riot act Steve had read him that time, Tony agreed to ask Steve for a plan before taking desperate measures from then on.
he told his anxiety, now was hardly a good time for a panic attack. There was a civilian in need right in front of him.
Steve’s eyes were boring into him and he squirmed uncomfortably. Something told him there wasn’t going to be an easy way out of this conversation.
Phil offered. He couldn’t remember who’s turn it was, but they both knew each other's’ hospital coffee preferences by now.
Steve called out, jogging after the man until he caught up with the waiter. Tony watched him go in confusion, but stayed where he was, not wanting to seem rude while he was still trapped in conversation with one of the major shareholders in his company.
Tony, ever the saint, threw Steve a shaky smile. The pain of the chemical torture was more bearable now, merely a shadow of the agony he was in when Steve had found him. He reached out for Steve’s hand, squeezing hard when Steve held it.
Steve asked as he marched into the Avenger’s jet, pulling his cowl over his face.
This is pure crack. I like Clint being smarter than he lets everyone think but he only lets it show when there's a competition at stake. Tony gets slightly angsty for a hot second in the middle, because Howard is an ass, but really he's just sleep deprived and worried he doesn't really know his friends. He'll be fine.
The incessant anxiety nagged Tony in the back of his mind. It was the voice that always made sure he knew that he wasn’t doing enough. That he should be doing more. He resolutely ignored it as he gave Steve his best attempt at a smile.
Tony exclaimed.
Strange’s expression told him all he needed. They would never even see this asshole’s face. There wasn’t even reason to believe the man when he said he had no powers. Tony would be doing some of his own investigating after he survived this. That was one of Tony’s last comprehensible thoughts before all that was left was all-consuming pain and the struggle to breathe. It felt like a giant stepped on him, crushing a lot of him, all but his head, neck, spine and sternum. Everything hurt and he no longer controlled his body’s squirming and ragged gasps.
Steve was cursing. The world was upside down if Steve Rogers was using foul language.
was all Tony said before switching his comm off.
She and Steve shared a look of understanding and ran to their friends while Hulk started smashing everything, which sufficiently distracted the small amount of men left. Natasha had made it to Clint and Steve was a few feet away from Tony when the Mandarin appeared in a swirl of cape and smoke, slowing Steve for only a second. Unfortunately the Mandarin was gone with Tony again before Steve’s shield had reached him, and it bounced from the wall back to Steve’s hand as Steve stood where Tony had been a mere second before. Steve wanted to scream in frustration or cry or something, but he had another teammate who needed him right behind him, so he pushed the pain of helplessness away for the time being, bringing on the numbness and drive of a soldier.
act that scared the newbies and earned him respect.
Tony’s outburst surprised him into speechlessness. He opened his mouth, closed it.
She nodded in agreement, but still said nothing, unwilling to meet Tony’s gaze as he got closer.
Steve was rooted to the spot. There was no mistaking that voice. Vlad Dracula was using his friend as a puppet.
He held up his Stark phone proudly with a grin. It was not a commercially available model; Tony had designed it just for Peter. It had JARVIS on it, just like all of his own devices.
Thor asked worriedly.
He shuddered visibly.
Steve saw movement on the far side of the room, and when he honed, he watched in horror as Tony’s body slammed against the wall. He stayed pinned up there, far beyond anyone’s reach, and his breathing looked ragged.
They startled apart, Phil quickly looking unflappable as usual, but Clint clearly annoyed.
Before he knew it he was flat on his back in a small Iron Man-shaped crater in the asphalt. His HUD display was fizzling in and out. He let out a low groan.
Phil’s voice was soothing and perfectly calm. Only Clint could hear the worry underlying Phil’s tone. Steve tried to follow the directions, managing to hold the air for 3 seconds and not completely blow it all out at once.
he fluttered a hand as though swatting away an annoying fly.
Clint asked smugly.
They shared a knowing look, before Frank plastered on a smile for the kids.
Tony took a deep breath.
She started moving around, turning things on and pressing buttons as she spoke.
Thor let out a boisterous guffaw.
Tony shook him,
Rhodey laughed, leaning back in the armchair to Tony’s left.
he explained when Wade stared at him in confusion.
The sudden, overwhelming desire to laugh took hold of Clint for a moment, but he thankfully stifled it. There’s no way Tony would take that well.
the archer gestured wildly at the screen, spilling some of his drink.
He looked at the clock, 9:00AM. By the way he felt he probably got an hour and a half of sleep at the most. That was plenty for him, though, since his nightmares were torturous last night.
going easy. The serum meant that Steve could hold up against Thor better than the others, minus Hulk, but Thor was fighting with more ferocity than usual. Steve narrowly dodged another blow, thankful they were fighting bare-handed. Even with the shield, Steve was sure Thor could hurt him with Mjolnir if he wasn’t careful. He managed a kick to Thor’s side before rolling away again. His best strategy with the god was always to stay out of reach.
They jumped out of bed without a second thought, Steve pulling his suit out of the closet and Tony pulling on clothes and running for the door. He turned before leaving the room. They both said
Clint shuddered.
Phil scrubbed a hand over his face.
Steve furrowed his brow.
he breathed, not sure himself if it was genuine or a joke. Maybe it was a little of both. He let his eyes close and went back into the warmth of sleep.
Tony booped him on the nose, laughing at the blank look it got him.
The room sat in awkward silence.
Steve sat down, groaning in frustration. Tony made small whimpering noises and settled down, just squirming uncomfortably.
The admission startled a laugh out of Tony as well. He helped the younger woman sit up shakily.
This is pure Tony angst, with some pre-slash with Steve, and the beginnings of comfort.
Strange remarked lightly as he stepped away from the bed.
He was loathe to admit it, but Steve thought Thor was probably right.
Peter finished big, raising his fists in a victorious stance. Tony stood in shock behind him while the rest of his family erupted into applause.
The doctor stopped in front of the closed doors.
Tony was standing now and Clint didn’t remember rising to his own feet. They were inches from each other. Someone could cut through the tension with a knife.
It started out as an alliance. Vlad Dracula had fought alongside Captain America as tentative allies when HYDRA took over Transylvania. The nazi organization took over
He moved to scoop her up but she moved away, shaking her head.
Steve leaned forward when Tony met his eyes.
he told himself miserably. He could hear Howard in his head reminding him how much he sucked.
Clint and Nat go undercover, and we actually find out what's going on. Who's after the Avengers this time?
He turned to look at his fiancé excitedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was too late though; Bruce saw the minute stiffening of Tony’s shoulders and hesitated. Was Tony afraid of him? Or just on edge because of everything that’s been happening? He was an abused child, so jumping to the assumption of physical abuse is to be expected from him, especially when not at his full cognitive functioning, but Bruce also had to wonder if it was Tony’s past fears of Howard being projected or a current fear of the Other Guy. He continued onward and laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder anyway. When Tony relaxed a little at the touch, it assuaged his worry a little.
Peter blushed but didn’t look away.
One week she just handed him an envelope at the end of the night with no explanation. Before he could ask, she was already off socializing with the other singers and high society. He stared at the envelope as he walked home that night. It felt a little like as long as he didn’t know what was inside, he could imagine all sorts of wonderful things that were probably unrealistic. Maybe it was a love letter asking him to run away with her. Maybe she was secretly involved in a dangerous conspiracy and needed his help. They were not plausible contents of the envelope, but they were possible as long as he didn’t open it. He could only imagine for so long, though, before he began to feel like an idiot. He ripped open the envelope, cursing himself silently for already being so in love with this woman.
He ducked the pillow thrown at him before continuing. His face grew more serious as he decided what he should talk about that wouldn’t be too dark for an eight year old. Not that they ever shielded Peter from much, but the kid could stand to mature a little before hearing some of their tragic backstories.
Tony mumbled. He could hear the slur slipping into his voice.
Natasha wished there was time to comfort her traumatized friend,
Peter had had enough. He sat up while Tony ranted, watching his face carefully. This was how Tony got when he wanted to hide his pain or anxiety. Everything quickly became an affront to his being, and it usually quickly spiraled into self-deprecation until someone stopped him.
Steve sighed. It was a fair question, especially if it was true that they had been calling for him for five minutes and he had been completely oblivious. But he also didn’t think he could stand to stay back while the rest of his team was in danger, nor could he not be there to try to save Tony.
the choppy sentence was useless before the display and speaker gave up completely. He lifted the faceplate so he could still see, and sat up. Everything ached, but nothing seemed to be broken yet. Hulk had moved a few feet away from Tony, looking like he was considering re-entering the lab.
for October spookiness, they had started talking about childhood memories. The group of kids hanging out together and exploring in the movie had generated the perfect casual nostalgia they rarely got, where the happy memories lie without the painful ones.
his voice cracked.
The next time Tony woke up, it was slow and warm. He liked it better than being shaken awake in agony. When he peeled his eyelids open, he saw two faces right above him. It startled him into full wakefulness,
I know Peter and Wade were not childhood friends, but in this universe they are. I don't care, it's too cute not to let it be. I love kid fics with the two of them. Warnings for vague mentions of possible abuse, but nothing more graphic than that. Let me know what you think!
She went about her work, carefully placing Tony back in the supine position with practiced hands. Thor watched curiously over her shoulder, and when she finished, they met face to face. To her credit, she didn’t startle.
Steve walked over and sat down beside Tony.
And Clint could leave it at that. But this was so uncharacteristic of Tony. He was usually all bravado and deflection, this seemed unsure. The man who practically lead the Avengers as much as Cap made it clear when you weren’t allowed to broach a subject. This was only a half-hearted deflection; Clint took the leap that he wanted it pushed.
Tony crossed his arms, fighting off a smile.
That was, of course, until the black-eyed child showed up.
The assassin took Clint’s place in front of her family. She looked nervous for a moment, something none of them had ever seen on her.
he said in his commander voice as they pulled up to the drive through.
When Peter seemed satisfied with his understanding of the telescope, he came back to the blanket.
JARVIS and the Avengers were not in agreement with his strategy, apparently.
Tony caught his breath again before he met Steve’s gaze again.
I totally believe Jessica would be a little star-struck to meet the big name heroes the first time. You may not believe me, but just remember that Jessica and Luke very rarely get into any of the big business with the cape-crew. They just like their happy marriage and adorable baby in Hell's Kitchen.
To battle, the Avengers go! With a special guest. Their plan is solid, but does anything ever go according to plan?
Tony breathed. He didn’t want to open his eyes now, he’d have to face Steve’s wrath.
Phil let out a small puff of air. He said nothing while they switched jobs, Clint shampooing his hair and Phil rubbing small circles into Clint’s back while he washed. It wasn’t until they stepped out of the shower and toweled off that he broke the silence.
Norman wouldn’t let him escape that easily. He knew Tony could handle plenty more abuse before he had to worry about the man dying on him. He’d get his information.
No one had anything to say after that. They all knew it was true. For some reason this genius was willfully ignorant enough to always think self-sacrifice was the only way. Steve was starting to think Tony wanted to die, at least subconsciously. He obviously didn’t like his life enough to protect it. Steve should have been a better boyfriend for Tony, maybe then he would want to keep living. Just more ways Steve had failed to protect another loved one.
A harsh burst of air punched out of Tony at the same time that Peter let out a soft
the sorcerer began. That got Tony’s attention. He looked up at Dr. Strange, raising his eyebrows in a show of surprise.
Steve smiled up at him a little apologetically but Tony just finished ripping off his shirt, crushing their lips together all the while. He groaned as Steve slipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth, and ripped Steve’s shirt open, a couple buttons coming off in the rush. Steve sighed and pushed Tony back, giving him that disappointed mother look he somehow pulled off while still looking like a national hero.
Steve smiled at the tiny screen. Barton had to make jokes out of everything, and Steve wouldn’t have it any other way. They all loved Tony so much, if only Tony could see it when it wasn’t being shoved down his throat. Steve wished he could get a better understanding of what happened during the battle yesterday before Tony woke up. He wanted to know Tony’s actions without any omissions, something he’d be hard pressed to get from Tony. He mentally walked through yesterday again.
she asked quietly.
Yes, I used that old character Mr. Doll that died back in the 70s. Because I'm that person, so deal with it.
Steve didn’t meet Tony’s eyes as he joined Tony sitting on the edge of the bed. When Tony wrapped his arms around the bigger man, the crying softened to some occasional sniffles.
Dracula with Hulk’s power was a worst nightmare. When the man dropped Steve and began screaming in pain, Tony nearly fainted with relief. He was a very understanding man, but dating a vampire Steve might’ve been too much, even for him. Though maybe he could get into blood play… He shook away the thought.
Steve looked around the room, letting himself wake up fully, but there wasn’t much to see so his eyes wandered back to Tony. He really was lucky Dr. Stein was so accommodating. Steve had forgotten about hospital rules of immediate family only; Tony didn’t even have any. As soon as Dr. Stein had said it, the idea had been growing in his mind: why wasn’t he Tony’s husband? It’s not as if he was afraid of the commitment. He definitely loved Tony, and had already decided to stay with him until one of them died. So what were they waiting on?
Clint admitted.
It seemed like ages had passed when the burning stopped spreading up his legs. Tony focused on the pain, because that at least meant his nerves were intact. He stared at the Mandarin’s hands, waiting for the next attack patiently. What the Mandarin didn’t realize was that although this would haunt Tony’s nightmares for years to come and give him unwanted flashbacks, in this moment Tony could handle any of it. He could turn off parts of his mind so that it wasn’t all so overwhelming. That was how Tony never gave in to torture.
Steve asked, his voice wavering.
Natasha asked Bruce.
he rasped, eyes wide with confusion.
he sounded so confused, and that stopped her short.
he rasped, but that short sentence sent him coughing again, spitting up a little more blood.
When Steve looked ready to protest, she stopped him,
– Ms. Potts
Tony eyed him from the suit, hovering above one of the hissing ninjas. At least that’s what they seemed to be to him. What in the world was Steve on about in the middle of an attack?
Steve thought, and on that note, Steve fell into an uneasy sleep.
He sat down next to him, getting a good whiff of the alcohol breath.
Tony made a sound similar to a laugh that became a small yelp.
His eyes sparked with curiosity; he was always fascinated by
Steve could hear how out of it he sounded to himself, it was probably worse to everyone else.
Steve tried the same, and when Tony mouthed another phrase, instead of Steve needing to read his lips, the words appeared before his eye. The screen was only holographic, and he could still see the outside world beyond the glowing blue words.
Bruce sat beside her and looked exhausted, so Clint had nothing to do but follow suit. He looked up at the capsicle uncomfortably.
Wanda provided. This sucked.
Tony felt like each word took an eternity to form. He felt like he weighed a ton, and now he was lying prone. He could feel the arc reactor slowing its cycles, and the panic gave him the burst of energy to reach up and try to knock away the man’s hand.
Everyone watched with rapt attention. This had gone on much longer than the others’ checks. At this point, Strange was levitating an inch or so off the ground. Clint looked over at Steve, who looked like he might vomit out of nervousness.
Tony felt like his head was splitting open, and he bent over, holding it between his legs.
When Natasha opened her mouth, it wasn’t her voice that responded.
Tony couldn’t decide which was worse, the thirst or sitting in his own waste. The smell was nauseating but he knew if he allowed himself to vomit he’d only die faster. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing, even though no one was here to see it. Unlike his usual kidnappings, there wasn’t even a camera in the room to indicate that he was being watched. He was thoroughly alone.
pant, parry,
Tony started to argue, but JARVIS interrupted,
he pretended to be confused.
Clint heard the begging note to that and realized that Tony’s voice had wavered like he might cry.
Natasha thought the pout and crossed arms made the kid look just like a mini Tony. It was adorable.
he said with a small smile before walking towards the door.
They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.
He walked away as though he hadn’t just been toppling Tony’s self-control with his lips.
Tony indicated the knob on the side of the eyepiece,
Clint would wager it started with the game of darts with Sam. He missed a shot, and Hawkeye never misses a shot. Everyone pointed out that he had been injured and tired from battle, but Clint knew something was amiss. Steve thought he remembered his sketchbook being ruined by the exploding pen happening before that, but he could be wrong. Tony was 68.2% certain that it began with his suit’s repulsor misfiring during the AIM raid. Natasha and Phil decided it must be when Fury lost his eyepatch, because the man never lost his eyepatch. When did Nick Fury misplace something? Bruce might guess it was the most recent chemical explosion in his lab, but Tony argued those were frequent enough that maybe Bruce was just too reckless with solution mixing. The laughter was unanimously uproarious at the suggestion coming from the most reckless scientist in the building. Thor unabashedly proclaimed that he did not pay attention to details so he would never have noticed the start.
Steve said as he pulled off Tony’s jacket and his shirt, gently folding them and setting them aside.
Tony said nothing but he nodded. Everything he had just learned running through his head. So there was a price on his head. Alright. He could deal with this. He’d dealt with it many times; it was no different now just because it was the Ten Rings. When he looked up, it was just Steve left there with him. He had that pinched look on his face he always had when he didn’t know what to say, but otherwise his face was unreadable, something Tony wasn’t used to. As far as Tony was concerned, Steve was an open book. His face showed every little emotion, and Tony took so much comfort in that, being used to constantly wearing a mask himself. He’ll admit sometimes he misread the thoughts beneath the emotions on Steve’s face, but he almost always got the emotions right. The fact that right now he looked so blank was unnerving.
he moved so quickly that Tony wasn’t sure what happened. He blinked one moment, and the next the vampire had his throat and Tony was fighting to breathe.
his voice broke.
he whined.
Steve wasn’t ignorant to the fact that the heat was blasting in the car, no doubt Tony had told Happy to turn up the heat. Tony always thought of all the small details for people’s comfort and never wanted thanks. Steve wanted all the reporters and congressmen that thought Tony was an asshole to see this side of his lover.
Clint agreed but he waited for what Tash had to say. She always had better ideas than he did. She stood quietly for a moment before giving a slight nod and sitting right there on the floor.
Thor enthused. It may or may not actually be one of Tony’s secret dreams, but he knew he’d never be able to get into it without a media shit-storm claiming he was trying to poke fun or was a bigot. Really, he wasn’t sure where the idea had come about that Tony would be conservative or right-wing was beyond him. His dad may have been a capitalist douche bag, but even Howard had thought being anti-LGBTQ+ was just plain stupid. Like who cares what people do in their private lives? If it’s not hurting anyone…
He was pleading now. He stood up and closed the distance, grabbing Steve’s hands.
That could not be a fun way to go. The panic settled quickly in his gut as Ty’s back began retreating. This was actually a good plan.
Tony said.
Lt. Germaine nodded.
Steve couldn’t believe what the doctors and Bruce were saying.
he replied firmly.
Steve really, really wished he could.
Tony said, voice still weak.
Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet.
he couldn’t say it. He swallowed.
JARVIS betrayed him. Tony glared up at the ceiling; his AI would know it’s directed at him.
Steve’s flat affect let a flash of anger and hurt through before he schooled his features again.
They entered through the front door, hands up, trying to keep the cops calm. Luckily, no one had taken a bullet yet, but the air in the bank was full of fear. The huddled six civilians were all crying and a couple were hyperventilating.
The small black box in his pocket brought Steve back to the present. He patted the lump, taking a deep breath. He was
The Avengers alarm sounded throughout the tower.
He held his hands up in front of him submissively.
Tony shrugged it off.
he spat. Tony wasn’t trying to sound so angry, but it helped mask the urge to cry instead. He felt like a little kid again.
Tony started. Steve had turned back to cooking, though, and wasn’t looking at Tony.
Tony propped his head up with his elbows on the table, smirking.
Tony yawned, trying to stifle it with his hand. Maybe they wouldn’t notice. He didn’t want to sleep yet. He needed to explain himself to Steve before the anger stewed. The last thing he wanted was Steve to sit here all night, mulling over exactly how angry he was at Tony.
He opened his eyes and yup, there was that pity in their eyes; that worry and exhaustion and relief all at his expense. It only made him feel all the more guilty. He never wanted to make his team feel that way, or Pep and Rhodey, and especially Steve. He didn’t deserve this kind of love from all of them. They were all stronger and better than he’d ever be.
This realization was what brought the memory of his mother’s words back. It had been a vague, and ultimately useless, warning that Tony would have to deal with whatever mess his parents left behind. Maria knew the things Howard did, both good and bad. For the sake of her sanity, she willingly looked the other way when she could, but she feared for her son’s future. She wanted to teach him to be better; to be a good mother who didn’t raise her son to become an alcoholic, abusive, war-profiteer. She really ached to do but right by Anthony Edward Stark, but she was weak.
Steve nodded, a look of horror on his face for a moment.
Clint breathed. He looked absolutely wrecked.
Tony looked at him and wheezed. He couldn’t take much more of this.
he sighed heavily, then continued before anyone could turn away the apology.
Steve’s voice came from the helmet. Tony closed his eyes, glad he’d heard that voice one more time before he died.
Clint rescued him, thank god, while he got himself another mug of coffee.
Bruce’s vest lit up as an example.
he moaned.
she remembered to say. Trish was going to be so jealous that she met Iron Man and Captain America!
Bruce dropped his head in defeat.
Tony was already over this. He was not excited for whatever this shithead magician coward who was torturing him without showing their face had in store for him next. His lightheadedness was getting worse. Tony had calmed enough to open his eyes and watch Wanda and Strange. They shared another meaningful look. Wanda stepped backwards towards the corner of the room. Apparently, they decided Strange would be handling this for now.
He asked the silent lab.
He pulled his phone out with shaky hands and dialed JARVIS.
Strange began.
Tony shook his head.
Warnings for vague discussion of alcohol abuse, and mentions of child abuse.
It turned out that Norman wanted Tony to tell him how to replicate his particle accelerator to create badassium. The patent company didn’t allow him to call the new element powering the reactor that, but Tony had the best lawyers. He hadn’t given up.
This wasn’t their thing, Tony and Clint didn’t talk feelings, they goofed around and teased each other. Everyone on the team had had at least one of their ‘Tony Talks’ as they had been deemed, everyone except Clint. Clint heard about them only in hearsay, but a Tony Talk was apparently always eye-opening for both parties. Tony kept things close to his chest for the most part, Clint did too, so whenever a Tony Talk did happen, whether it was because the two people got really drunk, or because a duo mission got unexpectedly serious and adrenaline pushed truths out of the closet, it was a big deal.
he attempted to explain.
She shook her head, a tired smile playing around her lips.
Tony hated being too broken to do simple things like sit up on his own. He knew he was the weakest and most fragile on the team. He didn’t need a reminder of that, especially with all of them watching. He closed his eyes and nodded so he wouldn’t have to see the pity as the bed slowly brought him to a more upright position.
His eyes slid up, meeting Clint’s, but he otherwise remained unmoved.
Bruce took a steadying breath. Peter’s hand in his gave him the strength to go on. He could do this.
Perfect!
Bruce and the doctor shared a look.
Bruce said quietly. The hints of anger could be heard simmering beneath his tone. It was obvious he was ready to go Hulk soon, but he knew Hulk couldn’t sneak, he’d have to wait until the go ahead.
Tony didn’t even see which ring it came from this time; he was too distracted by the pain. Heat was radiating from the Mandarin’s left hand, burning Tony’s right. Tony screamed as his skin blistered before his eyes up his forearm and covering his palm. He wasn’t going to be able to hold anything with that hand for awhile. His screams died slowly and he realized that the Mandarin wasn’t even burning him anymore, but the pain was still excruciating.
Thor said from behind her. She turned and moved to let him step into the group semi circle they had formed.
The doctor nodded at Bruce before turning.
Steve remarked lightly. He wasn’t worried. Tony hadn’t gotten too drunk since they’d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.
Tony had to admit that this was starting to look like vampires. Natasha couldn’t see her reflection, she was enhanced in some way, the UV rays hurting her… But this? The fact that her mission she had been on was in Transylvania? It’s like the universe was playing a cruel prank on him. Bram Stoker wasn’t even Transylvanian! Transylvanians don’t even believe in vampires. Count Dracula, well Steve said not to call him a Count, was an Irish fiction. This had to be either his October bad luck, or a Clint make-Tony-scream prank.
He finished his juice and stretched. He snagged the poptart out of Clint’s hand and took a large bite. At the archer’s squawk of disbelief, Tony shrugged with a crumby grin.
Steve sucked in a sharp hiss. He had known about the palladium poisoning, but no one ever talked about it.
Tony allowed himself a small smile at the reference in his command code. He really hoped this worked, and theoretically he could survive it, even. It was just untested and unstable.
Tony was so thankful that the cave was facing the rising sun so he could fully appreciate the blush that coloured Steve’s cheeks.
Tony sat up, pointing an accusatory finger at his adversary.
The effect wasn’t immediate. Tony had figured at first that he had made the right choice to be nice, because the stranger stood with his help and placed a hand on his shoulder in a friendly-seeming gesture. The man’s smile was creepy because of the width of it, but Tony had met aliens before. Maybe this species would think Tony’s small mouth was creepy.
she asked. He nodded.
Things were looking good for her until Krupp suddenly smirked back. He shouldn’t look that confident in the face of her strength. He lurched forward. She wasn’t fast enough to avoid the hand that now gripped her throat. Krupp lifted her in the air, and she kicked him uselessly. She pried at his fingers, gasping for breath, but Krupp was stronger than her.
So when Clint this morning went to brush his teeth, the plan was for him to go get his bag out of its hiding spot in the vents. What Clint didn’t know was that Tony had placed a trap for him there, that was motion sensitive. Clint wouldn’t know what hit him when the flex cage Tony had designed suddenly wraps around his body. If he managed to not scream as he was trapped, there was still more to the plan. Clint was afraid of spiders. It was a weakness Tony hadn’t taken advantage of in previous years because it felt like cheating, but after last year’s loss where Clint had used his fear of water against him, Tony was finished with mercy. The archer thought he hid the fear well, but he tensed up ever so slightly at the sight of a spider, and Tony had found footage from a CCTV camera outside a grocery store that showed the man screaming and freaking out when a spider landed on his arm. If Clint didn’t scream from the trap, Tony could activate a small door built into the wall of the vent where several spiders were currently very crowded in a tiny space. They would crawl out any chance they got.
I couldn't resist the excuse to talk about Clint's deafness, which I still wish was in the MCU, I'll admit. I tried to mimic the grammar rules of ASL when they use it here, but I'll admit my ASL is limited to only what I need for talking to my autistic brother. I apologize for any inaccuracies or mis-portrayals, and I make ZERO claim to understanding the deaf community or what deafness is like. I try to do justice, and if I offended anyone, please let me know.
Steve snapped. How was the team supposed to operate of they were keeping things like this from each other?
Tony burst out laughing, and Peter blushed deeper. Steve punched the man.
Tony settled into his rolling chair and immersed himself in the text on the screen beside his initial sketches. There were still a lot of kinks to figure out on this one.
Clint eyed his boyfriend with disbelief.
Phil chuckled knowingly. MORE THAN LITTLE, he signed as they sat to their breakfast.
His smile was too bright, tone too forced, but everyone let it lie.
Julie smiled warmly.
Now that he was here, what was he supposed to do? It would probably take ages for Bruce to find him here, he had chosen the floor at random. Tony jumped into a chair in one of the rooms, rolling it over towards the windows so he could look at the view. Maybe he should come up with some more stuff to fill these floors so he had an excuse to visit them. The view was very different here than up in the penthouse. He obviously couldn’t see as much of New York, but he could make out the details of the street a little better. Plus the way the sunlight shone through between the gaps between buildings was kind of nice. Maybe Steve would like an art studio. That’d be a good use.
Clint felt his voice rip through him against his will, and it hurt. He felt like he was gargling jagged stones, speaking to his mom.
Tony’s expression was hurt but Steve held up the box.
Tony demanded, his hands on his hips.
Tony exclaimed.
He let out a startled yell when Dr. Strange was suddenly standing just behind him with two fingers to Tony’s temple.
Steve’s voice was low and dangerous.
Tony groaned dramatically.
he murmured.
Steve stipulated, letting the brunette help him up.
she asked suddenly.
Steve asked. He hung up another punching bag.
That was the wrong answer. All of Steve’s movements became sharp and harsh, slamming plates down and dumping food on them messily before throwing utensils in the sink. The clamour seemed to solidify that Tony had fucked up.
Clint asked. Tony crossed his arms with a smirk, knowing Clint wasn’t going to pass up the chance to embarrass Tony with a bet.
he finished with a wink. Steve thought that was a perfect time to leave.
When the medics took him away, he stood rooted to the sidewalk, watching the ambulance leave. He had barely got a word in to tell the medics about Bruce giving them the information when they got there. His mouth felt like cotton. His head was buzzing and his ears were ringing.
Clint let out a long sigh.
Tony started, but the response wasn’t JARVIS.
Abram said with a smile.
Clint saw Phil’s shoes from down the hall, neatly placed just inside the doorway. When he walked in, Phil looked up from the same book Clint had left sitting on the bed.
Steve still hadn’t said anything, and Tony knew that was always a bad sign. He was usually the first busybody in these conversations going on and on about how Tony needed to take care of himself.
Wanda asked quietly. The doctor had to strain to hear her over Tony’s hissing breaths as the new pain subsided.
he added bitterly. Before Tony could butt in he continued.
God, the man had just saved her life, and she was awkward and star-struck.
Tony was no longer on the side of a country road. He was suddenly in Gulmira watching small children begging and crying while men scarred them for lives by holding them at gunpoint with
Dr. Stein interrupted his schemes.
Steve sat down on the stool next to Tony.
Steve glanced around the room.
he emphasized that he already had a team of experts called security,
Steve’s whisper was barely audible over the sound of the car’s quiet engine.
he explained to Heather.
He had found a range of only a few days where the steady increase of incidents had started. The likelihood of incident was exponentially increasing and it had started sometime about four weeks ago. After he narrowed down the data to sift through his brain had done the thing. He frowned, annoyed at all of it.
While Steve had been climbing, Tony had managed to make a sack of sorts out of the sleeves of his undersuit that he cut off. Steve could see the pieces of the armor sticking out on all sides. It hung down Tony’s back, with it tied to fit like a sash in front of him, and it had to be heavy.
Thor grinned proudly. He headed for the poptart cupboard.
Ty chuckled, and Tony had missed the sound. In a fairly lonely childhood with terrible parents, a friend like Ty was everything. Being wrapped in his arms used to feel like home in a way the Stark Mansion never could despite Jarvis’ best efforts. The sound cut off abruptly, and Tony watched the other man’s face suddenly snap into a cold glare, no trace of the previous mirth. The look seemed wrong on Ty. His eyes looked empty. Tony tried to quell the pang of sadness he felt for his kidnapper. What had the world done to him?
Everyone nodded and Steve shut down his emotional side again as he listened to Strange chant in some foreign language. The group was engulfed in an orange glow, with the light source coming from Dr. Strange himself. Steve blinked as the light reached the point of blinding then died down and they weren’t on the Helicarrier anymore, they were in a large room with lush carpeting and decorated walls. Everyone took a fighting stance without a second thought, looking around for the Mandarin and anyone else who may be waiting.
The Mandarin looked slightly surprised at Tony’s demeanor.
Clint had to take a page out of Black Widow’s book and fight with a well placed knife because his arrows were useless against these things. Clint could fight nearly as well as Natasha, but the Black Widow program wasn’t a failure. Natasha Romanov had advantages over unmodified humans. She could move just that much faster, was just that much stronger.
Clint asked softly, in case he was already asleep./p>
he answered eventually.
The problem was that Peter knew him too well. He could always tell when Wade was lying.
domain. It was humiliating. He was the lord of all vampires and he had to work with humans to get rid of humans. When the war ended, the two allies parted ways, knowing the truce was finished.
he yelled back at the cowering people behind them.
Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn’t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn’t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.
he broke off into a cry as the skin on his feet started to boil. The Mandarin laughed maniacally and slowly baked Tony’s legs, following him as he squirmed. As Tony tried to fall out of the chair to get away, a white light started glowing along with the red coming from the Mandarin’s hand, making Tony somehow heavier and pinning him to the chair.
Steve met Tony’s eyes. Tony blushed and looked away. He cleared his throat and waved his hand around in the air. Apparently JARVIS understood that to mean to continue.
Steve couldn’t help the painful tightening of his hand around Tony’s. The questions directed at them were so different and obviously judgmental about the two of them and it pissed him off. Everyone was prepared for Steve to be an innocent backwards old man and for Tony to be a promiscuous conniving bastard. Tony, on the other hand, was used to it. He shot the offending reporter a wicked grin.
There wasn’t enough time to break down. There was barely enough time to plan, and they didn’t even have an idea for a plan. It was too much.
Steve wrapped his arms around his genius and put their foreheads together, just breathing in his presence. Tony could feel how tense the supersoldier was, so he started kneading at the others shoulders. The boiling anxiety slowly subsided to a simmer in the background. That was probably the best he could get at the moment.
he directed at Bruce.
he looked at Steve sharply. There was a piece to his puzzle missing. Clint and he had been stable, there had been no reason to drug him.
Tony took a steadying breath.
Clint shrugged. DON’T SEE WHY WE CAN’T KEEP GOING, he grinned, dragging Coulson onto their makeshift dance floor. Clint signed towards the ceiling to turn the music back on. Coulson took his partner’s lead, dancing to the vibrations they could feel despite the silence. The party continued a bit awkwardly after that, everyone unsure of how the weekend would go. Bruce felt a little annoyed that Steve and Tony seemed to make a unilateral decision without anyone else’s input, but who was he to talk? They were the team leaders.
Steve commanded.
Strange groaned, but opened his eyes and stood, holding onto the armor’s shoulder for support. He didn’t speak, clearly struggling to stay conscious, but he did open a portal in front of them.
Tony smiled, smug already.
Wade felt his face break into a grin. He gripped Pete’s arm again.
The pain in his torso helpfully chose that moment to give him a wave of agony that had him gasping for the breath, arching his back until he was leaned up against the wall again. When he caught his breath again,
Abram stammered,
Tony stayed on the couch in the entertainment room as the group left for bed, one by one. Steve gave him a look that silently begged him to go to bed before heading off himself, leaving Tony alone. He knew that he really should get some sleep, he hadn’t slept more than a couple of hours in a row for weeks. The problem was that as soon as he tried to lay down, the silence of his room in the darkness would fill with the musings of his self loathing.
Steve began. They were all standing in the gym wearing vests Steve had brought. Tony rolled his eyes.
Clint wanted to scream.
As she drew closer to the kidnapper, she could hear more details. Poor Mr. Marcus was yelling through the wooden box he was locked in, but it was too muffled for her to make out. Jessica couldn’t help the way she winced slightly with each plop of dirt onto the box.
Tony felt a spike of energy and his heart sped up. It became a little easier to breathe so he brought back the taunting.
Clint asked.
His voice was barely audible even within the couple of inches they were apart. He was counting on Steve’s super soldier hearing. Steve stirred, luckily not waking Tony.
Steve said softly.
She pulled him in for a fierce hug.
from the archer. Tony sighed. Time for plan B. He tapped the small icon on his phone that would activate the spiders. This had to work, it was full proof!
It was silly because JARVIS couldn’t see him, but Steve felt himself nodding.
Steve smiled tiredly.
Strange was loathe to admit it, but Tony’s science had saved the day.
And Steve thought Tony was the overly self-sacrificing one.
he flashed a fake smile.
The trial was very straight forward. Jessica had witnessed the attempted murder, and the rest of the cases had plenty of fingerprints to place him with the body. The only reason they were there at all was because The Digger was going for an insanity plea, but Murdock wasn’t having any of it. Without Jessica’s witness testimony, there may have been a chance of reasonable doubt because Krupp worked at the cemetery and his fingerprints could just be on the tools others used. Circumstantial evidence, it was called. It had taken weeks of exhuming and using some sort of underground sonar to find all of the bodies, as they were hidden amongst the graves that actually belonged there. She had to admit that hiding bodies in a cemetery was a good plan.
When Tony finally woke a day later, he was afraid to open his eyes. He assumed he was still in the Mandarin’s mansion, and maybe if the Mandarin thought he was unconscious, he’d stop hurting Tony. The longer he was awake, the more aware he became of the sounds around him, though, and those included the familiar sounds of a breathing machine. So he was in medical. He slowly opened his eyes, and luckily the lights were dimmed. He hated waking to bright, fucking white lights. He slid his eyes to the right and saw Steve, watching him carefully. God, the bags under Steve’s eyes. At least he wasn’t a block of ice.
Tony said quietly. It was so strangely intimate, but it also didn’t feel weird like it should. This was his drinking buddy, but also the guy who had to have his back on the battlefield. If he could let Tony hold his life in his hands, which he definitely has before, then he can talk about scars.
Tony was being shaken, and god, everything hurt, and his heart was racing faster than he ever thought was possible.
Tony sighed. They began trudging through the woods, the pieces of the suits clanking with each step. The temperature was mild enough, but the air was humid and Tony’s arms were being eaten alive by mosquitos. If only he hadn’t needed the sleeves to carry the stupid suit.
Steve looked at him seriously until the silence started to grow uncomfortable.
Tony snorted.
Dr. Strange told them.
He had to sleep down here. Steve would be so pissed if he saw Tony drunk right now. He wouldn’t understand. To be honest, who would? He grabbed the whole bottle of whiskey and took a couple mouthfuls. The resulting head spinning was worth it; maybe he’d pass out with no nightmares. It had been so long since he’d drank, since Steve had helped him get clean. He tried so hard to make Steve proud, but he always ended up failing. Why does he even try? Tony has been disappointing the ones he loves for as long as he can remember, from parents to the few friends he has.
Steve murmured. Tony was crying into his chest now.
Clint asked, still showing no emotion, which was almost scarier than anger in Abram’s opinion.
Clint muttered, jogging over to kneel in front of Steve.
Tony said, face mask flipped up.
Clint gripped Steve’s thighs, grounding him a little, stopping that feeling that he was falling away. Phil knelt beside Steve, one hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing.
Clint snorted.
Steve knew Clint understood. He thanked God he had finally found a group of people who understood each other and him better than the rest of the world possibly could. If anyone could understand Tony, it was Clint. They had fairly similar experiences as far as relationships and betrayals from what Steve could tell.
Tony shoved the tablet at Steve first.
Jenny’s eyes widened as she realized what he was saying. She shook her head furiously,
Tony had never been out this long. And wow, his voice was gruff.
A woman from the back shouted.
It's a song I learned for Columbus Children's Choir ages ago because we were going on tour in Hungary. We learned an English translation as well as the Hungarian, but it's near impossible to find the translation recorded. It's just stuck with me all these years, and it really is a Hungarian folk song, like Steve says.
That stopped Clint’s line of thought short.
Frank put the kids down on the ground, pulling Maria into a hug.
This one is inspired by
Tony enjoyed eating with the team. He hadn’t realized he missed their family dinners. Clint and Thor were always up to hilarious antics. Tony gorged himself on the delicious food, though it didn’t take much. His stomach probably shrank again, which meant he had been accidentally starving himself again. Whoops. He watched Natasha throw soap foam all over Bruce while they did the dishes, enjoying the pure domestic joy he never thought he would get in life. How had Tony tricked these wonderful people into living with him? He didn’t deserve their love.
he said casually, pulling Steve into him.
Bruce was barely holding it together. Steve couldn’t blame the man as he stormed away, green tinged skin shimmering before Bruce dug his nails into his skin. Steve hoped he could keep away the Other Guy for now.
Strange was explaining to Bruce and Natasha as Phil walked up. Clint was over talking to a few of the other agents.
he blurted, thinking this was a very different conversation.
Tony was standing in the kitchen, cornered by his friends.
Clint asked, touching a finger to the ice. Natasha slapped it away.
she commented drily.
Okay, Steve breathed. This would work. He would give himself up and Dracula would give up Tony. Then Vision could get Tony to a hospital quickly, while the others saved Steve. It would be risky, but it would work.
He grabbed Steve by the wrist, starting to drag him towards the hall.
he stammered.
The side of Phil's mouth twitched.
Tony heard the grunt Steve made as he caught the shield on the other end of the comm.
Happy said as they pulled up to the tower.
he groaned.
He shouted. The Hulk stilled, but did not yet turn to face the tiny man in the metal suit. He took another step towards the building where something seemed to be calling to him, opting to ignore the voice of the tin man.
Tony’s energy had been flagging over the last hour. He had gone from looking excited and flamboyant to looking tired and withdrawn. Steve caught him wiping a sweaty brow a few times, but until now, had only assumed it was due to the running around in a tux in a fairly hot room. No one else seemed to be sweating though.
It was the best Tony could expect. He was asking Steve to hold his life in their hands together. While they all trusted each other in battle, this was different. Both of them were out of their depth, and scared. The wrong decision could mean the end of Iron Man, or the end of Tony Stark altogether. It was the kind of tough decision that one normally made with their spouse, but Tony was asking Steve to do this and he hadn’t even proposed. Whatever was to come, Tony was really grateful that he didn’t have to do this alone.
he bit out, not moving from his spot staring at the bar. More silence. Goddamnit.
he said with a shrug as though that explained anything at all.
Tony growled in frustration. He had never tried to voice these feelings out loud.
The portal Loki opened beneath them, with no warning, dropped them from above ground. The god of mischief looked very pleased with himself as everyone picked themselves off the ground, grumbling.
Steve grit out angrily. The man smirked at Steve. He was asking to get his nose broken.
Jessica asked incredulously. She had stopped scribbling notes in her pad to eye the mistress.
Steve turned, looking hopeful.
Clint clamoured out of his seat, aiming the nearest of Natasha’s guns at the intruder.
he sighed.
Tony squinted at the man.
his voice monotone. This was a stupid contest, he shouldn’t be this upset about it. Stupid Tony Stark being oversensitive when he loses a stupid game because his plans are stupid. And the world called him a genius? Boy, had he fooled everyone. He was never going to get revenge on Clint.
he spoke softly. Jane had never heard him speak so softly. His voice sounded steeped in hurt.
he boomed.
This year, SI was working on an international project that took more oversight from Tony than usual. He was meeting with leaders around the globe to hammer out details of the Global Clean Energy Project (GCEP) and how it could fit into each country’s laws. More of them had issues with government contracts with electrical companies and oil or coal burning industries than he had initially thought. Between Pepper, the lawyers, and him, this October had been one long world-tour of legalese and diplomacy.
The walk back the next morning was slow. Tony had to take a few breaks, but these injuries were child’s play for them. They were still able to joke around and have fun while they walked.
The tubes he was hooked up to said he’d been unconscious for awhile. “In fairness, this has got to be a first that someone saved a life by cannibalism, so, Tony slurred, already feeling drugs pull him back under.
His leg had stopped bouncing.
were just representations of coding, which Tony had proceeded to rattle off as a string of letters and numbers that Steve had no hope of understanding. JARVIS had even acted against Tony’s orders on rare occasions when he believed he knew better (which he often did). If he truly had no feelings, he wouldn’t be able to go against orders. Steve was no expert on artificial intelligences by all means, but he decided to believe that JARVIS had grown beyond his coding. He thinks Tony believed it too, but he’d never admit it.
The watch formed on his wrist as he explained.
Clint's breath caught. How many times was he going to have to have magical people in his head? His experience with Loki still felt like a raw wound. He nodded his understanding anyways with the others. What choice did he actually have?
Tony let out a long breath and dropped his face to his hands. He couldn’t let Steve see him like this, but if he stayed down here all night, Steve would figure it out anyway and come down.
he blushed,
Thor looked thoughtful for a moment.
His tone stopped Tony short. Bruce was his best friend; he never meant to make Bruce sound so hurt and bone-tired.
She started walking, clearly expecting him to follow.
he spoke sincerely. He couldn’t lie and tell Steve that he was wrong, but he could apologize for it.
Jessica confirmed. She ended the call and looked around again. It was only one more block. There were some things she’d want from the apartment if she was going to Trish’s (mainly her own liquor, Trish’s choices were atrocious) then she’d call her.
Luckily, Richards was
Steve kicked down the door to the dungeon where Tony was being held. SHIELD had officially forbade the team from entering Symkaria, calling it a potential catalyst for war with Latveria. Unofficially, however, Fury had given them the go ahead. He knew the team would’ve gone anyway, so he used his connections to warn the proper authorities that they’d need to play diplomatic charades to work around the fiasco.
Maybe he could get some answers while he had Tony’s attention.
Phil gave the rest of them pointed looks which totally said
The words straight from the international bounty Tony had had no clue about. He was vaguely aware that his legs had buckled. He thought the Mandarin wasn’t real; that all of this nonsense was behind him.
Tony grumbled.
As they pulled in front of the tower, Tony threw open the door and got out on his own before Steve could try and bring the wheelchair. He stalked off, ignoring Steve’s protests, wishing to just escape people for awhile. He was sick of their concern. Unfortunately, that backfired when they both had to wait for the elevator.
he added wryly, tapping on the reactor.
he realized aloud.
her voice sounded warped by the cell phone’s speaker.
He looked up at her. It was such a wise thing for a child to say, all of the Avengers looked a little taken aback.
He ducked just in time at Clint’s warning, and the boulder flew over his head. There had been no air movement or noise to warn him, so his reflexes were useless.
They snuggled into the couch again, Peter forcing his dads to lean on each other to hold his tiny hands in the middle. He balanced himself on one leg from each of them. Without speaking, he pointed at Thor.
And he was begging. He searched the Hulk’s eyes and he could see the conflict warring in them. Whatever had set Bruce off, he was clearly in less control than usual and Tony suspected it was somehow similar to Loki’s staff all those years ago.
he popped the ‘p.’ They were probably almost finished, and Bruce’s movements were getting more agitated by the minute. Tony watched him from the corner of his eye and noticed the way Bruce’s steps were halting and his hands were making stilted twitches as he picked up another metallic tool. He wanted to call him out on it, but sometimes just pointing out Bruce’s agitated states could push him over the edge. He had to keep the semblance of calm.
Like hell Tony was going to betray his friends’ fears.
Tony groused as he shut the door, but he chuckled softly as Happy pulled away.
Tony slid across the table, rolling as he hit the ground and popping up in the hallway. There were a few options for him, and he might’ve made the mistake of running straight into Thor, but the demigod gave himself away by laughing loudly in his enthusiasm for the game. Tony saw the lit up red vest in time to dart right, heading for one of the two staircases on the floor. That answered his question as to whether or not he was the first Bruce found. Tony began running up the steps, taking them three at a time. He made it up to 32, but decided it was time to venture onto the floor, a little out of breath but still wanting enough energy to dodge and dive if need be. Tony had to admit, although begrudgingly, that the workout of both mind and body was nice without the pressure of serious injury or death.
The Palais Garnier Opera House had a long history, and was built to last. The decor was beautiful, and the acoustics superb. Every show had sold out, without fail, for the last decade. Nothing was a more popular way for the local aristocracy to socialize and show off, and there was no way Frank would have ever been allowed near the inside with his measly military stipend and small cop wage. Opera was a snobby affair, Frank decided. The old building was also not built with escape routes or threat visibility in mind, unfortunately. Luckily, the opera didn’t seem like a place a fight was likely to break out.
Clint and Bruce started fidgeting but Natasha doesn't take shit.
Tony tried to reactivate his nanotech with his thoughts. He knew it wouldn’t work, but it was worth a try, right? He began running through a list in his head of ways out of this mess, but short of somehow talking Dracula out of his admittedly logical plan, he was completely dependent on outside help to rescue him. He wondered what the rate of his blood loss would be. If he knew, he could calculate how long he had. It would probably slow down as he lost volume, he decided, since his blood pressure would keep decreasing.
he agreed softly. Steve looked so relieved that Tony felt a little terrible about the way he had shouted at the man this morning. He had let stress give him a short fuse.
So he did.
. It felt like being burned alive, but with no end in sight or deadening of the nerves. Instead, Tony tried to writhe in agony, but that only pulled harshly at his joints. Through his now blurry vision, he could tell Morgana was laughing, but the sound was lost to him. She didn’t seem to have any motivation to let up and give him a breather, so Tony had to take the small gasps his body forced him to take when his lungs grew too thirsty. With the way the magic was consuming him, he had no control over his bodily mechanics anymore. A far away part of his mind wondered if he had pissed himself. This was truly hell.
His joking smile didn’t touch his eyes, where Steve could see the unnecessary concern. If anyone ever needed concern for their well being, it was always Tony, not super soldier Steve.
The sound of shattering porcelain and glass brought Steve running there.
Coulson said drily. He caught the stapler Fury threw at him without even looking, having been through this conversation too many times before. Fury was well aware of Phil’s opinions on forced employment, but Phil wasn’t going to let a single instance slide past without reminding him.
he snarled. His voice almost had a sound of distant thunder behind it. The supernatural really gave Tony the creeps.
She took a deep breath before stepping into the light.
He reached out and laid his hand on top of Tony’s, but Tony was too heavily sedated to react to the touch. It was weird really, seeing Tony like this. Sure, he’d seen Tony injured plenty of times. The man had zero self preservation. But the injuries had always been more visible; blood seeping from a concussion, burns across his back, bullet wounds the time someone shot him without the suit, but this… It looked like Tony was just sleeping. He could see the bandages peeking out from under the gown, splinting the broken bones a little, but otherwise, nothing. Yet this had been the closest Tony had been to death in the time Steve had known him. A heart attack, of all the things to take down Iron Man, a heart attack caused by honey. And it could have been easily avoided.
she whispered.
Tony thought. The longer he monologued, the less he tortured Tony.
a male voice shouted, and suddenly Tony was crumpled on the ground, coughing and sore. The magic was no longer extending his pain though. Tony rolled around, to see the newcomer, and recognized Mephisto immediately. Next to him was a very unhappy looking Victor von Doom.
he snapped. Tony watched him leave with a perverse satisfaction. At least he always succeeded at pushing people who wanted to help away. It was his best talent.
He had just cracked open a good book when JARVIS spoke.
The restaurant was too hot. Tony was standing in the restroom for the second time already, trying to dry some of the sweat away with a paper towel. A headache was forming, and this had better not be his little experiment finally coming back to bite him in the ass. Things had been going so well! Tony felt his pulse, and it was a little fast for his liking. Right, well, they just wouldn’t get dessert, he decided. Tony could be home in no time and working out what to do with JARVIS without Steve needing to know anything was amiss.
Natasha and Bruce walked in, and Steve noticed Bruce reading all of Tony’s monitors with a focused look before actually lowering his eyes to Tony. Natasha sat on the edge of the bed, her hand ghosting over Tony’s chest. She was fiercely protective of Tony, and she had known him longer than the others had. They pulled up two chairs and sat on his other side quietly, saying nothing. They were going to stay and keep an eye on Steve, he knew; make sure he didn’t break down again. But Steve wouldn’t, not tonight. Right now he was just kind of numb inside.
Tony held out his hand, and Strange took it. The truce handshake was something Steve had forced them to do a while back, but it stuck when they got into these spats. While the two often acted like they disliked each other, they did have a mutual respect for the other’s expertise. Plus Tony liked the man when they weren’t talking magic. They got along fine, then.
His suddenly shaky legs gave out and he sat on the ground in the middle of the jet while JARVIS took care of piloting. Steve was starting to agree with Tony that maybe October was cursed.
The entire city of Paris is full of statues. No, he berates himself, they’re not statues. The population of Paris was turned to stone because he couldn’t convince Odin to help him save it fast enough. Half of the fight with serpent had nearly killed his friends while he was taking far too long in Nidavellir making their weapons worthy. If Tony had just been a little more focused, things may have gone smoothly. Every casualty in Paris was a failure that ate at him from the inside out. Tony should’ve never even tried to claim he was a hero.
Steve’s phone buzzed in his lap.
The last log of Tony’s little log cabin pyramid set up he had going and stepped back to admire his work. If Tony Stark was going to build a fire, it was going to be the best fire you’ve ever seen. He wondered idly if the two of them were capable of not competing. Looking back, everything they did tended to take on at least a slightly competitive quality. The curiosity as to why, now that he’d noticed it, was going to eat him up until he figured it out. Maybe Clint would have a good idea about it.
he groaned,
Tony acknowledged him with a nod but continued typing whatever he was typing.
JARVIS replied regretfully.
Tony rasped. His throat felt like sand paper from the screaming.
Clint whispered,
he placed a comforting hand on the genius’ shoulder.
The inconspicuous grey honda rolled quietly through the neighborhood. It was a far cry from the sleek black cars SHIELD used or the limos and sports cars of Tony’s collection.
he sighed.
It was the word alone that had been echoing through his head all day, making his chest ache. He was no use like this, though. He had to turn off his feelings, a skill he was rusty at, since he hadn’t really needed it since WWII. He took a deep breath, allowed one last fleeting thought of worry and guilt, then let it all go and became the soldier Tony and his team needed. That’s what Steve was good at, transforming into whatever was needed.
Natasha asked.
Pepper, Steve and Bruce said in unison, and good grief, was this conversation choreographed? Thor just watched the banter, amusement plain on his face.
She watched in helpless despair as he pushed the raw emotions back, and the far away sadness returned. Her mortality, although he wasn’t technically immortal, was always a sore subject. Thor was a positive, often happy man. Yet at the same time, he was a wise and old demigod, young for a demigod but much older than humans. With this wisdom came that far away sadness that Jane was pretty sure most people couldn’t see. Only sometimes could she push it away.
He turned, waiting.
he deadpanned.
he asked, not meeting anyone’s eyes. He’d at least pretend he had some dignity. Pepper held out a glass of water she had already filled while Dr. Stein was talking to Tony. Pep always thought of everything. Tony drained it with a satisfied sigh.
he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.
Iron man held a thumb up to indicate a yes.
Tony caught the demon off guard with  the repulsor blast that hit his face. 19%. It didn’t seem to do too much damage, but it did break his concentration enough for Strange to escape the spell, gasping for air. Nightmare tumbled in the air a moment before righting himself, now glaring at Tony. Tony had no idea how the armor would hold up to magic. Luckily he didn’t have to find out, because Strange shouted a very foreign sounding word, and a projected rope tied the demon up tight, and he struggled against the bounds to no avail.
He stormed off, holding his head in his hands.
Natasha said, taking care not to sound accusatory.
Steve was off on his morning run, Phil was out of town for a mission, and Clint and Bruce were still in bed, so Tony was the only one else in the room. He lifted his head off his arms to see who she was talking to and quirked an eyebrow.
He said as he walked into their kitchen, bringing out the tools for that hot chocolate Steve had already forgotten about. Still flushed and breathing a little shallow, he stepped up behind Tony, wrapping his arms around the genius’ waist. Tony melted into the touch of course, and leaned his head back for a chaste kiss before continuing to make the hot chocolate.
The others were wrapping up with Osborn and his henchmen. Steve made it to Tony’s side, panic only increasing at the sight before him. Tony’s eyes were wide and unseeing as he screamed in silence. His chest was heaving with ragged gasps. Steve ripped away the leather bounds tying him to the table. His body free, Tony writhed in obvious agony. Steve could see the bruises and swelling of broken bones, the seeping wound in his side, the mysterious capture still sticking out of the man, and the burns scattered across the olive skin, but not whatever invisible force seemed to be possessing Tony currently.
Tony was lying on top of him restfully after the sex. Steve smiled as he played with Tony’s hair and thought about the couch beneath them. It was getting a little lumpy. Maybe he should buy a new one for Christmas. That seemed like a good gift for Tony. The billionaire would never think to replace it himself. They both slept on this old thing often enough, and Steve didn’t want Tony to get a sore back.
Peter begged.
Bruce stood in front of them all, fidgeting a little. Bruce didn’t talk about his childhood. Ever. They all had vague ideas about his history, but even Natasha hadn’t read about it in his SHIELD file. She normally valued knowing people over their privacy, but Bruce was so private and meek, it just felt wrong to pry. The scientist pulled his glasses off, wiped them with his shirt, put them back on. He glanced between Steve and Tony a few times before locking eyes with Tony.
he reminded Strange.
Tony pulled the man into a hug. That was news to him. He didn’t need to be told the underlying statement there. Steve remembered every horrific memory perfectly, too. Tony couldn’t imagine remembering every liberated holocaust camp Steve must’ve seen. He stood and held his hand out to Steve. It was time to get on their way. Steve didn’t need any more reminiscing right now, and Tony had work to do.
Natasha pinned him against the wall with one hand.
Clint let up and Tony rolled over, deciding the floor was fine anyway.
he whined. Clint laughed but with no malice. He could still remember what building up the muscles for this was like, and Tony probably never needed to use his trapezius, deltoid, and triceps with his fighting style. The man was lean and strong, had to be to pilot the suit, but his upper back was not his strong suit.
A shocked Clint asked the room as a whole.
as Clint slyly flipped the door sign to
She scoffed.
Steve hugged his lover in return. Tony nuzzled into his warm chest.
Jenny met his gaze, frowning.
he started, but Peter placed a finger to his lips and made a shushing noise.
– Phil
He started to walk around the lab, gathering things onto a table and moving things around, but Tony couldn’t see much from where he was seated. Tony did notice that they were in a very large and luxuriously decorated building, probably the Mandarin’s infamous mansion. He started thinking through how long it would probably take the Avengers to track him and how long he could last with this madman; the prognosis wasn’t looking great. The Mandarin came back around the corner, levitating a chair behind him and placing it beside Tony.
Maria Castiglione was the undisputed best singer of the Palais Garnier Opera House, and had been for the last three years. While she wasn’t a fan of their current show, she adored getting the crowd’s love, and always wanted to give them their money’s worth. Tonight would be no different, she decided as she eyed her reflection. She started warming up her voice as she did her hair, knowing she wouldn’t have enough time to do so once she was backstage. Her protective guard staring at her while she warmed up always seemed weird anyway, so at least they always stood outside of the dressing room. A lot of the police were creepy brutes. She often wondered if she needed protection from them.
JARVIS voice doomed Tony. The scan of Natasha was messing with his AI now.
Tony heard the sound of MODOK’s hovering chair too late and turned in time for one of his telekinetic force blasts to hit Tony in the left shoulder, sending him crashing into a nearby office building. He brushed off the debris and took to the air again. Ow, his shoulder ached. Sometimes it was easy to forget what getting hit felt like because a lot of things didn’t hit hard enough to hurt through the armor. He came around the building and shot a repulsor blast at MODOK, who was heading towards Hawkeye’s vantage point. He dodged easily, but Hawkeye took the hint.
and collapsed, unconscious. Steve stood rooted to the spot in the hall while the staff rushed in around him. Monitors began screeching again and there was chaos, but Steve could only stare. He must’ve locked his knees or something, because he passed out not long after the others.
he trailed off.
JARVIS said.
Clint wanted to explain.
Steve cut him off.
he whispered. There, he had said it. That should explain it all, right? What more needed explaining? He had to save enough people before he died or die trying.
What he found was somehow worse than the reactors being stolen. Both crates were still full, minus the three reactors he had used since bringing the crates over from Malibu. But they could hardly be called reactors at this point. They were all dark, completely drained of any energy. They looked like empty husks. It was eerily similar to finding a pile of dead insects. Tony found it creepy, even though neither the insects, or the inanimate objects, were ever intelligent creatures. Not to mention, that this meant something was definitely wrong down here. What could have done this?
he asked louder.
Strange stood up straighter, his cloak billowing behind him.
Tony rummaged around in the tent behind him, pulling out his bag.
Steve couldn’t deny that he was curious.
Steve asked.
he cried miserably.
Tony’s face scrunched up in confusion. Steve only asked that after something bad happened, or Tony had a hangover, but he’d been clean for awhile. Tony sifted through his somewhat foggy mind, trying to remember what happened before he fell asleep. He and Steve were on a date, Tony was sober. They had great baklava, had made love, then… It all came flooding back.
This is only the beginning
she murmured right in his ear.
Clint knew that line of thought and self blame and it was dangerous.
WARNINGS: mentions of alcoholism, physical abuse, mental abuse, severe illness, false memories, and spooky ghosts
Clint agreed.
he said as he whipped out his phone, thumbs flying across the keyboard as he texted his chauffeur,
The figure looked up, her hoodie falling back to reveal a teenage girl, probably of some mix of asian descent, with her hair in high pigtails. She made no move towards the car, but watched him from afar. Her head tilted slightly. Tony guessed, in fairness, it probably wasn’t in a teenage girl’s best interest to get into strange men’s cars without a little hesitation. He wondered if she had a cell phone, and why she hadn’t called for help, though they were on a country road in the middle of nowhere. Non-Stark phones probably didn’t have signal out here.
Kroshka = a Russian term of endearment, although the literal translation is something like 'little crumb'
Amora eyed the matching medallions dubiously, each dangling from a thin chain necklace..
Tony threw him a lopsided smile. He would love that to happen.
The battle was not going well. Whatever Victor von Doom’s newest update to the doombots was, they were proving much sturdier than usual. It’d be fine if there weren’t so many. Each Avenger was swarmed with bots, trying to fight off several at a time just to survive. Doctor Doom himself was using the distraction to set up a scary-looking weapon that would probably destroy New York or something. Hulk and Thor were fairing a little better than the others, but Hulk needing to stop and fight his body’s attempts to morph back. Apparently an unrested Bruce could not hold Hulk form well. It made sense.
Tony said quietly. J knew to call in the others for a code green. Hulk could do a lot of damage quickly, and the suit was often not enough to subdue him. He raised his right hand, shooting a weak repulsor directly at Hulk’s face. The more Iron Man could piss him off, the easier it’d be to lure him away from the valuable evidence they had collected.
he asked right out.
Krupp called out,
Tony took the information in. He hadn’t really read the situation incorrectly, just hadn’t accounted for the ability to drain a body instead of just tech. The whole thing was just so bizarre and yet normal for his life, he felt a semi-hysterical giggle bubble out of him. Steve looked confused and a little worried. Tony was so tired.
Steve relayed the information.
Bruce let out a soft hmm, not looking at his friend anymore. He muttered under his breath, but Tony couldn’t make it out.
She smiled like she was holding back a laugh.
Steve laughed at Tony on morphine.
He closed his eyes and rested his head back on the wall.
her voice sounded far away, but when Clint looked over at the medium, her mouth was the one moving.
Thor said slowly.
Tony blinked away the fog on his mind. It was happening more and more, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could hide it. His brain was short circuiting or something, he would be doing one thing, his thoughts would get all jumbled and stop making sense, then he’d snap back to normal as though nothing had happened. It scared him. What use was he to anyone if not a genius?
Clint ventured.
JARVIS sounded genuinely grateful. Tony was surrounded by people, and AIs, that cared so much. If only he could convince himself that he deserved it.
Bruce asked.
Clint asked, pulling out a notepad and pen.
Murdock spoke loudly and clearly. Jessica described the night. The jury audibly gasped when she talked about the screams of Mr. Marcus through the coffin lid. Murdock nodded, pacing back and forth thoughtfully as though this weren’t the thousandth time he’s heard her testimony. Court could be such a rehearsed play.
Phil said.
he rasped, looking up at the worried blond.
Tony muttered bitterly as they entered the penthouse from the elevator.
he ground out at the others. Hulk had to fight himself for a moment, turning back into Bruce to fit through the slowly shrinking portal. With him through, all that was left was him and Strange. They were both balancing against each other at this point.
Clint waltzed into the kitchen cheerfully. He poured himself a mug of coffee while he took in Steve, Natasha, and Bruce who were already seated there. He couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped his lips. Their tired looks reminded him of when he had first lost his hearing. People didn’t realize that they actually liked some level of noise. True silence could be disconcerting when you weren’t used to it. He had been entirely unable to sleep without his hearing aids in the first night, which his doctor had expressly advised against.
Steve shouted. The argument wasn’t a new one, and his patience was beginning to wear thin. He understands that Tony’s heart is in the right place, but the genius was not hearing his words.
Phil watched the debacle, amused. It took the genius and embarrassingly long amount of time to notice him sitting there at the bar.
Steve glanced over to see what Tony was talking about. Sure enough, there was someone leaning out and watching the scene unfold, and Steve couldn’t blame the caller who had called the man a scarecrow. The costume certainly looked like a classic horror movie scarecrow.
Tony drifted off to the amber honey tones of Steve’s singing. Maybe there were some upsides to camping, not that he’d admit it out loud.
The man fired and an EMP hit Tony, shutting down the suit and the arc reactor immediately. The searing pain ripped through his chest as the shrapnel started moving again.
Steve laughed. Peter was blushing now, but happy the night had turned around again. They ate and talked, and Tony played catch the grapes with Peter while Steve judged. It was a good night. Tony decided he should look into more astronomy excuses to take his family on night time picnics. Getting away from the tower was good for them.
Steve squeezed Tony’s other hand in his lap.
Tony let himself be led away, looking back at Steve with his face frozen in shock. Steve only smiled at them.
The guard turned around, surprised.
Tony had not joined him in bed for weeks. Steve knew there was a couch in his lab that he often crashed on, and that it was October, but every time he asked JARVIS what Tony was up to, the answer was always that he was working. Not once had it been sleeping. Plus Tony wasn’t showing any of the signs of stress he usually did this time of year; the genius seemed
Steve blushed, embarrassed.
As they landed the jet, everyone waited tensely for JARVIS’ results.
He dove low to avoid more blasts and fired another missile. They were finally on 19th.
Natasha flipped him off while Steve only nodded. Bruce hadn’t seen Clint sign, so he looked back and forth confused by Natasha and Steve’s responses. I MISS SOMETHING? He asked.
He hissed. Sitting back from his crouch and recasing the reactor, Tony met Clint’s stare with a satisfied grin.
Frank thought, staring, frozen. Except he wasn’t waking up. He wasn’t sure when he had begun running for the house, but he came back to a semblance of awareness when someone grabbed hold of him and held him back with strong arms.
Steve calmed him.
Dracula grinned, all teeth and glinting fangs. The growing rumble of his laughter echoed around Steve. The fear that filled him was the instinctual panic of cornered prey. Dracula was a blur as he suddenly lurched forward and grabbed hold of Steve.
He had never been good at comforting. Bruce cleared his throat and shook his head, unable to say anything. Strange took that as his cue to move on to Natasha.
If reading about claustrophobia-inducing scenarios or description of asphyxia is a trigger for you, be warned. I'd skip this chapter. Have fun readers!
Steve ran a hand through Tony’s sweat soaked locks.
he explained softly.
His voice sounded small. He was glad the fire had died down enough that Steve probably couldn’t see him blushing.
The workout helped. Steve felt like a tightly coiled spring ready to burst upwards after the conversation this morning, and he would rather get the energy out productively than exploding at Tony. He was beginning to come to terms with the fact that Tony truly didn’t understand the issue with these things. The genius was so used to being on his own and barely cared about his own body, that he honestly thought it would be a useless bother to tell his family. Tony didn’t mean to starve himself for days, or hurt himself carelessly in the lab; he just truly didn’t care about his own body. He had said something once about it being just a vehicle for the mind. It didn’t matter how many times Steve told him that said mind would cease if said vehicle died, it just didn’t stick. Steve was trying to accept these flaws as just part of who Tony was, and he loved all of Tony, even the parts he didn’t like.
Thor responded confidently.
if you are curious enough to want a continuation of this one, I'm considering taking this and chapter 4 and making a whole separate fic, so let me know. There isn't a nice wrap up ending to the dilemma in this, because there's just no time for it.
Tony grimaced but said nothing.
his voice confident.
Steve chuckled a little as well, pulling Tony down with him to lie down.
His expression was pained as the bed moved up, but Tony didn’t make a sound.
Steve shrugged.
Tony said seriously.
Clint was the first to protest,
she asked Thor.
The redhead leaned down, placing a kiss on Peter’s forehead.
Steve sighed.
Tony spoke, voice strained and he was clenching his jaw hard.
He pointed at the two of them accusingly.
she sounded tired too.
He snapped his fingers, and the team was back in the kitchen.
It came out too harsh. Tony felt like he was going to burst, this was stupid, everything was stupid. So he never played any games as a kid, so what? The stares he was getting reminded him too much of the stares of the other kids at school. The way people whispered to each other, or spoke loudly deliberately, about what a freak he was.
She nodded, already taking notes.
he admitted.
Tony looked at Steve in shock. This was so out of the blue, but to be honest, why weren't they married yet? Tony could see the wedding in his mind now, it'd be awesome. He'd have to get Pepper planning right away and he's so going to make Rhodey wear the suit as best man. There will be fireworks and…
Tony was a disaster. Steve slid into the chair beside the bed and took in the sight. He was covered in bandages nearly everywhere except his head. He had a breathing tube and multiple IVs, one of which was giving him blood. There was also a tube sticking out of his right rib cage. Steve idly wondered how much blood Tony had lost. His legs were both broken, his left forearm was broken, and Steve could only assume every one of his fingers on his left hand given the way the cast extended all the way down. Steve heard his own choked gasp before he noticed the tears streaming down his cheeks. Why? Why did he have to love someone with so many powerful enemies?
his voice was sharp, more so than he intended. He gave Phil one last look with the faith that Phil understood, that he wasn’t angry. Phil nodded and Clint practically ran, his fingers itching for his arrows.
Fury looked at him with a piercing glare.
he said over the comm,
was all he said, stepping forward to approach the only one left.
Dr. Strange explained.
look, and it wasn’t helping. The one that said ‘oh, poor Tony, the freak.’ This was his family of freaks, he wasn’t supposed to feel like this here. He thought this group was finally a place he could feel like he always belonged.
Tony tried to order his thoughts.
Everyone was still watching him like he had grown a second head. He squirmed uncomfortably in Steve’s lap.
bend the rules, Wade Wilson was the man for the job. He wasn’t sure why he could, Peter was usually such a stickler for rules, but when Wade set them on a path of mischief, it always resulted in laughter and a good time. Plus there was something extra fun about having a shared secret they could allude to later.
Steve let go, immediately feeling the chill of no longer touching Tony, and went to get the baklava. Everything in his life was going so well. He finally had Tony to himself, after all that time where neither of them could admit to their feelings. He had a family in this era that cared about him. Coulson was back, so that grief was no longer hanging over all of their heads. He and Clint seemed happy, Bruce was no longer acting like he didn’t belong, Natasha actually joined them for movie nights, and Thor lived here on and off when he wasn’t off with
and he needed Tony. Tony was home and everything he loved about the 21st century.
Clint shrugged. It was something he had definitely thought about, but he preferred to deal with problems as they came. Tony was the one always stuck in the possible futures.
Iron Man played the footage again inside his helmet.
Nathan Dolly practiced for years. It was not easy to mold a wax doll into a real person’s likeness on the spot, but by the time he took on the alias of Mr. Doll? He could do it in 10-15 seconds flat, depending on the details required for that person. That skill was not easily gained, it took hard work. So, when he began using his hard-earned skill to torture rich people into giving him money, well, hard work had got him there!
He sounded like a stereotypical old man, but he was definitely not generic. Even in the dark, Jessica could see that his skin was off. It was a green, with some darker bluish undertones on his elbows and neck. It reminded her of a cartoon zombie. He waited another few minutes, listening to the night. He had sworn he heard someone else out here. Why anyone beside him would be out here in the middle of the night was beyond him.
is what stuck in Steve’s mind. So there was still a chance Tony could die.
Tony started.
Fury stood and started pacing.
Tony threw his hands up.
she spat.
Bruce chuckled darkly.
Vision shouted.
I think we all needed a break from the seriousness I fall into with these prompts. So here's a nice little fun one, where they just play a game. I thought about getting into the Marvel Zombies universes, but really, it's far too big a project for the one-shots these are supposed to be. And if the mechanics for the game are at all unclear, let me know. It's hard to tell if something is explained well when everyone you know has played it growing up.
he pointed at the door vaguely.
Tony slumped further in obvious relief.
Strange was such a strange man, Steve decided, no pun intended. He nodded and followed the sorcerer when Strange twirled around in a flourish, his cape billowing, walking off at a brisk pace.
The archer raised both eyebrows in disbelief, the hint of laughter there.
Tony realized where he was as he felt himself stop seizing. Since when did he have seizures? No, that’s not right, it had to be because of something the Mandarin was doing. He tried to think about the last thing he remembered but there was him in the chair with the tatters left of his shirt, and now he was on the ground, everything in between was blurry and didn’t make any sense. If he tried to think about it too hard, pain seared through his head. He tried to settle onto his back, but the burns were too raw, and he arched his back up with a hiss of pain.
Clint got that mischievous glint to his eyes that Tony had learned to be wary of. You’ll regret calling my weaponry primitive by the end of this weekend, mark my words.
Bruce had to think through JARVIS’ lessons for a moment to understand what Clint was saying. He remembered that there was one sign that meant either ‘suppose’ or ‘what if’ depending on the context. There were actually a lot of signs that had multiple meanings. There had been a whole lesson on just those signs. Bruce signed YES in response to the question.
Tony had jumped backwards, just out of reach of the stranger. Whatever the man had done, he was clearly more healed than he had been a moment prior. If draining energy from tech helped him heal faster, Tony couldn’t quite blame the man for using up the arc reactors, especially with how injured he must’ve been when he appeared there. The question remained as to whether this man had come on purpose, or even knew where he was. It was very possible that he had merely teleported to the best spot for sources of energy.
Steve had opened his mouth to reply, when the sound of the door opening drew everyone’s attention. A woman was standing there, clearly the doctor, taking in the scene before her with a raised brow.
JARVIS tried to speak reason, but Tony’s pupils were blown wide and he showed no indication of hearing JARVIS.
Tony smirked.
There was a beat before JARVIS responded,
Happy said with false cheer when Steve opened the car door. Happy of course brought one of the vans because he thinks of everything. Tony was pretty sure only he could hear the worry and relief laced through Happy’s voice.
Steve warned. He was well aware of Tony’s bad habit of pretending he was fine when he wasn’t.
he felt at a loss for words. He had never mentioned his love for Marian Anderson before.
Phil looked over at Steve. They were probably feeling similarly, and an empathetic friend could do them both some good right now.
Steve noticed the lack of details and the time delay between Tony going to bed and JARVIS’ notification, but he wasn’t about to question JARVIS. He was probably just doing what Tony wanted, because Tony obviously didn’t want to see or talk to Steve. He tried not to let that sting, but it did.
And he didn’t need to look so offended at being helped.
Peter scooted his butt off the couch, surprising the the woman with a hug.
they all said in unison.
Steve reached out to clasp his lovers’ hands.
Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony knew what he was asking for. But he couldn’t very well leave MODOK running amuck, could he? Once they took care of the threat, he could be taken care of. And if it was too late? Well, the others could get on without him, he left all his money to Pepper with the instructions to manage the Avengers. Steve would be angry, but he’d deal eventually… Tony hoped.
He stood to face the crew. If only Peter weren’t here, he’d make something meaningless up. But everyone had been so honest, and his son deserved the truth from him.
Phil came into the kitchen to find his partner smiling to himself around a cup of coffee. Phil hugged the archer, letting Clint tip some of his coffee into Phil’s mouth. He watched Clint carefully, trying to read what the man was thinking about, before he snagged a kiss and pulled away. He began making their usual breakfast. Clint and Phil had found their preferred combination of breakfast foods years ago while stuck in a safehouse together for months, and the two had an unspoken agreement to alternate days making breakfast. Natasha said that the breakfast thing was when they started officially dating, though Clint hadn’t confessed his feelings until three months after that mission.
an ally. Norman was ruthless and had apparently, lost it. So here Tony was, contemplating the possibility of an October curse, strapped to a metal table with Osborn menacing above him. He had no idea where this room was in the world, but he doubted it was on Oscorp premises or he’d have been rescued by now. Norman had taken him right in front of the Avengers.
Peter nodded.
he whispered in Steve’s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.
he said dreamily.
Bruce asked from the hallway. He had stopped in his tracks when what Tony had said sunk in.
Steve said, though actually meaning new in this time period,
Tony murmured.
Huh, weird.
Tony shot him an amused look.
When she stopped,
she answered sharply.
In front of them stood a being Steve could only assume was Mephisto. The man was crimson, and wore a cloak not dissimilar to Strange’s Cloak of Levitation. His boots were a slightly darker red than his own skin, along with pants that had some sort of long loin cloth attached to them. The pointed ears and deep widows peak reminded Clint of one of the elves from Lord of the Rings.
The reporters nearby had clearly not been prepared for such well thought out responses, and there was a small wave of confusion.
Clint nestled into Phil’s side with a contented purr. JARVIS and Steve would keep Tony safe for the rest of the night.
Thor asked. At the blank look he received from everyone,
The Avengers had been gathered into the movie room to watch whatever Tony was demanding they watch. Everyone had already finished scolding the man for coming back from simple camping all banged up. The previous evening’s dinner had consisted of a series of lectures, followed by a hilariously flustered Tony finding out that yes, Tony Talks were a thing. He had fled the scene then, spending the night in his lab reviewing footage from their night vision goggles.
Tony nodded, unable to look away from the glowing red.
he broke on a small sob,
Tony had no such luck. Steve was nearly as stubborn as he was.
Steve played the drive several more times. He didn’t have a choice in whether or not to tell the others. He had watched the video in the tower; if he didn’t tell anyone, JARVIS definitely would. No, everyone was about to know when he called them to the meeting. He did, however, have a choice on how to handle this. If he ordered the Avengers to stand down and let him go alone, they would argue, but they would ultimately follow his orders. They trusted him like that. Tony trusted him. He paused the video as Tony was being strangled, eyes wide and staring into the camera. Steve saw the fear clearly, but also a hard, stubborn look that was purely Tony.
He hissed as she touched the wound, but she ignored him.
he trailed off, looking a little more grim. Steve waited to hear the rest but Strange must have decided not to say whatever it was. Steve sighed in relief as he felt warmth slowly wash over him from head to toe and he could finally stop shivering.
Tony heard the lab doors slide open and knew it was Bruce from the sound of his gait. He continues to fiddle with the calculations in front of him for temperature detecting contact lenses, his new idea for Natasha. He figured if Bruce started lecturing him, he could just ignore him, or throw something at him. He did not expect a glass of ice water to appear at his side; only at the sight of it did he realize how thirsty he was. He snatched it up, quickly gulping down half of it before he remembered breathing was necessary and he had to gasp for air.
The walk to the ship was taking longer than Tony had hoped. Every step hurt, especially in his side, which the pain seemed to be spreading worryingly. At first, the pain had been pretty localized to the middle of his left side, but it was slowly becoming his entire left side, abdomen through chest. As breathing became painful, he had to consciously make sure he was still taking deep breaths instead of the shallow ones that hurt less. While the wounds weren’t bleeding externally, he was definitely bleeding internally, and he silently commanded JARVIS to use some of the suits power to walk for him so he could focus on staying awake.
Also I finally figured out how I like to make Tony's override codes so that they can mean things, and hid a little joke so if you figure it out, let me know :)
She spoke conversationally, as though they were friends. Tony watched her with wide eyes, gasping when he could. He had stopped being able to produce tears a while ago. How long he had been here was impossible to determine, because for him it felt like a week.
The rest of the room exchanged glances. Loki was a perfectly logical suspect given his track record, but Thor was biased even if he claimed he trusted Loki no more than a stranger anymore.
Tony threw his head back in exasperation. He had just wanted some alone time with Steve before everyone showed up.
she huffed out a soft laugh. They sat there in a circle like that for a bit, and Clint had no idea how long it was before they heard the pop of Dr. Strange returning. They just basked in each other's quiet company while they worried for their teammates and tried not to think about how they had all kind of fallen apart in battle today. Needless to say they all had at least one more thing to fuel their nightmares.
Frank, Lisa, and Frank Jr. settled into their usual balcony seats. It had become a comfortable routine, coming for years. The children behaved, even though they got bored, and often fell asleep before the show was over. Frank had no problems taking care of the children, it didn’t matter what the other men said about him being whipped. His children were just as much his world as Maria was, and he loved to take care of them. Life seemed like a dream compared to the lonely nightmare he had been living before Maria. He couldn’t have imagined how well it would turn out. This was the matinee, so Frank knew the story already. He knew exactly when his wife should have entered the stage.
Steve thought.
He pointed to the forgotten black box Steve had dropped.
The laugh that tumbled from Steve’s lips had a slightly hysterical quality.
He pushed a sweaty strand of hair out of Steve’s face. Steve looked around and nodded, then groaned, grabbing his head.
Steve said quietly.
Strange looked around at the others, some of whom were slowly coming away from illusions, but Rogers was still frozen. He'd come back for them, Tony needed attention now.
The cave was not big. The two of them could lay curled up, but there would only be room for a small fire as well as their bodies. Tony threw his pack to the ground and watched the armour tumble out with a loud clamour.
This also references a couple Iron Man 616 events that involve Doom. Where these would fit into the timeline of this group of Avengers meeting each other is a complete mystery, so don't overthink it. They're just one-shots.
Thor boomed both over the comms and loud enough to be heard from a distance.
Tony’s eyes widened almost imperceptibly.
Fury said impatiently,
He tried to suck in a breath and he couldn't. When he tried to turn his head to see Dr. Strange approaching, his vision went blurry and white around the edges. He could only tell it was Strange because of the cape. He was vaguely aware that he was shivering, and something warm dripped from his mouth.
Tony groaned. He was openly vocal about how much he hated asking for magic users for help, it was an affront to his being. Science should always be able to reveal the answers. He sighed, opening his eyes again. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this tired without collapsing for at least an hour.
Tony ignored the projectiles, but pulled away nonetheless.
He felt a wave of desire course through him when the supersoldier stepped out. Steve was wearing a royal blue shirt with baby blue pin stripes, and a gold tie. The blue brought out his eyes beautifully, and Tony was surprised to admit the gold tie looked good. Gold fabric tended to look tacky in Tony’s opinion.
Steve smiled but it didn’t quite light up his face like it was supposed to and Tony frowned.
Steve nearly yelped with joy. The new information was almost too good to be true.
Peter gave up on doing the voice.
Ty smirked again and if Tony had the energy it’d be infuriating.
The room was silent for a moment. Tony clamored out of his chair suddenly, startling Steve.
Steve wasn’t sure how long they sat there in silence. All emotions had left him behind in the dust, and his empty shell just felt cold. Eventually, they went home to the tower, and Natasha showered him and put him to bed. Steve didn’t help or fight it, just let the spy push him through the motions. He nodded without looking at here when she told him she’d wake him for visiting hours in the morning. Darkness swallowed him.
Steve looked at him carefully, searching his face for clues to this sudden shift,
He could tell already how his body wasn’t taking the alcohol as well as usual. He was only 3 beers in and he already felt drunk. It wasn’t enough though; his thoughts still had too much clarity for comfort. Maybe if he died here of alcohol poisoning, his death would be looked at with the shame and disappointment he had earned. He’d lose Steve’s respect, and Pepper and Rhodey’s too, which would really suck. Not that JARVIS would let him drink himself to death, override codes or not. He had a knack of finding loopholes in Tony’s commands when Tony was doing something
Tony threw the last piece of armour at the nearest tree trunk to emphasize the last word.
The tinder on top of the base, surrounded by the other logs above and beside, was not lighting the way it should. Clint had already dragged back a mule deer and was nearly finished skinning the giant buck, and Tony’s perfect setup wouldn’t light. He had read plenty on camping, used to do it with JARVIS even, Tony knew how to start a fire, damnit. The problem was that everything was damp. He hadn’t noticed it on the hike here, but it must’ve rained recently. That damn hawkeyed archer had probably noticed it and that’s why he was so confident in the bet. Tony narrowed his eyes in concentration, Clint was forgetting that he was a genius. He’d solve this.
Agent Coulson was looking down at Tony from behind the kneeling Captain. Tony saw the gratefulness in the man’s eyes and it had all been worth it. He was on a stretcher and Steve wasn’t pulled away. Tony finally let his eyes slide shut, and the world went black.
Tony nodded in agreement, before signing something to JARVIS. Steve didn’t recognize any of the signs, but he supposed he had never learned any technical terms in sign language because he had no need for them. It wasn’t so different from the usual not being able to understand half of what Tony said. It came with the territory of loving a genius.
Phil answered before Strange could,
The minion left Tony’s line of sight, and he gasped for breath when his throat was released.
he pointed to his temple.
he finished weakly. At this point he just had to focus on breathing and staying alive.
Steve kissed him again, more chaste this time.
He hated hospitals almost as much as caves.
Tony thought about that, realizing he had never spent this much time with just Clint before. What if they got sick of each other? What did Clint like to do? Tony assumed he probably enjoyed shooting things, knew he enjoyed video games but that wasn’t really possible out here…
Tony forced his voice to sound more calm with each word.
He was starting to get dizzy from the blood loss. Strangely, he sort of hoped one of the bullets was still in him, if only because he wanted to know what alien metal could pierce the armor so easily. The first hit had been to his side, and he changed fighting strategy immediately, since he actually had to avoid bullets for once. His mysterious teammate was confined to the ground, so he provided air support, plus he could maneuver and avoid bullets easier while airborne.
He shouted angrily. He was scared and tired, his feet hurt, and he just wanted to go home.
Tony rubbed at his head. Thor laughed his booming laugh. The sound always felt too loud in the enclosed kitchen, or indoors in general, really. Tony tried to hide the fact that it startled him by jumping up for more coffee.
