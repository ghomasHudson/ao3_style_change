The spaceship rocks heavily again, the metal frame that he’s using to anchor himself peeling back with a loud squeak. Okay, well his options are definitely running thin, but he has to get out of here, that’s for sure.
“Fuck, you’re gorgeous.” Tony groaned, trailing his hand over the perfectly etched marble of Steve’s abs.
Heart stuttering in his chest, Steve grabbed at it instantly, eagerly scanning through his notifications.
Steve laughed. “Big mess indeed. C'mon, let’s get this cleaned up.”
Tony picked out a bottle 20 year old Talisker whiskey, pouring himself a two finger shot into a rounded glass and brought the drink to his lips.
“You know, everyone seems to think we're dating “ Steve blurts out suddenly, the confession coming out of nowhere and completely catching the billionaire of guard. “And I was thinking, if you maybe want to go out sometime? For dinner maybe, or a movie.” He adds, his tone almost shy.
Steve smiles and leans in to give him one more fleeting kiss before getting off of him, heading across the room to grab his shirt.
“I'll send you the contract tonight, but don't feel like you're obligated to sign it. If the terms make you uncomfortable – even just a little bit -- feel free to decline. It’s not a big deal.”
“Just finished some training rounds with the others, I thought maybe you might want to go grab coffee or something?”
“Things will get better soon.” He promised, reaching over to give Bucky a clap on his shoulder. “You’ll see. We'll get you one of those fancy, cybernetic arms. You’ll be just like Robo-cop.” He said, trying to lighten the mood.
Once they were through the door, Steve aggressively shoved the older man back onto the bed, quickly stripping off his shirt and tossed it with a flick of his wrist before joining him, straddling his thighs.
“Yeah, I know who you are. You’re that new meat that’s got Stark wetting his panties.” He sneers, shaking his head. “First they stick me with that damn Parker kid, now they expect me to work with some pretty boy?”
While Tony’s engrossed in his phone call Steve lowers himself down in front of Tony's chair, sliding his palms from the brunet's knees and up thighs. That gets his attention, but he still doesn't say a word to Steve, just shooting him a curious glance. There's some chatter on the other end of the phone line and suddenly Tony snaps up straight.
“Just eat your spaghetti.” Steve retorted, retreating to his bedroom and shut the door behind him.
The two men gave each other one last fleeting glance before Steve rolled off of Tony, helping the older man up to his feet. He cleared his throat and brushed himself off, picking at a few specks of glass that had embedded themselves in the industrial microfibers and Kevlar of his suit.
“I told you that I wanted to get to know you better.” He replied, ignoring the bored tone interlacing the other man’s words.
Tony considered himself an expert on decoding the subtle intricacies of flirting, but somehow having Steve literally spell it out to him that he wanted to date him was the part he had trouble wrapping his brain around. Steve was righteous, chivalrous, and generally a good guy. Sure, he had a few hang ups. As much as people liked to think Steve Rogers was perfect, he was a bit rash and stubborn when he wanted to be, but on the flawless scale Steve surpassed him by a mile.
"Nothing that kills you. Just a little something to ease you up. Get you to relax a little bit, huh?" Steve was fuming with anger, his teeth clenched.
He could never kill that man.
"Hey Tony- Tony-" Steves voice was weak.
T’Challa even provided a jet for him that flew him to Russia. He took a few trains, had a few minor panic attacks because he thought he was being recognized. But he eventually made it to Moscow, a backpack slung around his shoulders, a cap pulled down deep in his face that was now covered by a little bit of stubble and full, longer hair.
Tony didn’t budge "What was he even doing to you?"
"You and I both know very well that you could hand Rogers over any time but you choose not to because of what?" Ross asks and his eyebrows quirk up in amusement.
Then again, what would be so bad about being taken into custody and thrown somewhere dark and cold. He probably deserved it.
It broke his heart.
"Friday?" He whispered.
He was barely aware of the fact that he could breathe now before he coughed, retched and spluttered and spat.
"Steve!"
"What-" Tony said worriedly and Steve almost keened as he felt Tonys and not a strangers fingers card through his hair and cup his face.
Tony gave him another nod, looking him over one last time.
His vision went blurry and darker as he felt the power leaving his neck that was pushing up against the hand.
"I want to make it up to you. I owe you. And sometimes it feels like I can make it up to you, like I can still save this but then-" He gasped for breath. "Then you say my name and I realize that you deserve better. You deserve a family and a life without difficulties. All I do is ruin your life." Steve was practically sobbing by now.
Steve watched them leave one by one. First, it was Clint. Then it was Scott and finally Sam walked up to him, apologized over and over again for leaving him until Steve ordered him to just go home.
"Tell me Stark, why again are you here? Weren’t you the one who said Steve Rogers could kiss your ass and rot in a cell for all he’s worth?" Clint spat and Tony could hear his anger talking. He had his reasons.
"Really? You got a few old yoga mats down there or wait, I’m sorry - pilates mats, right?" Tony muttered and came to a halt in front of his lab.
"Sir, I recorded the conversation. I analyzed the voice. The man is 39 years old, his name is Sasha Kapirov, he is a former Hydra agent but reportedly died when the three heli-carriers crashed down." The AI stated.
"What did they give you? Did they drug you? Did they poison you?!"
His hands were sweaty and shivering when he picked up the call. There was dead silence on the other line, he kept the phone close to his ear. He said nothing, just listened.
"Don’t worry about us. We’re going to be okay."
Tony could see his eyebrows drawing together in concern, his mouth moving, saying something like "Hey, hey!".
"BECAUSE- wait what?" Tony stopped his speech.
Tony stopped in his track when he heard a loud scream echoing through the corridor. Natashas and Clints eyes met. Then Natashas eyes snapped back to Tony, her eyes wide with horror. That was Steves voice. It sounded wrecked and horrible. God, what did they do to him?
He just heard a chuckle.
But now that he was actually facing Steve,  seeing him laying there as pale as the sheets over him, looking up at hims with eyes full of hurt and guilt, he couldn’t do it. He couldn’t say that. He couldn’t.
"How was the mission?" She asked and he let out a gasp. "You know about the mission?!" He hissed in surprise.
"It’s not your fault that you were kidnapped. Did you know that they had my Doppelgänger eat a Wiener Schnitzel in Moscow?! How weird is that. He really looked like me. You fell for it. They kidnapped you. Not your fault, Rogers."
The shrill sound of a ringtone made Tony jump.
"Talk." The man said and without warning, the scalpel was driven deep into his side again, making him scream out in pain "YOU SICK FUCK-". Repeatedly, it was pulled out and slammed back inside. "AHHH-" Steves eyes watered, sweat was dripping down his face. His chest was heaving, his teeth clamping down on each other.
Tony.
"Ok give me a map on the area."
Tony shook his head in disgust.
Where the hell was Tony???
But this, this was different.
Okhotny Ryad 2, Tverskoy, Moscoe. That was the adress of Tonys hotel. He noticed the stairs that he had seen Tonys frame walking on in the news and the doors his bodyguards had pushed open for him.
"Are you sure you are okay, Cap?"
He HAD to be dreaming.
Tony gave him a curt nod. He didn’t want to make Steve any more uncomfortable than he already was around him. "I’ll leave you to yourself. I’ll just go outside 'nd let you... sleep."
"See, your friends life isn’t worth as much as you think, Mr. Stark. In fact, he’s completely useless. Fucking pussy. All the time he’s saying Tony, Tony, Tony as if thats going to help him." Tonys heart softened, his eyes fluttered closed. Oh Steve.
"Steve, you can’t just sit there and - do nothing!" Clint shouted, Steve could see the fury in his eyes, the exhaustion. But more than all that, he saw longing. For his kids, his family.
"No, no, no, no-"
He was sitting straight again as he came to.
"And you know who else you’re hiding from?"
Tell me. Or I’ll walk away.
"God, what did they do to you." He heard and Steve couldn’t trust himself as he recognized the voice. He’d recognize it anywhere.
Soon, Steve was the only one sitting in the Wakandan kitchen. He felt lonely. It wasn’t a good feeling but it was all he deserved.
"Come on!" He hissed and pinched the bridge of his nose, rubbed his face between his hands and shook his head.
How could Friday not know something. Friday knew everything.
"Good morning, boss." Friday chirped when Tony entered the lab, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.
He was at a point where nothin could shock him anymore. Or so he thought.
"It’s shit. That’s what it is." Those were the last words Clint said before he left the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind him. He wasn’t wrong.
GUYS its happening.
"So typical."
He ran up to his desk and took out the flip phone that was laying on top of it, quickly typing a message and waiting a few seconds before he hit send.
On the hologram the video feed pulled up and Tony was met with flickering camera footage.
He stood at his desk, his back facing her, as he pulled out his favorite gin from the bottom drawer.
He hated it.
It was going to happen and he couldn’t do anything but just take it. He cried, actually cried and let his head hang low. It was going to happen and he would have to take it all alone. Nobody would be there. And after that they would probably kill him. That’s what the man said on the phone to Tony. They were going to kill him and he thought back to all the things he should have done before this.
"You look like a mess." He said and Steve looked down on himself, black and blue bruises meeting his eyes as well as the still bleeding side from where the scalpel had been. The skin around the knifes in his thighs had already started to heal and Steve cringed at the thought of having them pulled out.
I love me some angst with a happy ending :))) Hope you enjoyed it thank you for reading my people 🥰
Don’t bullshit me Rogers, did you know?
"I’m not sure but then he... then he wanted to... to... but then you guys were there. He just touched me-" His stomach felt like it was going to turn. Tony saw him fidgeting with the sheets.
"I took out the four guards in front of the entry. The hall is empty and leads down to somewhere I don’t even wanna know."
Sam had done enough for him. He couldn’t expect the man to give up his home for him too. Sam was a good guy. He wouldn’t even think about telling Sam how much he needed him here.
Steve had enough.
Shit.
Probably never.
He met T‘Challa in his office. Steve thanked him for letting him and his team stay here. He also thanked him for taking Bucky under his wing but the man just shook off Steves expressions of gratitude because "It was the least I could do for you and your friends."
"Call him." She whispers and Steves eyes fall closed, he bites his lips to prevent a broken sob from spilling. "Nat, I can’t."
"Am I a joke to you?" He whispered and shook his head as if offended.
"He will be hanging from the sky like a doll strung up high." Steve had to let out a weak laugh since that was one hell of a rhyme. "You guys couldn’t find better wording? I thought this was the home of Tolstoi-" He spat and prepared for a swing to his left cheek again but instead a heavy punch landed on his stomach, knuckles like steel penetrating his insides, making him choke.
"Partially. Was my fault too. And Rogers?" Steve seemed like he had zoned out, his eyes unfocused, glassy, hooded.
"Romanoff" it said and Steve let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding.
"Yeah, that guy."
Maybe that was all and Steve would laugh at his weird text.
And then he pulled them out.
But he didn’t.
Tony was listening to it all, gathering every sound in the background, every hint Steve could have given him. Tolstoi- who the hell was Tolstoi?!
"No. Okay? That was not your fault, get it through your head!" He said very fiercely now and Steve remained silent. Tony was probably right. He hoped Tony was right.
The only thing he was proud of, was the fact that he hadn’t said the words that his captor wanted him to. It was the only thing that kept him going. To know that he was stronger than that.
"Nat I-"
Before he realized what was happening to him, there was a long, cold rod put into his drooling, open mouth.
"It’s okay, I’m fine." Steve panted.
"But-"
"Say yes, Sir." The man smiled expectantly and Steve looked up at him with wide eyes. He couldn’t be serious.
"Sir required you to leave your baggage outside." She stated as a matter of factly and Steve hesitantly did as he was told.
Steve looked at him with a certain glimmer in his eyes. "You had me on surveillance?"
"You screwed up, Steve! We all did! You can’t just sit there like a total idiot..." Steve didn’t even think of defending himself. He deserved it.
"Aren’t you gonna talk?"
Like he was thinking 'why am I here again'.
The final thought came up when he was watching the news and saw him. Tony.
His phone rang.
Tony looked at him, his eye made a little twitch as he stood up and walked to the front of the bed. "Okay, let’s try that again. How do you really feel?"
———————
The only difference was that Steves was made of metal and his of wood.
"Which is why you’re going to give us the information we need. If you don’t-" a soft whimper escaped Steves lips and he cursed himself for it. The scalpel was digging more and more into his side, tearing at his skin whenever he took a breath. It stung and stung and stung.
Steve snapped out of his thoughts.
"You can make it stop. Just say the words." Steve realized he had thought out loud. He shook his head, a wrenching sound close to a sob came out of his mouth as his head was pushed under water again.
Tony was
"He is a writer and was born in Yasnaya Polyana where he grew up-"
The guy wasn’t going to pull them out, he was going to leave them there and let his skin heal around them.
Later?
Maybe he believed him, maybe he didn’t but that wasn’t Tonys problem. He couldn’t do anything about it.
Steve had hoped to NOT have this conversation.
"Tony Stark." The man said, a smirk playing on his lips and Steves eyes were now trained to the floor.
"I’m sorry, I-"
"Ok, we’re coming to you. Nat, you go with him. I’ll be there in no time." Tony flew to the back door. "Sam, how many are there?"
"Moscow?! What does he want there?! Is he stupid?" Tony asked more himself than the man on the other line and once again a sigh could be heard.
"Where the hell is Tony? I want to see him!" He barely let the words slip when he saw the woman from the reception laying motionless on the ground. His eyes snapped back up in horror but before he could take action, a sharp sting burned at the side of his neck.
He was allowed to be angry and full of hatred. After all, the blonde had chosen his long haired, murdering pal over him. The man who killed his parents.
"Looks like its the last resort. Nearly nobody on the roof, no heat resignations on the top floors. It’s the bunker we need to get to." Sam said. His words were slightly worried. Worried as in, he didn’t want to find Steve dead.
This man didn’t have to right to call him that. He didn’t. It was just wrong.
"Yes!" Tony was a bit taken aback by Steves quick answer.
The guy with the blond hair and broad shoulders, a clenched jaw when he was nervous. With his plush lips that stood in a stark contrast to his ocean eyes and those perfect teeth.
"Where are we going, Tony?" Natasha said as she entered the jet.
"You want these out?" Hands wrapped around the knifes and wiggled them from side to side.
But the man didn’t react.
Would Tony have fired his repulsor if Bucky had not distracted him?
How could he think this way?
He broke out in a sweat as he stilled, realizing it was to no use since the restrains on his feet and hands wouldn’t budge one bit.
And at the same time it was the thing that lead to a whole bunch of nightmares. It wasn’t like he needed more of them. The opposite actually.
"Okay! Then don’t talk about it. Let’s just keep on not trusting each other. LETS JUST NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT EACH OTHER!"
"Yeah... I guess you could call it that.“
"Stop-" He begged and tugged at the restraints, whined as they didn’t move one bit and reminded him of how weak he was due to the drugs.
"I can help. What do you think happened, Stark?" T’Challa asked and Tony sighed heavily. "Whatever it is... I have a bad feeling about this. Oh and that Tony in Moscow one hundred percent isn’t me."
"Such a pretty face." The man said and trailed it down the side of his face, pressing down as it slipped over the bruises from the hits, drawing blood. Steve tensed but held still, he didn’t want that thing in his eye.
The other hand quickly jumped to his throat and pushed, pressed down hard. Steve gasped, choked and winced when a harsh thumb slid over his trachea and bore into it until hurt.
"That sick son of a bitch. I want to kill him again. How could this happen?"
He ignored the weird looks people gave him as he set his backpack down at the reception.
"I thought you..." Steves trail of thought seemed lost. His brain was fuzzy. Like someone put cotton in it. Also, there was a scalpel stuck in his side. The serum had already started healing around the wound.
He got a weak sigh as an answer. Tony smiled and the hand on Steves back stilled, wandered ho to his neck and caressed the short hair there. "My, Steve." He said.
The stark contrast between Tonys expensive outfit and Steve who was wearing nothing but a hospital gown was odd.
Feared what that meant.
"Morning Friday, anything new?" He checked his hologram, daily news and checklists, swiping through them.
"No. In fact, I think it is utterly important that you know that Tony is the reason you’re here. You really were stupid enough to come here. Pathetic." He said and the last word rung in his ears.
Hell, he deserved worse.
Tony rolled his eyes.
The man mumbled something in russian into the guards ear and Steves eyes darted back and forth between the two of them, his head still pushed back in an unnatural position.
"What do you think would Stark think of you, if he saw you like this?" Steve whimpered at the thought and tensed  when the hand sped up in its movement.
Gloves meant he wasn’t looking forward to getting his hands dirty. It meant there was going to be a reason for him to wear gloves. Steve gulped.
The next thing he felt was a harsh slap on the cheek. "We’re gonna have fun." The man said and Steve looked down, seething with anger.
"Uh." Tony put his finger right over Steves lips and maybe it was a gesture far too intimate but he didn’t care.
The man came to a stop in front of his legs and steadied himself on Steves knees. Steve nearly lost consciousness as he winced quietly.
How much he would have liked to know what exactly Tony was doing. What project he was working on. What hairstyle he had and what kind of clothes he was wearing.
He growled and looked away, jerking and shaking again but the man kept going, marking him up with words and sometimes just cuts on his arms or legs. The worst thing was that the wounds closed after a few minutes, only leaving a trail of dried blood on him. This allowed the man to start all over again. He felt like a sheet of paper that could be cut and thrown away like trash.
It was Pepper.
His eyes frantically snapped to the closed door on his right, dreading to open it and look. He became more and more uncomfortable in his sheets, fidgeting with it and craning his neck every now and then to look out of the window.
"This, my little soldier, is a scalpel. They use this in hospitals. A place you never liked." He stated and was now stood behind him, holding the small knife in front of his eyes.
"Hey." He said and sat down on the side of the bed again. His eyes focused on Tony.
He should have felt bad about the fact that Steve was suffering but he didn’t. He was glad, hell he was relieved.
"I need a drink." He finally said and he knew what look he’d find on Peppers face if he turned around now.
"Please follow me. Mr. Stark is already waiting for you." She said and now a smile was on her face, all white teeth.
With a sigh he poured himself a glass and fell down on his black leather sofa.
He just sat there in silence, his eyes tracking Clint as he walked up and down in the kitchen.
"Isn’t that obvious, Mr. Stark? He wants to visit you." The man said and maybe he was just imagining things but he was slowly losing his mind.
Now all he wanted was to get Steve out of that bastards hands.
"You should see yourself." The man said and he felt a warm hand stroking down his throat, making Steves eyes water with hatred.
Silence followed.
He couldn’t just sit back and be devastated. He had to get Steve out of this maniacs hands.
Steve looked up. It was Sam.
"Is this going to be a therapy session or what." Steve muttered and a punch came down on his jaw, he hissed.
Steve didn’t allow himself to think about the mans words. He wouldn’t fall for that strategy. Tony would be able to get him out of here. He had to. And then all of a sudden, he wasn’t so sure if Tony would come.
Maybe Steve let a few tears slip. Maybe he cried. Nobody would ever know.
"I’m fine." Steve lied. He wanted to be, but he was far from fine.
Steve just snorted.
Sweet thing. It’s what Tony always called others when they meant something to him. Pepper and sometimes even Rhodey. Or when he was talking to his robots.
Steve thanked god that Tony couldn’t see how the man next to him grabbed Steves face in his hands and hit him square across the face, then tilted his head up and did it again. And again. And again.
"Time to get these out don’t you think." Steves blood coiled at the words that were spoken with so much joy. He felt nauseous.
Tony hadn’t called him Steve in years. It felt too good to be hearing his name falling from Tonys lips.
"Oh god, Tony." Steve chuckled wholeheartedly and Tony saw the smile playing on his lips.
"Call T’Challa." He ordered and the next thing he heard was T’Challas voice greeting him with a deep "Hello Mr. Stark."
He was bleeding continuously now, his thighs covered in shining blood. Black dots appeared in front of his eyes.
"T-Tony?"
"You’re right, I'm sorry." Steve huffed out a breath. The guy just always had to apologize, didn’t he?
His head was pounding and hurt like hell. He couldn’t even move his arms and legs. It felt like they were restrained. There really were restrains around his wrists and feet, tight and digging into his skin but that wasn’t why he couldn’t move them. It was as if his muscles didn’t quite work like he ordered them to.
Ross gives him a curt nod.
"Steve-"
He wanted to sit down on a bench in front of the hotel. Maybe he should just wait for Tony to come out?
A few tears ran down his cheek and dropped into his coffee, salt mixing with bitterness.
"Don’t make me have to put you in your place again. Read, soldier. " A deep voice growled and Steve did as he was told. "Tony, you're gonna need a pen for this." Steve said and tried to sound as normal as possible but the engineer detected the sheer panic in his voice. Rogers was just playing it cool. It was bad.
"Say it."
"A ha.“ She nodded and slowly walked up to him.
"Tony-" Steve whimpered and then he was gone. And with him the only safe place Steve had here. He was cold. The ice water was swimming on his bare chest and stomach. He shook it off and immediately felt dizzy, his head pounding, blood ringing in his ears that were still full with water.
"Hello Steve." She answered, her voice rough as always.
He was surrounded by people and even more people. It was a funny feeling. Knowing that each of these people had a routine, a place to be, a string of thoughts racing through his brain.
"You piece of shit. Who the hell are you." Steve shouted and struggled against the metal again but it didn’t move one bit. He was so weak.
"Yes -wanna get out of here. Is- Is he dead?" Steve asked and Tony nodded. "Nat took him out before he..." Steve hissed under his breath before muttering "Good! That’s good."
"LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE-" Steve didn’t know what to say anymore.
"See, I knew you were going to like this." The man said and Steve began to sob, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes as his erection betrayed him and grew even bigger with each stroke.
"What did you give me?" Steve demanded and leaned forward, the muscles in his neck straining.
"Believe it or not, I’m not completely heartless. Ste- Rogers is a part of the Avengers. He always was. And we need to do everything we can to get him out of those fuckers hands." Clint gave him a  calculating look before he walked up to him and reached out his hand. "For Steve." Tony looked back at him and shook his hand. "For Steve."
"You want me to talk? I mean I have a lot to talk about. Talking about a lot. Do you know the average lifetime of a turtle-"
He shook his head. Mom would be disappointed of him. Bucky would be ashamed of him if he weren’t frozen in a freaking cryo chamber. Sam would be speechless at his amount of self destructing thoughts and Tony would be... well he probably WAS hating him.
"YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO TALK TO ME, DO YOU?! THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT! WHAT WAS I EXPECTING?! IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. LOOK AT SIBERIA-"
He wanted to see him. Hear him, talk to him and maybe let him shout at him too. He’d let him do it, he’d let Tony scream at him and scold bim, curse and shout and hit him. It would be okay and maybe just what Steve needed.
"We haven’t gotten to the best part yet." The voice said with a chuckle and he felt the mans dirty hands wrapping around his waist and Steve shook his head. "Stay away f-from me." He whispered.
"You can rest now, Steve."
Just before he lost consciousness he was pulled up by his wet hair and tossed from side to side, the water splashing to the ground and dripping down his naked chest.
"Thank you, Sam." Steve said and finally lifted his head up to meet Sams honest eyes.
"I’m intimidated. Oh. Wait I’m not. Have you looked at yourself? You can barely move. I could just reach down here." The mans voice was now going soft and Steve hated it. He despised it. The fact that this guy was actually enjoying it made him gag.
But maybe this was fate and Tony was there because it would be a good place to talk. Away from Ross and the others. Just the of them. Maybe it was sign.
"You can’t even do anything about it." He stated and pushed the stun gun down further, rubbing against his soft palate and triggering his gag reflex in the process. The blond gagged and felt tears running down his cheeks as well as snot and sweat gathering above his lip. Strikes of hair were clinging to his forehead and his lashes clumped together.
Steve had no idea what he was talking about until there was a hand on his upper thigh, sliding down to his intimate area. "GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!" He shouted with sheer terror, his voice cracking as he twisted away from the strangers touch.
He tried not to, but the pleasure eventually got too high to ignore, the tenderness of the touch felt too good and he came in his underwear. He arched his back and whined as he did so, the man stroking him through it and then leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek.
"Are you referring to Steve Rogers breaking into the bunker." She asked and Tony nodded curtly before saying "Yes. Fast forward to him facing security."
He unlocked it and saw that he had received one new message.
"Rogers, don’t read it!"
Tony felt bad now. Great.
"Fuck you." Steves eyes were watering as his throat convulsed around nothing and the strain on the roots of his hair grew.
"It’s too quiet." Steve said finally and Tonys breath hitched. "When I was down there, it was always so quiet and the only thing I ever heard was that guys voice..."
After months he finally had had a good nights sleep. No nightmares, no screaming, no blood, no death. He slept... well and that felt incredibly odd.
He felt the creaking of a door opening and the sound of footsteps entering the room Bright light shone into the darkness and Steve could make out numerous guards in the hall before the door shut again.
Dark.
"You think Stark is going to come and get you? Do you really think we actually care about the answer to those damn questions?" The mans lips quirked up.
"You forgot what it’s like if someone touches you in a nice way?" Steve nodded slowly.
Tony had texted him.
" No, we don’t." Steve growled.
He went on. "After all you’ve done to him, you think he’s going to save you? Look at you. So much weight on your shoulders." There now were hands lingering on his knees, almost caressing him.
"The fight we had WAS your fault, you idiot." That was what he had wanted to tell Cap all those times. He wanted to tell him so much more. Tell him how much he hated him and how he fucked up and ruined everything.
"I would’ve asked you for forgiveness." Steve managed and Tonys brow quirked up in interest. "Yeah? You would have begged me? On your knees and everything?" Steve laughed. "Yeah, Tony. On my knees." Tony liked the smile that spread out on the mans face.
——————
Tony hadn’t even realized he had sat down during the call.
And then, he really fell asleep.
——————
"I know." Steve said quietly.
"I thought you would leave me there and let me die. I thought I... deserved it."
"Back to last name basis, are we?" Tony said and nodded at Sam Wilson and the redhead next to him.
Sighing, he stepped towards the huge glass wall and looked outside, the Wakandan forest greeting him like every single morning.
When Steve woke up, he heard voices talking, people walking and the sound of dishes clinking. He slowly opened his eyes. Where was he? His eyes slowly began to adjust to his surroundings. The jet. They had saved him. The bunker. Tony-
"Are you out of your mind? Where have you been?" Tony asked, his voice angry and distressed. "What were you thinking, just wandering off to Russia like you don’t even care what that means for the rest of the team. For me. Do you even know-"
Tony and Steve had both lost in this battle. Looking at the big picture, Tony would say the aftermath was in his favor since Steve lost his shield and his team because he couldn’t get over his stubbornness.
And then he felt the hands wandering to the front, over his chest. "Leave me alone!" He cried out with all the power be had left because he couldn’t do this. He couldn’t let this happen to him. He didn’t want it. Not like this.
Enough.
"It’s okay. I’m going to take care of it." Steve shook his head wildly, his eyes pressed closed as he prayed for this to stop, to just be a bad dream. He struggled away from the mans hand and twisted and tugged in his restraints.
"Send the information over to Natasha, Clint and Sam. We’re going there. Change of course. Inform T’Challa too."
the phone.
The man looked him up and down, his eyes roaming over Steve like he was prey.
Just as he wanted to grip the back of the bench, a familiar tone made him stop in his tracks.
"I mean, yes. Please." Steve said with a more controlled voice this time. Tony looked down at him. Oh Steve. Why couldn’t he just ask.
After a few seconds he was twisting in the restraints again, his hands wanting to pull him away, his chest wanting to push forward and out of the water but he couldn’t.
"It’s funny because we found your flipphone in the basement. Some gross and horrible pictures were on there. So no, we have to talk about it."
When he was sitting on the edge of the bed, his feet dug into a fuzzy, curly mat underneath his feet and he relished the soothing feeling of something soft.
"I don’t give a fuck about my heartrate, tell me where Steve is." Tony shouted and slammed his fist down on the table.
"Tony-" and he heard Steves breath becoming shorter. And then they were looking at each other, the blonds eyes beginning to water. "Tony, I am so-" he shuddered. "I am so sorry-" He whimpered and Tony was helpless, was just looking at Steve while he started crying. "I’m-" Steve burried his face in his hands. And Tony was still staring at him. It was like he was frozen. He couldn’t move. What should he say???
Now his hand was slowly wandering up the blonds face. Steve jerked back and locked eyes with the man, disgust on his face. The man had a rough, black beard. His hair was black too and his chiseled chin was connected to a definded jawline. His eyes were ice cold blue, his nose sharp and his hands were covered with black gloves.
"Bring our Captain a little treat!"
"Do you want to check into your room?" She asked him and made to get some papers but Steve shook his head vehemently. "No! No, I am here for ... Mr. Stark." The womans eyes went wide.
One time there was Tony standing next to him, looking down at him with a warm and friendly smile. "Tony." Steve whispered and his eyes watered with joy.
"I know we could be better. But-" He couldn’t have this conversation right now. "Gosh, Rogers. Why do you always make everything so complicated?!" His voice had become more erratic now, helpless.
"Steve, I meant how I could let you be kidnapped. I always had you under surveillance... If I only-"
It felt good to hear a familiar voice.
He saw Steve handing Wanda over to Clint to help her out.
"When I come back were gonna start where we left off." He said and winked at him.
That was the last thing he remembered before waking up again. He had changed rooms. And clothes too.
He grabbed the phone and clutched it to his heart, cursing and hissing under his breath as he held it close and sunk his chin over it.
"You should go." Steve suddenly said. Tony didn’t want to go. He shook his head weakly. What was happening- "Cap-"
"Why not. Why the hell not, Rogers?!"
Silence followed as Steve had to calm down and put the phone on the counter, wandering around the kitchen, feeling the wooden floor beneath his feet.
Steve shook his head.
"How do you feel?" The other man asked after Steve had finished his water.
Tosha: Actually, it was vodka and not the good stuff. Probably because she drank that first. I feel like a horrible Russian.
: Nickname for friend and former chief of SI security Harold Hogan. Recently demoted due to incident in September 2016. Relationship currently very, very complicated because he is upset that Tony choose Steve over Ms. Potts despite the fact that the couple were already broken up for more than a year when Tony’s relationship began with Steve. Not to mention the fact she was already dating someone else.
Welcome to part three of the 36 questions that lead to love. I did promise Tony and Steve would get through them a lot faster than there good timeline counterparts.
Me: He wanted to nominate me for Secretary of State. If you say anybody would be a step up from Ross, I will hurt you.
HSBF: Now I do because you actually tell me stuff.
Me: I’ll be waiting for you at home base. I promise to wear something sexy.
Me: I wish I knew, but it’s really complicated. But I will say when you love somebody, even if that love is platonic, you will make very questionable decisions to keep that person safe.
Anthony: It was a program that Shield created to make life like android copies of agents to send out as cannon fodder. Allegedly, they never perfected it, but you never know. Your old boss was a professional liar.
Me: Of course not. They don’t know you are my new text message boyfriend.
Melinda: I wasn’t there when Loki stabbed Phil through the heart, but I was there six years later when he died for the second time from his injuries. You can’t change the past. If it was possible, we wouldn’t have Deke.
“That’s good. But how is he dealing with the thought of us together?” Steve asked.
Cuddle bunny: I’m not even sure I can live up to the legend of Captain America. Actually, I know I can’t. That’s why I gave you the shield. I’m just as selfish and human as everyone else.
“So, this other Leo was another victim of the snap?” Laura asked.
HSBF: What happened with Peter?
“Probably, but all of those things made Stark take a good hard look at his life and make better choices and that includes being with Steve.”
“What is your word?”
Nomad: Because he had very little decency to begin with.
“No,” Steve answered.
I was a mess when it happened and thank God I had Bucky to pick up the pieces because I wouldn’t have survived without him. I know that sounds odd considering what happened to your mom because of him or rather what Hydra made happen, but it’s the way I felt back then. Bucky was like my big brother growing up. He was the one who would always have my back. Since he always had my back in the past, I felt like I had to do the same for him. Especially, because I let him down the way I did before.
Tony: OK those are all things on my list. Although, I’ve made peace with boarding school. But I think I would’ve liked to have been told why I was sent to boarding school instead of the lies.
To be continued.
“He still hates me.”
Me: Yes. And since my official involvement has already been tweeted out in a press release, I thought I could tell you.
Me: I’ll be waiting.
Blue phone: Were they trying to bring back Red Skull?
Me: More like his therapist wants him to leave for something less stressful and Agent agrees. And it says all sorts of things where being CCO of SI and being an Avenger is less stressful than staying at Shield.
Subject: Re: Seriously, Tony! Call me!
Time sent: 11/12/2016 9:12:17
“Doctor Strange, I presume,” Leo remarked, wondering where everyone else was. He was alone with the doctor at the moment.
I didn’t get it when we first broke up. I was angry when you left me. I was too upset to even consider the fact that you may have had a valid point (especially when it comes to Steve). I thought that if I could change maybe you would come back. If I could find a way to achieve a superhero work life balance, then you would come back. There is no superhero work life balance. Not really.
Anthony love: I’m sure evil Ross’s new “think tank” is probably funded by Watchdog sympathizers doing lots of crazy shit. I can’t wait until he’s arrested for fraud.
“Agreed.”
Me: I’m equally terrified. I mean, my last serious relationship ended in tears and my stomach getting pumped. Cuddle Bunny and I are going to take things slow and work on building our relationship up as much as we can.
“That’s understandable, because if you get this done now than we can have more naked time later.” That got Tony a glare.
“I know. Friday sent me reading material. Did you get another phone?” Tony responded by holding up his watch as he typed out another message. Steve is not even surprised.
I don't know what Howard would've wanted. Our relationship wasn't that close and well, he worked on the Manhattan project. I don't know how his conscience works. Maybe he felt creating Shield balanced out all of his sins. Then again he drank like a fish so all of his sins were right there at the surface.
“Yes and no. I’m kind of dreading the rest of the set. Apparently, phase 3 is where the real intimacy begins allegedly.” Steve remarked. Tony scoffed.
Just like the last in person conversation, this begins almost immediately after the last message, meaning it’s still September 24. It is going to be September 24 for a while actually. This is going to be a big day for us in this story. Yes, May did steal Steve’s phone.
Tony Potts: We’re doing the 36 questions. For a pop psychology New York Times icebreaker activity, this thing has been getting a little deep. I need someone else to talk some of this out with. I should probably call my therapist but haven’t called her in about three years, so I probably need a new one. And my sponsor is working right now.
Me: Okay, like I did in the past which led to murder bots. He thinks you’re a good influence on me.
“Thor?” Steve asked.
“There's only one way to find out, actually talk to your not-a-wife.”
Blue phone: He had a good life though. Arnie even married his partner of 40 years in 2010 in DC after it was legal there.
Me: Coulson definitely knows that Tony and Steve are dating.
Red spider: Or Agent America’s boyfriend is your ex-boyfriend.
Director Stark: I understand. Standing by.
Person that cares about my boss: I am not sure how to take that.
HSBF: Tony, it will be okay.
Me: Do you really believe that?
Me: Come on, we’re not stupid enough to fly to Red Malibu directly. We’re planning to fly to Canada first then come in through the back. Justin has been a little more favorable towards enhanced people then his American counterparts.
“Were you only interested in me because of your job or because you wanted to do something to honor Phil’s memory?" Steve was worried that was the case. Pre-serum, nobody liked him for him outside of Bucky and Peggy. Now he’s afraid of history repeating itself except now it’s Tony and probably Sam.”
Additional editing, Research, and/or translation assistance:
Me: It shouldn’t be hard, but you know this president. Also, the guy at the ATCU is going to have to be someone who is comfortable being just a figurehead. As long as it’s not the homeland security woman or the general with the creepy daughter, I think we’ll all be okay. Actually, I wonder if that’s what the president is going to talk about tomorrow, because I doubt he’s going to actually apologize. He probably wants me to provide him possible candidates and unfortunately my number one candidate is still on the run. And Simmons definitely won’t do it.
Nomad: Yes actually. Apparently, we are well shipped in the LGTB community.
Me: What???
Counselor Laura: You’re going to have to ask Steve about that. Ask him if he has any family in Nevada.
BFF Ned: Was that actually his brother? He’s the one that killed Ms. May’s fiancé the first time, right?
Counselor Laura: Also, Friday received a bunch of files from my timeline's Shield. As the director, you probably need to look at them anyway.
The boss: Tell Pepper Pot we’ll be there in 45 minutes.
HSBF: That’s good. So, Midtown or something private?
Some of you were concerned about Friday's behavior in the last conversation. The consequences will be dealt with in this conversation. This conversation takes place very soon after Friday sends everything to Steve, but I won’t say how soon because that may give things away.
Tony: Which wouldn’t be that hard because I’m sure he wants his kids back.
Me: You’re right. No new incidents. The counselor is doing a good job of keeping me in one piece. Although, I miss Red. But she’s young and has been through so much. I feel like she deserves something normal.
Tony: Due to the red here most of the office is calling her Pepper 2.0. She doesn’t have the super speed of Yo-Yo but she has other special skills like getting me to social gatherings early.
Counselor Laura: They're not great, especially when you're in the middle of a separation/divorce. Connor is also upset because Tony and Clint want to send all the kids to Malta to get them out of the line of fire. At least the ones without superpowers. I doubt Flash and MJ are going anywhere, partially because Flash is 18, and MJ listens to no one except maybe Daisy. She’s still MIA with Thor and Loki.
The Mechanic: So you’re going to be going the rebranding route? Clever.
Me: Maybe later we can do that privately wants virtual dates, resume.
“We call it the decimation. But yes, we believe that’s what happened.”
Avenger Ana: You are no longer on the planet Earth.
Nomad: Did they hand you a list of powered people willing to work with the Accords?
HSBF: Do I want to know why the woman at the front desk is completely convinced that I’m Chris Evans checking into the hotel under a fake name?
Blue phone: Why?
Anthony: Again, Friday. She can help you too.
In the original timeline and in our timeline up to the beginning of the story, Leopold Fitz and Jemma Simmons are the textbook definition of star-crossed lovers, sometimes literally. They began the series as best friends and science partners after starting out as rivals at the Academy, but eventually transitioned to a romantic relationship over the last five years. The only problem is the universe kept screwing them over.
Tony: It’s hard to understand why people are throwing red paint on you when you’re three.
Me: Really good, although he’s mad at me being back in DC this week. Also his aunt is willing for me to foot the bill for Benji to take a few college classes during the spring semester. Normally, she won’t take charity but she considers it reparations for Germany.
Me: Nope. And apparently he’s been collaborating with Pepper Pot and they feel like Happy and I need to work on our feelings, which is why he was on my private jet when we left Manhattan last night.
Virginia: I trust you.
Tony: Him being an idiot doesn’t change the fact that he is still married to her.
Agent Barton: My Tony can’t remember everything he owns either. Even with everything in the trust until he no longer works for the federal government.
Anthony love: Of course, she did.
“Only the most recent ones.”
“I could help. I am actually the chief creative officer.” Deke told the group.
From: MJ_Watson
Agent M: There are ways to get you back.
Anthony love: Yes. How did you get that from what I just said?
Tony Potts: Is that why you haven’t texted me in like 15 minutes. I might have to talk to Steve again.
“OK. Therapy has been good for you.”
Director Snookums: So am I.
“That’s essentially what they’ve been doing with the kids with powers, right?”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful. A lot of people have asked me if Bucky would be making an appearance in this story and here we are. I hope you all enjoy it.
To: Pepper_Pot
"Yes, it gets a little less awkward each time.” Steve leans over and kisses Tony on the mouth again. “Things are awkward between you and me too but at least we can do that. I’m enjoying this. Your tongue is awesome.”
Captain tight pants: You really don't like Ross?
Girl Friday: I wasn’t trying to be.
Ana Jr.: I was able to make you a copy of all the records I downloaded from the other timeline. Since they were initially sent to you, it seems only prudent that you can access the information in a form you can process.
“You’re not going to email anyone else at Shield. You should rest.”
Captain Tight Pants: I just want to say thank you for protecting Sharon.
Captain tight pants: You know, I would still come for you if it was necessary.
Agent Laura: Why? You mentioned for before, but you didn’t give me any details.
I have to let go. I really have no choice, but to. I am dating your best friend and if I keep hating you, things with Cuddle Buddy will fall apart and I don't want it to. I don't know how I fell in love with the sanctimonious asshole, but it happened. It just did.
Girl Friday: No more in the middle of one than usual.
Nomad: Actually, she already text messaged me an hour ago. I think Friday gave her my information.
“Yes, and yes. Leo prevented the Watchdog backer from interfering with the elections, and Ellis was open to renegotiating once he was reelected. Your counterpart helped with the negotiations. Several countries including Malta, South Korea, and Wakanda backed him up.” Laura explained.
Monkey lover 2: You liked me before. Also, I am still lying to Simmons.
Also, Clint is purposely using the wrong names for his wife and children in these text messages in case they are intercepted. (Okay, my voice recognition software did it accidentally during the first Clint interlude, but I decided to use it.)
Xxxxxx
Anthony: I’m so happy that you acknowledge that. I realize I shouldn’t be angry because people deal with grief differently, but I still am even if Michelle understood and wasn’t even that upset with Sharon for not being there.
Blue phone: I told you, they all have their own agendas.
“You knew about my crush on him?” Leo asked surprise.
Cuddle Bunny: It can’t be that bad
“I know. And I think this is good for him. I think he’s found balance. He is really happy right now.”
Agent L. Barton: From my Robin. She knew that her mom and Mr. Barnes were going to get together months before they did. We chose not to tell him because he needed all the help he can get.
“But I still feel like being there is the most critical part,” Tony answered.
HSBF: I guess that’s good.
“I read that in your report, and I still find it highly implausible despite my husband having a teammate that makes my Ferrari flame,” Tony replied.
To be continued.
Me: Always. Especially because technically, this is working on Jane’s special PR project and she scares me so we’re doing this tonight. Besides, the more time I get to talk to you, the happier I am. I do less dumb shit when I’m happy.
Me: I hope so too.
Me: It’s a good felony.
“Good to know. Basically, leaving here too quickly would make things worse, especially because I have meetings for the next six hours with various world leaders. We are trying to make it look like this was always the plan anyway."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: I know, but Agent May is supposed to teach me superhero life skills.
“I slept with a married Congressional staffer. Although I didn’t realize he was married when I slept with him.” OK, that doesn’t match Tony’s Boy Scout image of Steve back then. Although the guy that took dick pics for his wife definitely would’ve made a mistake like that. Maybe it’s best for the world that Steve is currently married-ish.
Me: That’s definitely not happening in this timeline. Also, the Princess is going to help little bird. Another difference. Also, things are already really over with Bobbi romantically because I’m definitely no Pepper Potts, from the other timeline, anyway. Another difference. We’re going to keep the world from being cracked apart and maybe deal with the purple raisin she keeps drawing.
Me: Everyone did except for you apparently. How are you just realizing this now? He flirted with you all the time. We used to call you guys mom and dad.
Me: When talking about the guy who murdered my parents is the preferred subject, you know things are bad. We’re just having all sorts of breakthroughs tonight.
Cuddle Bunny: How much better?
Captain Tight Pants: They obviously don’t know you at all.
FRIDAY: Of course sir.
“I think you can leave as soon as they are sure I’m not a clone or an LMD.” He is sure they will let Fitz out soon. Leo is also sure that he’s going to be here for the foreseeable future. People who hallucinate and have conversations with their evil self don’t get released back into society. That’s been happening more and more, especially when Hunter wasn’t there. They’re all going to realize he’s completely cracked, and he’s never going to get out of this place.
Counselor Laura: Fair.
Tony: They bought that?
(See the end of the chapter for
Avenger Ana: Yes, although I am not allowed to answer your questions regarding if your wife and children survived the decimation.
This question is hard because my biological family is gone, not that it was a very big to begin with, not counting my dad’s second secret family. But my mom always made me feel like I was the most important thing in her world. Maybe I was. I always felt loved. And when she died, it hurt so much. It wasn’t sudden like what happened to your mom. She was sick for a while. It’s just I didn’t expect to lose her. I mean I was the sickly one. I was the one who was supposed to drop dead at any minute, not her. I wasn’t prepared for it.
Nomad: You’re not alone. I may be thousands of miles away, but I’m still here.
“Of course.”
Blue phone: Agent Triplett. I met him a few times before we had to shut down SHIELD because of people like his boss. He was a good kid.
“That may be possible. May said they had to completely erase themselves afterwards to stay off of Hydra’s radar,” Steve explained.
“I’m glad you realize that.”
Final notes: In some places/reference material the MCU is designated as Earth 199999. But in Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse, they played with the idea that 616 signifies the prime universe for that particular media. Initially, I was going to refer to Leo's home reality as 616, since he comes from the prime reality in this story. Therefore, his home dimension would be "616". If Dr. Strange sent him back, everything would've played out as it did in canon before all the time travel shenanigans created issues.
Me: It took three of them.
“We are all still grieving. However, we’ve learned to move forward, but Simmons hasn’t. That’s not an excuse to be so obsessed about Fitz. You're being very selfish. You even risked your own grandson.” Laura mumbles the word grandson under her breath as she continues to look on extremely confused. What the hell is going on here?
Me: But if you’re worried about how we interact as a couple, I can say that Stefan is a gentle little teddy bear. He is so afraid of bruising when we are together that he’s having me top. Eventually, I’ll convince Stefan that I am OK with sex bruises. I think I’m halfway there already.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: If we were talking face-to-face, I would be rolling my eyes at you.
Me: That explains your most recent bad choice. That’s what you get when you try to spare your baby brother from being stabbed in the back by his new father figure. I told you not to put yourself through this pain and you did it anyway. I don’t like you being hurt.
Tony: Why did I decide to make my retirement not effective until March 2017? I mean, I could be in Malta with you. At least until Afia starts school in late January. She’s doing the placement test today. Which is great, so she doesn’t have to sit through the annual remembrance ceremony for our illustrious founder.
HSBF: That’s good.
Anthony: Yes, sort of. I’m telling you right now that I will be texting you the entire time, mostly as a means to keep my sanity together.
“Finding out the truth was a lot?" Steve asked, genuinely concerned.
Me: Understandable.
Me: But the thing is, it happened because I did not provide adequate oversight. He did all those bad things because I wasn’t watching. All the blood spilt by those weapons is on me. I'm not letting that happen again.
In my version, when the monoliths explode (episode 5.11), Leo is sent through time and space with two more years to fix things and prevent the end of the world and the finger snap of doom. That’s good. What is bad is Simmons already has Fitz. Yes, I am horrible but we still have more hope than canon. Sometimes, hope is the only thing we have. Anyway, I felt that this background that will help for the next few chapters, especially this one.
The Mechanic: I’m well aware. Mostly because TMNS actually knows that you love him and I was always on the fence about Howard. At least until after my favorite aunt died and she left me his personal journals.
Me: Well as long as we both realize we’re taking the easy way out, I guess it’s okay, despite what certain new teammates may think. That’s another thing Yo-Yo said about me. Apparently I do take the easy way out too much. It’s a side effect of wealth privilege, apparently.
Red phone: You would know.
“No. But you can move forward. You can build new things once you’re ready,” She suggested.
“She says she wants details but no pictures because she doesn’t want you to accidentally post them on Instagram again.” Tony couldn’t help but snicker at that. Although if May was packing him toys and condoms, he definitely had May’s permission for a nice snuggle. Even if a part of his brain wanted to test out that toy on Steve, they were nowhere near that yet.
Me: And finally I found someone other than Laura who realizes that.
The New Consultant: Benji was busy working on a project with the princess and didn’t go to sleep until 9 AM. Benji is still unconscious. I didn’t want your text message ring tone to wake him up. He’s wearing the headphones, but you know he’s a light sleeper now.
To be continued…
Tony: It hasn’t come up. Oh, Afia would like to take your last name as well.
Tony: Really?
Cuddle Bunny: You mean Coulson?
Cuddle fiancé: So new wedding date?
Me: If you want to cultivate a friendship and eventually sleep with him when you’re both on more stable footing, then you need to at least acknowledge that to yourself. You can fill Tony in later once you’re more certain.
Football Hunter: More the reason to do it. Stark and the Princess actually suggested that maybe as my cover, I should be your husband instead of just your boyfriend. Stark really wants to fuck with these people as much as possible. The Princess set up my ID that way. Although, she offered to switch it to something else because she may have sat through at least one Bobbi rant.
Tony: Maybe she can go with Stephanie as a middle name instead.
“And I will when the time is right. You don’t have to be Stefan Carter out there tonight. Just go out there as Tony Stark’s boyfriend who loves him very much. The name doesn’t change that." Melinda suggested.
“He is a smart kid which is why you should let him decide if he wants to go public, not your PR team." Steve tells his boyfriend poignantly.
Me: But I’m not going to let that scare me off. If we only have another day, another week, or another couple of years, then I am going to take every single second of that and treasure it. I don’t want to have any regrets.
Avenger Ana: According to the archives, Thor was unwilling to talk about what happened with his sister. He lost an eye. Although he was given a prosthesis. However, Valkarie and Dr. Banner did provide a report of what happened that I have access to.
Anthony: Anything for you, Gum Drop.
Chief Mechanic: I hate it when you have a point. You already know about the alcoholism from Ana. We are going to have to look at your protocols about keeping secrets.
Monkey lover 2: I was locked up in the White Room for a little while, but I saved May, so I’m free.
Agent L. Barton: I mentioned I want to bring in a therapist. One who has an actual MD.
“According to Bobbi, it is probably best not to press for details when it comes to Hunter. Also, I really hope they don’t have to work together anytime soon. They’re not like you and Pepper.” Steve lamented.
Tony Potts: This is my meeting. I would call my sponsor, but he’s probably busy with Pepper right now. So, I decided to call other Tony’s sponsor instead.
“No, you shouldn’t have.”
Me: By Tony. We’ll talk again soon. And I know this seems weird because it's me, but I'm glad you're happy, Tony. That's all I ever wanted for you. You’re still my best friend, and I love you. It's just a different type of love now.
Anthony: Yes, but he hates it when people get in the way of the mission. It annoys him. It’s looking more and more likely that Spidey is going to powered person summer camp or rather winter break camp as they kind of can’t wait nine months for intensive training.
Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 took place in late 2014 so those events have been incorporated into the story even though nobody realized it, including me. So this is going to be a spoiler free zone for that movie. Figuring out MCU timelines is fun.
Me: I can see why you call it that. The city is insane. The best thing about the place was meeting the counselor.
TMNS: I mean about me.
Nomad: At least there are some constants. Why were you calling Zephyr one?
“I assume you are the one called Skye. I see that Lady Sif was right about you.” Loki smirked at Daisy menacingly.
FRIDAY: You were aware that there was a 92.4% probability of this occurring.
T Stark: So I got your voicemails. I realize that we need to talk about a lot of things regarding your nephew.
Tosha: And no, Laura doesn’t have her own water bottle full of alcohol. Unlike the Laura of this timeline, she didn’t relapse while we were on the run.
“Ok.” He agreed reluctantly because maybe he needed some space from all of this and possibly a very stiff drink.
When I started plotting this story, I did not realize that season five of AOS took place in a branch timeline because the agents created a new timeline when they went back through the monolith. Oops. But in my defense, neither did the AOS writers. Sometimes you have to just roll with it. They didn’t even think they were going to go past season five.
Nomad: I have a suit. You would be amazed by how much a good suit comes in handy while doing undercover.
It is. Tony called me a little while ago after Happy tried to set us up on another date. Robert was not amused. He’s on the trip with me to China because he can work from anywhere. Tony and I are going to try for lunch again on Wednesday since I hope to be back by then. I want to be his friend again too.
“Did you just refer to me as a marshmallow?" Steve asked and Tony responded with a quick kiss.
“You were unconscious, and we were trying to figure out why when we started looking through it. That is how we figured out you were from another timeline.” Steve told her which was the reason why she deleted her original message and told Stark not to block their access just yet.
Anthony: So the angle that we used to help agent 13 infiltrate the other side was her being mad at me for stealing her boyfriend.
May: My kid gets visions of it. She even warned me about the Instagram incident.
"Of course boss.” He heard Friday’s voice from Tony’s phone. “Should I also send a box of the good chocolates to Ms. Potts?"
Tony Potts: Now I'm going to push you into the world and tell you to text message you're not a husband.
Tony: Well, somebody has had a fun separation. I can see it.
“Steve mentioned asking Kamala if she would be willing to stay here over the weekend and on nights to help you with the kids. Are you open to that?” Tony asked.
CoulsonPJ: Talbot knows better, but doesn't care if it gets Captain America back on our side, the original Captain America. Honestly, he is more focused on one upping Ross at the package announcement. They really hate each other.
Blue phone: I like you.
“That’s not necessary Karen and why did I put that protocol in there?” He starting to wonder if he should spend some quality time with Karen before handing her back over to the oldest kid. He feels like there are some bugs he needs to work out.
Tony: Okay, you have a point. I guess this is something we’ll have to discuss when I get to LA tomorrow.
“You’re going to want to write a response now?” Tony asked.
“He made a deal with President Ellis to get you or rather other Steve a pardon and the accords renegotiated in exchange for taking over the agency. They just came to an agreement, and the signing was happening when I was brought over to this weird place. At least this is better than that time I got kidnapped by Ross.”
The Mechanic: I was trying to get TMNS to tell you on his own. Since you read the letter you know that I was trying to set up a safe place for that conversation Saturday.
Chief mechanic: Yes. Anyway, your current boss Madeline Rice managed to beat him and made you her VP. After she switched parties, of course. Overthrowing democracy was a dealbreaker for her.
Red phone: I’m only getting death glare 2 right now. So it’s fine. Pepper only gets really mad at me when I piss off the board or stare at my assistant’s ass a little too long.
StarkAE: I have a couple of houses there. I’ll let you live in one, rent free if you change your orders.
HSBF: How did the conversation with your James go?
Me: Which was totally a euphemism. But I also want more than just coffee.
Red phone: Because Sam saved your ass. You are not allowed to die on me.
Me: I just wish he would show back up for the dedication. Besides, it’s better this way. I prefer that any child of mine goes to public school for socialization reasons, if nothing else. I feel bad about Spidey Junior, Ms. Marvel, and the purple arrow children having to work with the tutors, but it’s for the best and at least they can socialize with each other right now.
Me: He also told me to tell you that he’ll meet you in New York to switch back. You should make sure that your part of the group meeting the Princess. He will be coming back with the delegation.
Me: They did, but they don’t know because he died. And then undied and didn’t tell anybody. Also, I think Laura is still married to Purple Arrow as far as I know. She was just saying they were divorced because Ross is a bastard and kidnapped her once to get to him.
“Talbot probably doesn’t care, especially if you autograph those comics/card for his son. Seriously, that kid idolizes you more than Coulson, if such a thing where possible.”
Tony: Yes. Eventually she will stop being mad and will stop making us do this.
The mechanic: But they may be heading over there with one of the SI UK’s lawyers to make him sign an NDA as well as agree to stay the fuck away from you, now that you have your shiny new eight-figure job with a Penthouse and your own Audi.
D Fitzsimmons: Good. Now please point me to food that isn't survival pellets or protein bars.
"I feel like I need to be there during his bad judgment calls. He always stood by me, so I need to do that for him. Besides, he did what he did because he was mad at me. That means some of this was on me." Tony explained. But Steve just shook his head.
Tony: The algorithm was wrong or possibly reversed. They should’ve consulted Robin.
Tony: Technically, I’ve known her longer. Also, Snookums needs plausible deniability.
"I'm sucking up to the president, the UN, General Talbot, the not-crazy people at the State Department, and various not-evil members of Congress to keep a highly skilled strike team from tracking you and Cuddle Bunny down and locking you up in the Raft for the rest of eternity. If I disappeared, I can guarantee that they would find us within a month and they'll probably be more bullets involved. Then diplomacy. Playing the system keeps everyone safe."
“I’m going to change this wording a little bit since we’re not complete strangers. If you were to become a close friend again with me, what‘s something you would want to tell me.”
May: Which means you won’t have to deal with this.
Tony: I don't remember if I told you this, but Pepper and I dated for a while before we slept together. We needed to transition first and so do you and me. I think I just wanted to jump into things because I’m scared.
Tony: However, tell flaming head that his brother is coming with us and doesn’t completely hate him. He is also bringing the soda that Mockingbird requested.
Me: Why?
Me: She did mention what happened with Friday. Although, I think your presidential meeting hadn’t happened yet. What happened with the president?
HSBF: Your strudel will win everybody over. It's delicious.
“And that could be traumatic. Mommy Spider is a mama bear as much as Spider Aunt. So of course she will want to get away. Hopefully, Mary will take care of everything once it gets to be a reasonable time in New York.”
Purple Arrow: I know that you were originally planning to sell all of your property in the tower. Linda told me during our meet up, because you told her that during your breakdown at the farm. Yet you kept the apartments at the tower just so the kids wouldn’t have to move again or be farther away from their new friends, especially Ms. Marvelous.
Good news, Loki did not promise that I would be the Grand Master's new concubine. Although, I wonder if Loki made no such promise regarding himself. Surprisingly, I was ready to quake the Grand Master when he tried to grope Loki's breasts. I think that's when I stopped hating him a little bit.
“Is there something that you need?” Afia asked.
HSBF: You don’t have to buy me a house.
Red phone: But unlike Bucky, you were his type.
Me: Did Friday tell you where I am or did I end up on Twitter? The baseball cap doesn’t work like it used to.
Me: Do you really believe that?
Special thank you to Misaky0, my collaborator on this story. Normally she just does the artwork but in this she helped me with some of Yo-Yo’s dialogue.
Stephen C: I’m not sure we are actually friends and I kind of feel bad for getting him involved. It wasn’t his fight.
Agent L. Barton: In the meantime, Simmons and the children are relocating to the Malta compound.
Me: Really?
Nomad: Wait, you made that suggestion in front of him.
HSBF: Are you really over your ex-girlfriend? Because I kind of remember you making the same snide remarks about Sharon.
Also, the voice recognition software initially put arrested instead of rested and it was just too funny not to use. My voice rec has an interesting sense of humor. Maybe she’s part FRIDAY?
Tony: I have the honey butter chicken sandwich from Roaring Rooster and shakes from DJ’s so I’m ready for the emotional pain that will surely follow.
Agent 13: And Agent Rodriguez said she gave the caterers a list of all the food allergies to the VIPs.
“So obviously, the answer to the second one is no and definitely not for accidental pornography.”
Purple arrow: I have so many questions. Am I allowed to have access to these reports? Also, why was Bruce with Thor?
Me: I thought there were 36 questions?
“Or possibly strangle him.” Davis mumbled under breath.
The Mechanic: Maybe he was undercover but got sucked into the philosophy. You know that happen sometimes.
So yes, Tony and Steve are at the same hotel in the same country. However, Sam and Tony need a few minutes. So what are your predictions for the next conversation? Mean what post as soon as he gets back from proofreading.
Me: Well I'm glad they were able to prevent a Hydra weapon from getting into the hands of terrorists. Although don't you think it's ironic that an anti-alien hate group wants to buy a weapon most likely based on alien technology?
December 5, 2016
Purple arrow 2023: Do you want to talk about it?
Steve is much happier being Nomad and isn’t going back to the old identity even if he’s no longer a fugitive. He misses his shield but doesn’t miss all the pressure that goes along with the shield. The paragon of virtue Captain America can't be gay (I hate "no bisexuals"), but Nomad can have a husband. It’s easier for Steve to find his place this way.
Me: Will do.
From: Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider
Morgan’s dad: Except for apparently Simmons.
To be continued
Nomad: Six.
Me: I’m sure if you Google the incident, you’ll find pictures of the wedding fiasco.
Nomad: You’re going back to DC so soon?
Captain tight pants: I know and it scares me.
Me: Yes.
D: Take a nap. Also, I didn’t want to know about your sex life when we shared an apartment at MIT. I don’t want to know now.
Nomad: Did you do anything that could result in you needing to hide out in Wakonda for a couple of months? You know, vengeance isn’t always the answer?
"Is Peter wearing pajamas?" Steve remarked.
I’m sorry about the message from yesterday. I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just upset that Tony and I still can’t really talk to each other. Our schedules are not making it any better. I was about to cancel today’s lunch because of an emergency visit to our cell phone factory in China when Friday informed me that Tony had a last-minute meeting with Rhodey because of an incident last night. Maybe it really fell apart because neither one of us had time for the other and not just because he fell in love with you.
(See the end of the chapter for
Director Snookums: That you were completely in love with him and when you're in love, you will do crazy things to protect people you love. Sometimes, they blow up in your face.
HSBF: Good.
We are back to the “bad choices were made” timeline in October of 2023. A few notes, time will not be flowing the same between our two timelines. Only a few hours have passed in the “good choices” timeline; in contrast, nearly a day has passed in the “mistakes were made” timeline. There’s a reason for that.
“And Stark is very partial to your new look. I had to listen to him talk about the joys of beard friction on the flight here. That might be why Happy was so cranky.” Steve groaned at her words.
Me: Irish moms are very similar. As for Happy, I’m trying to help you out there. I emailed him.
Me: That is completely understandable.
Nomad: Don’t try. Just teach him to be less reckless.
“Hey Afia, come over here and say hi to your future stepdad.”
Nomad: Eat a chocolate, Tony.
"And then Friday would send it anyway." Steve added with a grin.
“Which makes her a good agent,” Natasha told him.
Red phone: I mean Melinda Garner. I ran into her today. She works for the ATCU now. She seems nice, just sad and extremely terrifying, but in a Pepper chewing out the board way.
Me: Yes.
HSBF: Thank God. I was kind of afraid you would fall off because of this mess.
Anthony: They were not talking about you or even Yo-Yo for that matter. Because technically I am authorized to talk to you and Yo-Yo is registered. Even though she thinks the Accords are absolute bullshit, she wants to help people and signed anyway.
Blue phone: That’s a specific situation.
HRH: He should put a ring on it.
Girl Friday: Maybe because of their text conversation, they will just go to sleep.
HSBF: That Clint will probably end up being your archery instructor.
Tony: Really, you should have. I had to make sure it didn’t need repairs. I can’t have you running around in a rip suit, even though I know that’s what you would be doing if I wasn’t helping you out.
“Yes. I need help and treatment before it gets worse. Which meant the truth needs to get out. I had a videoconference with Suarez earlier. There’s some new medication that SHIELD has been working on that may help me. I will have to stay here for a few weeks while she gets the doses right, which Hunter is going to hate, but it’s for the best.” Leo genuinely smiles when he says Hunter’s name. There has to be something to that. She’s going to have to ask Fitz about that later. However, she has more pressing concerns.
Me: Thank you. Next question: Is there something that you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t had a chance to yet? If so, why haven’t you got to it yet? I’m really not liking this quiz.
Red phone: So, in addition to trying to get me to violate my conscience and make weapons again, the Secretary of Defense also tried to get me to tell them where you are. Actually, I think they want you more than the armor.
Me: He’s 15. Also, can we just talk without your defenses going up? I care about you.
Me: Be glad I’m up late working while you’re probably having your early morning run. It still technically September 15 for another 20 minutes.
[Redacted] misses you, by the way. He really looks up to you, which is good because you know about his uncle and I’m not sure if my husband is better. You should know that he’s not coming with me. He is actually going to be staying with a couple of friends until I leave. We are going to spend some time apart to sort things out. It was a mutual decision. He knows about [Redacted] being special. His reaction was not the best. He wants [Redacted] to be fixed, to just be a normal kid again. Obviously, he needs to do some soul-searching and we can’t be there for that. I can’t protect my son from everything, but I have to keep this from him.
Love: What?
Me: Still breathing, although it was a near thing when I told Sean about taking a 15-year-old to Germany without the complete consent of his guardian.
Hunter: And obviously not just for an appointment.
Nomad: I agree with him on that.
“Of course, Agent Barton,” Friday said before the video popped up on the screen. She almost wondered if Dr. Potts override May’s earlier orders.
Me: And it’s technically owned in the name of a dummy corporation with no ties to SI because again I’m pretty sure it was really for SHIELD.
Tony Potts: So, when the purple asshole took out half of life in the universe down to the amoeba level, he decided to make it so I could have children. The result was Morgan
The mechanic: I know it’s important to Steve, so I will try to make it happen even if we have to get married in a different country. Although we are planning to wait until Steve can be on American soil without getting shot or kidnapped by the DOD.
Tony: No, because we have to be up like at 4 AM to get on the private jet to Malta. I’m leaving this as soon as I can in good taste. Afia can hang out with Ned once we get back from Wakanda. She better be “resting” and fully packed when I get home.
Agent Laura: Possibly. So did you actually talk to Steve?
“I totally understand wanting to text your family. I wish I could talk to my Nana right now. I’m just so worried about her. She probably went right to the wine when I disappeared. It’s her answer for everything.”
Hunter: I already made them before Stark called because Robin told me to. She knew you would need them.
Football Hunter: Yes. Besides that, you’re all over twitter. Your picture looks dashing. I like the new eye color. Also, the beard.
“Understandable. I hate undercover,” May told him, which surprised Steve.
Anthony: Although not a bastard like your ex or slightly obsessive and crazy like Ross, I’m pretty sure I will punch him in the teeth if he uses any more PR buzzwords on me.
Tony Potts: Because I'm assuming Dr. Stark-Rogers is very sterile?
Nomad: So, you decided to bring a date?
Time sent: 11/11/2016 19:11:41
Me: Besides, you have always treated her like your kid.
HSBF:  I agree.
Me: At least this time I was distracted by less sleazy things like saving the world and not the obviously augmented chest of whatever stripper Obadiah lines up for the party plane. This is starting to become a really unhealthy pattern.
Captain Tight Pants: I wanted a piece of my past, something to hold onto. I get that.
Purple Princess: This is definitely a conversation for you to have with Benji when all of this stuff is not going down. We have too many alien invasions to deal with this at the moment.
Agent Laura: Natasha is a softy. She’s always liked me. Besides, I need to focus on Simmons and Clint right now. I’ve barely gotten him to the point he’ll eat pizza with me. It was a miraculous first step.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: I think we’re going to be doing some training exercises. Also, May is going to teach me how to drive.
Morgan’s dad: I kept working on the time travel thing, by the way, and I gave Deke access. So, don’t say I don’t want to help because I do, but I need you to meet me halfway. I need you to…
Red phone: But I'm still going to go even though I know this is just another interrogation session, this time with someone with a PhD. I’m planning to regale him or her with a story about giving my Cuddle Bunny a sponge bath post car accident recovery. Every time I start talking about sex, they shut down the sessions. It’s been fun talking with them.
“And I want to pretend I’m all altruistic and I’m in this for humanity, but I’ve always been a selfish prick. I want Morgan to meet Happy and Peter.”
Tony: Maybe we’ll get lucky and the qualified woman running against Present Ellis will win despite how dirty the campaign is getting.
"I get it. It was probably even worse for you because you remember how Aunt Peggy was during the war. I knew my aunt was a total badass, but I didn't actually know what she did in DC all day. Not until later."
“Cookies can’t make things magically better.”
"Very close. She knew that he was bisexual. That was something you didn't tell people back then." Tony explained.
“Now?” Tony asked.
Me: Well I’m not 20 anymore and I need food and maybe cuddling. I like cuddling. I was going to order something, but I figured I should respond to you first.
Red phone: I don't know. I've half expected her to be here with her godson, but Laura has no idea where she is.
Anthony: My ego thanks you. What about Tropical Thunder? I think it’s a good option if you want to stare at somebody that kind of looks like me.
SimmonsJA: The director obviously believes otherwise. Otherwise, he would not have allowed me to deploy Shield resources in this way. And he has known you since you were at MIT together. The fact that you referred to your assistant’s presence as “cock blocking” means that you were not planning to follow the advice of your physician.
Me: He has been a complete asshole to his nephew who transitioned. However there’s more to the story. Pre-transition, S was trying to date her. She said no and suddenly she’s fired despite signing the Accords and following all other required procedures. My lawyers are going to have so much fun.
Red spider: Are you okay?
“I wouldn’t be going through these ridiculous questions with you if I didn’t want to fix things. I know answering these 36 questions isn’t going to fix everything, but…”
Also, it beats spending more time with the sober and not chronically depressed version of Nana. You know the version my mom told me about that I never knew. I got stuck with the one mourning a guy who's not dead who decided to shack up with Hunter, Hunter.
Purple Arrow: I’ve been terribly busy.
Purple Princess: Because it’s a school trip, not a Stark family trip.
"I didn't bring you here to help me scout locations. You're just standing there with me as I try to talk Steve into it, as we wait for Leo to show up to explain why he called an all-hands meeting here and not at the compound."
MayMQ: You should try talking to the package again.
“Yes, I’m older than my grandparents. Time travel is weird, especially when you do it again and get trapped in a different alternate timeline.” The visitor told them.
The Mechanic: Regardless, I do want to talk to Pepper Pot. Also, I will have Mary get Spider mom set up with the new job away from the husband.
“I see you’re taking advantage of the Princess’s gift.”
Me: You could at least let me know that you’re not grounded for life because your aunt realizes that you’re a superhero in your spare time. I would like a heads up when she does find out so I can make sure I'm still out of the country or at least suit up because she’s going to try to kill me.
This chapter was written for everyone whose only criticism about Captain America: Civil War was the Steve/Sharon kiss. Tony is going to say everything you know you were thinking.
Monkey lover 2: The bomb blew up three monoliths. They better be in separate countries by now. I’m almost positive that’s why the world broke apart.
“How are you typing so fast?”
HSBF: That’s good at least.
Thank you to everyone who read or left comments on the confidential annotations. You’re all absolutely wonderful. I had a really good vacation. Although I didn’t get any writing done. Thankfully for you guys, I sent a bunch of stuff off to proofreading before leaving. Now I have lots of chapters to update. The only story I’m not updating this weekend is Hydra Lullaby because that story is currently sharing a beta with this one (although if anybody would like to volunteer so that is no longer the case. I would appreciate it).
Lily bear 2018: He’s mad at Dad too. He blames him for you being missing. He punched dad, and more importantly, dad let him. He doesn’t want Uncle Tony and dad to send us to Malta with the other kids. He says he's not a baby. He’s definitely acting like one right now.
“I know.” Steve responded.
Cuddle Bunny: And then you showed up unannounced and ended up doing a pizza party and handing out stark pads to every kid there.
Ana Jr.: You said that she's been working on time travel for the last five years.
Nomad: I was hoping to find an exclamation on why one of the Jedi looks exactly like my former boss.
Steve: She was at the cabin with you when May and I went to ask you to help.
To: Pepper_pot
Steve: Robin loves being there. She says that they’re supposed to be sisters someday. I have no idea what that means.
Thank you to everyone who read or commented on the last chapter. You’re all absolutely wonderful. Now it’s time for Bucky to bare his heart to his best friend.
Me: Of course you are. Sorry Snuggle Bear, it’s the consequence of dating Tony Stark. There were engagement rumors about me and Pepper for years.
“That would be good. I’m also curious about how that happened. I will always want to see Bucky happy, even if it’s not my Bucky.” Steve said sadly.
Red phone: Of course he did. This really is my fault. All the depraved things I made Jarvis watch before. Of course Vision picked up some bad habits.
Hunter: Are you mad at him for moving on?
Morgan’s dad: Difficult is getting your 4-year-old to fall asleep when her best friend stays over. This feels impossible.
Tony: I think the accounts meeting is going to end by 4 pm which is going to give me time to go home and do that thing with my tongue that you really like and still be ready for dinner at 7 PM.
I'm being called to mingle with the Grand Master's court. I hope Earth gets one of my messages very soon. If he tries to touch my boobs again, I will quake him or show him that thing that Tosha taught me. He looks humanoid enough to get just as broken.
“You could’ve stayed and got the same deal that Clint did.”
Tony: No going out with friends without a preapproved chaperone, no staying out late, no unsupervised patrolling, and no saving the world from the bad guys unless aliens are invading again.
Me: Yes, and she brought pie. Afia, along with the other kids, made the other desserts. There were cookies and brownies and I’m probably going to have to let scary May the agent take me to the gym because I’ve eaten way too much. Ana will send you pictures.
Nomad: I think I may be dating Anthony.
“I know. Before we switched, I looked at my file.” Steve remarked.
“If I’m going to talk to Clint or more likely text message my alternate timeline husband, then I want you and Steve to have another conversation. May I suggest breakfast tomorrow morning?”
HSBF: Not as much as last time. Although, you know that I love you. I would regret not being completely intimate with you physically. You?
Of course, I’m going entirely on supposition because this Clint hasn’t said a word to me about anything. He was waiting for me to wake up in medical after passing out. However, after I confirmed May’s suspicions that I am a Shield agent from an alternate 2018, he’s been avoiding me. Maybe I’m just another ghost of the past to him now.
HSBF: Mind. After what I saw Peggy go through during the last few years, I rather be able to remember everyone I love and care about than be able to run a mile in two minutes.
Me: So what do you think I would change?
“Good. Give Friday the information, and we will move all their stuff back into the house. See, I helped.”
Stephen C: Only because Dr. Fitz was apparently working on some sort of antidote because he was paranoid. Tony says that’s not even in his normal line of research.
Director Snookums: You know I feel like you’re bringing up marriage just so I won’t point out the fact that I know you’re lying to me. Coulson’s team in Zephyr One picked up seismic activity within about half a mile of where you were 45 minutes ago. So I’m going to ask again, why are you in Baltimore?
“Badly. I just don’t know what to say or even really where to start,” Steve sighed.
Me: Of course they are. Will you be having meetings with them again soon?
Tony: Well, my publicist is actually writing my version, but again, maybe I want to know how well you’ve listened, so let’s do each other instead.
HSBF: You’re not supposed to be running missions. Are you okay?
As a reminder, you're not going to see every text message going on between our protagonists, only the important ones. If you saw every message, the story will end up a good 1000+ chapters. I know some of you would be perfectly okay with that, but that's a lot of chapters to dictate. Let’s be honest; a lot of them would probably be Avenger dinner orders. It takes a lot of takeout to feed the multiple Avengers squads.
Love: Which is remarkable because they don’t even know they’re dating.
HSBF: Will the two Purple Arrows really be around?
HSBF: It’s the beginning of November.
S Carter: Yes.
Agent M: Again, I do not care if you have to tranquilize Liberty. Ross is pulling a Vader.
Agent L. Barton: Do you think if I approach her with a job offer to work with the Avengers, she would agree to it?
HSBF: The second part is obviously becoming you know who.
Tony: I now know about his abusive alcoholic father and a half-sister in Nevada. BTW she didn’t survive the decimation.
Venom: Glad I could help.
To be continued
Anthony: Hey I just wanted to let you know that I decided to go to Johannesburg early. I managed to move things around and it just made sense to start things on the 23
During their acquaintance, Tony has realized that Steve is good at a lot of things. And during the last hour, Tony has realized that masseuse should go to the top of that list. He felt happy and relaxed. Probably because a Steve massage has quite the climax, literally. Totally by accident, maybe. Steve was the ultimate gentleman and did not go anywhere near Dr. Simmons’ list of no zones. Yet somehow, he still came harder than he has since… ever.
Me: Spidey is another person who is in your life. Then there’s Coulson, Melinda, Yo-Yo, and Clint, who probably wouldn’t appreciate you making sex jokes.
"Should I stay here the referee or should I go surprise Steve?" Natasha asked.
Me: It won’t work. The only thing that would get her to not make us do this is telling her who you really are and my BFF said that’s not an option. So answer the damn question sexy pants.
December 25, 2016
Me: And agree to do the New York Times interview with me when we’re together?
Red phone: I really just want to hug you right now and I am not a hugger, but I feel like you need one badly.
“Someday, I want to hear that story,” Simmons said, getting up from the couch.
Actually don't even listen to the SI press release because at least half of it is pure BS. Also, you should probably take whatever I tell you with a grain of salt because I may or may not have been dying of Palladium poisoning for about six months and told no one. I am the master of pretending to be fine when I’m not. I’ve been working on that in therapy. Try not to do the same thing.
Me: I’ll take that over the hell no that any of the other candidates would illicit.
The way you talk about all your kids, it doesn’t surprise me that you were happy that somebody thought that Benjamin was your actual son. You know you should consider adoption or fostering, despite your doubts. I know you mentioned something before about kids with powers ending up in the system. Maybe when your health is 100% you can look into it. I don’t think you’ll be rejected like you think you will be.
HSBF: Are you sad about destroying the LMD?
The Mechanic: I am starting to get to that point with TMNS.
Best Thing I Never Had
“Both.”
To be continued
Tony: Simmons can stay at the cabin for a while once we get all of this done. And I’ll be her sponsor.
Cuddle Bunny: I assume that Dr. Suarez is now a member of the ATCU?
FRIDAY’s break up playlist: Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N9opF-PK5k
Anthony: That sounds about right. I will figure out how to expedite you a copy of Star Trek Beyond for a future movie night unless you don't like the alternate continuity.
“You’re not going to try to arrest me?” Steve asked as he led them back to Sam’s room but Davis only replied with a laugh. Moments after that the agents then pulled out a device that scanned the room most likely for bugs.
CoulsonPJ: I think he just hates Ross. Jeffrey said too much at the meeting. I think the director is sending him to Alaska to do an assessment on the abomination for the next month to make up for it.
“I do as well."
HSBF: Tony really? Stop trying to change the subject and tell me how things really went with Happy yesterday. Did you guys work things out?
Counselor Laura: Probably because of years of Howard telling you that you could never be as good as Steve.
Friday: @WHiHOfficial_JWest @SI_CEO_VPotts was a goddess among CEOs long before she was screwing Stark and will be so long afterwards.
D: You could’ve had your deputy respond to me? Who is your deputy right now? McKenzie?
Anthony: I know that, especially because that’s how Pepper found out that we’re together.
Tony: I don’t know. The board wants me out because of the boyfriend. And I’m so tired of dealing with them. I actually really like spending time in DC and doing more of the Avenger stuff. I also like protecting the kids. I can do that by shaping the ATCU’s policies in that regard. I feel like maybe it’s time to move on.
Red phone: Unfortunately, it took a giant fight at a missile silo in Siberia for you to get around to actually asking me this stuff.
Please note that neither Steve nor Tony know that there are two Leopold Fitz’s right now. Although that won’t stay the case for long. Especially with Karen around. She has no filter. Thanks to Spider-Verse I’m starting to use Leopold J. Fitz for an other-dimensional visitor, or at least that’s what Karen is using. She is a spider AI after all. The Leo from the story’s original timeline will just be Fitz.
Tony: Okay the next question is something I’ve always been curious about.
HSBF: Probably.
“23 times, including caressing his thigh four times.” At Friday’s response, Tony was profoundly regretting giving Laura Friday privileges again.
Venom: I hope so after we avoid half of us disappearing.
Red phone: If people in multiple countries didn't want to kill me on sight, I would volunteer to be a science envoy.
Cuddle Bunny: You’re not a coward. You just use avoidance as a coping mechanism too much.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I don’t know. I think it might make things worse because he chose to stay and is married to Hunter. He argues otherwise, but we all know better.
Me: What did you do to Jane that resulted in her wanting you to answer that question in the New York Times?
Chief Mechanic: Oh, now you talk. Are they really in lab six? Are they doing science without me? Or are they just having an orgy? It feels weird that I prefer the orgy. That means they’re doing standard teenage stuff and not preparing for an apocalypse that I can’t protect them from.
“What do you need me to do?”
“Yes.”
Red phone: It doesn’t count as FWB if you are in love with the person.
Me: Because she left before the agency collapse because it just got too much for her. However, because of her being former Shield, Jane can kind of tell when somebody is lying for national security reasons. It’s why she’s so good as my image manager. She was Shield PR first.
Venom: I typed “nice pillow,” and my grammar IA changed it.
Tony: Yo-Yo said that she would sneak in a phone to May before Mack takes her out on her goodbye dinner. So you might be able to talk to her at breakfast our time tomorrow. I think.
Madeline Rice is an original character, but I consider her a mix of former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice. And maybe a dash of Susan Rice as well. I’m probably going to go the “no celebrities were harmed” route for a lot of the other cabinet positions of the Ellis administration.
Director Snookums: Still more likely a few more months, then a few weeks. Some aspects of the Accords actually need to be re-negotiated which means State Department involvement and congressional ratification which will be time consuming.
HSBF: That makes no sense. All he did here was worry about his kids and Laura when he was around. I’ve seen the man almost on the verge of tears every time he was reminded of them. He loves those kids. He loves Laura.
Tony: Not at all. Talk to you later Sugar Pie.
Me: Okay, stop glaring. You’re adorable when you glare. I’ll be back in a few minutes. I need to go to the men’s room and I know there are snacks somewhere.
“That she was no longer cursing me out at doctors' appointments. I said some really stupid stuff, including accusing her of sleeping with someone else because I thought I was really sterile. I didn’t want her to completely cut me out of Morgan’s life, so I was very careful for the first two years.” Tony explained. “You?”
HSBF: Where are you? Did you really start walking here?
“That’s so unfair. I’ll be back later, Sugarplum." Tony said with one last kiss.
“There were not any French girls,” Steve shoots back.
Agent L. Barton: I read. Are you still trying to get Vision’s body back?
“Although he has seven doctorates, I don’t think any of them were in this field. You need Tony. You need the Princess and Leo, and unfortunately, I know for a fact at least he is stuck in my timeline. I’m also 99% sure the Princess was a casualty of the decimation. Which means Tony is the best available option.” She argued.
Purple Arrow: You said the same thing before, or rather, my Laura did.
Agent L. Barton: Especially after getting pregnant with Nikki by accident. I love my baby, but that was not a planned pregnancy. That was a post “oh God, Hydra didn’t kill you” accident.
“Following the Watchdog money trail and coming up with enough evidence to prove that Senator Nadir was consulting with a foreign government to commit terrorist acts on U.S. soil. Although, I don’t know if any more evidence is actually needed.”
Anthony: Virtual reality training exercise. Dr. Monkey Lover refers to it as the ‘framework’ so we don't get sued by the copyright holders of the Matrix. But the concept is similar-ish, except our goal is to let people beat the hell out of each other without medical visits.

“Before,” Steve answered simply. Oh, that is definitely not good.
CoulsonPJ: I didn’t think I meant that much to him. He went back to Laura once she got cleaned and successfully stayed that way for a while. Never date somebody who’s just legally separated from his wife.
“So do you think you can stop talking to your boyfriend for 30 seconds to hug me?” Steve heard James say as he ran out of the house to greet him.
Agent L. Barton: You’re always the best Friday. As for the Simmons here, I talked to Tony, and he’ll be her AA sponsor if she’s willing to have him. She is also allowed at the cabin for sleepovers.
November 28, 2016
Me: Don’t worry. I’ll tell Ross to fuck off for you, especially because you have trouble with cursing.
Me: Where are you?
Anthony: Well we’re not at that place in our relationship and if we were, you would be flying over here to strangle me and Happy would be speaking to me again. Whatever you think, just know that Pepper will not be stepping into my bedroom anytime soon. Which is why Happy is pissed.
However, I’m sorry for how I reacted when I found out that Hydra used you to murder my parents. After a lot of time in therapy and bunch of medication, I am able to acknowledge that you were not culpable in their murder. You had no autonomy and no control over your actions. I can’t blame you for the events of December 16, 1991.
Nomad: They were all that you talked about for months and you just left for no good reason? Why? What are you thinking?
Me: He made you out to be some god who couldn’t do anything wrong. I think I prayed to your poster as a child. Okay, I may have had a tiny crush on you as a teenager and that may have been how I figured out that I’m bi.
CoulsonPJ: Not your kisses with Stefan, but Tony and Stefan. I thought they were going to start ripping off clothes at any moment.
Nomad: I don't even want to know how you know that.
Anthony: I can understand why that’s no longer a simple question. Do you actually count someone as a sibling that you’ve never met? Not only that, I assume she doesn’t even know you exist.
“Now you believe us,” Fitz sighed at his girlfriend.
Me: But we’re getting better at it.
T Stark: You threatened to cut off my genitals, not in those words. Also, I don’t hate Pepper’s boyfriend. I’m a little annoyed that he thinks that Pepper was my beard, but I don’t hate him. I’m a little disappointed that she’s dating someone that barely passes the half your age +7 rule, but I am not allowed to comment on that sort of thing.
“But they could work it out if he wasn’t with you,” Happy responded.
Morgan’s dad: Get Laura back home. I don’t think any of us intended for this to become a time kidnapping.
Please note, since these people are not hiding from the government (Rhodey is VP and knows where they are), there are fewer codenames, and the underage are referred to by their actual names. It’s one of the few advantages of this dystopic future.
This is not my first relationship with a man. So I guess I should tell you that Artie was not just a friend. I know I should’ve told you back then, but I was scared. Petrified for you to find out the truth and hate me for it. Or worse. I didn’t want you to leave me. I also didn’t want to get arrested because, well, you remember what it was like back then, but I sacrificed what I needed to keep you around and I have to stop doing that. At least that’s what my therapist tells me.
Love: I’m glad I’m several thousand miles away, even if I’m dealing with an emotionally distraught Nomad
FRIDAY: Because your relationship was built on a foundation of sand.
HSBF: You’re probably right.
Happy Bear: I didn’t expect you to respond before morning. Also I don’t need details. I’m definitely switching hotels tomorrow.
Anthony: I think we established that I don’t like being lied to for the sake of protection. I’m also not a fan of lies of omission. No matter how bad things are, I need to know the truth. I had a need to know the truth.
“I agree. Part two is in what way?”
"And then there’s the fact that there’s no filter right now and I’m pretty good at saying the wrong thing at the worst possible time.”
“Because the longer you keep putting it off, the harder it will be?”
“I don’t need politeness right now.” Laura was trying to remember if Steve was this much of a dick before the therapy and getting laid constantly.
Nomad: Why do you hate Sharon so much? Friday said it had something to do with your relationship with her mother.
“Are you going to tell him that I’m your boyfriend?” Tony interrupted as Steve read him the letter. Steve was actually proud of himself for finishing something that almost resembled a complete letter. Usually he didn’t get more than a paragraph done before he had the nano paper Wipe itself. This he could almost send. It was just missing one thing.
Me: And that makes me happy.
Time sent: 9/1/2016 17:01:41
“We can skip this question.” Steve offered because he doesn’t want to think about Tony dying again.
“I heard your conversation with Dr. Fitz while I was getting my suit fitted this morning.” Steve responded.
Tony: People say hindsight is 20/20. If we could go back and do it all over again, we would make different choices. Of course, we probably would make all new mistakes.
TMNS: I’m not sure how to address that spider. Everyone keeps finding out by accident, and they never react well. My aunt freaked out and was about to bring lawyers against Mr. Stark.
Blue phone: Nor will I, ever.
Me: Some would say that it would be the day that a certain scientist saw something great in me and gave me that gift that you don’t want me to mention by name, or finding out that James didn’t die during the incident.
From: Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider
HSBF: You have mentioned it before.
And now for my happy rant:  how absolutely wonderful was the Black Panther trailer? I’m pretty sure I’ve watched it 20 times. I can’t wait for February.
OK for the record, I would say in regards to the next question, that I’ve been crying in front of other people a lot more now; probably because of the medication. I cried while typing some of the stuff up mostly when thinking about Maria and Anna. A lot of that is still hard to deal with. As for crying in front of other people, there may have been more recent incidents, but I’m going with when I found out about what really happened to Benji and you were there, which was good, because I don’t like crying alone.
"Tell me your story Mr. May-Rogers." Tony requested.
I’m surprised you let me anywhere near your kid if you remember that particular youthful indiscretion.
HSBF: So how is staying with Pepper going?
Me: I think I own a house in her district. Maybe I should consider running. I wouldn’t be any worse.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just you’ve been down a while. I thought you could use some coffee.” She was carrying one of the extra-large cups along with a granola bar. Bless her.
Agent M: I despise Christina Everhart.
“Is that what you’re worried about?" Steve asked
Nomad: I’m not even surprised.
Anthony: Although not secluded enough for you to be able to visit. I'm disappointed that Shield’s budget has gone down so dramatically that they can't even afford a good safe house in the Caribbean.
Blue phone: Yes, but because of things being what they were, we decided that we were better off as friends, actual friends. He went into the Navy and I went into the Army. Then I met Peggy and I ended up frozen in the ocean, so it didn’t matter. He died in March 2012 about a week before I came back. Also, of lung cancer.
Me: There are some loopholes. Robots as tools are still allowed. So, to have an LMD that can disarm a bomb or go into a crumbling building and save lives is still a possibility. It just can’t have the ability to become omnipotent and decide that the world would be better off if all humans were dead. You know like last time.
Me: Oh God. Please tell me that you’re planning to write the cover version of that for me?
Red phone: I was contacted by my ATCU contact agent Daisy because she was desperate to get in contact with our favorite Asgardian. The reason why was because Agent Agent was having some interesting side effects to the procedures that Patches used to get him back among the living. I wouldn’t help without being told the truth about Coulson. Of course everything resolved itself before I could get a hold of a certain Asgardian.
Ned was on the same reduced lunch program Peter was. They both were in
“No!” Tony clears his throat, startled by his own sudden loudness. Adonis, god of beauty and desire, seems unbothered. “Sorry. No. It’s fine. Don’t apologize. Um, I’m Tony.” He sticks out a hand.
He talked about all the things he was too scared to tell Steve, like how there was this chemistry set he wanted to save up for but didn’t even know where to start, and how the kids at school - namely, Flash Thompson - were mean to him whenever he got the answers right in class, and how there was only twelve school days left before summer and how he woke up every morning to check another day off, because he couldn’t wait until he’s free from all the bullshit.
And -- fuck. Maybe that’s a sign.
“I know,” Peter agreed, and just then, someone came up from behind Peter and planted two warm hands on his shoulders.
“Good,” Michelle responded, turning back to the novel still open in front of her. “‘Cause then I’d have to kill you.”
time stops in this moment. There’s an air of flirtation between them, sure, but what if Tony’s reading everything wrong? What if Steve is just making friendly conversation, and truly wants nothing more than to turn and run from Tony’s shaky hands and cold brew and lame attempts at humor? For a second -- a full
Once Steve left for work, Peter flopped backwards onto the bed to look at the clock behind him.
Steve couldn’t afford it, though. And Peter really,
“You know,” Harley said at some point, after Peter had been talking about his current chemistry project for longer than probably socially acceptable, “there’s this rich guy who comes around sometimes and buys stuff for us. Gets everyone nice shit - kids toys, parents supplies. He donates to the shelter too, helps cover the cost of food, beds. That’s why this place is so nice.”
of people.”
or some other soapy bullshit with his best friend, but he can’t do that. (He does think, very briefly, that waiting in the baggage claim area, like the way he’s doing right now, is surprisingly exhilarating. Every few minutes, a crowd of people come bustling to the carousels to collect their suitcases, and Tony can’t help but place the image of it happening in 20 minutes time into his mind. He’s bored as fuck, sure, and impatient as hell, but
(Steve was afraid that it would never be, could never be - that it would always be some story he had to make up in his head, but he tried not to let that fear fester or spread; he just ignored it instead.)
Steve slung an arm around Peter’s shoulders. “Alright,” he said, taking pity on Peter and tugging him in close. “Let’s head to our room, huh?” Peter nodded and stumbled along.
Steve pulls his phone out to, and sticks the unlocked device out for Tony to grab. “Well, yeah, but,” Steve shrugs, “I’ll forgive you.” When Tony takes his phone -- holy shit, it’s old, and it’s not even a Stark Phone, which isn’t actually
Peter nodded furiously. “Yes!” he promised, laughing and shoving the plate further towards Ned. Michelle, without looking up from her book, leaned away from Ned to protect herself from the potato slime as Ned slid it away from him. “Cross my heart and hope to die.”
He clicks off of Instagram. When he checks the time, it’s only been almost 10 minutes, so he’s not even halfway there. He wants to press fast forward on the whole thing so he can just get it all over with and watch
“Hey, Petey,” Steve answered, and stuck out a hand to ruffle his son’s hair.
“You’re never out of my hair, punk. I’ve been taking care of you since we were kids, Stevie,” he said, grinning, and Steve rolled his eyes.
he would be getting on Peter’s ass about that in the near future. Harley might have blushed too, Steve thought, but he couldn’t say for sure. Harley nodded, though, clearly comfortable talking to adults for the most part. Steve was impressed.
Bucky made a sound, some sort of blend between a grumble and a moan. Peter laughed again, harder now, and crossed his arms on the table and buried his face in the skin there, muffling the noise. Bucky sat up to lean over and flick Peter’s ear, but it only made Peter laugh more. He rolled his eyes and slumped down in his chair, pulling his plate to the edge of the table and digging into the food in front of him. Steve pat his back as he passed by and sat in the chair next to him.
. Really, Tony wants to talk to Steve again, even if it’s only just on the wrong side of flirty and polite.
“Hey!” She peeled her face away from her book and narrowed her eyes at Peter. “Don’t bring me into this,” she said in a low voice, but her lips were twisting into some sort of a smile. Peter giggled.
“Thank you, Bucky.”
Peter shrugged, pulling his legs up to his chest and wrapping his arms around his chins. “Sounds good,” he answered. “Maybe then I’d actually learn something I didn’t already know.”
Peter smiled politely at her, and Steve was flooded with love for that kid. Both of them thanked May, and she called over another volunteer - a tall man with brown hair, shaved on the sides, and a name tag that read
At that, Steve turns and smiles at Rhodey. He sticks out his right hand. “Steve Rogers.”
Steve blinked at him, watched him with wide blue eyes and wonders; Bucky had always been such a good friend. Always been such a good brother. Always been so willing to take care of Steve

“Harley,” he responded, grinning at Peter so sweetly Peter thought he’d like to drown in it. “It’s nice to meet you, Peter.”
Steve woke up.
and it managed to reverberate inside of Steve’s chest when Peter said it back: “I love you too.”

Steve frowned, biting the inside of his cheek in a poor attempt to keep the unbridled tears welling in his eyes in check. “Buck,” he started, but Bucky huffed.
“Yeah, but you’re Capt. Steven

“Aw, with the ugly uniforms?” Peter pouted. When Steve rolled his eyes again, Peter plastered on a sparkling grin and tilted his head gently. “Really, Dad. I know how hard you work. I don’t blame you. I love you, and you’re the best dad in the entire world. Like, seriously, even - um, uh - Joe West! From

Peter sat up and huffed. “I’m almost in 8th grade,” he said with narrowed eyes. “Wade had his first kiss last year. When he was in my grade.”
“Good to meet you, Steve,” Rhodey says, firmly shaking Steve’s hand with a sparkling grin. Tony is thoroughly impressed with the lack of shitheadery Rhodey is possessing right now. “James Rhodes.”
“His flight landed, I think,” Steve answers, and that makes Tony’s heart drop into his chest, but the genuine half-disappointment in Steve’s voice makes Tony’s heart soar, too. “At least, it should’ve.”
“What about you?” Steve asks, and Tony’s a little surprised. “What do you do?”

Peter giggled. “Sure,” he said, drawing out the vowel as he rolled his eyes. “Anyways, how was your day? Did you meet any weird old people?”
“Hi there. I’m Steve, Peter’s dad,” he said and stuck his hand out. The boy blinked at him for a minute, but retaliated the handshake.
The kid looked even skinnier than Peter, which was a feat in itself. He was tanner, though, and the smirk on his lips made Peter’s belly twist and curl in the way that it did when Liz Allen told Peter he was
moment.
They arrived around 4:30 PM. May was working, so she helped them sign in and said that she remembered Steve from the phone. She told Peter, “There’s some other kids your age, dear. You’ll do just fine here.”
Steve sits next to Tony, close enough that Tony can smell his cologne -- warm, spicy, something a little bit like cinnamon, which is adorable and refreshing in the late October chill -- and feel his leg brush up against Tony’s. “Um,” Steve starts, a little uncertain, like he’s nervous. Tony nods at him, urging him to continue. “I’m actually picking Bucky up from deployment too. He’s been gone for eight months. Where was your friend stationed?”
“You’re sure?” Ned asked.
“Always, Steve,” Bucky said. “Well, as long as you keep making dinner whenever you’re here.” Steve unfurled himself from Bucky’s arms, and Bucky put a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder. He stepped back, threw some distance between him and his best friend in a futile attempt to make the air feel less heavy around him. Bucky didn’t seem to notice, and said, “Anyway, I’ve got beer and Chinese take out with your name on it.”
They’re a power couple, Tony decides after scrolling through Natasha’s feed. She’s only made four posts with Virginia, two of them having more than one photo attached, but Virginia’s made seven. He looks at all of them, which are all vastly similar in that there’s more often than not a cute picture of their arms wrapped around each other or lips pressed against each other, likely taken by a friendly and thankfully not homophobic passerby, with a cheesy caption (Virginia) or a string of vaguely related emojis (Natasha).
-- attached to the name. Tony grins.
Tony smiles. Steve’s eyes -- bright blue and sparkling in a way that leaves Tony breathless -- crinkle at the sides when he returns the grin. “My best friend, too,” he explains. “He’s been deployed for six months. I brought him a coconut milk, strawberry concoction because he’s disgusting and drinks this shit all the time.” He lifts the Pink Drink cup and shakes it, prompting Steve to wrinkle his nose.

sitting alone. Every morning. All the time.
“Anyway,” Peter cut in suddenly, before Steve could push the conversation any further. “Maybe we should finish scheming another time? We could hang out tomorrow, if you want.”
He shrugged. “Maybe I’ll ask.”
The next morning was a Friday, and Steve thanked God that the weekend was within reach. Peter woke up early, which Steve was grateful for, because Peter was ready to leave with half an hour to spare, so he had more than enough time for breakfast and morning cartoons before they left. Steve was an early riser and a good cook, so he made blueberry pancakes - Peter and Bucky’s favorite.

, as National Geographic liked to call it. The only difference was Ned’s mom had a lot more kids and a lot more shit on her plate, so she always got Ned and all his siblings fast food. It wasn’t her fault, but that’s why Ned was chubbier than Peter and still just as hungry. Peter’s dad had enough time to force a healthy meal into him. Ned’s mom? Not so much.

A wave of feeling overwhelmed Steve, and for a second, he drowned in it, but when he wrapped his arms tight around Bucky, it was like coming up for air. Bucky buckled down laughing again, relishing in a rare display of emotions from Steve, and with both hands, pat Steve’s shoulder blades firmly.
Tony stands, and elbows his way through the crowd up to the Starbucks countertop. His short stature doesn’t always bother him, but in jam-packed cafes, it certainly tests his patience. Still, he smiles in that plastic, mostly-just-for-show way at the barista, a young woman with scruffy black hair and a name tag reading

“Steve,” Bucky sighed, and set down his take out on the coffee table. “You know you’re good to stay as long as you want. Forever, if you need it.”
Tony laughs again, and because the fire in Steve’s eyes is infectious, he agrees passionately. “I mean, my bodily composition is about 65% percent coffee, but. Yeah. Milky fruit water. Literal crime against humanity.” Steve smiles again, and Tony jerks his head to the empty seat beside him on the bench. “If you’re not busy, you can - um - sit.”
and a bunch of other shit he couldn’t bring himself to care about -- before turning back to him. “It’s being made right now. Should be ready in just a minute.”
Tony snorts. “Multinational industrial company. Tech conglomerate. Computers, prosthetics, phones -- that stuff.” He shrugs, and Steve grins brightly. “I’m pleasantly surprised you’re living in ignorance of SI.”
Peter scoffed as he swung the car door open and crawled into the passenger seat. “Bet,” he challenged, with a smirk on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes. Steve had to bite down the goofy grin that bubbled up in response, but he didn’t bother shielding the warmth that spread from his heart to his eyes.

In fact, he loved
. The first apartment was lost to a huge fire that took every other apartment on that floor, and on the floors two above and two below. The second was an eviction, because Steve wasn’t exactly making bank as a veteran and high school art teacher; he was late to pay their crazy overpriced rent one time too many, and came home from work one afternoon to find an eviction notice pasted to his door and no more than 45 minutes to collect all of his and Peter’s belongings.
- which was, by the way, completely understandable, and Peter fully related - so all the (good) food was usually gone by 7:30. There was no way in hell Peter was going to eat oatmeal for breakfast, so he dragged himself out of their little closet sized room and down the hallway, to the dining area. He strolled up to the end of the line, which curved around half the room, and grabbed a tray as he passes by.
way he did whenever he worried about Steve. His blue eyes were icier than Steve’s, but somehow, warmer too. When Steve put his hand out, Bucky grinned and laid his hand right on top. “Thanks,” Steve croaked, the emotions overwhelming him more than he could manage. “It’s okay, Buck. We’ll be out of your hair soon.”
They could have a couch; big and long, that spread across the expanse of the living room and maybe curved like an L, that didn't have any gross, unidentifiable stains, that wasn’t from some used furniture garage sale because it was all they could afford. Steve could paint Peter’s room like the galaxy, like he’d always wanted to, and Peter could have a little set up for experiments or projects in the garage. They could eat blueberry pancakes every Saturday morning, have Bucky and Sam over for dinner every Friday evening, watch the Sunday cartoons together or sleep in until noon. It could be good.

First, he opens Instagram, which he immediately regrets upon seeing the first post of his feed: a photo of his ex-girlfriend/personal assistant, Virginia, and her new girlfriend, Natasha. In an instant, he swipes up and closes the app, blinking away the burn in his chest and trying not to roll his eyes. They were sweet together, and he had no control over Virginia --

Tony laughs. “Oh yeah,” he agrees, already pulling out his phone, shooting a little prayer to God inside his head and saying a silent thank you for introducing Tony to a pretty blond artist on this fine Thursday morning. “And it’d be really bad if I gave it to you, wouldn’t it?”
“That’s perfect,” Peter answered. “Hey,” he said as they walked towards their seats, “I never got your name. I’m Peter.”

Peter arrived in class 2 full minutes after the bell rang. His first period teacher, his chemistry teacher, Ms. Cowell, was extremely forgiving and kind of loved him, so she didn’t ride his ass about it for very long. Peter was immeasurably grateful for this. Thankfully, since he wasn’t late for any of his other classes, the office never called Steve about the tardies. Peter probably would have died if the school did such a thing.
and in my opinion, the most heart wrenching one:
Peter stepped away to get apple juice for himself and the boy, who he was slowly realizing looked a little bit older than Peter - not much, though, probably only a year or two. When he turned back to face where he once stood, he saw that the boy hasn’t moved a muscle and is, in fact, waiting while he watched Peter intently. Peter smiled nervously and stepped up to him.

Bucky shrugged and winked at him. Harley turned to Peter and whispered (very loudly, actually), “Is that your dad’s sugar daddy?” The once laughing Peter morphed into an all out cracking up teenager, as he guffawed and cackled at the question.
Pretty much immediately, Steve found an opening to teach lessons at Color Me Mine. It was part time and minimum wage, but it was better than nothing. He still got some benefits and money from the VA, and those two, combined with his teaching, would make him enough money to get them a new apartment by the end of the month. Briefly, he toyed with the idea of buying them a house, but he wasn’t sure they could afford the

That night, they didn’t really talk about it. Steve only told Bucky, “It’s just what a dad has to do.” Bucky didn’t understand, but he said that he no longer intended to. Steve hugged Bucky, hoped that Bucky would forgive him, and prayed that, no matter who Steve turned out to be, Bucky would never change.
apartment in the world; Steve wouldn’t tell Peter this, but it was also more than just a little bit because the superintendent was actively super creepy to a lot of the adolescents who lived there, and Steve could no longer put up with that shit, especially with the impending fear that Peter would be next.
whenever something was wrong. He knew Peter had figured it out,  but he still dropped the nickname whenever he needed to soften the blow. It was something Mary used to call Peter -
But then, Tony’s stomach drops, his guts twisting and turning and tying themselves into knots, and he remembers that this could be a goodbye. It’s not like Steve and him were having this monumental, once-in-a-lifetime conversation, but Steve is gentle and quiet and sweet in a way that makes Tony crave
Why was Harley at the shelter alone? Did he not have to go to school? He hadn’t even seemed like he was going to leave any time soon when Peter (so,

“Sure,” he answered. “Apple juice. OJ will kill you.”
(Every day, Steve thanked God that Mary was the sort of mother to put her child’s love of his father over her anger towards him - not that Steve had ever doubted, not even for a second, that Mary
“Do you usually sit with anyone?”
. Peter didn’t press.)
Tony smiles at her and nods thankfully. “Perfect,” he says. Maybe if it weren’t so crowded, he would have been a little bit friendlier, asked about her day or life or favorite caffienated beverage -
Steve laughed and tucked his son under his arm. “I love you, goof,” he whispered.
“Uh, my dad’s at work right now. He got a second job when we started staying here, so I don’t see him much anymore.” Peter shrugged, only a little hurt, because as much as he tried not to let it bother him, he kind of missed his dad. And he
It wasn’t real life. Steve had to remind himself. It felt real. He wanted it to be real. But it wasn’t.
He stepped towards Peter, the grin on his lips looking more like a grimace, like he was irrevocably, impossibly sad for Peter, and said quietly, “Don’t worry about, kid.” Peter smiled at him so warm that Steve thought he must have been the best kid alive.
whatever answer the blond god has will be a good one. “Well,” Steve starts --
He used
“Well, well, well,” he quipped, arms still holding Peter, prosthetic cold against the kid’s neck, as he walked their two bodies towards Steve. “If it isn’t my two favorite couch hoppers.”
Then, once Peter was out of earshot, Steve stepped up to Bucky and let himself be tugged into a tight hug. “Hey,” Steve whispered, holding Bucky as fiercely as he himself was being held. “Thanks for letting us stay again, Buck.”
Peter tipped his head forward into the pressure against his curls. Steve thought to himself briefly that if kids could purr, Peter certainly would be doing so; Steve ran his hand through Peter’s hair, a fluid, back and forth motion that probably would have put Peter to sleep if it weren’t 2:00 in the afternoon.
Steve blinked in surprise.
He put a hand out onto Peter’s knee. “But I can’t stop working, sweetheart. I promise, at the end of the summer, I’ll drop this job, and we’ll go back to how it was before. Eating breakfast together and all. But for a while, this is how it has to be, okay?”
. “It’s just - I can’t explain it right now. I’ve gotta go. Tonight, okay, I promise.”

“You don’t have to take care of me anymore,” Steve answered quietly. “I’m not that sick kid I used to be. I’m a captain, now.”
, Peter was his son, his
Peter giggled, rolling his eyes. He knew Steve was being serious. He didn’t care much. “Alright, Captain Dad. Next stop, Sgt. First Class James Buchanan Barnes.” He saluted and winked.
“He can’t kill me, I’m immortal. Tell Steve to fight me. And also that I love him.” Wade winked.
Peter giggled, and his smile doubled in size when the boy standing behind him popped his head out and poked Peter’s side. “So much trouble,” the boy responded, and Steve smiled at him.
Wade shrugged nonchalantly. “It’s fine,” he responded, sliding a chocolate bar out of his backpack. “Gonna miss you dickwads, though.”

Peter told him, “It’s okay with me, Dad. Whatever you think you need to do.”
He nodded, and pressed a kiss to Bucky’s cheek. “Later, Serg!” Bucky threw a peace sign up, still not looking at Peter directly, and the twelve year old scampered off to Steve’s car, pulling the keys out of Steve’s hand as he ran by.
He said it like a mantra,
hey guys! this is not an update. sorry for playing with your feelings if you expected it to be.
, he promised, and he almost believed it himself; in the years that he served, Mary spoke highly of him to Peter, so whenever he was visiting home, Peter held no resentment toward him. Instead, Steve would help him with his school projects and take him to ice cream and let him watch movies Mary was less inclined to agree with.
The boy shook his head. “I’m here alone,” he admitted quietly. “What about you?”

He drove himself and Peter through the clogged 5:00 traffic, laughing as Peter called out letters on street signs in a weak attempt to play
“Venti cold brew with two extra shots of espresso for Tony?”
Peter laughed, but Ned decidedly did not. “You scare me,” he said, voice so deadpan Peter knew he wasn’t lying. That only made Peter laugh more. “Dude,” Ned hissed at him. “She’s scary.”
, and it’s sweet, cheesy, disgusting, very Brom Com-y, but Tony’s still just happy anything is happening at all. Rhodey’s home.
“You ready?” Rhodey asks, and Tony wants to say yes, wants to get the hell out of there so that they can pick up right where they left off, halfway through an episode of

“Coming home,” Steve answers. “Born and raised in Brooklyn. What about you? Who are you waiting for?”

After two Friday’s, they left for the shelter. It was the same one they went to after the last eviction, located close enough to Peter’s school for him to walk if the second job Steve intended to get required him in the mornings. Peter never disliked shelters (another thing Steve loved about his kid: his flexibility) and often, in fact, looked at them like a new, fun adventure for him and his dad to muscle through.
“I got you, Stevie,” he said, and it’s light but it’s full of something Steve didn’t understand, too.
At dinnertime, the two of them sat together, and talk about their day; Peter had a presentation in his Spanish class on direct and indirect object pronouns, and Steve’s class had to turn in their rough drafts for the art show in two weeks. Steve asked Peter if he was alright with Steve getting a second job, and though there really isn’t
He sniffled, and smacked Bucky on the back with everything he could, hoping it conveyed everything he couldn’t find the strength to say out loud. “I’ve got you, too,” he responded. Bucky pulled away and smiles.
, he corrects, because he shouldn’t get to have nicknames for her anymore, not after he fucked everything up -- were good, sure, but he always knew it wasn’t meant to be. In the quiet early mornings, when Virginia was sleeping peacefully and Tony was struck with fear that was only halfway rational, the shifting from the body next to him provided him less comfort and more a sensation of deadweight against his scarred and torn arm. He would suffocate some nights, the pain in his chest on the wrong side of too-tight; it wasn’t Virginia’s fault. Tony was fucked up --
Find another child to harass, I will be sitting here, in peace, ignoring you completely-”
During lunch, Peter sat with Ned and Michelle; the latter of which had recently joined them at lunch time after Peter was really nice to her in Academic Pentathlon for the entire school year. Michelle was quieter than Ned and Peter were, but she was really funny in a dark and kind of mean way. Peter didn’t really mind it at all, honestly.
Steve and Tony both turn, virtually at the same time, to face the direction the two oh-so-familiar voices, and Tony is only a little stunned to see a seated Rhodey being pushed by a long hair, one armed, Jesus man. Tony beams, even if there’s a pang in his chest at the sight of a wheelchair skidding across the airport floor with the strongest man Tony had ever known in tow.
Peter pulled his bottom lip beneath his two front teeth. He chewed on it for a moment, and Steve would scold him for it if he wasn’t already feeling
in perfect condition, and, worst of all, he couldn’t text Peter to ask because, yeah -

The kid looked over him, eyes trickling over Peter’s face and body studiously, as if he was drinking in every one of Peter’s cells to try and understand him. Peter’s chest clenched for a second, and he wasn’t sure but it felt like a blush was making its way up his neck and cheeks. Then, after a moment, the kid grinned at him, brighter and more genuine than the smirk that’d been on his face moments before.
side. Other parents did not have that luxury. This meant Steve often suffered at the hands of an angry email sent by a poor student’s guardian, who was truly baffled that not turning in any of the assigned work would result in a grade drop. Steve, more than once, had to explain that homework actually
Eventually, Peter was only a foot away from it, and as soon as he was able, he reached out to grab the donut swiftly, but before his fingers even brushed against it, another kid’s nimble hands snatched it away. He looked up at them with a surprised, even betrayed stare, and a pout formed over his lips. He opened his mouth to speak, but blinked in confusion as he studied the floppy haired boy in front of him.

Peter left for school pretty soon after that. He ended up being a little bit late because it was, unsurprisingly, extremely hard to convince himself to leave the conversation he was having with Harley. He walked to school in the morning - it only took 20 minutes or so, generally - and pretty much spent the entire trek thinking about Harley.
, but the words felt like they were floating
Steve smiles when he starts to respond and it’s so soft that it leaves Tony dizzy and starstruck in a way that he’s probably never felt before. “Apparently, because I know very little about technology, I’m an honorary grandfather.”
Bucky came downstairs about ten minutes before Peter left for school. Silently, he poured himself a cup of coffee and slumped onto the kitchen table. Peter’s nose was buried in a book, but he looked up at Bucky when he crumpled into his chair, and giggled.
She says something to her coworkers that Tony can’t quite catch -- though he does happen to overhear some things like
Peter blushed, and Steve
“See you tonight, then,” he answered, no longer looking at Steve and studying the floor instead, like if he stared long enough, Steve would change his mind. His voice was monotonous too, and Steve had never thought that it pissed Bucky off whenever he left until
“Hey,” Peter said as they walked towards their seats, “I never got your name. I’m Peter.”
“You too,” Tony replies, but his tongue feels heavy and his mouth feels dry. He wonders if his eyes are as wide and heart-shaped as they feel. “Uh, come here often?”
Peter wrapped his arms tighter around Steve’s waist and pushed his forehead further into his father’s sternum. “You’re not doing

Steve nodded and slumped over the desk. “That’d be great, thanks, May.” Just then, Clint came bouncing around the corner with two curly heads of hair following close behind.

Tony walks for a few minutes, destination highlighted in red like a thumbtack in his mind. He knows exactly where he’s going, when he’ll be there, how to get there on time, and everything --
In response to Steve’s sort of lie, Peter narrowed his stare, and Steve watched as his big, brown eyes focused on Steve’s blues. “Captain Dad, sir, I’m ‘a need you to be real with me here. No bullshit.”
What if Harley was, like, 16? He didn’t
Tony waits to check Steve’s contact until he gets home. Rhodey doesn’t let him text and drive, a rule which Tony
“Dad?” said a young voice behind him, cutting through his mind. He spun around to smile, only half fake, at the boy in front of him.
“Rhodey too,” replies Tony. “While we wait, why don’t you tell me about yourself? What are you doing since you’ve come back?”
“How’re you feeling about starting high school soon, Wade?” Ned asked conversationally, picking at the unidentified chopped vegetables Peter gave him with a scrunched up nose.

, because as much as Bucky (and Sam) loved him (and Steve), donuts were kind of expensive.
“Bye, Uncle Bucky,” Peter chirped, throwing his arms around Bucky’s neck. Bucky chuckled and grabbed Peter’s forearm with his prosthetic, patting Peter’s face on his shoulder with his non-metal arm.

. Peter swallowed, and dropped his hand in defeat. “Sorry,” he offered weakly. “You can have it.” The smirk - which, now that Peter thinks about it, was probably less of a conscious thing and more like the natural state of his face - dropped from the boy’s lips and he furrowed his brow instead.
reruns playing softly in the background, the T.V. a source of dim light in the darkness of the night, their Chinese food cold in their lap and chopsticks mostly abandoned in their hands, Bucky asked the question he asked every time Steve’s here: “How long do you want to stay?”
“We could put chilli flakes in the- Oh! Hey, Steve,” Clint said cheerfully, if not a little bit breathless. “These monsters enlisted me for pranking. I was forced to do it, I definitely did not agree slash volunteer to partake on my own volition.” Clint definitely directed that last part to May, who sighed, but was grinning nonetheless.
“I know you think this is like, the worst thing ever, but it’s not. We’re saving up for a good place. A better place. I’m not upset or bitter or anything, Dad, but I - I kinda miss you. We used to eat breakfast together, but now you work after school, so you do all the prep and grading before school, so I never see you anymore.” Peter blushed at his admission, like he didn’t mean for it to come out that way but the words barrelled through his lips before he could stop them.
and Steve thought he might be able to impress some kids and make more friends at the shelter with all the knick knacks he has). Once everything they needed was separated from everything they didn’t, Steve started to pack himself a bag for the shelter. He figured, if he left something behind, Bucky was only a call and a twenty minute drive away.
Instead, he said, “Not long.” It was easier to lie like that, it came to him like it was a part of him, rolled off his tongue like it’s always fit there so perfectly, like it was meant to tumble out and explode in front of their eyes like a star. “If it’s okay, I can pack up all our crap, leave the less important stuff in the garage and take the rest with us to a shelter. Probably two weeks here is all we need.”
Steve didn’t hate work.
“No,” Steve lied, ignoring the look May was giving him. “I just got back. Haven’t even made it to the room yet.” He shrugged his shoulders, gesturing to the bag he’d not yet put down; he was far too distracted by the idea of Peter being hurt or lost or worse. “Don’t worry about it, bud. What trouble are you causing?”
coconut milk and fruit. Why order perfectly good coffee at a very famous coffee shop when I could get sixteen ounces of pure fucking sugar?” Tony smirks. Daisy snorts, graciously unoffended by Tony’s antics, and leans back to look at the drinks being made out of Tony’s line of sight.
made him the proudest dad alive. He only ever did homework because it counted to his grade, but it never really helped him learn anything, because he’d always been smarter than the other kids his age. Steve worried about him, sometimes; worried that Peter would start feeling all empty and bored, with the lack of actual work he had to put in for school. He was attending a STEM school, Midtown School of Science and Technology, but still in the top of his class without even trying.
He glared at wade as he turned around. “Wade,” he scolded half heartedly. “Warn a guy next time, okay?” Wade only giggled and sat down next to him -
Steve spun on his heels, and Peter followed, curling himself into Steve’s side while his father wrapped an arm over his shoulder. “I dare you to call him James to his face,” Steve said with a wink.
“Yeah,” Peter responded. “And, uh, you too, Clint,” Peter added, a very clear afterthought. Clint was fully unbothered by this, and was watching with May and Steve as the two boys had their little
These days, Peter was growing to be like a mini Mary. He was snarky like her, funny and smart. He liked science - something Steve
, Steve reminded himself whenever the daydream sucked him underwater.
Peter blinksed “Okay,” he said slowly. He nodded, and then added, “They - um - they have good juice. I’m gonna get some. Do you want any?”
Michelle rolled her eyes at Wade’s swearing, but didn’t comment on it. Peter, on the other hand, had never been afraid to get on Wade about it. “You’ve got such a potty mouth,” he said, stuffing his mouth with the sandwich he picked up from the lunch line. “My dad said he’s gonna kill you if you keep cussing in front of me.”
They talked for a while. Peter learned that Harley was smart, maybe even smarter than anyone Peter had ever met before. Harley said he liked to build stuff, and Peter said he liked to blow stuff up. Harley laughed at all of Peter’s jokes, picked at his food when Peter asked about his parents, smiled in thanks when Peter changed the subject and asked about his robots instead; he talked really fast when they were on the topic of science, apparently hated math but loved engineering (which Peter was pretty sure had more to do with math than science, technically), and he waved his arms around passionately when Peter asked him about the best robot he’d ever built. (It was a robot named Ab-E, like his little sister, who he refused to mention beyond
“No, Bucky, not at all.” He rushed forward, put his hands on both of Bucky’s biceps. Bucky’s eyes flicker back up to meet his own. “You’re the best. Seriously. Peter says that you’re a god amongst mere men. I think that’s like, high praise.” Bucky laughed, and it was wetter than Steve wanted it to be, but he thought anyway,
The line moved slow, but the longer the wait was, the more Peter craved that stupid jelly donut - and it was the
as a parent and father and caregiver, Peter had remained as bubbly as ever. For the first two apartments, he was too young to understand why they were leaving, especially the second one, but Steve sat him down and explained the dangers of being poor tenants in Queens and Brooklyn when Peter was 10 and they were planning to leave the third apartment.
Almost immediately after, another person’s cry of, “Tony!” echoes through the airport.

And then Tony replies, as if on instinct, “Cute.” Before Tony can actually
Pretty much every lunch went this way. Peter had a countdown until summer, and there were only twelve days left, and Peter was very sure that this - sitting with these weirdos, listening to Wade blabber about how hot Peter’s dad was and to Ned groan about how gross Wade was and to Michelle complain about how annoying they all were,

But then Steve steps forward and says, “If you don’t mind.”
is his proudest heirloom, it’s the best thing he has, the most top-drawer, cream of the crop shit he’s ever done. Was it, at some point, very awful? Sure. Was that Tony’s fault? Probably. But does it do good -- even great -- things now, because of Tony? Fuck yeah it does, and really, to Tony, that’s what matters most. Maybe once upon a time Tony would have been embarrassed to slap his name on the company that sold weapons to terrorists, but now, he’s doing everything in his power to reserve that shitshow, so yeah -- he’s proud. SI is his baby, and maybe AI is Steve’s, and maybe that’s a sign.
