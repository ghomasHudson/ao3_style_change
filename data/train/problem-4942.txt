it return.  He would thank them, they assured him, as they bandaged their wounds and offered token analgesics for his “discomfort.”  He would thank them for heroically intervening and saving his life.
Rogers sighed.  “I’ll try not to,” he said, chewing on it oddly delicately.  “You should go home.  Get some rest.”
“Actually, it was,” Natasha chimed in.  Something in Steve’s shoulders relaxed as he spotted her lounging on a couch by a set of floor-to-ceiling windows, looking particularly modern in a flattering white shift.  Steve looked away, taking in the view, never one to ogle.  “Although there were some
The Vulcan looked up from the ground he was tilling, blinking once in surprise at Tony.  Tony did not wait for him to catch up; he leaped, tackling the Vulcan in a hearty embrace.  “Holy shit, you’re alive!”
any appendages left to feed you with if this keeps up,” he informed Marker, spraying off in the sink, badly startling Cadmium—Curium’s more docile red twin—at the bottom of the sink.  Ignoring Tony’s, “Caddie, it’s fine,
“No,” Dr. Banner grunted, evidently not in a forgiving mood.  “I haven’t.  I haven’t made contact with—”  Sucking in a breath, he deflated visibly.  “We’re fucked.”
The Avengers had piled like prairie dogs on the single mattress, which Steve considered luxurious for one man and pretty unforgiving for five.  Thor alone had claimed nearly two-thirds of the available space.  “What’s wrong with you guys?” Steve asked out loud, forgetting to check his own ire.  “What’s the matter with you, huh?”  His heart was twisting and twisting and twisting, but he kept his voice level and checked as he added, “You know, people
, and Tony bristled a bit at the notion but waved a hand impatiently.  “I haven’t had a drink in six weeks, give me a break.  Continue.”
,” Tony added, entertaining duct-taping him to the couch before resolving to just hope that he didn’t move.
Desperately afraid, Tony gripped his own collar, fingers trembling and cold.  He would not allow them to hurt him.  He had refused service for as long as he possibly could, begging Rhodey not to give into his own monster, the one that would say,
it all.  To explore strange new worlds, meet life in all its many forms.  Standing still was never enough for a being made of stardust.
Bruce rubbed his hands together anxiously, like he expected worse, but it never came.  He looked at Tony hopefully.  Tony waved a hand.
Tony drew in a shallow breath, entire body still tense with discomfort.  He seemed deeply uncomfortable.  So much of his chest was still exposed, open to the air.  Compared to the rest of his armor, the reactor
He shut his own eyes, but it was harder to ignore the sharp ache inside his chest, the metal encasement implanted in his ribs, like a dozen needles deep
Thor said firmly, “Nay,” and yanked Clint by the pant leg.  He crashed into the table, bringing the whole thing to the floor.
“We don’t get along, he’s Dad’s dragon, why should we?  Old Man hated me.  He’s fine.  He’s just hungry.  He wants to hunt.  He’ll be back.”
Steve was honestly amazed at how politely people of the future handled discord.  Being kicked out used to be rather literal.  Now, it meant a winding tour of the backside of the museum.
In the end, he was not sure the speech actually made a difference, but the farewell handshakes he received seemed warm, genuine.
Steve looked into Ashley’s eyes and saw a younger man, maybe fifteen, looking back, wide-eyed and uncertain.
, Tony insisted, teeth clenched hard enough that he was worried he would accidentally crack one.  He hated the dentist, hated the idea of needing a tooth filling, and somehow, that was the thought that distracted him, even more so than Rhodes’ ominous appraisal that he
“You know, what’s your number, wow-mine-too, let’s fuck.”  Tony hiccupped once, then toyed with the glass again, almost brought it to his lips before feinting at the last second.
“Big dumb lug,” Tony greeted, letting an arm flop over the side of the bed.  Marker nosed at it, scales warm and smooth, breath hot on his sleeve.  “Can’t go five minutes without me.  How’d you make it six months, huh?”
“I can do it,” Steve growled, head spinning but mind clear enough to recognize what Tony was getting at.
,” Dr. Banner spat from a short distance, dragging a hand through his hair.  Two sets of eyes regarded the frazzled doctor.  Dr. Banner began to pace.  “So is everyone on the
Tony clicked off the call before the static could give him a headache, then glared down into the muddy abyss.
“Just ignore him,” Natasha advised, eyes closed but, apparently, awake.  Must be a “living life on the run” thing.
“You’re human.”  At Stovok’s side-eye, Tony rolled his eyes and clarified, “We’re all genetic halves.  Half-human.  I am just two half-humans.”
“Never too early,” Tony said bracingly.  “Just stopping by to pick up Bruce.  Right, Bruce?” he called out, and Steve was surprised to see a sluggish but conscious Bruce shuffling barefoot across the floor, towards the kitchen.  “You’re a regular Amerigo Vespucci, aren’t you?”
Flushing the taste of that not-so-fond memory from his mouth, Steve thought about Howard poking around the twenty-first century, then shook his head at himself—Howard had made it there, all on his own.
Marker spat on him.  Tony grimaced at the oily muck covering his face and shirt, then glared at his dragon, who held his gaze, pitch-black, iris-less eyes expressing no remorse.
Thor approached, but rather than accepting the dish Steve held out to him, he simply eyed the two pigs thoughtfully for a moment.  Then he passed the bewildered keeper his disposable camera and before Steve could get out more than, “NoThor
“The very same,” Carter confirmed.  “The background radiation levels in the region are . . . quite high.”
This chapter takes place in the MCU version of 2012. It is staged at the 2012 North American International Auto Show, which is typically held in Detroit, in--January. Immersion ruined, I know. While I pride myself on details, I will admit that Natasha's red
Steve cheerfully shut the door on him.  “Half an hour,” he reminded, as he heard Tony grumbling to himself and shuffling out of the tub.
“Nice guy, what about him?  You got a problem with him?” Tony asked, purposefully misunderstanding Steve.  He then whistled, calling out, “Hey, Thor!  Thor!”  The god of thunder turned, lifting a hand in greeting.  Tony lifted a hand back.  “Good luck.”
Steve hated it; he took no pleasure in hurting others, even monster-others, from dream-worlds.  Even if it was the right thing, the only way out, he hated it.  He could never be a a medic, any kind of healer—his heart bled too easily, ached too strongly to intervene once the hurt started.  His eyelids sank again, and he thought he might fall asleep, shuffling a little to wake himself up, to keep the guard.
“Copper finishes,” Tony murmured, still ignoring him.  He rocked forward on his feet like he wanted to touch the metal finishes but did not dare.  “Bet it’ll be beautiful in a year or two.  Patina will fade in nicely.”
“To be ignored.  Ridiculed.”  Tony said the word quietly, so it lacked fangs, but he felt the sting of it, the way it cut his skin.  To be disbelieved by others.  “Seen as incapable of surviving on your own.”
Sighing tersely, more in disbelief than anger, Steve startled a little when the elevator began to rise.  He looked to Natasha, who had not moved, and then the ceiling, which did not answer.
“Of course,” the clerk said, turning away from Rico, who was gnawing on the edge of the towel, and leading them deeper into the store.
“I have a mission report to file, you have rest to recover,” Stovok said, but the bright green flush on his cheeks gave away his real affect away.
.  “Marker,” he said out loud, affirming it.  His vision seemed to tunnel, and for a moment, he saw Marker sitting by the grave of his own father, tail wrapped around the stone, abandoned.  He saw himself from a third-person perspective, younger and almost gaunt with his own grief, approaching the dragon, swaying with intoxication.
At last—at very last, when the friendly little clock said 4:01 A.M.—Steve managed to step on light footsteps to the window, peering briefly through the curtain at the luminous city.
Not that she was mean, no, but Steve had spent less than two weeks with her and already knew the Rule: Natasha got her own space.  Even Clint, who believed personal space was an affront to humanity, attempted to respect hers.
“I’m not crazy,” Tony hastened to explain, before Steve could have him politely taken away.  “I’m—wait a sec.”  He frowned.  “You really were.  There.”  He stumbled over the words.
When he awoke again, there was a warm hand in his own, the faint sound of a television sitcom.  There was also, weirdly, no pain.
you want?” he grunted, because he wanted to be anywhere but arguing with a fast-and-loose Tony clinging to his back.
“What’s there to bargain?”  Tony took another sip of his space juice, at precisely the wrong moment:
As expected, it shifted the conversation away, some of Tony’s openness shuttering abruptly.  “Well, of course not—if we were all rich, none of us would be,” he sniffed.  He stood up and left the bar.
.  Strangest of all was the haze surrounding it, a fine gossamer mist that reminded Tony of frozen snowfall, encasing the whole planet.
There was only the river, the blinding white sun, and the two men.  If the ghost of Barney Barton ever joined them, Steve did not know it.
send you back, we wouldn’t,” Tony said, his voice flat, devoid of its usual energy.  “We need you.”  And he started back the way they had come.
“It seems others have claimed this trophy,” Thor mourned, indicating a huge crocodile helpfully identified as a
Then he awoke with his chest in pieces.  The splintering noisy agonized feeling inside him was irrepressible.  It was hot, rampant, and fast-moving, like an overheating piece of machinery that needed to be cut at the cord, too dangerous to unplug.  He breathed shallowly through his mouth, too hurt to scream.
“Yeah.  Yeah, he did.”  Steve toyed over the idea in his mind, but it seemed more like a dream than a real proposition.  He shook his head slowly.  “I don’t know.”
They landed well outside the city, freezing cold despite the heat of July—it was always cold, up top—and thankfully unaccompanied.  Steve wobbled a little when he stepped back, legs stiff.  “You should be more careful,” Iron Man advised.  “You know, safewords are there for a reason.”
Eventually, the static calmed, and he drew in a few more calculated breaths, bringing his big machine of a body back to equilibrium.  Odds were good, between the two of them, that they could catch up to the others.  Clint and Thor were fast, but Bruce and Tony would be slow.  Yet the first words out of Steve’s mouth were not,
Steve gave him a pitying look, brief but there, before schooling his expression into neutrality, sitting against Snow’s hide and sketching, the picture of domestic companionship.  Snow was watching Steve intently, and Tony realized Steve was drawing her.  It made him feel ill.
But Natasha was not Tony, who bristled, or Bruce, who cowered, or Clint, who would have laughed in his face at the lie—or even Thor, who would have walked away.  No, Natasha just said, “It’s not help.  It’s trust.”
Shaking his head in mute anguish, Dr. Banner stepped aside to snarl at the oddly-colored vegetation.  “Any idea where we are?” Tony asked the half-Vulcan, who stood slightly apart from them, looking out over the cliffside at the ocean.
“Dr. Banner declined my offering,” Stovok said simply.  “And as Senior Medical Officer, I am . . . subordinate to his prognosis.”
, but when it comes to you, I’m out of my fucking head.  I just. . . .”  He shook his head.  “I’m happy for you.”
“I’m right here,” Steve shouted back, faint but audible, and Tony nearly lost his grip in surprise.  He looked around frantically.
Bruce glowered at his hand, then him.  “Take a bite,” Tony insisted.  “I’m gonna call it a Nibiran snowball.”
After a solid hour of gladhanding, he finally caved to his baser instincts and took refuge behind a hot dog stand.
“No—I replaced my Bentley with a Corvette,” Natasha replied.  She tossed a set of keys into the air; Tony caught them, frowning severely.  “Race you to Chicago.”  Then Natasha turned the wheel, revving the engine.
, and he had balled up all the feelings inside him and ripped open the trap with his bare hands.  Stillness won out.
The danger of a good politician, he mused.  Like Stark, Cuff was charming without being overwhelming about it, never so in one’s face he could not be evaded.  He made one want to lean in to listen: even Thor sat silently next to the Mayor, listening to Cuff off-hand Chicago’s history.  “It’s been a long journey.  But it is as they say: ‘A house divided against itself, cannot stand,’” Mayor Cuff said.
“Unclear,” Stovok said neutrally, unreadable behind his opaque mask.  “Federation documentation for this area is limited.”
Steve looked at him blankly for a long moment.  “You are a piece of work,” he said, and then Steve left him,
Backtracking, Steve paused outside the second guest bedroom and let out a relieved sigh at the sight of his husband, hunched against the headboard, facing the far wall.
“There is a great deal of . . . danger, surrounding this planet,” Stovok explained patiently, careful not to violate the prime directive any more than they had simply by landing on their planet.  “This armor protects us.”
“Tell Stark it won’t kill him to wait a little while,” Clint said, having shaken all the dust off his coat and replaced it, ready to go.  “He can be bored in Alaska like the rest of us for a few hours.”
“I know that,” Tony said, because he did.  He knew that Stovok was safe.  He shook his head at himself.  “Yeesh, I’m sorry, pal.  Almost left you behind.”
“Foot massage,” Tony deadpanned, wiggling his toes.  Steve gave him an unimpressed look.  “What?  It’s Christmas.”
Steve was silent for the span of a few breaths.  “I waited,” he said at last.  “And when waiting wasn’t enough. . . .”
Tony sighed a little, but waved him on.  He hated feeling weak, but at least Rhodey helped him get settled at an upright angle before stepping through the door, giving Steve a meaningful look in passing.
or not?”  Cap Bird glared at him, unrelenting, soulless, vibrantly colorful.  “You said it, not me.”
.  Not merely to humans, but all life forms, particularly primitive ones.  Tony had never met or even heard of a “Nibiran.”  Perhaps Stovok had a point.  But: “Won’t we get swept away with the tide?”
listings, skirting around the table buoyantly.  Steve took a seat opposite Bruce and fixed his gaze on the skyscrapers, listening to the resident genius proselytize:
Stovok blinked once, slowly, and then the furrow deepened.  “I have been kissed.  That is not a kiss.”
, but Tony gulped down a shallow breath, anyway.  “Stark!” Thor said, tears in his eyes, gripping Tony in a surprisingly gentle hug that almost pushed the pain aside.  “You return to us!”
When time was young, the seeds of celestial life had been cast far and wide, along with the ever-expanding universe.  Over the coming eons, life would reach out to itself, reconnecting and crosspollinating, occasionally reimagining itself.  Life would expand in order to prevail over every extinction.  Life would boldly seek out its own kind, yearning to experience the things that could not be encapsulated in words.  No matter its quarrels with itself, life would persist by sheer number: no war could eradicate every last member, every tiny seedling from existence.  There would, somewhere, somehow, remain an untouched corner of the Universe.
Finally, he stepped forward.  Tony shifted his weight, intending to help rope up Marker, but Steve moved past them.  Tony opened his mouth to call after him, but Steve simply moved to Snow.  She dropped a shoulder for him, and in a streak of white, they disappeared into the sky.
Kind of reminded him of shawarma, he thought, heart filling with fondness.  Boy, that had been a treat.
“Tony.”  There it was.  The Cap he knew.  Sharp, clipped.  Not on his side.  Tony’s mouth twitched into a frown.
Bruce thoughtfully picked up a puzzle piece.  Steve resisted the urge to give both of them a proper dressing down on time management.  He could already hear the scoff of
Tony blinked once in surprise.  The door slid shut, the only trace of Steve’s former presence.  “J.A.R.V.I.S., lock it down,” Tony ordered, tossing the broomstick aside.
Foolish—cats had no concept of time.  Steve found the egg timer, wound it, and held it in front of Rico instructively.  “Five minutes,” he explained, setting it on the counter.  He picked up the plated sandwiches.  “Try not to pee again,” he told Rico.  Rico made no promises.
“Where’s my birthday kiss?” Clint pouted, then took off with a yelp matching Lucky’s as Natasha gave chase.  “Uncle, Uncle!”
Spotted, hunted, painfully alone, without friend or guiding light in the world, he could neither advance nor retreat without putting himself in a more vulnerable place.
“I feared you would say as much,” Anij said, drawing both their gazes.  “Offlanders rarely think of anyone but themselves.”
“Aye?  You have more suitable accommodations prepared?” Thor asked, with enough hopefulness Steve felt like a jerk for replying:
Tony huffed, “Yes, they got rid of polio,” like Steve had asked if the sun still rose to the east.  Then he paused.  “I’m sorry, what
“Gosh, that is easier,” Tony said, in the tone of one taking notes on the side, pulling out a chair.  Leery though he was about setting down the shield, Steve did the same, resting the shield against his own knee and surveying the wreckage of Thor’s breakfast, ignoring an errant inquiry from his own stomach.
“I am a role model to all my nieces,” Clint told him proudly.  “And I could kick your ass, any day of the week.”
Moody after PT, Tony had stared out the window and asked, “They really sent you to lift my spirits?”
Steve grunted in affirmation.  Then he downed two gallons of water, inhaled a dozen burgers, and finally sank back in the booth with a gratuitous sigh.
He was already home free—one hand on the threshold.  Tony flicked off the lights, hoping to send a message.
Another long moment passed.  Then, restless, Tony picked up Steve’s hand and splayed it.  Steve let him.  He was used to the fascination, the detached interest in the flesh-and-blood machine.  At times, even
,” Tony insisted, fumbling for a shoe and chucking it with force at the ceiling.  “’m the thing that goes
“You brought us to a farm?” Clint repeated incredulously.  He stepped out of the car.  The rest of the gang followed suit—even Bruce, who had been valiantly pretending not to exist for thirty minutes.  Steve resolved to bring the poor guy out of his shell—right after he corralled Tony, who was moving confidently in the direction of the barn.
Steve looked his fill for a moment longer, drinking in Tony’s distraction.  There was a softness to Tony’s stance, an indefinable carelessness, that belonged on a man used to ruling the world.  Both hands were stuffed in his pockets, but both shoulders leaned in, longing, aware.  Underneath his shirt, the arc reactor glowed blue, brightly enough that Steve worried about it drawing attention.  Yet there was no trepidation in Tony’s face: he seemed pleased to be there, enamored in a quiet, undemanding way.
He hit the table again in a semi-controlled fall.  And to Steve’s astonishment, the armor on his hands began to retreat, like paint melting down a canvas, revealing a man underneath.  Yet the metal had scarcely retreated to his forearm before it sprung up again, covering his fingertips.  A shiver wracked the metal monster.
“Oh, it’s not all about you,” Steve cajoled, deflecting the elbow Tony tried to throw into his gut easily.  “Don’t be such a spoilsport.”
he was gonna get.  Still: “I think a dam—woman.  A woman.  Should.  Be able to—make her own path.”  And this time, she did not spare his foot-in-mouth syndrome as he added, “Not just vote—that’s real swell, all women, they should vote, everybody should vote, it’s a—you know, the Romans—”
There was a prolonged silence.  Steve’s chest ached; with sympathetic pain or simple despair, he did not know.
A different ache tugged at Steve’s chest, a bowstring-taut longing for something he had not pulled in a long little while.  For months, he had dreamed of being discharged, sent home, at last permitted to return to a semblance of a normal life.  It had never mattered, in the sanctuary of his subconscious, that
Even as Tony watched in horror, Stovok landed on the rocks, gripping on with surprising strength.  Tony exhaled sharply.  The Nibirans were all watching intently, chattering among themselves.  The Nibiran cluster below paused to look up at the commotion, then paused to simply watch Stovok climb down, hand over steady hand.
Tony pinched his own nose briefly, then popped open the egg carton and pulled out a clean egg.  “I mean, if I were to, I don’t know,
“Your theory is sound,” Carter allowed, “but does not allow for the radiation surrounding the target area.  Even long-range telekinesis requires a clear sightline.”
Hello, hello, my friends. 🐼❤️ I apologize for the delay! Been having some trouble with my heart, but there's little I can do but endure. And write this fic! Which brings me joy, even on my darkest days.
While Iodine’s departure rattled Steve—he neglected to check in on Tony for so long that Tony went looking for
level of duplication, never mind in a separate Quadrant.  And after the Talosian illusion, Tony was even less inclined to believe his own eyes.
“What is?” Steve prompted, when Clint waited—waited, just to know that he was not talking to empty air.
Steve looked down at him.  Then, slowly, he folded down next to him.  “Be nice,” Tony added.  “To have that.  But I don’t need God, I have
shifted from foot-to-foot, pillaged a third sandwich, walked very literal circles around people.  He was outwardly busy, on the move; Howard had always been more quiet, reserved.
At a loss for what to say, Steve did not respond immediately.  His legs had fallen asleep, but Steve would be damned if he moved, left Tony stranded, to the wolves.  “You know, I gathered that,” he managed.  After all he had helped do, orchestrate, he deserved it.  He envied Natasha’s ability to do what was hard; he was exhausted, weak, when it came to his team.  Hurting them was unbearable.
“. . . Great,” Tony said, stepping aside to give Thor access, then doing another loose torso movement, swinging his arms, marveling in it.  Steve knew the feeling, waking up
to see him, but at least they were wearing Stark hoods.  “Both breathable and frightening”—and very popular with the kids.  Adults by-and-large preferred the more reserved beekeeper hoods, but the kids really liked the damn bird masks.
He ate his fill and was wordlessly passing along coconut after coconut when Dr. Banner wheezed his way to the top.  “Brucey!” Tony greeted, with surprising affection, appetite sated and feet plenty warm.  He held out both arms.  “You’re alive!”
Clint pulled something out of his pocket, examined it, and replaced it.  “No distress signal.  Must’ve just been a wellness check.”
Tony struggled not to sprint down the rocky pathway, moving quickly, ignoring the indignant clicks and whistles behind him.  He felt energized and lazy at once, capable of swimming to the bottom of the ocean—or lying in the cold sun with his new Nibiran family.  He used the boost to carry him across the rocks, carefully
Barton sighed behind his helmet but returned to the ship as asked.  Thor nodded at their alien hosts, who were gazing at his pockmarked form in scarcely disguised wonder.
“Who needs an expensive waterpark when you’ve got a two-dollar manual car wash in your local area?” Tony muttered, putting his arms behind his head.
Stovok shuffled back into the cave on his back, pulling himself in.  “I believe now is the time to proceed with Plan A,” Stovok announced, almost brightly.  “Unless you have a compelling counterargument?”
“I will take that as a compliment,” Stovok said, and released Tony’s hand, but only so he could roll over, latching on with the same strength as he began to shuffle out of the tunnel, belly-down.  He was fast, and Tony barely had time to think,

“We’ve got thirty hours until we reach our destination, you might as well tell me now,” Tony told him.
Stovok visibly sat up straighter, as if breaking from a trance.  “You are warp-capable?” he asked softly.  At his side, Thor wolfed down food, unimpressed, but Romanova paused beside Tony, and Tony knew his own expression was gob-smacked.
“Yeah, yeah.”  Steve replaced the landline, though he forgot to untangle the cord first.  Idiot.  Wonderful idiot.  His idiot.
He did not respond to his own name.  He found the white dragon, lounging in the freezing space—the west coast was warm, but Snow came from the north, and she preferred the arctic chill that they had so carefully upheld for her.  She had four hatchlings around her—purple Iodine, blue Actinium, jet black Barium, silver Ferrum.  Her black eyes bored into him, full of noiseless nothing.  There was no compassion, no sorrow, no hint of surprise or curiosity.  If she cared about the fate of his dragon, it did not show.
not fair,” Tony insisted, already analyzing the cabinetry to climb after it, never mind that it was a bowl of raw flour, maybe with a hint of sugar for good measure.
Listening to Tony talk, Steve felt almost . . . real.  Not merely a passenger flying by on an invisible train, hoping against diminishing hope that the next stop would take him home, but a part of the equation, of the real and now.  A quiet but very cynical part of him agreed with Tony’s assessment of S.H.I.E.L.D.: they wanted him badly, and
Thor examined the image.  Then he indicated the red plates, offering charitably, “Stark would—like their armor.”
Grumbling inaudibly, Tony grabbed a carton of two-percent milk from the fridge and took a direct swig.  Why?  Because he
“I will catch up with you at a later time,” Thor said distractedly, reaching into a pocket and retrieving all five tennis balls with a massive hand.  “Do not lose these.”
They popped open the trunk, folded down some seats, and suddenly had a lounge space.  Thor still opted to sit on the ground, Clint beside him, sharing a large bag of popcorn.  They ate voraciously; by the time Bruce walked back into view, clutching three more bags to his chest, Clint and Thor had already finished the first one.
“You people are out of your minds,” Steve said, shaking his head and breaking off another piece of muffin for himself.  “Absolutely mad.”
Taking a chance—Tony had already had an opportunity to flip through it, at his own leisure, no less, at the Falls—Steve handed it over.  Tony cracked it open halfway, to two perfectly blank pages, and pulled the charcoal pencil out of the cover.
, “What isn’t?  What isn’t broken in this body?”  Already out of steam, he let his arm sag, and Steve reflexively, almost without thinking at all, slipped under his slumping arm, propping up the metal man.
“Yes,” Tony said, but Clint was already pulling out his telephone to prove it.  “There’s no time,” Tony interrupted, shooing him away.  “Get in, we’re going to a movie.”
Update: Fixed the jaw! (Dislocation finally relocated—praise be!) Unfortunately, the head pain I assumed was purely jaw pain has morphed into full blown illness. When it rains, it pours, kids. Be well out there.
Rolling his eyes, Tony said, “I didn’t make him up.”  He pulled out his telephone, then pocketed it again, saying firmly, “No, you know what?  You have to earn it.”
“Yeah,” Clint said, pulling out his own telephone.  “She sent me a message last night.”  He let the mystery dangle.
Cap tried to push him upwards from under the arms, but Tony whined in real pain and he stopped.  “A little help?” Cap pleaded.
“Tony, I’m home,” he called out.  He took off his jacket and nearly killed himself and Rico, hanging it on the rack, as Rico investigated the bags like he had not been present for their purchasing.  Deciding not to chance trouble, Steve scooped him up and hurriedly limped upstairs, ignoring the mean throb in his leg—he’d cut it off before he wasted another second, now that he was so close.  “Tony?”
“. . . My point is, it would be advantageous for such an asset to remain in prime condition,” Carter finished.
Thor plucked a jar of M&M’s off the shelf, scooped out a tiny handful, and popped them in his mouth.  He chewed them slowly, then beamed.
looked.  He had never made the mistake of writing actual notes, but it was still a window into his soul.
, Steve thought, scrolling down the window and resting his elbow on the sill, chin in lackadaisical hand.
Steve continued vacuuming the kitchen floor.  Tony spotted the power cord and gave it a good tug, yanking it out of the wall.  The vacuuming ceased.  Steve went still.
Tony shuffled the deck of cards once, silent, thoughtful, then said suddenly, “What’s your excuse?  Did a pretty girl stand you up?”
Tony snorted an indifferent laugh, looking around for actual tape to cover the bloody hole in his arm.  Steve set aside their differences to fetch some for him.  Good man.  “Fuck you,” Tony told him anyway, wrapping gauze around his entire arm.  He hated pulling tape off his skin.  The less pain, the
—before coming to the bitter conclusion that he was, somehow, someway, in charge of them.  Or, at least, he felt like it.  Their safety was his priority.
He was struck with the weight of the Moon, the texture of it: not gray but liquid stone, malleable.  He could
Rico’s purring was audible.  At first, Tony’s sobbing was subaudible, a hitch to his breath that quickly became vocal, an open-mouthed wailing as he lifted his good hand to cover his eyes, hiding.
engages in five-year missions,” Captain Carter interrupted.  “You, yourself, have recently experienced the detrimental effects of space travel—”
Maybe that was the real reason they had come.  Nothing beat fish fresh off the river, although how Tony had foreseen Clint Barton deciding, on a whim, to go fishing, was beyond Steve’s humble, non-genius mind to wrap itself around.
Tony held up a hand.  “Say no more.”  Only a Vulcan would learn the literally barbaric tongue of the sworn enemy of the Federation as a
has been thus far provisional.”  Tony’s heart began pounding in his chest.  “Without formal training in the management of the effects of long-term spaceflight—”
“In that case—”  Natasha turned back to the car, then swapped out his original cap with a stiffer baseball hat.  “There.”
“Then I will respond semi-urgently,” Tony replied, looking out at the ocean, drink dangling from a hand.
“Perhaps.”  Then, sobering, Thor halted, dragging Steve to a forceful stop beside himself.  Tony halted, too.
Slinking over to a bench, he put his head in hands, suddenly grateful for the stupid hoodie, which hid him from plain view.  Thor approached, seemed to weigh a few responses, before wordlessly retreating.
Natasha just said, “You turned the world’s biggest children loose in the world’s biggest sandbox.”  Then she smiled at them, with a sort of cocked-head sweetness.  “You really think they’re coming back?”
“I didn’t say—”  Steve sighed.  It was impossible to lie about it.  But that did not mean he could not tell the truth: “I don’t hate it here,” he impressed.  “I don’t hate
He parked his feet wide as two red river hogs immediately approached, snuffling around him.  “They’re hungry,” the keeper explained, tossing some apple slices at his feet.  Snuffling snouts immediately scooped them up.  “Here,” she added, handing over a silver dish, “don’t let them tip you.  They’re stronger than they look.”
,” he said, louder, spinning on his chair to look down at the perpetrator.  “Give a damn guy a break here, I don’t have my steel-toed boots on.”
“They have never been documented,” Stovok dismissed, lifting his hand off the pavement and frowning down at his three-fourths finished work.  “I am teaching the children falsehoods.”
Steve, who was equally as accustomed to night travel as day trips, did his best to ignore him, focusing on the road and the road alone.  Natasha had called up an electric map on the car’s dashboard, which would supposedly take Steve anywhere he wanted to go.  The coordinates were already locked in, so he just had to follow them.
Drawing in a stormy breath, Iron Man faced the camera, then pointed at it and warned, “If you do not get your Kevin shot in the next
Thor nodded once amicably, then braced a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve stood his ground.  “Very well.  I shall apply half-contact,” Thor announced.
Tony made his way to his private quarters and sat on the bed, shutting his eyes against a pounding headache, a reminder that while he may have the heart of a dragon, he did not have the resilience of one.
Recognizing there was no easy way out of this one, Steve sighed and took the box.  “Thank you, Jeanie.”
He startled when a small, warm, soft-bodied dragon slipped under his arm.  Green Thallium peered up at him, perfectly innocent, her small sharp claws perched on his belly.  In adulthood, she would be able to rip him open, yet even as he very slowly brought his arms around her, hugging her, she let him, ducking under his chin, feeding off his warmth.
“Listen to me,” Natasha said.  “You are dying.”  Twisting the point with an audible if faint crackle—a gargled sound creaked out of the helmet, and it was all Steve could do not to fling her aside as Iron Man lifted a palm limply towards her—Natasha went on, “You have to take off the chest plate.”
“No, no, no, no!” Clint chanted, as Tony rounded second base without slowing down.  “Not me, not me!”
Far more surprising was the feel of soft, human hair against the underside of his chin as Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s shoulder.  Steve did not shift to look at him, did not drink in the sight of Tony Stark without his armor.
Steve obligingly shut up.  The silence was loud—the cave amplified his own panicked breathing, but he could also hear the slower wash of Steve’s.  He focused on it, willing himself to be calm.  He was fine.  He was
“It is,” Tony insisted.  “Can’t use the full name, R1D1 is still here,” he said, indicating the golden dragon curled up in the corner, fast asleep by the fire.
They obliged.  When they reached another set of closed doors, Natasha scarcely reached for the keypad before the doors opened.  Another time, Steve might have said,
As the roar of waves on the shore became more pronounced, Tony shared, “Some paradise.  This is the coldest beach I’ve ever been on.”
For a few seconds, Steve focused on breathing and pushing down the pain to a tolerable ache.  Then he leveraged himself gingerly to a seated position.  Tony interfered, hands on his shoulder, and Steve growled at him a second time.  Tony relented, but only as far as to say, “Thor, how much do you know about medicine?”
Thor stepped into the vessel’s diminutive transporter.  “Take heart,” he said.  “Should the occasion arise . . . I shall kill whatever seeks to kill me first.”
Stovok glared at him, then looked down at the fruit.  He took it and took a careful, almost delicate bite.  Then he grimaced, an unexpectedly deep expression, and Tony laughed.
“I’m not that grunk,” Tony complained.  “I can recite . . . every play . . . William Shakespeare . . . has ever made . . . in order . . .
Steve waited with him, looking after Bruce and Thor.  “Nobody’s gonna believe any of this,” he mused aloud.
Tony was no fool, though; he leaned into it, soaked it in, let it hold him together like the splint holding that broken arm together.
Working with Starfleet was the dream of many Terrans, who looked up at night and saw paradise in the stars.  There was a planet out there that resembled every living being’s ideal, but getting to it across the unimaginable breadth of the void was the challenge of every starship.  No matter how desperate life was to disperse and find still more vacuums to fill, it inevitably clustered at waystations, planets where other lifeforms had already arrived.
Steve said in a disgruntled tone, “Not exactly room to spread your wings in the Army.  You wouldn’t last two days in basic.”
, its maw gaped thirty-inches-wide, enveloping his midsection in one bite.  If the armor had not been built to withstand even more frightening forces, the blow would have cleaved him in half; as it was, he felt teeth punch into the skin below the armor as the Nightmare swerved and plunged towards the Earth in a vertiginous drop.  With an unstable seal, the suit could not maintain pressurization; consciousness dropped out in the same maneuver.
, and laughed at himself, passing the fruit along.  He had no need for credits—the Stark legacy was six generations deep, and would carry on for another six, with Tony’s post-warp theories for manipulating space and traveling to the most distant vacuums already being prototypally implanted.
“Hello, prey,” Thor greeted jovially, stepping on board in his traditional battle armor and looking around the vessel with his typical
The tangible proof always amazed Tony.  Steve’s skin radiated healthiness; like stone wrapped in silk, he felt like an Olympian, straight from the mountaintop.  Michelangelo could not have carved a more perfect man in a thousand years.  The fact that Steve allowed him to
Rolling her eyes, sitting in the only other real chair in the room, Natasha flicked off the lights, pulling out her phone and chiding dryly, “Boys.  Don’t wake up the other patients.”
Tony turned around in his seat and snatched the newspaper from Clint, then cracked it open and glared at it like it had insulted his cardigan.  “It’s Portland,” he said with finality.
“Right,” Steve said, attempting to surreptitiously pry Peter off him.  “That’s—”  He sighed when Peter began sobbing again, switching to patting him on the back.  “It’s all right, son.”
Clint shrugged.  “Still got a couple magic tricks up my sleeve.  Give me a name and I will make it disappear.”
“That’s what I said,” Steve echoed, voice loud and muffled, scraping on the cave walls.  “Right back.”
Tony made a soft sound of amusement, then said, “She’s all . . . bark.  Hey, did you know . . . did you know, she . . . she’s
.  He breathed again, cursing Vulcan anatomy, feeling the softest, shallowest rise of a breath that would take almost a minute to complete before sinking down again.
Just an uncontrollable fit of giggles, unstifled and almost drowned out entirely by Clint’s raucous cackle.  Thor, ever one for good humor, grinned, still holding the hose.
"Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto" is Latin for "I am human, and I think nothing human is alien to me." It is from the play
, he begged no one, his knees, forehead buried against them, shaking with hollow resignation.  He was not afraid of the monsters—he knew what they intended, and that almost made it easier to bear their kindness; it was the truly unknown that frightened him most, the unquantified pain that alarmed him—but he was treacherously weary of them, of their ministrations, of their placid and strong efforts to communicate their will to him.
“Doctor.  You are becoming hysterical,” Stovok said, his voice hardening.  “Still yourself.  Or I will do it for you.”
“Almost there,” Clint said, as his sprinkle mountain grew to unstable proportions.  “Keep it coming.”
.  Refusing to give up, he followed the signs.  He was quickly intercepted by a second security guard, who informed him that he needed to go through a winding maze of blue tape, first.
Honestly, if Tony thought he would feel better with brute force on his side, he was wrong.  He really, really, really liked the Mark XX.  He did not want Steve Rogers, drugged out of his
Making was dangerous, Tony knew.  Especially in his line of work, where he worked not just with explosive matter but
Tempted though Steve was to let it play out, his inner commanding officer kicked in, and he grabbed Clint and Tony by the backs of the respective collars, holding them at arm’s length apart.  “Knock it
gambling,” Steve said, very disappointed.  His Ma had always impressed that risking what one had for more was the height of envy—being satisfied with little was better than reaching for the stars and coming back empty-handed.
“Your violation of the Prime Directive has not gone unnoticed,” Captain Carter admitted.  “Commander Stovok’s report aided in assuring Starfleet Command that the integrity of the people has been preserved, but there is still concern that your . . . untimely departure, may have altered the course of history.”
“This should be right up your alley, Stark,” Romanova chimed in, sitting in the copilot’s chair and running down the pre-flight checklist.  “You love sticking your nose in places it doesn’t belong.”
“Good,” Steve said, tucking the cat into an arm like a Christmas package.  “How much?”  He reached into his pocket with his free hand, producing his wallet.  Rico rubbed his cheek against Steve’s palm, then sank his teeth into it.
Tony knew that Steve’s presence had to be a dream, but he still was not expecting the tidal wave of pain to greet him when he finally regained consciousness.
It was easy—he simply ottered his way out of the tub, using towels to prop Tony’s head and shoulders up.  Steve could’ve done the job in six seconds if Tony had been wide awake.  He did it in less than a minute without disturbing Tony’s rest.
It surprised Steve that, even as he all but frog-marched Bruce to their penthouse suite, Steve did not think about slipping off his own shoes and joining him in another room.  Downstairs, Thor remained relentless, sitting in a hotel lobby chair across from Natasha, engaged in a spirited if one-sided conversation with Natasha about the nocturnal festivals on Asgard.  Tony stood nearby, rocking back and forth on his feet, like a paperweight bird that someone had pressed into motion and forgotten about.  Looking for that second wind, Steve mused, wondering if Tony was still rocking as Bruce flopped face first onto the bed.
“Juliet, the pleasure is all mine,” Tony said, with enough patented Stark sincerity that Juliet actually flustered.
He remembered feeling that small, that lonely, on the Front, after Bucky’s death.  It had seemed so simple, signing up for War, ready to do what was right, even if it meant dying for his country.  Living—that was the real challenge.  Persevering.
There were no words between them, no exchange of thoughts, yet he knew Marker’s wishes, for they were his own.
Tony was still talking, but Steve was busy imagining the view from the cockpit, had he failed to pin the yoke down: the city slowly peering over the horizon, anxiously awaiting his arrival as he neared with his payload of death.
Steve, who had been autopiloting the last five hours, forgot to brace for impact and went down hard.
“I thought,” Steve started patiently, but Tony held up a hand for silence.  For once, Steve obliged.
“That’s fine,” Tony said.  Steve held onto him, afraid he might actually collapse, his breathing was so erratic.  He wanted to drag him over to the rocks, sit him down, but Tony shook him off with grim resolve.  “We’ve got places to be.”
Over the pitcher’s mound, Clint and Thor were locked in a dead heat over what must have been the final tennis ball, with Thor holding one arm high in the air and Clint clinging to it tenaciously.  “Drop it,” Steve told them.  Neither Thor nor Clint relented.  Steve said again, “
Tony—still shoeless—took off.  Bruce, in solidarity, ran in the opposite direction.  The dogs went after Bruce, howling joyfully.
Steve looked up at Dr. Banner—who had wanted the serum so badly that he had risked it all and suffered the terrible consequences for it—and then back down at Tony’s drawings, losing himself in their intricacies.
He shivered, gulping down a mouthful of saliva, willing himself not to die.  He did not want to be heroically acted upon.  He did not even want to be congenially acted upon, coerced into actions he refused to take on his own power.  He had a right to
“Wow—wow, that’s neat,” Dr. Banner said nearby, with forced interest.  “That’s really—oh, hey, that’s sharp.  Wow.”  Tony looked over, but they were simply showing him their spears.  He looked down at the Vulcan on his lap and nearly dropped him as barely open lids looked at him.
“Finally,” Tony Stark said, looking up from the kitchen table, where all five of Steve’s unwelcome guests had congregated.  They had a board game open in front of them, although Steve did not know what it was.  “We’re wagering our souls, right?” Tony said, cutting cards.
As he entered the living room, Tony was struck by a feeling of—not triumph, precisely, but conviction.
, Junior Engineer Pietro Maximoff said triumphantly, “Congratulations to the Parker kid.  He has earned a beer.”
Steve gave him space—Tony had no room for anger, no space in his lungs to shout, but Steve knew the importance of being alone, sometimes—and Tony waited and waited as the stars peered out, one-by-one, and Marker did not return.
Whatever fight Tony Stark had on reserve had clearly been tapped out, Steve knew, but Iron Man still spat, “
Tony nodded in understanding.  He had heard the story before, even if he had been intoxicated at the time.  “Dugan and Falsworth,” he recited.  “Right?”
“I do not like that,” Stovok grumbled, sounding more pouty than angry as Tony pressed a softer kiss to his cheekbone, deliberately.  “Hm,” he said, and then, “Hm,” again, in the same thoughtful, almost detached tone, and then Tony kissed a pointy ear and Stovok flew off the bench so fast Tony fell forward.
,” Steve relented, waving a hand threateningly at him.  He practically stomped off after Tony, wondering what kind of nonsense was in Clint’s head that Steve needed to shake out of him.
Steve looked at Tony skeptically.  Tony wagged his telephone.  “I put a tracker on his phone.  I have
Tony just shook his head, approaching Stovok and offering a hand to help Stovok get up.  Stovok ignored it, putting a hand on the dirt and pushing himself upright.  Tony tried to tell the dread curling in his gut that it was typical Vulcan behavior and had nothing to do with his own breach of decorum.
—did not look at him as Tony sat down next to her.  Tony reached out and hesitated, putting a hand on the hatchling’s back.  It rippled with a shiver, but the hatchling did not move away, looking out at the water.
Steve bit the first rib hard on reflex, but Tony’s growl reminded him of their bargain, and he was more careful with the next bite.
“Getoffame,” Steve grumbled, gasping as he put his weight down on his right arm.  He let himself fall on his front, ignoring Bruce’s meek,
“I’ll do it,” Tony volunteered, seated on a picnic table, sipping at a coffee.  “Here, I’ll get it on video,” he added, pawing around his pocket.  Bruce watched Tony with alarm.  Thor stood off to the side, looking out at the river.
.  “You could get hurt,” Steve said, which was not much better.  Imagining Tony all crumpled up did awful things to him.  He would not let it happen.  “You need a suit.”
Shaking his head, Steve thought about calling out to him—but Thor seemed to have the situation under control.  “I got nothin’,” he said quietly.
Because there’s an Alien Invasion.”  Hearing it from a civilian perspective was admittedly surreal.  Steve listened intently, anyway, even though he bristled as Happy practically snarled, “And then I hear that

“Tony,” Steve pleaded.  “Just follow the rope.  The rope,” he added, closing Tony’s hand around it more tightly.  “You made it in.  You can make it back out.”
Tony smirked before he could contain it, flattening his expression back to neutrality.  “We can change that,” Tony dismissed, turning back to the windshield.  Steve swiped the hat from his head and replaced it on his own.  “Doesn’t match the
“I would never expect you to,” Stovok assured dryly.  “You have been an invaluable asset and would be missed on the
Clint introduced himself under his given name, as did, “Thor, firstborn son of Odin, future King of Asgard, guardian of the Nine Realms.”
There was plenty to focus on, and Juliet gave them even more.  “These are some of the most endangered animals in the world,” she introduced, and Steve thought,
He sank right to the floor, unable to bear his own weight, hands digging into his hair.  He did not care that it hurt, that the position was difficult to breathe through.
Kind of ironic, Steve mused, stripping the bed, that after such a fearsome argument over who got which room, they congregated in one room, regardless.  He had half-thought that after finding a place—following an hour-long sojourn of bothering various hotel clerks about their borderline conspiratorial lack of vacancies—that Clint might room with Natasha.  But he should’a known better, really.  It was miraculous that they had found
Then he took a seat on the bench, inviting with a hand wave Tony to do the same.  Tony sat right next to him, highly aware of his own unwashed garb, and waited for the Vulcan to speak.
“Gee, Rico,” Steve acknowledged, still holding his cat burrito in one arm and a rather eclectic assortment of cat items in various bags in the other.  “You know what I used to play with when I was a boy?  Sticks and mud.”  He shook his head to himself, but nevertheless nearly poked his own eye out on the cat “feather teaser” that kept swinging around inopportunely at every corner street.  “Rocks, if we were really feelin’ rich,” Steve added, shaking off once at the doorstep, fumbling for the keys.  He plugged the keys into the hole and turned the handle.  Gratefully, he set down the cat stuff—including litter, box, food and bowls, and accursed feather teaser—and finally unleashed Rico on society, even if society was a house of one.
“We have to stop,” Clint replied, leaning between the two front seats, looking ready to hijack the wheel at the first indication that Steve would not follow the signs indicating,
, Steve thought, shimmying through narrow icy lockers, barely wide enough to draw a breath in, listening intently for the shuffle of Natasha’s footsteps ahead.
Sputtering, Tony said, “OK, he’s the boss,” and stepped behind Steve, tangling a hand in the back of Steve’s coat for good measure.  “Tell him.”
When Steve said blankly, “I’m guessing it doesn’t have to do with an automobile?” Tony huffed and made a gesture for the journal.
, dammit—”  Tony sighed through his nose as the dragon successfully created a new, larger doorframe for himself, sniffing at Tellurium curiously.  In response, she sneezed on him.  Marker blinked as if he could not fathom what that meant before shaking his head violently and shambling over to Tony’s side of the bed.
The sky was turning pink and the air was cooling off before Steve realized Tony Stark had no intention of leaving a project unfinished.
Crossing the rocks, he stood beside Clint.  It was strange to Steve, to stand, not alone on the inside, burnt badly by his own grief, but on the outside of somebody else’s, a grief that had grown over, covered by years of new memories, overgrowth that could not be trimmed by the scythe of time.
“Anthony.  Edward.  Stark.”  Tiberius Stone stood in the doorway with an ear-to-ear smile.  “How long has it been?”
Tony Stark held his drink well.  But it was late and, three shot glasses in, even with a nibble here and there of the best spare ribs Steve had ever had, Tony was loosening up.  Not
Thor needed to learn, Tony had energy to kill, and Natasha knew enough card tricks to put a magician out-of-business.
“Fat chance.  But they’ll be waiting for you, if you miss ‘em.  Federation’s only putting the brakes on for—”
Tony actually got up to confirm it, glaring down at the hole at his feet.  He shrieked when a golden head popped up.  “What?” Steve asked.  “What’s the matter?  You change your mind?”
“Okay,” Tony said again, inspired.  He started to move away, and Steve let him without a fight.  Finally: a hint of
Tony was quiet for a time.  Listening to the reassuring cadence of Steve’s breath.  Sometimes, sharing a bed with a fellow monster was more comforting than frightening.  To know that he was vulnerable and would not be taken advantage of in his vulnerability.  That was a great gift.  “I do love you,” Tony assured, feeling ugly inside, like he was the monster, after all.  Pain made monsters of men.  “I love that you—”
It was only minutes before the hour when the President of the United States arrived.  Steve had time to shake hands and exchange a brief greeting before raising the flag at 0600 hours.
Gently, Steve closed the book.  Tony poured out a bowl of cereal for himself and began to eat, all in familiar quiet.  He often felt that Steve would be at home in a prehistoric world: modern machinations handled with preternatural ease did not a modern man
,” Dr. Banner wailed, even as Stovok ripped the spear out of his belly, pressed a heavy hand over it, and shoved Tony to the ground.  A second spear sailed overhead.  Tony hit the ground flat, breath knocked out of him.  He barely had time to register,
“. . . Enlightening,” Tony decided.  Chief Security Officer James Rhodes gave him a look of deepest exasperation.  “Not that I am not delighted to see you, my red-shirted friend, but I am wondering how you are—”
In this case, the phrase "If you are afraid of wolves, do not go into the forest" is spelled in Cyrillic: "Волков бояться - в лес не ходить."
Feeling a bit foolish despite being alone, Steve let himself lean in and sniff a lovely yellow flower—
with the future, that he would be seen as too unstable and locked up, in a nice little box, no doubt, three square meals a day, but locked up, all the same—
crossed Steve’s mind, but he brushed it off like an errant fly.  That much was already obvious.  Tony Stark was a very attractive man—attracted all kinds of things, money, fame, women.  “You ever get tired of it?” he asked, when Tony ignored the box.
For a single moment in time, he thought it might be the thing that split them apart, like a broad slate of ice, rent down the middle.  He saw the unyielding nature behind Natasha’s stillness, a history he would never be privy to, he could not earn.  He saw, too, the longing in Bruce for something like peace, a fearfulness at the sudden escalation.
“More,” Clint said, as an unruffled employee dumped an entire scoop of sprinkles over a bowl of ice cream before looking up at him expectantly.  “Keep going.  I’ll say when.”
“It’s twenty-twelve,” Tony said flatly.  “Give it a fighting chance, I bet twenty-eighty-eight will be—”
The townhouse was quiet, even with the creaking door, the creaking floor, and the bristling edge of a temperamental wind—a storm was brewing in the city.  Steve liked storms about as much as the next guy who made a living waiting for the dawn to break, but at least Rico purred against his chest, already happy to be out of the box.  (“You’ll want this,” the clerk had explained.  Rico had yelled at him the whole walk home, but New York was such a city that hardly anybody looked twice at the guy with the yodeling box.)
Sitting on the opposite bed, Steve said grimly, “If you’re not asleep in five minutes, I will put you to sleep.”
,” Tony insisted, pocketing his telephone.  “Same thing they use on those migratory birds.  Perfectly moral.”
.  He would be here, alone, until his wounds healed.  He would be here, safe, untouched, undiminished.  They could not demean him, sneer at his life’s choices, if they could not get to him.  Hide well enough from the monsters and even they would have to huff and give up, complaining among themselves how difficult Tony Stark was.  Resisting his salvation!
Tony, this Tony's reactor was ten years older and God only knew how deep inside his chest.  Every pressurized shove felt like it would puncture the heart.
Sitting on the front porch steps, Steve Rogers watched Tony Stark and Bruce Banner step out of the flashy car.  Bruce looked apologetic about parking on the grass.  Tony looked indifferent.
Stovok’s expression went flat, the dark green tint on his cheekbones creating a rather comical effect.  “I will wrongly assume you did not consume it.”
Stovok sat back on his heels for a long moment, looking at what he had made and the children had expanded upon, and then, at last, murmured, “I must finish what I have started.”
“Damn,” Tony said, hands off the wheel, examining Clint’s phony passport with admiration.  After five collective hours in the same vehicle, it no longer bothered Steve that Tony did not seem to need both hands on the wheel to drive.  But, after taking a plunge in the Niagara River, he was not sure it would have bothered him even if Tony
Then he heard a whistle behind him.  Turning, he saw Clint leaning around the open door.  “They got rhubarb,” Clint called out.  “Can we get some?”
“What’s the point’a all this?” Steve went on, gesturing at Thor, holding a rather large and very sad-looking teddy bear.  “Where’d you get that?  And what happened to it?”
.  Everything besides getting Tony's shirt loose, finding the fucking bleed evaporated.  Steve tore off the shirt, to fucking
models had been preferred on Earth for billions of years, and many seemingly disparate civilizations had been one people, long ago, before dispersing to the stars—but it still surprised Tony to meet one.
“Are you not capable of purchasing a small transport vessel for your own leisure?” Stovok pointed out.
“Your misplaced worry is a reflection of your kindness,” Thor called back.  “For that, I thank you, Stark.”  Then he turned and strode confidently back towards the museum.
the alcoholic you will ever be,” Tony Stark declared, sitting at the wooden bar beside Steve and thumping Steve on the shoulder with a closed fist, “and you can take
“Thirteen years after the last Great War, we left Earth behind,” Anij explained, seated in front of a large, empty hearth.  “That was two-hundred-and-thirty-nine years ago.”
“Good.  I’m gonna.”  Happy brushed off his hand on a napkin, then jabbed a finger at Steve’s chest fearlessly.  “You’re an unknown.  I got nothing, except you’re some kind of legend.  Got news for you, you don’t look much like a comic book character to me.”
“Might still throw up,” Tony muttered mutinously, finishing the coffee off.  Then he held out the mug to Steve.  Steve gave him a flat look but took it anyway.  He had scarcely turned his back to refill before he heard a soft thump behind him, turning in time to see Tony drag a pillow back over his head.
He scrambled upright at the sound of voices, reacting on pure instinct as he got down in front of the grate and shoved his head inside, looking down and deflating at the sight of Bruce.  “Oh, hey, Tony,” Bruce said, moving about two miles per hour faster than the average sloth but looking perfectly unperturbed by the claustrophobic quarters.  “I missed you.”
Carefully, Steve slipped off his coat and shoes, then tucked under the covers.  At least the helpful hotel clerks had found a room for them.  And they still had time left on the clock.
something.  His breath locked up in his chest; in real time, Steve yanked back his cowl, uncaring if someone thought he was a little gray around the edges, he would
When Snow appeared, she was not like lightning but smoke, wafting up from below.  She was unaccompanied, but Tony did not mind—with a careful jet, he lifted off Marker, floating away as the two dragons hovered before each other, two thinking beings exchanging silent words.
Nothing said “weird family reunion” like a party at Coney Island.  It felt like two-thirds of the city had turned up to catch a glimpse of Captain America, who did his best not to play favorites while playing semi-favorites.  He refused to kiss babies, but he tolerated a chaste kiss to the cheek from a swooning admirer or two.  A handsy dame grabbed him for a kiss to the cheek, and he recognized Natasha’s perfume.  “Don’t forget to have fun,” she told him.  He turned to look at her, talk to her, express his gratitude for a familiar face in a sea of strangers, but she was already gone, doubtless keeping an eye on things.  He did not know whether to be grateful or disappointed; grateful, that she was there, or disappointed that he could not enjoy her company.
“We got Banner,” Tony replied, accepting a high-five from Clint.  “Nick, he’s only Hulked out twice.”
“Here I thought you hated it,” Steve said dryly, frowning when Tony swiped the milkshake from him and took a gulp.  “You have your own.”
, really—vibranium in its pure form could absorb all vibrational energy, including sound, but as it was molded into even the most basic tool, it developed countless little weaknesses.
Next round, though, next round, Steve quickly slipped off two ribs before Thor even noticed they were there, triumphantly gnawing on them.  Tony just shook his head in wry amusement, picking up a stack of cards in one hand and a glass of scotch whisky in the other.
“This is a fever dream,” Tony said suddenly.  “It has to be.  I died, didn’t I?”  Then, groaning, he added, “There’s small talk in Hell.”
“Wouldn’t work, anyway,” Steve interjected, before Tony could do more than pivot suspiciously in Clint’s direction, who appeared to be approaching catatonia, gazing up at the stars.  Tony pivoted back towards Steve.  “Thor’s just a great chef,” Steve said.  “Those ribs were fucking amazing.”
“Met guys with bullet wounds that complained less than you do,” Steve told him.  Tony gave him the middle finger.  “That’s not nice,” Steve said neutrally.
When she tried to sell him something else, he insisted, “No, I don’t want any frills, I just want New York, dammit, a ticket to New York,” and was swiftly escorted by another security guard to a separate room, under the false promise of being reasoned with.
Steve exhaled his own long sigh, then had a seat in the chair at the farthest corner of the room.  Tony instantly felt too far from him, which was a stupid thought, except that—well.  There had been a moment, gripping Steve’s hand, when he had felt like everything would be okay.  But now, reality was cold, and hungry, and lonely, again.
He let it go, looking around the room.  Carol Danvers stood near the door, offering him a two-fingered salute.  He tried to mirror it automatically, his right arm stiff, mechanical, more rot than flesh.  “Urk,” he said eloquently.
“Careful, I have a knife, it could slip,” Tony dismissed, already carving another slice of his cake.  “I’m an
Steve’s look flattened.  “Oh, don’t give me that,” Tony said.  “Stop it,” he insisted, nudging Steve’s hip with his foot as Steve sipped his shake.  “I was being
In shouting distance, he called out, “STOVOK!” and the Vulcan looked up.  Although flushed green, he looked dauntless as ever, a huge silver something strung across his back.  As Tony halted, Stovok crossed the distance between them in long strides, easily outpacing the slow-moving Nibirans shuffling along behind him.
Steve paused.  Tony had the terrifically vivid sense-memory of a broom head snapping in half where his wrist connected to his hand.  “Don’t touch it.  You do not
“His name is Smokey,” Thor corrected, tilting his outlandishly small plastic guitar to maximize his performance as a truly ear-splitting number erupted from the television.  Steve could not believe the lack of noise complaints.
“No, of course you didn’t, you’re a very well-meaning person,” Tony said, which surprised Steve.  Steve halted.  Tony kept walking, then turned at last to face him.  Between the moonlight and the faint blue glow underneath his white shirt, Tony stood out in the darkness.  “I fell out of the
“See, only a dumb cuss would say that,” Tony said, looking back at him and laughing at his expression.  “Tell you what, you survived the Malört, I’ll buy you a real drink.”
“Sorry; I don’t know what’s gotten into them,” the gentleman handler explained, sitting in a cloth chair by a tractor, one hand resting on Ezekiel’s head.
This was a dream, Tony thought, pinching the skin of his own wrist until it hurt, releasing it with a gulped little breath.  “I don’t like you,” he said out loud, his voice thankfully monotone, devoid of all feeling.  “We’re not friends.  I just did this for a reason.”
, a pair of fluffy white dogs with big red-white-and-blue bows wrapped around their necks.  Sitting on a low rock wall with the Griffons at his feet, Steve spoke earnestly about the perfect weather, the lady luck on his side.
Too pleased to have another human up and about to complain about the company, Steve started to pace.  Tony told him, “No,” and Steve paused.  “You do that, I’ll throw up.”
“Who said we were stopping here?” Tony replied, tapping at his telephone.  He had a thin blanket draped over his legs.  Steve had the pronounced urge to ask if Tony knew that Alaska was a cold-weather territory.
“If it’s any trouble,” Steve started, but between Thor’s genuinely delighted smile and the employee’s quick,
Shaking his head, Steve leaned forward, flicked off the radio, and sat back in his seat.  Bruce looked over at Steve with owlish eyes.  “What?  What d’you want?” Steve demanded.
It carried on for quite a while, especially for a guy with limited lung capacity.  At least five minutes of soul-filled yelling.  Then a hand on his ankle startled him so much he shut up instantly.  He clocked his head on the wall looking down, but it was just Steve Rogers, looking almost as surprised to see him as Tony was to see him.
“But life ain’t about cards,” Steve said seriously, halting on the path, so Tony halted, too, his breath coming in thin but not altogether alarming gasps.  Steve went on: “Life’s about people.  We all need somebody in our corner.  We lose that, we’re in a real tough spot.  We only make it together.”
Tony did, then looked out at the town brawl.  He laughed at the sheer absurdity of it.  There had to be a hundred Gorn, all circling Thor, politely awaiting their turn to fight, occasionally pausing to pummel each other a little.  They seemed very respectable about it, undaunted no matter how many times Thor picked one up and bodily ejected it from the center of the fighting ring.  Nightfall seemed a distant thing, and Tony thought, “You think the whole village will show up?”
Juliet gave him a look like he was five-foot-nothing and skinnier than a telephone pole.  Steve flushed, realized what, exactly, he had implied, and stammered, “I meant—I wasn’t going for—”
“No,” Steve said shortly, liberating the knife from Tony’s grasp when he swung his arm back to make the throw.  Steve then used the same knife to spear a hot dog off the grill and take a big bite.  “That’s my wish, no arterial bleeds.”
It was an early December morning—never mind which day, exactly—when Steve paused at the stove and turned to look at Tony, sitting in his favorite chair in the living room, with Rico on his lap.
Tony merely sifted through his handful of cards, looking up at Bruce, whose eyes were just visible over the edge of the table.
Tellurium just looked at him.  Then she looked at Rhodes.  Rhodes pointed at Tony.  Tellurium looked back at Tony.  Even though she was incapable of frowning, Tony swore she was frowning at him, with her black eyes and pointy horns.
Steve was not stupid.  He knew that fame was a double-edged sword; people chased him around for interviews and endorsements, all while knowing he had the power to ruin their businesses with a single scathing remark.  Still, seeing it so plainly made him feel bad for the poor people involved.
Steve huffed a laugh, which grew into real laughter as Tony squirmed under his arm and huddled for protection in his lap.  “Aw, c’mon, Tony, it’s just a dog.”
At first, Steve thought it was a wheel—but then Tony said, “This is a tokamak,” and Steve knew he was out of his depth.
“If you continue insulting our hosts, no matter how severe the linguistic barrier, your message will eventually seep through,” Stovok warned.
“You should leave,” Tony suggested, too inebriated to be having this particular conversation.  He could normally hold his liquor well, but medication amplified its effects.  “They’re not for sale,” he added.
Then, slowly, Steve smirked.  Tony tried to repress his own grin, looking away a moment too long, both his hands free when he looked back.  “Just be patient,” Steve said simply.
Feeling ill-equipped to handle everything—the turncoat spy, the killer of men, the Norse god, the green Mr. Hyde—Steve nevertheless acknowledged, “I did, didn’t I?”
Stovok drew in a silent breath, then exhaled it.  “I was transferred to your father’s command after a . . . quarrel.  With Captain Phillips.  Phillips believed very strongly in evasive maneuvers.”  Grimly, Stovok said, “Your father rescued me from a lengthy shore leave.”
Tony sighed, but he gestured for the sparklers and Natasha tossed the whole pack over.  “Save me one,” Clint said from the ground.  “I wanna eat it.  Like a fucking dragon.”
It was too late.  The Hirogen took one step further, slid down a mild incline, and disappeared under the glossy surface of the lake.
Shaking his head, Steve rummaged around in his nightstand drawer, then pulled out a folded up newspaper and a pencil.  He flipped to the appropriate page and asked, “Five letter word for
Tony sighed, stopped, and faced him head-on.  “Let’s just say we’ve both been a jerk and call it even,” he said.
The presiding hatchlings—Indium, Tellurium, and Curium—fell upon the packages with a vengeance.  Most were food, which was convenient, seeing as dragons could eat just about anything.  “They like them,” Thor observed, pleased.  “I was not sure what they would appreciate.”
Steve’s spine went stiff.  “Yeah, real buzz kill, sometimes.  Thinks I’ve kidnapped you against your will.  Crazy idea.  Don’t know where he got it.”  He sat in a soft chair, then went on persuasively, “Look, you and me, we’re—business partners.  Of a sort.  It’s not weird, if . . . Stark Industries leases you some land.  Did it for Pepper and trust me, that was.”  He whistled.  It covered a lot of ground.  “Could be a room, could be a floor.  Or maybe a . . . cabin in the woods, that Nick Fury and his men can’t trace.”
P.S. No, Tony's outfit isn't "stupid," but this is rigid narrator Steve's perspective, and he is delightful. For those wondering, I modeled Steve's look on
, Tony thought.  He peeled the skin back, revealing a clear glob of fruit, and took a generous bite.
“You could fit ten people back here,” Clint said, sitting cross-legged in the back of an open white truck.  “Can we get a creepy white van?”
Steve, he would gladly have waited in the car, or even gone hungry for a month, if it meant not looking into their sincere brown eyes.  He was almost grateful when one spat in his face; his food ought to hate him for making it into food, he thought, wiping the spit off with the back of his hand.
With a sigh, Steve set his empty coffee aside and got up.  He opened the door.  Clint Barton tackled him.
Another, briefer pause.  “. . . I’m sorry, Captain Rogers.  You do not have security clearance to access this floor.  Please make another selection.”
Steve held onto him, close but not hard, careful not to break him.  Then, suddenly, he said, “Did you know Marker—?” and something in Tony’s good mood soured as he nodded.
The back of his neck prickled.  He resisted the urge to turn around, see if there were more agents in the hallway.  He stepped forward, purposefully calm.  He listened very carefully for a third party, but other than his own pounding heart and the two women before him, all was quiet.
Tony had come to a haranguing halt in front of Bruce, who was sitting cross-legged in the field with an entire gallon of cider, looking dolefully up at Tony like he wanted nothing more in the world than the power to turn invisible.  “What?  Why are you looking at me like that?” Tony was saying.
Shaking his head, Tony turned back to the Ba’ku, bowing a head in formal dismissal.  “We’ll be in touch.”
younger than Earth—billions of years younger, which would make its population’s early emergence more than impressive.  Sure, they did not have
Steve nodded, still looking at him hungrily.  Then he embraced Tony again.  Tony sighed against his shoulder, patting his back and insisting, “Fine.  I missed you, too.”
He heard a slightly louder knock.  The monster was growing impatient.  It would not be much longer until the monster broke down the door.  Acting in Tony’s best interests, of course.
“I plied Fury’s secrets and sent the location to interested parties,” Tony sniffed.  “Interested parties being myself, of course.
Steve got to a knee so he could use both hands to rub the bloodhound’s furry head.  “If I knew, I’d tell ya,” he said truthfully.  “Just trying to get out of the city, I guess.”
“I don’t know,” Tony simpered, and then, taking the galaxy’s greatest risk, leaned forward and kissed Stovok right between the brows.  “These are human,” he finished, leaning back, taking in Stovok’s carefully blank expression.
, he thought, and then a big huge fisher’s hand hooked him by the arm, wrenching his shoulder out of socket as it yanked him out of the turbulent flow.  “You fool!” Thor chortled.  Steve gasped around the stinging pain in his arm, his eyes, his lungs, dangling like a fish on a line in Thor’s commanding grip.  His arm strained to hold his weight, the current yanking him towards the edge.
Steve did what felt right; he hitched himself up onto the goddamn table, folded into a sit, and dragged Iron Man’s torso onto his lap.  He could not believe his own life, his own role in the strange dream it had become, holding onto the metal monster and willing him to unravel, just so they could—goddamn do something,
Releasing the board, Iron Man took two steps back.  Then, with a soft hiss, Tony Stark stepped out of the suit.  “OK, let me at him,” Tony said, holding out his arms.
“Be quiet,” Steve snapped.  His head was pounding, but at least he did not have to speak to the Canadian Mounties about the heroic rescue Thor had made of an “unidentified civilian.”  Bruce and Clint had been roped into going to the precinct: Bruce to bridge the cultural gap, Clint to star as the “unidentified civilian.”  Clint had even donated his shirt to Steve and dumped a bottle of water over his own head to lend credibility to the story.
“Leave your weapons,” advised Sojef, keeping his voice genial but his warning plain.  “Including your armor.  You will have no need for them.”
Tony readjusted his grip so he was hugging his own arms around Steve’s neck, his palms sore from squeezing so hard.  Conveniently, it blocked Steve from raising his own arms to remove Tony’s, keeping him in place.
Marker caught up in three wing beats, displacing massive amounts of air.  Tony whooped with joy.  “C’mon!” he said.  Higher and higher, they flew, racing towards the ceiling of the world.
.  Among the chaos.  This is chaos theory in motion.  Add just one more,” he indicated a Gorn approaching with claws upraised, stomping menacingly, “and the entropy multiplies.”  As proof, another Gorn backed up, knocked over the newcomer, and both tripped.  “That could have been the turning point of the game.”
Steve gave him a deadpan look of his own.  Well, at least they were on the same page, Tony thought murderously.  “No, it’s not,” Steve dismissed, waving a hand, bearing a cookie.
rooms available—although Steve amused himself picturing Natasha regally enjoying the space while the remaining Avengers huddled in the bathroom.
Then Tony reached back, picked up another lollipop, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth.  He immediately made a face.  “Fucking
Tony felt two hands gripping the back of his shirt tightly.  He looked over a shoulder at Dr. Banner, who looked petrified.  “Don’t let him eat me,” Bruce entreated.  “I’m mangy.”
Tony blinked, then looked down at himself.  Heart pounding, he shucked his shirt off and—smoothed a hand over unbroken skin.
—slowing anyway.  “Been out for a while, but everything’s okay,” what could only be Steve Rogers went on, sounding a little unsure, a little
my experience,” Tony said, but he sighed and leveraged himself upright.  “All right, Sputnik.”  Tony stole the drink back, sloshed it down in one go, and shrugged on his black Starfleet shirt.  “Beam us up.”

,” he grumbled, grabbing the spray can and spritzing his tiny assailant on the snout.  Curium fell off the table, landing on the floor with an indignant hiss.  “Serves you right,” Tony huffed.  He then turned and sprayed Actinium, who merely dug in harder.  “No, you
“OK,” Steve said, releasing Thor, who smiled, swung Mjolnir in one idle arc, then set it on the ice.  “Be careful,” he advised, anyway, as Thor leaped into the cave in a single bound.
Finally, the black-and-gold Iron Man suit stepped forward.  Together, they managed to haul Steve’s limp-noodle carcass onto a couch, which ruined the upholstery, but restored Tony’s dwindling faith in the universe.
“Hear what?” Tony asked, frowning.  Clint squealed off down the road.  Not one of them batted an eyelash.
Natasha rested her head on his shoulder.  Steve allowed it, long after he felt she could have come up with a yes-or-no answer.  Then he sighed, signaling her to lift her head.  “All right,” he said quietly.  “I’m done feeling sorry for myself, now.”
It was like slow-motion wrestling, gripping onto rubbery shoulders, staring into sparkling eyes, straining to move his adversaries even a single centimeter in any direction.  Despite their lack of outward lethality, they were surprisingly strong, and when one wrapped its big reptilian arms around him and hoisted him in the air, he felt helpless to stop it.
An uncomfortable pause ensued.  Not one of the Starfleet representatives had the heart to deliver the truth: Stovok was an anomaly, one of a fractional few.  Vulcans rarely left their homeworld; even fewer joined the star-trekking organization known as Starfleet.
A swelling of emotions—pity, anger, frustration, sorrow—engulfed him, only to be swept out to sea on the next wave.  It was not his place to judge Tony’s place on the team.  If Tony wanted to hide his wounds, then who was Steve to expose them?
All the while, Tony tried to understand where they had gone wrong.  Romulans had been indistinguishable from Vulcans—once.  They still shared the same brutal logic as the Vulcans.  They had to know that the
“Yes,” Tony said.  “It’ll be on the check.  Watch the sprinkles,” he added, as the ice cream hit critical mass and spilled.
Ill-timed, because a familiar voice startled him from behind: “Two-hundred-and-seventy-nine-point-nine-five-seven-two days.”
Floored, Tony frowned at him.  Rogers elaborated softly, “Almost lost you twice today.”  Clearing his throat, he looked down at their hands.  “I’m sorry.”
Thor looked genuinely put out, one hand planted next to a block supporting a bear statue.  Bruce looked relieved.  Natasha looked indifferent.
“And, this is cooking, which means,” Tony reached for the bag of brown sugar, but Steve was quicker on the draw, “
Tony took a short bow, then stalked off the floor, entering the elevator.  He had nearly convinced himself it was all going to be an ugly dream in his memory when Commander Stovok slipped in a bare millisecond before the doors slid shut.
The nurse finally showed up.  Rogers’ steadying grip made the visit more tolerable, but Tony still wanted to go
“As I was saying,” Stovok said calmly, turning to address Tony, who consciously did not step back.  “We should find a more secure location.  There is a storm on the way.”  He indicated the ocean.  And now that Tony looked—he could see the clouds.  The wind was picking up, too.  “It would be unwise to be exposed.”  He bent double and hoisted Dr. Banner’s limp body over his shoulders.  “Follow me.”
Steve scowled.  “Look, Tony, just because I’m going along with this—this cockamamie plan of yours doesn’t mean—”
“I told Pepper she couldn’t put me on a missing persons’ list for at least a week,” Tony interjected.  He reached for the radio dial.  The news of the day was about a salmon shortage.
He gripped his free hand over his knee, grounding himself, reminding himself that there were parts of him that did not hurt.  His body was not a broken machine.  It was a wounded machine, a machine that had taken damage.  He kept all his old suits, even the ones that did not work anymore.  There were lessons to be learned from the dead.
Tony blinked, tears clumping his own eyelashes, reflexive against the pain, the bright white lights, the simple realization that he was
“The smaller the crew, the less the risk there is to overall loss of life.  Given the starting perimeters, the crew party size was . . . logical.”
It was a strange moment—the future’s answer to Einstein, the reimagined Olympian, and the turn-of-the-century Brooklynite, all standing in the footpath—broken by Thor’s solemn declaration: “No mortal would last a night in the High Mountains.”
in their backyards, but they had primitive technology and a strong sense of community.  Earth, halfway through its lifecycle, was populated solely by single-celled organisms.
He stared at his own reflection for so long he sort of forgot who he was looking at.  His new avatar of a body hardly needed to blink, compared to his grim façade of the past, a full head shorter.
“You’re going to find the threshold of strawberry toxicity to humans,” Tony muttered, plucking one off the top and rubbing it off on his cardigan before taking a bite.  He made a surprised expression before schooling it back into his usual neutrality.  “Too bad Pepper’s
Now, the ending—settled almost spitefully in his gut, like a plate of ash disguised as a meal.  With Bucky gone, Kansas had gotten even emptier.  And the yellow brick road did not lead home.
Good man, Steve thought, a strange ache in his chest that wanted to be grief suppressed by force of will.  Colonel Phillips was not part of the future, but that did not mean—
Grimacing back at him, Tony waved a hand.  “Just—make it snappy, all right?”  Then, reaching up, almost proprietarily, he straightened the uniform over Steve’s shoulders, stopped himself from smoothing down his hair by brushing a thumb past an ear quickly instead.  “I’ll see if I can’t rodeo that case back.”
himself to it.  He gripped Cap’s wrist with greater force, with what would be uncomfortable force on an ordinary man.  The back of his neck was damp with sweat.
“Oh, Nat torched that.”  At Steve’s suitably floored look, Tony huffed a laugh and looked away.  “Made you think it.”
“You say, here, tweety tweety tweeties.”  Turning pointedly to the crowd that had somehow grown to nearly twenty in the span of two short aisles, Tony added, “We have become a nation of furries.”
“Happy, I’m gonna need about twelve of my usual orders,” Tony interrupted.  “You know what?  Let’s make it an even number, round it up to twenty.”
Steve nodded in agreement.  “Yeah,” he agreed.  “Just needs more yellow.  Then it’d be perfect.”  Then he huffed at the idea of it, a notoriously small-brained
Stovok hemmed and hawed silently, staring at the floor with both hands clasped tightly.  Then he said, “Do you trust me?” without looking up.
“Then don’t insult my coffee.”  Resting an elbow on the bar, Tony put his chin in hand and complained, “I miss my coffee.”
“I’m sure they’re completely internalizing it,” Tony said dryly.  Stovok looked up at him, parsing out whether he was serious or not.  Tony said, “Really, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Keep going,” he insisted.
, which meant that exactly what it meant, the armor really was part of his skin—and gathered him tight to his chest.  “C’mon,” he repeated, only to himself, as Iron Man’s helmet rested against his shoulder and he carried him, blankets and all, towards the couch.
“Just that easy,” Tony Stark declared, gesturing with a milkshake and ignoring the crushing glare Steve sent him.  “Look—”
Pulling over on the road’s shoulder, Steve sat on his bike and looked up at the black sky, asking the stars,
“Mm-hm.”  Steve heard him move before he felt the kiss on the back of his head.  “Go back to sleep.”
It was like entering a dream.  One moment, Tony was seated on a bench beside Stovok; the next, Tony was standing across from him in a strangely lit launch bay.  Tony lifted a hand to blot out the bright white lights, but this was Stovok’s memory; they persisted, muffling the ranked soldiers on every side, in formation.  Stovok stood apart, looking younger and far less daunting in his all gray military uniform, the gold command stripes visible on either shoulder.
.  It was not Marker’s fault, but Marker warbled at him anyway, confused and concerned.  Wild animals did not show pain; it was considered a death sentence, and, Tony was conscious enough to appreciate, Marker was at least distressed at the thought of
Sinking deeper into the couch, gripping his shield to his chest—not trusting Clint not to take it—Steve resigned himself to being the proud ruler of a chaotic tribe.
“Sure you can,” Tony said, in a tone that implied Steve had recommended jumping off the Empire State Building to do it.  “Thor,” he said, even though Clint hopped down and said with audible interest:
Natasha waited.  Steve swallowed hard, made himself be still, and quiet, and miserable.  At last, he said, “There is no going back.  Is there?”
It is a beginner's way of understanding Russian, rather than a holistic way of understanding Russian. I do not wish to offend anyone; it is solely done for the purpose of easing readability for those who are unfamiliar with the Cyrillic pronunciation.
Rhodey said, “Tony, come on,” and pulled him up, into a hug.  It hurt, like he was made of splinters and no way he sat would work, but at least Rhodey knew what it was like, to hurt that kind of way, and he had nothing special inside his genetic code, trying to put all the splinters back together.  A warm hand curved around the back of his head, protecting it, as he pressed down on Rhodey’s shoulder.
Marker, though—he loved the sun.  He sprawled in the sand, rubbing his chin delightedly against it.  He warbled at the ocean unsurely, but ducked head-first into the pool, shedding enough scales to make a poorer man very rich in the clear water.
“Jeremiah, Ezekiel!” a robust gentleman called out as a pair of bloodhounds crowded around Steve, not one step out of the car.  “Get back here right now or so help me!”
.”  Crunching over the pebbled gravel to Clint, he parked a boot in his behind, nearly sending Clint face-first into the water.  “But bear-spray is ‘inhumane.’”  He rolled his eyes, then let out a yelp as Clint kicked up a spray of water at him, flinging a protective arm in front of his face.  “
Clint laughed.  Tony just said, “You’re a natural, buddy,” and patted the space next to him.  “Tell me about Asgard.”
, Stark.”  Tony waved a hand again, dismissing the implicit compliment, refusing to be managed.  “We were able to put together the rest of the puzzle.”
“Please let me in, Tony,” begged the monster, claws tucked in so they would not scrape on the wood, giving away nothing of its intentions.  “
He reached up for his neck, fished out the dog tags, and held onto them in a closed fist.  A solemn reminder:
run,” Tony grumbled, grasping Actinium by the neck and chucking him carelessly across the floor.  “Get the hell outta here.”
, was what it was.  Tony had read the very papers written up on the negative effects of long-term spaceflight, and while it was considered inadvisable to go more than six months between on-world visits and even less advisable to go more than ten years without a real intermission, the evidence that long-term spaceflight had negative effects on the mind was still fairly
“Don’t worry, sourpuss,” Tony said finally, voice composed but words making Steve look over, angular and annoyed, “we’ll find a place for you, yet.”
To Steve’s surprise, Tony lifted one bottle out of reach—the baby tried to follow it—and held it out wordlessly.  Bruce scurried forward, nearly faceplanted, and then settled down on his rump.  The baby hog climbed into his lap and latched onto the bottle.
“Are you dying, Tony?” Steve asked solemnly.  He found he did not want to hear the answer.  He found, more than anything in the world, that he wanted Tony Stark to live.
Thor clapped him on the shoulder.  “Of course.”  Smiling, he released Bruce and added, “Where I come from, everything is
Most of all, Rico was present.  Present like the thing-they-did-not-talk-about.  When Tony was silent and broody, Rico was silent and broody with him.  Sometimes, Steve thought that that was what cats were best at: staring silently at walls for hours at a time.
but it was so much easier to take Steve’s word.  So much easier to just let his eyes shut and sigh, “I’m betting on you.  And them.”
But he could not speak, breath frozen in his chest, and the anger was gone, replaced with static, white noise.
He had intended to make a brief pit stop at the Retreat before carrying on his way to rediscover America.  It had seemed like a healthy way to cope with his circumstances.
His heart was gonna explode.  Serum or no, it was gonna burst in his chest, pop like a balloon.  He felt unstable—not mentally, no, he was acutely aware of himself, of consequences, action-reaction, of disobeying orders and facing reprimand, but in the kind of ship on violent seas way, where no amount of confidence could make the world set right.  He found a wall, gripped it.  The shield hung from his fingers, a light but not invisible weight.
material, not one book or pamphlet or cleverly disguised poster outside his door, nor had he attended any of the classes, group meetings, seminars, “wellness checks,” or any other poorly-designed programs to get him back into society.
“Too busy climbing mountains,” Tony said with a self-deprecating shrug.  “We summitted Mount Everest—ever heard of it?”
Groaning theatrically, Tony slouched over and slumped against his side.  “You stole from me,” he complained.
“’ey, Cap,” Clint said, chucking the tennis ball at him.  Steve caught it, too.  Tony whistled behind him.  Steve ignored him, getting a feel for the bat.  He had grown up with stickball, but he could rip car doors off their hinges, now.  He had to be careful.
They proceeded with such unerring ease that he did not expect resist when the elevator doors closed.  “You do not have security clearance to access this floor,” a disembodied voice—what else was new?—announced.  “Please make another selection.”
and pushed downward exactly as far as his Tony had shown him.  The reactor pressed against his palm.  Even knowing it wasn't embedded into Tony's flesh did nothing to allay his fears; that was
“I still don’t see what you get out of it,” Steve murmured, looking like he could lie there forever, a marble statue made man.
It was only when they were in the elevator, Tony still holding his head, Steve still holding his shield—God help them, if S.H.I.E.L.D. decided to take a less tactful reacquisition approach; they were sitting ducks—that Steve asked quietly, “So, what exactly
“Let’s go kill a Gorn,” Tony ordered.  Thor slurped at a replicated beverage, looking over Tony’s shoulder briefly, but Tony just pointed towards the transporter bay and insisted, “
“Wouldn’t dream of it, Cap,” Barton replied, cradling a box of cookies in one arm.  “How we doing, Stark?” he asked, squeezing Tony’s foot through the blanket.  “Cookie?  Just don’t get any crumbs on the bed.  Cap's orders.”  Tony scowled at Barton.  “You sure?  Best in town,” Barton said, shaking the box again.  “Then again, I haven’t eaten in . . . three days.”  He crunched down on another one and shook the box in Rogers’ direction.  “Cap?”
“I love that guy,” Bruce said, still lying face-down in the dirt.  “He’s so nice.”  Tony heard Clint yelp loudly in the distance, followed by a crashing noise, but he did not turn to see what Natasha had done to reclaim the water jug, instead glaring into the abyss and repeating adamantly:
Huffing privately at the argument—Steve had stuffed newspapers in his own ratty shoes for years to make them work, but one scuff and Tony Stark’s threw in the towel—Steve moved down a short hallway, all self-contained, and paused outside an expansive balcony.  After a moment’s hesitation, he slid the door open.
Steve was glad he had a photographic memory.  Because he kind of wanted to revisit this moment, someday: Tony Stark, feeding two wild hogs.
“Look at him, he’s the picture of health,” Barton said, propping his feet up on the edge of the gurney, overbalancing promptly and collapsing onto the floor.  “As am I,” he added with a beat of laughter, cackling like a hyena.  “Jesus.  We’re some crew, aren’t we?”
He could understand Tony’s surprise.  When Nick Fury had shown him three living options—an apartment in Brooklyn, an apartment in Manhattan, and a cabin in the woods—Steve had tapped the last photograph and asked why it had been included.  “It’s a way out of the city,” Fury had explained.
Grimly, Tony gripped Stovok’s uniform and resolved to outlast the cold night and its singing tribesmen.
Clint stepped around the car and used his foot to indicate one pair of tracks.  “Somebody’s been snooping.”
,” in a snide imitation of Steve’s voice.  Then he stomped back over to the camera—oh, look at that, still on—and drew in a big, deep breath.  “Listen, kids.  I’m hip, I’m cool.  I’ve been to ‘a club.’  I’ve had ‘a drink.’”  He did the air quotations.  “I’ve made ‘choices.’  I’ve slept with—”
Sucking in a sharp breath, Tony listened to him hush, “I know it hurts.”  He had one arm wrapped around Tony, the press of his chalky uniform more comforting than any soft sheets could hope to be.  “Bet we can get you something,” Rogers said.  “They gotta have good stuff, nowadays.”  Chin balanced on Rogers' shoulder, Tony did not reply, eyes shut, soaking in his solidity, feeling Rogers shaking, just a little, and somehow that simple break in the veneer of strength made
“Screams,” Steve said.  “Whole time.”  He did not wish to be seen as a bad cat owner.  A bad cat owner would have made the cat walk in the puddles.  Then again, cats did not listen very well to orders; walking one off-leash would have been rather difficult.
“You have missed your true calling, Stark,” Thor said, pleased, lowering the disposable camera, turning back the film reel expertly.  “You would make a fine mage.”
It was a testament to how muddled or simply frustrated Steve was that he looked down, lifted his hand, Tony still holding onto it, refusing to let him off easy.  It would have to be the hard way.
, so clearly it would have been redundant to verbalize.  Feeling cornered, he retreated to his bedroom.
“I do not know,” Stovok said.  “I am unfamiliar with their kind.”  He stepped forward.  At Tony’s disbelieving squawk, he explained, “I must perform further investigations.”
“Not likely,” Stovok dismissed, already turning towards the path alongside the cliff.  “Come.  We must move.  Time is diminishing.”
that could prove invaluable.  The others would catch on.  Or maybe they would not.  Maybe they would leave him here, the commissioned non-officer who went on-world without checking for—
“Nay,” Thor assured.  “You are not the only realm with dragons.”  He resumed his narrative, ignoring the flabbergasted looks around the room.  Tony and Clint shared one that said,
“Shuddup or I’ll send him back,” Tony threatened, heaving to pull Bruce out, who seemed perfectly content to be dragged for the remainder of his journey.  “How stoned are you?”
“I—may have.”  Defensively, Iron Man said, “Technically, he goes where he pleases.  I just make suggestions.”
“Mendenhall?” he repeated, covering the fall with the word, glaring at Steve as Steve put a hand under his arm, pulled him back to his feet.
Something—shifted in Pierce’s expression.  Suddenly, he did not look like he was playing their game.  One moment, Cap was holding the briefcase, loosely, insolently, in one hand, and the next, he had a lackey in a stranglehold and a
The underling paused, then cocked its head at him.  “Why the hell should I know?” Steve Rogers replied.
“Whatever you say, bear-kicker,” Tony said, dumping more trail mix directly into his mouth.  “Where’s
“Only my fair lady,” Thor said jovially, shaking the dice in his palm.  Bruce watched him curiously.
Tony turned over the card a few times, as if to check its authenticity, then said carefully, “I’ve known that man for
“No.”  With his eyes closed, he only heard Steve shuffle close, rest his forehead against Tony’s temple for a lingering moment, near enough to feel, close enough to ache for more.  “You know you deserved better.”
“The background noise is too loud for the machines.”  Another elbow to the side.  Tony shoved Stovok with both hands, but his inferior human strength did nothing to the Vulcan.
“How the hell did you get out of that one?” Clint Barton asked, standing in ankle-deep water and casting out a fishing line.
Gray smudges under the eyes, sweat-damp hair, night-of-the-living-dead pallor.  When Steve passed him the coffee, Steve honestly expected Tony would throw it back at him.  Then Tony took a sip of it.
A wet, barely-there laugh emitted from the suit.  Steve would have missed it, had his ears not been pricked for it, listening.
Tony did not speak until they reached the living quarters.  Then he followed Stovok down the hall, ignoring his own fatigue as Stovok led them all the way to the officer’s quarters.  As a mere consultant—his formal title was “Commissioned MTESC,” which boiled down to professional Multi-Tasker—he had private quarters, unlike the Ensigns, who had to double up, occasionally quadruple up, if they were unlucky enough to get bunk beds.  But his paled next to the space room Stovok led him into.  “Wow,” he said, out loud, looking around the blue-toned room, taking in its utter lack of personal touches.  “Love what you’ve done with the place.”
In the next instant, Snow rammed the steel door inward.  A powerful oily stench filled the air as smoke oozed from Snow’s open, growling maw.  Tony gripped Actinium and Curium tightly to his chest, huddling under Marker’s golden wing.  He could not see what happened through the thick membrane, but he heard Cadmium cheep once before being abruptly cut off.  He crushed the hatchlings to his chest, fearing the worst, before Snow clicked in contentment, shuffling back out of the broken lab door.  Cadmium cheeped a few more times, then quieted as Snow clicked again.
Steve took the paper carefully, well aware of who it really belonged to.  That bright young man, now old and dead, his own son solemn and grown before him.  Steve clasped Ashley’s hand carefully.  “You’re a good man, Ashley,” he said quietly.  “I’m glad I got to meet you.  And yours.”
“Well,” Tony said, as they left the steel city behind, “I think that went remarkably well, all things considered.”
“Is that what you call them?” Anij asked.  She gestured at her forehead, drawing striations curving upwards.
“There’s a few elephant graveyards worth exploring,” Tony mused.  At Rhodes’ unimpressed look, he added calmly, “Not that I ever would.”
“And can we help you.  And can we fix you.  And you must understand, as we are acting in your best interests, these are not questions.  No, questions preserve the right to decline, to abstain, to object.  Your right to object has been
Sighing, Steve turned away from the window, wrapped one arm around Tony, and pulled him into a brief but conciliatory embrace.  “OK, I’m sorry,” he told Tony’s hairline.
“See, that’s better,” Steve prompted, laying him down on the cushions, gentle with him, because Tony Stark had already fallen from the sky, and taken one hell of a beating from the helicarrier blades, and maybe, just once, Tony Stark deserved a little gentleness in his life.  Arranging the blankets around him, tucking them all the way down to metal feet, Steve prompted, “That’s better, right?”
“That’s not nice,” Steve said, picking up Curium fearlessly, burning log and all.  “Drop it,” he added.
Iron Man walked out.  Steve did not miss the way he limped, gripping at the doorframe in brief, passing aid.
Privately, Steve dreaded their arrival, but he kept his thoughts to himself, because he was good at that.
Shaking his head, Steve told him, “I don’t wanna fight.”  He felt restless, almost out of his own skin, on the verge of doing something stupid.  No matter how delusional his reality was, if he broke too far from the script of normal, there would be consequences.  He had to keep a level head about it.  He just had to play al—
Steve held his gaze, held onto him, refusing to let him cut loose, this time.  Twenty feet apart, and Tony could not budge an inch.  “I know.”
Tony nodded to himself.  Then, finally, he looked over at Steve, the stars in his shaded eyes taking a half-second longer to dissipate.  In its place was the calm, calculating Tony Stark he knew.  Wearing sunglasses and a woman’s cardigan.  “But
As the overall inebriation level increased and the sun crept towards the horizon, the crowd’s attention drifted away from a single object.  Steve was very grateful, albeit in an abstract way.  By 2000 hours, he started to feel somewhat purposeless, adrift in an ocean without a set course.  He kept an eye out for Natasha, but she seemed to have disappeared completely—maybe even never have been, he thought morosely.  He was hungry again, but eating alone had never appealed to him.
Steve slid his hands onto Iron Man’s hips, holding on.  “No.  Don’t.”  Hungry, tired, and deliriously grateful for a friendly face, Steve said, “You sent the Vision.”
Steve had no hard feelings for the hatchlings, even Actinium, who had bitten him on the neck.  Tony, who had no fewer than twelve visible dragon bites scattered across his person, could sympathize.  Even Marker broke his ribs on occasion; such were the hazards of attempting to commune with animals who could probably fly to the Moon and back without suffering damage.
“Maybe not, but I still know how to handle more weapons than you do,” Tony replied.  “Bigger ones, too.  Plasma ones.  Those’ll get you.”
.”  He tossed the gun to the Secretary's feet with a lack of fear that Tony knew would haunt him, that would make him lock the doors even if Cap was on another
“The terror of the North,” agreed the stranger.  “He’s a Kerry Blue.  Four walks a day and he still goes.”
Breathing fast, worked up and beyond the point of trying to calm back down about it, Tony grabbed one of the pillows and flung it hard across the room.  Steve longed to gather him in his arms, hold him, protect him as he had been so unable to, but all he could really do was say, “OK, I’m leaving.  I’m gone.”  And leave the door open.  He kept his footsteps loud, creaking, announcing his departure as he made his way back downstairs, holding Rico to his chest while Tony screamed into a pillow in muted rage.
,” Dr. Banner whined, but he did get up and even approached the group on cautious footsteps, as their song abruptly halted and they stared at him.  “Yeah, I—hi.  Hi, I’m Bruce.  How are you?  I’m Starfleet.  You know Starfleet?  Oh, God, what am I doing—”
Forsaking humanity’s dire warnings, Thor had climbed over the safety railing and found refuge on a large rock, enjoying the magnificence without interference.  A mere mortal in his own right, Steve had no authority to rebuke him, no doubt that Thor could survive the hellish plunge, should he fall.  Steve also had no fear whatsoever that Thor would fall.  Gods made no missteps, only unplanned diversions.
They sat down near but not next to the others.  Ignoring Captain Carter’s admonition not to eat or drink anything, Tony sampled the cornucopia of food and beverage laid out in front of him, chewing on a handful of grapes while Romanova put out feelers regarding the mission, asking Anij, “How long have your people settled this land?”
.”  He neglected to mention his own disbelief in divinity.  It all seemed—rather palpably irrelevant.  Like saying he did not believe in other religions.  They still existed.  Whatever strange concoctions his mind cooked up were just—part of it.
“I see no reason to draw hasty conclusions,” Stovok said, eyes shut, meditating.  “You should conserve your strength.  Rest.”
Ten seconds later, Bruce Banner, gripping the stretched elastic of his shorts to his waistline, reappeared.  “I—”  He blinked owlishly at the assembled Avengers, then said, “Ice cream?”
: Bruce, now sans drink but wearing a shirt, emerged from behind closed door to give them a very soulful look, indeed.
Tony looked at him doubtfully.  “What?” Clint said, frowning.  “I’ve done it before.  Cap trusts me.”
A very upbeat, very loud number started playing from his bedroom.  Steve sighed silently in resignation.
Unlike his companion.  Still breathing heavily but doing his damnedest to hide it, Tony slowed his stride to a shuffle.  “Heard you haven’t lived ‘til you’ve seen the Grand Canyon,” he said, trying to be conversational.
Tony answered it with, “You have five seconds,” and then frowned.  He held out the telephone to Steve.
Steve nudged Tony’s shoulder gently.  Tony swayed with the motion, then gave him an annoyed look: “What?”
“I had a brother,” Clint said at last, working the line, back to Steve, facing the empty world.  “Name was Barney.  Like the dinosaur.  You don’t know the fucking dinosaur.”  He did not laugh.  “Real name was Charles.  Charles Bernard Barton.  Barney was. . . .”  Clint paused.  With a deep breath, he said, “I had a family, but the only good one was Barney.”
“Yes.  Yup,” Tony agreed, ignoring Stovok’s heavy look, helmet turned towards him but expression hidden behind the black glass.  “We bow to your majesty.”
“Now, listen to me,” Steve said suddenly, drawing all eyes, “we are just people, just people like you and your brother and everybody else you know.  We’re not different, we just got different jobs.  You remember that, all right, you remember that what you are doing is a service to mankind and it should be respected.  We are not better than you for kicking dirt on it.”
It did not hurt that it was very early in the day; Tony knew Steve was far more indulgent at the beginning of his day than its end.  A sleepy sun peeked over the Pacific while Tony stifled a yawn.  Tony had not slept yet, but he was not worried about it.  Once Steve grew restless enough to leave, Tony could slip under the covers and doze.  With the morning sun pressing down on him, he might even sleep.  Tony always found it easier to sleep in the light; waking up in darkness terrified him.
“We will not,” Stovok said dryly, but he plucked another hydro-pack from the emergency supply and held it up.  “To new worlds.”
.”  With the spark of an inspired idea, he retreated to the closet, yanked the fire extinguisher off the wall, and pointed it at Steve.  “I’m giving you
, sure thing, Spandex,” and kissed him on the nose.  Steve scrunched it up.  “What?  This was part of the deal.  Twenty-four seven smooches.”
He loved her.  “If there’s Heaven.  I’m not saying there is.  You’re going straight there.  Straight there.”  He lifted a heavy arm to aim an accusing finger at Steve.  “
“No,” Tony said, surprising him.  He lifted his chin slightly.  “I create my own path.”  Then he swiped the hat back and placed it back on his head at a jaunty angle.
A classical brick four-story, the Mansion hardly looked like the kind of place where indecent affairs would be conducted.  Indeed, if Tony had said that it was an art school, Steve would not have batted an eyelash.
He heard, at last, the damning sound.  The door handle turned.  A sob hitched in his chest.  He did not want to deal with monsters, not today, not now, not
“Miss me?”  Bruce grunted deeply.  “Like hell you will.  I’ve requested a leave-of-absence.  Dr. Strange of the U.S.S.
“Should come back in a month,” Coleman advised, addressing Steve again.  “Cherry pies.  Best you’ll ever have.”
And then, with the sort of stiff, limping, upright resolve Tony had come to associate with Cap, Steve grasped the edge of the strap and pushed it back down.  Piece-by-piece, Steve returned it to order.
He thought about how some people thought God was the universe, everywhere, a spirit in small souls, and offered up cathedral thanks to the spirit of that God as he lingered in the open doorway for a long little while, rendered speechless with soft gratitude.
“We wait for the storm to pass,” Commander Stovok replied, his voice vibrating in his chest, which was pressed to Tony’s back.  “Then we attempt to establish communications with the ship.  If we are unsuccessful, we will move on to Plan B.”
The two clerks exchanged a brief look that Steve caught in the reflective glass, but neither reached for the telephone to call the cops.  Good clerks.
“I hate space,” Dr. Banner fretted emphatically, huddled in his seat, as tightly buckled as he could be.  “I’m not a
“If you don’t pick a station, I’ll pick it for you,” Steve warned him, as they oscillated through six channels in half as many seconds.
For a moment, Tony wished he had the full glass of water to throw at him.  Then he realized it was pointless—Steve was still too far away—and even if he did, what good would come of it?
He listened to the soft sounds of crickets outside the window as Stovok’s breathing tapered off into a meditative sleep.
Tony struggled out of his chair.  Snow clicked.  Steve held up both hands, approaching her, careful of those huge, gutting horns.  “It’s okay,” Steve said.  His skin was as white as her scales, but he caught her horn to prevent it from impaling him as she sniffed at the bandages on his neck.  “It’s okay,” he repeated.
Tony swiped up the facedown cards and hummed again.  Bruce made a sad noise.  Tony looked up at him expectantly.
“Aye, Captain,” Stovok said.  A gentle elbow landed in Tony’s side.  He ignored the silent provocation to respect authority, crossing his arms over his chest and frowning.
hacked into S.H.I.E.L.D.’s database on the helicarrier in less than twelve hours.  If anyone could—it was Tony Stark.
Thumping his own bare chest with a fist, Tony wheezed, “Trying to kill me over a rounding error, Captain Obvious?” and twisted around to look at him.
“I like Midgard,” Thor declared, before eating another whipped cream covered blueberry.  Even without the plastic guitar still strapped across his chest, Thor would have attracted more-than-passing-attention, wearing a floral tunic (armed with the additional context of “flower power,” Steve understood Tony’s remark that he dressed like a “hippy”) and presiding over a table crowded with dozens of empty platters.  The high-backed booth protected him from most fine diners, but Bruce still hid in Thor’s robust shadow, nose buried in a paperback book with a dinosaur skeleton on the cover.  Steve wanted to ask about it—or maybe where Natasha and Clint were—but Tony leaned against a chair across from the god and asked:
, before Stovok grabbed him by the back of the uniform and hauled him back upright, urging him after Dr. Banner, who was sprinting full-tilt through the trees, howling, “I hate this planet, oh my God!”
In sheer desperation—or perhaps fear of Natasha making good on it anyway—Tony lurched forward.  Steve caught him halfway, holding him in a loose embrace, entreating, “Tony, it’ll be okay, I
Thor sighed deeply, retracting his arm.  Steve privately resolved to find a way for him to exercise that hunter’s instinct, all while marveling at the artistic rendering of a red-and-green
Thor turned, acknowledging them serenely with a huge arc of one hand, then resumed stroking downriver.
“This is a special occasion,” Tony said, folding his arms behind his head.  “It’s called, ‘hip-hip-hooray, we’re not dead in a wasteland.’  And I’m not ‘weak of heart.’”
spiel, fixating instead on the faraway look on Stovok’s face.  He had often seen the Commander of the U.S.S.
Acting in Tony’s best interests, the monster would intervene.  What a hero, the other monsters would appraise the monster who hurt Tony Stark.  A good Samaritan!
Smoothing a hand over his own sternum, Tony shuddered at the unexpected feeling.  It was disarming, like having his kidneys stolen would be disarming.  Yet he did not feel like he had been recently sedated.  He felt good—
“Good boy,” he repeated, patting Marker on the face.  Marker just stared at him, clicking a few times in vague inquisition.  Tony could not answer him in a way he could understand.
Magnanimously full of hot wings—and hot wing bones, as it was a rare day when Steve could piss off Tony Stark half as much as Tony Stark pissed him off—Steve took in the sights of the city, the unfamiliar sounds and smells.
Tony cuffed him on the arm.  “Got your back.”  He waited until Thor had moved off to join the polar bear at the glass before smiling at Juliet.  His whole demeanor oozed charm.  “What’s his name?”
“I worry about what comes to pass,” Stovok dismissed, looking around.  “Insofar—we remain undetected.”
Then, of course, Captain America had to pop out of the hole like a weasel, effortless and easy.  Tony forced himself up to his knees before Steve could pity him too much.  He did not stand: his legs were too shaky, and he was sore from his failed and successful escapes.
Steve could try and stop him.  But he wouldn’t.  Because come Hell or high water, Steve Rogers was always there.  They were practically destiny.
“Wonderful.”  Tony clasped his hands together, then overbalanced, falling over in slow motion.  Stovok did not catch him.  Tony did not whine,
“You two eat?” Steve asked them, aware that he sounded a bit mother hennish.  Old C.O. habits died hard.
“Yes,” Tony said.  As soon as Steve started to stand, Tony sat down, gesticulating angrily at the cake.  “Cake first.”
“I, for one, welcome our post-Barton lifestyle,” Tony said, looping one of the strings around Steve’s wrist before Steve could yank his arm away and growl at Tony to keep his hands off.  “Where’d you get that?” Tony asked Bruce, who was standing nearby, holding a steaming cup of coffee and looking only slightly guilty about it.  He sipped at it rather than answering.  “
Tony felt bad for disrupting Steve’s sleep cycle—on Christmas Day, no less—but it was hard to resent the help.  Better than trying to do it on his own.  He heard a series of confused clicks, followed by Steve shushing Marker, who quieted down, only to poke his head in the door, too narrow for his shoulders to fit through.
Steve could hear food sizzling on the grill in the background, but it was impossible to make out any more distant noises over the orchestral swell of the music.  It was weirdly calming.  He acknowledged, “They say Mozart makes you smarter.”
Bruce and Steve both moved away.  Clint stepped forward until he was directly in front of the cake and deadpanned, “Bet.”
, I’m pretty sure he can’t take fall damage.”  Then, musing, he said, “We’re definitely getting kicked out of Canada.”
“I don’t know,” Tony said, and his voice did sound truthful, and that made Steve tense, but then Tony added, “but I have a feeling they’ll be back.”  He sauntered into the room, then rubbed his hands together.  “Fury called,” he said bluntly.  “And normally I don’t—make a habit, of answering his phone calls,” he sniffed, rubbing at one eye distractedly, like the mere thought of associating with S.H.I.E.L.D. was shameful, “but I was kind of curious.  He wants you back,” he said bluntly.
Tony continued snoring softly into the bedcovers, one arm wrapped around a pillow, covering most of the blue light emanating from his chest.  “Tony,” Steve repeated, tapping his leg.  “C’mon.  Time to get up.”
—” Tony began, then scrambled, nearly knocking over a shelf in his hurry to get out of the way, as something came alive near the floor.
the brush?” Tony offered, extending a hand, well aware that they had devolved to pure Neanderthal, but Steve handed the broom over without protest.  Then Steve reclaimed the vacuum handle and pushed it along.  “
Actinium gnawed on Tony’s boot.  “Tin-Tin,” Tony warned the blue-tinted troublemaker.  He was seated at his workbench, hard at work on the Mark XLV helmet.  “Let go, that’s not food.”  He paused to look down at the hatchling, about the size of a honey badger, gripping his leather boot with the same determination.  “Tin-Tin,” he repeated.  “Don’t make me spritz you.”  The air spray cannister would not hurt the dragon, but it would piss him off.  Normally, that would be a death sentence, but Actinium was ten kilos.  Tony could take him.  “Tin-Tin,” he said a third time, as the dragonling clicked in warning, then began thrashing his boot.
But there was an empty mug of coffee on the counter, with a white napkin underneath it.  Tony said, “Please be a clue.”  Lifting it, Tony made a triumphant noise.  “3-1-7.  Does 3-1-7 mean anything to you?” he asked Steve.
Never once did Tellurium look at him.  Tellurium did not need to.  Loving dragons was easy; earning their love in return was . . .
Clint rose from his perch and greeted Steve with an embrace.  Steve’s skin crawled with the urge to push him away.  He did not want anyone near him.
It was Tony’s turn to snort in amusement, saying, “Uh, yeah, I kind of know a lot of things,” before surreptitiously swiping another dough ball, whining when Steve said:
Dispirited and evidently tired of arguing with Logic Personified, Dr. Banner took a hard seat on the ground.  “How the hell do we get out of this one?” he asked.  “No, really, Commander.
“Sure.  It’s breathtaking.  You haven’t been to Juneau if you haven’t seen Mendenhall.  You’re here tomorrow, I’ll take you there, myself.”
Bruce skittered away quietly, but Thor’s sandals slapped magnificently on the marble flooring.  Even the most disinterested head turned to watch.
.  Like the Quinjet and the traditional jet, the helicopter hardly replicated that fateful flight.  The acceleration of that final descent had been a beast unto itself, like fighting a hurricane head-on.  Without the adrenaline, Steve would have been hard-pressed to stay awake for the sixty-thousand-foot elevator drop to the ice.
.”  The anger came back, a shaking frantic thing.  Steve stepped towards Tony, and one tiny fraction of a flinch was all it took to cow him.  “Please.  I can’t—”  He deflated, almost sat down, so sickening was his defeat.
“Good; he can stay there,” Tony replied.  Then, waving a hand, he added, “Go get him.  You have twenty minutes.”
,” Tony parroted, declining to mention all the wonderful things they had found.  Chlorinated oceans, volcanic caves full of moissanite, edible tadgolas—a mutual language, an alien race neither eager nor frightened to make contact with life itself from elsewhere, Outside.
on his armband, but between the storm’s disturbance and the hundred meters of rock overhead, he doubted anything would get through.
“Airborne was very tame,” he said.  “Scared, I think.  Just wanted someone to trust.  You could trust Falsworth.”  Shrugging, he added, “Odd was Odd.  Kinda like Dugan.”
He didn’t know why it mattered, as all of it—every beat of it, from the moment the Director introduced him to the strange new world to the time when aliens began raining down from the sky—had to be a fever dream.  A green Mr. Hyde and a Norse god working side-by-side to reclaim the Hydra weapon for forces of good, not evil?  Delirium.  He had no stake in this world, not really, yet he followed the Black Widow—infamous killer of men—deeper into Stark Tower, all while the turncoat assassin greeted Nick Fury, “Think we might’ve killed your boy.  Send the WSC our regards.”
He could practically hear the delicate hopefulness in Stovok’s voice as he disagreed, “Premature surrender.”
“What?  What’sa matter with you?” Steve asked automatically.  Clint dragged him inside—although, like Thor, Steve mostly
Tony stood up, staring at the view port, unable to process it.  He had seen planets devoid of life, planets stripped of their integrity, even planets rendered uninhabitable by the toys of war.  Never had he seen one so thoroughly
Steve released them.  Clint huffed and returned to his fishing pole.  Tony stood stiffly where he was, still a bit damp from Clint’s retaliation.
Now would be a really great time for Lieutenant Romanova to show up with a handbook on uncatalogued dialogue.  She could sweet-talk a
The firm hand on his wrist kept him sane.  It took less than a minute for Stovok to shimmy out of the tunnel, but it was the longest minute of Tony’s life, and he had spent hours in tense diplomatic standoffs, effectively a prisoner of a war that never quite went critical.
.  Dining with the President no longer made his palms sweat, but he still experienced an out-of-body
“We used to fight all the time,” Tony babbled, lying compulsively, lying to justify his lack of outward terror, the yawning grief under his heels.  “Wouldn’t speak to me at all.”
Tony grilled J.A.R.V.I.S., manually checked that Actinium still shone blue, unlike dark-red Curium.  When at last he confirmed that Curium, of his own damn volition, had made the journey, he could only write back,
“Too early for Christmas,” Steve replied, pulling out the bottle of painkillers.  “Gotta sit up, Tony,” he said apologetically.
Then he took off at a loping stride, needing to steer the course of history back on track as much as he could with the possibility of
Shy, sweet Bruce approached the animals without hesitation, extending one hand to pet them.  Half of them turned and walked away; the other half allowed him to proceed.  A few lowed; one chirruped.  If Bruce had trouble looking his food in the eyes, it did not show.
Six weeks.  Six weeks had passed since Bucky’s untimely death, and Steve still could not wrap his head around it.  Logically, he had known that failure was an option, but he had not been ready for it.
And then, even as Tony watched, the Vulcan began to dissolve.  He did not cry out in pain; he simply vanished from the red Earth, as did Dr. Banner and Tony Stark, in nearly exactly the same instant.
,” Tony seethed.  His intelligent lizard brain had taken over the motherboard and insisted that there were
He sat for a while, still, unmoving, lithifying.  Was that not the most frustrating thing about pain?  It fed on itself, cannibalized its own existence: joy was like a butterfly fluttering on the wind, but pain was a spark in a dry field, spreading as far and wide as it could go.  The longer he sat with it, the more pervasive it felt, until there seemed to be nothing inside him untouched by the fire.
“He kicked it,” Tony disclaimed cheerfully, crunching on a handful of trail mix, oblivious to the fact that it was four-thirty in the morning and midday bright.
of a lot happier on a full stomach, he decided, gazing up into celestial darkness, unbroken by celestial light.
.  The sudden drop in tension was dizzying.  There was something about Steve’s bond with Snow that almost frightened Tony; he had no doubt that if both of them, Tony and Snow, were drowning, Steve would save Snow first.
Slowly, almost sloth-like in its vague sense of motion, Steve’s good hand lifted away from the splint and settled on Tony’s forearm.  A brief shiver of involuntary dread wracked Tony’s central nervous system.
Tony made an eloquent gesture at his ears, followed by an audible, “I CAN’T HEAR YOU.”  He then gripped onto Bruce’s shoulder as the latter stumbled, preventing him from falling.
look, that Steve felt like scowling at, if only out of habit, before exercising compassion to nod at the glowing blue light in Tony’s chest.  Tony noticed his gaze, then rolled his eyes and mouthed,
Steve chucked a spare pillow at him.  Tony burst out laughing, rolling over so he could howl with it.
“It’s the modern age—nobody carries cash anymore,” Tony said, fishing around for his wallet, pointedly ignoring Steve’s glare, well aware that Steve had plenty of cash in
“I asked the Mind Stone if it could wake you up,” Steve said simply, wrapping the cord around the telephone methodically.  “It said no, nothin’ doin’.  Got kinda pissed, at that point.”  He set the landline aside.  “It said I could try to do the job, myself.  Not in so many words.  Like a.”  He lifted the telephone demonstratively.
Dedicating that one to himself, he scrubbed the back of his wrist over his face, put together a feelings-free sandwich for his husband, and looked down at the feline sniffing about the floor.
A deep voice clicked several times behind Tony, then made a strange, almost crooning sound.  At once, the elder froze. Then he pushed Tony aside and, before Tony could reclaim his footing, planted himself over the prone half-Vulcan, spear at his throat.  The Nibiran barked something full of malicious intent.  Stovok echoed back calm with a series of clicks and throat warbles that oozed
Snarling, Tony turned and stalked out before he could see whatever stupidity Steve came up with next.
fault he was in this predicament.  “Put one hand over the other,” Tony instructed, gripping his own wrist, “and thrust upwards.”  He tugged gently upwards a couple times.  Then, lifting Bruce clear off the floor, he added, “Can also be used to—”
Once, when he was twenty-five-years-old, Steve Rogers saw a man get shot through the chest, right in front’a him.
Tony thought he might vomit, collapse, or simply die before Stovok abruptly said, “Get down,” and shoved him to the dirt a second time.  Tony barely had breath to grunt, never mind complain, as he ate Nibiran soil a second time, lifting his head to chew out their Commander, who placed a quieting hand on the small of his back, lying flat beside him.
, and gave it a controlled shake.  Tony roused, but not quickly enough for his liking, and Steve shook him a little more,
Steve was not a man who allowed others near him.  He had to keep admirers afar, lest he be smothered in their adoration.  Tony relished every opportunity to tuck a hand around Steve’s elbow, crooked just for him, but he knew it was a privilege.  He knew that Steve stooped to speak with children, that he sat at a table for hours at a time to listen to an upshot talk his ear off, but he volunteered that elbow for Tony, gave him the right to be near him freely.  Others begged for Steve’s company, but Steve invited Tony to join him.
Admiral Fury inclined his head.  Commander Stovok stood at his shoulder, while Captain Carter sat at the helm.  “I was,” Fury acknowledged.  “But three of my best men have been missing for six weeks.”
“There are signs of habitation on the mountain,” Stovok said coolly.  “It is against Starfleet regulation to make contact with primitive races, as per the Prime Directive.”
some good.  Been pushed up the mountain all day,” he huffed, leaning into Steve again, like he was swooning.  “I’m weak.  Carry me.”
” Clint spat, tearing across the outfield towards the ball.  Bruce, who had been hovering around home plate, bolted away.
Hulk looked at him for another moment, perhaps hoping he would break, before making an almost exasperated grunt, standing up, and sauntering around the building.
Shrugging, Tony said, “No idea, I don’t make the rules.  I want that,” he added, pointing at the bag.  “Share.”
He gripped his shirt again.  The parasite was all he had.  It was close to him.  It fed off his beating heart.
For a beat, Steve thought Thor would rebuke Tony for trivializing a clearly important matter.  But Thor’s face bloomed with another smile, his big hand latching onto Tony’s shoulder briefly.  “You are trouble, Stark,” he said, but he said it fondly.  Then the smile slipped away.  Without a word, Thor slipped away, rejoining Natasha, who had managed to corral Bruce, farther along the footpath.  He painted on the smile for them again, inquiring buoyantly about another statue.
“I see now why you stand still,” Steve told Natasha.  “Thor, leave him!” Steve shouted, as Thor ignored the ball and continued the chase.  “Leave him!”
“My people will call your people,” Tony assured, standing outside a blacked-out station wagon with Mayor Cuff, who said simply:
Drawing in a deep breath, he crouched.  He stared into the darkness, a horrified shiver creeping over him.  “Nope, can’t do it,” he announced, getting back up and dusting his hands off, shaking all over.  “Cannot do it.”
was struck by the fact that he was an avatar for his own body—barely above a robot, when he crushed steel in front of ghost-faced soldiers.
Tony did not move.  Steve felt the seconds ticking down.  Out loud, Steve acknowledged, “I have to get back to the cat.”
Clint finally caught on, tossing the tennis ball over one shoulder.  Thor caught it with a triumphant roar.
“While you were sleeping,” Tony said, waving his free hand dismissively, ignoring Stovok’s reproachful head tilt, like he would correct the implication behind
“Negative,” Stovok agreed.  “We were focused on the mission.  Contact Starfleet.  Of which, the U.S.S.
Steve looked down at Natasha, then folded himself onto the porch next to her.  She smelled good, like lilacs.  He smelled like dirt.  Self-consciously, he nodded at the cabin: “Think I’m under siege.”
“What’re you talkin’ about?  Of course it is.”  Steve held up the pot and sniffed it.  “It’s coffee.”
Steve shut the door behind himself, at a loss for words.  “I shouldn’t have,” he admitted, staring at the shield.  “I—”
“You’re beautiful!” Tony told him, reveling in the sight.  Up top, every scale shone, not merely golden but
animation.  Two guys hoodwink their way into being gods by neutralizing a volcano.  You think we could pull it off?  You’ve got the ears, I’ve got the charisma, we could definitely pull it off—”
He was silent for a while, hands folded on his chest neatly.  “I have seen many bleed for a planet I have never been to.  After my service in the Romulan-Earth Wars, I was offered shore leave.  I should have taken it.”
Tony snapped the door shut, then walked around the hood of the car and slid into the passenger’s seat.  He shut that door, too.  He inhaled slowly.  Let it out.  “Can’t beat that new car smell,” he sighed.
From the moment he stepped off the elevator, he could hear loud, upbeat music playing behind closed doors.  He sighed, already imagining the noise complaints waiting for him.  Wasting no time, he knocked firmly on the door.  There was no immediate change—no, somebody started up a blender.  A
It did not matter if Marker never came back.  He would only act as if it were inevitable that Marker
Thor nodded in agreement, placing a big hand on Tony’s shoulder—Tony winced but had no choice but to go along with it—and declaring, “Absence does encourage the appetite.  A wise move, Stark.”  Looking at the cluster of unsure museum staffers, he added, “And thank you for providing a court worthy of a king.”
When J.A.R.V.I.S. announced, “Mr. Hogan has arrived,” Tony moved as quickly as he could towards the door.  Marker finally looked up, big black eyes inquiring, and Snow actually stood.
Steve had never been a politician.  Steve had never desired to be a politician.  But accepting Erskine’s magic meant accepting a life beyond his wildest dreams—and that included playing the game.
Looking in the mirror, he saw his own beleaguered face—lines around his eyes, smudges underneath—and reached up to feel the stubble.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, because he was gracious enough to recognize that, stranded or lost or forever left behind in the race of time, a proverbial stranger’s hospitality was a gracious thing.  He felt shame welling up inside him, but he kept it down, compressed it into a small thing that could be put away, and let his voice be sincere as he said, “You’ve been a lot kinder to me than I’ve been to you.”
Stovok looked at him, unimpressed, and then pointed mutely at the cave.  Tony shook his head emphatically, pointing towards the ocean.  “I’ll take my chances,” he shouted over the wind.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed.  “It does.”  Tony hunched in a little, but Steve said, “And that’s when I come to you.  And them.  You bring me back home.”  Squeezing Tony’s hand gently, he added, “I’m sorry for making you wait.”
Hours later, Tony lounged on Stovok’s chest on his outsized cot, feeling Stovok’s chest rise and fall with soothing regularity as the half-Vulcan reported, “Stardate: 2305.239.  After responding to a transmission from a group of unidentified Talosians impersonating a distressed Romulan vessel, Dr. Banner, Mr. Stark, and I, Commander Stovok, arrived on
While Clint and Thor took the Mjolnir short-cut—the glacier was “the size of Manhattan,” according to the pilot, and therefore rather hard to miss—Natasha hopped into the front seat with the pilot while Steve, Bruce, and Tony piled into the back of the chopper.
Did it go to one’s head, sitting on the ivory throne?  No, of course not—Tony could leave at any time.  He simply chose to wait, a mere
“My tricorder indicates the ambient temperature is three-hundred-and-ten-point-nine-three Kelvin,” Stovok replied.  “One hundred degrees Celsius,” he added, presumably for Tony’s benefit.
Steve sighed.  “It’s too hot for sweaters,” he grumbled, but he tugged the sweater on obediently.  It was a gift—and if there was one thing his Ma had taught him, it was never to reject a gift, no matter how odd.
It was a morbid alternative, to save Tony’s life.  “C’mon, Iron Man,” Steve insisted, ignoring the renewed throb in his own side with every step towards the Tower, the beacon of light that would save Iron Man’s life, even though it was in ruins, and its maker was all but dead in his arms.
“Yes.  No.  Yes.”  Tony stared at his crotch, then said, “I guess that answers the age-old question.”
“Hm?” Tony asked without looking up.  Rather than repeating himself, Steve waited him out.  Tony finally said, “Oh.  Mapping.”
“You’re just like your Pa,” Steve told Tony, intending to join the almost familial atmosphere with a meaningful contribution.  “Same flare for the dramatic.”
He frowned, but went along with it, not missing the way Clint grabbed his plate and declared, “More for us.”
“Couldn’t sleep?” Tony asked dryly, PADD on his chest and galaxies on his ceiling, written in blue digital ink.  He had already mapped the Ba’ku homeworld; he was simply messing around with star sizes and probable appearances of the planet when Stovok knocked on the door of his private quarters.  He could not deny that a real bed was far more welcome than the sleeping bags stored on the ship.  He did not envy Barton.
Wrapping both arms around the kid—were alpaca babies called kids?  Or foals?—Steve stood up carefully.  “I think we ought to take this one,” he announced.
Clint shrugged.  “Just your average run-of-the-mill pathological opportunist.”  He tugged on the shield, found it secured to Steve’s arm, and wisely bounced back a few feet when Steve lifted it warningly in his direction.  Retreating around the corner, he said loudly, “Still can’t believe you and Stark
to be with people, to connect with them on a personal level, but his body rebelled, reminding him that every jerk in the crowd would have kicked him into the dirt, once upon a time.
“The Romulans were once our people,” Stovok impressed, speaking briskly, too agitated to maintain a demeanor of calm.  “They speak our language, they know our most inward of vices.  We must speak to them.  We must reach out before it is too late—”
“What’s wrong with you?” Tony asked suddenly, making Steve start, turning sharply to look at him.  “We’re watching the goddamn movie.”
Tony nodded briefly.  He did not move out of his own huddle, but Steve wrapped both arms around him, big monster claws turned gentle as they held him together.
Tony gave him a truly withering look.  Then he looked down at the coffee, as if it had just occurred to him that it could be a weapon, before sighing in defeat, likely coming to terms with the fact that Steve would leap heroically out of the way—or maybe let Tony land the hit, just this once, because maybe Tony deserved a win.
The storm passed.  Stovok got up to confirm it, which was a tragedy, but Tony’s stomach was growling painfully, and he deeply regretted spending the previous evening in the warp core compartment.  He loved spending time with the antimatter reactor—there was something magnetic about it, irresistibly beautiful, a living dark star shaped by sentient hands—but the lack of a proper meal was eating at him.  Dr. Banner verbalized his discomfort: “We’re going to starve.”
Inside, it was a strange mixture of shut-off and well-lit spaces, almost like a movie set.  Steve was tempted to wander off, to sniff around a bit, get a feel for the land, find out what was really going on, but he dutifully ignored the temptations lurking in cinematic shadow, following their guide up a semi-lit staircase.
“Don’t mind me,” Tony said, sliding down so he could sit with his back to the stone wall, watching the Vulcan work, surrounded by the Ba’ku children.  “I’m not even here.”
, smile that he had gotten used to, albeit not from people who outranked him in their own profession.  “Never flown a chopper before,” he admitted.
Tony paused to give Steve a genuinely perplexed look, reminded for the umpteenth time that he was talking to a person that pre-dated the nineteen-fifties, before shaking his head and returning to his own diagram.  “Don’t you
He turned away from Steve Rogers, covering the aching heart of thorns with one hand, limping towards the far side of the room, a futile last stand.  He ached.  He hurt.  He could not be healed and he knew he could not find peace with his misery.  He could only argue with monsters about his condition until they grew tired of him and convinced themselves he was wrong, wrong, wrong, and needed more forceful intervention.
