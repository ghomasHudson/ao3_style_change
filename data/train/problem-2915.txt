They had been walking as they talked, and soon reached the house. Dean looked around curiously. He had never been in a  Pastor’s home before, it was strange to imagine Jim anywhere but the church.
Much to Sam’s surprise (and, he suspects, disappointment) Dean has actually been to a pride parade before.
“You think I’m not keeping Sam safe?” John asks, ignoring Dean’s words, pressing down on his chest until Dean is grimacing in pain. “You think you know even a fraction of what I do to protect you boys? What I’ve sacrificed so your worthless ass could mouth off at me? Do you know how many times I’ve had to cover you? Do both our jobs so you could go off and play video games or nap in the sun? That
The sounds of nature were more prominent here, the human noises of the town fading away, which helped to clear his mind somewhat.
The car trundles down a dirt pathway, rolling past dark trees. The beams from the headlights pick out a break in the leaves – a black lake visible beyond them – the tops of the waves just illuminated by the weak moonlight.
“And take half my skin off with it? I don’t know about you but I feel like bleeding out in front of them today.” He rubs a hand over his face, wishing to be anywhere else. Wishing for some peace at least so he can think. He can feel a thousand pairs of eyes (his own eyes) on him. It’s making him itchy. “Can’t I just…ease them in? Keep them busy for a little while?” He says the last part quietly, more thinking out loud than anything – but of course, the other hims hear it.
“Yeah to y’know:” Sam mimes smoking – bringing two fingers up to his lips absentmindedly, considering. “After me n’Dad fought – after Dean talked us down – I’d go sulk. Dad would too – though of course, he wouldn’t call it that. He’d probably go drink and/or shoot something and I’d go cry and seethe and Dean would just…vanish. I never even thought about it until now. He was just always there until I wasn’t and I never thought to question it. It didn’t even occur to me that he was…that he needed…that he was more than just…” he trails off.
Cas nods, then realises Dean can’t see the movement: he’s still watching the road. “That’s fair,” he says out loud, then he pauses, trying to think of the right words to match the emotions that have been growing inside him for nearly ten years. “I have this…image in my mind,” he starts haltingly. “A daydream perhaps? I don’t know where it came from and it doesn’t make much sense but it I like to think about it.” He waits for Dean’s signal before he continues.
. The proverbial straw whip on our mutual favourite camel’s back. The thing that kick-started this whole goddamn shitshow
“I know you are – but I’ve been torn wide open Sammy so I’m not really up to following these metaphors all the way through to the end. Pick somewhere – anywhere – and we’ll get to the rest eventually. However long it takes. I told Cas not to wait up.”
Neither was quite willing to move yet, so Dean compared the barren, empty lawn in front of him to the space in his memories. When Mom was still alive, there had been rose bushes in the now empty beds. They had withered into skeletons alongside her, with nobody able to tend to them. Now even the brittle branches were gone, and only dust remained.  More to distract himself from such a dour line of thought, he forced himself out the car. Sam scrambled out after him, and they warily ascended the steps to the front door.
“Does he?” Cas kept his voice expressionless as possible, eyes never leaving Jims’. “That’s unfortunate.”
Slowly, John turned to face his eldest, leaving Sam to stand – all but forgotten – by the kitchen table. The air between them seemed to crackle as their eyes met. “That depends,” he said eventually, “you still a faggot?”
“In the meantime,” Gordon continued as if Dean hadn’t spoken, “We’ll be keepin’ a close eye on you to make sure you don’t stray again. We’ve ignored your transgressions too long Dean, and looked where it’s landed you. We talked it over with your Da’ and as long as you agree to this, you can stay at home. You too Castiel.”
Cas felt a presence at his back,The two strange men (who had remained silent throughout) were behind him, cutting off any chance at escape.
“I just wanna know why they get off fucking me over: why don’t you two ever get turned into dogs or have your memories wiped? Or, while we’re on the subject, why has almost everything bad happened to me in the past few seasons? Purgatory, the mark, being a demon, Amara –”
me if I don’t want to have to think about what this means right now, and just tell me we’re not going to talk about it so we can get the fuck out of here.”
“It’s nice to meet you Sam,” he said, trying to think of something else to say. “Have you had a nice day?” he asked, lamely.
“I don’t care. You’re gone, you understand me? One way or the other, you’re gone.” His voice was flat, controlled. Yet it was more threatening than his shouts had ever been.
“I’m fine son,” he said gruffly. “Just give me a little warning next time will ya: I’d’ve cleaned if I knew you were coming.” From the doorway, Dean snorted. Amazingly, John acted as if he hadn’t heard. He took a swig from his beer. “How’ve ya been anyway? How’s that girl of yours: Jennifer?”
him.  “It takes a lot of strength to resist the bull this world throws at people like u –” she corrected herself. “People like you.”
Missouri swore under her breath, standing. “That’s you, should get some ice on that bruise but I’ve done what I can. Now, if you’ll excuse men, I’m gonna make a phonecall.” She moved off, giving them some privacy.
“Well I met you, so not too bad.” They both laughed, the tension melting off of them as they sat together on the grass.
Jim looked up, surprised at the hush. He opened his mouth as if to speak, the abruptly closed it again, gripping his sermon tightly. “Ahh, folks,” he said, his voice heavy with remorse. “I hate to do this to ya, I know y’all’ve been waiting a good while for me, but I need a few minutes. I’m sure you won’t mind me leavin’ you in Pastor Walker’s capable hands.” He gestured towards the front pew, and Gordon rose smoothly. Dean saw him place a worried hand on Jim’s shoulder, saw a question half formed on his lips, saw Jim’s assurances as he pushed Walker forward gently.
“No,” Cas points to Dean’s chest, where his anti-possession tattoo is clearly visible, “it’s more recent than that.”
“That’s different, the dance didn’t mean anything.” Dean insisted stubbornly. “Marriage though... It’s better to be alone than to be with someone you don’t love.”
well this is it! thank you everyone for sticking with me through this and for all the encouragement. <3
The drive back is mercifully silent, Dean rests his head on Cas’ shoulder, glad for the exhaustion that excuses the contact, and pretends not to notice Sam’s worried brown eyes watching him from the rearview mirror. He focuses on watching the road and tries to push Harvey’s face, and hatred, from his mind.
Cas tugs at his arm insistently, and Sam lets himself be dragged from the memory, though he keeps his eyes trained on Dean’s silhouette, even as it fades into smoke and then into nothing.
Cas kissed him back with an almost reverent gentleness, amazed at the gift he had been granted. The weight that hand hung upon his shoulders for nearly ten years had transformed into a soaring, lifting joy.
The answer, though truthful, seems to displease John – judging by the way Sam groans softly from beside Cas. Although Castiel has never met this form of the older Winchester, he looms large in both Dean and Sam. Cas can pick out details – of expression, of stance – that his sons have inherited. The slight curl to John’s mouth is his only outward show of emotion, but it’s the exact same curl Dean has when some monster he’s been hunting is begging for mercy, which is enough to set Cas instantly on edge.
“You ignore me all week,” Anna interrupted him, quite willing to talk now, it seemed. “I don’t see you,” her voice rose, drowning out the music. “You make no effort to talk to me. In fact, you seem to be avoiding me to hang out with your boyfriend Castiel. And after I’d been nice to you, after I talked to you even though Hael and her group bitched about me for it, you can’t find the time of day for me and then you have to ask what’s wrong?” she was breathing  heavily as she finished.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean murmurs vaguely, and they get the sense he would be waving his hand to wave away their concern if he could stand without the pool cue. He squints up at them like he’s trying to figure something out. “You guys look weird.”
Both Hael and Dean had been rendered speechless at the outburst. The bitterness in Cas’ voice was almost too much for Dean. He wanted to reach out, to squeeze Cas’ hand. But he couldn’t of course, not while they here.
Dean shakes his head, smiling sadly. “You’re gonna see in a second anyway just…” he hesitates, looking at Sam. “...just remember what I said – no matter what, it’s always worth it.” He pushes the door open, and garish sunlight begins to spill out. As it touches his hands and feet they begin to dissolve. “Guess this is it for me,” he smiles, his voice tinged with both regret and relief. “It was good to see you – both of you. Here’s hoping we never meet again.” Then he’s gone.
Dean too had ideas of what was coming. None of them were good. He couldn’t say any of them out loud.
The sun itself is still there (burning fiercely white) and the sky is still a pure and overwhelming blue, but the pool, the loungers and Dean are plunged into shadow with no obvious source. A wave of cold has Cas involuntarily pulling his coat closer around him (an instinct he hasn’t needed since his brief stint as human). In front of them, Dean shifts uncomfortably: eyes slowly, reluctantly, fluttering open. Above him, the figure of John Winchester flickers in and out of existence – in time with the blinks. He looks road and hunt worn – clothing rumpled, beard unshaven, hair dishevelled, and there’s a faint scratch on his cheekbone (though he’s otherwise unharmed). His eyes, once he finally solidifies, are hard as flint.
“It’s something I never thought I could have,” Dean admits. “Not after everything I’ve done, everything I’ve been through it’s…”
There’s a flicker of movement, and Dean is wrenched upwards by John’s hand clutched bruisingly tight around his arm. His feet scramble desperately for purchase on the ground, John the only thing keeping him upright. “You think you know better than me?” He’s pulled Dean close to his face so he can whisper – but Cas can hear him as clearly as if he were in Dean’s position. “You think you can question
Hael took over Uriel’s shadowing duties for the rest of the day. She walked him to his classes even when she was in a different one, depositing him at a desk that was always near someone she considered appropriate. She needn’t have bothered. He and Dean did not share anymore classes.
The universe, he had long ago decided, was cold and uncaring at best, sadistic at worst. The best you could do was keep your head down and avoid its cruel jokes: to let yourself hope for more was to leave yourself open to pain. He said as much to Charlie and she giggled.
“That’s an understatement. Where are you?” Sam stretches his hand out, then withdraws it quickly when he hits something soft.
enjoyed the wonders of the San Francisco public library. Besides,” Dean grimaced, “she’s the only thing I can think of that will stop Cas and Charlie from doing their ‘I told you so’ routine.”
A smug cough drew his attention, and with a jolt of hatred he saw Uriel.  He was standing next to his father, a triumphant smile on his face as he watched Castiel’s disgrace. Cas could feel the anger bubbling inside of him, it took all his self control not to walk over and punch the arrogance off the small boy’s face. Instead, he walked, head high, to the seat next to Dean’s.
Dean was already there. Sitting alone in a chair in the middle of the room, staring determinedly at the floor.
“Nah he already told you,” Demon Dean says in an easy, almost bored tone. “I’m where you’re headed anyway – he’s just tryna save you some time.”
“Dean!” a voice barked from behind them. John Winchester stood in the doorway, wearing a ridiculously frilled apron that obviously wasn’t his, glaring daggers at his son.
“You know that’ll never happen. Listen, Dad’s more stubborn than you’ve ever been –” he held up a hand to forestall Dean’s interruption “– c’mon, you know that’s true. But he’s our Dad, and he still loves you, I know it. And I know
Turns out there are two Harvey Fitzgeralds. Cousins or something. One Harvey seems, by all accounts, to be a pretty nice guy who’s family are gonna get an awkward phone call tomorrow. The other Harvey though…
Dean meets his eyes, and then looks away quickly. “The closer you get to the exit, the more pain you’ll cause me. And the more you see, the less you’ll care about that.”
Dean just stared at him. It occurred, abruptly, to Sam that he too had changed. He wondered if Dean’s memories were undergoing a similar transformation: the awkward, gangly preteen Sam had been replaced with the tall, imposing adult he was now. The missing years seemed to hang, visible, in the space between them. One of them had to cross. “Hi Dean,” Sam tried again. “It’s, uh, it’s been awhile.”
“Uriel’s bearable, just. I can  just tune him out most of the time. It’s my father that’s the problem.”
Dean smiles, finally. “Thanks Cas,” he says. Then, more casually. “Y’know – you’re a really good kisser. And not a bad driver either.”
“Like you’re one to talk,” Dean pants, spitting more blood onto the ground without looking away. “What did you come here anyway? What do you want?”
“Please,” Cas continued, voice low with rage. “Will you leave me alone? I don’t want anything to do with you anymore.” They’d been saved by the school bell, which had forced Hael to return to her seat.
“Why don’t we start,” Pastor Novak began, voice controlled, “by havin’ Uriel tell you two what he saw?”
“Sam still thinks you’re a good man, deep down,” Dean shrugged, the movement lifting him from the doorframe so that he stood tall and straight. “Sure is sad to see him proved wrong.”
Sure enough, her face fell as she watched Dean fiddle. “He’s avoiding me too then?” She didn’t wait for an answer. “Well, what can I expect? He’s only young after all.” Her face brightened with interest as she regarded them.  “So then, what brings you two in here on a day like this?”
Dean laughs, leaning back in his chair, wiping away the last of his tears with the back of his hand. “I’ve never kissed anyone like that before,” he says. “It felt like…” he gestures with helplessly with his hands – one still entwined with Cas’.
Sam laughs, hollowly. “We practically lived on top of each other; in the same goddamn room half the time. You think I’d at least’ve smelt the smoke.”
“Ok, I believe that you’re at least a part of Dean,” Sam concedes. “But regardless of who – or what –  you are, how do we even know you’re telling the truth?
Dean was talking to a girl he saw as he drew closer. It wasn’t the same girl from lunch, she looked younger, and her hair was red. She laughed at something Dean said and turned away, giving him a small wave as she left. Dean stared after her, an unreadable expression on his face. Then he turned and saw Castiel hurrying towards him, and his face broke into a smile.
Fortunately (unfortunately) they don’t have to wait long. A longer series of deeply traumatising, unbearably happy moans, gasps and muffled cursing is followed by the sound of bodies crashing into a mattress. “Man,” comes Dean’s voice, between pants, “I can’t
That was the word wasn’t it? Castiel had grown up to the sermons; he knew what the bible said. Dean would know too. It was impossible not to in a town like this.
“Honestly, Sammy, I think I’m part of both,” Dean says seriously. “Look:” he stretches out his arms towards them as they turn translucent (flannel sleeves and all). The same multi-coloured fluid that was until recently circling lazily around them flows in the shape of Dean’s arms and hands: identical to the how the tunnel had looked, except for the ugly veins of green smoke that are slowly leaking into the surrounding colours. Sam and Cas gape in dismay until Dean pulls his arms away, the skin reverting back to normal.
“Where – ah.” Bobby cuts off. It’s obvious. Beyond where they’re standing like rows of trees: flattened by some (as yet) unknown force into an almost perfect circle. The grass too is pressed flat into the ground – even scorched in a couple of places. At the dead centre of the clearing is a mound of dirt with a wooden cross sticking out of it.
Jim was clearly disappointed, but what kind of father would berate his son for studying? “Alright boys, enjoy yourselves, if you can that is,” He flashed them his toothy smile, the TV one. “But be careful with that librarian, she’ll talk a load of bull at you if you let ‘er, you’ll be there for hours.” He added as he walked away.
how much of me that is. And when I broke, it was like my world ended,” he laughs hollowly, “and then I got out and I found out that the world
“His broadcast was amazing!” Hester was telling them, the eighth person to bring it up so far. “You must be so happy Castiel.”
“A spell trapped us in a magical representation of your consciousness,” Cas explains earnestly. “You are simply a memory or construction of yourself, one that represents a core of your identity and the last obstacle between us and the real world – ”
“How long have these been in here?” Sam asks as they perch precariously on the bonnet of the impala. It’s the same box, he realises with a chill, as the memory with Cas.
He didn’t have to reach for the next memory, it was always there. It would always be there. How was it that the good memories faded while the bad ones refused to leave?
This makes Dean cry harder. “He found out, didn’t he?” he gasps out. “That I didn’t do a good job. He hates me and that’s why he’s not coming back.”
“Well he needs to show his new catch off while he can,” Dean explained bitterly. “Before you outshine him and become homecoming king or whatever.”
Jim smiled again – his paternal, kindly one this time. “Go to bed son,” he said fondly. “It’ll be a busy day tomorrow; you’ll need your rest.
Missouri pulled back, taking him all in, meeting his eyes with such intensity that he was forced to duck his head. “You’ve changed,” she declared, “but not that much. Not like this one,” she jerked her head at Sam, who was watching with a bemused awkwardness.
Dean was surprised to find he was thinking about Castiel – he’d be starting today. They’d had a good time the previous night, and it would be nice to have someone new to talk to. Benny and Meg had eyes only for each other recently, and Dean was getting bored of third wheeling them.  Unlike everyone else Dean knew, Castiel’s eyes weren’t tinged with pity when they looked at him. They all seemed to pity him these days. Or they were angry at him.
By the time he finished, a tranquil air had settled over the church. The screaming mass of a few moments before had reverted to the familiar, friendly town.  Cas paid them no attention as he made towards his father.
It took every ounce of control in Castiel’s body not to run to him there and then.  Dean too looked about ready to jump into Cas’ arms, until he spotted Not-Missouri glowering at him. His face fell as he glumly took the seat opposite Cas.
“You know,” Dean says to himself, the only other himself on the otherwise bare stage. “It’s not like tricking Sam an’ Cas will actually do anything except piss them off. They’re gonna have to see it all eventually.”
“Aww you’ve gone all quiet,” Lucifer places deceptively tender fingers under Dean’s chin, forcing his head to turn and meet his gaze.  “What’s the matter…” he leans in closer again until his lips are almost brushing Dean’s once again. “…‘Cas’ got your tongue?”
At the sound of his name, Dean finally looks at him. His eyes are dim, but there’s a brief (and faint) flicker of recognition in them. “S-Sam?”
“No it’s not Dean,” John had sighed. “I expected you to be an adult after Mary’s death: I treated you as if you were. I was so worried that you’d lost your way. Instead of trying to help you back onto the right path, I pushed you further into the mud.” He’d managed a weak smile. “But, you’re back on track now Son, I know I don’t have to worry about you anymore. I’m proud of you.”
Dean snorts, “You think we have that sorta budget? For TV? Nah, this is just the hallway. Or the green room: they ain’t gonna waste their best shit out here,” he gestures towards the pools of shadows on the wall. “
“Loving you has always been easy,” Cas tells him solemnly, and the air between them feels almost solid. “Even when it’s hard.”
Dean had thus far been avoiding thoughts of his father. His involuntary shudder pleased Pastor Walker, for he continued, mercilessly. “He’s not taking it well, I’m afraid. This year’s been hard enough on him already, what with Mary passing, and now you’ve gone and made it that much worse.”
The other boy shrugged. “Don’t mention it, I’m the one who made it awkward to begin with. Shall we get out of here?” Castiel nodded, and they made for propped open door at the back of the gym. It led out onto the football pitches.
Dean had seen the worry playing out in his father’s eyes. He knew what it was about, it was always about the same thing, and he cast around desperately for something, anything, to put his father at ease.
“Dean,” John’s warning cut across the room. “Don’t you dare open your fucking mouth again!” The pure, unadulterated hatred in his words was enough to drain Dean’s defiance and he dropped his gaze to the floor once more.  John too retreated into his corner as Pastor Novak composed himself.
“Yeah well,” Dean pushes the door open, gesturing them over the threshold. “Maybe it’s time to explore a different relationship? Give someone else some screen time? You’ll break my goddamn heart – I hope you’re happy.”
“What the fuck are you talking about? Let me go.” He tried to tug his arm free, but Michael only tightened his grip.
“Linin’ his pockets with the word of the Good Lord,” Dean snorted. “Remember his radio show: ‘Any god fearin’ Christian knows that Sherman’s Soap is the only soap that cleans your soul as well as your hands…’”
She keeps her face buried against his body, hoping he won’t notice her tears. But he notices, of course, because there’s no sweat for them to mingle with, and probably because he’s an angel who can sense things down to their molecules. She feels him shift, try to pull away so he can look at her with concern in his eyes.  She responds by pushing herself closer.
want to Cas, and that’s enough for now.”  At the barriers, a group of elderly ladies are shouting at the woman, gesturing rudely in her face, one of them catches his eye and winks at him, waving him on. “Besides,” he smiles, “maybe this isn’t so bad after all.”
“But our kindness has turned into weakness. We’ve let this evil live among us for too long. We’ve excused his transgressions time and time again. We’ve opened our hearts an' our homes to him to be repaid in nothing but insolence and hatred.
Dean forced himself to stay calm. It would just be for tonight, John was hot headed but he cooled off with a good night’s sleep. He would be fine one night on his own.
to understand it for a long time either – it made things too complicated. But the more time I was around you – and other humans – the harder it became to ignore.”
He smiles to himself, “As you wish.” Then he vanishes, leaving Dean alone on the stage once more. The audience mutters: some seem annoyed, others seem scared, a few seem pleased. There’s rustling towards the back: and the crowd of Deans begins to part, their faces bearing expressions that seem equal parts surprise, respect and fear.
“No,” Dean says, reluctantly. “Cas said owed you something more. So, um, don’t be surprised if you see him coming out my room I guess – and, uh, don’t get all gooey whenever you see us kiss or whatever.”
“Go back inside, please. I’ll explain later, I promise,” Dean pleaded. To Uriel he added, “He doesn’t know anything, I haven’t done anything to him I swear.” The desperation in his voice must have been convincing, for he was suddenly being pulled away from his house and down the street.
“I wanted to reconnect with my father.” He hoped it was the right answer, though he doubted it mattered.
“Yeah, tell me what I missed: prom date, college, gay phase?” he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and Sam blushed: equal parts amused and angry.
Dean was beginning to panic. “No, please, Dad. You don’t understand. I need Sam. I can’t...I can’t be alone. Please.” He begged, caution and pride thrown to the wind. It was this, the grovelling desperation, so unlike the Dean he knew, that pushed John over the edge.
Dean is slumped on the ground, face mutilated and bloody (his own and Cas’). Lucifer (Sam) is standing over him, face a stone statue carved with an evil smirk.
Pls heed that some of the warnings have changed, there's a spoliery trigger warning in the end notes xx
“I should be somewhere along the way. I think I was heading in the right direction. Just not quite far enough...” Dean trails off.
“NO!” he shouted the word at the dark skies. His call echoed across the river he heard it repeated a thousand times.
“Yeah a couple of times, when he was really drunk,” Dean says lightly, like he’s talking about the weather. Sam supposes he is, in a way. “And another couple times sober – to teach me to dodge, he said. See what I mean? Where’s the line?”
“Photography: I do freelance work now. But,” Cas grabbed Dean’s hands in his own, “that doesn’t matter right now. All I wanted to tell you was that I didn’t want to leave you alone, and I’ve mourned our time together ever since: the years we could’ve had. Maybe we would’ve burned out after a few months, like young lovers often do. Maybe if I’d run with you, we’d live on opposite ends of the country and speak of each other only in hatred, but maybe we wouldn’t have: we didn’t get to find out and we never will. Those years were stolen from us, and nothing and no one can bring them back, but I want to try. I want to love you again,” He took a deep breath, “If you’ll let me.”
It was lunch time; Castiel had hidden from the omnipresent Hael and managed to sneak to Dean’s table. Without talking, Dean had led him outside onto the overgrown grass alongside football pitch. It was good to be outside, despite the muggy clouds. There were a couple of snotty looking freshmen eating together (too weird to sit with everyone else, too scared to ditch like the older kids) but apart from that they were alone.
By the time Cas has extricated himself from the passenger side, Dean is on his knees in the spotlight of the impala’s headlights. Cas falters – it’s an all too familiar scene, only this time reversed and he can’t quite bring himself to step into centre stage, considering what happened the last time. In the back of his mind, all the other times Dean’s been on his knees in front of him (the crypt, as god, as leviathan, even in hell – the twisted grey remains shaking on the ground in front of him, at once entranced by his light and mortally wounded by it, begging to be returned, to be burned) clamour for his attention – each trying to supplant themselves onto the moment happening now.
“Sammy,” he says. Then, confusingly, “If the situation was reversed, and I was dying – ” his voice is lower, rougher but also clearer – not the broken rasp that all that swelling and blood should be producing.
“Huh?” says real Sam, and the Sam in front of them freezes mid-swing – as if someone hit the pause button on the remote. “This isn’t how this happened. This is from – ”
Cas is waiting for them at the bunker – sitting stiffly in one of the most uncomfortable chairs, reading a book. He turns as they enter, his face splitting into a smile.
They had pulled up in front of the library by this point which, to Dean’s dismay, had not survived as well as the rest of the town: the painted sign was even more faded and peeling and the building itself seemed to be slowly melting into the pavement. Nevertheless, the sight of it filled him with the closest thing to happiness he was likely to feel on this trip. Sam, beside him, was smiling too.
Even for a small town in a Kansas heatwave, the streets were eerily dead. The heat rose off the tarmac in shimmering waves, but the flickering shadows on the horizons refused to resolve into living beings, instead revealing themselves as twisted trees, forlornly frozen in the breezeless air. More out of curiosity than to be cool, Dean rolled a window down, and was met only by the familiar smell of melting tarmac and the deafening screech of cicadas.
Bobby rolls his eyes so hard Dean’s surprised they don’t get stuck. “Oh yeah,” he says in a voice dripping with sarcasm. “There’s a real winner of an idea: re-visit all your most traumatic and painful experiences one right after the other with no back-up and no support.”
He turns and nearly walks into Sam and Cas, each with their own EMF meters. “Who were you talking to?” Sam asks
“You sure about that?” A familiar voice sounds behind them. It’s Sam, dishevelled and panting and bloody but with the lighter clasped triumphantly in his hand, extended over the open grave. “Cos it seems like you’re the one that’s burning.” Dean falls to the ground as Harvey is consumed, body and soul, in flames.
“Cas, I don’t honestly know if he’s been hurt, but if he has we ain’t doin him any favours by arguin’. Just stay here, please.” Missouri left before he could retort.
“I don’t have long, Uriel will be here soon. This weekend, go to the library. Go both days, just whenever you can get away. Stay as late as Missouri will let you. I’ll do the same, we’ll be able to talk properly.”
He barely spoke for the rest of the day. He managed to block out Uriel and the others, for the most part, and concentrated instead on finding a way to talk to Dean. He had no doubt that they were being kept apart, but he might have a chance in the last class of the day. He all but ran to the classroom, managing to shake off Uriel. He’d pay for it, but it would buy him the time he needed.
The spell bellows in agony, green smoke pouring from his mouth like blood. The form, the body shaped like Dean, collapses into a writing pillar of green before dissipating into the air around them.
not as he was and he’s just that little bit more vibrant than all the other Dean’s they’ve met, just that little bit more
Dean had finally torn his eyes from the floor to meet Cas’. The determination, the anger he saw, galvanised him. He managed to plaster a weak grin on his face, and meet the glares of the two Pastors and Uriel. He avoided John’s corner, however.
Warily, they approach the door. The shadows curl in closer towards them, and the young Dean presses his face into the older Dean’s chest. Cas reaches out, trying to put his hand on the handle – but it skitters away, repelled by some invisible force.
“Sam?” Dean is frantic, his eyes darting, his hands running over Sam’s arms and shoulders, cupping the back of his head – assessing for damage. “Shit Sammy – talk to me.”
“What are you gonna do then Dean? Live in the library? Hope that everyone just forgets what happened?” She made sure to keep calm, he would find it too easy to ignore her if she were angry.
“Nothin’ Sammy,” Dean tried to smile. It looked all wrong. He ruffled Sam’s hair to distract him. “I’m just tired of your snoring is all.”
“But what about Dad?” Young Dean sniffs, “Why isn’t he coming back? Is he angry with me? What did I do wrong?”
“– I was weak, I’m sorry. I know that I’m disgusting and beyond saving, but I don’t want to drag you down. I’ll understand if you don’t want to see me again.” He was crying now, the tremors running through his voice were enough to break Dean’s heart, never mind the tears running down his cheeks. “I’ll stay out of your way I –”
“Has it been bad?” It was a stupid question, of course it had been bad, but Cas wanted to ask it anyway.
“Pastor,” was all he said, his tone deliberately polite but neutral. Castiel found himself oddly relieved. He had grown so tired of the exaggerated respect the people in this town showed to his father and, by extension, him. It was nice to be treated like a real person again, however minutely.
Sam watched his brother’s face, but aside from a flicker in his eyes, he betrayed no emotions. “I’ll see you later Sammy. Gotta catch the bus.”
Sam allows himself to be pushed onto the sofa, Cas perching uncertainly beside him as Dean fusses with the TV. It only takes him a few seconds of muttered swearing before the title appears on screen. “Move your ass Sammy,” he orders – squeezing himself between Sam and Cas. “And Cas: relax. It’s a movie, not an exam.”
He clamped down on the words before he could say them. “Ok Sammy,” he said softly instead. “Let’s get this over with.”
A lone figure was relaxing at a desk, staring out the window. Before Castiel was really aware of what he was doing, he had already dropped into the seat beside him.
“Yeah,” Dean grimaces. “Look; there’s some pretty messed up shit in my brain and, no offence, but you two are the last people in the world I want seeing most of it. So I sent me to keep you two busy and safe while I look through some of the worst bits.”
Avoiding the “God Squad”, as Dean called them, became easier as the week dragged on. Castiel found himself suspiciously alone in between classes, and the seat next to Dean in the one lesson they did share had mysteriously opened up. Cas was sure that Jim had told Uriel (or had told his father who passed the message on) of his “mission” to save Dean, and that Uriel had passed the word on to the others. He wasn’t annoyed, it meant he could spend even more time with Dean while still fulfilling his “Preacher’s Son” role for the other students.
also, i think i'm massively exaggerating the importance of god and the church to these people but it's only to make the plot more melodramatic.
Cas hurried away, still glowing from the new nickname. It seemed to separate him from Uriel’s group and their stupid, outdated names.
“Thanks. Had to work like shit for it and I’m still paying it off but it’s been worth every penny.” There was no mistaking the pride in Dean’s voice. “How d’you find it by the way? It sure as hell wasn’t in the last postcard I sent you.”
Lucifer smirks. “For now. Though, now that I know you’re such an easy lay, I might have to stop by again sometime.”
“No?” Alistair asks innocently.  “Ah well, I guess you’ve already seen it all. How about you; angel?” With an amused tilt to his face, he throws the heart carelessly towards Cas – it lands his feet with a damp thud, still pulsing sluggishly.
“Have you noticed the pattern yet?” He asks, tantalisingly. “Been able to pick out the underlying theme?”
“Uh-huh. Senton High the next town over. You going there?” Dean either didn’t notice Castiel’s embarrassment or he ignored it, for which the other boy was grateful.
Dean’s raised head was a blond beacon of heresy, but he refused to look away from Cas. He was hoping for a repeat of last week, when their eyes had first met. He wasn’t sure what he could convey in a single glance, but he had to try.  Castiel’s head remained resolutely bowed until he heard his father’s “Amen”.
Sam’s hands grab Dean by the collar and throw him against the car, Cas can hear the snap of bones, the anguished gasp torn from Dean’s lips. Lucifer draws Sam’s fist back, and Dean grasps for his wrist desperately, futilely.
He shifts a little on his feet. “I’ll admit I’ve been…curious,” he says slowly, his gaze moving up and down her body in the familiar sweep that she takes as her cue.
bar. S’all the same after a while,” Dean looks around, taking in the sickly shifting interior and accepts it with a small shrug. “Guesss this must be all of ‘em. Maybe I’m in heaven?” He laughs again until it turns into a hiccup, hands slipping further and further down the pool cue.
“I’ll understand if you can’t forgive me. I just wanted you to know how deeply I regret it.” Now that he had started, it was hard to stop. “After everything you’d already been through I should’ve been there for you like you were for me. You were hurt and alone. I mean Dad had…and Uriel, the whole fucking town knew what was happening and they did nothing and I was so angry,
“Now folks, I’m gonna start with a story. It’s about two towns, you might of heard of ‘em. They were called Sodom and Gomorra.”
Dean sank to the ground, tears spilling onto his cheeks. “Cas,” he whispered to the air. “Cas where are you? Please. You have to tell me that Sam’s wrong. Where are you?”
“You know,” he says, feigning a yawn to cover up his smile when both Dean and Cas jump. “I’m actually kinda beat. Could you pull over so I can stretch out in the back? Cas can swap with me.”
The park is a shifting sea of rainbows and flags, almost garish in the weak daylight. The sky is an overcast grey wall, threatening ominously towards rain, but no one on the ground seems to care. Dean absentmindedly accepts a clear rain poncho from an official and uses it to obscure the EMF meter in his hand. He walks the perimeter of the event, keeping close to the metal barriers.  A group of teenagers with painted faces eye him with curiosity from the queue. He notices a printed ticket crushed in one of their hands.
“You make a good teacher,” Dean told him after a round of complex math problems had been (more or less) solved.
The uniformity of the road was broken by a long shape in the distance. It was a small bus stop, one he hadn’t known existed and he stopped to it out. This must be where you caught the school bus, if the graffiti that covered the walls was any indicator. Underneath several layers of dicks and profanities Cas could just about discern a timetable. A smile crept over his face as he examined it. There was a plan, a real plan, forming.
“You need to remember,” Sam doesn’t try to keep the desperation out his voice. “You don’t wanna do this.”
“No,” Sam says again, forcing himself forward – between the two Deans. Cas joins him, angel blade appearing in his hand.
“No it’s ok Dad.” Castiel assured him, “I think I just need some sleep. If I don’t feel better tonight I’ll go to the Doctor’s tomorrow.”
“Sammy,” Dean says, but it’s not either of the Deans currently squaring off. The four of them (two Deans, two not Deans) spin in surprise to find the other Dean limping up to the window. He doesn’t seem to be able to see them properly – his bruised and swollen eyes are fixed somewhere between Cas and Sam – but his face is determined. Slowly, with obvious difficulty, he raises his hand and wipes some of the blood away from his mouth, so that when he smiles it doesn’t look so monstrous. “Sam,” he says again, placing his hand on the ‘glass’ between them. It slides slightly, leaving a red smear.
“Yes.” Of course Dean had to say yes. He could put up with babysitters and sermons if it meant he could stay with Sam.
School. Dean would be there. Castiel wasn’t ready for it yet. He didn’t want to see Dean, to see the hatred that would surely be there, marring his green eyes, because of what he had done.
Dean had been rendered almost speechless by this. “Cas, what? I can’t ask you to do that, you should go somewhere safe. Find a family.”
The skin, and muscles have been carved away, the ribs ripped out and discarded carelessly on the ground. Dean’s heart (the source of the erratic beating) pulses furiously – fluttering and convulsing as his lungs expand faintly as he’s forced to watch it all. Now that they’re close, they can hear his shallow, frantic breaths.
Cas’ felt rage, white hot, pushing at him, urging him to speak. “Aren’t you at least going to give him a chance?”  His father’s gaze snapped to his, a fury to rival Cas’ own evident on his face.
Tentatively, Sam takes another drag – managing to keep from coughing this time. The ghost of their father floats in the smoke between them. “Why didn’t you ever tell me?”
“Nothing’s gone wrong! Why won’t you see that?” Cas was done. He wanted to go sleep, to pretend nothing had changed.
. He’s safe, happy and well fed – no thanks to you by the way that money you left us ran out days ago. He’s made friends and he’s had fun, and no one’s been hurt or hungry and no one’s asked any questions. So you know what? On the whole, I’d say I’ve done a pretty decent job,” he points defiantly at John, “an’ more than
“I don’t know when I became capable of love,” Cas continues, not looking at Dean. “But,” he winces at some inner pain, “from the second I knew that I could, I knew that I loved you. I’m not sure I know to describe it – I don’t know if human words could adequately capture it…” he trails off, eyes turning inward for a brief second. “…but it was like a new sun, or a new god came into being and caught me in its orbit...I was helpless…caught in this terrible, wonderful light…because of you,” he raises his head to watch the patchwork of emotions play out over Dean’s face. Fear gives out to hope gives out to grief – each as plain and easy to read as if they were written in pen on his cheeks. Sam has rarely seen his brother so vulnerable or so open, and he wonders (more to keep his mind from what he knows is coming than anything else) if Dean knows, if he’s choosing to share all this, or if he just can’t help it.
Dean woke around lunchtime, starving. Missouri set out some lunch for them and kept the conversation light. She could sense Dean didn’t want to talk about what was happening, and she figured he was owed a break at least. He couldn’t hide from the world forever but he deserved a break.
In retrospect, Dean could hear how rehearsed those lines were. How clichéd, how un-John like they’d been. At some level, he must’ve known it at the time. But he’d been so grateful that his father had even tried, and so assuaged by guilt that any doubts were immediately quashed.
Cas moves first, pulling the door fully open and stepping into the dark. Sam follows, but pauses on the threshold of the doorway. “What do you do next?” he asks, almost despite himself.
“Nope,” Dean interrupts, “you gotta wait for another homophobic ghost to attack me before you’re allowed to finish that sentence. C’mon, let’s find Cas. Oh and just so you know,” he adds, “the reason I don’t call Cas my ‘boyfriend’ is because I’m nearly forty not fourteen.” Sam snorts, but leaves him be.
. They were free, for a time, from the constant fear; from looking over their shoulders; from checking both sides of the road before holding hands.
The sound of a shotgun loading has them all spinning round.  For a moment, the three of them stare blankly at the empty space in front of them, before a small voice has their heads turning downwards.
He gave up on names early on. They were all biblical, like his, and old biblical at that. Hael, Raphael, Ezekiel. He wondered if they resented their names, as he always had. In among the Joes and Peters of his old life, Castiel had sounded pretentious and dated. Here, however, there were so many of them, that they sounded elevated, almost holy.
With a pained and garbled cry, Dean wrenches his head back, finally managing to free himself. A chunk of flesh stays behind, however, and blood splatters the tarmac – gleaming like uncut rubies in the pools of the impala’s headlights. Dean scrambles back until he’s resting on the car, eyes wide with unguarded fear and shame, blood dripping from his upper lip and down his chin. Slowly, he raises a trembling hand to his mouth, wincing as his fingers feel out the damage, smearing blood over his mouth and cheeks. He looks, suddenly, much younger than before.
Sam chews his lip, considering. “I thought I knew where he was coming from,” he says eventually. “I didn’t like the way he acted, but I knew he was only doing what he thought he had to. I never thought he really wanted to hurt us (you) just to hurt us, and that when he did it was always ultimately to keep us safe or make us strong. I didn’t like it, but I
The extra seconds of the gesture give Dean time to collect himself somewhat: he tenses noticeably, trying to draw himself up taller, even if his position on the ground renders him totally vulnerable. “Where’s Cas?” He demands hotly, covering his fear with anger. “What’ve you done to him? Where’ve you sent him?”
Dean had pushed into the church ahead of his father and brother, and he managed to save a couple spaces on the pews while they forced their way towards him. The sheer mass of people was astounding. Dean recognised a few of the younger faces from school, some of them were from towns well over twenty miles away.
“I wouldn’t waste your breath on him just yet,” Alistair steps between them, blocking Sam’s view. “I burst his eardrums a few weeks back. It’s just him and his heartbeat.”
Out of the corner of his eye he spotted Anna. She was clearly annoyed, and clearly alone. Where was Dean?
“Yeah but what about the first time it happened?” Dean holds up a hand to forestall him. “Yes it wasn’t
His phone buzzed an hour ago. It’s probably from Sam, but Cas doesn’t want to check. He can’t bring himself to tear his eyes away from where Dean’s are in the mirror – he’s scared that Dean will see him look away (as he has so many times before) and read abandonment or disgust in the gesture. So he pushes aside all distractions (Sam and his pointed gazes; the lingering human urges of hunger, pain and thirst (still not quite suppressed by his sluggish grace) that are vying for his attention; the noise of other cars on the road) and tries instead to put every emotion he can into his eyes. It’s a tactic he and Dean have been using for nearly ten years (albeit somewhat unconsciously) and he can see that it’s working as well as it ever does, which means: a lot is being said, but little is being understood – by either of them. Dean’s eyes have barely left his since the drive started.
“I wasn’t. I was just going to say that I don’t think I ever really understood it before,” Sam pauses, meets Deans eyes. “With Lucifer…well a lot of it is gone, but what I do remember is just pain, y’know? He only wanted to hurt me, to punish me for beating him. And no matter what he did to me
“Well I did carry a magically personified version of my psyche out of its metaphorical cage – that’s probably worth about twenty years of therapy.”
Sam reached over to knock, placing himself between Dean and the door. It all felt so wrong, to be hiding behind his little brother’s back outside his father’s house. They didn’t have to wait long. “Sammy?” The confused voice sent an involuntary shiver down Dean’s spine. “What’re you doin’ here son?”
Dean walks off the edge of the stage, landing on the damp grass. The audience watches with mild interest as he walks past them, Bobby close behind, towards the trees that have begun to spring up at the back of the room – trunks stretching and widening, branches unfurling, leaves popping into existence.
If he saw Cas today, would his heart still dance at the sight of him? The way it had back then? Or would he now just be another face? To be passed over in a crowd. A stranger. The thought pained him more than he could admit.
The air around the axe ripples and tears – one reality rending at the violent intrusion of the other. Sam can’t help but watch, transfixed as it slides through the air towards him (leaving an iridescent rainbow trail behind it like spilled oil on water) and he recalls a similar feeling of disbelief and wonder to the last time Dean swung this axe at him. A sharp jerk to his arm has him stumbling backwards and into Cas, the axe passing through the spot where’d he’d just been. It snags in the air and, while Dean is distracted pulling it out, Cas shoots Sam a look that’s one part concern one part annoyance. With an immense effort, Sam forces himself back to the past they’re presently in. Nodding to Cas, they both slide into defensive positions, blades in hands.
He had barely taken 4 steps in, when a vice-like pair of arms wrapped around his chest. “What the hell you doin’ back here you foolish boy?”
Sam hesitated for a second. “Four years ago,” he admitted. He owed Dean the truth. “When I started college.” He watched Dean’s face carefully, searching for…he wasn’t sure. Anger maybe? Or betrayal. But Dean’s face was carefully inscrutable.
a nasty little spell. Full of knots. And you’ve managed to get yourself all tangled up with it,” he grins a grin with too many teeth.
“Turn it off Sam. I’m up ok?” The shrill beeps cut off as Dean cast around for his clothes. He picked up a crumpled shirt and sniffed at it gingerly. It wasn’t too bad, considering...
Sam laughs, and the sound lifts Cas spirits in a way he hadn’t known he’d needed. “No, it wasn’t quite this bad. But Dean hated it – the pink I mean, he loved the pool – so it’s probably what he remembers the most strongly. Dad was on some hunt most of the time, so it was just me, Dean and the other motel kids,” He smiles softly at his sleeping brother. “It was a good summer.”
“Listen, Sammy, I have better things to do with my time than memorise a bunch of letters and flags,” Dean snaps. “
“You don’t need to explain,” Dean told him softly, “It’s ok.” He could read Castiel as surely as Cas could read him, and the hardship and tragedy written into Castiel’s body: his tightly held posture, the military precision of his hairline, the immaculately ironed trench coat and trousers. Castiel’s years, he suspected, had been as rigid and regimentally evil as his had been chaotic and frenzied. “He sent you somewhere didn’t he? To one of those ‘schools’.”
“Well, what can you do about it?” Bobby shakes his head. “You ain’t gonna be able to look through a whole damn life’s worth of memories on your own: not quickly at least.”
“Why does it matter? We’re still lost either way,” Cas answers sullenly when he asks. Sam is annoyed at his brother too, of course, but he can’t help but be amused at Cas’ petty resentment of being tricked.
He wasn’t dead; it wasn’t heaven nor hell that awaited him. It was Something. Anything. He had no idea what lay ahead but at least is wasn’t nothing.
In the time of their short exchange, another stretch of anonymous highway has crept in around them. It’s been raining, the tarmac is dimly reflective – a thousand tiny puddles from between the cracks weakly reproducing the stars above them. The impala is there – also wet, though Dean looks mostly dry. Like the last time, he’s sitting on the hood of the car, eyes open and watching them, a pack of cigarettes unopened by his hand. This time, however, he’s older, much older, close to the age he is now. When they notice him looking, he sighs. “I really didn’t want you to ever see this,” he tells them morosely, putting an unlit cigarette to his lips.
“Dean?” Cas whispers – the sound almost instantly vanishing in the darkness. Nothing changes, the sounds continue, and no demons or monsters spring their trap. Sam squints hopelessly into the dark, but nothing within it stirs.
“I have to stay. For Sammy. He’s already lost Mom, he can’t lose me too.” Dean’s voice was firm, but toneless. His face expressionless, shaking shoulders were the only sign of emotion.
Dean takes himself into his arms. He’s so fragile, like a baby bird, that’s he’s scared he may break himself. He remembers thinking the same thing about Sam (when he was young) and Cas (when he was human), painfully and intimately aware of all the ways he could hurt them.  Instead, he adjusts his grip and stands, kicking the fallen gun under the bed. “You’re not going to be alone,” he murmurs, “Not anymore. I’m going to take you with me.”
“I found it one of the times you were gone,” Sam tells him. “I forget which one exactly. It was a space to think, whenever it was.”
“Yup. Every single time. They seem to think if they do it often enough I’ll just give up or something and let the books rot.”
to think,” Dean lowers his voice in a sarcastic mockery of his brother’s:  “‘Poor Dean, forced to follow Dad’s orders until he became the perfect little soldier, too scared to think or talk back or stand up for himself, always sacrificing, always suffering. He never even had the
“Well come on then,” he says shortly, still watching the place where John vanished. “We all got places to be.”
changed the way I could feel.” He pauses, but Dean doesn’t speak, just makes a small noise in the back of his throat. He squeezes Dean’s hand – still under his – and continues. “I didn’t understand it for a long time; I didn’t
They part, and Dean leads Sam and Cas out through the front door. They step out, not into the street they’d glimpsed earlier or even the nothingness they’d come from, but back into the familiar bunker-like corridors lined with doors that are lined with dates.
“No!” she says, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. “I was only…look, don’t call it ‘copulating’ like we’re watching the discovery channel or something, it’s creepy! I just… you don’t want to die a virgin, do you?”
Jim grabbed his shoulders, pulling his face in close. “You don’t understand, boy. This is not a negotiation: this is
Cas laughed, properly laughed, for the first time in days. “It gives us an excuse to hide in a corner for a few hours,” he reminded Dean, revelling in the way those green eyes lit up at the thought. “And I imagine the library will be pretty empty today.”  He remembered what Jim had said. “What did my Dad mean? About the librarian?”
Sam’s instinctual wave of shock is almost instantly superseded by an even larger wave of joy which is quickly eclipsed by a veritable tsunami of dread.
It was true, Cas had felt Dean’s absence from his life as if it were a missing limb. It wasn’t enough to rely on memories of love when all that surrounded you was hate.  “How should we do it?” he asked eventually.
“I went home, or I tried to. Uriel was there, along with some friends. They weren’t pleased to see me.” Dean shrugged, trying and failing to act casually. “They wanted to teach me a lesson or something. Punched me in the face,” he pointed to the bruise on his face “Knocked me down, got a few kicks in too. Eventually they got bored I think.”
Dean ignored the envious look Sam shot him as left, he actually felt relieved. Now Sam wouldn’t have to know anything.
The congregation was stirring angrily at his words; Novak seemed to notice and made a deliberate effort to calm himself before continuing in a softer voice. “Folks, don’t despair, “You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.”  God is good, he is kind, and as long as there a folks like you around, Goodness will triumph. Now, my children let us Pray...”
Castiel had shoved a mouthful of food in his mouth so he didn’t have to reply. Instead he nodded and tried to think of a way to change the subject. By the time he swallowed, however, Jim had clearly thought of a more pressing matter, for he reached out to clasp his son’s hand. Cas felt his stomach sink. His father only did this when he wanted clarify or change an aspect of Castiel’s “character”. It usually meant a long lecture.
“What did you say? Where is it?” Instinctively, Dean steps closer, placing a hand on his shoulder and shaking gently. At the touch, the figure goes berserk, his eyes snapping open and meeting Dean’s – filled to the brim with pure fear.
He needed to be strong. Over the past month he’d built up reserves of happiness. Memories and sensations that he could hide behind as he stood next to his father, that let him tune out whatever hate was being spewed.
Sam reaches out to brush the bruise already forming on Dean’s arm, but, as before, he simply passes straight through. Dean draws back, as if burned.
Dean only shrugs. “We’ll see,” he says, gesturing over his shoulder. The door behind him slowly creaks open a few inches – and a soft light emanates from the other side. Along with it comes the faint sound of music, of people talking and the unmistakable smell of beer. “Let’s start with something easy, why don’t we? Get you two into the swing of things.”
“I can explain Sam, I promise.” He made to walk towards the door, but Michael’s hand clamped on his arm, trapping him in the driveway.
Dean’s eyes have been pried open. Delicate, spider web thin silver threads are preventing his lids from closing. His eyes are darting and twitching furiously, red-rimmed. His head is angled forwards and downwards, forcing him to stare down towards his chest.
“How’re you gonna face Mom one day and tell her that her family fell apart and you did nothing to fix it, huh? How’re you gonna look her in the eye and tell her that?” Dean seemed to stare through him, eyes glassy.
“Alistair.” And as Sam says his name, the demon takes on the more familiar form he remembers. “I killed you.”
. Finally, he stuffed his pockets with anything he could sell. The whole process had taken less than ten minutes. He even had time for a shower.
Cas was too caught up in everything to reply. He felt as if he had been made again, atom by atom, into someone who was at once more himself than he had ever been and completely new.
a dark part of his brain supplies) but that doesn’t mean he trusts him to keep them safe. At the same time, however, any movement (no matter the direction) is better than staying in this corridor, arguing about doors. Cas seems to have reached a similar conclusion, for he nods grimly. Uneasily, Sam steps forward, Cas close behind:  the door is too narrow for them to walk side by side. Dean closes the door behind them and it vanishes.
“We don’t have time,” Sam insists. “That’s nearly forty years’ worth of memories you’re talking about. We need to approach this strategically: start with the worst memories and work our way outwards.”
Dean chuckles, sadly. “You know I’d love to – maybe once things out there calm down a bit I can stop by.”
“Don’t you mention it. Now you get some rest now, some proper rest. When you wake up you’re gonna help me put this place back the way it was. That toilet brush of a lady’ll have busted my whole system to hell.” she was back in librarian mode,  the familiarity of it soothed him  as he lay on the sofa.
“I’m…holding him back,” Cas grits out. “Needed to tell you…” his voice disintegrates into another pained moan.
“Besides,” Dean interrupted. Under the table, he put his hand on Cas’ knee in an effort to take the sting out his words. “I can’t leave.”
“Not deliberately,” Dean says quickly, putting his hand on Sam’s wrist and squeezing until Sam’s fingers relax. “And not consciously either – I don’t think. It was just like, if I was being slow or not doing what he ordered he’d ask you to do it instead. He started taking you on hunts with us and I couldn’t let you get hurt, so it was easier to just do what he said and not think too much about it. He didn’t really care who did it – he just wanted it done.”
out to get us. I saved your ass more than a few times y’know, and his too – and how many times have we saved each other since then? Because of what he taught us. But for all that, was it any less cruel than the times he’d hit me? Or kick me? Or throw a bottle at my head?”
The third time he’s sure he must still be dreaming because Cas is driving the impala which shouldn’t happen, and he’s driving it one handed which
“I’m sorry.” He knew Dean would want an explanation; he hoped it wouldn’t scare him off. “At my old school,” he stopped, tried again. “I mean, people always used to call me – y’know.” He knew he wasn’t being terribly clear, but he didn’t want to say it. Mercifully, Dean understood.
“Sammy, I know you’re lying.” That must be why he’d turned away. They’d always been able to read each other’s expressions like a book. He’d moved to sit next to Sam on the bed.  “What’s the real reason, just tell me. Please.”
“Oh so we’re gonna have a rematch are we?” Dean smiles. “You think you’ll manage without Cas’ grace-ex-machina from last time?” He laughs in genuine delight at their stony silence and grim expressions. “Done with talking too? Fair enough. Just know – ” he strikes abruptly towards Cas, who blocks him, then swings back, easily dodging Sam’s lunge. “ – this hurts me way more than it could ever hurt you.”  He gestures vaguely as the third Dean (not their Dean, but the closest they have right now) making a noise of frustration and pain, drops to his knees. The blood from Lucifer’s attack is still dripping sluggishly from his mouth and landing on the ground. As the demon swings his axe experimentally, Dean flickers briefly.
“I’m gonna ask for directions,” Dean says, then pushes his face into the shadow before Bobby can even open his mouth to reply.
John had fallen for his lie. He thought Dean was the model son once again, back on the road to happiness. In reality, Dean was only pretending to be his son.
Now the silence is awkward – Sam casts about for something to say, and settles on one of the least important questions currently on his mind. “So…you let Cas drive?”
His words tore through Dean like bullets. They left empty gaping holes bleeding pain and sorrow.  All he could feel was the pain: that and the hot tears on his face. “Sammy...”
“To satisfy my curiosity,” Lucifer shrugs. “It occurred to me that, we’ve never really spent much quality time together – in this timeline anyway. I barely know you.”
The kid laughs hollowly. “He says this whole ‘trans thing’ is just me trying to get attention and that I’m an idiot who doesn’t understand biology. He threw a fit when he found out I was coming here today. I had to sneak out the window.”
“Looks like you’re stuck in the bible belt for now,” he said as Castiel gathered his things, trying not to let the disappointment and embarrassment coursing through him creep into his voice. It was stupid. He was being stupid.
The archaic word stunned Castiel, and he was unable to speak as his brain processed the absurdity of it all.  “Heathen?” was all he managed in the end.
“And when he said ‘I don’t know when I became capable of love’, he was lying too. I’ve always been capable of love.”
“What are you doing?” Alistair hisses, lunging for the blade, his hand freezing in mid-air as the tip pierces Sam’s skin.
He heard distant squealing, and a few triumphant hands patted him on the back. Hael had told them all the good news, he supposed.
Dean shrugs. “Things got pretty bad after that and –” he looks at Cas, meaningfully.  “–pretty complicated too. There was the whole apocalypse thing to deal with, then you died and I was with Lisa. Then you were back but didn’t have a soul and then there were the leviathan and then I was in purgatory and then there were the trials and then there was the mark and then and then and then…” he trails off, eyes bright, and stops walking. “They probably figure I’m dead; and that’s probably easier at this point.”
Dean climbs warily to his feet, but John makes no further moves towards him, just watches him contemptuously for a moment, his eyes sliding down to the imprint of his shoe – overlaid on the existing bruise on Dean’s ribcage. “Put a shirt on first,” he says before turning and walking towards (Cas assumes) the impala.
The details of the classroom likewise slipped from his mind. It looked like every other classroom he had ever been in. There was still five minutes until the bell rang, and teenagers clustered together, talking loudly.
John laughed cruelly. “When did you get so goddamn naïve Sammy?” He shook his head in disbelief “Lettin’ someone like that worm his way back into your life after
Her first instinct, of course, is to look towards his groin. His dick (she’s both relived and faintly disappointed to see) is a pretty normal looking one. It’s soft, but she doubts it will stay that way for much longer. Curiosity satisfied; she takes in the rest of his body.
“The way he described falling in love with you – he twisted it and made it sound painful. It wasn’t.”
“Better than the kid with the dead mom,” Dean assured him, dropping his arm to his side. Castiel shivered slightly as the warmth withdrew. He glanced sideways at Dean, who had withdrawn slightly. He was pulling the sleeves of his shirt down over his hands as if he too were cold.
The tunnel is small and cramped, but he forces himself in. The air grows hotter and hotter and the smell of sulphur grows stronger as he descends, almost unbearably so. It’s a strange reverse of the original event:  instead of widening, the earth seems to close in around him and push him upwards, as if it’s trying to force him back to the surface. Every molecule of his mind is telling him that this is a bad idea, but he grits his teeth and powers through. Eventually, painfully, he hears a crack and the earth crumbles, depositing him in a dirty heap at Bobby’s feet.
“Idjit,” says a gruff voice, and Dean looks up in surprise as Bobby elbows his way to the front. He’s greyer than he was in life, and slightly more wrinkled; trucker cap somehow more battered. He looks, Dean figures, how he thinks Bobby would look today. Or maybe he looks how Dean treated him as looking. “You know that’s exactly what the spell wants.”
His heart leapt when he saw the familiar shoulders slumped across the desk, a large part of him had worried that Dean wouldn’t even be in, and he sprinted across the room. “Dean.”
With both of them gone the room begins to spin: faster and faster, a whirlwind of colour and noise. The semi-coherent shapes of the bar and the people begin to blur together into a sickly rainbow hurricane. It resembles the tunnel they’d been walking through before, except this time there’s no glass protecting them. Stuck in the rapidly shrinking eye, Sam yanks Cas closer and they huddle together as the floor beneath them begins to shake violently.
“Wound or disarm, but don’t kill,” Cas suggests, slashing towards Dean’s arm with his blade. “Try to get around him. We just need to get through that door.”
Reluctantly, Cas twists his head round, then almost immediately brings it back to face the wall – it may just be the light, but his cheeks appear slightly pink. “There are no doors anywhere in this room,” he informs Sam, a little shortly. “Dean must not remember them – he is rather distracted after all and probably has other things on his mind.”
“Dean, do us all a favour and get some clean shirts.” Sam said from across the room. He was already fully dressed and his eyes were disgustingly bright considering the time. Dean made a face at him.
“He also said ‘ends’,” Cas points out wearily. “Which would suggest a later memory. I think he meant it more…metaphorically – a memory that forms the basis of Dean’s self.”
Bobby seems to soften. “I know, son,” he says. “You’ve been through more than most of us, and now you’re going to have to through it all again. This whole situation is shitter than a gas station toilet – but at least it’s nothing you haven’t done before, and,” he looks directly into Dean’s eyes, “at least this time you don’t have to go through it alone.”
“Me? What about you?” Dean deflects, “You’ve gone from being an angel of the Lord to some ‘unholy faggot’ ‘cos you started stickin’ it to a dude, and you’re just ok with it? With falling for me?” Before he’s even finished saying the words he regrets them. “Shit Cas, I’m sorry I wasn’t thinking.”
“What’re we gonna do Cas?” Dean had forced himself to ask. He’d tried to avoid the thoughts, had pushed them to a far corner of his mind, but they came creeping back every time.
Sam goes cold. “You used me to break Dean? To break the first seal,” he croaks, voice failing him in his shock.
“If you won’t tell us, I guess we’ll have to ask Sam.” He raised his voice, so that his words would carry to the younger Winchester, watching anxiously from the porch.
“Yes,” Cas says irritably. “The spell was designed to trap us: it’s going to use anything it can find to distract or hinder us from finding the exit and to keep us from accessing it,
“Yeah,” Dean snickers, “Cas said. It’d make me worried about you and your powers of observation if you hadn’t already survived this long.”
“And maybe if you stopped running headfirst into danger,” Cas interjects from the side, voice strained, “you wouldn’t always be the first to get hit.”
The figure pauses, chuckles lowly, then grab’s Dean’s heart and squeezes viciously. Dean wails in agony – tearing the skin and flesh at his shoulders and hands as he tries to tug away. Blood spurts sluggishly from his wounds, leaving shining trails on his already scarlet skin.
Dean pulls back – just to breathe – then kisses him again. And again. And again. Each time is exactly the same as the one before it – except that they’re each totally different. Each kiss brings that same rush, that same joy, even as the physical particularities change. The closest feeling Cas can remember – the only feeling somewhat comparable – is the moment of his own creation (back when everything was created) when, for one brief second, he had been everything all at once. Every possible shape, every possible thought, colour, action, wish, dream, desire – he had felt them all, had been them all until suddenly he wasn’t anymore. Until now.
“I know honey,” she lay a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I hope he can get away before you go.” She felt him tense up, but pushed on anyway. “It would be for the best if you two left together, but if not – ”
“That’s not what I mean.” Dean didn’t want to destroy Cas’ hope, but he needed to make him see. He tried to be gentle. “Where will we live. How will we eat?”
Dean didn’t hear a word of what Pastor Walker was saying. A sense of foreboding had settled over him, and he silently urged Gordon to talk longer. Anything to avoid whatever was coming next. He didn’t know where it was coming from, this dread, but it filled his ears with his heartbeat as he forced himself to stay seated. Every cell in his body wanted to be somewhere else right now but he had to stick to the plan.
“Well you don’t got to wonder no more: I’ve got another one for ya. Specially made – just for you. Just so you can see exactly how I feel.” Next to Dean, the wall begins to stretch and thin, becoming transparent. “May I present,” Dean says with a flourish, “the window to my soul.”
He had thought his confusion started when Mom died, he could see now that it had always been there, but her love had helped him cope.
“Only eight? C’mon Sammy you can do that in your sleep. Betcha I can get ten! How many d’ya think you’ll get Castiel?”  Trying not to look at each other the two older boys joined Sam at the river bank, the Sun low in the sky.
“Hmm I don’t think you’ve learned your lesson yet Dean.” Uriel shook his head with mock sadness. “Your kind, see, your kind are persistent. We may have scared you away this time, but you’ll only try again when you think we aren’t around.” He nodded at Michael who grabbed Dean’s other arm and trapped them behind his back painfully.
“This didn’t happen,” The real Cas is muttering, and Sam is beginning to suspect where this is going, and he wishes fiercely that it didn’t need to happen, or that they didn’t need to watch it happen – that they could somehow skip all the way to the end and pretend. Like it could ever be that easy.
“Yeah well, what can you do?” The kid smiles, “that was nice of your brother to do though,” his face falls, “wish mine was like that.” Looking closer, Dean can see that, despite the bright colours, the kid’s clothes are ill-fitting and crumpled in the way that only clothes that live in a duffle bag crumple. He feels an abrupt pang of kinship with the teen.
Olsburg wasn’t used to it and the town seemed to be melting in on itself, the flowers collapsing in sweaty heaps in front of parched lawns in front of neat houses.  The windows and doors had been thrown open, uncaringly baring their contents to the world. It wasn’t as if the occupants had much to worry about, with a population of just over 300, Olsburg hadn’t had a serious crime in over 20 years.
This should make them all happy, he thought bitterly. His father would love Hael. He would hold them up as shining examples of American youth in one of his next sermons. He wondered if Dean was going to the dance. He hoped so.
“A representation,” Cas agrees. “One you literally set free from the room it was locked in. You radically altered your emotional landscape. It’s not surprising that you may not know how to react anymore, or that you may not be able to suppress your initial emotions and reactions. You left the door open after all.”
That just makes Sam laugh harder. Cas looks round, curious, before something the vendor says distracts him again. Dean glares at his brother for a while longer before relenting, slapping his now doubled over younger brother on the back.
“No,” Missouri was firm but gentle. “You want this. It’s not the same thing. Do you really want to risk your brother’s safety and happiness on the off chance your father will pull his head out his ass long enough to listen to reason?”
It was a little awkward, neither one of them had much experience after all. Castiel leaned in a little too heavily, causing Dean to smack into the church wall. He moved both his hands into Cas’ dark hair, but soon found his nose squished uncomfortably against the other boy’s cheek.
“There is this dance on Thursday though,” He said, watching his father’s eyes carefully. “There’s this, uh, girl – Anna. I’m going with her. If she says yes.” He tried to emulate the embarrassed pride he’d heard in Sam’s voice, as if he really was interested in Anna in that way. He was rewarded by John’s wide smile.
. Everything is too large – the table and chair are abnormally tall– the seat about level with Dean’s head. The two beds loom ominously and stretch upwards well beyond what their actual size should allow. Between them is a small crib, the only thing in the room that’s the correct proportions. The shadows are strangely angled and contorted, flickering at the edges of their vision as if alive. Sam flinches as a clawed hand reaches from the corner of his eye, but by the time he turns to face it, it’s gone. Everything is deathly quiet and, overpowering the normal motel smell of cheap detergent, is the unmistakable smell of smoke: thick and cloying.
“But I have thought it haven’t we?” Dean points out. “Who knows how many times? And for how long? You ever wonder about that: Sam?”
They had shifted closer, just like in the library. This time, however, there was no one to see them as they embraced. No one to see their lips meet for the third time. No one to see them sink onto the bed. No one to see Dean’s arms wrap around Cas; no one to see Cas’ hands cup Dean’s face.
“That boy is godless,” Uriel seemed to think Castiel’s shock came from his revelation about Dean, for he continued in the same pompous tone. “He doesn’t go to church, he doesn’t respect god. If you knew what he said to my father...”
“I can see the path, but not the destination,” Deans says wryly, shaking his head. “That door should take you one step closer: and each me will be able to point you on,” he shrugs again. “Probably. I dunno how I know – bit of a plot hole really – but it sounds right, doesn’t it?”
Sam’s frown deepened. “What do you mean? Why can’t he come near me?” He turned to his older brother. “Dean where’ve you been? Why are you still wearing those clothes?”
It feels a little strange to be in the front seat. There is, he notices with a jolt, nothing between him and Dean. If he wanted to (if Dean wanted him to) he could reach out and grasp his thigh. He knots his hands in his lap instead.
Dean makes a small hiccupping noise – jolting Cas back to the present. Trying not to think of much, he steps up to Dean, dropping down so they’re at roughly the same height. The gravel presses into his knees – each stone an individual sensation even through the thick cloth of his pants. Slowly, almost too slowly to bear, he reaches his hands towards Dean’s face. At the sight of them Dean flinches involuntarily, and Cas freezes instantly (a part of him wondering how many times since ‘then’ Dean has shed from his touch and he hasn’t noticed, or has noticed but callously dismissed it as emotional repression or general skittishness. How many times has Dean ignored the pain and betrayal to maintain his friendship? How many times has he prioritised Castiel’s happiness above his own?) his hands hovering in the air between them. Dean makes no further move to pull away, however, so Cas lets his hands move to either side of Dean’s face – tilting it upwards until they’re eye to eye.
“I think he’s trying to sneak home.” Uriel’s malicious delight was plain to hear. “You don’t think we’d let you do that?”
“Strip,” she orders Cas. There’s a bottle in her other hand and she takes a grateful swig against the cold air she knows is coming. “I’m doing it too, see? And smile! This is gonna be fun, Cas.”
. “It’s me,” he says as looks down at himself. There are few scratches on his face and arms, blood splatters on his shirt and a haunted look in his eyes, but otherwise he seems unhurt. “More or less.”.
“I asked to speak to you alone,” Hael snapped back. “You’re the one who insisted on doing this here.” She’d taken a deep breath and tried to continue. “We’re still willing to offer the hand of friendship to you Castiel.  Considering who you are, who your father is, we think it’s best for you.”
“Exactly: you’ve seen him naked many more times than I have,” Cas says, sounding more like a petulant twelve year old than an ageless celestial being.
The question stopped him, his arm raised mid swing.  As far as most people – Pastor Novak, Uriel and his gang, even John – were concerned Dean was already damned.  But it was wrong, he knew that.
He smiled at the thought. The world seemed to get brighter, the sun warmer, and it was a struggle not to get too far ahead of Sam.
“I love you,” Dean told him when they broke apart at last. “I need you. Please tell me you can stay.”
Dean regards himself suspiciously for a few moments, then nods reluctantly. He slides off the bed and takes his hand (the gun hanging from the other) – leading himself over to the crib. After a moment’s hesitation, he pulls the quilt down, revealing nothing underneath.
“Simple: you two get out of here and get back to fighting Lucifer or Michael or whatever Big Bad we’re up to right now, and you don’t even have to pause for an episode or two to get this shit show back into working order.”
“Keep swearing? That normally helps” Cas laughed, and Dean revelled in the sound. “How you getting home?”
He hadn’t paid attention to where his feet where taking him, yet he wasn’t surprised to find himself home.
They were pulling up to his school now, he slid out the car waving to Sam and John as they pulled away. Bag hanging casually off one shoulder, he spotted Castiel and his mood lifted. He made his way towards him, but stopped when he realised Castiel wasn’t alone.
“No.” He tried to convey strength he didn’t feel into the word. “We love each other. It’ll be enough. It has to be.” They were screwed otherwise.
“Somewhere else that’s even worse than hell for you, somewhere so bad you’re refusin’ to even let yourself think about it, somewhere you’ve buried so deep you don’t even know what it is or where it is or even what it means anymore.”
The two Dean’s square off – one standing calmly with a sly smile on his face, the other tense and poised: a look of cold contempt twisting his features.
“Then I got nothin’ to say to you that I ain’t already said before.” He took a step towards Dean, who remained still.
“It shouldn’t be too far after that,” Dean frowns, “not sure how I know, but we’re near the end. Thank fuck,” he smiles a weak, bloody smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “I’m so fucking tired.”
“I think it has to be me,” Dean says. It takes a little juggling and nudging, but he manages to coax a small hand from around his neck, stooping slightly so he can reach the door. He pushes the handle down, but pauses, twisting his head round to look into his own eyes.
“Even dorkier than usual, somehow.” Dean laughs at the squint/glare Cas throws at him, “I’m joking, I’m joking. You look good. Like always”
“Huh,” Dean grunts, “so you’re saying that we’ll have to search through my memories and shit in order to find the door back to reality but that the spell is likely to try and throw up distractions and barriers in order to keep us trapped in here for as long as possible and cause as much pain and division as possible?”
John was close to tears. “Thank you Jim, listen there’s something else as well,” he looked and the crowd still gathered around them and leaned closer. “But I was hoping we could talk about it in private. Maybe later?”
A small noise has Sam turning to look at the other Dean – still rooted to the spot. He’s been so quiet all this time that Sam had forgotten he was there. There are tears trailing silently down his face as he watches his younger self, dripping off his chin and onto the floor. Sam’s eyes upon him seems to snap him out of whatever state he’s been in, for he wipes the tears away, nodding at whatever it is he needs to see in Sam’s gaze. He walks forward until he’s in front of his younger self and kneels down so they’re at eye level. “Hey,” he says softly. “Can I show you something?”
“I’m allowed to think of more than that, and you are too. We’re both our own people,” Sam says gently. It’s the same things he said back then, though it’s only now that it occurs to him how patronising he sounds.
“Is there any way you can, I dunno, speed it up a bit?” He asks Alistair. Except it’s not him asking – he’s still on the rack. Yet he’s also peering over Alistair’s shoulder at himself, curious and satisfied at the sight of himself so close to breaking. “They’re getting closer.”
Dean laughed, the low sound at once warmly familiar and achingly foreign. “Of course she did,” his smile faded as he watched Sam carefully. “What else she tell you?”
The church quickly filled, and the congregation crowded closer and closer together. There were even more people than in previous weeks, Jim’s radio broadcasts were clearly doing something. The chatter was amicable, but loud. At the head of church, Jim continued to examine his notes, seemingly oblivious to the crowd. Eventually, however, a restive silence fell as the anticipation became almost palpable.
“No,” The Cas beside Sam is whispering to himself. “That’s not it. That’s not how it felt. He’s twisting everything up, poisoning it…”
Dean didn’t understand how simply looking at Cas was causing him so much pleasure. He leant his head on Cas’ shoulder, it was all he could do while they sat side by side, but he relished the contact none the less.
“Ah come on! You’re a rebel now, Cas; you don’t got to care about what’s appropriate anymore. Besides – ” she shrugs out of her jacket and starts unbuttoning her shirt “ – this way, no matter what happens, you get to say you’ve been inside me before Michael,” she laughs and is only half joking when she says: “maybe if you defile me enough, they won’t want me as a vessel anymore.”
“...bad out there folks. In some places they’ve stopped attending church all together. They think that if they’re baptised as a baby and married there as an adult, they’re sorted for life! They don’t understand that God don’t just accept any moocher! What they don’t understand is that faith is a lifelong commitment...”
“And how,” Cas asks morosely, “do you propose we do that?” He spreads both arms out to encompass the eternal tunnel stretching on either side and, in all likelihood, the hopelessness of the situation.
“Why did you lock it?” Sam presses his hand against the door, but draws it back almost immediately with a hiss of pain. “Shit. It’s hot.”
Cas snorted derisively. “They switch between guilt ridden at not realising I was being ‘tempted’ to awe struck at how my father rescued me from the jaws of sin.” His face fell as he remembered their conversation that morning. “I’m not sure Dad trusts me though, he’s suspicious.”
“Uh yeah, of course.” Did they care about anything other than Jim, he wondered. It didn’t seem like it.
Sam registers these gruesome but expected details quickly, his mind pushing them to the periphery of his perception – he can come back to them once the focal points are processed.
They were still talking about this? “Well...” the truth was Cas hadn’t listened to the broadcast, but he couldn’t admit that now. “Umm, I thought they were, uh, interesting. An unusual choice. ”
“You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.” He fought to keep his voice calm. All three had moved closer yet he was routed to the spot in anger.
They were the same height now, Dean realised. John still held himself straight and proud, but the solid mass of his body had begun to soften at the edges: his strong muscles smoothed by the fat of age and booze. His clothes were clean but worn: the shirt crumpled and fraying, a button on one of the sleeves missing. His hair and beard (frozen at salt and pepper in Dean’s memories) was almost completely grey now. His once sharp eyes were a little bloodshot and framed by harsh wrinkles.
was always something I could hold on to – the satisfaction of winning. It felt worth it most of the time. You never got that. He never tried to turn me against myself, or make me hurt other people. He never unmade me, except for literally.” There are, he’s mildly surprised to realise, hot tears threatening to brim over his eyes. He blinks them away furiously. Now is not the time.
“This desk is already taken Castiel; the only spare one is with us.” Victory assured, he returned to his side of the room. Dean smiled wanly at Castiel.
“Careful now, Castiel,” Uriel didn’t even bother to keep the gloating tone from his voice. “You wouldn’t want your father to think you’ve been disrespectful would you?”Silence was his only reply.
“You think you’re the only ones that’ve ever fallen in love? You think you’re the only ones that had to make these choices?” The tears were falling in earnest now.  Missouri sank onto the sofa, hands over her face.  Dean and Cas watched, unsure how to proceed. Eventually, Missouri raised her head again, back under control.
“Yeah,” Dean’s voice was surprisingly confident, and there was a slight grin on his face. “You got anythin’ you wanna say to me Dad?”
he is, now. And what could I say after all these years? Sometimes the past has to stay past y’know?”
Cas takes a long time to reply. Dean’s half expecting him to just get up and leave, but instead he sits upright. Dean follows suit and Cas turns to him, eyes dimly illuminated through the thin curtain, the orange of the street lamps rendering them a murky brown. “I won’t pretend that the transition from angel to human – or whatever I am now – has been easy,” he says. “Humans are so...physical compared to angels. I get hungry now, and tired. And my back hurts when I sleep in the car and my nose runs and my breaths smells. And my emotions are so…manifest now. I don’t just experience anger or joy or sadness as abstract concepts, I
His wandering eyes settled in Castiel, the Preacher’s son, sitting in the front row. His dark head was bowed in apparent prayer, but he seemed to sense Dean’s eyes on him as he looked up, twisting in his seat. His eyes were a bright blue, and Dean was so distracted by them that it took him a few seconds to realise he’d been caught staring. He blushed, quickly dropping his gaze and mimicking Castiel’s pose .He supposed if Castiel would be in his class at school. The whole town was curious about the boy: he had lived with his mother until now, and Pastor Novak didn’t like talking about her. Dean wondered why he was here: maybe something had happened to his Mom too...Thinking of school reminded him of the Dance next Thursday; he supposed he should ask someone. But Benny had already asked Meg, and he didn’t know any other girls that well. There was Anna in his chemistry class, who often smiled at him across the classroom. Meg said she liked him: that she asked about him in PE, but the thought of asking her made his throat contract. He didn’t know why, he’d talked to Anna a couple times and she seemed nice but...
“...No Morals! No grasp of proper family values!” Novak was shouting. “They let their children cavort with the depraved and then they come cryin’ to me when their sin leads to woe, as if they haven’t already spit in the hand I offered to them, spit on the good book, on the lord himself!”
He’s barely finished the sentence before Sam pulls him into a hug. It’s quick but fierce, and they both come away smiling. “Ok, I promise to stop trying,” Sam laughs. “But before I do, let me just say that I’m so proud –”
The town of Olsburg seemed to grow out of the horizon. Dean and Cas walked as slowly as they dared but the houses came closer and closer with every step. They’d avoided the road, kept to the fields, so no one had seen them. Yet.
The surprise of seeing Cassie has temporarily eclipsed any revelations around Dean’s sexuality, but Cas’ words bring them straight (heh) back to the fore.
“Yeah,” Cas could see it clearly now. “And if it sounds like I blame you for everything, he won’t suspect that we’ll still be seeing each other. But what about you?”
“We should be fine, he goes to sleep early on Saturdays, but I’ll just say umm...” He drifted into a heavy silence. They both knew how dangerous this was, there was no innocent explanation after all, but neither of them wanted to move into a more acceptable position.  “He won’t come in,” Cas had finished lamely.
He wanted to speak to Dean once class was over, but Uriel grabbed him practically the second the bell rang. As he was pulled from the classroom he caught Dean’s eyes and gave a helpless shrug, receiving an amused smile in return.
“When I rescued you from hell, and when I started to watch over you on earth,” Cas continues. “It brought me into contact with a side of humanity I’d never been allowed to see before.”
“But Sam knows those two memories ain’t exactly exceptions – hell, they’re basically specimens,” Dean laughs. “Sammy’s always known what he is and what he does – haven’t you Sammy? Sucking the life out of my life, isn’t that right?” Sam visibly flinches and Dean laughs again. “What? Nothing to say in your defence?”
Missouri’s words seemed to follow Dean as he fled into the cool evening. It was still light, but the sun was weak in the murky streets. By the time he reached his street he was panting heavily, the thoughts he had tried to outrun still crowding his mind. He approached his house slowly, relieved at the empty driveway. He was searching for the spare key when he heard a shout.
“Well I’ll be honest with you, it won’t be easy.” Jim continued, “but it doesn’t have to be so hard either. Each and every one of you has resisted temptation before, I know it and the Lord knows it and both of us trust that you can do it again. Remain strong, remain vigilant.
“And if you do see someone falling to sin, do not despair. Christ is love, and he will accept any past sinner once they have renounced their evil ways. But,” his tone darkened abruptly, and his voice began to rise again, “if they refuse redemption, if they refuse God, then we must be strong. Once someone has refused forgiveness they ain’t a child of god anymore, they’re a child of sin, of the devil himself. Do not think you can save them, for you may end up damning yourself. Do not be slaves of man, be servants of the Almighty God
Dean jerks his head upwards, but when his eyes meet John’s, Cas is taken aback at the sight of an all too familiar glint in them. “Neither,” he states, voice steady.
hello i recently remade tumblr, so come chat to me there if ur enjoying this fic. it's: https://fanficanthropologist.tumblr.com/
“And,” Dean cuts in, holding up a hand to silence him, “it’s likely that the spell will be able to access said memories as well as my dreams and desires to construct whatever it thinks will be most effective at achieving this end? And that it will likely hide the exit in the most private and painful part of my brain it can find? Forcing us to explore my most traumatic or most shameful experiences? ”
There was an ominous quality to his words that jibed with his gentle tone. Cas shoved his misgivings aside as he headed upstairs. Everything was going fine. He was off the hook; tomorrow, Dean would do his own ‘repentance’ and while they wouldn’t be free; they would be one step closer to freedom.
someone strapped to it: slower to coalesce than the rack itself, yet still undeniably there. Dean knows it’s him, even though any identifying features are smeared with blood and shit and soot. Only the eyes are clearly visible: white, wide and rolling frantically in pain or in fear; there’s no way to tell. He appears to be struggling against something – mouth opening and closing, yet with no sound coming out.
“What?” Dean looks confused, his eyes widening. He hears Cas call out in shock and alarm. Out of the corner of his eye, Sam can see that the smug smile’s been wiped off Alistair’s face – and that alone tells Sam this is what he needs to do.
“Cas,” he chokes out. “I’m sorry…” For all that his eyes never leave the angel, he seems to miss the cruel smile that flashes briefly across Cas’ face. Or maybe Sam’s only seeing it because he knows it all so well.
“It was sudden. An aneurism or somethin. Happened right in front of her eldest, Dean, he’s not dealt with it so good either.”
“Ok,” was all Castiel could think to say. He cast around desperately for a conversation, his mind drawing blanks. He wasn’t like his Father: he could never think what to say. “You, um, go to school?” he asked eventually, cringing inwardly at the stupidity of the question.
In the harsh white light of the headlights, Dean’s face is blotchy mess. There are still tears leaking out his red rimmed eyes – which seem unfocused, darting over Cas’ face as if searching for something. He seems to find whatever it is he’s looking for, as his whole body relaxes into Cas’ touch – eyes closing in relief, hands coming up to grip Cas’ wrists.
The none too gentle lurch of an inexperienced foot on the brake nearly has him sliding off the seat. Blearily, he sits up – the familiar interior of the bunker’s garage dimly visible through the windows. Cas is extricating himself clumsily from the driver’s seat. Dean is passed out on the passenger side – snoring softly.
Castiel sighed in relief once he was alone. It was Friday; he wouldn’t have to see Dean again until Monday. By then he could steel himself against temptation. By then he could stay away.
“Yeah, you were a mess,” Dean grins. “And you abandoned me. And before that you’d been crazy, and before that you’d been dead, and before that you’d been evil. In a weird way, Purgatory was the first time I could process it all. I cut my way through half the damn monsters in the place to reach you: you were all I could think about. And when I did fucking finally find you, it was like a piece of my soul slipped back into place. I was angry, I wanted to hate you, but instead everything just felt right again. That’s when I knew,” he swears under his breath, gaze sliding back to the road. “Shit, that was sappy.”
“Not a complete idiot,” Sam clarifies hastily. “He knows how this is gonna have to go down: or at least part of him does. We just need to find that part.”
Sam, who had withdrawn slightly in teenaged embarrassment at the mention of his looks, mumbled something, before turning to shake Castiel’s hand as well. He was already the same height, and Castiel didn’t doubt he would soon tower over him.
Dean nodded. It was a smart plan, nobody would think to look for them there. He caught sight of a familiar face in the doorway, looking flustered. “Looks like your babysitter’s caught up,” he told Cas.
“...you are son, I’ve been lookin’ for ya.” He noticed Dean as he stopped in front them. “I was glad to see you here today Dean, did you enjoy the sermon?”
“I’ll be honest kid,” Dean says, “I dunno what ‘trans thing’ means but your brother sounds like a real piece of shit to me.” He digs in his pocket and pulls out a couple of twenties. “Here,” he stuffs them into the kid’s hands, “seein’ as my brother saved me the trouble of buyin’ a ticket. And you tell
“That’s terrible. How did she die?” Castiel felt the muted sympathy one always felt at a stranger’s death, mixed with guilt that he couldn’t feel more.
His brother let out a breath, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t know Sammy,” he confessed, “God knows I miss Cas but,” he sighed again, “who knows where he is, or
“All I really remember is Dad screaming at me to slow down while you laughed yourself sick in the backseat,” Sam confesses – ears hot. “But I don’t think it’s a fair comparison anyway. How many old ladies do you see wandering down the freeway?”
“Where have you been?” Cas asks the new (old) Dean cautiously, but he ignores him completely, staring intently at Sam.
“We have to trust ourselves. What we think, what we feel.” Dean said earnestly. He leaned closer to Cas until their foreheads were touching. “That’s the only thing we know for sure is true. I don’t care what God or Jim or Dad or anyone else thinks. All I know is that I liked our kiss, and I like you. All I need to know is if you feel the same way. Do you?”
“Dean Winchester? Studying? Never thought I’d live to see the day” Missouri laughed at the annoyance that flashed in Dean’s eyes. “Don’t get angry at me son you’re smart but lazy and you know it. C’mon, there should a table at the back that ain’t too wobbly.”
Now, to god fearin’ folks like you and me the message is clear. The Lord knows what’s right, it is the lord who decides, and it's in his judgment that we must trust. But folks, to many people that just ain’t the case anymore. The spirit of Sodom is alive to this day. You know who I’m talking about...they like to call themselves “homosexuals”. Sounds nice and scientific right?” he slammed his hand down onto the podium suddenly and the congregation jumped.
Sam, coming to a similar realisation next to him, jerks instinctually.  But the water doesn’t splash and neither of them are even damp: the water simply moves through them like they’re standing in a hologram. Cas accepts this without much thought (after everything else that’s happened and is happening and probably will happen, non-wet swimming pools are the least of it). Instead, of course, he casts about for Dean.
“Well I have a good student, that always helps,” Cas replied modestly, though he smiled at the compliment.
“That’s not entirely true,” Dean had now become very interested in his own hands. “How’d you get out anyhow?” he asked before Cas could reply.
“I never exactly hid it either,” Dean points out. “Just ‘cos I don’t hang pride flags from the impala and just cos’ I used to use the word ‘gay’ as an insult  doesn’t mean I was repressed,” he smiles. “But don’t be too hard on yourself Sammy – it didn’t happen as often as you’re probably thinkin’ it did.”
“He looks constipated,” he muttered to Dean, who’s snicker was loud enough to float across the room to where Uriel stood. This spurred him into action, and he crossed the room to stand in between Castiel and Dean.
Dean waited until mid afternoon before he set off for home again. The streets were mostly empty, the few people about turned their heads as he passed. His street was deserted, his driveway empty. The spare key was under the mat. He let himself in slowly.
“It’s all my fault,” his father ignored him. “I haven’t been there for you, I was too prideful. I didn’t notice that you’d been pulled off the righteous path.” He was muttering to himself, or to God perhaps. “What do I do lord?”
“We might need to stop dad,” he said, trying desperately to sound helpful. “For food n’ stuff.” It was an innocuous sentence, but John seemed to be going through every word, searching for an insult.
“You know, I don’t think I will,” Alistair drifts back to Dean and rests a bloody hand on his heaving shoulder. “Not when I think we’re finally making progress.” As he speaks, the tone of Dean’s cries begins to shift. Slowly, then all at once, the pain gives way to laughter – hard and hysterical. It bounces and echoes off the air around them, multiplying and surrounding them like a hyena pack, circling from the shadows.
“And I guess I’m scared,” Dean admits reluctantly, then ploughs on quickly before Sam can speak. “Look Sam, please don’t make me talk about this where I can’t lie.”
Dean thinks, but he doesn’t say it. Instead, he says what Cas wants to hear right now: the truth. “It wasn’t the words so much,” he admits. “It’s not like I haven’t heard that and worse before outta the mouths of people I actually give a damn about. It was the way he looked at me: like I wasn’t even human. Like I was so far away from him that we weren’t even the same species anymore. He didn’t hate me for tryin’ to kill him: he hated me just for existing, and there ain’t a damn thing I could’ve done to change his mind. And I know he doesn’t matter,” he adds when Cas opens his mouth, “and I know he’s wrong. But…” he trails off, not even sure what he was going to say.
For the first ten minutes neither of them talks, but the quiet is a comfortable one. Sam is ordering his thoughts – or trying to at least. He has a million questions he wants to ask, a million more he wants to answer, and all of them are clamouring at the edge of his mind, each asserting their urgency and significance.  He has a feeling Dean is waiting for him to start, but he has no clue where to even think about beginning. Rather than look at his brother, he glances out the window – and is struck with an idea at the sight of a particular turn off.
That was just his luck, Castiel reflected grimly as he retreated to their normal table at the back. He grabbed a random book off the shelf, and tried to read it. The words floated before him, more squiggles than language as he willed Dean to arrive soon. Somehow he doubted this old lady would be as accommodating as Missouri.
memories. It’s a fear so new and sharp that the need to mitigate it overwhelms everything else. He needs it to be ok: he needs Dean to be ok, more than he needs anything else right now. Without thinking, he lets go of Dean’s arm, bringing his hands up to cup his older brother’s face, forcing Dean to meet his eyes again. “Alright,” he says. “Alright. Do it.”
Alistair narrows his eyes slightly. “Touching,” he murmurs. “But you’re a tad early, Angel. Not in the script quite yet.” He flicks his wrist and Cas lurches into the air, careening through the flames and into a knot of chains, which instantly coil around him like metal snakes – binding his hands behind his back as his angel blade clatters to the ground.
“Sorry Jimmy didn’t mean to get all formal on you, I just,” he took a deep breath. “I just haven’t had the chance to properly thank you for everything you...with Mary... and I want to do it properly.” Jim waited patiently for him to finish, before taking his hand again.
“This is real?” he was afraid to do anything, to run, to move, to pinch his own arm in case it all dissolved into nothing as it had so many times before.
“I’m so sick of that word,” Alistair sighs dramatically. “Sing me a song I haven’t heard before.” Without warning, he steps forwards, plunging his hand into Dean’s chest and pulling.
“So repent.” Dean said simply. “You don’t have to mean it. We pretended all our lives. We can pretend a little longer.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas’ voice was soft, but Dean stirred immediately. One green eye opened slowly, Cas had a second to register the surprise in it before he was being pulled into a desperate kiss.
,” John hisses. “Which are you: stupid or incompetent? And look me in the eye like the man you aren’t when you answer – that’s an order.”
Just a heads up, this chapter is pretty gory (or at least, it's the goriest thing i think i've ever written).
Cas walked slowly, and arrived at the library just as it opened. He could feel the weight of the past few days lift of his shoulders as the small building came closer and closer. Aside from seeing Dean, assuming Dean could get away, he would be glad to see Missouri. It would be nice to see a friendly face again.
Thinking about that kind of stuff depressed him, so he focussed only on what he could remember. At first, he’d been able to recall every moment with precision. As more time passed, however, his memories began to blend...
“Stay back,” says the small child at their feet, his face pale yet determined. He clutches the shotgun in tiny hands and, though it must be heavy, his arms don’t shake as he aims it towards them. Nervous eyes dart between them and the cot. Behind him, the door (
“Seriously, what the fuck am I doing here?” He wished Cas was here with him, despite how ridiculously, monumentally stupid that would’ve been.
“Those things are bad for you,” Dean shakes his head, but his tone is light. “He’s a doctor. He should know better.”
“Ah, c’mon Sammy,” Demon Dean’s tone is soft and gentle, though he continues to twirl the axe absentmindedly in his hand. “You know I’ve always been happier wrapped up in the past – if this little road trip doesn’t prove that then I don’t know what will. Just leave me to it.”
“Ah you’ll learn.” Jim dismissed him with a wave of the hand. “’sides it’s a nice touch, I fix their souls: you fix their engines.”
Now Dean was drawing him closer again, and Cas knew what was coming, wanted it too with every fibre of his being. He wanted to give in, to ignore his guilt and his sins and pretend that they were still teenagers stealing kisses in the shadows.
shouldn’t be happening. Dean is in the passenger seat, and Sam can’t see his face because it’s buried in his hands but his shoulders are shaking. The hand Cas should be using to drive is on Dean’s knee – it’s all too surreal to be fake.  Sam doesn’t want to see this; he doesn’t want Dean to think he might see this so he turns around and watches the soft leather of the back seat until his eyes drift shut again.
“Yes,” Dean says and everything in the world (the chains, the flames, Dean’s heartbeat) apart from Sam’s breathing and the still echoing laughter stops in its tracks.
Dean wanted to punch the pastor’s smug smile from his face, he wanted to channel the shame and anger Novak’s sermon had awakened in him back into towards the Preacher. He forced the feelings down and managed a smile. “It was, um, interesting, yeah.”
“Save me Lord!” Dean echoed, though his laughter somewhat ruined the dramatics. Cas’ face cracked and he grinned down at Dean, laughter flashing in his eyes.
“Two memories are hardly a pattern,” Cas snaps. In two steps he closes the distance between him and Sam, grasping his arm and trying to drag him away. Reduced to and inexperienced with human strength, however, he makes little headway, and Sam shakes him off easily.
“Yeah,” it’s Dean’s turn to sneer – face twisted and bloody but still proud. “We beat you last time, we’ll do it again.”
“Where’d they come from?” Dean asked, thinking back to the rusty, temperamental signal of his childhood. “They look like fucking death stars.”
“Hey, hey,” Dean gently lifted Cas’ head so their eyes met. “Nobody coulda seen what your Dad was gonna do, even Pastor Walker was surprised. Besides,” he smiled wanly. “It’s not the
He stayed in bed as the sun rose, its light creeping towards him through a gap in his curtains. He ignored the sounds of his father waking up until he heard a knock on his door.
“Shut it!” John’s raised voice caught the Pastor’s attention and he made his way over to them, gliding effortlessly through the disappointed crowd. He reached out and clasped John’s outstretched hand, before pulling him into a hug.
After a few seconds they break apart, awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. Sam takes stock of their surroundings. They are, once again, in a long, narrow corridor – empty this time but for them and, inevitably, a door. It’s unmarked, and slightly ajar. Dean approaches it, resting his hand on the wood, then stops.
“Naw, you ain’t gonna find many friends here,” she’d said eventually. “But you’re not alone. There are others. They just ain’t here. Don’t forget it now.”
That seems to make up Dean’s mind. “Shit,” he mutters, dropping to a crouch and propping Cas up by the shoulders. “Cas is that really you? Where’s Lucifer?”
Cas hesitates, then comes and stands next to Sam – not quite relaxing, but not his normal poker straight either. He nudges something with his foot, then stoops to pick it up. It’s an old mobile phone – one that flips.
“Don’t think you have to stand up for him just because he’s your friend.” His voice was soft, friendly, sweet. It made Castiel want to throw up. “If he attacked you, if he forced himself on you. Just say. It won’t be your fault.”
Cas couldn’t tell if Dean was laughing or crying but, he supposed, it didn’t much make much difference: the sound was the most joyful thing he’d ever heard.
It was long past dark by the time he left, a cloudless night. The moon shone brightly, illuminating Dean’s bruised face as they kissed.
“I uh,” Dean seemed unsure of what to do with himself. His hands were still full of pancakes and he cast about for an empty surface.
Sam and Cas share another quick look. “Fine,” Cas says, exasperated, Sam nodding along with him. “We won’t force you to talk about it here.”
They had reached the front of the church. Although the congregation had long dispersed, they could see people in the streets. Reluctantly, Dean dropped Cas’ hand.
John seemed a little shocked at the offer, but he nodded gratefully. “That would be nice Jimmy, thanks.”
“Not really,” he admitted. “I barely ever saw my Father until a few months ago, and my Mom’s not really the church type.”
They stay that way for a long time – and Cas can feel when Dean begins to relax. He feels hands leave his wrist and rematerialize in his hair, pulling him closer as Dean deepens the kiss. Cas lets him take the lead while also trying to put everything he couldn’t say with words into the press of their mouths. He can feel the wetness of Dean’s cheeks – pressed up against his own – the pleasant burn of stubble on stubble. He can feel every atom that Dean is made of – a trillion tiny stars all pressing towards him – calling to particles of his vessel and his grace, crashing into one another in triumphant waves. This, he thinks, is better than anything God has ever given him.
“I dunno,” he confessed. “I still wanna talk to Sammy. He’ll  have no idea what’s going on. I need to tell him. If he hears it from me...”
“He can speak for himself,” she’d snapped at Dean. “Or are you so bent on corrupting him that he’s not allowed to talk to anyone else?” They’d glared at each other, Dean trying to think of a witty response.
“Really? You can honestly say there’s no reason you’ve never even called Cas your boyfriend?” Sam retorts, “Or that one of you literally has to be dying for you to kiss him in front of me? I’ve barely ever seen you two hold hands and you’re telling me that that’s ok? That you’re ok?”
“Dean. Stop.”  Cas’ tone is strange and there’s a flicker in his eyes, a softening of his mouth so that for a second he almost seems to be pleading.
“Shut up!” Dean cries angrily, stamping his foot. “I’m not a construction or a core or whatever you said. I’m real! You’re the ones that’re fake.”
John just nodded, satisfied by Dean’s normalcy for now. Dean stared out the window, trying to think of how to approach this. It would have been so much easier if he liked Anna; or anyone really. He’d seen the movies, even read the books. He was supposed to want steal the moon for them, or hide it lest it make them feel ugly. He’d seen the way Dad stared at Mom, the same in every photo whether they were twelve or thirty. He’d never met any girl that made him feel like that.
sorry for the slightly slow update, will probs be like that for the next wee while as I am going camping.
Sam too deeply wants there to be another way out of this situation – but any further considerations would require him to turn around and take stock of the room more fully, something he is absolutely not prepared to do. Sighing, he turns so he can rest a shoulder on the wall where the window should be. Waiting it is.
Dean falters, his arm dropping fractionally, his face breaking, just for a second, into pure pain. He doesn’t say anything – there’s nothing he could say.
“What about you Dean?” He watched his older son in the mirror hopefully. But Dean only shrugged. John frowned in worry. It was normal; he always tried to tell himself. Dean was just a late starter. Hell, he should be glad. So many boys Dean’s age were out, making messes out of lives. It was normal, he told himself, that Dean was seventeen and had never shown an interest in any girl. It wasn’t normal, the stubborn part of his brain insisted. He’d seen the way girls looked at Dean – you could practically hear the sighs that followed him sometimes – but Dean never looked back.
Dean snorted slightly. “Yeah, you wouldn’t ‘ve. She never goes to church : she’s like the only person in town who doesn’t.”
They’d been laughing about, something, when Hael had come over. she’d done that sometimes, seemingly incapable of living her own life.
is stretched out on the rack – jagged metal shards piercing cloth, skin, muscles and bones alike, pinning him place. The flesh around the wounds is torn and ragged from where, forgetting himself in his pain, he’s pulled against the bindings. His clothing is indistinguishable from his skin: both are so caked with layers of blood that it’s all just red. There’s much, much more blood than a human can safely lose in life (though this isn’t life of course). Some of it is dull and rusty, long dry, while some is sparkling scarlet – newly spilt.
Cas pulled her into a sincere, if slightly awkward, hug. “Thank you for everything Missouri, I don’t think we can ever repay you.” He said into her shoulder.
Sam and Dean exchange a look that seems much more meaningful than a simple acknowledgement, yet Cas isn’t sure why. Sam looks back at him and smiles at something as Dean pulls into the side of the road.
that killed your mother is still out there – you want Sammy to end up like her? Burning to ash on the ceiling because you couldn’t be bothered to follow the one goddamn order I gave you? Because you couldn’t do the one goddamn thing I trained you for?”
“Now, you’re probably wonderin’, how come it took me so long to find this beast? An’ folks I have to admit I failed you.” Jim’s face was twisted with remorse. There were tears in his eyes but his voice remained steady, slowly rising in pitch as he continued. “I let this monster live among you. He eats with you, he talks with you. He sits in this church and pretends to be you. And it wasn’t until he tried to lure my own son away from God, away from
“I wasn’t exactly planning on shouting it down Main Street but, c’mon, not everyone in this town is out for blood.”
“So you’re saying we can’t kill him?” Sam mutters, barely dodging another swing. “What the hell can we do then?”
The moment ends when John releases Dean’s arm – letting him drop onto the hard concrete. Dean gasps in pain as he makes contact, the back of his head bouncing off the recently re-existent plastic lounger. John follows him, looming even larger over Dean’s prone figure, feet on either side of his hips. Sam, futilely, tries to get between them – but John simply walks through him, stopping at Dean’s shoulders – one boot resting on Dean’s chest. From his pinned position on the ground, Dean continues to glare at John. “Oh yeah this isn’t suspicious
Dean shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to hurt her feelings but Missouri had an uncomfortable knack for picking up on things you didn’t want her to know.
“Where am I supposed to go, Dad? What am I supposed to do?”  He watched for something: sadness, anger, grief, anything. But if John felt for his eldest anymore he didn’t let it show on his face.
“Mom loves us. Both of us. And Dean’s not a degenerate. He’s a good man: the best. You have no idea what he’s been through, what he’s suffered. How strong his love is because of it,” Sam thought of Cas, of Charlie, and it was all he could do to hold his tongue. “And all because of you.”
The car journey home was silent. Normally, Sam’s chatter about the ceremony filled the awkward spaces but today he seemed to sense that John’s mood was too delicate to risk. Dean too was quiet, staring moodily out the window as identical houses moved past in an impassive blur. Something had to break, and it was Dean that did.
They came together for a last, desperate kiss. One part of Cas wanted to be gentle, to savour every second and store every detail. The rest of him just wanted to let go, to pull Dean as tight as he could so that they could never be separated again.
“It’s me,” Sam takes a step forward, Dean takes a step back, nearly tripping in his haste, the shotgun dipping towards the ground. “It’s Sam. And Cas.”
Cas was sure he’d met most of the town by now, or had them pointed out to him in church, but her name was unfamiliar to him. “Moseley? I don’t think I’ve met her.”
“Don’t be,” Dean says, just like his younger self had said all those years/hours ago sitting on the hood of this same car, smoking a different pack of cigarettes. This time, though, Dean sounds like he means it. “This makes it easier, in a way. But tell me: what
“You don’t have to hurt anymore,” he tells Dean, taking a deep, shaky breath. “You don’t need to try. I’m here for you, whatever happens. Do what you have to.” Keeping one hand on Dean’s face, he moves the other back to the knife, pulling it gently towards his chest.
“Then folks, let us pray...” He lowered his voice and the rolling crowd calmed under his artful control. “Guide me, O thou great redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land; I am weak, but thou art mighty...”
Eventually, he drifted into an uneasy sleep. His dreams were fleeting, abstract. He dreamed of bright light, of pain. Green eyes stared into his. There were tears in them. Were they tears of happiness or joy? He wanted to ask, but he couldn’t make himself speak. When he tried it was his father’s voice that emerged.
“We need to leave Dean.” Now it was Dean’s turn to look away. “Dean, you can’t seriously want to stay?”
Sam is surprised to find himself almost shy – now that the moment is finally here he finds almost doesn’t want to go through with it. “Can we talk?”
“That’s true,” Dean allows. “I guess I’ll tell him that we’re a ‘thing’ now – whatever that means – just so he’s not surprised. He’ll probably understand better than we do what the hell is going on – he’s way better at this kind of stuff.”
“I just wanted to give your nerd ass some tips,” Dean says flippantly, “so you could finally get laid.”
He was so wrapped up in gloomy possibility that he barely noticed where he was until he walked into the library door. It was locked. He frowned: Missouri never closed early. He knocked softly, and heard quick footsteps. A second later the door was wrenched open and he was pulled into a tight hug.
“Yeah, $40,” the kid can’t be older than 16, with bright blue hair and pale blue, pink and white stripes on his face (a matching flag round his neck) says, frowning.  “Didn’t you?”
Sam shrugged. “Not much, just that you’d finally settled and that, seeing as I was in Stanford and you were in San Francisco, I should visit you when I had free time.”
“I don’t know. I’m just glad. Were you glad when you found out Hael wasn’t my girlfriend?” he wasn’t sure what made him ask the question, but now he wanted to know the answer more than anything else. Dean stared at him for what felt like a long time.
“A vulnerability,” Cas explains. “It will have latched on to a particularly strong emotion. We just need to find the source of that emotion.”
He listened with half an ear to the sermon, his thoughts pointed away from the church, .It was nearly 10.30, they hadn’t eaten breakfast before they left and he was hungry. Mom had always gotten up early to make them breakfast on Sundays...He forced his mind away from that line of thought and focussed on the Pastor’s words instead.
The room is dark, almost pitch black, but he’s been in enough motel rooms to feel his way to the bed, kicking off his shoes and stripping off his shirt and pants as he goes. His eyes are drooping closed by the time he hits the pillow, and he’s asleep in seconds.
“I don’t know how much it costs to live in a city, but I’ll bet it’s a lot. And the kinda jobs we’d get wouldn’t pay enough.”
“We’re enough,” Dean echoed, taking strength from the words. He thought for a moment. “We’re gonna need a plan. Somewhere to go, money, clothes. Everything.”
It takes a couple of tries (his hands are shaking) but he eventually coaxes a small, flickering flame to life. Cas’ tight face is illuminated faintly: mouth a thin line, wrinkles deep around the eyes. The shadows make him look old. Old and tired and worn thin. Sam feels the same way.
“Just because it’s not a lie doesn’t mean it’s true,” the younger Dean snaps from behind them – they all turn to stare,  nonplussed, and he stammers to explain. “Uh…Just because I thought it once doesn’t mean I think it now, y’know?”
Cas,” Sam’s hands bunch into fists at his sides, his own eyes glittering dangerously. “And the way he looked at me – like I’d shot him or something. Destroyed his whole fucking world. You honestly think he still doesn’t feel any of that?
“Funny – that’s what you said last time too,” Alistair murmurs. He waves a hand, and the metal piercing Dean’s skin vanishes into smoke. The wounds, the blood, the hole in his chest, remain.
Dean opened his mouth to reply, then closed it. She was right, he knew that. “I need to see Cas first, and Sam. I need to explain what’s going on. He needs to hear it from me.”
“Sammy...” He hadn’t known what to say. He’d always needed Sam, way more than Sam had ever needed him, but it’d never occurred to him that Sam knew too.  That he was holding himself back, for Dean.  And how had Dean repaid him?
The place seemed utterly deserted, Dean noted with relief. He knew Ms. Moseley would be around somewhere, but if they headed to the back she might not spot them...
“Enough,” he says firmly, holding Dean’s gaze. “I understand why you are so reluctant, Dean. Really,” he adds at Dean’s derisive snort, “I do. But there’s no point in trying to annoy us into leaving without you: it won’t work.”
“Dad,” he reached through the space between them. John’s hands clasped around his wrists before he got there. They were strong hands, rough and calloused from years of work. Dean could feel his thick fingers digging into the skin of his arms. He let out an involuntary gasp at the pain.
They stayed together for a long time, Cas’ fingers pressed bruisingly tight into Dean’s shoulder blades, Dean’s stubble leaving pale pink pockmarks on his neck. The past and the present merged confusingly, so that the slight, deceptively delicate teenager in Dean’s mind’s eye was at odds with the solid ‘here-ness’ of the body in his arms.
“You seem to be getting the tears under control,” Cas points out. “That should make things with Sam easier.”
“I love you too.” And then Dean is crying again. He rests his head on Cas’ shoulder and sobs openly – his cries echoing slightly in the night. It’s a jarring, disconcerting sound – Dean cries like he doesn’t really know how to. The sobs cut themselves off, or fade away into nothing, leaving brief pauses between the waves. Some of them sound almost like giggles, others like coughs, others like words.
“I, uh, I can’t promise that’ll happen Cas,” Dean shifts in his seat, Sam’s eyes burning a patch onto his back. “but I’ll try.”
“C’mon.” Cas was pulling him through rooms before he had a chance to look around.  When they entered Cas’ room however, Dean pulled away. Cas made a small noise of protest.
“Yes,” Cas’ tone is serious but his eyes are twinkling, “I’ve heard it draws on ancient and powerful magic that allows you to know others’ innermost thoughts and desires.”
“Cas,” Dean pleads desperately, giving up on escaping and collapsing back to the ground. He keeps his eyes trained on Cas/Lucifers face, searching and searching for something that simply isn’t there. “Cas please I know you can hear me – come back to me.”
Dean blows more smoke into the air. “There’s barely a day where I don’t think about it,” he says – turning to look at Sam. “It’s always there – waiting. There’s more of it than there is up here y’know? Forty years. Sometimes I don’t think I ever escaped – that I’ll open my eyes and be on that fucking rack again. Or worse: off it. But still there.”
So that was it, Castiel realised. He dimly remembered Jim mentioning some friction between Dean and Pastor Walker, this must be where Uriel’s dislike stemmed from. He was certainly the type to hold a grudge.
“So he’s gone and Sam’s gone, just like mom,” there are tears trickling down the side of this face, Dean can remember them itching. “And now you want to leave too. You want to leave me here, alone.” The gun falls to the ground as Dean begins to cry in earnest once again, small hands covering his face.  “Please,” he whispers through them, “please don’t leave.”
“It’s not like he had much choice is it?” Cas retorted. It was stupid, dangerous. But he did it anyway.
Dean smiles sadly and brings his hand up to Cas’ face, as if to touch it. His fingers are fading away to nothing at the edges – like a ghost, or a half forgotten memory. “You got some more pressing issues,” he says, “I’m losing.”
“You miss them.” It’s not a question.  Cas puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder – it’s a strange sensation, like he’s touching snow rather than flesh. Dean is just a little too cold, with just a little too much give, to be real. After a second, Cas’ hand begins to sink into the fabric of Dean’s jacket, and he pulls it back hurriedly.
“Enough of this,” the spell says impatiently. “We tried the charm offensive and it didn’t work. You’ve played with your food enough. Just do what I brought you here for and end this.”
a son to you: just an annoyance until you realised you could use me. Then I was your prop. The son of a Preacher man: quiet, respectful, obedient. You didn’t want a son you just wanted someone to stand behind your chair during photo shoots. You pretend to love and care. You pretend to know God when all you care about is yourself and your fame. You call
“How do we know we can trust you?” Sam asks. “How do we know that you’re part of Dean and not part of the spell?”
“Gee I don’t know: I’m only part of your brain,” Bobby sarcastically calls from behind him. “The only part that actually seems to be working right now.”
“Dean, don’t listen to them. They’re wrong remember? What do they know? Nothing nothing nothing. We have each other. That’s enough.”
“Would you, um, would you like to go with me then?” He forced himself to ask and her face immediately brightened. “Just as friends” he added quickly but she seemed not hear him.
“No,” Dean’s voice is hoarse; as if he’s been screaming for hours – or days. Which he has. Hasn’t he?. He shakes his head, trying to remember. “This isn’t happening... it’s not real” he struggles against the bonds weakly, but Alistair's hands – almost tender – run through his hair, over his face, forcing him to still.
He still hadn’t grasped his new reality. He still believed everything could somehow go back to normal. Missouri couldn’t help but admire his optimism; she just hoped it wouldn’t cost him too much.
“What difference will it make?” Cas asked bluntly. “Even if you do tell him, you won’t be able to stay.”
“That wasn’t my choice Sam,” Dean snapped, eyes fixed somewhere over Sam’s shoulder. “Why do I have to come crawling back huh?
Doubts still crowded the edge of his mind, but he tried to push them aside. He had to trust himself, who else was there?
“I think he did but…I don’t know if loving someone is enough to stop you from hurting them. It hasn’t been for me,” Dean sniffs.
“I don’t have much time,” Cas says to Dean. “He’s going to come back soon and I have something I want – no,
Bobby rolls his eyes but, mercifully, doesn’t comment. “Fine,” he says instead, in the tone of someone trying to explain why two plus two equals four, “let’s say we do it your way. You got 40 years of blood and torture down here, how are you gonna find what you think you’re lookin’ for before Sam and Cas catch up with ya?”
It was clearly an important yet eclectic mix. Footballers and Cheerleaders yes, but also band kids and student council. Castiel entertained the brief hope that this school was not as mired in cliques as his last had been. He doubted it, more probably there was some other thing that linked this group together. All of them, he realised, had been at his Father’s sermon on Sunday.
“Do I look like a twelve year old girl to you? Is this a sleepover? We gonna eat pizza and give each other makeovers while I tell you all about my new boyfriend?” He stutters slightly on the last word – Sam decides to ignore it.
“Yeah, well,” Dean begins to gather his clothes, pulling a pair of boxers on. “I worry about me too sometimes.”
“Thank you Sam,” Jim answered graciously, reaching out to shake Sam’s eager hand. “Look at you. You must’ve grown at least a foot since I last saw you. And you’re lookin more and more like your grandfather everyday!”
At the edges, on the other side of the barriers, people have gathered to watch. Most are smiling and cheering, several have their phones out.  A few, however, are scowling. One middle-aged woman sees Dean looking at her and her eyes flash with hate. She shouts something at him, though her voice is lost in the cheers and whoops of the crowd. But Dean can guess well enough, and his hand tenses round Castiel’s.
“Cas you gotta push him out,” Dean is saying urgently, shaking Cas’ shoulders and distracting Sam before he can respond. “Please.”
“Cas?” Sam reaches out to grab his shoulder, simultaneously turning his head to see whatever it is that Cas is seeing.
The kid’s eleven; he can take care of himself for a while: god knows the dork needs friends his own age, and god knows I deserve some time to myself.”
“He’s hurting, Dad. Really bad. I just want to help him find peace” he tried to inject the words with the moral  superiority that had made him want to punch Uriel. He worried he may have gone overboard with it, but his father was convinced.
John’s eyes flicked briefly back to his other son and lingered long enough to register the pain and disappointment Sam was feeling, before skittering away again. “I may not be good,” he murmured, almost too quiet to hear, “but I am righteous; n’that’s more than you can say.” In three quick, confident, strides he had crossed the kitchen to stand by the battered old house phone. “I’m gonna tell you again what I told you all them years ago:
“Sammy!” he called out as his younger brother drew closer. He was clutching Dean’s letter in his hand. “Sam, thank god I got to see you.”
“I…” Cas is a little taken aback. “I want to…” he trails off, unsure of what to say. Where to start.
Hael was annoyed at Castiel. Unfortunately for him, she had elected to make up for lost time. She kept a claw like grip on arm, at odds with the pretty smile on her face. Castiel forced himself to submit to it all. He owed Hael this at least. He tried to be interested in the conversations around him, but they were all about his father.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, it’s been hell. Dad’s not letting me anywhere near Sammy, he’s afraid I’ll ‘corrupt’ his  remaining son or something. It’s been kinda lonely, nothing I can’t handle though.” His tone was deliberately light, but Cas’ heart twisted at his words. He noticed the dark circles under Dean’s eyes, his hunched posture.
It was easy: lying. Once you found the groove, once you figured out what they really wanted to hear, you could say anything.
Dean frowns in confusion towards Sam. “I don’t get why you’re surprised,” he says. “I know I tried to hide some of it from you, but you were always so smart, and you always hated the way we grew up. I figured you always knew this shit.”
Falling in complete blackness is something Sam hopes to never experience again. He can’t even tell if he’s moving, not really, or if his stomach is just twisting to give the illusion of falling, and it’s only his own panicked breaths that give any indication of how much time is passing. The hard ground slamming into his feet, throwing him off balance, is almost a relief. At least it’s an indication of something.
“Castiel, there is a spare desk next to me, Hael, Inias and Raphael. We think you should sit with us.” He smiled smugly at Dean, “you don’t want to be seen mixing with the wrong people.”
“And, as you can see, it’s working out great for me.” Dean says with sarcasm exaggerated enough for even Cas to understand – a too wide smile plastered on. His face quickly drops. “To be honest, I didn’t think it would ever come up anyway. There hasn’t really been anyone else for the past few years – man or woman. It’s only been you.” He’s not looking at Cas when he says it, staring determinedly out the windscreen instead.
“That’s what you think, Deano,” Alistair grins. “It’s going to be an honour to break you. It always is.”
them, wandering through hidden tunnels and mines, following underground rivers and mineral veins. Finding lions’ dens and hidden pools with diamonds at the bottom. They became everything I could see, feel, hear and smell. And now that I’m out, I can’t look at the mountains without seeing the caves I know are inside them now. The whole landscape has cracked open for me and I don’t know where to start.”
“No, no,” Cas rushed to assure him, “but he wants to talk all the time, wear me down with guilt until I crack and repent. He keeps trying to make me blame
“There’s always a choice, Castiel. You can always choose God: choose family, no matter the consequences.” It was John, not Jim who answered. He eyed Cas suspiciously. “I’m surprised to see you standing up for him Castiel; you know what he’s capable of more than anyone.” He sounded like he was talking about a monster, not his own son.
Uriel seemed to take his silence for acceptance, if not agreement, for he soon lapsed back into his endless monologue about the school. Castiel nodded as he droned, keeping an eye out for flashes of green.
“Hey Dad, I uh, I’ve brought someone to see you,” Sam shifted to the side awkwardly, and Dean came face to face with his father for the first time in twelve years.
He caught one last glimpse of Sam, still standing on the stairs with a bewildered expression on his face, before Uriel blocked his vision. They didn’t stop until they’d dragged him round a corner onto the next street. There were a few people still out, dog walkers mostly, but they all ignored the four teenagers.
you were given those powers in the first place, trust me,” Dean herds them towards the living room, pushing beer into their hands.
Sam’s face is twisted – with rage or with pain or with both Cas can’t tell. His hands are bunched into fists so tight the knuckles have turned white, but he doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t seem able to.
I’ve only been at this school for four hours he wanted to say. “No I didn’t know about it,” he said instead.
“What do we do?” Cas had asked. His voice had been so small and scared. It had terrified Dean. He’d needed Cas to be strong.
Dean’s gaze slides to the floor, and his jaw tenses as if he wants to speak, but he doesn’t say anything.
“You’re just lucky I don’t remember you in that chair,” Dean throws back, laughing at the cursing he gets instead of a reply– he’s missed this more than he normally lets himself admit. “Don’t worry, it’s not much further,” even as he says it he comes to the place. He stops just inside the tree line and finally lets Bobby catch up. “Here.”
“A long time,” Dean shrugs, fishing a lighter out of his pocket and sticking the cigarette in his mouth. “I haven’t smoked ‘em in a while though.” He brings the flame up to his face, cupping his hand against the gentle wind. Together, they watch the waves.
“Now, recently, these deviants have tried to justify themselves. They claim that their depraved lifestyle ain’t a choice. That they’re born that way. That they got no more control over it than they do over the colour of their skin.
hands, the memory of his hands) are buried deeply in a quivering mass of flesh – too far gone in the throes of ecstatic pain to be called a person anymore. He twitches them and the mass screams, begging in a slurred language he doesn’t understand – though the intent would be clear enough to anyone’s ears. His memory starts to laugh as he looks up to meet Dean’s eyes.
“Look at me,” Demon Dean says contemptuously. “Look how broken and worthless you are. All because of that angel and that brother. Alistair was right and we both know it. We’ve always known it. All they’ve ever done is take, take, take: and you’re so broken that’s all you know to want. Dad, Sam, Alistair, Cas, what are they? Just someone stronger and smarter you attach yourself to until you’re all used up and bleeding and of no use to anyone anymore.”
Dean nods. “It’s not much further,” he says, turning away and starting down the corridor once more. “Follow me.”
“I remember this phone,” he says. “Dean used to call me on it.” As if on cue, the phone begins to beep in his hand. Surprised, Cas drops it to the floor – where it rolls instantly back into place. On the bed, Dean stiffens.
“Is it?” Dean demands. “Is it really? Yeah I know they probably won’t abandon me or anything but that doesn’t mean this won’t change everything does it?”
Dean’s fear filled eyes were the only thing Cas could think about. He stood, frozen, as the crowd moved around him. Their angry cries sounded as if they were far away, a different world almost.
He smiled at Castiel. “I knew it was worth bringing you here.” He said happily, glad his investment was paying off. “Now, you’re not the only one who had an excitin’ day let me tell you. I got an interesting call from the radio station today...”
Conversation between them flowed after that and they talked even as the diner emptied around them. It was dark by the time they finally fell quiet again, alone except for Charlie, who was wiping down the last of the tables. In all their chatter, which had covered everything from  the state of Missouri’s library (“Pastor Walker still hounds her but she ignores him like always”) to portion sizes in Texas (“You wouldn’t believe the size of these plates Sammy. I swear: they’re all fucking cannibals looking to fatten up unsuspecting tourists”), Dean never asked about John.
In front of them, Dean is trying desperately to pull away, but ‘Cas’ is biting down hard on his lips, bringing his hands up to roughly tug Dean even closer – fingers digging bruisingly tight into Dean’s skin and forcing him to stay put. Somewhere in his throat, he’s started to laugh at Dean’s panicked but ineffectual jerks of the head. Despite his words to Cas, it’s taking everything Sam has not to try and intervene, incorporeality be damned. Cas is practically vibrating at his side, desperate to act but powerless (in this half neutered, wingless state) to change the past.
“We didn’t change them,” Cas corrects him. “We can’t change the past. We altered your perception of them – of yourself.”
“Can you blame him? Look at you. You already tried to entice Castiel, who’s to say who you’ll try next.”
Sam doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to look anymore. He can’t turn away. He wants to be sick but he can barely even breathe. There’s a horrible gagging sound. It’s coming from his mouth. His hand is on Cas’ shoulder, and he faintly hears the angel’s gasp of pain as he squeezes hard enough to bruise, but he can’t do anything except squeeze harder.
It was a short car journey, only ten minutes or so, to the next town over. John worked as a mechanic in a garage near Sam’s middle school, and he enjoyed dropping the boys off and picking them up. It comforted him, that he could be present in their lives in any way, no matter how small.
“Don’t be, you weren’t there. Nothin’ you or anyone else could’ve done. ‘Cept God I guess.” His eyes flashed defiantly across Castiel’s face, measuring the reaction to his statement. When Castiel remained silent, he relaxed again. “Y’know Castiel, you don’t act much like a Preacher’s son would act.”
Dean rolled his eyes and moved slowly, as if it cost him a great effort, across the room to shake Jim and Castiel’s hands. “It’s truly blessed to see you today Father,” he intoned monotonously.
Stumbling, Sam and Cas make their way to the door. Cas passes over the threshold instantly, but Sam hesitates for a second – risking one last glance back. The Demon is the only Dean left, slowly dissolving yet seemingly unconcerned by his own fragmentation.
Cas opens his mouth to reply, seething, but Sam stops him with a warning look – they can’t afford to piss this ‘Dean’ off.
“I wouldn’t say that,” He could already feel himself relaxing around Dean. They had only known each other for a few days but it felt longer. “Uriel has been very...thorough.”
“Sam!” his younger self cries frantically, wrenching his hand from the older Dean’s grip to rip the covers off. Tears begin to leak from the corners of his eyes. “Where’s he gone? What’ve you done with him?”
“I mean, I always knew, sort of. You saw. I didn’t slip so easily into the box he wanted me in – it took a little hammering on his part.”
Dean watched him fondly, he recognised the look on Cas’ face, knew what he was feeling. He had felt it himself, after all, that night at the river. He wished Castiel had been there so he could’ve watched Dean’s face, seen Dean’s rebirth.
“Yeah well, I was there, sort of.  It was me after all. It was all me,” his eyes move downwards as he hunches his shoulders. “All of it,” he repeats in a lower voice.
Castiel felt like a visiting Statesman, Uriel led him from kid to another; everyone of them seemed to be expecting something of him. He did all he could do: he shook hands, smiled, and listened politely as they gushed about his father.
“That’s the spirit,” Dean says cheerily from right beside them, and they both flinch back in shock. He’d made no sound as he’d moved.  He gestures to the rows of doors lining the hallway. “So, where do you wanna start?”
Sam shows up late the next morning with calorific breakfast that Dean takes as the “sorry I told Cas about the homophobic ghost so you’d talk about your feelings’’  peace offering it is. The three of them crowd round the ridiculously undersized table; Sam’s stupidly oversized elbows banging into Dean’s as they cut their pancakes.
“No point prayin’ to him,” Dean says bitterly, pulling a t-shirt on roughly over his head. “He ain’t gonna do jack fucking shit.”
“You’re right Hael, I was being rude. It’s one of the things I’ve been trying to work on lately.” To anyone who didn’t know him, which was to say almost everyone, Dean sounded earnestly genuine. For Castiel, however, the sarcasm dripping from his voice was practically venomous. “In fact,” Dean continued in the same remorseful tone. “I was wanting to talk to Castiel about it. He’s been helping me you see.”  He stressed the word dramatically, Cas was sure it was over the top, but Hael’s eyes only widened in realisation.
“Well then trust me when I say that I’m always gonna come back.” They draw together for one last, long, lingering kiss, before Dean gets to his feet. “Right, well,” he holds his phone up in one hand, simultaneously beckoning for Sam and Cas to follow with the other. “Duty calls.”
“That’s the plan yeah. But what about you? What happened to you?” If it hadn’t been ten years since he’d seen Dean last, he would’ve noticed how his brother momentarily tensed, then deliberately relaxed. But it had been ten years, so Sam didn’t notice.
“I just wish he could see the light – as I did.” He replied slowly. “It’s... unfortunate that we’ve had to give up on him.” A few in the crowd nodded in agreement, and he relaxed.
Jonah (as he’s apparently called) laughs – a deep hearty (undeniably masculine) laugh. “You’re just lucky I had the night off work.”
Dean nods and pushes the blade deeper. Blood spurts and there’s pain – deep burning pain. Sam gasps involuntarily and Dean’s other hand clasps his arm – squeezing gently, a comforting counterbalance to the pain.
“I guess I just never thought it was yours – figured it came from whatever bar you’d been hustling or body you’d been burning.”
“That’s great Dean, it really is. Anna’s Naomi’s daughter isn’t she? She can come to ours before the dance.”
It was easier to agree, Cas decided, than to shatter Dean’s convictions. “I don’t think it matters anyway.” He said instead. “She was kind. She offered us a safe place. It’s more than anyone else would do.”
“Cas wasn’t with me,” now Dean just sounded confused. “He never showed: I figured he decided to stay with his Dad.”
“And what would I be giving them?” she asked indignantly. “Just the same ol’ bull they get anywhere else. No, I’m always gonna be here with the Truth. They can ignore me and starve me of money as much as they want.”
Alistair smiles knowingly, but nothing more. “Just how I’ve always preferred it,” he says. “I always do my best work when reality is more, hmm, relative.” Beside him, a razor materialises out of the mist, pushing at his hand impatiently. Alistair sighs. “Sadly, today is just a rerun – and I’m lagging behind. Got to stay on script. Still…” he takes the razor in his hand, brings it reverently to Dean’s chest.  “… You can’t beat the classics.” He presses down and the blood wells up, a river flowing down Dean’s skin. “I’m sure you remember what I’m going to ask you?” he purrs into Dean’s ear.
A piece of him (that piece Alistair slicing) is crying out: begging for him to break, to let the pain and blood stop. For everything to stop. It’s larger and it’s louder than it was before. He forces it down, somehow.
but guarded:  the emotions that had once flashed so freely across them gone. Or maybe Sam had just forgotten how to read them.
Inwardly, Castiel rolled his eyes and the lie, but Sam only grinned wider. “I don’t know how you do it,” he gushed. “Standing up there with all those people watching you, not mixing your words up or anything.” As he talked he led them through the short hallway and into a small dining room.
But Missouri wasn’t in her usual spot. Instead a grumpy, old and conspicuously white woman glared at him from Missouri's desk. “Um. Good morning.” He said, awkwardly. A slight ‘hmpf’ was her only reply, her mouth twisting.
“So rude,” Alistair sighs. “Runs in the family, I guess.” He does let go, however, stepping back to let Dean catch his breath.
“Shut up anyway.” They stand for a bit longer. “Hey Sammy,” Dean says after a while, “what’s a ‘trans’?”
“Dean Winchester, don’t even think about sneakin’ in without saying hi!” Both boys jumped guiltily, though Cas wasn’t sure why exactly. A small, dark skinned woman was making her way towards them.  Cas didn’t recognise her at all – she’d definitely never been to his father’s sermons. How many other  faithless townsfolk, he wondered, had he not met?
Sam eyed Dean suspiciously over breakfast. “What happened last night anyway?” His back was to John, so he missed the warning glare that flashed from him to Dean.
To Dean’s relief, the playground was empty, and he’d immediately pulled Cas into a tight embrace. He’d felt the other boy’s arms tighten around him. “Thank you Dean.” He’d said into Dean’s shoulder.
They always started in the library. He and Cas had gone almost every day, so it made sense.  Missouri generally left them alone, and the library was generally empty, giving them the privacy that was denied to them in the real world. Occasionally, however, Missouri would talk with them. She had a knack for asking difficult questions (and she always the avoided ones directed at her) but conversation flowed none the less.  It was always easy with her. Around Missouri, they could simply
To his surprise, and relief, Dean simply shrugs. “You gotta point,” he concedes. “But I think half the world already thinks we’re fucking – so whether we actually are or not won’t make a difference. Besides, they’ve always tried to do the same with me and Sam – and look how well that’s worked out. We always pull through,” he brings their hands up to his face, resting his forehead against them. “They’re always gonna hurt us anyway,” he whispers, “and I’m tired of hurting for only half of what I want – at least now I’ll know exactly what it is I’m fighting for and you can damn sure I’ll fight to keep it. That sound good to you?”
