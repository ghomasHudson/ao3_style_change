John stared down again at the clothes in his hands, until the cotton slid across his skin. He could feel his wolf, somewhere, very far from him.
“Oh, come on. Let’s not do that one again. You won’t kill me, Jawn. You could never even harm me.”
“But you’re just only a child.”
is. Been here that long?” His tone was suspicious. Had Sherlock been walking around on the Creation for a while now? How long? How had he gone unnoticed? How hadn’t
“Calm down Moran. I was only putting the freak in his place.”
“It is. It gets a bit confusing,” he conceded, softly. Confident John wouldn’t turn him away, he moved to take his left hand and give it a comforting squeeze. John smiled gently and squeezed back in answer, entwining their fingers.
If there was something that he hated more than he could bear, was the hospital smell. It seemed so paradoxical that he himself had worked as a kind of doctor in a time that already seemed too remote. The aseptic aroma, the acid of the disinfectant and the latex were asphyxiating. There was also a smell of plastic. And the air that entered his lungs was too pure. Clean. Even cold. Oxygen.
Feeling the bite of the cold air outside for the first time, he put his hands in the pockets and let the fire at his core warm him from the inside. He saluted Watson’s grave with a firm, final nod, satisfied with the current flow of the memories. Efficient. Organised. Military like.
He heard the bones in John’s jaw creak as he pressed them together with supernatural force. A vein at his temple made itself visible. Sherlock could read the hunger slowly taking over John. Soon, he would have no say in this.
Sherlock hadn’t been sure his brother would know how to handle a baby. It had been centuries since the last time Mycroft had any contact with an infant. John hadn’t seemed very confident either, and left to the kitchen to prepare her night bottles and distract himself. He knew Sherlock’s brother wouldn’t harm her. He was no menace. But he also didn’t want to be there when the inconsolable crying started.
He had been slightly concerned at first that this new information about his past experiences would make him wary of Sherlock. Maybe he’d find out something he wouldn’t like. Maybe he would press an issue that Sherlock would rather have kept secret or just private. Maybe this was going to be the end for them?
The succubus bowed again, receding into the darkness. With a feeling of unease, Sherlock flew back to the doors, still thinking about what he was missing. Oh, how he hated not knowing.
He listened as the screams lowered in volume till they became meaningless begging and finally there was nothing to hear but the weak sound of a heartbeat, slowly dying. John kept sucking, gluttonously, as the smell of blood faded as well.
“I'm going to teach you Johnny. I’m going to tame you.”
The detective smiled.
“Can you even imagine my brother as a pirate? Oh, no. He wasn’t. He became a very good tailor in  London. One of the best. He was changed when one of his customers, an influential man, got too attached to him. He saw his wasted potential, and ended up deciding it was best to show Mycroft what he was missing. It turned out Mycroft was not very enthusiastic about it. Still, his sire turned him anyway, and my brother ended up killing him when he changed.”
“It’s good to see your soul still remembers mine”, Morning Star whispered, as his hips pressed harder against John’s. He bit his lips, suppressing a moan. The human body was betraying him. “Because mine certainly  remembers yours.”
“You left us, Helel. You left
“I... I did some arrangements before…”

You may now proceed with your reading.
Darkness crept into the light of the flames at the side of the room, crawling until a shape solidified. A smell sinuous and sweet like dying roses on a graveyard filled the room
John’s smell grew stronger after that, and not even the lovely music was enough to distract him from it.
He lazily turned his face, raising his wings so he could see the demon at the top of the stairs. The crawling creature was moving restlessly, as if uncomfortable. He rolled his eyes, huffing. A cloud of dark smoke left his mouth and the smell of sulphur filled the air. Without bothering to move, he passed a hand through his hair, moving the unruly curls from his eyes
“You keep calling me like that. Do you hate me that much?”
The force of the suction eventually softened and slowed, blood already coagulating on his wrist, effectively cutting off the flow. “There. That’s good, John. My brave soldier. Now you can rest, love of mine. You’ll feel better now.”
“First of all, he’s
“Shut up, ‘m not talking to you.”
Sherlock was gasping, his lungs oppressed. He couldn’t breathe. His eyes began to sting, and tears began to fall. He could feel as if he had a rope that died in him, in tension, the other end fixed somewhere else. The inexplicable sensation of being bound to something or someone with an overwhelming intensity that had always kept him sane and alive, it started to unravel until it was hardly a thin strand, without any kind of support. He wanted to fight so that the fragment inside of him did not break, he begged for it.
“Oh yeah. I know him. Did he help you out?”
John smiled.
Right now, in the luxurious room, being baroque until it was enough, Holmes had made him have a bath. The simple smell of soap made him want to cry. It was real soap and not soap made up of grease and caustic soda, which was harsh and unpleasant. The water in the bath was also warm, without the need of being boiling against his skin by the heat of the fire, or freezing and being from the Thames, which happened when the gas broke down. And when he was little he never wanted to have a bath…
“Thank you. Now, If you’d excuse me. I have work to do.”
To hell with the advice that Mycroft gave him.
Particularly strong with testosterone, dopamine, and oxytocin, it was driving Sherlock crazy. In the past, every time John went on dates he reeked, his blood delightfully singing to him, raising his hunger and his desire, but also his possessive instincts because this was not displayed for Sherlock, but instead for some boring woman. The day of John’s wedding, his smell was stronger than ever. Sherlock had to leave the reception early because it was making him lose control and it was not his place to do anything about it.
“I am actually. He was a nice man. Worked hard, cared for us, and never cheated on mummy, which is actually unusual considering how much time they spent apart. He really loved her. But he was irresponsible getting her pregnant like that knowing he would have to leave. He loved us but he... wasn’t very good with children. At least he tried.”
Babies needed so much care.
John curved his spine to change the angle, and Sherlock howled as he came, hips spasming against John’s, his body shuddering with the intensity of the wave of orgasm. He felt the bitter taste of his own venom pooling in his mouth and resisted the urge to spit, swallowing instead. He felt his body go limp over John’s and how his mate’s arms cradled him in place, his legs still caught and raised.
“I would refrain from masturbating and save it for later. One never knows.”
He heard a muffled scream when the knife sank into John’s back, the smell of blood filling his nostrils till he saw red. Sherlock growled, watching as John kicked the suspect in the ribs, making him lose his feet. And that was when Sherlock grabbed him by the neck, throwing him with uncontrolled strength against the wall on the other side of the dirty alley.
Sherlock sighed, and it sounded like defeat.
“Damn it.”
“This was a lovely night. Thank you, John.”
“S’lock.”
A sob came from the monitor and he frowned, almost in distress. He was sure that even if he tried the door would be firmly locked, and not even his new vampire skills would get him out of it. So there was nothing he could do to check on his daughter. John was just starting to feel anxious, the sobbing growing louder, when the sound of moving sheets returned.
Escaping from his own mind, John had walked to the victim’s house, where he saw the police officers and a detective speaking with his devastated parents. John listened as close as he could without fear of being noticed. The boy had been acting strange lately. Leaving home with friends, and staying out until the morning. They just thought it was some kind of teenage phase. They were concerned the boy had been on drugs and hadn’t told them.
“Won’t Lestrade come asking for him? He’s not a complete idiot, you know.”
“He choked on his own vomit. How elegant of him.”
John nodded. If it was true that he would not be able to escape, at least it would make life easier for Holmes, who seemed to not enjoy his work at all.
The alley was silent and dark when they managed to get down from the building, reeking of human disposals. John was getting down from the last step of the fire scape, his heart racing from the adrenaline boost the chase had provided. His gun was firmly held in his hand, ready to shoot.
There was a laugh coming from Morning Star’s lips, but it wasn’t any happy sound. It made John growl.
“They won’t be able to catch me.”
cabin boy? Serving you lunch, helping you dress? Working around the ship half naked, covered in sweat?”
“Sherlock!” He cried, his face contorted in ecstasy. “Sherlock, Sherl...!”
It had been like that for ages.
“What the fuck!”
"What makes him different? Is he smart? Half Blood? Does he have a cure to it?" He mocked him. But Mike denied it.
Large windows in the living-room showed a vast field exterior  with not a single sign of other houses in the vicinity which actually made sense. If this was a place for retreat and protection, it was reasonable to assume they would have tried to avoid being surrounded by humans or other threats. Whether they had accomplished this out of sheer luck or by purchasing an obscene amount of parcels, he didn’t know. But John would’ve put all his money on Mycroft owning a big ass estate without blinking twice.
"What do you do for him? What does he want from you? What do you do?" And this time, the answer came. And from that moment forward he wished he had not asked for it. "We found a group of dystopians," he said, looking at him with lifeless eyes. Alcohol and years of service with the Leader had cooled what were once the warm eyes of, his brother. The years of separation with his dragon had also affected him, souring his character. Now, the denomination "Iceman" was finally living up to its title. "And we took them up to him. Then, if it is necessary, we ... get rid of them." In the presence of Mycroft's words, Sherlock froze in place. He had expected something bad, but not as dreadful. Mycroft took his hand and squeezed it tightly, so much that it hurt. "It's fucking hell, Sherlock. Stay away from there."
“Yessss.”
Unless...
The unsteady sensation was growing stronger, the urge to burn, to purify, to
John’s eyes were closed, his face turning paler by the minute, his body growing cooler. He held him tightly, rocking softly as if lulling him to sleep. Sherlock knew there wasn’t much left to do but wait.
Just another thing to the list then.
The man in front of him was every inch the angel he had once being. Dark, luscious curls, as shiny as raven feathers. He could remember clearly how soft they were against his fingers. His cheeks, pale as always, were covered by a low flush, making him look so innocent. Lips parted slightly, as if he was going to speak and his grey eyes, like thunder, were now almost a clear blue. Like a newborn’s.
“What should I call you, then?”
“Don’t try it, unless you want to die. And I believe that would be inappropriate.”
Sherlock rested his back on the chair.
It was strange to see again the streets of London in which he grew up in, in the London where there were green parks and people were cared, where the streets oozed with life, and traffic was suffocating, but steady, it was as if an immense and invisible heart would pump it through the veins of the city… blood made up of metal and gasoline… He grew up in a London where the traffic lights would work and the streetlights were promptly lit when the light left the horizon and weren’t turned off until dawn appeared… Where children played without fear of being assaulted by the authorities.
John took the clothes with his hands, still shackled, and looked at them. They were basic, made of white cotton, undyed. The short-sleeved t-shirt and the pants were baggy. It looked more like a sporty tracksuit than anything else.
had always kept him alive, no matter how complicated the situation was. And if Sherlock was hungry, he always managed to bring him food. At least, the one that was available and easily accessible. Sherlock had tried to teach him that he should not risk it too much.
“Good. Think I’m sleeping today.” Sherlock took out his mobile, texted Lestrade about the running suspect and sent their location. “All this chasing after all this weeks of
“I know”, Sherlock growled. Blood started pooling, the ugly winter jumper already dark and damp, and his fangs were trying to come out from the sight and sweet smell.
“This place is wonderful. It was a great idea. Thank you for taking me here.”
He noticed for the first time in his appearance, since he entered the room for the first time. The suited man had dark circles under the eyes, and licked his lips at a regular basis. John knew those symptoms. They were the reactions of a drinker. His body under under the suit was little for a man his age, almost bordering on anorexia. The locator chip on his right ear told him that he was currently living in the ‘Lion Den’, and in not very good conditions. He presented mild symptoms of malnutritions, maybe even in the early stages.
outside Paris, in Orsay. She used to act as a nanny when my parents weren’t home and was a teacher in the local school.”
Sherlock noticed, despite his limited knowledge in the animal field that his unexpected companion of dreams was no more than a puppy. Its head was still bigger than its body, and the legs would bounce as if it was wishing to play at any time. The pup reminded him of
“You’re a pet Johnny. You’re my pet. And I’m going to
“Fuck, Sherlock.”
Mercury: an old broken thermometer used for the poisoning, dropped into one of the “detox” drinkable mixes the victim took, a bit every day for two weeks. The trigger: harassment. Proximity: the murderer and the victim had shared the dormitory for almost a year.
The look John gave him, something between confusion and hurt, almost made him frown. He felt as if he was missing something. Was he?
Coughing and with his heart racing, John got up from the ground where he had fallen, and hurried again to the bathroom, to find the room filled with water, barely the frame of the bathtub surfacing. Light was turned off, and John was confident turning it on may be unadvisable, given that he was covered in water to the waist already. He hurried to close the open taps, and heard the blessed sound of silence. No more water rumble. Just his own hurried breathing.
Sherlock was panting, by the time the light died out and the warmth receded . John was blinking, as if confused, looking at him on the floor. Something flashed quickly across his eyes, cold and sad, and his hands were closed in tight fists at his sides.
John nodded his head and slowly lowered himself down onto Sherlock’s cock. The vampire was holding himself in place so John had better leverage to work comfortably and had to muffle a moan when he felt the tip of his head pressing against John’s entrance. John gasped and pressed down harder, and suddenly Sherlock’s cock was sliding inside, the lube smoothing the process. It was fascinating how John’s muscles seemed to suck him in and yet how tight it felt, even if he had double checked John’s readiness first. John’s preparation had been thorough and Sherlock had done almost nothing else besides making sure everything was in place, plus a bit of foreplay.
Compared to the blessed hotness of John’s presence, Hell’s temperature was surprisingly cold. Sherlock moved across the waves of lost souls, their torments like murmurs in the distance with the occasional desperate scream. The never ending spiral of dark ice descended into pools of fire and darkness. He reached a sort of cliff, ashes covering the burning coils under his feet. Unfurling his wings, he stretched them, feeling the hot wind that came from below. As if a gigantic beast were breathing through a pitch dark chimney. His wings felt heavy at his back, and there was a certain pleasure in allowing the feathers to stretch and reposition themselves in their right place. He gave an evaluating flap and, after checking that everything was  fine, he let himself fall down the cliff into the darkness.
John’s nipples were proudly erect, his skin flushed and feverish. Sherlock could hear the frantic beating of his heart, the musky smell of sex and maleness impregnating the air and collapsing his senses.
Sherlock could have had a normal life in the "clean" area of the city, across the Thames, but it was not what he wanted. He had been in the care of Mycroft after the death of their parents. Although saying death was sugar coating the obvious lie. It would be more appropriate to say it was a murder because after the authorities found that Mycroft was a dystopian by identifying him with his dragon, he was sentenced to death. He would have been shot if it weren't for the Holmes parents to take the responsibility for it. The government accepted the change as long as Mycroft worked for him them as their personal adviser, but he would have to reside in the Lions Den, like all the other dystopians. And he could never have a partner, or they would be executed.
“I love you too.”
“The Leader requires your presence, dog.”
Last thing John heard before leaving, was the soft click of the wooden panel sliding and finding the windowsill, before the safety lock was put back on.
“You know, I’m kind of flattered. You went very feral there.”
The rumbling sound of Mycroft came through the speaker, interlaced with Rosie’s cries. It was strange how John was able to separate all of the sounds, as if he was receiving them individually instead of all together from a single source. Even the interference of the monitor was a different tune.
It was the nicest of moments, and John would find himself visiting this memory again from time to time, in the future. Whenever he had doubts, whenever he missed them, whenever he felt like something wasn’t enough.
Thanks for reading and I'll see yall very soon!
Not all dystopians–this is how they had called them in the early twentieth century when the first humans with animal spirits began to emerge–were destined to a partner, as they could die before meeting each other; or you could be a dystopian and your animal could never manifest. Furthermore, being a dystopian married to another dystopian did not guarantee that the offspring would also be one, so they were a part of the population that was quite unpredictable.

, was lying besides her, staring her with sad eyes and her tail hanging low.
Angels had preferred spots to operate in. For some the isolated areas were best. Lonely places with low levels of human population, extreme climates and wild fauna. For others, the frenetic, overpopulated cities with almost no natural areas were the ideal spots. Angels had to adapt to technology and changing lifestyles, to new worries and problems.
, and he saw how the doors closed. As the apparatus went down, the pain still went through his body. It was as if he had a hand holding his heart, squeezing every time more, cutting his respiration.
The blood of his wounds and the tear that they surely had, stained the cotton without dyeing the garments, and it was as if he was going naked.
“What about Mycroft? Was he a pirate, too?”
He saw how Sherlock’s cheeks turned subtly pink, his face pleased. Sherlock curled around him, burying his nose into his armpit, taking a deep breath.
John walked slowly to him, found Sherlock’s and and squeezed it gently. Sherlock took a tissue from the desk beside them, and carefully cleaned the blood from his face, mindful of not leaving a drop. When he finished, John caressed his face with his free hand. His thumb moving lovingly over his cheekbone, before guiding him against his, mouth seeking Sherlock’s.
When the door of the safe room opened, Sherlock came in effortlessly dragging a seemingly unconscious human behind him. He tossed it inside as if it was a lifeless rag doll, before closing the door again and knocking three times on it. John heard the strong, metallic clang of engines turning, and all he could think about was how that door had a big ass lock.
All he could think about was John showering. John getting ready for some date with another insipid woman.
John saw how Sherlock’s pupils dilated slightly at the mention of John as a cabin boy. He felt something warm pool low in his belly, and all the desire that had burned inside of him since the morning was suddenly washing over him again.
John froze for a second. What if Mrs. Hudson had been taking a bath, slipped and fell? What if she was unconscious with the bathtub taps open, and she was drowning?
As always, thousand flowers to my lovely beta Ami. You are the best!

“You want me to fuck you?”
It was why that small and short conversation was so important. It was because if Jim had dared to lay his filthy hands on his soulmate, the person that gave him a reason to not end his life and stopped him in killing himself in those first three years of the dictatorship; he would kill him slowly and painfully. If his wolf was one of those people trapped in the hell that Mycroft had to come and go every day, he would then lose his mind.
Thanks for reading!
That said, I let you read.
I do repeat myself just in case: read the tags, I beg you. There might be triggering stuff ahead, and it's not my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or triggered. I'll do post warnings on the harder chapters, but take in consideration what kind of story I'm telling here. Its not going to be all rainbows and happy flowers. If you feel there's anything missing in the tags, feel free to tell me and I'll add. I wrote down as many as I could thought about that might be important. There might be additions as the story develops, though.
The detective made a face, trying to find the best way to explain something he wasn’t quite sure about himself. John had seen that expression only a few times, yet he would recognise it anytime and any place.
John blinked in surprise. He could now understand why Jim wanted Holmes to be at his side. To be able to know everything about a person by just looking...
The Blood of Our Kind will be a series composed by several, incoming short stories about our boys lives as vampires in Baker Street, solving crimes, being BAMF, raising a child, and all I can possibly think about. Plot for the next three one-shots coming after the end of this are being finished, and as soon as I hit the last "Post Without Review", I'll put myself to work.
“You, Morning Star, are a traitor. You should be a prisoner at the eighth circle. I don’t care how you managed to escape confinement. Luckily for you, I didn’t come for your sorry arse.”
He could not stop dwelling over his head, thinking what could Jim possibly want from him. He had heard stories about what they were doing to the dystopians in Buckingham, but he preferred to think that they were just that: stories. Holmes led him to the lift and both were alone in the metal space as they descended to the ground floor.
Jim brought him to a room where a double bed lay. Morgan’s tiger was lying in a corner, and John looked for him around the room, without success. He would probably not be far off. Perhaps he was standing guard at one of the gate, in case he tried anything. When Jim tied the strap to the bed and then held him, tying his hands on either side of the headboard, and his feet to the legs, when he began to feel something akin to panic. He frantically sought a way out, a way to escape, but all of them went with assaulting Jim if he could even break free, and all of them confronted the security when he would leave the room. He tried to regulate his breathing, remembering the words of Mycroft. ‘
It was intoxicating, and if his stomach could’ve growled, it would have already. He would’ve loved to close his mouth and pierce John’s skin to have a taste of the ambrosia hiding there. But it was not the time.
“So, it’s magic.”
Deep inside, he knew John would be just fine. The rate of success for human-to-vampire changing was extremely high, especially with vampires who’s enzymes had never been used. Like his. Maybe it was just the anticipation of John’s reaction upon awakening or that he was still altered after seeing him die. Regardless, the feeling in his gut was not leaving him. Not even knowing Mycroft would take care of Rosie helped.
“Yes, we do. Two under John Watson.”
“Please. Explain to me why I pulled out a sword from Mrs. Hudson’s flooded bathtub?”
“Irene.”
The high ceilings were  naked grey stone, as were the floors. The latter covered by the occasional rug. It had a similar vibe to the old Scottish castles of the North. He was unsurprised to see that even though most of the lights were electric (including the oldest looking ones), there were some oil and  gas powered ones, too. John couldn’t resist trying to .turn one on.
On the other hand, Sherlock was having difficulty getting rid of his own trousers. He tried to slide them down his butt and ended up having to buck his hips upwards to make some room. That caused his now free erection to press right between John’s covered butt cheeks, making both of them moan. John found himself pressing back down in answer, his spine arching and a hand resting on Sherlock’s chest for leverage.
“John, I’m absolutely capable of taking care of your daughter. There’s no need to send her to Graham’s and alter her night habits when I’m available...”
He raised their joined hands to softly kiss the back of John’s, cold and almost rigor mortis hard. He could still feel the callouses on the skin from his years in the army, handling weapons and medical equipment. He was always been comforted by feeling John’s hands. They were so reliable and as steady as the man behind them. Was odd for a vampire, a highly resourceful predator, to feel comforted and safe because of a human. But as strange as it seemed, Sherlock found no other explanation for the peace of mind that descended upon him when John was around, when he held Sherlock at night, arms wrapped around his middle and chin on his nape.
The good thing about newborns was the haze of bloodlust that took control once they tasted fresh human blood for the first time. Killing was not easy for some, but once the fever rose, there was no morality or rational thinking. Only need.
“I don’t have anything to lose, John. But you do. What about your soul mate? What would happen to them if you get caught?”
going to that restaurant,” he joked, fascinated to discover he, too, was breathless.
“I want information. About someone.”
They had eternity ahead. Together.
“John!”
John got himself into a narrow street, still dark and poorly illuminated by the lights. The ground was wet from the night rain, and he heard a splash when he stepped into a puddle. The smell was stronger here, covered and tangled with something viscous and dark. The hairs on the back of  his neck rose, the flame inside burning, ready to serve.
John closed his eyes, fighting the memories flooding his head. Past feelings of soft, loving hands caressing his skin as if it was the most precious thing. Laughs like tiny bells, and the warm sensation of not being alone. Whispers of love from past times echoing at his ears.
That got the full and complete attention and seriousness of Sherlock, who turned around to look at him, forgetting the smuggling, forgetting everything. He had told Mike about his soul mate a few years ago, after he insisted too much about it. Somehow, he eventually asked him indirectly that if he saw a sand colored wolf in Buckingham or the surrounding areas, to let him know. If his soulmate was in the service of Jim Moriarty he preferred know, as bad as it was than to remain in ignorance.
He called again, still softly, and waited. Seconds later he saw John turn, his eyes changing focus and piercing his own. The pupils were contracted, capillaries around the ocular globes making themselves visible. His skin was losing the pinkish shade that had coloured his cheeks and lips when Sherlock left the room that morning. It was too soon for it to happen, but Sherlock was unsurprised by how fast his blood was running out inside of his veins. The wound had been deep and nasty, and John had simply lost too much blood. A vampire’s change could only do so much.
“Well, that’s impressive.”
The Archangel sounded weary. It was strange to see how a confident, trusting soul had come to be this... bitter.
Ahem...........
The training session had been good. It was stimulating and surprisingly fun. Sherlock had given him a few strength tests to see how far he could go and then he monitored his speed by making him run on a treadmill. In the end, they established that John was proportional in strength and speed  to how he had been as a human. His reflexes were agile but Sherlock, with his long legs, could outrun him without much effort.
“Well, there’s not many ways he could have left... He definitely fell over this mound of rubbish.” Sherlock walked to the broken black bags, lifted the skip’s lid, grimacing at the rotten smell before closing it again. He looked around once more. “Let’s call Lestrade. There’s nothing else we can do here.”
Satisfied with his new arrangement, Sherlock sighed, closed his eyes and drifted back into a relaxed sleep.
“Do you trust me?”
It had been clear. Extremely so. Rosie had never done that before. Was she calling for him? For Sherlock? He wanted to cry. She had just managed to say her first meaningful word and neither he nor Sherlock were there to answer it.
He moved closer, trying to get his arms into the bathtub, to try and find her, or to find the plug and pull it off so at least some of the water got drained.
Sherlock was too happy with the food to worry about insulting his nosy brother.
Could he win him back?
John dropped the bags at the dry stairs and hurried to Mrs. Hudson’s door, carefully calling her name and knocking on her door. He could hear the water rumour of a stream. Which was weird. Or worrisome. Because if some pipe inside Mrs. H had broken so bad it sounded like an actual stream, the situation was worse than he thought.
“It’s good you are fine by yourself, my child. But loneliness can be such a great burden,” she said before they parted. He remembered that day as clearly as if it had happened yesterday. He sometimes wished he didn’t. His mother had sounded so sad and resigned.
The angel pressed his lips together, a hand passed across his hair before the fingers pressed against his nose bridge, eyes closed. The other hand came to rest at his hip, and Sherlock could almost hear the gears turning in John’s head.  His thoughts and memories trying to find logic in the new information. He looked frustrated.
There was no need to answer. John’s train of thought seemed to be rather slow at the moment, but maybe the only thing he was looking for was reassurance.
I wait for your opinions, let’s see if this new type of Johnlock is welcomed!
He remembered his stupid face when he saw the silhouette of the crow flying in circles over them, standing out in the ground when he found himself with Lestrade after the gathering, while they were talking. Because he looked up as if he had gone mad and Greg looked at him as if he had lost his mind.
The crying slowly died down and John was amazed to find he could hear a soft drumming, muffled by several layers. It was easy to identify it as Rosie’s heartbeat. At first it was a bit fast, showing the child’s distress, and then slowing down as her sobs did.
Without energy or blood enough in his system to blush, Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
Keep your friends close and your enemies even more.
“You are a marvel and I don’t deserve you,” John told him softly. His eyes were tender, and his left hand found Sherlock’s, squeezed it gently and intertwined their fingers.
“Hurt him, and you won’t even have the chance to see the police”, Sherlock menaced, taking a cautious step forward.
Well, this is the end of this, my dudes!
Sherlock turned his head on the pillow to look at John, hopeful. His mate smiled, the soft light coming from the only window in the room made it look like a fantasy. Unreal.
“Not like this.” His hands held John tightly, and he wondered if the ache in his heart was real and not just some trick of his mind. “Not this way.”
“I’m the one being asphyxiated against a wall. Excuse me for trying to enjoy the ride”, he said, lack of air clearly obvious. John could feel the struggle of the muscle beneath his hand, fighting against the firm press in an effort to let the oxygen pass. “If you want to get up to date you only need to ask.”
He felt how his feathers puffed in alarm. Something was wrong. Something terrible was out of place here. It felt like a pressure at his chest, uncomfortable and slightly suffocating.
“I promise to make good use of it” he muttered, lovingly. “Rest now, my good soldier.”
Sherlock sighed.
And all that he could think when he felt Jim’s hands over his body, was that the rumors were true. They were damn certain.
“I’m strong. But not like
Don’t kill me, I promise to have a re-encounter in the next chapter. From here on everything improves, I swear it on Johnlock.
“I haven’t been spying on you, if it’s what you are thinking. I have only observed. You walk like someone in the army would walk, but you are too young to have been able to enlist yourself before this started, so surely you belong to the rebels. By the way you behave, you have discipline and authority, so that suggests a certain range. Not so low to be Lieutenant, but not high enough to be Higher, so it’s clear that you are a Captain. From the Northumberland group, from what I have understood. In the ‘Lion Den’ there were some comments the other day that they were ambushed in the tube and one of them was taken. I also know that you are a doctor by the look of your hands. They are firm, secure and prepared for hard jobs. Besides, I think I’ve seen you in one of those mobile stations under the Millennium bridge sometime,”
“We’re both clean. I know you take monthly tests and I did one on myself after Mary. Do what you want but if you don’t fuck me right this instant...”
Suddenly he felt as if a building crashed into him. There was a tremendous hit at his side, and the next thing he knew his body was being pushed to the ground. Someone fell onto him, heavy and hard, as a car passed fast, the driver slammed loudly on the horn as he yelled and sweared at him. Had he been crossing a road? Idiot.
John looked at him. Holmes watched at him from his position, alongside a window. His eyes were closed and his jaw was clenched.
“Hell, yes.”
The double doors of the room closed with the click of a latch being moved in place.
It was the first and the last time that he saw tears in the eyes of his brother.
Taking a deep breath, he tried to distract himself with the
The man’s face was bright red, his eyes looking at the ceiling. Sherlock grinned and carefully, slid a second finger inside, easily entering him. He tried moving them in and out slowly a couple of times and heard John holding his breath, his hands clutching Sherlock’s shoulders harder. He hummed and concentrated on curving his fingers just the right way before resuming the movement.
It was tentative at first, an exploratory tongue teasing clean, dry lips, asking for permission. He heard a low growl, deep from John’s belly, and felt the set of fangs extend past their covers as John pressed against him and deepened their kiss, searching greedily for Sherlock’s tongue with his own. John’s strong hands grabbed his forearms with inhuman force. Sherlock moaned, teasing John’s fangs with the tip of his tongue, making sure he covered them with the criminal’s blood, and then reached for the glands behind them, giving tiny flicks over the sensitive skin, feeling them fatten and swell under his attentions. John growled again, sending a vibration through his neck that made Sherlock’s skin tingle, getting goosebumps all over.
He gave a couple of final sucks (cautious of the blood escaping through the wound), and right before John was about to pass out, he injected the venom, staying still to ensure it circulated throughout John’s body.
John sat on the floor in the middle of the room, legs crossed under him and closed his eyes. He focused on the energy it had, a reminiscence of its previous inhabitant. The explosive energy of Jordan was all around, impregnating every corner. And yet, it was not what John was looking for. He was trying to find something darker. Something dangerous and unsteady...
“You know I haven’t. I’m a prisoner, if you remember correctly. Bound to the fires of hell and all of that” he answered, waving a hand towards the vicious flame on his head. John winced when he saw it curl around one of the black horns before burning a dark lock of hair down to ashes.
With a cry of frustration, John punched the wall next to the demon’s face with his free hand, getting closer. The man lazily opened his eyes, pupils dilated, and looked straight into his eyes.
He swallowed, ready to continue, when he saw
“Good,” He replied at Ethan, without looking at him. He lowered his gun and discharged it, disarming it before storing it in its assigned locker.
“Another vampire attacked his bodyguards?”
The taste was bitter, not particularly charming, but it tasted so deeply of John that he groaned in pleasure. At last. Sherlock might not be able to drink from him, but if this was the closest he could get, he would be happy enough with it.
“Master” said a voice, dripping like honey. The woman, who seemed to be made of smoke, formed in front of him.
John moved to make himself comfortable, his erection flagging despite being desperate and needy. Sherlock hissed when he moved as the tip of his erection brushed against the crest of John’s butt. Sherlock moved one hand to grab the tube of lube he had on his night table and when he used the other to find John’s entrance, he heard him clearing his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock lowed himself, face to face to the man on the floor. He gave a brusque pull, hauling him up from the floor till he rested on his knees. It had been a while since he had taken any blood directly from a human, and even longer since he had taken any kind of chemical-compromised blood. He was sure he was going to get high because of this. John’s system might be able to purge and process the blood without side effects, but his couldn’t.
A faint trail caught his attention. It was a certain smell of sulphur and ashes he knew too well. Demons were the only creatures capable of such trails. The sweet, overwhelming smell lying beneath, though, was another matter entirely. He had never smelled anything like it. It was like a dying rose.
“How bossy. Calm down, Captain. We don’t want blood today, do we?”
John made an affirmative sound, agreeing that the latter sounded even more strange. Maybe all of it had only been a twisted situation. Maybe Sherlock had just been extremely, stupidly lucky. He profoundly disliked thinking there was a very real chance of him never meeting Sherlock. And yet there was nothing he could have done about it. He silently thanked whatever gracious deity had considered them worthy of a chance of being together.
With only a dim light coming from the door behind him, he blinked and tried to find a passed out landlady, but he was unable to see much.
“Absolutely.”
The wolf’s fur was a pale tone, it looked as if it were clear honey; it was sprinkled with white in the tips in areas where it became darker, behind the ears and in the edges of the lower back. The blue eyes of the animal followed all of his movements while it scurried around with its hanging tongue, sniffed the air with his snout, and moved his pointed ears backward and forwards. He observed the wolf from above. His most recurring fantasy was of flying, he always felt comfortable with the idea of rising over everything else. Sometimes, he dreamed that he was a fierce and daring pirate, but he couldn’t compare the freedom of flying with being a fierce pirate that was feared.
When they made it to the restaurant, John paid to the driver before he had the chance to reach for his card, and then slipped out of the car to open Sherlock’s door for him. Surprised by the gentlemanly behaviour displayed by his friend, he took John’s offered hand and walked to the restaurant’s dining room.
“I’ve been considering this for centuries. And I can’t think of a single member of my crew who could have been a vampire at that time. Plus the fact that nobody showed up when I rose is revealing... All I can conclude is that my change must have been an accident. Maybe the vampire who sired me was trying to feed because they were badly injured in the fight. Perhaps something made them stop, and the venom was already in my system. As I drowned, the change process was triggered and by the time the current took me to shore, I was already a vampire.”
An intoxicating fragrance reached its peak, as if it had exploded before levelling out to manageable standards, the strongest of its combined essences being the fresh scent of John’s come.
Morning Star was looking at him in a way that made him remember the times human soldiers were passing away and saw his true form. How besotted they seemed.
The sound on the other side of the baby monitor cut off, and John was left alone and silent in the room again, for almost a whole minute.
John stood still, feeling the cold in his bare skin. The windows were closed, but the mere air circulating around the room was enough to make him shiver.
John smiled a moment before containing himself.
“Of course.”
Which hospital? He had not the slightest idea.
and... Look, I’m not sure I want to murder someone in cold blood...”
He could feel the astral heat from Moran's Tiger at his side, walking with parsimony. Little by little, his vision got clearer, and was hardly aware of the cold metal floor of the freight lift. He waited quietly, watching the indicator. They were on the floor minus two, and they were heading to the tenth floor. He had plenty of time.
John smiled. “Conflicted as fuck. When you died, I was grieving so badly. My psychologist was very convinced you and I had been dating because it was taking so long and was so intense. I noticed I wasn’t just grieving you, but all the things that could have been and couldn’t anymore, all of the ‘if I’ and ‘I should have.’ I was so close to knowing, to seeing it clearly. But then I met Mary, and it was comfortable and safe with her. And it was no use worrying about the past anymore.”
“You... drowned?”
“I want to.”
John had discovered that Jim had a talent to wear down those that were around him. It was as if he knew exactly how to extract the vitality of their bodies, how to consume their hopes, until nothing mattered except the concept of survival. Until you became an automaton of perpetual motion with a list of tasks that had to be complete before collapsing on the hard mattress in a narrow and wet room.
There it was. Three little words to shake his world to ashes.
He lost count the times that he was hit with the belt, or the many times that he was bitten until he would bleed. Or when he picked a knife and began to cut him to just see the blood flow out and then lick it. Or when he circled his neck with his hands, with unexpected strength due to his constitution, until he was on the verge of unconsciousness. John slid into a haze in which made him aware of everything that was happening, but all felt like a dream.
He had also just turned twenty.
He spent the first night in deep thought, trying to focus on his mission rather than on the infuriating demon he had met. Morning Star was not going to keep him from fulfilling his duty. Not again.
“I’m sorry, but if he comes back and it’s not on you...”
“John... fuck!”
John knew there was a demon involved. He was so sure about it he would bet one of his wings on it. Why a demon had taken the hassle and time to kill a human, he did not know.
The image of the crow return to his mind. The dream of that night had been so comforting…
Irene had dragged Sherlock half ‘
was growing by the second. He could feel his wings completely puffed, his core vicious like a caged, hungry beast. Sherlock, on the other hand, looked calm and collected. Coal wings neatly folded at his back, the tips of the longest primaries gently brushing the polished floor.
“An angel has been walking around the Creation. I want to know where, and how long he has been doing it.”
Those seven years had tanned his skin, his mind, his body and his heart. He was harder, stronger and more experience than when he had been when he was captured. He began to reach his thirties. He had traces of a beard in his face, and his eyes, although young, they looked like those of  an old man, tired and wise, they were the eyes of someone who had seen too many things. Someone who had lived too much.
"Oh. This will interest you, Sherlock. It turns out that he is a dystopian," said Mike.
His best friend, Sally Donovan, a guerrilla which was a former agent of the old Scotland Yard which had a panther as an animal, had been engaged in his side in his squad in Northumberland, and more than once she had asked him why hadn’t he engaged to only be a medic, knowing that he still had a chance to change. Sally had joined the rebels when she had learned from a dream that her soul mate had died.
Sherlock opened the lube bottle and dispensed a generous amount of it on his other hand before coating his erection with it, making sure it was enough. He distracted John by trailing kisses along his jaw, and then over his lips. He waited until his mate’s heart returned to a normal pace for someone so excited, and then stopped, looking him in the eye.
He was about to lecture his friend about it, when Sherlock took the black sackcloth bag off the man’s head.
The man’s head turned, eyes fixing on the demon with sudden interest. His wings twitched, spasming softly at the implications. Archangels never walked the Above. They didn’t like getting their hands dirty. If one of them was even bothering to do so, something was clearly off. Something important enough that the Mighty did not dare to send any other of his servants.
“It will be four years since I started. But it feels much more.”
The police left and he scaled the wall quietly to sneak into the boy’s room. Jordan, as his parents had called him, seemed like any regular english teen, he thought, once he flew through the open window with his wings. There were several football posters around, bands, and pictures of friends. It was cleaner than he thought a teenager’s room would be, but he guessed his parents had tidied it up. That, and the police probably had taken evidence already.
John’s soft laugh sounded like music. “Not ‘as if’.
He saw the demon rise an eyebrow.
Before this moment, given more time and boredom, he might have fallen into giving the man a chit-chat before the feeding started, just to have a little fun. But he couldn’t find any interest in him to do so now. His fangs were elongating, coming out of their covers, and he felt the sharp points pressing against the tender inner skin of his lower lip. As much as he wanted to scare the shit out of this man, to torture him till he was a mess and only after proceeding to feed, John’s hunger was a bit of a pressing agenda.
Sherlock growled and ripped the smelly t-shirt from the man’s neck, hearing his whimpers and cries of confusion.
He had heard of cases where the change couldn’t be finished because the intended was too weak or the blood of the vampire trying the change could fail. But Sherlock’s blood was strong enough for a good, safe change. He wasn’t worried about that. He was worried John was too far gone to complete the process by swallowing his blood. Without it, John’s body would remain in a numb state untill he inevitably died, starving and floating in a limbo of nothingness.
“Who are you calling a freak, you moron?” Asked Moran, tackling Ethan to a side with force.
Or maybe it was only the stress of him knowing what will happen to him when Moriarty crossed the door.
So John was starting to get delirious. Or so Sherlock thought.
“Hell, I hope there’s a heaven after all. Maybe I can talk my way in. I’d hate to think I won’t see you again.”
“I know, John. It’ll be over soon.” Sherlock held John firmly against him as he got to his feet. For the sake of appearances, he usually had to act every time he held John, controlling his real strength in front of other people. But now it was no use.
The cabbie seemed very glad when they finally arrived to Baker Street, glad they were taking the situation some other place that wasn’t his back seats. They stood at 221’s door, not wanting the night to end but also wanting it to develop into something more.
. I hate to think I owe him, but a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.”
“Hold on, Holmes. Just a bit more...”
Sherlock was about to ask if he’d done something wrong when the strong smell suddenly diminished, and he realised John had been about to come.
“So. I’m quite strong now. Aren’t you?”
He was hidden on one of the closets the police (unsurprisingly) hadn’t inspected. When John noticed it and tried to open it carefully to get him out, the suspect hit him with the door and fled, jumping out the window.
“Listen. The only thing coming between me and a well deserved rest is this case. I’m willing to extend a truce as long as you step aside and let me finish this. Just. Please. If you ever loved me. It’s all I’m asking.”
“I have seen others that have arrived here before you. And I have seen many others go out. If you want my advice, the best thing is to not fight it back. What's about to happen, will happen whether you like it or not. And the more you resist, the longer he’ll prolong it”, he pointed, leaving the gun in a drawer. He turned John's face to wipe the blood from his ear. “I wish we had met under different circumstances, John. I have the feeling we would have been good... collaborators.”
Except that it had .
“Now I’m regretting making that reservation. Christ,” John said, breathless. Sherlock could sense his excitement shining out of him like a neon light, flashing with sexual desire. He didn’t need to look down to know John was exhibiting the proudest boner of his life. He smiled.
… He would have wished to have a longer bath, but remembering why he was here and who was waiting for him made the desire he had to have a bath fly away.
“Speak.”
But, above all, he allowed himself joy. He allowed himself the forgiveness.
A creak in the wooden floor alerted him, and he looked at the door of Jordan’s room. Someone was about to come in, perhaps the parents. He turned to look at the window and the moving curtains. It was a small gap but he could make it in time. Anything to avoid memory erasing. Guess he’d have to move his investigation down other paths. Not that he would be able to get anything more from poor Jordan anyway.
“Oh. That’s quite romantic.”
He clenched his shackled hands. His poor wolf had been placed in a cage in the same room as him. The cage was electrified, creating a power grid that hurt his wolf if he tried to push his nose through the wire mesh. The animal was cowering in the small space, whimpering to the sounds of his owner suffering. He knew that he had to give up, he had to obey if he wanted to get away from all of this. However, at twenty-one years, he was hardly an adult in an unfavorable and unpleasant situation, and his youthful instinct told him not to escape in this situation. It told him to fight through it.
“Where?”
"Like all. Do not think I feel camaraderie for those who are like us because you're wrong. It's no good, Mike."
Rosie tonight. He couldn’t let himself sulk just because John went looking for a normal life. There was a baby to take care of now.
Sherlock did not want to know the misfortune of all those dystopians. He had long surrendered in trying to empathize with them. He had enough with Wiggins, the engine that was moving his plan. It was what lit his thirst for revenge. "I do not care what that maniac does. He cannot be stopped. I do not want to know."
If it also gave him the chance to have John riding him right there at the kitchen stool after things got heated, well. That was undoubtedly something to celebrate, too. Perhaps even worth the mess of a human sacrifice.
“Mmmngh... S’lock.”
“Not as strong as you are, I can assure you.”
“It’s good to see you eating this well. Mycroft told me you would like this place,” John observed, smiling softly at him.
It took only a couple of minutes more till John took a step backwards, sighing as he moved away from the now dead man, pinned to the wall. The body fell heavily to the floor at John’s feet, eyes closed and throat marked by bloody rivers and tears. Dark marks where John’s hand and fingers had held him still, now fading to an ugly yellow.
When he rose, John’s eyes were closed, a peaceful expression on his face, his lips a bit parted. His breathing was slow and steady, his heartbeat a too-soft drumming inside his chest.
’s head, gently passing it downwards. He felt his wolf’s ears low, and heard the soft pitiful sounds that he uttered. He noticed that his snout was resting on a tight spot on his body. He tried to sit up and a flash of pain pierced him and brought him back abruptly in place.
However, the scariest thing of all was that he had a machine that was able to tell who was the couple of who. And that was making everything scarier lately.
He was face to face with Morning Star, their faces so close they were breathing the same air. The faint taste of ashes and smoke tingled against  his mouth, and he saw the demon lick his lips, lingering at the cupid bow.
Harriet and his mother were ‘pure’. They had never shown any symptoms of dystopia and it was why when his father died and the regime began, that John knew that he had leave his home to keep them safe. If the government discovered him there, he could not think what they would to them. So he disappeared, leaving a note. He moved on his own feet towards the ‘Lion’s Den’, bypassing the chip controls. And when, in one of his visits and wanderings through the subway tunnels, he found the base of the rebels in the old station of Mordan, practically out of the city in the Northem line, he decided that this was where he belonged.
Holmes took a pair of deep breaths before answering him.
Holmes fingers pressed some point in John’s shackles, which were electronic, introducing the opening key. With a click, the metallic plate that closed his hands fell to the ground, and John saw his opportunity.
A hand slid onto his, soft and surprisingly cold.
They both smirked, pleasant looks on both of their faces. Sherlock moved, situating himself in the warm place next to John, still encircled by his arms. He moved his legs till they were also entwined with John’s in a jumble of limbs. Sleep was slowly claiming them both, the tiredness from a long day, high emotions, and post coital joy making its presence known.
“How do I...?”
“Possibly. If the newborn had had the time and inclination to burn his remains. There are few things that can permanently kill vampires, you see. Almost anything brings us back with enough time and blood. We have  always been curious about that and until recently, we’d only found three effective ways to finish our kind: either burn us to ashes and scatter the remains or chop off our head and burn it. Without a way to provide blood to the body, it slowly rots and dies. It’s way slower than a human’s decomposition, but still. And then, there is werewolf saliva. The enzyme that changes humans is poisonous to us, and eventually lethal. It works the other way round, too. Inject a wolf with enough venom and it will die.”
He had always thought that he could be happy. That he would find the a way to avoid the dangers of the world until he could find his other half, but now that the darkness had bitten him, tearing and dragging him to the shadows, he felt as part of it. How would anyone want to love him after that, even if it were his other half? Why would anyone waste their time in piecing something that was so broken that he himself couldn't recognize? He could hear his wolf howling in the distance, expressing his pain.
When the first dishes were served, Sherlock got caught up in the delicious smell of a perfectly prepared ratatouille, just as his aunt Marie made it when he was young, so many years ago. Surprised by the quality of the food, he got lost in the taste. His memories of old times, when life was different and easier, were all Sherlock had left.
But of course, if Sherlock was good at anything, it was self discipline.
I already have a plan for Mystrade. Maybe you like the process, maybe you don’t. But the ending will be good, seriously.
“Why am I not surprised you’re not wearing pants?” His voice was shaky with laugher and desire, and he undulated his hips, searching more friction. Sherlock nearly shouted, muffling himself by biting hard on his lips till a fang managed to draw blood.
John stood up, relaxing his shoulders. Embracing the memories that would cover him to human eyes, fitting into the skin of a new identity. The glamour covering his spiritual nature to human eyes began to form. Like a spider with his web, thread by thread the spell constructed how the world would perceive him. John Watson; doctor and soldier. Wounded in battle and honorably discharged.
Sherlock had held John all the way to the Holmes Manor. Mycroft’s car had become uncomfortably quiet after John’s heart finally gave up and stopped beating. Even though he had been able to smell the changing blood inside of him, holding John while he died had been harder than he thought it would be.
“I never forgot.”
“Cocaine overdose.”
“I profoundly despise that. I apologise for the uncalled mystery. Now I shall leave you. Foreign politics are tedious compared to future magic, but duty calls. Good luck with the new riddle, brother dear.”
Wars as he had only seen at the Dark Times trapped him. So much suffering he was sure he could fix. It was not his duty or his mission. But it was his core and he couldn’t fight himself.
John held, stoically, until the following night arrived. They let him sleep attached to one of the beds in the infirmary. He still wore the leash around his neck, but there were now thick layers of bandages, separating the skin from the leather. All of him looked like a mummy, full of bandages, patches, and stitches, in the places where the blows and the cuts were too deep. He also had bluish marks throughout all of his body, which he wished not to look at. When he lay back, he felt all of the punctures that his aching body suffered. In the intimacy of the closed and solitary infirmary, he let his tears fall down. He felt dirty, broken and abandoned.
Sherlock felt dizzy as he retreated, lips crimson red and shiny under the cold lights of the safe room. His eyes were dark pools, the irises dilated, as if trying to devour all possible shades of blue. It was a sight to behold.
“You’ve made your mind up about something. You always have that look in your eyes when you do. May I ask what is it about?
“I was bored. Thought this would provide some distraction”, Sherlock said, as if he couldn’t care less about the situation. He shrugged. “Though I must say, this might be enough to capture my attention. This murder, I have not been informed of. Not that I normally pay attention to anything down there but...”
“Not much. It’s coming from Below, and its unauthorised. That’s all I can say. I felt it, too.”
“He tried to keep his store, but he found it hard to get regular blood supplies. He wasn’t skilled enough to hunt without being discovered, so he decided to leave his old life behind and move to Paris to start anew as another man. He found himself caught up in the middle of the revolution,” Sherlock smiled, as he was enjoying an inside joke.
John whistled, impressed but not surprised. “Bet you have more money than bloody England.”
“Yeah. That’s the poorest excuse I’ve heard, but let’s say I believe you and you’re not here to cause any trouble. Why now? Why not the other times?”
He ate a pair of nuts, which he opened by hitting two loose bricks hitting with each other. It was great. There were five hundred and seventy-six calories in your system for each nut. That would be enough to hold for a couple of weeks.
It was easy for Sherlock to turn himself toward a calmer, almost floating state of mind. Between the lure of the excellently played music and the smells and tastes surrounding him, he felt in near ecstasy. So few things had the capacity to shield a vampire from the grating everyday environment, and he was pleased this was one of them. Point for Mycroft.
His heart twitched. It couldn’t be, him. After all this time.
When he woke up in the morning, he told his mother that he dreamt with a wolf. She got tremendously excited, at the edge of ecstasy, as the dream brought great news with it.
In the depths of his heart, he knew his soul mate was somewhere injured but alive. And it would not let it be killed being that way. He would not cause such pain to anyone, even an unknown stranger. And as matters stood, to survive and to find your soulmate was the only available happiness that the government could not control completely.
This safe room had always been at the Holmes manor, designed for newborns and used for keeping dangerous guests at bay. Mycroft had paid for the land and supervised the house construction himself. Always the posh ass. After all these years, he’d never thought they would need to use it. Sherlock had always been insistent in thinking he needed no one by his side, that he was fine being alone.
“You brilliant... magnificent... beautiful creature...”
Greg, stunned by the spectacle, tried to get up from his chair to allow the couple some privacy. Suddenly, Irene’s message made sense. Sherlock had felt John’s clinical death as his own, and that was why Adler had called him. Probably Sherlock had experienced the pain of the loss. For a moment, he felt a strong sympathy for the lad. It wasn’t an easy process to go through. Those who were part of the Resistance knew. When Mycroft found out, he was not going to be very happy.
He could remember with clarity the first day that he had stepped into Buckingham becoming Jim’s plaything. The day that he learned that each and every one of the rumours that ran by the ‘Lion’s Den’ didn’t only reflect with cruel details what happened everyday at the other side of the river, but they fell short. The only thing that he hoarded with certain affection, was the conversation that he had with Mycroft, whom he had not seen since then, although he knew that he was fine thanks to secondary sources, such as Molly Hooper.
The vampire’s hands softly caressed John’s shoulder blades, trying to reduce the tension that had grown in them and drew a trail of kisses along John’s neck and shoulder, paying special attention to the scar tissue from John’s bullet wound.
His wings were firmly pressed against his body, both protecting him from the wind and helping him gain speed. When he saw a yellow light, floating in the middle of nowhere, he opened them slowly, controlling the fall to reach the light. When he got closer, the flame moved and he smiled. He chased the light across the darkness, knowing it would take him where he wanted to go.
“Your animal...”
As soon as Sherlock left the safe room, John found himself alone. He couldn’t hear a single thing and was pretty sure nobody could hear him either, no matter how improved the hearing of a vampire could be.
Somehow, they where.
date.”
“You don’t seem very fond of your father.”
“You knew this was meant to happen at some point. You wanted this,” Mycroft observed.
He pulled back firmly but with care, feeling his fangs out and ready. The venom glands were swollen, awaiting release. So he moved down, caressing John’s neck with his lips as he had done hundreds of times already when they were in bed. He took a deep breath, smelling the blood and the perfume of John’s skin, and caressed one sharp  point over the spot where neck meets shoulder, numbing it with saliva.
The pressure on his knee became urgent.
Perhaps he was already broken, and that had no remedy. But at least, he would be the greatest pain in the ass that James Moriarty had ever had. For as long as he could endure it.
“Not even with Mary?”
The last thing he had eaten had been a piece of bread. He gave the rest of the bread and a piece of cheddar to an orphan boy living on the streets who was now under his responsibility. He was called Wiggins, Bill Wiggins. The child had a golden eagle as his animal spirit and said that he had dreamed with a salamander.
He flashed a smile at the worker, taking out his wallet.
“Well, let’s check what’s wrong, shall we?” Mycroft asked, and the changing sounds told John he had just lifted her from the cot, or wherever she was sleeping.

“Seb, I’ll need you to attend the barricade at Embankment station. In the Bakerloo and Northern line. And if it’s necessary, make them open a gap and make Thames fall on top of them. I don’t care. Go and fix it. Now!” The man screamed, and he swore that he had seen one of his veins in his temple throb. Moran hesitated. He couldn’t let go of the leash or he could let him go. “Ugh, for the love of God and the Blessed Virgin. Give Holmes the leash and go! NOW!”
They had beans for breakfast when they finally woke up. So Sherlock decided, watching as John hummed and swayed as he cooked the beans and made some toasts, to call Mycroft, in hopes that he had a new prophecy for him.
“As long as you’ll let me.”
They were lucky, nonetheless. Last prophet they had in the London coven got so out of control he was talking nothing but nonsense by the time his hair began to grey, and ended up being called Godfrey The Nutter. Mycroft had a better grip on his magic, even if he seemed to still be limited by the prophecies counter magic. Sherlock did not mind the riddles, as long as his older brother kept a comprehensive communication the rest of the time.
He was so fierce, Sherlock felt his throat tighten.
,” Sherlock shot back, trying to look pissed, but suppressing a smile. “Unknown science is called magic because idiots can’t be bothered to understand how it works.”
“Congratulations Sherlock. You’ve become dystopian.”
They had probably just found a way to get rid of him for a while. A useless Archangel was as good as a cherubin.
Apparently, he made his workers call him Jim. "I was in the lobby of Buckingham. He seemed ... pleasant.
“We’re going to put those bastards in the place that they deserve!”
“Wait.” John stopped dead in his tracks, perplexed. “You ‘got terribly rich during your pirate days’?”
Sherlock found John’s eyes, the calmness in his body hid the distress in his eyes. He couldn’t move, there was no way out. He tried to reassure him, but he wasn’t seeing an easy way out. He moved to fast, John died. He moved too slow, John died.
Hello beabs! I'm back!
He activated his senses all that he was capable of. Then he closed his eyes and concentrated in what he could perceive, cataloguing it in a way that made sense. Definitively, he was in a hospital. The beeping was rhythmic, steady. It had accelerated for a few moments, and then the beat began to slow down. Which this meant, in this case, was: hospital. Definitively.
The pure ones seemed to believe that after the death of one of the dystopics, the spiritual creatures would abandon them. But it was not like that. Being intimately connected with their human, the avatars reflected their state and reacted to it. In the beginning it had been believed that these manifestations came from some kind of chemical anomaly, but they were help. A compass. It was a way to find your other half. So it could be said that the existence of the dystopic avatars was purely technical. Once the couple met, they disappeared. It was not known what happened to them once the meeting was established. And while the animal of the deceased disappeared completely, the one of the survivor was tied to its carrier, linked to life, continuing with a search that would never have an end.
The maître d’ checked the list and smiled back.
Something to review later, Sherlock thought. Better not to give away his cards too soon.
And if it were not because there was someone out there still waiting for him, holding on, he would have let himself die. He knew that for Mycroft everything would be much easier if he didn't have to worry when thinking about someone discovering that Sherlock was alive. Maybe he could make the report in Scotland Yard on his supposed overdose a reality. It would be the cleanest and most logical solution. However, if Sherlock hadn't known that there was someone that was looking after him, tolerating his pain without him knowing about them and that they were probably as or more fucked up than him, he would have done it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned, eyes sharp when he heard John’s ice-calm voice. He was aware, suddenly, of the beating of two hearts. Stupid, so stupid.
“I swam.”
Sherlock chuckled.
He felt Moran's hand taking his arm with a considerable force, shaking him up to get him on his feet. He hissed when he felt the pain of the blows right where Moran was holding him. Slowly rising, he felt the tightness of the chains. Something brushed past his neck, hard and cold, tightening itself up until it made his breathing labored. The tension in his legs disappeared with a metallic clatter, and he did not flee because of the leg cramps, he felt them loose from spending so much time with them unused. He had to use all his willpower in order to prevent himself from trying to make an escape attempt. It would not do any good for him.
Last time he had bothered to walk among humans, it had been very, very different. Big cities weren’t as such, and there wasn’t so much technology. Humans had still killed each other with swords and shields, and kept simple lives. He had to admit, though, that all of this advances made life seem a little bit more… fun. He might stick around for a while this time.
Jim sighed dramatically.
Shinny, polished shoes appeared in his field of vision and he felt the electric presence behind him when the man crouched next to him.
The maître d’s voice was soft and cordial when they got to the entrance of the main salon, a touch of French in his accent. “Good evening, sirs. Do you have reservations?”
at home while going to get food to the clean side of the city, for security reasons. But, when he stepped on Blackfriars Bridge he had to turn around, he was in agony. There was such intense physical pain that he could not imagine the ordeal that his brother was passing with the kilometers that were separating him from London to Baskerville.
In his sleep, it seemed something completely logical. When he talked, the oxygen mask that he was wearing fogged up.
“I was. Right until a Spanish vessel ambushed us. We were near the Portuguese coast, low on supplies and taking rest. By the time we got the canons and the men ready to answer,
“Perks of being immortal and good at predicting the economy,” he said, a smirk on his face. “Plus, I was terribly rich during my pirate days. Most of the gold was later invested in estates and properties around the world. I might not be as obsessed with money as my brother, but I’m no fool. I like nice things.”
. A weight that heavy would have done some major damage, like a heavy stone to a human’s body. I was confident of my estimation of your physical status considering your human potential,” Sherlock explained, finally guiding his eyes back to John’s. He held his arm in his direction, waiting for John to toss him the weight. Sherlock caught it in the air, both arms showing the muscles straining  under his shirt.
Sometimes they were good. Other times, Sherlock thought Mycroft was being bothersome, with deliberately ridiculous prophecies he couldn’t solve.
Sherlock held a chuckle.
could fly away. The good thing of the animals spirit was that they could be mistaken for the real ones if they were seen from afar, so a dystopian who had relatively common animal had more chances to go unnoticed that someone who, like his brother, exhibited a Chinese dragon.
He saw how the leash changed hands rapidly, and Moran running towards the lift, with his tiger trailing behind him.
PS: Did anyone get the joke on the chapter’s name? XD It just happened, I swear.
Normally, he wouldn’t approach the ground in his dreams. There was nothing interesting down there, but that time it was different. He felt an immense curiosity about the wolf; he knew it was important, although he couldn’t remember why.
More than once, Sherlock had tried to pry him what they had sent him to do while he was there. What would anyone not want from a political science student with great deductive skills? Mycroft, with a glass of cheap alcohol in hand and with a lost look, took a few minutes to answer. "No, Sherlock. I do not want to remember."
He took John’s forgotten erection in one hand, stroking in time with the movement of their hips as the doctor started moving against him, too. John’s answering moan was loudest in that moment, and accompanied a bunch of incomprehensible talk that, Sherlock guessed, was all praise.
They sat at the sofa in front of the fireplace, cuddled together. Sherlock was curled on John’s lap, his long legs all over the place. John was massaging Sherlock’s skull gently with his fingers, curling them around his locks of soft raven hair. It was so soothing to hear the detective’s slow breathing. He smelled of a mixture of tobacco, ash, and a faint trace of sweat. It was something familiar to John. Something that not only hadn’t changed, but had intensified. His enhanced senses now allowed him to distinguish even more details, and he discovered he could detect scent trails now. Rosie would have a hard time in the future playing hide and seek.
He wished he would have listened to Sally’s words.
“It’s not your problem.”
They should have left the chasing to the Yard.
“I’m sorry. They’re orders.”
“My pleasure,” he answered, dropping a soft kiss on Sherlock jaw. “I think I could get used to this.”
John was about to miracle time so he could reveal himself without alerting humans, when he heard a familiar voice.
He had been tracking what he thought was the last hours of the boy. A chinese restaurant first, in which he assumed he had had dinner. Having a natural heavenly gift to speak fluently in any language of the earth was always convenient. They weren’t affected by mortal limitations, so their communication skills were absolutely perfect. They were, however, naturally limited in vocabulary. It took skill and knowledge to be able to extract some useful information from humans in regard to more heavenly matters. Mostly because, as they neither understood nor saw or contacted the supernatural, they had incorrect, they had inaccurate words for concepts very familiar and basic to angels.
“One of my assistants told me the children saw an Archangel on Earth. I just thought it would be entertainment enough to see what was going on. It’s not everyday one can see this. I would have never imagined it was you.”
Sherlock sighed, defeated, and closed his eyes. He would have to watch after
Sherlock moved his hands, forgetting his trousers, and grabbed John’s butt, pushing him upwards, closer to his face. John groaned and obeyed, moving himself till his clothed crotch was mere centimetres from Sherlock’s mouth. The vampire sucked in a breath and pressed his face against John, taking a deep sniff. John’s voice made a loud, high-pitched sound, and then Sherlock lapped over the straining curve of his trapped erection.
“I took your pulse”.
“We didn't take it off you... We didn't exactly know what you wanted to do...” he cleared his throat, uncomfortable. The questions that they had John answer were the rigorous ones; nothing had been out of the ordinary. But a few of the questions had simply been too... intimate, and hearing their answers was somewhat uncomfortable, as John was a friend of his and not a stranger.
John did felt himself naked when the people that they were passing by looked at him, still being pulled by the leash. Some with compassion and understanding. Others dryly. There were many that were mocking. Ethan was among them. When he arrived at the infirmary, Molly Hooper attended him, carefully and delicately. They had made her come from St. Bart’s in order to attend him, and it seemed that it wasn’t the first time that someone was in the same state as him.
He heard the tiger growl and saw how Garm looked at him, waiting for him to say something. He shook his head and the wolf sat on its hind legs, very close to him, without stopping to watch at the tiger and its dystopian occasionally.
intense: his forearms, biceps, and legs, with extra special attention being paid to his hands and inner thighs. John had to admit, it was beginning to look like any second Sherlock was going to jump him and fuck him right there over the nearest workout machine. And by the looks of it, it might be the best sex of his life. He felt his suddenly interested cock give a tiny pulse, , and he shifted his weight from one foot to another, trying to find a place to put down the weight disc as a distraction.
To both Sherlock and John’s surprise, they found Mycroft talking with a very relaxed Rosie sitting in his lap. The baby was holding his tie softly with her hands, looking at him with a mesmerised expression on her sweet face. Mycroft was telling her some kind of story, but not any average children’s story like
He had held the hands of men and women as they died, as their souls abandoned their bodies. He had seen the compassion at the darkest of times, the kindness of people ready to kill, their hopes and dreams for a final peace. The loyalty of their hearts. The courage.
me. You lie to me again and again, and I’m tired of all of this. So very tired! All I want, all I ask for, is a little bit of rest. And even that is denied to me!”
They were about to find out.
Then he walked out a clear destination in mind. There was only one place to start his journey. The reports his brothers and sisters had gathered while he was convalescent were very clear were he should look first.
The animalistic sound of pleasure echoed through the room and a shiver ran down Sherlock’s body. He pressed his mouth closed, jaw rigid, and felt his cock fill and harden. It was taking every ounce of self control he had not to take himself in hand and fuck his fist in time with John’s swallows till he came. He knew it was not the moment for that, and it might cause John a distraction when they could not afford any. So he kept himself still, hands fisted against his thighs, and watched John drink.
“Oh really? Please do.”
. I can lift a car. To a certain extent.
“My John.”
But then, there was John’s smell. So intoxicatingly
“He did. I tried… to stop him. Several times, but it was useless to argue with him. He had Asperger syndrome”, he added. The car started when the light turned green, and they set off towards Buckingham through the now cleared streets. “His name was Sherlock.”
Did sex count as human sacrifice?
Mycroft, thank god, had been silent all the way. Even when they finally reached their destination, he had only commented that the secure room was ready for John and that he would take care of everything while Sherlock stayed with John.
Still, a high was worth it if it lead to this, to John as alive as he could be, with him.
He had already spent hours attending Lestrade’s psychological tests, when John was finally allowed to talk to him without having a doctor measuring his emotional answers based on his heart beat and his physical reactions to the question. He had to admit that he had become a very good liar after all those years he had served Jim. He had only lied twice when the questions became a bit too private. And they were not even lies, just ambiguous answers. There were things that people didn’t have to know.
Sherlock was lying boneless on the sofa, absolutely spent and satiated after the kitchen sex and the (reheated) breakfast. Still enjoying the thrill of another case closed, and not yet ready to start looking for another one. John had left a couple of minutes ago to get some groceries, and so Sherlock decided it was a good moment to call Mycroft.
The nurse passed by without answering, and stood in front of the machines, reading his vital signs, writing down the results in a clipboard. He swore he saw copper hair tied up in high ponytail. He repeated the name, and felt the warmth of his wolf leave him when she approached him to change the IV drip.
He looked up and saw, on the corner at the end of the alley, a CCTV camera pointing right at them. Bless controlling brothers with power complexes.
he died.
Mycroft rebound the collar to the strap and closed his hands between the electronic shackles. John looked at him, surprised by the new replacement.
“Why are you doing this?” He said, sounding weary, almost pained.
Our Baker Street vamps will come back, as this is becoming a series!
Something ignited inside him, a very different kind of flame. With a defeated growl, he moved the hand holding Morning Star’s neck to the abundance of curls at the nape and pulled. He swallowed the moan coming from those lips with his own, skin itching everywhere the demon pressed against him. The legs around him reinforced their grip, hips indulging and pressing against his. John felt the pressure of a hardening desire against his inner thigh and moaned. The flesh remembered, knew what was happening. Desires and feelings he thought lost were coming back again, the mortal memories of John Watson filling the gaps at his own records. Cold hands covered his cheeks, nails scratching the beard as they went. Firm hands held his face in place and pulled him close as the kiss deepened, gasps and muttered words in ancient tongues were whispered against moving lips.
“So, no fire. Got it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you,” he replied. He really felt it. His body had grown accustomed to the lack of food (largely thanks to the use of narcotic substances, moving freely in the Lions Den).
John’s hand squeezed Sherlock’s for a second before leading the way. The ceiling was covered in white, cold light lamps. They were small, like stars hanging from the intricate structure created by branches full of blooms and white flowers. The room’s illumination was soft, supported by a glass lantern in the centre of the ceiling almost covered by the natural decorations, just enough to avoid direct light to penetrate in the area, and helping create an almost dream-like ambiance.It looked intimate, all tables placed to offer maximum privacy in the small room. There was a stone fireplace, the flames providing both dim light and comfortable heat.
Sherlock, on the other hand, began to lose his breath, immersed in his own spiral until, he learned later, he lost consciousness in Irene's arms.
Sherlock blinked.
He thought of the black raven, in it pale eyes looking at him with sadness and helplessness. How it had stayed with him after nearly breaking its beak trying to help him escape. How it had flown down for him, despite the danger it was facing...
“Yes.”
“How do I look?”
I promised to be good.
“Not that I dislike it. God, no. That was the sexiest and most satisfying sex I’ve had in... well, my life.”
Sherlock, who had been looking at John’s arms with delight and abandon, began to let his eyes wander over the rest of John’s body. It was clear to him which parts of his thorough examination became
The Chinese restaurant owner, a lovely, kind woman, told him he had seen the boy walk in late that night. After having some noodles, he had left, as if in a hurry. She had not called the police because she thought he might be worried of getting back home late. She told him Jordan looked like a nice kid. Not problematic at all.
Now it was John’s turn to blink, surprised.
John’s stomach contracted. He had been perfectly calm all day. The evening had been a wonderful time, cuddling Sherlock on  the sofa by the flames. They had been talking almost nonstop about Sherlock’s past. Now that there was no need to hide anything, John was eager to know everything Sherlock had lived to see, everything he’d gotten to experience.
“I’ll drink to that,” he said, finishing the remains of his wine. Then he toyed with the glass, spinning it slowly between his fingers. “I didn't want to lose more time, to be honest. We’ve been circling around each other long enough, and I... I love you, Sherlock. I’m a little scared because I’ve never felt this way, but it’s the truth.”
The suspect on the floor was still getting rid of the effects of the drugs Mycroft’s men had injected him with, the strong odour of chemicals beginning to fade away from his blood. Being a thirsty newborn, John would have no problem drinking contaminated blood. His change hormones were still active and would take care of any foreign bodies inside the ingested fluids.
The suspect sneered, pressing harder with the knife, judging by John’s pained expression and the increasing smell of blood. It was becoming harder for Sherlock to stay calm.
“You missed a spot, genius.”
He was in a room, dark stone walls covered in all kinds of weapons. Red dots of light decorated the cave, full of cushions and other elements. Almost closing his eyes, Sherlock growled low, making a face of discomfort. The Second Circle it was, then.
Gasping, furious, he fought the urge screaming inside of him to go fetch the human scum and shake him like a rag doll till his brains were crushed inside his skull.
“Wait, Sherlock. Are your parents vampires, too?”
He followed Sherlock down,  his opinions about Pirate Sherlock  pushed away by curiosity. The walls were humid, made of old, grey stone shining with water in some places. It smelled like a river. He heard... running water? Could it be?
“I’m John, by the way."
“They must be out of ideas, then. But I guess even God Itself must get bored from time to time. Imagine being only able to watch the same stupid
“Great observation, Captain. I hope, sincerely, that we don’t see each other again.”
“Instinct. Just let go.”
Sherlock realized he was staring too much when John’s smile turned cheeky, and he fought the blush rising on his face.
Still, regardless of how strong his resolution was, memories of old times kept popping up whenever they saw fit. At some point, he decided that trying to avoid them was too much of an effort, and desisted altogether. Putting his coat on, he left the bedsit at the first light of morning.
Composing himself into an indifferent, stony expression, Sherlock looked her in the eyes, eyebrow rising. The flame at the top of his head licked at his horns before moving towards the succubus’ face. She flinched, hissing in pain.
“Are you nuts, mate? Your friend ‘ere has a bloody gun,” the suspect spat, moving to adjust his grip on John. He looked desperate. Desperate people were not fun. “I’m not giving him a chance.”
was a very nice place, indeed. It had a floral and lovely Covent Garden atmosphere everywhere. And whoever choose the floral arrangements at the door and the reception area had exquisite taste. Not only were the colours and combinations extremely accurate, but the cacophony of scents was tremendously pleasant, strong, but not invasive, which was quite unusual for a vampire to find, he had to admit. Maybe Mycroft had something to say in the restaurant choice. His brother loved a nice meal in a fancy place like a cow loves grass. It just came with the package, he supposed.
“So. Five hundred years? Does that make you young?” he teased, a smile slowly forming at his lips. “What you told me that night, back at the restaurant. Was it true? Are you French?”
When everything finished, Moran entered and made a wobbly John get dressed with the white clothes which he had arrived in, and took him to the infirmary, John understood why they used such white linen.
an Archangel. He ate these kinds of small mercies for breakfast. He was more accustomed to heavier jobs: healing deadly wounded soldiers in the field, creating armistices in the middle of a war for Christmas. Preventing wars from starting just by changing the most minor detail in  some human’s destiny.
“You look brilliant.”
She had been a good mother. She did not deserve to die alone like that.
Now he frowned.
His tone sounded bored already, more like the Sherlock John was accustomed to. It made him smile, taking with it a bit of the dark feeling that had installed itself inside him since their conversation took a dark path. He saw Sherlock twist around for a second at the other side of the room, and then something dark flew directly toward his stomach. Out of instinct, he flinched and caught the object with one hand, noticing its  pressure and weight. It was no heavier than one of Rosie’s toys to him, even for the size of it.
Even with the soft music playing and the previous sense of calm, there was something dark and sad in the air between them now. It always was there when they talked about the time Sherlock was away. He looked at John with reassurance and pressed the side of his foot to John’s hoping it would offer some comfort.
His mate’s voice was low and came out nearly as a growl. Sherlock bit his lip, resisting the urge to grab John’s remaining clothes and rip them off. He liked how he looked in them too much.
“The people you saw at Christmas are fae. Forests spirits. They helped me once, when I was still young and reckless. Since then, they’ve been acting as our parents. They are linked to the forest near the house and will continue living as long as the forest does. We secured a great part of the land to prevent its destruction.”
So this is not a goodbye, but a 'see you later'. For now, I'm going to shamelessly self promote my current angel!lock, Celestial Tides. As soon as I finish with it, I'll retake the vampires ;)
Sherlock turned after hanging the fire poker back at its hang, and he froze when he saw John, looking at him from underneath the door’s lintel, like a wet dog. He suddenly became aware of the smell of water, humid ground and algae that had been masked by the fireplace. He also saw the shinny, argentine silhouette of a large, elegant object he would be able to recognise anywhere.
So for a dystopian, to know if you live or die one more day had turned into a lottery.
The door to apartment A opened with a bang and a splash of water, but no sound came from within. The lake smell was even stronger now. John hurried inside as the water level rose, frantically looking for both the origin of the water and the old landlady.
“There you are. See? It’s not so bad. Calm down, or you’ll have cramps when you rise,” he advised, when John started sucking gluttonously, blood nearly dripping out of his mouth.
A song that would have made any star cry.
The violins finished the song they were playing and the cello began low, lulling tones before the piano joined in. John laughed, raising his glass.
“We should get cleaned before we end up stuck together for eternity,” John commented. Sherlock growled, making no move to leave the bed or the position he was in, and his mate laughed.
“My Lord, we have important newsss from the Above.”
“I would give you forever.”
Sherlock started using a scissoring movement, making sure the muscle was relaxed enough and then he took them out, to John’s great annoyance.
Having been on Earth for that long, John had had time to get used to that. Perhaps that was why he had been chosen for this mission.
Oh. So I’m Helel again, Sherlock thought, a pang of deception and hurt inside of him.
John sniffed before securing the gun in the back of his trousers, covering it with the end of his jumper. “
John frowned, looking at the demon with fire in his eyes.
The streets were crowded  and noisy. It had been a while since the last time he mingled with humans. Breaking the seal of his prison and climbing up the several circles Hell had been designed with took him ages. More than he thought it would. True, he had spent most of its time with nothing to do except think about what had happened over and over again. He had been alone, but alone was fine by him. It had been a long time ago. He had been young, restless too proud. Now, he had accepted the cards he had been dealt. For defying a superior, he had been casted out mercilessly.
He followed the trail, unsure of what he would find, but ready to face it. His hands itched, as if getting ready to summon his shields. He hadn’t had a fight with a demon for a very long time. Things could get very interesting in a short time. The scar at his shoulder burned in remembrance, as if expressing it’s discomfort.
Sherlock had collapsed somewhere along the road in the ambulance, writhing and choking out a scream. Irene tried to hold him to keep him still.
When John began opening his shirt, kissing every new inch of skin till he finally reached one of his nipples, Sherlock found himself glad he had gotten rid of all of the spy cameras Mycroft had installed in the flat when John moved in. It would be highly embarrassing to find out some of his brother’s minions checked over this.
John licked his lower lip slowly, deliberating.
He extended his hand.
Amazed incredulity installed itself in John’s stomach, twisting his guts.
John shuddered for a moment. He had allowed himself some humanity since he had woken in the hospital, knowing he was safer there than anywhere else in the world, and discovered that he felt strange among so many people. It seemed that after so much time outside of the ordinary life, he had lost all of the practice or custom that he could have with respect to the social relations in general, and the human contact.
“Be it done to me according to thy word” he said, surprised at feeling the fire burn inside him, readying to answer the call. As it had always done.
The fire receded and the glow returned to his body as he calmed. He now looked like a pissed of short man. He saw Morning St… Sherlock look at him as if he was the answer to all secrets, and the questions to some more. It was a look he had once been used to, now it only left him with sadness and bittersweet memories.
John coughed.
"Today, a child arrived at the department," Sherlock swallowed, without an appetite. Through his head flew the image of little Bill Wiggins and everything fell into place. Mycroft wouldn't have drawn that type of topic so unless it was important. He closed his eyes, not wanting to deduct anything else from his brother, no more than he had done. He did not want to hear it. He left the crust of bread left for him to eat on top of the plate in disgust. He did not realize that his hands were shaking until Mycroft grabbed them above the table. He fought the urge to be revealed and remove them from his brothers’ grip. "Did he suffer?"
Then he buried his teeth into John’s skin.
John blinked. Overwhelmed by the information, he looked down at his own hands as if they held all the answers to the unspoken questions currently flooding his head in no order whatsoever. Looking at the blue veins at his wrists, he frowned.
A large crow, black and with bright eyes landed on his arm, it looked as physical as if it were real, albeit with a slight translucent tint. Sherlock reached into the room and closed the window again. The animal let out a squawk, leaving something with the beak on Sherlock's outstretched hand.
The beeping accelerated when that occurred and he turned his head, enough to see a nurse approaching his room. When she entered, he could see her card from the
They held hands waiting for a taxi outside the restaurant’s door, standing as close as they could to each other. The ride to Baker Street was much the same, both sitting close, hands still held tightly, and both whispering softly in the back.
A few minutes after getting into the ambulance, while he was talking with Adler to try and stay distracted, he felt a searing pain that pierced right through him. He began to feel dizzy, losing his breath and he felt himself fall, even though he was sitting down. He reached out and clung tightly to Irene, seeing stars blinking behind his eyes. He placed his other hand to his chest.
” he growled. John, lost in a cloud of lust and hunger, growled back, frustrated and furious. His eyes were black pools, dark and deep as the ocean.
“I’ll try not to be offended by that,” John answered back, feeling nothing near offence. He was mostly flattered. It’s wasn’t often one  made Sherlock Holmes horny like a teenager from only catching things in midair. John was going to enjoy every second of it.
He had to admit changing nappies was not his number one favourite activity.
He pulled off his new sweater, throwing it over his head, and flexed his naked arms to stretch the muscles. The weird feeling of numbness he had felt upon waking, although it was already disappearing, was still making itself known. It was a  sensation between pain and stiffness, similar to having sore muscles. . Stretching made his body activate.
“So you really were trying to date me, then? You looked so confused.”
And it hurt.
“For how long have you been working for him?”
Greg saw as he raised his hand to the collar, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. One didn't need to have a doctorate to know what that meant, let alone knowing where John came from.
“I’m surprised you know what
John arched an eyebrow, humming in approval. “Were you really a pirate?”
“John, please, I... You’re losing too much blood...”
“Can you blame me? You did something unforgivable, Helel. My feelings about any of this are not relevant.”
Sherlock let out a loud moan when John bit down on his shoulder, fingers keeping him in place. Sherlock felt his legs wobble, John’s teeth inadvertently pressing over the spot meant for mates to exchange blood. It was hard not to rest a hand behind John’s head to keep him there and encourage him to bite.
“So, hate it is.”
“It’s fine.”
His hands were still bound by the shackles, so he closed them into fists, digging his nails into his palm.
, I might be able to raise it a few inches from the ground, provided no one was looking and the car was empty. But I wouldn’t last long. Do you also want to know if I can lift a bus? We can test all kinds of vehicles. A motorcycle should be easy enough to grab and throw against...”
He was now looking at him like a hungry man would look at a piece of steak (granted, one that almost succeeded at killing them) after being hungry for months.
As they hadn’t been very rich, he had just a few things he cared enough about to keep over the years: some paintings from his mother’s family, his mother’s only necklace, and his father’s hunting knife. The rest had either gone to Mycroft or was lost. He had sometimes tried to cook some of the old recipes he remembered by taste and smell, taking the internet instructions as a starting point. But it didn’t matter how much he tried, or how many different recipes he followed, the food simply wasn’t the same. This restaurant was one of the few places where he had been able to go back to those times again.
