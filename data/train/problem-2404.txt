Everything Dean said was true. Castiel was a villain in Dean’s life right now. And until he knew how to remedy that, that’s what Castiel would be stuck as.
He rolled his leg around under the covers and definitely felt something that didn’t belong. He pulled the covers back and noticed he was now branded with an ankle monitor.
He gave a smug expression that Castiel wanted to punch and he made his way to the main sitting den after hanging up his coat.
“Merry Christmas, Winchesters!” Missouri greeted. “Either you two had a gorgeous baby with one hell of a growth spurt, or this must be your brother.”
“I’m terribly sorry,-” he apologized as he shifted his gaze to the person he just assaulted, and was surprised to see a familiar pair of beautiful blue eyes starting back at him.
He took Dean’s partially drunken wine glass and poured the remnants into his. The light hit the glass in a way where Cas could see the film left behind from Dean’s lips. The last thing Dean’s lips in this apartment were this glass, and not him.
They drove in silence mostly, not bothering with the “how are you’s, how’ve you been” given the situation. Sam knew that Dean likely just wanted some peace and quiet.
Gabriel looked at him curiously, also deducing whether or not he could or should divulge any personal information about his life. “In my twenties,” he replied. “San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans, New York of course. Ironically, not DC.”
“It’s not too late,” Dean said. “You can take a nap in the corner, I ain’t going anywhere,” Dean replied.
“I see,” Castiel said. “I’ve been to Denver twice I believe. The mountain scapes are quite beautiful.”
“Well, thank you, Karen,” Jessica said. “But it would make for a cute story.” She looked at Dean with a. Hopeful smile and he rolled her eyes. He was happy nobody pushed on the issue more. All in all, it was a more positive Thanksgiving than Dean had anticipated. He looked around at Bobby, Karen, Jess. Jo even joined them after a while. He wondered what Castiel and his family was doing, if he had any family to share it with. He hoped that he did, and he hoped he would see Cas soon.
They drove through the night until Castiel found a motel for them to crash at. Castiel had numerous untraceable credit cards that shouldn’t be flagged by the FBI. Dean had confirmed they didn’t know anything about his financial accounts.
Bobby must have noticed her fleeting eyes because that’s what he’s trained to do, pick up on body languages. “Are you handling yourself alright? Do we have a lead on Dean?”
“We’re so different, though. Like you said, I’ve been through hell. He’s from that rich Novak family,” Dean argued. “He’s going to see I’m not worth much.”
She chuckled back. “I know it’s hard out there. I didn’t mean to put pressure on you. I mostly just want another reason to see you. Sooner rather than later, preferably.”
Castiel let out an amused chuckle. He technically hadn’t returned the fellatio last night, although he did eat Dean out, but it wasn’t the same. Dean was so sleepy right now. If he wasn’t stimulated, he would surely fall right back asleep.
Dean let out a heavy sigh, he was so emotionally exhausted right now, he couldn’t think about returning to work. It was a slow day, he wasn’t really needed at the auto shop. He took out his phone and called Bobby.
Dean wondered what Castiel’s recommendations meant to him. Was it just an innate part of his job? Did he choose random ones, or were the choices more? Was Castiel looking to make a connection with his customers, Dean specifically, or is he not expecting any at all?
Zachary set him up. Cas said the fixer was in favor of Dean dying. Zachary wasn’t here to free Dean. His heart began to race. Zachary was a high up fed. He had access to so much information. Information that set him up ahead, information to bury. If he was a fixer, he was probably sabotaging other cases for
Dean microwaved a breakfast sandwich and filled up his travel cap with coffee so he could have breakfast to-go. He also picked up his book again, which Sam definitely noticed. He gave a sly smile and proceeded to eat his own breakfast. Dean wrapped his hot sandwich up in napkins and quickly made his way out the door. “Seeya, Samm!” Dean exclaimed as he dashed.
Dean shrugged and took a swig of his beer. “I just need more time. My life and expectations were very uprooted a month ago. I was expecting to still be in Denver with a fiancée and step-son. I’ve got a lot to cope with.”
“Okay,” Dean replied. “I’ll see you tonight.” He was sincere. Whether he called it quits or stayed, he wanted to make a decision by tonight. He just knew he wanted to make it in peace, and without the interference of Sam, Jess, or Charlie.
Jess cheered loudly, obnoxiously so, reminding Dean that he was making out with his sexy librarian boyfriend right in front of his brother, his sister-in-law, and a florist he’s known for seven minutes, tops.
About twenty-five minutes passed, and the front door opened. A blonde man in a powder blue suit jacket, pink dress shirt, and formal pants entered the loft, escorted by a guard. The guard shut the door behind the prostitute, and the man made his way into the living room to greet his client.
“I don’t want to hear it, Cas,” Dean interrupted. “You can atone all your life if you need to, but we deserve
He wished he could have held Castiel longer. He wished Castiel had been happier. He wished Castiel wasn’t a mobster. It seemed Castiel wished he wasn’t a mobster as well, if Dean could believe it. He thinks he
Dean laughed lightly and gave his daughter a big smile. “You’d be a great movie star, darling. How about you, Jack, any ideas?”
Dean was given permission to contact Sam, although Jo had already been authorized to inform Sam that contact with Dean was made the other day and he was alive and well.
“Are you absolutely sure? You never to feel bad about hurting the other person’s feelings or feel pressured to allow it to continue,” Dean reiterated. Jack responded by initiating a new hug with Dean and Dean smiled, hugging his son back. “Aww, thank you buddy. But remember, you can say no to hugs at anytime!”
,” he emphasized, taking the attention away from himself. “Is this your favorite? Is this why you had me read it? Because it’s good. Do you have more stuff of this James Morningstar guy?”
He set the phone on the edge of the bed behind him and started to remove his own suit and tie so Cas could see their marks in comparison.
“Shit, I- I don’t know. It varies by country. Russia may decide they want him to be kept and tried here if we don’t have enough information to validate there are enough US-based crimes to try him with us,” Dean said. “Maybe at least a week starting with when and if they choose to go that route.”
When Thursday rolled around and it. Was time to take his hour long lunch, Dean drove off around the block to Castiel’s library. He carried his two completed books inside and made his way to the front desk and rung the service bell.
He decided he would take a shower first. He would have freshly cleaned hair, unwrinkled clothing, a spritz of cologne. It was just to kill time, make Dean anticipate. It had nothing to do with wanting to impress the man, he told himself.
“It’s a bee tie,” he said happily as he showed the room. “Bees are my favorite animals. I’m working on a proposal to add beehives to the community garden by this summer, and then the town can have fresh organic artisan honey as a souvenir.”
They made their way inside, and it looked almost the same, but Ellen and Jo had every table decorated with covers, centerpieces, and autumnal wreaths.
“You should believe it. You weren’t the only one that was trying to find their way back to us. I guess I just didn’t try as hard because I wasn’t so sure if you felt the same,” he replied. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“ENOUGH of that shit!” Bobby rudely interrupted. “If I could roll over there quicker than five seconds, I’d slap you for saying those rude lies about
getting involved with the US directly. As far as they could tell, none of his sales have impacted the US directly, and only minor foreign events like gang wars or heists occurred using weapons Novak provided.
After dinner, Cas and jack played videogames while Dean played with Claire. They tucked in the kids and made their way to their own bedroom.
“Nobody wants to deal with Gabriel literally ever,” Anan retorted. “But we do it because we are a family. A very suffocating, cancerous family.”
going to be in this town for a while, he should try to make some friends as be social. And if that included a potentially gay librarian he might have a small crush on, Dean would find a way to make it work.
Jess looked over at Sam nervously and Sam just gently shook his head. Dean’s smile grew wide as Jess turned slightly red. “We are having a baby!”
“Are you ready to see?” Dean asked, reaching behind him, trying to find where he set the phone without turning around too soon for Castiel.
Dean had a surprised expression, and Cas wasn’t sure how to take it. “Is that a Russia thing or a crime lord thing?”
“I don’t know about that,” Missouri said flatly, surprising Dean. She had just made it seem like his cause was just and she was on his side. Her eyes shifted slightly behind Dean. “Does he need one of my bouquets, Castiel?”
Jack finally trudged in a few moments later, looking less cheerful than Claire, but Jack was always a little moodier. “There’s my buddy!”
They arrived at the Novak family mansion promptly at six, as was expected. Four of their siblings moved out of Angel City, and the rest stayed behind and lived in the family home. Anna and Castiel were the only ones who decided they wanted a little space and got their own places.
Dean sipped on his coffee and he thought about the attractive man that was leaving. He was sure there’d be nobody in town on Grindr. He quickly shook the thought out of his head, he wasn’t ready to jump into anything yet. He could be single and celibate for a while. There was too much to focus on, plus, it would be highly inconsiderate bringing guys or girls back to Sam and Jessica’s house.
Ellen appeared like she was suppressing a smile. “I’m not sure,” she replied, but Dean wasn’t sure if he believed her tone. “You’ll have to ask Jo when she gets here.”
Dean used to enjoy walks throughout the neighborhood. It made him really feel like a part of the community, how foolish he had been. These houses were too large for Dean to afford on his own. Even if he stayed in this town, he’d likely have a small apartment downtown.
“I wasn’t aware how hard you struggled. You’ve only made comments in passing. What got you through it?” Dean asked.
She scoffed with a smile as she sat up and took Castiel’s hand, rushing him over to the vanity so they could stand side by side in the reflection. His skin was pale, untouched; and her neck and arms were heavily decorated with crests, creeds, and powerful imagery. All the members of his family, save for him, were heavily inked as part of the family mafia aesthetic.
“Fuck,” Dean muttered as Cas took him in his mouth. He should definitely be waking up now. Castiel continued to work his mouth up and down Dean’s cock, enjoying the little sounds Dean was making. It wasn’t too long before Dean was finishing in Castiel’s hand.
“Cas-” Dean said softly in surprise. Castiel just called him his soulmate. Cas just confessed that he had feelings for Dean, the same feelings he himself was harboring. “All I’ve done every day since I got my mark was hope that I’d see you again, and there’s nothing I’ve ever wanted more than your mark to match mine.”
Castiel came back a few hours later with some cases and began setting up an intricate computer set up and a hardwire phone. They were preparing to make an untraceable call. Cas was really going to exchange the trade.
What would Dean have thought about his bed? Would it have soft and sensual to spend hours with mixed limbs, combined bodies, rolling each other over all night? Would he have slept comfortably in it to wake up softly with Castiel in the mornings in each other’s arms, too comfortable to leave?
Castiel went to grab Dean’s left hand with his right, and their fingers entwined together as Dean kissed his collar.
“Of course,” Ellen replied. “There’s no place like home. I know you had a lot of them, but I had hoped this one was different.”
Cas let out a smile as he pet Dean’s hair. “Sadly I don’t think we’ll get to avoid it. Just know that I’d wish I had met you under better circumstances. I wish I could have met you before I became this man. If I had you to love me through the pain, I’d never have needed to go down this road.”
“Thank you, Karen,” Rowena accepted. “The townspeople work so hard to make it all come together. I do think this year’s will be truly special.”
Castiel’s smile broke through his morose and anxious demeanor. He turned away from Dean, and back the steering wheel. He wasn’t sure if he’d get used to feeling this vulnerable. He felt Dean’s hand grip his thigh in a comforting way.
“Please don’t lie about that,” Castiel said. “You don’t have to tell me why you don’t want to go with me, but please don’t-”
It felt as if he was blood was freezing solid and ice was coursing through his body, the kind that was cold it made your skin feel like it was being burnt off. He let out a loud scream as the searing pain spread to his face and chest. His brain, his throat, and his lungs were all experiencing the harshest chemical pain he ever fathomed.
His brother gave him a tight hug once he was within grasp. “It’s good to see you, Dean,” Sam sympathetically said before letting go.
He made his way to the large work station in the center of the wall. Under the light was a singular book sandwiched between two book ends holding it upright, surrounded by guns and miscellaneous modification parts.
Bobby knew the town law office had an opening, arranged an interview for Sam, and he got the spot. His fiancée at the time interviewed for the hospital and landed a position there too, so they stayed.
Castiel tilted his head, questioning the nickname his hostage had provided him. It intrigued him, partially. “Then I guess I’ll just need to
They had a nice meal together, their first one, but it was hard to talk about typical date stuff, like their future, so they talked about their pasts. Dean told Cas about his teenage years, helping raise his brother, and he talked about his children.
Bobby nodded as Dean made the rest of the way out of the auto shop and towards his car. He felt renewed, in some way. All the crying let out a lot of negativity within him, but now he felt empty and hollow. The self-hatred and anger was gone, but he didn’t know what to replace any of it with.
But the though intrigued him. He could have a normal-ish life again, and write a book that he loved and would serve as more as a painful anchor to what he had lost. It could be displayed proudly on a bookcase instead of surrounded by his guns so that every time he went on a mission he could hurt himself into a motivational rage. His writing could be a source of love again instead of hatred.
She looked around at all of the adjacent tables and agents. She thought about their tickets in their information system. As secure as it was, anything may have been susceptible to a cyber attack.
Castiel’s face grimaced and he seemed a little bashful. “So, I have a place in mind that I was planning on going to in advance, and you may not like it. If you don’t I’ll do what I can to make it up to you, but I’m really excited.”
Dean didn’t laugh, although he was humored by why such a disclaimer was needed to begin with. “We’re just getting to know each other. This is our first…..date or whatever,” he said.
The license plate brought them a few substantial leads. Dean noticed a large empty area where Novak and his associate were never seen. Criminals wouldn’t want to be caught too close to their base, so they tended to venture out further.
After a few minutes of eating, it was time to put the plates away and get the kids to school. They grabbed their backpacks and made their way to Dean’s Impala. It wasn’t the best car for children per se, but he and Sam turned out mostly fine as they grew up riding in the same family car. Some PTA Moms looked at him judgingly, while others looked at him hungrily. He couldn’t win them all.
Dean chuckled, but it wasn’t happily. It was one of those things where everything is going wrong and your body forces out a weak, pathetic laugh because the situation is so terrible it’d nearly be comical if it were fiction. “Not only was that my last memory of him, it gets better!” he replied in an ironic sing-song tone. “My last words to him when I was stepping out of the room were ‘Well, if the thought of having a faggot son are killing you, I hope you flatline soon.’”
Dean turned back to the stage. He was impressed these students had all of these songs just memorized in their heads, and they knew exactly how to play them all through and through with no sheets in front of them. Dean found their talent to be truly spectacular.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said as he leaned forward to kiss Dean deeply and tenderly. It was safe to say that this was, by far, Dean’s favorite Christmas.
Dean looked like he was trying to come up with a joke. Maybe he’d say he only thought of hate fucking his throat or something else degrading, but he was tired too. “Yeah, I thought I’d see you sooner.”
Dean just smiled back and gave a polite nod. He was using all his strength to repress the goofiest of looks or to say something stupid in an octave too high. He reached out his hand to Cas, and Cas
Dean woke up on Saturday; his second day in Angel City. It felt odd, waking up consecutively in a room that wasn’t yours. How long would it take for it to feel normal? When he first moved in with Lisa, waking up in her bed everyday was strange. It took a lot of time for him to think of it as
Dean backed away after a few moments and looked out to the garage. The sound of their only car starting and Garth giving them a thumbs up was a good indicator the work was done.
“What are you thinking about?” Castiel’s voice was so velvety, almost like a purr. It drew Dean’s attention back to the real man, not the fictional one he was fantasizing about right now.
The next morning was the same routine, as it always was. Dean got up first, took his shower, got dressed. He woke up the kids and made their breakfast before taking them to their school, briefly checked out the Dilfs and Milfs, and made his way to the HQ.
“Everything is fine. I can handle him,” Castiel said. He brought his hand up discretely began to sign ASL. Thank you, Eileen for making him learn.
The man looked apologetic and sincere, as well as friendly. Sure, he was different, but so was Dean. He knew what it felt like to stand out, and not for the better. “Not at all,” Dean replied. Castiel smiled slightly, as least, Dean thought Castiel did.
He put on a robe, grabbed some clean clothes and his travel toiletries, and made his way to the bathroom for a shower. As the hot water cascaded on him, he thought about how this was the first day of his new normal; a house that wasn’t his, a family he third wheeled his way into- it seemed to be a habit of his. Lisa’s house. Lisa and her son. Maybe Dean would never truly have his own place, and if he did, it wouldn’t be as nice. After all, he was just some mechanic with a GED.
Castiel stood by the entryway momentarily. Anastasia’s back was towards him, but he could see a portion of her reflection from the vanity she was sitting at.
“I’m well aware, which has made the last few years particularly difficult,” Castiel stated. “Which is why I’m going to show you some pictures. I’ve made it very easy for you. But first, I’m going to give you something.”
There was something about the man’s confidence that really turned Dean on. He had never navigated these roles with a guy before. Sure he would refrain from texting to not appear desperate, and to keep the girl from being clingy, but Dean
“Let’s get you settled,” Sam said with a yawn. “I am not the night owl she is, and we can discuss more tomorrow. You’re a good man, Dean, and a hard worker. We’ll get you on your feet soon enough.”
Dean was smiling more now. Something about hearing Bobby and Karen overcome their hardships was motivating. “What was the second thing?”
They arrived at the bar, and there were a good amount of cars in the lot. It seemed like Thanksgiving at The Roadhouse was a popular event.
Carlie nodded. “Yeah, both families sort of founded this town and their ancestors apparently were engaged in this battle of grandeur and tried to one-up the other with generosity, but they’ve calmed down now as far as I know. Each wanted to have the city named after them, but due to their generosity to the other towns people, they decided Angel City was more appropriate.”
Dean shut his eyes at the guilt tripping. That was his least favorite phrase. Lisa used it all the time for the most minor of disagreements. “I’ll text you my address, just give me a heads up whenever you’d like to come over. I’ll close the library at five.”
The three of them had some drinks, laughs, and feel good movie times as a family while they waited for the sun to go down, which would commence the start of the festival.
Telling Castiel the truth might prevent the meeting, which would prevent him from being rescued. Leaving Castiel in the dark would get him captured and/or killed. “Not good,” Dean said.
“Anna, Castiel,” Michael greeted as he entered, offering them each a hug. He was a hard ass, and a hard man to get along with, but at least friendly at dinner events, which is the only time Castiel would tolerate being near Michael. “It’s good to see you both.”
“Sam and Dad fought all the time, so Dad was always so angry. I always had to do whatever I could to keep the peace. I did everything my dad always wanted, no questions asked. I had to be the perfect son. Sammy ran off to college instead of helping with the family business. Fuck what I wanted to do. When Dad got sick, I had to be the one to take care of him and run the business. When he got worse, we needed to sell the business to take care of his medical bills. I could have used it to go to college or something and finally start living my own life, but what was my life except to serve on my father’s behalf?”
He shucked off his pants, briefs, and stepped into the shower. He thought about Dean and how he would react to the events that happened. What would Dean think about using someone’s soulmate as leverage and extort their love for one another. One’s love for their soulmate was supposed to be the most pure thing, and Castiel had weaponized it as a weakness, and not for the first time.
Lisa was silent again, perhaps she was already in pain and felt guilty to some extent. “Thank you, Dean. Are you doing ok?”
“Well, I’m just glad Jo found you and got you to come. I was worried I wouldn’t see you again,” Dean confessed.
He shrugged his clothes off, trying to not wonder if Dean liked them or not, because why would that even matter now? He stepped into the shower and let the hot water cascade on him.           He let the water flow on his face instead of his tears and he just focused all of his attention on the shower, or at least he tried to.
Castiel bit his lips and forced his smile away. “It was a week or two before you moved away. We were drinking in my bedroom because your dad had just told you on short notice. We were both pretty miserable about the situation. And you said to me, ‘Castiel, I need you to fly us away together. Somewhere far away where it can be just the two of us together.’”
Castiel made a hopeful, pleading face that was too precious to resist. “I’m more than happy to accompany you to anywhere you’d like to go.”
He made his way out of Dean’s suite, fighting back the tears. He was so fucking stupid imagining any life with Dean would be possible. Castiel was a villain in Dean’s eyes and always would be. It didn’t matter if this mission of Castiel’s had an endgame. The end wouldn’t be justified by the means.
Dean wandered off to the men’s side of the store to get some ideas for himself or perhaps Sam. He was looking around at the displays when he bumped into another person.
He ripped the tape off Dean’s mouth, which stung a lot, but not as much as violently being thrown out of a moving car. “You better have a
He decided to call up Charlie instead to take his mind off the man. The phone rang a. few rings before the line clicked.
He gave Gabriel orders to get Dean unrestrained. His cell had a bed, a toilet, which he was likely going to need soon, but he gave himself a few hours to sober up before reuniting with the man.
“I can still drink less, I can just use these mugs now,” Bobby argued. Karen smiled and gave him a small peck.
Dean cupped Castiel’s face tenderly as they gazed into each other’s eyes. “I feel the same way, Cas. I’m not going to let them take you from me. Now, put that fucking cock inside of me and show me what I have a lifetime of looking forward to.”
Dean set his glass down and sighed. “I know. My whole life people have taken one look at me and assessed me as ‘the poor boy’, ‘the outsider’, ‘the simpleton, uneducated fiancée’. No matter how hard I’ve ever tried to prove myself on my own, nobody has ever cared to get to know me.”
Dean let out a broken rasp. He didn’t know how much he needed to hear those words from Castiel. “Thank you, Cas,” he said as he placed his own hand on top of Cas’s.
want Dean to know the truth. He wanted Dean to trust him, even though Cas was afraid to trust Dean. He couldn’t have it both ways, he supposed. But he wanted Dean to know him for him. If he ever wanted to get back to the man he used to be, Dean would need to know he was working on it.
Castiel let out a humored hum as he got an idea from Dean. “I hope it was as good for you as it was for me, Dean. How excited you must be that your soulmate is a crime lord. You get to be my sexy little trophy wife for as long as I want you alive. It’ll just me you and me and whatever tiny skimpy outfit I want you in.
He was in his early thirties, which was a little late to be finding his soulmate. He wasn’t in a rush, and his life was comfortable, but it would be
“It’s midnight in DC. We have time. Let’s put more distance between us and Zachary and maybe buy some clean clothing,” Dean said. “We can have an actual breakfast date, and lunch date, and maybe another night together. What do you say?”
She had been going through stacks of files, photos, and records in secret under the guise of being under protection due to the incident, which was a half truth.
He felt two arms wrap around him, and his instincts kicked in to defend himself from his attacker. He shoved his assailant and had him pinned down on the couch when he realized it was Dean’s eyes under him.
Dean smirked at the phone. He loved the coy playfulness of their conversation. The man was riling him up and he wanted to reciprocate. He brought the phone up to his lips and hit the record audio button for audio messages. “How do you know, though?” Dean asked in his lowest, sultriest voice. He didn’t want anything getting lost in translation for this one.
“Well, I’m a doctor here with Jessica, and when I’m not working, I am pretty much watching rom-coms,” she said.
- the cold-hearted, uncaring criminal. This is not the man he wanted Dean to believe he was last night. Either last night was fake, or the stakes were high right now.
The electronic lock made the disengaging noise and he stepped into the suite slowly. The lights were off in the living room, but he had left the kitchen light on to dully illuminate the rest of the suite.
“He has no cellphone reception where he’s at. He needs to use this old booth that has a landline in it, and you pay with quarters, and because of the time difference and the cost, he can only reach me for a very short amount of time,” he lied.
Dean rolled his eyes and hoped his blushing wasn’t going to give him away. He wanted to ask about Castiel, but he definitely couldn’t do it
She gave him a skeptical look as she contemplated his offer. “Usually, I would say no, but it’s been a rough day, so I guess why not?”
“Dean! Cas! Where are my congratulatory hugs!? If you’re going to throw me under the bus like that, the very least you can do is get in on this group hug!” Jess ordered.
Castiel gave him an unreadable look, and turned his attention bac to Dean’s stitch work. “Consider the record broken.” Dean wasn’t sure how to take that, but he had to assume that what Roman did really was just an unauthorized fluke, and he wasn’t in immediate danger
Thanksgiving morning was spent sleeping in. It felt odd getting a holiday after only three days of working, but it was going to be a good day.
“Goodnight,” Sam said as he left, shutting the door behind him. Dean sighed and took in the room. There was a dresser one curio cabinet, and one landscape painting to prevent the room from being bare, but it certainly wasn’t
“Not as smart as my darling sister,” Castiel objected. “I know you do everything for our eldest siblings. The family business would fall apart without you.”
Michael groaned with annoyance. “You know her, she wants to do bigger and better every year, especially since this is on a vicennial year. I try not to displease her, but I have to draw my line sometimes. What can one do?”
“I have plenty to be insecure about,” Castiel said. “I’m sure you may as well, although I could hardly how.”
They talked about their Thanksgivings during the drive; Charlie had gone to her friend Benny’s house in Lawrence. They had met in the GSA club in college and Charlie excitedly offered to introduce them, which Dean politely declined for now.
“Then nothing’s really changed!” Gabriel said positively. “We torture him for the info, and then we kill him!” Castiel’s face twitched negatively and Gabriel smiled as if he was victorious in a prank. “Compromised!”
They met up at the rendezvous point and a few cars arrived with half a dozen FBI Agents. Dean had advised that although he negotiated as nice treatment as he could, he’d still be treated a bit like a criminal, so Castiel was prepared to not receive a warm greeting on his end.
Castiel looked embarrassed and overwhelmed from the flattery. He took a drink of his wine to hide himself, which was obvious to Dean, and he let out a chuckle. Castiel set his drink down, but was still attempting to hide his gaze from Dean, but he wasn’t hiding his smile. Cas eventually forced himself to look back at Dean. “I suppose I was…equally attracted upon meeting you. I’m
“Don’t be. It is what it is. I need to head back to Sam and Bobby, and I’m sure you’re trying to manage something as well. Just be easy on the kid, Lees,” Dean stated.
They spent just a few notes with each other, dancing in silence, just enjoying each other’s presence in their arms, and their longing looks at one another before Dean decided to break the silence.
Dean nodded and made his way out the door and to his car. This was an interesting town for sure, but he definitely couldn’t shake the feelings of resentment and regret. He
Castiel gave a mischievous grin. “You have a nice bed, a television, and you got what I would consider a
The man smiled as he stood up into a normal position and patted the couch. “Whatever you want, sir.”
The man gave Castiel an approving smile before getting down to his hands and knees, slowly making his way to Castiel. His back was arched and his gaze was on Castiel’s eyes the entire time.
but sexualizing his incredibly hot hostage was significantly better than dwelling on the fact this man was his
“I thought so too,” Cas replied. His voice was velvet and smooth like honey. It sounded like a purr, and Dean needed him to not do that for a moment.
As Dean was typing away, another agent came by their table. “Geesh, that’s a lot of pictures. Are these of your Novak guy?” Zachary Adler was an older agent that had been on many similar cases involving large crime lords, gangs, criminal organizations. He had gotten a good promotion out of it, and now helped to oversee similar cases. Even though they reported to Bobby, Zachary checked in every so often.
Dean sighed heavily. Another stranger sizing him up and judging him. He didn’t feel like he was worthy of much.
“Good, I’ll see you then,” Bobby stated. “Go and take this car out for a spin.” Bobby headed back to the shop and Dean unlocked the door to the Impala and sat inside. It definitely needed an air freshener; Dean could only fathom how long it had been since it was properly driven. He rolled the windows down with the crank and started the car. It purred perfectly and Dean drove it out of the lot without an issue.
“Not enough to torrent pornography,” he replied in his thick Russian accent. “I may be able to swing you a magazine, though.”
Dean looked around at the busy bar. There was one other bartender aside from her and Ellen. “You gotta be pretty busy. I don’t want you to waste time on me.”
Dean Winchester was beautiful inside and out. Castiel didn’t think anyone as pure as Dean was left on the planet. His outlook on life was negative and full of spite, but something about meeting Dean was finally giving him optimism. He hoped they could find away to be together.
Dean thought about he told Cas he’d see him around; he really hoped that he would. That night, he dreamed of a certain librarian’s eyes and the span of the oceans within them.
Gabriel didn’t smirk or tease him or anything like that, which Castiel found incredibly suspicious given his brother’s nature, but Castiel wouldn’t pry to have his asshole brother change his mind and start.
Dean didn’t have a whole lot of money right now since he hasn’t worked at Bobby’s long enough to receive a check yet, so he mostly just accompanied Charlie and gave her some input on clothes and gifts.
Dean was never much of a dancer. Aside from last night at the bar with a lot of alcohol in him, he had never slow danced with anybody, nor did he ever think he’d have an interest in it. But right now, he wanted nothing more in the world than to dance with Castiel.
He climbed on the bed behind Dean and roamed his hands appreciatively on the ass presented to him. “You’re so beautiful, Dean Winchester. I am so gratefully you’re allowing me to make love to you.”
The writing in that book was immaculate. It was incredibly unlikely that style of prose came from an amateur novelist. That came from someone who studied literature immensely, who would have needed to practice their writing craft relentlessly over years to perfect. If Castiel was actively a criminal his entire life, he likely would not have had the time for this side hobby.
His heart was pounding in his chest, for multiple reasons. The first reason was that he wasn’t keen on flying; he had always preferred the hot asphalt that was the open road. Windows down, classic rock playlist blaring- that was one of his favorite things. The second reason was that the last time he was in Nebraska, he left someone very important behind.
Castiel blushed in embarrassment a little. “I suppose my closet could use a little diversity. You look much better than I.”
Anna and Naomi were close, though/ They were the only girls in their family and they both worked at the hospital; the only difference being Anna kept the patients alive and Naomi carved them up after they were dead.
“You’re so fucking huge and it’s been awhile, but god, it feels so nice to have you inside me,” Dean replied. “Keep going.”
“It’s a big commitment, so you don’t need to make a decision now, but we’d like you to seriously think about it,” Sam said.
The elevator stopped and they were escorted somewhere echo-y. He wasn’t sure where the initial concrete area he was being held at was in comparison to the suite, but it was possible he was headed back there.
His eyes looked at him with a playful expression, as if he was being challenged or tested. Dean let out a nervous, entertained scoff at librarian who was choosing now of all times to play with his emotions. “I’m asking you if you feel the same; if you’ll go out with me again, take me back.”
He parked in the near-empty parking lot and stepped out of the impala. “Angel City Library” explained the words carved into the marble of the building. Dean huffed. Time to see what the buzz was about.
Dean was wheeled into a sanitary looking white room covered in tarps, which wasn’t a very good sign of what was about to come.
“Happy Thanksgiving, Everyone!” The woman announced as she entered. Ellen approached the woman to greet her and welcome her in.
She approached behind the counter and poured Castiel a cup of coffee. “Pancakes, sausage, two scrambled eggs?” she asked, knowing his order well enough from his frequent visits.
“I’m just playing! I know this is Dean-o! I do have to congratulate you on coming back to your senses, buddy. I’m his favorite brother, Gabriel.” The prankster held out his hand and Dean shook it questioningly, still unsure what to make of the man.
“Precisely. She came to me seeking advice on how to flush the rat out,” he explained, sighing heavily. “Sadly, I worry if I accidentally accelerated her inevitable betrayal.”
Once Castiel found his family and put his family’s murderer in the ground, Castiel said he was going to flee. What does Dean do with that information? What position will Dean be in? Is Castiel planning on taking him with? Cas said the FBI would never find him, and Dean remaining a hostage would mean that they had a reason to keep searching; so is Dean back at the FBI in this scenario? Would Dean resume his fruitless chase to find Castiel, or is he supposed to just be content in America without ever seeing Castiel again?
Dean let out a surprised chuckle through the tears and tight emotions. “I don’t see how that plays into the metaphor here, Bobby.”
He went to take another bite when it began to ring again, and he knew something must be important. He gestured for Eileen to give him a moment, and he headed to his phone. The number saved was for Jack and Claire’s day care, and he felt himself tense up a bit.
Maybe he should throw Dean back in the cell since he wanted to be ungrateful. Hostages didn’t get lavish five-star suites with a king-sized bed, food delivery, and Netflix. Dean needed to be punished for his behavior.
The other patron looked shocked and disturbed at the outburst, not that Castiel could see behind him. Most customer service workers would hate Castiel for his rude outburst, but Meg just laughed hysterically as if she heard the best joke in the world.
“Okay,” Bobby said as he reached beside him to grab another present. “This one is for Dean. It’s from both me and Sam. Karen carefully passed it to Castiel, who carefully handed it to Dean.
Castiel let out a soft chuckle. “I’m saying it’s rather disappointing you don’t have a nice ring on his hand to take up space from my own fingers. I think you deserve a ring, Dean Winchester.”
“So what am I missing that resulted in you keeping Dean alive, mostly unmaimed, and you two both working together?” Jo asked.
He took a small cannister out of his pocket and removed the lid to procure a small paper strip. The man dipped the paper into the wine for a few seconds before removing it to examine it. Although Castiel still had some in his glass, he took the bottle next and poured a few additional ounces for himself. Once the bottle was set down, Castiel took a drink himself out of good faith.
“I’ll take it,” Gabriel said with a smile. He gestured to the bartender to bring them two drinks and turned to her. “What’s your name, gorgeous?”
! Although, maybe a little awkward?” He made an indecisive noise to further dramatize his monologue. “I mean I’m sure you find a way past this, I really do-”
She eyed up at the two security cameras in Bobby’s own office. Dang government agencies monitoring everything but they couldn’t find one dang traitor.
Dean woke up in the back of a car, still with duct tape on his mouth and his hands tied behind his back. He looked over to see Castiel looking at him softly.
“You have some nice ones,” the man replied. “I am a fan of ‘bite the bullet’ to mean ‘finish quickly’, because if you were to bite a bullet, you would be dead, and I get the feeling you will be dead soon enough, Mr. Winchester.”
He kept eyeing the quaint town through the windows of the car, still being mindful of his driving. Would he be here for the rest of his life? Would he leave once he had enough saved up? He knew he didn’t need to answer those questions now, but he felt like he did. But also, what was the point? He thought he knew with Lisa. Despite his best planning, anything could yank the rug from under his feet and knock him down. What was the point?
The ‘Dean’ character was so certain and so positive nothing would ever go wrong with the character he associated with Cas, and in real life, he was so certain something would go wrong. Alamander was willing to risk it all for the slimmest chance to be with Ryworth, and Dean was too afraid to risk anything.
He had always loved the chase when he picked up people. In a world of soulmates, it was sometimes a challenge to convince people to bend over for someone they weren’t destined to be with. Dean enjoyed being the player in his youth, and he definitely missed it now. He wasn’t too used to being on the receiving end of these mind games, but he could tell Castiel was thriving in them, relishing his victories over Dean.
“Will do,” she promised. “Goodbye, Dean.” The line was disconnected and Dean just solemnly put his phone back into his pocket. He leaned against the wooden railing of the outdoor patio and rested his head on his forearms and let himself cry for a moment, hoping for a cathartic moment that would purge all the bad feelings away; anything that would offer his soul some peace.
Castiel winced, as if he was flinching, as if he were there No doubt he had his own instances of homophobia or discrimination to relate to. “I got defensive and I ask him why. He turns to me and says ‘I don’t want to see this fag shit.’ I told him right then and there; ‘I like guys and girls, so there’s a fifty percent chance my wedding could be two dudes!”
“Yeah, I am. Then I moved out to Denver when Dad passed. Nothing was keeping me around anymore,” Dean said.
Dean just smiled and slowly pulled the book out of Castiel’s hands, which made the librarian smile softly. “What else you got for me?”
But he felt guilty for hurting Cas this way. It wasn’t fair when Lisa did it to him, and he couldn’t bear to do it to Cas now. Dean couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t hurt Cas again once they get more invested; and he
“Are you sure about this, Dean? You’ve been very back and forth, and you haven’t exactly known him long. ‘Love’ is a strong word,” Sam replied.
He needed to calm himself down so he could think rationally. Vodka always helped with that. He made his way to his decanter and poured himself a glass, immediately downing it all in one swig before pouring another and making his way to his chaise, collapsing on it and sighing heavily.
“I’d like names of anyone you know that may have been close to Anastasia, or anyone that may have used our competitor’s services in addition to ours. Maybe they were not happy with a deal?” Castiel suggested.
He would unpack and put everything away in the morning. For now, he just stood up to strip down to his briefs, shut off the lights, and crawl underneath the covers hoping his self-hatred wouldn’t keep him up all night again.
They arrived at the outlet mall, and it was a cute area. He was expecting a sad strip mall, but there was a large square perimeter of shops and boutiques. The pillars and benches were already decorated for Christmas, as were many of the glass windows in the displays, and there was a large sitting area on two ends of the shops, each with a large Christmas tree already decorated to the fullest.
“Don’t answer those,” Michael insisted. His dinners went his way. He would talk about himself if needed, which would likely happen anyways. Almost everyone at this table was pretentious and dull, with the exception of Gabriel who was arrogant and annoying.
He didn’t see any mansions in the area, but he knew if Castiel was living modestly, it was by his own choice. He finally arrived at the apartment building, and it couldn’t have had more than six units. He probably owned the building and was the landlord.
“Michael and Lucifer were, mostly, as they were the oldest. Some others. Many of us resigned to our roles. I simply didn’t care, although I can’t say for certain if I subconsciously resigned from the start. I was the second youngest,” he explained.
Castiel groaned and tried to loosen up the stress building in his neck. “First I need a massage for my neck and back, and you can figure out what to massage from there.”
“Say that we have our whole lives together,” he replied vulnerably. His emerald eyes were worried. They were off their euphoria and the reality was setting in again. Castiel was a criminal who needed to be taken in if Dean were to get back home.
He met all the qualifications; they exchanged sentences, he heard the shittiest understatement of ‘singing angels’ ever, he got dizzy, he got breathless, and what he heard must have been a loud heartbeat, like from an ultrasound.
Dean wasn’t sure what to make of the transparency. Why ask if he was going to give an answer? Was he trying to nonchalantly bury other leads? But also, did transparency mean Dean was going to die here? “My brother and I each enjoy our sluts, who doesn’t, but we make sure they are all….ethically sourced….like coffee!”
“You’re reading too much into my joke,” Sam griped. “But yes, you should try to find a hobby. I’m almost always doing case work, but when I’m not, I usually do sudoku and crossword puzzles.”
“I’m glad,” Cas said. “And I understand wholeheartedly. This can be slow and casual as needed. I would prefer not to rush into being a rebound.”
“I would prefer not to sell my business to someone who will just tear it down,” Bobby said. “It may be a humble life, but it’s yours if you want it.”
psychic, she wouldn’t have done all this work if him and Castiel weren’t meant to be. Maybe he would lean into that reasoning.
Dean was definitely enjoying himself. He was closing his eyes, focusing his senses onto his tactile ones so he could feel their fucking more astutely; and whenever Dean
Dean’s face grimaced at his words. “I guess I’m not as strong as you are, Cas. You making that same decision would kill me, and I can’t go through that again.”
“See you in the morning, Sam,” he said as he glared at Sam with the most pissed off expression he could manage while walking past him.
“Is that what you were looking for? To get away from the world?” Cas asked. Dean’s mouth twitched as it held back an impressed smile. Was Cas coincidental with his question or did he have a way to see through Dean? Was he truly transparent and without defenses due tot his man?”
Dean looked at Castiel and took a step closer to him and cupped his face. “You don’t need to be so reserved, Cas,” Dean said. “I
He drank the remainder of the alcohol he had at the decorative curio. He opened the concealed freezer and there were no spare bottles inside.
Jack shrugged and looked non-committal at the question. “I liked my life with my mom. This city’s not exciting, but Michael is paying for my college.”
“Gotta love my boys,” Jessica said. “Dean, this is Anna Milton, Castiel’s sister,” Jessica announced.
“I have contingencies in place if he doesn’t,” Castiel replied. They made their own way out shortly after. They got into the backseat of their car and the driver made his way to bring Castiel back to his residential tower.
“If you don’t have information for me, Dean Winchester, I don’t have much reason to keep you around. So you better think
“It would be greatly appreciated,” Castiel said. “Before I let you go, I have one more question, if I may.”
Jo shook her head. “You don’t always get to choose in life; can’t choose circumstances, or what happens, or-”, she picked the shot of whiskey up and set it more in front of Dean directly, “-whomever comes into your life. You just make the best of what life gives you.”
He leaned forward and kissed Castiel tenderly. Castiel immediately melted in to the kiss and reciprocated. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s back and held him tight as Dean kissed him.
Dean heard the car come to a screech and he heard a door open. Gunshots were fired, but Dean wasn’t in a position to see. The next thing he knew, two hands were flipping him over, and he was so relieved to see Cas standing over him. A little banged up and dirty, but it was him.
,” she countered with a smile. Dean chuckled; he liked her attitude a lot. He could potentially see her as a good friend down the road perhaps.
Castiel chuckled as his two siblings left to give them some space on their own. “You’re very good at repelling my family members. Just when I thought you couldn’t get any sexier.”
He stepped out of the car and made his way inside the establishment. There was classic rock playing on the speakers, the sound of pool balls smashing into each other and against the green velvet walls, and loud camaraderie from other patrons.
They all politely obeyed, nobody feeling hurt. Anastasia was the oldest female of the family, and Castiel was the youngest child. With a large family, their parents only did so much, so raising Gabriel and Castiel mostly fell on her shoulders, so there was no surprise by their closeness.
Castiel gave him a knowing look and a smirk as he pulled back the adhesive bandage that was protecting his wound. The peeling of the adhesive on the sore skin was discomforting, but nothing would be as painful as whatever he was injected with.
The bus finally arrived at the Lawrence station and Dean sluggishly made his way off the bus. One attendant was removing all of the luggage from the under storage, and Dean patiently waited for the herd to clear before grabbing his two suitcases and making his way to reception.
“It was great,” Dean stated. “Those guys work hard, and they’re more skilled than you gave them credit for.”
As soon as his sentence finished from his lips, a high-pitched ringing jolted him, throwing him forward in pain. The only other thing Dean could hear was a loud pumping noise that sounded vaguely familiar. He tried to open his eyes, and everything was blurry as could be. Did Castiel strike him with something?
one half,” Jo replied, gesturing at her desk. Dean stood up and looked over his monitors to see that yes, Jo had another equally large folder full of photos on her desk, making Dean grimace. “Get to work.”
“I’m an excellent doctor, thank you,” Jessica replied with a charming confidence. “So, when are you going to start at Bobby’s?”
He grimaced. He was happy for the civil conversation, but he wasn’t ready to have this conversation so soon. “We don’t need to do all of that, Lisa. We both know it’s a messy breakup that I didn’t want. I’m not saying that to be rude, I appreciate the attempt, but I just can’t play pretend.”
Their mouths just softly moved against each others, tenderly trading soft kisses for several moments, neither of them needing to escalate the moment into something more intense.
head of a growing Russian Mafia that had been growing steadily over the past two years. They’ve linked him to arms deals to multiple other big crime players as well as some smaller countries. He’s evasive, and half the world away, but the United States has determined he is a large enough to be monitored, but not large enough to start a war over.
“He and his wife are doing great. He’s a lawyer, she’s a doctor,” Dean stated. They heard the bus noises slowly approach and they turned to it instinctively. “Were you hoping on?”
Dean gasped a little when Castiel came into view. He was ornately dressed in a pristine suit. He must have left the trench coat at home or in the car. This was the first time Dean got to see all of Castiel’s figure. He was a broad man with strong shoulders from what he could tell. Everything on him was tailored perfectly, and it suited him very well. No wonder Jess immediately picked up on what tonight was; he was dressed to the tens and had Dean suddenly feeling extremely self-conscious.
Dean awoke the next day more well-rested than he had for the past several days. It was the first night since the breakup he went to bed sober, and the first morning he had woken up not hung over.
She blushed and chuckled, signing thank you when Sam heard the alert go off that a voicemail had been left. Spam callers typically didn’t leave voicemails, but his clients would. But still, it would have to wait.
They made their way inside the restaurant and they were escorted to a small booth table in the corner with a great view of the rest of the bar. The waitress brought them their drinks and they waited on their food.
and they both sort of knew it, but they did their best to not cross the line. Dean held Cas’s hand the entire ride and he’d occasionally bring it to his mouth to kiss. They talked about the books Dean read, and Dean said he was excited to start the one with the gay knights.
Dean smiled widely, surprised Missouri wasn’t taken aback by his shortcomings. “So, does this mean I can get a bouquet to try to impress Cas?”
And Missouri, I really don’t know even know if he’ll say yes to me, even with you gorgeous bouquets. God, I really hope he does, but…..I made my mistakes, and I’ll have to live with them, but I can’t have him not knowing how I feel anymore. And I know my explanation seemed one sided, but I think, or at least I’m
The guards changed after a while and the new one had food for Deana s Castiel promised. He had to be fed with a fork, which was humiliating, but maybe it would all be over soon. If Cas was being serious, if he was really going to be freed, he’d get to see his children soon. He was going to hold them so tight.
“That was phenomenal,” Dean complimented. “I hope we don’t have to do any running tomorrow. I’m getting caught, for sure. I may never walk right again.”
She headed to the coffee machine to bring over an almost full pot. “This was just made for the guy who left when you walked in, so don’t worry about the age.” She put a coffee cup in front of Dean and filled it up. “So, what would you like for breakfast?”
He entered the diner and the bell announced his arrival. There was one other customer currently, and Meg glanced his way to see who came in.
He rotated Dean and began to wash the man’s back. Castiel pressed his cock against Dean’s cleft, causing the man to moan again. God, that encouraged Castiel. He wanted to bury himself into Dean right now, but there was no lube.
your fault, we have been working through. The phone call didn’t change anything I didn’t already know when I let you inside of me. We will be fine, Cas.”
“No-” Dean interrupted, repositioning the both of them so Dean could look deeply into his crush’s deep blue eyes. “You did absolutely nothing wrong. We were trying to have a conversation about boundaries, and I panicked and made it about myself because I was afraid.”
A humble life? He turned to look at Castiel who was looking at him, smiling. He seemed excited for Dean, but Dean knew Cas would let Dean choose whatever he wanted without pressuring him.
He handed the bouquet to Cas, who took them appreciatively. “Thank you, Dean,” Cas said with a smile. “They’re truly beautiful.”
“Then it feels like I’m skirting around, hiding the truth,” Dean stated. “I’ve done enough of that in my life already.”
“We have our whole lives together,” Castiel repeated as confidently as he could. Dean leaned in and gave him another kiss. This one was sturdy, he was putting a lot of strength into it, as if to apply the statement into will. Castiel really hoped he didn’t just inadvertently tell a lie. A future with Dean is everything he wanted.
The captive man raised his eyebrows suggestively and grinned devilishly as he approached Castiel, grabbing the iron bars of his cell and leaned close to him. “You kinky bastard.”
Dean nodded. “New York is fun,” he said softly. He didn’t know where to go from there, though, and it seemed pointless to try to get to know his captor. He laid back down on the small bed he was privileged to have.
“Aww,” Dean said. “I thought I had until you were at least a teenager to get all unhappy, but that’s fine. I’ll stop if you don’t like it. You should never be afraid to tell anyone if you don’t like being touched, hugged, or kissed. So, do you want me to stop?”
Castiel nodded and tried to compose himself. “I just hope I can do something to make everything worthwhile for you. I want to make amends for this, somehow, someway.”
He made his way to the hidden bunker and navigated the concrete halls until he got to one of the vaulted rooms, similar to where Dean was held.
Missouri looked at Dean and smiled. “It takes a good man to admit where he’s failed and acknowledge his shortcomings, and fight to make things better and work at the issues at hand. I think you’re a good man, Dean.”
He made it to his apartment when he noticed a familiar car in the residential parking lot. “Damn it,” he said to himself.
Dean let out a deep moan as Castiel slid inch and inch into Dean. He was so tight and hot around Castiel’s dick. Dean was rubbing Castiel’s chest as Castiel filled him up. His breathing was strained, but he was taking it rather well.
There had been a lot of little issues piling up. He never felt adequate around her successful friends. Whenever he stated he was a mechanic, they always looked so unimpressed and distrusting. “I hope you’re not one of the bad mechanics,” they would always say. They always had a story about how they were overcharged or incompetent. Dean loved being a mechanic, and he took pride in his service, but he was only ever looked down on as someone trying to scam privileged upper-middle-class people of their wealth.
He set his glass on the end table next to him, opting to grab the framed photograph instead. It was a photo of him when he was slightly younger. He had significantly less tattoos on his body, and his arm was around the waist of a red headed woman who emanated power and confidence. He brought the photograph up to his lips and kissed the glass.
Every booth was connected by a zigzagging canopy of string lights, and there was a walking path with hundreds of arches which were also decorated with garland and lighting.
Right now, Castiel was planning a complete choreography of the exchange. He would be giving every last detail right to Zachariah. Everything from entry to escape route. There would be no way Castiel would be getting out.
“You never mentioned you were trading with the feds,” Zachary said. He glanced over at Dean. His face was supposed to be neutral, Dean assumed, but it wasn’t. He was tense. Was Zachary not here to rescue him?
Dean was kissing Castiel slowly and tenderly as they held each other in the dim mood lighting. Dean moved his hands to unbutton Castiel’s shirt. The fabric opened up and revealed the intricate artwork on Castiel’s chest. Dean eventually got the shirt to shed off and he roamed his hands on Castiel’s chest.
Seeing his tall little-brother did made Dean feel slightly better. He had the best brothers in the world. Even though it had been a few years since he last saw his half-brother, Adam, he was greatly happy to be reunited with Sam.
They took their seats, Cas next to Dean and Jack sat a few more seats down. Dean just continued to look at Castiel with a mesmerized expression. “I just can’t believe you’re here,” Dean said. “I….I’ve tried to find you online, but no dice.”
Castiel reciprocated the hug with some loving pats on his back. “It’s very good to see you too, Dean. I’ve missed you.”
“You won’t have a choice, mister,” Jessica threatened. “You’re going to go. If not for me, and not for the lights and displays, then the unlimited spiced eggnog.”
Castiel just smiled and let out a sigh of relief. Every bit of tension he felt gather in the past five years since the incident was finally released. His soulmate was taking care of his niece and nephew, and that was all he needed. He wasn’t sure how his relationship with Dean would work, or what the visitation circumstances would be, but he wouldn’t want to risk Dean’s trust. He wouldn’t ask to see the kids or do anything to imply he had an ulterior motive, because he didn’t. He could finally let go of the past and enjoy the rest of his life in peace.
to be at the festival. If Dean told him he was coming, he maybe wouldn’t show; but if he kept it to himself, he could surprise Castiel.
Later on in the night, the Roadhouse got a later arrival.While the women here were more dressed for the holidays than most of the men, this woman was over-extravagantly dressed. An older woman with long red hair and a black ornate ball gown that looked like it was from the 1800s.
The comfort food wasn’t cheering him up as much as he had hoped, but it was delicious, and it did distract him a little bit. He wasn’t one to indulge, but if this experience taught him anything, it was that he needed to do things for himself more often.
Between work and the kids, he was exhausted often, and there was very little free time for himself, but Jack and Claire were more than worth it.
“It is not you that I am worried about,” the man replied before he took a sip of his own drink. Castiel cocked his head curiously as he waited for the man to quench his thirst so he could hear the rest of the story. “As I was saying; I met with Anastasia two months before the raid. She had expressed concerns she no longer knew who to trust. Minor inconveniences became less minor, and more frequent. Se thought inside information was being leaked.”
“And that is why you’re willing to do anything for your soulmate….because their bond is that deep. They do anything for each other….” Castiel replied slowly, working through his own thoughts, no longer paying mind to the wife.
Cas chuckled softly as he patted Jack’s shoulder. “You remember me mentioning my eldest brother Luke, right? He’s technically Jack’s father, but I’ve been raising him for the past few years when he came into our lives. Jack, this is my old friend from high school, Dean Winchester.”
One of the pics with a high possibility of being Novak’s guy had a partial Russian license plate. “Jo! Jo! We might have a new lead,” he said as he showed her the pic. She took it with interest and looked at it curiously, mixed emotions on her face.
“I’ll be right here!” Castiel’s voice announced from the admin room. Dean took a deep breath and nervously tapped on the wooden frame. Castiel emerged from the room and paused curiously when he saw Dean standing there.
Unlike Michael and Gabriel, he other siblings did not make any big deal about Castiel and Anna being home because it was a
Guns were pointed at him, ready to do anything if he acted in a bad manner. A blonde female agent went straight to Dean and hugged him as an agent approached him to cuff him.
“Those records…”, the man began to weep. “I only initially place them, I won’t have a way to beyond-”
He left his bed to get cleaned up in the bathroom before making his way back under the covers. It was time to sleep now, and he let himself ease down from his orgasmic high. Whatever this was with Castiel, whatever was going to happen, he had no choice but to continue to take things one day at a time.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, princess,” Mary Winchester read aloud to Dean, who was curled up in his bed, tucked under his blankets, and was having his head gently stroked as Mary read him his nightly bedtime story for the evening.
The line was silent for a few seconds before he heard a sigh, “I’m not mad,” she said softly. “I just want him to stay strong. These weeks haven’t been easy for him.”
The aircraft began to pick up speed, and there was a bit of a roar as it reached its maximum speed. With a small tilt of some flaps, the plane began to lift seemingly effortlessly and rise gently higher and higher.
Dean drank all of his whiskey in a single swig and set the glass down and gestured for another. “I just don’t know, Jo,” Dean replied.
Bobby was reassuring her it wasn’t him, which she believed. Dean had often said Bobby was like a father to him. Bobby got him into the FBI, after all. If anything, he treated Dean with some privileges that she definitely noticed. “We’ll find him together.”
“He’s not going to be happy I kept you alive.. He’s very liability-minded, and I don’t want to explain the soulmate thing, so I’m going to keep you gagged to make you look really hostage-y. Just please go along with it and act stressed, please,” Castiel said.
Dean gave her a confused look and she eagerly took him to a booth a few yards away from their last one, leaving many behind in their wake. “We’re missing so much! Let me look around!”
“Thank you,” Dean told the staff cordially as they left the two of them be. Dean decided maybe the food was a blessing and it would prevent him from embarrassing himself further.
Dean chuckled softly at that. “I’m here specifically because I just got out of a long term relationship.”
Meg gave another curious smile. “I think you should give ours a chance when you can. Hope you have a good rest of your day.”
Jo made a face as if she was about to give bad news. “Crowley MacLeod sucks, Lucifer Novak sucks, Balthazar Novak sucks, Gabriel Novak is an annoying ass so therefore he sucks,” she listed.
Zachariah, Raphael, and Jack were the last to come downstairs. Zachariah was in the middle group of siblings, and took over the real estate aspects of the family businesses. About half of the apartment buildings in town were the Novak’s. The one Castiel lived in was
“Good Morning, Kiddo!” Dean greeted cheerfully, setting the spatula down to give her a hug and a kiss on her forehead. “Where’s your brother? Did he get out of bed?”
“I’ve missed you guys. I….can’t say how much I appreciate this. I hate imposing more than anything,” Dean replied.
Dean just needed to kill time and distract himself from writhing with anxiety all day. He just wanted to shoot his shot, get it over with, and have the cards fall where they may.
“Fuck me,” Dean mumbled as he quickly left the bathroom, trying to minimize the time Jessica would have to ask questions.
“Cas,” he whispered with an exhale as he closed his eyes again. He didn’t want to admit it, but he thought about Cas and his potential soulmate all the time. Did he find his by now? Was he happy?
Many of those close to Anastasia were still in the wind, after all these years. Were they protecting themselves from law enforcement,…or retribution?
“Are you positive she doesn’t mind?” Dean asked nervously. Being a burden or a bother was one of his largest concerns. He didn’t want to ruin anything by being there. He also didn’t want his brother or his sister-in-law pitying him either.
Dean had been deducing presents sleuthily for over two decades now, and he had to say he was fairly good at it. Based on the wrapping, two similar items were stacked on top of each other. He heard the sound of metal or glass rubbing against each other and the items shifting separately as the present was moved.
His voice was dominant and threatening, and because Dean’s penis hated him, he felt himself starting to chub up under his hands. He quickly grabbed the comforter of the bed and pulled it over him to provide more cover.
He got out of bed, and realized he fell asleep in his dress shirt. At least the pants find the floor- that would have been uncomfortable.
“Have fuuuuuuun,” Gabriel sang as he made his way to the door and walked with an obnoxious flounce that was only intended to piss him off.
“I usually only go over paperwork in the morning. The garage doesn’t get opened up until Garth or Jack get here, but you can get started on that now if you want,” Bobby said as he fished a bundle of keys attached to a lanyard from his desk drawer. “The large metal doors I can’t open and close anymore. Never wanted to invest in an automatic opener when I got two almost capable lads.”
Cas grinned eagerly at Dean’s cooperation. “Thank you,” he cheerfully replied as he extended his arm to Dean. Dean held his hand and allowed himself to be escorted to Castiel’s car.
Dean chuckled and put one final soft kiss on his lips. “Get home safe.” Dean maneuvered his way out of the car and carefully closed the door and made his way back to the house. He turned behind him once last time to wave goodbye at Cas. Upon shifting his gaze back, he noticed the curtains in the window moving, as if they had been dropped.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said as he approached. Jack just continued to walk past and head to the car. “I wasn’t aware you were the new supervisor Jack had spoken about.”
She was thoroughly looking into similar Russian mafias the FBI previously looked into when she stumbled across a photo. It was from several years ago of someone walking a bride down a wedding aisle.
He got into his car and started the course for Sam and Jessica’s house where he’d chill until it was drinking time with Bobby.
“Oh, I think I’m hilarious,” the man replied. “I think, in another life, we could have been friends.”
Charlie and Jo made their way to the dance floor and took each other in their arms. A slow song began to play for the two of them and they swayed with each to the melody while looking at each other as if they were the only two people in the world.
terrible feeling was the soulmate experience. Although, everyone always gave coy descriptors such as ‘Trust me, you’ll know’ or ‘It’s not something you forget or misinterpret’.
Dean squinted, looking at the man suspiciously. “You asked me this already. I thought we agreed on Russia.”
Castiel arrived at the house to pick Dean up again, and Dean lucked out again with it being Jessica’s Saturday to work. Dean kissed Castiel as soon as the front door was closed behind him.
, and Dean didn’t know how to feel about that. The man was going to seduce every US secret out of him.
A red headed woman made her way over to Jessica’s car midway through Dean’s repair. “So you got the cavalry to arrive after all? I’m glad you didn’t get stranded out here,” she said.
“Cas-” Dean instinctively protested. Why was he protesting? He should be happy with his. He should have actively been trying to encourage Cas into letting him go this whole time, but he never did, nor was anything his intention. If Cas gave him up, that was the end of this.
“I think that’s why he was so adamant about me being killed, you not being left with me,” Dean said. Castiel helped Dean get off the ground and he worked on unfastening Dean’s binds for the first time in hours. He let out a small moan as he stretched and moved his arms in front of him, rotating his shoulders for relief. “Where is Zachary now?”
He couldn’t take it much further than this tonight, though. He didn’t think they were on that level yet, even after one moderately productive talk. But it was the start of something, maybe.
Castiel nodded at Dean and left Dean’s suite. He shut the door behind him and placed his forehead against the door, wishing he was still in Dean’s arms with their foreheads pressed together instead.
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed heavily. “I’m good at what I do? I’ve slowly been slotted bigger and bigger cases, bigger fish to fry, but your assignment is unlike my previous ones. I maybe had the best availability.”
Cas nodded. “Maybe that’s what I need after all, a fresh start somewhere else. Maybe your father at least got that right.”
. He couldn’t help but notice the similarities between him and Castiel. ‘Alamander’ was the rough and tough poor guy who had to be rough, tough, and brawl his whole life. He took risky jobs and whatever it took to get food on the table because his father was a lazy asshole.
Castiel wasn’t even sure if he could follow through with his promise on letting her go, but Mr. Bortnik wouldn’t have a chance. Hope was a funny thing that way. It is the only thing that will keep Gleb going. It is the only thing that had kept Castiel going the past few years. It is likely the only thing keeping Dean strong right now.
He lifted up the syringe he had earlier and flicked it, ensuring any large bubbles would not make it to his blood stream. “Is that truth serum?” the man asked. Castiel chuckled, picking up the hopeful tone in his voice.
Dean laughed with a large smile. “I would love that. I definitely need more geek friends in my life.”
Dean huffed. “So you want to talk about your day? You had a long hard day of selling guns, torturing people, murdering people?” Castiel winced. Dean’s tone was heating up now.
Dean was correct, and Castiel was furious, although he was containing it well. “If you don’t have information for me, Dean Winchester, I don’t have much reason to keep you around. So you better think
As the book drew near the end, Alamander survived the war. It was miserable, he did it alone, and there wasn’t anything much better waiting for him on the other side. All of his hard work and doing everything by himself yielded no reward.
“I’m ready,” Castiel growled in a way that made Dean sure this man was going to be the death of him. They were going to have the absolute best rest of their lives together.
“Would you, uhh, like to sit by me? We can catch up?” Dean offered, gesturing to the empty row he was in.
“Well, I’m just here to help speed up the jobs. That way, anything that requires wo people, we’ll have an extra to continue to work on the third car and what not,” Dean stated.
He needed to take a deep breath and look away before he thought about the height too much. He turned over to a woman sitting in the aisle seat (thank goodness nobody as in the middle) when he noticed an image of an arrow on her left arm.
“Congratulations. Don’t worry, I’m not looking for anything,” she said before contemplating. “Well, I’m not looking for your
Castiel quickly sat up and wrapped his arms around Dean and gave him a possessive look. “I’m already going to have you all to myself. I don’t care how many men or women have touched you before, nobody’s touching you again,” he growled.
She squinted closely at the man. It looked like Castiel, but so different. His expression was unlike any other photo she’d seen of him, and he had no tattoos on his body at all, and the Castiel she knew of was the most inked up criminal she’d ever seen, and she’d seen plenty.
“Alright,” Dean doesn’t sound wholly convinced, but he shuts off the tap and carefully takes Cas’s hand again, looking at it closely. “It doesn’t look too deep. I think you’ll survive.” He glances up at Cas, grinning that cheeky sunshine grin that Cas loves so much. Cas feels a jolt run through him as their eyes meet, feels heat flood his cheeks. Dean’s hands are big and warm, making Cas’s skin tingle everywhere they touch.
“Nah, I don’t think the future’s that simple,” Dean says, “Don’t think it’s set in stone. I think it changes all the time, depending on what choices you make, who you meet.”
“I think he’s just like that with everyone,” Cas argues, defensively, “I’m not embarrassing myself or him by trying to make that more than it isn’t. Plus, he’ll probably never come in again.” Cas feels his heart sink as he says the words, desperately wanting to be wrong but also not wanting to get his hopes up when he’ll almost certainly never see Dean again.
Monday is particularly bad. By the end of his shift, Cas is exhausted and bad-tempered, and just wants to go home and curl up under his duvet before he has to do the whole thing all over again tomorrow. It’s ten minutes to closing and the café is finally empty. He’s just finished wiping down the display and has switched off the quarrelsome cappuccino machine. Drained, he retreats behind the pages of his Plath poetry book, silently praying no one else comes in before Meg finishes in the kitchen and they have the chance to lock up.
It’s raining the following evening, which accounts for why the café is surprisingly busy even half an hour before closing. Cas catches a glimpse of Dean slipping through the door in his leather jacket, cheeks glowing and hair slick with rain, but can’t offer more than a helpless smile as he rushes around serving drinks and wiping tables. Meg – who has been teasing Cas about Dean at every possible opportunity – seems to have mysteriously vanished into the stock room, which means the whole process takes a lot longer than it should.
“Oh god. I – okay, can you promise you won’t laugh at me when I tell you this?” Cas ducks his head, rubbing at the blue staining his fingertips and trying not to think about how much he wishes they were back on Dean’s skin.
“Close them,” Cas says, with slightly more authority, but Dean can see the way Cas’s fingers are trembling where he’s still holding all of their memories, their whole friendship in his hands. Cas glances down at it unreadably, like it’s suddenly fragile, and then back at Dean. He swallows, repeats, “Dean,” quietly imploring.
He finishes making Dean’s drink in silence, and hands it to him carefully. Their fingertips brush slightly and Dean’s seem to linger, a warm shock of soft heat against Cas’s. When he looks up, Dean isn’t smiling; his expression is unreadable, heavy, a little caught off guard. Almost like he’s as startled by the electricity that passes between them as Cas is.
Castiel smiles even wider, eyes bluer than ever, and, suddenly, Dean doesn’t mind one little bit if Castiel Novak is the reason he doesn’t win this competition. Although it’s far too cheesy for Dean to ever admit aloud, as he watches Cas dust flour from his bumblebee apron, cheeks flushed and eyes shining quietly, Dean feels as though he’s just won something far more important than Bake-Off.
the rush of hot blood through Cas’s veins, feel the light, airy swirl of his grace like clear water. He can taste the soft clarity of it, intriguing, compelling, familiar. He realises it’s a stronger version of the smell he associates with Cas’s hugs, and can’t help wondering if that’s what Cas’s skin would taste like under his tongue. The thought draws him in almost as much as the blood pumping just beneath it.
“I don’t mind,” Cas’s tone is light, obliging, far nicer than Dean deserves. He hears Cas set down a bowl and then there are footsteps approaching.
“You’re different this morning,” Dean raises an eyebrow, leans against the counter as he watches Cas put the bagels into the food bin.
Involuntarily, Dean groans darkly at the thought of biting into Cas’s skin, the ache for the blood he can hear humming through Cas’s veins almost overwhelming.
“You said that a moment ago,” Dean searches Cas’s gaze, voice low, “And now you’re here. Please, Cas. I need you close, I need – I promise I won’t go all twilight on your ass,” he throws out desperately, hoping with everything he has that’s true. He doesn’t entirely trust the pointy little fangs that have definitely grown even more in the last few moments – but he trusts what he feels for Cas. Always. Above anything. “I just – I need you, Cas.”
“Where do you work?” Cas asks, curious. Usually with the people who come in, he’s pretty good at guessing their professions – but this guy is unreadable in a way that shouldn’t fit with his seemingly open, cocksure persona. Cas kind of likes that about him, that he can’t quite figure him out. It makes him want to even more.
“But,” he takes a deep breath, tries to steady himself, “I wanted to give you more, Cas, I always wanted to – I just didn’t think – I always thought it was impossible, I always told myself you didn’t feel the way you do.” Dean swallows, “Because how could you? You’re this incredible angelic being and I’m –
After Cas has gone, he often places his hand over the space there. It becomes a habit he stops noticing, a way of soothing himself when nothing else can, when he’s lost, afraid of his own reflection as though he can see the memories etched into his skin. There’s nothing there now, when he looks, just pores that Cas once put back together.
, Cas,” he swallows, darkened gaze following the mirrored movement in Cas’s own throat and he lets out a soft, involuntary moan. “God – it’s – everything is so much louder, like this,” he says breathlessly, “I can’t – Cas – please.”
Dean answers the question by leaning in as kissing him, long and slow. Cas lets out a soft sigh and melts into it like he’s been waiting for this moment even longer than Dean. They kiss like that, tender and longing, wrapped up in each other, until they’re both breathless and Dean’s heart feels like it might burst. When they pull apart for air, Cas is breathing heavily and his cheeks are flushed pink, eyes so full of heat and affection Dean doesn’t know what do with it except lean in and kiss him again, deeper this time, tangling his hands in Cas’s tousled hair and groaning a little against Cas’s mouth at the feel of it.
And Dean, helpless, leans across the bench, grabs Castiel a little roughly by the front of his apron, and crushes their mouths together. Castiel’s lips are powder-soft and warm, and he lets out this soft noise of surprise when Dean kisses him. For a moment, he’s unresponsive, and Dean automatically goes to pull away – but then Castiel’s hands, dusty with flour, cover Dean’s where they’re fisted in the front of Castiel’s apron, holding them in place.
Cas has always looked a little devastating. Rumpled dark hair that makes him look like he’s just been thoroughly fucked, and those intense, deep stares that make Dean forget his own name. But lately – lately, Cas has become a whole other thing. The dishevelled hair has acquired an artful, tousled look, and he takes off his trench coat sometimes, showing off the strong, lean lines of his torso and the slender angles of his hips. Sometimes, if it’s warm, he even rolls his sleeves up. It’s driving Dean a little bit crazy.
It’s gloomy and dark outside and they’re making dinner together at Dean’s apartment. Nothing fancy, just stir fry with rice. Cas had stopped to pick up some groceries after his last seminar, and the rain from his walk is still slightly damp in his hair even though Dean had chucked him a towel and bundled him into one of his old sweaters when Cas arrived. The radio is burbling in the background, and Cas is busy chopping peppers and aubergine, the sleeves of Dean’s sweater rolled up. Dean is dancing absent-mindedly in the background to some cliché indie hit as he stirs the ingredients in. It’s comforting, familiar. Something they’ve done a thousand times before.
The next thing Cas is aware of is Dean’s arms around him, both of them breathing unsteadily against each other. They’re sitting on the kitchen floor against the cabinet, clothes scattered around them in disarray. With a rush of heat, Cas sees the pink floral panties lying tangled near his thigh.
“Oh god, please don’t tell me you read my annotations,” Cas groans, putting his face in his hands, “They’re just nonsense. I just scribble down whatever comes into my head as I’m reading and then put it into more coherent notes later.”
“I’m fine,” Dean says, tightly, shoving the tub of currants away and cursing as it decides to tip itself over again, small black currants spilling all over the bench.
, to see Sammy growing up” Dean breaks off momentarily, shakes his head like he’s trying to surface from deep water. Cas notes the set of Dean’s jaw, the way his knuckles are white around the wheel, resists the urge to reach out, soften them.
.” He wants to seize Cas, crush him in a hug and never let go, tell him all the things he never got to over and over again, but he can only stare. His universe tilts on its axis, the heat of Cas’s hand the only thing grounding him to here, now.
with his blue eyes dark and serious in the muted light of Dean’s bedroom, staring unflinchingly, intensely at Dean like he’s all that exists. And god – Dean can
“Yeah, that’s why you ask him out?” Meg rolls her eyes again. “You know, so you can get to know him? God, for such a big nerd you really are stupid.”
“I think they’re right at the back,” Dean grumbles from the depths of the cupboard, back muscles straining beneath his black t-shirt. “Hold on.” He leans forward into the cupboard, shirt riding up – and Cas catches another glimpse of pastel pink lace. Cas feels as though the ground has suddenly fallen away beneath him. He stares helplessly at the dainty floral contrasted against the masculine sharpness of Dean’s hipbone, heart racing. Cas swallows desperately, trying not to imagine how Dean looks in them, how the satin must feel against his skin. It’s just about the hottest thing Cas has ever seen.
Cas is silent. There’s a pause that might be a single heartbeat or the whole last ten years, and then there’s warm, tentative pressure against Dean’s mouth. Cas’s lips, silken soft and hot, brushing tenderly, slowly, against his. Cas’s hands cupping his face, rough and warm and trembling, holding him still as the world spins away into nothing. Cas’s breath, gentle and unsteady against Dean’s mouth, punctuating the kiss.
Dean’s heart does something complicated in his chest, and his eyes flicker open to see Cas standing in front of him. His expression is full of concern, all the smitey seductiveness gone.
“What would you recommend?” his gaze falls on Cas suddenly, deep, complex green flecked with quiet hues of honey and hazel, so striking it takes Cas’s breath away all over again.
, whispered in Castiel’s ear, over and over again, as though saying it often enough would make it true. One night, barely audible;
Cas can feel the weight of Dean’s gaze on him as he makes the tea, tries not to let the heat creeping up his cheeks take over. He glances up and finds Dean’s eyes on him, pensive and full of familiar warmth, can’t help the smile that spreads across his face in response.
They lapse into easy silence, the sun-soaked road unfolding in front of them – and then Dean makes the colossal mistake of glancing in the mirror. He feels his stomach somersault; Cas’s gaze is boring into his, vivid blue and fucking
A sudden thrill washes over Dean as he realises that Cas is affected by this conversation in some way, affected by seeing Dean like this, aching for Cas more openly than he’s ever dared. Even amidst the dark lust slowly taking him over, the blurring, disorientating new sensations, Dean feels hope well up, as clear and pure as sunlight.
“No,” Cas admits, trying to ignore the way his heart is thumping. “But technically, we’re closed now. So, I’m no longer a barista. Just a guy who’s spent way too much time around coffee to want to think about any more than strictly necessary.”
“Are you alright?” Cas’s voice is low and gravelly, the timbre of it sending shivers all through Dean. Cas is leaning forward in his chair, brow furrowed slightly as he regards Dean, wild-eyed and straining against his restraints.
Naively, Cas had once thought that the more time he spent with Dean, the easier it’d be to get over how ridiculously hot he is. And okay, it’s true, Cas is now (mostly) past the stage of blushing every time Dean looks at him or forgetting how to speak when Dean leans back on the sofa and stretches. But instead, Cas is reminded on a daily basis of not only how absurdly beautiful Dean is, but also what an incredible person he is. Dean is unexpected, outspoken and loyal, a little reckless, surprisingly vulnerable. He’s easily the best friend Cas has ever had. Whenever Dean knows Cas is stressed out about assignments, he’ll study diligently at his side in the library all night for moral support, regardless of whether he has any deadlines himself. He plays his Dad’s old Zeppelin and Stones records far too loudly on Cas’s vinyl player and asks Cas questions no one else has ever bothered to ask and is just this secure, dependable presence in his life Cas never knew he needed.
When they eventually part, the sun around them has melted into a honeyed glow and Cas’s hands linger on him, like he doesn’t want to let go. They look at each other in the soft evening light, and there’s all the smouldering heat of the last several weeks in Cas’s gaze, but also something softer, something so earnest it makes Dean’s heart fumble a beat. Cas with smouldering seductiveness darkening his blue gaze had been a lot to take. But, Dean realises, Cas like this, eyes shining with quiet happiness, is the most devastating of all.
But Dean has been struggling to bring himself to speak to Cas, because, although he’d never admit it aloud, he kind of likes it. Being able to live – however briefly – in the illusion that Cas wants him as much as Dean has tried not to want him for so long. Dean knows Cas doesn’t really want him, that it’s just some muddled up angel-to-human mannerisms that have got confused, but it’s still surprisingly let go of. Especially when Cas seems to only do it around him; Dean hasn’t noticed other people getting flustered around Cas. Sam would definitely have brought it up with Cas if he’d done it with him. So, although he knows it’s illogical, maybe there’s this a tiny part of Dean that hopes the way Cas has started looking at him means something else, something Dean has never let himself think about. It’s all becoming a bit of a car crash.
“It’s very lovely,” Cas manages, still addressing the girls as he’s unable to move at all. He wonders if he’s blushing from the outrageous enjoyment on their faces, but he tries to remain at least a little stoic for Dean’s sake. “I don’t recognize it.”
Somewhere in the back of his mind he registers a chuckle, and he remembers with an irritated pop that they have an audience. Dean turns his head to shoot a nasty glare at his alternate self, who’s watching them with too much amusement and not nearly enough fear.
Cas nods once after a long moment, seeming awkward. Dean tries not to be viciously glad. “Yes, my true name is Castiel. I believe the alternates of me rescue you from the pit in most universes.”
Dean can’t decide between hurling, hiding under his blankets, or searching out the nearest bad thing to kill. Like his pretentious counterpart, for instance.
He nearly makes it to the kitchen when he hears all too familiar voices: Cas, who sounds two octaves too high, and the other Dean, who’s speaking in low, fucking dulcet tones.
He tries to remember why he ever thought doing this with Cas would be the wrong move because he’s kissed a lot of people and it’s never been like
“I don’t,” Dean blurts out before he realizes what he’s about to say. A low hum starts echoing in his ears. “We, uh. If you’d done that, we probably wouldn’t know each other. Like this. And honestly, having you in my life was… well, worth the trade off.”
Dean releases him a little so Cas can turn in his chair. Dean doesn’t move any further, though, stays hovered over him and closer than they’ve ever been in public. He snags Cas’s wrist from where it’s laid on top of the table and he squeezes pointedly.
Cas supposes he’s the one hesitating because he’s admittedly terrified of messing up a single step when it comes to Dean.
Cas groans his name as they move together, touching everywhere in reach, and Dean feels like he’s gone haywire. Grabbing Cas by the back of his firm ass that he always knew existed, Dean grinds in harder, delighting in the broken noises Cas makes each time. He’s vocal and loud, and Dean fucking loves it.
Dean’s eyes never leave his once. Cas can’t look away either, captured. They dance easily, Dean guiding him with grace and no trace of self-consciousness. He securely brings them across the floor, and while he has no basis for comparison, Cas finds himself enraptured in the glide.
Quietly Dean croons along with a couple of the lines, only for him to hear, his voice like velvet. Cas has always secretly loved hearing him sing,  and the adoring words sink into him like afternoon sunlight.
“You were worth it, too,” Cas says quietly, the familiar tension between them starting to crackle again, and Dean admittedly fucking swoons.
“Hey,” Dean half rumbles, half yells in his ear, pressing his face right into Cas’s hair. The warmth of Dean sends a tremor down his frame, even with a chair between them. “I put this song on.”
Dean’s ferocity drips down like wax as the kiss quickly turns tender, so damn sweet. He presses in even tighter, wrapping his other arm around Cas, relishing the warmth that spreads through him. Cas twists his fingers into Dean’s shirt and kisses him back so nicely, tasting of honey, and Dean could honestly cry.
Cas looks so damn sad, though, eyes still cast down. He sighs, scratching at the stitching of his pants. “You seemed aggravated after he said he never went. That I saved him from the demon.”
Cas tenses for the briefest of heart stopping seconds before melting beautifully into Dean, into the kiss completely.
In an outraged burst, Dean marches to his door, not sure exactly what he’s about to do but intent on ending the other Dean’s offensive charade at the very least. He rips the hinges open and – instantly deflates.
After an unsuspicious time has passed, Dean excuses himself from the table, shoving back his chair loudly. He throws his plate into the sink with a clang for someone else to wash, pours himself an extra-large whiskey, and stomps to his bedroom, complete with a door slam.
He takes a quick second to whip off his shirt and another to gather an extra ounce of nerve. They should probably slow down, maybe, talk about the magnitude of this between them, but Dean wasn’t kidding when he said he’s waited long enough. He has no idea what’s going to happen after but fuck if he isn’t going to enjoy it while he can.
. “Holy shit, Cas,” he says around a grin, wrapping his arms around Cas’s shoulders to bring him back close, where he belongs. “You broke all the lights.”
Their kiss ends but they don’t separate, foreheads still pressed together, and they finish the song like that, just breathing each other in. Cas isn’t sure what they’re doing counts as dancing anymore but doesn’t care, thinks he could spend the next millennia right here easily.
Alternate world Dean missed the fuck out, but he doesn’t get a do over. This is right. These pretty blue eyes belong to him.
He should say… something. Anything. The opportunity presents itself like an outstretched hand, but his mouth goes cotton dry and he can’t seem to remember how to form a single word.
Cas stays silent, his preoccupied gaze on the empty space between them. Dean’s palms begin to sweat as the moment ticks on, because clearly Cas is working himself up to say something. He has a quick moment of horror where he wonders if Cas is about to ask for his blessing, although he realizes that’s absurd. Cas would never. Hopefully.
“I know you tried your best, Cas,” Dean manages, aching from the idea Cas didn’t give up on him for a decade when they hadn’t even known each other yet, and he still hasn’t, another decade later. Dean tries to give him a reassuring smile. “All that matters is that you did find me. You saved me.”
Despite facing god and the devil and everything in between, Dean will always be the one who overwhelms him like none other.
Dean guides them through the tables, passing some all too knowing expressions that Cas resolutely does not acknowledge, to an open space near the jukebox. Even though he’s had a human form for some time now, Cas still isn’t used to how his heartbeat thrums loud in his ears alongside the bass. He’s sure Dean can feel the slight tremble under his skin.
Cas surges against him, recapturing him into a kiss that quickly turns searing. Dean runs his hands down Cas’s chest slowly, and they both groan out loud as Cas rocks his hips back into Dean’s. Cas is
Dean pauses, knowing he’s blushing, stays tucked into Cas’s neck to hide his embarrassment. “No. Yes. No,” he mumbles. The douchebag was undeniably the catalyst, but Cas has to know this has been building and compounding between them for a dozen years, bound to burst eventually. Surely he knows that.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he deliberates a peak at their audience, not necessarily nervous of their reaction but struck at the disbelief. He’d fully resigned himself long ago that things like this could never, would never happen, and now here it is, displayed for everyone to witness too.
Then Purgatory happened, and the part of Dean that he tried to keep tucked away broke out and came at him with a baseball bat. It sure as hell knocked some sense into him regarding the scope of his feelings for Cas, which are more extensive than ever, to say the least. The kind of extensive that makes him want to confess,
“It’s my kitchen,” Dean bites back and then gives Cas a pointed stare. He’s not even thinking at this point, rage boiling. He says the first thing that comes to mind. “Are you coming back to bed?”
He can taste how close Cas is to coming. He couldn’t even guess how many times he’s imagined what Cas would look like, what he’d taste like, can’t believe he’s about to find out. Dean gazes up at his angel’s pretty blue eyes again, and he’s almost sure Cas hasn’t looked away the whole time. He pulls off just barely despite the whine of protest.
He sighs into Cas’s mouth and pulls back a bit to check his expression. Cas blinks at him with his pretty blue eyes, dazed and kind of blissed out if Dean had to guess, and Dean has to grin a little.
From the other end of The Roadhouse, Castiel can tell that Dean has definitely toed over the tipsy line. His eyes shine brighter, his smile stretched wide and unrestrained. He ruffles Kevin’s hair more than once as they play darts against Sam and Ash, much to the boy’s amused exasperation. Dean’s voice grows louder, livelier, especially as it becomes clear they might win against all odds.
Cas sighs, a quiet content sound. He leaves his palm on Dean’s arm when he brings their mouths back together into the sweetest kiss yet.
Dean stays silent, which the dumb fuck mistakenly takes as a victory. The wrong Dean turns back to Cas, actually putting his hand on Cas’s waist, and Dean – well.
“Don’t – don’t read my notes now,” Cas crosses the room, takes the book from Dean’s hands and closes it. “Not when I’m here.”
Dean’s smiling too, he realises, so wide it should hurt but it doesn’t. He winces fleetingly at the sharp point of the needle again, but it soon fades into the background. The muscles in Cas’s forearms are taut, tensed under their ink. Dean looks at the constellation points of ursa major, two lines of Latin poetry, the wildflowers. It doesn’t do anything to help his current state, looking at Cas’s soft, warm skin, picturing it against his on these sheets. Knowing that Cas wants that now too, that it’s not just a fantasy. That maybe Cas has fantasised about him like this too. Dean has to bite his lip against a groan as Cas’s grip tightens slightly, blue ink slowly blossoming under his fingertips.
“Do I take your order to mean you’ve been converted to the superior hot beverage?” Cas asks, high on the thrill that Dean’s really standing in front of him the way he’s been hoping for all day. Somehow, he’s even more absurdly attractive than Cas remembered.
,” he sighs, hand quickening on Dean’s cock. Dean is so fucking turned on he can barely think straight, can only thrust up helplessly into Castiel’s fist and jerk Castiel harder, faster, until he’s whining against Dean’s neck, the hand that isn’t working Dean’s cock gripping Dean’s shoulder tight enough to bruise.
Dean is on his feet immediately, instincts sharper than ever – but then he freezes. His face is swathed in shadow, but Castiel can see the faint stars reflected in the green of his gaze.
By the time things have died down a little, Cas finds Dean leaning against the counter in his usual spot, nose buried in a book.
Cas pulls back a little and looks up, this time watching Dean’s face contort in pleasure as he swallows him down again.
“Yes you fucking can,” Meg argues, wiping her black and purple hair down with a tea towel. “He’s coming by tomorrow, right? Ask him out then.”
“Alright?” Cas’s low, gravelly voice breaks Dean’s spiralling thoughts. He glances up fleetingly, a flash of dark blue that has Dean’s heart racing. They’ve been friends for years now, but the rush is still the same, the thrill of being this close to Cas. Fleetingly, he wonders if it’ll ever change.
“Cas,” Dean gasps, hand twisting in Cas’s hair. His hips are still moving in small, aborted movements and he smells incredible, warm and musky under the smooth satin and swirled lace of his panties. “Cas,” breathless, this time, “Please.”
A rush of uncertainty hits Cas, suddenly disorientated by how quickly everything happened, how fast his entire world just turned upside down in all the ways he’s longed for but never believed would happen. Images flash through his mind: the low pull of heat he felt at the sight of that pink lace against Dean’s skin; the oblivion of kissing Dean for the first time; Dean’s gaze on him, warm and heavy and full of something like hope. Cas feels his stomach somersault. But then he’s hit with an awful sinking feeling. Dean fucks a lot of people. Cas can’t help suddenly wondering if this was just another spur of the moment impulse on Dean’s part, if maybe Cas somehow read more into the gentle touches and intent eyes because of how long he’s wanted this. Maybe –
In his coat pocket, he can feel the outline of the little peppermint tin where their heartbeats edge closer to each other. He smiles against Dean’s mouth, loves that he’ll never be able to taste peppermint without remembering this; the shine of Dean’s eyes in the muted December lights, the heat of their bodies pressed together, the sky frozen and empty overhead, a blank canvas for their own stars.
Because – okay – if Dean sometimes finds himself attracted to Cas under normal circumstances (i.e. being human), it’s nothing to how he feels right now. Cas looks fucking
“I know who you are,” Cas says, warmly, and Dean knows that he does, knows that Cas understands him better than anyone else ever could. Knows that Cas put him back together, pore by pore, freckle by freckle, that Cas knows the pattern of his ribs and the colour of his soul. The thought of being known so completely and so intimately had terrified him once, but he finds it comforts him now, under the vast canopy of stars.
Cas swallows, trying to ignore the low, heavy ache between his legs as he pulls at the elastic of Dean’s panties again, thumbing at the skin under it as he looks up imploringly at Dean. Dean, for his part, looks as wrecked as Cas feels.
“You look incredible,” Cas blurts, and then blushes profusely. He ducks hastily to rescue the fallen bagels, grateful for the opportunity to hide his red face. “Uh – I mean. You look very. Professional. Very. Yes. Sorry.” When he braves a look at Dean, Dean’s gaze is twinkling with warm amusement, and he’s holding a small stack of bagels, having obviously retrieved the ones Cas had missed. “Oh,” Cas mumbles, awkwardly, and takes the proffered bagels gratefully, feeling his stomach flip at the soft warmth of Dean’s fingers against his for a moment, “Thank you.”
“Very festive,” Dean remarks as Cas closes the door behind them, noting the multi-coloured fairy lights Cas has strewn around the window, glowing softly and casting the room into muted colours. Dean secretly prefers Cas’s room to his; he’s spent so much time in it over the years that it feels just as much like home, maybe even a little more because it has Cas in it.
“Cas,” Dean shakes his head, overwhelmed by the same fear and wonder that had coursed through him the first time he looked at that handprint on his shoulder, “I love you.”
on the counter between them, white dust exploding out of it in a soft cloud that settles over both of them like snow.
In other words, Cas is far more head over heels for Dean now than he’s ever been. He tries to ignore the quiet, unstoppable elation that wells up inside him whenever they’re together, though, because he knows Dean doesn’t see him like that. Cas contents himself with just being Dean’s friend, and it’s more than enough, most of the time. He’s learnt to ignore the way Dean still makes him smile wider than he means, makes his heart beat faster, his cheeks flush with heat. He’s got it all under control. As much as anyone can have falling in love with their best friend under control, anyway. Under control enough that Dean would never know how he really feels, which is what counts.
The guy laughs then, teeth white and even, head thrown back, so beautiful Cas’s stomach does another little somersault. “I’m sure that’s not what you’re meant to say to your customers,” he raises an eyebrow, amusement still twinkling in his green gaze.
“You’re very demanding,” Cas admonishes, handing the book back to Dean and crossing the room to sit down on one end of the window seat, curling up like a cat. There’s a twinkle of amusement in his blue gaze, but he pulls the sleeves of his jumper down over his hands, something Dean knows he only does when he’s nervous. The thought makes a pang of nerves curl through Dean too, although he doesn’t know why, doesn’t know why it feels like they’re waiting for something.
A sudden rustle in the clearing drags Castiel’s gaze away from the sky, and his gaze snaps towards the open space, defences immediately going up.
you, Cas,” Dean says, because it’s wonderful to say it, better than breathing. “God, I love you.” He reaches up with his free hand and touches Cas’s jaw. Cas looks at him like he’s looking at everything in the whole universe all at once, and then they’re kissing and there's no fear, just wonder. Dizzying, pure elation. Like breathing after years underwater, like the feel of the sun on skin after a lifetime of night. Cas’s mouth is heat and oblivion. His hand grips Dean’s, both of them covering the space on his shoulder that once bore Cas’s angelic imprint. Dean can feel the warmth of their hands together, the heat of Cas’s skin over the space that has always been his.
If it weren’t for Castiel Novak, Dean knows he’d easily win this competition. Castiel Novak with his stupid messy hair and serious eyes and long, skilled fingers. Castiel Novak and his insufferable ability to bake the fluffiest angel cakes when Dean burns all his in the oven.
Despite still feeling flustered and embarrassed, Cas can’t help smiling. “Green tea, specifically. Green tea with jasmine.”
Reluctantly, Cas shakes his head. “He’s got a big interview tomorrow. I don’t want to upset him.” He rubs foam off his chin.
Cas swallows, heart pounding. He can’t seem to find his voice. It’s embarrassing how hard he is over his best friend in a pair of lace panties.
Cas’s blue gaze flickers up to catch his, amused and reassuring all at once. “Dean. You’ve watched me do this plenty of times.” It’s true: Cas trained as a tattoo apprentice for part of his art course last semester, and since then has informally tattooed a bunch of their friends at parties, as well as himself. Dean has been pestering him to give him one for months.
Heart heavy in his chest, Cas turns his back on the empty café and starts wiping down the cappuccino machine more vigorously than is strictly necessary.
Cas lets out a muffled sound as Dean kisses him, warm and impulsive and perfect. He tastes faintly of green jasmine tea and his hands come up to cup Cas’s face, surprisingly gentle. They kiss like that for a long moment in the early morning sunshine, tentatively wrapped up in each other until Cas’s heart feels so full it could burst.
“Oh, you know, the usual. I’m seeing my nerdy kid brother tonight, he’s home for a couple days from Stanford,” Dean is leaning on the counter, watching Cas prepare his tea with what seems to be genuine interest.
Feeling flustered, Dean makes a grab for a bag of rice flour and starts measuring out into his mixing bowl. After a moment, he makes the colossal mistake of glancing up to see if Castiel is still there, and finds Castiel’s blue gaze still on him. The intensity of it runs through Dean like a shock, and he promptly fumbles the bag of flour in his hands. It slips from his grasp and lands with a heavy
Cas rolls his eyes right back at Dean and rolls up the sleeves of his vintage patterned shirt, exposing the intricate ink on his own arms. “Alright, give me your arm, then.”
Cas glances up, finds the guy’s eyes on him like he’s genuinely interested. “Yes,” he pulls out a takeaway cup, “Just the afternoon shift though. I have lectures in the mornings.”
“Well, I’d better get going. Wish me luck,” Dean grins, but it’s a slightly complicated thing, like he’s worried he didn’t say the right thing. He stuffs the last bite of muffin into his mouth, and then wipes it with the napkin Cas had wrapped around the cup before tossing it and the muffin wrapper in the trash. Cas’s heart sinks, and, stupidly, he feels a lump rise in his throat even though he knows Dean has no idea what he’s just accidentally thrown away.
Hesitantly, Dean holds it out and Cas’s fingers grasp it reassuringly, warm and dexterous and familiar. His heart rate picks up further, not entirely from the prospect of being tattooed for the first time. Swallowing, he watches Cas swab his bicep with alcohol and pick up the marker that’s sitting on Dean’s bedspread.
Something in Cas’s expression flickers, but he doesn’t move. “You can sense my grace? Even through the scent of my blood?”
They’re still wrapped up in each other when their breathing finally slows, and Dean feels distinctly sticky and slightly nervous again. Uncertainly, he pulls away from Castiel to tuck himself back into his pants and pull his jeans up, hands trembling slightly. There are floury smudges on his jeans from Castiel unbuttoning them, and there’s a very visible white floury handprint on the black fabric of his shoulder where Castiel had gripped him as though he was the only thing that existed.
“Thanks,” Dean takes the book of the shelf and flips through the pages, catches a few flashes of Cas’s dextrous scrawl.
“Don’t what?” Dean twists against his confines, beside himself. Cas’s heartbeat resounds through the silence between them, faster than before.
A flood of heat washes through him when he finds Cas’s gaze already on him, heavy and blue and doing that devastating smitey smouldery thing that makes Dean’s insides feel all fluttery. He swallows unsteadily, fiddles with a few fries. Cas’s eyes darken, and his tongue comes out, wetting his bottom lip in a gesture that’s so blatantly sexual Dean feels his cock twitch in his pants again. He shifts in his seat awkwardly, but Cas just holds his gaze like he knows exactly what this is doing to Dean, like he wants to slowly drive Dean wild. His blue eyes are quiet and intense, full of something that looks so much like undisguised longing it’s more than Dean can handle.
“I very much hope that’s true this year,” Cas says, quiet in a way that makes Dean catch his breath, inexplicably nervous too. He’s looking down, still fiddling with the stray thread from the cuff of his jumper. His expression is uncharacteristically vulnerable in the soft light, messy dark hair and wide eyes so blue that they make Dean’s heart fumble a beat in his chest when Cas suddenly looks up, holds Dean’s gaze. It’s very quiet, the space between them. Dean feels very aware of his heart, doesn’t know why it’s suddenly going quite so fast. “You go first,” Cas says, low, eyes intent and full of
“Well, that year we were stuck in here all Christmas day while Dad was wrapping up a hunt. Sammy was old enough to know it was Christmas, so it kind of sucked. But I got Sammy singing Christmas songs and we drew stupid snowmen cartoons on the windows, and it was okay, we passed the time. Dad was gone so long we ended up eating most of the candy canes while we were waiting, but Sammy insisted on saving the last one for Dad. He still hero-worshipped Dad at that point, even though Dad was barely a father to him – was barely even
Outside, it’s cold, the dark biting at Cas’s skin as he waits for Dean to return from the kiosk. He leans against the cool, smooth metal of the impala, stares skywards for a while. It’s cloudy, the sky is swollen with snow. Cas likes not being able to see the heavens, sometimes. On days like this, earth is full enough of wonder all by itself. The greasy spill of gas station lights on frozen concrete, a little metal box of memories in his pocket, Dean’s footsteps echoing through the quiet towards him. The lights of heaven could never compare.
“Please, Cas,” Dean is breathing hard, flushed cheeks and heavy-lidded eyes as he gazes down at Cas. Cas stares back up at him, tracing his touch wonderingly along the jut of Dean’s hip, the little freckles gathered there like some secret constellation. Dean obligingly pulls his shirt over his head and lets Cas explore his skin further, the dip of his bellybutton, the hard muscles clenching and unclenching under the soft skin of his stomach. He follows them to the buckle of Dean’s belt, hesitating.
Cas nods, pouring boiling water onto the tea leaves. “Yes, we don’t see each other much though. My family is –” he waves a hand dismissively, “Complicated.” He closes his mouth abruptly, embarrassed at the honesty Dean seems to elicit so automatically in him.
“Okay,” Dean grins, stroking his thumb over Cas’s softly before letting go. “Now I really do have to go. See you soon, Cas.”
“You’re going to amazingly, you know.” Dean glances up to find Castiel looking at him with quiet warmth. “You’re so talented, Dean,” he says, and there’s nothing but complete sincerity in his words, like Dean isn’t a total asshole and he’s actually rooting for him. Dean’s heart suddenly feels warm, beating uncomfortably fast in his chest.
Outside, the warm evening air fills his lungs as he gulps it down breathlessly, trying to regain some kind of control over himself. He leans against the wall and shuts his eyes, letting the golden glow of the sun against his skin ground him. It’s been weeks of this, weeks of having Cas look at him the way Dean has always wanted him to while it doesn’t mean anything. It’s all too much, how easy it’s been to indulge himself in the illusion that Cas could feel the same as he does. Dean feels as though he’s hit breaking point, but he doesn’t know where to go. All he knows is he can’t go on ignoring this, pretending it’s okay anymore when it’s slowly driving him mad and breaking his heart all at once.
“I think you do yourself a disservice,” Cas tells him, more confidently than he feels. “You don’t seem straightforward to me. I don’t think anyone is.”
The colour is high on Dean’s cheeks as he shakes his head, “No. I think I’d rather have yours, actually.” And before Cas can say anything, Dean’s lips are suddenly on his, soft and warm, so warm in the cold air. Cas feels as though he’s been holding his breath for years and is suddenly able to breathe. It’s wonderful, the heat of Dean’s mouth against his, the slick of his tongue twining with Cas’s, tasting of peppermint and making something hot curl deep in Cas’s stomach. His hands are cupping Cas’s face, rough skin, tender touch. Cas is breathing hard when Dean pulls back, both of their breath clouding the December air between them. “Tastes better on you,” Dean grins, and it’s a beautiful thing, tentative and free here in the cold without heaven watching.
Dean forgets the flour and the spilled currants and the fact they’re a handful of hours away from the biggest competition of his life, and loses himself in the gentle, firm warmth of Cas mouth. Castiel tastes faintly of marzipan and kisses with the same quiet, relentless intensity that he seems to do everything else. Dean’s kind of crazy about it. They kiss until they’re both breathless, Castiel letting out these soft half-moans against Dean’s mouth that are driving Dean a little bit wild. He suddenly feels very aware of the bench separating them.
Dean’s cheeks are pink with the cold now too. “Uh – yeah, it is, I guess.” He’s looking at Cas intently in the muted lights of the deserted gas station, with an expression that is familiar yet unreadable and makes Cas feel warm even in the cold.
“Of course,” Cas hears himself saying, even though it’s definitely past closing now. He frowns, “Are you sure that’s what you want, though? You don’t look wildly enthusiastic about the prospect. I can turn on the coffee machine, it’s no trouble.” He doesn’t know what makes him say it. It undoubtedly would be trouble, and the last thing he wants is for the cappuccino machine to explode all over them both, but somehow he just can’t stand the idea of this guy walking out, can’t stand the prospect of never seeing him again even though he’s only known him ten minutes.
“Hey,” Dean smiles stupidly, suddenly feeling self-conscious as he steps into the hallway. It’s warm and smells faintly of incense and home-baking, but they don’t linger, heading straight up the stairs to Cas’s room as usual.
Cas hates his job. Admittedly, the prospect of serving coffee for eight hours a day in a busy campus coffee shop probably isn’t any introvert’s idea of fun. But it’s not the constant noise and bustle which bothers Cas the most about working at the Moose & Squirrel. It’s not even the fact he has to wear an apron covered in tiny bumblebees, or that the cappuccino machine breaks and spitefully spits hot foam everywhere on a pretty much hourly basis. The thing that makes Cas hate his job is how invisible it makes him feel (no mean feat for a grown man wearing a bumblebee apron and covered in hot foam).
“Cas,” Meg grips him by the shoulders, “I know you have the self-esteem of a turnip, but surely even you can see that he’s into you? He’s been hitting on you
Cas groans, leaning his head against Dean’s hipbone and mouthing at his cock, feeling it twitch against his lips. “Me too,” he murmurs against Dean’s skin, arousal throbbing through him at the thought Dean is as affected by this as he is, that Dean’s feeling this same, overwhelming pull, this pleasure that’s so dizzyingly good it’s difficult to think straight.
“Shut up,” Cas nudges him playfully, and they end up sprawled on the floor in a tangle of limbs, laughing. Cas winds up with his cheek pressed against the discarded pink satin panties, the material soft and lacy against his skin.
“Don’t mention it,” Dean mumbles gruffly, cheeks heating up. His heart is racing, and he wants to change the subject, take the focus away from how intimate the present suddenly feels now that Cas is holding all their memories in his hands. “Anyway, enough of that. I’m glad you like it, but you know I can’t handle chick flick moments. Come on, your turn. Where’s mine?”
“Here,” Dean’s nose is pink from the cold, eyes bright as he leans back against the car beside Cas, hands him a paper packet. “Peppermint candy canes. Go on, knock yourself out.” He sticks his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket and stares up at the sky, like Cas had been moments before. Cas wonders whether Dean is comforted by the blankness too, or if he aches for the far-distant twinkling lights and their warmth, so long absent from his own life.
There’s a small queue when Dean arrives the next day, and Cas has to serve a grumbling elderly lady and a sullen teenager before he gets the opportunity to speak to Dean.
Dean can’t bear how warm his heart suddenly feels, so he does the only thing that makes sense, and leans in kisses Castiel again. Castiel lets out a soft hum of contentment, hands coming up to rest against the planes of Dean’s back, pulling him closer, holding him. This time, the kiss is more urgent, full of a kind of heat that is entirely new to Dean. It’s heartfelt and soft and a little bit desperate, and it’s pushing all kinds of buttons Dean never knew he had. He clutches Castiel closer, gasps involuntarily when Castiel’s teeth scrape across his bottom lip, sending a jolt of heat to his already aching cock. Castiel presses closer and does it again, biting down gently this time, and Dean loses it a little bit.
A smile pulls at the corner of Cas’s mouth, his eyes crinkle with quiet amusement even though the nervousness doesn’t dissipate, Dean notes. “No, it’s not your present.”
