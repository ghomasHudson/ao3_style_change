-I'm going, it's going to be a three-hour trip, you stay here and talk to Gabriel, he must know that ring that Cas, was talking about.
Dean opened the door that almost fell, made a signal for the angel, now human, to go ahead. He picked up his things and left the room, taking one last look at the chaos of that five-star motel room, still not believing that he and Castiel had made all that mess.
-Yes? - He turned to Castiel. - What's it?
Lucifer took his brother and lifted him, standing too, he looked at Dean angrily and made a hand gesture to switch places.
-He only accentuated the enchantment. He is responsible for the union, like a cupid, only more powerful. I think he was disappointed when people were not with who they were supposed to be with, so he used the ring to enhance this union.
Sam sees the address on the GPS and sends it to his brother.
-YES SIR!
Gabriel starts to smooth the cock of the hunter very slowly, making him shiver, leaving the archangel with a perverted smile on his face, then took a light bite on the extension, caressing the phallus of Sam.
-Cas, he said he was in a bar, and that Lucifer was there drunk, then I only got him talking about Lucifer, some ring and Lucifer talking to him!
-Yes, you took my grace and put it in glass, but I'm not sure where you put it.
-Winchester, get the lube and call room service.
Both were in each angel's ear, speaking hoarsely.
-Don't ask stupid questions. -He spoke with his face turned to the toilet.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Hey, Cas. You're okay?
-Sam? What happened?
-He must know you're there Cas! Get out of there. Now!
-You know what? You are at least better than Crowley.
The Winchester bit his lobe again, hearing another moan of pleasure, being stopped by the angel's hand. The blonde took the hand away.
They both stood up holding his arms.
-As if! He may be my brother, but he's distant, so he doesn't count. And you, King? Please, you just warm up the chair, that's all.
-Yo-you-you .. do you want to ... take a beating? My grace may be weak, but I still manage to beat you face to face.
-Yesterday, Friday, I was returning from a case and...
That was Lucifer's voice on the angel's phone, and then the call went dead.
-Dean!
-Okay, now how the fuck did that happen?
-Eros?
While Castiel is in taking a shower, Dean was looking for his cellphone in the middle of his clothes. A little moment of awareness made the hunter call his brother, he didn't remember exactly why, but he had to call Sammy.
-Give me the phone here. - He took it from the hunter. -Hello, yes, two champagnes, no, unfortunately, three glasses. And do you happen to have chocolate? Chocolate syrup? - He looked maliciously at the angel, who was sitting on the bed, having difficulty breathing, and Dean with a red face. -Even better. Is small? So give me two. Okay, see you later. -He turns off.
-I need some time. -Breathe deeply, turned to the refrigerator, drinking more water.
-Yes? What he is doing?
-Look, the devil giving me advice.
-We stayed, all night ... doing ... right? -He looked ashamed.
-Only if he comes back.
-Why me? You call!
-I am, but I'm not an asshole.
-Shit!
-Castiel, we want you. - Five men said, running their hands over their private parts, over their pants.
He kissed the angel's neck again, slowly taking off the beige overcoat, take off his blazer, and take off his own blouse, throwing them with the rest. Castiel looked at the hunter's naked torso, who felt the brunette's lips on his neck, kissing down his torso, each kiss was a chill that he felt, not that it was bad, on the contrary, it was very good, just the pants that it got tighter and tighter. Dean lowered his head, walking towards Castiel and kissing him, slowly lowering the angel to the bed amid so many pillows in shades of red and wine.
Dean's cheeks flushed pleasantly as Jack winked at Sam who tried, unsuccessfully, to suppress another chuckle. Dean collected himself. "Jeez, are you always like this?"
"I guess," Sam said. "You coming?"
"Wait a minute. Do you have feelings for me?" Dean asked. "I thought that I was just another human to you. I never believed what the other angels said. You kept leaving me. You didn’t trust me. I thought you just wanted to get your angel wings back. Then you thought you were going on a date with Nora."
"Well, whatever he is, he isn't getting off that chair any time soon."
Dean didn’t want to answer. He didn’t want to acknowledge that Cas had gone too – this time forever.
Dean began to undress Jake. "Oh, you are stinky," he said. "Just like Sammy used to be when he was little, and believe me even that gigantor was small once." Dean put the diaper to one side and waited for Cas to return.
"I don't think they were supposed to be. Cas seemed surprised in more ways than one."
“We’re okay. But everyone else has gone. There’s not another person left in the world. Something took them all. Where’s Cas?”
"Would that be so bad?" Dean asked quietly.
"But, but,  you kissed Meg. I thought you... I didn't think you'd...And what happened? All that light. I, I don't... Now. who's the assbutt?"
"But you told me to go on the date. I thought that you wanted me to. Didn’t you want me to?"
Cas watched, bewildered, as Nora ran around the room checking things like her hair and make-up before finally putting on her coat. The single red rose Dean had suggested he bring remained inside his coat. He had no idea what to say. Nora kissed his cheek.
"You don't believe all this, do you?" Jared asked.
"Bobby, thank God. That is you, isn't it? Cas has disappeared again and left us here." Bobby doused them both in water.
‘God ordered me to save you. It was the last thing he said to me before he disappeared. He told me to look after you and Sam, so I have.’
"Who the hell is Jim?" Bobby asked irritably. "And I said move, you idjits. We need to get you in the panic room and ward it against angels as well as everything else. If Crowley gets a sniff of what's going on, he could turn up as well."
"Sadly not the time travelling bit, but it'll still manage some things." He brought his hands around to the front with a flourish. "As you can see, a little resonation, and the ability to break bones can be very useful. It hurts like hell, but then I fix quickly, especially if I get killed again." He watched as Dean took a step backwards and pulled out a gun. "If you're going to shoot me, do it now. I won't stay dead, but it's quicker than waiting for the bones to knit together again. Oh, and why am I wet?"
"The only one who gets his ass on a plate is Misha. Isn't that so, Jensen?'
"Who's Misha?" Bobby asked.
Dean let out the breath he hadn’t realised that he’d been holding. ‘She sounds nice.’ He looked at the man in front of him. Who could blame the woman taking the opportunity to sleep with him?
“Death or Chuck took everyone. Bobby, Charlie,” Sam said. “Even those not from other worlds. Donna’s gone too.”
Jack sighed. "Look, I get that you hunt bad guys and demons, but I'm on the side of the angels – a good guy. I stopped the
"We certainly do," Jack confirmed.
"Come on Jake, your mother says you like this one. It’s your favourite. Please eat something and be quiet." But Jake’s mouth stayed resolutely shut until Cas turned to see what else was in the fridge, then the crying began again and the jar was swept onto the floor. By the time he’d opened five more jars, there was food everywhere. He’d managed to get some vegetable casserole into Jake’s mouth, but the rest was in Cas’ hair along with some of the custard. For a small child, Jake could spit quite far. A circle of rejected food surrounded the chair. Cas sat in the adjacent chair, his head in his hands. There was only one thing left to do.
Cas knew very little about babies, but perhaps he’d be lucky. He removed his coat then his tie, putting it in his pocket. He knew he was way too well dressed for babysitting. Oh well, there was nothing else to do so he made himself a coffee and turned on the TV. An hour later the wailing began.
Sam went to follow him until Jack placed a hand on his arm. "I think he needs some time to himself." Sam left anyway. He turned to Castiel. "What just happened shouldn't have happened. And it definitely shouldn't have happened in front of him. You were in angel form, weren't you? How many times did I die?"
‘She was just someone I met along the way. She was kind to me and looked after me when I had nothing and no-one. These bodies need so much, Dean. They need food and water and sleep, but they also need comfort and touch. I felt so alone but she was there and took me in for the night. Then one thing led to another. The next day she gave me some money so I could get here. I told her I couldn’t stay, and that I had nothing to offer her, but that didn’t seem to matter. I told her that I had to get to you, and to Sam, of course. She kissed me goodbye and said that she hoped I’d find what I was looking for.’
“And Jack?”
"Yeah, he told you then."
"Begin with?"
There were so many faults with their design. "All right, your mother says that you like banana custard. I will find you some." Holding the child closer, Cas carried him downstairs to the kitchen. He placed the child in the high chair and clipped the seat belts. The noise continued. He had to stop it or the neighbours would be round banging on the door. He opened the jar of food and got a spoon. The child stopped wailing, but wouldn’t open his mouth.
Jack wasn't sure who Dean was calling names, but he could see the confusion in the angel's eyes. He watched with amusement while the two stared at each other. He smiled. They were both totally in love with each other without realising how the other felt. Dean broke first and stormed out of the door.
"It would be nice to know the names of the people who've been attempting to kill me before I answer your questions."
"Cas, I hope it was worth it. Did it buy you some time?" The hunter and angel  stared at each other unsure of what to say until Sam's cough interrupted them. Cas spoke first to break the tension. "I'm sorry I have to go. You should be safe for a while. You know that you are important to me, and I need you to be safe." He looked at Sam and Bobby. "I want you all to be safe. In the end I'm doing this for you and all humans. I hope you understand I may have to do some things..." He looked worried for a moment, then disappeared again.
Jack grinned. "No, not always. Sometimes I'm worse. But when I see something I like, I don't see the point in not going for it and..." He continued looking Dean up and down. "I see plenty to like. So could you let me out of these? I'm sure that if I
"Sleeping like a baby," Dean answered. He had no intention of trying to explain the rules of football to the fallen angel. "Did you order the pizza?"
"You made me love you," Dean said, emerging from the shadows. "How could I resist? But I know I'm not enough for you, not after what I've just seen. I'm just an ordinary man." He stared at his feet.
"You want me to stay?" Dean asked.
Now it was Cas’ turn to swallow hard. He’d known from that first touch in Hell that Dean was special. Hester had been right; from that moment he’d been lost and he’d stayed lost. Angels weren’t supposed to put individual humans above others so he’d fought the need to put Dean above his brothers and sisters, and even above his father. He’d tried to serve heaven and not man but now heaven was closed to him, his brothers and sisters wanted to kill him and who knew where God had gone. Now, he was as human as the man in front of him.
"Really?" Jack asked. "
"It's just that in this other world me and Cas, or the man who played Cas, we were …"
Dean couldn’t help noticing that Castiel looked around every few seconds; he was obviously nervous and he looked tired. A huge wave of guilt swept over the hunter. He knew that he should have let Cas stay in the bunker. ‘I’m sorry I sent you away. I thought I was doing the right thing. I had to protect him; he’s my brother. It’s what I’ve always done and I guess I don’t know how to do anything else. There’s nothing I haven’t done for him. Do you understand me? Nothing! I’ve hustled and thieved and even sold ……. Look, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have left you out there on your own Cas, but didn’t know what else to do. But you’re alright, aren’t you? You got here and it’s so good to see you, man.’
‘You did take precautions, didn’t you? You’re human now and I guess that everything is working. You don’t want her coming after you saying you’re her baby daddy, do you? Not to mention diseases that you can catch now.’ He reached into his jacket pocket and took out a condom packet. ‘Here, make sure you carry one for emergencies; you know, just in case.’ He reached over and briefly their hands touched. Dean wasn’t sure but he would swear that Cas had run a finger down his wrist. He pulled away rather abruptly.
"Is this everything?" Cas asked. "Is he okay? He smells really bad."
"Dean, I need your help."
French Mistake part Deux
"I’ll put this one to bed and keep you company. Pizza would be good; pepperoni for me. There’s a game on the box tonight."
The angel moved forward. "Sam. Dean."
"Why d'you keep calling me Jim?' Bobby asked when they were downstairs. He opened the heavy metal door and pushed them in with the gun.
Jensen squared up to the other man. "What are you, jealous? And you know the work Mish does with his charity!" They stared at each other, angry and ready to fight, their hands shaped into fists.
. I can't die because of something that happened to me a while ago." Well that wasn't exactly true. "Do you have any experience of time travel?"
a demon, these markings above and below me, and the ring of salt, will keep me trapped. That
"What?" he asked.
"Banana custard?" he asked.
"I think you’d better. You know, just in case Jake wakes up again."
"Never mind the mat," Jared added. "Where's the crew and the cameras?" He picked up his hand and saw blood coming from several small cuts. "And this stuff isn't plastic either." For a moment, they stayed sitting on the ground, surrounded by dirt and broken glass, unsure of what to do.
"Thank goodness." Jack paused for a moment. "Has anyone ever told you how striking your green eyes are? Quite beautiful." He grinned. "Sorry, just distracted for a moment." Jack was gratified to see Dean move from foot to foot as if unsure how to react. Sam smiled and suppressed a chuckle. Obviously Dean had some issues Jack was now very keen to explore.
"I can’t tell you how grateful I am to you for doing this. Babysitters are worth their weight in gold these days. Now, Jake is asleep and he probably won’t wake up, but if he does there’s plenty of baby food in the fridge. He especially likes banana custard. Help yourself to anything, or if you want to order out, there are plenty of leaflets in the drawer by the phone. I think that’s everything."
"Is that truly what you think? That I have no need for you now that you’re human? Cas, I need you, you’re more than just family to me. Just don’t make me say it." Cas leaned in and kissed him gently. It was brief but wonderful.
"Another one of your save the whale events," Jensen replied his voice laced with sarcasm.
Castiel strode across the space between them. "You've always been enough for me. I needed to see. I needed to know that I could live without being an angel, and I can. This vessel is enough. I could get another one – a female one if you'd prefer. It wouldn't be the first time."
"Pizza’s good," Dean said, breaking the silence. Cas just nodded. When the game finished they watched something else until Nora returned home.
Jack jerked his head up in surprise. "An angel! A real angel! As in wings, and feathers, and everything?" He rubbed his ankles as Sam released him. "This'll be a first. I've never met an angel before. Suddenly, there was the sound of wings fluttering and a movement behind him. "Well, you have now," he heard a voice say.
Cas noticed Dean swallow hard. ‘Sorry, is this something men don’t talk about, like watching porn together? I’m sure that I could do some research on my own if you don’t want to help me.’ He placed a hand on Dean’s thigh. Dean shivered under that touch.
"And then you and Dean can come over again."
"How did you know?" Cas asked. Dean gazed at him. "You know. How did you know what to do?"
"Come on, boys," Bobby said. "We can't just stand around here. Let Cas do what he has to do to win his war. We've got enough to keep us busy here."
"You know, he plays Castiel, the angel in the trench coat who is secretly in love with Dean, rescued him from perdition, etcetera," Jared said.
Sam didn't reply for a moment, and Jack wondered if he was in with a chance after all. Then Sam grinned. "While Dean's occupied, I can drive Baby. Can I give you a lift anywhere?"
"I'm a time traveller. You hunt demons. I hunt aliens. Originally, I'm from the fifty-first century. Something happened to me in the future, and now I can't die, well, not for very long. I travelled to Earth using the leather strap on my left wrist. It's called a vortex manipulator."
"Several. I lost count. I've never... I'm sorry, you're right. I shouldn't have taken advantage of you, but you're the first person I've met who would survive my touch for so long."
"Gen is never going to believe this when we get back. We will get back, won't we?" he asked.
"What the hell is wrong with you two? Now move, before Raphael finds you and kills you. He wants your asses on a platter!" Bobby rushed around gathering things while Jensen and Jared continued their argument.
Jared stood his ground to begin with. "You can't do this. Have you lost your mind, Jim?" Finally, they put their hands up and went back into the building."
"Yeah, just give me a minute," Dean replied. Bobby pulled Sam away. Dean walked out into the scrap yard and stared up at the sky. Somewhere up there Cas was fighting a war, a war he needed to win for all mankind.
Outside, Jack ran his hand down the side of the Impala. "She's a beauty. I guess Dean doesn't let you drive that often." He got into the passenger seat. Sam turned on the engine and music blared out.
“At least Death’s dead now. She’s in the Empty. That only leaves Chuck. This must be him—his doing.”
"So are Sam and Dean are safe, or not?" Bobby asked.
The sound of fluttering wings signalled the arrival of an angel. "Cas," Bobby said. The angel walked up to the two actors, placed a hand on each and they disappeared. Seconds later, Bobby heard noises upstairs and got there as fast as he could.
"And he's my husband," Jensen added. "Although, maybe not for long. He is going to have to do some serious grovelling to make up for this!" For the first time Jensen smiled. "Come on. Where is he? He's watching this somewhere, isn't he? Where's the camera? This is for the gag reel, isn't it?"
"Cas?" Bobby questioned.
"My name is Dean Winchester, and this is my brother, Sam. I repeat, what are you? No demon survives this knife, and you're definitely no angel!" So
"I'm beginning to. All I know is that the man I just kissed wasn't my Misha. Don't get me wrong, I loved kissing him, but there was something raw and powerful in this version, something beautiful and more than a little sad. I felt like we were meant to be together for all time. It was like he spoke to some different part of me, to my soul. I felt like I was surrounded by light. I've never felt anything like it in my life. I love Misha, for all his nerdy ways, but he's never kissed me like that." He turned to Bobby. "So in this world, where Cas and Dean are real, are they together?"
"You'll get back. There's no way that Cas will leave Dean and Sam in that world, and who's Gen?"
Dean lost track of how long he’d sat there, head in his hands, with his back against the wall. He’d thought about praying, but who do you pray to when God is an evil, manipulative son of a bitch intent on destroying you along with everything and everyone you love?
"I didn't know if Dean could love me."
“Gone.” Dean’s voice rasped so hard the words hurt his throat.
"What is this place?" Jensen asked. "It looks like the back lot.2 He could see the scrap yard full of cars stretching out before him. Hearing a noise he turned around.
"Have you checked whether the baby needs changing?"
was looking him over as well.
"I’m at Nora’s house. It seems there was mix up. I’m babysitting. I’ve tried all the food that’s here and he won’t stop crying. What do I do?" Cas heard Dean laughing.
Castiel let his arms fall to his sides. "This, this is a vessel. He prayed for this. Did you want to be immortal? I sense many things in you, many conflicts."
"Not my first time around this particular block. I used to help Mum change Sammy, and boy was he smelly. So, babysitting eh?"
A little while later, Dean couldn’t help laughing out loud at the sight that greeted him on the doorstep; Cas was covered in food, holding a screaming, equally covered, child. Dean reached out and pulled a dab of something from Cas’ hair. He sniffed it.
The two men on the ground glanced at each other. "Jim? What's going on here? Where is everyone?"
When he came back down, Cas was sitting on the sofa. The TV was on. He noticed the worry on the other man’s face. Sitting next to him, Dean said, "what’s the score?"
"I won’t be late. Do I look all right? First dates are so difficult, but at least he knows about Jake and that didn’t put him off. Make yourself at home, Castiel and I’ll see you around eleven."
"Are you hungry?" he asked. In the past, he’d have been able to judge. He’d have understood what the baby wanted, but now he had no idea.
"So what's happened? Cas got the weapons from Balthazar and scared Raphael off, and what d'you mean visitors? We thought it would be quiet here without us."
"This is no joke, Dean. You and Sam are in mortal danger. This shouldn't have happened. Balthazar must have made a mistake when he did the spell."
"Yes, thank you." She gave Cas some money.
"Which clearly, I'm not." Jack put his hand into his jacket and the gun was raised again. "I see you've taken my Webley. I've had that gun a long time and I'd like it back. Oh, and you have my wallet too, so you know I'm telling the truth about my contact in the CIA. Now, if you could just unchain my ankles. I'd rather not break them as well as that really does hurt." He stared directly at Dean. "Then you and I can spend some time getting to know each other a little better. I think we may have a lot in common, unless my radar is completely off."
"The real Castiel! Are you honestly trying to tell me that this is all true, that there are other universes where things are different? Sorry, but that's frigging unreal."
Angel's wings fluttered again. "Yes there are," Balthazar said. "Sorry about my little mistake. Cas and I are trying to sort it out now, but we're a bit busy. We'll get you back to your world safe and sound as soon as we can. Luckily for you, Raphael has gone after our Sam and Dean." He raised his head. "I have to go now. I'll have to revive your Castiel and wipe these events from your world."
"Hang tight, man. I’ll be there as soon as I can."
‘So you’re here just because God told you to be, because you’re a good son that does exactly what his father tells him too. We both know that that isn’t true. Cas, Look, I don’t do feelings; you know that. Sam always wants me to talk to him but I can’t; I never could. But I’m asking you not to leave. Don’t go off with someone else. Stay with me, please. I need you, Cas.’ He hesitated but he had to get these words out. ‘I think I love you. I don’t want someone else touching you.’ He felt a finger pressed to his lips.
Adventures in Babysitting
"So what are you going to do about it?" Jack asked. "It's obvious he loves you, and now he'll think he can never be what you want him to be because you can't be yourself with him."
"So," Cas said. "Will you be my boyfriend?"
"There, there," he said. He went to return the child to the cot, but the wailing began again.
‘Dean? Are you alright? You’ve gone very pale. Have you been eating properly? Do you need something?’
Neither of them heard the door open. "Do you love him?" Sam asked. "Him. Not mankind, but my brother, the man. He prayed to you, believed in you, despite everything. I've watched him gazing at you. I've seen the way you look at him. Well, cat got your tongue?2
They drove to the motel in silence. Again the atmosphere was thick with unanswered questions. Dean parked the Impala and went to get out of the car until Cas stopped him. "Why did you stop me correcting her, Dean? She thinks that you and I are together."
‘You thought of me?’ Did he mean what it sounded like, that Cas had thought of him when he was having sex? No he couldn’t mean that, could he? Dean realised how much he wanted it to be true. Back into character he stretched out his arm and slapped Cas on the back.
"Whoa, no! We're definitely not going there. Anyway, everyone I've slept with recently has died!"
Castiel stared at the hunter as if he couldn't quite understand what Dean was asking him. "Interesting," he replied calmly, without explanation.
Bobby kept his shotgun cocked and aimed. There was definitely something going on here, and he needed to see Castiel. Realisation hit him. He had an idea. "My name is Bobby Singer. I'm a hunter, but you're not Sam and Dean Winchester, are you? Well, not the real Sam and Dean." He picked up a jug of water and threw some over both of them.
"But you’re always telling me to get out of your personal space. I thought you didn’t feel that way about me."
"My name is Captain Jack Harkness, and I'm just a man. And you are?" The two whispered to each other. Jack heard the word demon bandied between them.
"To Dean?"
Jack noticed that the angel's gaze seemed to linger just that little bit longer over the elder brother. Jack watched him then it struck him that this body was just a form. He could almost see the real image trying to escape. The light behind those strangely alluring eyes leaked out. Jack was suddenly overcome with desire and wanted nothing less than to be pinned under this creature, gazing into those eyes, being surrounded by the power emanating from him. It was visceral. He could feel it calling to him. He couldn't help himself. In two strides, Jack was across the space to where Castiel was standing. Jack had to touch him. He was like a moth to a flame, and nothing could have stopped him. He needed to touch this creature, to kiss him, to taste him. He wanted this being to touch his very soul and take it apart only to put it together again. The angel was an immortal like him. Somehow, he could tell that he had seen too much, just like him, and lived for too long. Jack could almost touch his pain and sorrow. He wanted to comfort and be comforted. He wondered for a moment if the angel felt the same, if he could recognise the same things in him. Jack wanted to fall to his knees. Instead, gathering all his self-control, he simply stretched out a hand in greeting.
had a name. Jack flashed his cheekiest grin, the one that had been known to melt hearts throughout the universe. "Well, that's true. I'm certainly no angel, but I have been called a bit of a devil in my time. Look, on the level, if you check my pockets you'll find a card with my name on and a number you can ring at the CIA. They're not my biggest fans, but they'll vouch for me."
So many thoughts fought for dominance in his mind. Cas wanted to find out about men. He was a man; he knew about having sex with men. Perhaps he should tell him about what it was like to run your fingers over hard muscle, to feel the roughness of stubble across your cheek, how it felt to have someone holding your hair as they pushed into your mouth or what it’s like to feel that moment when someone pushes inside you and touches that spot that sends your senses reeling. Perhaps he should tell him of the back rooms, back alleys and seedy toilets. Perhaps he should say that no matter how much he’d told himself that he was only doing this because he had to, that there were times when he went out looking for men to give him the pain and the pleasure that he craved. But he didn’t want to do that. He didn’t want Cas to have sex with some man and then it hit him. All the feelings he’d hidden, pushed deep down, and tried to ignore. How many times had he told Cas that he needed him? But he’d never said how good it was to hold him, or how much the angel had made him laugh, how lost he’d felt without him, or how it had nearly killed him to send him away. Other than Sammy, Cas was the first person he thought of every day. He’d taken a beating to keep the angels away from him and been hurt to his core every time Cas had left or hadn’t trusted him. He looked up and met those startlingly blue eyes now full of worry and questions. He didn’t want Cas going off with some strange man, not when he needed him, not when he cared for him, not when he loved him. Loved him?
‘Was it wrong of me, Dean? I know that you’ve slept with people for just one night. Was it wrong to take her money? She told me that she wasn’t paying me for the sex. I think she was just being kind.’
-Me? You go! You wanted it! And I'm also busy.
-YOU WILL NOT GOING ANYWHERE! - The two spoke.
That motel was definitely fancy. It doesn't even look like a motel, it has six floors. Why so many floors? And by the way the sixth was more exclusive since there were only three rooms, the last one is at the end of the corridor that seems to be huge. And it seems to be where Castiel is, because Crowley just stops, in front of the last room, looking intently at the door.
-What a smell?
-Of course, Dean. -Say smiling, making the hunter smile together.
-You said you were smelling something since we got on the road, you said it got stronger here.
-And this Eros?
They went to the bottom of the right side of the cafeteria where the padded chairs are, sat down and a waitress came to deliver the menu, smiled, and left. Castiel is facing the hunter. “It looks like it's a date. Is it a date? No. Wait... But yesterday I asked Cas out, so ... is it a DATE? ” While Dean is still thinking about whether this is a date or not, Castiel looked at the food wondering what he was going to order.
-Unfortunately, we have to share you, Castiel.
-It looks like we have company.
-Your grace? -He raised his face, seeing the deep blue eyes, almost getting lost in them.
- It was three days.
Happy Easter, everyone!!
-We need to celebrate, ask them to bring two and see if they have chocolate.
-Castiel, you need to look at me. Only me.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Yes, Dean, I have. He seems to be drunk.
-I don't think so, Cas's GPS is changing all the time, if we hit the road we will lose Cas's location, and he is with Lucifer, so I don't think so.
-Unfortunately, we have to share you, Cas.
-When you move that way. -He winked. -I can't hold on.
That request made Lucifer use the rest of his grace, moving insanely within Castiel, he had a wide smile, watching his brother moan with pleasure, scream with pleasure, and above all, call him after each thrust. Seeing that he was about to come, he laid the brunette down with him and began to masturbate his brother at the same pace that he's moving.
-What the fuck! Disgusting!
-De-deee...
-What was Crowley?
-Where's my grace?
-Cas .... do you, by any chance, remember what I said yesterday? Before we pass out?
-Shh, hurry up.
Dean didn't understand, waiting for the answer.
-I look ridiculous with this, do I need to use this even in Baby?
-Ab ... absinthe.- Coughed.- It isn't meant to affect demons.
Hope you enjoy it.
-Yes, Cas? - He looked up, seeing his friend, putting on his overcoat and adjusting his blue tie. "That was quick."
Lucifer turned to his brother and saw the Winchester standing, with the pillow still on his private parts.
-Cas? What...
-Gabriel ... what are you ... hm ...
-You are literally on the side of the lube and the phone, you hairless ape.
Dean woke up from the trance. He asked the angel to date him! What would he do? By God… he gave a light laugh. "Now father-in-law, by the way". But how he would tell Cas? It is not something that is usually said. “Hey Cas, you know these three days that we had sex without stopping, just drinking? So yesterday, which was Sunday, when of course, I was fucking you, I asked to date you and you said yes. Remember? ” There was no way he was going to say anything. He would let him remember little by little, not throw the news like that.
-Can you suck them? - He showed two fingers, Castiel took his hand and brought them to his mouth, maintaining eye contact.
-Me ... and Lucifer. -Dean's eyes widened too.
-Yes, if he comes back it is certain death.
Crowley's eyes widened, he looks really tense. His cell phone rang, it was Sam.
He heard a groan, turned his face, seeing the cover, the red cover is white, Dean saw something moving underneath, getting up and sitting down. It's Castiel, the cover slipping, seeing the angel's back covered in hickeys, scratches, and two big cuts that bleed a lot, because it's still a bright red. He stretched, making the cover slip some more, that Dean saw a part of the angelic being's ass.
-Just be careful Cas.
-O ... the ... OH ... the cell phone ... Cas ... moved from ... NEW! I-and-I will send you ... the address ...
The older Winchester took things, going to the car. It would be a long journey.
-What the fuck! What time is it?
Dean remembered their last moment before they completely pass out. He was inside the angel, the brunette's legs around his waist, their bodies glued together, holding on tight looking like something bad was going to happen at any moment. They didn't want to separate. Castiel was no longer with grace, so Dean was able to hug his back with ease since he no longer had the wings. The hunter kissed the angel with all the love he could gather, all the affection, that even though he was sunk with pleasure, he wanted Castiel to feel that he loved him, so he did. After breaking the rather long kiss, he stopped moving and looked into those perfect blue eyes.
Castiel is crazy beneath him, submissive, tightening his hands on his shoulder, his legs around his waist, with those moans and howls, until he hears another scream, this time it was different, a word, it seemed to be ... Enochian? One of the small lights on the bedroom ceiling broke. That only encouraged the hunter, who accelerated the pace insanely. Dean didn't even know how, but he was doing it, and the best part? Castiel accompanied him at the same pace, of course, for him it is easy, not being human. The two already felt spasms, Dean accelerated the pace with his hand, making the angel reach the climax, giving another cry, breaking another lamp, dirtying the abdomen of both, but the Winchester continued the pace, reaching the climax, he also screamed, obviously his scream wouldn't blow up any lamps, but it had certainly been heard in the other rooms of the motel.
-View the GPS on his phone. I will open the notebook.
-Guess whose fault it is? Huh, Gabe?
The hunter paid and left the store, putting on his mask. He looked in the mirror.
The three of them were sitting on the bed drinking the champagne Lucifer asked for, the taste was very good, they looked at each other. Finishing the cup, the archangel put the glass back on the cart beside the bed and picked up the chocolate toppings, turning to the angel with a sly smile, who was still finishing his drink.
-Cas? What's up? Did you manage to find Lucifer?
-Crowley, what do you think it is?
-What? Polluted? With what?
-It doesn't seem to have anyone.
-You know ... you are very beautiful. - He smiled. -I know you asked for chocolate syrup ... but ... - He got closer to Castiel's body, bringing his nose closer to that wonderful being. - If you want ... there's something better than chocolate sauce. We can make a mixture of dark chocolate ...- He brought his lips close to the angel's ear. –With white chocolate. - He whispered.
-You have to buy a gas mask.
Sam couldn't explain what happened. In one moment they were checking the books to know what they were fighting for, in another moment, he was putting the archangel on top of the books, kissing him, taking off his clothes and his, making them come on top of the books. And the worse, he couldn't get away from the blonde.
- Hit me and I'll break your neck. Cas will stay with me!
- Bye Lucifer.
-What is it, Dean?
-Nothing. Just thinking ... now that you're my boyfriend, then God is my father-in-law. No pressure. -Castiel laughed, kissing him.
-Dee-AAHH-an...
-Oh ... Okay. Speaking these three days, when I was at the bar watching Lucifer, three men appeared. One of them placed a golden ring with a pink stone.
-My answer is the same, Dean. Of course...yes.
-C-Ca- The hunter can't believe it.
-Lucifer!
- It's just that you didn't see back here. - Dean smirked.
-Cas, you better sit down.
They were both gaping at the sight of the archangel sitting on the bed, already mischieving what he was going to do with that syrup. Lucifer is sitting on the end of the bed with the pillows, Castiel in the middle, and Dean on the other end. The blonds started kissing the brunette's cheeks, without invading the other side, they went lowering, kissing the neck, biting the lobes, making the wings open fully, making Castiel moan loudly. They kissed and licked his neck again, when they kissed his shoulder, they heard the door slam.
-It's more sensitive.
-You know how they say Moose, the seventh is always the best. -He winked.
Gas mask? Smell? But what smell?
-I think we better get out without someone looking. -Smiled embarrassed.
-Smell? What a smell? - He opened the impala door, sitting in the car.
-Yes, his! Not yours. And I don't even want to!- He took the blanket and wiped his face and chest.
-I do not understand. - Castiel said breathlessly. Did the room get hotter or was it his impression?
-Will gonna tell me you never had multiple orgasms? - He laughed, knowing the answer of the other. -Look that. It stops. A shame.
-Cas ... Ca-can't ... I can't anymore...
Castiel didn't stop looking at the body of his protégé, he finally put his hands on the blond's chest, strolling with his hands along the length stopping in his underwear. In this, Dean did not expect. The angel took the hunter's black box and pulled it down, the blonde sat on the bed because he almost lost his balance. He saw Castiel take off his underwear and throw it on the pile that was forming on the table, a little far from the bed, full of clothes; the brunette got down on his knees and slowly licked down the hunter's cock, who let out a hoarse groan, felt his protector lick his glans and finally put his member in his mouth.
-Motel? But the room is huge! -He looked up, seeing the ceiling almost entirely of mirrors. -Yeah, it's a motel. But why I can't remember anything?
Castiel reached the climax, blowing up the bottle of champagne and another lamp, this time one of the top five. Lucifer managed to increase the pace more, shouting, and came inside the brunette.
Castiel finally looked at him, but soon noticed something behind the hunter.
-What Dean?
-Uh? What? - He looked at the hunter. -What?
-I have no idea, but get this, Gabriel is on my side, and from what he told me, Lucifer is with Cas.
-Yes. - The angel smiled, making the man blush.
Hope you enjoy it.
Castiel fell sitting on the bed, but screamed, lying on his stomach on the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
-You can take him. - Said Lucifer.
Dean walked slowly until he felt something on the floor, it's a bottle of champagne, he was looking around, seeing shards of glass the same color as the drink bottle. He remembered something, looked like Castiel and Lucifer drinking with him. It was a dream? He didn't know for sure. Dean looked down again, seeing his body full of semen. “What the hell happened? I'm going to take a shower". He went back to the bathroom, his vision improving as it was still cloudy.
-Cas, don't you want to have lunch with me? You must be hungry.
-Gabriel what are you...
Dean had managed to climb on the bed, his head getting better with the dizziness, he would definitely have a bump in his head. But it didn't matter, not now, not after seeing Castiel like that with Lucifer. He's furious. He came close to his angel, putting his hand on his shoulder, with the archangel still inside Castiel.
-Go there. -Lucifer said commanding. -I'm busy here.
A small red pillow was in his face, which he held. He looked at them both, making the famous confused face.
(See the end of the chapter for
-He is the god of carnal desire.
-I just need to find the right spot...
(See the end of the chapter for
-Crowley?
-I ... -Castiel lowered his head.
-Hello Castiel.
-Shhh ... Just relax Samsquatch.
-Try to avoid sweets, I don't want to stop to go drink water.
Dean didn't realize that they were already on the ground floor with the angel calling him, holding the elevator door, he left looking at the reception. There was no one when they arrived, but now he can see two people passed out on the reception floor. At least they're passed out so they can get out of there without any problems.
-Cas is an expression.
-Dean, did we did it all this?
-That's not it Dean, I remembered everything.
-Castiel, you are my brother. You are not stupid ... - Castiel closed her eyes more. -You are naked Castiel!
-What?
-------------//-----------// --------//-------------//-------------
Gabriel made a pair of handcuffs appear in his hand, pulled the hunter by his underwear, bringing him around the main room of the bunker, trapping his arms on one of the legs of the main table. Sam saw the archangel laugh.
Dean returned with the movements, something indicated that this would be their last time there in that motel, so he made the request, he doesn't want to leave his angel ever again and he doesn't want Castiel away from him. He kissed the angel again with affection, who returned the same way, he kept smiling, when they climaxed this time they went together, making Dean Winchester smile like a teenager.
-I will go. -Castiel stood up, falling a little. He is very dizzy, didn't understand why.
They both breathed heavily, looking into each other's eyes, kissing again.
The hunter saw the address on the phone, hung up, and looked at the king of hell. The demon's face looks a little apprehensive.
But something still seemed to be wrong. Dean held Castiel so he wouldn't move, the blues went back to the greens again mixing.
-Castiel, do you want to date me?
-What about?
-Seriously? Do you think I didn't see that? And why this mask?
-It doesn't smell anymore.
-All right, Dean. Where are we going to eat?
-It's okay, Dean. -He got up from the chair. -I want to eat.
Dean looked around. How he would pay for all that? The room is falling apart, literality, it's chaos! A five-star motel is not cheap, now paying for three days and all that repair?! No way!
-So let's go, I'll pay.
-How can he be so cute? - Dean spoke softly.
-I'm going to see Crowley, Sam sends me the pharmacy address.
-Uhhh .... ok ...
(See the end of the chapter for
-What? Gas mask? Why?
-It looks like someone is happy to see me. -He smirked.
Dean's body is moving alone towards his friend, husky but seductive voice. His body is asking for the angel. His heart beating fast, screaming for Castiel with each beat, he wants Castiel, he needs to touch him. Little did he know that in the same room, the devil and the king of hell were fighting, but not with powers, literally fighting with punches, kicks, and what they managed to hit each other.
-The enchantment was like a cupid's arrow, you can only see the intended person, you cannot see anyone else, so as the enchantment together with the manipulation of Anteros, you literally couldn't see anyone else.
-Crowley? What the fuck?
Hope you like it.
Hi everyone, just so you know, this is a long chapter.
The GPS started to move, it seemed to be crazy, from the bar, it ended up in another bar and then in another bar, remaining there.
Hey guys, sorry for the delay, but I got covid and couldn't write. But now is here!!!
-What ?! - Dean, Crowley, and Castiel said, looking at people kneeling.
-Four. But I only saw three.
-Well, now I want that part ...- He ran his fingers over Castiel entrance, which took a shake. -Delicious ... for me.
Castiel nodded, putting the devil's member in his mouth, who groaned loudly.
The hunter stopped, turning red like a pepper. Okay ... it went on for three days without stopping, obviously the ... Dean swallowed again. He's ashamed. The images from the previous days came back to his head, which didn't help at all.
-Yes, and sexy.
-What? Don't hurt him? He took your virginity! - He looked furiously at the hunter, who stood behind the angel, behind the wings. - This was supposed to be MINE!
Dean was almost startled by choking on his drink, coughing a little, watching Lucifer lubricate his cock. The archangel held Castiel by the waist, penetrating him hard, making him cry out in pain. The Winchester saw it, the devil getting on his knees bringing his angel close to him, holding his thighs, lifting him, moving slowly but deeply, making his friend growl.
-Do not cover Cas. I want to hear you.
The devil turned the angel, leaving him on all fours, it was that sight, that wonderful sight that did not make him hate the old man so much. Lucifer has already taken the lubricant by passing it through his fingers and introducing it into the angel, grunting in pain, already making movements of coming and going with his fingers, moving his wrist, deeper into his younger brother.
-Lucifer nothing! You already took my little brother's virginity. You are lucky, otherwise, you wouldn't have a head. Neither of the heads. - He looked furious. - And besides, we agreed to share, as in a sandwich, for you to understand better in your little head, I won't touch you, nor you touch me. But we both want the middle - He smirked. Both looking at the angel.
Castiel went completely red. "He is very cute".
Sam looked at him, that was a low blow, Gabriel spread his huge golden wings, which the first time he saw them, Sam was completely enchanted, the feathers seemed to shine like the sun, they are magnificent, and with the archangel rubbing his cheeks on the member of the hunter, it gets more and more difficult.
What the fuck? Why the hell is Castiel in a motel? Did he get hurt? Even because he was with Lucifer, but the motel is FIVE stars, he doesn't have the money to stay there. Crowley entered the motel, saying nothing, making the hunter follow slowly.
-More or less, my memories have not returned completely.
-Dean, I'm in doubt about ordering between pancakes and hamburgers. What will you ask for? -Winchester looked at him.
-Yes ... -Dean looked away. –Cas, if you happen to-
-Why does EVERYONE want Castiel? -Lucifer said, losing what little patience he had.
There was no time for Sam to think, the archangel sat quickly on his cock, making the hunter moan loudly. Gabriel with the powers, moved madly, up and down the limb of the hunter, Sam together with Gabriel screaming with pleasure. The taller one pulled the archangel, kissing him, moving his tongues frantically.
-He's in a bar, he seems to be drinking whiskey, no ... it seems to be... gin.
Dean looked again at his friend's body. Shit! Castiel's body is very beautiful. Even with the scratches, the purple spots, the hickeys; his body is well defined, how he would know? He wears those baggy clothes ... The clothes! The blonde came out of the bathroom, looking for his clothes and the angel. They were tangled up on the table, he was a little relieved because it was the only place where he had no condom or semen, he put on his clothes. He took the angel's clothes and walked slowly towards the bathroom.
The hunter's heart missed a few beats. Shit, shit! He is completely in love with the angel. What if Castiel doesn't remember? What if he didn't like it? If he doesn't want anything to do with the hunter? Dean frowned.
-I prefer it that way.
-What the fuck, Lucifer ?!
Dean didn't know how, but there was semen on the ceiling and ... feathers? A feather fell on her face, which he held. The feather is black but has a bluish glow. There was another image, him standing and a person with his legs on his shoulders, the person's arms holding on to the ceiling. He didn't understand anything.
The hunter blushed, remembering everything. He remembered how the glass on the wall broke, he happened to be on his feet, with Cas holding on to him, and unintentionally he was a little more ... rough, and he kind of unintentionally threw Cas's body hard at the wall, which in this case was made of glass, and sort of by chance, the two of them being so ... horny, didn't notice that the brunette was bleeding. But even Castiel hadn't realized that he was bleeding!
-Because you are human, you will not feel it at all.
Dean almost had a heart attack. The angel surprised him more and more, sexier and sexier, more attractive. "If possible". Thought. “Castiel for your father, don't make that face! I am going back to hell ... But at least I'm happy ”. He removed his fingers from his angel's lips and with the medium touched his entrance, hearing another roar. When he was slowly introducing his finger into Castiel, he began to lick his member, so as not to think about the pain, he gave light kisses on the angel's phallus, introducing the second finger. He waited for him to get used to the feeling, although he was overflowing with desire, he wouldn't hurt his angel, he knows Cas was still a virgin, and his friend's first time has to be great. It will be great.
-I don't understand, it's okay that we spent three days having ... sexual intercourse. -He whispered. -But you look good. I do not believe that you will starve yourself to death.
-It's from Aphrodite, specifically from Eros, her son.
-Dean, I think I better go along.
The hunter penetrated him with his tongue, loving to see the lord's great angel, twitching, groaning, and trying to speak, but the only thing he understood was his name. He got up and went to the bedside table beside the bed, taking everything it had, putting it on top of the furniture. He thought about using the lubricant, but he wanted to know something.
-PLEASE MY KING! POSSESS US! - The three-spoke.
Dean went to try to stop it, but something seemed to have stopped him, his thoughts started to get confused, he couldn't hear Castiel's voice anymore, only his body coming and going in his direction, his red lips parted with a thread of saliva in the corner, tears streaming down his face, rosy cheeks and worse, his body wide open, seemed to call him, which he gladly accepted.
-Because we don't have souls, other people could also see us, but they were busy. We were affected, obviously, but not as much as humans.
Dean swallowed hard, remembering the positions, Castiel's moans, feeling his ass, the feeling of being inside him. He blushed. What the fuck! Castiel is his best friend! And he did those things to him, and the worst he loved every minute, every second. The hunter doesn't know what to do. Does Cas remember what they did? What is he thinking? Dean is getting desperate! What does he do? His relationship with Cas certainly changed, now he wasn't just a friend, he certainly wasn't a brother, now what?
He looked down, turning red, covering his intimate area with the pillow, biting his bottom lips, heading towards the door.
-It was in that bar here.- He showed the address on his cell phone.
He blinked again, rubbing his eyes, he sees that right? No. It must be his imagination. Yes, it's just your imagination playing tricks on you. But he can swear that Crowley is behind Castiel holding his chin with his hand while kissing and licking his neck. He saw Crowley go up with the kisses to the brunette's chin, going to the face ... Dean ran off seeing where Crowley wanted to go, why doesn't Castiel do anything? He's just letting.
-Me and Lucifer... I didn't want to remember those things. What Lucifer did to me.
-Ok Dean.
When they were in the elevator, Dean could only think of Castiel, the positions that made the brunette stay, his body squirming under him, his skin soft, the feeling of being inside the angel and his face, especially when he reached his climax. Damn it! Now is not the time to be thinking about these things.
-Yes?
-Yes, Dean?
-Ahhh! Castiel!
-Now three men entered ... they look familiar to me ...
-But I want to go. - The angel said.
-Crowley ... are you sure it is ...
-Castiel is mine! Only mine! MAKE AMONG YOURSELVES!
-Sam are you okay?
-Fuck! Cas! Hmm ...- Dean was a little perplexed, Castiel knew what he was doing, and by the way, he was doing very well. - Cas ...- He murmured.
He didn't know how but managed to get redder than already was. Dean Winchester took Castiel's virginity! He took an angel's virginity! "Now, I'm definitely going back to hell"! But something inside him was still worrying him, the request, does Castiel remember Dean's request?
Dean rolled his eyes.
He "cleaned" himself as much as he could and left the bathroom. That room is huge and complete chaos. One of the mirrors on the wall is shattered on the floor, there was semen everywhere, a lot of semen, as well as condoms and broken glass in different colors. He looked at the ceiling.
-I do not know either...
-A pharmacy? Doing what there?
On the one hand, Dean wanted Castiel to remember to tell him what the hell had happened, but on the other hand, Cas remembering, Jesus ... They literally spent three days having sex, nonstop, and all those positions, it's very embarrassing. Although Castiel is older than the land, he was still innocent, by God, he was a virgin before that!
-He will stay with me!
-Oh Samsquatch, you also got very excited. -The archangel looked down, seeing the hard cock of the brunette, over his underwear. Smiling maliciously.
-The Lucifer? With Cas? Is this archangel sure?
-LIKE HELL! I STILL HAVE TO SHARE WITH HIM! -The two spoke together, pointed to the other. -HIM! YOU BELIEVE? ME NEITHER!
-Go faster.
-Calm down, we're not going to kill him.
-Won't happen again.
-So you mean you don't want to have any candy on you?
-Let me guess ... did you learn from the pizza guy? - He gave a slight smile.
The angels stopped and looked at each other, their eyes shone pink, and went to another motel room, closing the door. Lucifer closed the door behind him, seeming to think, and looked at Castiel, wide open for him. “I sure want to hear his voice. But with some conditions ”. The archangel stood at the side of the bed, pulling the angel by the hip closer to him, lifting him in his lap, and holding his waist.
-Cas ...- He was embarrassed. -I know your ass is hurting but ...
Gabriel made the handcuffs disappear, making Sam hold him, standing on top, without separating them. He put the archangel on the table. Sam couldn't explain it, but when he was inside the archangel he felt an energy, a chill, it is extremely hot and it made his body go into ecstasy. The archangel looked up, smiling.
-It's not just my ass. My back is very sore. Did you see what happened? I put on my clothes and didn't look.
-That that makes you feel so good, it's my grace, Samsquatch.
-But there's room for one more. -Said the man almost kissing Castiel, who was propped up on the door, trying to get out.
-Whisky? Gin? Are you sure it's Lucifer?
-Fuck.... I mean... Really ?! –Winchester turned red like a pepper.
-Seriously?
Wait. Castiel? And ... is that Lucifer's voice? Dean pushed open the door, entering the room a little, but freezing when he saw the scene.
Dean gasped, Castiel spoke in such a simple way. How can he be adorable talking about porn? Only Castiel. He smiled, willingly invading his mouth again, sucked and nibbled on his lips, giving long pecks. He looked at the brunette's body, he still has his pants on! It can't, not with him there.
-WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? THAT MAN IS ONLY WITH BOW TIE AND PANTIES!
-Castiel, hold on to me, or you'll fall.
He looked at the feather again, very beautiful, ran his fingers feeling how soft it was ... He remembered. He remembered! The person was Castiel, he remembered all the positions he took and stayed with the angel, becoming desperate. He crashed when he remembered that he almost shared it with Crowley and, worse, that he had to share it with Lucifer, with Lucifer! And now? He literally stayed from Friday until Saturday, having sex with his friend. Literally! Fuck!
-Of course Dean. -He smiled and returned the movements, kissing the hunter.
In the motel, like the bar and the rest of the city, there was no one. This was never a good thing.
Crowley took the mask and handed it to the hunter.
-You? You are his brother! This is incest! He will stay with me! I am the king!
-Well, I think I can proceed. - He smiled maliciously.
As much as he was enjoying that long and lingering torture, he can't take it anymore. He wanted to go slow, but he needs to relieve himself or he would go crazy. He kissed Castiel on the lips and went down in a straight line, seeing the angel's hard member, but went straight down. "Sorry, Cas, but the situation down here is tense." Looking down, seeing what he needed, that entrance, he gave a slight laugh. "Apparently, with you too."
Lucifer said throwing the hunter and the demon across the wall. He was supposed to be weak, how did he manage to throw them on the other side? The Winchester slowly opened his eyes, taking a hand to the head in mild pain. He looked at the bed again, this time the archangel is on top of the angel, taking off the brunette's tie and black blazer. The hunter seeing that couldn't take it, the blood went up, he ran pushing that perverted blonde, shooting him in the chest.  He knew it wasn't going to kill him, but he would have time to escape.
But Dean wants to go out to lunch with his angel, now that he isn't with his grace, he is human, he will want to eat. After lunch, Dean would return the angel's grace, so he would heal and heal him too; but, especially Cas, seeing the friend who went back to lie on his stomach, for obvious reasons.
After a while on the road, the hunter spotted a shabby motel on the side of the road, he needed to talk to Sammy, Crowley had to say what he knew and Castiel certainly had to talk to him. His mind is still with that image, of the brunette with his mouth on the devil's member. The devil! What the fuck! He leaned the car against the motel parking lot, looks like that there were people here. He called his friend, but he didn't answer, he didn't look at him. It is not possible that he was angry with him interrupted them. It's Lucifer! Lucifer!
You're not remembering anything! He went to the sink to wipe his mouth, found himself in the mirror; the hunter had a cut with clotted blood in the middle of his forehead, a green spot under his left eye where there was also a small cut and ... was that on his neck a hickey? Dean looked down, he is naked and with semen on his body, both dry and fresh.
The Winchester took off the mask and could breathe easily, he looked in the rearview mirror, and passed a pink light through his eyes, making his pupils dilate. He saw the address on his cell phone and headed towards it. Once there, he looked at his cell phone at least five times, it must be at the wrong address. He was sure he is at the wrong address, Sam doesn't answer his cell phone, just a message saying that Castiel had not moved, he was still at the same place. The problem is, that place is a five-star motel.
The three men entered the bar, going straight towards the archangel, two of them passed looking at Castiel, winking at the angel's Lord, making him look down, a tingling sensation all over his body. But it didn't affect him so much, turning to look at Lucifer, he saw the third man, a man with golden hair, putting a ring on the middle finger of the archangel, a golden ring with a pink stone. The men spoke to the bartender, who handed them three glasses of a green drink, saw the three say something, but it was so low that he couldn't hear, tried to read the lips of the man, with almost platinum blond hair, who is at the tip when he noticed one of the words, he got up quickly but fell slowly, holding as he could on the table, but without success.
-Come, Cas, I'll help you. You need a bath.
Dean slowly climbed the bed, getting on top of Castiel, resting his hands between the angel's head, while his knees were between the other's waist, the hunter stared at his angel and vice versa, only looking away at the well-designed lips. He slowly lowered his face until he felt Castiel's breath mixed with his own, he looked at the angel again, but when he saw him look at his mouth, he didn't hold on, putting his lips together.
Lucifer returned to kiss the angel, sitting, bringing Castiel closer, who was on hands and knees, the archangel held his brother's face.
In Sam's room, his cell phone rang again, twenty calls from Dean appearing before hanging up for lack of battery. The only thing could hear was the screams and moans of the hunter and the archangel, which echoed throughout the bunker.
-What?
Sam heard a noise, he turned, seeing the archangel holding a can of whipped cream, the product already covered his nipples and his cock, where there was a cherry on the end and another cherry in his mouth. Sam smiled, approaching the smaller one, biting half of the cherry that was in Gabriel's mouth, kissing him.
Lucifer flicked his fingers in the direction of the Winchester, who was thrown on the wall, next to the bathroom, falling seated. The archangel threw the angel on the bed, pushing his face deeper into the sheets, holding his black hair tightly on the bed as he thrust it deeper.
-And then?
The hunter went to the bar where he and Castiel were talking on their cell phones until the call hung up. The bar was elegant, spacious, could fit a hundred people, but there was no one there. What the hell happened? The bar is intact, the glasses are whole, none broke, no blood, no sulfur, no EMF, nothing. People just disappeared. While the hunter was looking for any sign of life in that bar, looking for something that could explain what happened, the king went towards the counter.
-I found Cas. I don't remember why I put it here, but here it is. - Dean went to deliver the bottle to the angel, but stopped, bringing the bottle to him.
-Room service!
-Cas ...
-I HAVE BEEN THREE DAYS FUCKING CAS?
Dean's eyes widened. Was that serious? He looked at Castiel again.
The archangel started to touch the member of the hunter over his pants, put his hand inside his underwear, removing Sam's cock, already hard.
-Cas?
Dean and Lucifer punched the man's face.
-Then I can hit him.
-But I don't remember. Can you tell me what happened?
-You're sick! - Dean spoke between teeth.
-Dean, Cas's GPS has changed again. He's in what appears to be a pharmacy.
Lucifer held Castiel's soft bands well apart, penetrated the head, bite the brunette's collarbone red, and gave him a hickey on his neck, already leaving a huge purple stain. He looked into his brother's eyes, smiled seeing that he was looking directly at himself. Just like he wanted. Then Lucifer wiggles, introducing the rest of his cock hard, making the angel scream, breaking another small lamp in the ceiling.
-I'm glad you guys are getting along, but ... He's a human.
-Crowley. Crowley! -He called low.
-Okay!
-It's really you!
For a moment Lucifer stopped, looked down, Castiel was not looking at him, he was looking at the human who saved him from hell. Yes, the devil is jealous, jealous of an ape that claims to be evolved.
-Dean-O, don't be like that. I'm sure, Lucifer's grace may be weak, but I can still tell where he is and he's with Cassie. So see this soon.
-And? - Both spoke. -AGAIN?
-Cas, I didn't understand.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Dean, it hurts-
-About yesterday...
-Whatever.
-THANK YOU, SIR! - They got up and dragged the king of hell to one of the other rooms on that floor.
-Really, before entering the city, stop in the next and buy a gas mask. I think I know what we're getting into.
-And why don't you wear a mask?
-My memories are very confused at the moment, I remember you took away my grace, but I don't remember why, but before ... -Castiel's eyes widened, Dean saw the angel's legs fail, and hold his arms.
Hope you like it!
-Suck me, little brother? - He smirked, winking.
-Yes, let's go.
-Lucifer ... I ... I ... AAHH !!
-Yes! Right! Right. We will.
Hope you enjoy it.
Sam's eyes widened. That whole energy, that warmth, the sensation.
-....
They went away, seeing the other two rooms on that floor, one was with Crowley and some demons that appeared and the other was Lucifer with other demons. The two looked at the situation in the rooms and looked at each other, closing the door and going to the elevator. Yes, the motel has an elevator. “Why do you have an elevator? There are only six floors ”. Dean thought.
While the two were fighting verbally, being prevented from physically fighting by Castiel, Lucifer and Dean put one hand between them and the other on the angel, not understanding anything. The stone in the ring shone in an intense pink, taking the whole environment by the color, including in the eyes of the three, returning to the normal tone.
-That's right!
-What?
Dean lowered his face, already thinking of the worst, Cas was going to dismiss him, he locked his jaw.
He drove again, with that mask on his face is horrible to drive, but they finally arrived. The city is completely deserted, they didn't see anyone, the stores seem open, but without any people, which certainly has something weird, being Friday.
- Shut up and take his legs. And you stay here and don't open the door for anyone. –Castiel nodded.
When he was getting out of the angel, he heard a voice, turned his face, receiving two punches, one in the face and the other in the chest, watching his vision go cloudy until it was all darkness.
Dean sat static on the bed, mouth open, eyes wide. No... It must be wrong. But it's the news, it can't be wrong. It took a few minutes for the plug to fall. Screaming.
-Yes, stop complaining, and let's go.
Lucifer moved his hand with a so-so sign, making Dean angry.
The taller opened the computer, Dean saw where the angel's GPS was indicating, a bar in Wichita, when Sam located the bar, he felt a light tap on his shoulder.
The Winchester concentrated by slowly opening the buttons of the angel's impeccably white social blouse, with each piece of skin he saw, deposited a kiss, a bite or a lick, seeing Castiel contracting them all until he no longer had his blouse, Dean returned getting on her knees, taking off her belt and pants, leaving only the black box, he let out a sigh, a relief that the pants were no longer tightening.
-Three days? But it doesn't seem like we've spent that much time-
-Yes, listen to what he said.
-Eros, as I explained, Anteros and Himeros.
The two looked at each other and turned their faces away.
-Yes! Let's go!
The television is talking about what is happening today, two in the afternoon, on a Monday, it was not Saturday, the TV showed the day, and today is Monday. If it's Monday, how did he fuck Castiel, without sleeping, without eating, without anything? Just pure sex?
Dean put Castiel in the front seat, who said nothing, Crowley sat in the back, trying to get as far from that motel. Damn it! He doesn't find the cell phone.
The Winchester took the angel's arms and lowered him, leaving Castiel between the pillows and many small cushions. Dean kissing his neck while taking off his belt, opened his pants, sliding them slowly, feeling every piece of skin that was revealed, he stopped to see the angel of the Lord wearing only white boxers. He smiled maliciously, seeing the volume in the white box with precum, removing his underwear. Finally, he is completely naked, the youngest looked down at Castiel's body. He has a wonderful body, a defined body but soft to the touch.
Dean bent down and pulled Castiel's cheeks away, licking his entrance, who shivered and moaned muffled.
Of course, it was! Gabriel was driving him crazy by licking his cock very slowly, in torture.
-Forget the cell phone! I want you!
-DON'T DO THAT EVER AGAIN! FOR REAL? - They looked at each other angry.
-I'm feeling Castiel. -Crowley said heading towards the elevator.
-Come on, okay?!
Dean drove as fast as he could, he is very worried, Castiel with Lucifer, that would not work, he thought that the angel had died, but according to the GPS, he is in motion.
-My ass, Dean.
Hi everyone, if there is any wrong grammar please let me know. Thanks!
-Dean, can we sit in that part where have the chairs with cushions?
He didn't find the watch or his phone, when he found the cell phone, which for some reason was inside the nightstand, next to the television control. Damn, the cell has no battery. He turned on the television.
-How about you-
What did he see? In addition to the huge room with a big bed, Lucifer sat on the bed, leaning against many pillows, totally naked, with Castiel, still dressed, but sucking on the archangel. That made the hunter's jaw drop because, despite the sound of the door being opened, the angel had not stopped licking the devil.
Crowley and Lucifer continued to pull Castiel by the arms until the door burst open. Dean took a pillow over his private area. Three people appeared, two women and a man in black suits. They went towards the supernatural beings, stopping and getting on their knees.
Gabriel took the hard and pulsating cock putting it in his mouth, making Sam squirm with pleasure, however, he needed to stay focused, he still has to know where Castiel is and what they were dealing with. But it's hard with Gabriel sucking him like that.
-My? How is mine?
Dean crawled across the floor, his vision blurred, he is very dizzy, he finally reached the edge of the bed, with difficulty getting up. Until the door swings open again. The Winchester slipped, seeing so many people entering the room. There were about ten people who ran towards the bed.
Castiel was still in bed, but next to him is the king of hell and the devil, with some injuries, some bleeding, and bruising, pulling the angel looking like a ping-pong ball.
-Not only beautiful but attractive as well.
-Dean...
-You are not supposed to take this mask off for nothing, understand?
-----------//-------------//---------------//---------------
-Squirrel, come and see this.
The angel looked up, but without stopping the movement back and forth, leaving the hunter red.
-Hey...- Lucifer stood next to Dean. - Hey! I was here first!
-What the fuck?! The fuck happened?
-Dean ... I want ... you.
They arrived in the next town heading towards a construction store, buying the blessed gas mask that Crowley said. He still didn't understand anything that was going on.
-And Lucifer, despite being you, you are still weak, with little grace.
-Round eight?
-Where was the last place you heard about him?
They were getting close to town, about an hour away, Crowley looked around, taking a deep breath. The hunter noticed, but before saying anything, his cell phone rang.
-Why are you laughing?
-Come on.
-I know, I'm going to call someone. Let me know whenever he changes the location.
-It seems that I found a sensitive point ... huh Cas?
-Dean, you are human.
Three women and three men in black lingerie looked delightedly at the archangel, who was still breathing heavily, trying to control his breathing.
-Dean? -Castiel turned to look at the hunter. -What happened?
-Then the call went down! Cas is not answering me anymore!
"Great," he said sarcastically.
-Cas, do you want to go out to eat tomorrow? Since you're out of grace I thought ...
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean slowly opened his eyes, sitting up with his hand on his head, which hurt. What did the hell happen? When he looked down, he saw a red blanket. What the fuck? He got up. Shit! A bathroom! He looked around to see the bathroom, ran towards the toilet, vomiting liquid. When he was finished, he got up slowly.
-I'm not an archangel to have so much energy, I need to compose myself.
-Cas? Castiel?
-I have a moose trapped.
Lucifer's panting seemed he's weak enough for Dean to punch him in the face. He came close to the archangel, but the blonde had noticed, coming out off Castiel quickly, making semen go to the hunter.
-Hello.
-We ...we're going to spawn this son of bitch. -He pointed with his thumb at the man lying on the floor.
