Upon waking up, he finds a contract in his personal email from Stark Industries to hire him as a security consultant. There are so many zeros in the fee he’ll be getting that his teeth chatter. It’s more than he’s made in the last… maybe ever.
“Tony, are you okay?”
It doesn’t help that Tony is squirming on his lap, already babbling about what he wants to do with Steve next… wait what?
“Words, Tony.” That cocky smirk is back.
Tony takes a breath and explains. “So, here’s the thing. Sex can cause people to spread and catch all sorts of things, right?”
category…
Tony grimaces, pulling away suddenly regretful. “Shit Steve, I didn’t really think about that. Has this, I don’t know, brought up bad memories? I should have remembered that medical stuff probably isn’t your thing.”
Tony glances up to see Steve in the bathroom doorway, looking stunned. Fuck.
Okay, right. Captain America has come to his tower in the middle of the night, and gotten down on his knees to explain himself. What is his life that this moment isn’t the most surreal thing that’s ever happened to him?
And sure, every once in a while, he thinks of Tony telling him he would be “
The group decides there are quite a few essential films Peter needs to see to get caught up on the pop culture quips that float around (mainly due to Scott and Tony, but sometimes Sam too). Turns out it’s not just Peter, a pop culture education is needed for Steve, Vision and Wanda as well (who had limited US media in Sokovia growing up).
“I don’t want to crush you.” says Steve.
Steve pulls Tony close into a quick hug, saying “Yeah, I’d like that.”
Steve snorts and rolls his eyes. He’s never been less interested in watching a TV in his life.
He snaps his fingers, and promptly passes out.
Steve must be more sleep deprived than he thought. He’s pretty sure he didn’t say anything about Bucky. Just how important this was, and how he can’t focus on anything else until this is done… oh… he must not have mentioned Tony either.
I'm hoping the tone/style of these last two chapters isn't too jarring. Since we are covering a lot of plot/time from the Infinity War and Endgame movies, I scrimped a bit on exposition since we are all (hopefully) pretty familiar with those!
He shifts onto his side so the issue at hand (ha, he wishes) is less noticeable and just stares. He can’t believe this; Steve is in his bed. His eyes are closed, and he has this small smile on his face that just makes Tony want to…
“That’s right,” says Steve, “Tony and I are together.”
“Tony, I, I need to keep my arms like this to balance you. Can you, I need you to touch yourself.”
Tony is freaked out to say the least, but the more he thinks about it the better it sounds.
As far as Tony knows nothing demonstrable has changed, for Steve or himself. So why is he coming here now?
This chapter is just a heads-up to anyone who wants to follow the series. I'll also happily take suggestions in the comments :)
“You’re going to take me deep again, and while you do you're going to be able to get some friction on that beautiful cock of yours. Wipe up that mess. You can come if you need to, or not, but either way we’re gonna take care of our little precum problem, okay?”
“Alright, on-screen Fri.”
the mind stone. And Vision has an adorable budding relationship with Wanda. So finding them, not hard).
Tony just turns his attention to Thor, who is still going.
Tony murmurs hoarsely; the words reverberate against the glass of the shower and make their way out of the bathroom to Steve’s ears.
“There is a laundry chute in the corner that Sir uses regularly which goes directly into an automated washer, and extra shirts in the bottom drawer to your right Captain.”
“See Cap? Totally under control! In a couple weeks it’ll be like it never happened at all.” He looks at his hand, and feels his eyes start to prick. Fuck.
“So, you like the bed then?” Tony asks as he crawls in, with as straight a face as possible (he isn’t very successful).
Tony lifts his foot out of Steve’s hand and sits up, legs dangling off the edge of the table.
“I don’t
Mantis places her hand on his head once more.
So he does.
Steve comes up for air from his latest bout with Tony to realize his phone has been in his pants this whole time, discarded by the elevator.
Tony whips his head around to see the back of Steve’s naked ass crossing the living area and entering the bathroom. Tony can now faintly hear the music coming from Steve’s earbuds all the way over where he is in the living room. He was just out of Steve’s sight in the curved portion of the living room that is separated from the entryway, but the angle of the view-screen gave Pepper a view of the entire room.
Steve turns around so he’s on his stomach on top of Tony, looking him in the eye.
is a thing he’s looking at. Steve probably doesn’t even know about the… implication of his actions. People probably got down on their knees a ton back in the day. That was a praying thing, right? Steve is probably just doing some old-y time-y penance thing that is in no way sexual. Focus. Steve is saying a lot of important shit.
“What the fuck? I swear Bruce, I’m not even on a juice cleanse!” says Tony.
So yeah, if you’d asked Steve before tonight what the chances were that Tony Stark was interested in him sexually, he would have thrown out a pretty low number. Not zero, because it’s on record that Tony is bi, and over the years he’s definitely made more comments about Steve’s ass than all the other Avengers combined… but no, Steve wouldn’t have ever had the stones to proposition him.
Tony shoots off like a rocket out of the compound, leaving Bruce alone with his frustration.
Steve tries to look at Tony with fresh eyes, and Bruce is right. He really does look better than he did a couple of years ago. Hell, even six or eight months ago.
“I’m… shit I’m sorry Cap, I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable” Tony slides another foot away on the sand as he speaks. Wait, what?
The three of them look and it’s… well it’s obvious. Tony lets out a little disgruntled noise.
His hand continues to sting as Bruce brushes it with some kind of clear liquid. Natasha et. al. wanted some SHIELD medical prick to look at it, but it’s his hand, and his suit (now removed thanks to J’s soft touch) and his fucking arc reactor, so if they want more than cool water and a rag anywhere

sure you have suffered a blow to the head, or are brainwashed, or god, maybe you actually think that I’m
This, will show Steve.
It takes a while for it to totally fade, but it does.
He looks up at Tony and waits.
Puzzle is a euphemism.
But the truth is he can’t concentrate because his wet dream of a boyfriend is making him the best he can be with his magic cock. And Tony has a fantasy that keeps coming to mind over and over, to the point that he can’t even see straight.
All the heat and pleasure that was centered against the mattress shifts and Steve feels it radiating out of his entire body, like he’s on fire. In an instant he’s kissing Tony for all he’s worth, because you can’t just hear something like that and not.... He moves to align their bodies, to finally get some friction, but Tony’s hands come up to still his hips before they press down.
Did he say save the
Steve goes after Tony.
Tony gets there in five seconds.
“Tony, I need you to be still, and quiet.” Steve knows his voice comes out harsh. He doesn’t mean it to be, but the idea that he isn’t in control of himself is… he needs a minute to think.
Steve is pulled out of his reverie when Tony literally pulls him into the open-air stall. It’s a big space, larger than one or even six people really need. There are about 10 nozzles and showerheads coming out from multiple directions, but they blend seamlessly with the design. Steve admires the aesthetic, though it’s a bit modern for his tastes. All sleek chrome and expensive-looking deep gray stone.
He knows he needs to tell Pepper about Steve, but that will come once the team has settled in at the compound. Maybe in a month or two…
So, a plan. Steve is good with plans.
“Of course I want you! How could I not want you Steve?!” He huffs a breath and continues, “You’re this island of solid fucking rock in the middle of a rushing river and everything just seems to slide past you – I don’t know how you do it; I never can. You’re the best thing in my life right now, maybe ever, and you’re so beautiful it hurts. Of course I
Tony and Steve continue to sit in silence. Tony, running through the immense gravity of what Pepper is suggesting. Steve, wrapping his head around frozen eggs, modern science, and working out that chances are 99.9% that what Pepper is suggesting will happen in a lab or a hospital, and she’s not suggesting, well, the traditional method.
Rocket has stuck close to Thor in Quill’s absence. They go in to the city with some regularity, where Thor is such a big celebrity that people don’t even glance at the talking racoon. After Thor he actually seems to get along with Rhodey best. Though Rhodey is suspicious that Rocket's interest seems centered around his leg braces, and if they are detachable, and if he wears them at night.
“You hardly fixed anything; Shuri did most of it.” Nebula deadpans.
“Hey,” Tony turns to Vision, “What do
Steve’s eyebrows shoot up and he looks to Tony for his answer as well.
With that Tony nods and goes back inside to wait in his room. Steve’s going to need to shower before they go to get all the sand off from where it stuck all down his front from laying on the ground. While Steve showers and changes he orders chocolate Macadamia nuts to be served on the plane for the flight to L.A., and texts Pepper to see if she needs the second jet this week. It has two separate compartments with a private bedroom. Maybe he can manage to sleep the whole way back… or at least tell Steve he’s sleeping.
“I don’t think you do, and can we, can we go back inside?” Steve looks shyly down at his feet. That’s weird…
Oh god, Scott has desecrated Captain America with his tiny, pint-sized voyeurism.
Tony shrugs, as much as you can shrug with a naked, two-hundred-pound man on top of you. “He died about five years after my parents, natural causes. Peggy knew him actually; I learned a lot after he died by going through his things. They went on all kinds of adventures.”
Tony raises an impatient eyebrow at him. Right, moving on.
When he’s done he shifts and creakily let’s go of the handrails.
He tells himself he hates it, but if he’s being honest with himself he’s come to anticipate, even yearn for the dreams. Day after day it gets harder to run on less sleep, but every night he lays there as the anticipation builds like an unstoppable wave to its crescendo. At first he could get an hour of rest, then 45 minutes, then 30 before his dreams would jolt him awake, aching, harder than steel and gasping, visions of Tony burned behind his eyelids. Each night he wakes up suddenly and climaxes at the barest touch to the most intense orgasm he’s
“Uh huh, speaking of arm-centric inventions, if you’re such a great engineer, where were you when the gauntlet was being made in Wakanda? You know, the thing
Tony practically runs out of their bedroom to get to the alternate access point to his panic room in order to beat Steve there. Or, it
This latest dream isn’t all that different from the others. It starts with him in the middle of a dark, missy moor. It’s nighttime and he can’t see much through the fog though there’s a full moon. He can hear a hundred voices whispering through the mist. Telling him:
“Tony, I need you to do exactly what I say, okay?”
“Why does everyone keep
But it’s no good, all the balls look the same, and move in the same way. The only thing different about them is how much more advanced they’re getting. At just about the hour mark Natasha notices that one of the floating orbs is just a
Tony tightens his grip on Steve’s hair and grasps the base of his own cock, turning to the side a bit at the same time before twisting back to slap it wetly across Steve’s cheek.
“Good. Let me know when you get tired and I’ll take over.”
The bedding is smooth and silky, and looks very expensive. Steve knows better than to ask how much it costs, if he doesn’t want nightmares about how many people could be fed for what Tony spends on something like bed sheets.
As soon as the screen is gone, Steve jumps Tony and they make out like teenagers for a while. Steve isn’t sure what to make of the joke about getting married, they’re only just telling people after all. But he can’t help smiling into Tony’s mouth at the idea.
Noticed that I put in that Tony has the arc reactor, but that 1796 Broadway is set post Iron Man 3. Now fixed!
Pepper doesn't look convinced.
“Why?” asks Steve.
Tony snorts. “God as much as I think I would enjoy you fucking me in the shower, the bed is probably a better bet for your first time… It is, it’s your first time with a man, isn’t it?”
“I figure he’ll be the easiest. He practically worships you, and if we tell him to keep a lid on it for a couple of days while we catch the rest of the team up, he will.”
… “ Steve’s voice falters and he pauses, head bowed.
Captain America and Iron Man Kiss!
His grip on the handrails is firm but they feel solid. Tony must have upgraded this shower to accommodate his strength, he thinks, as he pulls out and slides deftly back into Tony to the hilt. It feels so good to take him like this, to surround him from behind, while being firmly teathered to the wall. He thrusts once more.
“I know you know, but once again, I am not a medical doctor. Honestly, we may want to bring Cho in if you’re comfortable with that?”
The three of them sit, shell-shocked.
Tony thinks hard, “Umm… Friday?”
- Tony and Rocket have dueling upgrade wars over Thor's arm.
Bruce’s eyebrows raise a fraction. Steve rushed over here before completing his debriefing?
Tony clears his throat and speaks, aware that he can’t really expect Steve to do all the heavy lifting. “Will do, thanks doc, I can tell I’m in good hands.” He grins at Steve and wiggles his eyebrows a bit. Tony has no doubt that “patient Tony” would flirt with Dr. Steve.
Silence meets his confession for several seconds.
“Y-yes. But not much.”
They split their time between the house and the compound. They spend long weekends by the lake and have dinner with Pepper at least a couple nights a week. They don’t have a formal custody agreement, but find a pattern that works for all of them. When Steve is away on missions, Tony always stays in their lake house, soaking in as much time with Morgan as he can.
Which turns into Steve’s stomach growling and Tony insisting they go out to the kitchen and get him something to eat, because really with all the fluids he’s lost, plus not eating in like 24 hours he knows Steve must be getting hangry, and how can they possibly plan the Fate of the Avengers like that?
“Technically this is the living room…”
It all starts when Steve has the audacity to imply that a robot dog would be, quote: “terrifying.” A robot dog that Tony would create. Ridiculous. This is offensive to Tony on so many levels. Steve
“Okay” Tony croaks, mouth suddenly dry.
those comm devices were for official Avengers business only…”
After Siberia, Steve dreams.
Thor has asked Tony to install a new holographic overlay option for his arm, one that looks like the arm has sustained a major injury to help him mislead enemies.
God, his arms look good, he wants to bite the swell of Tony’s biceps. Steve shakes himself, he was trying to tell Tony how happy he is.
But maybe that image is part of what propelled him to accept Steve that night in the tower. His greatest fear manifested, a haunting image of a world where he and Steve never reconciled.
Tony gives in, sliding the finger in up to the knuckle. Suddenly he wants to know what Steve is feeling, what he might be comparing these sensations to.
“Yes Tony, yes, thank you”
Steve looks up, hoping what he’s saying makes a difference. Hoping Tony can finally understand him.
Good. The Star Spangled Man has a Plan, as they used to say.
Seriously... This is just a ton of smut. Like, is there a rating past Explicit? Mild warning - more D/S stuff ahead.
The suite has a little entryway, then a long, curved living area and bar similar to the one in the tower penthouse. There are two doors off of that at the far end, one for the bathroom and one for the bedroom. Steve doesn’t even bother to locate Tony, sure he must be either in the bedroom or in the portion of the living area that’s just out of view.
“Have you ever done this to yourself?”
“Tony, please may I have your cock?”
“Two days.”
Peter webs it down from the sky while Wanda prevents it from getting any more shots off with a forcefield of her magic.
Starting with his first penthouse he designed a custom shower from top to tail, and he’s installed a version of that same shower in almost all the properties he owns since. They are totally custom, and he does all the programming and custom build-outs himself (minus like, masonry, that shits an art he pays people for). Sure the shower’s design has evolved a bit over the years, but his initial model was pretty close to perfection: modular, automated, cutting edge.
It covers the first and second prompts below. I don't know if all of these will turn into parts of the series, but I at least have ideas/outlines for:
Tony presses on. “I need you to hear me now. Me having an erection when we have sex is  meaningless. If my dick fell off tomorrow I would still spend every day giving you pleasure in any way I could, because
Steve rubs the back of his neck to do something with his hands. “I don’t know what to say. I know that’s stupid… I’ve been thinking about what I want to say to you for months. I’ve wanted to see you, talk to you.”
Bucky’s arm is a standard chrome design, because Tony figures at this point Bucky must hate change. For Thor Tony creates an agile, adaptive design that can change color and texture. He knows the Godking secretly likes pomp and circumstance. Thor spends a pleasant afternoon changing his arm’s look on a whim from a realistic flesh-color holographic overlay, to a brilliant gold color, to a shimmering rainbow sheen which according to Thor “indeed could have been mistaken for a dim imitation of the Bifrost.”
Tony can’t focus on what Steve is saying. Partially because he is still in his lap, and wow, yep, this universe can suck it if the only time he is ever in this position is to hear about Steve’s girlfriend. He catches the essentials: Name: Becky, smart, fun, makes Steve happy…
“Perhaps you were worthy once... Are you still?” he asks, before dropping his hammer in the muck at Steve’s feet.
He’s nervous to talk to Steve (and also Tony? Steve is the official leader of The Avengers, but Tony is bank-rolling the whole thing, so it kind of feels like a “don’t ask dad without mom's permission too” kind of deal).
“You’re doing so well Steve. I’m so close, and it looks like you are too.” It’s not a question. “You can have my cock back in your mouth as soon as you want, but you’ll have to do more than ask okay? Do you remember what you need to do?”
He wouldn’t do this if he didn’t have anything to go on, but his strategic mind has pinged a few times throughout their conversation:
“I think you said something about fucking me in the shower?”
“Steve, yes so good, keep going.”
Steve looks mildly confused but not concerned, and follows Tony’s directions, pulling the pants down a few more inches, just enough to allow Tony’s cock to spring out, heavy and flushed. Steve licks his lips, looking up to Tony to see if he has any further instruction.
But he’s rooted to the spot. His throat is closing. He can’t move. It’s like he’s drowning in that icy water all over again and Tony is walking by him, not looking at him. He wants to call out to him. Reach out.
Tony to make it seem like he wasn’t.
"So," Tony says, "You're not straight, then."
“I…” Steve pauses in abject horror realizing that in his haste to get here, combined with his unplanned sleep on the plane he hasn’t actually prepared anything to say.
Some nights he wakes up and he’s already spent himself in his sleep. Those nights are the worst; wiping up the result of his dream with none of the pleasure and twice the mess. Finding ways to clean and hide in close quarters adds a layer of shame and secrecy that’s becoming unbearable.
“Tony, just please this is so much more complicated than I think we are able to deal with right now. More than you know even –”
Steve begins to move, “No time now, Tony, Bruce, Strange, come with me. Sam, get in the air and report back what you see, help any civilians as you can. Wong, can you stay here and standby? If possible, we’ll want to use those rings to get more of the team on the ground once we know what we’re dealing with.”
elevated handrails.
Sam shakes his head but looks like he knows better than to enter into this debate.
“I know, I know, it is not the most honorable request. Some may even call it trickery.” says Thor. As usual Thor has begun a monologue unprompted while Tony works. “It’s not that I want to use underhanded means. More that, after 1,500 years I am starting to see there is a time and place for methods beyond force.”
He can't believe Stark Industries and The Avengers are their first clients.
Tony has said all of this in a single breath. Steve sits perfectly still waiting for Rhodey to react.
Tony doesn’t use a robotic dog to seduce Captain America.
He listens to the voicemail first.
But he also talked them through saving the better part of Manhattan today. And…
“Well, first I was thinking we’d get clean. I wash you, you wash me, simple.” Steve can picture them running their hands all over each other, smoothing Tony’s fancy soaps and creams into every crease and crevasse. He gets even harder and it doesn’t
“Open it up for him, Fri.” he says as he takes two fingertips to the display and spreads them apart, zooming in on Steve’s face. He feels like a voyeur, but the last time he saw Steve he was at a distinct disadvantage, outnumbered and caught off guard. He won’t let that happen again. Steve is on his turf, in his tower. And Tony is still feeling pissed about everything.
Tony turns back to Bruce for an explanation, and is startled to see him tinged with green. He looks like he’s barely holding it together.
Tony feels his cock twitch, but he isn’t anywhere near hard. Doing all that to Steve was as arousing as anything he’s ever done, but he just came less than an hour ago. And unlike some people he’s not a thirty-year-old super soldier with unlimited erections.
“I really
To no ones surprise, LASS-E is the ring bearer three years later at their wedding.
“Good, great, okay well enjoy having all this space to yourself, feel free to, you know, make yourself at home.”
Steve just faces it all head-on. No fear. Of course he would treat this the same. Steve stands and moves toward Tony, confidence radiating off him.
“It’s about Tony.”
“Thanks JARVIS. Please take me down to Bruce’s lab.”
Her face relaxes somewhat. Over the last few months they’ve found a rhythm. Almost all of their interactions are based around SI or the Foundation, but things nearly feel normal again. The break-up was almost five months ago, and Tony knows he’s been handling it better than any of their previous breaks or break-ups.
Steve exchanges a glance with Tony that very clearly says “Let’s do this.” Is there anything Steve doesn’t just throw himself into? It makes Tony feel a little invincible.
“Tell them… tell them I’ll be there as soon as I can.” Steve sighs and rubs his face quickly with his still-gloved hands before turning toward the elevators.
Steve blanches.
?” Tony’s voice pitches up and suddenly he looks even more wrecked than when he thought Steve’s feet were burned. “Steve – look, I just… I don’t care about hula girls.” He looks up to the sky and shakes his head slightly like he does when he’s about to do something reckless, then looks Steve in the eye and says:
Steve flushes in pleasure.
They lay there for a while just enjoying each other’s warmth.
He builds Pepper a lake house so that she and Morgan can have privacy, a nice quiet existence away from the city. And also according to Tony so that Morgan can grow up to be “Country Strong,” (whatever that means, Steve can’t seem to get a real answer). He builds a similar home for him and Steve on the adjacent property.
It hits him like a ton of bricks that he’s… happy. Just, totally happy in a care-free way he hasn’t felt in so long.
Steve rubs his cheek against Tony's palm and moves to pull at the too-soft pants, anxious to make Tony’s plan a reality.
As Nebula settles into the sofa, she cringes.
“My… new phone?”
Steve rubs Tony's arm, brow furrowing.
Tony wants to hear Steve give more medical talk, so he asks, “I’ve definitely had a prostate exam, but… this treatment, it’s more invasive, right?” Tony lets a nervous lilt creep into his tone.
Bruce asks his questions.
“I know this isn’t something to take lightly. The team, and the “us stuff.” I’m in this, Tony. All of it. Completely.”
He adds more soap to the cloth and drags it along Steve’s perineum and then carefully over his balls.
As much as Tony wants to jump into their doctor/patient roles the next day, what he has in mind requires some prep work. He doesn’t want to half-ass this by having Steve throw on a white coat and examine him on their bed in the suite.
Thor examines the arm and sees he added a retractable sight-laser, and a special grip on the shoulder that is just the right size for Rocket’s hands. “Yes,” Thor says, strangely moved that Rocket wants to ride with him during their many forthcoming adventures, “this will do nicely.”
“My question, Steve, is if you come now, will you be able to get hard for me again tonight?”
All of them work together as one to immobilize Thanos.
Bruce pulls up a new holo-screen and gets ready to record their findings.
Tony >> 🇺🇸🤖🕷️💛
Because instead of working into Tony with his tongue, he begins
“Shh, it’s okay Tony. You’ve done so much. For everyone. For me. Will you let me? Let me take care of you?”
“Steve, relax man, we all know you and Tony are together.” He shakes his head, like he can’t believe Steve is this slow on the up-take.
Tony whines, pulling at the sheets. “Please Steve, let me touch you. Please, please.”
Steve pulls Tony close, once again supporting his weight easily. They make out lazily until Tony's tongue starts setting an insistent rhythm against Steve's own. Diving over and over, seeking out any traces of his own taste.
Tony can’t move fast enough, wiggling up to rest his head on the pillow, still keeping his knuckles on the headboard, arms now bent at ninety degree angles.
“Tony… Tony there’s something wrong with your blood sample. You need to get down here.” Bruce sounds worried. Really worried.
Steve feels… he doesn’t know what this is. This warm, unwavering acceptance radiating off of Tony’s best friend. He starts to get a bit choked up.
candy,’ it is stupid to try and make dirt taste sweet and make candy from it.” says Drax.
Sam>> Always. We really coming home? What about Ross?
Tony stops pacing and notices he’s managed to walk into Steve’s personal bubble. Steve who is still
Rather than be medically retired after the paralysis, Rhodey pushed to finish his active duty contract and complete his 20 years. The equipment Tony designed for him means he can do anything an able-bodied person can (actually his legs are about 20x stronger). Tony is proud of him, but he will be glad when he’s home for good, and an official member of The Avengers.
-la.”
Steve smiles dopily.
trilogy.”
The memory of his dream is crashing back over him like a wave. He's done it. Let go, given everything he has to Tony, and god if it didn’t feel harder than fighting him.
Under Strange’s recommendation, Vision is immediately brought to Wakanda's science division to get the stone removed. Shuri and Tony have an emergency science jam session. Together they ensure Vision is fully functional without the stone, and Tony creates a new gauntlet to hold the stones. Suri has some pretty incredible suggestions that should divert a decent amount of the harmful power of the stones from the wearer, and Nebula shows Tony a type of cold fusion welding he’s never seen before.
Tony groans at the knowledge that this thing Steve is doing, it’s uniquely his, because any normal fucking person wouldn’t be shifting someone else’s entire body weight to manually fuck their ass over their tongue. Tony starts to rock up, pulling at the backs of his knees to force his ass up harder.
“Tony never stops talking about you, Steve.”
Steve sits there for a moment. He’s in the future, and a robotic dog has just told him that Tony Stark loves him. He turns to Tony, who looks both horrified and proud.
“Now Steve, suck me no—”
Steve moves over to the small counter with the sink and slowly puts on a pair of blue latex gloves. Next to the box of gloves on the counter is a large tube of medical lube, and series of dildos that range in size. Steve examines them for a long moment and then brings one over to Tony to see.
“Steve, you beautiful genius,
Steve realizes that with the way the platform is positioning them, it’s easy for him to lean forward a bit and capture Tony’s mouth where it’s waiting for him, Tony’s head lolled back against his shoulder.
Tony moves over to the bench and nudges at Steve’s arm. “Scoot over, soldier.”
Tony retracts his finger in favor of tracing the rim. He circles Steve’s opening several times until the tip of his finger slips in again, continuing to circle, catching at the rim of Steve’s entrance, and gently stretching it. Round and round.
He has the urge to roll his eyes, or laugh, but does neither. He’s too wound up.
Steve replaces his mouth with two fingers so he can access Tony’s prostate, moving his mouth up against Tony’s testicles “Touch yourself Mr. Stark, that's it.” Steve says and then sucks on Tony’s sack gently as he assertively strokes his prostate. Tony comes for a second time, covering his own chest and abdomen as he cries out “Steve!”
- Steve washes Tony's armor as promised ;)
about this alright Tony?”
Bruce is finishing now. He needs to tell Tony… he has to say something.
Tony almost snorts at that, but Steve continues on, “In fact, it’s perfectly normal for the procedure to feel pleasurable. There’s no need to feel embarrassed if you get aroused, that’s to be expected.”
Tony answers and before Steve can register more than that Tony isn’t wearing a shirt, the room is empty and Tony has run out onto the deck yelling “last one to the beach is a rotten econosolv!”
He’d be embarrassed, but wouldn’t leave. He’d watch Tony for a whole minute, frozen, not sure what to do. Tony wouldn’t break the rules. He wouldn’t ask Steve to join him, he’d just look at him through the glass, taking in Steve’s beautiful fucking form, and parted, shocked lips until he couldn’t help but gasp “Steve.”
“God, look at you” says Tony, as he cups Steve’s face with one hand, the other still on Steve’s shoulder.
Peter >> Stony confirmed!! Srsly, from the man himself, you owe me $
Tony growls in irritation. “Are you telling me my comms tech is getting ganked by wind?
The shelf column on the right retracts and after a few moments the floor opens up and a bench about five feet long and two and a half feet deep raises up from the ground. It has very simple construction, just a hollow stone base, and a memory foam top similar to the floormats. Steve immediately shuffles over to it and slumps down, leaning his head back against the cool stone wall.
He says it like it’s a foregone conclusion, and maybe it is in all those of futures he’s seen.
Steve shooting him a blinding smile while he looks up at him like Tony is his own personal Jesus isn’t helping either.
in his warmth as it bleeds through his leather jacket, smile hidden under his helmet. And Steve grips Tony’s arm with the burned hand that can’t grip as well, and holds it tighter against him on the sharp turns to make sure he’s secure. Tethering him close.
But he doesn’t answer. He appears to be having some sort of fit, his head is moving so fast Steve can't fully track his movements.
That bit about the hula girls. Maybe he really does want to go relax and take in a good time with some random dame. Steve could be completely off base. He has been before.
Tony takes a second to collect himself. “Damn it, Steve, who taught you
“Okay what, Steve?”
Tony’s eye glaze over and he lets out a strangled, surprised moan, arching up, pressing his upper body into Steve and his lower body into the empty covers above him.
“Steve?”
No, it looks like Steve is just... looking for something at the back of Tony’s throat… with his tongue. Now he's picking him up, and grabbing his - oh wow, make that 5% gay. He’s definitely 5%, maybe 10% gay for Captain America
Tony’s helmet retracts. “Well A, I don’t know do I? Because Friday has designed all the obstacles so I’m impartial. And two, bite your tongue. Start Wars is a part of the mainstream culture.”
God it’s all so unbearable.
“Like what, Steve? Like some kind of a whore?” Tony’s tone is sharper, and Steve feels stung. He didn’t mean to call Tony that! That’s the opposite of what he’s saying.
As usual Tony hasn’t paid much attention to what he has said, and is about to ask why his foot is being held hostage.
He can’t stop thinking about being pushed up against a wall.
“Hey, hey, no nothing is ruined. It’s the opposite Steve.” He squeezes the muscles under his hands, trying to pry out the tension that’s amassed there. Hmm he should send Steve to his masseuse. Or maybe this is just how Steve’s shoulders are? So much muscle… Right, focus. “Look, I’m not going to pretend everything is solved. There’s gonna be a lot of work moving forward, as a team, and for you and me.”
“Oh, yes! I had noticed you two were getting quite handsy with one another. What wonderful news. I shall happily come along on your date to celebrate your love.” Thor is all smiles.
Tony is trying to do the right thing.
How can Tony think he would… but oh god, why
If anyone has preferences or something else they want to see, I'm open to your thoughts!
He can’t stand to move Tony fully off his length anymore, he’s just taking him up a couple inches and right back down, creating a fast, shallow ride for them both, rutting hard against’s Tony’s prostate as Tony speeds up his hand on his own cock.
"Be safe, Cap. We'll be-" says Sam. He breaks up as they enter the upper atmosphere.
“Mr. Stark, I don’t see why I have to, they’re the Avengers! I’m seeing
His hand falls back to his side. Maybe he didn’t have access to the building after all. Maybe Friday is testing him, or let him get this far at Tony’s directive only to stop him here. He hopes Tony is actually in the tower. Steve knows he was in New York as of yesterday for a charity gala. Something promoting STEM for kids in low-income populations.
Next up, Steve and Tony work on a puzzle.
“I’m – I need you to keep still and just let me move you. I’m feeling… god I’ve never felt like this. I need to focus 100% on this because I’m worried if I let go, if I get carried away, I could hurt you. How I move in you needs to be highly controlled. I need you control you. Do you understand?”
Next up, Scott joins the team at the compound... And accidentally becomes a peeping Tom. Both things are exciting and upsetting in different ways for him.
Steve pulls back, running a hand through Tony’s hair and firmly grasping a handful of it to angle his head to be sure Tony is looking him right in the eye. Then he sets a serious look on his face and says in his best Captain America voice:
Tony has never.
Bruce has stopped typing and cuts Tony off. “Steve’s right Tony, let’s stick to my questions. That will make this as painless as possible.”
, I was just trying to illustrate that while our personal relationship may impact the team, I don’t think it’s an
“Alright Mr. Stark, just relax, the first position is the easiest if you haven’t done this before. I need you to get off the table, and then lean forward over it.”
Steve looks up from Tony’s groin and into his eyes with unnerving calm as he moves forward a little bit, managing to look like some kind of jungle cat. He’s close now, close enough that he could reach out and touch Tony...
Steve gives him another encouraging smile and says, “Lay back and I’ll check to make sure you’re not having any pain before we begin. I won’t proceed with the treatment without telling you what I’m doing and what to expect, alright?”
Steve bottoms out and seems to lose track of his mouth as he blurts “So good, you feel so good in me Tony. Everything. Everything you do is good. Perfect, you’re so perfect to me. For me. In me.”
Tony’s brain is blanking out. Not only is hot doctor Steve going to fuck him, he’s going to control when Tony can come.
He’s hard again, and he feels almost frustrated about it. Except, Tony looks so… adorable. It’s an odd thing to call Iron Man, but here he is on Steve’s lap, grinning like an idiot, or like… like some sort of sex imp. Steve is sure Tony would prefer the moniker of Sex God, or Patron Saint of Sex or something… and well, in Steve’s opinion those fit too. Steve isn’t sure if he can even come again. He feels wrung out, like he must have released every ounce of semen in his body. He’s glad the shower automatically washed away the evidence of his last orgasm sprayed against the shower wall. It was obscene.
Steve is there, standing on his own two feet, pulling a car off an old man’s leg. He’s yelling to a passer-by.
Bruce pauses for a moment at that, then shrugs, if Tony wants Steve in the loop that’s his call.
“Same." Tony kisses Steve's temple. "I hope you aren’t feeling at all self-conscious about how experienced you are, because seriously, that was the hottest sex of my life. 100%, no questions, the Best with a capital B.”
“Oh my
Nebula looks at Shuri for confirmation. Shuri shrugs, but when Tony catches her eye, nods in agreement. “Ah yes, I have heard of that. It is… an essential part of the bonding process. Upgrades, of course.”
So what, so he’s caught Captain America jerking it in his bed, totally normal. Tony can be an adult about this. “Okay, yeah, just yell when you want me to come out!”
“But,” Bruce continues, “I should also tell you that it seems to me from your actions that you probably don't really agree with that statement.”
As Steve continues to pet Tony, his brain catches up to the events of the day. He recalls something else. Something Tony told Rhodey earlier.
“Can we go take a shower, maybe eat something, and then curl up in bed? Leave figuring out The Fate of the Avengers until the morning?”
Steve clears his throat, “I’m, I’m so glad you feel that way. I hope you know how sorry I am that everything went the way it did in Germany. That I take full responsibility for not handling the Accords or the situation with Bucky the way I should have.”
Tony doesn’t seem to know what to do with the praise, so he redirects. “Fuck Steve, you’re so gorgeous. Above me like that.” Tony presses his hands against the headboard hard enough that Steve’s enhanced hearing can make out the wood giving a little.
joins them for his first training session. Tony insists that he keep his mask on the whole time.
about a security test would defeat the purpose… he opens his report in his pad and suggests a solution - a quarterly team building event where everyone leaves the compound for the afternoon. That way he has an opportunity to conduct a security review with everyone out, and Friday will be none-the-wiser. Plus he can probably attend most of them, a yearly check should be enough for a place as secure as the compound.
- Tony teases Nebula more and finds out she has a crush (Captain Marvel? Bucky? Sam? ... Loki? They are both blue, hmm)
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong? What’s wrong is that this is the first time in over a month I have the chance to have your cock in my ass, and you’re out running!”
Tony deftly adds more lube to a second finger and asks his next question.
Tony doesn’t know what to say, he wants to say “me too” but that seems a little low-effort given the declaration Steve has just made.
He’s half hoping that as soon as the door closes, that’s exactly what Tony will do, but then they will
you.”
He smiles his best smile and says: “She sounds like a hell of a girl, Cap.” He knows his eyes are bright, and he doesn’t care. He has to look at Steve in the eye and show him that he understands.
Set post Chapter 119: Black Out All of Manhattan, from “1796 Broadway.” Iron Man and Captain America were called in from Japan to deal with a security breach involving the arc reactor. Iron Man flew in the suit; while Captain America took SHIELD transport and had to watch from afar via live video feed.
"He mourns." she says.
Bruce chimes in now, and he’s
It's a testament to how much he trusts Tony that he can acknowledge that to himself, let alone tell Tony about it. He knows he has to say something.
The point is, he’s trying. And no one is making him this time. No one made him go to medical to get his hand looked at… no one is making him reign in the dozens of hurtful things he wants to say about
His dreams come back to him, and the negative feelings he associates with being vulnerable subside. He’s relieved he doesn’t have to hide behind the Captain America persona. He always tried to reconcile the two; convince himself that Captain America is who he is even out of the uniform. But he’s only Steve, now. And he’s desperate, and he feels 100 fucking percent laid bare and he hopes it’s enough. He keeps looking up, refusing to back down, but not in defiance. It’s surrender.
Steve takes the opportunity to pull one of Tony’s fists to him. He looks at the knuckles, they’re red but not bad. He opens the hand, stiff from being clenched for so long. He rubs it and works firm pressure into the palms, then down each finger. He lays the hand down on the bed at Tony’s side and presses it into the mattress a little. A silent signal to keep it there. He picks up the other hand from where it rests against the headboard.
Tony groans. “Friday, tell Pepper I need to call her later.”
Whirlwind’s defeat is a footnote in the news cycle the next day. Instead the headlines that dominate every media outlet, social media site and conversation are:
Steve>> Sorry, I know I’ve been unresponsive. Tony and I have covered a lot of ground, and we have a plan in place to bring everyone home.
“Sometimes… I want to dig into Strange about the multiverse. The other realities. 53,000 out of 14 million… those odds nag at me. I think about how there must be so many Steves out there that never came to the tower that night, so many Avengers that couldn’t prevent the snap.”
Tony gapes like a fish, silently reflecting that if his doctor
Steve relaxes immediately. He trusts Tony.
But Tony pulls his hands away before he can move the pants down even a few inches.
He takes the small pillow from the top of the table and slides it under Tony’s backside, before sitting back on his rolling chair and sliding as close as possible. Tony gasps as Steve’s fingers slide into him, rubbing at the ejaculate still inside.
Tony yawns and rubs drool from his beard and smiles as he stretches. His t-shirt rides up just a bit as his sweatpants ride down, and Steve catches a glimpse of the shape of the muscles in Tony’s torso that run down diagonally, forming a “V” shape toward Tony’s…
He slides forward to rest his forehead on Tony’s lower abdomen, his nose brushing the top edge of his drawstring pants. He huffs a breath of relief before sliding his hands, still on Tony’s hips, back and down a bit to firmly grasp the swell of his ass.
Steve moves on to training, and after that the meeting begins to wrap. Tony has one last item.
“I like the bed” says Steve, as Tony slides in. Steve pulls Tony to him up against his front so they are chest to chest. Tony doesn’t even comment on the fact that Steve’s shirt is gone, just wraps an arm around him before telling JARVIS “lights out.”
So no one is making him do the “right” thing here, but he’s figuring it out. And the result is that he gets to be around Steve.
“M’good.” says Tony.
One afternoon the week before they are set to leave, Thor is down in Tony’s workshop having a new setting installed in his arm.
Tony has been there right along with Steve in the months since the Chitauri, since The Avengers became... whatever The Avengers are. He's pretty sure he knows more about the real Steve than anyone else (anyone still living anyway...). He knows Steve.
After giving the same treatment to his other hand, he presses it to the mattress on Tony’s other side.
Steve hates the idea of some random cleaning service cleaning up after them like that, but he’s so sticky with sweat and drying ejaculate that he just gets up off of Tony and rights himself on the side of the bed. He offeres a hand to Tony to help him up.
He likes to think he felt that way with Pepper too. But his feelings for Steve are shining some clarity on his previous relationship. Of course he cared for her, loved her. But now that he’s on the other side of it he’s realizing how much he held back when they were together. How much he dreaded talking to her about what was wrong, because it always felt like it must be him.
“You need to be completely honest. You need to be honest with Becky,” Steve winces, he really should be more concerned about Becky; “You need to be honest with Tony, and most of all you need to take a hard look at where you are and be honest with yourself.”
This is very helpful when attempting to isolate what a high ranking General is saying across the room at top secret meeting; not so helpful while lying in Tony’s bed trying to will away the most persistent erection of his life.
Maybe if Tony had been there, he thinks. But wherever Loki is (Thor is convinced the snap brought him back, but they haven’t seen him), Tony doesn’t want to know about it.
“I’m fine Pep, just caught me mid-workout. You know how it goes, can’t Avenge if you skip cardio.”
, it’s just… he’s realizing that telling people about their relationship is also basically him coming out over and over? Which he hadn’t done before now because... Well, he's actually not sure why he hasn’t. And now it’s all happening so quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve swallows.
Tony feels that sharp feeling flare up again. “Pepper, honestly I thought it was pretty common knowledge that I’m bi? It’s on my Wikipedia page! I wasn’t going to like, check guys out in front of you, okay? And what even does that have to do… I’m not really sure why my sexuality is suddenly on trial?”
“Pepper, thank you for your concern. I know this has come as a shock, and again, I am so sorry you found out this way.” Good, good, that’s a good start. Really mature.
They had been so close, so close to… well, if he had any doubt about Tony’s self-control, he had no doubts now. Steve isn’t sure what Tony meant by “make yourself at home,” but he can’t bring himself to masturbate in Tony’s bed. Steve’s no stranger to taking care of business quickly; war isn’t exactly a take-your-time kind of environment… but Tony’s bed isn’t a barracks or a pitch tent in the field. As silly or romantic as it may seem, he doesn’t just want to get off here in Tony’s bed alone. He wants Tony to be here, he wants it to mean something…
“I’m going to touch you now, just to get a look at the area. Then I’ll be applying the lubricant, and begin the process to prepare you for the treatment.”
“Yeah that’s difficult Bruce… I guess I have been feeling just… good? Sleep has been better, I have more energy, it’s easier to focus. Oh, wait I think I’ve got one!” he looks triumphant.
“How long exactly have you been sexually active with one another?” says Bruce.
“Apologies Captain, you’re spacial awareness and observation skills are usually quite apt, I had assumed you would ascertain the situation on your own upon entering.”
Not in their secret sex bunker.
He thought it would
“Yeah, and apparently jokes about disabilities get funnier by the minute out here.” Rhodey rolls his eyes, but Tony suddenly wants to crack some skulls. “What are those assholes saying?”
"I could finally rest. And watch the sun rise on a greatful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
Steve clears his throat. “I uh, I would say I already enjoyed it.”
Steve is struggling to understand. What Tony is saying, it feels like the warm sun on a snow drift. Thawing out his fears. But…
“Please Steve, please…”
“I think we just need to talk to people, and bring it up one on one or in small groups. Organically. When people are relaxed. That way we can field any questions that they have as friends and house-mates. Once everyone knows, you can add it to the agenda of the next Avengers meeting under “Interpersonal Relationships” to give people a forum to bring up how it might affect the team. Honestly, we will probably want to use that opportunity to check in with Wanda and Vision too. They obviously are all over each other, and we need to get them on the same page about how that might impact their actions in the field."
“Steve, haha, wha-“
Tony’s totally gone. He’s pressing himself up against the glass, working himself frantically with one hand while the other slides back to his ass, squeezing and massaging. Steve’s hands would be bigger, oh god.
Steve tries not to collapse against the back wall of the elevator in relief, aware that he’s probably being watched by Friday, or Tony. Probably both. He still doesn’t have a plan, other than some general idea about proving to Tony that they can come back from this. The ride is short and he feels the air metaphorically suck out of the elevator as the doors open.
“Tony…” Steve moans in a desperate whine.
“Oh Steve. Okay, what I want… first I want to be very clear and reiterate that I am insanely turned on, and have been all night. Again, the spirit is willing, but the body… That said, I actually kind of get off on the idea of you fucking me while I’m soft? I know I just gave you a pretty speech about the deeper meaning of sex, but sometimes… things are just fucking hot.”
Tony takes pleasure in going to sleep every night with Steve in the suite, and when things are quiet disappearing with him for hours during the day undisturbed.
He can hear Steve move around him, to remove the dildo and roll the chair out of the way. Tony groans as it slides out.
He feels hot tears prick in his eyes as another massive wave of embarrassment comes on, almost too much to take...
This part is set post Chapter 110: Time away from the world, from “1796 Broadway.” Tony and Steve have just reunited in Japan, where Tony is still recovering from a post-Pepper-break-up-binge/car accident. Tony has asked Steve to go to Hawaii with him for some R & R and hula girl fun (*cough*). Steve has a girlfriend he has not told Tony about.
Tony makes small encouraging noises, a litany of soothing babble tumbles from his mouth as Steve works.
He wakes up with a single unrelenting thought: that he needs to get to Tony. Then he comes all over himself while sucking on a corner of his pillow.
Rocket looks from Steve to Tony, then says to Steve “Huh
Tony in turn, where he once would have made some cutting crack about Steve just grins in response and says, “Right, the point is the kid needs to be trained up too. He’s in sort of a holding pattern as a “potential future Avenger.” So, once a month with his aunt’s permission he’ll be joining our training sessions, like a baby-Avenger field trip. That is, assuming everyone is good with that?”
Tony rubs a hand over his mouth. Jesus, Steve liberated a concentration camp, and it kind of shaped his world-view... What can he say to that? So he says nothing.
“Wow, I’m so sorry, I haven’t even told you what’s going on. This was a bad idea… I’m sorry; I’ve got to get back to my debriefing.”
your sorry and the
Steve keeps up the unhurried movement of his fingers and moves up Tony’s body so that he can kiss him. “So you’re saying you trust me?”
Steve is catching up now, and beginning to blush. “Right, sorry Bruce, we told the team just a few weeks after the reunification, but you were gone… and then Thanos, and then you were off in the Alps…”
, and Tony is pretty sure he’s having a stroke. Or Steve is. What is happening here?
“Yeah... I know, they are.” says Tony.
Tony brings his hands together, grinning like a maniac. “Everything you need is in a package on the bed. I figured we could both shower and then get to it.”
A smooth stream of water adjusts so it runs down the base of Steve’s head and over his shoulders. Tony angles the water a bit more to wet Steve’s hair and then puts it back to run over his shoulders, grabbing one of the bottles next to him on the shelves.
- Steve and Tony break-in the compound shower with one of the level Red settings...
Steve moves to take Tony’s hands from where they are resting on his hips and tugs them so they’re up on the pillow. He entwines their fingers and re-settles his weight over Tony’s body, pressing his hands down over Tony’s pinning them to the pillow above his head. Steve kisses Tony slow and deep, holding his arms firmly but carefully in place.
Tony continues to frantically rant while pushing Steve back toward the house. Steve figures if Tony were physically able he would be carrying him bridal style at this point to keep him off the hot sand. Steve blushes. And yeah, now that he thinks about it, the sand is pretty hot… he just had more important things on his mind.
Eventually Steve lets Tony free (Tony doesn’t
“What did you think about me?” Tony asks, both fingers stretching him.
“I – that is, this dinner with Tony and I, Thor, it’s actually a… date? Sorry I think in the commotion of Thanos we didn’t get a chance to tell you. We’re dating, or um together, you know.” Steve’s cheeks are pink.
And Jesus fuck if they aren't a total match sexually. Tony loved Pepper, but their sex life wasn't exactly what he would call ideal. It wasn't anyone's fault, and he felt lucky that someone like Pepper even wanted to be with him. So a somewhat subdued bedroom wasn't a deal breaker.
, and what you
He can pretty much do whatever he wants, he just needs to keep an eye on Tony’s reactions. Lean into the things Tony seems to like and move on from anything that doesn’t get a strong reaction. It’s a lot like a fight, or an interrogation. Taking what you want and balancing that against what the other person wants. And Steve has about a million things he wants to do to Tony.
Tony’s hips jerk again, forcing his cock up against Steve’s ass, but the angle is wrong, so it just glances off.
It’s enough to make Steve pause. Dream-Tony was always commanding, very in control. The idea that Steve can do whatever he wants with Tony is a bit overwhelming. He moves off Tony a bit so he can look up at him, bringing his hands around to the silken strings that keep his insanely soft pants up.
Tony makes both Bucky and Thor new arms. Many jokes are made about them being the one-arm-wonder-twins. Bucky tries to insist that the arm he got in Wakanda is fine, great even. Tony won’t hear of it, and after Steve tells him to just go with it, he acquiesces.
“Fuck Steve, are you okay? Do you have a head injury? Is there a gas leak? Have you been exposed to heavy metals?? I’m – I’m not, what even… help me out here because I’m really lost. Last I knew you were very straight, and also more in the camp of 'leaving Tony in Siberia is not something I regret.'”
“Oh god, this is… yep things are about to get awkward.”
Steve laughs and buries his face in Tony’s chest.
What he doesn’t say is that Pepper took a special interest in this rug, like hunted for it for months, flew to Milan to buy it at auction. She then heavily debated allowing it to be, well, a rug. Something about it being art, priceless, something that people shouldn't walk on… and although he is on okay terms with her given everything, he’s pretty sure she will literally rip his windpipe out of his neck if he lets so much as a drop of anything get on the rug.
He has to get to Tony. He has to fix this somehow. Whatever it takes.
The nerves he has about finally talking to Tony are building, but he can’t regret his decision to do it in Hawaii. Japan was a toxic place for Tony; hopefully Hawaii will be a place he can really start to recover (both from the accident and the pain of his split with Ms. Potts).
Below is a conversation between Steve and Bruce after Tony storms out.
Thanks to PerplexinglyParadoxialPerson who pointed out anyone subscribed to this story would not be notified if it was made a series and updated, so I will post a placeholder chapter once the next part of the series goes up.
Tony comes with a muffled shout, covering the glass. He slowly slides down to his knees so his legs don’t give out from under him. That would be just what he needs, for Steve to burst in and see him incapacitated in the shower from coming too hard.
Bruce shakes his head. “I don’t understand how this could happen. The similarities in your blood to the super soldier serum almost look like you’re getting micro-doses of the serum? Your DNA is almost the same as your old sample, 90-something percent I’d guess without further analysis. But these markers,” he points to the little flags on the sample, “they definitely point to a fundamental change in your blood, your DNA.”
“Okay I can agree to that, good call about Wanda and Viz.” says Steve. “So… who should we talk to first? It will probably spread pretty quickly once we start…”
Steve is about to turn to leave and regroup when there’s a distinct clicking noise, followed by quick a series of sliding bolts and minute beeps he’s only able to pick up because of his enhanced hearing. They mean the door is now unlocked, he’s in. He makes sure nobody is passing by in either direction and slips through, the door swings silently shut behind him.
Peter shoots webs, Quill shoots guns, Drax stabs, Mantis drops out of one of Strange's portals directly above to grab Thanos' head and make him groggy. Nebula shows up and attacks him with the pent-up rage stored from of a lifetime of abuse.
That’s how they all end up in Tony’s workshop, adapting pieces of the armor and Tony’s nano tech to repair as much of the damage they can. Thanos inflicted untold horrors on Nebula's body over the years; turns out Shuri was right, repairing her is a crutial step to the bonding process.
Tony goes slack against him, losing himself in his narration. "Yeah Steve, just come, we both know you probably won’t even go soft. Come in me and keep fucking me, fill me with your come and come again, then plug me back up, make me keep it inside. Let me wear the plug again with everything you can give me, keep part of you while we eat dinner tonight with the team, plugged up and full of you, nobody will know, just for you…”
Tony is already typing something away on his Stark Pad, probably… calling (?) the plane.
“One more thing, we cannot, under any circumstances, bring the one you call Vision here. He has the mind stone, and if Thanos gets ahold of that, our odds go down insurmountably.”
“So,” says Steve, who are we telling next?”
. I didn’t mean to lead with what I
Tony isolates the screen titled “Exoneration Timeline”  and says “Er so, I wasn’t planning on bringing this to you until it was more solid, and also I was pissed and kind of thought it was a pipe-dream? But maybe if you guys get on board early that will actually help build our case…”
Tony squeezes his hands so hard that Steve is sure it would hurt if he didn’t have the serum. As it is, it’s a nice firm feeling, grounding him.
Steve follows Tony and shakes his head, and trying to stop his skin from heating. He mutters, “I don’t know what that means.”
“Okay, so, what were you thinking when you chose these settings?” Steve asks as he eyes the mini platform and
Tony barks a surprised laugh, and takes a moment to rake his eyes over Steve before throwing his hands out in a “carry on” motion…
Steve is so hard it hurts. He can’t tell if he wants to come or not. Tony said he could. He probably should. Since his dreams started, he’s found it difficult to come just once. Usually it takes two or three times for his body to finally calm down.
Tony just stares for a few seconds. He can’t stand it, it’s too perfect. He wants to give it a firm, hard slap. But no, he’s going slow, spanking is probably something to work up to. You never know what may trigger Steve’s super-soldier fighting reflexes.
“I’m going to give you a third finger now Tony.”
Tony loses days on the project. It’s almost like when he built the Mark II; nothing stops him. Steve comes down a few times to try to get him to take a break. Tony doesn’t even hear him as he plays back different barks from over 100 dog breeds and calculates the perfect curvature of the ears. Bruce even comes in to try and reason with him. Tony plays the Great Dane bark to the tune of “We Will Rock You” until he gives up and leaves.
“I don’t know that I understand, or know how to feel about that.” says Steve. “… but I guess if she can help us answer these questions, let’s hear it.”
Did he say don’t worry about
Tony leans back against Steve’s strong arms, grasping himself tight. He throws his head back and let’s go.
“So, what did you think of rimming? Kind of ended up being a rush job there at the end, next time we’ll start there so you can really enjoy it.”
“The next time you want to shrink down and do a
“That’s funny, Ranger Rick, because I’m pretty sure you can’t.” Tony is only half-focusing on Rocket. Almost every conversation they’ve had revolves around Rocket’s insistence that Tony is “only a genius on this planet.”
“Oh, isn't it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Is it a movie too? I have a list… but I’ve actually been reading a lot of children’s fiction… it’s nice, it keeps my mind occupied but there’s never anything in them that makes me think of the bad stuff, you know?”
“This is not funny, Tony. What if we are called away from each other for a long period of time before we figure this out? What if this really harms you? I need you to take this seriously!” Steve is red again, but this time it’s in anger.
“You ever consider becoming a psychologist, doc?” Steve teases, standing up.
Milan, Shanghai, Seattle… Tony has been traveling for months making business contacts and attending conferences. Steve writes him every day. Sometimes they are really just doodles of things going on around the tower (one especially explosive entry -- and the one that finally gets Tony to start writing him back in earnest -- is a doodle of Natasha kissing the Hulk with little hearts above their heads and the caption “Seriously, this is happening”).
and he gets an extra little spring in his step. Who wouldn’t?
Pepper says it’s fine if Tony leaves the plane they flew to Hawaii in L.A., and that the other one will be there for them to change planes when they arrive.
Steve seems to sense his genuine distress and comes back over to lightly touch Tony’s back.
Steve leans down to kiss Tony now, trying to communicate what he’s feeling. He wants to protect Tony from ever losing anyone ever again, even though that’s impossible. He wants to tell him that he understands, that’s he’s not alone.
He pulls away. “Tony, I told you before, I’m in this. All in.”
work. I think your way of leadership works.
“Tony…” Steve’s tone is hesitant, but he’s hard against Tony’s abdomen.
Tony’s hips jerk involuntarily. If Steve wasn’t who he is, it might have been strong enough to buck him off. As it is, it just reminds him that while Tony isn’t a super soldier, he’s strong. He’s got great muscle tone from years of both piloting and shaping the armor. Steve gives Tony one more firm pump before leaning over to the side table to grab some lube.
Good.
“Fuuuuuuuck, Steve, yeah, move me around however you want.”
It only takes a few sequences before Tony is spraying the shower wall in front of them, stiffening and clenching hard, bearing down and spasming around Steve inside him.
Tony was telling the truth, this shower hasn’t seen much action. His schedule was hard enough to sync with Peppers, and she was never very keen on sexy showers… maybe
He feels like he’s in a dream. While they were apart he no longer had his haunting sex dreams, but he did think about Tony. A lot. He found excuses to get some privacy multiple times a day.
Time becomes meaningless as he leans forward and takes Tony into his mouth, slowly working his way up and down the length, hands locked on the hammer. He gradually dips into what he’s termed “the floaty feeling” he often gets in these dreams.
Bruce takes another vile of blood from Tony with practiced movements. He then turns to Steve. “I’m really sorry Steve, but I’d also like to get a sample from you.”
be hot. But for now he says, “Stay. Please.”
, and yes, even when you were with Pepper it was there lurking under the surface. So yes, I am not surprised. The way you and Steve fought… everything was always too personal. Too heated to just be animosity. Plus he’s pretty much all you’ve talked about for the last month. Like I know you care about the Accords, but every call has been ‘Steve said this…’ ‘Steve thinks that…’” He nods sagely.
“Whatever it takes, Tony.”
Infinity stones. Thanos. The end of all things (or at least half of them).
comms!”
“So good, Steve. I’m going to use my mouth now. You earned it. And you can come as soon as I Iet go of your cock okay?”
“I promise. So… if I’m not catching that flight, we probably have a little more time in the shower?”
- Tony and Steve go camping
“It’s not the spore, or I don’t think it is. No one else on the team has an irregular blood sample, and it would be strange that only you were affected since you have the most protection. The armor has a filtration system, right?”
Steve hurries on, determined to fix this. “I know, I get it now, I do. You want to give yourself to me on a level that transcends who comes, or when. You aren't just... I get it, and I want that too. So much Tony."
Steve’s eyes shoot open, and he looks a little startled. “Oh, do you… do you want me to leave?”
“If you need to you can hold on to the handrails on the wall in front of you Steve.” There are two handrails above the platform in this setting, usually in showers they are there to prevent slipping, but in this case they are positioned to allow for a person who is fucking or getting fucked to have something to brace themselves on.
- Tony and Rocket have dueling upgrade wars over Thor's arm.
But, I have been drawn over to the Knives Out fandom and am going to be writing for that over the next however long (Chris Evans you sexy minx!). So if that's your thing check it out! If not, I'll return to Steve/Tony likely later this year or in 2021. Thanks for all the comments and support 🙂
(See the end of the chapter for
“No pain there?”
“I want to touch you.” Steve would say, finally fully pressed against Tony’s back from shoulder to knee. It would almost be a question.
Steve’s eyes go wide, “Oh wait Tony, did you just propose in the middle of our kinky roll-playing sex scene?!”
“Nope! Reunification means perks, more specifically billionaire philanthropist perks, which means you can use one of my four, yes four, private planes. They fly themselves and are untraceable. I’ll put the app on your new phone to fly it. It’s easy, even a beautiful relic like you can do it.”
Steve feels judged, even though Bruce’s tone and face are as blank as a still pond.
Instead of answering Steve lunges at his mouth. It feels almost like he’s mimicking Tony’s final efforts, Steve’s tongue franticly trying to reach every bit of Tony’s mouth it can. Digging at him, searching. Tony returns as good as Steve gives him, stroking his tongue over Steve’s sharing the lingering mild taste of the lube and Steve’s essence.
“I’m… really good. Better than good. Is “best” a feeling?” Steve laughs almost in disbelief. “God Tony, I don’t think there was
Tony doesn’t respond, but thinks he may text her again in a week or two. With time it would be nice if they could be friends again; after all, it’s possible there’s a vacancy opening up.
my thing so… anyway, the walls and amenities change depending which code I pick. I’ve custom-coded about thirty options, with more one-off features and settings.”
Tony takes the gel-bead cloth and runs it firmly down between Steve’s cheeks, letting the little gel balls catch on his entrance, bump bump, bump, bump. Steve lets out a loud moan, he almost sounds like he’s in pain. Tony glides it back up, then back down.
He pulls the covers back up to his chin, hiding his chest and calls out to Tony to come in.
Tony and Steve sit back waiting for something else.
Tony is not prepared for this. He has no chance to think of what to say, so he just starts talking…
Tony sucks the side of his cheek into his mouth, the look on his face inscrutable. “Yep, out with the old, in with the new. The tower’s for sale, fresh on the market. Got a sweet little place in the works upstate.”
One day Steve walks into the kitchen and Tony and Pepper are leaning over a Stark pad laughing, and he’s not jealous, he’s really not.
Steve is mortified. And suddenly suspicious.
. She does go offline and there are no recordings… but… she’s an AI Steve, even if she isn’t peeping, she can’t
Tony puts a hand on Peter’s shoulder to settle him down. “Hold on there, underoos, what do you mean Ned owes you $20?”
Steve gathers Tony to him in a loose hug, like he’s afraid he’ll break. He takes a deep breath. “Can I come with you down to the lab?”
Steve notices for the first time a small moving tree next to Thor, and an even smaller racoon. The racoon rests a small hand on Thor's knee as he lets the hammer-axe fall loose in his grip.
“So the platform is mainly for access. At this height, I can easily wash your hair. Stream 2, increase angle 30%”
Steve jolts, letting out a strangled moan.
Bruce spends two months after Thanos in one of Tony’s most isolated properties in the Alps. The Hulk has never just
The police are called when the makeshift motor Tony and Rocket have cobbled together catches fire and explodes.
Tony looks close to laughing, but Steve doesn’t think this is funny. At all.
At the time he didn’t pay much mind to the “I think” Tony tagged on there. But now it catches at his mind. Surely Tony knows how happy he is? He looks down at him, and in this moment desperately needs to let him know.
He speaks, his voice a bit wary, “Not exactly sure how I’m supposed to respond to all that, Cap.”
“Can I kiss you Steve? … Do you want to know how you taste?”
“That’s perfect Tony, that’s just what I want.”
That he wants to be the same kind of support for Steve.
“About six weeks ago when I went to visit Tony, we resolved a lot of the conflicts we had that were keeping the team apart. And we also worked out many of the issues between the two of us. Our personal issues. That is, what I mean is that Tony and I ended up changing the nature of our relationship at that time, and we wanted to tell everyone about it… that our relationship has changed. Improved really…”
"I think you'll find
He's so wrapped up in what Tony is saying it feels like it hits him out of no-where. He just lets go, still fully encased in Tony. Tony babbles through it, egging him on. Finally when he's done, he rests his forehead for a moment in the cradle of Tony’s neck and shoulder.
“Please” he finds himself saying. It comes out as a whisper.
He knows he’s begging already, but he feels like he's going crazy.
It’s a universal “what now?” gesture, and Steve still doesn’t know, but he can’t keep standing around like a mannequin.
Motherfucker. Has this whole lead up been a tease? Is Steve trying to get him to beg? Ask and you shall receive.
As he gets undressed and puts on a swimsuit he thinks about wearing a sleeveless shirts too to cover the scars left behind after the removal of the arc reactor. Anywhere else he would. But it’s Steve… it’s just Steve, and Tony doesn’t feel like hiding… maybe for the first time in a while.
Scott can’t speak. What kind of person is Tony Stark that
about Tony. But, there are so many things that he does... Tony isn’t that grey tom cat. Not really. In a lot of ways he is like some wild force, poised to hurt Steve, the team, himself. Because Tony
if they ever saw each other, but Tony keeps taking business trips away from New York. When he is home he always seems to be working. Eventually he’s on better terms with Pepper, which Steve is happy about.
“Steve! Steve! Steve!”
Steve comes.
Tony immediately rolls his eyes. “A meeting, really? You want to sit around the conference room table and tell everyone you just rode my dick practically hard enough to break it off?”
Steve tunes it out and concentrates on what’s in front of him. Having his hands grounded on the hammer allows him to focus, but it also makes maneuvering the way he wants more difficult. Finding the right angle and the best leverage to take Tony in deeply starts to bring him out of the safe floaty feeling, so he gives up and moves off the shaft with a final suck in favor of slowly gliding his mouth and tongue against whatever’s closest.
Tony strokes his almost jet-black facial hair (how had he missed that the grey was disappearing?). Tony glances at Steve. “So I think, I maaay know part of what might be causing this.”
He almost swipes the screen away and tells Friday to tell Steve he isn't here.
Tony beats him to the shower, but only because by the time Steve has realized they are in a race, he also realizes he doesn’t know where the bathroom is, so he jumps following Tony close behind.
It’s Tony and Steve’s turn to look surprised. “You… know?” says Steve.
Upon hearing "only you," Tony presses on Steve’s prostate with conviction. In response Steve’s channel spasms tightly around his fingers. Tony quickly grabs the base of Steve’s cock with his other hand. Steve is on a hair-trigger now. Tony tightens his grip to create a make-shift cock-ring with his fist to prevent him from coming without warning.
Set post Chapter 110: Time away from the world, from “1796 Broadway.”
in his penthouse in his too-tight t-shirt like some sort of wet dream.
He’s not wrong.
Steve kisses Tony to stop his rambling. He’s been dying to kiss him since they started. Playing doctor has been great, but doctors don’t kiss their patients. He’s missed it.
Tony squeezes Steve’s hands, hoping this is getting through.
By and large the group pays no attention, occasionally poking gentle fun at them. Steve brings up “Interpersonal Relationships” as part of the agenda at the next Avengers team meeting. Nobody has much to say after he assures everyone that he and Tony have talked about it, and that their relationship will stay separate from Avengers business.
There isn’t a lot of room in the workshop bathroom. Unlike the other bathrooms in the compound, it’s purely functional. A toilet, a sink, and a (comparatively) small walk-in shower. It’s meant to get the job done when Tony is on an all-night science bender so intense, he can’t even bother to go upstairs. It’s hardly been used, since every night he heads up to bed at a semi-reasonable hour to be with Steve.
“He’s coming up to the Avengers side-entrance Boss.”
“What are you doing?” Steve asks.
“Let’s get you back up on the table Mr. Stark” he says, and Tony takes his cue and climbs back up. As he does he feels some of Steve’s come slide out of him. Steve notices too and helps Tony onto his back, lifting his legs so they are bent and his ass is angled a bit to prevent more from dripping out.
Steve’s tongue feels like it’s glued to the roof of his mouth. He just shakes his head about the drink and takes a single step into the room.
He stands in front of Tony and slides both palms up the center of his chest. He doesn’t press, just holding them there over Tony’s heart. Steve leans down, laying light kisses along Tony’s beard and jaw. Down to his neck, along his clavicle. He pauses sliding his hands to look more closely at Tony’s chest, running his fingers over the jagged lines of scar tissue, like he’s memorizing it. Tony thinks about saying something about the scarring, but what is there to say? He knows Steve knows what the scars are from. He wonders if they are off-putting to him, but the way Steve is slowly caressing them, then kissing them, Tony already has his answer.
Vain as it is, Tony spends almost the entire hour it takes Steve to get from La Guardia to the tower primping and trying on clothes like a 14-year-old getting ready for their first date. Well, if a fourteen-year-old also ranted and raved, liberally firing off expletives to their AI.
“You’re not Steve, you’re making me feel so good, I’m close.”
I've added a chapter, because apparently I can't stop...  >_>
LASS-E makes a small yip of delight and puts one paw up on her bent knee, before tilting up to give three persistent licks to Natasha’s face.
He lets his head drop next to Tony’s on the pillow and just lays there, spent.
Steve administers another “dose,” and eventually they drag themselves back upstairs.
beings.
Honesty. Well doesn’t that just sound so simple?
level of asshole that would require some sort of sexual favor in return for what I’m trying to do to bring the team back together…”
There are no traditional lights, but much like the side-entrance to Avengers Tower, there are faint lines of airplane-like emergency lighting on each step indicating where they start and end. In less than a minute Steve gets to the bottom, and he can hear the groan of some type of machinery pulling the stairs at the top back into place.
Thanks to everyone who is taking the time to read. I'm excited to post Peter, Thor and Bruce! I may also do a bonus chapter about the public finding out.
Steve blushes and gets slightly defensive. “No Tony, I obviously wouldn’t phrase it like that, but this affects the team so I think we should address it as a team… also what do you you mean break it?? You said you were okay, is your-“
Seriously though, if you haven’t read 1796 Broadway, go! And ‘choose your own adventure’ over this way at chapter 110 if you want!
“Hey Rocket, hey Thor, wow that arm looks really realistic!" Steve moves over to Tony and smiles at  him, touching his elbow. I"just wanted to come see when you’d be ready for dinner. I’m going to call to make a reservation at that new Japanese place in the city.”
Steve is maneuvering him now, pressing forward to slide one hand to the plane where his back meets his ass, the other going up to the center of his back between his shoulder blades. Steve takes a deep breath, and lifts Tony, shifting up fully on to his knees.
Tony and Steve have a misunderstanding.
They’re both asleep in seconds. Steve doesn’t dream.
in his mid-forties. He’d made his peace with getting older a few years ago, he’s happy where he is… but the image of him now, as he
Steve shakes his head and scoops Tony up and takes him to bed. Things are still so up in the air, with everything… but Steve has to admit to himself that there is no one like Tony. As he’s tucking him in Tony mumbles “Good girl” a few times, but is obviously deeply asleep. Steve sits on the edge of the bed for a while, just looking.
Thor comes back from Asgard and seems delighted by her, before quickly moving on to being delighted by Clint’s ancient Game Boy, and then moving on to delighting in Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.
Steve nods. Whatever Bruce says, he will take to heart. Bruce is this calming force (which Steve supposes is ironic). He trusts him.
“And if we can’t get them? What are our chances with just the group we have now?” asks Steve.
Steve moves to interrupt Tony with a warm, soft kiss. “I know, I know. I just mean, I didn’t understand when you said it didn’t matter that you aren’t hard. I thought you meant that it was okay that we were having sex even though you
Rocket bristles, his fur puffing out slightly. “First of all, everyone knows Shuri did all the work on the infinity gauntlet-“
“What are you doing here, Captain?”
Steve reaches behind himself to guide Tony in. Fuck, he’s already tight. He flushes realizing the serum probably means he can’t really wait too long after prepping himself. Lesson learned for next time, he’s loose enough, and there’s plenty of lube. He lowers himself quickly over the head and down a few inches, knowing with every second he waits he’s just tightening back up.
The Accords II are passed and everything moves really quickly after that. Once pardoned, Scott stops by the compound long enough to do a meet and greet with the newly reunited team, and get a tour of the place. Then he flies back to California to see Cassie and talk to her mother about The Plan. He doesn’t actually
Oh fuck, this was probably a terrible idea. He checks his reflection in the small outgoing screen in the corner similar to a webcam. He’s flushed. Fuck, what was he thinking? Pepper knows what he looks like when he’s aroused! But she said it was urgent…
Steve slowly turns over and takes in Tony’s strained expression and shaking hands. He does his best to calm his voice. “Tony. Tony, it’s okay. I’m fine… my feet feel fine; they’re already healing.” He lifts up his foot again from where Tony dropped it and Tony slowly examines it. It’s already half as pink as it was before, and getting lighter by the second.
He’s so tired.
Tony rolls his eyes and Steve can just hear him mumble something that sounds like “Pepper didn’t know…”
Wong and Dr. Strange step forward. “Who do you need, we can use our sling rings to go get them.”
Steve nods even though Tony can’t see him. “Good, as I said, it’s completely normal to become aroused and even ejaculate. It’s against ethical codes for me to touch your genitals, but if you need to you can touch yourself after a certain point during the procedure. I can let you know when that’s allowed.”
he’s in distress. Fuck yes.
“Shh, you’re doing so well Steve, answer and you’ll get a second finger.”
“And when I woke up it felt like people never even knew, never learned. Sure, it’s there in the history books. I think people cover it for about a week in grade school now… but they don’t see… they weren’t
“Ah-ah, what did I say I wanted Steve?” his voice is warm, but firm.
But no, Steve doesn’t regret saying it. It’s the truth. He looks right back at him, he's not afraid.
He thinks this must be what a junkie feels like, desperate for the next fix.
They're still in the shower.
“I get it, Steve. I think you’re right that the first step is getting everyone back together. Hell, convincing them they can trust me and that you and I really have resolved things. That's the priority.”
“Yes, Tony, yes” Steve gets out. He feels like he’s floating. He’s finally here. He’s with Tony and Tony is going to take care of him.
There is a small sink and counter station that holds things like bandages, cotton swabs, gloves, pain medication and hand sanitizer. Not only are they realistic props for Dr. Steve to use, they’re ready in case of an actual emergency. The cabinet under the sink has two actual emergency first aid kits.
The team (minus Scott) sits down to a meal.
“Up to the penthouse, Fri. Give me at least 90 seconds.”
Tony can’t even track what Steve is talking about, but he knows he doesn’t want Steve to leave him like this. He is so vulnerable, exposed ass up in his medical gown. Tony has had a lot of sex, and done a good amount of role playing, but this is more intense than he imagined. Maybe another time getting left in here and not knowing when Steve would be back
He takes Tony’s legs and hauls them up to rest on his chest and over his shoulders, aligning his cock with Tony’s entrance. He presses slightly and is surprised when the head pops right in through the first ring of muscle. Oh god.
Steve, Tony and Dr. Strange are almost a match for the two dour-looking aliens (Falcon is doing damage control with civilians).
Note – I have a soft spot for Avengers Tower, so in this version of things I have delayed the change over to the new Avengers facility/compound. Let’s hand-wave and agree that at the time of the accords/civil war, the transition to the upstate facility hadn’t happened yet (and thus the tower is Steve’s first option looking for Tony).
Steve smiles at him softly, and shit, if he keeps making eyes at him like that, they won’t even have to tell the team anything. Tony glances at everyone else and the feeling in his chest expands. Sam looks content, Nat looks approving, almost proud. Wanda looks touched and she’s the first to raise her glass in return. Vision looks, well, blank. But he always has the same sort of non-expression. Tony should spend more time with him, learn his reactions better.
“Look, I think this is on me. I knew we needed to have a bigger conversation about what we were doing. I knew that maybe you weren’t 100% ready to jump into this with both feet. I was just so excited Steve… you’re… god you’re everything I thought I’d never have. I’m sorry if I pushed you to do something you didn’t want or didn’t understand.”
Scott settles in and decides to begin his security assessment of the compound the very next day.
Steve had vague plans of prostrating himself before Tony, doing or saying something so sincere that Tony wouldn’t have time to get his hackles up. Something to make him understand that Steve really, truly wants to fix things. But now he’s here, and all he’s said amounts to “yeah let me in, cause I wanna talk to him.”
“Fuck, I love everything about you.”
Tony doesn’t see what Steve’s plan is until he draws himself out and slowly lowers Tony back down over himself, holding Tony’s entire weight in his arms. Oh.
Tony lets go of Steve’s hair and massages the area for several seconds. “I’m so sorry Steve, I should have been more clear with you. I
He lifts Tony up and down again, slightly faster, like the sight of Tony erect has loosened his iron control just a bit.
He takes Steve’s face in his hands and presses their lips together, short and sweet. “Thank you Steve, you’re doing so well.”
Steve pauses, thinking for a moment if anything they’ve done has made him uncomfortable. “Actually, it’s kind of the opposite? Being on the other side of things, being “Dr. Steve" feels, it feels like I’m taking something back... Does that make sense?”
only to find them all crowded around LASS-E, ignoring their fallen team member.
After two months, he thinks he understands why Hulk won’t come out, but he’s no closer to actually getting him to emerge. Bruce decides to go back to the New York compound and continue his research there. He might as well be with the team, and if Hulk does decide to show, he’s sure Tony and the rest will help him manage.
Tony smiles up at him from the mattress, loose and happy. “If anyone asks, I’ll tell them Captain America did his due diligence.”
As the hole in the conversation made by Tony drags on, whatever was holding Steve back suddenly disappears and he’s talking again without really planning or thinking at all. All he knows is that he has to say something to get that blank look off of Tony’s face. “When I heard about the accident,” he begins, voice dropping low, “I had to come. And it wasn’t because I’m the leader of the Avengers, or because I thought you might cause an international incident… I had to come because you were hurt, and you were far away, and I needed to see you. I can’t keep ignoring this thing we’ve been doing. I can’t ignore that you are someone… I… someone I…”
“Uhg, uh, just… just a fingertip, not all the way… just spit… just wanted to feel…”
“I… more-than-love-you, too” he says, his mouth pulled into a funny little smile.
“Okay
Once he’s truly deep-throating Tony, he feels a tap on his shoulder and he pulls off, giving Tony his full attention.
Steve swallows and realizes maybe he hasn’t exactly said everything he needed to say yet.
All his worry about telling people is slipping away. It felt so great to kiss Tony in front of Rhodey, or just, have him know they’re together. Steve is bursting with joy, with relief. He wants to chase that feeling.
And nobody has done this to Tony in twenty years which means… well Steve isn’t sure exactly what that means, but he can tell it’s something special.
“Next I’m going to probe the procedure-area with my fingers. It will be very similar to a prostate exam. I see from your chart you’ve done those before.”
And he’s come out the other side… still pissed. He gets that Bucky was brainwashed. That was probably the easiest thing to move on from. He gets that Steve didn’t want evil government overlords babysitting them. With the benefit of time and hindsight, Tony understands Steve’s side as much as he can, but there’s one thing he can’t get over.
, and things Steve doesn’t recognize but can guess at what they are used for...
“Pepper?”
When Steve begins again, his voice is playful. “And I don’t know, maybe I can do something to make it up to you, like, hmm… do your laundry? Wash your car?”
Tony shivers and considers the question. “That’s a difficult question Steve, because I want everything, all the time, all at once. I think we’ll have the opportunity to explore a lot of different things together, so what we do tonight isn’t something I need to make the call on.”
The please catches Tony’s attention. It’s already edging on a desperate, begging tone. Hmm, he may take pity on Steve and move things along… in a little while…
“You may all remember the friendly neighborhood Spiderman that joined us in Germany?”
“Please, please, please Tony I’m begging you! If you don’t let me suck you and come on your leg I’m going to drip, I know it. I’m so close. Please even one more slap and I’ll come untouched, it's too good, please I don’t want to ruin the rug, please please
He can’t… how has Tony done this? Just… changed his life as casually as suggesting what to eat for lunch...
As of now he doesn't have much of an appetite.
Tony moans as Steve swallows him down. He barely has the presence of mind to narrate all the kinky doctor fun he wants to have with Steve, but after holding back for so long it bursts out of him like a torrent.
“Studies have shown that manual stimulation of the area after the procedure can increase the treatment’s effectiveness.” Steve says, continuing to press two fingers inside, rubbing at his cum, pressing it against the Tony’s smooth channel, working to press it deeper.
Tony slides two fingers through the soap down into the  space between Steve’s ass cheeks. Stroking slowly up and down several times, just barely grazing his hole on the upstroke. Steve shifts on his feet and squats subtly, just the slightest bend of his knees, pushing his ass out an inch or so closer toward Tony.
Namely, that letting Friday
Tony can only nod as he thinks wildly that Steve actually would make an amazing doctor. He feels so safe and comfortable.
“So what’s the news?”
“You can dial the gore up or down the same way I showed you how to adjust the color.” says Tony.
Tony nods, pulling Steve in for another kiss, running his tongue against Steve's. Eventually he eases back and rests his forehead against Steves. “You’re really good at this by the way.” he says, motioning to the exam room. “I didn’t know what to expect.”
Luckily he has substantially less expensive and valuable loungewear available for Steve to rub himself off on right here.
Steve snorts. “I’m not sure that’s as comforting as you think it is.”
. Steve thinks.
“So we need to isolate the bug by Friday or half the company won’t get paid for-“
Ned >> No way! For real?!
wild and beautiful and so amazing in so many ways that Steve doesn’t even fully understand… he’s wild but that’s not
It's exactly what Steve needs to hear. At the end of the day he's just one person. He's barely thirty. The literal fate of the world shouldn't rest on his shoulders. Once he may have thought it did, but he sees there is a better path forward.
Tony swallows, reminding himself to get into character (even though all he wants to do at this point is gush to Steve about how amazing he looks in glasses).
Peppers eyes widen at that. “Tony, I’m not saying this to hurt you… but I just can’t see how this isn’t going to completely blow up in your face.”
Steve smiles at Thor and Rocket. He has a soft spot for Rocket in particular, something about relating to him as “the little guy.”
He never stopped loving the sensation of being fucked, but after he was outed by that shitty tabloid Obie "helpfully" suggested he should stick to dating women for a while “just until the dust clears” and then… then he scratched that itch with toys and few custom inventions.
Tony is breathing hard and can’t look at Steve anymore. Fuck he really thought he was over most of this shit.
She also texts that it’s good to hear from him.
Steve shakes his head in disgust, "He killed his own daughter..."
“Do we need any protection?” Steve asks, and guh that’s, that’s actually a really wholesome and responsible question. Steve really isn’t the sweet boy scout cliché the public thinks he is, except sometimes he
This part is set post Chapter 119: Black Out All of Manhattan.
to be free, but there’s only so much making out a 40-something billionaire can do without feeling a little ridiculous).
Tony tries to stay in character. He really does. But Steve is breaking his brain. “Fuck Steve, posterior… stirrups… fuck please…”
Steve feels hot all over, and so pleased and happy that for a moment he forgets he’s in utter turmoil. He thought Tony liked him, of course, they’re friends… he just had no idea the level of… He
Steve laughs, leaning forward and pressing his forehead into LASS-E’s skull, before saying
“It’s just that you haven’t completed any projects in the lab for weeks…” says Bruce.
Steve takes Tony in his lubed palm and strokes a few times, spreading the rest of it around. Not having a towel and not wanting to ruin the comforter, he wipes the remainder off on his own stomach. Maybe it’s a hold-over from having to hide his late-night emissions while on the run, but Steve hates the idea of making a mess on Tony’s fancy bedding.
The Avengers branch of the SI PR team do what they do, releasing a statement approved by Steve and Tony. The two of them do a couple of joint interviews with The Advocate and with one of Steve’s favorite independent bloggers (run by a gay metal of honor recipient who mainly blogs about fixing up old bikes).
It seems to take his mind off of Gamora, if only for a moment.
“Steve, Steven. My turtledove. Please don’t ever apologize for
Bruce sighs. “I guess not.” He motions to his un-transformed body. “I - I’ll be on the comms if you need any research… sentient plant, maybe I can find something if it’s similar to any known flora?”
He misses Thor and the Guardians leaving by a week. He would never tell Thor, but he’s relieved the compound is fairly calm as a result of their absence. Tony gives him the run-down of how the team is functioning and offers him some lab space of his own down in his workshop.
Fuck. Steve is Steve again. Steve Steve. And Tony just told him he wants to marry him. Tony wracks his brain to see if there is a way to play this off as part of their roleplay. He wants to marry Steve, yes. In fact, he’s already made him his ring. But he definitely hadn’t planned on asking him until they’d been together longer. A year from the reunification had been his vague plan. A trip somewhere. Make it special…
Steve can feel his skin getting hot. “I feel… really good about all of that Tony. I… before last night I thought I really wanted you to take control, tell me what to do, um, dominate me? But, I think, I also like the other way, where you do what I want. They both felt right.” He shrugs, he can’t really explain it better than that.
Steve nods, determined. Tony can only describe his facial expression as his “Captain America face.” He abruptly stands, taking Tony with him. Hands cupped under his ass. Just picking him up like he’s a sack of potatoes. No, more like a sack of feathers, fuck. He moves Tony away from the bench and over to the raised platform where he pauses. He kisses Tony deeply, then slowly lowers him to the platform like he’s made of glass.
“I just… need to talk to him. Is he here?”
“I’m sorry I let you take on all the weight of what we’ve done tonight all on your shoulders. I’m not as experienced as you, and I just lost myself to the overwhelming feeling of it all. I didn’t – I was so focused on trying to give myself to you that I wasn’t letting you do the same.”
“Tilt your head back a bit, that’s it. Auto-sense rinse and spray, avoid face.”
Steve is also on edge, but Tony is in high spirits. He braced himself to hear that he has some rare aggressive form of cancer, or that he would be medically benched from being Iron Man. This comparatively seems like good news. Plus he gets to embarrass the absolute hell out of Steve by talking about their sex life (a topic which he has been banned from addressing in conversation by almost everyone in the compound).
“Friday, locate Steve, and get me an answer on why nobody is on the
Bruce never thought he’d be
Once Steve calms down, Tony starts again: “This, the you and me thing… it may be complicated. I don’t want anyone on the team to doubt our ability to work together, or to feel like there are any conflicts of interest. And… I don’t know how you feel about everyone knowing. About us.”
No one is surprised that after Tony, Steve is her favorite.
“Sorry boss, looks like the Whirlwind’s gusts are disrupting the electromagnetic signals.”
LASS-E quickly becomes a fixture around the tower. Tony is still consistently amazed at his own awesomeness when she instinctively follows Bruce around for a week after he has what everyone can only assume was a not-so-great call from a former associate named Betty.
Tony and Steve head back to the suite, hand in hand.
“Can’t wait to see you come. Wish you were in me, giving me what I need. Uh, taking care of me, coming in me so hard and so hot. Giving me my medicine…”
Steve moves back over to position himself where he thinks he needs to be over Tony’s hard cock. They’ve done this once before, Steve bottoming from above. It was a hurried frenzy out in the living area on the sofa. Tony prepped him and guided him down over himself then; the logistics seem a little different with Tony flat on the bed and Steve fully in control.
Steve’s own cock is trapped between them, getting little random brushes of friction. He attaches his mouth to Tony’s and continues to slide, slick and fast over his length.
We are in the home-stretch! Thanks so much for all the feedback and support ☺️
Tony wants to keep ahold of his hand on their way to the kitchen. God he is gone for Steve. Who holds hands walking around in their own house? He smiles a little with the knowledge that soon they can if they want. He feels like he’s a kid again with his first crush.
Steve’s blush deepens and spreads as he finds himself prone on his stomach on the sand, wearing only what is essentially an undergarment (why are Tony’s swim trunks more like shorts?!), while Tony kneels on his knees behind him holding Steve’s left foot up to inspect it.
When asked in interviews and official hearings about it, he says the same sound bite over and over:
He uses what Tony has dubbed his “Captain Voice,” they don’t have much time and that’s always guaranteed to set Tony off. “We have about five minutes to get going before we can’t make the curtain. So here’s what we’re going to do,” Tony his opening his own pants, nodding in agreement and anticipation.
Steve’s expression slides into a hesitant, beautiful smile in response to Tony’s gentle tenor and use of “Cap.”
Each individual piece I write will have the explanation above, and a summary of what entry from “1796 Broadway” it is based on in the Notes section. I highly recommend you read “1796 Broadway,” even if epistolary isn’t something you usually go for (and also it will make what I write make much more sense, haha)!
Steve stands to join him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. “I don’t want to sleep away from you. Or have to think about if I’m sitting next to you too often at meals. I want to hold your hand when we watch TV. I want everyone to know what you mean to me…”
Pepper continues, “As you know I’ve been easing up on my duties as SI CEO for a while. In fact Erin and Jamal are now handling the day-to-day for all our major divisions. And well, when I turned thirty I had some eggs frozen. I wasn’t dating anyone at the time, I was working 90-hour weeks as an assistant for a crazy person…” here she winks at Tony, “and I just figured it would be a while before kids would be something I’d get to.”
Tony is pretty sure Steve would rather eat his own shield than tell Helen Cho about their sex life.
Steve nods, his face falling.
Right, so no distractions then.
He’s even doing those damn meditative breathing exercises that Bruce tried to get him to do every day for a week. Thank god Bruce is doing yoga or whatever with Natasha now, for a while there Tony thought he’d have to actually go through with daily meditation just to keep his lab partner.
What will Steve choose haha... Thanks for reading everyone, this has a mind of its own I swear, things ramp up next chapter as I'm sure you've guessed from that cliffhanger.
Steve blushes, but doesn’t seem self-conscious, too caught up in the pleasure.
To Tony it sounds like a petulant
But she
And he’s
What is Tony… He has to make this clear, he has to say the right thing, even if he has no idea what that is. Steve wishes he had time to think; he wishes he could go up to his room and have time to write his thoughts in a letter. “No, wait, I don’t think I was clear. Tony, I don’t feel weird. I’m – I’m just trying to ask you how you feel about me.”
And he still isn’t sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. He doesn’t feel any more sure than he did before coming to Hawaii. In fact he’s even more confused, because right now Tony doesn’t feel like the biggest mistake he could make, or the best thing he could ask for.
Oh yeah, he’s holding it.
is to be with someone who is batshit crazy, like you. And that’s Steve.”
“Head’s up, he’s at the elevator.”
She’s been incredible. She actually understands the whole “man out of time” thing, but doesn’t focus on it. She also understood when he said that they should take things slow. That he wasn’t… well he basically confessed to only ever having kissed one girl before, and that it wasn’t much. He really has no idea how to be in a relationship, and she’s made him feel like that’s okay.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I only saw one camp, in ‘45. We were in the right place at the right time to help with the liberation.  Most of what the Commandos and I did was focused on Hydra. And those bases were bad. Human experiments, weapons. But the camp, Tony...
Thor is excited to honor Tony and Steve's love... By crashing their date.
DUM-E is jealous.
He turns to Steve, who is white as a sheet. “Hey, why the face? We don’t know anything yet, it’ll be fine.”
