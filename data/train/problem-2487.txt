“For that consulting detective of yours, of course! She was such a great help in our case. She gets a plus one, too!”
“Off your money and your fame,” she repeated, as if it weren’t clear enough. “But I know I have no right to ask you…”
He knew it sounded cheesy, but also that she was smart enough to tell it was true.
That June, she was invited to Victoria’s house in the countryside; Sherlock tried really hard to suppress the fear, and the anxiety, because she knew that she’d been lucky enough to be liked by Victoria: pleasing her parents would have been asking for too much.
“So,” she began, “who is going to be your plus one?” Which was a perfectly harmless question, really, after all, she’d listened to Lestrade from the kitchen, where she wasn’t even hiding, just enjoying her cup of tea in plain sight.
“They know.” Joanna scooped closer. “Your family?” she enquired. “There will be no coming back. They can’t ignore it this time.” Sherlock doubted that.
Joanna was on the sofa, on her side, to avoid the unpleasant rubbing of the fabric against the stitched side of her head. The wound was small and she’d covered it with hair easily. Sherlock wanted to sit next to her, but she didn’t quite dare. She was feeling better, Sherlock could tell, and she even made her some tea, without milk because she’d forgotten to buy it – as punishment for that, maybe.
“I hope it’s not weird, since you’re so close to my sister,” Mycroft interrupted his train of thought.
The lawyer nodded.
“Baker Street, then?” Agamemnon asked him, and God only knows how he knew. Lestrade nodded.
“Oh, not at all, it’s just… just strange that you two are in fact sisters, if you get what I mean.”
“But they still think that it’s not a good idea given my public figure, haven’t I thought of my sister’s career, and that… they don’t want to judge, but they can’t agree fully, either,” she listed, staring out of the window. He hadn’t expected her to discuss it, especially not with him in the backseat; but he guessed it made sense, since she was trying to minimize. It reminded Lestrade of his own divorce, of the times he’d told Sophie about all the things that bothered him, just as quickly, staring out of other windows, while claiming that they weren’t bothering him at all.
“Half past,” Lestrade replied.
“Was the money hidden in the crawlspace?” Joanna asked the two of them.
The door, as Lestrade had gathered, had been still locked from the inside when the firefighters had finally managed to access the building from the bathroom window. Then they’d found the woman’s body on the living room floor, by the Christmas tree, her airways blocked and her windpipe shattered by the white charger of an ancient looking iPhone that some relative must have gifted her.
“Exactly,” she replied. “I’m sorry. It’s not fair to you.”
“That’s insane,” Lestrade agreed.
“Don’t you? They seem important,” she said. She accepted the change of subject without complaining. She sounded passionate about it, even.
“I’m sure your sister won’t let them say that. She’s a tough lady, isn’t she,” he tried to say.
“She has a slight concussion,” she replied. “They kept her the first night, but now she’s home.”
Robert didn’t say anything for a bit, then from his voice alone Lestrade could see him light up, from his home, maybe, or his office at the dealership.
“For what?” Joanna said. Sherlock knew that she knew – she figured that she wanted to hear her say it out loud.
“That sounds terrible,” Lestrade said, because it did.
“That’s so generous,” he ended up stammering, after a long and painful attempt at declining, because it didn’t sound too professional, and he had nothing appropriate to wear, after losing his wardrobe to the divorce. “Tell your employer that he didn’t have to,” he tried one last time.
“Oh. I don’t have any ex husbands,” Mycroft offered, and Lestrade felt relieved that he did not have to ask, “just serious relationships, here and there, no matter what Sherlock says about it.”
She ordered a croissant and ate it with more grace than Lestrade had ever seen, covering her mouth with her hand as she chewed, which was making him a bit self conscious. They spoke of their families and about France, and Lestrade discovered that the Holmeses went to France every year, on holiday, and that a grandma had been French, as well – that both Mycroft and Sherlock were fluent in French. Mycroft looked interested in the life story of Lestrade’s father, and it made him realize that he liked to tell it.
“Lestrade!” Sherlock shouted, and, thanks to his good old days of playing football, the Detective Inspector was able to lean forward, and somehow, with his arms, catch the small of Joanna’s back, while the top of her head hit a nearby radiator with a thud, skull against yellow paint, peeling and stained black.
“You can ask your sister, you know, it’s fine, it’s…”
Sherlock texted him as soon as he got onto the car.
“Well, that’s too bad, because I fell in love with you, and certainly not with Mycr…”
He nodded.
“Maybe he was close to his father,” Lestrade realized.
”Already have.” Sherlock said in an ”Obviously” voice, which made John quirk an eyebrow up at him.
”I’m glad,” John said, voice low. He was feeling content, and very tired. He could easily sleep here, in Sherlock’s lap, and he would if he didn't know how uncomfortable Sherlock would be.
So John granted his wish. He went a bit faster, but not too fast. He was still making sure Sherlock would have a pleasurable orgasm. They went on for another minute before Sherlock was laying his head back and whimpering as the orgasm took over his body.  John watched, fondly, until Sherlock was spent. Then he leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s loose lips, getting a weak response.
It took John a while to get his breathing back under control, and when he did Sherlock pulled out. Soon John could feel the hot sticky liquid run down his thigh but didn't move.
He saw John’s lips move into a tired, but genuine smile. He didn’t have the strength to respond, or even open his eyes, but Sherlock look the smile as a yes.
”Let them take him.” Lestade said softly in concern as the ambulance personal approached with the bunk. John nodded and kissed Sherlock’s cold hand before he rose on shaking legs, Lestrade’s arm around his back helping a lot. He knew the doctors could save his friend. The men checked Sherlock’s pulse, before looking at each other. One of them shook their head. Then, realisation hit John like a ton of bricks. When they heaved Sherlock’s body into the bag and zipped it shut, he crumbled. If it wasn't for Lestrade he would've fallen to the ground.
”Hey,” John exclaimed, looking at Sherlock. ”I was reading that.”
”Fuck me, Sherlock! Now!”
”John please.”
But, Sherlock was here to tease. He went slowly, pulling out a few times and leaving John empty and pleading.
Sherlock’s heart began to pick up a pace now. John had been called back, that was the only solution. Unless John’s previous commander mailed him about his birthday that was in three months, that was the only solution. His gaze fell to the table, his brilliant mind not knowing how to react to this. What was that feeling he was feeling? Guilt? No. Fear? Of course. Shock? Obviously.
John hummed, breathless as Sherlock started to scissor his fingers, stretching him out even more.
”Hey.” He tried forged Sherlock to look at him with the hand on his cheek. He gave a soft, strained smile. ”I will be fine.” Sherlock swallowed hard, before leaning down to press his head in between John’s shoulder and neck. John laid an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, and they sat like that for a while. John could feel Sherlock’s breaths by the way his chest rose and fell against his own, and tried to match it. Soon John nudged him, and he sat up slowly. Meeting his gaze John gave him an encouraging smile, and Sherlock felt a bit better. Still, his stomach hurt. He rose from Johns lap to run to the bathroom. Concerned, John followed him just in time to see him vomit into the toilet. Shock. He kneeled beside and lay a hand on his back. Rubbing it soothingly he pushed Sherlock’s locks from his face as he spits and heaved until he was done. When he sat back up, his cheeks were wet with tears again. ”This was not what was gonna happen.” He said in a low voice, eyes cast down.
John loved hearing his name on Sherlock’s lips. It sounded amazing.
”Yes, yes!” He moaned into the couch. The sound of flesh hitting flesh could be heard from anyone down the stairs, along with some harsh breathing. Then Sherlock just stopped, and John almost started to cry.
”I need to…say..something.” Sherlock breathed heavily and looked at John as the shock was starting to wear off, making the pain come back. John stared back, starting to feel a sudden light-headedness from lack of oxygen. He suddenly forgot how to breathe.
”Mycroft..”
”No..no,no..” He whispered to himself and leaned over Sherlock, stroking his curls.
”You cock.” John breathed. ”You utter..utter cock.”
”Now I believe it’s time for you to undress too.”
John just stared as Sherlock’s eyes suddenly went unfocused, and his clenched jaw relaxed. He heard the grounding sound of Sherlock’s hand hitting the ground, as if slow motion, and the hand he held went limp. Sherlock’s head tilted to the side as a final breath escaped his mouth. John shook his head, tears now streaming down his face.
”But now that I’m dying…” John chuckled weakly, chest not even moving.
John quietly rose from the chair and went to his room. Sherlock heard the footsteps on the stairs grew quieter until he heard John’s bedroom door close. How could he show John he cared? How could he show John that despite everything bad he always did, he was good? He had feelings, even if he had a hard time showing them. While biting his lip Sherlock rose from the chair, abandoning his experiment on the table. He needed to show John he cared, and that he was upset. The way his heartbeat sped up must mean something. And the way he felt like it was hard to breathe.
”Is this okay?” He asked, even if they had already been through this. The last time this happened John had taken Sherlock’s virginity, and it was a big deal for them both. Or at least his hand job virginity. They hadn't even discussed penetrative sex yet. John knew they both thought about it, but no one felt the need to bring it up, and that felt more than okay.
”John?” Sherlock said while walking into the living room, a biscuit in hand. His robe was dragging on the ground behind him from where it hangs loosely down, exposing his shoulders.
Sherlock nodded and sat down on the chair in the corner, it seems like the polite thing to do. He could be polite, especially if it was about John. He saw John move to take the cup and sit on the bed, legs crossed, facing Sherlock. His fingers played with the handle, eyes glued on the liquid.
”It’s alright.” He said, both to Sherlock and himself. ”I’ve been through this before…” Flashbacks of guns and explosions surprised him, and he squeezed his eyes shut. ”I can survive it again.” He added with a shudder which Sherlock felt. He let out a broken sob and rose a hand to John’s neck, feeling his hair. ”No..” He whimpered. ”You can’t leave now. You are not supposed to leave now. You just got your life back.”
”I was afraid to lose you. You are the first person, besides my parents, to really care for me. Yes I know Mycroft might…care a bit but from outside the family…it’s you John. It’s always been you. Only you. You saw something in me worth staying for, and that’s…” He couldn’t find the right word. ”not something that happens.”
”Five fifty. They pick me up to go to the airport.”
Sherlock huffed and went to sit next to where John was laying on the couch, a cup in his hand. He was wearing John’s grey sweater, and it hung on his thin frame. It almost seemed to swallow him up, and Sherlock had to admit, it was warm and comfy. He sat up from his laying position on the couch and turned to Sherlock with a fond smile. Sherlock stared ahead at the TV, but John could see a small, shy smirk. When he lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, John realized how Sherlock must feel when he was leaning on him, like he sometimes did. It was often out of boredom, or that was what Sherlock told him. John suspected that he had managed to unlock Sherlock’s heart. The soft material felt comforting against his cheek, and he turned his face down into it, feeling Sherlock’s cologne on it. His curls tickled John’s forehead. He loved it.
”How was that?” John couldn't help but ask in a quiet tone, not wanting to disturb their comfortable, romantic atmosphere. Sherlock smiled wider, teeth showing, before letting his hand glide from John’s neck down his chest.
Suddenly the newspaper was snatched from John’s hands and thrown to the floor.
”Mhm..”
”John, stay with me. Stay with me for eight more minutes.”
He felt Sherlock grip his hips and push in, and then he couldn’t keep it in anymore. He let out a deep moan as the tip of Sherlock’s cock slid inside of him.
”What is the point of these shows? No one watches them! They're just taking advantage of stupid people to earn it.” Sherlock exclaimed with a raised hand, and John smiled into the sweater.
”Are you okay?” Sherlock suddenly asked, breaking the silence. It was a stupid question, he knew that, but he needed to break the silence.
As a third finger was in John started to grind against the couch, desperately wanting some contact. Sherlock immediately put a firm hand on his lower back, holding him still. John wanted to groan and cry so desperately but bit his lip. He would not give in yet. Soon a fourth finger was in, and Sherlock was teasing him so much John wanted to just push back into his fingers and fuck himself. Although Sherlock had other plans. John heard him rise from the couch, before sitting back down. Now his cock was pressed up against John's ass, the head of it already by John’s entrance.
”Can I come in?” Sherlock asked. He knew he needed to ask, especially when John was upset. John had told him that, and he tried to remember, for John’s sake.
”Yes,” Sherlock said in a dark voice, watching John almost fondly. If John didn't know better, he would think Sherlock was becoming soft. Maybe he was.
John watched him, the lump in his throat growing tighter and more painful. Sherlock looked at John, eyes filled to the brim with tears. He looked, for once, utterly lost at what to do.
”Stay with me Sherlock.” He pleaded and gently slapped his cheek. Sherlock’s eyes opened quickly, looked around in confusion for a bit, before settling on John. They were a bit unfocused, almost as if in a dream state. John felt a stab of pain in his heart at the pain clear in the blue eyes he loved so much. ”The ambulance is on the way.” He said, trying to convince himself Sherlock could pull through. Sure a shot to the stomach was very life threatening, but Sherlock could survive it right? He always survived. He jumped off a building and survived. He was indestructible, even if John never knew how he did it. He was indestructible.
He swallowed hard, making a tear drip down his cheek, and rose his hands to lay them around John’s shoulders. The moment his arms closed around the smaller man, he collapsed against him. Sherlock tightened his grip, loving the feeling of the small bundle of warmth he now held against him. He could feel John’s shoulders shake under his hands, and moved his thumbs up and down. Leaning down he pressed his nose to John’s hair as if the smell would make everything okay. Nothing could make this okay. But at that moment, when Sherlock held John against him, he felt okay. He felt like everything could be alright if they could just stay like this forever. But reality would catch up with them sooner or later.
”I don’t know if I made the right choice to. I still don’t know these things…just the science of it. That doesn't help anymore.”
”You were always so defensive about it that I thought it would be better to not discuss it. But the chemistry between both of us…is clear to read.”
”I got tea, can you open the door?” Sherlock asked, almost a bit ashamed by it. He heard footsteps before the door opened, revealing John in his grey sweater and sweatpants. As usual, nothing has changed. That was until Sherlock looked up at John’s face. His cheeks were puffy, and his eyes red. He had been crying. But now when Sherlock was here, he held back the tears. But Sherlock noticed.
John saw that, and that did it for him. His tears started falling, and he drew in a shaking breath. That made Sherlock look at him, and he could, for the first time since he lost his childhood dog, feel his heartbreak.
He stopped outside of John’s bedroom door, staring at the dark wood. Maybe this was a bad idea. No, his mind argued. John needed to talk. Sherlock knew that was logical.
”You want to..go further?” John asked, a bit breathless by the touches he was receiving. He looked down at Sherlock and rose a hand to push a curl from his eyes. John loved Sherlock’s hair after he had run his hands through it.  John’s body shaded Sherlock’s face from the light from the telly, but he could see him. Sherlock met his gaze with a soft grin, his eyes twinkling with some lust John had only seen once before when they made love for the first time.
But as Sherlock turned to hold his jar up to the light he saw tears in John’s eyes. They made John’s eyes darker. It made Sherlock curious, and surprisingly a bit concerned. What made John upset? If it was a person he would personally track him down and murder him without a chance of his body ever being found. He forged his gaze away and leaned down to add another liquid o his first, creating a small explosion in the water, making it splash over the table.
”Go for it,” John said, now voice filled with desperation. ”Just fuck me!”
”Good,” Sherlock replied as he sat back, and slipped one finger in. John bit his lip again, harder this time. As the pain subsided, he let out the breath he held in. John knew he was supposed to breathe, so he did. He took long deep breaths as Sherlock started to pump the finger in and out slowly.
”You will see,” Sherlock said grinning as well, knowing John would not be able to keep quiet. John groaned, getting it too.
”Wake me up when you leave, I don’t want to wake up alone.”
”Stay with me.” He breathed, feeling tears start to fill his eyes. ”The ambulance is here soon.”
He got no response except a small huff. Sherlock’s pulse was beating visibly on the side of his neck, while John’s was weak.
Sherlock leaned back and gripped his hips again. That commanding voice really turned him on, and John knew that. Now Sherlock pushed all the way in, making John’s arms give out from under him. Forehead resting on his arms John cried out in pleasure as Sherlock started to fuck him, pretty hard.
He looked up at Sherlock, who was looking down at him, head tilted to the side. He wheezed, as if trying to gather enough strength to speak. Slowly he twitched his fingers, and John saw it. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand tightly with the one that weren't holding the jacket, squeezing it.
John turned around and reached up to grab Sherlock’s neck to pull him in for a kiss. And now it was a tired, loving kiss, which Sherlock returned, grabbing John’s neck as well. When they both leaned back, John tried to stifle a yawn, unsuccessfully. Sherlock smiled and went to grab him a blanket, and a towel. John dried himself off before snuggling up in the blanket.
”I..don’t..wanna..die..” He said with surprising strength, before all of it seemed to drain from him. His eyes drooped, and John slapped his cheek again. John had never seen Sherlock so weak, so vulnerable. And he never wanted to again.
”As long as you can last, doctor,” Sherlock said, looking straight at the other man with the most seducing look John had ever seen. John felt his stomach turn, violently. He was already hard, and Sherlock hadn't even touched him yet. Then Sherlock went over to lean back down over John and pressed a soft kiss to his lips. Just that, lips pressed to lips. It was quick, as Sherlock never wanted John to have a chance to kiss him back.
”John!” He heard a familiar voice, and soon footsteps coming closer. A warm hand landed on his shoulder, bringing him out of his little bubble. Lestrade looked down at him, eyes wide and concerned, tears in them. ”Come on mate.” He said after swallowing hard.
Sherlock broke the kiss, and John opened his eyes to look at him. The light from the TV highlighted his cheekbones from the side, casting a slight glow to his eyes. His lips were highlighted as well, looking very welcoming to kiss again. No words were spoken as they both leaned in again, Sherlock’s hand moving from his thigh to his neck. Breaking the kiss, they looked at each other and smiled softly.
”Do you have to go?” He asked before he could stop himself. He felt himself blush, and kept his gaze on the cup, even if he felt John looking up at him. It sounded like a plea almost, which was very out of character for him.
”Call Lestrade.” John offered, still not looking up.
”I got a mail from my previous commander.”
Sherlock hummed to show that he was listening before adding more of the other liquid, making the remaining substance bloat and spill over onto the table. It grew pink and almost seemed corrosive.
He felt John shift his head with a great effort, before letting it fall back on Sherlock shoulder, this time facing his neck.
Sherlock smiled. There wasn’t anything else to do. He just told John how he felt, and John did not hate him. Maybe because he was his lifeline now. He might despise him after a good nights rest in a warm bed. But this was now.
”You can’t. Not yet.” Sherlock said in a warning voice as he slid another finger in, making John groan quietly.
At the thought of it, Sherlock’s hand went to the back of John’s shoulder, light fingers tracing the scar. John felt it, and a soft smile touched his lips. He pressed his hand to Sherlock’s side, his other to his jaw. He loved the way Sherlock touched his scar. It felt healing, in some way.
He couldn't return.
”Let me through, no he’s my friend.” He pleaded and pushed himself between the crowd to fall to his knees beside the body.
”John.” He whispered and tried to lift him, but the chain stopped it. His arms were getting tired. He couldn’t hold him up anymore. Then he started to panic. His brain abandoned him, and he was left with nothing.
”No, he needs me!” John said and looked over at Sherlock’s face. The blue irised still stared up at the sky, dark and empty. ”Yes, you’re gonna be okay.” He mumbled to himself, somehow not understanding that Sherlock was dead.
”Nothing. Not a single case.”
Holding up a cup he smiled gently, unsure what to do. John softly smiled back and moved aside to let Sherlock in. Okay, Sherlock thought, this was new. He had never been in John’s room before. Well, not when John was there.
”No.” He grunted, before squeezing his eyes shut. His body began to convulse, and tears streamed down his cheeks. He heard a distant call of his name, but it seemed so far away. John leaned over him, nausea filling him to the brim.
”It’s okay. Calm down… I love…” Then the cold water swallowed him. Sherlock tried to lift him, but couldn’t. Not even adrenalin could break chains. He pulled. He cursed. He cried. Then he saw a light. A flashlight. And voices. Then a man landed beside him, and dived under the surface. Sherlock couldn’t speak. He just chanted John’s name. Then, as the chain was off and John floated to the surface, Sherlock held him and just sobbed. John gasped in air and coughed out water, before he was taken by the paramedics. Then Sherlock knew they were going to be ok.
”Jh..n”
”You ready?” Sherlock asked, his voice now warm and caring. John nodded and gave a soft groan before pushing back up against Sherlock’s cock, feeling it press against his entrance, but not enter. He wanted to cry now, and let out another groan. He wanted it now, fast and hard. And a proper handjob too. Although, in that case, he would finish in seconds. And Sherlock didn't want that.
John stared at the email, his fingers tightening on the edge of the table. He couldn't believe it. Apparently, his whole old army was being called to war again, this time in Iraq. There was a bombing going on, a work by terrorists. He swallowed hard, feeling nausea coming creeping up on him. He was gonna be sick. He bit his finger hard, trying to hold back tears. This couldn't be true, not when everything was going so well. He could not return to war now, he had finally got his life together. He got a job, a partner and a home. For once in his life he ate well, he exercised while on cases and he slept rather well. Usually, if he had a nightmare Sherlock would calm him down, and he did a very well job at it. He had gotten used to waking up beside Sherlock. He could not return now, he was already scarred enough.
John did not know when Sherlock disappeared from his sight. One second he was there, the next he was gone. His long legs carried him faster than Jon’s short, and he was soon far in front of him. Still John ran the fastest he could through the crowds of London’s street, following him, heart beating hard in his chest. Soon a gun shot echoed through between the walls of London, making John’s heart miss a beat. He prayed that Sherlock was unhurt, or the one that pulled the trigger. Soon he could see a body through the people starting to gather around, and his heart sank fast. That coat.
”John, I called Lastrade.” He said, trying to keep his voice steady. ”They’re on their way.”
”More.” He groaned, not realizing his mistake. If Sherlock knew he wanted it, he wouldn't give it. Instead, he continued to pound into him, hitting his prostate over and over again. Sherlock leaned over John’s back, grabbed his cock, and pumped it in time with his trusts. The moment he grabbed his cock, John cried out, and he pumped it faster. Then John came harder than he had ever done in his life, all over the couch, clenching down almost painfully on Sherlock’s cock. He moaned loudly as white cum landed on the brown couch, and Sherlock pumped his now sensitive cock pretty roughly. As wave after wave of the overstimulation hit him, he started to scream. He grabbed the hand touching him but didn't stop him.
John tipped his head back to get his mouth above water and spit some out.
”Pleasant,” Sherlock replied, face straight, but with a loving look in his eyes. His fingers were feeling the soft material of John’s sweater, almost identical to the one he had borrowed. It was so soft, Sherlock adored it. John smile caught his eye, and he looked back up. John laughed softly and looked down at Sherlock’s hands, which were now in his lap, before taking them in his. Sherlock’s gaze joined his as he held them, before starting to stroke them with his thumbs.
John’s heart broke, and he rubbed Sherlock’s back. ”Of course.” He whispered and pulled Sherlock closer. He felt the other man lay his head in between his shoulder and neck, the rest of his body pressed against him. His knee bent over John’s legs, radiating warmth through their clothes.
”Please.” Before he knew it, the words slipped from his lips, and he blushed. He hadn't meant to beg. He had never begged for mercy in his life. That just showed how much power John had over him.
”You’re doing good.” John mumbled weakly, voice almost not strong enough to be heard. But Sherlock heard it. And it made his head flutter. He raised a hand to hold around John’s shoulders instead of under, and John leaned his head against his chest, under his chin. For a moment, he risked getting submerged, just to lay against the detectives chest.
He could have screamed in joy when Sherlock gripped his hips again and started to pound into him, making John gasp in surprise. Then his prostate was hit, and John actually screamed out. Sherlock breathed heavily from behind him, and John knew he was failing to tease him. Sherlock was giving in now. But just as John had thought that a hard slap landed on his left ass cheek, and he groaned in pain. Yes, it hurt, but something about it added to his painfully hard cock. Something about being spanked turned him on.
”Will you be good?”
Slowly they moved closer until John ended up in Sherlock’s lap. He still held Sherlock’s face in his hands, kissing him hungrily, yet gently. John didn't want to scare Sherlock off by going too rough. The detective almost whined as he leaned his head back against the backrest of the couch, kissing John back sweetly. His hands moved to John’s back and slipped under his sweater. His warm hands roamed over John’s skin, making him shudder. Shyly Sherlock let his hands wander lower until they reached the elastic of John’s sweatpants. They lingered by it for a while, before pulling it down over John’s bum. John felt the air on his skin as it was exposed to the air in the room, and he broke the kiss to drew in a shaking breath. He let it out as a soft chuckle and nodded for Sherlock to continue. Sherlock smiled at him as he reached down and palmed his bum. Sherlock just held it, and John was torn around pressing against his crotch or his hands. He decided on the latter and pushed his bum back. Sherlock hummed and squeezed it gently, loving the sighs coming from John. He did well.
”Fuck no.”
”If you are good and quiet, I will reward you,” Sherlock said. ”If you’re bad, I’ll punish you.”
He held John tighter, noticing how he didn’t shiver anymore. It was a bad sign.
John looked up and leaned in to kiss him again, slowly, to let Sherlock knew what he was gonna do. Sherlock understood at once and met it eagerly. This time it was different. It was as if they could read each other's minds. One of John’s hands went to Sherlock’s cheek, the other to his neck. Sherlock’s hand went to John’s waist, holding a handful of his shirt. John tilted his head a bit, and they deepened the kiss a little. It flowed so naturally. Slowly but surely John’s hand moved to Sherlock’s thigh, and the detective’s hand moved to cover John’s. To encourage him. Their kiss slowly grew bolder, and soon even sloppy. Their lips parted to let their tongues quickly touch, before going back to lips.
And then Sherlock was gone – to Lestrade’s car, presumably.
“We’ve been together for quite some time now, and we’ve been friends even longer. A year ago, I would’ve called you my best friend, Sherlock.”
“Well, we most definitely aren’t. Sisters, I mean,” Sherlock said, “I guess you’re a very close friend, as well. All the pages I’ve consulted say that being friends already greatly helps with…”
“To the old lady’s house!” Sherlock replied, as if it were completely obvious.
This time, it had not been manipulatory – that much he knew.
“Enough,” Lestrade said, then got up from his chair, standing somewhat tall at five foot eleven.
“Undecided,” she said, because it sounded better than ‘I don’t know’.
It was, in fact, Mr Brown from downstairs.
“But they’ll be on the papers tomorrow,” Lestrade pointed out.
And he was still hoping that she’d invite her sister.
“Remember the Garrideb case,” Joanna said. “When that bullet grazed me. That’s when… it happened.”
“A steaming pile of shit, that’s what she wrote. That my dad wasn’t my actual dad and that I was the son of this farmer she met – she was going senile, that’s all.”
“I’m truly amazed at how far my sister has come with people lately. And you,” Mycroft asked him, “do you have siblings?”
“Do yours…?”
She was jumping in place, like a puppy – she’d actually just grabbed her coat. Her short, curly hair moved in unison with her head and hands, which clapped briefly, once.
“I’m not going to call her,” Anderson stated, and it’s not like Lestrade would’ve let him, anyway.
He bowed again.
“I don’t think I deserve you,” Sherlock replied, in earnest.
And that’s how she knew it had been the wrong thing to say.
Lestrade had to restrain himself from groaning. “Did you know about the money beforehand?” he asked.
“You’re right, I’m sorry. Please resume.” Sherlock sat back down, crossing her long legs and holding her chin with her left hand, a caricature of an attentive listener.
“Again, your words, not mine,” he said.
“Don’t worry about the insurance – we told them she’d fallen from the kitchen counter at home. She always stands on the bloody thing when she’s trying to reach the high shelves, so it’s bound to happen someday, really. I always tell her not to…”
“I don’t want the bitch there,” the architect told his lawyer, who shook his head. Lestrade knew why he’d said it – Sherlock’s fame was well established; however enthusiastic they might have been, Jo’s stories on her blog were quite clear on her abilities. For a guilty person, Sherlock Holmes really wasn’t an ally. Still, it annoyed him.
“Irrelevant.” Sherlock was scanning each letter, setting all of them aside on top of the blanket. “Someone saw these, and didn’t like it.”
“We’re working on it,” Sherlock told him. Even Jo looked surprised.
forced her to climb that chair.” Which was something she’d thought often, but never said out loud, in the past few days, that she’d spent at home, playing Joanna’s favourite tunes at the violin and staring at her from afar. Their relationship, already such a delicate affair, had never felt so much like walking on eggshells. What if she’d given her brain damage. What if she left while she was on the crime scene.
“Thanks,” Joanna said, and laughed, perhaps nervously, but the car wasn’t completely awkward.
“Stop the car,” Sherlock told Joanna, who had already activated the turn signal.
“You solved this case,” Sherlock told her once it was over.
“Agamemnon,” the handsome man replied, without giving a surname, and Lestrade thought,
“He said to give the last two tickets to Sherlock Holmes,” he said, squinting, unable to help himself – his face had done the thing it did when he was a child and he broke the flower vases while playing with the ball in the yard. More specifically, the face he made when he had to tell his mum what had happened.
“I’ll let you know about any developments!” Lestrade promised on his way out, courteously escorted by Mrs Hudson – about the case or about Mycroft, he told to himself.
“Yes,” Jo replied, “no, maybe, I didn’t really get it. Not all of them were letters.”
And sure enough, Sherlock appeared from around the corner five short minutes later – they’d somehow managed to park, Lestrade figured, because behind her, in a red dress and high heels, hair down and bright lipstick, came the doctor, looking embarrassed, but not too uncomfortable about the whole thing. And Sherlock and Joanna were holding hands.
Her features softened, eyes still focused on the street.
The cold lasted until one morning, three days before the play.
And his plans were kind of ruined, because someone, in West London, had seen it fit to murder an old lady with a phone charger on the floor of her own living room. Without leaving significant traces. In a flat, where none of the doors, internal or external, showed signs of intrusion, and where all the other tenants swore that she was such a sweet grandma who always gave candy to the multitude of children under the age of five who lived there.
“Oh. Can you tell her we found twenty thousand pounds underneath the floor of Mr Brown’s apartment?”
She stopped in her tracks, and it took Sherlock a moment before she, too, realized the implications of what she had said.
Joanna had a different look on her face than Sherlock was expecting. It was no longer an ‘I’m sorry’ face. “I don’t understand. Do you want to be a Mycroft?”
“You visited often?” Lestrade asked.
She knew that more than one woman had been driven away by her presence.
“So someone else had the keys, for emergencies,” Sherlock suggested, and the man nodded.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Joanna asked.
“Half past what?”
“The bloody siren, Lestrade!” Sherlock shouted.
Joanna’s eyes were still closed. She peeked out from the right one, which had an unusual glisten in it, although it wasn’t quite wet – Sherlock had never seen her cry. “You’re making me cry, you idiot,” she said, then, after a short struggle with the sofa, Sherlock’s legs, and her jeans, she laid on top of her and buried her head in Sherlock’s chest.
Lestrade had had an inkling. He said nothing. “Yeah,” Lestrade said, “right.”
But, as one neighbour had told the EMTs, she did not have any living relatives, not anymore, after her husband’s death: their only son, Michael, had run away in his early twenties, and was now a successful architect somewhere; he paid her rent every month and nothing more.
“Guess it makes sense.”
“What’s in there?” Lestrade asked.
“My great uncle did something similar, and they only knew because when he was seventy-five, he left my great aunt to move in with his friend from tennis. They’d been together for twenty years,” Joanna supplied.
“No,” Sherlock said, “you don’t.”
“And the other two tickets?” Lestrade asked in the end, taking advantage of a pause in the employer’s loud monologue, that he probably only made to allow himself to breathe.
Lestrade was fully expecting Sherlock to escalate it – to say nasty things about Mrs Anderson and her profession, and he was fully prepared to physically stop either of them, if needed. But then Sherlock’s ears turned back to their original colour, and her lips, already ajar, ready to spit fire, closed again on her teeth.
“They’ve had long enough to deal with it,” she said anyway.
“Of course he has, my boy. She’s saved him so many times! And call me Margaret, please,” his mother replied, “or, even better, Maggie.”
” Joanna recited.
Then Joanna handed him the keys of the old, battered blue car, which he drove obediently through London; then he dropped them off at the entrance of St Bart’s. The first few minutes they were silent, on opposite sides of the backseat, almost like two kids who have recently been in a fight. Then Sherlock scooped closer – was she holding out the olive branch? Then Lestrade saw that the doctor’s head was bleeding profusely, and Sherlock was holding a napkin, that quickly turned from white to bright red. Joanna’s eyes were half closed now, and her head had fallen dangerously to the side.
She smiled, exposing perfect white teeth; and when Lestrade thought she’d mercifully neglected to mention his pitiful state, she added, “You look quite handsome, as well.” He had to stop himself from shaking his head.
“Clichés don’t suit you,” Jo said. “I love you. It doesn’t matter if you deserve it or not, ‘cause I do.”
“I’m afraid the consulting detective is my sister,” Mycroft replied, polite as always, holding out a hand for Lestrade’s mother to shake.
“No,” Parris said, “I had absolutely no idea it was there.”
Mrs Hudson opened the door, greeting him with the usual smile and showing the same deference she always had towards him, most likely convinced that he was a much bigger fish than he actually was. When he announced it to Sherlock herself, it wasn’t actually all that bad – as in, she took the tickets from his hands, stared at them for a few seconds as if they were soil samples from Mars, then put them down carefully on their bare kitchen table as if they could break.
“Come here,” Joanna said.
Somehow, somewhere, Lestrade still felt the need to save face; he knew that allowing them on the crime scene was a huge breach of protocol already, as it had been on every single other crime scene they’d been to; he knew their very presence at the time was highly illegal, but it had reached the point where even Gregson knew about them, and looked away, so he guessed he had nothing to lose.
“It’s just a spider,” she replied.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” Joanna told her, since she was not answering.
it began.
“Two girls and one boy. They’re lovely,” Lestrade replied.
It proved itself a pointless debate, because Sherlock didn’t answer seven of his calls, and when Jo finally did, she told him that she was at the surgery and that she couldn’t contact her roommate, either.
“That’s not so unbelievable, all things considered,” Sherlock pointed out.
“I know you asked my sister if I was going to come,” Mycroft told him.
“Thanks, I guess,” Jo replied. “Actually, I meant…”
Sherlock shrugged.
“This one isn’t a letter,” Jo said after a while, after Anderson had left. “I noticed last night. It’s a Word document. It looks like a story.”
It would have been a lie to say that he’d never seen Sherlock Holmes in any kind of distress: he’d seen her at the pool, and he’d seen her almost overdose, and he’d tried to restrict her access to crime scenes often enough that he knew what she looked like when she was upset, or when she was pretending to be for manipulatory purposes.
“Like this,” Sherlock praised, as Joanna’s body gradually disappeared, eaten by the foul smelling crawl space above them, “hold onto the little string thing – do you see any signs of…?”
The clock on his desk was white and cheap, a relic from his divorce, and it often fell behind. It was too slow at counting seconds, although it wasn’t really noticeable, even when Lestrade tried staring at it. As the employer spoke, the Detective Inspector checked his own wristwatch and corrected the time on the battered clock.
And sure enough, at five o’clock in the afternoon – five past, actually, Lestrade made a stop to the bathroom to freshen himself up and stare at his old suit, desperately wishing he’d worn the nicer one instead – a black car with tinted windows was parked just outside the entrance. To further dissipate any doubts he still had, the door opened as soon as he left the building, and a muscular young man walked out of it. He had long hair, perfectly styled in a bun, and wore a fancy looking suit; Lestrade suddenly wished for the pavement to collapse underneath him and swallow him whole.
“Not that there’s anything to make peace with,” Lestrade replied, then hoped he hadn’t crossed any lines.
“Do you promise?”
It sounded harsh, and sudden and brutal, like a stone being dropped on the floor.
‘There’ was a housing estate in a not very nice part of London. The woman, Louisa Parris, occupied the top floor, and had done so since the sixties, when she’d married her late husband, Albert. He had died just six months earlier, after a lifetime spent working at a Ford plant and a short stint as a small business owner after he’d retired.
“You hadn’t realized… my sister’s inclinations,” she continued, and
“Don’t worry,” she said, “it’s late, anyway.”
Her voice reminded Lestrade of his own primary school teacher, whenever a child started crying.
Sherlock was on the run – already in the hall, ballet flats clattering loudly; Jo stood at the entrance, looking at her flatmate – girlfriend, Lestrade corrected himself – the way a mother looks at a rebellious child.
“Is Sherlock there?”
And that’s how Lestrade found out he was going to attend a premiere at the most obnoxious theatre of London, near the middle of December, together with a plus one that was still to be determined, Donovan’s live-in partner, Sherlock Holmes and whatever human being constituted her romantic life.
“Do you want to read the letters?” Sherlock asked then, because she desperately wanted to talk about the case, or anything else, for that matter.
“I thought you’d never ask, Gregory,” Mycroft said, then pulled out a planner from her black handbag.
“Now she won’t, after yesterday’s scare,” Lestrade said, not really sure of where Sherlock was going.
He felt like he was being allowed into such a personal situation – even if it hadn’t been deliberate, hell, he’d just happened to be there. He still felt closer to the consulting detective then he’d ever been. And he realized something – that had already occurred to him during the play, even though he’d almost forgotten about it in the following events: that there are times when we are required to make a choice and do something, with some urgency, as well. Specifically, this was one of those times, and the choice was between supporting them or not, and both were definitely actions – lack of support would have been as decisive as open disapproval.
The doctor was thinking, Sherlock could tell; Joanna’s eyes were focused on her, all curled up on the sofa, on her long legs that she was hugging against her chest.
“What if the mistake isn't stupid, Jo? What if I fuck up? And you know I will,” Sherlock retorted.
And even Joanna was upset, Lestrade could tell. As for himself, he’d never really considered the fact that someone, somewhere, must have generated Sherlock Holmes. And Mycroft, although it was even harder to imagine that they’d come from the same environment. Mycroft was much older; maybe something had gone horribly wrong in the meantime?
“Seriously? Mycroft knew I was gay years before I even knew what it meant,” Sherlock said, and once again Lestrade thought of all the signs – the lack of male companions, the way she’d seemed uninterested towards the few Yard officers who had tried to make a move on her… Lestrade had assumed she must have been some kind of inanimate object, devoid of feelings, of personal relationships – and then realized how unnecessarily complicated that was, how… simple the truth.
“I leave bullet holes on the walls, Joanna.”
“But,” Lestrade predicted.
“I don’t see why we’re arguing,” she tried. “If… nothing had happened, if things were the way they were one year ago, we could still go together as friends. You’re my assistant, my roommate, and you blog about me. No one would find anything strange about it.”
Then the doctor screamed, the string thing snapped, and the chair did a little dance on its four legs before falling sideways. A moment later Joanna was falling too, on top of it.
“It was old,” Joanna said, digging it out from the pile. “They began dating when she was just sixteen – in 1956.”
“Then why…?”
“And how does it make you feel?” Joanna said, tilting her head as she asked, the way she always did.
“Can’t imagine,” Lestrade said.
Lestrade grinned. “How long have you two…?”
The man whose name was on the ticket was also the owner of a recently opened bank account in Barbados, which took no more than fifteen minutes to find. On the bank account were eight hundred thousand pounds minus twenty thousand, and they’d been deposited there the day after the murder. His documents were skilled forgeries and he looked rather disappointed as the Detective Inspector was forced to arrest him.
Joanen picked up one, holding it carefully from one corner.
The lawyer’s face was hidden by both of his cupped hands now.
“It’ll be quick.”
“Oh,” Lestrade said, because they were both staring. “I’m sure you’ll get there, eventually.”
Once they were finished, Sherlock attempted to leave without saying goodbye, so Joanna dragged her to Lestrade’s office, where she thanked him for the patience, which made him smile.
“You look great!” the doctor said, quick enough to almost cover Sherlock’s comment. She looked like she was in a hurry to join them, someone she knew among London’s best.
“I’m not really understanding anything right now.”
“Was it the neighbour?” Joanna asked. “Is it solved finally? You were driving me insane. Why was Lestrade so busy, again?”
“Follow them,” Mycroft said, “I’m afraid you must,” and then, “I’ll take care of Mrs Lestrade. I’m sure we’ll have a lot to talk about. Just give her the keys, since you’ll most likely be late.”
This left Lestrade with more questions than answers.
“Either the husband’s not really dead…”
“Because you said so.”
“You’re saying this, not me,” Parris replied.
It truly took him by surprise, mostly because it was so obvious, and had been all along – gone were the days of teenage rebellion: it was no longer uncool to bring your own parents to social events. Rather, it had become honourable – and Margaret would have enjoyed it, too.
Now Jo was sleeping, and Sherlock was watching her sleep, the way she did almost every night since they’d begun sharing a bed, in early June, just as the weather really began to warm up – but that hadn’t seemed to bother them: they’d slept embracing each other that entire first month. They fell asleep hugging, then, until Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night, and saw that they’d drifted a bit apart, so she immediately closed the distance again.
the text said.
she replied.
“Thanks,” she replied, sounding uncertain.
“You didn’t know about your father’s activities, then? Must have been such a shock, to see all that money…”
Joanna fell silent for a couple of seconds. “OK,” she replied, “I can tell her that.”
“Clearly not,” Sherlock said.
“I don’t think I want to know. I don’t want to ruin this. Forget it. Sleep.”
“We need to wait some more,” Lestrade replied, already regretting the call.
“That almost never happens, Jo,” Sherlock interrupted her, and Lestrade noticed that there wasn’t any disdain in her voice, like there would’ve been if a Yard officer had said the same thing.
“Your parents. Or what we just did. It’s out there now – it can’t be undone. How does it make you feel. How…” Joanna began.
, when Joanna spoke, with the most neutral tone she was capable of.
“I have a brother,” he said then. “Robert. He works in London, got wife and kids – three kids.”
They made love that first Friday night, and then some more times, not too few but not too many. Every time it sent a new shiver down Sherlock’s back. When, in late May, she saw Mycroft for the first time since the fateful encounter, her sister shot her a knowing look. It wasn’t acknowledged.
“Did they find the crawlspace or not?” Joanna asked her.
“Yeah, she likes it a lot,” Robert said.
“You…”
Lestrade nodded; he was sure his mum had some stories as well, although no one had ever tried to ask her.
“She’d already called the publisher – the fuck did she want to make, an exposé? About a dead man? I couldn’t stand to see her disrespect him so much. I guess I lost it, I’ll admit.”
“No one told me I couldn’t leave the country!” Parris complained, raising his hands to his head.
“I don’t want to lose what we have over a stupid mistake. And I will make a stupid mistake, at some point,” she articolated.
“And why would they keep it there? Didn’t your father start that business, right before he died? That nobody really went to, but it still stayed afloat somehow…”
The truth was that she, unlike Joanna, who still occasionally had to turn away men who mistook her kindness for flirting and couldn’t take no for an answer, who simply couldn’t grasp the idea that Joanna Watson could be gay, she, Sherlock, was much easier to spot, or so she thought.
“And you must be Mrs Lestrade?” Jo asked, holding out her right hand to Margaret.
was the nickname her classmates had given her at the all girls public school she’d attended. She could still feel it etched on her forehead in all caps.
He came back to the scene four days later, at Sherlock’s insistence, because she hadn’t been able to properly analyze it the first time, with Joanna nearly giving herself brain damage and all. He’d had to keep her waiting – he’d had a robbery gone wrong in the meantime, which had been easy and tedious and more gruesome than usual. He’d received an email from his lawyer, which he’d ignored He’d spent
“I’d say so,” Mycroft replied, “unlike my poor sister. I hope she’ll behave herself. And that she won’t be too late,” she added, and then a familiar blue car passed them.
“Just don’t ruin them. Copy machine is in the other room.” They already knew where.
“Well, thank you, but I think you’re the only one in the world who would say such a thing.”
The bed was wide and they were both narrow enough; Sherlock wrapped one arm around Joanna’s stomach, then slipped the other one underneath her waist, between her warm body and the mattress. Then she laid her head somewhere between Joanna’s face, her collarbone, and the pillow. One side of her face was pressed against the mattress, and she said nothing.
“No, no, it’s… not that.” Sherlock straightened her legs in front of her. They were slender and long and her parents had tried to force her to do ballet. She could hear her heartbeat in her eardrums and her mouth was very dry. “They didn’t take it well,” she said after a while.
“You should sleep,” Sherlock told her.
April and May, they spent every waking hour together, and they slept together too. Sherlock had a room alone, with a double bed; Victoria moved in with her. She listened to her, even when she talked about biology, or chemistry, or different types of soil, and never rolled her eyes. When she was seen around with Victoria, no one even tried calling her a freak.
And Lestrade wondered, in no particular order, how on Earth Mycroft knew he was free – although that wasn’t exactly a wild guess, nowadays; and, more importantly, how on Earth she knew his shifts. Or maybe he’d told her – the memories of the previous night were blurry.
, one said; and it was by far the kindest. Mycroft saw them, Lestrade didn’t doubt it; but she said nothing about them.
“No,” he said, and laughed, half nervously and half relieved.
“So you’ll take her?”
“That he forced her to marry him and quit the peasant – he gave her a bloody good life!”
“He’s not lying,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock knew she wasn’t supposed to do it, but she always counted all the times in a week they slept hugging, mentally measured the distance between their bodies on the bed. She knew it was supposed to come naturally, but she felt the need to quantify it. The past three nights they’d slept further apart and had hugged only briefly; there hadn’t been any sex.
“This same identity is also the owner of a bank account in Barbados, containing seven hundred eighty thousand pounds. Do you confirm this?”
The man looked pained. Lestrade thought he understood.
“I could never,” Mycroft replied. “I bought the tickets ten months ago.”
“But we’re…”
So he figured that a diplomatic mission to 221b, Baker Street, was in his near future, but before he even had the time to plan it, Gregson threw another file on his desk.
“You can’t wear your normal clothes,” she explained, “there will be press. Dress or slacks? What colour?”
“They didn’t…” Jo began to ask.
“I didn’t want to make you feel bad,” Sherlock said then.
Sherlock didn’t comment – just raised her black eyebrows, once. Then got back to the letters.
“He didn’t speak? With you?”
“My mum’s coming to London again,” Lestrade explained. “We’ll celebrate at my brother’s house, with the kids.” He didn’t really see the point of sharing such information, except that Joanna was nice and he was beginning to consider her a friend, and they’d just decided to spend Christmas Eve together.
“We need to talk to the son,” Sherlock stated.
“Oh. How did it… go?”
She really looked like Lestrade’s primary school teacher now: her eyes were stern, but also cruelly compassionate, as if Parris were a particularly stupid and naive child, who’d just claimed to be the son of a celebrity.
“Here we are,” Jo said, parking the old car in front of the estate. “It’s quite late,” she said.
“I’m…”
“They wouldn’t take it away because of this; they already haven’t. If you weren’t so agreeable, perhaps. They tried, in the past, but not for that.” She was starting to speak fast, and not too coherently.
Back at Baker Street, after they’d driven Lestrade home, a long night was ahead of Sherlock and Joanna. They’d both left their dresses on the back of the sofa, and they’d changed into more comfortable clothes; Sherlock hadn’t been wearing too much makeup to begin with, and she wasn’t going to try to remove it, but Joanna had attempted to wipe hers away, and now it was mostly smudged on her cheekbones. Her eyes were red; she was tired. They’d changed in silence and she hadn’t tried to breach the subject of the phone call.
They walked past a shop with many different tabloids all lined up in the window – and Lestrade saw, couldn’t help but notice, the photos they’d all chosen for the cover.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock repeated.
“I’ll drive,” Joanna’s voice emerged from the kitchen. She was in jeans and was holding hot tea between her small hands. “We’re going to the shops for Christmas presents later, ands you’re coming,” she told Sherlock.
The man said nothing.
“You were a child genius,” Jo pointed out, which was another easy deduction, even though Sherlock had never told her so.
They were at the Yard less than forty-five minutes later, standing side by side but not really acknowledging each other’s presence.
“Letters,” Sherlock simply replied. “They were hidden by the blanket. Some have been taken. But there were too many for whoever did it.”
“And I have to apologize for something else, as well,” Sherlock added, her voice lower, legs straight in front of her. They were sitting on the plastic chairs outside the interrogation room, where Joanna had waited for them as they made Michael Parris talk.
“Can you turn the fucking thing down, Anderson?” she shouted.
“Where do you think you’re going?” a voice interrupted them from the crowd, as Lestrade hit the save button on the new contact he’d just added to his phone, under the name Mycroft Holmes. As if he knew any other Mycrofts.
“Yes, and you’re you,” Jo said.
“You’re too empathetic, Joanna,” was the reply. “You mustn’t grow attached to random old ladies who live in housing estates and who were choked to death in their living rooms.”
“It’s going to be alright,” he told her, feeling very fatherly, even though he had no children (he and Sophie had tried, but they just hadn’t come) and even though Sherlock was only ten years his junior.
“Introduce me to your friends!” she shouted, so loud that Mycroft must have heard her. “Is she the consultant you always work with?” And she smirked, because ever since the very first time Lestrade had clarified that Sherlock was in fact a girl’s name, his mother had been convinced that they were going to eventually get married, even though Lestrade himself was already married at the time. Then again, his mother never really liked Sophie.
Of course, everyone still recognized her at uni – it wasn’t hard, with her height and dyed black hair. She’d bonded with her labmates, she guessed, two brown haired boys with glasses who worked hard and didn’t ask personal questions.
Sherlock didn’t reply – they heard her fumble with something in the crawlspace for a few seconds, then she came down from the chair, carefully, holding a bundle in her arms. It was covered with an old blanket, and not as dusty as it should have been, which was so obvious even Lestrade could tell.
She showed Joanna where to put her right foot and which cupboard to grab to lift herself off the floor and into the small crawl space. The doctor obediently copied her – her shorter legs more challenged by the height of the kitchen chair, until she could finally stand on its crocheted seat cover.
“Who the hell even calls it that?” Joanna said in lieu of an answer.
Later that night, in Mycroft Holmes’s bed, he thought briefly about Louisa Parris, née Elmer, about Sherlock and Joanna and, lastly, about himself and the warm body beside him.
Sherlock considered pretending that she didn’t remember what she’d said, but she knew that Joanna would see through it. “They’d find you agreeable,” she confirmed. “You have good manners and you are attractive. These are the only two criteria they apply to people. Other than class, but they’d make an exception.”
“And that, well… I wouldn’t have said that I’m close to her until a few days ago, but it feels like something clicked now. Joanna helped.”
“She’s not two years old!” Lestrade replied. “You didn’t force her to do anything. She doesn’t look like the type of person who lets other people force her to do anything.”
“All the children, crying,” Sherlock told him as they took him to the Yard for questioning, although he’d just pretty much confessed: he’d opened the door late at night, using his keys, because the old lady had started sewing again, and the machine was so old and so loud, and as if that weren’t enough, she’d turned on the fucking radio, and he’d heard the first two notes of the Hail Mary and his light had just gone out. He had a baby, for God’s sake, and she was a fussy sleeper, and she woke up every time the old bitch turned on the Catholic channel on the radio. You know, a man can try, but enough is enough, he kept saying, eyes on Lestrade, looking for his understanding, maybe, which he certainly could not give: he’d never had a newborn, or homicidal thoughts. Not seriously, although with Sherlock he’d sure as hell been close.
“That’s the single most reassuring thing you’ve ever told me,” he pointed out.
“Yes,” Lestrade said. “Murdered old woman, sweetest grandma to ever exist according to her neighbours, no signs of forced entry. That’s got to be at least a six,” he tried, remembering the point system that Joanna had mentioned a few times, to him and on her blog.
Joanna didn’t sleep, either – Sherlock could hear the muffled sounds of pages being turned, papers being handled by Joanna’s surprisingly delicate hands. And she felt a pang of hatred in her chest, towards the letters, towards the case and the old lady, and towards herself too.
“Why are there six of them?” he tried to ask, but the fair youth had already walked away. He was left staring at her coat and purse, in the cold London air. Christmas was approaching, and the shopkeepers had already filled their windows with obnoxious decorations; large, shiny balls of gold and silver were already hanging on cables in the larger streets.
“You’re into theatre, then!” his mother replied in lieu.
“They’ll be on live television tonight, and our parents won’t miss a Racine premiere,” she corrected him. “I think she’s ready,” she added then. “Surely she must have realized what it meant. To take Joanna here.”
“Whose letters are they?” Joanna asked.
He sounded horrified, when they told him about his mother’s fate; to Lestrade’s relief, he had an airtight alibi, and, as Sherlock had already told them, no good reason to want his mother dead. Sherlock was there, too, in her usual chair in the questioning room. How on Earth they managed to sneak her in every time, Lestrade would never figure it out, and hoped he’d never have to.
“Maybe it was a robbery,” Lestrade said, “only committed by the son himself. He gave poor Mr Brown twenty thousand to confess to the murder, and he was planning on moving to Thailand.”
“Yes. We’ve been living together for two years, we’ve been sleeping in the same bed for six months, and we’re planning to keep it that way – or are you not? I feel like that’s not too much to ask.”
The man rolled his eyes – but his cuffed hands were shaking; Lestrade was sure they were close to breaking him.
It wasn’t thick. She broke the seal with a knife; inside was the ticket for the play. There was no note.
“Maybe he made up the thing with the baby to keep the money for his family,” Donovan tried.
“And how are you planning to get there?” Joanna replied, and underneath her light makeup, so clearly applied by someone else, Lestrade rejoiced in seeing Sherlock Holmes blush.
“You’re back, already,” his mother’s voice said. “Heard your footsteps on the stairs. Those shoes are loud.”
“Surprising. She seems to think that everyone knows at first glance.”
Then she left for the car, and Lestrade was left scrambling for them, because he wasn’t going to call a cab at this hour.
“Bollocks” he shouted in the end. “All bloody lies.” The dam broke and he began punching the table in front of him, as his lawyer crossed his legs and buried his face in his hands.
“It was the Catholic channel,” Anderson supplied, “my mum listens to that all the time.”
“I figured you’d be her plus one!”
Sherlock sat down next to her, hugging her knees, face buried between them.
“Gregson?” Donovan preceded him, because she’d noticed the thing his mouth had done.
He’d even made a move towards her, just a few months before, at the start of the summer, so as soon as he’d felt comfortable asking someone out after the divorce papers. He’d texted her an invite for dinner, that she’d declined claiming ‘work’, ‘you’re a really nice guy, but’, and ‘Sherlock’s waiting, see you soon’. He hadn’t been too devastated afterwards, and they’d even gone out for a drink at the bar a few times since. She was a football fan and could be very jovial, when not on the job. On crime scenes, she was very respectful, unlike Sherlock, and a few times she’d treated the deceased’s relatives with a lot of empathy, which wasn’t so strange, Lestrade now realized, since she worked in healthcare. Out of all the people who were, more or less, recurring characters in his personal life, she was the only one who hadn’t first met Gregory Lestrade as a married man, and he found something almost sensual in that.
