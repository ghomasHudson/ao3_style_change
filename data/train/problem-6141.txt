So, it might haven't actually been by chance that new guy—Tony, apparently—was standing right by his locker. Steve finally managed a smile and nodded. "I am. Did you need anything?"
His boyfriend pinched his lips and despite being all flustered and embarrassed, he threw a challenging glance at Steve that meant he was gonna go through with it and tell everyone about that first day they met that, despite what Tony thought, Steve remembered very well.
Steve had sat up and looked at his boyfriend burrowing through the sheets with a fond smile. He brushed gentle fingers on his face, removing his damp hair from his forehead. "JARVIS?" He called out. "I'm taking the day off too."
Steve shrugged. Annoyed. "But that's what everyone's thinking, right?" He spatted, sounding more bitter than he had intended to. "Oh, you heard? The Rogers kid's omega. Really? Oh poor Sarah. That's trouble. A kid like that. You know what they say..." He chuckled, looking down in despair. "Don't pretend you're not thinking like them. Don't fucking pretend!"
He wished Steve's words weren't so biting though. His boyfriend was particularly mean right now, probably because he had been grudgy for quite some time already. This went way deeper than just missing the party. Steve had reasonable reasons to be mad at Tony. What could he say? He had no excuse for his behavior, no acceptable explanation for trashing his face or fucking that girl. Only that Tony fucked up. He was selfish and he fucked up. But don't ask him why, he couldn't tell himself.
"You'll get over it." Steve replied bluntly as he was already starting to empty his cupboards. "Just like
He hasn't told anyone of course... Why would he? It's excruciating but he is strong enough, he thinks. He can love them both, from afar. He can be there for them while they indulge in the pleasure and sacrament of their bond. He will be there, even if it slowly kills him inside.
The thing is, whether they are together or not, Steve remains one of Tony's unhealthy obsessions. Rhodey always says that he should get a life outside of Steve, his therapist agrees, even Tony agrees, on principle. Surely that would be the healthiest thing to do but he also thinks he already has a life outside of Steve. He's plenty busy with things that are not Steve-related. He doesn't even find enough time to
Steve had been a little apprehensive, at first, to see his best friend and his alpha around each other—knowing what they shared now—but actually, seeing the two of them interact made him happy.
Tony chuckles bitterly, unable to process the sharp sincerity in Steve's voice. "You never wanted to submit." He says with a sad, melancholic smile.
Something indescribable flashed across Bucky's eyes. He startled and then panicked and inched back confusedly. "Wow, Stevie. What's the matter with you? You gone mad?"
Talking with Bucky helped him settling his feelings. Thor joined their idle conversation with a refreshing point of view, Clint was busy helping Natasha in the kitchen and the four science nerds were already in a heated discussion about whatever turned them on.
"I really advise you against it." She said but didn't insist. "And you'll have to sign a discharge."
"Anyone could see us..." Tony answered pragmatically, not paying attention to Steve's seductiveness, or pretending to anyway. "You sure that's what you want?"
Tony looked flustered and answered with another warm and gentle smile. "I..." He started, rolling his tongue on his lips. "You should get going. I don't want you to be late."
The nausea came back in the elevator, not because he reeked himself—he was kinda used to the smell by now, sadly—but because of Steve's repulsed face, because of his angry eyes and ominous silence. The creepy crawly feeling came back too. It itched, it scratched, it burnt. He wanted to crawl out of his skin, peel it off. He wanted to sink his nails into his skin and tear his flesh, to flay himself. Anything but the scornful stare of his boyfriend scorching him alive.
They greeted everyone. Steve hugged Bucky in a brotherly embrace. Tony and Clint kissed on the mouth, just a small peck on the lips, but Steve was painfully reminded of how close they had become, bonding over their respective shitty boyfriends. He hated the way Clint's hand lingered on his hip so casually and so intimately at the same time. It still stung, what had happened between them all those years ago. Steve had forgiven but not forgotten. And once again, when Tony smiled admiringly at Thor, Steve felt a surge of unwanted feelings creeping up inside. Bruce's girlfriend Betty was probably the only person in that room with whom Tony hadn't been indecent or promiscuous. Water had run under the bridge since then, Tony had changed a lot, grown up but it still bothered Steve somehow. Maybe he was the one who needed to grow up now.
"Hundreds of millions, Steve. That's hardly small beer, for anyone. I don't have that kind of cash. SI's money's not mine. It's for investment, and research, and functioning. I can't just throw it away on a whim."
The questions and congratulations flew thick and fast. The women asked enthusiastically about the baby, the men pretended they didn't care but still listened eagerly at the answers. Steve felt numb, still stunned by the news. He was only half-listening, millions of questions rushing to his brain.
Steve's heart leapt at the words. It did something to him when his boyfriend spoke in a foreign language but he ignored it and rolled his eyes. Determined to keep to his planned schedule, he started evaluating everything they had done in the morning and everything they had left to do, making plans for the afternoon tasks. Tony half-listened to him as he ate, smiling amusedly from time to time. When his plate was finished he wiped his mouth with a napkin and finished his glass of wine.
Steve smiles, looking at him sidelong. He is leaning against the back of the couch, arms crossed on his huge chest, and chuckles softly, expression amused.
Tony shrugged. He looked a bit melancholic, maybe trying to be understanding. There was something nostalgic in his eyes, as if he, too, was remembering his own childhood.
Tony and Steve fuck. The alpha and the omega... They fuck. And their bond, that invisible connection they share, is stronger than ever. The omega's bonding gland is red and pulsating all the time, to the point he can't even keep a straight mind anymore. He smells like heat and rut, although neither of them has experienced that for
A hotel sounded nice. But not for the kind of things they were planning to do to Tony, or the ones Tony was planning them to do to him. Besides, men tended to take liberties with Tony's body in hushed enclosed spaces. If he passed out, they would be more likely inclined to fuck his ass in the privacy of a room, whereas anal sex outside was a little tricky as a general rule. Tony wasn't particularly attracted to the idea of being trapped in a sordid motel room with three men that were obviously bad news anyway...
This is really shitty. I don't even know if I'll be able to do what I want to do, now. I'll have to take fucking suppressants my entire fucking life... This is
"I'm not saying we should give up on our dream." Tony explained, pragmatic. "But in the meantime, you can still move in with me."
Tony drank his glass in one go and poured himself another one before turning around and facing Steve. He leant against the bar. His right hand was shaking, just like it did when he was nervous or stressed out and needed a smoke. He stared into Steve's eyes with a piercing gaze, meant to unsettle Steve. Steve shivered and looked down, unmoving.
"Liar. I'm sure you've been secretly dreaming about it. Protecting me until I present so when I do, I'll turn to you. Smart, uh? Admit it!"
He had sworn to himself. Sworn to himself he would never fall into their honeytrap. Yet something in him wanted to fall willingly. As deep as he could.
Having two omegas is a marvelous thing. Every alpha's wet dream. He is one of the lucky ones, he supposes. So few of them are left now. How could he ask for more? He has achieved fulfillment and complete happiness. His life is bliss...
They're both completely high when Tony opens his eyes. He giggles softly and wiggles against Clint, seeking the warmth of his body. He stares at his stubble again, picking up things where he had left them off. His finger traces a line on his jaw and Tony stares at the way his mouth is slightly curled up at the corners and then he stares at his teeth that he can barely see. He's horny, he realizes, and knows he tends to be when he's feeling uneasy. It's a defense mechanism. Getting intoxicated didn't dull the discomfort in his heart. He wonders how it would feel like, comfort sex with Clint. Objectively speaking Clint is hot. In Tony's standards anyway. He wouldn't mind fucking Clint right now. Fuck and forget.
He doesn't deserve two omegas. He doesn't even deserve one and he certainly doesn't deserve their submission. He's a lousy alpha. Not strong enough, not good enough—just not
"What is this about?" Tony asked, eyes fixed on the TV screen. His boyfriend hadn't turned around when he had come down, he kept staring at the screen with an amused fascination. His voice sounded chipper, curious, and something playful seemed to glimmer in his eyes.
"That's just alpha instincts. We're just dance partners." Tony repeated nonchalantly, the same soft smile fading on his face. "And she's a really good one but I wanna dance with my friends."
Their eyes meet. His heart skips again and he remains speechless. Steve is absolutely gorgeous in his three pieces dark blue suits. Everything about him is gorgeous. His broad figure. His handsome face. The infinite blue of his eyes, beautiful and warm like a summer sky. His smile, coy and mischievous at the same time. His square jaw so powerful. His expression so strong and vulnerable. The determination in his eyes.
A surge of admiration swells in his heart. A melancholic twinge. Steve is so very handsome in his three pieces suit, smiling impishly.
Steve tried to settle his heartbeat and steady his voice and then he negotiated with the AI for his entrance to the workshop.
Tony doesn't protest. He's too tired, too depressed to fight him now. He feels a slight shudder shaking him however. His jaw clenches and maybe his nose is flaring a little. He grinds his teeth. His hand is still trembling. It takes a lot of his will power, especially in his current state, not to yank his boyfriend's hand away. Instead he just stands up and leaves the room. He needs some fresh air.
Tony raised his head from his revisions and stared questioningly into Steve's eyes, a lovely pout formed on his lips. He shrugged. "My parents are away for the weekend. I thought it would be more comfortable and we can hang out afterwards. I've got lots of cool things to show you."
His boyfriend didn't answer but he let go of his hands to grab his face and pulled him down for a languorous kiss. "I love you." He whispered huskily in Steve's mouth. Steve melted into his strong embrace and shivered all over. He wrapped his arms around him and snuggled into his neck, seeking his protective warmth. He could feel Tony's heart pounding hard against his.
Natasha jerked her head in his direction, a bit surprised, and her face flustered. She looked away. "It didn't really. It's very recent."
Tony feels a sudden and unexpected pang in his chest. He thinks his smile faded a little and swallows with difficulty. That's not something Tony has ever been ashamed of. He honestly doesn't think there's something wrong with being promiscuous and he's never judged anyone for it. But those words, in Steve's mouth, when he's looking at him like that... they make him feel dirty and something unsettling pools in his stomach.
It might sound as a surprise to you but Tony is actually a bit of a loner, and socially awkward. He has learnt how to be a socialite. He knows his way with people. He knows how to be fun, how to be a good guest, how to be a good host, how to rock a party... but none of this comes naturally to him. It is mostly an act and while he appreciates the company of Steve's friends and doesn't feel the need to pretend with them anymore, to be completely honest, sometimes he'd rather stay in his workshop in the company of his bots. He thinks Steve knows that about him, even if he never said anything, because his boyfriend doesn't insist.
The sun was warm, despite the seasonal cold, and they had blankets and cushions and everything to be comfortable. And there was something dangerously exciting about fucking on the rooftop of Steve's building on a winter Sunday morning. Steve rocked his hips on his boyfriend's crotch to make his intentions clear.
Steve's spot in the private workshop consisted of a comfy couch, a huge caster chair and three different reclining drawing boards. From there he could almost see the entire place, from every angle, and the lighting was perfect even if not natural. He liked this place a lot. It felt comforting and peaceful and almost home, because Tony was there too. He felt at ease down there so he could understand why his boyfriend spent so much time in the workshop, even if only to do some paperwork.
his fault if Tony hasn't bitten either of them. Tony has tried to bond with him for years... It was one rejection too many.
Steve's skin prickled everywhere and heat pooled at the bottom of his stomach. He felt hot, so unusually and inexplicably
"My hands are tied, boy. I have to make this company thrive, and between you and your father's shenanigans, I've got a lot to handle. Now, make it a little easier for me, okay?" He gave Tony a warm and gentle kiss on the lips that almost felt like Tony was loved. Tony gasped and parted his lips when the kiss was over, asking for more. "Be nice to Howard."
The rest of the walls displayed almost the entirety of Steve's career. Original sketches. First covers. Even a few articles... There were figurines too. Although, Steve exaggerated a little, Tony had always been a fanboy and his walls represented that exactly. It wasn't all about him.
Steve's heart made a leap. "Can I kiss you?" Tony blurted, his face a little rosy. There was a spike in his scent, strong and heady and nerve-racking.
Tony's heart was pounding in his chest. So fucking hard. He felt something fluttering in his stomach and he gazed at his boyfriend beatifically and felt the corners of his mouth quirk up into a blissed smile, overwhelmed by a surge of love. MDMA did that sometimes... except he hadn't had any, he thought, was pretty sure even... What the fuck?
"I'm just going out for a smoke on the terrace, I'll be back. I didn't mean to wake you up, I'm sorry, babe... You can go back to sleep."
"Will I be allowed to come down to the workshop with you? I love sketching there. I love watching you when you work."
Tony chuckled amusedly and pinched his lips, looking at Steve with a certain fondness. Steve's heart just leapt again but he just ignored it. His cheeks were burning.
That doesn't mean he doesn't listen to the conversation. You should know Tony is perfectly capable of doing two things at the same time, and he does them very well, per say.
Steve held his stare, a mix of shame and anger roiling inside of him. He pinched his lips to keep his rage inside. "Well if that bothers you so much then, why don't you buy it from them? And do whatever you want with it!"
"It's kind of weird how things happened." Natasha explained. "We never planned this. I never thought..."
"I know." Steve mutters, expression guilty. He looks away, pouting a little. "And I love him too, but I'm in love with
Steve grabbed him by the shoulder and shook him gently. "Come on Tony, get up." His voice was so soft... "Let's go home." He looked sad. He sounded sad too... Tony wondered if that was his fault. He decided it was and hated himself.
Why was Steve not joining him in bed? Why had he come to his rescue if he only wanted to chastise him. Tony just wanted to sleep in his arms and cuddle. They could fight tomorrow... "I was just waiting for you." He said sheepishly.
Steve blushed—although that body reaction was surprising because if there was one thing Steve was not ashamed of, it certainly
Steve doesn't glare at them this time though, obsessed with staring at Loki with eyes filled with wonders—Has Tony already said he hates this guy?—which is  a shame, Tony thinks. He wouldn't admit it but it bothers him a little. He perfectly knows this is not nice but he's always relished in riling Steve up. He loves when Steve is being jealous and possessive. He loves it when his boyfriend is gritting his teeth and clenching his fists whenever someone so much as looks at Tony in a slightly flirty way. It is one of those small bits of happiness Tony grants himself. And he does know this is kind of wrong to do this on purpose but he has never been accused of being a good guy, and Steve is good for both of them anyway...
Steve pretended to pout and then looked up at him with a smile. "I'll have to see for myself, though. I don't trust you." Tony just shrugged and smiled back.
Tony will gladly do it. He's never been good at cooking but if that's what it takes to please his boyfriend, Tony is not above learning a trick or two. After all, it worked with Clint, didn't it? It's always a plus to acquire new skills and it might turn out to be useful, you never know. In fact, there's about nothing Tony wouldn't do to make Steve happy. He just needs to know
"When did that become a thing?" Bucky asked out of breath while gesturing at their joined hands, the surprise still heavy in his voice. Steve shrugged and turned to Tony, he had wanted to take his hand away, maybe because it was too soon, or maybe because he was still unsettled by the whole thing, but Tony squeezed his hand hard, staring defiantly at Steve's friends. "Hi guys!" He said with a confident smile. He was radiating.
"We didn't make out on a daily basis," Steve rectified embarrassedly, heart thumping hard in his chest. "We barely saw each other while you were living with me."
He hadn't told his mum he was going with Sam. No parent would be happy to learn their son was omega. He didn't want her to cry. It was only in Sam's car that he pinned the red rose that Sam had brought for him. He was taking his role very seriously apparently. Steve suddenly felt the urge to laugh hysterically, he repressed it. He didn't want to upset Sam who seemed very eager to make Steve feel like Cinderella on her way to meet her Prince tonight. His mum must have gone overboard with the shovel talk and now the alpha felt, somehow, invested with a mission. That was cute.
Tony chuckled at that and turned around, fully awake now. He nuzzled against Steve and grabbed his head in his two hands. Big brown eyes plunged intently into Steve's eyes. "I really need to pee, now." He repeated, his mocking smile spread wide on his face. "But we have all day..." His voice was hoarse, sensual and full of promises. Enough for Steve to forget about it.
what Bucky wants and even though his fingers are thicker now than they used to be, the omega can take it.
"There's a boy I like." He admitted, feeling light-hearted, the image of Tony so clear in his mind. He was really handsome and smart and Steve wanted to make him happy. He thought about everything that had happened last night. And how he had never seen this coming. Tony had been... He had been so subtle in his approach. Steve had been a massive asshole. "We might have kissed." His mother gave him a gentle, understanding smile, eyes nostalgic. "I've been an asshole to him."
His mum gave him a mischievous smile. "You think I wouldn't recognize the scent of an aroused omega? I've been married to one, remember?" She laughed and ruffled his head tenderly, just like loving mums do. "Be sure to take care of your mate, Steve. Protect him and respect him. Omegas are fragile, no matter how strong they might look."
He looked up, eyes questioning. The gentler tone of his voice startled him. Tony hated gentle. Gentleness confused him. Gentleness sounded like Obie when he was torturing him and humiliating him.
So his boyfriend wasn't all that accepting after all. It wasn't particularly surprising, Tony had probably always known but it still hurt, he just hated himself for hoping. Honestly whatever they had was bound to fail, one way or another, he knew that. Therefore he swallowed his shame, his crushing disappointment and his pain. Steve words hurt, like thousands needles. Steve probably didn't realize it but each one of his biting remarks had struck a particular chord in Tony but never mind, he was used to it. He deserved it.
Tony moaned softly into his ear while Steve kissed his neck. His pants accelerated and with strong and resolute arms, he grabbed Steve's butt, pushing him deeper inside and taking control again. Now he was leading the pace, meeting Steve's thrusts with small jerks of his hips, controlling each of their movement. "Keep going, I'm close." He sighed and threw his head back, arching his back and hissing little choked out breaths.
Tony looked around, eyes filled with wonders. He was smiling and this time it really was innocent. His eyes darted all around the room, marveling at everything, and he made a beeline for Steve's desk, as if he already knew, instinctively, that it was there that Steve worked. Steve's heart clenched. Tony probably did know, because he knew Steve and because he had always been observant and surely he had noticed that even if it wasn't the biggest working area, it was the one with the best lighting. It shouldn't surprise him anymore that Tony knew him so well, but it did and his insides were fluttering at the thought.
An explosion of flavor, fireworks in his chest and butterflies fluttering in his stomach. Steve tiptoed for better leverage and closed his eyes, he could see the entire galaxy. He could touch the stars. It was like flying, like being free for the first time of his life. He trembled in Tony's embrace. The kiss was yet soft and all very chaste but Steve's lost himself completely in it and his hands slid around Tony's neck on their own, grabbing onto him, while Tony's arms curled gently around him, holding him close. It was amazingly soft and gentle and everything Steve ever wanted and more.
Steve comes back with breakfast for himself and for him. Just as every morning he will throw a bowl of organic muesli mixed up with yogurt and fresh fruits in front of Tony and will scowl at him. Tony will pretend he doesn't want it and pout and say he only needs coffee and food is overrated anyway. Steve will cross his arms and stubbornly frown at him until Tony eats the first spoon. Sometimes, he makes his you-need-a-healthier-diet speech, sometimes he just sighs annoyedly.
Number one finally came onto his tongue. The guy brushed his hand down his cheek and looked at him with a disappointed look when Tony pushed him away. He wasn't gonna get all cuddly with Tony, was he?
"Ahem. What should I say then?" Steve joked as they were crossing the corridor. He pushed the door of his bedroom open. Tony stretched his back again and let out a long exhausted sigh.
Tony looks up into his eyes. They're gentle, playful, just as bright as his wide smile. Tony stares fondly at his laugh lines and thinks they're very sexy. And then he stares at his plump bottom lip and wishes Steve would grant him another kiss. He looks up again when he hears his boyfriend chuckle softly and notices Steve's eyes glancing on the left, at his hand. Tony realizes it is up again, still holding a phantom cigarette, with a slight tremor. He feels self-conscious again but doesn't have the time to dwell on it because Steve slips his fingers in his hand and squeezes tight. He grabs his neck with his other hand this time and kisses him again, languorously,
It's Clint on the phone, probably telling him he's going to be late and Steve doesn't need to rush or something like that. Tony isn't sure, he can't hear Clint's voice from where he's standing, only Steve's hums and short answers.
Steve told him about his childhood and his dreams and his friends and Bucky. And they talked like this for a couple of hours, lying in Steve's bed, the sexual tension between them slowly appeasing.
He puts his boots back on and tries to stand straight. He hardly succeeds. He turns to his friend who's still sitting on the bed, reclining on his arms, and grins at him. "You really need to make that bedroom childproof. 'cause
"So..." He started, voice unexpectedly charged. "It was early November. On a Saturday. The weather was really beautiful that day, unusually warm and sunny. I wasn't even wearing a coat. I err... I don't why Steve was working on that day. He wasn't supposed to work on Saturdays—I checked—but he was, and I had never seen him before although I used to go quite often there, with my parents—they insisted." Something sorrowful ran across his eyes but it was gone long before Steve could even try to analyze it. "Gosh, I can't believe how long it's been already." Tony exclaimed and then he continued, voice calm and composed but highly emotional. "And frankly I hated going there, pretending..." His smile faded a little and he swallowed. "I had to, though. I had to play the part... So I did."
Because if Steve did, really, Tony would give him anything, anything he wanted. Tony would chop his dick off if Steve asked him to. He had said that before, hadn't he?
"What are you doing? We were starting to get worried." Sam asked with a concerned frown on his face.
or taken advantage of by other alphas... Having heats again means the end of his freedom. "If we both get off our suppressants, you do realize that our cycle will synchronize? We'll have our heats at the same time!" Bucky doesn't seem to see things that way though... Maybe because he's got nothing to lose.
Tony shrugged and smiled reassuringly. "We're just different, Steve." He said after a moment of heavy silence. "The way I love you is different from the way you love me. I'm just saying that...you're
Why was he mad? He wanted him to tell the truth and when Tony told him the truth he got even madder. Tony shuddered all over and squeezed his arms around his knees. He stared at his boyfriend, bewildered, helpless, lost for words. What could say now? What did Steve want from him? No matter what he did or said he would keep losing this argument.
Steve hummed in response. They had dated for three years before Steve moved in with his boyfriend. Even four if you counted that one year they were dating without knowing they were. All these years they had spent most of their time together in Steve's place and yet it didn't feel home like the penthouse did. Steve cherished those memories but he wasn't particularly attached to this place. It was just a place, like any other. A place he had been sleeping and eating at, chilling out and fucking at times but nothing more.
The stench infuses and pervades. The tension is palpable and infuriating. She can't stand it anymore, it's driving her crazy. She can't even touch them. Their scent is marked and owned, besides she never wanted to touch either them anyway. She just wants her peace and quiet. She wasn't supposed to want. She wasn't supposed to
He steps inside, silently, mentally preparing himself for this. When he is finally inside, he isn't submerged by the cloud of omega scents, for once. The atmosphere is rather peaceful in fact, like a warm and welcoming home.
Steve shook his head. "That's not what I wanted to say anyway..." He started, looking down, avoiding Tony's hot gaze on him. "What I mean is...You didn't have to apologize, Tony. You didn't do anything wrong. I was just... I just... It started and I freaked out but you were amazing last night and I'm the one who's sorry for not realizing sooner. I mean... I would have loved being your date at that dance. I never thought... I always thought you were out my league and I just... I couldn't see and you were so subtle and amazing and... And I'm sorry I've been a jerk. To you and... And I hope you can forgive me."
The anger Steve had felt fluttered away, letting the sense of happiness Steve had been feeling ever since he had woken up this morning settle in his guts. He smiled back and they stared at each other silently, both smiling affectionately, both looking happy in the morning light and the fresh winter breeze.
slowly—twenty-five minutes to be precise—and ignoring the pain in his chest scorching his lungs at each hissing breath he took, as well as the throbbing in his head.
Steve notices, because he drops the attitude and his smile grows worried. He brings a soft thumb to Tony's face and brushes it softly against his cheek, wishing Tony's anxious thoughts away. It works a little. "I'm sorry, Tony. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that..." He plunges his baby blues in Tony's eyes, intent and determined, and licks his lips hesitatingly. Tony's a little bewildered. "I love you and... I don't care about anything else.  You're the only one who really matters to me."
Clint nudges him in the ribs. "Why the long face?" He has taken a beer that he drinks straight from the bottle and leans against the kitchen counter next to him, taking a break from cooking for everyone.
"And then there was that first concert..." Bucky said softly, still staring into his husband's eyes like he was his whole world.
He walked through the crowd with an insecure pace, ignoring everyone around him. He ducked and made a beeline for his locker. So annoying. The students' curious stares were penetrating and he felt naked. He accelerated, trying to hide the annoying blush he felt creeping up his neck, probably already coloring his cheeks. Being alpha didn't prevent him from being shy and easily embarrassed unfortunately.
Obie came nearer and brushed his fingers along his jawline, making him shiver with mixed feelings. "I'm sorry I have been neglecting you lately. I'm gonna change that."
"I knew it!" Steve exclaimed, falsely bitter. "This was all part of your grand scheme to make me surrender and change my mind about it." He might sound a little wary but he was more amused than anything else.
On the ride home, Tony pressed himself against Steve, as strong as he could, blanketing him with every part of his body that he could touch him with, but he could still feel the distance that kept pulling them apart. He could still feel his heart race with anxiety. He could still feel the uneasiness grow in his heart, festering in his chest. For the first time, Steve's presence wasn't comforting so he was glad he was still drunk, and high, and that the roaring of the engine lulled him into sleep at some point. But when he woke up again, it felt even worse.
Steve looked up at him. He looked ecstatic, eyes glimmering in the dark of the evening, the fresh Spring breeze on his face, his lips slightly shivering. He was still nervous.
Tony interrupted him with a hot and languorous kiss Steve lost himself into. The heat pooled in his stomach again and he was rock-hard against Tony's thighs. "Is this alright?" He whispered, voice so flirty and sensual, breath brushing Steve's skin. Hot and tickling.
Tony was still snuggling against him, eyes closed. "No, we weren't." He admitted resignedly. He was still smiling though, expression amused and slightly bitter at the same time. "Apparently." He sighed. "I wish I'd gotten the clue earlier, though."
It takes him a moment to realize what was the comforting weight on chest but slowly and surely he takes in his surroundings and recognizes the fast beating of a small heart, sound asleep, and lulled by the humming of the arc reactor. Felicia is asleep into his arms. Her small head resting on his chest, safe and loved and protected.
"And it's not even about us, Steve," Tony added. "I mean, I don't think you ever realized the impact you have on other people... I mean, how many guys did you turn down, really, thinking you weren't enough or some bullshit like that? I feel so lucky I was able to stand out."
In another life maybe Tony will be able to love Steve the way he deserves to be loved. For now he's just waiting for the moment Steve leaves again and never comes back. Tony isn't sure he will be able to survive this time. Yet, he says that every time and so far, he has survived. He probably will die again and resuscitate when Steve comes back, again. Tony must be a cat, endowed with nine miserable lives. Hopefully he's living his ninth one now.
He ran to the bathroom as soon as he got in, stripped in no time and didn't wait for the water to run hot to jump into the small shower. He let it ran down his sore limbs, thinking it would make him feel better. It didn't. Nothing did. The warmish water wasn't relaxing like it should be, it wasn't cleansing. Nothing could. He scrubbed and scrubbed with the roughest washcloth he found but the stench wouldn't go away, neither would the sickness. How could it? It came from inside, from his rotting and perverted soul. If he ever had one... He kept rubbing desperately until he gave up and broke down, leaning his head against the tiled wall, helpless. He wished he could cry. He wanted to cry so much. Instead he started hyperventilating, heart racing in panic and pounding hard in his chest. His body hurt so much. Every part hurt.
Steve put a strict finger on his lips and straightened up sternly. "No!" He exclaimed curtly. "You have a job to do, now. Remember? Job first. Reward later."
His mum remained silent. She just instinctively put her hand on his forehead to check his temperature but it had gone down, Steve had checked.
Tony stares at Steve again and swallows down the rest of his drink. Steve has now a hand on Loki's knee and the other on Bucky's and smiles at his best friend with his innocent, oblivious face. Tony never thought he would ever hate Steve's obliviousness. It was supposed to be cute. He cringes, puts his empty glass on the counter and keeps gazing at his boyfriend, a little too intensely maybe.
"We were just fooling around. Just a one time thing that meant nothing." Except it was Steve's first kiss and it had happened with his friend. Someone he trusted deeply but not someone he was interested in romantically.
Tony could see the anger flashing through his eyes. He could see his face redden—it might have been cute, in other circumstances, but not tonight—his jaw clenched. Tony could see a whole range of expressions on his face. Shock, consternation, rage, disgust...
Tony smiled and leant into him. He kissed Steve one last time. "Let's go." He muttered against his lips. "We're gonna be late." Steve curled his arms one last time around him and breathed him in, stealing a whiff of his scent. Tony smelt like expensive cologne and metal, scent undetermined with a hint of omega lingering. That is, if you really paid attention.
it. So you can call me out on my shit. You can rebuke me for not telling you about Pepper, or carrying things on with Obie, or for acting shitty and selfish all the time." He paused, eyes intent on him. "But
Steve was the one keeping some distance. He was observing everyone interacting. It felt necessary to keep away and stay in the background, necessary to understand what went wrong, what he had missed. He imagined that was what Bucky had done when he first arrived here and the thought made his heart clench.
Tony shrugged, smile undying on his lips. "I always feel ecstatic about what's going on in Steve's mind."
you." He said, feeling less and less confident about this stated fact by the minute. "I just called you to clarify things and..." Steve hesitated, feeling a lump in his throat. "
Steve bites his lip to repress a moan when Bucky's hands are back on his belly and he nips at his neck. He licks the fresh wound afterward, sending another spike of want throughout Steve's body.
"Two months ago, I think." Tony wasn't new to this. He had already been tested positive for a bunch of STDs in his short life. He even got syphilis once. A bummer. Tony felt obliged to give her the list of what he remembered. He told her about being on PrEP too. Might be useful.
Steve's lips are still wet and his hair is dripping from the shower. The wetness remains on Tony's cheek, one drop of water trickles down his neck. Tony hesitates before wiping it off, partly annoyed by the unpleasant feeling, partly excited because it was Steve who left it there. The excitement is boiling inside. Tony feels blissed and ecstatic still, at all these short moments that have become part of their routine now. He's still feeling amazed.
The rest of it was kinda of blurry in Tony's head. He had absences and struggled to remember. Nothing he wasn't used to. Not remembering generally meant great things happened. He did know he had been dancing. He knew that a bunch of guys had touched him with grabby hands. He thought he did the same. He was pretty sure he made out with a cute guy, maybe two, that seemed to be more or less his age, rare enough to be mentioned. He thought he jerked one of them off on the dance floor and was fairly confident the other returned the favor, only because he had come in his pants and hoped someone had helped. He could count it as one, couldn't he? Tony probably tasted him on his fingers afterwards anyway. Seven down, sixteen more.
And lost himself in the profound darkness of his eyes. "Yeah, I know." He finally said, feeling a pang in his chest at Tony's disappointed face. "I don't know why I said that."
It's weird but Tony does know, although he doesn't understand. His own heart feels dried up. He doesn't think he will ever be able to care fo a kid, for someone other than Steve, period.
Steve had a few chitchats in between flutes of champagne. He looked at Tony from time to time, trying to ignore the little pangs of jealousy he felt every time he gave a slightly insistent smile or a flirtatious pat or when he sexily threw his head back when he laughed. It was all part of his bold and charming public persona—that Steve hated—and he had forced himself to accept it. He particularly hated when Tony showed himself to be demonstratively seductive with women, invading their personal space, sliding a powerful hand on their slender waists or whispering in their ears. Steve knew his purpose was to make them spend more money. Women were generally more likely to be generous than their husbands. Still, the fact remained that Tony
He still looks at them from afar, leaving the door of his room slightly ajar so he can see if his plan works or not. His departure changed the dynamic between them and it's become more tender. The alpha is holding back, trying to enjoy the omega a little longer. He runs gentle fingers through his hair, tugging hard on it from time to time, to remind him who's the alpha and who's the omega, and incidentally because Steve loves it. And Steve returns the sentiment, swallowing the alpha's cock eagerly to the hilt.
Tony is so handsome above him, so focused and careful and his face is flushed with pleasure. It feels amazing to have him. It is fulfilling in a way Steve has never imagined. He lets everything go and abandons himself. His boyfriend is a fantastic lover, he thinks, before his mind goes blank.
"Alpha..." Bucky slurs. "You're supposed to take care of us. You're supposed to make sure we're healthy, happy and protected. You can't take that away from us. I want to share my heats with you and Steve does too." Tony's mouth hangs open and his eyes are open wide, fixed in the air. He had probably never considered things from that angle. Bucky feels a bit smug right now.
Steve took another deep breath, praying for his lungs to hold up, and started running, as fast as he could. He took unexpected turns, in order to lose them but he could still hear their voices far away. They were shouting. Steve felt the sudden need to cry. Like, why? Why did he have to endure all of this?
Steve had a moment then. He stared at his tall silhouette and remembered when they shared this apartment, as flatmates, during those few weeks. His boyfriend was in a really bad place then, he had known it and yet, somehow, his heart had been too cold for him to care at the time. Not strong enough. He blessed him for being so strong for them both and resisted the urge to wrap his arms around him and cuddle him. They had lost enough time already.
A short instant that lasted an eternity. Steve ignored the racing of his heart and the heat pooling inside. He didn't want this.
Steve didn't say anything but he felt his cheeks suddenly burn with shame and looked away. For a long time Bucky had been
They both left their breakfast untouched and walked to the bathroom holding hands, led by the ecstatic energy of Steve. Once inside, he made a quick job of getting rid of his pajamas, before Tony could even comprehend what was happening, and laid his hands on his boyfriend, touching him as much as Tony let him. The latter shivered and looked uncomfortable but Steve had a point to make and he slipped his fingers underneath his T-shirt and pulled it up. He planted soft kisses on his chest and Tony let him, then slipped his thumbs under the brim of his shorts, arms surrounding him, and pulled them down softly, brushing them on his half-hard cock.
"Yeah, yeah, no worries. I wasn't going to anyway... " Steve says. Then he pauses and laughs and Tony can even hear the smile in his voice when Steve hums again, even though he's turning his back to his boyfriend and hasn't looked up from his blueprints once. "I'll see you in a bit." Steve finally says while pinching, or maybe licking, his lips. "It's great that Loki's back. It's been a while. Looking forward to see him."
Steve wasn't exactly sure what he meant exactly by "everything you're going through right now," so much was going on in his life currently but he made an educated guess. He just shrugged.
Steve exclaimed indignantly but couldn't truthfully find it in his heart to be really angry at him right now. "I can't believe you'd use that to get into my pants."
"I saw you rushing out with a crestfallen face." Tony answered nonchalantly. "I thought you might need a friend."
Jane's expression softened. "Well, there was this party..." She started, voice faltering. "Darcy got smashed and started messing around, looking for trouble. I really appreciated how Thor reacted then and what he did. I started to see him in a new light from then on. And I guess, I became more receptive then." She added enigmatically, then she stared down at Thor, a beaming smile on her face, and squeezed his shoulder before sitting down next to him to give him a soft kiss.
He really didn't want to but he lowered his head anyway, instinctively. One couldn't stand up to Howard for that long and not fear the worst. "You don't need me there to sign the contract. You know enough of the project to present it yourself. I can meet with them another time if that's so important to you."
"You look like I'm taking you to a slaughterhouse..." Tony explained, tone playful. "I can drop you off at the next bar if you'd rather..."
Tony let escape an embarrassed laugh. "With my experience? I know I have a reputation but—" He stopped and the smile faded from his lips. His eyes were shining with something desperate and hurt, and anger. "I thought, you of all people, would understand." Steve's heart clenched. He didn't know what he had done to hurt Tony, but he had hurt Tony and he hated that and he hated himself for that. "Stereotypes do die hard, I guess." He sighed and looked at Steve sidelong.
, dad." Tony shouted and he sounded a little too much like he was asking for permission. "I've made them
, when we fuck each other to oblivion that I feel free. The rest of the time I'm just running away from who I am. This is not freedom. It's my own self-made jail."
A cartoon Iron Man sulking and tapping his foot on the floor energetically and a cartoon Captain America on his knees, hands in a prayer, imploring him with large droopy eyes and a balloon reading: "Sorry."
Steve had taken his filthy clothes away and put some clean ones on a small stool while he showered, so he dried off, put them on and caught a glimpse of his bruises in the mirror. His neck was purple already. He had a few discreet ones on his face too, his lip was cut. He thought he deserved more, whoever did that to him had been too lenient.
His boyfriend was leaning on the walls and looked at him sidelong, eyes flickering from him to the glass panes and to him again, both anxious and shy despite the undying smile on his face. At times, a glimpse of carnal lust just flashed in his dark eyes.
slick flowing out of him. The alpha runs a tender hand into his sweaty sticky hair and snuggles against him. "You sure?" He whispers in Steve's ear. "You really sure about this?"
The alpha is buried deep inside the omega, standing on his knees behind him. Steve is chest down on the mattress, shaking still, goosebumps all over his skin. Tony is caressing his back slowly, reassuringly. His eyes are still feral and his musky scent spikes up when he senses Bucky's presence. Steve's spasms slow down gradually and he leisurely comes back to his senses while Bucky is about to lose his own mind.
Steve shrugged it off and started taking his stuff out diligently. He was already late, no need to make another fuss. Sam pouted disapprovingly but didn't push further. Both of them ended their unspoken conversation before the magical eye of their passive-agressive English teacher told them off with an oppressive silence and they opened their books.
He pounded hard and deep, harder and deeper than ever, at a fast, punishing rhythm, making a point, and soon Steve forgot about his earlier disappointment. His cock rock hard and dripping against the inside of his thigh, his cries and moans muffled into the sheets, he got what he asked for. He was on the edge again. Tony slowed down then and fucked deep and lovingly into him, making sure he grazed his soft spot at every thrust. Steve felt the spikes of pleasure from his ass to his cock and to his brain. His entire body shuddered with overwhelming pleasure. He finally cried out and came undone, spilling himself onto the bed, untouched. Tony fucked him through orgasm until Steve's body stopped spasming and just when it started feeling uncomfortable, he pulled out.
The reaction was immediate. Tony jerked in surprise, body trembling all over. He was propped up on his arms again and sucked in a sharp painful breath, half a whine, half a hiss. He hunched his back and started panting heavily, letting out little wheezing noise and cringing with pain.
Steve sniffled, trying to calm himself down and answer but he was too shaken up to control anything anymore. He felt his entire body shudder and broke down. It was ugly and Tony put his cigarette away and walked to him. He put a comforting hand on his shoulder and the sole presence of him beside him was already relieving. Steve could feel his warmth now and felt already better.
Steve put the cup of coffee on the side table and sank into the huge comfy couch that took over half of their lounge area. Knees bent and bare feet on the edge, he took his laptop and opened it again, decided to do this once and for all.
Tony's mellow heat was overwhelming and each of Steve's thrusts was making wet sounds. This time Tony tensed and groaned in pleasure and he was pliant under him. Head buried in the sheets to muffle his shameless moans. He felt the warmth of tingling pleasure pool in his lower belly. He's was about to shoot again and he shall not make the same mistake this time. He slowed down and blanketed his boyfriend, leaving a trail of wet kisses on his back. He bit his shoulder blade while they were both rocking together and let his hand wander along his flank. He made sure each of his thrusts aimed right on his soft spot and grabbed his dick. "You so fucking beautiful, baby. Come for me." He gave a few strokes and felt Tony's body tense and shiver, clenching around him.
Steve spooned him and kissed his back and shoulders. "You're the best thing that ever happened to me," he whispered to his ear while humming contentedly against the warm skin of his back.
They kept fucking after that. Not like before. Not everyday. More like, whenever it became too hard to be constantly around Tony without being able to get it from him. Sometimes because it simply felt good and comforting, sometimes because Bucky was pretty and his smile gave Steve warm and fuzzy feelings.
Steve smiled mischievously. "I don't get paid." He whispered and gestured him to come inside the restrooms. Johann followed—the fool—and pressed Steve against the wall. Steve stared up at him lewdly and grabbed his crotch, and he squeezed, as hard as he could, enjoying Schmidt's distorted face changing colors as he pressed harder.
"I think I've hated you as soon as you came in." Bucky said, without being mean about it. "Everything about you, really. From your inadequate outfit to your high-pitched voice. You're were so fucking brash and
A shudder ran through him and he pushed his hands down his pocket to steady himself. "That's because we haven't found the right place, yet..."
Tony would love a drink, although he's already feeling properly buzzed. That's not what he needs though. Among the long list of Tony's addictions, alcohol is probably the most manageable, stopping has never really been a problem and he can live without it, he thinks. He stares at his boyfriend who looks like he couldn't care less about what Tony's been up to. He ignores the pang in his chest and appreciates that his mind feels already numb. A drink sounds like a nice option right now.
He was still frozen as Obie's impressive built came closer. He was trapped and his heart started racing. His breathing accelerated and in a moment of weakness, despite himself, he looked at the man pleadingly, silently begging him to let him go. He didn't want this to happen, he realized. No matter how responsive his body was to the man. He
His boyfriend slumped on the couch, Steve climbed onto his lap with an effusive energy and straddled him dominantly, and before the former could emit any kind of protest, he grabbed his hair and pulled his head backward while putting a firm finger on his objecting lips. "Shhhhhhhush." He whispered assertively, frowning down at him. "You need to stop doing that now."
it. The omega scent is joyful, appeased and full of hope, filled with unconditional love and unabashed lust. How can Steve still want him?
completely stoned and humping each other right now, it's totally fine. Tony knows exactly what to do. Even if he, himself, is also pretty out of it. Flying to Lalaland, floating on a raft somewhere—or rather gushing—downwards a flooding river or waterfalls, in a whirlwind of omega pheromones.
He stopped, realizing what he was about to say. "Please, stop trying to sugarcoat everything that happened between us. This isn't—this isn't..."
"The way you feel though, doesn't depend on your biology," Sam said understandingly, trying to be open-minded, "you can have a crush on a person, without immediately wanting to jump in the sacks." Steve had no idea what he was talking about. "Even if you're still unsure about yourself, you can still like someone."
The guy strode toward them keeping eye contact with Tony. Tony's eyes were too unfocused to do the same however. He closed them at some point and opened them wide when he felt the guy's hand clutch his neck and press his head against the wall. He gasped and his dick twitched, making the guy who was sucking him off moan. The guy chuckled, face very close to Tony's. He was dark-haired, in his late thirties probably. His smile was a little too dangerous.
"Back then you would have died rather than share you heat with an alpha." Steve scoffed in attempt to soothe the tension in the atmosphere. It didn't work.
If only they knew, that the only male omega at school was actually Tony Stark. Steve internally laughed thinking about it but quickly forgot the feeling as the he felt the burning stares on him. It was like being Mose when he parted the sea. The students moved away to let him through the crowd. Silence all around him as he marched along the corridor, conquering. Everyone quiet but some amazed whisperings. He was

good to be back. He even wondered why he hadn't come back sooner but the distance, the separation and, most of all, time had been a necessary thing he supposes.
Steve gives him more, mouth still going up and down his shaft, he pushes a fourth finger and can reach further inside him. He splays them, rolls them inside, brushes the wall with the softest touches. It's not enough and Steve
He's not as immature as to actually go sulking at the end of the couch but almost. He just half-listens to the conversations while sipping his third drink and tries not to stare too much at his boyfriend. He doesn't particularly want to look creepy and he's got the feeling that he's on the verge of it. So when Clint leaves again to fetch more food, Tony follows him to the kitchen. One because he needs another drink and two because he just wants to escape this conversation. Steve and him should host dinner parties more often, he just thinks, this way when he feels like fleeing again he could just sneak out to his workshop.
Tony led him to his bed and lay him down on it before lying next to him, snuggling against him. "Don't bite me, okay?" He asked, a little worriedly. It sounded more than a warning than a request though.
He started running as soon as he got off the bus. He knew very well he shouldn't but part of him wanted to give the finger to his fucking health and just live his life like any other senior high-school student, well almost like any other senior high-school student. Well, at least live some kind of a life.
you to be perfect... because I'm obviously not." Steve's eyes are intense on him and he pinches his lips, expression turning suddenly serious. "Just..." He averts his eyes, perhaps to hide the concern in them. "Don't replace one addiction with another, please. I know you..."
Tony threw a glance at her from the corner of his eye and stared back at Steve. "She's just my dance partner, Steve, not my girlfriend. She doesn't own me."
They should fuck. Everything is fine when they fuck. And Tony looked so handsome this morning, so manly, ready to catch Steve every time he screwed up and fell.
Steve scrutinized him and remembered suddenly that Tony Stark was two years younger than the rest of the seniors. Somehow, at that moment, he
"Yeah, like ninety nine percent of the students in our school." Steve shouted, abruptly raising his head and throwing his hands in the air. "There's only those two cavemen who think it's cool to flaunt their alphaness around like some winning prize." He grumbled while gesturing at Sam and Bucky who guffawed and  high-fived.
Tony finally pulls away and stares down into Steve's eyes. A glint of lust and vulnerability is pooling in them but a huge grin is spread across his face. "Hi!" He husks out, titling his head on the side. His eyes are big, shining bright with joy and eagerness.
Once outside Tony took a deep, refreshing breath. He almost smiled at the semblance of freedom he felt at this instant. He took a cigarette and the first puff went straight to his head, relaxing him a little. The excitement started fluttering in his chest again. It wasn't even ten p.m. Maybe he could still make it to Steve's party. The sudden sliver of hope rushed to his head and he left lightheaded for a moment. He fumbled with his phone. Should he text? Should he call first? Should he try to surprise him? It wasn't even that far. Maybe Happy could drop him there discreetly.
Tony abruptly turned his head back and glared at Steve, baffled. "Is that all that matters to you right now? Whether I'm gonna smoke that fucking cigarette or not?" He snapped.
He was just wearing his shirt and trousers when he went to the bar and fetched another bottle of brandy and a glass. Steve walked carefully to him but remained at a reasonable distance. "Are you alright, babe?"
Pepper let out another long sigh. "I don't know, sweetheart." She whispered in her sweetest voice. "Just go naked if you want and see if I care. It's not like you ever asked my opinion on how to dress every time you went to fuck him behind my back, right? I'm certain you can figure this one out yourself. Enjoy your date."
He hovered his fingers over his hole, he could feel the cum and the blood slip out of him and felt his bile rush up his throat. He felt Obie's pervy, disgusting hands on him again, he grabbed the invisible shackle around his neck. Even now he could still feel it, unbreakable, inescapable. Nothing could take the filth off of him. It was ingrained in himself. Being Obie's bitch was all he was good for, everything he deserved. He didn't deserve Steve.
He can feel his boyfriend's silent presence behind him.The latter skirts around him and his long and thin fingers skim softly the cotton of his shirt, drawing four lines—four burning trails—on his back, from one shoulder to the other.
Tony laughed again, startled by the unexpected question. He sounded both a little amused and a little bitter. "Isn't that the kind of things my boyfriend should already know about me after three years?" He stared at Steve, eyes challenging, and with the same soft and loving smile and spoke with so much gentleness. "I'm still going." He finally answered, without waiting for Steve's reaction. "One hour. Twice a month."
There's nothing alpha about him. There's nothing people think an alpha is supposed to be like about him, at least. That's fine with him. Very fine. He wants to major in literature next year anyway, he has nothing to prove. Very few alphas choose this path. No-one is going to look twice at him. He has changed his mind about a lot of things though, and has been thinking a lot. He's been starting to get interested in gender-related issues, go to meetings, support the omega liberation cause. He will have to admit that it has a little to do about him but a lot to do with Tony, however. Tony has been secretly going to those meetings since he has been allowed to leave his house. Happy and Jarvis are in the know and support him entirely, he's lucky to have them. His parents are way too traditional for someone like Tony. He doesn't fit in their mindset, sadly. Steve's mum has been very supportive however, of every choice he has recently made. Of
"I'm sure." Steve replied determinedly. "I'm fine. I'm not a fucking virgin, Tony. I can take it." Yes, last night had hurt a little but Steve was being fucked regularly enough that the little amount of spit had been enough for him not to hurt afterward. He wasn't even sore. He wrapped his arms even tighter around his neck and kissed him on the mouth. "And I have a very specific idea of how I want you to fuck me."
"And yet it seems your couple is only getting stronger? What's the next step? Are you gonna get marr—"
Tony chuckled and turned his head back to meet his gaze then dropped his upper body on mattress. "Let's consider that, on the premise that I've done pretty much everything you can do sexually without permanent body-modification, you should just assume that I have."
Tony felt a pang in his chest, a shiver ran down his spine. He was suddenly terrified and confused. This was not Steve. Steve wasn't like that and for a few second Tony instinctively grabbed his boyfriend's wrist in a futile attempt at protecting himself from him. Why would he do something like that though? It had never worked before, had it?
Bucky feels the desire shoot up his spine, making him feel dizzy. He tightens his embrace around the alpha. "Yeah?" He asks in a soft whisper tickling his ear.
Tony cringed in outrage. "You know I'll never do that. I couldn't do that. I'd find something for you. I—I'll never let you down." Tony's hands grabbed his and squeezed tight. "I'll always be there for you, no matter what happens between us."
Tony complies sheepishly and his hazy gaze turns to Loki. Their eyes lock into each other. Loki is smirking and takes a swig of his drink. His eyes are glimmering with something mischievous. He says something that sounds like he's congratulating them. Tony doesn't remember why he hates him. He observes him. He doesn't even know this guy in fact. He just knows he's supposed to hate him. Maybe he should try to get to know him. Yeah, that's probably what he should do and mostly, he should increase the distance between him and Steve.
