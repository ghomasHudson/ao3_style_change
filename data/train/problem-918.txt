“I know… I didn’t expect things to change overnight. I’ll talk to him when we get home about the possibility of a short holiday. Maybe he just needs a change of scenery.”
“I always knew you were a remarkable man, Mr Holmes, but I never knew how remarkable and unique that brain of yours was. I wish all my patients had the ability to delete information they found distasteful or upsetting.”
“Well, I remember there being cultists and something about an idol they were worshipping, but that’s about all.”
I get up slowly and retrieve my laptop. The story needs to be told; the world needs to be warned before it’s too late. For there is no doubt in my mind that the island the Japanese freighter stumbled upon is none other than accursed R’lyeh.
“Yes, bees collect pollen from flowers and turn it into honey. They also make wax and Queen’s jelly. It’s all chemistry, John. And don’t get me started on the complex organization of the colony itself.”
“Alright, dammit. The things I do for the bloody Holmes family.” Greg goes to a file cabinet, pulls out several sheets of paper, then hands them to me. “Fill these out. We have to make it official.”
Sherlock could be dead in that time, so I take off towards the service entrance we used the last time we were here; the door’s unlocked. I take a deep breath, switch on the torch and step inside.
“Both locations are on the same longitude, and they’re both tied to the Thames – Caird and Rayner via the Limehouse Cut, and Convoys Wharf directly. We need to finish our research on Cthulhu. Once we do I’m sure we’ll have a clearer picture.”
Sherlock’s breathing evens out, and it isn’t long before he’s asleep. I pull the blanket from the back of the sofa and cover him, then turn on the TV, mute it, and spend the next few hours half watching crap telly.
Well, that's it. Technically, this is my first piece of Sherlock fanfiction, although I've been writing for years in other fandoms. There were times I had to literally drag the words out of Sherlock and John, but we made it to the end eventually.
Detective Sergeant Sally Donovan is waiting with Lestrade at the main gate. She acknowledges us with a nod as we approach, but thankfully no snide comments are directed towards Sherlock. Her entire demeanor around him has changed ever since his return from the dead. Personally, I think she feels guilty about what she and Anderson did. I’m grateful she doesn’t accompany us inside.
I must have dosed off while reading because the next thing I know it’s mid-morning. Sherlock’s covered me with a blanket; he’s sitting at the desk poring over more of Professor Abernathy’s documents.
“Um… I’m testing the soil from the garden. It can’t be too acidic or too basic. The balance has to be just right. Again… chemistry. I was also thinking of installing a bin behind the house so we could make our own vermicompost. We would just need to invest in the purchase of several varieties of earthworm.
I take a cab back home after filing the paperwork on Sherlock. Mrs Hudson comes up a few minutes later. She’s carrying a tray with tea and biscuits. I take it from her and set it on the table next to my chair.
“I’m sorry, John. That was insensitive of me. The only reason you stayed awake as long as you did was to ensure my safety. It couldn’t have been comfortable sleeping in that chair. Do you need a massage?”
The music is slow and sad and beautiful, and I’m just so damned glad he’s home that I start to cry. Sherlock puts down the instrument and gathers me in his arms.
Skip the section after Sherlock and John give their statements if you feel this would upset you. The rest of this chapter should be okay after that.
The elder Holmes glances at the map before settling in Sherlock’s chair. “I thought I’d save you some time. As it turns out, Professor Abernathy has made the study of Cthulhu his life’s work. He’s graciously agreed to allow you access to his research.” He indicates the boxes. “There are 52 in total – each labeled as to content. Gregory will be by after work with the case file from the Caird and Rayner murders.” He hands Sherlock a manila folder. “And here’s everything we have on the Convoys site. You’re welcome.”
Motion in my peripheral vision makes me turn, but it’s just Sherlock. He slowly backs away from the statue, hands pressed to his temples, torch discarded at his feet. His lips move, but there’s no sound emanating from them.
The blanket is tossed over Sherlock’s chair and I get up… or rather, I attempt to get up. It takes a couple tries. I’ve got a stiff neck and my back muscles are screaming. Ah, the joys of growing old.
Wiggins has managed to gather quite a number of Sherlock’s Homeless Network. “I spread the word, just like you asked Dr Watson. When folks heard that Sherlock was missing, everyone wanted to help.”
Sherlock calls ahead and notifies the caretakers, James and Margaret Hastings, when we will be arriving, and they meet us at the cottage. Cottage… when Sherlock told me he owned a cottage, I was thinking of a single level residence with a couple of rooms, much like his parent’s home. But, no, it’s a beautiful two storey brick dwelling on five acres of land – including a burbling brook – with an absolutely gorgeous garden filled with flowers and flowering plants. It looks like something that should be featured on the cover of an architectural magazine, or
He goes on to explain about what we found in the warehouse and the psychic attack made on him. Dr Simondson and Professor Abernathy listen intently. When Sherlock finishes, both men are visibly shaken.
Sherlock isn’t sure we’ll be returning to the cottage, so he advises the Hastings’ of our departure plans.
“That’s not the point. I just don’t like either of you boys getting hurt. I worry about you two, always running around chasing criminals and such.”
“Bones… stacked in piles at odd angles, just like at Convoys Wharf, and the MI6 team’s equipment next to them, but no sign of the men or of Sherlock.“
I look at the man lying in the bed. Sherlock is wide awake and staring at me. I can’t decide if I want to hug him or smack him for being an arse.
We come upon a wall that’s had a large hole blown in it. As we step through, I reach out and grab it for balance – my hand comes away wet.
Directly in front of us is a monolith, at least 30 metres high, carved from some black stone. I don’t know if I can accurately describe the horror sculpted into that cyclopean monument. It’s a being – a representation of something from out of a nightmare – vaguely humanoid in shape with a head like an octopus, and tentacle-like appendages extending from the facial area. The body is scaly, positioned in a squat. Gigantic claws decorate both hands and feet, and long, narrow wings jut from the creature’s back.
“As ever John, you see, but do not observe.” Sherlock rolls over to face me and takes my hand. “If you did, you’d know that I love you too.”
Sherlock starts to sob and that’s when I go to him and wrap him tightly in my arms. Neither one of us says anything for a long time. Finally Sherlock pulls away and kisses my forehead.
to be disturbed under any circumstances – Sherlock and I fortify ourselves with sandwiches and tea, while the elder Holmes brother makes several phone calls.
when I heard the voice – a voice not of this world! All I wanted to do was run away and scream in terror, but I could do neither. The words, John. It wanted me to say the words, and I
His voice is otherworldly; deeper than his normal baritone. He reaches up and caresses my cheek, careful of the injury.
Sherlock leans forward, elbows on knees. “There was a presence, John… I know what that sounds like, but hear me out. It started when we entered the chamber – a soft buzzing sound – but more than that. I could
I slide to the floor and gather Sherlock in my arms. There’s a slight tremor running through his body. He doesn’t frighten easily, so whatever he experienced in that place must truly have been horrifying.
We begin to fall into a daily routine: wake up, shower (separately), breakfast, Sherlock checks the hives (and extracts honey when necessary), while I clean up and read the papers, then a walk into town (if we need supplies), or just around the property. Sherlock and I even work in the garden together (his excuse is that the flowers are important for the production of honey).
Both men, I learn later, are in their early 50’s. But if someone were to ask me to guess their ages, I would have said that Professor Abernathy is much older. His face is lined with wrinkles, shoulders stooped, and he leans heavily on a cane. His hair is pure white, but his green eyes are alert – darting here and there – never settling on one thing for too long. It’s he who begins the questioning.
“No buts, Greg. Scotland Yard was removed from the murder investigation at Caird and Rayner. This is a separate case, although the perpetrators may be one and the same. Work with me here, please.”
“I’ve gotten you some things that should last a few days, but you’ll need to do shopping. And I’ve started a fire and aired the place out a bit.” She looks us over with a critical eye before wrapping us both in a hug. “It’s so good to have my boys back. Now go upstairs before I start crying.”
Sherlock holds out his right hand, palm up, and one of the cultists places an ornate dagger in it. It’s already been used, judging by the dried blood on the blade. He raises it above his head and cries out something in that strange language, then slashes the blade across the kneeling cultist’s throat. Arterial blood sprays across Sherlock’s torso and onto the ground.
The warehouse is immense, and not just in height. You could fit a rugby field in the main building, and still have room for spectators. We pass through another door at, what I think is, the rear of the building. I glance at my watch. It’s just past ten in the morning, but the warehouse is already heavily shadowed. Inspector Lestrade gives Sherlock and I each a torch, which we immediately click on.
“Aye, Captain!” she exclaimed, way too peppy for this early in the morning. Turning towards John, she noticed Greg standing next to him. Her confident demeanor faltered a bit, and she gave him a shy smile before facing John. “Come on, John. I’ll show around,” she said with a cheery smile and led him off.
She pulled her hands away, shaking her head weakly. “That was years ago. I’ve moved on.” Even as the words left her mouth, she knew they were a lie.
John kneeled in front of him. “Shit, Sherlock. I’m sorry. Don’t cry, please.” He placed his hands on his knees.
John wasn't too worried. Perhaps he was dealing with something important and would come back later. He started to head back to his cabin when he heard several hushed voices coming from further down the hall. Following them, against his better judgment, he located the closed off area they were coming from. Pressing his ear to the door, he tried to make out the muffled sounds but it was no use.
“This. Rescuing me. Everyone thinking I’m your damn damsel in distress. I’m fucking useless, Sherlock. Mycroft was right.”
John turned his face towards him. He was looking down, clearly upset. After several moments of silence, he finally spoke.
“Yeah, it does surprise me, actually. Sorry if I find the thought of The Great Sherlock Holmes playing hide and go seek with a three-year-old a bit more amusing than you.”
“You’re welcome.” Another prolonged stare. After several moments of unbroken eye contact, John clamped his hands on his knees as if to rise from the chair.
“His feet are chained to the bottom!” he bellowed in fury loud enough for several officers to turn and look at them.
“Well, we know Moriarty has been following a very distinct pattern with his pirating, which we’ve tracked successfully up until now. John and his comrades hold the next vital piece of information necessary to complete this pattern. If we are to catch up to Moriarty before he slips away again, John will need to forfeit every bit of information on Moriarty’s whereabouts. Or at least everything he can remember from the last time they met.”
John drummed his fingers on the armrest for a moment before continuing. “He found my sister. In Scotland. Remember I told you she ran off?” Sherlock hummed in confirmation. “He’s willing to reach out and . . . reconnect us I guess.”
“Sher . . .” he panted as he gulped a lungful of air. The entire front of his shirt dripped in sweat. He leaned his head back and tried to steady his breathing.
He trotted downstairs and turned into the living room only to have the breath knocked out of him at what he saw standing in the middle of the floor.
John bit his lip and looked further away. A knot formed in his chest and he felt a flush creep into his cheeks. He tried to swallow the lump in his throat and blink away the hot tears forming behind his eyes.
“Oh, John,” she said, sounding amused. “You may have thought the baby my only hold on you. But let me remind you I’m still working for Moriarty. I’ve got things to do for him as well as my own little mission to carry out now.”
“That’ll do,” came Moriarty’s voice, muffled and disoriented in John’s ears as if coming from underwater. “Untie the others.”
John walked past him chatting with someone who looked nearly identical to Greg – perhaps his brother or something. Sherlock followed behind them, looking for a way to intercede and regain John’s attention.
Moriarty stepped onto the plank connected their ships and strolled on board. He breathed in deeply and smiled, his arms stretched out in front of him like a king entering his palace.
Without looking at Sherlock, he squeezed back and turned to stare out the window. Neither spoke or let go for the rest of the ride.
He wasn’t sure how long they stood there holding each other, neither wanting to let go or easing the tightness of their embrace.
As a shadow grew larger and closer to the kitchen, John felt Sherlock brace for potential danger, shifting so he was half covering him from the intruder.
“Oh yes, don’t worry about me. It really wasn’t necessary for them to come. It was just burnt cookies after all. Sherlock! You haven’t finished deciphering the clue!”
“Of course I do.” He pecked a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “I love you too.” A peck to the other corner. “Always have.”
John’s head was tilted upwards as far as he could reach. As the water rose over his cheeks and chin, he took one final breath and was submerged.
Eventually, in the distance, he saw a pale hand peek out of the water before disappearing again. John trudged through the water, the current both helping and hindering him in turns.  Eventually he reached the spot where he saw the hand and plunged underwater. He didn’t have to look too long before a pair of long, skinny arms wrapped tightly around his waist. He kicked back up to the surface, and sure enough, Sherlock popped up with him, gasping and clinging to him for dear life. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist supporting him with his hip.
Anyway, I hope this chapter was worth the wait, at least. A lot of comments last chapter had something to say about Sherlock’s one mattress… patience my darlings!! ;)
John’s heart tugged and tears prickled in his eyes once more. Of course Sherlock would. He would do anything for him. And what did he have to offer him in return? Secrets, lies, danger . . . nothing good ever.
“What mission would that be?” John kept his voice low and dangerous, refusing to let her take the upper hand in this conversation so easily.
John felt a magnetic pull tugging him to the door by his gut. He craved the adventure and thrill of going on cases with Sherlock. Every fiber in his being screamed at him to accept the wordless invitation. But after last night, he didn’t trust himself.
Sherlock untucked his shirt and ran his hands over his waist. At the contact to his bare skin, all the warm tingles in his body headed south. He cautiously brought a knee up and, to his pleasant surprise, found Sherlock just as hard as him.
Once it was over, he looked up and saw what remained of his friend: a lifeless lump wearing a Belstaff coat with a crack in his head. Blood poured from the crack like a waterfall and gathered in a scarlet pool around him.
John could feel the twisted scowl on his face and made no attempt to mellow it. With a deep breath, he diverted the conversation away from Sherlock.
As for his own experiences in the house? Perhaps Sherlock was right about that too. Being here had messed with his head. He easily could have imagined most of it. His memory could have altered what happened. There were no such things as ghosts, and they had to stick with the facts in front of them.
“Look, I appreciate your concern for Sherlock. But he’s doing fine. Great, in fact.” John hitched his jacket in preparation to leave. “You know what? If we need your help, I’ll give you a call. Okay? But until then . . .” John searched for a more polite way to say “fuck off” and came up short. “Let’s stick to pleasantries and mind our own business.”
Looking just past her ear, he furrowed his eyebrows and frowned. John followed his gaze but couldn’t see what Sherlock was irritated about.
“Yeah, well then maybe your captain should come deal with me himself instead of leaving his two beefy thugs unsupervised with a gun.” The man narrowed his eyes, growled and shoved John back against a tall wooden post, his feet still dangling off the ground. John was beginning to realize this could end very badly for him. His mouth had gotten him into sticky situations before, but nothing like this: two men, both larger than him, ready to pound him into the ground while he was pinned helpless.
Back in his room, John laid on his bed staring up at the ceiling. He knew Molly would likely be out later than him, so he had plenty of time to think.
He turned on the charm for Stacey, giving her his most devilish smile. He continued to sweet talk her, was even enjoying himself once he got into it.
“Shouldn’t you be heading home?” Sherlock asked absent mindedly, gently adjusting the dials on the microscope.
John’s insides were frozen and he was shivering violently.  Suddenly a blanket was being draped around his shoulders and there were large hands rubbing firmly up and down his arms. He pulled the blanket tighter around his body and finally allowed himself to look up at Sherlock.
His heart pounded in his chest as endless possibilities flooded his mind. He shouted directions impatiently at the driver and hung up.
He tore his eyes away from Julia practically throwing herself on him and focused on Stacey. He placed his hands on her hips and began to move more enthusiastically with her.
Beside him, Sherlock was smiling fondly to himself and eyeing the floor with much more interest than before. His lightly drummed his fingers along to the music.
So yeah. They're both dumb. But I think we all knew that already. Hope you guys liked it, and as always, please leave a comment if you can!
John pinched the bridge of his nose as his breath continued to come in shuddering gasps. Sherlock stood at his bedside with his hands clasped in front of him, as if he didn’t know what to do with them.
Sherlock, in the same clothes he had worn at the pool, scooted up to the edge of his seat. One hand was near his lips, as if he had been chewing his fingertips and and then forgot about it. His eyes bore into him, watching him intently. John wouldn’t have been surprised if he hadn’t blinked once for . . . however long he was out.
“But Gina decided she’d rather kill herself than give up Christine," John continued for him, as the pieces clicked in his mind as well. "So Moloch never got his firstborn sacrifice and continued to haunt the family.”
But a deep moan to his left made him snap his head towards the sound. Julia had climbed onto Sherlock’s lap, cupped his face, and latched her mouth onto his.
Hunched low, and with their arms around each other for support, they navigated through the thickening smoke towards the grand entrance.
At this, Sherlock nearby fumbled in his footsteps. His chest seemed to constrict on itself as he forgot to breathe for a moment.
She turned to stare longingly after Stacey. “At least Sherlock noticed what you were doing. Stacey didn’t even look once . . . I brought her here tonight because I thought maybe . . .” She shook her head to clear it.
Victor stood at the tip of the bow, his determined gaze fixed onwards at Moriarty’s ship. Rage boiled in John’s stomach at the sight of this … this
He glared at her. He knew the kiss wasn’t her fault but since Sherlock was gone, he couldn’t help but direct his anger towards her for the moment.
Their mutual silence saturated the room. John took the opportunity to observe Sherlock’s face. His eyebrows were furrowed in confusion, his eyes intense and focused on him. Neither spoke. It seemed Sherlock’s brain was on overdrive trying to comprehend what had just happened, so John broke the silence first.
, he grumbled to himself as he began soaking the wooden floor boards. Leaning on the handle of the mop, he looked up and took in the scene once more. The two crew members who had almost beaten him to a pulp yesterday were off to one side pulling on the sails. On the other side, Greg was standing at the wheel steering rigorously. One half, level below him was a young girl with a long brown ponytail going through a bin of what looked like heavy firearms.
John was shoved down to his knees by a pair of rough hands. His blindfold was yanked off leaving him looking up at two large, burly men snickering down at him. One was a brunette and one had a short blonde ponytail. He knew that by this time, the pirate ship had sailed far out at sea and his friends were miles behind him. It would be pointless to try and run.
He slowly pushed the door open to see Sherlock in a plush armchair with a blue blanket wrapped snugly around his body. His feet were in a bucket of what seemed to be steaming hot water. His black curls, sticking up in all directions, were still damp and seemed to have been tousled roughly with a towel. The sight was almost humorous. John had never seen Sherlock outside of his pirate captain attire, confident and firm. Here in front of him now, he looked almost childlike.
He was the man who wandered aimlessly with no purpose or goal. He was the man with a stack of cards and a single loaded gun that hadn’t been fired in over a year. He was a man of hideous knit sweaters and empty prospects and waking up seven days a week in seven different beds.
John Watson is a broken boy, the product of an abusive father and an alcoholic mother, looking for something real and substantial no adult in his life could give him. He doesn’t mean to fall in love, and certainly if he could have chosen, he would never have picked Sherlock Holmes.
Every once in a while he will read a newspaper article about the brilliant findings of New Scotland Yard’s resident freak and he will laugh along with all the simple minded people in the world. He will nod along to the declarations of insanity and future murderhood just as often as there are days when he gazes at the photo of the errant detective and for whatever reason he will be tempted to call him and ask him all the questions in the world.
Their bodies will become two nameless graves without purpose, heroes lost to time. And the tent they pitched, a reprieve from the world around them, the place where there love was true, will topple.
Neither of them knows of what could have been. Neither of them realizes that they both attend Mike Stamford’s wedding and in a drunken haze their eyes collide as if by magic or fate or destiny. Because they will look away, they will shake their heads, and John Watson will blandly kiss his wife and Sherlock Holmes will passionately kiss a woman named Irene. They will drown in their complacency and fake excitement until the day they die.
Then there was falling, screaming, blood on the ground, in the water, in the air. Things fell apart, mere anarchy set upon the world.
And on that day, as if by fate or luck or chance, their last resting place is side by side, two gravestones twenty years apart, together in death if in nothing else.
He’s wearing a red sweater today, an odd change from the usual monochromatic grey shades of the average doctor. The wool material is a blood red and itchy against his skin. Every once in a while he pulls against the collar, swallows awkwardly, but he refuses to remove it because the red of the sweater is a color he knows well. And it’s morbid, tragic, stupid and pathetic, but he wears it because this is the last color he ever saw Sherlock in.
And then he’d pled, “move, I’m a doctor, he’s my friend, my friend.” But what kind of friend was he if he couldn’t do this one thing right. If he was left here crying, ‘please no, please please pleasepleasepleasenononosherlocksherlocknotsherlocknotsherlocknotagain
He crashed and splattered but before he became an insignificant composition of carbon atoms to be recycled by the earth, Sherlock Holmes had said “This call, it’s my note. That’s what people do isn’t it? Leave notes.”
They are two men, madly in love and in the midst of a world war. Their love is forbidden, looked down upon, insulted. They will die in the trenches, hands held together, taken as some mockery of loyalty to Queen and Country but really an endless devotion to each other.
And he’s 22 without a single clue of love but it hurts because he could have loved Sherlock, almost had. It hurts because he had devoted himself to this one person and not once had he cared enough. He leaves without telling Sherlock what he saw. John comes back when the flat is empty and clears it of all his stuff.
A cadaver falls to the ground, and blood spills forth, blending into the wool knit sweater of the man.
Eventually the world turns without him, and John Watson sighs at the apparent lies and suicide of the man. Clucks his tongue at the crazy things people do for fame.
They do not speak for thirty years. John will think of a million things he wants to say and thousands of letters he wants to write. He will kiss Mary Morstan on a terribly boring and cliche summer night, sealing their two lives together for as long as one can tolerate the other, all the while the shadow of Sherlock lingers. John will divorce her after a daughter, marry again for another, marry thrice to a man that dies young and bereft of John Watson’s heart. He will mourn the last the most. The man had dark hair and blue eyes, and he was young, and he was smart, but John could only love him with half a heart; the other still chained to a man he constantly tried to replace.
It should have been John. Why hadn’t it been John? Why? Because Sherlock Holmes was marvelous, amazing on his own but John Watson by himself was useless, worthless, stupid.
With shaky hands, he glances out the window of a warehouse and remembers three years before. He remembers a man he had barely met and the cocky way he gambled his life.
'I-I won't. I won't'  Sherlock was cursing himself for his idiotic actions. Why there is no cab? Can he outrun this man, limping ? And the pain. The pain!
Outrunning this man is impossible if he doesn't get a transport soon.Anything would do, anything with a wheel and a crowd.He started limping as fast as possible to search for a cab, while the man followed as promised.Begging him for mercy won't work now.It was Sherlock who started it and now the man wants to finish . If somehow he manages to take him to Baker Street,there will be John to save him. He has to go to Baker Street, or the police station, or Mycroft , any of the three. And John was his answer. He cursed himself for his foolishness but stuck to the plan whatsoever.
In no minute a car came to take them and the man spent no time and started undressing Sherlock.As Sherlock resisted he choked Sherlock with one hand , and used another to undo Sherlock's own belt to tie Sherlock's arms with those. He pulled Sherlock's pants down. And started licking Sherlock's balls wetting the underpants Sherlock wore. This made Sherlock miserable. He had never allowed anyone other than John to touch him and this is not what he is used to. This is not how he had been treated earlier. He needs to free himself. He has to go. He needs an escape plan, but  looked like he was already out of breath as the other man started stroking Sherlock's dick hard and without mercy.Before Sherlock could do anything, the car stopped. The driver came out and opened the door. Sherlock was ashamed,putting all his effort to cover himself to hide his nakedness from the driver, but the driver looked at Sherlock with the same lust as his master's and Sherlock shut his eyes closed to avoid the predatory glares.
Sherlock took deep breaths to finally speak in the man's ear 'my place' to which he kicked Sherlock on the balls hard and the shock from the sudden attack felt much lesser than the immediate pain he felt.
One month after his therapy he had asked Mycroft to put flowers in front of John's picture everyday, and Mycroft took it as a sign of his brother's getting better.Mycroft couldn't be more happier when Sherlock showed the first sign of a sound and rational mind when he with his logic and reasons put forward his statement of how he thinks he is unfit to raise Rosie  and that they needed to search for a good foster home, and made Mycroft to do all the necessary within the following month and finalized the best foster home for Rosie.
This somehow brought Sherlock back to his senses. He cursed himself for the dangerous move he took and all he wanted now was to get himself out of this terrible place and away from all the judgy eyes and the man's evil glare.
Sherlock waved his body wiggling his arse, following the rhythm of the music  to please the man in front. The man surely enjoyed the lean beautiful man and his flirtatious dance . Sherlock made sure that there is no space in between them and very smoothly took the other man's palms and placed them  on  Sherlock's own arse cheeks.
Sherlock's heart stopped and for a moment he realized his mind wasn't clear enough to think anything other than the fear of getting raped. He started swallowing in anticipation  and slowly turned his head around to see the same man obviously. 'I-' Sherlock stammered 'I-ddont!-want to '
'Now!' he said. 'I will let you go lad. But If you ever try to tell anyone about last night or me, or this placeI I'll put hundreds and thousands of your naked posters all over London.'
Sherlock's hips swung from one side to the other with the most grace as his dancers' legs rolled to reach the most muscular man of tonight and stood in front of him, blocking his view.
Sherlock was finally home. He exchanged the dead flowers with the new one and lit a candle besides John's photograph.
''I have been feigning smile since you died, now  I think  I have forgotten how to smile without faking it. Real or Hallucination?"
The master was awfully quiet. Although he had agreed to the driver's plan initially, as Sherlock struggled to escape he got up and sat on top of Sherlock, and started to mouthfuck the slave again When he reached orgasm he cummed on Sherlock's face  and neck and chest again to add some wet strokes beside the ones that had already dried . He then simply took his phone out and took a snap of Sherlock's state.
“Thank you, Sherlock.” As Victor shoved him forward, John prepared himself for the hard floor to smack against his face. Instead, a pair of long arms caught gently and pulled him in, almost cradling him.
“Yeah, I know, you git,” John replied with a chuckle of his own. “And that’s not how truth or dare works.”
That made sense, John thought. These things only seemed to happen to him when he was alone. He vaguely wondered why this
“Looks like the grandmother dabbled in witchcraft after all.” John reached out and stroked along it’s carved borders, studying the chipping letters. “I found it in the attic along with some other things you might expect. Candles, books, that sort of thing.”
John smiled to himself remembering how Josephine had gawked when Sherlock grabbed his waist in excitement, ordering him pack his things.
John took his face in his hands and forced him to meet his eyes. There was vulnerability there, and something else as well . . .
“No,” Sherlock shot back instantly. John would never. They might be upset with each other, but he would never . . . he wouldn’t . . .
John gasped and wriggled, aching for him to go lower. Sherlock dragged his mouth down the trail of hair leading to his pants.
But if she left, what would happen to Sherlock and John? Well, Sherlock she could care less about. He’s had this coming to him since before she was in the picture. But John.
Sherlock fought it momentarily, trying to maintain his scowl, but eventually melted into a smile. The boy’s voice was simply wonderful. And his smile . . . he couldn’t stay mad at it.
He turned to Sherlock with his mouth open, but found himself rendered speechless. Sherlock gazed back down at him, equally lost for words. John’s eyes swept over his face face - his dark eyelashes, his cheekbones, his slightly parted lips - drinking him in, taking comfort in the fact that he was alive and here, and not dead and abandoned in a darkened swimming pool.
John couldn’t help thinking how majestic he looked. He truly wore his pirate captain attire very well. His hands were folded behind his back as he leaned forward and down towards John. The gaze of his piercing blue-gray eyes all but stabbed into him as they swept over his whole face.
“Why not? Please tell me,” John resumed stroking his cheeks with his thumbs. As normal friends would do, he said mentally. He knew he was crossing many lines here, but his and Sherlock’s relationship was never what anyone could call “normal” anyway. “You know you can tell me anything, Sherlock.”
John was more than aware of this. Sherlock and Mycroft had seen each other sparingly for the last month, ever since they reunited at the precinct. Their meetings, at least the ones John was present for, were always awkward and filled with uncomfortable silences. Though they were making progress, they still had a long way to go before they had anything even resembling a normal sibling relationship.
"Yes. Unfortunately, sometimes I do make mistakes that result in the attack of an innocent ship or innocent captive, as is the case with yourself. I was very, very close to catching up to him. But mistaking your cruise boat for another set me back several steps. Victor and I are currently attempting to work around this setback and get back on track."
Side note: If you want music to go with the kiss, I recommend the soundtrack to Harry and Ginny's kiss from The Half Blood Prince. Just trust me :) That's actually the music that prompted the scene to just pop in my head.
“I’m afraid that I cannot comply with your request. The British Government does not have in its possession any such materials.”
I get to my feet and start towards him, but stop when I see his face. Sherlock’s eyes are two pools of liquid black, even the sclera.
Mycroft ends the call before I can get in another word. “Bollocks!” Well I’ll be damned if I’m going to just sit at home and do nothing. Mycroft isn’t the only person with resources. I scroll through the contacts on my phone and call Bill Wiggins.
“Cthulhu came to me in a dream… I was in a huge, dank cavern standing naked before him. He was sitting on a massive throne, intricately carved with symbols. He looked exactly like the monolith at Caird and Rayner, except he wasn’t made of stone, John… he was
Mycroft is leaning against the boot of his car. He straightens his shoulders, pulling himself to his full height as we reach him.
Lestrade leads us around the side of the warehouse and through a service entrance which connects to the main part of the building. We’re barely inside when the smell hits us – the coppery festering odour of blood – lots of it – and the stench of decaying fish. As we move on I start to breathe through my mouth or risk embarrassing myself by losing my breakfast and contaminating the crime scene.
I pull back a bit so we’re facing one another, then cup his face in my hand. “I love you, and I'll always be there for you no matter what happens, Sherlock.” I kiss him very tenderly and wrap myself around him, as if my love alone could protect him from all the evils in the world.
We sit in silence for a few moments while Sherlock and I finish our tea. He then sets the cup down and clears his throat.
As for me, I’ve taken leave from the clinic. They were very supportive when I told them Sherlock had been kidnapped, but since I only work there two days a week, my absence won’t make that much of a difference, unless London is suddenly beset by an epidemic.
Sherlock speaks for the first time since entering the building. “Yes, John. Unless I’m mistaken, and I very much doubt that I am, we are now traveling parallel to the canal. In fact…” He reaches down and grabs a handful of dirt, sniffs it and lets it sift through his fingers. “High concentration of nitrogen and organic matter. This was marshland before the warehouse was built over it. But why block this section off? It makes no sense.”
''Good boy !' the man said from behind 'Look how beautiful your body looks… Weak, hurt, lost, defeated. But you know the one thing which is making you  more gorgeous ? Is that, you are still not ready for this, you are trying but you are failing. And I am gonna enjoy this beautiful you as long as I want. If you don't follow me now , I am gonna fuck you naked here in this very street. And then I am gonna keep your richass clothes and trust me when I say you'll put the stage on fire. Londoners will be very pleased to smack those arse if not whipping those perky nipples the first option ''
But he had invited it. This is exactly what he needed to tempt John. Exactly that which would force John the show himself. All he has to do now is to bring this man home and act a little lovey-dovey for John. Just a little foreplay and John would come jumping from wherever he is. If in case John gets smarter enough to understand the lie of it, even then he will definitely come to save Sherlock from the brutal monster this man is.
Rosie shifted with the foster parents last week and three months of brilliant performance rewarded Sherlock in his release from Sherrinford, and Sherlock couldn't be more happy on himself. He surely misses Rosie and is sad enough to give her away but he has a brother who can change the law and bring Rosie back to them if Sherlock anyhow manages to bring John back.
He gathered himself and started limping towards the exit. He didn't look back but as soon as the music faded as he walked  out and away from the disc, he heard footsteps that followed him all the way.
'You moron' Sherlock turned around to see John floating in the air like a feather. 'yes congratulations Sherlock , you too are a ghost now'
"At least I have survived more than what people thought I could without John. So Mycroft was right indeed? I am mad! But nobody will know now. Thanks for coming in the last minute. Real or Hallucination, Goodbye John Watson. "
When they were done raping Sherlock, leaving him drenched in cum and piss,people exchanged suggestions of what to do with Sherlock now. Whether to keep him or not. If keeping him is the option then for how long? Or is it better to  invite some other men right here right now to fuck him so much that he finally dies losing his breath.Or is it not the best to put a bullet on his head immediately and throw him on the Thames?
Sherlock sounded much better from the very little he spoke.But that's how he was before, a sociopath.So this wasn't a  concern for Mycroft Holmes.Rather he was satisfied enough with Sherlock's progress which seemed like Sherlock has deleted the entire John is a spirit episode from the mind palace of his and Mycroft is fine with that. Because Sherlock now acknowledges that John is dead and CCTV footages showed clips of Sherlock mourning for his dead friend.
Sherlock knew that he had lost the game, and following him is the only thing that could save him at least from the public humiliation.
When Sherlock reached the door, the man blocked the exit and slipped some cash inside the pocket of Sherlock's belstaff. 'Thank you for your service' he grinned ' I'll teach you how to please your masters more,next time we meet. '
And here I am getting all maudlin, despite the fact I haven’t had anything stronger than tea or juice since we arrived here ten months ago. Sherlock is starting to get restless, and I’m not sure what to do. We can only play so many games of Operation, Cluedo or cards. I should have realized that once Winter got here, things would change.
The police have cordoned off a two block area surrounding the warehouse, so we exit the cab and walk the rest of the way, weaving around emergency vehicles and police cars as we do.
After ten minutes, the uncomfortable silence between us is almost unbearable. I want him to yell, to say it was my fault, to blame Sherlock… anything but the absolute stillness of the man. Another five minutes goes by before he finally speaks.
Anthea joins us as we finish eating. Mycroft disconnects his call and she leans down to whisper something to him.
“One day at a time, Sherlock, remember? That’s what we decided on. We’ll stay here as long as you need to, and if that turns out to be for the rest of our lives, that’s fine. The village doctor is getting on in years; maybe I could take over his practice.”
in this chapter. There is a brief, but non-detailed description of what happened to Sherlock when he was being held by the cultists. It involved non-consensual acts performed on him.
I wrap my arms around him and return the kiss, perhaps a bit more forcefully than I mean to. Sherlock bumps into the table, then suddenly pushes me away.
“I’ll reach out to him in the morning. In the meantime, you get some rest. They’re keeping you overnight for observation.” Mycroft holds up his hand. “And before you start asserting that you’re fine, I suggest you look in the mirror.”
After I make tea for both of us, Sherlock has me sit on the sofa, while he turns his chair at an angle to the fireplace. This isn’t going to be good.
“It didn’t take long for Cthulhu to… possess me. I was aware of everything around me, but had no control over my body. If I had… well… they wouldn’t have been able to do what they did to me. I’m sorry, John.”
We exit the hospital and are immediately whisked away in one of Mycroft’s chauffeured cars; Anthea is noticeably absent.
We take things slowly. Mycroft must have put the word out, because our friends call ahead to schedule a time to visit. Lestrade, Molly, and Mike each stop by to say hello and ask if we need anything. None of them stay long.
His time spent in the shed has been gradually increasing a bit more each day. I leave him alone for the most part – I don’t want him to think that I’m hovering – but the truth is, I worry about him constantly. Sherlock is a great actor, and knows how to conceal or suppress his emotions when he thinks it’s to his advantage; or to prevent upsetting me.
We’re dropped off at Baker Street by one of Mycroft’s private cars. Mrs Hudson is out of town visiting her sister, so it’s just the two of us.
Mycroft arrived half an hour ago – he’s remarkably subdued. After inspecting all the medical equipment attached to his brother, he pulls a chair next to the bed and just sits. There’s no smugness about him, no arrogant mien; he’s obviously concerned about Sherlock, but there’s an underlying current of something else going on.
The elder Holmes wants to debrief Sherlock on the spot, but I draw the line and tell him it can wait until Sherlock’s hydrated, cleaned up, eaten and a had a decent night’s rest – in that order. He backs off after I give him a scathing glare.
“Nope,” I say as I take a seat and cross my arms. “That’s what your husband wants me to do. I can’t just sit and do nothing, Greg. I’ll go barking mad if I do.”
Sherlock raises his shirt and I gasp… there's a red line of raised flesh running from his left shoulder to his naval. As we watch, the redness fades and the skin returns to normal.
“Sherlock,” I begin. “I don’t think there’s any way for us to know the answer to that. And don’t you
And, finally, here's an image of the creatures that I imagined surrounded John: https://goo.gl/images/ZeLSAE.
“What if I file a missing person’s report? Or report that Sherlock’s been kidnapped? You could investigate that, right?”
Sherlock’s in the kitchen putting bread in the toaster. He walks over, wraps his arms around me and kisses my forehead.
Sherlock drops to the ground, and the cultists scatter after I take one of them out with a head shot. I quickly push my partner behind me and dare anyone to try and take him. That’s how the others find us.
And with that he turns and heads down the stairs. Sherlock goes to the window and watches as his brother drives away, a puzzled look on his face.
“The remains of ten individuals were found, however, there were no intact bodies. They’d all been torn apart.” Mycroft pales slightly.
The MI6 teams are deployed around the warehouse perimeter to cover the exits, with one team assigned to Mycroft, Greg and myself to enter through the main doors. We’re only going to get one chance at this, so I say a silent prayer that we get Sherlock back and in one piece.
The ground surrounding the statue is drenched in blood; in some places there are standing pools of it. How many people were killed here?
Oh well… I take the luggage into the bedroom and unpack, then wash a load of laundry while Sherlock busies himself with his laptop. I sort through the mail, then start on the stack of newspapers Mrs Hudson has saved for us. I have a feeling Sherlock is going to want to get back to work once Dr Johansen releases him as a patient.
“John, Sherlock… please take a seat. I must say I was quite intrigued by your phone call. Please explain this process of deleting information to me.”
Lestrade’s knees buckle and Sherlock and I manage to grab him before he hits the floor. We half-carry him to the sofa, letting him stretch out fully once we get there.
“Go, John. I’ll just be sorting through documents anyway. The worse thing that can happen to me is a paper cut.“
“Somewhat… Today wasn’t exactly a bad day, but it wasn’t good either. I always leave Dr Johansen’s office feeling a bit out of sorts.”
“I told you once that your loss would break my heart. I meant it then and I mean it now. If anything should happen to you or John… Please reconsider, Sherlock, for both your sakes.”
When he doesn’t answer, I grab his forearms to get his attention. His eyes are wild and terrified and he frantically tries to pull away from me. I release him; he turns toward the statue and begins yelling.
Showered, dressed and fed, Sherlock and I share a companionable silence as we read the daily papers and drink our tea. Forty five minutes later, Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade of New Scotland Yard staggers up the seventeen steps to our flat.
Mycroft hands his brother a t-shirt, track pants and some trainers, and I help Sherlock get them on after I do a cursory examination – he has some superficial contusions and abrasions on his arms, legs and torso, and he definitely needs a bath, but other than that he seems fine.
Sherlock quickens his pace, moving ahead of Lestrade and me, but stops suddenly and looks up. He’s pointing his torch towards the ceiling, but all I can see is an endless darkness in all directions. That is, until I’m standing next to him.
Dr Johansen is there when Sherlock is discharged, as well as several nurses and staff members who helped with his treatment and recovery. Sherlock thanks each one of them by name before he takes my hand and says, “Let’s go home, John.”
Mycroft waits until she leaves to address us. “Gregory and the rest of New Scotland Yard have been removed from further involvement in the Caird and Rayner murder case. In fact, the entire investigation has been transferred to the purview of MI6. Which means that you, brother mine, and Doctor Watson are off the case as well.”
“Yes, he’s told me. And that may be why he wants to leave. He specifically stated he wanted to go somewhere quiet where he could think, without the background noise of the city.”
There’s another path for me to follow, with a much slighter grade than the one I just rolled down. As I make my way up the incline, I notice a pale blue luminescence which gets brighter as I approach. The creatures have failed to follow me into this cavern; perhaps this was my intended destination all along. A few more steps and I’ll be at the apex. I take a deep breath and walk forward.
John Watson marries Mary Morstan in a lovely ceremony that Sherlock Holmes attends. John will stare out into the people seated in front of him and wish to beg just one for help. But no one will want him and he is too far gone to back out, so he kisses Mary and monotonously thinks that he won’t have much of his life left regardless.
And John knew, pretended he didn’t but he did because once he had left a note behind and wanted no one to save his life. But he had lived and his life was all the more brighter for it, all because of Sherlock.
Why, when his phone rings and rings, does he answer with an S on his lips and the flash of a long coat, not unlike the red cloak?
“He’s my friend.” John had yelled brokenly, chest shaking, vision blurry, hands trembling as the cold sack of flesh was held between them. His arms had trembled as he shoved through the crowd of onlookers. His voice hoarse as he said, “Move let me through, I’m a doctor. I’m a doctor.” But all his learning and and all his training, and all the king’s horses and all the king’s men.
John Watson was as useless as he always was when it mattered most. He was no great mind, no great person, not even a decent enough friend to notice the signs of someone whose life begged saving. He watched helpless as Sherlock Holmes killed the greatest man John ever knew.
Everett Ross hesitates to speak to the man, finds the thought of another version of him with perhaps a different name or life far too terrifying. Nevertheless he stares at the man with a curious gaze, eyes only minutely surprised when he turns back.
John reads every newspaper article printed, hides them from a wife that yells and throws knives with the ease of an assassin just as he hides the bruises from the rare visits by Gregory Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes. No one notices, no one cares, and the only one that might’ve seem his crumbling psyche has hurt him far too much to visit.
John was too far away to see the body collide with the ground. His joints aching and straining enough by the time he arrived to uselessly ask, “he’s not moving why isn’t he moving?”
John is John and Sherlock is Sherlock and the latter confounds the former, and the former loves the latter, and one will inevitably hurt the other because such relationships of devotion fail miserably at being love and can never endure the changing human psyche. They are far too shallow on one side, tilted and skewed to favor one, lack the necessary commitment and reciprocation. Sherlock holds all of John’s affections but the same can not be said of a boy with money in the millions and dreams of scientific glory and the simple boy with not a penny to his name. John is kind and sweet and well enough to impress, but what he lacks in the mental department can not be made up for in an overabundance of affection. He is at times exhausting, and nothing that Sherlock could see himself forever with. He is a distraction, a splash of color in a world of grey doomed to burn out and be nothing. Sherlock needs more, desires a platform for greatness but he can not deny the man is unforgettable, perhaps a tad significant. So he lets him stay in the periphery and pretends his heart does not twinge at the sight of blonde hair and warm blue eyes.
Sherlock is the flighty sort, the kind that tires easily and throws things out rather than keeping them and risking sentimentality. He’s an incredibly selfish utilitarian who prefers to care for his own comfort above anyone else’s and has little qualms about doing so. Loving him is like playing with fire; logically it will hurt, logically it will burn, but emotionally it feels warm and real and the burnt isn’t felt until it’s too late and flesh gives way to charred remains.
He will remember a failed and abusive marriage that ended in court battles and legal pissing matches for custody of two children Sherlock had never known how to love. He will damn his youth and think of the color yellow, bright against a black, monochromatic world. He will think of a fire that damns him to hell.
“Take care of her, please Sherlock. This is my note,” he says to the voicemail. “It’s what people do.” And he jumps.
And then, 52 year old John Watson, GP will knock on the door of a consulting detective’s office and he will weep and ask why. Thirty years later and three daughters but bawling on the steps of a man who broke him, drunk from a funeral of a man he tried so hard to love.
Their first encounter is a chemical reaction of epic proportions. It’s an electron knocking the nucleus out of orbit, running into a brick wall and making cement give way. It’s a single spark in the dark, the crack of a bullet in a room of silence.
The sorcerer smiles arrogantly at him, lips pulled tight as if he knows everything and they’re stuck like that for an infinite second. A connection is built, and the man looks at him as if he were suddenly everything.
He doesn’t know why it took him so long to notice. The mustache was not so obvious, the act pathetic, but he supposes ignorance is better in some cases.
He runs to the street and Sherlock can see him, can wrap his hands on the coat, but he doesn’t see the car.
He reaches down, wipes the tears from my face and smiles. That smile… the one I fell in love with so many years ago; the one he showed only to me.
“Do you remember the first time I told you that I loved you? It was after that whole Magnussen business, and that assassin who shot the both of you. You were in hospital, and I thought you were unconscious. I was poring my heart out to you, begging you not to die, because I loved you and couldn’t go on without you. And you said…”
“What happened to you today? You mentioned something about a psychic attack when you woke up in hospital.”
It takes us nearly 30 minutes to get there. The cab parks as close as it can, then we walk – talk about déjà vu. It’s another deserted warehouse, but instead of uniformed police, there are lots of men in dark suits with earpieces and stab vests. We approach the barricade and show our ID’s. After a quick radio check, we’re waved through, and the guard points us in the right direction. I have a bad feeling about this.
My brother-in-law doesn’t look too well when he walks in the room. He and Greg have a private moment before he settles on the chair next to the bed.
There’s a large opening at the top of the stairs – a doorway – but not one built by or for men. I step through and immediately lose my footing on some loose detritus. The wind is knocked out of me as I tumble down a steep incline for what seems like minutes, but is, in actuality, just a few seconds.
. “I’ve read through all the documents connected to his case, and I have to say, that if I didn’t know better, I’d think that someone was having me on. Cults, paranormal activity, blood sacrifices, monstrous creatures… they sound like something out of a bad horror film. But as it turns out, I’m quite familiar with the entity known as Cthulhu.”
“I love you too, Sherlock, but right now my knees are killing me.” I get up slowly and we both move to the sofa.
After we eat, I wash the dishes and let them dry in the rack, before Sherlock and I go outside to enjoy a walk in the afternoon sun.
We continue to walk for another several metres, with a gradual leveling of the dirt floor.  My torch beam catches something up ahead. As we get closer, I realize it’s yellow barricade tape. This must be the actual crime scene.
Testing me? Okay... “They were built at the order of King Henry VIII as a storehouse for supplies, and a place to train naval officers. It eventually grew into the main site for construction of the ships of the Royal Navy. The Museum of London Archaeology did a dig here in 2010 to determine the archaeological potential of the site because the land owners, Convoy’s Investments, wanted to develop it. Petitions went back and forth for years, until Convoy’s wrote to then London Mayor Boris Johnson to call in the case. The Royal Heritage Society got involved at one point too. They’re still arguing about it.”
Sherlock sits back and assumes what I call his ‘thinking pose’ – eyes closed; fingers steepled in front of his mouth. I have a feeling that neither of us will be getting any more sleep tonight, so I go into the kitchen and put the kettle on. While the water is heating, I return my revolver to the bedroom, grab Sherlock’s dressing gown from the back of the door, then head back to the living room. The sofa’s empty; Sherlock’s rooting through one of the cardboard boxes.
After arriving home, we both toe off our shoes and settle in our chairs with a cup of tea. Since Sherlock said we should discuss what happened in the warehouse, I begin the conversation.
… You… Look, you know I’m not good at this stuff; never have been. But I want to be perfectly clear on this point – I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and when we promised till death do us part, I meant that with every breath in my body. And I plan on spending the rest of my life with you… if you’ll have me.”
The place is eerily quiet. I assume they’ve taken Sherlock to the monolith room, so I try to remember my way there. The smell of rotting fish is almost overwhelming, but at least I know I’m going in the right direction.
“What the…” I turn to Sherlock, who’s been leaning against the wall staring at his shoes since he finished his statement. “Sherlock, what did you tell him?”
He turns to leave, but hesitates at the door. “Are you sure you wish to pursue this line of inquiry? I’m not a superstitious man, Sherlock, but I fear this course of action will have dire consequences for one or both of you.”
I gasp at the sight before me. It’s a cyclopean room, circular in shape, with bas-reliefs carved into the walls. Directly ahead of me is an elaborate throne, hewn from the stone of the cavern. But it’s what’s sitting on the throne that sets my heart pounding frantically.
Sherlock puts the tea down, walks over and hugs me. “They won’t risk coming here, John. Not after the show of force you put on last night.”
My eyes fly open; I sit up and take in my surroundings. Baker Street... I’m in our bed. Sherlock is gently stroking my hair, a look of concern on his face. I flop back down, take a deep breath and let it out slowly.
All the surviving cultists are zip-tied, loaded into vans, and driven off into the night. I assume they’ll be arrested and detained at some government facility, but they can rot for all I care. There are also ten captives being held in the warehouse. Thankfully, they’re all unhurt.
He doesn't answer immediately; just squeezes me tighter and buries his face against my shoulder. We sit this way for several minutes before he calms down enough to speak.
Everything is incredibly huge – greenish stone blocks of unbelievable size covered in mud and weeds, along with colossal statues and bas-reliefs. In addition to the immense size of the structures, the angles of the city look all wrong, as if it were made from non-Euclidean geometry and dimensions apart from our own.
Sherlock pours us both tea, then takes a seat himself. There’s a slight tremor in his hand as he takes a sip. I’ve upset him. Christ, if I’ve caused a flashback…
As one, the things move towards me. I pivot – there’s only one direction open to me – up a steep flight of stairs. I begin to run, hoping there’s some form of egress from this place.
It's after midnight before we finally get to bed; I drop off almost immediately. Sherlock must have gotten back up because the next thing I know, I'm awoken by blood curdling screams coming from the living room. I grab my gun from the bedside table and rush in to find Sherlock on the sofa – alone, curled in a foetal position.
Even after 29 years I can still hear the chanting… the chanting in that horrible, guttural language,
The ground begins to slope downward at a steep angle. Someone's installed a temporary rope fence which helps slow our descent and keeps us from pitching onto our faces (or falling on our arses). Nothing surrounds us but an oppressive blackness that grows stronger the further we proceed.
Summer makes way to Fall, and Fall to Winter. I have to say that I never imagined myself living in the country and raising flowers and vegetables with Sherlock Holmes. But if I’m honest with myself, I’d be happy anywhere as long as Sherlock is with me. Sherlock is home.
My solicitor has been given strict instructions that the statue locked in my safety deposit box is to be hand delivered to the Curator of the British Museum, where it will be placed in the Occult Collections Vault for perpetuity. Under no circumstances should it be removed from its case, unwrapped, or left unguarded for any reason. The statue itself isn’t valuable – it’s chiseled from a single block of obsidian – but the figure it represents… the world must never know about that.
“Nonsense, Mycroft.” Sherlock chuckles. “I think Dr Terror would be a better choice. Don’t you, John?”
And scream until my throat is raw and my voice is gone. The man on the throne spreads his legs apart and beckons to me; I drop to the ground and crawl to him – emotions alternating between shock and disbelief. It can’t be; it just can’t.
“It would be better if I showed you. This way.” He points his umbrella towards the two hanger-like buildings in the distance.
Sherlock laughs. “Oh, John, if there’s one constant in the universe, it’s that no matter the problem or situation, a cup of your tea will always set things to right. I’d love one, thank you.”
It turns out Sherlock hasn’t sustained any serious physical injuries, but there’s always the psychological ones we can’t see. Sherlock’s offered the opportunity to take a shower at the hospital, but he refuses.
The Inspector jumps up, shoves me out of the way, and stumbles to the loo. The sounds of retching follow soon after. I go to the kitchen and put the kettle back on.
Sherlock’s voice rises in volume, and he punctuates each question by slamming my head against the wood until I pass out.
Both men turn to me, awaiting my answer. Despite my initial surprise at Dr Johansen’s disclosure, I feel that he’s telling the truth, and that he is the right person to help Sherlock.
I check in with one of the security team to let them know Sherlock is home alone before taking off down the street.
Our lives once again fall into a semblance of normality. Sherlock and I solve cases together for another 10 years or so, until a heart attack fells me while chasing a suspect down one of London’s countless alleys. Lucky for me I was ahead of Sherlock this time. I’ll never forget the look on his face – he was terrified. That’s not a look I ever want to see on my husband again. Yes… husband. Sherlock and got married not long after the whole Cthulhu business.
I end the call, grab my gun, a couple extra clips and a torch, and race down the stairs to the street.
I don’t say that out loud. Of course Sherlock would notice my body’s reactions during a nightmare. He notices everything, especially since we’ve become lovers. I smile and pull him down for a quick kiss.
Sherlock spends the next 30 minutes going over the process with Dr Johansen, starting with his memory retention technique, or his Mind Palace as he calls it. After he’s finished, Dr Johansen just shakes his head and chuckles.
We both stand and hug each other tightly, and Sherlock kisses my cheek. When we pull apart, I take a good look at his work table. There are test tubes filled with plant cuttings, flower petals spread out in neat rows, jars of dirt, a high-powered microscope with a box of slides, a couple of open notebooks that contain Sherlock’s sketches, and what looks like an ultraviolet light hanging from the ceiling.
I can see now why Mycroft didn’t want to re-enter the building. Christ! It’s like a scene from a slasher film. Sprays of blood cover the floor and rear wall – unlike the first crime scene, there are no standing pools of it. There are also no traces of organs or soft tissues. Stacks of bones are placed at regular intervals, but they’re all arranged at odd angles. None of the stacks are displayed in the same way.
Out of habit, I check to make sure all the doors and windows are secure, then turn out the lights and make my way up the stairs. There’s a tightness in my chest, but it’s not severe enough to take another pill.
Only one more person to try, and if he doesn’t know where his brother is… no, I won’t go down that road quite yet. I manage some dinner and a cup of tea before Mycroft gets back to me.
It's been four hours since Sherlock lost consciousness. The doctors have run every conceivable test they can think of including an EEG and MRI, but all the results have either come back negative or normal. But something out of the ordinary obviously happened. Lestrade and I both witnessed it.
“What! No, of course not! I gave you my sincerest promise that I would never takes drugs again unless you approved them for me. No, this is something completely different, John.
I glance at Mycroft, and he nods. One of the MI6 teams chauffeurs us back to Baker Street, then sets up watch around the building, while I usher Sherlock upstairs.
After Professor Abernathy gets the door unlocked, Sherlock and I enter the vault. It's bigger than I thought it would be – at least 6 metres long and the same number wide.  The air is cool, so it's obviously climate controlled as well. Most of the books are in locked, glass-fronted cabinets.
“I’ve tracked his phone to Caird and Rayner. I’m sending a team there as we speak; a car is waiting for you downstairs.“
Before I can even form an answer, Sherlock quickly moves from the window, grabs my jacket and shoves me hard against the door to the flat.
