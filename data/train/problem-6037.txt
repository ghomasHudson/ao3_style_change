“FRIDAY, turn up my jam,” Tony walks them to an open area in the workshop, Steve’s hand still in his.
“Isn’t that where Jarvis lives?” Pepper said.
hadn’t imagined).
Steve was the first to speak after they separated and both hastily tried to make like nothing had happened.
Hearing his voice for the first time after years of nothing, certainty did wonders to Tony’s infatuation for the man. He really could not pinpoint the moment he realized that not only was he majorly screwed up, but also that he was completely sure it could be the worst possible situation someone had fallen in love within the entire history of humanity.
“I don’t put out on the first date Rogers,” Tony said jokingly though he would’ve liked it if Steve really was interested in him.
It's just a light press of lips but it takes Tony’s breath away, by the gasp from Steve he guesses the same for him.
about.”
Tony could say he was pretty much used to everything that could possibly surprise him, he had dealt with literal aliens for God's sake. So, when he lifted his face, from where he was working with some delicate stuff in his workshop, to three pairs of eyes staring pleadingly at him, he could be man enough to admit he had not expected that.
“This is it.” Tony muttered to himself with a sigh once he had parked in front of the courthouse. He took a few minutes to balance himself before exiting the car and making a beeline for the entrance.
Tony had learned that Steve had been a soldier once who had been discharged along with Clint and his two best friends, Sam and Bucky. After coming back they had trouble reintegrating into such a loud city like New York, where they were all from. With the help of Clint’s friend Natasha, they moved to Hinsdale, for a fresh start.
“They’re not that good for sure,” Steve said shyly, he was clearly terrible at taking compliments.
“Come on, let’s introduce you to the wonders of 21st-century music,” It takes Steve a few moments to process the statement, in which Tony starts to doubt whether he made a mistake and crossed a line.
Following the instruction that Lauren had given him, Tony soon found himself in front of a beautiful two floor house. It had a big garden with gorgeous and clearly well kept flowers of all kinds. Once Tony took his gaze from the garden he could see that next to it was the barn Clint and Nat had told him about. The whole place gave a calm vibe and Tony could see where Ana would be the one taking care of the barn while Jarvis took care of the flowers. If there was one thing Tony still remembered of his childhood it was the walks around the garden in the mansion alongside Jarvis.
"And what would that be?" Tony asked suspiciously, brushing a stray of her blond hair behind her ear. They only ever teamed up when they wanted to gain forces to get whatever it was they wanted.
Looking at how the street lights illuminated the city with a soft glow now, Tony could admit that he understood the feeling of wanting to stay here, where everything seemed to go in slow motion compared to the big city Tony was used to.
After some seconds where it looked like they were deciding who would be the one to speak, Harley spoke up.
His brain blacked out for a second, Tony hadn't heard from Jarvis for over 18 years; not since he had left home and hadn’t looked back. He had been so eager to disobey his father and do the exact opposite of what Howard expected of him. He still remembered Jarvis, the family butler, who had been more of a father than his own had ever been. He was the one that always told Tony to become what he wanted and not what was expected of him.
Tony could’ve sworn Steve brushed his thumb over Tony’s knuckles, but he’ll never know because Natasha chose that moment to arrive with their orders, causing Steve to flinch away as if Tony’s hand was on fire.
Before Steve could answer Mary spoke. "Daddy said you would say yes."
Tony took that as permission to lean closer. They were so close that Tony could feel Steve’s breath on his face. After a second Steve closed his eyes and Tony leaned in and kissed his cheek. At that, Steve let out a soft gasp and Tony lingered there for a few seconds.
“You could say that,” Tony said, swallowing his last bite. “The pancakes were delicious, thank you.”
“I have not, I imagine they have something other than pancakes, not that I haven’t had them for lunch before.”
“Can’t wait then,” Steve said smiling softly.
"If it were up to me I'd say yes," Tony said which immediately prompted the kids to get excited, "but you know who has the final word."
“Pep, I won’t be available for a day just letting you know,” Tony said after Pepper picked up.
“I’m staying at the motel around the corner for a night, a family member just passed and there are some things I have to take care of.” Tony said, something about the man made it very easy to confide in him.
“I’m not really his son, I’m not his blood,” Tony quickly corrected, though he had always thought Jarvis and Ana were more parents to him than his own ever were.
After he arrived at the motel he greeted Bruce, who was still at the counter preparing to head out, and went to his room. There he took a shower, brushed his teeth then fell into bed.For the first time in a long time, Tony was actually excited about what awaited him the next day.
If he was honest he wasn’t completely sure he remembered any of the ride home, he spent the whole way thinking of how Jarvis must have died alone with nobody there to spend those last moments with. He thought of all the times he could have made an effort and at least called to make sure he was alright, but no, he had to be obsessed with a job that made him forget about his own life and his own problems.
With tears in his eyes Tony left the house, fully intended on leaving Hinsdale and going back to New York 𑁋to his routine𑁋 when from the corner of his eye the barn caught his attention.
“As I was saying,” continued Tony. “My client affirms-”
Steve had a hunch he would be the one who would have to feed the pet and take them out but he also didn't want to say no, they were good kids and he was sure they would try their best.
Alright, that was a pretty great bargain.
“Haha,” Tony says ironically. “Sure, just give me a sec before I wrap things up for today”
Already knowing that they were gonna ask for something, Steve made his way back to Morgan to feed her some fruit, which she thankfully loved.
"Why do you want a puppy?" Tony asked them.
“The band playing, it looked like you knew the lyrics,” Tony says as he busies himself with some wire at the workbench.
“You knew Jarvis?” Tony asked instead.
Since last week, Tony had started working on Peter’s birthday gift, some high-tech glasses for when not being in full suit turn out to be the perfect gift.
The place actually worked for them and they all started to make their lives here. Clint took care of the diner alongside Nat while Bucky and Sam became the mechanics of the town. The quiet community worked well for them, and they had all been here ever since.
“Bye Pep.” Tony said before hanging up.
"Have you asked your Papa?" Tony asked.
“As I was saying Mr. Jarvis left more than half of his assets to your name and you are required to sign the transfer of ownership,” the woman finished saying.
“Almost everyday, the owners are good friends so it doesn’t really feel like eating out.”
“Does it really matter either way?” Steve said while gazing up to look  Tony in the eyes, like it was really that simple.
After taking a shower and dressing  in the grey Tom Ford he had packed, Tony started picking up the few things he had left laying around. Once he had closed his bag Tony realized that the good mood he had gone to bed with was now gone and he had been left with a deep sense of dread.
“Here you go,” Tony said while giving his ID. “Do you know any place that would be open right now where I could grab a bite?” It had been hours since he had last eaten and  airline food was still trash, even in first class.
Tony was not ignorant to how his life revolved around his job and nothing else. He had no friends 𑁋besides Rhodey or Pepper𑁋 or personal life. He woke up only to do his job and as Rhodey and Pepper had been telling him for years, maybe that wasn’t the healthiest of lives.
That made Steve choke on his water and finally make him return Natasha’s glare.
After Bruce came to Earth bringing the news of Thanos, Tony didn’t doubt it, and immediately (meaning after hours of thoughts and second-guesses) he called Steve.
Tony grabbed Steve by the shoulders to look him in the eyes.
“Mmh yeah, I got a call a few hours ago that he had passed and I inherited his place,” Tony tried to say casually, but he was pretty sure Pepper knew him enough to know that it was a mask and he wasn’t that calm underneath.
Tony isn't exactly sure why he does what he does next, maybe it’s the easy ambient or the way Steve is looking at him. Determined, Tony stands up, walks to where Steve is sitting, and offers his hand.
They kept talking like that for almost an hour when Tony realized how late it was already. He said goodbye to both Clint and Natasha, the latter had joined their conversation after some time, and left a more than generous tip. He wanted to go to bed early, he had an early day ahead  after all.
“Go out with me,” Tony said looking into Steve’s blue eyes.
“Can’t you send the documents and I'll send them signed?” Tony asked, the last thing he wanted was to go on a 3 hour flight to a place that would only bring him bad memories. He had stopped keeping tabs on what was happening in Illinois after Ana’s death. There was nothing for him there.
He’s halfway in implementing a super sensitive circuit board when the doors for the workshop open and someone steps in.
After Tony wraps things up, he glances up at Steve only to find him with a curious face, mouthing at the words from the song still playing in the background.
Following the request, FRIDAY turns the music to a volume that is still distinguishable, but just barely.
“Welcome, what can I get you?” a friendly red-haired woman asked him once he had sat.
“Mmm,” Tony muttered to himself. “What about… Jarvis, he would've had a ball knowing there is a goat named after him,” he wasn't sure where the idea had come from, but it felt right.
When he had looked up Jarvis years after he had left home and was able to look back at what was once his life without feeling a pang of pain in his chest, he had expected to find them in a place like Hungary, since that was Ana’s home country. But to find them in a small town in Illinois of all places, had Tony shocked.
“Welcome again Tony,” she said with a kind smile directed at him before looking pointedly at Steve.
“He and you will be good for PJ,” she said quietly, cupping Tony’s cheek, “You can do this, Tony. I know you can. And…I’m happy for you. With him. You’re good together.”
“Hey,” he said quietly, slightly relieved when Steve didn’t flinch from him, “I’ve got you, sweetheart. I know—”
“It’s not a look.”
Tony sighed loudly and ushered PJ into the bathroom, rolling his eyes at Steve’s awkward I-don’t-know-what-to-do-in-this-situation shuffle in the bedroom.
He tugged on the rope to bring the horse forward, showing the crowd a person with a bag over their head and their hands tied behind their back. They did not move nor flinch when the crowd’s noise picked back up again, displaying either an incredible amount of self-control or they were able to sleep sitting upright.
“Do you think you can rest?” Tony asked next, his worry increasing at Steve’s half-shrug.
,” Steve said quietly, pushing his voice a bit to help Tony relax more, “Let us worry about the future. We will find a way to make Howard pay, I promise you. For now, you have to be strong for Peter, yeah? When the time comes, you will find healing. I will make sure of it.”
Nobody moved. Tony could feel the tension rising in the room, and even Clint was shooting him worried looks. It did not bother him though, for he knew if Steve was to try and argue with him now, the others would chastise him for getting so riled up right after his feral episode.
“You don’t cook for us, though.”
“Should we tell Miss Sarah?” Bucky’s voice piped up again, “She can do somethin’, right?”
“Buck! Knock it off!” Steve growled, “So
Peter always smelled of warm spice and apples, so he was easily recognizable by scent alone. Tony peeked open an eye to check on his sleeping boy and felt relieved to see that he had stayed asleep. Once Steve climbed into the bed, Tony curled up around his boy and let Steve hold them both, creating a little family cocoon. It would have been nice, but Peter began to stir and woke up, immediately bursting into tears once he realized who he was with.
PJ seemed to consider this, then nodded, tossing his book in favor of picking up the next. He handed it to Tony, snuggling back down into him and repositioning his elephant to look at the book.
because you’re
“Are you alright?” He said, “Do you need me to get Barnes or Natasha? You are wound tighter than Clint’s best bow. I am afraid you might snap at any second.”
PJ froze at that, confusion and relief flickering across his face as he pulled his arm back in to tuck under his body. Tony merely looked up and shared a look with Steve, seeing his concern mirrored on the Captain’s face.
Steve took another breath and shook his head; this wasn’t about Howard, this was about Tony, his wonderful, gorgeous, brilliant Tony, trying to wrestle with things he didn’t understand by going to one place he felt safe.
He turned, and there Steve was, moving into his space, callused and strong hands cupping his jaw before he could so much as get a word out. There was a second where Steve’s thumb stroked his cheekbone, but then he was there, chapped lips pressed against his own, taut and worried and slightly inexperienced, so Tony tilted his head slightly to slot them better together, kissing back to try and ease Steve’s nerves. He moved his hands up Steve’s chest to his shoulders and neck and face, tugging him in despite his need for air; someone groaned, and Tony was pretty sure it was himself, but it made his knees go weak anyway, forcing Steve to move his hands to his waist to keep him standing. Reluctantly, Steve pulled away first, both of them panting heavily as they pressed their foreheads together.
“That should last until transport. I’ll have one of the guards bring a replacement then,” she said, testing the bandage’s integrity before nodding her head, “Wake up the subject, you are to report back to your room.”
“Babysitter. Great,” Tony sighed, wincing as he shifted.
“It’s not our fault the door was unlocked,” Thor snorted, leading the parade out of the locker room, “He shoulda locked it if he didn’t want anyone in there.”
“Vis!” He called, only to yelp when the android phased into the shower.
Technically, it was not a lie. He made himself read through any medical literature he could find and regularly practiced using medical supplies so he was prepared for the days when Howard was wine drunk and angry. It happened often enough that he had become quite good at stitching the skin, apparently to the point that an actual doctor could recognize it. Thankfully, Bruce’s only response was to raise one eyebrow, not believing him but not pressing the matter either.
They traipsed back into the bowels of the castle and down a few flights of stone steps until Steve stopped at an unremarkable door and knocked four times, waiting for a beat between each knock. After a second, the door creaked open and Steve stepped aside, motioning for Tony to enter. He moved forward and paused, suddenly under assault by a room full of eyes. The entire conglomerate of Warlords stared back at him and he took a step back, only to bump up against Steve’s chest. Slowly, he turned his head up to look at the Prime Alpha and whimpered, unable to help clutching Peter a little tighter.
“Well,” Steve hummed, leaning down to whisper in Tony’s ear, “I really can’t believe I get to spend my life with you, love.”
here so I can fucking bite you,” Tony snapped, out of his mind with pleasure.
“Unconscious, but breathing. Good pulse, too. They must not have killed him before evacuating,” Natasha replied evenly, making quick work of wrapping the boy in the blanket, “We’ll have to tell—”
Steve merely smiled and kissed the top of his head, holding him close under the warm covers.
Tony blinked.
“Little rabbit?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
He forced himself to relax and breathed out, grunting as Steve slowly pushed in. Inwardly, he began to panic and wondered if Steve was right, but he forced it down and closed his eyes, concentrating on staying relaxed.
“You look like shit,” Tony said, having to bite back his smile from how proud he was of his friends.
“It’s not that big,” Tony protested weakly, plucking off his cottontail and headband, “It’s real empty.”
“Oh my god,” Steve muttered, putting a hand on his forehead, “You guys are so messed up.”
“Ms. Potts. Anthony has mentioned you often,” Mother answered, shaking her hand with a smile.
“Again?” He repeated, sheepishly following Tony back out of the room.
“Thank you, Bruce. You are a good friend to me,” Tony said honestly, reaching over to pat the doctor’s hand, “Much better than those knotheads, anyway.”
“Not yours. Only myself, Steve, Thor, Tony, Clint, and Natasha. Since PJ was a success, they didn’t bother attempting to harvest different DNA,” Bruce explained wearily, “So you, Sam, Rhodey, James, Vision, Scott, and T’Challa are all safe. At least, as far as we know. JARVIS has already updated Vision and T’Challa on the situation, and Tony’s going to call Rhodey once we’re done here.”
As he watched Tony turn on his heel and presumably escape to the workshop, Steve turned to gather up their melted ice cream, biting his lip bashfully as he cleaned the mess. He found himself unable to think of anything else, his mind wandering to the speckles of gold in Tony’s bright doe-eyes as he rode the elevator back up to his floor. Stepping out onto the plush carpet, Steve padded over to his coffee machine, using muscle memory to make himself a cup as he thought about Tony’s hands. It soon turned to his lips and his smile as Steve went to stand in front of the bay windows, casting his gaze out over modern Manhattan.
“I know that, Captain Obvious. Would you leave me alone, for like, ten seconds? I’d appreciate not being raked over the coals for saving your life.”
Steve snorted, so Tony turned around in his arms, smiling reassuringly up at him.
and vanilla these days, but you tried to take me for a ride, yeah?” Tony babbled, suddenly very aware of the silence in the room, “Where did you even learn to
“There it is, baby,” Tony managed, inwardly cursing the tears blurring his vision, “We’re hitched, its New York official—Wait, fuck, I need to get you a ring too—”
Silence.
“Dork,” Tony teased, squeezing his hand, “Ready?”
at that tongue, good lord.”
PJ pulled his shirt up over his face, hiding in the thin material. Feeling his heart break a little, Tony sat down, fully prepared to spend another few minutes attempting to calm the child.
Peter only babbled and cooed in response, which made Tony laugh all the more. He sighed and went to grab Steve his change of clothing, placing the bundle on the floor inside the bathroom before closing the door behind him to give Steve some privacy. Tony used the time waiting to find Peter’s wrap and tie to baby to his chest, figuring he may need both of his hands when they go see the prisoner.
After having parked in front of the house Tony found himself hesitantly opening the door with the keys he had been given. Inside, the house was somehow even more domestic. The whole house had dark wooden floors, white walls and it was so well furnished that there was not a doubt in Tony’s mind that this had been Ana’s doing.
"Come one, just one more," Steve said, practically begging Morgan while shoving the spoon full of green pudding that was supposed to taste of broccoli, pears, and peas, only for Morgan to turn her face like she had been doing for the past fifteen minutes. "It's super yummy, see," he said while shoving the spoon to his mouth only to immediately take the thing out. Who the hell thought this was a flavor babies would wanna eat.
in front of the blond, blue eyed man before him) “I’m Tony by the way and you may want to start by telling me what you think you are doing inside Jarvis’ barn.”
"Ned got one and he brought it to class the other day," Peter said excitedly.
But that’s exactly what happened.
That made them lose their excitement a bit.
Tony thought with a smile on his face.
“Everybody knew him, he came around the diner everyday,” Clint said fondly. “Well, let me tell you it’s a pleasure meeting the famous Anthony,” Clint gave him his hand, which Tony gladly shook.
“I’m Steve, I used to help Jarvis with the animals once Ana passed,“ Steve said, giving Tony his hand to shake. “I wasn't expecting you to come all the way here.”
That was one thing Tony would forever be grateful about, Jarvis died surrounded by people who love him. According to Clint, Jarvis was good friends with everyone and had also managed a barn next to his place that kept him occupied. Just from what both of them had described to him, Tony was actually excited to visit the place, which was now his, and make plans to keep it functioning.
“Dying,” Clint’s voice came from where his head was buried in Bucky’s stomach.
“Hey there, darling,” Steve murmured, gently pulling down the top of Peter’s dress to better see the babe’s face, “Did you behave while we were gone? I am sure you did.”
“Y’know, he really likes the reactor,” Pepper said softly, a smile curving her lips, “If he’s still having problems with the dark, why don’t you make him his own nightlight? Keep daddy close.”
“Yeah. Yes, please do,” he said wearily.
“Away from you?” Tony said in amusement, grinning as Steve’s eyes widened once he realized what he’d said, “But—ah, thank you. I—yeah. I know sometimes I struggle with that whole thing. I’m getting better at it. But it’s good to know that someone’s in my corner.”
He pointed to the side of Steve at the wall.
Tony has to deal with Alpha pissing contests (metaphorically speaking) and uses his bonding ritual to drown out Rhodey's news.
He was immediately dragged out of his seat and into Steve’s lap, held tight against the Alpha’s chest. Steve shushed him and rubbed his back, confused as to why Tony was suddenly scenting something awful. He looked across to Rhodey, who only shook his head and stood, reaching over to run his hand through Tony’s hair and squeeze his shoulder. Steve watched him leave the room, waiting until he was sure he was gone before pulling Tony away from his chest.
“Oh, hey, none of that, being grumpy doesn’t solve problems,” Tony snorted, gently patting the boy’s back, “Only one of us gets to be grumpy, and that’s me, at all times.”
Steve’s sad eyes peeked out from under wet lashes, making Tony feel like an absolute jackass. Slowly, he untied Steve’s skirt and let it drop to the ground, holding onto Steve’s hands so he could step out of it and into the bath. Steve grunted and swore as he sat, no doubt achy and sore from struggling against his bindings all morning. Tony stepped in and slid down behind him, unable to help his cheeky smile when Steve stared at him.
“Oh, sweetheart, oh love,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony into a hug once his husband started to get choked up again, “I’m here, I’m right here, that’s enough for now, okay? No more, I want you to get
Distant rumbling, deep and prolonged like a growl of hunger.
“…Hm? I’m here, I’m here, just spaced,” he managed, forcing himself to concentrate back on PJ, “You okay, kiddo? Huh?”
“Yeah! I heard your house’s got, like, two hundred rooms,” Sam exclaimed, hanging up his costume with a grin, “And that you got your own theatre and
Comments and kudos are really appreciated! Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
He finally edged close enough to the kid to carefully reach out and place a tentative finger on his knee, not moving when PJ looked up, completely startled. He scrambled back an inch or two, chest heaving as he frantically looked around, only to have his gaze settle back on Tony.
group training; mostly because he was usually partnered with Natasha and she easily laid him out on the mat. It was much more appealing to stay put in the warm bed with his baby, so he growled when Steve tried to tug him up.
, Tony.”
“If I don’t do it, the bullets get stuck in me and I have to fish ‘em out later,” Steve grumbled, absentmindedly skirting a hand over his abdomen as if to feel the ghostly remains of the bullets, “He knows that. And this isn’t the first mission I go home looking like swiss cheese—besides, I only took out the really bad ones.”
“Oh. Okay. C’mon, then. Your bathroom is this door back here, okay?”
Thanks for sticking with me for this journey. If you liked it, please leave kudos and a comment, and be sure to check out my other works.
It clicked.
“Why are we doing this again?”
,” he begged, “What happened? Are you mad at me for trying--”
about to acknowledge. Instead, he rolled his head down to look at the babe attached to his nipple, finally quiet as he suckled his meal.
fast. But that’s how you kind of operate, so we’re trying to stay flexible, here. You need to keep calm for PJ, though. You only have to last until bedtime. Then you can freak out.”
“Wha? Tony?! Why?!?”
Tony just hummed an affirmation into Steve’s shoulder before pulling back to ask, “Can I get you to say that you were wrong again? I want to make it my ring tone.” Steve couldn’t help but laugh.
Bucky bit his lower lip. If Steve untied him he wasn’t sure he could resist taking Tony right now, especially if Tony kept looking at his like that. “God dammit!”
“We’re not going to judge you Steve.” Natasha whispered while shooting Bruce a pointed look. “We just want to help.”
Well, there doesn’t seem to be any danger, so he might as well ask JARVIS.
Heading down to the lab he could see that all the windows were blacked out.
“Ghnn….” A growl escaped his lips as he went to rest his upper body on top of Tony. “Oh God Kitten, you feel so good.” He pulled out a bit to try and thrust more of himself into Tony who’s face with getting his blissed out expression again.
“Hey, have either of you seen Tony?”
“Even I can’t mess up spaghetti.” Clint waved her off.
Taking the elevator, his rode it to the penthouse.
“I’m sorry,” Tony blurted, hoping that that will at least clear some of the devastation away, but all it did was make his boys furrow their brow and look more distressed and confused.
There wasn’t that much in the bottle to begin with. Maybe 20 pills, about enough for 4 days. Tony could just feel a migraine coming on. He would have just picked the pills back up but with his leg the way it is, he doesn’t think he can get into the positions required to fish all the pills back out. He considered going to Bruce for more but now that he was in the workshop he didn’t really want to leave. He could feel the break up starting to sink in, he could feel crushing loss, and depression fall on him like a pail of ice water. He went to the sink, grabbed the whisky from underneath and took a huge swig. This will work just fine for the pain, both the psychical and the emotional.
“If you’d like, I have record of what you said Captain Rogers,” JARVIS chipped in. He recognized what the team was trying to do here, and he was all to happy to help if it meant his creator would be happy again. “Due to security protocols I’m not allowed to release the footage, but I can tell you what was said based of the transcribed information.”
“Can you at least let him know I’m outside?”
“Steve? Steve! Calm down! You’re hyperventilating!” Natasha’s firm voice broke through his spiralling thoughts, and he suddenly realized he’s now sitting on the floor crying. “Oh Steve.” Natasha sighed. It hasn’t been the best day. Before she could get Steve to calm down further Bruce cut in again.
“Steve ugh, lettt go. Ggget off of meee. I’m fine…fine. I don’t nnneed you to llook after me anymor…..” He tried to shove Steve away, but Steve being a super soldier and all, it wasn’t going in Tony’s semi-alcohol affected body’s way. God Damn It! He didn’t need Steve’s PITY!
“Tony?!” Steve called out as soon as the doors parted.
Based of the expression on Tony’s face, he looked like he was having a spiritual experience. It looked even better since Tony had dried cum, drool, and lube all over his face. It came as a surprise to Bucky that Tony could speak anything at all.
But as Steve got into the elevator and turned back to face Tony as the doors closing, Tony whispers, “Goodbye, Steve” while looking at the floor. Steve’s insides twisted because to him, it felt like Tony was saying it like this was the end.
Before he could squeak in response, Clint and Natasha followed up with a “we second that notion.”
It only took him about a second to take in the whole situations. Pills all over the ground and a passed out Tony with tears running down his face with a few massive bottles of Whiskey beside him. Steve’s blood ran cold.
“Natasha move out of the way or I’m going to move you”
” Tony looked completely wrecked gasping for breath as he kept trying to buck into Steve’s thrusts despite the unyielding hold on his hips.
“That’s not true…” Steve replied so quickly that Bruce realized that it must be an automatic response for whenever Tony talked bad about himself. He smiles, feeling a lot better knowing that despite what had happened, Steve cares about Tony deeply and doesn’t for a second think that the things Tony says about himself are true. None the less he lifts his hand to silence Steve.
Unless, of course, he figured out a way to build one and pleaded with Steve to test it for him.
Natasha put her hands over her ears as the room descended into chaos. Bucky tried to leap at Tony, but Steve stepped forward in time to catch him, giving Tony time to duck behind him.
“It’ll wash out. Right?”
The boy nodded, and with Steve’s help, got himself comfortable in the hospital bed, tucked in next to Tony. His elephant was clutched tight to his chest, nearly taking up as much room as the child was, but Tony paid it no mind, pulling the sheets up over them both.
, Tony thought, sidling up closer to Steve.
Post-mission.
The bond throbbed frantically as Steve strained to push more of his arm through the bars, but to no avail. The only way he was going to be able to get at Tony was if he got out of the cell, and the remains of the manacles on the floor reminded Tony exactly why he was not going to open the door. As a compromise, he grabbed Steve’s hand and pushed so their hands were inside the cell since Tony’s arms were thinner and could easily slip between the bars. He laced their fingers together and squeezed, hoping that it would help to ground Steve.
“Steve? Darling, what is wrong? Did you have a bad dream?” He asked, as though he had not been plagued with horrific dreams only a few moments prior.
A sudden surge of longing spread through his chest at the term, causing Tony to almost choke on his breath. He turned to the ginger, painful fondness evident in the tired wrinkles around his eyes.
“Shhh, love,” he tried, rasping each word, “Steve will help, I promise—”
“…Papa?”
“J, where’s T’Challa?” He asked, stepping into the elevator.
Having set the boy down on the floor, Tony made quick work of getting PJ cleaned up and changed, awarding JARVIS a few brownie points for thinking ahead on the training pants front. Once PJ—and the elephant—were clean enough, Tony scooped them both back up, nabbing the tissue box to take with them.
. Your tummy just didn’t like what you ate. We’ll get something nice and warm for you for dinner and you’ll feel a lot better, alright?” he soothed, re-tucking the blankets around PJ and his elephant, “Don’t worry, darling. You tired? Want to sleep a little?”
“With you talking into my neck like that, it’s hard not to.”
“I think I am as well,” Steve said, grinning at Tony’s eye roll, “What? I may not have been able to understand you at first, but even the rasp of your voice--”
“You read the rescue mission one, didn’t you,” he accused, pouting when Steve giggled, “You bitch, you are
“Go on. I’ll bring your coffee. Black, right?”
Turning, the Captain noticed a small spin-dial attached to the wall. Curious, he turned it all the way up.
Steve answered him and waved a hand toward Tony, who eyed the two men warily.
Dashing Steve from his head, Tony heard PJ before he ever arrived at the boy’s door; hurrying up his pace, he nearly flung the door open, seeing the child writhing in twisted pain, eyes shut tight as small whimpers escaped his mouth.
“Tony?”
Tony moved his head to look at the ceiling, but before he could focus on something to distract him, gentle fingers rubbed over his hole and he gasped, unable to tell what was worse: the pain or the mortification.
betrothed to him.”
,” PJ repeated, squirming in Tony’s hold.
“Yeah, just give me a moment.”
Tony quickly translated and raised an eyebrow at Rhodey, who smiled quite strangely for someone who had just been told that his attacker might attack him again if needed.
“Scary?” Tony said, turning onto his side as PJ curled up to him, reaching up to tug on his shirt over his reactor, “Yeah. I kinda get that. Though, I mean, you’re
“At ease, Captain. I have a message for all of you, not just your husband,” Fury answered, clearly unimpressed with Steve’s display.
I am terrified. Any reasonable person would be.”
“Hey,” Pepper said shyly when he walked up, “You have fun?”
“And that’s why we’re coming over,” Bucky said smoothly, throwing his arm over Tony’s shoulders, “We’re gonna all stay in ya empty mansion and eat cake until Miss Sarah comes to get us.”
“Kissy!” PJ’s voice shrieked, making Tony yelp.
“I… apologize for not seeing how distraught you were over Peter’s feeding. I suppose I wrote off your response as being affected by your illness, not understanding that you were genuinely upset over it. After the Prime came to me in tears, I realized what had happened and talked with him about it. We intended on having this conversation earlier, but when we came to find you, Bruce had just left you to sleep. The three of us talked for a while and decided it would be best if this was all resolved as soon as possible,” Thor said, his voice becoming more gentle as he talked, “I wanted to apologize first, though. Not only for not recognizing your ailment but for also not keeping my promise. I should have stepped in and said something.”
“When are we getting cake, Tony?” Thor piped up, “Acting is tiring work and I desire sustenance.”
“It does,” Tony grumbled, “Our life is pretty much a movie, Natalie.”
“So you are being possessive by attempting to keep my body hidden while leaving yours out on display? How is that fair? Why should I wear something to keep others’ gazes away when you refuse to do the same?”
“I think it’d be wisest to do it sooner rather than later, but you should probably have someone more qualified sitting in on it. Or, at least, do it somewhere where the cameras can accurately record facial expressions and bodily movements since he might not be comfortable with a stranger sitting with him and asking questions. If you want, I could try to set something up. Get the two of you some questions to ask him and all that,” he said slowly, sharing a look with Tony, “It might help with easing his panic…or, it might cause him to have worse panic from reliving whatever happened in the compound.”
“That’s trademarked,” Tony said, putting on a pot of coffee and setting out mugs before heading over to the small group, “What’ve we got?”
The sound of the kitchen door opening drew Tony from his thoughts and he looked up, already beginning to salivate once he saw the full plates in Bruce’s hands. He barely let Bruce set the plate down before diving in and shoveling the food into his mouth. Sure, it was only rice and beans and some fruit, but
Relaxing into it, Steve finally sighed and nodded, wiggling a bit to get comfortable on the futon. He licked his lips as he watched Tony unzip him and pull his heavy cock out, not even bothering to pull his slacks down. Immediately, he reached down to grab Tony’s hand and shake his head.
“You can sleep if you want, we’ve got you,” Steve murmured under his breath, just to Tony, “We’ll be here when you wake up.”
. I should have gotten over him by now. But I haven’t—”
“We going? Alright, I’m comin’,” He sighed, standing with a grunt, “You still want your drink?”
“What?” he breathed, looking up at Tony with wide eyes.
“He is not
The question lingered in the air for a moment as Steve ran his hands up and down Tony’s back, trying to help the other relax.
“Don’t bruise easily. Serum,” Steve panted, smiling dopily at Tony’s pout, “Come back up here. You can give that attention later.”
fight to have you, even if it happens to be against your closest friend.”
“If you so much as step out that door this
Thor hurriedly translated and Steve nodded, scooting closer to them. He wrapped an arm around Tony and supported the arm that was holding Peter, using Tony as a little marionette so he could position Peter right to drink from the wineskin. It took a little finagling, but after a moment, he could properly tip the wineskin down. Peter drank from it, only to thrash his arms about and wail louder, causing fat tears to roll down his plump cheeks.
He did not like the silence.
“What?” Tony asked, suddenly realizing that the others were silent and staring at him.
“—you have not formally bonded yet. That does not excuse his behavior, of course. He is, as the Lieutenant says, a possessive idiot.”
, he thought to himself, staring at his disheveled form in his floor-to-ceiling mirror,
“Please try to keep this one clean, okay?”
After a quarter of an hour, JARVIS’ voice cut through the silence, “Sir, Captain Rogers is approaching the lab with the child.”
“No,” Tony interrupted, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, “Marriage is good. I want this, I want
time I thought I was going to watch you die and there was nothing I could do, and it was all my fault—”
“Hey, hey, everything’s okay, pumpkin,” Tony soothed, reaching over to pet PJ’s hair, “You can’t come up yet, I’m sorry, but I’m right here. I’m okay, darling. Where’s Papa, hm? You chase him off?”
better at this—”
“Let us get dressed, and while you take a moment to settle in your bassinet, I am going to try and get rid of this monster on my face.”
His voice died down as they all moved to the ring. Tony was not too interested anyway, as he and Steve would most likely brawl for their lives for the hell of it. It was merely another method to wrestle and get sweaty with his bonded: nothing he had not done already.  The creak of the door drew his attention and he smiled, only to wince when his stomach growled loudly.
“Did—did you call them milky tits?” he asked hoarsely, licking his suddenly chapped lips.
“What--what has happened since I have been gone?” He asked, translating quickly for Steve to keep him in the loop.
the time.”
“Zero out of five stars, J. Think you can get us home?” Tony asked, idly tapping the wheel.
He left Steve on his own and went to peek at the baby, relieved to find him dreaming away. It always worried him when he left Peter alone for too long, but the distraction gave Steve a few minutes to compose himself and redress. Once he heard the water start to drain, Tony went back into the bathroom.
“Just a little longer, I promise,” he soothed as he reached over to give Steve a good scrub, “Peter will be happy to see you, yeah? I am sure he misses your arms. He always looks so comfortable when he is bundled up with you.”
“Bonds strengthen when you use them,” Steve explained, spreading some sort of cream on his fingertips, “My ma… my mother taught me that with enough concentration and with good intention, you can push feelings into your bondmate. I always thought it was for emotional comfort, but using it to relax your muscles so you are not in as much pain also works.”
“Actually, it’s the opposite of cheating. It’s being faithful to a promise.”
“I do not trust him, Tones,” Rhodey said with a shrug, unconcerned with Tony’s anger, “I want to make sure I know the situation thoroughly before I decide if I approve of him or not.”
Nodding, the Captain crouched down, easily sitting crisscross on the floor. He tried to smile at PJ, but even Tony could tell that he was highly uncomfortable with the entire situation.
“Shhh, darling, you’re
“You’s supposed to do the dishes after dinner, young man,” Steve was saying, one hand on his hips as he waggled his finger at Bucky’s face.
It was quiet for a moment, until Steve’s shoulders began to shake. He laughed, bending over at the waist to put his head in his hands as he shook. Tony merely stared at him, dumbfounded.
Please be patient between chapters. Things are a little crazy right now and it is taking me longer to write than I initially thought.
He paused awkwardly, tapping his fingers on the table as he thought through his next sentence.
“I feel terrible about--about everything,” Steve confessed, “I may not have been in control of my body, but my mind could still hold a thought, and I wondered--”
“Oh, so now ya bringing other people onta that train?”
He picked his head up when Bruce stood, allowing the doctor to help him up from his chair so he could find comfort in the man’s gentle touches. Together, they walked down to the Prime’s bedroom, where Tony could finally put Peter down in his bassinet for a nap.
“What—What is happening?” Tony asked, trying to keep the fear out of his voice as he bundled Peter back up, holding the baby close to him in a display of protectiveness.
“I do

, which, to a bunch of pre-teens, was the fucking funniest thing they’d ever heard. He was already aware of and knew about sex and what his body was doing hormonally and physically, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to innocently ask Coulson absurd questions.
“Tony, could I speak with you for a moment? Outside?”
me to notice—”
, you are no king! You are just as much of a savage as the world
“Apologize?” Steve echoed, making Tony snort in disbelief.
He put it down and removed the last drawing, pleasantly surprised to see that it was fully colored, shaded and inked. It was him, but in the Iron Man suit, laughing up at Steve, his cowl off and his face sweaty but happy, looking down with love and adoration, his wedding ring standing out on his un-gloved hand that rested on Tony’s waist.
yourself? You’ve survived so much and been so
“I know, Sir. I know. I wish I could have done more to protect you,” He interrupted, causing Tony to look up in surprise, “I wish Ana and I had been more perceptive. We always thought something was going on, but because your Mother told us differently, we had no reason to believe she was lying—”
“Pick a flavor,” Nat sighed, rolling her eyes.
At least five of the ribs had massive knots of bone in the middle of them, as if someone had stuck the two pieces of ribs into a marshmallow to hold them together.
“No, not at all,” Steve said hesitantly, “But it hurts now, and if it hurts less after, then I’ll do it.”
rich?”
Natasha rolled her eyes and Clint laughed, but at Steve’s grimace, Tony looked down at the unconscious child in his lap. Since finding the boy, he had not taken a moment to really take a good look at the child; shifting him slightly, Tony looked over his features. He was pale, but not like Steve, yet not as tanned as he himself was.
“Green tea.”
“Drink. I could dampen a cloth for your forehead, but I can only do so much when your heat is coming on,” Bruce said apologetically and held out his waterskin.
This… was less than ideal. Really, it was terrible, awful, and all kinds of bad, but Tony wasn’t about to admit that to the team, and
PJ giggled and Tony felt his world stop, throwing his brain 800 miles per hour due east.
“Bed, Tony,” he said quietly, “Yes?”
As soon as he pulled out the name, Tony’s heart sank into his stomach.
Seeing as he was surrounded by three other guards, was wounded, and also carrying PJ, he wisely decided to obey the guards, but kept his head up to look around. He could count steps in his sleep, so Tony was careful to be over-observant, noting that they passed what looked like a medical wing and a storage bay before being led up what could only be described as a grand staircase.
“Can’t we Hulk it up?” Tony asked, sitting on the edge of the table.
He was laid on something soft and a coldness came over his forehead and eyes: a cloth? It was soothing for the moment but did nothing to alleviate the curdling fire in his belly. Annoyed, he tried to strip himself in a desperate attempt to get cool. Disembodied hands took over and he laid bare on what he assumed was a bed, panting and shaking as he waited for the chill of the room to soak into his bones.
Unable to help himself, Tony leaned down for one last kiss before setting his sights on the Alpha in the room. Steve squirmed under his full gaze.
“I wonder if you are actually hungry or if you only enjoy being fed,” Tony said quietly, wrapping both arms around Peter as Steve stood to take the empty plate away.
“Looks like its just you and me, kiddo,” Tony murmured, petting the boy’s hair, “Sorry Papa up and left like that. I won’t do that to you, I promise. Now come up here, I can’t lean down, and I want to kiss your forehead.”
Tony forced a smile of his own and watched Steve walk off to the kitchen, only letting it drop when he was sure the other man was out of sight. He did
“All I wanted and
I get to spend my life with
,” Steve scolded playfully, mindful of their son as he nudged Tony’s nose and kissed him.
Dreams of bloodied eagles falling from the sky had him tossing and turning all night. Pained whimpers fell from his lips until something forced him to wake up with a sharp gasp. He quickly realized that it was Steve’s hand on his arm that had startled him, so he relaxed back down onto his makeshift bed with a sigh.
was for
“You two better keep this to yourselves,” Steve said seriously, drawing himself up to his full height and putting on his Captain America voice, “Understand, soldiers?”
Steve nodded and sat back in his seat, coughing once more for good measure. He sniffled and grunted, rolling his eyes when Tony giggled next to him.
He gurgled the rest of the word and spasmed forward, spilling another load into Tony. It was genuinely painful to come so much, but his biology demanded it of him.
“But I should have outright made it clear to him that I was going to be bonded to you. He knows how I feel about--about being an Alpha’s property, let alone the single Alpha I was raised to cower in fear from. I know you just want what is best, but for gods’ sake, has it occurred to you that you could be
“I’ll be on the futon, okay?” he murmured, “Come cuddle with me when you get a break.”
“He deserved it,” Tony said out loud, more of to himself than Peter, “He should feel guilty—right, love?”
” Tony exclaimed, sighing out in relief when he recognized the man, “Steve, I was on
“Yeah. Sorry you guys can’t stay overnight, but I’m not ‘llowed to have girls overnight and Mother didn’t want me to make them feel left out,” Tony admitted, shrugging off Bucky so he could wrestle himself into his clothes, “Plus, Father’s still mad over the last time you guys came over and tried to get into his study.”
The room turned to look at Steve, who shrugged while scrolling through his phone.
to do.
advanced super soldiers could prove worrisome.”
He refused to look toward Steve when the Alpha tried to comfort him. Peter needed him and he was going to pay attention to his sweet boy, whether or not Steve liked it. The bond throbbed in his chest, flooding his senses with Steve’s worry and nausea; it hurt to feel his bondmate’s rejection.
“I know you can. I want to carry you,” Steve murmured into his ear, “Don’t worry. Nobody cares anyway, and I’ll even walk in the alley so you don’t feel so exposed. Okay? Let me do this for you.”
he thought to himself,
“What? I can—I can do this parenting thing,” He protested, keeping one arm curled around PJ so the boy wouldn’t fall, “Besides, you’re hurt—”
“You’re oddly open about your emotions today,” he said, causing Tony to laugh.
Being trapped in a hospital bed means talks have to ensue.
“You have to feed him. I cannot,” he said, voice thick, “Please—”
. Jesus, Steve, you ran out of there like a bat out of hell. You scared the kid enough that he tried to run after you.”
“PJ called him Daddy.”
He flicked his eyes up to Steve in time to see the blond shrug, the light flush on his cheeks not going unnoticed. However, Tony kept that to himself, not wanting to accidentally embarrass Steve any more than he already had. Instead, he let his eyes drift over the Captain’s face, mentally cataloging the tired creases in the corners of his eyes and the laugh lines that stretched with a fond smile as he looked down at the clearly exhausted child. The picture was oddly Madonna-like, though Tony felt like he should probably go to confessional for comparing Steve to the Virgin Mary.
“Damn straight. Right behind you, Cap.”
“She ain’t
, to the point that it might have been mildly annoying. Hell, he would have taken silent agreement over this; it made him feel like he had to choose between them, which really meant choosing between Peter’s safety and Rhodey, and there was no question who he would pick. Troubled by the thought, Tony looked away from Steve, closing his eyes to try to fend off tears.
After passing Peter off to Rhodey with a kiss on the babe’s cheek, Tony headed over to take the knuckle wrappings from Bucky and began tying them around his hands. He allowed Bucky to inspect them, then turned to face the ring. Steve winked at him from where he was already nursing a split lip in his corner.
“Back pocket. Grab the papers.”
of them, understand? They are supposed to be a testament to the shit—”
“…I love you?”
, he thought grimly, tossing his head back and squeezing his eyes shut.
He burst into laughter, only to gasp and put his hand over his mouth when Tony whirled around and glared at him.
getting off to that, you weren’t legal, Tony,” he tried, only to whine at his husband’s smug look, “It’s true! It’s—It’s not—”
“McCoy, no surprise. Apparently, Erik put his own kid in, Pietro,” Clint said, nodding toward a scrawny boy with grey hair dressed in the Xavier school’s classic yellow and black soccer uniform.
,” Steve sighed, “I warned you this would happen if you did not let me take my time with you. There is no need to feel so bad about it, little rabbit. You are in pain; let me help you.”
Tony tried to go for a comforting smile, but PJ merely sniffled, reaching up to rub at his eyes. Before he could react, Steve had already squatted down in front of the boy, reaching up slowly to put a hand on his knee.
Tony exhaled loudly, rolling his eyes as PJ grabbed up his elephant—the one he had thrown at Tony—and settled himself between the two adults, wiggling until he was comfortable.
Bruce and Clint immediately stood, at which Tony snorted. He turned to ask Steve which he wanted to do, mouth hanging open as the blond grinned sheepishly from his standing position.
“Nothing bad, my friend. Simply a good meal and good company—you have yet to be introduced to the others, no? I will introduce you while the Prime fixes you a plate.”
Ignoring the nearly unbearable squeeze of anxiety in his chest, Tony leaned down to press a brief kiss to PJ’s temple before standing, giving the boy one last look as he turned to head over to his own room. Closing the door behind him, he threw his mind into getting-ready-for-bed mode, getting lost in his routine to avoid thinking. Once he was in his silk pajamas and standing in his room, Tony closed his eyes, feeling his heart beating erratically behind his reactor. Slowly, he backed up to the wall and slid down to the floor, drawing up his knees to his chest.
“Right, yes, of course,” Steve interrupted quickly, “I am almost done. No worries.”
“More so, my friend. We knew we had to keep it secret. She worked as long as she could until her belly was swollen enough to be seen. Then, she hid out at the cabin until the birth. The only reason we ever managed to pull this off is my closest confidant, Rhodey, stepped in to pretend to be her Mate. I do not know how I did it, but I managed to make a type of perfume out of his scent, so she always smelled of him and kept other Alphas from getting too close to discover the ruse. When it came time for the birth, our other friend, Pepper, offered to be the midwife.”
“Well good, I love you too” Steve’s words broke Bucky out of his trance. “Now that you guys made up by actually communicating, lets move on to the fun part of the evening shall we?” He teased but Bucky could see the genuine happiness over what had just transpired.
“Steve what are you doing?”
“How come your insecurities aren’t equally as important Steve? A relationship is about being equals. That doesn’t sound equal to me.” Natasha pushed again. Steve would be annoyed if she wasn’t so good at finding flaws with his logic.
“I though we were arguing over what happened this morning with..uh.. the green goblin.” He hadn’t really wanted to bring it up but it’s now or this whole thing blowing up in his face later.
The divide of 70 years showed for instance in Steve’s concept of Justice, his concept of truth, his conception of politics, and of course, his concept of love. To him, justice is getting a trial, there’s only one truth, and matters of politics are simply solved. To him, love is eternal, and only a matter of emotion. Tony is from an era and generation that’s much more cynical. Not just because of his age but the fact that he’d been exposed to more than a typical person on the street, and that’s not even mentioning he was a genius.
“Yeah but I still don’t need to go bother him with this. Now that I know I can handle it, I swear.”
Natasha made a hand motion for JARVIS to continue.
Bucky was out of his seat before the restrains had completely opened and charged the bed. In any other circumstance Bucky would have tackled Steve to the ground for being a little shit and grappled with him a while. However right now after a Month without sex. He needed to be in Tony like yesterday.
Steve raised an eyebrow.
“Yeah we’re back together.” He whispers into Steve’s ear and then they smiled at each other.
Steve slowly pulled the vibrator out of Tony making a show of it. Bucky swallowed hard as he looked at how Tony’s hole was already wet and drooling before Steve had even started. The muscles of his entrance fluttering but wasn’t able to close completely.
“Hey Buck,” He tone was casual and Bucky would have turned to glare if he’s eyes weren’t stuck sliding over Tony’s gorgeous body. “JARVIS mentioned you asked for me? What did you need?”
Then his phone chimed on top of his stack of forms. He checked it. It was probably Tony.
Tony bucked his hips again but managed to get out. “Does it look like I was a willing participant in this? I’m in the same boat you are”
Steve had said, and he can admit that struck him somewhere deep, causing all his insecurities to escape the bubble that Steve had carefully packed them in. There was no way he was getting away without a conversation about feelings, but at least there’s the possibility of angry makeup sex. Which is why he was trying to be good by resting in the bed, he needed to soften Steve up before they had this conversation. Tony decided to send Steve a few texts to hopefully soften him up even more before he came home.
which led to frustration because there weren’t kids around to lecture. Thus, no matter what Tony’s own opinions on these pet names were, he must use them. Tony can practically see Steve’s expression when ever he even thought about pet names.
“I’m obligated to ask if it’s edible?” Natasha teased.
wanted to do. Demanding he show Steve the 21th century. Wanting Tony to make things for him, for the whole team, yet still have time for him, SHIELD, his company. Not to mention the countless times he was arguing with Tony. No, times when he had yelled at Tony as Tony just stood there. Has he been exhausting Tony this whole time? A burden? A leech on Tony’s existence? Tony did look so exhausted. Is that why Tony doesn’t want him anymore?
them to talk when Tony felt better. He wanted Tony to know he couldn’t get away without having their conversation no matter how long he prolongs it. It was Steve’s way of making sure that Tony would come to him when he was feeling better on his own, because if he didn’t, Steve would come find him. He tried to let Tony know that Tony wasn’t alone, even if at the end this didn’t work out in Steve’s favor and they broke up. He has Steve. He’ll always have Steve.
Tony froze. WHAT?
Steve could feel tears going down his cheeks but they were from joy, so he couldn’t complain. He grabs Tony and pulls Tony into his arms. However, when he goes to give Tony a kiss, Tony turned his head away and Steve was immediately reminded of the situation as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over his head. “Tony, you can’t serious have just said all that only to still want to break up with me? I don’t think that’s the best way to reassure me of what you just said.” Even to his own ears he sounded incredulous.
Steve was really trying to get through the paperwork now, but Tony really wasn’t helping.
Natasha laid a comforting hand on his knee. “It’s okay Steve. Like I said, we aren’t here to judge. We just want to fix it. It’s not like you knew what he was thinking and the full extent of what was going on either. Mistakes happen, and yes this one is a particularly bad mistake.” Steve groans again. “but what’s important now is to move past it and clear up the misunderstanding.”
When Bucky woke back up he had a slight moment of disorientation followed by a moment of panic as he realized he was strapped to a chair. When he opened his eyes it was to the sight of Tony strapped to a bed. He’s blood ran cold as he yelled, “Tony!”
Steve kneed down next to Tony. Training automatically kicking in, he instinctively checked for breathing and pulse. Steve felt just slightly lighter when he found both. But Tony’s life may still be in danger. Steve start shaking Tony aggressively while calling his name, he needed to wake him and possibly get him to throw up anything residual in his stomach.
Screw this paperwork. He’ll do it later….. probably. He noted his phone had 8% battery left, so he knew he wouldn’t be able to continue his conversation with Tony for much longer. He typed out a quick reply telling Tony that he was on his way, made sure it sent and shut the contraption off to conserve batteries in case there was an emergency.
Bucky couldn’t help but think he was beautiful but then his eyes flicked upward from Tony’s hole to try and see his face even though it wasn’t possible from this angle. Then he noticed it. There was a slight bulge protruding from Tony’s abdominal that raised and fell with Steve’s thrusts. Fuck…
In the end, he decided that he’d leave the decision to Tony on what he wanted to do with the room. It was the least he could do for Tony. In the mean time, he didn’t want to be more of an imposition than he’d already been, so he went back to his old room and started shucking off his clothe, letting them drop to the floor in the mostly empty room. As he lowered himself to the bed, he looked at the night stand where he’s old phone charger sat. He should probably charge his phone in case SHIELD needed him. Steve reached into his pant pocket and pulled out the phone, plugged it into the charger and turned it back on in case someone called.
Steve could just feel his guilt and regret instantly turn to self-loathing at the scene in front of him. Tony passed out with a few bottles of liquor around him and pills all over the ground. Had he caused Tony to do this? Was it his unjustified anger, his inability to control his emotion that had hurt Tony so badly? As these thoughts raced, he distantly saw himself trying to break the glass with his fist. But after several strikes and what was definitely a broken knuckle later, not even a crack or scratch existed on the glass’s surface. Panic was starting to turn into hysteria when he heard Natasha, and Clint race down the stairs in his direction follow by a much slower Bruce.
“Sure, I can Cap.” Tony had popped his P and stepped away from him. “It’s not your job to care anymore is it?” Despite himself Steve couldn’t help but be frustrated. Yelling from Tony Steve knows how to handle, but when he’s fake cheer soaked in sarcasm, Steve just… He knows he’s wrong. He does! But does Tony have to rub it in? Taunt him with his mistakes? He’s heckles started to rise again, defensive because he still had a good point initially, even if he was being a total hypocrite.
“Tony, I ….”
“It’s okay Steve…” He whispers. “You were completely right. This is over, this relationship is done.”
Tony rubbed his eyes on Bruce’s shoulder in a yes motion before pulling away to just rest his forehead of Bruce’s shoulder. He was still facing down not meeting Bruce’s eye, but his mouth wasn’t buried in flesh anymore. “
Sighing Natasha tried a different approach. “When Tony has insecurities would you rather he talks to you or us?”
Suddenly Tony’s face and eyes shut down and closed off. No, NO! That wasn’t what he wanted, wasn’t what he was trying and failing to tell Tony. He cursed himself for his inadequacies and inability to articulate himself the way Tony could. He wanted to do better. He needed to do better. But as he looked up to try again, Tony’s expression turned loving as he stared into Steve’s eyes.
Tony continued to squirm but did manage to be more coherent now that he wasn’t out of his mind in pleasure. “I want...nh..I want your huge cock Steve! I want to worship you cock with my body. I want you to…. I want you to ram it into me so hard I won’t be able to walk for a week and feel you every time I sit. I want you to stretch me so loose I don’t think my asshole will ever close again….ugh Steve I want you to fuck me until I’m screaming and…..I want you to come inside me so many times that I can’t hold it all and it leaks from me or it starts getting pushed out every time you thrust…god Steve….
“He wishes to know if you are afraid of him, Tony,” Thor translated quietly, “We can smell your fear, friend.”
“I’ll try to do it more often, then,” Steve said softly, a dopey smile filling his face.
“No, no. It happened too fast for you to have said anything. I do not blame you at all, Thor. You have been so good to me these last few days, I am not sure I even
“Yeah,
to ask you on a date here, do you have to laugh—”
“He thought you were responsible for my nipples being so red and raw,” Tony said, managing a smile when Steve’s face turned red, “I told him the truth.”
“You look fine, Mom and Dad,” he sighed, rolling his eyes, “Really. It’s just a dumb play anyway. Once it's done, we’re going to Tony’s house to hang out, which is what
“You’re frustrating me.”
According to Rhodey, it was, quote, “disgusting.”
Comments and kudos are really appreciated! Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“Something on your mind?” he asked.
With his eyes closed, he could focus on Steve’s hands working his foot until his other was pulled into place and given the same attention. He had never had a real massage before, and to have Steve’s pleasantly calloused hands working the last week’s aches and pains out pulled another moan from him. Distantly, he yelled at himself for letting one man’s hands reduce him to goo, but it had been far too long since he had let go and enjoyed his biology. An Omega’s body relaxed completely when in a tender Alpha’s hands, and despite his conflicting emotions, Tony’s body seemed to be okay with Steve’s touch. It did not take long for his thoughts to fuzz and his mouth to open slightly, whistling softly as he slept on.
“If you keep looking at me like that, I might start thinking you’re going to either stab me or kick me out. Or both,” Steve’s quiet voice interrupted his thoughts, “You alright?”
“Covers the vehicles around the area,” T’Challa confirmed with a nod, “But Sergeant Barnes is correct. We’d be funneled in.”
“Yes, Captain?” he asked, uncaring about the close proximity to Steve’s nudity.
His Mother’s voice caught through the noise, causing Tony to turn. She was smiling at him as she bent down to his level, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Deciding that for once in his life he could swallow his pride better than his pain, Tony swung himself out of bed, wrapping the comfortable blanket around his shoulders before padding out of the room. He followed the sounds of Steve’s gentle baritone, eventually finding himself in the kitchen, where the blond was attempting to feed PJ bits of what looked like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Whipping around, Tony blinked, seeing that the boy with shaggy brown hair—Bucky—was standing next to him, peering at the page clutched to his chest. Reluctantly, Tony held it out, and Bucky looked it over, nodding with an approving hum.
“T’Challa, keep Shuri working on her sonic echolocator and see if she can get any more information about the depth of the complex. Tell her she can use JARVIS if she wants a second hand on board,” he said, pulling the Black Panther aside, “And…tell her thank you. Its always good to have another brain on board, and I only want the best. She’s invaluable and I’m glad she is part of the team.”
He slowly reached out his hand, palm up, letting PJ tentatively place his little hand on Tony’s again. With a nod, Tony slowly reached forward, careful to keep an eye on PJ’s reactions as he unknotted the t-shirt and lifted it over his head.
“You’re
“Up!” The boy demanded, stomping his foot.
to ease the pain?
He smirked at Tony’s pout, only to laugh at Bucky’s hum of agreement
“Not good,” Tony murmured, unpeeling an orange and slowly chewing down a few slices, “Worse than usual. Mom let him back into the liquor cabinet since he didn’t bring anyone home for a week.”
Natasha nodded, resting her head on Tony’s shoulder with a sigh. She brought her legs up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them with a hum.
With that particular thought, Tony turned over on the roof, grabbing up the bag of weed to roll his last joint. Lunch was in a few minutes, and once that bell rang, he could get off the roof and head out to ease his munchies and be on time for Modern Physics. He’d scheduled all his general education courses in the morning, ones he could easily make up for in the summer, just so he could do this exact thing: sit on the roof, smoke, and mourn his own sanity and the loss of his best friend.
Would you walk away from a place to eat and a warm bed for your
watch him and make sure he’s pacing himself until we’re sure he’s strong enough.”
“Oh, don’t say that. I just want to play footsie at dinner, not take trips on the Falcon armor through Manhattan,” Bucky groaned, sinking in his seat with a pout, “Besides, we wouldn’t be able to beat Steve anyway, he’s a total—”
“The Prime wishes to take you into the city for the day,” Thor translated, his smile becoming almost too big for his face, “He wants to show you the markets—I have no doubt that you are in for a treat today, Tony. The Prime is quite fond of his peoples and loves to buy things for others. I have no doubt that you and the babe will be laden with gifts and sweets.”
“Missed you too, Buck,” he murmured, then after a moment’s pause, let a sleazy grin creep up onto his face, “Say, in captivity, we don’t exactly get the news. How’s Sam?”
He sucked in a breath when Tony turned, recognizing the glassy look in his eyes from the first sleepover. Carefully, Steve drew him into a hug, smiling when the others declared a group hug and gathered around him.
“I must confess, I do not think he likes me very much.”
“I’d rather be an angel than a sheep.”
“Uh, we aren’t—we aren’t romantically involved, Colonel,” Steve said plainly, not quite meeting either of the men’s gazes, “Tony’s made—his intentions are pretty clear that he wants to keep things platonic between us, and I respect that.”
, Brucie bear. But then, then he just goes and tells me that I’m wrong and that
“Oh,” Tony said weakly, attempting to process the new information with a rapidly thumping heart.
“I am going to join you. I have not bathed either,” Tony lied.
He let out a soft moan of protest and shook his head. Gods, it
“But you’re my husband.”
“No one gets used to it. Now, go feed him, I’m going to go fill Pepper in on everything. I’ll leave out the details, but I’ll let her know you may have to leave on short notice,” Rhodey said, leaning up off of the counter, “Call when you leave for the Sahara. I can stay here and be the babysitter. You might need Uncle Clint on duty.”
He answered with a right hook, to which Steve grabbed his oncoming wrist with the opposite hand and turned himself around, throwing Tony’s chest to his back. In one fluid motion, he upturned Tony over his shoulder and let him gracelessly slam onto his back on the floor.
“Oh, sweetheart, it is alright,” Tony soothed, patting his backside, “After our tour, we can have something to eat and a small nap, yeah? I bet the early morning has you about ready for sleep.”
“Yes, yes, I know. I dress first, then breakfast. Not too much longer,” he said.
Tony laughed at that, looking over at him with an amused smirk.
Tony kept his face neutral and turned back to Rhodey.
“What kind?” Bucky asked.
” Tony asked more urgently, “Rhodey--”
“Now look, we got you step stools and even a little butt cushion, so you won’t fall in,” He explained, grinning at the boy’s soft giggle, “If you need help, St—Papa and I will be right outside, okay?”
“Butter pecan,” Tony murmured, not really paying attention, “The more candied pecans, the better.”
“So run this by me again. They were creating an army of Avenger children?” Clint asked, sitting on one of the few pieces of furniture that had not been destroyed in the attack.
“It wasn’t that good, but you know I love your ass under my hands, so it wasn’t fair,” Steve mumbled, shifting uncomfortably, “God, Tony, that was your fantasy at
“Almost ready. Just a little more and we can try,” Steve decided, taking his fingers away.
“You are going to be so good for him,” he said with a big grin, “That is, if you do not kill him first.”
“Since when did
“You come when I let you,” he growled, leaving no room for argument.
“Oh, honey, PJ, Peter, it’s me, you’re safe,” Tony begged, taking a step closer, “It was just a nightmare, they can’t get you anymore, sweet boy. I promise you’re safe, we took you from that awful place—Steve, let
Tony stuck his hand out at the boy, wiggling his fingers until PJ giggled, gently resting his hand on top of Tony’s, as usual. Together they started to go through boxes until Tony crowed in triumph, pulling out a boy’s twin bed set.
“Good job, bud, that’s right!. Now, one Sunday morning, the warm sun came up…”
He paused.
The room was dead silent until Natasha yelled, “Are you
Knowing that an argument was pointless—and that Steve was listening—Tony trudged up into the Avengejet, smiling at a slightly bedraggled Bruce already buckled in for the flight.
“I am sure, I really am,” Tony shushed, petting Steve’s cheek, “I thought about it while you were away, and… I want it. I want this. I want
He grinned in jest, only to have his face fall at the strange look on Tony’s face.
Staring at their entwined hands, Tony almost tripped as he ran back with Steve to the playhouse, finding Bucky talking with Natasha as they sipped at empty teacups.
“Despite your inability to follow your
, pray tell, was that?” Rhodey said, “I thought you were finally on a smooth road together. Why did you try to dent his face?”
“That’s not possible. I’ve seen the tanks and equipment needed for their experiments, as well as the machinery needed for Zola,” Tony said, shaking his head, “There’s got to be another way in. If it's as expansive as we’re thinking, it's possible that it could stretch for miles. We need to check with the locals, see if they know anything. I’d say send Steve as a pun on his ex-job as Nomad, but it’d probably be best if we went stealth. Vis and Nat are our best bets, Clint, you cover. Maybe take Sam with you.”
“That is probably the worst way you could have phrased it,” he sighed, rolling his eyes, “But I
“…Right.”
“Oh, give him a break. He’s just trying to be kind,” Natasha said, elbowing Bucky’s side to make him grunt, “Besides, I think we just ruined the moment for them.”
Feeling Tony’s hand go rigid on his thigh, Steve held his breath and hung his head, knowing the gig was up. Anxious, suffocating seconds ticked by until the other spoke.
The room turned silent, so Tony took that as his opportunity to pretend to wake up by stretching out his arms with a whine. He opened his eyes to see the three Warlords staring at him with unreadable expressions on their faces, then Natasha pivoted to physically put her body between him and Steve.
“That is how the rest of us feel, and yet we can speak to him,” he snorted, turning them down the stairwell to go down into the cellar.
“Yes?” He said, half-mumbling into a pillow.
“Ah ah, back down, Alpha,” he teased, scraping nails over Steve’s shoulders and down to his pecs, “I am supposed to be
“Excellent. Now, the matter the Prime has called me to before I retire for the evening—he and Bruce both approached me about the situation that occurred this morning.”
“Speaking of ravishing… would you help me again? With my…. aches,” he mumbled, “The numbing has gone away already.”
. I would never take advantage of you. I promise. I only thought that being held and being able to scent me would help you feel more at ease. Unless...did you
“I know, I know sweetheart, I know,” Tony whispered, feeling their bond ache, “It will all be okay soon. I promise.”
“Why Natasha?” Tony asked, carefully untangling PJ from the filthy blanket.
“Shh, I am alright. Merely scared at the thought of my father,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around Steve despite the paint still drying on his body, “It was not you, my darling, shh…”
“And I just happen to be gone every time?”
“Hey, do
“It is certainly possible, and not unheard of. My mother may know more about it,” Thor offered.
Eager, he picked up a piece of meat and ate it, moaning at the bursts of different flavors. It burned his tongue and throat, but he quickly scarfed down the portion anyway, barely able to keep down his pout when he realized he had eaten it all. He looked up to try and ask for more, only to pause at the look on Steve’s face; the man’s eyes were sad despite the small smile on his lips.
“Do not panic. We were just leaving,” she said, “Go back to sleep.”
Tony set his water aside and jogged over to the stands, finding Steve sitting with Sarah in their usual spot. Grinning, he sidled up next to Steve, going up on his tiptoes.
Steve blinked, then burst into tears, his large shoulders heaving with the force of his cry. Bewildered, Tony tried to pat his back, utterly confused.
The sigh Tony made was probably heard halfway around the world. He put in the effort to try to get them to reconcile, so no one can say that he did otherwise. Still, he could try one more tactic.
“Behave for the Captain. I’ll see you guys in a bit,” he said at a normal volume as he walked out the door, “Remember to feed him and make him drink
“I hope that in your stay here, you will not have to gather such strength by yourself again. You now have a whole community to help you, Tony. We will all do our best to make you feel welcome and at home. You are a part of our family now—you
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and started to drag him over toward the wall lined with small wood cabinets, making a face as he judged the identical spaces before picking one.
“I apologize. You must have been deep in thought,” Thor said, sitting down on Tony’s right, “I was sure you heard me--Nevermind. I will make sure to approach you from the front as to not startle you again.”
Whatever it was, it was bloody. Steve wrenched off what looked like the chest plate in the hopes of getting a pulse, only to gasp at the sight in front of him. An object was embedded in the man’s chest, glowing brightly within the tendrils of scar tissue. Bloodied bandaging covered the skin; Steve feared the worst, but a small hiss of air alerted him to the fact that whoever this was, they were not only alive, but were
hurt Rhodey, I will chop your balls off and feed them to you, one at a time.
The Prime only grunted in response and began to kiss all over his neck, stopping over the bondmark to give it more attention. Tony sighed and rolled his eyes, resigning himself to his fate when a multitude of footsteps came running from down the hall.
Tony shrieked first, which snapped Steve out of it, immediately scooping him back up and sprinting to their bedroom. The group collapsed into raucous laughter in the background with cat-calls thrown into the mix. The noise continued until both men reemerged, dressed in loose clothing and clearly over their momentary need.
Unbeta'd. Comments & Kudos appreciated.
worried, James. Do you know how difficult it is to smear waterproof mascara? That’s why its called
“Is it—Is he alright?” Tony asked, bending at his knees to get a good look at the pale boy.
He smiled when Steve managed a watery laugh, digging out a tissue from the glove box so he could wipe Steve’s face.
He guiltily watched as PJ sunk to the floor, his cries dwindling to hiccupped sniffles as exhaustion took him over. Waiting for the boy to finally give into his tiredness, Tony carefully scooted closer to him, keeping himself an arm’s length away, just in case PJ had another episode. He put his palm out, slowly moving it closer to the boy. Looking at Tony with half-lidded eyes, PJ reached his hand out to put back in Tony’s, sticking his other one in his mouth again to chew on.
“Type?” Steve repeated again, awkwardly folding his arms over his chest.
“Yeah,” Tony choked out, automatically feeling tears well up in his eyes, “Yeah buddy, it kinda is—”
Even if that meant facing Rhodey’s—and eventually Steve’s—wrath.
,” Bruce sighed, rolling his eyes, “Steve does not hate you. He doesn’t. If he hated you, he’d kick you off a building, or at least not live in your
Tony closed his eye again and lifted up the furs, allowing Steve to crawl under them with him. The Alpha ran warm enough that it felt like he had his own personal heater in the bed. He snuggled up to him, but Steve was rigid and tense like he was expecting to leap out of bed at any second. Tony tilted his head back so he could peer up at the Warlord, noting that he was staring off at the far wall instead of sleeping.
“Hey, shh, it’s okay, almost there,” Tony pleaded, not wanting to have to get the others to keep Steve still, “Be good for me just a little longer, okay?”
“No, no, you’re in my lap for now,” Steve said, dragging the bag of things over before snatching PJ up, handing him his elephant and sippy cup before sitting down in the chair next to Tony’s bed.
Not missing the flush on the Captain’s face, Tony quickly turned and pretended not to notice, smiling as PJ trotted out of the bathroom, immediately scooping up his elephant that had been left on the bed. Hugging it close, he looked up at Tony and Steve, then held his arms up. Tony glanced over at Steve, then nudged him.
, Tony thought, feeling the phrase echo in his mind,
“…That was terrible.”
When realization dawned on the kid’s face, Tony swore he could have done a victory dance.
sorry I hurt you, son,” Steve whispered, shoulders slumping, “I—I didn’t mean to, and I know you don’t know that since you’ve been hurt so much, and I know an apology won’t
“You saw the man we captured?” Steve asked, continuing at Tony’s nod, “He chose to stay and fight when the others retreated. Challenged me one-on-one. He almost beat me, too. Managed to lop off my braid and slice my side, but he was too angry. Not having a clear head can make you clumsy and misjudge your steps. I caught him when his lunge was too deep. Too much strain on the back leg.”
“Shh, I have you, easy now,” Tony said, smoothing back Steve’s sweaty hair and kissing his cheek, “Just relax, not too much longer, yeah? Then we can clean up and throw on something loose and sleep.”
“Of course. You should attend to Clint first, for his arm was broken in the heat of battle…”
“So she fell pregnant from unbonded Omega-Omega relations, of which one of those happens to be the Prince,” Bruce said, grimacing when Tony nodded, “Well, I would say that you may have very well succeeded in going against your father’s wishes, that is for sure.”
Tony stuck his tongue out at him and sunk into his seat, tapping his fingers against his desk as he watched the clock on the wall tick by. They had Phys Ed today, which meant that Tony had to meet up with Natasha (as planned) and use her makeup (not fun). He also hoped she managed to snag her mom’s setting powder, so the concealer wouldn’t run when he got sweaty. Last time that had happened, Steve had almost noticed the bruising on his arms, and that shit was not going to fly this time.  It was bad enough that here he was, wearing a long-sleeved turtleneck in the middle of April, just to hide the purpling handprints on his body from Steve.
“Shh, sweet thing. I apologize, I did not--”
Natasha sighed, but she did not argue with him and took Peter and the wrap when proffered up to her. Tony carefully stood up and watched them walk back down the hall, waiting until they were gone to go over to Steve. He sat back down by the bars and waited for the Alpha to look over at him.
“Penlight, please,” Bruce asked, holding his hand out.
“It was just a thought, okay? Just—drop it. I’ll have a conversation with Rhodey later,” Tony interrupted back, putting a hand on his forehead, “Could—could you just please show me where PJ is? I don’t—I don’t want him to be alone right now.”
“Steve!” Tony called, having PJ put his hands over his ears, “Get up here!”
Tony gaped at him for a moment, and Steve realized that
Then, there was Peggy.
Margaret Carter, who insisted everyone called her Peggy, was a bombshell English girl, all legs and breasts with a no-nonsense attitude and an incredible wit that had the boys drooling and the girls scowling. She wore her hair in victory curls, seemingly stuck in the second World War with her Rosie the Riveter look and glossy red lips. She was
Tony laughed at Clint’s pout, smirking as he moved to the kitchen.
“We are headed back to Ma’atan. If Stark’s army is here, then it is not there and we have a safe house,” Rhodey said, “If you come, look for the orange house with a red-tiled roof in the third quadrant of the city. That is where we will be.”
that I will rip you limb from limb.”
“Is that what you ran into danger to grab?” Rhodey asked in a judgemental tone.
“Actually, yeah,” Bruce answered, still staring into the microscope as he moved a slide around, “It’s quite fascinating, actually. He
he thought with a grunt.
Shaking his head in an attempt to clear his thoughts, Tony forced himself to become swallowed up in the conversation if naught but to save his own sanity.
“Boys are s’posed to smell bad,” Bucky said, rolling his eyes, “We’re
“Support his head,” She repeated, maneuvering Tony’s arms to properly hold the boy, “When kids are this weak, their necks don’t really have enough strength to be held like this without support.”
“Look, I only
“Yeah. He’ll need a draw,” Tony sighed, running his fingers through the child’s tangled locks, “I was unconscious for an undetermined period of time before they let me see him, so I don’t know what they did to him, if anything. He hasn’t complained about hurting or anything, but then again, I don’t know if he’d even tell us if it hurt. J hasn’t set off the alarm for bugging yet, so I’m hoping we can assume they didn’t put any tracker on him…but I want to be sure, y’know?”
“Hey, we gotta go, kiddo, okay?” Tony whispered to PJ, hearing the boy fuss as he woke up, “You go right back to sleep. I’ll carry you.”
—not necessarily good versus bad, but more of good versus evil, y’know? Even when it gets you into trouble, you hold your ground. Like Aunt Peg used to say, right? You have a duty to root yourself and say—”
Steve merely tapped his left ear and pointed at the door, smirking as Bruce walked in with a tray. Tony exhaled loudly in relief when Steve sat down in one of the chairs next to the bed; Bruce stopped, looking between the two men before rolling his eyes and going over to Tony’s side.
Touching the skin under each eye as Tony mentioned them, PJ seemed to mouth the names of the colors, thankfully distracted.
The position was slightly awkward, but he could not move them out of the water yet, since it would have to suffice as their makeshift slick. He started slowly with one finger, easing the burn by distracting Steve with more kisses.
“About what?”
been treated well, and the others seemed to genuinely be concerned for his well-being. If things continued to be… less than ideal with Steve, he figured he could always hide out with Thor since he had witnessed the linguist publicly scold the Prime Alpha.
“He is the only survivor,” she continued, looking up to Tony as if she had read his mind, “There were roughly ten splices per Avenger. So out of sixty—”
Tony whirled around and stared at him from under his brow, blinking exaggeratedly.
Tony tried to protest, but Bruce grabbed his arm and they were off like a shot at a full gallop toward Ma’atan. Without his charge there to remind him to stay calm, fire lit up his veins. He thought he heard screaming, but did not realize it was coming from his own mouth until Bruce forced Tony’s head into his neck to quiet him down. Since he did not scent of either Alpha or Omega, the scientist in his brain was curious enough to keep him quiet while they rode through back roads to the orange home.
. He is merely trying to get a rise out of the Prime. Ignore him unless you are on the battlefield. It is the best policy.”
Steve heard Tony choke on the other side of the line and rolled his eyes fondly, wishing Tony could see him shake his head.
Tony silenced him with another kiss, reaching under the water to line their cocks up so he could stroke them together. They both moaned at the contact, and Steve desperately rutted up into Tony’s hand. Tony clicked his tongue in annoyance and pulled away, only to roughly grab the base of Steve’s cock.
“We have shit friends,” Tony said, frowning as Steve unbuckled him and helped him into his wheelchair.
“You are very good with him, especially for a first-time father,” Bruce said as Tony almost ran to the tools, “Did you have practice before the birth?”
“Steve?” Tony snapped his fingers in front of the blond, concerned eyes looking down at him, “You in there? Or are you still overtaken by my dashing good looks?”
at the compound—”
Steve tilted his head and frowned, then slowly pushed the plate back, saying a few words himself.
Tony choked a laugh, so Steve claimed a victory point; as long as he kept Tony laughing, everything would be okay.
intended
,” Bucky said, snapping his fingers in front of Tony’s face, “What are you thinking about? Pepper?”
“If I don’t bring one, I get to take yours.”
“Good gods,” he muttered to himself, pushing the heel of his hand into his crotch to try and tamp down the unintended side effect of his ‘treatment’, “I must be cursed.”
“Oh, please, gods. Nothing annoys me more than not knowing what that man is thinking.”
“Shh, I’m right here, it’s okay, you’re okay,” He soothed, ignoring the little hands pushing on his chest, “You gotta calm down, PJ. Okay? I’ll let you go once you can
Steve cleared his throat next to them and Tony jumped away, blushing deeply and casually pushing down Rhodey’s hand from his side.
“It’s okay, Steve. Really,” Tony said plainly, letting go of Steve’s wrist, “He likes it when you’re here. And—and the company’s nice. Really. Plus, I’m supposed to be stuck in bed, and he’ll need you to take him to the bathroom and play with him.”
“I would rather have love burn deeply than barely burn at all.”
Tony bit the inside of his cheek and winced, not wanting to leave the baby after the whole ordeal. However, if having him nearby would help Steve recover…
“That doesn’t explain what happened, Barnes.”
“Bite me, Rogers.”
Embarrassed, Tony made up the bed, then went to check on Peter. The babe was still asleep, blissfully unaware of his father’s gaffe. He did not want to wake the infant, but he did not want to face Steve by himself, so he scooped Peter up into his arms and gently kissed his head, watching him slowly wake up.
Five years. Five beautiful, wonderful years filled with laughs and movie nights and embarrassed blushing when their rings clinked when they held hands. Five years of marriage, and Steve had never expected to see his husband be so nervous when they exchanged gifts. Usually, they tried to do something out of the ordinary, since they never felt they needed material items; Steve generally chose a charity to give money to in Tony’s name, whereas Tony gave the public school system an influx of supplies. However, this year, Tony had clearly done more than what he’d promised, as he was sitting across from Steve with a shoebox in his lap, knees bouncing and causing whatever was inside of it to thunk back and forth.
Bruce was next, followed by Natasha, Clint, and Sam, who looked a little more flushed than the others. Tony tried to sneak a glance at Bucky, but he’d already stolen Sam back, leaving Tony to accept wet hugs from the rest of their friend group.
“You didn’t say it right.”
Tony didn’t make a sound; he merely let his Mother take his hand and peel him off of her skirt, forcing him to shift his backpack on his tiny shoulders. Slowly, he followed her into the schoolhouse, staring down at his new shiny dress shoes instead of looking around. Father always hated that he tended to be shy in new situations, but the noise surrounding him was overwhelming, and he didn’t exactly want to be left there. Especially not by himself.
“Daddy?”
He wanted to disagree, but Steve was offering him food
Nodding, Natasha said her goodnight before scurrying away, leaving Tony alone once more. Looking around the room, he finally pushed himself to his feet, looting the room for PJ’s pajamas and new training pants. He set the clothes on the counter in the bathroom, turning to look out at the room with a hum. Taking in the child’s things, spread out to maximize coziness and homeliness, Tony could only find one thought in his mind:
At the mention of his name, the boy poked his head up and made a reach for Tony. Natasha carefully put him back down on the bed; he grabbed up his elephant as he scrambled to Tony’s side, tucking himself underneath Tony’s arm.
the blowjob to tell you I’d figured out you’d lied?” Steve asked, looking over at Tony, “Wouldn’t I have known during it?”
“I will be quick, I promise,” Steve said as he settled on the end of the bed, moving the furs up to Tony’s waist, “Can you hold yourself open for me?”
Unbeta'd. Comments and kudos are really appreciated. Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
The room was silent, stretching on until Steve returned, eyeing them both as he set down Tony’s and his plates. He grunted and petted Tony’s hair, then turned back around and went back into the kitchen. Tony still kept his head down, even when Steve brought out a third plate, handing it to Rhodey.
