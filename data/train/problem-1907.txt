“Sherlock, hey, love, don't do that.” Maybe it was selfish, but Sherlock couldn't stop himself from taking some form of happiness at the way the doctor’s voice was colored with concern. “It's okay. It's going to be okay. Just look at me. Sherlock.” When had he closed his eyes? He fought to open them through the tears. “There you are. It's going to be just fine. Have I ever lied to you?”
My identification tag is intriguing. It looks like a medical ID tag, one of the bracelet ones, but it serves the same purpose as dog tags in the military. The code is only accessible if it is pulled off of the band, so it can't be taken without me knowing about it. On the outside, I’m Stephen Jones, diabetic. On the inside, I’m a six digit code that the government can pull up to see my profile. The code changes for every mission so it can’t be used if someone somehow gets ahold of it. Isn’t that clever? I think so. The only downside is that if I do die and my body cannot be recovered, only the identification tag, you’ll be given a plaque that reads a name different than my own. That’s a bit unfortunate. But I can’t expose my real name, I suppose.
“I’m sorry,” he sobbed, turning his head to hide his eyes in John’s hand. “I’m so sorry, John. I-I’m so sorry.” The doctor didn’t say anything for a long time. He simply laid on top of the detective, cupped his cheeks, kept his breathing even for him. There was nothing he
I wonder how you are. How you reacted. Did you cry, John? I hope that you didn’t. No man is worth your tears, least of all me. Though I have to wonder if you showed up at all. There’s a very good chance that you would have skipped out on it. Or could you have maybe given a eulogy? Not likely, I think. You find that sort of stuff difficult. I just wish
Enough talk about the mission. That’s not the reason I write to you. Yes, you’re marvelous at encouraging my own genius, but it’s hardly effective to look for the reflection thousands of miles away and no hope of a reply to this letter. It would certainly make me look like a lunatic to write letter after letter to you, send them off somewhere that I know won’t reach you, and wait for a reply. That would be the very definition of insanity-- doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
Remember the case with Soo Lin Yao and the Black Lotus Tong? This seems to be something similar, I believe. The murdered man had a tattoo on the outside of his wrist of a
My first mission is going to be in Slovenia. It’s a small country, but it’ll be easy to blend in there. I’m heading out tomorrow; today I had to put together a disguise. Which leads me to ask: how can you stand your hair so short? Or blonde? I’ve done both to mine to help keep me indistinguishable from undesirables. After all, should anyone in Moriarty’s network find out that I’m still alive, there is a high chance that they’ll come back after you, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson again. I can’t risk that, obviously. I have to say that I don’t think even you would recognize me after this… Makeover. I hesitate to call it that, but that’s effectively what it is, I suppose.
And so Sherlock did not do anything with the loaded syringe tucked up against the filthy mattress his body was sunk into. He let his fingers reach out and brush over it, let the buzz of his current high make the smooth, cool glass feel like a promise of peace, let the wave of the idea of
But there was a proper time to die. That time, for Sherlock, was not in a drug den where an ambulance would be called only
Mrs. Hudson won’t look at my body. She’s already said so. No, she doesn’t know that I’m alive, but I’ve been in enough dangerous situations and been laid up in the hospital enough times that she’s made that clear. I’m not sure what good not looking at my body does her, but that’s her choice. I’m not sure how Lestrade will act, though. You don’t know it, but he and I have quite the history. He’s known me for longer than he said he has, and we’ve been through a lot together. Or because of each other. Both ways, actually. Basically, whatever he does, forgive him. If he goes, if he doesn’t, whatever, just… Let him do what he needs to do. Don’t hold it against him.
“However many times I want.” The words fell from his pale lips with all the strength of a whisper, a secret for the two of them to share. A promise, maybe, of the darkest kind. But at least it was the truth.
Instead, he simply grinned, thick lips pale and eyes squinting against the daylight seeping in through the dirty window. Not-John, no matter how perfect he seemed, would never be John. And in the end, he’d rather spend another hour with angry, hurt,
Anyway, I have a new name now. It will change a lot. Every time I move to a different location, adopt a new disguise, need a different name, my identity will change with it. Right now, I’m Stephen Jones. Dull. Boring. But that’s exactly what I need. The receptionist at the hotel didn’t even blink. Not a single twitch to suggest she might suspect who I was. Granted, I’m not as popular as these letters make me out to be and she might not actually know what my real name is in the first place, but it’s still a security risk. Stephen. It’s so… Strange. I don’t think you’d like it. I certainly don’t. Who the hell names their kid ‘Stephen’? I feel sorry for the people out there that actually have that on their birth certificate. Their parents must all be delusional.
That’s all the time I have for you today. Sorry again about the pavement comment. I’ll try to refrain from referencing that in future letters. I’ll see you soon.
John closed his eyes partially at the touch, leaning into it, but he would not be discouraged. “I asked you a question,” he prodded, reaching up to press cool fingers against the faint divot of Sherlock’s wrist. “Answer me, love. How many more times?”
Bleary, bloodshot blue eyes fluttered open to see the man kneeling beside him. Sherlock couldn’t make himself care about the way the edges of him seemed to blur. He just smiled, languid and slow. “John.” His hand reached up, carding through coarse, greying golden hair.
“Ah. Hello, John. Didn’t expect to see you here.” The soldier’s shoulders tightened; the muscles in his back grew taut, and for a moment, Sherlock had half the thought that the man was to turn round and punch his lights out as realization hit him. John turned, and his expression was so much different than Not-John. He almost wished he could have Not-John instead.
There’s a drug trafficking ring there, in Slovenia. There’s word about Moran-- that’s Moriarty’s second in command-- hanging about around there. Mycroft thinks that if we take out Moran, then the rest of the operations will fall apart. Like setting a flame in the middle of a spiderweb and letting it spread out on its own. According to that theory, I should be able to return home in about two months. A little late to keep you from mourning, but I figure by then you’ll have gotten over my absence. In fact, I’m sure you’ll have a girlfriend at the end of this month. You’ll wait until after the funeral-- you will attend, won’t you? It may not be real, but I suppose the symbolism is the same-- and give yourself a week or two, and then you’ll go out looking for a date again. Don’t worry. You’ll be able to spend all the time you want to on her. I won’t be there to mess it up for you this time. I’m sure whoever she is, she’ll be more than happy to be in a steady relationship with you. Despite what I usually say, anyone would be lucky to have you.
I dreamt of you last night. I’m not sure why. I’ve devoted this time for you and it’s been working; why are you still in my head? It isn’t fair, you know. If you could leave me alone, I would really appreciate it. You’re like a ghost clinging on to me. It’s not pleasant. Well. Allow me to rephrase that. It’s very pleasant, but not at all
Anyway, I've decided to write letters to you when I can. You run around my head all too much; I can't risk thinking of you when I'm supposed to be taking down Moriarty’s web. It is very likely that any distraction I might have would aid me in staying alive. I need the entirety of my brain power to deal with these people. Therefore, I am allotting half an hour every day to you, should I need it. I would have simply tucked you away, locked the door to your room in my mind palace, but you are nothing if not stubborn. I couldn't lock you up; you kept spilling out at the edges, breaking down the door with your good shoulder, picking the lock from the inside. I'm not sure how you did it. There's not a lock on the inside of that door.
Sherlock very nearly grinned with the reply. Only the tug of pain in his chest, coupled with faint elation at being able to see John again after a
“Isaac?” A pause. John’s presence came infinitely closer. “Hello, mate.” He could tell from the level of his voice that the older man was crouched down, from the proximity that he was likely beside the mattress laid out a few feet away from Sherlock’s own. “Sit up for me? Sit up.”
Steady, quiet breaths breezed over his chapped lips. Eyes closing, the detective- no, the druggie- allowed himself to relax, sink back into the mattress despite the strain on his back, despite the odd angle of his legs, despite the fact it put the rest of the room where he could not see it. Not that keeping an eye on things would do much. This was a doss house- not a crime scene.
The detective reached up. He caught John’s hand in his own and pressed it flat to his cheek, the cool palm cradling him with immeasurable care. His eyes fluttered but he refused to shut them. Seeing John- it was the whole reason behind this. It would all be for naught should he close them and let the man’s visage slip away from him. Like smoke from an extinguished candle, or the fog of a soft morning, it would all eventually burn away. John’s face would fade as the last seams of a good dream, allowing for horrible reality to set.
Right. Your hour is up. I hope you are doing well-- as well as can be expected, anyway-- and that I might be able to see you again soon. Things will get better. You just have to believe in me.
Eventually, however, the tears ran out. He was left with soft hiccups, his body settling where it lay further. It was as though his bones themselves sunk down into the ground, half submerging his body to become a part of the earth itself. It was comfortable, in a way. Like he could stay there and spend the rest of his days, watch the world crumble around him, never have to worry about anything anymore. But that wasn’t how things were. Life was never that easy.
The mission starts tomorrow. It’ll be a simple one, like I’ve said. Maybe I’ll have it finished before the end of the week. Slovenia is nice, yes, but I’d like to work as quickly as possible. Like I said, I’m aiming for three months. You’ll be mad, yes, but three months isn’t so long. A month after I come back, and everything will be back to normal between us, I guarantee. I’ll see you soon.
-- an ancient rune that typically meant mysteries, skills, and, perhaps most importantly, initiation. My attacker had a matching one. Don’t worry though, I didn’t touch the victim; it was easy enough to see it from how he’d been left after death. Not that it would have mattered. Had the police actually managed to track me down, they’d find nothing but DNA of a dead man. I did call them, though, with a throwaway phone to alert them of what had I had found. I don’t know if the man had a family but if he did, they deserved to know. Just like they deserve to have those responsible behind bars. I came here for one reason, but now I find myself with three. The crime ring, Moran, and this victim need all be taken care of before I move on. If that’s a surprise to you, I must wonder how much you paid attention to my character while you knew me.
The hotel is nice, too. I think Lestrade would enjoy the pastries that are sold outside. If we go on vacation here, we’ll have to send a couple back to him. Or a souvenir or two. Oh, hell. We might as well bring him along. You wouldn’t be too upset with that, would you? He’s important to me; it’d be my apology for being gone and for tricking him. Not that he wouldn’t forgive me before that. The idiot is always forgiving me for my stupidity. At least this time my stupidity would be saving lives instead of putting them in danger. Hopefully that would counteract any disappointment he might have in me.
I’m rambling. Hopefully I can get better at this in the future. Or stop thinking about you so much. Then I won’t even need to write these. It would be the preferable outcome. In the meantime, you won’t mind my drabble. It might be boring at times, but that’s because some of the places I go to will have less than honorable governments and mailing systems. I might end up sending letters in bulk if I’m in a truly awful place. I’d rather that than to risk our safety.
. I’m simply glad I started writing these before my missions began. I’d be too distracted to be safe. I plan to do anything I have to, mind you, but I’d rather come home to you with scars instead of in a body bag. Or nothing but my identification tag.
Sherlock thought, offering a tight-lipped smile in return. End of the road for Not-John and their not-touches and their not-kisses.
we could have had more time. Had I been able to predict this, I wouldn’t have taken you for granted. There are many things I regret, but I think not appreciating you while I had you would be one of the worst.
I'm sending these letters to Mycroft. He has agreed to do with them as he pleases, as well as to never read them. Whether he saves them or destroys them I do not care, so long as they are not read. This will be the last piece of privacy that I have for a very long time to come.
John’s other hand suddenly alit on his other cheek. His thumbs rubbed at the skin, trying unsuccessfully to brush away the tears, following the movement of Sherlock’s head rocking gently from side to side on the thin mattress.
When Sherlock opened his eyes, he was greeted with a vision of Not-John sat down beside him, folded awkwardly between the mattress and the dank, moldy wall. Not-John looked sad but relieved, his mouth quirking up ironically.
Either way, it needs to go smoothly. If you notice something’s off about it, just forget about it, okay? Just let it go. Believe that I’m dead. I need you to do that for me. No matter what inconsistencies you think you’ve found, you need to think that it’s just because you can’t process what happened to me. It’s for your own safety. I wouldn’t ask you to ignore the obvious if it wasn’t vitally important to both of our sakes. And believe Mycroft’s acting. He’s not as good as I am, I have to admit, but believe him. He’s going to manipulate his emotions and he’s going to pretend that he’s lost me, and you
I know. I shouldn’t have any problem writing these. You’re not the one that’s supposed to be dead. I haven’t lost you. Even if you had somehow met your demise in the two weeks I’ve been gone, Mycroft would have informed me. He promised me that much, at least. You, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson are safe. You don’t like surveillance on you, but you have to understand. I saved you. I’m not going to let you be in danger just because I’m not there with you. So stay out of trouble, will you? I have no plans to reenact Romeo and Juliet.
Turns out that tailing that man was not so good of an idea as I thought it was. Either that or I’ve grown complacent in some of my abilities since we became partners. I was caught and only barely managed to lie my way out of this situation. Didn’t manage to do it quickly enough to avoid a bit of an injury, however. I really should have asked for some lessons in treating wounds from you before I left. It’s only a small cut on my upper arm but stitches were in order, and I fear I’ve botched them. Soon as I can find my way to a library and the subsequent computers, I’m going to look up how to properly suture. If I still have three more months of this, then I suppose it would be well within reason that I learn how to do it properly.
Thankfully, John didn't need an explanation. He didn't need one. Sherlock’s fingers fell from the other man’s lips at the same time the hand at the crook of his elbow drifted up. The tingly, sweet slide of John’s skin against his etched a line down his cheek, the back of his knuckles soft and gentle.
“You can't keep doing this.” His fingertips trailed down, brushing against the pale expanse of his arm, skin thin and dotted like ink on paper. Sherlock’s smile didn't fade, not as that gentle touch traced over track marks, rubbed away the soreness left in his bicep from the rubber tourniquet. “I don’t like it. You know that, and yet you keep doing it. Why is that?”
If they were sincere about it, I wouldn’t mind them attending. The two of them have a lot of potential; hopefully they learn from this. Despite my general dislike for the both of them, I think they are simply too sure of themselves and are unwilling to accept any help. It could be their downfall. Hopefully my own apparent suicide made them realize that self righteousness is not the way to go about their line of work; that they need to examine a case from all facets and not just the few that would support their narrative. Anderson and Donovan could have bright futures in store for them-- they only need to learn to
Actually, that’s not true. I don’t intend to leave any stragglers. You’re not going to get these, no matter what Mycroft decides to do with them, so there’s no need to lie, I suppose.
, stopped him. “The arse-end of the universe with the scum of the Earth. Look at me.” He could imagine the way John would check the boy over. The boy, because Sherlock had paid
rush over him and across him and through him. But the moment passed. Sherlock withdrew his hand. He turned his body as best he could, awkward and heavy and slow, shaking as he tugged his hood up and over his greasy, lifeless hair.
Mycroft said that my funeral is in two days. I’m not sure how he’s going to pull it off. Maybe it'll be a closed casket funeral. The body double, while very similar to me, still
me, and I’m not sure if you or Lestrade wouldn’t notice that something was off. I’d not usually give you the credit of it, but after living together this long, it’s entirely possible that you might notice a fake when not face down on the pavement.
The man shrugged. He kept his arm somewhat suspended in the air, allowing for the touch, unafraid to let the doctor see and feel the evidence of his use. In any other circumstances he would have reacted awfully, would have pulled away and refused to be inspected. But John wasn’t looking to give him an examination. It seemed to Sherlock that if he asked, by the way the man was acting, that should he ask him how many needles he’d ever used, John would be able to pinpoint the exact number. It appeared so reasonable, in fact, so intriguing and without a shadow of a doubt, that he almost did just that. It was only John’s look and a reminder of his previous stubbornness in getting a reply that he bit his tongue against it. “Because I want to see you, John. And if this is the only way you will come to me, then why should I refuse you?”
I got a day to settle in. I went sightseeing for a bit, but it was mostly to scope out the area. Mycroft is starting me off easy, making my first missions not too difficult in order to get used to living like this. He hasn’t said that, but I can tell, considering I was able to point out three different frequent stops of this drug trafficking business within three hours of the plane landing. It’ll be a piece of cake. For the rest, however, I’m sure I won’t be able to say the same. Getting to Moran will be difficult, but so long as all the information Mycroft has been given is correct, the estimate of coming home is still the same. His informants are supposedly very reliable, so don’t worry too much.
But enough dwelling on that. Mrs. Hudson is feeding you, yes? I know how you get when you’re sad. You gained at least a stone in the first three months of us living together. No, I’m not calling you fat. I’m saying you gained a healthy amount once you were no longer in that awful bedsit. I don’t know if you noticed, but it helped me a little bit, too. Not sure how. Somehow, not everything tasted like ash, like a distraction, when you were around.
Dread and delight filled him in a nauseating mixture. He was very glad he’d not ate anything for the past two days. It would have been expelled here.
There it was again. That bittersweet smile, the one that curled John’s lips up but dipped the corners of his eyes down. Sherlock hated that smile, but he would search it out again and again, time after time, if this was the only way he could manage to see him. For John, he would do anything. “I know,” he murmured, infinitely sad. “I know.” John started to get up. He put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head and began to push himself off.
Sherlock looked up. He gazed into those gentle blue eyes, drawing him in, trying to drown him in the most pleasant way possible. There was little he wouldn’t give to let that happen. He would have welcomed it. What a perfect death it would be.
gone. Disappeared to thin air, just like always. If only he really could drown himself in John’s eyes. Death, it turned out, was more pleasant than falling in love. And yet, one way or another, he was going to die from it anyway. He just wished he could do it on his own terms. Sherlock couldn’t imagine a life without John at his side. He supposed- given the circumstances- he didn’t have to.
This really feels stupid. I hope you know that. To you, I’m dead. That’s it. Full stop. Why can’t I just pretend that you’re similarly indisposed? Writing to you did help, and I was able to close your door for most of today, but that does not make writing these any easier.
The thought of that inevitable outcome settled heavily on Sherlock’s chest. The weight of it was incredible; he held a little tighter to John’s hand when the first shudder passed through him. Then another, another, another until his ribs felt like they were to cave in, breaths little more than ragged gasps passing his lips, sobs trying to rip from his throat.
everyone had cleared out (if anyone noticed anything wrong in the first place). It was not when his body had no identification on him and he would be taken to the morgue, identified, and
His eyes closed for the kiss. When he opened them again, John was gone. The weight, the touch, the comfort, the
Therefore, I think it’s due to change the subject. Today was the funeral, yes? It will have been over by now, I suppose. I never really wanted a big funeral, and I hope Mycroft honored that. I doubt many people would have shown up even if it had been an elaborate affair anyway. Wasn’t really well liked, as I’m sure you know. Though I’m sure there would be plenty of people there to put on airs. I wonder if Anderson or Donovan went. That would have been interesting. Though I’m not sure if it would be the good kind of interesting, or the bad. Depends on whether you saw them and punched them, I suppose. Wouldn’t put it past you, especially considering you’ve been close to doing just that when they were attempting to get under my skin. But you also have self restraint; I’m glad for your protection of my honour, but I’m also glad you didn’t ever give in to that urge. Hopefully you haven’t this time around either. Don’t think that would look too good on your record. Not that Mycroft wouldn’t wipe that away, but it’d still look bad. Hypothetically.
attention to his surroundings upon coming in the drug den, and the kid next to him had to have been maybe sixteen or seventeen. It wasn’t a situation that was foreign to Sherlock. Having someone come looking for him was just as familiar.
A sigh slipped from him. Sherlock reached up to trace those lips with his fingers, tracing the gentle frown with a ghost’s caress. John didn’t deny it of him. Once his hand had moved to the corner of his mouth, he spoke, the bony appendage bobbing ever so slightly to accommodate it. “That doesn’t mean I like it.” His voice was tinged with disappointment, sadness even.
This is actually very effective. I only thought of you seven times today. That is quite a rapid improvement. Though I can’t say that it’s exactly what I want. I am aiming for thinking of you only once-- when I write these letters, and only then. Still, I suppose hoping for results overnight is a bit ludicrous of me. I’m doing very well, all things considered.
It was difficult. John’s heterosexuality was unexpected and Sherlock had failed to make a contingency plan. Of greater concern at this moment – at least for Sherlock – was that somewhere, somehow, he’d made a mistake.
But of course, Mycroft texted back. Sherlock could feel his brother sneering and this pleased him momentarily.
By the time Lestrade and the youth liaison officer have arrived, Sherlock has walked nearly three kilometers
He stands straight, holding the card in one hand and three pairs of trousers in the other, then tosses the clothes on to Sherlock’s bed and storms down the stairs, slamming the door behind him.
And then Charlie opens the door and John sees the wide window that looks out on to trees and a small patch of grass and other houses, everything in colour even against this grey Saturday morning and he says, even before he sees the lone squirrel staring off in to the distance in the largest tree outside, oh this will do nicely. Yes, this is very nice. I'd love to live here.
“No.” Sherlock is pouring tea, stretching the brew as he fills the cup. “You proved last time that you are useless at weddings so I’ve decided that all you have to do is take a shower and show up. And sign the certificate, obviously.”
After fifteen minutes I thought something unwholesome had happened and went downstairs to retrieve my son and my doctor.
“Helping you?” The more information John gets, the more disjointed he becomes. “Why do you need help?”
It is built on a concrete slab, which strikes him as odd. It’s a wooden structure, designed to accommodate maybe a small tea party, or more likely some pot plants. It doesn’t need a concrete base. He checks the plans again and notices, for the first time, tiny letters next to drawing. He calls to Sherlock, and borrows his magnifying glass to read the little letters.
All around him is grey and opaque with no signal that it will get any better. Quite suddenly he decides he just doesn't want to do any of it any more and there is not one good reason why he has to.
And because Lestrade is kind, and because he holds Sherlock in high esteem, it makes him happy for them. Good relationships are rare. He figures if Sherlock can mate, then there is hope for every difficult person world wide.
“No. He was a complete prat. He kept two of my footballs when I accidently kicked them into his yard. You know the type. Hates everyone, always complaining. I thought it was funny that whenever we called the cat he’d think someone was calling him. He wasn’t amused, and called the council to complain. I don’t know what he thought the council would do.” John yawned and ran his hands over his hair. “Did you have a pet?”
"Easy. You had a few light cat hairs on your trousers. I saw them while we were in the cab, going to the hospital."
There is no time to read the poem again – there’s someone outside with a blocked nose and streaming eyes who has been waiting days for an appointment and has been squeezed in ahead of the rest of the day’s patients – but John manages another read just after 11am and two more considered reads over lunch.
“You can do anything you want with it, except show it to me. Or read it to me, unless one of m’tutors has been murdered in extraordinary circumstances and they require my assistance.”
softly shaped brunette with a delectable smiling mouth who is transfixed by her mobile phone, thumbs working at a blistering speed as she leans against the car.
“Aeronautical engineer,” I told Lestrade and the doctor, both of whom raised their eyebrows in appreciation as they attached a series of plastic fish to the frame.
I like to think he liked the sound of my voice,  so I would tell him stories or talk to him non-stop about things I thought would be helpful to him as well as interesting.  I would hold him when I told these stories, which was pleasant for him because it was warm and comfortable, and pleasant for me because he was as light as a cloud and I could watch all the different expressions he could make.
“So you think the handwriting is by two different people?” Sally was taking photos on her phone and quickly punching in brief notes.
We could see Lestrade and Sally Donovan standing outside one of the large barn like doors a few hundred feet away.
The kettle’s on. Dad remarks on the crusts of ice in their haphazard Sussex garden and Sherlock complains about sentiment as he boils the eggs. Both urge food on me, and make stern faces because I only have coffee for breakfast and Dad insists its not enough.
“They’re not going to hurt you anymore,” he tells Sherlock quietly. “You’re safe now. If anyone tries to hurt you again, I’m going to shoot them.”
“Oh! Well, don’t you be leaving gravelly bits in my carpet. Hello, John love. Nothing for you, I’m afraid.”
There have been so many deliberate attempts on my life,  and so many times when I have almost been accidentally killed, that I stopped keeping count years ago.
“No. Well, yes.” John smiles with clear eyes and holds Sherlock’s gaze. “I do, but  - they’re true. I mean, they read like you’re being truthful. They sound true. And – well, we don’t talk like that, do we?” John takes a sip. “They make me feel very …. important. I mean, important in your eyes. ”
Sherlock doesn’t listen. Everything he needs to know comes in a continuous wave of words and symbols as he studies the victim.
"So these are text book killings. There's no sexual element, no power element, no torture - just straight out stabbings performed with a generic, untraceable weapon, designed to bring death relatively quickly."
Mycroft hitched Albion slightly higher over his pinstriped shoulder and gave me his grave, sneering look. I’ve told him many times he should have it patented.
Greg takes charge. “Thank you for seeing us, Mrs Best.  My name is Greg Lestrade, and this is Sherlock Homes and Dr John Watson. I’m sorry that we don’t have any news,  but like the police liaison said, we do revisit cold cases, and we want to see if there is anything you can tell us that might help us as we review this case.”
Sherlock waits until they are in the cab home before he looks at John. His eyes are hard and hurt. “What is your problem?”
It's the kindest thing anyone has said to John in years and he smiles broadly, dipping his face in appreciation.
“He was coming to look at the flat we ended up sharing. I liked him when I first met him, the day before, but when I saw him the second time, waiting at the door, I liked him a lot more. I’d looked forward to seeing him again all day. He had a limp and he was angry.”
Left home yesterday without his wallet and phone, looking to end it all. So he's left things behind at the Warlock's house. Military man wouldn't leave a mess. He's packed already. Not that he has much anyway. Eight years away, last year in spiralling depression - hardly going to be accumulating anything. Besides a cat. Can he bring his cat here? Cats are interesting. Could experiment on a cat. To an extent. Could John come here and be in my home? He has a gun and is
The dead man has taken one substantial blow to the face and lies flat on his back, eyes fixed at the ceiling while small streams of blood and pale fluid dry on his face.
I was aware of some of those details about Mrs Watson a few months before and told John the bare essentials; he in turn cut all contact with me until that night, when he stormed out of the marital home and charged over to my home, blaming me for the whole crumbling mess. (I had nothing to do with it, for a change. John was upset and, as I’ve described, he can get fired up.)
Second, he wanted to relocate Rhonda. He hated the house but had the means to get away. Rhonda hated the house too but had neither the thumbs nor skills to escape and they'd become good mates. He wanted to help her.
“Oh! That reminds me! We had a client day before yesterday who mentioned something about a missing child. Do you have files on missing kids that have never been found? Anything I could look at, at least?”
My entire village agreed that assembling toys is the eighth circle of hell. Nothing fits and the manual is apparently written to make the whole process as difficult as possible.
I was changing Albion’s nappy. I’d bought him some new nappy covers from a brilliant firm in London who will make designs to your specifications.
He was very energetic this night, active and a little bossy. It was intensely arousing. The arm wrestle had been beneficial.
“I have no idea. If it weren’t for the fact I have a son, I wouldn’t believe that I actually did it. I certainly didn’t go there to have sex. I just wanted to smoke heroin.”
“Well, I have, when I was in Afghanistan. And with people from other countries who weren’t supportive of the occupying forces. The Medecin San Frontiers personnel were every where, and France was very opposed to the whole operation.”
“The child’s fallen, is unconscious, and Julia has panicked like any normal person would. Unfortunately, rather than try and get help, she has thought only of herself and concealed the child as quickly as possible. She’s brought her here, and probably thought she could keep her hidden until she woke up. I’d wager she checked her a couple of times, and then realised she was dead – and that she had got away with it.”
They’re actually like little flatmates. They have expectations and requirements, and they take up a lot of space. In fact, adult flatmates are actually much easier to live with, largely because they can tell you what they want or explain how you’re disappointing them. Babies require you to deduce.
"So what I'm saying, basically, is that every dealer expects their foot soldiers to rip them off a bit. Ten quid here, five quid there - it doesn't matter. Probably wouldn't even notice it, actually."
I am, however, very opposed to a one-size-fits-all practice of psychology and believe that this is precisely what is offered by a lot of clinics.  Three Years Active Service Watson suffered enormously from poor treatment like this. He had a psychosomatic limp, for God’s sake, and no one had worked out why, or even tried to assist him with it. By way of treatment they gave him a cane and had him write a blog.
Knowing the intractable Watson like I do, and based on my recent deductions of Nanny Anya, I’m assuming they’ll still be staring each other out when Albion graduates from university.)
“No. It’s far more simple that that. You simply up the stakes, and make your own  game that’s just a little bit better, so they want to join you.”
“Well, he comes around most morning and never sets a time. This afternoon he said he’d be here tomorrow at 8am.”
“Was Mariah a friendly child? Would she, do you think, have gotten into a car with a stranger?” Lestrade asks.
“And Inspector Lestrade! If it isn’t my lucky day. Don’t know who you are, sweetheart,” he leered at Sally, “But I bet you’re from Scotland Yard too. What a bonus.”
"You're an intelligent man who has followed orders while living on your wits in unnaturally hostile conditions for eight years. Clearly you thrived, or you never would have lasted eight years. The only thing that stopped you doing that was a bad injury, not a mental breakdown. You had the break down after the injury, obviously. "
I wasn’t convinced, but I wasn’t much interested either. I was reading the paint cans. John Watson had chosen two colours – sky and cloud.
Greg has visited so many that they are mere tunnels to him now, a site through which he must walk in the hope that there is light at the end.
Neither of us knew how to respond. It was too shocking. The more we thought about it, the more ludicrous it seemed.
John has to steel himself to look at her. It's hard. She's so young, slight and pretty with a mane of wild shiny curls that fan across her back, dressed in tight jeans and pink sneakers and a floppy fleece top. Amongst a number of small deep scratches on her neck there's two irregular crimson wounds coated in bright clotted blood that has spilt to form a generous glossy pool around her face and a gruesome bib across her fleece.
John grips the uninjured side of Sherlock's face with his right hand and moves it a few inches away from his mouth. Sherlock freezes at the interruption; cold terror floods his belly, the horrible thought that he's misjudged once again and done entirely the wrong thing to his guest.
Nearby, Albion was tucked up soundly in his visiting basket, perfectly peaceful with his exquisite little fists folded on either side of his face and his mouth delicately closed as he slept and gathered his strength to keep John and I awake all night. The love in my heart flooded over the top.
“No, you two don’t want me hanging around like the proverbial gooseberry. Lovely to meet you Annette, and I hope you have a memorable night.”
skulked through the room, crouched down low as if it thought that keeping close to the floor might make it invisible.
Sherlock dips out enough tongue so John can see the tiny cut. "That will heal very quickly if you rest it for a few minutes," he suggests.
Later that day the black shiny car returns but minus the mysterious texting brunette. Sherlock and John sit quite separate in the back seat, staring out the window.
John slapped me lightly on the left buttock, which was beginning to become a little habit. “Go have a shower and we’ll talk.”
"Well, it took me a long time to put those stitches in and they're beautifully even. I didn't want them ruined by some sadistic coke fiend."
“Oh,” is all he can answer. “Oh. Of course.” And when he’s processed it a bit, “Why do you need to learn that?”
Sherlock can see there are some things he has to unpack here. He goes back to the John Room in his mind palace while he bites carefully at a slice of pizza, looking for the anchovy because a burst of salt is a great accompaniment to thinking:
“Well, it’s an experiment in a way because I’m not certain what the outcome will be, but of course I know exactly what I’m doing.” Sherlock’s talking too fast and his eyes are bright with anticipation.
John and I are not men to whom frank and honest discussion about our feelings comes easily. In almost every instance, we’d much prefer not to discuss them at all. But that morning, we were closer and more settled, which was lucky because our biggest hurdle was waiting for us at 8 am.
"I'm friends with a forensic pathologist at St Barts. They let me use their facilities sometimes and when I need a body part, they help out."
“You most certainly have a sock index. I can make you a real one if you like.” Sherlock’s eyes grow brighter still as one of his most treasured dreams comes tantalizingly close. “You know John, if you want to sleep in here, share this room with me, I could make us a COMBINED sock index.” He talks as if he’s offering the Hope diamond.
John, who was thinking about the dead person, looked like he got off a train at the wrong station. “What? Why do I want balloons?”
“No, I haven’t. If I do, I’ll tell you.” She chewed her thin lips for a moment. “You do know he will come back to you, don’t you?”
Meanwhile Uncle Rudy pilfers a couple of items from Sherlock’s room, and calls for Mycroft, who is obedient as always and in any case, has finished the biscuits.
“Oh, you’d be surprised. Shut up and listen. The Prince loved puzzles and loved working things out. His mother, who had been a very talented mathematician before she was lumbered with babies, taught him to do sums at a very early age, and taught him how to find the answer by eliminating the false.”
“Shut up. The Prince gave the Detective all kinds of information, which led to the arrest of all three assailants. And the Detective came back two nights later to ask the Prince’s opinion about something else. And so on.”
John bites his lip and taps the cage gently. Quick and sharp, like a bandaid, he tells himself. "Bye Rhonda. Be nice to the residents."
“Well, John works shifts at St Barts, so mostly I attend to Albion at night. I let him cry, and tell him stories, which sometimes put him back to sleep. Sometimes John will take him if he’s awake.”
His mother is furious. “For God’s sake, Jem, if you wanted something we would have given you the money!”
At that time I had grown quite unhinged – depression maybe, post traumatic stress definitely, and wasn’t able to fight him like he wanted me to fight him. He had just lost his daughter and was in terrible pain, but all I could do was stare at him and think how much I loved him, and how ill-equipped I was to deal with his tragedy.
John looks back out the window, seeing London with slightly different eyes, watching the old buildings and the ubiquitous shine of recent rain shimmer under the lights. It looks new and familiar, like it would look to someone who has come home after a long exile.
They walk side by side through sharp cold air. Sherlock's explaining the best way to serve parmesan cheese and the importance of pepper grinders, John's asking interested questions, both are enjoying each other's company immensely, unaware that they are starting the pattern that will be theirs alone for many, many years.
Bonnie is a delight to us all. She likes stories, smearing her face with jam, hearing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on the violin and stomping all over whatever her big brother is doing. She’s cheerful and outgoing, a happy, content little girl who has, with her tiny hands and little squeals of laugher, smoothed all the jagged scars on John’s heart.  He hasn’t had a nightmare since she was born.
“Because if I need to get away quickly I can. It just makes me feel better, okay? And I know it is utterly pointless for me to say this at all but for pity’s sake - stay out of my fucking room.”
It should have been strange, to be suddenly co-parenting with a man I had loved secretly for almost five years, but John Watson fitted into our little family very quickly, mostly, I think, because there had been an empty space with his name on it for so long.
The whole room is quiet. Spoonfuls of cake stall mid-air between paper plates and open mouths. Every set of his colleagues' eyes are on him and his skin burns, his hand stills and his leg is for a few seconds entirely pain free.
Then there were chocolates. Obviously eating chocolates was lovely but why make a gift of them? They could buy chocolates any time. John occasionally bought chocolate biscuits. There were chocolates in the newsagents, great big rows of them which Sherlock considered lunch in some circumstances. Chocolates were practical, not romantic. Besides, no chocolate could in any way illustrate, for Sherlock, the depth and intensity of his feeling for John.
“She will likely know where the father is, if I can’t find any record of him. Ex-wives frequently know where their ex-husband is, even if they hate them. She will also have some view as to whether he had any possible involvement.”
The interview goes around in circles for a few pages, and then another detective starts asking questions about the child’s relationship with her mother.
“It’s clear Albion has given you full permission to parent him. He never lets me make those noises on his stomach. And in case you’re still insecure, I think Albion is the luckiest baby in London to be getting constant care from his doctor. Do you do that for all your patients?”
There are a whole lot of other factors that hindered us, dull things we kept doing wrong – John dating a string of colourless women, both of us playing chicken with criminals every week, me declaring my sociopathy as a warning, my fake suicide, John marrying a psychopathic assassin – and these are precisely the reasons that I thought it was high time John Watson and I threw caution to the wind and rushed into one another’s arms. All the bad things that could possibly happen have happened to us, along with some impossible bad things that no one could imagine. We’ve endured it all and still we’re friends.
"The thing that interests me most", and he pauses just in time to delicately remove a small piece of gristle from the sandwich, "is that there's a female victim too. Makes you wonder who exactly he's killing. Does he know them, or just know about them? You know, like a hired killer."
Albion roared louder. I had read that new born babies miss being in the womb for their first few days so I had wrapped him up very securely and was pacing the floor, holding him very close to my chest while I tried to work out what I could do to recreate the womb for him. The only thing I could think of was the bags that apparently go in the old vacuum cleaner.
Because he understands crimes like these so clearly, thinks John. Because he can see the reason and the cause of everything, because he has perfect 20-20 vision of all the plain and terrible things that the rest of the world never notices.
“Ah, Doctor Watson,” my brother sang as he waltzed through the door. “How lovely it is to see that we have at least one grown up at 221b.”
Lestrade followed me to the kitchen while I grabbed another bottle. I could feel him thinking: Sherlock’s stolen a baby.
John intervenes delicately to contain any malfunction. “I love being held like this,” he says dreamily.
“I have no idea. Actually, they all have some context while we’re – well, in flagrante delicto, don’t they?”
“Here, your table is free! Let me open some wine for you. What a wonderful family you have! I will personally make a meal for the bambino. Baby spaghetti!
“No, no,” said Mycroft, ever the public servant. “The public have a right to expect that their taxes fund a competent agency that will ensure child safety is a top priority.”
They’re not sure how to proceed. While John pours a plastic mug of milk for Rosie, and Sherlock butters some wholemeal bread for her, they wonder who they should contact first.
Molly was pleased to see me but, I deduced, not entirely happy with the way things had turned out. I was unable to deal with any aspect of that so pretended it wasn’t happening.
John shrugged. We were both lying on our sides, heads propped up on our hands. Albion was still sleeping on the rug between us. It seemed John and I re-establishing our close ties bored him.
The matter was heard in a large room like a boardroom. Adrienne sat opposite us; Mycroft a few seats down at the end of the table. He was, he insisted, allowed to attend. My astute baby cried quite emphatically when the hearing started, and calmed only when John Watson took him and patted his back.
"The front desk and the triage nurse. So I need you to hold onto your heart like this" - and John clutches the left side of his chest - "and tell them you've got pains in your chest. Okay?"
“It’s actually quite smart,” Sherlock answers. “Any sighting of a child wearing two shoes could be discounted. A child wearing one should would stand out.”
Sherlock is sitting on the steps of an ambulance with a mango-coloured blanket draped over his shoulders. Lestrade is standing at his feet, smirking a little.
So while John wasn’t observing, Sherlock, who loves to prove or disprove a theory, set about researching ways he could be romantic.
(It wasn’t my fault. I can’t help deducing people. Sometimes when I’m voicing my deductions the noises in my brain are so loud, I can’t even hear myself. Often when I can hear myself I still get surprised that everyone else can’t see what appears to be so obvious.)
He can manage the administration and has even started to become quite adept at spreadsheets but the nature and philosophy of the work galls him. Doctors don't want to be bullied by pharmaceutical companies yet here he is, a doctor employed expressly to supervise people who bully doctors into taking meetings from pharmaceutical companies.
The officers were very impressed with the child’s evidence. They spoke about at length with colleagues, how bright the this little boy was, how, even in his evident grief, he was able to describe the accident in clear detail, and with great accuracy. He even remembered the colour of the car’s interior upholstery.
“I hope she never asks us how we got together,” John remarks. He lays on his side, one leg hooked artlessly over Sherlock, smiling into his face.
After the stress of meeting his grandparents, Albion roared at me on and off for hours with his lovely little red mouth, which interested me enormously because he had no teeth, but I knew there teeth just below the surface, waiting to pop up like crocus do at the end of winter. I looked into his little mouth for probably too long, and then I told him a story.
(While three’s no doubt Mycroft was impressed by John’s bravery, he used this phrase entirely for my entertainment. His tireless campaign to ensure my contentment is an ongoing burden and blessing.)
"The police consult me about certain crimes, yes. But they're not my only client. Sometimes private citizens will come to me with cases and if they're interesting, I'll take them."
“Oh, I’ve seen them,” Molly says from the front, “I’d love to get one but I’m useless at putting those things together.”
Despite the fact the file is quite comprehensive,  very few details are recorded about Julia. She was 28 – a little older than Mariah’s parents - she worked at a company that imported wine,  and she met Mr Best through work because he ran a small firm that distributed fine wines to restaurants.
Sherlock walked back alone to sit on the other side of his mother, where he watched the old boat take the flames, burn brightly for a few brief moments before it disintegrated, some parts sinking to the cold floor of the sea, and other pieces floating away forever.
The grooms-to-be are lying naked side by side on their bed, far too excited to sleep.  They are to be married tomorrow at the Chelsea Town Hall. Their new suits fit perfectly and hang side by side in the wardrobe. Fifty people have been invited to witness the vows, and to join them afterwards at the Criterion for a wedding breakfast.
St Bart’s is only ten minutes walk from my flat so we got to test-drive the pram, which everyone we passed peered in, mostly because it was being pushed by a man and men with prams interest people.
“Jesus, I am pathetic,” John says quite loudly as he walks towards Charring Cross. A few people eye him warily and step imperceptibly out of his path.
“Why”, he giggled when we had both bought each other great satisfaction, “are we doing this in the shower?”
“It gets better. Although obviously it gets a lot worse first. Shut up. So the Prince went to university and graduated very well and then thought he’d do some post graduate work, partly because he had no idea what to do but mostly because he had a terrible crush on another post grad student from his college.”
"You could observe and give me your opinions. It would be helpful. Police crime scene specialists are appalling. I've always wanted an assistant. An army doctor who's used to gore would be a very helpful addition. Besides, I like the company. It's helpful to think out loud."
Sherlock reads the entirely inadequate autopsy reports, scoffs at the scabby crime scene descriptions and snorts at the assessment of the evidence left at the crime scenes.
“Start by lifting your chin up. That’s an important thing to do, especially if you’re staking an airfield at night and want to identify what kind of plane is overhead. Boeing jets and Airbuses sound very similar after they’ve attained an altitude of 7000 feet, so you need to look at them and see the placement of the engines. Should we ask Anya to teach you how to do that?”
"No need to justify it. It makes perfect sense. What else could you have done? You've followed pretty standard advice and it's made you more ill than you were because the therapist prescribed the wrong treatment for you."
There is an ominous shuffling sound from the end of the hall. It grows louder step by step, and both men look up expectantly at an ancient bowed figure clutching a glossy black phone in his left hand.
Uncle Rudy looks at the clothes with a soft sigh. He would have loved this very wardrobe of clothes as a child.  “Well, we’ve got just the thing. You change into this” – he lays a frilly blouse and some trousers on the bed – “and I’ll get a few more essentials. Don’t forget your wellies.”
When he’s calmed himself he sits up and John sets back, on his knees now so Sherlock can taste him. He makes slow deliberate sips along the shaft, rubbing his lips over the glans and dabbing the syrupy slit with the tip of his tongue. John’s hands are all over him. Fuck, Sherlock, he pants, oh fuck, stop, stop, stop now. Sherlock leans back and watches as John presses tightly with thumb and forefinger just below the tip of his own cock, face strained as he suppresses his orgasm.
There is no staff available to gather boxes, so John has hired a van, and Sherlock has come to help collect the boxes because, despite his scepticism, he is curious to see how John might approach this matter. Besides, these are cold cases. He ‘s sure he will solve a couple while John looks for the ghost child.
“Mr Albion has been resting for most of the day. He had some custard for lunch, and I have made him some sauced apple for his supper.”
“I’m Dr John Watson. I’m Albion’s doctor. If you have any inquiries about his health you can deal with me.”
John hears small thumps and a couple of squeals, then a collection of hurried footsteps approaching from different parts of the house.
“You must learn. You will find yourself nourished by both the good food and the privilege of having good food.”
He made a crinkled-nosed face at me. “Polka dots. Never you mind what I’m going to paint. Just don’t touch a drop until I’ve finished.”
“Sherlock,” John asked with a full mouth, his lips glazed with butter, “I don’t understand how you can suddenly cook.”
John doesn’t agree or disagree, but gets into a cab with Sherlock and stares at his hands as the cab moves into the traffic.
“She fooled us all. John caught her in the prosthesis. It was very messy. The situation, I mean. He left her and she’s now in South Africa, I believe.”
“It’s for the best,” Mycroft tells his little brother. “Eurus is far more clever than you and I and even Mummy and Papa combined and multiplied by a thousand. She needs to have very clever people helping her learn even more things, and there aren’t any people clever enough in all of England to help her.”
Sherlock found it hard to contain his joy at seeing his friend. “You look so grown up!” he told Victor, who indeed was a little taller, his hair shorter and he seemed – well, nothing specific but something not quite discernible, and he would not let go of his father’s hand. The trio walked down the quite road that lead to the main road, and waited patiently to cross it , Sherlock chattering that Eurus would be home for the break later that day, and that they would all play again with the boat, and Mycroft had hinted that he might have a map of buried treasure!
“You can’t stop coming here, John. I hate that I’ve made a place that’s so much a part of our lives into somewhere you dread. So I’m changing it. You won’t think of this place as the place where I died anymore. In future whenever you see or think of St Barts you’ll remember it as the place your idiot flat mate brought you to tell you that he loves you.”
On this sombre morning, Sherlock knew also that it would be would be disastrous for heterosexual John to have any clue that Sherlock was in pain. A silent getaway was needed.
“Oh.” I couldn’t have been expected to deduce that from John’s ambiguous comment, especially while we were eating the best chips in London.
On his first day at home, Victor and his father came calling, to invite Sherlock to join them for a visit in the sweet shop in the local village. Rudy and Papa had gone to meet Mummy and Eurus at the airport; Mycroft graciously agreed that Sherlock could go, and folded a pound note into his little brother’s pocket.
“Well, maybe she told her that she was going to see daddy.,” Greg suggests as he locks the car. “That would have calmed her down.”
It is perfectly feasible, and the cause of immeasurable sadness to me, that I might never see him again.
“Oh! Hello! Why are you here?” John has finished work and is surprised to see Sherlock waiting for him.
Having the house to himself and five days free of squalid humping in every room should have been a cause for celebration, but John is barely moved. Nothing surprises, interests or delights him any more.
Sherlock knew the moment a shamefaced Jeremy skulked down the stairs that there was no mistake. It was the same person he had seen on the CCTV footage. (Jeremy was also currently reading The Scarlet Letter, a rugby player and a voracious consumer of Weetabix. Sherlock mentally swatted at those useless deductions, catching them like flies and stuffing them in a mental folder.)
would never serenade anyone, unless you counted Mrs Hudson which, love her though he did in his way, he didn't.
“Why do I even need to see her? And has she admitted stealing that money? Does she want more?  And how could she even have any rights to transfer? John Watson does more for Albion in thirty seconds than she did in the three days she knew him. She wouldn’t even hold him!” I was getting angry now.
The quiche is interesting. Half of it has slices of tomato cooked over the surface, the other half has no tomato.
Better to face it head on, so I wrapped Albion up in his best bunny rug (it is covered in actual bunny prints – Peter Rabbit, to be exact) (I have a weakness for brass buttons), tried to smooth down his hair and took him down stairs to meet his landlady.
I left soon after. Lestrade was satisfied with my deductions and Lewisham is a long way from home. In any case, I had to get home to start preparing for tummy time.
John halts as if he doused in ice water. “A prostitute? You’re seeing a prostitute?  Is that for a case?”
Nothing could have prepared me for the fear children cause you. Not just the large, typical fears of sickness and tragedy, but the small unavoidable fears that they’ll have friends, that they’ll get chosen for games at parties, that their tiny, tender feelings won’t be wounded. Two of the greatest reliefs I’ve known is the realisation that my boy isn’t bothered by an onslaught of continual harsh thought like I was, and that already he has little friends at school and in the park. He can make friends. I hope he won’t ever know loneliness like I did.
“No.” John answers instantly, his body calm but his eyes filling with wild panic. “No. I can’t. Can’t Molly help – what about Mike” -
The Detective Inspector came striding in, looking around in case there was a clue, any clue, that might be useful in any of the countless criminal investigations his team were currently failing to solve. He takes that approach everywhere. He’s always looking for clues and so rarely finding any.
Sherlock looks at him calmly. "I can thee your dog tagth." He takes a breath, about to ask questions associated with the more important deductions and observations he's made, but decides he needs to be stitched first. "Sixthy two minutes."
Mike’s an interesting man, entirely dull in most ways but a very effective talker. He will make five or six pertinent points in a few brief sentences. I like this because it saves time.
“No. Ademar is a gay man too. He’s – helping me be a gay man. I’ve come to the party a little late.”
My boy grew more interesting by the second, an entire person who fitted effortlessly into my hands. I’d never wanted to know a person as keenly as I wanted to know him. He was a blank slate, entirely beyond deduction.
“Well, as a rough translation – they’re indicating weights of whatever is inside and the amount of packages the container contains.” I studied the words more closely. “This container holds shipment of bags – suitcases, actually – and the packages are all in the lining.”
Anya settled in very quickly. She was incredibly efficient and held curious views on a range of topics.
In the late afternoon he tidied his desk and left his computer on so his spreadsheets could be accessed. Tomorrow he planned to call in sick. He left the office that night with a sort of thickness in his heart but not sorry and not regretful. Shona, as always, didn't look up as he walked past her desk and for a second he almost stopped and asked her out for a drink, thinking he might be able to rectify her displeasure with him. But what the hell. What difference does it make.
“We woke up just after six. Mariah had her own room, and she usually came to wake me up so I would make her breakfast. She didn’t wake me that morning, I woke up when the cat jumped off the bed.” She stopped as John gently lifted the dressing from the wound. The bandage has left ridges of compression on her flesh, and John gently rubs the red skin to encourage the blood flow.
John Watson smiled at me across the table and when Angelo poured the wine, we clinked glasses across the table.
It is Sherlock’s handwriting, so there is no doubt as to who wrote it. It’s just – well, sentiment. Sherlock claimed he had none and here it is, lines and lines of it.  John is so stunned that he reads his poem again.  His shock hasn’t subsided when he finishes so he reads it a third time.
“Washington is very close to New York. I must have got confused.” Mycroft gave me his most oleaginous smile.
John is gob smacked. He wants all the details in chronological order but has no idea where to start.
"Mrs Hudson! Once again you have improved the quality of my life immeasurably. I can't thank you enough."
Sherlock is curdling with embarrassment. Billy, a kindly soul when he's not hell bent on garroting someone, is considering Sherlock’s issues when he suddenly understands the real problem.
“Perfectly. I have cold files to work on. In any case, Anya brings Albion in to check on me frequently, so I never get the chance to get into any serious trouble.”
“Rosehip oil,” John says softly. “It helps fade scars.” He repeats the same litany he did last night and Sherlock listens to every word. He would have been safe in Serbia if John had been there, he is certain.
Molly was thrilled to show off her excellent wound catalogue. I was thrilled to learn she had such a catalogue.
It transpired she was a originally a Canadian citizen who held dual citizenship with the United States. Her father was a police officer. She had joined the CIA after college – in some clerical capacity, John thought  -  and turned out to have an aptitude for target practice. She was trained as an agent on the basis of this skill and left after fifteen years to freelance as an assassin. Not surprisingly, killing people for a fee turned out to be hazardous and made her a target amongst some very undesirable people in the United States. She and her family sought refuge here, and she had targeted John as the perfect disguise.
John nods, despite not having been present at what seem to be interesting negotiations. "I hope to see you in there often."
Kill yourself. Kill you. John inches through this carefully, spreading the words apart, joining them back together. Killing myself. Me. He means me.
I had just started cursing when I saw a large manila envelope on which John had written my name and underlined it twice.
There's the hand coming down to strike the throat of the only person who has treated John with understanding in the long, empty months since he's come home.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock answers, and he really doesn’t. He holds his hand out in front of him and wonders what it is like, to have some one take your hand and hold it. Why do people do that? What’s the point?
I had to think about for a few moments. I wasn’t sure what to respond because I couldn’t decide if it was correct or ludicrous.
“No. Some gay men prefer one or the other, some like both, some like neither. But that’s something we can explore next time. I thought tonight we might do some warm-up exercises that work for a top, bottom or versatile gay man.”
John sniffs slightly. “Well, we’re off to hear the London Symphony Orchestra, and then to that new place in Soho for some dancing.”
But it is none of these. Instead John Watson has just received his first ever poem, written completely for him by the one person who loves him more than he has been able to say:
“Then you’ve got time to find the offender. This is no random place for two drinking buddies. They’ve been here deliberately - to check the money they’ve stolen, maybe add to it or subtract a sum, although I expect they were waiting on a delivery. The man who hit him has walked away – or maybe been called away – and left our subject here to wake up, or get up, if he was still conscious.”
“Meanwhile, I’m going to tell you a fascinating story about some cats. They lived in a large group in an old house, sharing all their food and assets. This is called a collective, which is different to that trio of pigs I’ve told you about, who only lived in the same house so they could share the rent.
One of the more humourless visiting psychiatrists, a tall greasy man from Quantico, concluded that Eurus was not a sociopath at all – in fact, quite the opposite: her feelings were not only as imprecise and intense as most people, but commensurate with her superlative gift of reason and comprehension.
“She’s dangerous,” he tells Mummy and Papa plainly.  “These drawings are not fanciful, they’re an agenda. I fear that she is a sociopath in the embryonic stages, who needs help before she does something deadly.”
That night had been a long one. Sherlock had to walk for miles through his palace’s corridors and the deductions were arduous. When he finished he felt foolish because it had been there all along: John surely loved him too. Who else would continue to make him tea after so many appalling transgressions? Who else licked their lips when they looked at him? Who else laughed at his jokes? Who else hugged him when he said nice things at their wedding? Who else shot a morally decrepit cab driver to save his life?
“You keep me right, John,” Sherlock pants as he humps still, exhausted but unable to stop, grimacing at the friction now. He shifts to cradle John’s head with his right arm.
He languishes in the caresses as Sherlock measures the length of his back and touches each tiny mark there.
“I hate negligent driving cases,” Sherlock huffs at John when he’s off the phone. “They’re so OBVIOUS.”
Instead of ironing the garment to drape on a hanger, John ironed everything into neat folded squares, squares that could be packed in a suitcase.
John has bent down with some discomfort to retrieve the paper. His heart sinks as he reads the position for a manager of sales team in a pharmaceutical company. "I can't do this," he says miserably but Beverly is already cooing over the phone at someone in the pharmaceutical company
The judge was wondering how Adrienne and I ever managed to make a baby. John Watson was wondering the same thing.
John’s purpose becomes clear as Sherlock’s eyes grow heavy. He wants his part in this. He couldn’t help me while I was there, but he can help now.
“No. Shut up. The Prince lived with the Woodsman and they had the most wonderful times together. The Prince was still an idiot but the Woodsman was so patient, and he liked all the trouble the Prince got into and generally they had a marvelous time, until they met another Prince who was very evil and tried to kill them both.”
Our second attempt at congress was only a little more successful than the first. We used the shower this time, which was actually quite uncomfortable but very funny because it was so inelegant. Our height difference didn’t assist matters, but John Watson insisted that the best part of having sex with some one you love is that it’s with someone you love, and even if you’re being blinded by shower spray and certain you’re both about to slip over and break your back.
John handed me a warm bottle and Albion cooed. My boy was becoming very good at deducing small things. “Of course. But we’re going to have breakfast first, and I’m going to read the paper.”
“I know how it sounds,” she sighs. “I don’t believe in ghosts. I’m not even interested in ghosts. If someone told me this I’d tell them they need to see a doctor. But it’s happening to me, I and I don’t know what to do.”
Everything indeed - she has ordered in an inexplicable selection of lamb curry, Chinese dumplings, garlic bread, pad thai and chicken kiev.
Everyone looks down at Sherlock’s pale creamy feet and the deep dark toenails. Tension and an unrecognizable fear knot John’s shoulder and neck muscles into hard little mats.
Sherlock can see this and tosses him a lifeline. "You're fine to practice." He watches how carefully John prepares the dressing, how carefully he applies it to the slightly throbbing wound. "Are you living alone?"
Albion’s wardrobe at this stage was made of lounge wear and casual day clothes. Amongst the latter I’d assembled the John Watson Collection, which included a number of striped t-shirts and some dark stretchy leggings that referenced Dr Watson’s choice in trousers.
Yet here he is, solidified at his table and surrounded by twenty eight different feathers organized in a row according to their height, trying to understand that maybe it wasn’t always him. Worse, much worse, maybe it never was.
Molly has agreed to take the autopsy as a priority, even though she now supervises two new forensic pathologists who are capable of doing the job.
Sherlock continues to pester John about his speech for the entire two months leading up to their wedding. When he is not pestering John, he pesters every single person who is invited to the wedding, all of whom have been instructed expressly not to assist him.
I have to keep that in perspective: he forgave his wife for lying about her name, shooting me the first time, her past, mostly everything, but can’t hear me telling him that I love him.
“I can’t tell if he likes it or hates it,” I complained to John, who was laying Albion over his shoulder and preparing for some heavy duty patting and pacing.
“What’s wrong with your back?” John asked once or twice, although he didn’t think the back was sore. He thought that Sherlock disliked the contact and was trying to set physical distance between them.
“Mouth,” John says instantly. He’s had hundreds of blowjobs but never  anticipated one as desperately as this. He moans loudly for Sherlock and Mrs Hudson, about to mount the stairs with a tray of cake and tea, makes a dear little face and retreats gracefully to her flat.
“I don’t know how I feel about this, Mycroft. It ‘s very sudden. And John can’t be expected to make a decision of this magnitude after only a couple of months.”
"Elderly patients in a care facility? I doubt they'd notice or, even if they did, do you think they'd remember?"
“Yes,” John agrees, no less shell-shocked than his mate. “A big walk. And I have to go to bed early. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“I know. I had no idea that I would be remotely interested in a child at all. But I just adored him the moment I saw him. The hospital staff hated me because I wouldn’t go home. They kept kicking me out. I hated being separated from him. That was weird.”
“My mother said the same thing. You’re right. He is endlessly absorbing. And now that he actually talks back – well, when I say talk – you know what I mean. But yes. He interests me continuously.”
They discuss the cases while they eat. Many of the files are very old, and belong to a time of carbon paper, hand written notes and much less efficient policing. Sherlock is annoyed by the scant amount of detail, and the inability of the police to conduct proper interviews, all of which is evident in the older files. John agrees, and wonders how the parents coped when their child appeared to have vanished, and why Police rarely undertook a proper investigation.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Everybody see things. That just don't pay attention. I observe everything. There's a difference. Do you want to go to the hospital and steal the cat back?"
He would have to make John tea sometimes. Drugging John was now out of the question, unless there were exceptional dangerous circumstances that would be alleviated by John being drugged.  Science was no longer an excuse to drug John.
“It made sense, when I thought about it. I do like danger. I like to push myself to my limits. That’s what I want my romantic relationships to be like. It made sense that I ‘d sense those things about her and find them attractive. But then I kept wondering, why did she chose me? I used to think she chose me because, well, you know, she fell in love with a man who was a doctor and a soldier, and I thought she must have seen how much I wanted to settle down and start a family.”
“He doesn’t look at it,” I explained. “He likes to look at the wallpaper, and sometimes we look out the window to see if the weather is changing” -
It was late in the afternoon when he remembered that John wasn’t with him. John loved cracked teeth, or least Sherlock thought he did. He should be here to see this one.
John appears at that moment. He is wearing a blue shirt with dark trousers and looks rather handsome. He is also wearing the Serge Luten scent Sherlock gave him for Christmas last year and it smells – as Sherlock knew it would – sublime on his skin.
Albion began to cry, and not without reason. No one wants to hear that their parent is just one species on the evolutionary chart from eating them.
“I don’t honestly know.” This was the truth. I felt something huge and unyielding but had no idea what.
“I did,” Mycroft called from the kitchen, “But not in a nasty way. You just looked so soft and chewy.”
“Mummy’s right.” My father was reluctantly being relieved of Albion. “I’m astounded at how well you’re coping, especially in such odd circumstances.” He leaned forward and lowered his voice. “Mycroft told us all about the mother, poor little girl.”
Mummy wondered, given Eurus’s evident understanding, if the child might accept an honest explanation, and if this might help restore her self esteem. She had her husband send a home movie, a special little compilation of a very happy time.
Sherlock returns with a haphazard armful of bedding and a sealed bottle of lubricant, both of which he drops on the floor.
He chose a molar that, to his great delight, cracked in two when it was prised from the cold gum tissue.
"I find degenerative brain diseases endlessly absorbing. Some hospitals are actually working with Alzheimer's patients to create surroundings that are familiar to them - that is, entering their world instead of struggling to keep them in ours. Interesting how easy it was talk to poor Ida when I entered her world."
Neither John nor I are partial to emotional, heartfelt conversations, no matter how necessary they might be. Because of this, we both wondered privately exactly what was going to become of us. When we first met five years ago, we worked on cases together, and in between cases, John doctored at a local clinic.
The nurse was satisfied with the little tube of blood, holding up to the light as if she expected to see spiders floating there.  I wanted to snatch it from her immediately but had to watch calmly as she handed it to Molly, who slipped it respectfully in a little bag so it could go to the path lab downstairs.
John gets out of bed, enjoying the newfound strength in his leg, and reaches out his hand to Sherlock. Sherlock looks startled for a moment before reaching out, himself.
John’s shoulders sag and his face reveals how tired he is. Sherlock sees this and softens his own posture.
In time he began to gain weight, ran for longer when on a chase, and eventually came to the conclusion that from time to time,  John was actually right.
"It's alright." John replied, watching Sherlock closely. "We just have to take it easy for a while".
"We couldn't all be intellectual babies. What was your first word then? Murder? Bored?" John asked, smiling at the thought of Sherlock as a baby. He could probably read and write in Latin at the age of two- a far stretch but he had learned to overestimate when it came to Sherlock.
That was incentive enough for Sherlock, running on fumes at this point, to turn his and look at John, his gaze soft. "I know, John. It's just that while I'm having some "shut-eye" or eating some fancy "kebab", people are getting murdered."
"-and absolutely necessary: it's hardly my fault you're so difficult. I know you wouldn't have eaten if you went on your own." John added, using Sherlock's scowl as clarification that he was right.
Sherlock couldn't be bothered to prolong the inevitable and so he muttered a bratty "Fine" before shoving his spoon into the porridge. John was shocked at how easy it was and suddenly felt embarrassed about his over the top outburst. He was happy though: if something other than negotiating could make Sherlock eat, then there was hope that Sherlock could realize his body was more than just "transport".
“His recent online activity suggests he is currently looking for a new flat.” Mycroft says, his grip tightening on his umbrella.
"I was Rosie's age when I first began speaking though she hasn't yet said her first word." Sherlock replied, his eyes never leaving her face. She was too busy trying to coordinate her hands into grabbing one of Sherlock's curls, something she had always been fascinated by. John watched on in amusement: both Sherlock and Rosie shared the same curious look. Sometimes John forgot that they weren't related.
John doesn’t move his hand away when Sherlock jumps at the sudden contact and it hurts him more than he can currently process. “You’re alright.” John soothes, squeezing his shoulder softly with another worried frown. He could see the wound wasn’t too deep and went about cleaning it using alcohol wipes from his first aid kit. “I think we might get away with taping it up. Did you pass out or feel sick or anything?”
No longer bed-bound, Sherlock was all over the flat doing his usual clattering about. John didn't want him to revert back to old habits, so he purchased a clock that would chime at seven, twelve and six- breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sherlock had tried to destroy it several times during the day, but John would slap the pipette of chemicals out of his hand or hide his gun to stop him trying to shoot at it again.
As soon as John lay eyes on him, he stormed over and grabbed hold of the door, not allowing it to open any further. "You better behave in there." John whispered, warning him with raised eyebrows. "They are both very hungover and one of them's quite upset with you. Let's not make it two for two, yeah?" Just as John moved out of the way to let him through, Mycroft couldn't help but scoff at John's effort to make him compliant.
Sherlock couldn't get enough of her laugh. He often memorized the sound to play in his mind palace for when he's away on a case and hasn't seen her for a while. When it's a particularly long case and Sherlock is away from the flat for days at a time, John would often call him on video chat so he could see her. "This is ridiculous, John." Sherlock would say, but John knew better.
John patted his hand and replied to him with a tight smile (he was still a bit pissed off) before turning and walking back up the stairs. In his room once again, he saw Sherlock spread out like a starfish, limbs stretched out to their full potential on top of the covers. John smiled fondly before taking off his shirt and rolling Sherlock slightly to the side, allowing just enough space for him to fit on the bed. Shuffling carefully under the covers, he turned his head towards Sherlock. He
“Piss off, Sherlock.” John snaps, his guilt tripling as soon as he’d spat the words. “Sorry, I’m sorry.” He whispers after a few moments, needing at least one of them to be alright. Running a hand through his hair, he looks first at Sherlock’s reddened wrist and then at Sherlock’s carefully blank eyes. “I can’t keep doing that to her. Can I-“
Once downstairs, he saw Greg sagged back against the couch. Sherlock would usually make a snide remark on his appearance. There were a number of options open to him: the unkempt beginnings of a beard; the dark circles under his eyes; the lack of honorable posture. But Sherlock knew how Greg felt, he just about made it down here without crawling on his hands and knees. For the first time in his life, Sherlock kept his mouth closed and sat down next to him. The silence, however awkward, was better than hurting Greg's feelings, still tender from yesterday. John sensed the tension, so with little else to do, he got up and switched the kettle on for a cup of tea. Living in London, it was engraved into the center of his brain that "tea fixed every problem".
He then stands away from John, to admire his reddening face. And when they walk away from the crime scene and John swears at him under his breath, Sherlock might as well have been skipping home.
He was just existing in this grey, empty box for no discernible reason. It’s understandable when his eyes sometimes shift towards his gun as they are doing now. The scrape of clay against wood startles his gaze to shift towards his mug, instead.
They’re lying on John’s bed. Well, Sherlock is, but he’s resting his head on John’s lap. It took a while for them to manage this, but Sherlock had grown stronger since their meeting and he took full advantage of this newfound strength.
He couldn't recall how long it had been, but their moment together was dismantled by the sound of Greg retching in the bathroom. Being a doctor, John wasn't too put off by it. What put him off was leaving Sherlock when he had just got him to unwind. He slowly sat up, Sherlock sitting up with him as if glued to his chest. After coaxing him off he gently lay him back down again, concerned when the detective started to shiver. Without hesitation, he started to wind the covers around Sherlock. He looked like an angry, little hurricane- Sherlock's agitated expression being the eye of the storm. "I'll be back soon, don't worry." John encouraged before running out of the bedroom and down to the bathroom. He got there just in time to see Greg hobbling out through the door with a gloomy face.
“Not forever, and not alone. Eurus is not being exiled. We will accompany her to Ludwig’s clinic. He is prepared to manage Eurus’s education. She will live there with two nurses, another doctor and she can see a range of visiting psychiatrists. She will have her intellectual curiousity satisfied continuously. She will be fed good meals, will enjoy regular play and exercise, and for intents and purposes, will have a healthy childhood. You and her brothers can visit whenever you wish. Sherlock and Mycroft can write and call. She will have all the support from, and contact with,  you that she needs.”
And the little bird hops up on to one of the bars and just sits, back to John as the cage door is locked behind him.
"I was able to prove that Renzo's brother Angelo wasn't responsible for a car jacking because he was in fact robbing a house a few miles away. With Renzo."
Regrettably I am unable to describe exactly what I was doing there for three weeks, obviously because I was tripping balls. I do know I shared a foul smelling mattress a lot of the time with a girl called Adrienne and and she, at one stage, offered to remove my stitches for me with a nail file. As far as I remember, she didn’t. I remember also that she smelt a little like damp hessian, aluminium foil and Yardley’s English Lavender.
“Mycroft had a nurse dress it when we got to Germany.” Sherlock flinches again when John runs his fingers over the scores.
While Sherlock scrambled another apology, John rubbed his face, closed his hand over his mouth and squeezed, trapping everything else he wanted to say. They moved around one another in an awkward dance – Sherlock with his hands outstretched, still trying after all these months to reconcile, while John shook his head in a poor effort to loosen his grief.
I couldn’t. I heard the instructions, and understood what he wanted me to do, but my arms wouldn’t budge.
“It’s heard before a judge at the family court, then papers are signed. I can organise to have the matter listed for hearing tomorrow.”
"There's a second room upstairs. I play the violin. Sometimes I don't talk for hours. Days if it's really bad. I like to do experiments."
She flashed me her rare, very straight wide smile. “You brother instructed me that, if you were to be asking that question, I was to tell you to mind your own business.”
It’s possible I sound like a cheap date, luring John Watson back into my bed before he’s unpacked his luggage.
That was definitely going to be a score for her, because until she mentioned it, it had never occurred to me to buy him toys.
"John Watson!" says a soft, slightly rotund bespectacled man perched on a stool in front of a range of slides.
“I know you let her win,” I whispered in his ear and I could feel his body straighten and strengthen as the muscles in his back grew taut. “Damn straight I did,” he whispered back.
It was a nice feed, that night. John held Albion and applied the bottle while leaning back against me in our bed. I had them both in my arms and felt rather smug. I wondered if all fathers felt like this when they have their family gathered around them.
The crib was fun. I had to put that together myself. I love those slips of paper with directions that tell you how to put all the pieces together. I set it next to the couch so we could sleep side by side.
"Sounds like his appendix," John decides without looking up. He's knotting the sixth stitch. "Have you done an ultrasound?"
“No, I’ve already told you, he was an idiot. He still hadn’t entirely given up on being a pirate. Anyway, he worked in the labs for a couple of years and then he met another chemist on whom who he developed a very bad crush, and it was like the Victor situation except worse, because the Chemist was married and led the Prince on in a very unacceptable way.”
"You know, the therapy cat at my nana's nursing home died a couple of weeks ago. The nurses there are looking for new cat."
The things that I thought would be most difficult were actually the most simple, and the things that popular culture would suggest are the easiest actually required some effort.
"I'm really not in the mood to hear your opinions of my team. Thing is, I'm drawing a blank on this and I'm worried this toe rag isn't going to stop."
Our progress has been unusual, partly because neither of us could be certain exactly what we were progressing, and partly because any kind of relationship , until Albion showed up, struck me with blind terror.
“What if  you might be prevented from seeing Rosie, or if you missed her so badly, you’d rather stay in a loveless marriage than be separated from her? How might your new partner react?”
I sat on my couch for a long time, thinking. When I woke up the light had gone and there were shadows all around the room.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Although that is, in fact, a great idea. But no. I mean, they make investments in attending the wedding. They get their hair done, they buy new clothes, they take time off work and they forget to have breakfast while they’re picking up their suit from the cleaners. They expect a wedding to provide them with entertainment and lots of food and drink. They get very aggressive if their investment isn’t returned.”
“Your qualifications are irrelevant. If I had given you an order, you would have been obliged to follow it. And I’m a medical doctor. I would have been on par with you, professionally.”
He looks around the strange room with the cheap furniture. Another person, also who's name John doesn't know, asks if he's okay. Yes, he assures them, I'm fine.
My brother was immobile as the details were relayed, only lifting his eyebrows as John described the final moments. Mycroft was impressed by John’s bravery, and that’s saying something. He is utterly unmoved by just about everything.
“Honestly, you think they’d never seen a hand print before. Who would die such a way without handprints, unless it was self inflicted? I don’t know what they’re thinking. Actually I do, but I don’t understand it.  Now would you like me to get you some balloons?”
John is patient, takes the stranger by the good elbow and shepherds him into the cab. "We're going to St Bart's, thanks," he tells the driver.
Small noises echoed through out the large warehouse. Rats thrive in places like this and quite often generations of rat relatives (and their nests) can be observed in corners, along the skirting boards and probably in the containers themselves. I assumed John was navigating a path through the rodents, looking for the light switches.
And when Sherlock looked as if he was inventing something, John added, “The truth, Sherlock. Tell me who did that and why.”
John talks over Rosie’s head. “Don’t know.  She says hears a child singing and then has a dream about a child calling her because it’s lost it’s shoe. Not much to go on.”
The first thing I wanted to do was call John Watson, who would have understood instantly the gravity of this breakthrough.
John feels for the boy. He has had boys not much older in his command. He has been one. He knows how hard it is. John speaks with a pleasant smile as Sherlock rolls his eyes.
Corinne welcomes the party into her little flat. It is clean, scrupulously clean, and neat. Sherlock immediately smells cleaning agents and air freshener and soap. John can see only one closed door – probably the bedroom, which leads to a bathroom.
John no longer has to rebuke him when he suspects his questions aren’t being answered properly. He has perfected the warning gaze and Sherlock responds briskly.
He had dark hair, my ears and my mouth, perfect sample–size reproductions of them. His fingers were long and his toes were red. He was as soft and silky as clotted cream when you dunk your hands into a vat of it, which I have done on three separate occasions.
He was parenting my little boy. It made my insides feel soft and unsound. It was sentiment and it was beautiful.
Sherlock is staring hard at a mirror, watching the tailor adjust the length of his trousers. “I just can’t believe you’ve managed to keep something hidden from me. You’re a good deal more Machiavellian than I suspected, John Watson. ”
"You'll be very happy here but Sherlock will drive you mad. When he does, you just pop down and see me. The kettle's always on! "
So he followed me to my room, lay down with me and kissed me. There was no hesitation. It was wonderful, more satisfying and much more meaningful than I expected. I hadn’t realised how much you can say to a person when you kiss them, probably because I’d never been in love with a person like I am with John Watson.
effort to deter people up to no good, the owner has installed a makeshift lighting system that illuminated the entire factory frontage and the rear exit. This allows some light through the building and mostly assists people up to no good to carry on illicit activity without too much strain on their eyesight.
“I worked at Superdrug for a bit in Lewisham. Had a job in a carwash for a bit, and worked at a factory where we packed biscuits. Then I was unemployed for a long time.”
It was worth suggesting just to see the look on his face.  He smiled so widely I could see his back molars.
“And I don’t want to look like the callous, lazy parent who’s rescinded all care of his child because there’s a willing participant to assist in his care.”
John tips the egg timer and watches the sand start its little journey. “Any that you think might fit this case?”
They were on the table somewhere. “Take them. Actually, take them, make me a couple of copies and bring them back.”
The movie cuts clumsily to another scene, with Eurus in her cot, still only days old, eyes wide open as Sherlock reads her a book. Mycroft leans over the other side.
On the reverse side, a typed description has been taped: BEECHERS ROAD 17 MARCH 1975 SHOE BELONGING TO MARIAH BEST. NOT TO BE RELEASED
The older lady is gracious. I would love a cup of tea and I know my husband would too. Both with milk and sugar, please."
John stares back, reaching into his other pocket and pulling out his Army warrant. "Let me save you any further trouble. “That's all the id I've got, unless you want my money too. Now sit still while I give you a bit more anaesthetic."
But it’s always been like that for us. Five years ago, he moved in with me after one brief meeting. We had known each other for twenty four hours when he killed a man he believed threatened my safety. We were fast friends almost from the moment we met.
Sherlock places his cup on the coffee table and swings forward, grabs his coat and pushes past John as he storms out the door.
It is agreed that they must track down Julia. No one suspected her, and it seems unlikely that that she would have been involved, but they all hope that she might have the one elusive clue needed to close this case.
"So what are you saying? Do you want to go back to therapy and tell her that now too much happens to you?"
Then the door bell rang again and once more Mrs Hudson answered. They were male voices this time and I thought immediately that the back-up social services people were here to take my baby boy away.
Sherlock dusts his Prada trousers with careful hands. "Executions," he says crisply. "Simple, effective executions."
John is horrified. "No! No, I'd never kill an animal. No, they didn't want her. The people I live with. She was as depressed as I was. I didn't want to be unhappy after I was, you know, gone, so..." -his face takes on a sheepish scowl- "I gave her to an old persons' home as a therapy pet."
“You jumped off the fucking roof! I watched you jump off the roof! Then you pretended to be dead and I took your pulse and you were dead!” He leans heavily on the table and tries to restore some temperance to his grief. “I was at your funeral, Sherlock. I sat a few feet from your coffin. Do you know what that’s like, to see the coffin of someone...”
“Who are you?” she says sharply, suddenly. Her eyes are cloudy and bitter, her voice delivered in between tortuous breaths from behind the oxygen mask.
I am wholly aware that a small angry person yelling for hours about nothing in particular is stressful for anyone, and it may have been for me if I were someone who needed eight hours sleep. I am in the happy position that I can survive very heartily on two, and have been known to go for up to three days without any at all.
Having the two most impossible-to-please people in the British Isles make those declarations was very overwhelming. I was glad that my carnivorous brother appeared with the teapot.
A few years ago John and I would have exorcised our perplexity or rage with aggression; tonight we proved it could be alchemised into astonishing pleasure.
“Well”, says Molly. “That fits with the injury. If the chi – if Mariah fell against a brick wall, this is precisely the kind of injury she’d get.”
Greg is not convinced. “I need to get back to the office. Let me try and contact one of the old coppers again and I’ll see if I can’t get any thing to back up your claims.”
“Oh for Christ’s sake.” I would have complained more but John was now clean-shaven and it was distracting. I stared a little too long.
He wants to tell him more, something that mirrors the vast impact the poems have on him, but his feelings have no shape or order yet so he declares his intention to get dressed quickly, lest he is late for work.
My doctor, he repeats to himself with a small smile as he touches the soft dressing on his face. Physician. Surgeon. Healer. Medico. Shaman. Soldier. Possible conductor of light. John is lots of things.
"Ah yes. Molly, this is Doctor John Watson, John, this is Molly, who as far as I'm concerned runs St Barts."
“Sherlock,” she asked one evening when she bought up some scones, “Your toes are lovely. You’ll have to give me the name of your beautician.”
The meeting is so dull that John falls asleep after seven minutes, before they've even got to the National Monthly Sale Figures. Other managers, aware of his troubled medical history, figure that narcolepsy is one of his symptoms and they continue the meeting in whispers. John wakes up as the meeting is finishing when the person who was sitting next to him, whose name John also doesn't know, accidentally knocks him with her chair as she leaves.
