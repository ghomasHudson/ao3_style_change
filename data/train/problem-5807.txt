“Remember the friends I told you about?” Steve asked Peggy and watched her recollect the ones he had mentioned, “Well, turns out ‘dead’ isn’t an accurate verdict for all of them.”
In all these years, there had been just two secrets Steve had kept from Tony. Both of them weren’t going to be fruitful, he had decided, and kept one of them locked in his heart while the other had been more physical. When he had left 2023, Steve had carried his compass to convince the Steve of 2012 but that hadn’t been the only item he had brought along.
Steve had never been too good at ignoring Tony though. That had been the last thing Rhodey would notice in the aftermath.
Maria hadn't seen the disaster happening this time but she knew that she wasn't willing to see the fallout of it just yet. That had been the only thing on her mind when she had taken charge as Steve had stayed back for once.
“We still have options, Steve,” the cup tilted as it came to rest on the jute coaster, tea skimming the edges of ceramic before settling in and Steve could sense
“It’s an earthquake under the ocean, Nat,” Okoye said as Steve came closer, standing at the entrance, “We handle it by not handling it.”
Steve had lived enough, two different lifetimes, to know that he was ignoring how it was always possible. They made monsters out of men to hide the demons that come with humanity, there were always ‘not all’ and ‘unnatural’ guarding judgements. So they looked to the skies, to their neighbours and the aliens, to anybody who wasn’t them, wasn’t their own faults in the line.
“I got it!” Peter called out as Steve ducked another punch, knowing that the kid had taken the gauntlet from T’Challa, “Okay, this is bad – uh, a little help?!”
“A girl,” Pepper replied, grounding and unfazed, like this wasn’t something that she had excluded as a reaction. Maybe Steve really was spiraling if people he hadn’t spoken to in months could anticipate it.
"Not really?" Steve hedged his answer but then shrugged and skipped his glance over Tony, "I saw Peggy. Didn't really meet her but - saw her."
Natasha had stood beside her mother, too young to be asked to be anybody’s legacy and too famous to be exempted from it, and Tony stuck close to them through it all. Steve handled SHIELD, Peggy facing new threat for her position now that her strongest supporter was gone. They were both needed and they both came home with newer burdens every night.
Which brought him to the day two weeks later, when they were eating dinner and he pushed the bottle of water towards Tony to get a more serious look than the action warranted.
The fridge had poor choice in ingredients but there were a couple of carrots and peas. A little more digging brought out more vegetables, enough to make some soup. He looked to find some bread that would go with it and got down to making dinner.
"If you're done gawking," Stephen stretched his palms outwards, this time to work out the kinks in his finger joints, "could you send me the new readings for – yes, thank you."
"I think I can't stop lying," he said, a buried fear wriggling out of his throat as he stared at the other side of the bed, empty and cold in a familiarity deep within him, "I keep getting better at it and everyone seems to believe me. Sometimes I believe myself too. It's getting difficult to not, nowadays."
It was a momentary journey before he found himself facing a fortress, jet floating in the darkness. The design resembled a helmet, dark purple and teal, blinking lights of neon blue at the apex.
“I -,” he waved a hand around vaguely before exhaling, “I’ve just had a really long week. And some Vantablack guy called today to invite me to a pretentious art event that –“
“Alright, now we just need to get you a disguise and find some place to stash the shield,” Steve saw Tony walk forward and looked in the direction of the way their earlier guest had gone.
Steve’s foot stepped on something as he walked and he looked down, lifting his shoe to see a silver band. He bent down to pick it up and recognized it to be a size smaller than Tony’s, a solitaire sitting elegantly with an engraved wing on either side. It had dirt from his boot and he wiped it, running a thumb over the band one last time before folding it in his palm.
They gathered with a solemn sense of trepidation in the lab, and Steve’s eyes took in the new gauntlet they had created. It was based off Tony’s suit and it looked stronger, more purposeful than a bejeweled glove. It was the result of too many risks and all they had to do was snap.
It took Nat two more days to realize that Steve really wouldn’t go with the plan and Steve was reading in his room, Jhumpa Lahiri telling him how Gogol hated his name and how it didn’t make sense with his identity. Steve could picture the Bengali boy in his kindergarten, innocently telling his teacher that he wished to be called by his nickname, only to later run from the name with his whole being. Nikhil, he would call himself, just like his parents had once decided but somewhere Steve suspected that he would still be Gogol. Names had a funny way of becoming a person, he’d say.
"You think he's okay?" he heard from behind, a low murmur pitched for his ears only and felt the heat of Steve standing close. His fingers flew over the keys but his shoulders lowered an inch at the brush of gloved knuckles over them as his husband held the back of the chair with one hand.
It was sheer luck that he didn't encounter any additional issues on his way from there on, and Steve kept a low profile in his delivery uniform. It was fairly easy to find an unoccupied room with a phone and Steve rummaged through the phone directory taped to the wall to find the extension of Hank Pym's lab. If he played it vague and used broken information from what Tony had remembered of Project GOLIATH, it wouldn't take long to get Dr. Pym out of his lab and running for the basement.
He worked in silence to set up his tent, the gear from a disinterested store unfurling from his bag. There weren’t many who had escaped from a half-bitten world into the chasm of his chosen abandon and Steve had only the sounds of his own feet to keep him company. When the sun showed hints of dimming, he set down to work on a bonfire. It felt like old routine, falling back on things he hadn’t done since his entry into the 21
“It’s a long story, but you’re not wrong,” Tony ran a hand through his hair and eyed his surroundings, “That really was me and my body. Can we talk somewhere else? I’m pretty sure this isn’t the most covert place in the area and I’d like to not be starving if we’re going to be shot at anytime soon. Do you have any cash?”
There was no way he should have had all those letters and Steve could see the smugness radiating from his partner of twenty years even as his eyes read the question again.
Steve took in the sight in front of him and felt his lips quirk at the way Natasha had curled into half a ball on the table, dangerously close to pushing the other occupant off the edge in her fatigue fuelled sleep. Tony, surprisingly oblivious to Natasha's knees digging into his back, dozed on.
but there had always been a hope to be more. Sex was invigorating and interesting, love was challenging and creative, and then there was this.
Maybe he had always walked towards this understanding. Maybe all those moments in the past when the world was different from Tony, where things were always more – more intense, more personal, more victorious – maybe there had always been more of Steve devoted towards loving Tony than he had expected.
His hand was rubbing small strokes over Tony's arm and he felt the warmth seep through, a contact much different to the heat of a ripped out reactor pulsing in his palm. That was the last time Steve's truth had seen the light.
"So you stole a god's breakfast? For me?" Tony batted Steve's hand away when he dragged his hair down his forehead, "That's so much better. Almost worth waking up for."
Steve swallows and just nods, unsure of what to say. He had been expecting for Tony to get angry, throw something, hit him even. But complete understanding and acceptance…he wasn’t prepared for that. He didn’t know how to handle the emotions that came with it.
Tony steps forward, his hands reaching for Steve. One hand goes to Steve’s hip, the other to his neck. Tony looks at him for a minute, and then he brings their mouths together. Steve is hesitant, but eventually he opens up to the kiss. It’s slow and gentle, chaste.
Tony steps in behind him and closes the door, locking it for good measure. Steve watches carefully as Tony’s eyes scan around the living room.
For some reason, Steve finds it hard to look away. He smiles when he gets caught staring, but still doesn’t avert his eyes. He thinks that maybe, just maybe, he could be happy like this. He could put his other life behind him and start over and just let Tony take care of him, protect him,
So for the time being, they’ve just been enjoying each other’s company in Tony’s penthouse, or Tony’s lab, or just anywhere in the entire building that they make it to before sex becomes a part of the game plan. And sex is almost always part of the game plan.
When he comes to, Steve is aware of an annoying pain in his arm. His eyes flutter open, but it’s too bright so he shuts them again. From his quick glimpse, he can tell that he’s in a hospital bed, but he doesn’t remember how he got there, or why his body is suddenly aching so much.
His phone dings and he glances down at the message, not surprised to see a response from Tony: “I’m at an event, but I’ll be home around eight.”
“I want you to move in with me. I want to wake up with you. I want to watch you make art and I want you to be happy.”
Tony leads him over to the table and offers the detective a seat across from them. The detective pulls out a small notebook and a pen, flipping through it for a moment until he comes to a page that already has notes scribbled on it.
The fear only returns when Tony pulls into his garage and Steve thinks he sees a shadow around the corner, or around every corner. Tony must notice that he’s acting strange because he takes his hand, kisses it, and leads him inside his highly secure tower.
“Yeah,” he says back. “Just…a stomach ache today.” He staggers back to his feet and then raises his eyes to meet Tony’s. He can see the concern etched across Tony’s face, but he can’t do anything but shrug and dip the brush back into the varnish. He wants to finish. He wants this to be over. He wants to go home.
He thinks that maybe their conversation is over, so he puts his phone back on the shelf and starts to get his hair wet so he can shampoo it, but yet another message dings onto his phone.
Steve stops dead in his tracks and Tony doesn’t seem to notice, because he continues approaching the art with Steve’s name on it. Steve steps backwards a step, planning to turn and run as fast as he can. By the time he’s gotten a second step backwards, Tony has realized he’s not by his side anymore and turns to look.
“Mr. Rogers, I’m here to talk about Paul Swanson. We’ve been made aware that you think he is responsible for your car accident. Is that correct?”
Tony finally opens the pizza box, helping himself to a slice and gesturing for Steve to do the same. They sit in silence for a bit, just chewing, and Steve pretending to watch Godzilla. It probably goes on for a full five minutes before Tony uncrosses his legs and turns slightly towards Steve.
On Wednesday morning, Steve manages to get himself up. He limps his way to the bathroom, ignoring his reflection. He takes a cold shower to wake up and then walks around naked for a while until he can stand to put his clothes on. He’s still pretty sore, but his body is already healing. The bruise on his stomach has turned to a dark yellow. He’ll be fine, he decides.
When Tony comes back, Steve tries to wipe the look of worry off his face. It doesn’t go unnoticed, though, and Tony slides his hand back in with Steve’s.
Tony shifts a bit so he can pull his own shirt over his head, working his hands on Steve’s jeans while trying to slide out of his own pants at the same time. It doesn’t seem to be working because Tony huffs in frustration.
Tony wipes his eyes as if trying to get dust out of them, but he finally nods. “I was worried sick about you,” he confesses. “You wouldn’t wake up for a long time.”
“I can picture you here,” Tony says finally. “Making dinner over there. Painting over there. Watching TV right here.”
But after two weeks, Steve knew it was time to take a break. Too much of a good thing was a bad thing, sort of deal. He was afraid to go home alone, but he also wanted Tony to have a break from him. Just in case Tony was getting tired of him constantly being there. Just in case Tony needed his space.
He stops along the way to gas up so he’ll have enough juice to get back and then to Stark Tower later, but it’s probably just an excuse to delay the inevitable. He’s been having such a good week that he doesn’t want to ruin it with a painful day with Paul. He’s not even sure how his body is going to feel afterwards; will he even be able to finish sculpting tonight?
He wakes up a few times through the night. The first time, just to Tony murmuring lighting to someone on the phone about “tracing a call,” and the second time to Tony having a quiet, but heated, conversation with someone in the living room. Steve wants to get out of bed and find out what’s going on, but he’s too tired and he falls asleep again before he can.
Tony follows his gaze, but he doesn’t instantly see the threat. He just sees a guy in a suit, who happens to be staring daggers back at Steve.
Steve stares, dumfounded, before nodding slowly. He doesn’t follow, though. Just watches until Tony disappears into the bar.
“I made sandwiches,” Tony says after a while. “Figured you could eat some lunch. Probably didn’t eat dinner yesterday.”
When the children start arriving for the gallery preview, Steve goes to change into his suit. It felt awkward changing in the bathroom, but there was ultimately no other choice. He adjusted his bowtie in the mirror and gave himself another quick once-over before hurrying out and dropping his regular clothes back into the car. When he returned, he was greeted like a guest who belonged.
Tony’s cheeks are a little flushed, but he moves until he’s able to slide underneath Steve. He sits back and watches as Steve starts down his chest, kissing lightly over small trail of hair that leads from his belly button. Tony gasps when Steve finally makes it to his cock, cursing when he feels Steve’s hot breath against it, and clenches his fists when his tip finally makes it past Steve’s lips.
The weather is nice, so this is the perfect place to draw Tony. There’s a small two-seater table in the middle of the garden, as if Tony were expecting Steve to need exactly this space to draw in.
Steve stands back a bit as the crowd swamps Tony, asking him questions and asking him what art he’s there to see. Steve is a bit relieved when Tony doesn’t mention their relationship, or that he’s there to support his boyfriend, or any number of things that might pertain to Steve at all. Instead, Tony just says he’s there to support local artists.
It’s a week later and Steve wakes up again alone. It’s almost noon, but the first thing he realizes is that Tony isn’t wrapped around him anymore. It’s not that surprising, though, seeing how late in the morning it is.
“I messaged that difficult client, you know the one, Paul. I told him I couldn’t keep our arrangement anymore, and he flipped out, and I’ve gotten all these really threatening messages from him. I don’t know what to do about it.”
“Why?” Tony questions, and he shifts so that he is facing Steve, their chests pressed together. He reaches down slowly and rubs Steve’s thigh. “I could make you feel good, Steve. If you want me to.”
Steve follows Ryan into the bedroom, watching as the other man takes off his shirt and tosses it aside. Steve slips out of his shoes, leaving his socks on as he goes, and leans into Ryan’s embrace when they reach the edge of the bed. He kisses Ryan’s neck, lets him start to unbutton his jeans, feels it when Ryan sticks his hand down the front of his pants.
"Let's go home?" Tony asked, holding out his fist with the time GPS strapped over his knuckles. It was not what could have been but Steve knew all about second chances and everyone had their own limit just as they had right to them. Tony had his second chance waiting for him in a time far away from now. Steve? Well, the one he was being offered wasn't so bad either.
Rhodey browsed through a new design manual from the nearest screen and Tony let it be as he worked through his code.
“Which baby?” Steve asked, not knowing if he was actually having the conversation of if they were having two separate conversations. It felt like eons since he had heard from Tony or someone who met him regularly, his own foolishly sent messages hitting a blank void always.
"Because this is his Uranibourg," Tony turned the chair around to face Steve, looking between him and an increasingly tired-looking Potts, "He's Picard in the situation and he's here to witness his Polaris moment. Except, you know, this time it'll cost a population to have his observation."
“Hello? Is anybody home? Remember me? It’s Scott Lang! Ant Man? We met a few years ago? I know you remember me, look can you open –“
“You like my burgers that much?” Steve asked, the first thought that came to mind and the brunet blinked before chuckling, one hand still holding the stolen piece.
“Don’t ask, won’t tell,” Steve said dryly and the other man made a face before looking up at the building, “You ready?”
Scott stared back at them in his normal form and Steve heard Bruce declare time travel a success, shooting him a dry stare before leaving the room. He needed a minute.
"I'm here," Steve smiled and Tony let himself lean forward, just enough that Steve could try again, could get a second first kiss. Steve lingered for minutes, the way he always did with things that mattered, and Tony could fit a smile curved to their measurements as they brushed apart finally.
late,” Steve corrected with a grin of adrenaline as he spotted the ramp of the jet and aimed for it, “Start the engines, will you? I’m bringing company.”
“Did I?” Tony blinked innocently, face breaking into a hint of a smile, “Doesn’t matter, I’m here now.”
They had fought Thanos once, all three of them, but they had done it alone. Individuals against a murderer. A reactor blast hit Thanos’ face as the shield flew back to Steve and Mjölnir kept up the tempo. They were together now, a team of their own, and they would have to do whatever it took to keep Thanos from repeating history.
He was led through a maze of corridors with panels embedded with security footage that changed screen with every alternate blink. The bots didn't communicate with him, flanking him on three sides as he walked, and Steve took in the route they were following. It seemed odd that he was being allowed to walk without restraints but something about that fact also warned him of factors he hadn't seen yet, Kang's confidence in his plan.
Well, a chosen reality he supposed. Just as real as the fact that they were here, working together again.
“You have a goal?” Steve asked and stared at the notepad that Tony offered him, hand closing around it with a strange fluttering in his pulse. He flipped it open and there was a single page of writing, five bullet points under a title.
And then she had felt it worse for the man who had calmly powered his way into the room without an ounce of emotion showing on his face.
Potts, Steve gathered, was close to his nineties by an easy bet but his face was calm. He had a bruise blooming on his cheek and a split lip, and neither stopped him from talking to Tony in a normal tone.
“Because it’s pointless,” the words curled around Steve’s teeth sharply and he leaned further into the leather of his seat, “We’ve done this before and then we
“Okay,” Steve told himself and then once more to the curious eyes staring up at him in his arms, “Okay?”
Tony looked away from Steve to see Potts go through an entire spectrum of emotions before a mirthful grin began taking over his face.
“Let me do it,” Thor begged, trying to reach it over both Steve and Tony, who had come up to stop him in sync, “Please. Let me do one good thing.”
"What're you talking about?" Potts frowned and Tony saw the man's eyes go to his hands, frown deepening at the lack of rings, "Who died? Did someone –"
"You got anything else?" he asked but Tony shook his head even as he rummaged the bag he had taken from some poor soul's car on their way to this hiding spot. They had been lucky that the place was bustling with visitors, mostly scientists or experts from institutions that SHIELD kept ties with for its thinktank.
They didn’t talk about it, the stretching tension of conflicted wires that roamed loose in the air with just two people trying to fill endless untouched empty rooms. Steve heard Natasha field calls from councils, volunteering the service of Avengers for incidents that weren’t happening anymore. Natasha scraped her spoon louder against the bowl of stew with every night Steve made it, eyes finding his face with a concerned expression that was bleeding into annoyance steadily even if Steve didn’t look up.
“If you say no, I’m firing these at you, Potts!” Janet quipped, flying in between the beams from the bot chasing her, “You won’t look nice with a partially shaved head, I’m telling you.”
On a whim, Steve took a picture of the Canyon’s heights from his view and sent it to Nat. He didn’t check to see if there was a reply and pulled out a can of soup to heat over the fire, hearing it crackle as he waited. It wasn’t much of a meal but it was enough and Steve settled down, lying down on the unforgiving bed of rocks as he stared up at the unending sky. It was strange, to feel the distance separating them and knowing yourself to be as small as a speck to the universe, but Steve had seen it. The sight of a universe beyond Earth, speed doing nothing to blur the knowledge of entering an idea only vivid in dreams so far – Steve had experienced that on Benatar.
"Being on a date with a recovering alcoholic removes that possibility," Tony said with a wry smile getting a nod from Rhodes.
"What are you doing to them?" Steve asked as he looked back at the screen where Tony was staring up at the Chitauri in a darkened bunker, frozen as he took in the destruction around him. Potts looked shaken too but he quickly looked away from –
“Doctor Potts,” Edwin Jarvis greeted politely before turning to address Steve, taking a moment before smoothing over his pause, “You must be Captain Stevens? Welcome, gentlemen. I am Edwin Jarvis, and Mr. Stark will be here soon. If you could please take a seat, make yourselves comfortable, I’ll send for some refreshments.”
“Is there a reason you called me, Pepper?” he asked instead of replying and leaned across the table to pick up his charger, “I’m busy.”
do it again. Steve bit his lip as he carefully pulled himself free from Tony's hold and climbed off the bed, feet stable even as his head hurt with the unlocked secrets. He shot Tony one last look, one more memory of a false truth, before turning away to leave.
"And we still didn't figure out that they were assholes right then," Tony chuckled and Steve miraculously didn't suck in a surprised breath when their fingers brushed as they walked, "Yeah, it's next month here. Supposed to be. He - we were talking about it back there."
“You think it’ll be enough?” Steve asked as he shook hands with Bernie, eyes slipping to the car and back. They had left the city behind but Flint still lingered in his mind, just as every city he seemed to touch.
and having a team didn't exempt anyone from feeling the bumps in that turn. And it hit Steve, the legend built upon propaganda and glory of a flagged uniform, much harder than most. Healing was familiar, reforming even more, but this was new and Tony's regrown heart thumped harder at the awareness.
The basement garage was colder than the rest of the house and Steve immediately heard Rhodey’s voice when he walked in.
“No,” Tasha started to shake her head before stilling, freezing awkwardly as she remembered that her hairdresser wasn’t done yet, “Not blueberries.”
This time Steve took a step forward and Tony found that being held by his husband didn't change with time.
Thanos was pushed off Thor and Mjölnir came flying back to Steve, fitting back in his hand as he stood at ready.
“Wasn’t my cooking, but you’re welcome,” she laughed and caught Morgan in one arm when the girl curled up to her, “I’m more in charge of the produce around here.”
He brought a closed fist up and rested his chin on it, content in the simplicity of then, and watched the orange fin of a dish's border disappear under the dirty water.
Tony gave a short wave to Howard and finally turned towards Steve, walking without looking back at his father.
There was a web of cracks on the mirror and a warm trickle down his knuckles when Steve came back to himself. Blue eyes stared back at a clenched jaw, deep cut cheekbones too pale, and his fingers came up in a trance to wipe at the mirror. There were tears on his reflection and now there was blood, fingerprints smudged down the fissures.
“If we play the age card, you will lose so badly, it won’t even be funny,” Tony said lightly and finally took pity to stand up, leaning over to help Steve sit up and fluff the pillows behind him.
Tony stayed silent and Steve pulled himself up on his elbows, dragging the sheets off him as he eyed Tony, cataloguing anything physically wrong.
Any minute now, Vision would phase into his bedroom and ask if Steve needed either Wanda or him for the rest of the day. It was either the library or the deli that Steve had always made plans to go to. Wanda would inevitably steal something from Nat’s wardrobe and there would be an argument later about the technicalities of borrowing.
Nat’s message opened and it was a photo too. Steve stared at it for a second before he felt the first tendril of warmth crawl in, lips curling as he zoomed in.
Steve held him in a loose hold as Tony buried his tears in the cotton of Steve’s shoulder, hands clenching fistfuls of his shirt.
It was strange how it hadn't taken long for Tony to switch back to being Iron Man from being the temporary Director of SHIELD but Steve couldn't go back to being Captain America yet. He still had the shield in his apartment, always by the foot of the bed even at night, and the uniform hung clean in the closet. He was Captain America in every way, even in the eyes of those who had sought to suspend him, but he hadn't picked up the shield since his last fight with Tony.
"Don't have much of a choice I'd say," Tony cleared his throat lightly before subtly relaxing his shoulders as the doors opened to let them in. There was a single occupant in the enclosure and both of them tried to avoid eye contact with her as they stood waiting for their respective floors to come.
"He was mine," she spoke over him, quiet truth in a heavy echo of the past, "He never made me feel otherwise. But you were his too. I never saw that proved otherwise either. And I'm never going to stop being glad that he had that. That he had more love meant for him than he thought he did. It's what he deserves."
Tony stood silent beside him and Steve washed his face, wiping down the tears every time they welled.
The small streaks of grey at her roots, the deep red of her mildly smudged lipstick, a chalk stain along her left sleeve, chipped nail polish of the index finger; there were so many details to absorb in every passing frame of the moment and even those seemed too less as Steve stood frozen to the spot in a dark room across a busy Peggy. A life too vastly spinning on her heels, she was held attentive by whatever file she read in haste and before Steve could form or bite back a thought it was over. Just as she had entered, she was gone, and with her the reminder of a past where Steve had been more inclined to be seen. Not Captain America, but Steve.
“I knew it!” Thor laughed with the first spark of true joy since he had come back, “I knew you were worthy!”
“He’s with Bruce and Clint in the lab,” Tony said, not really answering Steve’s question, “We finished the Gauntlet.”
There was the time when Steve wanted to welcome their tenth New Year with the resolution of going greener and had pledged to use a bicycle (that he still called bike and Peggy judged him for). Tony had been sceptical of the choice but had let Steve go with it, content with it as long as Steve didn’t drag him into it.
“Giant wet noodle?” Steve asked dryly and she nodded, pointing her fork at him, “Did Natasha set you up to this? Is this some intervention to a non-issue?”
"That's not a good definition of a heist," Steve replied even as he bit back a grin at Tony's raised eyebrow, "There's got to be another way."
On Natasha’s second birthday, she asked for a picnic and Tony was an absolute sucker for the idea. Howard was ready to come along but couldn’t make it on the day and that was where the mood began going downhill.
It had been the return of Thor on the second day that had really gotten the ball rolling though and in some way that had been the biggest irony. The others seemed to give Thor a wide berth, clearly skeptical of where to even begin handling the state he was in, and it was like their first meeting all over again when both Steve and Tony caught on in sync.
Steve opened his mouth to retort before the second part of the remark registered and his mouth shut with a click.
“Steve, buddy, you’re not making any sense,” Tony frowned, a suspicious look on his face and Steve shot him a innocent grin.
“Marry me,” Steve blurted and saw Tony’s brows rise, “I had it all planned and I was going to do this right but nothing went as planned so, I’m just asking. Do you?”
“Ross called for your head,” Pepper answered him before Steve could finish the question and the air felt punched out of his lungs but she shot him an understanding glance, “Yours and Natasha’s, really, but he was very insistent on yours.”
“That seems to be a theme,” Tony ran a hand over his face but didn’t disagree, jamming the cushion behind his neck. They couldn’t sleep that night but stayed together on the couch, reading through files of cases long closed in a world they were both alienated from now.
“She still hates that nickname,” Steve smiled slightly and Howard nodded with a surprised huff, “Congratulations on your kid, Howard. I know this is a lot to take in but I’m glad we got to tell you.”
"Kang," Rhodey's eyes widened before his shoulders relaxed and he looked behind to nod at someone for a second, "We thought – okay, I'll detect your coordinates, unlock the tracker."
There was a chilling storm in jade eyes for a flash before Natasha blinked, expression tightening even as she mirrored Steve’s posture.
“This really would be a lot easier if we just took out past Thanos,” Rhodey declared after the discussion of Morag, catching the sauce packet Clint threw from the other side of the table, “One shot and boom, we’re done.”
Tony looked up from Natasha and his smile turned dimmed into something less than cheer for the sake of cheer. It shortened into something more Tony, a contrasting shade between home and an ever-present inner war.
“A while,” Tony replied, flanking Steve on the right as Thor came up on the left, “But he’s just been sitting though.”
“Would you keep that quiet?” he said and his fingers skimmed just above the edge of the shield, “I didn’t bring gifts for the rest of the team.”
“We still have two hours before starting?” Steve asked and Tony shrugged a shoulder, “Okay, let’s get some coffee.”
“Hey now,” he protested without heat and raised a hand in surrender when Sam jumped out of his side, shutting the door even as he ran across the gravel, “I’m not so bad.”
“Is there ever a good way to apologize to your ex-girlfriend when you don’t even know where she last was?” he ran a hand over his face and the twelfth attempt left a bitter aftertaste in his mouth, “All I know is that Sharon was among those who were – everyone’s using Snapped as a word, it drives me crazy but yes. I don’t think I can go to her apartment yet.”
"The idea of me was," he replied and quietly kept watch of those who would spare Tony a second glance as they passed. It was the beard, he knew, but it never hurt to be a bit extra careful at times.
Their schedules wrapped around them and now they had some new rearrangements of dates, lunches at places where they could talk more than just work and the past, stargazing that meant hands held with purpose. Shopping for clothes had a few additional questions of
And Tony. Right beside him, eyes sharp and suited up, filling in the gaps whenever Steve’s plans needed the check.
"Could be better," Tony said and let himself smile, just a little, just enough to allow Steve to see the man behind the mask.
"I could just tell her that I borrowed it," Steve dutifully raised the blue cover to let Tony elbow his way up and stilled when the man ignored the spot nearby. The warmth of his fumblingly tired partner settled atop him, head burrowed under Steve's chin to conveniently listen to his heartbeat, and Steve's arms were frozen at his sides. There was no scent of cologne or hair product, a crease mark along Tony's cheek from where he must have briefly rested on his table's edge, one hand now resting on Steve's stomach while the other pillowed Tony's chin - it couldn't be any more comfortable than it would be to sleep on a lumpy couch.
“Our baby,” she answered and Steve wasn’t sure if he was washing the carrot or scrubbing its skin clean. The water ran over orange, washing down the drain uncaring what it carried away.
He turned around as a dozen more portals opened and heroes walked through, ready and suited. Avengers, Wakandans, Inhumans, aliens Carol had told them were called Skrulls – they marched out in hordes and Steve wasn’t the last man standing anymore.
"Hi," she eyed Steve before taking in Tony's appearance, a tension leaking out of her face as she smiled lightly, "Nice vacation?"
Steve grunted and pulled himself forward, inch by inch as the horde bogged him down, anything to get to Thanos. To stop him from curling his fist.
He exhaled and read the question again before looking up at the closed door. He had known, even without being in touch with Nat or Rhodey, he had known that Clint would not have come back here. Things didn’t just happen just because he wanted them to and he had always been just a little late in getting to people who were broken the worst way.
They ended up waiting at Peggy’s house and Tony kept shooting Steve increasingly changing looks of emotions as time passed. They didn’t talk for a while but then Tony finally moved to come sit beside Steve on the steps, starting a conversation about his own funeral. He approved of the decision to include Natasha’s memorial and made a face at Ross being present at the lakehouse. When Steve told him about Happy, he noted the sadly fond flash pass across Tony’s eyes.
"Is this you giving a pep-talk, because you kind of -," Tony passed him the last ring of metal they had, "- suck at it."
Steve saw his face, left side marred by blood streaks but the right was faded, charred into a grayscale version of someone he couldn’t place with Tony’s image. A version that had only existed in Steve’s nightmares and even then there was red pooling down Tony’s heart, always a shield down the middle.
Steve knew that Tony didn't want one. There wasn't much to warn him, not in this situation, and especially not with Potts being happily married. It was an oddity in some cosmic decision, the freedom given to one of his parallels; to be confident of where he was despite a building capriciousness, of how much he could ask without measuring what he could give. It wasn't always this way, the shocks that kept spasming in waves of an aftermath. There had been times when he had been able to absorb a jolt and stabilize himself, one foot braced back but the other sure upfront.
“Steve, hate to break it you but being a little selfish isn’t always wrong,” she pointed out and gestured towards his bike, “It might even help keep you sane after some points of time. It’s what is keeping me sane, I’ll tell you that.”
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s humming as he works, or that the smile on his face hasn’t faded, or that he’s happy. It’s a feeling that he’s become so familiar with that he can’t even remember the last time he was
He can hear monitors to his left making noises, and his hand is trapped in something warm. It takes a him a moment to realize that it’s someone else’s hand against his own, and that he’s not trapped. It actually feels nice.
At some point, his hands start to hurt and he puts down the carving tool he’s been using to stretch his hands a bit. He takes a step back to look at his work, deciding that this is a good stopping point. If he doesn’t stop now, he’s going to start up the chest area and he won’t be able to finish that in a couple hours. There is too much detail that needs to be planned out. An all-day task for tomorrow.
Inside the room, Steve stares at his phone for several moments, trying not to read the messages too quickly. He doesn’t want to mistakenly freak out if he is just misunderstanding. But the last message he received, from Paul, wasn’t too hard to decipher. It was simply: “I’m going to find you, and I’m going to kill you.”
Tony’s eyes close again, and he’s asleep within minutes, but Steve can’t fall back asleep for a long time. He just stares at Tony, wondering how he ever got so lucky to just…
They head back up the elevator together, wasting no time to head into the bathroom. Tony’s already stripped naked by the time Steve even has his shirt off, and he’s taken by surprise when Tony pulls him forward and kisses him deeply, running his hands under the waistband of Steve’s pajama pants.
Steve stares at Tony for a long time, wondering how this relationship even came about. Was it simple attraction for Tony? Steve knew he was attractive, but maybe it was something else. Maybe Tony had liked the company. Maybe Tony was just lonely. Maybe he wanted someone to show off to the media to make the world angry. Steve just couldn’t imagine it being anything else other than good sex, though. Because he had nothing to offer.
“I might stop by to see it,” Tony responds, and then he’s gone. Just walks away, end of conversation.
“I really wasn’t expecting you to still be here,” Tony murmurs, taking one of Steve’s feet and massaging the sole. “I thought I was going to wake up all alone and then I’d have to come hunt you down.”
“Independent contractor,” Steve lies easily. “Whatever people need me to do, I do.” It’s not technically a lie, really. That’s exactly what he does.
Steve bites his lip. “I, um…,” he begins, and then he sighs. There is no other way to get it out than to just say it. “Before I met you, I had a client,” he says, searching Tony’s face for repulsion at the mention of his former life, just a few weeks ago. When he sees none, he goes on. “He was really brutal. Gave me a cracked rib at some point. I ended our arrangement, and he was very upset about it.”
“Uh, no. Maybe after I get started. I want to at least have the slab carved down to size, then I’ll do the drawing.”
Steve bites his lip. “I’m working, Tony,” he finally says, and he can tell Tony was not expecting that answer.
Some of the floors were stocked like offices, but no one ever came to work in them. Steve wondered if Stark Tower had once been used for something else, or if maybe Tony was building a call center for some future investment idea. He didn’t ask, though, because Tony didn’t seem to like to talk about his wealth. He would just wave his hand around as if it didn’t matter, like money was nothing more than a thing that was just there, a convenience.
“I’m…,” he pauses. He doesn’t want to lie, but this feels like something he can’t tell Tony about. Not now. Not so soon. “I’m okay,” he finally says.
Steve shows him the food he’s prepared, and suddenly the domestic feeling hits him again. He doesn’t mind it, though. This time he’s prepared. This time he’s happy to know that this feeling is okay and is appreciated and even reciprocated.
Tony moves forward so he can press his lips against Steve’s cheek. Just a quick, gentle kiss but he sighs into it anyway. “I could have,” Tony acknowledges. “But I didn’t. Because you saved me.”
Steve shrugs. “I guess,” he says slowly, “when I was a kid I was alone a lot, so I had to learn to take care of myself.”
“That was great,” Paul says, dropping the payment onto the dresser by the door. “I’ll see you next week, Cap.”
He had to pick a couple of his favorite pieces to show, and then he had to go rent a suit because he didn’t actually own one. He could clean his place tomorrow, or next week. But this show was too important to pass up.
“Tell me you’re okay and mean it,” Tony says finally. His breath is on Steve’s cheek, so close he could probably just lean up a few inches and kiss him if he wanted to.
Steve gets up confidently and even makes it to the front of the gallery before he feels like his legs might give out. He holds his breath until he gets to his car, and when he gets in, he lets it out as slowly as possible. It takes a while before he is confident in his ability to drive home safely, but finally he pulls out of the parking lot and heads towards Brooklyn.
“I kind of like it without paint,” Tony says. “Stands out against this white tile in here. It’s nice.”
here. He wonders what it will be like when Tony eventually tosses him aside. How badly will his heart break, how long will it hurt for?
“My house,” Tony says. “You could use the whole two weeks and sculpt the thing right in the spot it’s going.”
Tony stretches when he stands up, his shirt ridding up a bit. Steve’s fingers reach out and touch the skin there lightly, smiling when Tony shivers at the unexpected contact.
When the coffee machine beeped, he poured himself a steaming cup and sipped it as he approached his easel. He paused briefly before sighing, and then he began to flip through some of his latest pieces. The depictions lately were of morbid, abstract things. He didn’t want to show those, so he searched for ones a few months previous.
“I’d just need to go to my place to get my supplies,” Steve says. “Any chance you’d want to come with me?”
Steve cuts him off with a kiss, cupping Tony’s face in his hands and smiling when Tony just stares back at him.
They stop to linger at a few interesting pieces of art, just so Tony can comment on them and have people write down his every word. For the most part they keep a reasonable distance between themselves so that the speculation just dies at the speculation. Steve doesn’t know if Tony’s doing it for his own sake, or because he wants Steve to feel comfortable, but he’s glad. He’s not embarrassed of Tony, but he thinks that maybe, possible, Tony should be embarrassed to be seen with him.
Steve just laughs. He’s glad that he’s in a place that he can laugh about someone paying a million dollars for something he created.
Steve falls asleep not too long after. He’s spent, and he’s tired, and that’s all he needs in order to have good dreams.
“There’s not enough for an investigation, unfortunately. There is nothing linking Paul Swanson to any of your injuries or the break-in or the car accident. Your text messages are a start, but still just words and no proof of action. All we can go on is that Lucas was injured, and he made a report. But it’s he said she said in this case. Do you see where I’m going with this, Mr. Rogers?”
Steve’s brush strokes are slow and precise. The varnish looks great on the statue and makes it shine. He admires how Tony looks in his wooden form, admires his own work. It may not have been carved from marble, but it looks brilliant anyway. It’ll be a great centerpiece for Tony’s birthday. And when people ask who carved it, Tony will feel a pain in his chest. He might not even tell anyone. He may just say he ordered it out of a catalog.
"They're not Kang's notes," Potts called out and they turned to see him zooming in on the scribbled words, a grim understanding on his face when he pointed to the screen, "This is familiar handwriting, and it's not Kang's. It's in Swedish on purpose."
Steve hadn't imagined looking at his own body lying dead before but this was enough to tell him that it wouldn't be a pleasant sight in reality.
Steve just grins back, and he takes his time as he pulls out completely, then pushes back in slowly. He moans at the sensation, but he tries to keep his movements even. He doesn’t want to hurt Tony, and it has been a while since he’s topped.
“Mr. Rogers,” the Detective Blakely nods. “Sorry to inconvenience you. I just have a few questions.”
A few moments later, Tony returns with a couple sodas and passes one to Steve. He wrinkles his nose at the news being played and holds out his hand for the remote.
It’s only seconds later but finally he arrives in the basement and feels, once again, completely out of his element. He’s covered in sawdust and he feels like it’s going to somehow intrude on whatever Tony is working on. This whole floor is covered in computers and equipment that look like they cost more than Steve’s whole life is worth.
“Let me get the doc,” Tony says. He gets up, and when his hand leaves Steve they both feel the sudden loss.
Tony just shakes his head, but he smiles gently. “Another time. Don’t you worry, we’ve got plenty of time for breakfast.”
He bites his lip, unsure of what to do. Was it a real invitation, or was Tony just pulling his leg? Maybe he wants to talk more about the drawing. Maybe he wants to just mess with Steve’s head. He’s not sure, and he doesn’t like the way his stomach is feeling right now, so instead of heading to the bar he makes his way into the bathroom and tries to calm himself down.
Steve leans forward and lets Tony’s arms envelop him. He wants to say something, to just apologize profusely about bringing Tony into this, but he can’t. He just holds onto Tony’s shirt tightly and lets him run soothing circles across his back.
“Weather’s supposed to be nice today,” Ryan says eventually, which is the cue for “time for you to get out.”
It only takes a few more minutes before Steve comes. Paul gives him a final squeeze before getting off the bed and going to wash his hands. Steve sits up, trying to ignore the pain in his stomach, in his groin, in his nipple, when Paul comes back.
“Hey,” he greets, and Tony doesn’t respond with words. Instead, he pulls Steve in for a deep kiss that leaves them both breathless.
Steve can’t keep the gentle smile off his face as he looks at Tony. He doesn’t know why he feels so content right now. He just does. And he likes the feeling.
“Same thing happened to Randy when he cut the guy loose, if I remember correctly. Threatens went on for a couple days, but eventually the brute moved on.”
Tony shifts backwards a little bit so he can study Steve’s face, but he finally smiles. “I know you will,” he says. “Nothing can keep you down, right?”
Steve nods back, his head in his work and not realizing where his hand is, until Tony steps up behind him.
To Paul, however, he carefully writes and then rereads several times, “Paul, I am very sorry but I will be unable to keep our arrangement. I have had something unexpected come up in my personal life that will make it impossible to continue meeting with you. I would be happy to help you find a replacement if the need arises.” It seems too formal, too easy. He knows Paul is going to be angry. He knows Paul is going to lash out. But what else can he do?
It’s that thought that gets Steve driving, and eventually he manages to put Paul on the backburner so he can think about Tony.
Steve stands up, takes Tony by the hand. “Come with me,” he says, and pulls Tony along to a hallway. He finds an empty room and closes the door behind them. The lights are dim, but Steve can still see Tony clearly. His face is neutral, not giving away how he’s feeling.
“Alright. Do you have somewhere with natural light?” Steve asks, clearing his throat so it doesn’t crack when he asks.
He headed back to the curator’s office to thank him but found it empty. He waited for a few moments before checking the time and deciding he could probably help out around the gallery for an hour before the patrons started arriving, and then he’d change into his suit for the event.
“These are perfect, Steve! I love how you turned this scene into something happy. I think the kids will love it, too.”
Tony looks like he’s about to make a witty joke, but his phone rings and he pulls it out of his pocket. His face clenches for a moment before he sighs and holds up a finger for Steve to wait. He steps back a few paces to answer, talking low, but Steve still hears most of the conversation.
He seems to like to watch Steve work. He will occasionally shift if he becomes uncomfortable sitting still for so long, but their eyes never meet. Steve is pretty sure that if they did, he wouldn’t be able to hide the burning in his stomach, the blood that is rushing south and threatening to expose him.
“Tony, what’s—,” Steve starts, and then the rest of the living room comes into view, and he can see suddenly why Tony is so stiff.
They sit there together for a few moments before the guy finally gets up off the bed and puts his clothes back on. He reaches into his wallet and pulls out the money owed, sitting it on the nightstand.
Sometimes that bothered Steve, though, because he had grown up with almost nothing. There were some days when he didn’t even get to eat because he didn’t have enough food growing up. There were some days when the roof on his old house leaked so bad that he’d have to sit up all night trying to catch the water in buckets so it didn’t destroy what was left of his home. Steve sometimes wonders if Tony ever felt like that, like he had to stay up all night to prevent his house from washing away.
Tony stops just a few feet from Steve, turns, and looks him up and down. He clearly wasn’t expecting a response. “It was a sculpture of myself,” Tony finally says. “For an event. My birthday, actually.”
Tony jumps anyway, but when he sees it’s Steve he smiles and pushes himself out from under the metal frame.
Tony gets up and puts his pants on quickly, then comes to stand in front of Steve, touching his face gently with his hand. He lowers his hand until it’s right over Steve’s hurt rib. “I would never hurt you,” Tony says. “I would never let anyone hurt you again.” Tony leans up, presses their lips together. It’s desperate. He doesn’t want Steve to go.
“That’s a good trait,” Tony compliments. He downs the rest of his soda before standing up and following behind Steve. “I’ll probably head down to the lab in a bit, so if you need me I’ll be there.”
The thought is enough to tighten his stomach muscles, and he can’t help it when he comes unexpectedly. Tony leans forward to lap up some of the come that ended up on Steve’s chest, thrusting through his own orgasm until both of them are a sticky mess.
Tony stares at the card for several seconds before his hand robotically reaches up and takes it, studying the design carefully. He flips the card over a couple times before looking back up at Steve.
After a minute, Steve locates his pants and pulls his phone out of his pocket. He opens his text messages and sits on the end of the bed while he writes messages to each of his clients. Maybe it’s because he’s tired, or maybe it’s because he really wants to try this thing with Tony, but he needs to be free to
. The word just seems strange, foreign. Steve has never experienced a regular relationship that looked anything like what he and Tony are doing, and the ones he did have couldn’t have been classified as
Steve also sees that his other arm, the one that hurts, is wrapped in a sling. He can’t tell if the bone is broken, or just sprained. He doesn’t have the strength to move it to see how bad it hurts. He wants to sit up, but there is no way to do it. He’s attached to too many machines, and his body hurts too much anyway.
Steve gulps as he looks at the messages one more time, wishing he’d stayed awake to get the first response back last night. He knew Paul would be angry, but he didn’t know it would turn into something sinister. The messages started out with, “You can’t just dump me like this!” and had progressed to “Is there someone else, who is it? Tell me who it is!” And when he’d gotten no response, Paul had taken things up a step: “You think you’re something special? I can find anybody to do what you do. You’re nothing but a slut,” and the fourth message, “If I find out who you’re with, I’m going to destroy their life!” which led up to the final, “I’m going to kill you” message.
“You’re fantastic,” Tony groans, holding Steve in place finally. “It’s been a while since…,” he trails off, his train of thought being interrupted when Steve brushes against his prostate. “God you’re so perfect,” he goes on.
“Neither,” Steve laughs, though he’s not sure why. Neither are laughing matters. “Just an art show tonight.”
“The model?” Steve laughs back. He doesn’t mention feeling the scar, or his curiosity about it. He wonders what could have happened to his man to cause such a deep blemish like that. Did it hurt, does it hurt now?
In total, Steve has five long-term clients. He used to take on new clients, or see multiple clients in a day, but he’s worked out a system that works for him. His work week begins on Thursday when he meets Ryan in his penthouse downtown. Ryan pays well, and they actually have fun together. It’s almost easy enough to forget that Ryan is work, and that when they both are satisfied, he’s going to pull out a large wad of cash and press it into Steve’s hand.
When the doors ding open, Steve strolls into the room and sees Tony standing there with a confused look on his face.
“I need to stop by the art show anyway and drop off my piece. Have to be there by eight in the morning, and your place is just too far to make it there in traffic.”
Instead of answering him, Tony leans up and closes the gap between their mouths. For a brief second, Tony is kissing Steve and Steve doesn’t respond. His mind is frozen in place. He doesn’t know what is going on, why Tony is doing this.
He nods, but slowly. “Yes, I think I’m coming with…,” he pauses. What does he call Tony? His boyfriend? It all seems too new to call it that. But, what else does one call the person they sleep with regularly? “Tony Stark will be accompanying me,” he finally says.
Tony takes a step forward. He reaches up and touches the blood on Steve’s shirt, his finger brushing over the nipple by accident. Steve jerks back, not from pain, but from the contact. He doesn’t really know what’s going on, but he knows he probably should go. Right now.
Occasionally, he and Tony needed some space from each other and Steve would go find a different floor to work on. There were a lot of them to choose from, and surprisingly, most of them were empty. Steve found it interesting to explore the floors that were furnished; it was as if Tony would occasionally get tired of his penthouse and would go to a lower floor to just try something different.
Steve thinks about it for a moment before finally shaking his head. The thought that Paul might be out there, watching him, makes him uneasy. He knows he’s quite safe here in Stark Tower, and Tony is safe, too. But out there in the open, anything could happen.
Steve sighs, wishing his thoughts would be quiet for once. He needs to get over Tony. He needs to move on. He needs to finish this project so he can go back to his life and be happy with the way things were before.
He rounds the corner and sees Tony standing at the bar, a couple bags of food in front of him. Steve starts to say something, ask what’s for dinner, but Tony’s body is rigid. He has a scowl. Everything about his stance says he is thoroughly uncomfortable.
“Maybe I want to do this!” Steve says back rhetorically. He sounds stupid coming out, so he knows Tony doesn’t believe him, but it still gets his point across.
On the other side of the door, Tony sighs. “I was expecting some kind of creepy sex den,” he admits.
“Technically, I own this place so I never have to get dressed. And my guests are under strict rules of ‘no shirts, no problems.’”
They’re quiet again for a while, and eventually Tony turns back to the movie and grabs another slice.
Steve sighs again. He doesn’t think Tony is taking this very seriously. The obvious threat to him has been like an elephant weighing on Steve’s chest. That’s why he’s always been so hesitant to let Tony take him out in public. He doesn’t want his identity to somehow cloud the view or perception of Tony Stark.
Tony takes another moment to look into Steve’s eyes before he brings their lips together again. It’s hesitant at first, asking Steve if he’s sure, if he really wants to do this right now, in this condition. Steve doesn’t pull back, and if anything he deepens the embrace.
They’re about ten minutes from the tower when Steve’s phone rings, and he has to look at it for several seconds because it’s the first time someone besides Tony has called him in a while.
Tony gets up again, moving towards the bathroom to take a quick shower. He beckons for Steve to follow him, and Steve does. Taking a shower together will certainly speed things up.
“I can get you out of here before anyone ever knows. Just walk out the front door like this never happened.”
Steve is still white faced, unable to do much besides look between Tony and Paul and wish he had not come out tonight.
Steve nods, but he quickly retreats into the bedroom so he can let the tears that are welling into his eyes escape. He turns on the shower quickly so that Tony won’t hear him sob. He eventually gets under the spray of water and hangs his head, trying not to think about what a failure he is.
Steve sighs. “I guess…,” he trails off. “I guess I’m just worried what will happen when those photos get posted online. Everyone will know that we’re spending a lot of time together.”
Steve leads him around the house, pointing out random things like his empty pantry or the linen closet by the bathroom for comedic relief. He pauses in the doorway of his bedroom, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach. He’s never had someone else in his house like this; someone like Tony: Someone he cares about, someone he has sex with because they’re in a relationship.
Steve just grins back, shaking his head. “I bet that’s what people say about your place,” Steve says.
He doesn’t wander far from home, just for a short walk to the convenience store on the corner. He picks up a six pack of Coke and a couple candy bars. He figures he’s got enough money to blow on some candy, and he deserves it anyway. Chocolate heals all wounds. Steve is pretty sure he heard that somewhere.
Tony pulls him in closer, wraps a leg around one of Steve’s. He dips in and kisses him, just a peck, but it sends shivers down Steve’s spine.
“Looks like you’ve been working,” Tony comments, ruffling Steve’s hair while he’s writing something down. Saw dust plumes into the air and Steve just nods.
“I want a perfect sculpture, not a probably sculpture,” Tony insists, and he takes another step. “Just do it. We’re both grown ups here.”
Steve grins, “I understand,” he says. “So clothed, neutral face, done in a week. Nothing to it, Mr. Stark.”
His art supplies are in the corner of the room, out of the way but still accessible, while his studio on one of the lower floors is being finished. He doesn’t need much, just a sketch pad, but it takes him a few seconds to dig through the pile of supplies until he finds the right pencil. He sits down on the couch and begins working, adding detail and shading until the sun peaks over the horizon.
Tony moves around the room, playing with things on the shelf or opening random drawers. Steve watches him carefully, looking for any sign that he is less than impressed. But he doesn’t see that. Instead, Tony seems fascinated by the apartment.
. Steve is pretty sure it’ll be an utter failure, and in a few days they’ll grow tired of finding new ways to get each other off. But for now, it’s nice to pretend he’s a normal person. No clients, just art and Tony. What else could he ask for?
“I didn’t notice,” Tony shrugs, downing the remainder of his glass and raising his hand for another one. “I wanted to talk to you about the sculpture thing,” he goes on. “I need a sculpture of me in two weeks. Can you do it?”
“I think everything you create is art by definition,” Steve murmurs, and then his ears turn red because did he
“Steve, is that…the guy?” Tony demands, his face suddenly unreadable. He turns so that when Paul arrives, he can be the strong one because Steve definitely is having trouble just breathing.
“I had a scholarship when I graduated high school,” Steve begins. “I went for two years but couldn’t make ends meet. I ended up getting a job at a bar, and then…,” he trails off. And then he became a prostitute and sold himself for money.
Steve didn’t comment when Tony tossed him the keys and let him drive, taking the offer as they rolled out of the guest house. It would have been faster to take a ferry or the train but they were both alright with taking the long way around, letting themselves have some extra time to sort their thoughts out. Tony put the radio on and changed the stations till he stopped as a newly joined Mariska Veres began crooning an ode to
“What will it take to make you stop?” Steve asked dryly as he dragged his face up from his hand, shooting the other man a deadpan look, “And what did you give Nat to make her show you this?”
“Your excuses get flimsier and uninteresting with every passing moment,” Tony declared before a grin spread over his face, mirth colouring his voice, “Did you miss me? Was this a depression beard?”
It was love and life, eight letters finding companions between each other as they created more meaning than they did separately.
"What's the plan?" he asked as they came into a brighter section of the maze of corridors, checking the cold walls as he walked.
By the time he had tasted corn in about six cities of four states, Steve was sure he was testing his tastebuds a little too much but he wasn’t sure where he would really stop. He rode on, intervals of sketches and meals in unnoticed diners, until he hit Arizona and met something wide enough to place his tangled mess of thoughts.
“She’ll come back,” Steve heard Tony say in a quiet tone, looking up to see him eyeing Steve with a chagrined expression, “I’ll fix it once we get home.”
The second thing she had done was the next morning, when she had stared at Tony across the newly arranged dining table before telling him to accompany her to work that day. Steve had been largely ignored.
Steve was trying to catch Tony’s eye throughout the afternoon but the other man found every method in the book to avoid it. There weren’t many people, nowhere near as many as there had been during her first birthday, and at first Natasha had been completely okay with it. They cut a home-baked cake that Jarvis had brought along and Maria sang for her daughter.
He recognized Tony and his eyes ran over every detail he could find, the dust on his face and frown between his brows were the only indicators of him being held. There were no bruises on him, none visible from what Steve could see.
A faint voice in his head chimed a third option of ‘his husband'. Tony decided that excruciating ache to his feet was a mild price to pay to avoid pursuing that line of thought.
Steve read the words over and over, till they rang in his mind as easily as his own name would find recognition. He had never thought that a piece of office stationery would have the power to reduce him to the barest form, to grind his walls into dust that were long awaited to meet their end.
"I'll take the juice," the man sounded amused and Tony looked over his shoulder to see him eye the place with a fond look before meeting Tony's eyes, "You can call me Doctor Potts."
Two months of a loose rope and Steve re-read the single sentence, remembering all the times in the years they were on the run that Nat would get tense about Wanda not checking in. On the particularly bad days, when they would come back from a botched up infiltration or there would be too many takeout cartons left half empty, he’d catch her texting. It took a lot to get a spy to break their paranoia but some things still managed to do it and it wasn’t until he had met up with Nat one noon in December, in town with Sharon on a mission, that Steve understood that it was Clint.
Steve watched Bucky leave and exhaled before pulling out his phone to call Pepper. They still had a funeral to plan and he wanted to make sure it went well.
"That's disappointing," Tony muttered under his breath but kept his gauntlet on as he made his way to Natasha's old quarters. She had her own booby traps in place, those that Tony hadn't touched ever since she had left on the last ‘mission', and whoever this was would have to evade them along with his own signals.
He didn’t know when he moved from the kitchen to the living room but he was frantically looking for the flip phone by the time he realized he was doing it. His fingers hovered over the keypad, a new message opened, before Steve switched format.
“Catch any tips there?” Natasha wiped the sweat off her chin and looked over her shoulder, blonde hair sticking to her forehead and skull with sweat lending them a darker hue.
Steve could feel the gaze of the woman linger on him for a second too long and resisted the urge to turn his face in a much too obvious show of suspicion. Before she could look closer though, Tony took a step forward, blocking her view of Steve and protecting him for the time being. An alert announced the arrival of Tony's floor first and Steve flexed his right palm imperceptibly as Tony exited the elevator.
"Why didn't you get back-up?" Tony asked, and Steve frowned as he wondered the same thing, "Doesn't your team have any – oh come on!"
“Scott told you that?” Steve took his SHIELD badge off and opened the door of the back seat, leaning in to get the shield.
Friday revealed that there was a video for the family and Steve was about to give them space when Pepper caught his eye, gesturing for him and Thor to come along.
“Now I have a daughter,” Howard surmised, omitting the rest of the realization and took a pause before looking at Steve, “Did you meet Pegs?”
"Why?" he asked even as his hands pushed back the woven leaf sash that was slipping down her shoulder, "What's special about cherries?"
There was a suspended moment in time when the three Avengers didn’t react, but Steve could see the other two get into position. Watching. Regrouping.
was renamed as the Natasha Romanoff Foundation by Pepper. It rained towards the end and Steve stood in the front row, letting his uniform soak under the downpour as the honours didn’t stop.
"She's still picky about you borrowing her jacket for Wanda," Tony mouthed over Steve's t-shirt and yawned as he turned his head to rest his ear over Steve's chest, "It's alright, I like being your new shiny shield."
It wasn't hard to find the docking bay and Tony thanked Nat a thousand times in his mind as the stealth training proved useful in sneaking his way in. He found their jet in less than stellar shape but it would do, they could finagle it enough to get the hell out.
They spent the first anniversary of their lives as Doctor Potts and Captain Stevens battling rogue weaponized armours that weren’t of Tony’s creation.
It was easy finding out the location of Hank Pym’s lab and Steve chose that, knowing that Tony was more suited to figuring out where Howard would have kept the Tesseract. He shot Tony a look when the other man gestured for him to get into the elevator first, a flourish in his body language. If anything, it seemed like Tony was enjoying this whole roleplaying business.
They got a corner table and the waitress gave him a second look but didn’t question his reappearance. Tony demolished his meal in less time than it took Steve to take two bites of his pie and then drank two cups of coffee like it was water.
The photo was like a scratch in a roll of film, a scar that would halt the story in the same spot every time. You could watch the movie again and again, start from the first scene or the twelfth, but the film would hit a broken note where the scar would mark its place forever. Steve stared at himself, smaller in every way possible and bound within a gilded frame but there was a freedom to that guy that he couldn’t remember waking up to in a long time. His eyes weren’t shy of the sun or the camera’s flash, hair friend to the wind’s direction, and he held his own worth without doubt of failure hitting him yet. He looked alive. He looked worthy of being remembered.
Steve felt the shuddering storm of a million turmoils threaten to overwhelm his balance and swallowed hard. One moment. A single moment of regrets and reaction was all he could afford.
"Jesus fuck, why didn't you retire?" Tony grumbled as he shifted his knees to get up, looking around them as he catalogued their surroundings, "Walking in through the front door, right. This is such a Steve plan."
Steve spent the days working through the cases that Peggy brought him to get inputs, the oddities and doubtful, and Tony kept himself busy consulting on Howard’s projects at the base. They didn’t discuss their current predicament but Steve could sense Tony’s silence getting tenser with each passing day. It was a thin sheet of ice but they were still standing on it, still afloat and Steve let it be till the crack would come.
Tony shot him a look from his side, a quick assessment of his profile, before looking ahead. He wasn’t prone to hand-wringing but he had tics of his own and Steve saw his fingers tap against his left knuckle, bittersweet fondness curling beneath his ribs.
They didn’t move to New York completely until two months later, when Tony finally understood that Steve was showing no hint of leaving.
The orb glowed in his palm and Steve saw the coordinates set in silver letters with a single slit on top.
When Bruce’s countdown reached one, Steve kept his eyes open and let the flash of light swallow him as they left together, once more into the breach.
“Alright,” Steve looked ahead of them and calculated what he knew about the base, “You could go get the particles and I’ll distract the –”
“Yes,” Tony turned to check the opening they had, looking back at Potts, “We need to get a hold of that Cube before we reach the Tower.”
The world didn’t change just because they did, and sometimes Steve wondered if they actually did change at all. Tony was still Tony and he was still Steve, and they were still bound to the same composition of beliefs and being.
"Walking in through the front door sounds nice," Potts clicked his tongue as the map switched, shifting his weight onto his left foot, "You coming?"
The attack came immediately, every possible defence system trained on the jet as he crashed through the bay, ramming into everything that came in his way. He could hear Steve's voice come through the comm and Kang's voice filtered through after a beat, the usual villain banter playing out but he had no time for amusement this time. The aerial bridge was guarded by flying suits that looked like a cross between the Chitauri shells and Mark I but their power was heavy. He heard Steve curse but forced himself to focus on the fight at hand, looking out for the man he was supposed to save.
“Yeah, okay,” Steve walked out to the porch talking on the phone and raised a brow at Bucky when he waved, “I’ll arrange for it, don’t worry. Yeah, I’ll call her in a while. Bye.”
like one," he replied and ducked the punch to his shoulder, "I have confirmed sources that you don't kiss like a seal, man. And that's pretty good."
“You know we’re seated perfectly for the seven year itch?” Steve asked distractedly and Tony raised a brow.
“I found this in the living room the first day,” he said, letting her pick it off his grasp slowly, “I should have given it sooner but somehow I never found the – it’s yours, right?”
“Hail Hydra,” he whispered in Sitwell’s ear and there was some part of him, some hardwired untouched idealism that curdled at the taste of the words on his tongue, but it was a small price to pay if they got through. It was a small price to pay if they got to save the real day.
"We don't know where we'll find him," Tony pointed out even as he got off the table, tossing the apple core into the trash with practised ease as he walked towards his older self, "What are you doing?"
“It’s a baby,” Steve said out loud, hoping that he was dreaming, that this was some strange nightmare that would break.
“Now that I’ve discovered the reason for your mood, it’s fine,” she agreed and Steve rolled his eyes lightly, “Have a good session today and tell Natasha that Rhodey left her gift at our place. I’m sure it was unintentional.”
Steve considered making a comment about titanium alloys and vibranium but figured that the tiny satisfied hum he heard was better to focus on. His palms had touched the familiarity of this man before, cupped gently over elbows and shoulders, clasped nicked fingers with fingerless gloves with the surety of his own body heat. He had skirted along the edges of
"A-bear-nation," he felt laughter bubbling in his throat and Potts grinned without looking away from the screen, "We're idiots."
"He gathered Selvig's notes," the handwriting, slanted in rushed ink was familiar from the notes they had once used themselves to try and dissect his understanding of the Tesseract, "If he's following Selvig –"
He couldn’t touch Tony and the man softened, edges withdrawing their defense and eyes lining with recognized kindness. Tony reached out and squeezed Steve’s shoulder, firm and warm and alive.
“Oh God, Tony,” he whispered and his hand hovered over Tony’s shoulder, too many emotions running through his systems. There was a prayer nobody said enough, a merciful answer to the ravaged souls, and this was Steve witnessing it.
"Commander Rogers is on the other side of the country," Tony pointed with his apple when he caught the questioning look, "I told you, we've all got different purposes now. He's fixing SHIELD or whatever's left of it."
“Something important,” Tony shifted on his bed and turned till his back faced Steve, “I’ll tell you when you leave for home again.”
“That’s fine,” he answered, whisper soft in the dark of the room, “Somebody’s got to represent the little guys.”
Strange didn't wait for Steve to get off the jet and met him at the base of the ramp, a cracked but bright blue orb in hand.
"Intruder alert", P.E.P.P.E.R warned a second before the armour protocol came into effect and Tony flexed his palm as he pulled at his watch to form the gauntlet. It would take 17 seconds for the rest of the suit to assemble after the half-completed overhaul from the previous night but till then he had enough power to stand against whatever had breached the security.
The door clicked open and he blinked away from the book he was skimming, looking up to see Tony pushing past the entrance with half-closed eyes.
“Did you have a baby yesterday?” Steve felt detached from the kitchen, the sound of his own voice hitting the water’s noise against the sink, “Sorry, that’s not – you have a child?”
“It’s been six months,” Steve raised his hand to scratch his neck and dropped it midway, “We got engaged and then nothing happened. Nothing. Not a discussion of where the wedding should be, how, when. It’s just - neither of us is popular for our patience and it’s like we chose this topic to be crazily patient about. So I thought, well, that maybe you…forgot.”
“The only person who had the sense to not leave his work unlocked,” Tony announced, walking into the room behind Steve, brushing Natasha’s hair aside before shooting Howard a deadpan look, “If you want her to fly, we can build her something when she’s older. Do we have to play projectile free fall with her now?”
“Rude,” she said lightly, taking another bite of her salad on the screen, the sound of the fireplace crackling, “You used to be nicer to me.”
One more push, one last arm's length and he could save the star. He had to save it, unlike what had happened to him when he had fallen, a long time ago. He needed this star to shine again.
“Take care,” Steve said when Pepper looked up at him through the window and she squeezed his hand once before nodding. Steve watched the car drive away and stayed there till his head settled, before turning back to the house.
Sam didn’t know about Natasha yet. They had spent two years in a tight-knit solidarity and he wouldn’t know what Nat had done for them.
The burning battlefield got smaller as they took flight and Steve turned away as he parked his bike, grimacing at the grime on his face as he removed his helmet. Tony was still flying the jet but switched to the AI mode when Steve walked towards him, turning his face to cast a casually fond look over his shoulder.
"You're almost as tiresome as the Starks," the conqueror observed casually before the jet began moving on its own, power dampened from the fortress, "It's time you joined them."
Tony, pouring him half of her own coffee and quietly slipping into the shadows when Tony invariably came down to find him. She had watched over him as they had gotten married, eyes sharp beneath the tears as her boys had promised what they had always done.
“I thought you were meeting Shuri today?” Steve considered for a second before gesturing towards the settee and finding his seat on the arm chair, “Clint said he was going with you.”
"How's the head now?" Steve tugged at the sheets once before climbing on when Tony relented by giving space, "Any better?"
It figured that their last truth had been a lie. It figured that this was her turn to not come home.
"We fight back, Steve," she was trained out of showing desperation but time had found a way to teach her the same again. Her fingers clenched and unfurled half-way into fists at her sides but she wouldn't step away, holding on to Steve's gaze. "It's what we always do. I know it's - rough now but we can - we need to keep trying."
There was no comparison between the two girls, there could never be, and Steve knew that it would always be a reality that there was a world where they had been different; they had had different futures planned.
them!” Hank yelled back over the comm. and Steve moved just in time to dodge the blasts from the Ant-Man suit, “Can you switch the codes or not?!”
Maybe he did. Maybe it was forged under their sheets over the growing nights of firsts and the engineer had deemed tonight worthy of testing it out at last.
“Oh” he heard and blinked, eyes looking up at the muted wonder in Nat’s voice. One glance and it was clear why she sounded the way she did.
“Here to do your laundry?” she asked and Steve made a show of rolling his eyes, wondering when the joke would let up.
Things didn’t get easier after that day, not really, but Steve wasn’t sure there was any point that would make their reality every
Tony shifted closer, just an inch, and Steve risked it. He could die tomorrow, he reasoned. He was already a culprit for more things than this. He would be remembered for bigger crimes than this one second of mercy.
“You’re staying in a dead man’s house, Steve, what exactly do you think I should understand?” Bucky looked unbothered, hair tied up today and his Henley’s arms were folded to the elbow, “And stop acting like I’m judging you. I got nothing to judge anyone about.”
"Oh, this should be good," Tony observed as he picked out two juice bottles from the fridge, deciding that he didn't need the alcohol to compound things at the moment.
Tony’s eyes closed when Steve pressed one last kiss and opened slowly as he leaned back, a wickedly happy glint in his eyes.
He watched the call end before putting his phone down and looked down at himself. It wasn’t that cold outside, not immediately, but he did like having a jacket with him when he went to his sessions. There was something to be said about layers and shields, but Steve had enough practice at taking hits. He stood up to go change, deciding on taking Pepper’s advice in the end.
“No! Stay back!” Steve stopped Thor from interrupting as Bruce yelled, power radiating up his arm in flashes of light. For a moment, for one long moment it looked like it wouldn’t happen.
“He should have a control base,” Potts pushed at Tony before extracting himself from Steve’s hold, “Can you crack the security?”
now, he amended in his mind as he turned onto his back and stared at the ceiling. The t-shirt rucked up in his movement but he ignored it, not really willing to change into a tank-top or go nude. He liked the shirt, its softer red converging into a single white star at the chest. Well, chest of the original owner and resting more on Tony's abdomen, but it was the comfort that mattered.
“You lose this again and I’m keeping it,” Tony told him as he held out the shield, waiting till Steve had a grip on it again before moving to let him stand, “Come on.”
“Natasha Stark,” Howard tried, face creasing into a slow smile when he heard it out loud, “That might just work.”
But Tony was the one who got to hold a tired Steve and feel the weight of his burdens settle into their bed. He was the knight to a soldier's weariness and he closed his arms around his husband's shoulders, palms stroking over his back.
Thanos pushed Tony off and Steve could feel the panic claw at his throat when he smirked, a proclamation of inevitability on his lips, fingers meeting as the gauntlet readied for the snap and –
He was in Waverly, fresh bunch of Iowa Rose in hand and eyes downcast over the porch of an abandoned home, when he got the first proper message from Natasha.
"Are you working from the control room?" he asked as he dragged the spare case for Widow's bites. It was concealed and powered down, spy's intuition saving it from being confiscated, and Tony could use it if he needed to.
“Why, do you have a copyright to it?” Tony cracked the lid open and took a drink, keeping eye contact with Steve as he did it.
He was standing over the sink again, finally closing the tap and watching the water escape down the drain when he recorded his twenty third message.
“I’m here,” he avoided the question because there was no answer to that, nothing that would keep the moment from exploding, “I’m here, sorry. I – God, I should be reacting better.”
"It's a code?" Steve moved forward, his fingers tightening on the strap of the scarred shield but Tony focused on the files being pulled up and it clicked.
“Leave some mystery for later, Cap, keeps things exciting,” Tony cut him off and patted the bed to emphasize, “Now open the envelope already, will you?”
“I didn’t realize it right away,” Tony began, running a finger over the rim of his cup, “The stones are sentient energies, a lot like AIs really. But just more cosmically connected ones. We see them as just gems with magical powers, right?”
Love, in Steve's experience, was the most painful of those. It was ironic then that it was also that which kept him going when nothing else made sense.
His hand reached out without his own accord and the man eyed it warily before raising a brow at Steve when it traced his cheek, grazing the beard.
“JARVIS,” Tony called out without looking away from Steve’s grinning face, “you up to officiate a shotgun wedding, buddy?”
“I don’t think lightning is going to be enough,” Tony assured him and Steve pressed a hand against Thor’s back, understanding his frustration but agreeing with Tony on the issue.
“He was the head of Rhodey’s department,” Tony crawled in further, leaning over to the back seat and dragged out the suit bag with a cleaning label, “We didn’t really get along but I was a frequent visitor at his office.”
He sat in the car for fifteen minutes outside the hospital and nobody disturbed him there. In there he was just an old man with his silence and a death grip on the wheel.
“Yes, I went to all this length because I missed you,” Steve said in his most deadpan tone, hoping to keep the panic at bay because this was too close to home, nearer to the nail than he wanted anyone to hit, “Satisfied?”
"I don't think this is a wise decision," Stephen commented from behind them but Potts waited for Tony to give him a short nod before grabbing his shoulder and tapping at his own chest, blue light radiating from an orb hanging on a silver chain.
"You need to get us to the- ow, fuck – base," Potts said even as Tony knew that Steve had begun inspecting the wound.
"Because I threw up last night," he agreed. Tony nodded again and stayed silent, letting Steve see him, watching his eyes roam over Tony's face slowly.
"Good plan," he informed dryly as the first set of bots began making their way to them from around the corridor.
“I’m on my way to the control room,” he relayed on the comm., eyes darting over the room, “Anybody got eyes on the Stark fa –”
Things weren’t awkward between them. Awkward was for situations like learning that your second best friend was secretly the son-in-law of the guy who was gunning for your entire team’s freedom. Tony was sure that Betty wouldn’t exactly
“They jammed our signal,” Tony cursed as he peered at his comm, looking over at Potts with a frustrated frown, “I didn’t know you had Extremis too.”
“There’s a fifty percent chance that nothing will go wrong,” Bruce said cheerfully and Steve had an intense urge to facepalm.
Steve shot him a look that promised that they would discuss these unknown plans later but opened the envelope, reaching in to pull a folded piece of paper out.
Tony raised a brow at his retreating figure but then stilled when he felt a hand on his shoulder, turning to face a tired but open Steve.
“Do we have a plan?” he could count the beats under the other man’s wrist, clear to his touch, and crouched behind Tony as they looked over at the source of the footsteps from their hiding spot. Air force, blonde, commanding air around them, faded boots, badge hanging from the neck – thankfully they were walking away from the car.
The controls weren't tampered with and he worked on finding a coordinate, any signal that could tell them the course out of the fortress.
Tony opened the boot of the car and Steve came around, curiosity winding into his skin, and saw the man pull out a cream blankie, a monkey’s form holding it on top, before Tony turned it around and –
He sent the photo as a reply to Nat and shut it, jamming it back into his jeans before turning around. It’s the least he can give her right now. A piece of something she’s lost too.
"Richards?" he heard an older voice and recognized it as Potts, moving to the nearest wall to get closer.
“You could have let it hit you,” Tony’s footsteps moved behind him and Steve could picture the stilted jerks of his hand gestures, “There are people you missed for five years and now they’re back in a time you could be in too. Sam, Wanda, Sharon, Barnes – tell me they’re not worth going back for.”
Steve walked towards the room and Tony followed him, just a step behind. There was a jacket thrown on the chair at the end of the room and his shoes tucked near the bed but Steve’s eyes fell on the metal leaning against the bed.
"We've got 2 minutes," Steve said as he marched forward, tossing Tony a plasma blaster as he moved without turning around. He checked to see that the thing had no safety and no biometric coding either, which would have been less relieving any other time but for now he followed Steve as they made their way towards the centre sphere they had found on the map. Steve walked steady but not too fast that Tony couldn't keep up, eyes trained forward and to his left as Tony kept watch to the left and an ear for any attack from the back. It was blissful to be silent as they walked but there was a tightness to Steve's shoulder whenever Tony's gaze skipped over him, coiled alertness that wasn't overtly on display even when they were on the field. His right arm was still broken so it might have been that but Tony had seen him shake worse breaks sooner, and it didn't help that Steve was specifically being slow in leading the way.
There was a softness to Tony’s tone that had been hesitant, half-wrapped in caution, when this whole mission had begun but now he allowed it to be heard. It was like the world was aligning on a partial axis, half of it still unbalanced, but Steve nodded. They all took what they got.
"I will," Steve said instead and Tony swallowed back any further questions, looking up when he felt his partner's presence near his chair. He didn't remove his glasses and Steve didn't attempt it either.
It was ironic how it had come down to them again, the first team that Natasha had stood beside, mourning her together. They had all been apart more than together but there was something about being an accident, a mistrusted bunch that had somehow worked, there was something about having been the first hope that couldn’t be broken even despite all the hopelessness they had wrought. They had started out together and it was some cosmic irony that they turned her last memory into a rallying cry together too.
“Me? Yeah, of course, what?” Tony would not admit to his voice cracking any time after he had crossed his unfortunate teens. He kept his eyes trained on the data flashing on the holotable but heard Rhodey pause.
"That's the thing," Tony said as he leaned against the door frame, eyeing the older man carefully, "If you're from the future then you should know this and I'm not sure what that says about you."
“That’s the other thing about this whole ‘me being alive’ thing,” Tony took a breath and met Steve’s eyes with a steely look, “I can’t go back.”
“It was his personal map to get forward, to find the milestones that were important to him,” Tony explained and Steve’s eyes fell to the notepad, a picture forming in his head when Tony looked up to catch his gaze, “I’ve been thinking about it for a while now.”
The crowds had moved into the shade and Steve was arranged the last of the burgers to carry over when he saw a hand pick one right off his plate. He leaned forward to snatch it back from Tony, a protest and a laugh ready to come when Tony easily turned his head.
“I’m Orion,” Natasha said as she settled in between them, eyes droopy but her fingers smoothing over the blanket, “Can I be Orion?”
“I can’t be sure,” Tony says anyway. “The SUV had blackout windows, and since the trail has gone cold I couldn’t see who got out of the vehicle.”
“You didn’t drag me anywhere,” Tony sighs. “If I didn’t want to be here, going through this with you, then I wouldn’t be.”
When he’d said as much, though, Tony just laughed and insisted that it was him who was intimidated by Steve. Young, handsome, basically carved by the gods, and talented in ways Tony could never imagine. Tony was smart, yes, but he drew stick figures unless he had a program help him design something. Steve was a talented artist. Tony insisted that was far more impressive than just knowing things.
The last few days were quite confusing for him. Tony had brought him food every day and they’d sat together, talking and laughing. They’d grown closer, they’d spent hours talking. Steve would work on the sculpture and Tony would watch him work. And then Steve had asked if he could trace Tony’s face with his hands, so he could sculpt the head better. Tony had agreed, and things had gotten weird pretty fast. They’d had a few chance brushes of their hands, a few accidental glances. And now here Tony was,
“I’m fine,” Steve says quickly. “Sometimes I just forget that the body needs blood flow to its extremities.”
Steve feels Tony’s hand in his, squeezing him gently, telling him that everything will be okay. He opens his mouth a few times to speak, but he just can’t come up with anything to say.
Tony nods. “Me too,” he says. “I slept a couple hours, but then genius struck me so I came down here.”
“I want to see you,” he says back, and Steve nods. He slides his jeans off and tosses them onto the floor. Suddenly they’re both sitting there in just their underwear and this thing they’re doing is actually happening.
Tony shifts so that his chest is pressed flush against Steve’s. He rests his head in the nook between Steve’s neck and his shoulder.
The wood certainly needs detail, but for the most part, it is exactly where Steve wants it to be. He’s ready to stop for the night, because he knows if he starts actually carving, he’ll get so lost in it that he’ll work until he falls asleep from sheer exhaustion. And he can’t do that. Because his client is going to be waiting for him in the morning. He has to leave this fantasy world he’s built to go back to reality.
“Mr. Rogers,” Steve corrects, and then he laughs a bit. “And there is no Mr. Rogers currently. No kids either.”
“Sure. I cleared my schedule for today so I’m all yours,” Tony says, and it doesn’t help the growing sensation in Steve’s low belly.
“I need a statement from Mr. Rogers,” the officer says, but he stands up anyway. “Can you come down to the station after things have settled down a bit? Detective Blakely is overseeing this investigation now. He’ll want to talk to Steve as soon as possible.”
Steve’s stomach growls and Tony grins. “I knew you’d be hungry!” he says, as if it were the lottery and he’s just won.
Tony stands in the doorway for several moments until he sighs quietly and then heads back into the living room. He understands that Steve needs a few minutes to himself, but he just wishes he could do
He doesn’t even think. He grips the check tightly in his hand and goes to find his keys. By the time he takes a breath, he’s already outside in his car, foot on the gas pedal, driving towards Stark Tower. He gets there in record time, and the guard calls Tony up to make sure Steve is welcome since he isn’t on the list.
Steve chuckles and the two of them head back outside to Tony’s car. He pretends not to notice, but Steve sees Tony look around cautiously before holding the car door open and then closing it when he’s is safely inside.
“Good. Don’t respond. You need to block his number and forget he ever existed. He’s a lot of talk, but I don’t think he’d actually go as far as hunting you down. He’s a businessman, you know?”
When Steve is done talking, he exhales and tries not to look Tony in the eye. He’s embarrassed, winded for talking so much, and nervous for Tony’s response. After several moments of silence, Steve manages to look up and sees a look of bewilderment on Tony’s face.
When the door is locked behind them, Tony turns Steve around and grips his face. He tries just talking to him, tries to bring him out of his panic, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Even a carefully placed kiss doesn’t help Steve breathe again.
“I’m giving him until next Friday to finish, and if it’s not at my house by next Friday then I’m not coming back here, and I’m letting all my friends know whose fault this is!”
It’s barely 7:30 when Steve sighs and puts on some clean clothes and shoves his feet into his shoes. He’s going to go drop his work off at the gallery and then he’s going to go buy a coffee pot. And maybe a few groceries, because he didn’t realize that all his food is out of date. As much as he’d liked being at Tony’s place, it was tough coming home to be by himself when he had forgotten to take care of his own basic needs.
Tony squints, reads over the letter, and then finally takes a step back and shrugs. “I didn’t know they’d send you something,” he says finally. “I didn’t know you got a commission.”
“Maybe for you, but do you know what my wife said when the police showed up at my house, Steve? She said she wanted a divorce. Because she believes you, and that’s all that matters.”
Paul undoes his own pants, takes himself into his hand and starts pumping. He stops only when Steve shifts to put his arm behind his head, seeming to not like it.
Steve nods, and then approaches. Tony pecks him on the lips and then graciously accepts the bottle of water Steve has brought down for him.
They’re quiet for a moment before Tony says, “The sculpture was a big hit, by the way. Everyone really loved it.
Steve manages to get up and wander over to the bathroom, grimacing only when he bumps his shoulder against the door frame. It’s harder than he expected to urinate using the opposite hand he usually holds himself with, but he finally finishes with a triumphant smile on his face. He thinks about taking a shower, but the thought of holding himself upright for so long sounds incredibly daunting. He thinks he can probably talk Tony into taking a bath with him later on, anyway.
Steve just rolls his eyes, but he smiles anyway. “This is home,” he says eventually. “Not much to look at, but it’s served me well.”
When he gets to the ballroom, the varnish and a fresh brush is waiting for him. He inspects the sculpture first, making sure everything has dried as expected, before getting the brush ready. This last step probably won’t take more than an hour, and after that, he’ll be done. Tony doesn’t want it painted, and Steve will have no reason to come back to the tower. They can actually go on with their lives like this past week never happened.
Tony hesitates, but finally just signs. “Yes, I guess we should both get this over with. The sooner you finish, the sooner you’ll be back over here.”
Steve gasps, just one, quick breath that shudders through his body. He holds Tony for support, trying to keep his body upright. The first breath was rough, but the next few help with his panic. His face starts going back to the proper color, his eyes don’t look as frantic.
Instead of going straight to work as he’d intended, it takes Steve a while to settle in. His apartment has been his home for years, but after spending so much time at Tony’s, he realizes how nice it is to have nice things. His couch, ratty and old, is uncomfortable compared to Tony’s leather recliner. His bed, worn and sunken, is insulting since he’s slept on Tony’s luxury king mattress. But, while his things might not be nice, he acknowledges that he worked hard to get them, and he’s proud to at least own
Usually they spend a few hours talking about Ryan’s week, his stressful job, and how things are going in the world. Ryan likes to talk, and he likes to have a football game on in the background while they chat because it gives them something to break up the awkwardness of what they’re doing.
Steve bites his lip, realizing that he’s not the only person that let Paul get away with what’s been going on, but he could have ended it. He could have made a police report. He could have prevented anyone else from getting hurt. He could have at least saved Lucas from suffering.
Steve takes a step towards the elevator, but within that second Tony has already reached him, spun him around and pressed him forcefully up against the kitchen counter. He’s got his hands tight around Steve’s collar, his expression unreadable. Steve thinks Tony might hit him, but he’s equally surprised when instead, Tony presses their mouths together roughly.
Tony reaches forward and lowers Steve’s boxers, letting his leaking erection spring free from the confine. He leans down, using his tongue to lick the slit, and Steve throws his head back from the pleasure. He groans, trying to keep his moans quiet but not being successful.
Steve moves forward, his brain taking control. He doesn’t see Ryan anymore. He sees Tony there, on all fours, begging to be fucked. Steve leans forward, grasps Ryan’s dick in his hand while he opens the cap of the lube with his other. He pumps his fist a few times and then coats his fingers with the lube. He slowly pushes one into Ryan, adding another, and finally a third. Ryan swoons on the bed, fucking himself backwards onto Steve’s fingers.
Except, it doesn’t really because they mostly just lean against each other under the spray, kissing languidly.
Steve is silent. He doesn’t want to make Paul any more angry than he is, but he also is not going to admit to something that isn’t true. If he is going to die, might as well be with a clean conscience.
He starts on Steve’s belt, not even hesitating before he reaches down and gives him a rough squeeze through his jeans.
“Did nobody tell you about muddied shoes and carpets?” he heard before turning around to see Nat come from the old lab, “You look like shit.”
. Nobody knew why, it didn’t make sense because Thanos being crazy could not just be it. One mad man could not have been the only reason an entire world was dead.
There was a watch, Tony’s rings, and some coins that Steve had kept on the bedside before leaving, and it was the only companion to them as they rested. A time, change, and two memories.
"I trust you to get us out of here," Steve shifted his wrist to catch Tony's wrist in his palm, "Do you trust me?"
“Someone’s slow alright,” Nat peeled off the velcro from her wrapped hands and turned to walk towards the bench, “Late mornings becoming the norm there, Cap?”
Kang roared through the comm and Potts landed, a sharp curse dropping off his lips as the hatch closed behind him.
“Both of them are pointless questions, really,” Tony informed him and Steve rolled his eyes, hand reaching to his left to pick up the smoothie that had been forcefully delivered to him an hour ago, “I’m going to forgive your ignorance of my smoothie for a whole hour –”
“If we meet him, yes,” Steve replied because there were enough lies to keep track of, enough words left unsaid from the past and this wasn’t one to add to that list.
“Stevens!” a voice called out from above and Steve looked to see Howard Stark leaning over the banister of the stairs, “Catch!”
It wasn't bitter, he knew his husband enough to know when he actually sounded bitter, but Tony couldn't stop his hackles from rising.
“Okay, before you lose it,” Tony raised a hand when Steve turned to face him, his back facing the wall, “Will you hear me out completely?”
“Yeah,” Tony moved forward and his shoulder brushed Steve’s, turning to give him a wry smile, “Maybe stop dropping it everywhere? I’m pretty sure Mr. Raccoon is a bit of a thief and this is a shiny, shiny thing that people would like to get their hands on.”
Howard had been a mess for almost a month after they had turned up unsuccessful and Steve had refused to pursue the line of thought since then. They didn’t know what had changed or gone another way but whatever it was, he wasn’t willing to endanger the life of those in the present for the possibility of a future he didn’t know anymore.
There had been nothing simple about watching a coffin fall through the sky. Natasha had felt the awareness of disaster first, before catching sight of it. It was in her DNA, the instinct of knowing when a life-changing moment occurred and where to hide if it came for her. She was good at running, at finding shelter from storms.
“Yeah, she said she could use the help,” he focused on his task but couldn’t help but feel like he was a little wrong-footed.
“Hi,” Steve let out an incredulous huff before shaking his head, “How? Wait, which Tony Stark are you?”
Focusing on his own mission, Steve grabbed the vials of Pym Particles and slipped out of the lab without being detected. He was halfway down the corridor when he spotted guards walking towards him alongside the lady who had ridden the elevator with them before.
“Anyway, he used to have this thing he did before anything new, this tic,” Tony inhaled and turned his face but didn’t meet Steve’s eyes, “He’d mutter this phrase under his breath and take a minute before getting to it. 5 Schritte zum ziel.”
“- and not chalk it up to your terrible choices,” Tony continued unperturbed before pointing a finger at the photo on his phone, “Which surprisingly doesn’t include this.”
By the skin of their teeth, taking more hits than they could prepare for, but they were holding their own and winning.
“That’s the summary, yes,” Tony pressed his palms to his face and breathed hard, not looking up when Steve dropped the files on the table to sit next to him. He held it together for two minutes, trying not to fall apart before the first sob came and Steve rubbed a hand over his shoulder as Tony let everything hit him. They sat with a distance till Tony cursed, Morgan’s memory wracking him right alongside the knowledge that Maria wouldn’t be his mother here, no second chances again.
Tony screamed onscreen but there was a blinding light that made Steve close his eyes for a second before he tried to make out his husband's form again.
There was a moment of silence where Tony didn't look away from his screen and then glanced up to see his friend consider him.
"Tony, -" Steve paused and he didn't know what the rest of the sentence wanted to become but there was something to be told and he had swallowed the words so many times that they didn't fit on his tongue right now.
“You weren’t really born here, right?” Steve noted the posters on the wall and heard the amusement in Tony’s voice.
“You could have gone higher with the last side,” Steve quipped, getting to his feet with a smooth exhale, offering a half-shrug, “Too slow, Widow.”
Tony nodded and his eyes ticked down for a second before he huffed shortly, a quicksilver flash of repressed understanding. They always did speak better in glances.
“See you in a minute,” Steve quipped with an amused glance before the flash of light swallowed them back out of the timeline.
with an itching pressure on his skin, “Rocket and Nebula can work on intergalactic operations, Carol can call us in if there’s something needed, we have Rhodey, Cl –”
"You're hunting us for something that hasn't happened," Steve heard Tony call out to Potts to be careful but kept his attention on the tyrant before him, "I'm not the Steve Rogers you're looking for."
He hadn’t planned it but he pulled out the flip phone from his jacket and flicked it open, screen lighting up in an imitation of the dotted stars above him. He didn’t know what words would fit a conversation never meant to be completed, not really, but his fingers moved before he could pull back from the thought.
“He will when I tell him that Hulk almost killed me in my own elevator,” Tony shot Steve a flash of a grin before turning back to the car they had jacked, “You know, I’m not so sure Hank Pym will. Did you know that he has some sort of a grudge against me? Or maybe my dad, more accurately, but the legacy continues apparently.”
A thrill of ridiculous excitement went through him when he had the Sceptre in his hands and Steve grinned to himself as he left the elevator without throwing a single punch.
"Let's see how you react when time breaks your laws," the purple-faced madman commented and worked on the panel in his armrest.
This was supposed to be their second chance. Third maybe, if he considered the brief hope he’d harboured five years ago during that trip to The Garden. Of all the mistakes they had made, the missed calls, this was supposed to be a renewed chance. It had seemed like a joke in the beginning, like all dreams do to starved souls with burned fingers, but then it had been one day, two, and three of effort. There had been a voice in his mind, cracking through the surface.
“Not till I figured out how to focus,” Tony took another long gulp of his coffee, “At first it was just an awareness of something being released. Like one part of me was free.”
The teenager made a face but his grin didn’t drop as he jammed the helmet over his head, swinging his legs behind Steve and patting his shoulders insistently.
“Oh come on,” he sighed as his own face stared back at him with a determined look. It was never a good day when you had to fight yourself and Steve was sure he’d end up leaving with a bigger mess than he would have time to fix.
“You’re going back?” Bruce asked when he took his leave two hours later, having said his goodbyes to everyone and a half-hour Skype call with Pepper.
“I’m just going to carry the jet myself if you ask me aga - oh, yeah,” Tony’s voice came through the comm and he could hear the whirring sound in the background, “I’m done, when’re you getting here, honestly Cap, you’re late.”
It was what he could do when he thought of Sam, he’d decided. He hadn’t planned on bumping into another Sam in the whole deal.
"Thanks," Potts took the bottle from him when he offered, eyeing it for a second before downing it and letting out a relieved exhale, looking up at Tony with a nonchalant expression, "Sorry, running from a time conqueror gets you a bit parched."
“Go?” Tony eyed the entrance of the alley and looked back at Steve, “Go where? You could use the time coordinator from here.”
“I will answer reasonable questions and excuse you the assumption that I cannot call you without being told to do so,” Pepper reminded him and Steve made a face but nodded.
They were greeted by a butler when they reached the foyer and Steve was attuned enough to Tony’s body language to sense recognition, eyeing the man a second time before he realized who it was.
Steve had been pushed up against the walls of every alley in Brooklyn. He had tasted the pain of knuckles and boots in a Hydra bunker with the Skull lording over him. The Chitauri had shot him in the gut, knocking him to his knees on a burning down New York road. His best friend had punched him down a Helicarrier, rage cold in metal arm. The hubris of good intentions had thrown him off a bridge when an Ultron bot chased him on a flying city. His lies had burnt him on a cold Siberian morning and a bloodied shield had slipped from his hand. A dead Titan had spared him even as his friends dissolved to dust around him.
“You couldn’t live with your failure.” Thanos said, and Steve hefted his shield tighter at the detached curiosity in his tone, “And where did that bring you? Back to me.”
"Right," Steve got to work, the grunts and hisses from Potts telling Tony that he wasn't winning the battle against a focused Captain America, "This will go easier if you pipe down, I'm just saying. It's like Clint and you combined here."
Steve followed Tony around to the front of the car and watched him peer into the driver’s seat before grinning wildly at Steve.
“You ready, Iron Man?” he asked as he gunned his bike towards the Avenjet’s spot, ducking and weaving between mines going off around him.
"That wasn't all good," Steve pointed out with a wet chuckle and she raised one hand to squeeze his shoulder with a feeble grin of her own.
They evolved and circled, twisting around each other in an intricate DNA code that nobody else would be privy to. It was ingrained in them, this knowledge of the other’s presence and effect, and that became more recognizable to their senses.
“You look good as a brunet,” Tony declared with a critical eye looking between the photo and Steve, “That’s annoying. You’re encroaching into my territory.”
Hope had insisted on driving Pepper to her parents’ house and was getting the car around when Pepper turned to Steve, standing at the back entrance of the house.
The freestanding bag wasn’t her usual choice of workout but some days weren’t purely exercise as much as the need to exert. The leather was reinforced for the superhuman opponents it faced but he could make out the indents of fists and feet slowly beginning to set in as Nat went at it without relief. Hit, kick, thwap of an arch, precision didn’t let up as Steve watched her let practice flow through.
“Your baby,” Steve echoed and was this his world, was he in the same plane of existence as he had been on the couch, “Your – I’m sorry, I think I’m missing something.”
"Why is it always you when I'm in my most embarrassing situations?" Tony demanded, speaking over Potts when the man started to say something, "I specifically told Reed to tell you
“And then Tony punched Ross in the face,” Pepper said, a laugh on her lips at Steve’s wide eyes, “Happy would have been proud, it was an excellent punch. One shot. I was a little worried about my carpet.”
“Here,” Tony said and Steve moved, following him when he dragged them over to the next wash basin, feet obeying where his eyes wouldn’t. He raised his free hand to his own cheek and Tony caught it in the other hand, shaking his head when Steve looked at him. Maybe it was weird that Steve shook his head too, maybe the tears still flowing in haphazard lines down his face were supposed be accompanied by sound. But he couldn’t think about that yet and Tony didn’t mind, he didn’t mention either, so Steve was going to follow Tony till he could make sense again.
“Whenever you’re here,” Tony responds, and Steve rolls his eyes, knowing it’s a jab at not having slept over last night.
Steve can’t help but to smile. Tony is certainly known for his antics, and the media eats him up and broadcasts his every public move. They must have wondered lately where he was, and why he was hiding.
And after he’s done admiring it, Steve returns the supplies to the table, does a final sweep, and then heads back to the elevator. He sends Tony a final message, “Sculpture is finished. It needs to dry for 24 hours before being moved. Happy early birthday, Tony,” and then he pockets his phone and tries to ignore the pang in his chest as he drives home.
Steve just smiles again. He starts to respond, but his phone dings and he pulls it out of his pocket, eyebrows furrowing when he sees there are five new text messages, all from the same number.
. Steve had been dreaming about it for a week now, but it was Tony who made the move. It was Tony who cornered by beside the table, Tony who touched him, Tony who kissed him.
“I want to help you,” Tony finally says. “But if you think doing nothing is the best option, then we’ll try it your way.”
“Be mine, Steve,” Tony says again. “I’ll take care of you. I won’t let anyone hurt you ever again. Just say you’ll be mine.”
“Of course! Everyone was so impressed with your last piece, since it brought such a massive donation for the hospital.”
Steve nods, but when the detective closes the door behind him he realizes, suddenly, that he’s not quite sure what really happened. Everything unfolded so fast, and Steve was in shock.
When he’s satisfied with the varnish coat, he steps back and stands besides Tony to admire the work.
He closes his eyes, knowing Tony is watching him curiously, and moves his hands from Tony’s sides up to his shoulders. He takes mental notes about how it feels, how the skin curves along muscles, how Tony’s breath sucks in when he reaches a sensitive place on his skin.
Taking a breath, Steve turns to Tony and looks at him for several seconds. Tony is rambling on about a prototype in his lab that didn’t work quite as expected, about how he’ll have to tweak the programming when they get back from the art show later, about—
“Mr. Stark is expecting you. Pull to the front and someone will park your car. Go inside, 51st flood.”
They’re quiet again for a moment. “Everybody wants to be happy,” says a girl in the back of the line.
