“Come on, Nat. You’ve gotta give me something. Steve’s in the hospital with the mental state that could lead to an act of terrorism. That man is going to tear up the entire state of New York if we don’t get him any answers.”
But Steve could hardly focus on the newly opened avenues; he could only feel the grease on his fingers, could only feel Tony’s overgrown beard scratching at his sides. He wasn’t sure if it was better than when his fingers felt Tony’s now pronounced ribcage. He should have been here sooner; Tony had been counting on him.
If Steve could do one final thing for Tony and for the rest of his family, is give them a chance to continue to live their life. After everything that he’d put them through, it was the least he could do for them. Especially since they’d given him so much. Which is why he planned on slipping out of the speakeasy now, planning to meet Fury alone.
“Listen, he never hinted once that he would turn me in. I don’t think he’s gonna do it. If you go back over there and provoke him, he’ll turn on us.”
Tony jolted, Phil’s words echoing in his skull. What the hell was he doing, making out with Steve like a teenager?
She quickened her pace to her tiny office, shutting the door as quietly as she could behind her. Natasha could almost hear Clint laughing at the idea of her hiding from a suburban mother of three in leggings and matching sneakers.
Clint clenched his jaw. “I don’t have time to waste on you. Come on, Thor. This asshole will get what’s coming to him eventually.”
He blatantly avoided his reflection in the mirror as he wiped his hands with scented paper towels. He knew what he would see, he just wasn’t ready to face it. Clint eyed the clock on the wall. It had been almost ten minutes. He should probably head back before Tony made good word on his security threat.
Even now, every day crammed in a smelly car on a race against time, Steve couldn’t keep the smile off his face. When Tony had first brought up the idea of a normal life, one that he’d consider sharing with Steve, Steve had agreed wholeheartedly, but soon cast it from his mind.
Steve sighed, but obliged Bucky, knowing him to be even more stubborn than Steve himself. The pair stomped down the wrought iron steps of their base, mostly abandoned because of the hour. Almost everyone had returned home, returned to normal life, if only for an moment. Part of Steve wanted to protest, to keep them here, out of sight and out of HYDRA's reach. But he knew that he couldn't. His desire to keep them safe was the same desire that pushed them to pack up and leave each night, to get home to their real families. People he'd never met, only seen through shared photographs or heard through a phone call. It didn't matter, though; the weight of his responsibility included them as well.
What really got under Tony’s skin was how successful Asgard was. It wasn’t like their products were compete shit like Hammer’s, but it was just
Stane laughed as they pulled away, walking back down the hall. "Wait!" he heard Loki call out, his face pressed against the cell. "I'll tell you everything! Anything you want to know!"
Delmar had been presented with files on each of the Avengers, but none was more elusive than Clinton Barton. There wasn’t a lot on him, just some assassin turned SHIELD agent. Now he was running around pretending to be a super hero.
Steve tuned out the other man’s grumbling, his super hearing listening in. His ears quickly zoned  on a few faint sounds from behind the back wall. Curiosity getting the best of him, Steve traversed to the back wall, placing an ear against the cold cement wall.
Tony swallowed thickly, eyeing the tree line again. It was beautiful enough to be a postcard. Tony liked to imagine him walking out here each morning to find Steve stretching the view, his golden hair shining in the morning rays of the sun. A stray tear slid down his cheek.
“So,” Steve huffed. “Dinner first, hopefully with a nice dessert,” he stated, with a deep kiss to Tony.
Of course, Tony may be a sick bastard, but he’s not insane. He never deals with the mobs like Hammer or the Ten Rings. If those criminals ever got their hands on Tony’s tech, it would be bad news for a lot of people. Which is now he ended up becoming ‘Most Likely to Be Kidnapped’.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve murmured, stepping out to bundle the smaller man in his arms, before freezing. “Can I hug you?” he asked.
“We had a fight before he was shot,” Steve replied softly. “I said some things. Hell, I basically told Tony that he was a bad father, Clint. Why would I say something like that? How could that thought ever cross my mind? This whole time I’ve been sitting here thinking that what if that was the last thing he thought about? I mean, he’s a great father Clint, and I just- ”
So, of course the two companies were constantly at each other’s throats. They were both monopolies in their division; no company stood a chance in taking them out. What else was there to do besides go after each other? Stark keeps trying to convert the world to solely his tech, while Asgard constantly tries to steal Stark’s weapon contracts.
Any hope of catching Fury off guard was quickly stamped out, as Fury’s stone-cold expression shifted over to him. “Officer Coulson? He’s dead. Lost in the line of fire to gang violence. We held a memorial for him not too long ago; he was a good man.”
“You sit there like you’re so high and mighty, but you can’t even seem to manage your local precincts, let alone Manhattan. Who’s begging for scraps now?” Tony hissed.
Tony tried to reassure himself. It had been over a week; if The Rings still had Steve, they would have heard about it, right? Steve already upheld his part of the bargain, so they didn’t need him anymore, right?
“Oh, here comes the threats. Trying to get me to quiver in my boots? Maybe let my brother throw me around a few minutes; that will definitely mess with my head. And then, of course, you send in Romanoff, the saving grace. After whatever tortures you can concoct, she’ll come as a friend. And then I would cooperate,” he said with a sneer. “You’re all too predictable; don’t waste my time.”
Fury sighed again. “Fine. Alleged involvement. And somewhere along the line, you’ve managed to piss someone off.”
Pierce flopped back down behind his desk, idly flipping through the file. His man was right; Stark had left The Captain’s name right in the open. While he didn’t straight up go and tweet the name to the internet, anyone with two opposable thumbs could delve through the web and find his name easily. Tony Stark had really outdone himself. It wouldn’t be long before everyone knew the name of-
“Did you tell him anything?” Steve asked again, softly this time, eyes welling as they stared into Tony’s.
Of course it was just the cherry on top when fucking Captain America flung himself into the building.
Tony’s voice caught his attention right at the plate broke underneath him, Steve’s strength cutting straight through the ceramic. Steve clenched his jaw, feeling the metal of the knife start to bend as well. “Here,” he said, dropping his own plate in front of Pietro before picking up the broken plate and grabbing the newspaper.
“You’re here!” Tony shouted, too loudly – the way he got after not enough sleep and too much coffee.
Tony glanced over to him, but Steve just shook his head. “Give him time to process,” he said. “He doesn’t really do the whole feelings thing. When we were in middle school, he volunteered at the hospital just because he was too scared to the dance with this girl. He’s got a real way with words, doesn’t he?”
The two men stared at each other long and hard. Pierce sighed, looking down at his hands. “This needs to be dealt with. Hammer,” he nodded to the other man, “call The Monger. He needs to know about this.” Hammer nodded before rushing out of the office.
“Tony, my boy, Pepper’s right. Take a vacation; get out of New York for a while. It isn’t safe for you here,” Stane tried to argue.
The man in the chair still ignored Romanoff, opting to take a look around the room. His gaze met The Captain’s, and then Tony’s. Tony couldn’t help but smile when he saw the man give a small flinch. “So it’s true then. You guys are working together?”
The pair was pulled along a hallway, just as damp as their current boarding, revolting smells clogging his nose and mouth every time he drew a breath.
“I just got off the phone with Phil,” inserted Clint. “He didn’t know anything about it. At first I thought it was because he doesn’t handle those cases, but this is Tony Stark we’re talking about. If he went missing, the entire world would know about it. I had Phil check the recent reports, and there was nothing.”
as Clint liked to call it, hadn’t been easy. Yes, Tony was alive and better yet, in love with him and Bucky, but they still had plenty of bumps along the way. Both Bucky and Steve had become almost suffocatingly overprotective, unable to leave Tony’s side, regardless of the Extremis running through their veins. Turned out they needed more healing from the process than Tony did, the codependency taking a toll on the team and their newly formed relationship.
to be gathering their things instead of whispering giggled insults into the others’ ears at Emily’s display. “I’ll never be as good as them,” she added.
“Your dad used this place as a quiet place to think all the time, so it wasn’t hard conclusion to come to. You’re a lot more like him than you care to admit.”
but it was if his body had refused the order. A block of ice in a sea of flames, unaccepting of the fate that lay before him. The flames were taunting him, almost laughing as they danced through the open crevices that he used to call his home.
Stark shot him an unimpressed glance. “Someone’s got to watch out for you, ya big lug. Can’t have you dozing off when the real battle begins.” He smirked, gaze Steve his customary salute, and slipped out the door.
“You just got interrogated by Clint Barton,” Barnes replied, clapping a hand on Loki’s shoulder. “You played your part so well. Seriously, Oscar worthy. It was almost as if you really believed you were getting out of here.”
“Relax,” Tony’s voice filtered into his left ear, a soft grip appearing on his shoulder. “Barnes is fine. He’s just sulking. Don’t worry; he’s not going anywhere.”
Tony picked at his already impeccably clean suit. “That’s true. Why do it myself when I could just pay someone to do it for me?”
Tony and Steve had made the decision to take the brunt of the fall in order to deal with Fury. With both of them together, they should have enough to entice the him to come to some sort of plea for the rest of the family. But after heading to bed last night, Steve had tossed and turned at the thought of Tony in an orange jumpsuit. It was a recurring nightmare, popping up ever since Tony had become more involved with The Commandos. Tony had spent years riding coattails and hiding in the shadows, dabbling in the criminal world just to satisfy his appetite. But he wasn’t an accessory anymore, By Tony jumping on their bandwagon full heartedly, he’d become more desperate, sloppy even. Now, he’s backed into a wall like the rest of them, facing down the barrel of a full life sentence.
“I said they could leave. I didn’t say they could leave alive,” Steve responded, stepping closer to Hammer.
“Call an ambulance,” snapped Obie, his hands firmly gripping Tony’s shoulders. Tony watched as Pepper obeyed immediately, her face pale and drawn. “What the hell happened to you, boy?”
Continuing down the hall, Tony found that he was in some abandoned warehouse; very easy to maneuver.
Coulson hadn’t managed to find any files on Officer Rumlow, thus cementing the idea that HYDRA had someone working with them within the precinct. What held Steve on edge more was the fact that Stark hadn’t been digging up anymore dirt either. It seemed that all of Rumlow’s files had been redacted or completely destroyed.
Tony stumbled back the way had come, much more slowly as the added weight of Barnes and oxygen deprivation caught up with him.  When Tony finally managed to find the stairs again, he barely had time to reach for the suitcase when a second blast rippled through the building. Tony immediately brought Barnes under him, using his body as a shield as a few more chunks of scrap came falling down. Groaning, Tony looked up only to gasp. Another huge groan echoed through the building, Tony watching in horror as the rest of the ceiling started to collapse, the stress too much from the second blast.
shouldn’t be here. We should be at home, curled up in our bed. You should be working on your tablet and pretending not to pay attention to the cheesy rom-com I’m watching. You should be yelling at me for stealing all the blankets and I should be grumbling about how you spread out over most of the bed even though you should be taking up less space. We should be falling asleep after kissing each other stupid, only to wake up to do it all again. That’s where we should be.”
Steve sent the man his best press conference smile. “Just here to help,” he said with a small salute.
Thor would never participate in their taunts. Despite everything, Loki was still his brother. That is a bond that he could never break.
Thor stood at the top of the tower, letting the wind blow softy through his hair. He closed his eyes and sighed, thinking of better times.
Tony could see the exact moment when Clint changed. Away went the broken shell of a man, only to be replaced by a hardened soldier. An Avenger. Clint pushed himself back up, his sharp eyes taking in the situation. Not even waiting for directions, Clint positioned himself over the fallen rubble. With a quick nod to Tony, the two managed to pull the piece of ceiling off of the suit. Clint shot back down to Tony’s side, looking for injuries.
“What,” Steve smiled. “You really don’t think that I would have gone looking for you anyway? The key just made it a little easier.”
Steve’s eyes softened, obviously following the same thought train, as he tugged at Tony’s chin, pulling it up enough so their lips could meet in a tender kiss. “Kansas,” Steve breathed when he finally pulled away.
Barton rolled his eyes as he made another right turn. “Do you even know anything?! I’ve been in sleeper mode for years. I was supposed to make my move with the asset in Washington but Pierce pulled me out at the last second. Good thing he did too; turns out Rogers has a way of interrupting our plans,” he said with a sneer.
He walked down the stairs to the foyer, but stopped himself. On the entrance table to the left was one of the buzzers Tony had made for him and Steve.
Tony’s fingers tightened around his mug but made no other reaction. He didn’t think he could muster up anything else. The time for anger, for tears, for desperation, had already long passed. Any and every possible scenario he could picture Steve in had already played out in his mind.
Steve rocked back on his heels and put his hands on his hips. “Because they don’t have it,” he murmured quickly, keeping his head bowed.
He couldn’t have imagined that. Bucky spun around, eyes wide. There, leaning against the garage frame, with the biggest shit eating grin known to man, was Tony Stark. Before he could even say anything a second figure was stepping around the corner, wearing a familiar mop of dishwasher blonde hair and a crooked smile.
He couldn't, not really. But the shock of an attack in broad daylight, let alone an attack had all, had Tony's hackles rising. The thought of The Captain being right and Tony brushing him off did not sit well with him. He didn't like to be wront; he was
“Shouldn’t you be,” Tony trailed off, giving the other man a once over. “I’m going to go with painting a Jackson Pollock?”
Obadiah Stane waltzed out of the closed down restaurant, harsh wind billowing past him as he scanned the street before him. A black SUV caught his eye, the man ambling over to it quickly.
People were screaming, jumping out of their cars and sprinting the over way, praying to avoid the chaotic beams. He looked down at the gauntlets in his hands. He would recognize his designs anywhere. By the powers of the blasts, Tony could only assume that he wasn’t the only one who had updated his gauntlet design.
The Captain and Stark have continued to flaunt about the city without a single care in the world. While Pierce had initially agreed with The Monger to wait on their information, Pierce found himself about two minutes from putting a bullet in the man’s head.
Maybe it wasn’t Natasha’s eyes he had to look out for. “It’s nothing, Buck,” Steve tried to placate. “Work’s been crazy, and I- ”
Sam was the first one to crack, much to Hill’s apparent dismay. “Fine,” he sighed. “You need someone to fly you there anyway. There’s no way I’m letting your punk ass anywhere near the pilot seat.” His new friend threw an arm around him, Steve breathing a sigh of relief when he felt Sam take some of his weight.
The woman walked over to the sidewalk but chuckled softly. “Oh, no need to worry, Captain. He’s quite tame!”
Steve – it was like I was a teenager again, high on every drug known to man!” He broke off suddenly, drawing himself out of the happy memory. “But I get angry a lot more. Just little things, things that wouldn’t have even fucking bugged me before but it’s all I can think about. I’m so fucking angry all the time and it makes me just want to hit something and I- ” he sighed again.
Steve knew that Tony had seen him come in, but the man hadn’t said anything for a while. He just stared out at his window overlooking Manhattan, nursing a drink.
From there, the car ride was silent, and the tension built up with each passing minute. Tony switched between drumming his fingers on the steering wheel or aggressively flipping through the radio channels, both Steve and Bucky watching him with wide eyes. Steve came close to saying something hundreds of times, but nothing ever managed to come out. There was a distinct feeling of
He wasn’t sure why he let himself hope for a miracle that he knew wasn’t coming. The machine had just barely begun to beep before Steve whispered a quick
Tony shot the man a dirty stare, but otherwise didn’t respond. Steve looked back at Fury, pondering the correct thing to say. He had to tread lightly.
“Crispy?” Tony gawked. “Steve you sent your marshmallows to the fiery pits of Hell. I mean, you aimed right for the center of the fire. If there was ever a question as to how you ended up as a mob boss, they’ve all been answered no. This just screams childhood trauma.”
The machete dropped. Steve pointedly didn’t look at Tony’s hand that was gushing blood. Their captor snorted. “And you call yourself a mob boss. You’re
Clint frowned, pressing the phone closer to his ear. Above him, the sky was a bleak gray, an ominous warning of the storms to come. “It’s getting really busy over there, isn’t it?”
Steve sighed, rubbing a hand across his face. “I’m not even going to ask why you know what this is.”
“I'm only going in case of a code green, Tony,” the man answered, almost apologetic. “You never know when you might need a doctor.”
The Captain rolled his eyes. “It was spontaneous. You were the one who told me I needed to strut; I thought you’d approve.”
Three men tore him away from his home, and into a car. After a short drive, Steve found himself in an abandoned building. The three men zip tied his hands, and threw a sack over his head. They started to attach the gold to his back, and he heard the time machine whir to life.
“The two were locked in their car; they we’re going to fall off the bridge. You saved them. The Hulk saved them.”
“And that’s why I can’t go back. Fury and his men will be searching until they find me or him. All I have if this map. There are three addresses marked on it, one of which is yours. I know he has to come here. How do you know about Loopers?”
Tony had trusted him. Steve had trusted him. His team had trusted him. And Clint had let them all down. It was a cruel reminder that Clint should never have been considered a superhero. Why he ever thought he could have been was beyond Clint.
“You’re late.” Steve almost couldn’t hear Tony as he whispered. “When you asked if I was doing anything later, I didn’t realize you’d actually forgotten. I thought it was playful banter.”
Phil chuckled. “Least I can do. But, since you don’t have to go, can you stay for a few days? I’m sure you’ve spent more hours in the car than anywhere else recently. It’ll be cramped, but Clint and I- ” he paused, looking at Clint for his approving nod, “would love for you to stay. It’s taco night, tomorrow.”
Steve huffed affectionately. “I can think of a few instances at Coney Island that ended up with my head in a trashcan.”
when Tony saw it. He barely had time to snatch it before Stane was grabbing at Tony’s throat, boot stomping on his armored hand. He felt himself gasp for air he knew he couldn’t breathe anymore. Obie grinned down at him manically, tightening his grip on Tony’s throat.
Rogers reloaded his gun, stepping into Fury’s office. He wasn’t that man anymore. He didn’t want to be.
“Okay, so all the way the down there will lead you back up some steps and to the bedrooms. Apparently the owners of the speakeasy bought the next building over just for rooms so their customers can spent the night with some of their lady friends,” Tony joked, pointing further down the hallway. “But don’t worry, they’ve all been refurnished and modernized; there’s more than enough rooms for everybody. There’s also a door that leads down another level, most likely used for beer storage. Right now, I’ve got a lab down there for weapons testing. I’m also currently finishing up a gym down there because apparently you all have a hankering for hitting things for fun.”
He jogged up the stairs to his house, fishing his keys out of his pocket. He unlocked the door and stepped in, greeted with the same musty room that met him every day. Except. Sam eyed the far corner of his den, at the window that was now open, the curtain swaying in the breeze. A window that he distinctly remembered not leaving open when he left for work this morning. His fingers itched for a gun. Instead, he crept forward to his end table, unplugging the lamp and raised in over his shoulder like a bat.
the chance that her son would end up just like her husband. She’d tried to get him to consider college, but it was a moot point. Down this far, people only went to college to get away, to escape, only to end up right back where they started. He didn’t want to end up like the rest of them, didn’t want to turn out like the ones that
Seeing Barnes was tough. It didn’t even look like the man Tony knew. He looked small, breakable. His skin was red and blotchy, burns from flames that Tony couldn’t save him from. There were cuts and bruises forming along his side, no doubt from the debris. And the missing arm? Even after finally being removed of the blood and gore that had covered it before, Tony still wanted to run to the nearest trash can.
Rumlow startled awake, his hands already clutching his side in pain. He had been lucky, how he had survived Rogers onslaught was a miracle.
“That was your agreement,” Hill hissed. “I need to get you out of here and on your way to your designated safehouse.”
You don’t belong here; we don’t even want you here. One word from me and you’ll be done for. So you better tread lightly, Stark, because I’m not one to be- ”
Bucky tried to open his eyes again, following the voice he had for so many years. “Buck, you with me?”
Bucky sighed, his remaining hand rubbing absently at his left shoulder. “He’s in deep shit, isn’t he?”
Tony nodded distantly, his brain no doubt already locking the beginnings of a solution locking into place.
“A friend gave it to me; it’s from a hospital record. Said I could use it to find the Iron Man. It’s because of this information that Iron Man decided to close our loop.”
“Buck, you heard him," Steve replied. "As soon as we leave, he’s gonna follow. He’ll do something stupid, you
Running back down those steps would be a kamikaze mission; Steve needed to keep the shooting aimed at him. Which of course would be easy. If he had any bullets left. Steve stared down at the useless gun in his hands. He could hear Hammer’s men moving around the warehouse, most likely getting ready to flank him. Their heavy steps drew closer and Steve found himself out of time, out of options. Steve looked frantically around, looking for anything that could help, when something caught his eye.
She gave a gentle sigh, the one she always gave when she knew he was lying. “It’s just, it’s been a tough couple of months for you. First there was those bodies, then you were shot, and then The Captain- ”
Nearly everyone on the crew had been met with this face – excluding Bruce of course. Tony was always so many steps in front of everyone, solving problems that the others didn’t even no existed yet.
“Yea, kid was almost useless. But hopefully his buddy at the safe house will have some more answers.”
Tony whirled around, gasping in relief as he saw Clint crawl towards him, one arm cradled against his chest, definitely broken.
Barned hummed. “Maybe. But who gives a shit now? Howard’s been dead for years and it’s like you’re still trying to impress the man.”
They’d left for Belarus immediately, following Fury’s intel to where HYDRA had been stockpiling a small arsenal. The group had been small and disorganized, clearly not expecting to be found so quickly. Unfortunately, disorder breeds chaos, and they were unable to wrangle all the insurgents before they took off to the nearby town, ready to go out with a bang.
Tony tried to stand back up, but stumbled again, this time heading right to the floor. “Tony, where the hell have you-
breathing in the familiar scent, as Steve walked over to his dresser to pull another shirt out for himself. The cotton stretched over his chest, covering remnants of love bites and red scratches, almost erasing any evidence of their previous activities.
It had been over a month since that day. Over a month since Tony died; since he failed. Over a month since Clint had been able to shut his eyes without hearing Steve’s screams.
Steve’s mind played back the memory. That had only been last week. Last week and Steve had Tony still molded against his body. Last week when the two laughed without a care in the world. Last week when there was nothing but love.
“Well, are we just going to keep doing what we’re doing right now? Because it doesn’t seem to be working,” retorted Sam.
The constant ringing in his ears was what woke him. The pain that followed, radiating all over his body, had him wishing that he was anything but conscious. A noise followed, like broken glass, but it wasn’t long until he figured out that it was him that made such a grating sound.
last time. I can’t do it again, I can’t! How long, Bucky? How long do I have to wait before it happens again? How long before I have to go home to someone’s family and tell them that they won’t be home for dinner? How many more graves will I have to dig? I have to be stronger,
Tony groaned, and stomped out the car like a petulant child, closing the door with a slam. “I can’t believe I’m doing this.”
He would do it all, and not expect a damn thing in return. A pang shot through Steve’s heart each time it happened. The paparazzi constantly harassing the team for living with a loose cannon like Tony, his past and unreliability making him out to be no better than the villains they locked away. What was worse was that Tony actually seemed to agree with them.
“Not if I have anything to say about it,” Bruce responded firmly. “Now, come on,” he continued, pushing Steve down the hall. “Let’s go get you and Peter settled.”
“No way,” Fury answered with a scoff. “I would be stupid to accept a deal like that. You haven’t given me anything useful.”
“When we were little,” Barnes started, ignoring Tony's outburst. “The Captain was… different, in a way. He wasn’t always like how he is now, you know; he used to be smaller. We didn’t have too much either, growing up. I remember we used to share shoes to save money. Hell, the poor kid had to stick newspapers in them so they could stay on.” Barnes chuckled, showing the rare and private smile that was usually preserved for those in the inner circle of The Commandos. “But he was always stubborn; he wouldn’t back down from a brick wall. He always said that ‘
Jarvis had liked it. Tony remembered that he used to go down to the lab to bring Tony some lunch, staying just to have DUM-E fetch things for him, as if he was playing with a dog.
Tony bit his lip as he watched Steve retreat into the kitchen. He knew that Steve had had a rough day. He shouldn’t have said anything about Pietro; he should have just waited. But those rough days were turning into weeks that would eventually turn into months, maybe even years.
He bit his lip, hoping that maybe he remembered that as well, but to no avail. Apparently, she wasn’t worth remembering. By the look in her intelligent eyes and her cruel smirk, it finally hit him.
“Thought you could use an office,” he heard Tony say. Steve tried to respond, feeling his mouth open and close a few times, but no words managed to come out, instead opting to explore the new room.
“Hearing aids, made by yours truly. It’s my first model, so don’t bash them too bad. If everything works correctly, and I know it will, you should have better hearing than Steve. They’re even linked directly to the comms, so you should have no problem being left out of the loop. Hope you don’t mind how small they are; I just figured you wouldn’t want everyone to know you have them.”
He didn’t wait for a response, just jogging back over to the car. Starting the engine, he barely delayed enough for Natasha to hop in besides him. He tore out of the parking lot, heading south before picking his phone back up.
Tony opened it, checking over to make sure that the laptop was still inside, disregarding the sketches it also still housed. Satisfied, Tony turned to leave back through the door when it burst open, The Captain almost falling through the door from the force with which he opened it.
“Tony, where are you?” Steve asked. He hadn’t seen the suit fly around, and it had been a while since he’d heard him chime in on their channel.
Yet again, silence engulfed Tony as he sat alone on the floor. He took another long drag of alcohol. There was just too much in his head, too much clutter, too much pain. Would it be too much to ask to just stop thinking for a while? But that was Tony’s brain; the price of having a genius mind was that it never sleeps. It’s always running, always calculating, looking for-
“I don’t think it’s that. I mean, hell, the guy may have more issues than all of us. He’s had a whole life of people using him and then leaving him out to dry; I’m pretty sure he’s just worried that we’ll do the same.”
The world around him froze as he felt himself lost control. If Rogers wanted him to be a monster, then a monster he will be.
“Nat, we just interviewed that man about HYDRA bases. We were gonna let him stew before we brought him back in. We had him on the ropes, but that isn’t an option anymore, thanks to you!”
Pierce thought he might have seen Loki pale further. "You can't kill me, Pierce. Too many people have seen me here; you won't be able to keep my murder under wraps. You've got nothing to hold me. Now, let me out before my lawyer gets here and sues you and this decrepit country for all it's worth."
Steve pushed him harder against the wall. “I don’t have time for your shit. Not after what you’ve done.”
Tony floundered, chest spasming before he was bringing his other man up, jamming one of Clint’s arrows into his sides. The man screamed in pain, immediately releasing Tony. Tony sucked in a gasp greedily, trying to push himself away. He looked and saw Obie roar, yanking the arrow out of his side. He saw Clint behind him, gauntlet on his uninjured hand.
“Stop throwing those sad puppy eyes around and I might actually believe you,” Tony quipped as he threw a blanket on top of him. “You need to relax, Cap. I’ll let you know the second the computer finds something, deal?”
“Maybe I did,” Loki snarled back. “Maybe I was curious to see if you’d actually forgotten about our little partnership. After all, you left me to fend for myself against The Captain’s mutts. I was their captive for months!”
Steve could see Tony stiffen in his chair minutely in his peripheral. How the hell could Fury know? Phil telling him was out of the question. Phil had told Tony that Fury knew what he needed to know about the situation – about Pierce. Everything else was irrelevant, and a way to protect the crew from the FBI. Knowing Phil, he’d given up anything necessary, but would leave anything incriminating about the rest of the crew out of it.
Clint smirked, already disassembling his bow. “I’d like to see that asshole be able to fire a gun after that.”
Tony snickered into his hand, flopping to lean against Steve’s chest. Sam waited for the pair to explain themselves.
When Clint told them to get ready to land, he thought it was a joke – maybe it was because Clint had joked about landing twice before, going so far as opening the ramp over the Atlantic Ocean after seeing Steve and Bucky jump to their feet.
Tony groaned. “Well, that’s just great. You owe me a new pair of shoes,” Tony snapped, jabbing a finger at the smirking Captain.
Someone stepped into the living room. Natasha. She was wearing leggings and an oversized shirt, hair tossed up in a messy bun. Everything about it was so casual, but Steve didn’t know if it actually was, or if Natasha had spent hours trying to look that way. Knowing Natasha, it was the former. She managed to look good in anything; she could probably wear the hell out of a garbage bag if she wanted.
Steve cut up some chicken, smiling when a pair of arms wrapped snuggly around his waist. He gave a soft sigh when he felt kisses against his neck as well.
Steve whipped back around to face Tony. Tony looked so small, staring off into the distance, as if lost in a dark memory.
Fury hummed, but didn’t move to continue the conversation. Steve felt his leg start to twitch as he started to get antsy. “Why are you here? Is it about the podcast?”
He felt Clint’s amused chuckles reverberate against him. “You’re telling me,” he answered. “What the hell happened?”
Steve still could not believe that he got to wake up next to Tony every morning; that he was the only one who got to. Steve looked forward to each morning when he got to watch Tony blink into consciousness, only for Tony to crinkle his nose and bury his face into Steve’s chest. It was adorable. Steve had been given a second chance; Tony’s life had been spared. Steve counted his blessings every day, and vowed to never let Tony slip away from him again.
Steve could see the man ball his hands into fists, glaring daggers at Steve. Steve’s chest tightened; it had been a long time since he had gotten a look like that. But despite how he felt, Steve knew he was right. He wouldn’t risk Tony again. The man talked big game, but Steve wasn’t going to let him go out to the field unprepared. Tony had his world, and Steve had his. Steve wasn’t about to drag Tony into the hell hole of violence and blood that Steve and his men saw. Tony wasn’t meant for it.
Steve grabbed at Tony’s shoulders as the man tried to push past his again. “You can’t come; you aren’t combat trained. Remember the last time you went out? Hammer’s men shot you.”
“Think about it,” Bucky continued. “HYDRA was always one for playing dirty. Assuming Hammer is working for them, they tell him to leave a tip that a whole new shipment of his weapons is just sitting around for the taking. We catch wind of it, unable to resist free guns, they catch us in the act and boom. We’re all dead.”
“No,” Obadiah sighed. “But Tony does. And with Stark on full retreat, I’m the only one who can get you the answer you need.”
Steve cursed. Tony and Joseph Grant were still enemies in the eyes of the public. Of course Pepper would know. And of course, without thinking, Steve had just blurted his normal alias.
“Yea, yea, all accounted for. Actually, more than all,” Tony said with a glance at Clint. “But I heard there was an explosion at base. We all good? Where’s Steve?!”
“Tony,” he breathed. The engineer just sighed, flopping back against his chair, refusing to respond. “What are you doing here?”
“Tiny hands?” Barnes asked. “Tiny hands for wh- oh, God,” he broke off, staring at Tony’s chest. “This is
“Religiously,” Fury sighed. “His devices have every podcast downloaded. Our tech guys say he’s listened to every episode, a few multiple times. They say he’s even posted on your website before, anonymously, of course. We think he may have even called in before. Congratulations, you have a fan.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes. "Seriously. You good?" His dark eyes looked all over Tony, scanning for potential injuries.
Phil smiled sheepishly and gave an awkward wave to the other two men. His hair was still adorably ruffled from sleep, swallowed in Clint’s holey shirt and worn sweatpants. “What are you doing in the closet, Phil?” Clint asked, wondering that if he knew what would happen today, if he would have just stayed in bed.
“Thanks for the assist, Gramps,” he chuckled, looking Steve up and down appreciatively. Steve felt his cheeks warming but refused to acknowledge his own embarrassment.
“Well,” he begins, “It’s all because some piece of fucking rotten horse dick was tryin’ to step to Nat.”
, Stevie baby taste it, taste it,” as she comes. There’s a rush of liquid as Toni’s cunt clenches and unclenches repeatedly; he can feel the slight flexing on his chin. Toni is immobilized, her muscles going marble hard as he suckles at her clit until she pushes on his forehead and whines, “
Tony blinks, surprised to find that the reason for his suddenly very blurry vision is not a stroke or fainting spell but
The ring is purchased and it sits in a velvet lined box in his sock drawer at the mansion all summer. Tony wants to say something, he wants to tell Steve that his heart beats for him, that he’s the only thing Tony has ever needed in the world, that he’s indescribably precious to Tony, but he can’t make himself do it. Sometimes Tony gets dizzy with how much he loves Steve, but he can’t put that pressure on Steve’s shoulders. He’s not that much older than his boyfriend but their childhoods were exceptionally different. Tony has seen the burden of loving Stark men and he doesn’t want to trap Steve when he’s going off to face a brave new world. Pepper tells him he’s being a melodramatic martyr and while she may be pretty close to right, Tony cannot will himself to propose. He wants Steve to have a reminder of Tony’s dedication to him but it isn’t necessary. He can wait. He knows that Steve is his.
“You know you don’t really act like it,” he laughs meanly, “You really don’t fucking act like it. And look, Steve, you’re cute, you’re funny, you’re fantastic in the sack, but you know all that. And you know that plenty of other men will play this game with you because of it, so if this is just
on Tony’s face, nearly giggles, but manages to control himself and carry on with dignity. He snorts elegantly, “I’d rather not visit the hospital with second degree burns all over my cock. So I guess we’re in agreement.”
Steve is silent for a moment, he takes a bite of oatmeal, then swallows and says, “So now where’s the truck?”
“I can’t stop gazing lovingly at him,” Steve whines to Sam one night. They’re sharing a bowl, for once the only two people awake in the house, and somehow Steve has managed to steer the conversation towards Tony Territory (again). Sam had rolled his eyes good naturedly and buckled in for the stoned ramblings though, so Steve considers it blanket permission to go full steam ahead.
Kissing over the twitching, pink whorl tightening around his fingers, Tony mumbles, “You’re welcome sweetheart. Put your hand back on your cock and come for daddy, hm?”
and a comfortable looking sweater and running shoes. His hair isn’t gelled either, and it’s making something uncomfortable and happy stir in the pit of Steve’s stomach. He wants to run his fingers through that stupid untamed mess and count the grey hairs he can find at Tony’s temples. They already spend so much time cuddled up together that he’s managed to count the ones in Tony’s beard, it’s only right that he get a start on his head. Steve craves the sweet relief of blunt force trauma to the head.
“Okay, what the hell is up with you?” Steve demands one evening. He’s standing shirtless in the kitchen and washing dishes. His feet are protected by a pair of pink slippers that Natasha had jokingly bought him from Forever 21. Tony—sitting at the kitchen table, typing away furiously and trying not to break into hives at how domestic they’ve become—is caught by how perfect he is. Even slightly annoyed, Steve is a sight to behold.
Dexter’s isn’t even a nice club, in fact, it kind of sucks. It’s dirty, like there’s muck caked along the floorboards and shit. It’s terribly insulated, so it probably would be freezing inside if not for the probably unlawful crush of bodies crammed into the building, and if Steve’s being honest, the bartenders aren’t very good at mixing drinks. That being said, it’s also close, cheap as hell, and always full of local talent. Most of the time, bands that are doing the who bar crawl thing are whiny and haven’t practiced enough for anyone to actually understand what they’re saying, but the bands that come through Dexter’s are always good. There’s always some punk playing, sometimes rappers too, and when Steve and Bucky had discovered the place they vowed to make it a regular hangout. Cut to ten years later and they’re still coming through all the time. As soon as they walk through the doors Steve is beelining towards the bar (Tony close behind) while Natasha leads the rest of the group to a booth.
Now Tony sucks a bruise into the thin skin behind Steve’s ear, licks wetly over the spot in apology, nips at his earlobe, and twists his hips so that Steve cries out before saying, “C’mon baby, be a good boy and tell me how good it feels. Tell me what you want me to do to you baby, tell me, I wanna know.”
Tony considers this a close call and goes about monitoring his behavior from then on out. He does go to the lab and work with Bruce, like he should be doing. Everyone there is a little shocked to see him, which means he’s definitely been shirking his responsibilities, but Tony just claims to have been busy moving. Bruce does not buy it. Tony stops offering to buy Steve a car and instead buys him a CharlieCard like a reasonable person. Steve gets a big boy job. Sarah visits the apartment. Tony goes to Amsterdam to accept an award from a bunch of stiff theoretical physics and he brings Bruce. At one point they even help Pepper move and Tony drives a big ass U-Haul all the way to D.C. They celebrate their four year anniversary in September and Bucky gets so drunk that he throws up on Sam’s boots. Things are great. Steve suspects nothing. Everything is perfectly normal.
and from how cherished he feels in this man’s hands, positively quakes and pleads, “Can I have your mouth please?
When he’s tucked into bed with the covers up to his chin, he looks at the older man and states “You’re offering to fly me to California.”
“And I gagged you on them. That’s right baby, I shoved my fingers down your throat until you couldn’t breathe. You looked so fucking pretty, did you know that? Keep talking sweetheart, you’re gonna make me come in your perfect ass,” Tony groans. Steve is close too, he’s so close and he wants to come so badly. He just needs a little more, just needs to hear Tony tell him.
“That too,” she quips and then, as quickly she’d crawled into his lap in the first place, Eve rearranges herself so that both of her thighs bracket one of his, dislodging Tony’s fingers from their new favorite place (in her panties) and giving her room to properly wrap her hand around Tony’s length and jerk him off. She gives a few dry strokes before spitting in her palm, dragging all that wetness over Tony’s cockhead and down the shaft until it’s properly lubed up.
“Good boy. Now be still for daddy,” Tony commands, and with no further preamble, slides one finger inside of Steve’s tight asshole. It burns so perfectly, the sensation of pain singing through Steve’s nerves and putting him on high alert. He cries out, quietly whining with each movement until his body accommodates the stretch. Tony has arranged them so he’s lying on his stomach between Steve’s obscenely spread legs, gazing at his hole and his full, pink balls intently. Steve wants to be embarrassed, because it is kind of embarrassing to be looked at this way, but he can’t help but revel in it. Tony is looking at the most intimate parts of him, experimenting inside of his body like Steve is something to figure out, and the pride he feels at that overwhelms any feelings of shame. Soon enough, he’s trying hard not to press himself back against Tony’s finger, and just wait for him to do more.
He whines, “Daddy,” high and mewling the way he knows Tony loves and hates, and grinds up against him harder, faster. The friction does feel great, it gets him leaking a small puddle of precome into the fabric, but Tony seems unbothered by this. Instead he’s focused solely on watching Steve’s face, taking in his bright eyes and blushing cheeks as he chases his own pleasure.
Just as Tony has run out of sweet things to daydream about—having exhausted his mind with imaginary scenarios including languid make out sessions and slow dancing in the kitchen—he hears Steve’s footsteps on the stairs. He sits up and puts on his glasses, pulls the blankets up around his waist and waits until he can see Steve’s blonde head.
“Same. I like him way better than that Bucky guy,” Sam tosses over his shoulder as he walks up the stairs.
They arrive in the bedroom and Steve doesn’t even pause to be intimidated in the sprawling space of it, instead throwing himself back onto the incredibly plush and extravagant bed and looking up at Tony with a look he knows most men who take him home fall for, hook line and sinker: “So are you gonna fuck me or what?” and as expected, Tony pretty much tears their clothes off and glues himself to Steve from that point forward.
. She can be so infuriating, seemingly so thoughtless and immature, to the point where you almost want to knock her down a peg, but that’s not who she is. Toni is loyal to a fault, so smart it makes your brain hurt, and secretly sweeter than honey if you manage to claw past her hard exterior. Steve is absolutely whipped, and he’s sure anyone that’s looking can tell.
“This was great Tones,” Rhodey tells him as they longue on the back deck. The sun is setting and Sam and Bucky are splashing around in the pool. Steve is sleeping under a towel in the chair next to Tony, his hand reached out as if looking for his boyfriend even in slumber. Tony feels drowsy with contentment.
, you know—goddamn you know just what to say,” Tony surges forward, capturing Steve’s mouth in a filthy kiss. Steve brings his hands to Tony’s hair, tangles his fingers in the sweat dampened curls and fucks his hips at the same speed as the other man, tightening his loose, soft inside so that he’s jerking Tony’s dick off with his body, just the way he knows Tony likes. “You
“So all of you live here?” she asks conversationally. Bucky turns on the TV and takes off his jacket, which she doesn’t even make an attempt to watch even though most people would. Even the most prim and proper girls in town would give Buck a second look. The loveseat groans as Bucky throws himself into it.
Tony’s apartment is in Manhattan. They go all the way to the Upper East Side in some chauffeured pretentious thing that looks like a hearse and Steve spends the entire ride without a shirt on, showing Tony all of his tattoos even though he’ll be able to get a nice close look once they arrive. Tony oohs and ahhs appropriately at their design and it almost makes Steve blush to have his fingers skittering across his collarbones and his eyes on the slope of his nose. Steve adamantly does not acknowledge these feelings and has another shot of something smooth to help ease his inhibitions.
“You must think you’re so goddamn smart huh? You must think you’re real hot shit,” Steve growls, nostrils flaring, a blush riding high on his cheeks. His jaw is clenched, like he wants to say more, wants to do more. He probably doesn’t want to be the person that flies off the handle, especially with the rest of the team watching. Steve cares a lot about what they think, about his reputation as their fearless leader. That’s okay with Tony, he has no problem taking it there at all. This is all bullshit anyway; he’s a grown ass man, he’ll do and say and go where the hell he pleases. He doesn’t need some—some fucking kid waltzing in the place trying to tell him how to live his life. The fact that he’s willing to defer to Steve in the field should be enough, but apparently that’s not the case.
The two of them spend a few hours getting acquainted with the house. Tony gives the nickel tour, surprised that he even remembers the layout considering his family hasn’t been skiing in nearly a decade, and Steve pretends to be unimpressed as usual. They shower and fall asleep on the couch in the middle of
“Hey,” Steve and Bucky both whine. Natasha rolls her eyes before focusing on the scene she’s just walked in on. The silicone bong (supposedly a myth) is still out, for one thing, there are 5 more bottles of Corona on the table, the remains of Chinese takeout and (shamefully) a newly opened pack of cigarettes. Steve expects her to read him the riot act and deliver a lecture on the fragile state of his own health but instead she throws the cigarettes at Steve and yanks the blankets off Steve and Tony and smiles.
Moshing is fun though, is something people also don’t know. The music is as loud and head achingly angry as you’d imagine, the people are those your mother warned you about, yeah yeah yeah, but the point is the energy. Standing in a crowd of people like that, people that different, who feel so much about themselves, and their lives, and the music everyone is sharing, is like a rush of golden white light through your veins. It’s like a shot of adrenaline and equilibrium all at once. You feel connected to these people, you feel like you could conquer the world with only a paper shield and a wooden sword. It’s like being invincible, moshing. You walk out of the pit with battle scars, breathing heavy and sweating like crazy but everyone’s grinning, shaking off post battle jitters together.
Pits aren’t nearly as dangerous as people think they are, especially if you know what you’re doing. On the day of the Machine Head show Steve and Bucky load up his truck with liquor and weed, but also lots of sandwiches they get from the deli down the street and a metric fuckton of water. Moshing isn’t a joke at the best of time, but it’s definitely nothing to play with in 90 degree weather. Tony watches, standing in the driveway with Sam (someone he’s deemed sane in Steve’s mess of friends) and chatting about how scared he is to die. The night before, Steve had laid next to him and regaled him with epic stories about injuries he’s sustained moshing; an elbow to the jaw, a knee to his ribs once, even the incredibly shocking Doc Marten (sans foot) to the tailbone. Tony hadn’t looked pleased about these things or particularly ready to enjoy this himself, but Steve had assured him it was going to be great.
“Upset doesn’t even begin to cover it,” Clint snapped. “And yeah,” he continued,” it would be great to see Phil, but I can’t. You want to know why? Because I’m here, doing my fucking job. A job that apparently everyone else seemed to forget about! Including you. Where the hell have you been? What a convenient time for you to run off and play spy, don’t you think?”
Loki uttered a hollow laugh, showing off a viscous smile. “Watch your tone, Captain. I don’t work for you, so I don’t
“I know, I know, I’m not supposed to tell you and you’re not supposed to tell me,” he snapped in reply. He was more than aware that a threat from Fury was not to be taken lightly. “I just, I- ”
The captor sneered at Steve. “The real name. Give it to me.” Steve looked at Tony who shook his head minutely. He made a move to respond as well, but was cut off as his head was shoved in the barrel.
Clint didn’t verbally respond, just gave a small point across the street. There, Bucky saw a man step out of the shadows, and head over to the car Steve and Stark had driven to the warehouse. Bucky watched as the man approached slowly, a hand pressed firmly at his flank, no doubt resting on a side arm.
“Because I watched this one mob beat Tony to a pulp. I watched this one mob drown him within an inch of his life. How long until one more mob turns into two? Into three? Bucky, we’ll be lucky that we last until the end of the week before the rest of New York’s criminal system comes knocking down our door demanding my blood.”
Steve had known that there was a good chance that Tony would never come to bed, but he still couldn’t help but feel upset, a small gnawing grief that sat in the pit of his stomach, that Tony chose to lick his wounds in private rather than share them with Steve. It was irrational of course – it wasn’t as if Steve had always been forthcoming with his issues. But Tony had remained by his sides anyway. And if that’s all Steve could do, that’s all he would.
Steve’s smile lessened, pulling on the hand he still had in his own, bringing his other one to encircle the wrist gently. He looked up at Tony, letting his vulnerability show. “Will you stay?”
“Don’t, Obie. Not now.” Tony went back and downed the rest of his drink. “We’ll deal with this later,” he said, clearly issuing a dismissal to Stane and Pepper.
Ignoring the sharp pain, Steve tore back at Stark, blood pumping fiercely through his veins. While Stark managed to clip him here and there, the man was no match for someone like Steve. Steve could see the man slowing down, his moves becoming sluggish as Steve tore more and more pained groans from Stark with each hit he landed.
Turning his head, he watched Tony throw a loose sweatshirt over his tank, getting his own gun ready. Steve sighed. This wasn’t going to be pretty. “What do you think you’re doing?” he asked, walking over to the other man.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard a familiar voice. “Fine, Cap. Just a graze.” Steve nodded to himself, bringing a hand to run through his hair. He stopped, however, when he felt something sticky on his fingers. Steve pulled back quickly, eyeing the red that now stained his hand.
Tony smacked at Steve’s pec. “Yes, thank you, Captain Obvious,” he replied dryly. “I wanted to wait until you were in me.”
Tony growled as he took another swig. Honestly, Tony had seen The Captain do some stupid shit over the last month, but this takes the cake.
“We’ve got NYPD officers armed and ready in these buildings,” Hill said, pointing to a few offices across the street. “They’ll swoop in on my signal, but I’m hoping that we can just sneak in quietly. This place should be emptied out.”
Tony wanted nothing more than to find his way back to his rickety speakeasy. He wanted to trip over muddy boots and discarded guns as he walked down the stairs. He wanted to wake up to the smell of Bruce’s tea or even Thor’s booming voice on his quest for Poptarts. He wanted to hear Clint’s bad jokes, Sam’s disgruntled bickering, Natasha’s quiet judgement. Hell, he’d even take Bucky tapping a forgotten melody with his metal fingers against the table. But mostly he just wanted Steve. Steve’s eyes, glowing even without any light. His smile, especially the ones he fights to keep down as he tries not to laugh at something inappropriate. His furrowed brow, making him look like a kicked puppy as he tries to maneuver Tony’s miscellaneous tech. His hands running through Tony’s hair. His feet falling into step besides Tony. His larger frame brushing against his as they passed each other in the hallway. His voice, a masterpiece of soft lullabies and crashing crescendos. He wanted Steve.
But not Barnes. How he’d snagged the title of being the most dangerous nightmare in New York’s shadows was definitely no walk in the park, but what Tony first viewed as dark and almost revolting was now only seen as convoluted, at best. It was no surprise that Tony had been wrong about Bucky’s character, but the degree he’d been off by was startling. Now, when he lays awake at night, his doubts don’t air for Steve, but for his right-hand man. Hell, Tony was so off kilter with his new investigation, he wasn’t even sure if Barnes wanted any part of this life.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?” Fury pressed. “Stark, I believe you had something to say.”
I agree,” said Steve, pulling the blankets around his shoulder closer to him. “Does anyone have a suggestion?”
“That’s when the SSR reared its ugly head. Like I mentioned before, the SSR only dealt in secrets. Secrets that everyone else would kill to know. If anyone had a problem following their rules? One quick message was all it took before they’d be dead in the gutter.”
He knew, of course, how close The Commandos were to one another. While the thought of losing Stark would burn enough, Phil knew the loss of Bucky would be much worse. He knew that Clint would have thought that losing his eyes would hurt less than losing Barnes.
Tony didn’t care what The Captain said. There was no way he was going to sit idly by while there took out HYDRA. He could handle himself, no problem. The shit storm that happened at his own warehouse should have proved that. He'd come in -
Steve Rogers was a prize crop. He knew people, he knew things. The SSR held records on probably every different mob that was running through New York, probably even other major cities. And that’s not even getting started on their connections. The SSR had people all over the country, all over the
Bucky narrowed his eyes, but refused to budge, causing Stark to chuckle. "You don't even speak, do you? I mean, I know that all dogs have different levels of intelligence, but I'm surprised you haven't made it this far in your training yet."
Sam waved her off. “No problem,” he smiled, eyes back on Ward, who was struggling to get up. “Go!” he waved her off. “I got this!”
Steve watched as Stark rolled his eyes, and turned back to the main group. Tony surveyed each of them, before locking eyes with Steve. Steve saw him freeze and take a small step back. But he recovered quickly, flashing another plastic smile. “Well, welcome home, I guess. I’ll give you the nickel tour, but then I’m out of here. I’m hoping you all will be able to entertain yourselves.”
Firemen and police were scrambling into action, trying to push frantic citizens farther from the bomb site.
“We’ll have to worry about that later,” Tony sighed, redialing Pepper’s phone number. “Stane needs to be stopped, now. Head to SI’s office. No way Stane wouldn’t stop by and immediately try his new toys with my reactor.”
She knew why Sam had gone with her; she wasn’t stupid, and James sure as hell wasn’t sneaky. Part of her was frustrated, finding herself in a situation she was all too familiar with. Ever since she was a little girl, he had made a vow to herself to be strong on her own, never having to resort to lean on a man.
Loki waited until he heard the thuds of Thor’s steps as he stomped up the stairs. Once silence encased him again, he reached out, ignoring the food, and grabbed the knife. Not wasting any time, he followed the chain that connected to his ankle, the very chain that ensured his capture for weeks, all the way back to the wall. During the day, he throws his pillow up against it so they can’t see the progress he’s made. The chain had been bolted to the wall, and with such limited options, Loki has been forced to chink away at the old stone behind the blots in order to even dream of escaping. It was all too easy to get his hands on the knife. While usually one of The Captain’s goons sat and watched him eat, whenever Thor would be sent down, Loki just bit out a few cutting remarks to have the man and his damaged ego running for the hills.
Bucky snorted, rolling his eyes. “Pigs will fly before the day comes that you actually listen to what you’re supposed to do. Now, stop being an ass, and tell me what I need to do.”
Just like he wouldn’t forget seeing Phil standing on his porch that night with a bundle of wildflowers in his hands.
“Well, I didn’t exactly know about you! Besides, I don’t actually work for your boss. I just scratch his back and he scratches mine.”
As soldiers, we’ve never been blind to violence, and its lasting effects. But sometimes, being faced with it at home is a tough pill to swallow. So, I would just like to take a moment to thank the police force that is working tirelessly around the clock to find answers. And to the families of those who have suffered loss, know that everyone here on this podcast, as well as
Tony shook his head, aiming to respond when, “Tony?” Steve’s voiced carried from down the hall, much closer this time. “Tony, where the hell are you?”
He put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “Stark will find something. We’ll have a break through, and then we’ll get the job done. Just like we always do. And besides, it wouldn’t be fun if it wasn’t a challenge, would it?”
Tony huffed out a laugh, dragging Steve's mouth to his. Oh, how Tony could write odes to that man's lips. How despite that they belonged to a hardened shell of a man, the lips always remained soft and smooth, always inviting. Tony sighed, trying to push deeper when Steve pulled away, Tony giving a small noise of disapproval.
“Or,” Fury continued. “Worst case scenario, he leaves everything as is, but whenever HYDRA is mentioned, he cuts some names, and pastes yours instead. With all of the shit that HYDRA has put this city through, it would be more than enough for the boys in blue to look the other way and shoot on sight. Forget the luxury of prison.”
When he had finally gotten over walking every step of his new apartment, taking in everything, Steve had crawled into bed. Tony had managed to surprise Steve again. Instead of the fluffy marshmallow Steve thought he would get sucked into, Steve was met with a surprisingly firm bed. It molded with each part of his body, the soft sheets like butter over his skin. Steve was out in minutes.
Clint hesitated briefly over the door handle but shook his doubts away. Tony and Steve were family. They’d risked everything to come check up on him. He wasn’t exactly going to lie to them. Besides, the fact that they were here cemented the same reasoning that they couldn’t get mad at him.
I deal with two things: information and tech. Up until now, you’ve managed to get both just fine without me. But something’s changed, hasn’t it? Something’s different now; you can’t handle it, and now you’ve had to come all this way because you need
Tony looked around the room again, giving a soft chuckle. “This is ridiculous,” he whispered to himself, bringing his hands around to his front, throwing the now useless rope in between the men’s feet. “You gotta learn how to tie better knots,” he said, smirking at The Captain.
Clint all but collapsed at the sound of that voice. A voice that he thought he would never hear again. Clint almost cried.
There was no one without the other. The Captain’s dynamic duo; one to draw the prey out while the other waits patiently to slit their throat in a dark corner. If Barton’s hiding somewhere up above, Tony knew there was only a matter of time before Barnes had him pinned. For all Tony knew, the brunette was probably in this alleyway with him right now.
“You look ridiculous,” Steve answered instead, arms crossing as Clint hid the club under the apron, giggling madly.
Steve shrugged, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck. “I didn’t think that far ahead,” he admitted.
Sam cleared his throat. “I didn’t realize you knew I was in here. You’ve just been staring at a wall for like ten minutes.”
“Then what is the point, Tony!” Steve roared. “Or are you just gonna stand there and list off all the things I’m doing wrong?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Barnes drawled. And oh look, turns out The Captain’s best friend just oozed the same amount of charm and power in military dress. Well as much as one could with one arm.
Riley’s father’s foundation didn’t last the week. He could still remember the news that night, watching as the police tore the man away from his residence, his face red from screaming, and into the back seat of a cop car. The rush of grim satisfaction lasted only momentarily.
Ignoring his lingering drowsiness, Bucky hopped out of bed and padded over to the bathroom, the cool tiles a small reprieve against his feet. He ambled straight over to the mirror and glared at his own reflection, hoping it would magically spill all the answers he was looking for. His hair brushed over his shoulders.
Stane shrugged. “It took me half a day to pry his name out of him. Because I have the one thing you never have: leverage.”
“These people I’m running with; they’re not HYDRA. Well, I think some of us are, but not everyone. It’s a separate strike group. We’re called Brimstone.”
It had been absolutely horrible. What was worse, was that he still didn’t understand why they wouldn’t take the movies, until the priest pulled him aside and
It still wasn’t enough, but it was a hell of a lot better than indefinite. And that was enough for him to work with. Besides, he had a feeling it was going to be a lot easier to get through the day, his new phone a comforting weight in his pocket. He pulled away and the first time in a long time, felt cold.
Steve roared, surging up to wrap his arms around Tony, securing him in his waist. Tony’s own wrapped around the back of Steve’s neck, holding on for dear life. He pushed down as hard as he could, meeting Steve’s desperation. The wildfire in him was burning, out of control, and Tony just took it, letting his body be covered in flames.
Steve anxiously started to follow the small trail of blood leading down to the fire escape stairs. Tony was still out there. And Steve needed to find him.
Clint shot his friend a jaunty salute, before tearing up the stairs, his fingers dancing across the phone’s screen.
Not even attempting to try and get the cat himself, Steve turned the tree parallel to the ground, shaking it softly as the owner reached her hands out for the cat. Gun shots echoed through the square, as the criminal’s car swung into view, the cops not far behind. Steve snapped his attention back to the cat, shaking harder.
“Do we?” he asked, teeth clenched together. “I got you a gift, and you hate it. I’ll just return it! Happens with couples all the time.”
“I couldn’t finish anything,” Tony shrugged. “I had so many things buzzing around in my head, I couldn’t finish one before I found myself starting on the next. It’s just,
Tony sat in the empty lab, twirling a screwdriver between his fingers. A Doombot lay in front of him; no doubt left by Fury, hoping Tony could crack open a few secrets. But Tony couldn’t get his mind to focus. He sighed, dropping the screwdriver on top of the mess in front of him, pushing away from his chair to look at the clock.
Since he obviously couldn't cooperate with Stark by telling him what he wanted to hear, he'd have to settle for leading him on, goading him to agreeing with the inevitability of HYDRA.
Steve nodded, remembering the information Tony had shared with the group when they originally started tracking down the rest of The Killian’s experiments. The Avengers had seen a lot of things, but watching the patients try and contain that power – and watching them fail – had been gruesome. Even Bruce had commented that it looked exponentially worse than hulking out.
The doctor had a solemn expression on his face.There was a painstaking silence in the room as if all the air had been sucked out of the room and for maybe just a minute everyone wanted to just stop, stop and just breathe only if they could draw a normal breath.
Tony realized there were some memories at the back of his mind, knocking on some metaphorical door wanting, waiting to be let out. But Tony didn’t want to let these memories out he didn’t want to think about them. He was here with Jarvis he just wanted to stay here forever.
He dreams a lot these days. He goes from a dreamless state to a dream and then back to the dreamless state. He thinks he is floating in an abyss.
It takes him three days to find out where the rest of the avengers are, he sets up a call with King Panther and arranges for BARF with Steve to reach Wakanda.
There was a sharp intake of breath behind him, Jarvis knew what Tony was thinking at this exact moment, realizing why he was here, what was going on.
Tony smiled as if he had years of pain, disappointment , agony, melancholy hidden behind it as if he even let it out once he would break, fearing he had reached a point where he couldn’t put himself back together.
Betrayal that words was all too familiar, he had stumbled across the word, felt it, lived it, resented it and then had tried to forget it. But forgetting was never easy for Tony.
“Then what? What after you see him, see what you have done to him? Then will you leave him again, run back, play fugitives again.”
He wanted to be happy so happy, he wanted to tell everybody , shout it off the top of the empire state building and tell it to anybody who would listen that he was going to have a baby. A baby , his baby.
They had been thru so much together, always been each other’s rock. Steve had been there when Tony’s parents had passed, when Stark Industry had gone under because of Obadiah Stane, had been there when Tony had pacemaker installed ih his heart. Tony had been there when Steve’s ma ha passed, when he had been a traumatizing plane crash, had been there when he had returned from the army, had been there when he opened his first art gallery, had been with him thru all those nights where his dreams got too overwhelming and he couldn’t go back to sleep.
In this exact moment James Rhodes realised he was living his worst nightmare. All these years, all he had wanted was to keep Tony safe. He had taken a look at the too smart for his own good omega and had decided that he had to be there with him to prevent his smart mouth from getting his ass whopped because for all Tony knew he didn’t know how to keep his mouth shut.
“I don’t know! Oh my god! I don’t know Vision contacted me when he got an emergency signal from Friday. He contacted me around midnight that he was going to get
“Mr. Stark, thank god you are okay, I was…I was a little worried sir but thank god…thank god you are okay. I saw your picture…it worried me a little , I thought …I thought but happy was here, he told me not to worry but I was a little scared…a little scared…
The hospital staff had given them Tony’s stuff his blood stained shirt, his trousers, his wedding ring, his broken in half dog-tags. All of them had been collected by pepper.
He doesn’t stop loving him, he thinks maybe he will never stop loving him, he remembers when his love was all hot burning and needy, now he thinks his love comes with a side of pity and a whole lot of regret.
Rhodey was on his bed on Tony’s left side. It was cruel because in all of the scenarios he had imagined him and tony always side by side this was not one of them, never one of them. Vision was sitting on the sofa at the further corner of the room trying to still grasp the situation, still blaming himself for rhodey’s legs and now for Tony’s state. The spiderkid had called happy a lot of times trying to know how Tony was, happy would go out of the room every time to talk to him and console him and reassure him that everything was fine.
The main difficulty was not getting back into America, the main difficulty was getting inside the heavily guarded compound.
Pepper was sitting on the stool beside Tony’s bed, She didn’t know when was the last time he had slept like this, what irked was that even when tony was unconscious lying on the hospital bed he didn’t look peaceful. She didn’t know if the ever present crescent shaped dark circle underlying his eyes were trying to tell her something or just spoke about the sorry state of their wearer. Tony’s lips were pale, they were never pale, he always had a pink hue to them, he would always be licking his lips, god forbid that man would ever get up and use a chapstick. Seeing the paleness of his lips, the dryness made her uneasy, it made her want to apply chapstick to those lips but she didn’t understand what it signified more her utter helplessness, helplessness of the entire situation or that tony still didn’t wanna get up.
Tony is bracing himself, he just wants to get this over with, he feels that even if  spends a few more minutes here the coldness is going to engulf him forever, the music is still playing in the background and he doesn’t have the heart to turn it off.
Tears were flowing freely from his eyes, Nat gripped his hair, he noticed she was standing , he pressed his face too her stomach and she gripped his face. Tears were still flowing from his face, his brain couldn’t comprehend what was happening.
He thought of Steve, poor Steve who would be sitting cross legged in the dark trying to fix the wiring but not being able to understand neither  heads nor tails about it while placating an extremely apologetic DUM-E.
Loving Steve was like flowing with the current of a river and being loved by Steve was like touching the stars.
She just takes his hand and puts a file in his hand “I won’t stop you Steve, you deserve to see your handiwork, he still hasn’t gotten up but before you see him read his file.” said Pepper.
Did I hit my head. I definitely would have to hit my head hard if I am dreaming all of this, sitting here trying to talk to you.” replied Tony.
Tony has a bandage on his left palm, his skin is wrinkled as if it folded in itself. It stings a lot, he is also only six years old and doesn’t understand why his daddy was so angry.
He walked around and sat on the tool which he would so desperately try to climb when he was a child and would refuse help from anybody until he did it on his own .
He can’t meet Steve, not right now but he has to do it, he has to deal with the problem dropped in his lap again and that makes him want to laugh.
Tony doesn’t know where that came from, he had never wanted kids but after bonding with Steve, he had felt as if it could be a possibility but in a very very far away future with Steve by his side. He…he doesn’t know..he…
He doesn’t care that Steve waits for him, he doesn’t care Steve is outside his room, he doesn’t care that he always disappears when Tony goes out for his therapy or exercises or he is not there when doctors come to check up on him, doesn’t care that now he is obeying his wishes and that he is moping all around the compound, doesn’t care that he is making a lot of people ansty.
Steve takes a step towards him. In the next moment there is a red and gold gauntlet encasing itself around Tony’s right hand and the repulsors start to charge up
As he neared Tony’s room he could hear the steady beep inside, if he could focus enough he could also hear the sound of his shield hitting Tony’s arc reactor again and again.
Tony laughs, Jarvis is trying to wrangle Bernard back into a cage. Tony likes Bernard, he is pretty. Tony is lying with his head on his mother’s lap, she is swiftly combing his hair.
“I am just reminding you that you always were strong Tony, you were like the sun always shining, you were always moving forward as if you personally despised giving up. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong in wanting to stop once in a while, to rest. to want to restart, but you, you always wanted to go on, move forward just wanted to take anything make it better, live life and move on. You always were like a wind whirl nothing could stop you” said Jarvis
Sun light was coming from the northeast window falling directly on his face, he blinked once then twice trying to make out where he was standing.
“Tony it would be an understatement to say that I love you, my day begins with you and ends with you, the days that I don’t see your face first thing in the morning seems like a waste to me, the day I married you I had made a promise  to make you the happiest man on earth, to always take care of you, to always support you, to love you and always be there for you,  you gave me a home when I was not sure of my place in the world, you gave me purpose when I thought I had little to offer to this world and you filled my world with colours when I could only see  it in grey and white. Tony today also my eyes look for you every time I enter a room and you are still the most handsome man I have ever met and you brighten up my world when you smile, so here I am standing today in front of you still the same man with whom you feel in love,  12 years after the first time I asked you to marry me  asking you again, Tony would you make me the happiest man again, will you  renew our wedding vows with me?”
He ran his eyes thru the condo and there were candles everywhere, every surface, every nook and corner covered in candles along with stargazer’s lilies, Tony’s favorite flowers.
This was difficult to write. I wrote and then re-wrote it several times, i do hope you guys like it!
Steve was a bullhead, his husband knew the fact, had called him out on it, but at the end his husband was the one who was also paying a price for it.
Tony wonders how Steve does it, how he fights, doesn’t let go, he wants to know, how he jumps from one thing to another ,he wants to know the secret how is he standing in front of Tony all broken and bent but still ready to fight. His optimism it perplexes Tony’s brain.
“I don’t think I had the answer to that when you were fourteen year old , I don’t think I have the answer to it today.”
Someday somebody is going to write a poem about a man who had a broken heart since birth and he lost all the love he found.
Rhodey had flown a lot of missions in his life before or after War Machine, he had come across a lot of adverse situations and dealt with them skilfully and always made peace with the outcome. He had very early on in his career made peace with the fact that what he did was very dangerous and someday something was going to go wrong and he had prepared himself for the outcome of those situations as well.
“Common Pepper, we always knew something like this could happen, it is going to be okay. You’ll see I know it is just going to be a minor seatback and we’ll find a way out of this too. We already went through this yesterday, it is going to be okay ” rhodey tried to console Pepper
They pulled apart and Steve slid the ring on Tony’s finger. He looked into Tony’s eye and found it reflecting his own happiness, a single tear slid down from Tony’s eyes and Steve wanted to chase it away so he he kissed it.
Frostbite, multiple broken ribs, punctured lungs heavy concussion, but what was surprising out of all of this was that Tony was pregnant.
“Mr. Stark would have been helped more if his alpha was close by, it is often found that omegas always heal better when there alphas are close by, specially pregnant omegas who like to have their mates close by.” said Dr. Harris
Next time Tony dreams he is with Maria at the beach and she is looking beautiful with her sun kissed face and her hair in the wind and a carefree smile on her face.
If anybody would ask him Rhodey would tell him that out of all the mission he went for, all the jobs he had undertaken he was most dedicated to the job of being the best friend of one idiot Anthony Edward Stark, not that he would ever describe it as a job, he would probably describe it as looking after looking after a adamant hyper-active child but he did it because he loved him, not that Tony would listen to him( Honeybear, you are getting sappy in your old age)
Tony feels very tired, he wants to rest for the first time in his life he wants to rest, not do anything anymore, just maybe sleep for a little while , yeah that sounds good sleep, that sounds good.
Pepper was walking down the corridor with Jim at her side in his wheelchair, she wasn’t sure she was every going to get used to seeing the man in a wheelchair. All her life she had known Rhodey, she knew him as a proud hardworking beta, he had dedicated his life to the US military, being a liaison to Stark Industries and then to War Machine, there was a certain cruelty to how he was being rewarded for all his hardships.
Tony wants to move he wants to sock Steve in his perfect face but he still has a iv in and for the very first time in his life he doesn’t move cause of his child.
As he neared Tony’s bed he felt like he shouldn’t be here, that he had done enough damage that he shouldn’t touch Tony again lest he burns.
He feels the burden of all these years wearing him down, he sees the cracks formed overtime, his faith, hope, optimism, love all broken.
Tony feels so betrayed, his whole being battered, betrayed and beaten down, his husband had kept a secret, a secret which Tony had every right to know, he had laid beside him promised to love him and then kept all of this a secret, had chosen his best friend  over his own husband and that stung, it stung Tony a lot.
“Then you come with me, but I don’t think that is what you want. Do you wish for all of this to stop , for your heart to stop hurting, for you to stop feeling drained all of them, yes you want all of that but I don’t think you want to stop.” said Jarvis
Tony felt butterflies in his stomach, it was magnificent,  he couldn’t  comprehend how after two years of dating and ten years of marriage Steve still managed to sweep Tony off of his feet.
Tony laughs, he laughs because he doesn’t think that he is capable of hurting Steve even right now. Tony laughs and Steve looks up and Tony can see that Steve’s scared and that his baby blues have a haunted look.
Steve grinned, he has always wanted to do that,  he wanted to give Tony everything in this world, Tony deserved the entire world.
He is employing his old tactic of ignoring everything until it blows up in his face well in this case blows up again.
Afghanistan had eaten at Rhodes’s soul for three months where he had blamed himself for losing tony, for letting him go in the other van, for not protecting him, Siberia was going to eat him away for the rest of his life.
“Today in the latest new as leaked pictures of Tony Stark in a comatose flood the internet, several questions are raised, what happened to the public favorite iron-man? Is this why there has been no words on the accords, on the state of the avengers, is this why Tony Stark has been away from the public eye? And most importantly what happened to the land New York city’s favorite omega in this state?”
He was dragging his body and his mind was holding a court of its own where Steve had already been convicted of the most heinous crime possible, the crime of hurting the love of his life.
Pepper wanted to scream, cry shake Tony, beg cry plead tony to get up, just get up. She wanted to share the happiness with Tony about finally getting his pup, indulge him , listen to him ramble about his pregnancy pains, about the baby, about how overprotective Steve was getting, how he was going to get fat and everything. She just wanted him to get up.
Tony was lying on the bed, surrounded by the machine, beeping and making sounds, informing the passer-by that the person in the room was alive, breathing whether conscious or not but he was alive and breathing. He was able to breath own his own, small mercies.
It irks Tony to see Steve standing there, his hair as golden as corn , curled on in himself trying to make himself small. He always occupies so much space, his whole demeanour  demanding attention and here he is standing trying to look so small, it is wrong and it bothers him
Pepper repressed a wince then then plastered a smile and said “We will try our best. Thank you, Doctor.”
Dr.Harris ,a beta, was a man of medium stature, he war wearing round glasses and his face was overcome with the hardships of the years. He had both his hands on the table as he was giving news to yet another family, with practised professionalism and air of distance. Distance between the doctor and the patient, between the emotions of the family and the responsibility of a doctor.
When Tony got up around at midnight and stared at ring and then his husband how was basking in the heat from the fireplace and had an ethereal post orgasm glow a few tears escaped from his eyes, he kissed the forehead of his husband and went back to sleep in his arms, warm and safe.
After a year Steve had been the one to approach Tony first, he was the one who had asked him out on a date first, Tony had been too busy wallowing in his self-loathing and doubting himself but Steve had broken down all those walls he had built around him one at a time and then Tony had fallen in love with Steve, one by one and then once in for all, it was as simple as that.
“I think this time you have been hurt too deep and one time too many. I think instead of crying and screaming you have gone numb, numb from the pain, numb from the betrayal.” Said Jarvis
Tony who is his husband, his mate who was right in his anger but who was so angry that he couldn’t see that it was not Bucky. Steve couldn’t blame Tony a secret like that would have carved a hole in his soul too, but in those moments he couldn’t see right from wrong. But right now he wanted to see Tony, he needed to see him, the need to see his mate was so deep within him as if it had been calling at him for eons. Last he had seen Tony was when he had broken his husbands arc reactor and left him behind, the betrayal on his face was something that was etched into the fresh batch of his nightmares. Then he had completely gone numb on seeing Tony’s picture in the hospital bed, taken from an angle that spoke of treachery.
“Coming to me has always been an option, I may not be there but I also never left you Anthony.” said Jarvis
“Goddamit Steve you look at me if you wanna talk to me” Tony demands, Steve is still not looking at him and Tony’s inside are boiling, he burns, he burns with white hot rage, , he wants to know, he needs to know, his desire to know shines bright like the sun on a clear day eclipsing all his other needs. He needs Steve to look at him, to tell him, answer him.
Six month later on the  second of june they renewed their vows, both of them in the same suits they wore all those years ago. They renewed their vows in the backyard of their Malibu mansion with  Tony in his white suit and Steve in his black tuxedo, they renewed their vows in front of their friends turned family and promised to keep loving and cherishing each other for all eternity to come.
It’s been three days since he opened his eyes, three days of hospital hell and Tony wants to get out already.
“I am also going to get you out of the wheelchair as soon as I am out of here. No actually get my tab in here and we can start right away.”
The doctors have already informed that it is going to be tough, his reduced lung capacity, his recent surgery, all these years as ironman, his already weakened heart and his age everything is going to make his pregnancy very difficult but tony thinks he can do this, fight be there for his kid.
Steve is looking at him as if Tony had taken a bat to everything he loves. He looks at Tony with so much sorrow, pain and hurt that Tony doesn’t know what to do. Tony has gone numb inside and he doesn’t have the energy and he is so tired
Tony always wore the rings on his left hand, no matter how rich they got or where he was, Steve was going to be a part of him, it was a testimony of their love, their hardships, the world that they had built together. He had promised  himself to Steve  till the end of his days and he intended to carry his promise till his last breath. He loved Steve with his whole heart, he looked down at Steve, he was kneeling in front of him, with his aww shucks smile and sparkle in his eyes, in his hand a ring with a  single cushion cut diamond on a platinum ring  promising of a life time yet to come.
Behind them vision was listening to everything with a certain naivety that looked so like Tony’s that it crushed rhodey’s heart. Happy was standing behind him as if he could he would block all the pain from tony just keep him safe for once in his life.
“I don’t think you did a bad job, you trusted and you loved with your whole heart, if you ask me you did a good job, your choice was to trust it was someone else’s choice to break it.” said Jarvis
Tony’s chest was heavily bandaged, it felt like there was a little skin left which was not covered in bandages. He had IV’s running from both his hand, he also had a nasal feeding tube. Steve felt like somebody had poured cold water all over his body and then refused him warm clothes.
I need to go, to I don’t know what Steve but at this moment I want to be anywhere but here, be with anyone but you.”
He wanted to bang, break something, why was it happening to him, why can’t for once in his life he catch a break, he just …he just wants….he just wants his baby to be safe. His baby who isn’t even born yet, who is already caught between all this, his tiny little baby.
“Oh my dear boy I am not asking you to hold on to it but I guess all I am saying is you can love someone, care for them, forgive them and not want to meet them again and I think that’s okay.
The vent was making some noise as if a paper was stuck inside, the blades of the air conditioner were swinging from left to right and then from right to left.
It had been a disaster, Steve had judged Tony right of the bat and Tony didn’t help the case by being an asshole. He was dating Ty at the time but he had been enamored by Steve since day one, big strong Steve who would stand up to bullies and who would never back down from a fight and never cared for Tony’s status and always called him out on his dumbassery. When Tony had inevitably and very publicly broken up with Ty Steve had been his shoulder to cry on, he had placated him, picked him up, held Tony when he stumbled, listened to all his drunk ramblings and helped him glue all his pieces back.
Tony looked up to him, how did he know? Tony thought, nothing was making sense, what was he doing here? Didn’t he have a fight! that would explain the bandages but he said he fought with someone important, but then what was he doing here, What was he doing here in his childhood home? What was Jarvis doing here? Wait did Jarvis just say that he was in a hospital refusing to wake up.
When he turned around there a tear rolling down Tony’s check, “You always loved him Tony, a love like that isn’t easily forgotten, but maybe you don’t have to forget it. When you truly love somebody you never stop Tony, nor do you truly let go, you get angry, you hurt but never let go.”
If rhodey had ever lost composure in his life it would be the exact moment he saw Steve Rogers barrel his shield towards his own mate. He had wanted to rip the doors off their hinges, kill Steve rogers and wake his best friend up.
Steve took a step out of the washroom and towards Tony’s room, his legs were cold, they felt like jelly, his hands were shivering, he was pretty sure it was hot outside.
“You were never very good with matters of the heart, you always told me that you couldn’t understand it because there was no equation behind it, no math , no logic, no science. I think you were just trying to protect what was broken ruthlessly.
Steve is a moron and sooner or later someone was going to find out and then they both were going to land in trouble so he needs to get him away from here, get him somewhere probably safe, whatever he doesn’t care.
“I am going to shift to his room, he doesn’t leave my sight for a second, not even for a second after this.” said Rhodey.
“Jim… jim I am sorry, so sorry, but its Tony he…,he was…. Vision just brought Tony in from Siberia, he was rushed into emergency surgery he….he jim he was, oh my god! he looked horrible.” stammered Pepper
Tony got up and walked towards Jarvis , he hugged him as if his life depended on him, as if he was getting hugged after ages, as if he hugged him tightly enough he would make him stay forever.
There is a weight at the back of his neck because for the life of him Steve can’t lift his head up and look at Tony can’t see the face that was always so full of emotions devoid of life. Tony always used to look at him with so much love, so much love that Steve’s heart would burst with happiness. But right now he can’t….can’t look at Tony.
“Oh! Definitely my child I think you have had enough of heartbreak, but that never stopped you did it? You always were so carefree with your heart, your love. Like I said you would fall down and then you would always get up. Similarly you would feel your heartbreak, then put your heart back and give your love unconditionally to whoever asked next. I always admired your resilience.” said Jarvis.
He feels a chill settle in his bones, he wants nothing more than to be warm , he just wants to go somewhere warm somewhere safe, somewhere he can never be cold again.
Tony loved Steve with all his might and then some more, he was convinced that Steve was was the good and pure thing in his life that he wont be able taint or destroy, because the blonde had planted himself in tony's life like a flower growing thru the cracks in concrete and refused to leave. Iron man and Captain America's romance was a whirl wind, it was too fast and all too encompassing. All his life Tony had held himself responsible for something or the other and hated himself but he loved Steve so much, he loved him so much he forgot what hating himself felt like.Tony had served his heart and trust to Steve on a silver platter and at the end Steve had left a vibranium shield shaped dent in it.
There was a balloon arch behind Steve over the fireplace and he knew Steve had made that because Steve was a dork who would hundred percent do something like that.
There was a heavy weight in his head, it wasn’t letting him think. There was only one words swimming in his head pregnancy, he had hurt his mate, his unborn child. He was wrong, he had committed a crime, he was bad, bad so bad had hurt tony had hurt his kid, his unborn kid. He had hurt them, hurt tony , left him, left him in the cold, broken his reactor, oh my god he had hit tony, had physically hurt him, what if , what if he had hurt his kid, no no, no he shouldn’t have done this, this was bad, his mate was hurting his kid, no god his pup, their mother was hurt because of him, he had hurt his pup ,almost killed, no, steve wanted to vomit, he retched , he wanted , he wanted to …… he couldn’t but he wanted......
If pepper was running the show then that was the best he could hope for. He had heard about Tony being injured ,all of  Natasha’s little spies had just informed them that Tony was severely injured but the cause was unknown, not that it mattered to Steve because he knew the answer pretty up-close.
Jarvis would have fought anybody who said Tony wasn’t his son, maybe he wasn’t his biological son but he was not going to disrespect their relationship like that. Since the moment that little bundle was placed in his arms Tony has become his and Ana’s whole world.
“No you need to listen, I don’t need you anymore, don’t want you anymore, you are nothing to me. I want you to leave, I want….. I want you to never come back, go away Steve please just turn around and go and please don’t come back, for the love of god Steve I beg you don’t make me go through it again. There are tears flowing down his face, he can’t make out from where they are coming but he is not being able to stop also.
Tony can see his bullhead of an husband standing there with determination with fight in his eyes, his whole body rigid, rooted in one spot, ready, ready to do anything, ready to not let go.
“That is the one thing I have failed to do, telling you what to do always felt so wrong, you were always so smart, so thoughtful, so free as if not meant for this world yet so resound so grounded you felt everything in your soul, watching you carve your own path was always like watching somebody create art, so beautiful, so gorgeous that sometimes I felt as if I was not worthy of looking at it.” Said Jarvis
Tony wants Steve to look up, look at Tony, see him, see what he did, he wants to be cruel to Steve, he wants to be quick and sharp and cruel and he thinks he wants to punch and kick and scream and hurt and he just wants Steve to look up.
Steve sighed. Sharon had managed to give him scraps of information given that she herself had to lay low for  sometime.
“He has to be monitored constantly, it will help that all his doctors will be there with him. I will stay in touch with his team and will be available whenever required.” said Dr.Harris
Steve sat on the stool beside Tony’s bed and tried to clutch the omega’s hand but Tony’s hand remained unresponsive. There was low groan that came somewhere from his stomach and left his mouth. There was soft music playing over the speakers. He stroked Tony’s hair and silently begged the omega to wake up.
His head is on her shoulders now, she is holding him him and he feels like he is going to breakdown in her arms, her arms which has always been a safe place for Tony, a place he associates with warmth and love.”
Once he had realized how fundamentally fucked up that was and that his father was the one who was not good enough he had taken those papers and lit them up with his father’s blowtorch.
“Yes Tony, yes a baby, we are going to be there Tony, every step of the way, you are going to have a baby.”
There was a moment, a brief moment where Tony had thought that he could be happy, even if fucked up sometime he could be happy, he would get to have this family this people his husband and finally the universe wouldn’t begrudge him and give him a chance, a real shot at happiness but now it all lay crumbled at his feet.
A chocked sob escaped him, he finally lets go, hot water spring from his eyes, he was on his knees, he was clutching Nat’s jacket with utter desperation, if he could just clutch it had hard enough maybe  he could make things right.
“Nat I can’t, please Nat I can’t. I cant do it, I , god Nat what did I do? He should hate me, hate me for doing this. He will hate me for doing this to him and our child. Nat he doesn’t deserve this, he doesn’t deserve me, he deserves someone so much better. Nat he deserves so so much better. I don’t know what to do!”
Tony entered the house and there was Steve standing amidst the sea of a thousand candles looking every bit of the word dashing.
Pepper lifted her hand and for once he thought she was going to slap him across his face, he deserves it he knows that but he still winces, recoils but the slap never comes.
He couldn’t believe after all that they went thru Steve was here, with him asking to marry him once again. He felt his heart go into overdrive and his brain trying  to catch up with what was happening. Two hours ago he was stuck in traffic bitching about being angry and now here he was standing in front of his husband trying to fold all his happiness and keep it close to his heart forever.
Pepper had tried to console him, tell him he couldn’t have done anything, that he was not responsible for this, that this blame was not his, it was none other than Steve Roger’s, she had been very stern about it.
Natasha had just gotten up, she had just joined Steve, Sam and Wanda two days ago. Scott and Clint had stayed back in Wakanda to manage a plea deal and get back to the states. She was just about to get up and brush her teeth, she found a dumbfound Steve who had just finished his morning routine standing in front of the TV watching a news channel-
He dreams about his mama. She is wearing a yellow silk dress with white heels and white earrings too. Her hair falls on her shoulder and her freckles glow under the sun. They are sitting in Stark mansion’s backyard. It’s late in the afternoon, the sun little over the horizon, there a gentle summer breeze going around and the backyard is warm with the sun’s rays.
When he catches Pepper looking at him he smiles, he always smiles. She tells him that it’s okay to grieve, that he is allowed to grieve. Tony is not very sure about the allowed part , it’s a funny word allowed, he thinks he has had his fill of allowed, as if he hasn’t had to carve his way, claw his way to what he wants, as if he hasn’t fought tooth and nail to achieve where he is today, as if he was ever “allowed” anything, he hasn’t been allowed anything, he wasn’t “allowed” any sort of emotion, wasn’t allowed to feel, wasn’t....wasn’t allowed anything since he was a kid, his grasp over emotions is very recent which he again feels slipping from between his fingers.
Steve walked in silence looking for the room, he walked as if he had been very recently defeated,  he walked as if he was unsure of himself, he was weary anxious and so tired. There was a little tremor in his walk implying a certain sense of doom, his body itched with the need to be with his husband, he wanted to jump out of his own skin if that could settle the brain noise. He was waiting for the energy to leave his body or his soul to be finally disgusted and leave the treacherous body that embodied it.
He wanted to tell Tony that his family was here, that he, pepper, happy and vision were here, that they will be here to handle him, handle his broken heart give him all the support that he needed. He wanted to tell the brunet that he just needed to wake up, everything else would be fine.They would solve everything, he would be there with tony every step of the way as he was sure tony would be there with him.
