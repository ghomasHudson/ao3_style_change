Steve gave a one-sided shrug.  “Sometimes.  I don’t like it outside of this though.” another glance at the bedroom door made his meaning plain.  “I mean, when strangers or acquaintances won’t use my proper name it bothers me.  Had my fill of cute names when I was a kid, you know?”
“Thai?”
“Well, you did turn up at my place of work, sneak in to slip a note under my office door, and sneak back out without any of the staff or the students spotting you,”  Tony chuckled, idly spinning a wrench in circles on his desktop, “And let me tell you, we have some smart students and paranoid staff members around here, so that takes some doing for a man your size.”
“I’d forgotten how good this can feel, you know?”  Steve said, glancing up from his contemplation at last.  “Not waking up alone.  I know last night wasn’t some kind of a favor you did for me or anything, and people say it’s rude to thank someone after sex, but I’m... I’m really, really grateful, Tony.”

“I have, over the years, come to suspect that Howard Stark rather preferred it that way,”  Jarvis offered to the tall, dark silhouette beside him.  “He did certainly stir up the hornet’s nest at SHIELD as soon as young Sir had taken himself off on his own, and I have been told that things got rather heated when he did.”
"Tony, I don't need you to tell me if it's none of my-"
“No.”
And there went Rogers’ Gosh-Who-Me smile again as he tapped at a corner of the desk blotter.  “Because Howard wrote this reporter’s name and her number right here about two weeks before he died,”  he said.  “His handwriting’s pretty shaky, but I can make out ‘ask re Afghanistan.’  So I figure it had something to do with his son’s kidnapping.  I want to know what they talked about.”
Ah.  So her ‘keep still and pretend to be as inscrutable as Coulson’ act hadn’t worked.  Okay.  Maybe May would be a better one to emulate in the future.  Daisy coughed, fidgeted a little, and then reached out to accept the tablet from his hands.  “I think thaaaat maybe if you told Rogers you had that kind of faith in him, he might feel a little more okay about what you need him to do?  Like, if he thought that White Star needed him for more than just going to meetings, and writing out the checks, and shaking hands with important people, he might not feel so much like running away?”
“Steve Rogers wanted none of that,”  James cut in at last, only slightly surprised to hear the words roll out of him in English now.  “Me like this,” he flexed his metal arm, and the plates whirred one against the other, flashing in the low light as they moved,  “with a list of murders longer than I can remember to my name; Carter barely able to recognize him, and hardly able to move or speak when she does; all the rest, everyone else he knew, gone to time, old age and treachery while he waited to be found, or to die?” he shook his head hard, long hair fretting at his shoulders as he pushed back away from her.  “The money Stark left him, the house, the business -- all that’s just dead men’s clothes, passed on at a wake.  You take them to be polite, but that doesn’t mean you’re excited to wear them.”
As if hearing the thought, Steve finished the chug with a sigh, and smacked his lips as he stood upright.  “Good job,” Steve said, drawing Tony up out of the shaky half-lunge warrior two pose he’d been holding forever and five hours at least.  “Ready to do the left side now?”
But it turned out that Howard, once she’d bullied her way in to confront him, hadn’t known anything about the hostile takeover.  He’d known that Tony was missing, of course, and said he had ‘his best guy on it’ (the memory of those words still made her spitting mad,) but as to her accusations, all he’d said was that he would talk to someone in legal about it and get back to her.
To which she shrugged.  "It's what I'd do."
Boneless and quivering against Steve’s chest, Tony couldn’t help whining. “Couldn’t I please just have another spanking instead?”
The tablet beside his lounger buzzed twice, not the gentle suggestion of a text or e mail, but the angry hornet rattle that dared you to ignore it and get stung for your neglect.  He was tempted anyway, until the second buzz came in the company of a not-so-distant car horn beeping.
your damned business, but you're kind of scarily perceptive, and you'll probably guess the rest anyway if I don't, so can we just go ahead and get this part over with?"  He was shouting again.  Well, not shouting, no, but speaking loud enough that the conversational din from the other few tables in the tiny restaurant quieted around them.  He forcibly held Steve's gaze and did
One scene left in this installment, my Adders.  Many thanks as always to those who've been reading along and cheering me on toward the end -- your words give me life!
Tony had always despised smalltalk, from as early as he could remember his mother trying to drill it into his head for her big fancy dinners.  When he'd struck out on his own after her death, Tony had gleefully refused to attend any event that might require him to fill it up with that kind of  polite and cheerful verbal diarrhea.  But that didn't mean he couldn't see Steve's skill at it.  He complimented with his eyes, and smiled as if for a camera, and his idle chatter was just as impeccable and hollow as it had been back in those first few nights when the man had shown up to turn every head in the White Eagle.
"Jesus, no, I was like fifteen, you perv!"  Tony laughed, poking Steve again for good measure, but softer this time.  "Not for lack of
“Heard Coulson talking with Fury about it down in the library earlier,”  Clint agreed, budging over at last, and cuddling up to the long curve of Natasha’s body.  “Current thought is that one of the bitter old timers got hold of his ear when Rogers went for lunch at the cafeteria.”
I realize this one's short, Murderblossoms.  I'll make up for it with another chapter tomorrow.  In the meantime, enjoy!  And thanks in advance to those of you who pause to comment -- you give me LIFE!
“No.”  He withdrew his hand gently, but with a finality that made Pepper just want to grind her teeth.  “I don’t want to wrap my life around the company that killed my father.”
Jan blows a kiss and then changes her mind and comes to give him a last minute hug, bringing with her a cloud of her own floral perfume. Heaven in a breath. God, he loves women. “Get well, Tony!”
"Would you rather drive?"
And Steve disappears into the shadows without looking back.
“I arrested our friends the day I offered you amnesty. I don’t know if I was doing the right thing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what’ll happen, I don’t want to go back.”
He breaks into the morgue, and it’s no easy task. Top clearance and security; SHIELD doesn’t want the skrull incident to get out yet. Steve imagines they had been in for a shock when they found the body left behind.
“Are you okay? I can toss down my jacket, before I go?”
And Steve appreciates the fantastic water pressure and self-warming bathroom floors, when he showers off the sour stink of nightmares, after living for so long without any amenities at all. He learns to let himself enjoy small pleasures of the flesh, of which Tony's home is in no short supply. The coffee is always freshly ground. He never goes cold or hungry.
Tony goes to the bar. He picks up a bottle and pours himself a generous drink, back turned to he window. Steve hates to see it. He keeps watching, as Tony flips up the faceplate and tosses his drink back. He turns to face the window—
to be the fist of SHRA, to take in his own friends, to lend his muscle to the destruction of liberty.
A green, impish face. Smug, even without smiling. A broad, wrinkled chin and pointed ears. He pours himself another drink, gnarled fingers like claws, and shucks the armor, piece by piece. A lizard stepping out of his skin. He’s

does, and it rages against it with everything.

in people believing it. The joke is that Tony has historically been the least stable of the Avengers, even on his best day. He’s all loose threads, the drink, the paranoia, the nightmares, the guilt, the anxiety, the crippling fear of abandonment— and he can’t seem to stop himself unravelling. Frayed.
(That isn’t the question.)
“Tony,” he says, hesitating, “I have to go. I can’t stay here. I gotta get help.”
“Stop,” Steve says. He can’t do that right now.
not the case. After a moment, Tony seems more irritated than confused by Steve’s silence, and throws the towel into the dirty laundry pile with the sheet.
Maria smirks.
Tony looks at Steve over his shoulder, fingers bunched up and fiddling with the edge of his blanket. Steve suddenly feels less than two inches tall, and utterly ashamed with himself. He sees it in Tony's eyes, that he knows he's a burden.
“Not quite like this.”
He’s way beyond the shakes, now. Audio and visual hallucinations start around the twenty-four hour mark, a voice in his head helpfully supplies.
“Ah,” Steve says, “There he is. As charming as ever.”
"Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Steve says. He doesn't try and reassure Tony, because he knows he won't believe it. He doesn't think he'll ever be able to leave, but he doesn't say so. He just says, "Right now, I'm here. For you. No matter what."
Tony’s eyes fall shut involuntarily, and he grins. “Was that a crack at my big mouth?” he says, delighted, “Because after that little performance, you’re hardly one to talk.”
Tony shrugs. “Fair enough. Yeah, we're alone. Do you want to give me a pat down?” Steve clenches his jaw. Tony seems much calmer than the last time they had met; there’s even a little swagger in his voice. Steve can’t read his expression very well with his eyes covered. He wishes Tony would take the shades off.
The press jump to their feet and waves of unrest move through the crowds of journalists and civilians. Steve frowns.
“I don’t want

He groaned.
They both eat better.
In those rare moments, when he’s aware enough to form thoughts, he thinks,
Steve watches the rain drip from the ledge a few feet past their feet. In their little overhang, they’re protected from the dampness. Under different circumstances, it could be called cozy.
* * *
He’s angry, but not irrational; he does not believe that Tony had had anything to do with the attack on him by SHIELD. That had been Maria, through and through, and it had been before Tony had been tasked by the president to bring Steve in. But he’s still culpable in his own way, guilt by association. The sting of abandonment when Tony hadn’t been the one to come to Steve’s rescue, either. How dare he think himself so special; Tony had not stopped the arrest of Steve's cohorts. Why would Steve expect anything different for himself?
"Might be my real name, you don't know,"  Tony challenged, slipping his jacket on, and replacing his bag as Steve, Mr. Thursday Night, except miraculously here on a Saturday, hurried to stand like a sophomore when his date comes downstairs.  And god, he was gorgeous -- high, wide, and handsome, and as tempting as every single terrible idea Tony had ever had in his life, with his bright, anxious eyes, and that adorable fucking wrinkle between his eyebrows as he wrung his ballcap between both hands.
for it.  Jails were untidy places, he suspected, and they tended to stain one’s things.
Tony grinned.  “Fast.”
"Thanks for being patient with us,"  Steve cut in smoothly, his charming Poster Boy face back in place as he took the bill with one hand and dug his wallet out of the pocket of his jeans with the other.  "We're sorry to have kept you so long, but it was a really lovely meal."
And wasn't
But then he drew Steve’s head back up, gave them both a second to gasp in the sweet reel of oxygen, and set him back to work with a murmured, “Good, very good.  Now more...”
"No, it's not like that,"  Steve hurried to declare, blue eyes wide and earnest.  "I'm not stepping out on anybody else, I promise.  Haven't even been on a date since before I shipped out, either, so... it's just... well."  He chewed his lip, brows furrowed in thought.  "Have you ever started to feel like people think you're some kinda property?  Not like you're a slave or anything, but maybe a car, or an heirloom chair; something more valuable than it is useful, you know?"
Phil heard Barnes’ arm whir against the sleeve of his tac suit, and rushed to intervene.  “No need, I promise,” he said, picking up his glass. “We’re not here to make trouble for anybody, and we’ll go in a minute.”
In which is revealed the value of art, the cruelty of parents, and the importance of muscle memory.
See?  Getting back around to the main pairing at last.  Another quick one today, Death-lilies.  I'll do updates daily now, until I've got the whole thing done, then I'll post the balance in one fell swoop.  So either way, you'll not have too long to wait for more of this story.
"You mind getting my pants and shoes?" he asked, as if it was the easiest, most natural thing in the world to ask for such a basic help.  Steve couldn't help but think with chagrin back to his own fragile youth, and his graceless, prideful stubbornness in the face of any hint of help or charity.
“So that kind of gossip is for sale then?”  Phil shot back.
But it didn’t seem fair to lay the price of all that on Steve Rogers’ head either.  After all, he hadn’t asked anybody to do it.
Barton whipped the hand in question under the table, and scowled.  Nick turned his head to glare the analyst back to her own business.

Tony felt his smile tug downward a little.  “What, because I survived?” he asked, curling a hand over his bad knee.
The White Eagle had clearly benefitted from the gentrification trend in this part of the city, though it put plenty of effort into making certain that passers-by knew it wasn’t just another hipster-fuelled, craft-beer engine.  A thousand tiny details, from the rainbow flag pen at the Bouncer’s station, to the teddy bear in kink leathers tied suggestively to the security bars over the basement windows stood up to announce that this was a place that put Family first.  Phil appreciated both the message, and the subtlety.  It was hard to be subtle when your movement’s banner was a rainbow.
The barkeep gave Barnes a long, and searching look.  Then he huffed through his beard, shook his head, and said, “I trust him farther than  I do you, cupcake,” as he turned back for the bar.
never tasted goat.  Most expensive dinner I’ve ever paid for though!”
Smart Car down there?”  Steve asked as if he hadn’t heard her.  “The teal one, with the Sanskrit on the hood?”
He always choose the shitty seat at the far end of the bar when he came in, never caring how close it was to the bathroom door, the wait station, and the gloomy make-out corner where every horny couple that thought they could get away with a quick blow or handjob without paying club cover for Downstairs went to get as busy as they could before Karl threw them out.  He just ducked the swinging door, dodged the sloshing drinks, and blushed a furious rose whenever he needed to politely ignore some public indecency going on beside him.
Now it was Steve's turn to laugh.  "Now who's got performance issues?" he goaded, digging out his wallet and flipping it open.  "Steve Rogers is my real name," he said, and watching Tony's mouth drop a little bit open as he peered at the misleading details, he had to add, "I hope this isn't a deal killer."
“Be my guest.” Rogers nodded graciously and tipped the stool upright, stepping away from the island, the captive, and the operatives who were even now crowding into the kitchen like kids on Christmas morning.  “I’ll just leave you to it then,” he said, catching Clint’s eye and tipping a nod toward the back door and the pool deck beyond.  Clint nodded, then turned back to watch the bagels toast as Captain America slipped away.
*** Steve ***
Tony laughed.  "Oh, Honey! Are you kidding?  These boys have been thirsting for you for months now, and when you finally step away from the bar, you come to me?"  He waved his hands at the bar chair again, and then wheeled his own hot rod red ride up the slight ramp that marked this table as 'his', and tucked up to the high top with a grin.  "You have to stay now -- if I buy you a drink and get your phone number tonight, they'll award me the Wicked Queen of the month award, and that comes with a goddamn tiara!"
Steve looked away with a wry twist of a smile, and Tony peered at him, wondered if the pink on his face and ears was maybe more pleasure than embarrassment now.  “You like that, don’t you?” he ventured.  “The pet names?”
She shrugged.  “Who bothers asking these days?  They’re pretty much the same.  Now,” she said, sobering, “you lead the way to the stairs.  Slow and easy, mind you.  I’d rather put a couple of rounds through your gut than bother with chasing you in these shoes, so remember that if you’re tempted to get clever.”
She couldn’t quite keep the skeptical look off her face.  “Sure, assuming they use computerized inventory tracking software, and I can figure out which one, but this address is in Brooklyn, sir.  Hipsters kinda have this ironic love affair with all things crusty and low tech, so I’d give even odds on this place’s books being, like, actually in
Neddy at the front door had even tried to pre-stamp his hand once, just as a favor to humanity, because apparently mankind
raccoons?  Like, can you rent them by the hour?"
“It’s Steve,” the man answered, not looking up from the folder he had splayed across the desk blotter.
"What?"  Tony gasped, backing into the apartment and towing Steve after by his hand, "Television has lied to me?  Call my lawyer! Whom do I sue!"
him?  Like, at all?  Because the Steve Rogers I remember woulda been on the six o clock news for punching a corporate asshole in the kisser if he’d give him any lip.”
Tony closed his eyes and shivered.  “Only if you get up here and kiss me with that filthy mouth once you’re inside,” he declared.  Then he gulped out a long, quavering moan as Steve bent low, hitched Tony’s thighs up over his own, and pressed that glorious cock into Tony’s body at last.   First the head, a sudden stretch, and then the long, heavy glide; muscles yielding to the thick press, fullness and heat stealing Tony’s breath away until finally they were pressed together, balls to balls, and Steve’s lips were on his own again.
when, upon returning from a trip to the john around midnight one Saturday, Tony rolled up on Mr. Goddamned Thursday Night -- out of his Armani and poured into criminally snug jeans, a ball cap, and a little blue shirt that deserved hazard pay for what he was putting it through -- pulling out the chair and preparing to sit at Tony's table.
Once he had permission to put the teacup down, anyway.
“On here, I assume,” he replied, passing over a palm sized data-stick.  It had a SHIELD logo engraved into the case, which Phil supposed would turn out to be a helpful red herring just in case the shop owner did turn out to be connected.  “The laptop in the back office was on, so I just cloned the whole thing from the OS down.”
“I...”  Steve stammered, just the right side of flabbergasted to put Tony’s singing nerves a little to rest. “Stalkery?  What?”
"Shh."  Tony curled his fingers tighter, not letting anything slide away, and not for a moment asking himself why keeping this literal stranger beside him was suddenly so important.  "It's fine.  Doesn't have to be like that at all, if that isn't what you want."  Tony cut a look upward, at the chiseled jaw and bright-flushed cheeks.  "I'm just saying it could be, if you do want."
So this was gonna be fun.
James shook his head, wiping surreptitiously at his eyes.  “I thought him kicking his Daddy’s weapon’s business to the curb would keep him out of the fight, but it almost cost him everything, because he might have been right to push his dad and Stane away.  And now... Now I can’t help thinking how
Oh, it was going to kill him.  But die happy, he would.
“Nope.  This city’s full of rich, white pretty boys like you,” she said, the shoe dangling from her fingers now, as if she might accidentally drop it.  “I mean you’re cute enough, but not in any way I particularly like.  I’d have forgotten all about you, only there’s motion activated cameras over there,” she pointed with the shoe at the corner of the roof, “and there,” another point toward the stair access, “and they stream the footage straight to my computer.  So imagine my surprise to see you breaking the lock on that transformer, and stripping down to your altogether right here on my roof.”  She shook her head and made a tsking noise.
Phil allowed a smile, trying for resigned instead of triumphant.  “I thought places like this ran on gossip and SoCo.”
“Aw, attic no,”  Clint groaned.
?” he blurted.
"Alright, but when Thanos does not come I want a homemade meal, with lots of booze."
Peter quivers on the floor, gingerly touching his now pulsing wound. The crowd slowly disperses as the action flattens to a flat line. Peter lies on the floor, whimpering in pain.
Comprehending and Understanding completely opposites. Peter stark-rogers learns how to use both when he speaks of the father who abandoned him.
☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆
Daddy issues piling higher than Mt Everest Tony Stark was never given true love. He'll give you a simple few who he thinks he's come close to loving, yet even those are lies that he hides behind. On a single hand, two fingers raise steadily. Tony Stark knew how to love. His love meant them loving everything that is not him. Each person touches the surface, discarding the broken man and uses him further.
"Why should I answer a ridiculous and redundant question? My sperm donor will not materialize from mere paper and ink."
"It's at twelve," Peter says, smiling at his father before he rushes off to catch the bus. Tony watches his son, his smile slipping off his face. The depressing splat of the smile on the floor leaves Tony in silence. Tony stares at the door and finds himself talking.
"Oh come on Pete, they always warn us of an incoming disaster then we are miss by it!" Tony whines at his son.
Tony sighs as Peter only waves him off. He watches the retreating form of Peter. Tony has his own tornados to watch out from. He hears more than he lets on. On his tongue lays a bitter pill he refuses to swallow. Steve might be in town. Everyone is more than eager to gossip about the model/painter. Tony hands it to him the living he makes is a good one. A self-made millionaire.
Tony Stark, a genius, a billionaire, a playboy, never holding his tongue for anyone. Peter sees the change first, his surrogate father smiling at him. The young toddler smiles back, even as Tony bites his tongue and lies.
To understand and comprehend many will argue are the same concepts. Yet, Tony Stark would tell them they are flat out wrong. He sees the difference every day.
Peter sprints out the car once they pull up making Tony shout, "Hey! The car hasn't even stopped! It's not that serious kid!" A sharp breath escapes Tony as he gently growls under his breath.
Peter's head remains tilted backward, praying that the nurse did not call his father.  Tony has more pressing matters than the fact that his son can't defend himself. A gentle sigh escapes the sixteen-year-old. This is not how he plans his day to go. The lunch is supposed to have happened, the boring Chemistry teacher droning on about acids and bases. Maybe even Ned telling him about a new batch of comics, yet this is not it. He groans into his hands.
A new storm is brewing their way
"That door, used for so many things, how is it that all I see it used for is for exiting my life?" He wonders aloud. The silence greets him like an old lover. Tony sighs pulling himself from the relevance. He walks his way to the bathroom. The rugged look wraps around in an almost aggressive reluctance to relinquish its hold. The time that passed between when he lost everything to now, nearly a full eleven years, leaves Tony reeling. The sudden need for a way out, burning deep in Tony's gut, unleashes itself with vigor. Tony gathers the flash of emotion, hurrying to grasp tendrils of it for motivation to live another day.
The warning bell rings, herding all the students to their classrooms. Peter walks to the nurse instead. He sits on the cot, still holding his nose. A gentle sigh. The day looks to be shaping up as a bad day.
"Dad! Did you hear me! Order all the bread you can! Every non-perishable item is known to man! We will survive!" Peter says, dramatically. Each word he gives a violent shake, a stern look on his face. Tony stares before laughter bubbles up his throat. Peter pouts at his father as Tony can only laugh at him.
"Will you be coming for the parent lunch?" Peter asks hope in the 16-year-old's voice. Tony considers him for a long moment before he blinks away the look.
"Peter! I got here as soon as I could, how are you?" Tony inquires, seizing his son. Tony's arms, although thin in looks, packs a grip. Peter squeezes out a meek reply, "Just a stupid fight."
"Do you mind? Some of us like to skip class in peace," A baritone voice grumbles, causing Peter to jump. Peter glances around the room that he previously believed empty. His eyes settle on the cot that lays just a few inches away. The telltale outline of another person draws his attention. Peter screws his mouth shut, confusion licking at him. Before he could react the door swings open, in the doorway stands Tony.  Tony's cheeks flush red, exertion from physical effort.
'Who was that?'
'Behind all that money daddy gave you what are you?' A rough shake and Tony's back from the memories.
Tony has none of it, he looks back at the nurse. His hands shake, the incident causing Tony's discomfort, pure fear the depths of the chocolate eyes. Peter gazes at him, a long moment to try and understand his father. He knew of the abandonment issues that run deep inside his father. The issues were something you will always see last. A mask rests firmly on Tony's face constantly, unless you were Peter. Peter, the only reason Tony functions on the level he does. Peter sighs.
Tony slides into the driver seat, watching his son slide into the chair opposite of him. Warmth. Tony can only smile at his son, and rub his head. They will be alright, forcing positivity into his forefront. Tony pulls from the school, focusing on the simple task of driving.
Peter grabs the bottle of the liquor away from his sleeping father. He places a blanket over his father, a sad look donning Peter's face. The cold lining of rage sparking inside him. This, Tony's pain, is all his fault, Peter fumes, turning to gaze at the pseudo happy family picture when he was only an infant still. The blonde man smiling at him makes him clench his hands.
"A storm will be blowing our way, everyone is prepared for a possible tornado-" Tony cuts the radio off, rolling his eyes at the host. Peter protests, deathly afraid of hurricanes and the destruction link to it.
Tony can only listen to him as he idly begins to cook. Tony has cuts and burns decorating his arms from his early life cooking for Peter. He still lacks in flavor, something he never really pick up. The quality makes up for it. Peter perks as he smells his favorite dish in the air. Peter smiles, dopey. His father is trying to make him happy. He touches his nose and shakes his head.
He fools himself once more, Steve Rogers. A male that his father held in front of his true son. The model is everything Tony was not, giving his father the reason to lust after him. The recent swelling in Tony didn't last long. His parents killed in a robbery gone wrong left the broken man many see today.
Maybe not such a bad day after all.
"Dad!" Peter loudly whines. He grips Tony's hand, dragging him inside their home. He lists off things to Jarvis that they need, and some of the items he wants.
"Peter..?" The gentle whisper snaps the fuming boy out his rage. Tony raises his head, brown eyes tired and tipping the scales on lifeless. Tony still smiles, giving his best effort. Peter manages it back.
"Let's go, we can get some bonding," Peter says, smiling at him and happily. Tony nods, slowly. He was not ready to let his son out his embrace. Peter looks at him, and a gentle smile arrives on his face. The hold on his father is tight.
"But dad! We never know! They say storm Thanos will be a devastating one! He's already a category 4! Oh my god, I have to charge all my phones!" Peter begins to speak to the car, rapidly. Jarvis, the AI Tony built years ago replies with almost a warm tone to the panicking teenager. Tony can only chuckle at his son.
Saying Tony Stark comprehends love would mean he did his research, digging to the deepest root of the simplistic word. However, he did not comprehend love, he only understands it. If asking him what love is he can rattle off any answer that many others have said. He is a genius, but even he has the limitations of his own. Tony Stark could not comprehend love.
Tony can only stare at the grown son he has in front of him. He shakes his overwhelming anxiety. He holds him and nods, leading him out the room. It occurs to Peter to glance back to the other cot. The outline was no longer there for him to see. The vague thought of maybe a ghost, but a science man never believes in the supernatural.
Tony is surprisingly silent on the walk out of the school, yet his grip on his son did not relinquish. His lips press together tightly, managing to hold tightly on his raging emotions. It hurt, you know, to have the only thing meaningful in his life to be touched. Peter is all Tony has, all he will ever have if he's honest. His eyes slide over to the younger man. The bruise on his nose is slowly blooming, his brown eyes remain on the floor. Tony sighs.
"Your father will be back. He's off taking pictures with other sweet kids like you."
"Of course I'll make it, anything for my little genius," Tony replies smiling with sincerity. Peter cheers, standing. He smiles at Tony, gripping his backpack before he walks to the door. He looks at Tony, genuinely looking at his father. Tony the billionaire, genius, and the broken.
Flash smirks, pleasantly happy with the damage he has caused, "Next time think before you speak to me, Nerd."
Tony gave up on love long before he recognized it himself. Steve revives it with his gentle words and smiles.
"Aw, if it isn't little Pete. Are you still trying to find your daddy in those books?" Flash, Peter's most frequent harasser, leers. Peter pushes his face more in-depth into the book he holds. The lack of response makes Flash bubble with anger. The book that nestles in Peter's hands is taken to the floor by a rude smack.
Tony can't say he's in shock when Steve tells him their love is gone. Steve found another. The happy night ruined. Steve left not only Tony behind, but the small toddler, crying in his room.
"Peter needs me. Peter will not leave me," Tony whispers like a safety blanket. The renewing of his purpose allows Tony to continue with a shower, bringing himself to a presentable state. Tony flashes a faux smile in the mirror. He gathers a jacket to fight against the biting chill outside. A single look at the mirror and he's stepping out for another day.
"Ya off to school?" Tony asks. Peter nods, crouching at his father's side, smiling at him. Tony grins, ruffling his head before he looks around the home. The remains of last night's pity fest still evident on the tables. Peter smooths his father's hair down, eyes soft.
“This is pointless. Can’t you reschedule?” Steve says.
“Sheriff, if you wouldn’t mind, would you reach into my left boot?” Tony said, raising his leg a pitiful few inches. “I’d do it myself but on account of the broken rib… ”
stupid, that’s for sure,” Tony said. “It started with a poker game.”
“Shit,” Joe says, turning back toward Tony. He produces a needle and kneels by Tony’s side. Tony coughs some more, tears starting to form in the corners of his eyes as the paper burns itself down.
“Tell me about Kirk,” Steve says.
Tony bit his tongue.
He’s trying to downplay it for Steve’s sake, but the writing’s on the wall.
Tony is edgy, and it’s coming across more than he intends. Ironically, flights still make him nervous. In fact, after becoming accustomed to piloting the armor, he’s even more anxious about sitting strapped into a plane in civilian clothes while someone else is behind the controls. Between that and the stress of being the only person trying to salvage the day’s events, Tony could stand to put away a few drinks. He deserves it.
It’s a different kiss entirely than when the skrull tried to kiss Steve as Tony, and Steve takes it as dizzying confirmation that this is meant to be, between them. This is all he’s ever wanted.
“I thought the villains were the guys in masks, who refuse to obey the law,” Maria says pointedly.
Tony grimaces, and his eyes dart back and forth, like he wants to check over his shoulder again but he’s showing restraint out of a sense of guilt. “I didn’t realize this would happen.”
Sam helps him with the stealth and tech, and Steve couldn’t be more grateful for a friend who doesn’t ask too many questions. It isn’t easy. Tony Stark had already been one of the wealthiest and the most tech savvy man in the free world before, but now he also has the benefit of a government espionage and security agency at his disposal. It’s almost an impossible task.
“I’ll bring a rescue team.”
He doesn’t finish the thought out loud. Tony couldn’t be more glad.
* * *
“I was talking to Janet,” she says, reaching over Tony, her breasts hanging in his face almost distracting him too much to care that she’s pulling his wallet out of a small plastic bin on the nightstand. She pays Janet fifty dollars of Tony’s cash, and Tony feels distinctly like he’s outlived his usefulness.
“You know, I’m not going anywhere. I’m real,” Steve says, slowly. Tony seems relieved, but like he maybe doesn’t quite believe it yet. Steve knows a thing or two about that; he’s spent a long time teaching himself how to prepare for disappointment.
Tony says, “With the cooperation of our government, effective immediately, SHIELD will be conducting increased surveillance in areas of high risk, and we will be temporarily enforcing curfew hours in the city—”
He misses Steve, even though he’s only a holler away.
Tony presses his hands to his eyes, overwhelmed. “Natasha? What’s she talking about?”
would be back on his feet in no time. A quick, blinding pain exploded from his rib and he winced.
He looks down and doesn’t realize he’s crying until one of his own hot tears drop from the tip of his nose and falls onto the mangled, green face.
“I’m sorry, I thought this was serious. White flag. I thought that—”
“You have to get out of here, Cap, they have backup on the way,” Sam says to Steve through grit teeth; it doesn’t look as though Sam has fared much better than Steve. He looks broken, and tired, and just barely able to stand on his own. Steve can’t ask how many they lost, or who. He’s just glad Sam’s still standing. He feels like he’s drowning. Is it the blood in his lungs, or the fact that he can’t seem to make himself breathe evenly? The way an empty opens like a tear in spacetime and sucks what's left of his spirit out of him. Everything starts to feel far away. Like walking through a world wrapped in cotton.
The next time he opens his eyes, Steve sits beside him and Tony starts to scream.
It isn’t a win; SHIELD forcing Tony’s hand and Tony letting them isn’t a win by any measure, but some part of Steve cannot help celebrating inside— that Tony isn’t fully to blame, that even if the world is fucked— whatever has long existed between them might be salvageable. That Tony still needs him. (That nameless, ill-defined bond has always meant so much to Steve.)
This snaps him into action. Steve moves mechanically, without an articulate thought beyond the thrumming in his veins. He wears only his underwear and a t-shirt. In the dark, his still-healing scars shine like crescent moons. Stretched, new, shining skin. In bare feet, he takes his phone from his sleeping quarters to the computer room. In their safe house, the computer room is a huge, cold space with a vaulted ceiling, and large screens and metal boxes housing computers lining the walls. All concrete and aluminum. His bare feet sound funny on the unyielding floor, like duck flippers.
“You did this to yourself,” Steve says, but Tony can tell Steve isn’t oblivious to the amount of pain he’s in. “All for a drink. I don’t understand.”
“I’m Tony Stark,” he says.
It’s easier to skip the whole song and dance by simply not telling her when he has chemo, or surgery, or appointments, so he can’t resent her for not being there to hold his hand. It’s just the way the do things.
In a blind panic, Tony pounded on the door a few more times. He could taste his own heartbeat.
(He’ll maintain to his grave that the game has changed beyond repair, and that it was another thing entirely back in his day— but that doesn’t stop him from tuning in.)
. He’s wearing Tony’s favorite three piece.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony says. He couldn’t have thought of this plan on his own. That’s him, though. Always riding on Daddy’s coat tails.
When everyone has seated themselves around the round table, Steve stands at the head and clears his throat. He looks haggard in the dim, flickering fluorescents. They’re a band of ghosts, defined more by what they’re missing than by what remains.
Tony chuckles. “You got me there. If there’s not bottle service or bikinis, I’m not interested.”
Then the needle prick, a skrull drawing his blood, then the scene changes again. He’s crying and his mouth tastes like bourbon, and he just wants Ty to
* * *
. Where the hell are you, on Christmas Eve?” Tony said under his breath. He didn’t have any weapon on him, (or a prayer of getting out of this in one piece), but did have a bottle opener in his pocket.
Steve realizes Tony’s lips are moving, but no sound is coming out.
* * *
“You do it, I can’t do it, I’m going to throw up. Just, cut it off of me.”
"Why should I go anywhere with you? After all your tricks?"
“Steve—” Tony says, but Steve doesn’t let him say anything.
“God gave you a mouth.”
Tony is eight years old and drunk on bourbon. Tony is seven years old and he’s got a fever and Daddy’s mad. Tony is five years old and can’t speak right and his father kneels beside him and grabs his face,
“I’ll take it.”
But then, it comes together.
Yet, Steve finds it difficult to shake the obsessive, insecure thought, that he had never really known Tony at all.
Tony winces, and talks with urgency, slurring his words, “Some of it was me. The Reg’stration— I only just started ‘membering again. I couldn’t rem’ber. But now I do. You hate me now. I don’ know what to do. I don’ know why you would come.”
Well, that would blow. But it might be easier than this.
Instead, he mournfully pushes away the fresh set of margaritas and stuffs his phone into his pocket. “No need to get testy, Cap,” he mutters under his breath, to himself. “Anything for you, Cap. You’re the boss, Cap. Better get here before I change my mind,
Steve could die on the spot. As he stumbles out the door, he hears Tony say, “Watch out for those checkpoints, Steve. I hear it’s never good to be caught out past curfew without legitimate business. I hear SHIELD's really cracking down.”
He gets the sense that a man like Steve isn’t used to feeling too ineffective.
and a thud in a room above him. The ceiling of his cell trembles under hurried footsteps above.
He chokes. His vision blurs. He could lie down beside the corpse and close his  eyes and pretend they're both asleep, until Steve slips away to that other place. As broken as he is now, he still can't quite believe he'd ever  be allowed the release of death.
"Yeah. I know," Sam says grimly. "It's over."
, Steve. Come on, now.” He says it in such a patronizing tone that Steve genuinely wonders if he had missed something obvious. He feels absolutely speechless. He feels like an idiot. His face burns. His heart hammers. God, what is he even doing here?
Tony raises the face plate, and Steve goes weak in the knees.
Tony barks out a laugh, loud enough to make Steve nervous. “What do you think I
Tony remembers to exhale when he gets dizzy holding his breath. What happens in the cave stays in the cave, he thinks. Briefly— guiltily— Natasha crosses Tony’s mind. Then, Steve unzips Tony’s pants and puts his hands on him, and Tony stops being able to hold a thought in his head.
* * *
“Hear what? The rain?”
“Seems I’ve been doing a little too much of that, lately,” Tony admitted.
It’s impossible to say with certainty, even if he can guess based on the changes he had noticed as things got worse. Some range of times when Tony had stopped seeming like Tony. But the nature of the beast is that all of them had ceased to be themselves for a while. Their world had been ripped apart.
Tony sighs and tries to shift position, stiff and uncomfortable from spending so much time in the same position. It has been hours, cold and stiff on the hard ground, his little craving growing worse and worse with time. He doesn’t mention it to Steve, because he doesn’t see a point, but Tony’s sweating all over. It’s disgusting and uncomfortable. He reeks. And he can’t seem to stop shaking.
“A lot of murders start that way,” Steve said.
“At ease, soldier,” Tony says, patting the chair beside the bed. “You look so tense it’s making my headache somehow worse. Would you sit down and take a load off?”
The sun had risen fully, by now. It was truly Christmas day.
he says out loud, testing his voice in the stillness. His echo apologizes back to him, muted and bouncing off the concrete walls,
And then people start disappearing.
Somewhere in his head, Tony remembers the stages of withdrawals. He’s been through rehab once or twice, but he’s never really gone through it terribly. He’s always had the cash to shell out for the nice places that really hold your hand and give you meds to get you through the worst of it— and sometimes, when Tony wasn’t quite as dedicated to getting well, he had no trouble smuggling in a secret stash to get him past the shakes.
“I wish you were here, right now. I know you’re probably gone. But you deserve a proper burial. You deserve better than this,” Steve says to the inanimate faceplate. “I knew there would be a war. When Maria told me about the Act, I knew it would split us all down the middle. I knew it would destroy us. But I never expected how. I don’t think I could have. You did, I think. I think I see that, now. Sometimes you do things that I don’t understand. I don’t see ahead like you do. But I see where we’ve been.”
The thing about rage is that it burns out, with time and distance. Smolders down, into something colder and more bitter, or gives way to whatever the real, underlying emotion had been in the first place.
“Don’t try and be the brains now, Steve.”
His doppelganger smiles.
each other’s help to do the right thing, whatever it is.
All Steve can do is be there.
Tony sits crosslegged on his bed, fully dressed in a rumpled three piece. His hair is limp and tired and the skin beneath his eyes feels like paper. When he goes long enough without sleeping, he feels it in his eyes. Heavy and dry, and he catches himself staring into space at nothing.
He watched Steve process what Tony was really suggesting, and his thicks eyebrows shot up. He swallowed. And he smiled, flushed.
“I’m glad you came,” Tony says.
“Fuck,” he sighs, shaking his hair as it becomes shaggy and damp, and then he tilts his mouth back open and greedily swallows more rain. When he opens his eyes, he sees— just for a moment— that Steve is staring at him. The second Tony catches his eye, Steve diverts his gaze.
Embarrassingly, it’s exactly what Steve had accused him of earlier. Tony is beginning feel the effects of going so long without a drink. Not that it’s even
“Need a hand, Stark?” Sheriff Rogers said. “I think you’ve had enough injuries for one day.”
“You don’t have to threaten me.”
It takes a long time for the broken pieces to heal. Things don’t get better right away. Steve has to drop Tony off at a private hospital anonymously and leave, because SHIELD is still out for his blood. But they talk every day, over the private line of communication. Tony’s body is broken, but it’s his mind that really suffered, and Steve hopes that his words of encouragement in Tony’s head ease the burden, even marginally. Tony never talks about what went on in that basement, and Steve is reluctant to answer some of the questions Tony asks about what went on under the dictatorship of his Skrull double. So they find other things to talk about.
If Steve had ever been a drinking man, he would start on the liquor around this point.
He presses a button on the wall which summons a nurse in green scrubs.
A week later, Steve turns on the TV in the common room of the safe house. He's not alone; members of his group mill around, tending wounds, making small talk.
He wonders where the real Tony is tonight.
Needle prick.
Except, Steve has thought he was doing a good job of hiding that-- his undying devotion. His pathetic willingness to redraw the line in the sand until he and Tony find themselves on the same side. Steve doesn’t know what to say, and quickly, Tony back pedals, clearing his throat.
"As he loses consciousness, he sinks into a dark fog, some endless night, where a dozen green hands reach down his throat and pull him apart from the inside out."
He dreams about a man with sunshine in his eyelashes.
“… C’mon, Stark… Hey…ou hear m…?” a voice swam in and out above him, along with the ringing in his ears.
much.”
It’s a different podium, and a different news station, but the whole thing feels eerily repetitive.
Tony’s treading dangerous waters, but he can’t help himself. His throat tastes like copper and his pulse thrums. All his pain— the stabbing in his head, the dizziness and third degree burn going septic, his broken bones and the rotting itch of his ruined flesh, the withdrawals, the mortal despair— it all goes quiet. For a moment, all the noise in the world goes hushed by the exhilaration of balancing on a razor’s edge. Tony shivers, almost frightened by the darkness that flashes in Steve’s clear, blue eyes. The terror only heightens the thrill, and Tony isn’t sure which he wants more: to make Steve
He wonders, suddenly, what would have happened if it
Steve backs away, undisguised confusion written all over his face, "Why I'm here?" he says dumbly.
“Ah,” Steve said, red-cheeked.
Steve shut up. For a moment, abject terror flashed in his blue eyes, and Tony didn’t even dare to breathe. The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked up into a confused smile. He ducked his neck and pulled Tony in with that hand on his back, and he kissed him.
The next time he opens his eyes, Steve sits beside him and there’s water running down the walls of the cave. Thunder booms like a drum beat, and Steve hunches over between Tony’s legs so his face is hidden. Tony grins, lazily trying to shift his knees further apart.
“Ah,” Steve says, understanding. He grinds his jaw, and his eyes dart down. “Well, I guess I should be relieved.”
“Give it time, I’m sure I’ll shut up for good soon enough,” Tony says in a sardonic sing-song voice.
“Don’t talk, let me give you some water. It’s okay. It’s going to be okay,” Steve says, reaching into his bag and producing one of his jugs. He isn’t sure that Tony has the strength to hold it himself. “Can I— I’m going to hold this up to your mouth. It’s okay. Just drink slowly. It’s okay.”
“Listen, she’s not coming. I’m just passing along the message, Rogers, don’t shoot the messenger,” Tony says. “She bailed, it is what it is. And it looks like it’ll be just you and me.” He holds the phone between his shoulder and his ear, messaging his opposite temple with one hand, and flagging down the bartender with the other.
“Steve.” But Steve has started a thought he can't stop.
Steve coughs. “Maybe we shouldn’t—”
As much as it pained him to turn his back to the open air, he whirled around to face the jailhouse door. He dragged the sharp tip of the bottle-opener against the chipped paint of wooden door.
A second message follows a second later. The following message is without words; it contains an address, the dock behind a derelict shipping house. Discrete, Steve things. Private.
It’s such a classically heroic thing to say, almost a caricature of the legend— Captain America, stars, stripes, and courage. What an odd pair they make; Tony, so wrapped up in silk and smoke and feathers he can’t remember how to be genuine, and Steve, who seems to be exactly who he claims to be, at every moment of every day, like it’s no choice. Before they defrosted him, Tony wouldn’t have believed that it wasn’t at least partially an act— the man from the newsreels giving soap box speeches, rallying the troops to choose their patriotic duty and find glory in death.
Steve still doesn't know what triggered the melt down.
“Aw, had a little whoopsie with the needle?” she says, snapping on gloves. “Hold on, sugar, this will just feel like a little pinch.”
* * *
“I’m not sure what to say,” he admits.
They took him behind a barn and threw him onto the ground. There would be no witnesses. For posterity’s sake, Tony did struggle. He valiantly tried to make a break for it the minute he was released. It was mostly for the sake of the principle.
The remaining coins skittered off in every direction, gleaming as they bounced. His whiskey glass shattered as it hit hard wood. The poker cards fluttered to the ground around him, like white and red feathers.
“I know. Don’t worry about it.” Tony looks at the needle in dismay. He’s a little nauseous. He forces himself to focus on the ceiling for a minute until it passes.
“You got
a contented expression on his face.
Tony had said.
“Hey, are you with me?”
“Gross. God.”
Needle prick.
He says, “What do you want, Tony?”
* * *
“Shh.”
Tony’s mouth is slow and clumsy.
“Sheriff?”
“Never claimed that,” Tony replied. He sure didn’t feel bright right now, hungover, ice cold, and busted six ways to Sunday on Christmas morning, tied to the railroad tracks.
* * *
“In your message, you said ‘white flag,’” Steve says, brusk and impersonal. The black water softly laps at the dock, rhythmic splashing, soft enough to comfortably mask their voices if anyone is listening nearby. “I took that to mean surrender. Things
He thinks,
Steve can hardly breathe. This has to be it.
Tony knew there’d be a price, the moment he decided to talk back. It was worth it to get in a good last word. Hopefully they’d be too mad to drag it out any further, goaded into killing him quickly. They started kicking him, all three of them, and all Tony could do was lie there and take it.
Steve has spent a lot of his life believing that confrontation leads to resolution, facing things head on. It’s almost true. When all the good guys are easily identified, surrounded in an echo chamber of friends congratulating each other on a job well done, it becomes easy to forget that there is always an after. A next day. What to do when you throw all of yourself into a conflict and there
He thought it was over. He groaned, but lay there, allowing himself a minute to recover. His head spun. Body throbbed. Usually, this was the point at which bar fights ended. (If this could fairly be called a fight.) Tossed out into the muck, now, that was never pleasant, but it meant game over.
Following him.
He waits for Tony to message him, for any reason, because he’s afraid of being traced and losing their location. If they get flushed out now, even if some of them make it to a new safe house, their numbers would be obliterated. There would be no way everyone makes it through the SHIELD checkpoints and surveillance unseen. He wishes a message into existence.
They were at the train tracks at the outskirts of town, and nobody would hear him scream— if he even had the lung capacity for screaming. Something stabbed inside him with every shallow breath.
It takes them weeks of staking out, and painstakingly reaching out to sources, combing through all their access channels, bleeding the last of their resources dry. They lose more people. Steve forgets to grieve, it just stops turning on-- or maybe it never turns off. They have a close call with a raid in the same neighborhood as the safe house. That’s a hard night for all of them. Trapped like rats, totally at the mercy of chance, unable to do anything but wait to live or die. Steve starts to think he’s losing his mind.
If it had been Natasha, Tony realizes, he probably would have died of his own idiocy and addiction on day one, crawling through fire for three ounces of liquor. When Tony had been medivacced to the hospital, hanging on by a thread, she hadn’t been eating her own fingernails after a few sleepless nights of worry, counting the rise and fall of his chest in that hospital bed; fair enough, considering Tony managed to get his dick wet the few days they were apart. He’s scum.
All he knows now is that if by some miracle he could get Tony back, Steve would know better than to ever let something tear them apart again. The truth is, nothing could be worth it. He’s chosen the most worthy hill to die on, but he hadn’t accounted for this, and so there couldn’t be anything worth it.
“You’re not wrong,” Tony says, and Steve exhales. He hides his relief, barely.
It pours in slow motions, almost glowing in the narrow beam of natural light falling toward the center of the cave. Steve stands there as if in a broken spotlight, frowning at the sky, his ruined uniform turning dark with water.
But then, he sees, magnified by the super binoculars, a red and gold figure steps into Steve’s line of sight. Gleaming.
* * *
"Nothing," Tony says. He doesn't blink and his eyes go glassy. His skin goes white.
Tony frowns. He rattles his chain weakly.
The message is short. Just as Steve had imagined it would be.
The bartender clears his throat, staring at Tony like a man who has lost his mind. “You know you still hav to pay for those?”
Wouldn’t be the first time he had royally fucked up while drunk, and had murderous outlaws follow him home to murder him. Wouldn’t be the last, either, realistically, if he survived the night.
“Open your mouth,” Tony says.
Tony nodded, and coughed some more. When he was finished, he just lay there panting.
He dreams bloody dreams until his buzzing communicator wakes him, and that other, transient world evaporates. Dew in the heat.
"What's going on?"
“Thank God,” Tony says, to Jarvis, “I’m thirsty as hell.” He laughs and Steve’s expression turns uneasy. Something inside of him hurts in response to laughter, but the pain’s too nebulous to place.
Steve scooches back a bit, and he feels almost out of his own body.
Tony watches as Steve mulls it over, like he’s trying to read his mind. Just desperate for Steve’s approval. Black smoke crawls toward the heavens in thick pillars behind Tony’s back. He still catches the light, just so. He still looks golden.
Tony scoffed. “Whoever said I needed rescue? Had it all planned out. Was gonna have myself home in time for Christmas breakfast, before you showed up.”
“Star Trek, Steve. Really?” He waves his hand emphatically. “The Enterprise. The final frontier. You know. It’s culture.”
The empty suit of armor has been laid out on the coroner’s table like a corpse. The body of the skrull inside is in a drawer; Steve doesn’t need to see it. The parasite has been removed, and Tony himself is still dust in the wind. Steve spends a few slow breaths standing barely inside the room, with the door open at his back. The light behind him from the hall casts a long shadow across the concrete floor. He exhales. He steps fully inside. He lets the heavy door fall shut with a muted thud and an icy rush of air. Then all is still; all is stale. All quiet and dark in a room for the dead.
He smiles into the camera, making direct eye contact with eyes like emerald in the light, “—if you see something, say something. Our hotline runs 24/7.”
It’s silent, too. There are no footsteps coming from any other part of the building. No whir of the heating and plumbing. No hum of computers in other rooms. Tony has been left alone to his grave, and he wonders if he’s dead already.
. I know you know that,” Steve says, and in the moment, he doesn’t care that Tony seems to shrink with every word. Fucking liar, poor little
He removes his shirt and slides it over Tony’s head. It’s enormous on him, but Tony’s skin is like ice and it feels wrong not to afford him the dignity of a little coverage.
until Steve discovered that someone else was in his place.
Then he starts convulsing, biting his own tongue, as the little device shocks the hell out of him. Steve feels satisfied, in some sick, fleeting way, but only for a second.
“I should be here as a second set of eyes on the paperwork,” Steve suggests. Tony never argues; this is, after all, always what he wanted. Steve doesn’t coddle when it comes to the work. He takes red pen to the stacks of legislature and forms and speeches and approvals. He tears them to shreds and makes few concessions, and Tony makes every change Steve demands, and there’s surprisingly little to talk about. Sometimes Steve wonders, always after the fact, if Tony remember how to object. If Steve's inadvertently taking advantage of some defensive passivity that developed in their time apart.
he had let himself believe. Their values are even more radically different than he had let himself see, and he had always been able to reconcile this by telling himself that at
* * *
“Merry Christmas, Steve.”
“I’m not sure what you expected,” Steve says. He sure knows what he expected, and this isn’t it, either. Still, he finds himself second guessing. What is Tony so paranoid about? It isn’t like him to be afraid for no reason. It isn’t like him to put himself in positions where he’s unprepared.
He cleans himself up hastily. When he’s done, he looks up at Tony and that’s all the notice he has before Tony leans in to kiss him.
More shaking. Pain so bad Tony involuntarily spasmed, and coughed. He sounded like a punctured balloon.
Tony sighs. His mouth is the only part of his face that moves.
Then someone leaks it, a picture of the skrull’s green corpse in the damaged armor, and the world explodes.
And maybe it’s intentional, using humor and poking at all Steve’s sore spots to distract from the startling immediacy of his own mortality. It’s a terrifying thing, to look death in the face. Tony doesn’t like to feel small. In a roundabout way, this is also his way of making it easier for Steve. Like the more obnoxious Tony acts for the remainder of his life, the less it’ll affect the old Captain to lose him.
for once,” Tony wheezed.
“Hey,” Steve says, “Up here.”
“But,” Steve says, tone shifted— careful, and almost defensive, “I’m not ashamed of it. I’m not ashamed of myself, or anything that we did, in the circumstances.”
It feels like it takes him forever to say, “Who’s Ste’ Roge’s?”
He fantasizes about a white beach and no cell reception, and no paper work, just the two of them, remembering how to be human together.
“You sure?”
“A double?” Tony said.
“Three words,” Tony squeaked. In for a penny, in for a pound.
Steve had been the fool, and it isn't fair to blame anyone but himself. Steve remembers how long and hard Tony fought to keep his own identity in the shadows. Steve hasn’t forgotten. Maybe he’s the only one to see the hypocrisy in that.
He’s been held captive before; he thinks he was never so weak. He blames it on the drugs. He blames it on the routine. He blames it on his age. It feels like there are hands inside his brain, people digging around inside of him. Animals in a trash bin. Rearranging and molesting, no part of him feels untouched. The drugs are like a blender on his subconscious memory, and the nightmares of the day mix seamlessly with the horrors of his own dreams. His thoughts corrupted, his mind half gone, his body weakened and strange to him.
Tony’s brows shoot up, amused. “God, you’re just full of surprises, aren’t you?”
Steve crosses his arms. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Well that’s a good idea. A signal fire,” Tony says. Steve looks over at him suddenly, as though surprised to hear that they’re in agreement. Tony adds, “Although, I’d think that if the key to our rescue depended on a fire, perhaps the burning fucking airplane would have worked more to—
* * *
“Who?”
“Ah. That's refreshing. But, you know. Suit yourself,” Tony says. He wipes his mouth on the back of his sleeve. “I guess you want to get down to brass tacks, then.”
He meets Tony in the ship yard, not far from Tony’s home. It’s late at night, but Tony’s eyes are covered by shades and he leans against a post under a street light. Steve takes in a deep breathe of the salty, reeking air, and the smell of wood rot from the ancient planks of the dock.
* * *
Instead, he picks up a magazine, the one from the top of the stack, and opens to a random place. Thumbing through the pages, he pretends to be interested in a year old edition of
Tony gains more weight. It’s a struggle, but with Steve around, they keep regular mealtimes. He stops looking quite so fragile, to Steve’s immense relief. He starts insisting on taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and Steve insists on going with him in case he needs helps halfway down. Tony loathes the coddling, so Steve is careful not to make a fuss about it when Tony gets winded and has to grip Steve’s hand for extra support on the last flight.
“Hey.
Tony can’t blame her for this; they don’t talk about his health condition, usually. It’s the ugliest side of him, and Natasha is a stunning— and pragmatic— woman. It’s what makes her perfect for him. Tony is too proud, and a health amount of ashamed, to let her see him like this. Today has just been a helpful reminder of why: that pitying combination of discomfort and disgust. Her, in a hurry to leave and trying to pretend not to be, and Tony, obligated to act like it doesn’t bother him.
“Stark,” Steve says. “Tony.”
Tony shrugs, noticing how Steve has skillfully diverted the conversation back off of himself. “I don’t think I would have agreed to join the team is I was fully in my right mind.” He plays it off like a joke, but there’s more truth than he’s comfortable admitting.
“Get away, devil,” he rasps, flapping his arms in disoriented terror.
Tony might be slow but he does eventually connect the dots. He frowns. Not the most encouraging news to wake up with. “Dear, you bet against me?”
* * *
Tony wanted to say,
“Testy, are we?”
“Easy, there. Take it slow,” Steve said.
“Whatever, you wouldn’t make a good Scotty, always. No sense of humor.”
Tony has been slipping in and out of delirious sleep, waking just to piss (which hurts), or to endure Steve’s poor bedside manner as he checks Tony’s pupils for signs of concussion.
“What?”
With his last bit of momentum, he tries to slap the double’s hand away. He severely miscalculates the effort it takes to move. His hand just barely grazes against the bottom corner of his own bedsheet, leaving a single bloody streak. Then he goes totally limp.
He sleeps in an abandoned house, on a mildewed sofa. The walls are bare, the wallpaper sun bleached except for in rectangle shaped patches where there must have once been frames hanging.
“Be a doll and mix a drink? Say, do you know how to make a highball?” Tony says. Steve doesn’t laugh.
Steve swallows a tooth. He gasps for breath.
“If you had just been a second later,” Tony says, “I could have gotten it. Only needed another second. Less than that. I had it in my finger tips.”
“All that pacing isn’t going to do anything but wear a track in the ground, darling,” Tony says in that cloyingly sweet tone that he knows grates at Steve’s nerves. Predictably, Steve’s scowl deepens, made more serious by the fresh blood crusted in his eyebrows hairs from the fresh cut on his face.
Steve goes, against his better judgement.
He backed up against the door, but he was truly cornered. The third man— the huge, silent one— knocked the bottle opener out of Tony’s hand. He grabbed him by the collar and dragged him down the steps.
It starts to rain, just in time to distract Tony from the way his hands have begun to shake. This is a blessing and a curse. The heavens part and the deluge begins,
"Oh."
Tony snaps out of it and looks pleadingly at Steve.
“I came. I'm here. What do you need?” Steve asks, choosing to cut straight to business. Tony's mouth curls into a barely-there grin.
“Would you take it as terribly offensive if I fell asleep? I think this is the most relaxed I’ve felt without a drink in— well, since this whole ordeal started.”
Tony stops thrashing.
“Just starting to think that?” Daredevil says.
Not to mention that Tony is an engaged man.
He finishes throwing up and shivers.
Tony says, "This isn't even my brand," as if it's some cosmic joke.
“Hm?” Steve twisted his neck and looked where Tony was looking. Then, his ears turned red. “Oh. Yes. Mistletoe. Well. Not really. Hard to come by, out here. But it looks like mistletoe, ‘specially after I tied a ribbon round it, so I thought—”
The grilled cheese sizzles in the pan, and starts to smell a little burnt. Steve had always imagined he would feel really overwhelmed if this moment ever happened outside of his daydreams. Like he wouldn’t know what to say.
It’s quick and dirty, nothing reverent about it except the look in Steve’s face when Tony breathlessly demands he look up at him, holding eye contact as Tony builds to a finish.
If only people could know just how fooled they've been. It’s a clever cover up. It makes Steve want to be sick, seeing Tony’s name dragged through the mud again. Especially speculation about his drinking; that’s the hardest to hear, because through the mess of it all, he’s pretty sure Tony stayed sober. The real Tony, anyways. Maybe he'll never know. It bothers him, distantly. Like an itch.
Between the endless work on legislature and pardons and haggling with politicians, and Steve’s involvement in Tony’s (still a work in progress) recovery, they fall into a sort of comfortable rhythm. Things aren’t like they were before, but they’re not really worse. It’s just different. Steve knows he isn't perfect. He isn't the best caretaker. He doesn't have the training to tiptoe around the trauma in the right ways, and he knows sometimes he does more harm than good. But he learns, and he listens, and he thinks it's going to be okay.
Not to mention the place was full of happy people.
Sheriff Rogers put a lot of time into planning Timely’s Christmas celebration. New to town and new to the job, he didn’t seem to care that Timely wasn’t that kind of town. No, he had been hell bent on giving his town a good Christmas, and Tony couldn’t understand it.
“Is that what the doctors say?”
Steve nods, mouth pressed flat in a tight smile. “Get well. You know where to find me.”
Tony swallows. It isn’t easy, letting himself be vulnerable. If Steve laughed at him, if he gave him that pitying, disgusted look that Natasha had perfected, Tony might just die. He does it anyways.
It happens between the fibers of gauze bandages, and between pages of dense file folders, and fortune cookies, and late nights, and outbursts of weeping in the kitchen politely ignored. No words needed; there had been so many harsh words before, and they had both lived through so much, that Steve thinks, maybe the quiet is what they both really need. When Tony has panic attacks brought on by things that Steve doesn’t understand; he doesn’t ask. He knows he can’t fix it.
“You’re seeing things? Hallucinating?”
“Look at him squirm.”
Steve’s horrified expression faded when he realized Tony wasn’t having regrets about the kiss. Relief and concern replaced the fear.
They both drank. Steve sipped, and Tony gulped. The warmth slid down his throat and spread to his chest. He knocked the rest of the drink back in a hurry to take the sharp edge off the pain. Whiskey sure did the trick better than any herbal concoction Doctor Banner ever offered to him. The alcohol dulled the edges, and Tony started to feel a lot better suited to existing in no time.
There’s a needle in his neck, and it does something strange to him. He feels convulsive, and paralyzed. Extremis glitches, blue screen of death; it is frying his systems. It's frying his brain. Tony gags on his own saliva.
“It’s right and wrong. You’re wrong. This is
, now, even in his own head.
“Still gotta get a word in, huh? Alright. I’d like to see you try talkin’ back without your teeth,” the bandit replied.

“You’re bleeding.”
“Some of it,” Tony says. “There's a lot. You wouldn't believe how much
Tony shivers.
call this stealing. These wallets practically fell into my hands.”
“I’m going to find you,” Steve says.
him. He just wants Ru to— He just wants Jan to— he just wants Steve to—
“Smells burnt,” Tony points out. They’re black on the bottom. He steps toward the stove and turns off the burner. His cheeks feel flushed, and it’s like every bit of skin that touched Tony’s skin is tingling.
Steve gets up off the ground with a poorly hidden wince; he’s hiding more injuries than Tony may have initially thought. Softer, Tony says, “Come on. Trust me, it feels good.”
Seasons change.
. It’s been a long time since either of them have been happy.
He’s a skrull.
“I’m ending it,” Steve says.
Sheriff would see this and it would at least make solving Tony’s own murder a little easier, (and maybe make Rogers feel appropriately guilty for not being around to save Tony’s skin, but that was a secondary concern.) The outlaws encroached closer; Tony was out of time. Using hurried, slashing motions, Tony engraved his own epitaph.
“We’re gonna die,” he says. He should have drank the damn margaritas; God knows the pilot hadn’t deprived himself.
The lilted melody and the slightly off-key piano keys sounded inexplicably like the spirit of
“Ahem,” Steve says, “Jan, maybe we should give these two some space.”
Steve falls silent again, for a moment. Tony keeps his eyes carefully trained on his silhouette far above, against the rapidly darkening sky. The last light has all but seeped away below the horizon.
“I never would have guessed you were so insecure,” Steve says.
-- don’t that just— tickle me pink.”
team. They’re scattered and the world is on fire. Steve's sternum cracks, and a rib, and a jawbone, and, and, and. He sees only Tony.
“Ah, the domineering leader is back,” Tony sighs. Despite the lack of a reaction, he knows Steve doesn’t miss the way Tony says it, a backhanded comment on how eager to get on his knees Steve had been. The memory might just be worth the early grave, a trophy conquest.
Steve extends a hand, and the look on Tony’s
The gang of filthy travelers passing through town, who just so happened to land at the same poker table as Tony this Christmas Eve night, didn’t seem to share his beliefs.
He hasn’t changed clothes or slept since he saw Steve. Come to think of it, he hasn’t had a proper meal, either. The sunrise this morning had been exquisite, and Tony had spent it fighting roiling nausea after a few hours spent terrorized by the nighttime. He keeps refilling the same glass with ginger ale (and pretending there's something more in it.)
“Am I supposed to know what that means?”

If this is death, he wishes suddenly he had fought harder to live. He can’t stand an eternity of this. He never wanted to become a corpse. He’s rotting. Rotting. Rotten.
“So,” Steve slowly comes across the room and lowers himself into the chair beside the bed. “I did breaths and compressions while I waited for the medics. Took them an hour. Apparently, everything’s regulated, nowadays. Can’t even take a shit without the government hearing about it. I asked them, why not just throw down the rope and pull us back up the old fashioned way? They said— they said to me, while I was trying to
Tony doesn’t object; he relaxes into the touch, and he finally catches his breath.
Steve freezes, holding in a breath. Nobody knows how to find him anymore. As well as the world knows, Steve Rogers had fallen off planet Earth months ago. This shouldn’t be possible. His pulse quickens. He sweeps his long, dirty hair out of his eyes and opens the message, squinting at the brightness in the dark.
He fumbles, moving quickly. Tony swallows. “Are we going?” he repeats.
SHIELD hasn’t released the fact that Tony had been replaced by a skrull, likely because they want to avoid mass hysteria— or, less altruistically— they don’t want the skrulls to know that SHIELD now knows. Yet, Tony is obviously gone, and this can't be kept from the public because they're used to seeing him regularly making appearances. It puts SHIELD in a sticky position; they can’t make no statement, and they can’t definitively declare him dead.
Joe stands up and throws the needle at the trash bin full of paper, which has already burned down to ash. Tony spasms weakly on the floor. Tony gags involuntarily, and he hears a record scratch sound, but he isn’t sure if it’s real. Big spots of darkness bloom, ink blots across his vision. Everything splits into fractals.
“Right.”
“Don’t flatter yerself. I’m just here for the drink,” he said, but he didn’t try to sound like he meant it. Obviously, Steve’s party was a hit. Just for the one night, Timely didn’t feel like a dead end. It felt like a home.
Then, he sees something. Steve notices that the padlock on the front door is shiny and new, standing out like a sore thumb from the rust and ruin of the rest of the place.
Steve’s face was upside over Tony’s head, and his dark brows were furrowed it the utmost concentration. The sunrise painted the Sheriff all roses and peach. His stupid long hair caught the light— golden— where it curled at the base of his neck and behind his ears.
but I think I’d rather take my chances.”
Wake up.
It has been so long since he’s immersed himself in a crowd that he feels alien; he wonders if this is how a skrull feels, wearing a human face, but knowing he’s
nothing. Maybe he’s in shock. Maybe he’s lost too much blood. Probably both. He looks to Sam and sees his own lost expression reflected back at him. They’re all lost, now.
"Is what real?" Steve asks, blinking awake. He had dozed off in the office. Tony had been reading something. Steve had been pretending to sign papers, but he had finished hours ago.
hurt people, and he makes his grand exit through a window. He tries not to register the damage he does to the fragile, human bodies between him and his escape. Behind him, the howl of an alarm screams in harmony with the tinkle of shattered glass.
“Mm. I’m right behind you, just gotta limber up,” Tony says. He’s as limp as a rag doll. Steve’s face is lost in its own shadow, but Tony can tell he isn’t smiling. “You don’t believe me?”
“This is real?” he asks without moving his head. He’s almost afraid to look Steve in the eye, in case they’re inky and devilish. He’s had enough terror already. The doors swoosh open and shut and he hears footfall approaching— heels.
"It isn't my brand," Tony says. He sets the bottle back in the cupboard. "I never liked Woodford Reserve."
Tony jams his hand into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled card. A blank business card. It’s written on in Tony’s own penmanship, smudged blue ink, a number.
Steve isn’t going to be happy, and Tony’s head is killing him. Early to the airport and dressed in Tom Ford, Tony makes camp at the bar and slurps at the dregs of a frozen margarita through a curly straw. Breakfast of champions.
Steve doesn’t take it well.
* * *
Surrounded by a sprawl of thick government forms and manilla folders, Tony massages his temples. He mutes his newsfeed, and he shuts down all internal communication capabilities temporarily. Quiet, he just needs quiet. Fifteen more minutes, and maybe he will be able to sleep. God, just a good night's sleep.
“Of course it is.” Steve is resolute, and Tony thinks he understands how Steve was able to lead hundreds. “There’s nothing braver than trying to do something good with the time you’re given. Everyone’s dying. It’s easier to waste it.”
“Don’t do this,” he wheezes, and there’s not an ounce of smugness left. Tony’s voice. A perfect copy.
