In turn, John promised to share his life with Sherlock, to care for him and be his shelter from the world, be the centre of calm he could always return to and translator of the world and conductor of light. For his part, John promised to always patch Sherlock up and keep the scarring to a minimum. This produced a nod of approval from Molly.
John relaxed into his touch, not feeling the need to say a word, but leaned back and closed his eyes. After a few minutes, Sherlock worked the muscles of the left elbow, forearm and finally, the hand. He listened to John’s breathing becoming shallow and slow. Coming to an end, Sherlock left a calming hand on John’s damaged shoulder just for a moment, then started to rise to his feet, his own back and knees complaining at the time spent in this position.
I know this last chapter was a bit different but hope you liked it. Thank you all so much for all your kind words and encouragement. I hope you have had as much fun reading it as I did writing it. Special thanks to DarkLuna and Madam_Fandom. I'm off now to try and write something with absolutely no sex in it, whatsoever.
The man who answered the door took Sherlock’s breath away. The same brown eyes, the same dark hair albeit in a different style, the same smile. This man was expecting him.
to kiss you at that moment, as if my logical mind was not in control of my actions, but my heart, after all these years of being ignored, was going to make its desires known. I do have“ he paused, glancing at John from under his eyelashes “some reservations. Concerns. As I have explained, my previous experiences were not entirely positive and I would be grateful if we could take the physical side slowly, give me time to adjust”.
The sensation washing over him is utterly overwhelming. He is sinking and flying both at the same time. The chatter of their guests suddenly rings loudly in his ears. The smell of the leftover pasta and steaks on the table, the cake crumbs on his lap, reek and sting his nose. Angelo’s is oppressively stuffy and the coloured fairy lights reflecting back in from the darkened windows are too bright. Sherlock freezes.
Sherlock nods but frowns slightly, perfectly able to remember his short-lived foray into gardening but trying to pin down how old he had been at the time,
Michael laughed. “Don’t be daft. I’m long over you. I don’t see the problem. Why don’t you just ask him out?” He poured them both a cup of strong tea, added 3 sugars to Sherlock’s, hesitated, then put one in his own. He suspected this conversation was going to be hard work.
“I’m sorry John, here” Sherlock handed him a cold pack from the first aid kit John insisted they keep in the kitchen.
Michael had reopened a door on the hope that Sherlock had so firmly slammed shut that night in Angelo’s and John flitted from the vision of Sherlock draped over the sofa to being in full flight as they chased a suspect, the muscles of his long thighs flexing as he ran.
“Bring me to your bed,” John huffed into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock said nothing but opened the door that led into his room. For a moment he was brought up short by the bright light pouring in the window. It had finally stopped raining and the sun was making a valiant effort to appear through the dark clouds. He turned and looked at John, shy despite being the one dressed. In the broad daylight he saw the heat and intent in John’s eyes.
Mrs. Hudson held out her arms to take Charlotte who was dozing in the crook of Sherlock’s arm. He shook his head at her slightly and simply moved the baby to his left shoulder so he could still use the mobile in his right hand. He pulled up a number and dialled.
What he had not found, much to his annoyance, were any traces of human hair or skin, or any evidence that it been cleaned at any time.
It was then that Sherlock does something that John will remember until he is a very old man, the image seared into his brain, available to him in technicolour every time he thinks of the day their relationship moves towards marriage. Sherlock leans forward, supporting himself with his hands on the arms of John’s chair, undulates his arse and looks over his shoulder at John.
“Mine,” growls John and he begins to fuck Sherlock hard, making sure he hits his prostate with every thrust. Sherlock’s hand flies on his own needy cock as he growls John’s name, his arse pushing back, spine curved and head thrown back. He comes first, hard, covering the back of John’s chair in spurts. John comes three or four thrusts later, his arm wrapping around Sherlock’s belly to keep him upright. His own knees buckle and he unceremoniously pulls out as they fall to the floor, panting and laughing.
Sherlock had opened his eyes and found himself still on the sofa. It had all been a dream, he had fallen asleep in his Mind Palace. He sat at up and went to make tea.
In the end, John had more reservations than Sherlock about caring for a baby. Sherlock knew the pain of withdrawal and all he could think about was this poor, tiny baby experiencing that from the moment they were born. They sat in front of the fire going back and forth until 3 am, outlining all the changes they would have to make. Uppermost in John’s mind was the fact that the mother may take the child back at any time. He wasn’t sure if he could face that.
Unable to focus on anything useful, he started wiping down the kitchen walls and cabinets, and then realising he too was covered in melon splatters, showered and dressed. His phone was flashing a missed call notification at him when he emerged from his bedroom and he leapt on the phone, hoping it was John but discovering it was Lestrade. Sherlock rang him back.
The pace of rocking increases, John simply holding his thigh firmly in place allowing Sherlock to control all the movement. Occasionally, John flexes his quad, sending shivers down Sherlock’s spine as he revels in the heat, the coarseness of the hairs and the pleasure he gets from having his own thighs held wide. Sherlock feels the grip of his orgasm start to build, deep down near his balls, that pulse broadening and spreading. His rutting becomes hard and animalistic, the sweat gathering on his belly making his cock slide as he presses his abdomen as close to John’s as he can get.
“Shine your light in at the back. Yes, Ah ha!” Sherlock leaned over and grabbed the handle of a croquet mallet hidden under a pile of wood at the very back of the shed. As he stood and turned rapidly, pulling out the mallet he came face to face with John standing behind him, arm in the air holding up his phone. Sherlock looked at him for just a fraction of a second, nodded slightly to himself, leaned over and kissed John.
“John, I am an extraordinary man.” Laughter ripples across the room. Sherlock smiles too, just for John. “At least, that is what you always tell me. You tell me I am a genius; brilliant, astounding, beautiful. These things will never cease to surprise me. I am only these things in your eyes and only because you have made me that way. You have given me a reason to be the best that I can be, to push my genius, to leave behind my self-destructive ways and become a better man. My love for you is wrapped into the DNA of every one of my cells. When I die, it will become part of the atoms of the universe and exist forever, nothing will ever be able to destroy it. We have already proven that.”
“Well, we both had a few too many pints and I headed off to the loo. He followed me and waited outside. When I came out, he sort of lunged at me and the next thing I knew we were kissing”.
“You have met my sons. We have had to come to certain agreements over the years as to the nature of their protection. Mycroft not so much but Sherlock hates the intrusion. He only goes along with it because he has seen the consequences for his eldest brother. He is allowed to make his own mistakes but we make sure he lives. Molly knew you were waiting for him in that office and was in the ambulance on its way before anyone called for it. She stabilised him and saved his life, the same way she protected him after his fall from Barts. Molly Hooper has been watching you for a very long time. I suggest you keep away from her”.
“Sherlock. What is wrong?” John calmly asked. He had was a bit wary about what that huge brain may have talked itself into.
Sherlock stretches in every direction, arms above his head, legs as wide as he can get them, the right one falling off the edge of the bed in the process. Most of him hurts. Some, in a good way; muscles with a very specific purpose that have not been used for a long time; his cock is slightly raw, his arse tender and he has a sore spot on his neck where he suspects John bit him.
Sherlock smiled and between small, feathery kisses on John’s eyelids, cheeks and nose explained “I wore it for you. I’m glad you like it”.
They were stood waiting on the front doorstep when the car glided to a halt in front of them. John was resplendent in his dark blue suit, white shirt and a pale golden tie. Sherlock had decided on mid grey, with waistcoat, a new white shirt and even a tie. John was concentrating very hard on not dribbling from anywhere.
John pulled Sherlock into a deep kiss, his hands roaming over the tight shirt and up under the back of the jacket, pulling Sherlock close into him. John fumbled with his own trousers and took Sherlock’s hand and pushed it inside to his erect cock. Taken completely by surprise, Sherlock tried to withdraw his hand but John gripped the wrist hard.
In their many long years together people had often passed comment to John on those eyes. For some it was the straightforward beauty of their pale colour, sometimes blue, sometimes green with their splashes of gold and indigo. For others, their fascination had been in the way that a side long glance could pin you to the ground and a full on stare could slice through you, take the words from your mouth and leave you feeling like you were six again.
An apology was such a rare thing from Sherlock and, for once, this was not his fault. If John had not insisted on entering the room first, Sherlock’s coat would have been on the receiving end, instead. Who could possibly predict a door booby trapped with a miniature flame thrower inside a school? Sherlock’s quick thinking had saved John from getting burned and his suit had borne the brunt. Problem was, this was his only suit, bought just six weeks previously on his discharge to wear at job interviews. It didn’t matter that it had been a cheap, off-the-peg suit from a department store, it had still taken a big dollop of his money at the time. He would need to get a new one. John sighed again.
Molly pulled the sheet down from the corpse’s head “It’s the fracture. It’s a very particular shape. Perfectly round. I was unable to identify what weapon may have been used to cause such a fracture, did you find anything at the scene?”
“I would open another button, and maybe one more if needed. Just enough space to let me drift my hand inside your shirt so I could touch your nipple. The left one first, I think. I would drift my fingers over it and make it…”
“No actual explosion. Just a match near my eyebrow. I had vaseline on each side to stop it spreading.”
Ordinarily, Sherlock would have little interest in such articles, dismissing them as ‘irrelevant, John, just opinions and anecdotes masquerading as fact’. Much to Sherlock’s surprise, this one was actually based on a properly designed scientific long-term study of 373 couples married since 1986 and demographically representative of the American population. What began as academic interest changed when he read the very first piece of data; 46 percent of the marriages studied had ended in divorce.
It was only as John hurriedly turned to shove the bag of apricots out of site on the top shelf of a high cupboard that he realised he had spent that entire phone conversation staring at Sherlock’s naked arse.
It was a small sigh and a shuffle in the Moses basket that brought their actions to a sudden halt. In unison, they lifted their heads from the pillows and listened, both holding their breath. Emilia merely turned her head and stayed asleep.
John turned his head away from Sherlock sharply. He had nothing to say, couldn’t find the words to express the extent of the damage the wound had done, the way it had decimated his life, his identity and his career.
“I am aware of that, John. I am familiar with how human reproduction works.” Now that he has come to the realisation that being a parent is something he wants, Sherlock is nervous about John’s reaction. Nervousness always makes him snide. Out of habit, he prepares himself for disappointment and gathers his old protective layers about him.
Sherlock spent most of the journey glancing at John out of the corner of his eye. It was plain that John was struggling with some internal conflict but Sherlock had no idea of its nature. He wanted just to ask but had decided to wait until they were home at least. It was plain, however, that John was not at all happy and Sherlock was not pleased by this. Whatever the problem, they would address it together. Sherlock wondered if he would then be able to persuade John to cook.
“Still no change. They are talking about maybe moving him to a different part of the hospital, a less high support unit”.
“Laura. Laura Hudson. She is Mrs. Hudson’s daughter and I haven’t seen her since the three of us left America.”
Anthea walked towards them, stunning in an off-the-shoulder tea dance dress in a pale gold. The dress was cinched at the waist and then bloomed out with petticoats. Her hair was down, covering her shoulders and she wore four inch stilettos in matching pale gold.  She walked slowly towards the two men. John frowned enquiringly at Sherlock who merely shrugged. As she approached, John realised this was the first time he had ever seen the woman without her mobile in her hand. Instead she carried a small posy of golden yellow and cream roses.
Eoin Fitzgerald had never heard of Sherlock Holmes, let alone Dr. Watson and he was somewhat unclear on why either man would be interested in a ninety year old mystery which was, in turn, related to a one thousand year old puzzle.
Sherlock was a little taken aback by the openness of his older brother. His exile had changed him. He was still a Holmes though and saw Sherlock’s surprise and beamed again.
Sherlock fucked up into his hand and John reached down, pressing his own perineum, hips pumping. Then with a sharp cry Sherlock threw his head back and came hard, semen shooting over his hand and chest. The sight pushed John over the edge and he came, leaning forward and making sure his own come covered Sherlock’s chest, belly and neck.
“Exactly, but we're still on good terms. He's a very interesting man. Y’know he once spent two whole weeks here observing who bought what type of underwear. Even made a colour-coded spreadsheet. By the end, he reckoned he could tell someone’s sexuality just from the waistband of their pants.” Michael dropped to his knees in front of John. “Just going to measure the leg now.”
As they eat, the peculiar tonal drone begins again. John peers around, thinking maybe there is a wasp or bluebottle trapped in the room. Sherlock shakes his head then nods at Mycroft who is busy washing up the pan he used to cook the eggs. John realises the noise is coming from Mycroft. He seems to be
It was one of his favourite journals, full of useful information such as the latest research into the signs of psychopathy or how the effects of trauma can be passed down from parent to child. The occasional high-functioning sociopath even turned up. Today’s email, however, fell into the category of relationship psychology and was entitled ‘How to Work at your Marriage: 5 Steps to a Successful Relationship’.
John shook his head. Sherlock could see there were tears on John’s cheeks. He was unsure if this was down to the physical pain but suspected it may be more. Taking a deep breath, he offered:
Still no response. He made two cups of tea and handed one to Sherlock as he moved to sit in the empty chair,
“Well relationships with sex usually mean lots of negotiation, misunderstandings, arguments and anger. Sulking and cajoling, frustration and disappointment, don’t they? Oh and flowers. I don’t want that with you John”. The memories came at him all at once, the shouting and tears, his own confusion. His initial joy at John’s announcement began to ebb away.
John falls onto his side. He wraps himself around Sherlock, knee over thigh, arm over chest, head in the Sherlock-perfumed crook of his neck. His own orgasm already obtained, they fall into a satisfied and silent haze.
Sherlock whirled into the room, all coat and arrogance. He ignored Anderson who stepped back out of his way with a sigh. Sherlock bent down and carefully examined the body, leaping from head to feet and back again. John loved this bit, loved to stand back and watch Sherlock do his deducting dance, as he thought of it, neurons sparking, hands elucidating his findings and eyes flitting and glowing.
“Hello Sherlock. How’s things?” As always, Michael beamed. His trimmed and shaped beard was new since Sherlock had seen him last and it suited him. He came around from behind the counter to give Sherlock a brief hug.
Sherlock tore off his pyjama top and ran his hands over his chest, arching up to reveal as much of the ivory skin as he could. He dropped his hands to his nipples, hard with the breeze from the open window and groaned as he pinched them. One hand lay on his stomach and the other moved down, caressing his own balls but not touching his rock hard dick. He lifted his hips up slightly, bending his knees and ostentatiously flaunting himself at John, trying to tempt him.
Sherlock came in slowly. He glanced at the broken window and Mary lying on the floor. He sat down near to John but not touching.
Sherlock bucked into John’s mouth, one hand gripping at the headboard, the other clutching at the folds of his dressing gown. John removed his mouth for a moment, but maintained his rhythm with his left hand.
“So, we have no suspects, no murder weapon, no motive, no idea how they got into the flat. We know it wasn’t poison and we know no-one else has a key to the flat. What we
“I have a new life now. I have changed. I met someone who changed me, showed me that love is an advantage.”
Rolling onto his left side he props his head up on his hand as he closely examines John; sleepy eyes, hair sticking up in all directions, crumpled face and, he drops his hand over the top of the blanket to check, an impressive morning erection. Good.
“May my colleague and I look at your garden?” Sherlock interrupted suddenly and not waiting for a reply nodded at John to follow him out the French doors.
“Yeah, alright. I suppose I was holding back a bit. I just wanted to make sure you were having a good time, you were alright. You know, safe and comfortable”
The next slap came lengthways and John’s fingers caught the base of Sherlock’s penis. He gasped and groaned and John, still stood next to him, held Sherlock’s cock firmly in his left hand as he ran his right over the now sensitive bottom.
Anthea headed back to the door John and Sherlock had arrived through. The Queen took a seat at the front. John elbowed Sherlock in the ribs and through the power of eyebrows alone asked him what the hell they were supposed to do. Sherlock took his hand and approached The Queen.
“You said, in front of Lestrade and Stamford, not to mention a pub packed full of people, that I had a beautiful and big dick!”
John looked at the SIG in his hand. He hadn’t realised he was still holding it. He let it slide to the floor where it landed with a small thunk. Sherlock put just his head around the door. At the sight of him, a tear began to roll down John’s face.
I make no apologies for being a bit of a romantic and so this is my favourite chapter so far. I hope you like it too. As a special treat, below is a pic I found of how I imagine John looks at Sherlock across the table.
Then something unexpected happened. From the outset, they had been told that it was very unusual for anyone to be asked to foster a baby. Sometimes they may come with siblings, but on the whole, foster care was for needed for older children. Then one Tuesday, at about three in the afternoon, Sue phoned John:
If John had been surprised by the proceedings of the day so far, he was absolutely gobsmacked to see Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade striding purposefully down the room, arm in arm with Anthea. He was beaming at the small gathering but his biggest smile was saved for Mycroft, as Greg came to a stop by his side. Anthea took up her position at Mycroft’s right elbow. It was only then that it dawned on John and Sherlock that she was acting as Mycroft’s Best Woman.
“It’s procedure mate. We have to stick to it or else whole cases are lost at court. You know that. Now, have you met the deceased before?”
“Again, there were no indications that there was…. Oh, John, you need to turn around!” Sherlock took John by the shoulder, spinning him so he could reach John’s back, and landed a sound slap on John’s arse,
John grinned at him. They had agreed to take things very slowly and had not progressed much beyond vast quantities of snogging on the sofa, hand holding, hair stroking and fully clothed cuddling. John was quite happy just to be able to have Sherlock close and had not pushed things any further. He had accepted that if this was all Sherlock ever wanted that he could deal with any outstanding matters himself.
“Whenever things are at their worst, open this and remember that there is more to this world than can be deduced and explained by logic. Some things just are”.
Second story of the day for the prompt 'Kisses', which means I am now back on track with the challenge.
John paused just for moment. The last twenty two years had changed him, the past year in particular. John Watson no longer held back on what he wanted to do or say, it had only caused him pain and regret in the past. He had once again looked death squarely in the face and made himself a promise that day. He reached up and very gently stroked the face of his old friend, tracing the line of the scar.
John spun on the spot to once again regard himself in the mirror. He went up on his tiptoes irrespective of the fact that he would still only be able to see from his waist up. He turned back to face Sherlock. “Is it too tight? God, I haven’t seen the trousers prop- Um. Sherlock, your sheet, it’s…” John gestured down in the general direction of Sherlock’s middle. They both looked down. Sherlock’s sheet had developed a bit of a gape and the parting of the fabric revealed that Sherlock had a full, straining erection.
“In about three weeks but she could go into labour anytime really. Thanks John. You will make a real difference here”.
“Yes. Statues. Like the ones Michelangelo made,” and with that he pulled down Sherlock’s pyjamas and began to use his teeth to delicately stroke the very top of Sherlock’s now rock hard cock. He was rewarded with a deep growl and long drawn out groan of delight. He brought his hand down to stroke Sherlock’s balls before giving in to his own greatest delight and buried hs face in them, kissing, nibbling and licking. God, how loved that musky scent. Sherlock moaned an unintelligible unnnggg.
This time Sherlock couldn’t decide if he was hallucinating or not and frankly, he didn’t care. He decided that if he was hearing things, he would blame his next act entirely on concussion. But if he wasn’t then… Ignoring his doctor’s good advice, Sherlock lifted his arms and pulled John down until their lips met and they kissed, the most longed for and wondrous kiss of Sherlock’s life.
He became peripherally aware that he may have drawn some attention. A couple of teenage girls to his left were nudging each other and nodding their heads towards him. A smartly dressed woman narrowly avoided hitting him with her trolley as she leaned past him with a sigh to remove a packet and throw it into the trolley. Sherlock glared at her for the intrusion.
"I tried, John". Sherlock flounced to his feet, striding to the kitchen and flicking the kettle on. John sent up a silent prayer of thanks. "He wouldn't settle. He doesn't like me." Sherlock turned his back to John, pulling out mugs and tea bags.
“Yes, the most delightful necrotic hands, John. Two of them, a matching pair! She really is the most extraordinary friend. John. John! John?”
Busily consulting his shopping list, John systematically worked his way through his ingredient list for the cauliflower dahl, spiced lentils, Bombay potato salad and poppadums. He had even decided to have a go at making his own lime and mango chutneys. Dessert would be an exotic fruit salad and yogurt. It had been the dessert that had led to the greatest debate.
“You were smouldering, John. My apologies. Indeed, I believe apologies may be in order all round." Sherlock nodded at what remained of John’s suit; the full right sleeve was missing, as was the left shoulder, most of the bottom half of the jacket and a large proportion of the bottom half of both legs.
“Usual things all missing – no obvious cause of death, no history of depression, popular, outgoing bloke, lots of friends, apparently a busy social life. We can’t rule it out until we get the autopsy results but I’m keeping an open mind”
I am happy to say that I have never used any illegal substance and have certainly never injected drugs. I also chose not to google that, because I didn't really need to see it. So any inaccuracies I will take full responsibility for.
The line went quiet. “He’s fighting for his life, John,” Alison’s voice cracked. She took a deep breath, “I have to go. I have others to call. Get the antibiotics. Please stay in touch.”
“Hello,” Sherlock dips in for a gentle kiss. His hand smooths John’s back and rests on his shoulder just above John’s medal ribbons.
Sherlock strides forward and plants a blistering kiss on John’s lips but has to pull back after a minute to giggle. John giggles in reply and they hold each other tight. This is the most ridiculous conversation and yet, Sherlock suspects, it’s the most beautiful, romantic, down right loveliest conversation he will ever have in his life.
“I think she probably just wants her, er, you”. Sherlock took Charlotte who immediately stopped crying. He arched an eyebrow at her while cradling her, lifting her high up into his chest. Undoing his jacket button so it wouldn’t dig into her he faced Charlotte’s small body into his and whispered into her delicate ear “Don’t worry. I know where he is and Daddy is
Sherlock crouched next to the incubator and studied the tiny child intensely. She began to move her legs, awakening slightly. Sherlock smiled and whispered:
“So, you devised a number of ways to hurt yourself, each escalating in severity to see how I would respond. You also made sure each experiment hurt a part of you lower and lower on your body.”
"Hmm, broad shoulders compared to your waist, we'll have to make sure we emphasise that tapering," Michael noted. An image of Sherlock came to John, long and lean in his own suit. In the few weeks since they had first met, he had rarely seen Sherlock in the same suit twice.
When Sherlock still hadn’t emerged from his room, John decided to have a shower. As the warm water washed away the toxins from the night before, John started to consider what Sherlock had said. For a man as private as his lover usually was, especially about such things as relationships and sex, John could concede that maybe he had been out of order, although it had been unintentional.
They headed out into the rainy night together, chatting amiably as they strode along Baker Street, John leaned over and gave Sherlock a quick peck as they went their separate ways.
Despite John’s best shushing and jiggling efforts, Johanna began to cry as soon as they got out of the car. In the flat, Sherlock immediately deduced the lack of sleep and last vestiges of patience from John’s face, although it was so obvious a short-sighted, two fingered sloth could have made the same deduction. Sherlock held out his arms for the crying child and sent John to his own room for a nap. It took two minutes and twenty six seconds for Sherlock to settle Johanna and John slept for four solid, unbroken hours. He awoke like a new man. A man with a plan.
He slips on his shoes, shined with military conviction, and reaches for his dress uniform jacket. The buttons have had to be moved out slightly; he has filled out a bit in the years since discharge and, of course, he had to have the hidden pocket added. The jacket makes him stand just that bit straighter and taller, the scarlet giving his skin a glow. Adding the belt and hat, he gives his reflection a salute, just to make sure he can still do it right.
“When you say you and Sherlock were close, do you mean…? I mean, sorry, it's just he said something to me that gave me the impression he wasn't…”
“Sir are you in there?” shouted Anthea. Mary could just about make out a muffled response. They had found them.
“Brilliant” John smirked. “Amazing”. Sherlock turned to him with a gleam in his eye. Just for a moment, John thought he was going to be kissed “How exactly did you get that from an apricot?”
After much consideration, it was agreed that Sunday would be the best time to try weaning. There would be no time pressure and the research Sherlock had done indicated that there may be some clearing up required. The previous day, the three had gone on a shopping spree. A new high chair was invested in, a smart wooden one that would later covert into a toddler chair and table, new bibs, spoons that changed colour when they were too hot for a baby, ice cube trays, lidded plastic containers, a new blender and lots and lots of baby wipes. They then went to the greengrocers and bought organic pears, apples, avocados, potatoes, carrots and parsnips. John’s hand had hovered over the apricots only to feel Sherlock’s eyes boring in to him.
John smiled back, a little dazed at Sherlock’s openness about his feelings. He was about to reply when they were interrupted by Eva popping her head around the door. She smiled when she spotted them lurking in the shadows.
Reaching the privacy of 221 Baker Street at last, the second they were inside the front door, John took Sherlock firmly by the hand and led him upstairs to their flat. He had been heading for the sofa, but Sherlock had other ideas, pushing John up against the wall. Sherlock kissed him reverently, at first and John relaxed into him, stroking his arms as he had wanted to do all day.
John wasn’t convinced but his plans with Greg and Mike to go for a few pints had been made weeks ago when Greg had been at a bit of a low ebb. It was generally admitted that John didn’t ‘come out to play’ all that often anymore and a twinge of guilt mixed with the simple desire to have a few beers had won him over. That had all been fine when he had expected Sherlock to be having a quiet night at home, waiting for him, but now things had changed. Having spent most of his day on the sofa, thinking, Sherlock had come up with new idea to advance their latest case and wanted to head out to do some, quite literal, digging.
“Work?” John shook his head slightly, but thinking more about external lines of sight and wondering how Mary had known to hide her gun here.
Sherlock felt that he was already excelling at this step. John already had very few expectations of Sherlock to help with daily chores, cook food or even reach for his own phone. Immediately, he stood from the sofa, brought the cold mugs of tea to the sink, emptied them and rinsed them under the tap. He momentarily thought of drying them but felt that might be a bit excessive. He resolved to do this at least every second day. In the end, he actually managed it twice that week plus helping John by reminding him they needed milk.
John, in turn, would assess Sherlock’s pain by his own observations and bullying him into a verbal acknowledgement of its existence. A hot water bottle under the small of the back on the sofa or a warm bath were the usual prescriptions. Maybe once every six months, John would unlock the bag and give Sherlock a codeine tablet of his own.
!” John watched in amazement as Sherlock stood and pranced back to his own room, slamming the door behind him.
“Yes, damn it. Feelings. About John. That make me want to…” Sherlock stood up with such force that he shoved the chaise longue backwards. He made a step towards the top of the staircase only to be cut off by Jacob bringing them a tray of tea. He stomped back and plopped back down on his seat. The frustration and annoyance dissipated and he met Michael’s eyes for the first time. “What do I do, Michael? You know how useless I am at this. He is the first person to ever have this effect on me. Oh... I’m sorry, was that-?"
“When we get home, I would like to do something I have often, often thought about” his voice was thicker now.
Sherlock’s hands hovered at his pyjama waistbands, awash with uncertainty, heart pounding. He suddenly wanted to run away. He avoided John’s ravenous gaze, looked at his feet and, not for the first time in his life, wondered what was wrong with him.
“Yours is my absolute favourite. The nicest, prettiest, most talented and,” he took a deep breath “largest I have ever seen.” he gave said penis an admiring pat, only to find it quite hard, clearly enjoying being the centre of attention and praise.
hard at his marriage, he decided to tell John. They were in the middle of a heated, but healthy, conflict over the loss of John’s old, and he claimed, favourite jumpers, when Sherlock chose to tell his husband of his plan to improve their marriage.
“Please, John if you would be so kind,” Mycroft condescended. John’s husband, on the other hand, quivered slightly, glared once more at his brother and moved swiftly to John, kissing him gently on the temple and running his hand down from John’s shoulder to his waist where it came to rest. This was a bit not good, John knew. This was Sherlock’s “hold me back before I kill someone” position, his “this is your last chance to reason with me before I give my lower brain permission to take over”, or in John’s own shorthand “The Donovan Manoeuvre”.
“Victor,” they both said in unison. It was John’s turn to sigh. One day, he thought, just one day I am going to get my hands on that nasty, abusive little rat and, God help me, I’m going to kill him.
“I meant it Sherlock, when I said we would take it slowly. Tell me what you would like. Right now. What can I do for you?”
John lifted his head and looked at Greg. He wasn’t laughing or shocked or showing any kind of emotion. He really did seem to want to understand. John let out a long, deep sigh.
Laying the tray down, Eoin offers round the pre-milked tea, pausing only to add three sugars to his own. John is struck by the injustice that all the skinny blokes he knows seem to be the ones with the sweetest tooth. His theory is only confirmed as he watches both Eoin and Sherlock grab not one, but two, biscuits each. The biscuits themselves are new to John; a rectangular base, they have a line of jam down the middle with pink, fluffy bobbles in lines on either side. According to the packet, they are called Kimberleys. Sherlock clearly approves, as he shoves a whole one straight into his mouth.
The need to make Sherlock his shocks John with its force.  He tears out of his own jeans and T-shirt, shoes and underwear and is behind Sherlock again, pressing every inch of himself into the taller man. His hard cock presses into the crack of that plush arse and Sherlock wiggles back on him as John grinds forward. His hands slide over those shoulders to Sherlock’s hair and pull, just the right side of pain as he licks a broad stripe down Sherlock’s spine.
saying hitting them both. Fuck, how long had he felt this way? How long had he been in love with Sherlock Holmes?
John slides a hand under the blanket and over Sherlock’s chest, fingertips gliding lightly over the individual ribs, the curve at the bottom of each pectoral muscle, the lines of his clavicle, up over the top of each shoulder. It’s like John is trying to draw him.
Acknowledging the driver’s report, Mycroft gazes out of the small window. He considers all his baby brother has been through. Mycroft had believed that Sherlock and John had been able to find a way through all the lies and betrayals. Maybe he had been wrong. He will give it another five minutes before deciding what to say to John. He returns to the small group. A practised blank expression on his face, he schools himself not to react when John frowns at his watch and turns anxiously to the entrance.
“Lestrade, what abomination is this! I insist you release John immediately. How dare you insinuate he is in any way involved in something as unpleasant as this? If you do not I shall have to..”
They climbed the spiral staircase to the fitting room, where Sherlock took residence in the middle of the rococo silver and black chaise longue, crossing his legs and spreading his coat out on either side of him. Michael pulled up a matching chair.
Moving to the bathroom, he began to run John a bath and went back to the front room to instruct John to go and get in. John smiled his thanks and obediently did as he was told.
“You are having second thoughts. Would you have told me of your attraction if your hand had not been forced by this case?” Sherlock was calm.
been going in the right direction with his experiment. The naked arse had been a triumph. Oh, but that meant that the researcher had, in fact, influenced the outcome, changed the subject’s behaviour – ah Mycroft would never let him hear the end of such a mistak.. No, do not think of Mycroft. Where was I? Yes John and sex. Do I want sex with John? What else does he want? Does he just want sex? What kind of sex? Do I want sex with anyone? Do I want sex with John?  Already asked that one. I may need more data.
Sherlock grinned at him “How could you? We had the time of our lives! The running and chasing, the investigations and winding up Lestrade, back when we were young. It all seems so long ago but it keeps me warm at night. I have missed you every day John Watson”
John was relieved to know Sherlock was okay and surprised that his partner had been aware enough to know he would be worried. He texted back:
The following year Michael submitted a charcoal grey suit paired with an tightly-fitted aubergine shirt and a dramatic full-length wool coat as his piece for the Final Year show, modelled by a taciturn Consulting Detective. He graduated with a First.
“Oh, same as usual. Kids being let down by those that brought them into the world and then spend their lives punishing the kid for existing.” She wiped her face tiredly.”Sorry, John. This one’s worse than usual.”
For just a moment he considered running, far, far away from this living ghost, but what good would that do? Where would he run to anyway?
John squeezes Sherlock’s hand. For so many years now he has been Sherlock’s dinghy in the churning seas of human emotions, guiding him back to safe land. In this particular instance though, John is himself buffeted and dragged along by unseen currents. One thing he does know though is that they need to address this before they have any hope of a successful marriage. Not to would leave them unmoored on shifting sands. He decides to leave his analogy there as it seems to be getting away from him a bit.
“Well, if it was me,” Michael side-eyed Sherlock whilst sipping his tea, “I’d suggest going somewhere he could wear his new suit. Which is rather fabulous, if I do say so myself.”
Evan Armitage spun to face the intruders, his powerful legs powering him round, brandishing the sports trophy like a hockey stick and bringing it up at speed, making contact with Lestrade’s head with a splintering thunk, knocking him flat on his back. John dove to Greg’s side.
“That doesn’t have to be the way it goes. I have had my fair share of relationships go sour but I’ve had some brilliant ones too. Look at Sarah, we’re still friends aren’t we? No restraining orders there.” he tried to lighten the mood “Also, for the record, I won’t need flowers. You asked if I want a relationship with you. What I want, now I think about it, it is for us to carry on exactly the way we are, but with me allowed to touch you and you touch me, if that is what you want. I mean, we already take care of each other, we go out to eat, have fun, we work brilliantly well together and that’s exactly what I want to carry on doing with you”.
“Very good. Not long now and it will be all over”. He hugged her quickly and scooping Charlotte up, he headed for the front door, only to be met by two police cars when he opened it. Four uniformed officers poured in and Sherlock climbed into the other car. Sirens blaring, they headed back to the cabbies office.
“I need you to see me for the man I have always been,” Sherlock said quietly, not meeting John’s annoyed gaze, “I am still Sherlock Holmes, not some delicate flower. We have won this, John. I am home and in our bed and for the longest time we didn’t know if that would ever happen again. Don’t you see?”
“That’s what this is about? Love? You think this is love!” John was keeping one ear open for a helicopter. He needed to keep her talking.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, turning to look at John directly. ”Never under appreciate my regard for either yourself or your daughter, John.”
On the second floor of the College a small group of people gathers around John; giving hugs and congratulations. Mycroft is mid-conversation with his father when the voice in his ear brings him up short. Glancing at John, he excuses himself and steps into the small anteroom he has been using as his base. The British Government doesn’t even take a day off for his brother’s wedding.
Quickly moving from room to room he checked the kitchen, bathroom and their bedroom. Running upstairs he scanned Charlotte’s nursery. Although she had yet to sleep there, still being so small, it was full of the clothes and toys they had bought and been given as presents. Nothing was moved or missing from any of the rooms.
Sherlock breathed out a long, deep sigh “Not you”, he admitted talking to his own toes “but, others.”
John's strokes became faster now and he gazed at his reflection through half-closed eyes for as long as he could. He closed his eyes at last and threw back his head, legs shaking, sweat gathering between his pecs as his first flew over his cock. At his orgasm flooded over him, he whispered Sherlock's name.
Eoin passes Sherlock another document, this time a map of the route Doyle was believed to have taken. As he does so, he winks at John. They both watch Sherlock for a moment as he realises that Doyle’s route is the same one John has planned for their own trip. Sherlock pretends to study the map for longer than is really necessary as he takes in this fact, his heart swelling. This is possibly the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for Sherlock and he is rather overwhelmed. He looks at John from under his eyelashes for a moment; his new husband is gazing back fondly. Sherlock wishes Eoin Fitzgerald would disappear, but as they are in his office, that seems unlikely. He makes a decision and gathers himself.
The text galvanised him into action. He needed more specialised help. Coat flying as he spun into action and narrowly missing falling over a toddler, Sherlock headed into the smaller shop three doors down. Here he breathed a sigh of relief, the selection was much smaller and more to the point there was expert help available, it said so on the sign over the counter.
“Mycroft already sent in an armed response unit” Lestrade panted next to him “There’s a sniper behind the building, one on the roof and now two out here. Don’t worry, she’s not getting out of here”.
Michael rested back on his heels, tape measure in his lap and threw back his head and laughed. “Did he give you that ‘married to his work’ line? Yeah, don’t mind that. He’s just a bit shy. He clearly likes you to have moved you in. I never got past the front door.” Michael returned to his measuring “And I can see why he likes you.” He grinned. “You are a gentleman of significance, if you don’t mind me saying so. Sorry, sorry, that was a bit unprofessional. Ignore me. I’m just a bit giddy that Sherlock has found someone. I do worry about him.”
So it was only when the phone rang then that John spotted the previous two missed calls from Alison, the manager of the crèche that they occasionally used. He realised the calls had been made one immediately after the other. He frowned as he answered, already on edge that she was calling so early and on a Sunday.
Sherlock responded immediately, wanting to show John he was still the man John loved, not some damaged, weakened version.
“My preliminary research would indicate very little except that you are the pre-eminent expert. John considers it worthy of my attention. He is rarely wrong. Please, Professor Fitzgerald, what can you tell me?”
A deep chuckle from the sofa brought John's head up just in time to see Angus with his new treasure turning around and around on Sherlock's lap, wrapping himself in the new comforter. Sherlock was a little flushed and as John realised what Angus had stolen, he felt his own colour rise. There, in Sherlock's lap, was a tiny Jack Russell puppy, wrapped in John's smallest, tightest pair of red pants.
“John, I’m here, I’m alive. I didn’t leave you. You know I wouldn’t do that to you, never again. I came back to you. I’m yours. Always yours.”
“Sherlock, fuck off!” yelled the older brother, yanking his hand from the top of Annie’s T-shirt and trying to grab him. Sherlock recovered from his momentary shock and took off again at whirlwind speed back up the path, past the orchard, careening into the summer house.
This was partly inspired by my husband, who like Sherlock, is not given to terms of endearment or pet names. It means that the odd time he uses one it brings me up short with delight.
John was a bit stumped at that because feelings were supposed to be his department and he had honestly not seen any difference at all from Mycroft’s usual bland expression,
“I generated the allergic reaction myself. It had nothing to do with the crime scene. I am allergic to a particular type of pollen so I bought a sample of it and rubbed it around the inside of my mouth and eyes.”
He woke with a start, sitting bolt upright in bed, the hair on the back of his neck standing on end and heart pounding. He strained to hear something, anything in the silence.
John laid his forehead down on the back of Sherlock’s hand, warm and soft. He spent hours each day holding and stroking that hand and had noticed that the callouses on the fingers were beginning to soften. Last week he had brought clippers in and trimmed the nails. One of the nurses had offered to do it but he preferred to do that small thing for Sherlock.
“I want you to...” Sherlock squirms, trying to move, “I need you to fill me with your come. Please!”
Ignoring the calls from around the table to stay, John stands, pulling Sherlock to his feet. Sherlock has already put on his own jacket and helps ease John into his uniform, gently smoothing the line across the back of the shoulders. Without a backward glance at their guests, they unlock the door and step out into the cool, late spring evening.
John Watson levered himself up, groaning at the stiffness in his knees and followed Sherlock out of the door.
“Well, yes. That’s what the law of the time said. Hand it over and be financially compensated by the state. However, things were not that simple at the time. Ireland was still under British rule and James was damned if he was handing over what he believed were ancient Irish treasures to the British Government. Instead, he cleaned it and hid it. He told his wife and children and that was it; the hoard was not seen again for thirty years, not until after James had died.”
The three women did as they were told, Sally quickly picking the door lock and only Anthea risking a step inside the room.
Sherlock was shocked when he finally identified the noise. Couldn’t understand why he hadn’t always known. It was a voice, a man’s voice and it was talking to him, a voice saying it needed him. Its ok, Sherlock thought, I’m coming, just hold on, wait for me.
John and Greg laughed and sauntered over to join them. John kissed Sherlock and wondered how quickly he could get him out of that suit.
Sherrinford snorted, “He’s good at that.” Sherlock stared at him for a moment, unsure, before matching his brother’s grin.
They lay in each other’s arms, recovering their breath when the first whimper came from the bedroom, followed quickly by a shriller cry of hunger.
Sherlock had been inspecting the fireplace and the wall opposite, looking for a projector or false wall. Doctor Strange held out his right hand to Sherlock and held out the left straight in front of him. The vortex of sparkling golden light reappeared and Strange began to lead Sherlock towards it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at John over Lestrade’s head. He obviously rated this as a four or maybe even just a three. John was optimistic he would be back home and in the kitchen within an hour.
“Where is it? What have you done with his phone?” Sherlock demanded of Anderson and the uniformed officers preparing to remove the body for autopsy.
Finishing the last crumbs of Mrs. Hudson’s divine wedding cake, John sat back in his chair, replete. To his left Harry was deep in conversation with Molly and on his right was Sherlock’s vacated chair, his husband now sat opposite him, flicking at his phone and reading something to Lestrade. John hoped this wasn’t a sign of something to disrupt their impending ‘sex holiday’ as Sherlock so charmingly put it.
Sherlock let out a long sigh. He was running his hands up and down John’s back and reached behind John, filling his palm with shower gel and began to soap up his husband’s broad shoulders, back and solid biceps. One of the countless ways being married to John had changed him, despite his own best efforts, was that he was getting better at understanding, naming and talking about his emotions. He had spent the night working through his anger before realising it was based in disappointment and then, finally, hurt:
” John grinned naughtily but then wiped his hand over his tired face. There was silence for a moment. Of course Sherlock could deduce him, even under such circumstances. He did it automatically, every sense filling his mind with facts. John sighed, you’d think he’d be used to by now.
Three hours later, Sherlock emerged to find 2 cold cups of tea on the coffee table next to him and a plate of Jaffa cakes. He was a little concerned. He was clearly being very non-industrious in his two year marriage and if he was to save them from impending doom, he need to put a plan into action immediately. He considered setting out a colour-coded spreadsheet but decided that, in this instance, time was of the essence, so he made do with a checklist in his Evernote app on his phone to work through by the end of the week.
Sherlock circled the man, trying to find the tricks hidden to create such an apparition. This was an illusion, obviously, although Sherlock was still at a loss to know how it was done. “You’re American?”
“You bastard, you know what I’m trying to say.” But John meets his eyes, laughs and it all becomes a lot easier.
“That is not the point” spat John through gritted teeth “the point is, it was their news to tell, when and how they liked. Not. Yours” he stabbed a finger into Sherlock’s face “You have spoiled it for them and God knows, they have been through enough to get to this point. Don’t they deserve a bit of happiness?” He placed his two hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and with each word, pushed him forcefully towards the sitting room wall.
“Tha’s easy! Sh’lock Holmes has the biggest, most beautiful dick I have ever seen. Isss not long and thin like the rest of him,” John shook his head vehemently, very serious. “No, isss long a’right but its also ver, ver thick, s’wide, do you see?”
John felt faintly ridiculous drinking champagne on a flight that would last less than a hour, but it was the first time ever he had flown first class and he was determined to make the most of the experience. At some point, the airline had found out that they are on their honeymoon and offered them a free upgrade; Sherlock surprised John with his enthusiastic acceptance. Dinner was served as soon as they took off and now is being cleared. Sherlock even ate a little, although he passed on the wine.
John stroked Sherlock through his pyjamas, watching the other man’s face closely. When he clearly wasn’t going to be told to stop, he began nuzzling behind Sherlock’s ear and slowly eased his way down the lean body, kissing, licking and stroking.
The noise frightened Sherlock. It was the first noise he had heard in a while and although it only lasted a moment, it made him jump. He spent ages trying to work out what had made it. It seemed very familiar and he narrowed it down to being either a frog, a bell or a bird chirping. He flexed his fingers and wriggled his toes. It felt good so he decided to do it again. Breathing in deeply he also decided to see if he could wrinkle up his nose. He could! It was so exciting he did it again. Exhausted then, he went back to floating.
Jumping to his feet again, Sherlock and his faithful crew wandered into the orchard once more. At the very bottom ran the hedge that separated the garden from the road. Behind it, Sherlock heard peculiar grunting and panting noises.
The sudden movement caused the subject of Sherlock’s aggravated attention to look up from his journal.
They walked to the bottom of the garden as a new shape shifted and clicked into place in Sherlock’s mind. The bucket emptied and rosemary picked, they wordlessly headed back to the house. On the back step, Sherlock leaves his hand on his mother’s arm and leans down to kiss her cheek and understands that as he and Mycroft launch into their dangerous plan, he has a new secret weapon.
John gazes down at the supplicated Sherlock beneath him. Sometimes he wants this man so badly it shocks him. The powerful need to claim him, mark him and have him for his own is so strong it can overwhelm him. John has never felt this way before and struggles with it, afraid that someday it might take him over and he will lose control. He squeezes the lube into his palm, slicks up his cock and pushes Sherlock’s legs even further apart
Lestrade exchanged looks with John and Sherlock and in a silent blur of gestures, indicated they would all go in and he would rush Evan while they others went to the aid of Eloise. On the count of three they burst through the French doors, Lestrade yelling “Police! Put that down” as he ran at Evan.
“Is that, um, for me? I mean, is that your way of trying to tell me you don’t think it’s too tight?” John gave a small smile.
A pale light shone on John’s face and he began to grasp for it, pushing up through the fog in his mind. Part of him was afraid to open his eyes but in the end he decided he had nothing to lose; if he was dead he needed to know that too. He only opened them for a fraction of a second, the light burning, and all he took in was grey and stone. Next, he became aware of the burning agony in his damaged shoulder and it was when he tried to stretch he realised he was unable to move, mostly because both wrists were handcuffed, although not together.
On the cab ride to meet Lestrade, all Sherlock could think about was John, the things he had said and not said and the way he had left. It was only as they were pulling into the leafy street where Eloise Armitage lived that he realised he had not given the case a single thought. This, he told himself, is why you cannot have a relationship, it ruins your ability to work. No, he was decided. As much as he would like to explore and give himself over to John, it was a disaster waiting to happen. It would ruin their friendship and that would destroy him and his work would suffer. He would have to suppress these feelings again and John would get over it in time, he wasn’t the first person to have a crush on Sherlock. After all, Molly had managed it. And Lestrade.
Professor Fitzgerald makes a brief phone call to request tea and invites his guests to sit in the battered leather chairs on either side of the unlit fireplace, it’s mantlepiece overladen with glass and pottery objects, papers stuffed behind them, before pulling over his own desk chair. Sherlock briefly examines the eclectic contents of the cabinet; a sixteenth century clay pipe, a fifteenth century pewter beer mug, shards of human bones, a selection of coins and, in the centre of the display, a bronze torc.
Sherlock too had changed. He had spent twenty two years unsuccessfully trying to forget this man, accepting his mistake and learning to live with his decisions. This was his last chance and he knew it.
It was as they sat back again that Greg spotted the first red balloon. It floated past first one of the windows and then appeared at the second. Astonishingly, this window opened and the balloon floated into the room and fell slowly, coming to a gentle rest at Mycroft’s feet. It was rapidly followed by three more.
“I am sorry for the pain it caused you, none of it was done intentionally to hurt you, but I am not sorry for Mary, or for marrying her.”
“Indeed; a castle tower, bubble pods and a yurt. Intriguing.” Sherlock pauses, weighing up his deductions and wondering if he should say something. John has surprised him but he knows there’s more. “Granted, neither of us would have enjoyed lying on a beach, but why did you choose Ireland?”
“John, why are you looking at me like that?” began Sherlock, watching the changing expressions flit across John’s face. Unexpectedly, he crossed the kitchen in two long strides and wrapped his arms around John
Eoin takes a slurp of his tea, clearly enjoying his story telling.  “By then, times had changed. Ireland was a republic and there was a resurgence in finding and protecting our treasures. In 1969, James’ eldest son, James Jnr,  brought the hoard to a local historian who cleaned it, photographed, dated and identified the items as a torc, two gold cups, a large ceremonial cloak pin and a bronze serving platter. There were one hundred and sixteen hammered coins, all silver. Each item was estimated to be at least nine hundred years old and were most likely the treasured belongings of a regional clan chieftain. It was one of the single greatest archeological finds and virtually priceless. They were returned to James Murphy Jnr, who had agreed to donate them to the National Museum and arrangements were made for their collection the following day. However, James Murphy Jnr has always maintained that his home was burgled that night and the entire hoard was stolen. They have never been seen since.”
“Oh, do calm down, John. I shall be home later and shall treat you to a late supper if it bothers you that much – Oh, yes Molly, I’m coming. Do stop waving them at me, I’m trying to talk to my husband!”
John inwardly rolled his eyes. Of course Sherlock was trying to overhaul his entire image. Maybe he should have a little fun at Sherlock’s expense. “Did he now. We’ll see. Maybe we should just start with the suit and see how we get on.”
John squeezed in behind Sherlock. The shed was crammed with junk; an old lawn mower, rakes, spades, water cans hanging from hooks on the ceiling, old hockey sticks and balls, odds and ends of wood, boxes of nails, slug pellets and weed killer. Sherlock scanned what he could see.
For a start was the simple fact that Sherlock was a bloke. There was no doubting the fact that John fancied the pants off him, but he was unsure of the dynamics, the protocols and the rules. He laughed at himself then. If there were rules to a gay relationship, Sherlock would undoubtedly be breaking them anyway so what did it matter if John knew them. Oh well, they would just have to muddle through and find out what suited them. Will Sherlock be into public displays of affection, he wondered. John had always been very fond of holding hands.
“I do believe it is my turn” smiled Sherlock, gently pushing his husband off him and standing. John remained sprawled on the sofa and Sherlock covered his naked arse with the closest thing to hand, a spare pink baby blanket, wiped his belly and hands with a baby wipe and went to collect their daughter.
A note left on John’s pillow, following a heated discussion on John’s decision to ‘try something new’ with his har.
He pocketed the phone just as Lestrade bought theri fourth pint. Things were getting a bit raucous in the pub and the arrival of a hen party only lightened the mood and noise levels further. None of the men had seen each other socially in a while and had some catching up to do. Mike filled them in on his adventures in new parenthood, the joys of new teeth and the effect they had on nappies. Greg detailed the further destruction of his marriage, having been to court and the divorce now finalised. He lamented his single status and bought another round.
With that, Sherlock came all over his clothes and John lost all control at the sight, pumping hard and erratically until, with a shout, he came hard.
Clearly dismissed, John rooted around for his phone and sat down with the notebook. Each man spent a happy hour in companionable silence, Sherlock burning leather and causing small chemical reactions that made the flat stink and John picking vegetarian Indian recipes from Jamie Oliver’s website.
Sherlock whimpered and his knees began to go. John suddenly stood and half lifted, half pushed Sherlock onto the bad, pressing him flat and resuming the sucking and licking he had begun.
“Our jobs are not so different. It’s just that the dead bodies I examine tend to be a lot older and there is a lot less of them. Mostly, its just bones and teeth. I am
At times he used his clothes as an armour, deliberately cultivating an image of wealth and class; it put others at a disadvantage and they were often more revealing to him when they were trying to impress him. He also enjoyed creating an effective disguise.
Anything else Lestrade was going to advise was interrupted by the phone on the wall ringing. Lestrade answered it, grinning at John after a moment.
Later that evening, John had cleaned out a cupboard and labelled all the new containers and the food processor with Emilia’s name. He was now the only one in their little family not to have their own special cupboard. He considered putting a label on the tea bags just so as not to feel left out.
“Our Unit has been remiss in its duties and we need to remedy that situation quickly by locating and retrieving our principals. Preliminary data indicates that each principal responded separately to a text message they believed to have been sent by Mycroft Holmes asking them to meet him at the Diogenes Club. This message was actually from an external source, routed through Mr. Holmes’ phone number. He himself left my care at ten hundred hours yesterday morning on route to Downing Street for a routine briefing. On that journey he was in the close protection of Captain Mark Dunne, later found dead in a nearby alley off Gainsford Street, just south of the Thames. He had been shot. The car has not been located”.
“I told him everything Dad. Things have changed now, he deserved to know. Deserved to know you spent my entire childhood telling me bedtime stories about him. That I grew up with his photograph on the mantelpiece. That, as I become older, how you explained why you had never remarried, never even been on a date”.
“Ah, there’s my beau’ful boy! S’Sh’lock!” John was delighted. Sherlock, on the other hand, turned on his heel and left.
He was certainly not aware of Mycroft having been in a relationship with anyone, male or female and was sure Sherlock would have told him. In the end, he decided Mycroft must be entering into some politically expedient marriage, maybe to the youngest daughter of a Russian oligarch. He would run this idea by Sherlock once he surfaced.
"Come on, it's ok. I won't hurt you," he crooned at the desk, "Just come here, I don't mind the puddle."
Emelia glanced at her Papa as he recovered in the doorway. If it was her, she’d want to go straight to her room, surround herself with her stuff. She wondered would Papa head for the chair or the sofa. She attempted a few surreptitious deductions and predicted the chair, knowing her father’s determination and stubbornness. She was right and two minutes later she handed him a cup of tea there.
In my plan, this had a very different ending. Sherlock was humiliated and upset by John's outburst and they had a huge row. Obviously, John and Sherlock disagreed with my assessment of their reactions and decided to have a laugh instead.
"They warned us this would take time. You saw how they were treated. It's bad enough he's so young, but he's also alone for the first time, in addition to all the trauma." John swallowed hard, trying not to think about the case and the sights they had seen. It had taken Sherlock a week to uncover the full extent of the puppy farm ring, the selling of puppies way before they were ready to be separated from their mothers. The horrendous conditions of the dogs and their location would take him a long time to forget.
John is very much taken by surprise when having reached the stairwell, Sherlock captures his hand and pushes him up against the wall, devouring John’s mouth in a hard and needy kiss. When they both recover themselves and need to come up for air, Sherlock’s eyes are dark grey and glittering. He leans into John’s neck, sucking and nipping before breathing into his ear.
“Sherlock, at the age of four you knew the names of over two hundred different plants, both Latin and common. You could list off their uses both medicinal and lethal, their methods of reproduction and even the chemical compounds that could be derived from the plants and their uses. Who taught you all that?”
John had been leaning over him as he regained consciousness and was gently touching the bleeding spot on Sherlock's head:
It didn’t last, of course, this refuge, it never did these days. A hearty slap on the back, a handshake, a fresh drink and John was back to his well-practised performance. Gratitude mixed with modesty, self-deprecation with warmth. It came so easily to him, even he was nearly convinced by its genuineness. Skating a glance over the broad shoulders in front of him, he almost smiled at the idea that at least tonight he wasn’t the only person in the room who would know it was all faked.
Would he? There was a time, not so very long ago, that the notion was as far fetched as him becoming an astronaut. However, the universe has shifted and rearranged around him and now nappies, babygros and pink plastic things are part of his everyday life. Would a small version of himself be a good thing? Does this world need more of the Holmes’ genes? He remembers the first time he saw Rosie; tiny, utterly dependent and beautiful. He had loved her instantly. Would it not be a good thing to multiply and spread such love?
“Well you can bloody well pay for a new pair. Now, what was I saying? Oh yeah. Fruit bowl. Maybe on the coffee table then. What fruit do you like?”
John was confused, He had been hoping for some tea, maybe a sandwich and a sit down. Accident and Emergency had been like a war zone and he would still be there had he not been spotted by a nurse he used to work with who got him some preferential treatment.
“Yeah, I do, but it’s not like you ever had a choice, is it? It’s not like you planned to have a child? You want me - you get a package deal.” John is also now watching as Rosie slyly drags the bucket a few inches towards her, ignoring the objections of its owner.
John’s train of thought was derailed by Michael reaching in to measure his inside leg. He shifted his stance, came to attention and tried really hard not to think too much about Sherlock. He needed to clarify things a bit, though.
Flipping John over onto his back, Sherlock made a slow growl in the back of his throat as he kissed, then licked and finally bit John’s neck. The gasp this produced from John encouraged him and Sherlock decided to conduct an experiment to find out how else he could make John produce that glorious gasp.
In the past, John would have bowed his head at the painful memory. That awful, terrible day when John had shot his treacherous, lying assassin wife as she pointed a gun at Sherlock, come to finish the job she had started now the baby was born. Afterwards, John had gone to Sherlock, begged to come home, him and his infant daughter. Sherlock had turned them away, said he was moving to France and that Mycroft was already on his way to help John start his new life. Now he looked Sherlock straight in the eye.
Face firmly planted into the pillow, Sherlock gently floated back into consciousness, stretching muscles stiff from being pushed to their limits the day before. Easing over onto his back, he checked the time only to be astounded to see 8.47 on his bedside clock. It had been, he calculated, 4 years and 7 months since he had slept so late after such an early night. Light was streaming in the window and it was so bright he had to close his eyes again to let them adjust. It was then that the
John had kissed him and his mind had begun to quiet, just a little. It would be an experiment. He would time how long it would take before John was repulsed enough, angry enough, to pull away and that would be that. Sherlock started his internal stopwatch and distracted himself by watching the second hand tick past. Ten, twenty, thirty.
It had been sixteen days since Moriarty had filled the nation’s screens, crooned “Did you miss me?” and the plane had turned around.
Molly was perched on the bed when they arrived, holding Greg’s hand and giving him a rather graphic description of her latest autopsy. Apparently, she suspected foul play and was running some ideas past her new boyfriend. John found it rather comforting that his was not the only relationship that centred around murder, dismembering and criminal acts.
“Because for the last 6 months, I have been living in a near constant state of arousal because of that fuckwit of a flatmate of mine, who doesn’t have any interest in that kind of thing and when I closed my eyes I could pretend it was him”.
Sherlock nodded and watched in wonder as John disappeared into the bedroom, reappearing with their softest fleecy blanket and Sherlock’s old grey T shirt. John pulled off his cardigan and checked shirt, unbuttoned Sherlock’s pale blue shirt and handed him the T shirt.
John had spent his childhood in hand-me-downs and cheap jeans from C&A or Top Man. He had spent his entire twenties alternating from scrubs to army uniform and the only set of decent clothes he had ever taken pride in had been his dress uniform. He felt like he was shedding the drab, grey skin of his former existence and that this new suit was the tangible proof of how much his life has changed since meeting Sherlock.
, bedroom. He pulled out the strong box from underneath John’s side of the bed and discovered it was unlocked and John’s pistol was gone.
Sherlock awakes in a strange bed with light pouring in through an uncurtained window on his right and for a second is disconcerted not to know where he is. Then the realisation washes over him that he is downstairs in 221a. He shifts to his back in the narrow guest bed and listens to Martha in the kitchen, the radio playing and her off-key falsetto joining in on the chorus; “All you need is love, ta da da da, all you need is love, love. Love is all you need.”
With the ‘blues and twos’ in full force, and back-up on its way, Lestrade drove through the streets of leafy, suburban London to South Harrow with the expertise of a graduate of the Met’s best high-speed training. John careened around in the back seat despite his seat belt as they went the wrong way around traffic calming systems, mini roundabouts and hit speed reduction bumps at high speed, jarring every bone in their bodies.
“I’m sorry, my darling, for what I had to do today. Daddy didn’t want to leave you. I won’t do it again. I had to keep you safe, though and I’m afraid, your mother was a serious danger to you. She’s gone now but don’t you worry, we will be more than enough to make up for that, me and your..” he looked up and smiled at Sherlock who was standing in the doorway watching them.
He breakfasted in his room on tea and toast. He ate the toast because he knew John would want him to, not because he was hungry. Sherlock headed out of the hotel into the early morning October drizzle, a pre-ordered cab waiting for him in the car park. He missed the elegance of London’s black cabs, their grandeur compared to the ubiquitous sedan cars in every other city. Maybe John was sitting in one now on his way somewhere. Where would John be going, he wondered?
Sherlock glances around at the other families enjoying the park. Rosie’s shrieked protest has drawn a few concerned glances. He returns her to the grass and plops down next to her, long legs crossed. He awaits her next foray in this battle; experience has taught him she is a formidable foe.
“No. Don’t do that John, don’t deflect. Tell me what you thought being a Dad would be like? Just for the record, I think you would have been a wonderful father, given the chance.”
Pushing the tip of his tongue into the beloved pucker. Building a slow rhythm, he pushed as deep as he could into the other man, eliciting sighs and grunts of pleasure.
Sherlock hurt everywhere. He could hear voices but what they were saying made no sense to him and he wondered what language was being spoken. He tried to sit up a bit but the pain under his ribs and in his back almost made him wretch. He would just stay where he was and try to work out who had kidnapped him this time. He drifted off again, back into the grey haze.
Finally home, John took a long shower, trying his best to wash the smell of Sherlock off his skin. Drying off, he took up his new pants. Two packs were carefully tucked away in the back of his bottom drawer in preparation for his new suit. He opened the third pack and tried on a pair. They were certainly snug and John turned to look at his reflection in the long mirror on the back of his bedroom door. A single droplet of water fell from his hair and ran down his neck, then his collarbone. The underwear certainly highlighted his genitals, all tidily tucked up and away. He did an experimental bounce and watched carefully as nothing moved. Turning sideways, he was thrilled by his profile. He slid a hand down and carefully lifted his balls and cock, giving them an affectionate squeeze. The memory of the revelations from Michael about Sherlock mingled with those of the warmth and scent of his skin from earlier. Pressed tightly together, John had tried in vain not to press into his back and now, as he recalled the feel of Sherlock’s firm buttocks pushing back into his belly, he grew hard in his hand.
Sherlock’s pain came from his lower back, the result of an untreated cracked vertebrae sustained from his beating in Serbia and aggravated by John’s punch on his return. He did everything he could to hide the discomfort it caused and, as a result, only John knew of its existence.
As John leaned over to give Sherlock a good night kiss, his last of the day, a thought occurred to John:
Now here he was standing beside his desk, with John at his side looking at him expectantly. John had been cleaning and insisted they clear out all the old papers, abandoned chargers and mouldy half-eaten scones from underneath the sofa. Grumbling, Sherlock had reached in his hand and felt something rectangular that made the back of his brain itch. Pulling it out, he stared at the matchbox. He shook his head at himself as he stood up. This is silly, he thought, it’s only a matchbox. To prove it to himself he opened it.
John collapsed onto the bed next to Sherlock, half laughing. Sherlock was quivering slightly from his orgasm and the physical effort involved. John gathered him into his arms,
Atlin Merrick has launched a 31 Day Porn Challenge for May 2017 and I am rising to that challenge. I shall be using the daily prompts to write Sherlock and John exploring this new relationship. Each story will be a stand alone work that forms part of this Series, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so please subscribe to the series, or me, if you want to find out how things develop. The works will be short to be able to keep up with the Challenge (although I am not promising to post every single day!)
John growled, low and pained. He hurled himself at Sherlock, pushing him hard up against the bathroom door leading into Sherlock’s bedroom. His kiss this time was fierce, demanding and he brought both hands up to cup Sherlock’s face, pull him as close as he could. Sherlock’s hands roamed John’s back, gripping his arse and pulling him closer.
“Only to return items we each had at the other’s home, gifts, that kind of thing. The usual” She sighed. “I cannot understand how this has happened to him. He was always so popular, it’s so sad” She looked away, a tear falling down each cheek.
