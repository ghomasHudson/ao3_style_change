There’s a crash from the other side of the door, inarticulate yelling and curses as Dean rages in the next room. Castiel falls down to the floor, nearly crying. God—in anger, in fear, in frustration—he doesn’t fucking know anymore.
He presses a forearm to the wall, letting the water beat down around his head, blocking out the world.
Max and Alicia follow him, the pleasant jumble of their voices carrying faintly as Cas goes searching for a beer. Even from the kitchen, the view is spectacular, the sight of Las Vegas spread out below them. The sun is just setting as the night lights of the city are slowly winking on, a dizzy kaleidoscope of rushing color.
Castiel hands the menus to their waitress and slumps back in his seat. He just wants his fucking coffee.
Castiel tightens his jaw, debating silently with himself. After a brief hesitation, he tucks his gun back in his pocket.
At any other time, Dean would roll his eyes at Cas’s complete lack of sugarcoating, but he’s focusing all his energy on not bolting out of this bar, away from Cas and this friggin’ conversation.
Even though he seemed reluctant, knowing full well he's risking Anna’s wrath, Gabriel quickly found the proper ritual, if only because he wanted to prove he could. Castiel had counted on that. Gabriel could never resist a challenge.
“Mm-hmm,” Becky says absently, doodling in her notebook, as if that weren’t already her job description.
By the time the sun sets, Dean has managed to wrangle Castiel’s forest into something more closely resembling a garden. The dead plants are gone, the weeds removed, and some of the less-fortunate plants look fresher, brightened simply through care and attention. The hydrangeas are already improved, growing pinker and plumper by the minute.
A vampire had nearly ripped Anna’s throat out—it had her pinned, and Castiel was too far away—but then Dean had blazed in, fury in his eyes and his fist glowing white. He smote the one of top of Anna, throwing its smoking body aside—then got righteously pissed and took out the entire nest. Castiel thinks he saw stars for at least thirty minutes afterwards.
There’s a squeal of tires as Castiel sharply pulls the car over to the side of the highway, nearly throwing them both. He’s out the door in a heartbeat, yanking his knife from his belt.
Dean is fumbling, hands scraping for his bow, lit up by flashes of lightning—Castiel is sprinting towards him, screaming his name.
“The only thing I could do was follow you,” he mutters. “And it was hell, Dean, I can't lie to you—the things I saw, the things I did…”
“Still got that mouth, I see,” he says. But he’s smiling, his joy at seeing Sam again spilling into every action. Sam reflects Bobby's smile, beaming. But when the thought of Dean returns, his mood sours.
Dean doesn’t seem like he’s doing too well with the self-control either, because he presses Castiel back into the seat, almost in his lap as his hands slide up under Castiel's shirt, stealing hungry kisses. Castiel lets him, fingers tracing up, finding his sensitive sides, his chest—
His heart twitches as the blood spatters across his cheek, his lungs leap and his throat burns. He’s
Gabriel plops the bag down on their car, looking pissed. Castiel notices thankfully he's changed his clothes.
Emmanuel looks up, his eyes narrowed. He darts a glance over at Gabriel, who just shrugs. Emmanuel rolls his eyes and stands,  taking his binoculars from his pocket.
The bells toll out over the yard, the warning for the beginning of the feast. Sam looks up, and sighs.
Dean freezes. He fights against the flare of pain that had seared through him at the sound of his name, instead focusing on his anger. He hardens.
Anna’s voice snaps him out of it, and Castiel sets his jaw, grabbing the leather jacket and slamming the door on the trenchcoat. Because, really.
“Ain't gonna argue with you on that,” Dean says, chuckling a little. But it's unconvincing, and he doubts Emmanuel is fooled. He always infuriatingly seems to be able to read Dean that way.
“Whoa, really don’t think that’s a good idea right now.” She takes a breath. “I mean, not to say that that drama definitely sobered me right up—but we’ve all been drinking, and she’s not going to be receptive right now. It’ll just lead to another fight.”
“I was looking for you,” Sam says. “The entire time. And when you didn't show with Butler, back in Creede…”
You're always welcome to hit me up on tumblr, and please go visit feredir and give some love for the amazing art!
“Why?” Dean shrugs. “Half the fun is seeing his face turn red. And that smitey squinty look he gets—”
There’s the sound of wings behind him and Castiel whips his head around, gaping at the new figure next to Dean. His eyes harden once he takes in the scene in front of him.
was an outlaw hideout in southeastern Utah used mostly by Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch gang in the closing years of the Old West.
But slowly, the first fierce kiss fades out into something more tender, and as it ends, Emmanuel pulls back, yet still completely in Dean’s space, his eyes opening. Those eyes are so close to Dean's own, eyelashes fluttering, the hot heavy sound of their breath in between them, lips begging to meet again.
“Must be the life, huh?” Dean folds his hands, leaning his elbows on the table. “Running around town being the mysterious familiar.”
“And I have you to thank for that,” Bela says sharply. “None of this was supposed to happen. You’re the ones who derailed our guaranteed victory in this fight.”
She has not failed to notice her son’s eagerness—she would have been blind to not to notice the change in Dean tonight—but now, the prince is silent and taciturn, his mood darkening, black as the night outside.
“You make a move on him, and you’ll be dead before you hit the ground, you understand me?” Dean yells. “Back. Off.”
He’d headed off as soon as Ruby had gone, double and triple checking to make sure he wasn't being followed. Sam's fairly certain he made it out of town without being seen, and had started up the path that Eileen had described with eager anticipation—but now he's utterly lost. The trail through the rock is like a maze, full of false turns and identical paths. Sam has lost count of the times he'd guessed at a turn and wound up at a dead end. He's not one to panic easily, but he's starting to get a sinking feeling in his stomach—one of hopeless realization. He might never find his way.
And sometimes, sometimes, he would talk about Castiel’s mother. How he never failed to stop and bring her a flower from the garden. How beautiful her smile was.
He opens up the door to Charlie’s shop, the noise of the town square disappearing into calm quiet, the air rich with the scent of freshly-baked bread. He drops into a seat at the counter, helping himself to the coffee sitting on the burner.
With every word, there’s more chance he’ll be found out, but inside, he’s burning with curiosity. Why
Alastair shrieks in pain, falling back. Castiel cries out too, dropping to his knees, releasing the blade. The attack had sent a throbbing pain shooting up his arm, and he cradles it to his chest, unable to breathe.
“But if we lose the trail, that’s on you. And maybe I’ll decide working on my own was a better idea.”
Dean stops, running a hand through his sandy hair. Castiel watches as his fingers stray through the delicate strands, but instead of smoothing them, it only creates a more rumpled mess. Castiel aches.
That’s all the permission Dean needs. He grabs Castiel’s face, kissing him fiercely as he climbs into his lap, grinding down against him.
Cas is growing hard too, Dean can feel him pressing insistently against the curve of his hip, but he’s making no moves besides kissing him thoroughly, narrowing the world down to the point shared between their lips.
He goes left, looking around desperately—but there’s only fire, hot and blazing—enveloping half of the room, and quickly spreading. Glass and iron scatter the floor, the walls nearly collapsing, shaking as Castiel darts forward. He turns the corner and sees the sigils on the wall, drawn in blood, and his heart stops.
Castiel gives him a look, sloughing his pack off his shoulder and tossing it in the trunk. He won’t admit it out loud, but he likes the new space in the Impala. Definitely less conspicuous than a shady tarp in the back of his pickup. And it was Sam’s idea to draw a devil’s trap on the inside.
Dean creeps closer, staying low and out of sight. He’s not sure why he’s being so careful—after all, he’s a free man now. But old habits die hard, and Dean suspects Meg’s inn attracts all sorts.
He’s still sitting there when Anna finds him—sitting in the dark pews in front of the unused altar, his hands clasped and his head bowed.
Gabriel glowers, but goes to follow the direction. Dean comes back to Emmanuel’s side, forcing back the bile rising in his throat. Ellen removed Emmanuel’s coat, but his shirt is clinging wetly to his skin, soaked dark red. Dean sets about to removing it, fingers fumbling, quickly becoming slippery with blood. He feels useless, clumsy, unable to do anything.
Dean feels Cas shift his weight, knocking him slightly with his shoulder, and Dean can’t help a little grin. Yes, okay, Jody is a teacher—but she’s a friggin’ substitute—and her power over the two of them is basically next to nothing. They’ll get a slap on the wrist, a scolding probably, a warning not to do it again; and then everything will go back to normal. And inevitably, next week Dean and Cas will be in the janitor’s closet again, yanking at each other’s clothes and trying to shush any groan that gets too loud.
Ruby places a hand on his wrist, and he resists the urge to throw her off. There is something in her eyes, something genuine. Almost like pity. Almost like worry.
He curls his hand into a fist, his arm dropping to his side. His eyes roam over the rest of his body in the mirror, and he frowns. He twists experimentally, but he can’t see anything. He had amassed too many scars over the years—cuts, burns, the scrapes from various bites and blades—but they’re all gone.
But he can't shut his mind off. His thoughts are a storm, turning over Dean's words, shifting between anger and fear and complete confusion.
Sam stops dead, listening hard. He had made it very clear he was not to be disturbed, by anyone. Who—
Sam breathes hard, staring at Dean. He looks unhurt, but thoroughly shaken. Sam moves toward him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Then your father,” Abaddon continues, her voice hissing in his ears. “For leaving you, for forcing you into this life, for favoring Anna above
and his hands flash—the rest of their clothes gone, winked out existence or who the hell knows—but now there’s nothing separating them as Dean grabs Castiel's leg and hikes it up, pressing their hips flush. Castiel inhales sharply, throwing his head back.
The elusive specter of love. His parents had called it their friend for many years. He sees courtiers claim to be its slaves, poets writing sonnets in its name, but Dean isn’t sure that he himself will ever find it. Because, deep down, Dean still holds onto the childish belief that somewhere, his true love exists. But he’s not sure if they’ll ever meet.
He stops abruptly. Cas has vanished. In his place is a black cat, slowly curling up on the end of the bench they had been sitting on. The cat tucks his tail around him, looking at Dean smugly.
The new angel closes her eyes briefly, taking a deep calming breath. The lights are still sparking feebly, casting eerie shadows through the room.
She falls back against the pillow, covering her face with her hand. The other makes her way under her pillow, where it finds Raphael’s knife, and she curls her fingers around the hilt, clinging tight.
He sees another image, a vision…or was it just a dream?—Of hands patching up a dead man’s wounds, changing his blood-soaked clothes, then tenderly tucking the lighter into his pocket—maybe because it didn’t feel right to bury him without it, or maybe because they childishly wanted him to have some light in the darkness.
And Cas, the bastard—he full on smirks. Dean huffs, turning his back on the fallen angel, stomping up to the cash register. He drops the box none-too-gently on the counter, childishly hoping he breaks a couple.
Dean stares at her, hatred pulsing in his blood. She straightens slowly, a twisted smile spreading across her face.
“I gave you a chance,” he hisses. “I left you alone, I let you flourish in your freedom. And this is how you repay me.”
“That’ll be my brother,” he grumbles. “And he’ll have to say something about the state of my clothes, that’s for certain—“
“You, you―” Dean sucks in a breath, tilting his head back as Cas slips a hand into Dean’s boxers, grabbing at the flesh of his ass.
The demon grunts, falling to her hands beside Castiel. Her body fizzles and pops, orange sparks echoing around the wound.
Cas and Charlie actually end up arriving after them, Cas all disheveled and hair sticking up every which way―which tells Dean he also was wrestled into being there. Damn Charlie and her supernatural yoga arm strength.
Castiel presses against Dean again, one hand dropping to his waist, gripping gently at the flesh there.
Before, I had never seen any reason to challenge my orders. God was good, Heaven was good—the mission was good. But with the war—I finally, perhaps inevitably—started to doubt. According to my father, Sam was wrong. Abaddon was wrong. Heaven’s brightest jewel, now tarnished and thrown in the pit to rot. And what for? To remind us of obedience?
Castiel nods, teeth worrying his bottom lip. They’d wrapped up the werewolf case nicely, but Anna had been acting strange ever since, and Castiel had finally decided it wasn’t worth it to hold on to his doubts. He had really hoped it wouldn’t come to this—but the time for sitting around had long since passed. And if this plan works…
He turns his eyes back to the riders. In a moment of dread, Castiel thinks that perhaps they weren’t careful enough—and that Morgan had managed to follow them into the hills. Surely the Marshal’s men would never pull off an attack as sloppy as this—
Time phases out of his awareness. There's only Dean. Castiel clutches at his arms, his shoulders, his head—Dean’s soft hair beneath his hand, all twisted up in his fingers. Castiel presses back against the bed beneath him, letting out a soft sound every time Dean rocks his hips forward, lighting him up from the inside out, sending fire through his veins.
Fifty cents for the bath, an extra twenty for the soap and towel—but an hour later Sam’s on his way back to the inn, feeling better than he has in days—maybe weeks. The dirt and grime of hard riding everyday had been wearing on him, and while Sam has always made sure his hands were clean for his practice, he never was so picky about the rest of him. But the darkening bristles are gone from his face, shaved away, and he feels like himself again. Sam wonders how long it’ll last.
He’s so lost in his planning he doesn’t notice until they’re called to a halt. The three of them are getting off their horses, the short one digging around in one of the bags. Dean watches warily, but makes no attempt to move.
Emmanuel slides a hand around Dean’s back, pulling him closer, kissing the life out of him. It’s hard and it’s rough and is just on the painful side of pleasure, Emmanuel’s touch fast and greedy. They’ve been holding back for so long that now it’s their turn to take, and they can’t get enough.
He pulls back, smiling a dark mischievous smile. Dean’s breath is coming unsteadily, his heart going wild in his chest.
He covers his face with his hands, shaking his head. He’s no longer relaxed and warm against his side, he’s closed off—every nerve tight, his face pinched.
The silent gravestones greet him, and instantly, all the tension melts out of his shoulders, his sigh turning into a silver stream that drifts away into the dawn.
Dean shakes his head in wonder, scooping up the key, quickly unlocking his manacles. As soon as he’s back on his feet, Castiel tosses him his gun. Dean catches it, immediately shooting the man sneaking up over Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel whirls, grabbing onto the hangman’s rope, kicking a man in the chest before using the rope to swing over the side of the platform.
Castiel tries not to let a smug smile cross his face. He has the advantage now, with both blades in his hands.
Dean laughs, tipping back his head. He has never been so grateful for his friend's humor. It's making the strange differences in Daughton seem almost bearable.
“You explained it perfectly that night,” he breathes. “You’ll always choose your precious angels over us—no wonder you wanted to keep me away from them, you fucking selfish piece of shit—“
But there was something special about the archangel Sariel. So honey-sweet, great lavender wings stretched over my head—and I knew, the moment her hands clasped around mine—that I would follow her to the ends of the earth.
“And yeah, I had some doubts,” Benny says honestly. “What if we got married and everything changed? But…it’s as easy as breathing, man. One day you’re not married, then you are. And when you have the right one, you know. And from what I’ve seen with you and Cas…”
“Why’re you here?” He asks, voice gruff, keeping his back to Dean. “Thought you’d be long gone by now.”
It’s good, but Castiel wants him back in his arms—and he pulls Dean up, kissing him deeply, thumbs stroking over his cheekbones. Dean hums and melts into him, and Castiel is suddenly filled with an overwhelming wave of
Sam looks at him for a long moment, stony-faced, not saying a word. Dean feels like he’s standing on the edge of a cliff, but also strangely calm, even though his heart is threatening to break through his chest. Emmanuel’s not going to die. He can’t die. Everyone says so. He can’t.
He looks around the dilapidated building, over scraps of wood and forgotten papers, finally settling on a wall of shattered concrete. He remembers with a jolt in his stomach.
They continue on, until they reach a meadow where the trees are less thick, and where the Daughton men say the game is the best.
“I still don’t understand why you invited him,” Dean interrupts. “He’s not really a part of the group. If I’m being honest.”
They disappear out of Sam’s line of sight. The first man lingers, slowly pacing up the hallway, stopping at every door. Only when he’s disappeared around the corner does Sam release his breath.
He falls back against the bed, screwing his eyes shut. He chokes on his breath, desperately trying to calm down.
Dean raises an eyebrow. Sam had shown nothing but hard indifference towards Castiel so far, or at the very least wary suspicion. Now it almost sounds like Sam cares whether Castiel lives or dies.
Castiel looks up, at the bare walls of the room around him. It feels so empty now. He drops his eyes, curling his hand around the rough strap of his bag. He slings it over his shoulder, and walks out without another glance back.
Castiel is still at his perch, waiting. Facing the road to the castle, back straight, his eyes unblinking.
Dean settles sloppily in the chair, and Castiel falls into the seat next to him. He shoves a hand through his hair, breathing hard. He tries to look at anything other than the angel to his left, because if he does, he doesn’t think he’d be able to keep himself from doing something stupid. Like monumentally, sacrilegiously, stupid.
“Put him back on the horse,” he says curtly. He slides his pistol back into its holster, and quickly climbs back onto his palomino, digging his heels into her sides. The horse whickers and starts trotting, back down the trail.
Charlie is beside him as Chief Engineering Officer. She cranes her neck above the crowd, looking at the small group that’s just disembarked from the transport ship.
Anna recoils, and Castiel yanks back his hand, hissing. He grips his wrist with his other hand, blood already starting to well up on his knuckles.
Dean realizes that this is the first time he’s really been allowed to hold Cat. But he isn’t squirming or trying to get free. He’s just watching Dean, waiting.
He quickly dips and throws a shoulder into him, crouching down low and bringing up the blade around Dean’s left side, hoping to surprise him—
Dean starts making some truly theatrical gagging sounds behind him, but Sam can’t bring himself to care. He’s elated, so happy he feels as if he’ll burst with it. For a moment he thought he’d really lost Eileen for good, and he knows he never wants to feel that way again.
He lashes out and snatches up her reins. Chevre whinnies, backing away, but the man pulls her forward, laughing hoarsely.
“Well, after the stunt you pulled, the hell I’m letting you go alone,” Anna says to Emmanuel. Gabriel looks between the two of them.
He finds the edge of Castiel's jaw with his lips, alternating kisses and words into the line of his skin.
“Well, I demand an updated timeline as soon as you know,” Charlie says, suddenly businesslike. She whips out her phone, tapping away. “Next month is a bust because of our expo, but I am preemptively blocking out all of these weeks for you―”
Cas orders for them, and comes back with Mocha Almond Fudge, which he always gets, literally every single time—and Dean takes a deep breath. Now or never.
Anna doesn’t have time to say anything before Gabriel is scrambling up and towards them, his face white.
They do, about an hour later. Benny and Desmond, dragging a still-unconscious Cesar between them. Anna and Max stand, moving towards them.
Some of the older spots are sinking into the soft ground, and Castiel had spent the entire morning digging to save the headstones, to preserve the memory of long-forgotten relatives. Half of their family is buried here, people they’d never met, and he feels like it’s his duty. Save at least this part of them.
“I found it on one of the back shelves," he says, smiling. "It has several wonderful stories, some I’ve never heard before—“
Max walks around the side of the island counter, and Cas almost has a heart attack. He leans his elbows on the counter and Cas can see Max’s shoes, not three feet from him.
Dean groans, throwing an arm over his face. Another night of inane conversation and false courtesies. He doesn’t know how long he can stand this.
He gets to their lair in no time at all, thankfully with no angel on his heels. He walks in, unafraid, Raphael’s knife in hand—and makes quick work of it. There’s three of them, but he dispatches the first two easily, trapping the last one.
Sam tenses, but instead, several large men push forward, and seize the other one—the drunkard. He tries to put up a fight, but they quickly drag him to the door and toss him out onto the street. Not long after, the music and the laughter starts again, the crowd quickly losing interest now that the fight is over. Meg curls one finger, beckoning Sam forward.
Dean heads back down the street, glancing up at the sky. Clear for now, but there's a hint of clouds in the air, and it smells like rain. Again.
of doing something so horrible. But Max isn’t looking convinced, and Dean particularly doesn’t like the look on Cas’s face.
Dean frowns, but then Castiel smiles at him prettily, up through his dark lashes, and Dean's doubts melt away, not noticing the violent glint in his eye.
“Don’t see how that’s my problem,” Sam says, standing as Uriel comes back, a basin of tepid water in his hands.
Sam turns, looking at her carefully. She’s beautiful, as always, hair gently falling around her shoulders, her wine-colored dress contrasting against her skin.
“Didn’t take me much longer to figure out the lawmen were just as bad as the outlaws in the stories. Worse in some respects. Using people who trusted them on account of the star on their lapel.”
"There have been omens, of course," Sam continues. "And that's why Heaven hasn't caught up to us yet. They've got their hands full, dealing with the fallout."
Gabriel stares at them for a long tense moment, then steps back to let Sam pass. Dean follows hot on his heels, into a room that’s mostly bare, except for a bed in the center of the room. Dean stops dead when he sees Emmanuel’s limp body, all the breath leaving his lungs.
“And in His name, we shall see him absolved of all crime,” the man in the priest’s robes says, finishing with a righteous flourish, before he turns and winks at Dean.
He urges them forward, and they walk quickly beside him, his face dappled by the dark shadows of the trees.
Sam gets one of the older saddlebags from the stable out back, packing it full, everything he might need for a few days on the trail. He even digs out an old tintype of Dean, one they got at the photograph rooms in Blackwater. His brother had dragged him down to Market Street, telling Sam all about how they were finished within five minutes. They’d been selling ‘em two for ten cents, and they’d gone home with a photograph each. Sam never thought they’d have any use for them.
But mercifully, he draws back, settling into the passenger seat, pulling out his phone. Dean begins the quick drive home, but finds he still can’t shake his nerves.
Dean doesn’t even lift his head. He knows it’s the jailer, standing there with that stupid look on his face, holding whatever plate of slop they’ve decided to feed him this morning.
“You spend your whole life, your whole existence…serving something you’ve never even seen,” he almost whispers, “because you thought it was good. It was right.”
Dean spins him like it's nothing, twisting Castiel’s arm and driving his own blade to press against his stomach.
A flicker of relief runs through Castiel's eyes. He leans in and Dean meets him, pressing their foreheads together.
and there’s no way he can scratch. It had hit him bad before—fresh out of Hell, nightmares every night, but it had faded into a dull ache when he was with his family, when Dean was by his side, caught up in the hunts and the busy life on the road. But lately, with the sitting and waiting around, the fear, the worry that any day an archangel would come bursting through their door—the anger had come back.
Castiel Novak, in the flesh. Hair a mess, still in that stupid coat, smiling and tanned and irritatingly cheerful. He laughs, nearly knocked backwards as a blur of red wraps him up in a hug. He greets the Banes and Sam warmly, who even goes to give him a hug, the traitor. He clearly hasn’t seen Dean yet, so he waits, watching as Castiel greets the others.
Lilith brings her blade up again, dragging it slowly down Anna’s cheek. Anna keeps her eyes locked on hers, refusing to blink.
“He begged towards the end. Prayed and screamed for me to stop.” She tilts her head, malevolent glee in her eyes as she watches Castiel’s face. “I was waiting to tell you,” she breathes. “Oh, I was waiting for the day.”
Castiel fumbles, hands finding Dean’s cheeks. He can’t, he can’t open his eyes, because if he does, if he does—he’s not sure he’s going to make it.
Beautiful reds and purples, flowers bursting from every corner, tall spiraling leaves arching up so high Castiel believes the ceiling must be enchanted. He smiles. Despite all Dean’s comments about not being successful, he’s built something truly beautiful here, and all on his own.
“And I’m sure you don’t want Emmanuel to hear about this,” Dean says lowly. “Hear he makes a pretty picture when he’s mad. Gets mighty righteous.”
“Sometimes your mind won’t let you sleep.” Those eyes find Dean’s again. “You’re a lawman. M'sure you’ve seen your fair share of things you didn’t want to.”
He doesn’t have any sense of time. He doesn’t know how long he’s been trapped here, starved for a touch, a hint, a voice, anything.
Emmanuel looks up, eyes immediately flicking to Dean. Dean clears his throat, forcing himself to hold eye contact.
Sam thinks for a minute, then slowly removes his suit jacket, loosening his tie. He smiles hesitantly.
“Cut us up pretty good. Me and Sam got separated.” He closes his eyes. “So they know he’s with me now.”
He shoves past him and grabs his bag, quickly throwing in supplies. Dean is silent and still behind him.
“You have a history, don’t you?” Castiel sneers, creeping forward. “I could summon him here right now.”
He kisses him, he kisses him because he can’t do anything else, and he thinks that Dean understands. He loosens beneath him, easing his tears away as he slips their mouths together, holding Castiel close.
“More about how they’re still lookin’, reward for capture...wait.” She narrows her eyes, pointing at bottom of the page. Castiel sets down his cup, looking at her.
She leads him back towards the reception hall, where Dean can still hear the music and the party going on. It all seems out of reach to him now.
Castiel stepped past Dean’s grandfather, lying sick in his bed. Castiel had never done it before, but he saw no reason why it wouldn’t be possible. He extended his arm and thought very hard.
Castiel looks around wildly for the blade, nearly tearing the library apart. He finally spies it, a glinting black thing, on the top shelf of the bookcase—Sam must have moved it there—
Dean’s breath washes over him, and Castiel flinches. There’s a strange buzzing underneath his skin, but it doesn’t feel like fear. He knows that this is a creature that could rip him apart, destroy him in a flash of light, but Castiel feels no fear. Only exhilaration.
He doesn’t realize Cas has let go of one of his hands until they’re back to gliding, both facing the dark world below, only the fragile connection of their fingers keeping him from falling.
Castiel really thought Anna would be relieved. But he's still learning her, her personality, her moods—they’ve really only been riding together a few short months. Hell—Raphael was part of the reason Anna joined up with them in the first place. Castiel sighs, dropping his head.
The wind howls, unearthly, like so many devils and demons. Rain slaps relentlessly down, turning the earth to mud, then muck.
Castiel drops his head forward slightly, sighing. He stretches out the knots in his neck, rolling his aching shoulders. It'd be nice to spend a night in a real bed—god knows it’s been a while. A few weeks, maybe. And now that they’re tugging along this sheriff, they'll need to get rid of him as fast as possible—no time to stop for luxuries.
Castiel doesn’t know how long they sit there, just holding each other, exchanging little touches, Dean’s arms around his neck, his lips on his, his warm,
Anna stares for a moment, then stands. She walks over slowly, reaching out a hand to touch the soft suppleness of it. She brushes gingerly over the leather, and she frowns, looking down.
He punches him, and it’s a good hit, but Dean is like a fucking concrete block and Castiel snatches his hand back, gasping.
He tips back the rest of his drink—third or fourth, he’s not entirely sure—and as he sets the glass down, he catches sight of a dark pair of eyes watching him.
The camera flashes and they all melt out of the forced poses, some chuckling, some scowling. It’ll probably be the only chance they’ll get to have all eight of them together again, and not a single one of them has a camera on them.
Eileen checks her phone for what seems like the thousandth time, when suddenly she feels someone behind her. She whips around, angry that someone was able to sneak up on her.
Next day, Dean bolts down his dinner and leaves at top speed, leaving a confused Charlie behind him. There's no harm in getting there early, Dean tells himself. He could practice earlier today. No big deal.
Castiel is lost. He feels loose and light, Dean trembling against him as he catches his breath, face tucked into his neck.
Castiel dips forward and captures his lips in his kiss, both hands coming to Dean’s face, pain and fear and frustration spilling out between them. Dean presses their foreheads together, breathing heavily.
“Mother,” he mumbles, but stays still as Mary starts to comb his hair back into place, fussing with his collar.
"So...how does the power actually work? The Enochian allows the protection to manifest itself, or..."
Another blinding flash of light sears through the room, and Castiel searches for the source, jerking back in shock. It’s Dean—Dean tall and standing again, his eyes a piercing white. Soft swirling lines sink through Dean’s skin, and the light burns brighter, hotter—until Castiel has to shield his eyes.
He starts towards Dean—but abruptly stops. He’s staring at something over Dean’s shoulder, his anger slowly turning to confusion. Dean tenses, waiting for it.
He conjures up a towel out of nowhere and tosses it to Castiel, who nods gratefully, starting to wipe his face. Dean pulls his shirt and then his shoes back on, humming to himself.
The golden-haired one, shorter, more wiry—Dean could beat him easy. He hasn’t shown any impressive feats of strength so far, and Dean is sure he could take him in a one-on-one fight.
His voice was hoarse, weakened through many nights of grief. Tragedy had once again come to their small community, and Castiel could feel Dean’s soul still aching from it.
Sam purses his lips. He’s liking his woman less and less. But the lure of her words—whether they’re lies or truth—has him staying in his seat. He can’t risk leaving now, not if she has a way to find Dean.
“Well, that’s not really the most import—um, I mean—the ritual will take place during the blood moon, and then after that—”
“Raphael...he wanted Anna in the pit,” he starts slowly, fingers twisting together. “She’d be trapped below, and you—you’d be at Abaddon’s mercy on earth.”
Charlie comes back and mercifully gives him a new cup of coffee, and they drink together, wonderful smells drifting from the kitchen.
The broken warehouse groans and hums around them, and Castiel shivers. The air seems to reverberate with a physical power, living and breathing, hushed and old. It’s almost as if the weakened walls remember the power that washed through them before, and they can sense its nearness, ready at any moment to feel it again. Castiel feels like he might crack and shatter with the force of it.
There’s a knock on the door and Anna comes in, a towel in hand. She takes a seat on the toilet and hands him a razor, watching him. Castiel knows she’s been hiding them.
Dean grits his teeth, and nods grimly. Then he’s out and running down the back steps, leaping the last few feet and hitting the dirt running.
Dean stumbles through the doorway to their bedroom, Cas right behind him, already shucking his shirt.
“But we just left him there,” Emmanuel murmurs. It’s the first words he’s spoken since they left the town. “Left him with no help.”
Castiel digs his nails into his palm, his rage heightening, searing under his skin and scorching through his blood.
Charlie gives her name to the bouncer-looking guy standing in front of the hotel’s restaurant, and they’re immediately ushered towards a swanky back room, completely private. Max grins.
Castiel rolls his eyes and immediately regrets it. He kneads his temples, trying to massage some of the pain out.
Sam can feel his mother’s sadness, aching in every word. He glances at Jessica beside him, then takes a deep breath, turning to Mary.
Sam growls in defiance, even as blood steadily drips from his nose, spattering on the dirt below him.
She wipes the excess blood away from the leather, watching the brownish-red come away on the white, leaving it fresh and clear.
He leans back in, pressing his lips to Castiel’s own, hands coming up to frame his face. Cas responds with enthusiasm, and it soon turns heated, Castiel gripping at Dean’s hair like he can’t get enough, his other hand tangling in the back of his shirt.
“You’re not here to kill me,” she says, fixing him with that steely blue gaze. Castiel growls, low in his throat.
He looks down to where their hands are locked together and smiles, swiping his thumb back and forth over the skin of Dean’s hand.
Castiel instinctively reaches up, a short shock of pain jolting through him when Gordon’s blade cuts into his arm.
After a few minutes, they unfortunately reach the front of the line and have to scan their tickets, passing through the gate. Dean’s sweat glands have gone into overdrive, and he keeps wiping his palms on his jeans, shifting nervously. Cas, however, is cool as a fucking cucumber―smiling first at the flight attendant, then seemingly at every random person that passes by them after they settle into their seats.
“They can’t have gotten far,” he mutters. “Only three days, and with a prisoner, that’d slow ‘em down…” He draws a circle on the map, crushing the pen in his palm. “I’d put them as far as Corinth.”
Gabriel is a fleeting shadow—smiling at him through the occasional photo or phone call, off to yet another foreign country—but Anna never fails to come when her brother needs her, a solid comforting presence in his life.
Everything seems to be moving in slow motion. All sounds fade away, until there’s just Castiel, weakly pushing himself up onto his hands. Abaddon’s blade is lying on the ground, not two feet in front of him.
“I think that’s good as proof as any that our plan worked.” She lowers her voice conspiratorially. “He didn’t even bitch when we started on the party games.”
Of course. He should have seen this coming. Dean is having second thoughts, and rightly, wants to back out of this before making the commitment. Because it isn’t fair for Castiel to ask this of Dean if he’s not committed, even if Castiel is so sure—
The hand holding him abruptly disappears. He falls forward, barely managing to get his hands underneath him before he drops to the ground. The floor beneath him shimmers briefly, then is replaced with dirt.
He watches him for as long as he can, but it isn’t long until his eyes start to droop. He could just close his eyes for a minute…just for a second…
Castiel’s gonna die with a gun in his hands. He knows it, and he’s accepted it. He realized this one night when he was fifteen, when three of Dad’s friends got wiped out, all in a single week. Hunters don’t have much of a lifespan. You did the job for as long as you could, and tried to go out swinging.
A knock, and Emmanuel enters. He’s lost the hat and his traveling coat, stripped down to his undershirt and suspenders. He glances briefly at Dean, then at Gabriel.
“Nothin’," he says, setting the bottle down on the counter. "Just look like a prophet I used to know."
Alastair stalks forward, grabbing her collar. She snarls and twists, and they both have their blades at each other’s throats, one slice away from death. Alastair doesn’t seem to notice.
And a small part of him thinks he can always make his way back. If he really wanted to. Make his way to the Roost and find Emmanuel again.
They begin to move, soft and slow at first, Castiel’s breath hitching, cooling Dean’s feverish skin. He presses his lips to Dean's neck, a bitter bite of sorrow to the sweetness of his kisses—because they both know this could be the first, and the last time.
“You really think some heartfelt plea will stop me?” She hisses. “I have planned this for millennia.”
Lilith smiles slightly, before turning her back on Anna, walking back to the table, smartly ripping her blade from the wood. Anna shakes her head.
After a moment, she starts tugging at the sleeves of her coat, pulling it from her shoulders. She drapes it carelessly over the back of a chair, looking around.
Sam is turned and off down the lane before the man has a chance to finish his sentence. Elkins calls after him, but Sam ignores him. He swings back on his horse, snapping the reins. She responds immediately, cantering away from Elkins’ farm.
The man looks like he absolutely does mind, but leaves anyway, closing the door behind him with a sharp click. Ruby sighs.
He fights against it, and he manages to surface long enough, using his last breath, his last taste of the earth above him—
Dean forgets himself, yanking viciously at the laces. Sam glances over sharply, scowling at him. Dean stops, forcing himself to take a deep breath.
“We ain’t that close,” he mumbles. “As we used to be. Guess...guess something’s always been missing.”
There’s a strangled noise from the corner, and Naomi turns, eyes glinting. Anna is shaking, choking on her words.
His phone buzzes in his pocket, and he pulls it out, seeing a text from Ellen about appetizers for Saturday. He unlocks his phone to answer, completely missing the poignant look Jess gives Sam.
Emmanuel catches Dean staring, but he doesn’t look away. Instead he stares back, his eyes dark and hooded. Emmanuel takes a slow inhale from his cigarette, letting it dangle, smoke curling thick in the air. He fixes his eyes on Dean’s, tongue resting softly against his teeth.
group is all ready, we’re gonna head out,” Alicia says. She gives Charlie one last quick kiss. “Roll out!”
—Abaddon must’ve had him, trapped in that room, and Cas had shouted, yelled at him so Dean would leave, to save his life…
"The other angels. I may not be in the thick of things anymore, but I like keeping in the loop. They won't shut up about you," she says, pointing at Anna. "And they don't like you very much," she finishes, glancing at Castiel. "Sorry."
They trade promises into the late morning, until Anna pounds on the door, yelling that breakfast isn’t gonna eat itself.
The train rolls over another jolting bump in the tracks, making Dean clench his eyes shut, breathing deep.
Anna steps up, showing him her bandaged arm. Castiel touches the wrapping delicately, then looks up, the question in his eyes. Anna nods towards Dean.
“Cesar. Creaser,” Emmanuel says sharply. “But you know the plan was to lose anyone who might be after us, then meet back here. That must be where they are."
“Then we’ll shake him off. Just like last time,” Gabriel says, sweeping crumbs from the table to the floor. He misses the irritated look Meg shoots at him.
Mary lays her hand gently upon her son’s, saving him from seizing his own wine goblet and throwing its contents in Lady Bergen’s snide face.
Castiel is warm, still warm even after death, and Dean chokes back a cry. The first time—the first time he’s ever touched him, and only after his heart had stopped beating.
“Ugh—you’re all wet,” Alicia whines, shoving at Charlie. Charlie laughs, but sits off on the chair next to her, planting a kiss on her cheek. Max smirks.
Gabriel pushes a couple of sausages around on the pan, whistling. He glances over his shoulder, cracking a grin when he sees Castiel.
With a groan, Dean unfurls himself from the cot, swinging his legs over the side. The jailer leers at him. Several of his teeth are missing.
“None of this ever would have happened if I had let your father take you away,” she snarls. “So he had to die.”
Once Anna and Castiel are settled, Sam starts to bring them up to speed, explaining all that had happened in the past couple of days. It had been almost a week since…everything happened.
He knows he should stop, because it’s all coming up—a violent storm of hate and betrayal—spewing like bile from his throat.
Dean chews his lip. He'd been unsure of what to think of the outlaw since last night. He hadn't meant to eavesdrop, really—but there was only so much of Gabriel's snoring he could tolerate. And then he heard Emmanuel and Tasha talking.
He sinks into the white light around him, swallowing and dragging him under, down into the pit, to smoke, to fire.
He doesn’t know this country too well, and he ain’t too happy about heading up a twisting path where his horse’s liable to slip and throw a shoe or break her leg—but he knows people. The Marshal ain’t going to be fooled by them hiding out in just any ordinary town. He’ll never stop until he gets his bounty. Dean says as much to those gathered around the table.
Castiel has to refrain from rolling his eyes. They get that a lot. More times then he could count, really. He knows he takes after their dad, dark hair and the height—but Anna looks more like her mom, from what they can tell from a couple of old photographs.
Charlie had insisted the boys wear blue to fit in with the theme, and apparently all of them had outright rejected her except for Castiel. Lucky him.
“Seriously. The look on his face—I think half the time he’s constipated,” Dean says, grabbing his drink and taking a sip, trying and failing to avoid hitting himself in the face with the ridiculous cocktail umbrella. Charlie puts down her phone, turning fully to face him.
With his human sight, Dean is no less dazzling. Having him so near will be dangerous for Castiel’s concentration, but he needs him, at least for the final part of the incantation.
He had a good day at work, finishing up one of his client’s projects, and he’s looking forward to getting home. He’s in the mood and happy and completely ready to seduce Cas, maybe even break out the pink panties.
He looks up. Dean is seated across from him, his meal untouched as well. His head is drooping, and he’s nodding off into his plate. Luckily, Mother is distracted, signing some parchment for the upcoming ball—but she’s not blind.
Joshua kept much of it going as well as he could, but without a priest, the crowds of people that had once flocked to their doors thinned and melted away. Until there was no one left.
“For disobeying God,” she echoes. And for the first time, her cool composure seems to have been shaken.
With every chime the pounding in Dean’s head seems to increase, his feet falling heavily, his heartbeat louder—
“Honestly, these fancy places should just have that kind of stuff," he grumbles. “Not like any of us are going to steal it, and if we do, it’s just another thing they can charge us for—”
Castiel gently but firmly removes Dean’s hands from his arms, pulling back. He’s still holding his hands, but Dean’s out to orbit now, like an astronaut on a frikkin’ spacewalk.
"I take it back," Sam says thoughtfully, turning it over in his hands. "I suppose these are useful."
He walks shakily forward, wiping his eyes. Gabriel will be safe, he’s still stuck back at the church, and Anna—
The bartender finally comes back, a beer for Sam and whiskey for Dean, which he promptly downs in about three seconds.
Dean walks outside, shivering a little, feeling exposed as he walks over the soft sand, feeling it sink beneath his feet.
The Hell Gate is widening, demons and angels alike getting sucked in. They’re locked in a stalemate, right on the edge. Abaddon digs her heels in, but one wrong step, one slip—
Desmond stares at Dean for a moment, a muscle in his jaw working. But eventually he growls, turning away. Dean lets out a breath, his grip on the gun slippery.
Naomi purses her lips, then disappears. The other woman stands, brushing the long red hair from her face.
Castiel drops, seeing stars. He can feel blood running down his temple, the room spinning around him. He tries to crawl away from her, but the pain becomes too much. He falls, staring up into her terrible power.
swallow him up, drink him down—but Dean was looking at him in that stupid predatory way of his, and it throws him, making his whole body shake as he tries to stay conscious.
“Detention after school with Marv,” she says smartly. “I think that should do the trick, don’t you?”
Anna stands to help Charlie, and Gabriel listens intently as Sam explains, Castiel lost in thought behind them. The conversation shifts to Abaddon again, and Castiel looks up at the mention of her name. A strange chill runs through him.
Castiel leans down, barely brushing Dean’s lips with his own. Dean tries to arch up and kiss him, but Castiel pulls back at the last second, rolling his hips forward once for good measure, delighting in the mumbled curses that follow.
It's old magic, so old, and Dean cowers as the vestiges of it wash through the room, staining his heart.
“Where’s that fucking angel of yours? Huh? Where the hell is Sam? They gonna show their goddamn faces and fix this?”
There’s a slight drift of movement—a twisted black blade, its metal glowing slightly in the darkness.
Slowly, the talk turns to magic, as it inevitably does with witches, and Castiel carefully monitors Dean for any sign that he feels uncomfortable, or left out. But Dean seems unperturbed, even jumping in occasionally with his own knowledge of a particular spell or potion. Sam in particular is interested in Castiel’s practice, and asks him various questions about what his life has been like since leaving school, as well as for some advice on some of the trickier incantations to cast.
They stop at a station that advertises itself with a rusted sign as just south of Cloud Gate. There’s hardly a soul around, just the station master, with his toothless mouth and black cap, gawking at them through the window. The leader doesn’t pay much attention to him. He brushes back his coat, taps his fingers, once, just to draw attention to the revolver on his hip. The station master disappears after that.
He cups his cheek, slowly wiping Dean’s tears away. Dean is quiet, and when Castiel looks up, Dean is staring at Castiel, that beautiful, intense way he always used to watch him—eyes roaming all over Castiel’s face.
“He hasn’t been in that body for long, but that’s always been his name,” Dean rushes out, hands fumbling to touch him.
She beckons, Dean's cue to come forward. Both of them bow, and Dean returns the gesture, forcing a smile.
He beat out with his tiny fists, and his father dragged him away, but not before he managed to swipe at Castiel. His hand passed through him like mist, and Castiel felt a shock, like he had been plunged in icy water.
He takes hold of the ends of the wire, pulling back slowly. The man cuts off with a pitiful gurgle as the wire tightens around his neck, his air supply cut off.
Sam scans the rest of the assembled crowd, and notices that the injured man is conspicuously absent.
Castiel curls around him and bites down gently on his ear in retaliation, rolling his hips forward, just once. Dean clenches, a hissing sound escaping him.
“I almost forgot—got something to show you.” Benny sets down the bottle of whiskey, reaching into his coat pocket. He withdraws a folded piece of paper, sliding it across the bar to Gabriel.
He takes Dean to the edge of the shore, his toes just kissing the water. He glances back at Dean and smiles, before he walks forward, into the water, clothes and all. Dean stares for a moment, then hurriedly starts to shuck his clothes, yanking off his leather hunting boots and his jacket. He leaves the rest of his clothes and starts to wade in tentatively after him.
Castiel yells, throwing himself forward. But Naomi slams him back with a wave of her hand, and he’s thrown to the floor, gasping for breath.
“Cas, I’m surprised,” Max says, his eyes glinting. “You’re not your usual stick in the mud self tonight.”
Sam glares at her for a moment, fuming. Then he jerks back, releasing her. Ruby puts a hand to her throat, breathing harshly.
Castiel gasps, the knife gone from his neck. The lackey demons around him all look around, bewildered, calling for their leader.
Castiel glances up. Dean’s voice is still hazy with the memories of sleep, but his eyes are clear. His voice sobers, and he speaks with conviction.
Dean grabs his wrists, still worried Em might accidentally pull a stitch in the wound in his side—utterly confused by his sudden vehemence.
Dean is amazed, watching the two of them interact. Chevre can be thorny and difficult, especially around new people. He's never seen her act like this around a stranger.
Benny fumes, but glares at him, not even close to forgiveness. Dean places a hand to his temple, feeling the tender swelling there.
His blade clatters to the floor, and distantly—he hears the effects of the spell hitting Sam, too. He struggles to lift his head.
Anna stares at him, frozen, her expression a mixture of fear and shock and anger. Sam shakes his head.
He throws his bag down next to the piano in the second practice room, flopping onto the bench. He rage warms up with some Prokofiev, and by the time he’s finished the final chord, he feels slightly better. Still a little miffed. He glances towards the wall, but he can’t hear anything. Dean grumbles. Dude stole his room and wasn’t even going to play?
“Screw God, and screw his apocalypse,” she says, fire burning in her eyes. “We’re taking the fight to them.”
But Christ, it’s hot. Heat shimmers over the sand, making the trees in the distance dance, dark shapes moving on the horizon.
He starts to resent this ‘D. Winchester’—Castiel doesn’t know if they made a mistake, if they actually live in his building and just put the wrong apartment number—or if this is something else entirely. But he’s starting to get pissed at the seemingly endless stream of coupons and catalogues and envelopes. He steals a labelmaker from work and prints his name out in all caps, sticking it on his box so it can’t possibly be missed.
He gestures towards the sheriff’s hands, who gratefully extends them. Castiel slips the key from his pocket, but instead of setting him loose, he swiftly undoes one of the cuffs and locks it onto the support beam next to the sheriff’s head. Winchester whips his eyes on Castiel, snarling.
Castiel spares a moment from the road to glance at Dean. He’s taking in the car around him, his lip curling.
She turns back to Chevre, cooing softly. Dean moves up too, patting her neck. Anna runs her fingers through Chevre's mane, looking up.
Sam stands, washing his hands in the metal basin beside the bed. Emmanuel groans, his teeth clenched, eyes skittering under his lids.
The table is back now, the cherry bowl sitting there, undisturbed. Castiel paces in front of it, dropping a shaking hand to his wrist, gripping at his mother’s rosary. He clings to it, muttering under his breath.
“If you knew,” Gabriel whispers. “If I find out you knew something and you could've stopped this, I'll—”
He grabs Cas, spinning him around and pinning him against the tree they’ve been hiding behind. This time, there’s no hesitation, and Cas seems to melt into the kiss, arms winding around Dean’s neck.
“Sand in the dick,” Cas mutters, but he lets Dean pull him in, hands coming to settle on his waist. “Very romantic.”
Branches whip at his face, stinging his skin with thin cuts. The moon lights his way, and there, around the curve of the forest, the edge of the lake—
“Your—your name is Anna Grace Milton—“ Castiel stutters out. “You were born in 1987, you came to live with us when you were five—“
“Uh uh. No way. There will be none of your usual goofing around, you got that? I’ve been chasing this guy for way too long for your unprofessional behavior to blow this.”
He pulls him down, pressing their foreheads together before their lips, sharing a deep and heated kiss.
“Why the hell is a Natasha Bedingfield song playing right now?” Sam wonders, and Castiel chokes on his champagne.
“How did they find me? The angels.” He feels a twist of panic. “And now—won’t they—won’t they come back?”
Sam and Charlie are the only ones left. Charlie has a gash in her arm, grace weakly shining through, her nose bloody. Sam’s hands are still locked tight on Castiel’s, but he can’t bring himself to struggle. They all stare at her in horror.
He pulls out the leather parcel, the money they lifted off the thief back in the desert. He’s kept it close this entire time, to make sure it reached its destination. He sets it on the table in front of her, unwrapping it. For a moment she simply stares at the money, then looks back up at Castiel.
And Dean can’t help but appreciate Max's lean, sturdy build, just about his same height—and those hazel eyes, fixed on his own.
It’s an impertinent comment. Dean raises an eyebrow, but the man doesn’t seem to notice the slight. He continues, moving noisily over the thick dirt of the forest floor. Dean notices that he’s barefoot.
Emmanuel chuckles, and continues to spread the lather over his chin. Dean’s managed to develop a decent beard over the last—two weeks, he thinks it’s been? But he’s never liked having one, and this’ll be a welcome relief. Even if he is letting a criminal stick a blade to his throat.
“We gotta meet up with the others right now.” Charlie whips out her phone. “We gotta get these two idiots together.”
Anna and Gabriel both support Castiel, slinging his arms over their shoulders. Castiel is ghost-white, almost unconscious.
“If you did know, you never would have gone after that blade,” Balthazar snaps. “You needed a weapon. I was trying to help—”
He clomps up the steps and places the posters on the desk, dropping the heavy letter bag into Sam’s lap.
“CAN IT!” Bobby roars, and the room falls silent. Jo is holding Anna back, holding on tightly to her arm. She’s pale and worried too, but she’s controlling it well. Gabriel is still glaring at Dean, his hands curled into fists. From behind him, Sam is watching, hand itching towards his gun in case things turn sour.
Dean swallows, jerked back into reality. He realizes it’s been a good ten seconds since Castiel made his request, and Dean’s just been standing here, ogling him like an idiot.
Waiting there had been an entire flock of swans. That itself would have been odd, but when they transformed, right before his eyes, Sam thought some sort of madness had seized him, some sinister and dangerous hallucination.
Within 15 minutes they’re on the road. Castiel drives her into town so she can jack a car, and once she finds one, they both speed away, tires squealing on the pavement.
After he finishes taping on the new bandage, he cautiously creaks open the door. He can’t hear anything. Maybe they finally went to bed.
“I must start the musicians," she says lightly. Then she glances at Castiel. "Ask the man to dance will you?”
Dean kisses him again, slow and deep, their lips parting after a breathless eternity. Emmanuel opens his eyes, staring at Dean with a fondness that he hasn't seen before. It ignites something warm in Dean's chest.
There’s the distant cry of a crow. The chiming of the bell tower from the center of the town. Distant. Soft.
“YES,” Castiel yells, frustrated. “There is no D. Winchester living here, there has never been a D. Winchester living here, and there will never
“I don’t want to hear anything about last night,” Eileen says aloud, her eyes hard. “Let’s just get through this.”
“Naomi—she had finally crawled out of Hell, and the first thing she did was gun straight for you. Christ, you can’t have been more than six. She was going to
“The only way to defeat Abaddon for good is to lock her back up,” she says. “If we somehow get our hands on that blade again, we can kill one, maybe—if we get our one in a million chance. No way we can do two.”
. They won’t even be able to take Cas’s present―Benny’s been charged with chauffeuring it to and from the Roadhouse.
, her eyes going soft. Dean barely notices. He’s utterly frozen, staring at Cas, his cheek tingling.
Anna bolts forward towards Gabriel, who’s on the ground, struggling and swearing up a storm. Once Emmanuel sees, he curses and drops his gun, rushing to Gabriel's side. Anna is pulling on Gabriel’s arm, trying to yank him up—but there’s so much blood—
Anna looks up from her kneeled position, knife in hand, and she pales. Gabriel immediately takes a step back. Dean is standing behind them, his eyes hard.
Dean nips and bites at his skin, kissing away the bruises from earlier with a wash of grace on his tongue. He drags the wet tip of his mouth against the line of his leg and Castiel can’t help it—he cries out—
Anna heads back over to Sam, who’s already kneeling, tracing out the sigils on the floor. Gabriel comes back from his sweep outside, tucking his gun into his belt.
The room goes cold. He feels like he's been plunged into freezing water—and he starts to shiver, his skin prickling, breath coming out in icy puffs.
The outlaw had been tearing a streak across the new lawless West, still in between wilderness and civilization. After the rush for gold, the population boomed, but the law hadn’t followed the masses of people. Too much activity, not enough government. When Bobby brought the two of them out here, he hadn’t dared bring them past Colorado, simply for fear of surviving. California was too much of a gamble. All the gold was gone, and everything else was risky.
But Dean favors his right. Castiel's noticed—sometimes Dean will pull back, not taking the next blow because it's a left-handed move. A weakness that Castiel could exploit. Perhaps because he's an angel, Dean had always relied on strength. Castiel's going to have to be smart.
He trails off as he the one called Raphael strides across the clearing, leaning down to whisper in the ear of—
“Two weeks is not nearly enough time, but I guess we could always extend our trip,” he continues, brow furrowing slightly. “I’d love to go to Honolulu, if we could swing it, ‘cause there’s this book I checked out from the library―”
Like Dean knows Castiel will drink milk in his coffee but never sugar. He hates cilantro, so much that he’ll sit and pick it out of whatever he’s eating before he takes a single bite. He tolerates action movies but loves westerns, despises getting up early, and always tips, no matter what. He’s rebellious and contrarian to the point of fucking insanity—but is incredibly kind. And gentle. And—
Before she can ask what that's supposed to mean, the man quickly checks his watch again, speaking brusquely.
Dean narrows his eyes, wondering what Castiel could possibly have to talk to Sam about. Cas straightens, trying to look sober, and missing by a mile.
It had been sixty-two days since his last angel visit when the air is filled with another rush of wings. Castiel doesn’t even bother to look up from his book.
Odd. Winchester must be enjoying being in a real town again. He supposes it’s been the first time since they…
He stands slowly, crouching to check the supports on the tarp. Should last them the night. Otherwise they'll be in for a rude awakening, if the thing collapses and dumps rainwater on them all.
Dean kicks out, but Hull socks him in the stomach, and Dean doubles over, groaning. The man seizes his wrists and hauls them over one of the beams, the cuffs around his wrists digging into the wood, just tall enough that Dean’s boots are scraping the ground. Three circle around him, grinning. One pulls a knife.
Castiel rolls his eyes, bending down to look at the shelves on the far wall. Some curse boxes, some innocent-looking glass trinkets, a few stakes scattered here and there. Doesn't seem to be any method to the madness, any sort of organization. Someone really oughta clean this place up.
“As close to pure ethanol as you can legally get,” Gabe says, taking a large gulp of his own. “Cheers.”
The judge stops again as an angry murmur sweeps through the courtroom. Dean looks down, clenching his jaw.
He peers at the infant struggling in his father’s arms. A small boy, eyes bright and green, hands grasping in Castiel’s direction. His mother brushes a hand through her son’s hair, smiling warmly at Castiel.
Sam stands, backing away. Maybe it was an accident. Dean’s never had to use his gun on anyone before...perhaps he panicked and fled? No, that made no sense. Dean promised Pam. Dean never goes back on a promise.
Anna's face is blank, and she’s fidgeting underneath the stiff wool of her black dress. Castiel eyes the people that walk past, glaring at those that stop to murmur their condolences, to say empty words of regret and sadness. He doesn’t want to hear it. He just wants to get away.
Barely twenty minutes later, they’ve got a confirmed collar from Jo, and Dean spots the buyer—a suspicious looking character who’s been loitering, moving closer to the bush.
Cas falls back against the sheets and Dean climbs on top of him, kissing him deeply as he drags his hands down his chest. Cas brings his hand to cup the back of Dean’s head as he kisses him, slow, but demanding, nipping slightly at his bottom lip as his other hand digs into Dean’s hip. Dean presses forward slowly, letting the anticipation and heat build.
He heads down the narrow hallway to the main area of the church, stopping in the doorway. The pews have been cleared away to the sides, and Dean is standing in the middle of the dusty floor, taking off his jacket.
“Charlie sent me,” she says snippily. “She said she was busy, but she needs some ginger and rhubarb. Right away.”
The outlaw finishes packing up and swings onto his horse, and Dean makes to do the same, keeping his hands low, looking demure. He stops next to his horse, hesitating. Anna glances over.
The smiles slides off Abaddon’s face. She steps slowly around him again, passing through the remains of her demons, the stench of sulfur in the air.
something,” the man continues, hushed, like a confession. “I was in bed, I was almost asleep—but then…I heard it. In my head, clear as a bell.”
He quickly dons his hunting jacket. He doesn’t bother with his bow this time, instead strapping his knife to his belt. He crosses to the door and locks it, almost giddy with the idea of what he's about to do.
Emmanuel shrugs his arm out of Gabriel’s grip and heads to his horse, tightening the saddle. Gabriel follows him, turning red.
“She’s much too busy now to deal with petty matters such as this,” she says airily, twirling her blade deftly in her fingers. “But she is angry with you, Dean,” she simpers. “Very angry.”
Castiel slices his arm, ignoring the sting of pain as he starts on the sigil, tracing out quick lines on the window of his car. He can feel Dean staring at him in horror.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean says, jokingly puffing out his chest. “I’m stronger than I look. Kinda happens when you haul bags of fertilizer around all day.”
A stab of horror and guilt and pain twists his stomach, and Castiel brings a hand to his mouth, shaking his head.
Hannah, who Castiel has always liked, gives him a warm smile and clasps his hands, telling him how much they missed him. Castiel agrees with the sentiment, but he can barely focus during their conversation, continually darting his eyes towards the end of the line.
She steps forward, and Sam immediately brings up his blade, dropping into a defensive stance. Abaddon pauses.
Splotchy, discolored bruises are covering his whole body, blossoming on his legs, his wrists, his arms—all in the unmistakable shape of fingerprints.
Castiel grabs Dean's arm and they jump onto the back of the cart, landing hard. Castiel immediately scrambles towards him, hand finding Dean's face.
He glances up at the window again. He can only imagine what Anna would say if she came back right now, seeing him curled around Dean like this. Castiel would probably never hear the end of it.
Then Raphael turns, retreating to the edge of the glade. He crosses his arms and does not speak again, fuming in silence.
Abaddon glares at him with hatred in her eyes, standing slowly. She brushes gravel from her torn black jacket, her hand shaking in anger. Alastair spins his blade in his hand, lilting his voice.
Dean quickly slips the ring on the chain, and beckons Castiel closer. Castiel leans forward, allowing Dean to fasten the chain around his neck. Castiel places a hand on the ring, feeling cold metal and the fluttering of his heartbeat beneath his palm.
were supposed to be the one trapped in Hell—Alastair wouldn’t be able to get to you, and Abaddon would be free, free to take her vessel, free to take the world, no competition—nothing stopping her.”
“It’s no trouble,” Castiel says slowly, but there’s something tugging at his instincts, telling him something is wrong.
She’s sweet, she’s smart, she takes no shit and gives Sam just as much sass back. Dean did have this weird unfounded grudge against her at first, most likely because he knew her as Cas’s best friend—you can’t spend that much time with someone without getting eau-de-asshole on you—but as he got to know her, Dean realized Eileen was just the kind of person he would want Sam to settle down with.
He grabs Dean’s shirt and drags him forward. Dean is caught off balance and nearly falls on top of him, just stopping himself short. Emmanuel is staring up at him.
Castiel cannot speak, in shock. He never knew. He’d always thought...after that conversation, that Dean had left without so much as a glance back.
“Kinda chaos right now.” Dean shrugs. “And they didn’t tell me much. Just to jailbreak you and sit tight,” he says, glancing at Castiel.
He talks faster now, letting every frustration and fear spill out, every reason he didn’t want to do this in the first place.
Her fingers dig into the beads, and they cut painfully into his skin, straining against their cord. Castiel weakly shakes his head.
Castiel’s throat constricts. He can’t bring himself to speak. He can’t believe it—that all this time there had been something, something
The leader pulls out a pair of cuffs, and snaps them on Dean’s wrists, quick as a snake. Dean curses, yanking at the irons. The outlaw sneers.
Dean grips at his hand, a relentless sweet ache blooming in his chest. He’s not good with words, not like Cas, so he doesn’t say what he really wants to say, like
Once he gets to his quarters and the door slides closed behind him, Castiel sinks back against it, dropping his head in his hands.
Castiel can’t even think about demons, or danger—he throws himself to Anna's side and pulls her into his lap, fumbling to stem the river of red pooling through his fingers.
He falls, practically on top of Castiel, but Castiel rolls out of it, kicking Dean off. He grabs the blade and whirls—but Dean is up already, grabbing his forearm.
"Damn,” he hears her say, watching as Cas walks carefully back to Sam, beers in hand. “I’d like to get on that.”
He looks at the outlaws, and wonders if he knows any of their names. News was slow to get to their town, and oftentimes the men and women who struck towns robbed ‘em dry and never stayed long enough to give a name.
The grief at those words is evident in every line of Charlie’s face, and Castiel is suddenly struck by how distraught, how tired, how ancient she looks.
But despite all his scoldings, when Dean slides a hand to his back, Castiel willingly leans in, settling into his arms and closing his eyes. Dean seems to have regained a little bit of his senses, and he runs cool fingers down his chest, his stomach, wrapping around Castiel’s still aching cock, stroking him gently. Castiel sucks in a breath and ducks his head, trembling.
Dean pulls back a little, almost looking shocked for a second. But then he laughs, those beautiful eyes crinkling with a smile.
Dean swallows, trying not to think about the drop below them. Cas is a solid and warm presence at his back, but Dean just wants to get vertical as soon as humanly possible.
When they get out of the twisty maze between the hills and out to the plain, Dean is no more than a stone’s throw away. He can tell the man is panicked, and the horse is no better, chomping at the bit, twitchy under an ill-tightened saddle. They’re facing west now, no longer on the trail, but out in the scrublands. To get back to any sort of road, they'll have to go back the way they came.
The jacket. It’s on the chair next to his bed, folded neatly. He hasn’t touched it since they moved back to the church.
Castiel is motionless, just staring at her. She really is beautiful, in a terrible sort of way. Her lips peel back to reveal too-white teeth, her smile sweet and gentle.
I did not tell him, for I falsely believed my presence could keep that latent hate at bay. I never saw the warning signs. Or perhaps I chose to ignore them.
The man glances at the two of them, but fills up the glass without a word, then setting one in front of Sam. Sam brings it up to his lips without the intention of really drinking it, and wrinkles his nose at the smell. He sets the glass back down.
“I have things to give too, Cas,” she says, her eyes brimming with tears. “There’s people that I love. That I would die for—”
He’s not sure if it was his own voice, or the sheriff’s—but he’s only conscious of his back hitting the canyon floor, white hot pain radiating from his gut.
"It's not because—no. You have a family, alright?" Castiel chokes back the fear in his throat. "We're gonna get you back to them. Okay?”
was a real event that happened in 1863, during the Civil War, where a Confederate group known as Quantrill's raiders attacked and destroyed the town of Lawrence, killing about 160 people. Lawrence was a target because it was a well-known anti-slavery town, and William Quantrill was a Confederate leader. The famous outlaw Jesse James and his brother Frank belonged to this group and it is believed they took part in the raid on Lawrence.
The bewildered serving man quickly obliges, then backs away, bowing as he goes. Dean scowls and turns away, bringing the cup to his lips.
He beckons her over to his own car—a van that should have been put out of its misery before it even rolled off the line—but Anna secretly loves it. Goofy and practical, in an endearing sort of way.
Dean’s lips press against his, Dean’s hands are on his face, warm and electric, and for a moment, Castiel is frozen, stiff with shock.
“That was the idea,” he murmurs back, his voice slipping into a lower octave. Dean shivers, a pleasant warm feeling running through his belly. His grip on Cas’s waist turns more insistent, his small rutting motions getting more and more desperate as he tries to seek friction against him in the slippery water.
Castiel had never really liked knives, preferring the cool detachment of guns. But he had sparred with Anna, Gabriel, even his father a couple times, and he had always thought himself the best out of any of them.
“Why would I, when I have you to tell me everything?” Cas says gently, propping his chin on Dean’s elbow.
Dean nods desperately and wraps his arms around him, holding him in a grip that’s just shy of painful, but Castiel trusts him. Dean would never hurt him.
Dean drops softly from the ledge, feet hitting the ground with a muffled sound. He glances around, but the yard is empty, as always. He makes his ways to the stables, anticipation quickening his steps.
That he was wrong. That he never was against love, not really. That he was just being a coward, afraid of getting hurt again. And that Charlie and Alicia are so stupidly happy together that it makes Dean
“I can think of some motel beds that might disagree with you,” he retorts, rocking back and twisting his hips.
He runs the razor carefully over his cheeks, clearing away the foam and slipping cool water over his skin. He’s starting to feel like himself again.
Sam sucks in a breath. Two days—that’s nothing. He could catch up if he pushed his horse—perhaps maybe with a hard day's ride.
Everything’s on autopilot, like always, but he likes to check the nav-console by hand, every once in a while, if nothing but to prove his usefulness. Wouldn't do to have the computer shift a few degrees without anyone noticing and end up halfway to Alpha Centauri.
A flash of lightning burns through room, illuminating the faces of the terrified guests. Thunder shakes the building.
“And why would I help you?” Sam throws over his shoulder, just to buy himself some time to think. “I don’t trust you—I don’t know the first thing about you. You just murdered three people in front of me.”
He blinks up dazedly at the ceiling, his eyes burning in the harsh brightness above him. He can’t pick out any individual lights—it’s just an endless glare, illuminating every last corner of the room, nowhere to hide.
Benny stares back at the pair of them, looking over Castiel with a suspicious eye. Dean’s temper flares.
He's flipping through the book Gabriel gave him, wondering if they should take a stab at the summoning spell—when an ear-splitting noise sounds from outside, shattering the dark night. A car alarm.
“Either that, or you’re here to be part of the posse to hunt the sons of bitches down. Hate to break it to you, kid, but we ain’t got nobody to chase down.” He sniffs, crossing his arms. “Nobody real, anyway.”
“Then what is it, Anna?” He shouts. “Try to explain this in a way that could make it sound any less fucked up then it is!”
His mother continues to eat her soup, seemingly unperturbed, but Dean can see how white her knuckles are on the spoon. Sam is looking back and forth between the two of them, his eyes wide.
He doesn’t know why he gives a damn. He shouldn’t—but the man before him is hurting, raw and real, and Dean just wants to fix it.
Castiel shakes his head, the uncomfortable dizziness of teleportation making it hard for him to think. He puts out a hand on Anna’s shoulder to steady himself, and he can hear her asking him something, Sam’s frantic question—
Castiel's starting to think maybe he's schizophrenic, or that he dreamed the whole thing up. Anna and Gabriel certainly seem to think so.
“Once the train stops, you get on board,” he says. “Safe should be in the luggage car towards the back. We’ll lead you from there.”
He passes by the doors that lead to the spacious outdoor pool area, quickly spotting his friends clustered around a group of lounge chairs. And to his displeasure, sees Dean walking towards them as well, a drink in his hand. Just another thing to add to Castiel’s bad mood.
“I’m not going over this again,” Dean says, standing. “And now we’ve picked apart Dean Winchester’s psyche, fan-freakin-tastic. So you know why I don’t want to give a speech, so stop pressuring me.”
Dean holds his gaze, hoping that it comes off as commanding, despite the fact that he's sitting on the floor. He senses the challenge there, but a kind of stubborn integrity—a quality that the others at court severely lack. Something in Dean relaxes.
He doesn’t seem deterred by Castiel’s sudden quietness, and he fills the silence with absent talk. He jokes, he teases Castiel about his own tattoo (“On your back? Really?”) and then he cleans up, telling Castiel to get some rest.
He’s not really sure what to do. Dean is putting the room back together, darting about unsteadily as he gathers his clothes, pulling on his jeans, not looking at him.
Ruby looks at him for a long moment, but then she stands, sweeping away from him again. She rolls up her long sleeves, exposing her tanned skin to the jumping candlelight.
“I can’t guarantee it will be painless,” she says carelessly. “Then again, they say your brain shuts down towards the end, so maybe you’ll avoid the worst of it.”
“Well,” he says softly. He draws back the side of his jacket, revealing a dark red patch at his side.
He breathes again, but now the air feels stale and hot, suffocating in the cramped space. He tries not to think
Dean swallows, looking as well. The sky is lightening, no longer black but a deep blue, the stars disappearing. Castiel is silent, but his face is a storm of conflict—a sort of longing tinged with sadness—too heartbreaking for words.
For a moment, they’re both still—but then Cat gets up, slowly approaching him. Dean doesn’t dare move, for fear of spooking it again. He has no designs, no intention to try to capture the cat, or to snatch the key. All the same, he keeps his distance, simply holding out his palm.
Cas swears under his breath and quickly strips Dean of his boxers, leaving him bare. He settles himself in between Dean’s legs, and spreads him open, tongue warm and wet, and―
He stands there for a moment, eyeing his phone and debating with himself about whether or not to call Anna. Then there’s a creak of movement behind him, and he turns, his heart in his mouth.
A few hours later finds them in a shallow dell near the tracks, a couple miles out from Clayton, opposite a line of outlaws.
Once they dispose of the bodies with the help of some angelic firepower, they head back to the car. Ever polite, Gabriel pipes right up.
He’s spared when his coffee gets there a moment later, able to ignore Dean as he sucks down the heavenly black liquid. He relaxes a little as he feels its energy settle and jump beneath his skin.
Castiel watches Dean go, an uneasy curl in his throat. The brief flare of vengeful satisfaction is already leeching away, leaving him feeling brittle and hollow.
“Oh, shit, no, he—he agreed to it, angels need permission—“ He says quickly. “It’s nothing like what demons do.”
The two of them stand, Gabriel a little clumsily, swinging his coat over his shoulders. Dean frowns, following them.
Behind them, there’s the thunderous sound of hooves, Sam and another rider—pulling up sharply when they see the madness unfolding before them.
“You can’t keep it, and you can’t forget,” Dean says distractedly. “I’ll be there, on that day, and I want you to meet me. That’s the only way I can make sure I’ll be able to find you again.”
Dean gives him an exaggerated wink. His heart’s beating a mile a minute, but with nothing for it to sit and wait, he leans forward, grabbing the menu.
Sam breathes in, slowly dabbing at his nose again. He's really starting to wonder what he's gotten himself into.
Sam is standing behind them, his face pulled into a forced smile. Dean doesn’t tear his eyes away from Castiel’s. They stare at each other, locked in stalemate.
“Kiss me,” Dean says breathlessly, and Castiel obliges, bending up to him. They meet in the middle, and Dean crushes him to his chest.
The words barely leave her mouth before Dean’s hand is clamped around Castiel's wrist, and they’re falling backward.
Benny gets an arm around him and hauls him up. Dean is able to stand, but he still feels a little unsteady.
He had been stuck in this inane conversation for the last twenty minutes—after talking to Charlie, Sam had come back with Alicia and Gabriel in tow, and they all decided to hit the dance floor. Dean’s feet were starting to kill him (No one said Batman ever wore comfortable boots) and he opted to sit for awhile, and had gotten trapped into conversation with a guy in a vampire getup. Yes, Dean works in neuroprosthetics. Yes, his company is a startup. Yes, it is expensive. No, he’s not going to explain what the word ‘prosthetic’ means.
Castiel curls a hand into the sheets below him. It has to be the blood loss. He's delirious. He'll get some sleep and it'll all make sense in the morning.
Anna holds out her hand, eyeing Castiel cautiously, as if he's about to charge. He clenches his fists, glaring as she grabs a towel, kneeling and turning to the man on the floor.
Christ, he’s starving. Dean scarfs it up, every last carrot and chunk of potato, wiping up the remnants of the stew with a bit of brown bread they give him. None of the others speak either, eating in silence.
Maybe it’s the delirium Castiel’s slipping into, maybe it’s the heat of sex clouding his brain—but he imagines Dean splitting himself, roaming all over his body. Some angelic part of him that gave him the ability to touch Castiel everywhere, a hand locked tight around his ankle, another palming up his leg as the fingers inside slowly tease him, sliding and stretching.
“Have you gone mad?” He hisses, pulling Dean back sharply. “This is who you choose, to bring to a ball, the night you are to be engaged? What spell has he put you under—“
He slowly reaches out, exploring his prison. One palm presses against the wood above him, the other wandering, over the side and down to his leg—pausing when he brushes over a hard lump.
“Gabriel. Kindly go stick your head in a toilet,” Castiel says dryly, now reading the latest police report.
Trying to wrap his head around the fact that an actual angel of the Lord is working at a tech shop in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, USA—Castiel pulls out his wallet, insisting on paying. Charlie beckons him over to the register, an amused look on her face after seeing Castiel and Anna bicker over the model, the color, and then exactly which bogus credit card to use.
“In my Father’s house there are many rooms,” Dean recites softly. “If it were not so, would I have told you that I go, to prepare a place for you?”
“You’ll be fine,” he tells him, trying to keep the fear out of his voice. “Fine, you hear me? Sam or Charlie’s going to fix you up, and you’ll be okay. It’ll be okay—”
The man raises his hands in surrender, his eyes unreadable. Castiel keeps the barrels trained on him just in case, even though it had been just as effective in hurting him as the knife had been.
Dean feels the armrest lift, and then Cas is pulling Dean close, as best as they can with their seatbelts and limited space. He starts speaking in low tones, so only Dean can hear.
"I did not even think," he says softly. "Not of the danger, or that I might be hurt." He pauses, his hand soft on Dean's. "I just could not let you be harmed."
“Don’t you dare look down your nose at me, Sammael,” she says sharply. “If I recall correctly, you were the one locked up in Heaven’s jail for centuries, not me.”
Castiel doesn’t blink. He snatches it out of the air, staring Dean down. He spins it a couple times in his palm, getting a firm grip. Castiel takes slow steps around him, taking in his position and planning his next attack.
Castiel doesn’t want to seem weak, but he doesn’t have much strength left. He lets Dean carry him, feeling himself sat down on the edge of the bed.
They walk home, talking lightly, of the party, their friends, taking their time. They leave the lighted streets of the main city and walk the dark lane to Dean’s house, and Castiel lifts his hand, sending a brilliant sparkle of silver light into the air. It curls and twists beautifully into a glowing ball above their heads, hovering gently above them, illuminating the rest of the way home. Dean smiles at the little light. Mom used to make something similar, but it was golden in color, and warm like the sun. Sometimes Sam would try to recreate the spell, faint little wisps of light spinning from his fingertips.
It’s the same girl from the wanted poster Ruby showed him. The girl who matches the description of every person they’ve asked from here to Creede.
Michael’s pale yellow eyes have fallen to the ring around Castiel’s neck. He hooks a talon through the chain, his pupils shrinking.
For a moment, Anna looks hesitant, and Castiel sees it—that slight edge of unease on her face that they hadn’t been able to shake in the past couple of days.
Emmanuel motions towards the middle of camp where Gabriel has started the fire, and they sit next to it, Dean silent as Emmanuel begins to wrap the reddened raw skin of Dean’s wrists, binding them in white linen.
Damn. Dean must’ve really dug through his father’s stores. Castiel doesn’t even recognize some of them, and he thought he knew the library top to bottom, down to the last dusty page.
“C’mon, I gotta see his face,” he tells Jess. He’s smiling too, practically glowing. Dean raises his eyebrows.
Dean briefly interrupts his channel surfing to give a patented Winchester Eye Roll. Sam dutifully ignores him, propping his feet up on the couch.
“Well, you certainly can’t stay here,” Meg says haughtily. “I prefer my wrists without a pair of manacles around them.”
He pulls Castiel back and plops him down on the bed. Castiel tries to protest—but his vision fades and his gut twists, making him double over. He seizes the bedspread, gasping.
Gabriel draws himself up to his full height, even though Castiel’s still got at least three inches on him.
Luke staggers back and Castiel’s already on his feet and moving—though his body screams in protest. He gets three good hits before Luke regains his footing—he grabs Castiel’s arm and throws him backward, the impact knocking the air from his lungs. Castiel whirls, trying to shove himself up—and a shot explodes next to his ear, temporarily deafening him. Castiel drops to his knees, ears ringing.
But they kept coming. Nearly every day, and nearly all of it junk. Castiel googled it, of course, after wondering what the hell to do—and the internet gave him plenty of advice. He could just chuck it, he could open it (technically a federal felony, but who would be able to check?), or write return to sender.
He stretches a hand out to the other side of the bed, cracking open an eye when he finds it empty. Before Dean can feel disappointment about missing out on some pre-wedding canoodling, he spots the note on the pillow.
Abaddon walks slowly over to him, and Castiel reels, catching a whiff of perfume, the scent of roses.
Sam’s hazel eyes are on his, wide, anxious, but utterly honest. As if he’s worried Dean will think less of him.
“No,” she says firmly. “We’re gonna stop this. Without any predetermined plan. We’re gonna stop this with the best thing we’ve got.”
“Riding off by yourself—you’re lucky Seward told me directly instead of the captain of the guard—he would have had the whole castle out in search for you, if he wasn’t afraid of losing his head—”
The air explodes with noise and fire. The building is no longer empty—a sudden mass of bodies, angels at Alastair’s back, demons behind Abaddon—and they clash against each other, everything collapsing around them. Fire and bursts of grace, power being thrown—the smash of wood and stone, bodies falling to the floor—singed clothes and explosions, screams shattering the night.
The lie is easier this time. Castiel recounts his story of waking up in the grave, and Gabriel doesn’t interrupt, his hands clasped and his brow furrowed.
“I am,” Sam cuts in, before Abby can answer. “I trained as a doctor. I saved your man, despite what you care.”
Castiel grabs her wrist and drags her down so they can both press their ears to the earpiece, listening hard. There’s no immediate answer.
Dean quiets and lets Castiel examine his hand, then clean his skin and wind a bandage around the wound.
They all cope in different ways. Anna runs, going farther every day. She can’t control her mind, but she at least can control her body. So she runs, as if she could sweat it out, purge herself of the last traces of Raphael and magic, and finally feel clean again. The burn in her muscles at the end of each day reminds her that she’s alive. They survived this.
Yet, still—I remained faithful. I obeyed even as I stayed on Earth. I spoke to no one, never revealed my presence. I operated under the belief that I was protecting my charge.
He slips his hand beneath fabric to touch Castiel’s skin. Castiel’s breath hitches as Dean's hands brush over his side.
He steps forward, uncertain. She grabs his arm and before Sam can resist, she’s pulling him into an alcove, clapping a hand over his mouth.
“Breaking the rules, it’s…” He sighs. “It’s the worst possible thing for an angel. And when I pulled you out, I went against a direct order.”
“It’s okay,” he murmurs, so low that Dean almost doesn’t hear. “We got him. We got him now. But we got to take it easy.”
, even though most of them are pushing or past thirty, and Dean hasn’t done shots since college. Then they blindfold the pair of them, Cas muttering curses under his breath the entire time, to play Pin the Kiss on a life-sized poster of Indiana Jones, (which, okay, rude―Dean told Charlie that Harrison Ford was his bisexual awakening in
Daphne is the first to approach them, and she gushes for nearly five minutes, mostly ignoring Dean as she lavishes praise on Castiel. Dean is too astounded to say much of anything, and mostly bites his lip to stifle his laughter as she continues to prattle on. Castiel is very gracious about the whole thing, but his sideways glances towards Dean have him on the dangerous verge of bursting out laughing.
“I’m proposing an alliance,” she says. “We’re looking for the same man. Only makes sense for us to work together.” She crosses her arms. “And I’m damn good at what I do. But it ain’t worth shit if no one will give me the time of day, simply because I’m me.”
Dean doesn’t remember choosing to move, but then he’s next to Emmanuel on the bed, one hand on his cheek. Emmanuel falls into him, almost in his lap, forehead dropping against his.
So quietly, he almost didn’t hear it—the lock clicks. Dean shoves the door open, stopping dead at the scene in front of him.
“Gabriel, look,” she starts softly. “I know you’re angry. And hurting. They are-they...they were my family, too.”
Castiel edges around closer to the doorway. Both of them come into view, standing at odds amid Gabe’s weed-filled garden, glaring at each other.
She had been acting strange and cold towards him all morning, but with all the errands and running around, Sam really hadn’t had time to ask her about it. Come to think of it, Gabriel had been acting cagey too. Maybe Sam had signed something wrong and accidentally insulted her. Wouldn’t be the first time. First time he’d attempted to sign something to Eileen, he’d done the ASL equivalent of flipping her off.
So he had rebuilt it. From the ground up. All traces of life were gone—the plants and those beautiful roses—so Castiel had to start from scratch, with the seeds, the soil, everything. He worked hard, threw himself into the project—toiled everyday until it was close, as close as he could make it to the way it had been back then.
He’s short, and Castiel straightens up a bit when he sees him. He might be an angel, but at least Castiel had the height advantage.
Castiel just chuckles, prising Dean’s hand from his arm. Dean’s stomach twists as Cas locks their fingers together, slowly stretching his arm out. Below them, the city lights twinkle, mirroring the stars dancing around them.
They dart out the doorway, running from the guard, who shouts when he sees them, but they quickly lose him in the twisting halls of the basement, before spilling out a side door, panting.
A couple, walking hand in hand. The girl is looking up at the guy adoringly, his smile dazzlingly bright.
Castiel starts trembling, and Dean holds him, taking Castiel’s hands and bringing their foreheads together. He holds him there, an anchor, pulling him close even though Castiel’s eyes are burning so bright, it hurts.
Castiel breathes, and wills his muscles to work, wrapping his arms around his angel. He cranes his neck up to kiss him, when he sees something.
Sam’s got a better prize, someone wanted for stealing livestock, going for a pretty thousand. He tacks it up next to Dean’s, holding out his hand for the hammer.
“Only the sword of an archangel can kill another archangel. I’ve never even seen one,” he adds, a little bitterly.
“Still don’t understand why he’s got to meet us somewhere else,” she says, after a minute. “He’s my guardian, right? He knows where I am at all times—isn’t that part of the job description?”
She stands, straightening the leather of her jacket. She hasn’t bothered to wash off the blood, Naomi notes.
With a great screech and shudder, the train comes to a stop. In addition to cargo, the Pacific Flyer is also carrying passengers, which means they gotta work fast. There's always someone who tries to be a hero.
Cas obliges, and it isn’t long before Dean is panting, warmth curling in his gut, Cas’s hand on Dean’s dick and his mouth on his neck.
Castiel just waves a hand, sinking into the chair by the desk. Anna grabs the med kit, for real this time, and she sits down across from him, reaching for his hands.
“Sums up the last fifteen years of us knowing each other.” He reaches out tentatively, fingers brushing Castiel’s. “Don’t you think?”
with. One prattled on about her passion for jousts for nearly half an hour, one claimed a love for poetry but could not name a single poet—and there had been one girl, towards the end—a tiny red-haired thing who made salacious comments under her breath, looking like she wanted to eat him alive.
Emotions are running high. Everyone is running around in a flurry, stressed over the preparations for the ball tomorrow.
“I’m calling your parents, Castiel. And I’ll let them know you’ll be at our house for dinner tonight.”
"We all do, I do—“ She cuts off, a muscle in her jaw clenching. “You think Sam doesn’t need you? Or Anna? And Cas most of all—“
Dean feels his carefully constructed world begin to break, the grip on what he knew to be right and wrong begin to shatter. The law was supposed to be good, supposed to protect people—that's why Dean became a goddamn sheriff in the first place, so that no one under his protection would have to suffer, to go through anything similar to what he and Sammy had gone through.
They had taken down most of Morgan's men in the shootout, but the ones who were left are all here, clustered around the new Marshal, like they were worried Dean might kill him too. Dean pulls at his manacles. As if he could.
“We’ve got it, uh…tracked down. To a trader who’s dealt with Crowley before. Thought we’d go check it out—see if we can’t get a location.”
He urges the chestnut forward and goes straight towards the creek—the birds scattering as they close in. Sam swings off his horse, running forward—but stops abruptly as the smell hits him. He covers his mouth and nose, coughing.
"There used to be four archangels," Sam continues. "They were the only ones left. Abaddon refused to bow down to humans, and for that, Alastair cast her down into Hell. The fight fractured Heaven—brother fighting against brother. Remiel was killed, Sariel had long since vanished by then."
Benny’s face swims into view, and Dean shakes his head, even though it sends a throbbing pain through his temple.
And so he’s forced to sit through a day of monotony, standing still for hours as the royal fitters hover over him, then keep his mouth shut as an insipid woman gives him a grand speech, insinuating that Dean’s ‘coarser’ accent will not endear him to the locals, and that he should strive for the ‘more perfect’ sound of Daughton. Dean nearly gets up and walks out of the hall.
Having nothing better to do, he drinks. The whiskey at this place ain’t as half as bad as some that Sam’s seen on the road, and it goes down smooth, enough that he expects he’ll sleep soundly tonight.
The man ignores her question, removing his gloves completely. He’s tall, impeccably dressed in a dark suit and black cloak.
He doesn’t know how long he lies there. He avoids the shower again, pulling on ratty clothes and falling into his bed, after ripping all the sheets off and throwing them to the floor. He doesn’t want to remember. He doesn’t want to think.
Some part of me hoped she would come to her senses and be done with it. But I was not there. I was gone.
- An invasion of insects that left farmers devastated after the grasshoppers ate crops, wool from live sheep, and even the clothes from peoples' backs.
Then Dean’s hand is there—gripping tight. The demon dies with a shriek, and Castiel falls back from the explosion of power, Dean slipping from his arms to the floor.
Despite himself, Dean’s impressed with Charlie’s choice of location and the whole setup. He’s all for free booze and good food, but he’s never really seen the point of weddings. Just big and expensive and half the people who get up to the altar are gonna find themselves hating each other anyway. It’s a con, really. Waste of time and money.
He’s pretty damn sure he’s seen that rock wall before. It looks the same as every other rock in this godforsaken place—but something inside him is sure.
Dean's knees are no longer bunched up against his chest, and the wound in his gut is visible now—bright and angry with blood.
Part of her feels a little guilty as she says it—but it’s the truth. Sometimes….family businesses just aren’t they're all cracked up to be.
“The castle has the best library in all the land,” he reassures him. “Hundreds of books—and I’ve got Sam helping me—“
Dean runs his thumb up the edge of the blade and smirks, rolling onto his heels. His eyes are dancing.
He feels Cas’s frown instead of sees it, his head angling slightly to nudge against his, his voice curious.
Shifting aimlessly, among waves of shimmering power, beams of light, endless and infinite in space and time.
First off, thank you so so so much for being so patient. The big showdown happens in this chapter, so it was extremely difficult to write, (plus holidays and family time and work and not getting a time to sit down and edit), so seriously, thank you so much!
There’s a boy standing on a dusty road. He’s got a shotgun in his hand, his mother’s broken rosary around his neck, and his lip is cut open, split and dripping.
Standing before him, a swan no longer—but a familiar young woman with red hair, hunched in on herself, drops of water dripping from her dress as if they were feathers.
He follows the line of the arm holding its own blade, up to the face of the angel now staring at him with a poisonous expression.
“Not that I’m not appreciating the whole protective older brother thing—” (Dean’s pulled the same thing on Sam’s girlfriends a few times)— “I think Eileen will be the one kicking my ass.”
The outline of his honeyed wings disappears, the light sinking back into Dean, focusing into his blinding irises before fading. He strides up to where Castiel’s sitting, reaching out a hand. Castiel’s heart leaps.
He thinks back to last night, in the woods. He had been distrustful, confused when Dean came to him, asked him to join him on his midnight ride, but ultimately, Sam’s curiosity was too strong. He had to know what compelled Dean to return to the lakeside, night after night. He had his suspicions, but the truth shocked him even more.
He reaches out, as if to put a hand on Castiel's shoulder—but then he stops, clenching his fist. He reluctantly draws his hand back.
He took one look at Hael’s body and his legs nearly gave out from under him. He barely made it three steps before he was heaving—vomiting up what little remained in his stomach.
Castiel just stares at him, struggling to breathe. The shard of porcelain drops from his fingers, clattering away into some dark corner. His throat is squeezing in on itself, choking him, threatening to send him tumbling into unconsciousness.
Dean glares at him, a dangerous glint in his eye. Castiel stands, trying to stop Gabriel before he says anything that might get him struck down by lightning, or righteous fury or whatever—
Castiel likes Zeke. He’s brave, he’s strong, and he’s a good hunter. He never fails to speak his mind, voicing his thoughts with a slow and sure conviction, and Castiel finds that his world has grown a little larger.
In the middle of the square— a tall rider who is eerily still, despite the chaos raging around him. Dean’s only seen the man once, and that was through a thicket of trees—but he has no doubt who is across from him now.
“Be ready in ten!” he sings, slamming the door shut behind him. Castiel glares at the offending door, shaking his head.
He thinks this was the happiest time of his childhood. These lazy afternoons where they would exchange quiet words, sitting contentedly in silence for hours, before the sun set, then Joshua would shoo Castiel inside to change his mud caked shoes before dinner.
The sketchbook gets tossed to the floor, but neither of them notice. Their coffee goes cold on the nightstand as the sounds of love and laughter carry out on the breeze, across the ocean and to the brilliant blue sky.
“I did always like you, Bela. Even if you did side with my brother in the fight,” she says, her words taking on a slight steely edge.
Dean finally settles on a piece of strawberry rhubarb pie, and for all his pornographic sounds earlier, it’s nothing compared to what he does now.
She watches Dean for a moment, then sighs, propping one elbow up and leaning her cheek against her hand.
“Lee Chambers,” he says. “Sheriff in town. They got the dead men there too. Said they were burying ‘em today.”
Dean grips the pen so hard in his hand he figures it might break. He has to look away before he does something stupid, like kiss him.
They had been talking about something, Castiel can’t quite remember, but Dean’s face is suddenly pulling away from him and frowning, looking around the room.
Castiel bickers with Dean for almost an hour over breakfast, insisting that he’s perfectly capable of driving home.
Dean starts to grin, a bubbling feeling that starts deep in his chest, forcing its way out as a laugh.
Dean grips his arm, helping him straighten. Emmanuel doesn’t throw Dean off this time, but his brow darkens, sweat on his skin as he struggles against his own weakness. Dean curls his hand around Emmanuel’s waist briefly, getting him upright. Emmanuel leans against him, panting.
The whole city was up in arms, crowing and ecstatic that someone connected with the notorious Emmanuel had finally been captured. Some were saying that Dean
Anna nods hastily, reluctantly releasing Castiel. He watches wordlessly as she digs in her pocket, popping open the cylinder on her revolver.
They make their way to the bar and Gabriel pushes a glass into his hands, grinning. Cas takes a sip without much thought, and nearly gags.
Dean tries to follow her steps, but something in his throat grows tight. Mary slowly brings them to a stop.
Castiel groans, kneading his forehead. He’s starting to get a headache from all this back and forth bullshit.
When he finally leaves the station, Sam presses himself up against the wall, taking huge steadying breaths. He’s feeling dizzy, lightheaded and faint.
He must propose tomorrow night. To a lady of old Daughton blood, to appease the court and unite the kingdom.
“And I don’t know how long this is gonna take, I don’t know if I’ll even be able to contact you—with that warding on your ribs, you’re hidden from me.”
“Well. It was rather boring. Especially without my favorite toy." Her hands flit over the various blades, and she selects a small switchblade, turning to him with a poisonous smile.
He doesn’t know how long they torture him, but Castiel’s grateful when his body finally succumbs to the pain and drags him under, falling into darkness.
They had never talked about it—the time his father disappeared, after she died. When he up and abandoned the church, the parish, but yes, also his
“These are men with no mercy,” he says lowly. “No morals, no god. They will cut you down simply for standing in their way.”
She huffs, elbowing him in the side. Castiel smirks and retaliates—messing up her hair until Anna shoves his hand away, scowling.
“I mean―yes, we are on our honeymoon, but that’s, uh...not what we reserved. Too expensive,” he says, smiling apologetically.
Dean stops, placing a hand over his heart. The other finds Castiel’s cheek, but Castiel does not turn into the touch. He continues to stare at Dean, a dark gleam in his eyes.
The man nods, stepping behind Dean, slipping the rope around his neck. Dean’s heart begins to pound, an uneven beat in his chest. Everything seems to slow down, the scene before him surreal. Beside him, the priest starts a rousing sermon, a crescendo of noise breaking over him.
“Beggin’ your pardon ma’am. This man here was harassing one of your girls,” he says, indicating so. The man has recovered now, breathing harshly.
He briefly toys with the idea of asking Castiel to attend the ball tonight. He had been hesitating, dancing around the task, unsure how to exactly do it. He does not believe Castiel would refuse, but still, the thought makes him nervous. And it just never seems the right time. Now, all Dean cares about is how Castiel looks in the moonlight.
Stupid, reckless, Dean, who’s always so willing to put another’s life before his own. He would run headfirst towards death if he thought it would save Castiel.
It had been a couple days, but for some reason, the damn cut won’t close. He hopes it isn’t cursed or some shit like that.
“Do we have to go over this again?” Dean throws up his hands. “I don’t want to date anyone. I’m good. I’m completely fine doing what I’m doing. Relationships are for schmucks.”
And the guy probably isn’t there anyway. Yesterday had to have been a fluke. Dean is the only one with late-night access, right?
Sam stares back at his brother, taking slow breaths. Dean would never ask something of him like this, not unless it was important. But no matter what Dean’s gone through, no matter what he’s seen—he’s never lied. Not to Sam.
He chokes, lashing out. He scratches and claws at the dirt around him, struggling and pulling. He can only think up
Dean holds his breath, listening. There’s the soft sound of voices, and the telltale cracks and pops of a fire.
Castiel feels something strange as Dean’s eyes settle on him. It’s not like the frenzied strip that had preceded most of their times together. This is something altogether more intimate. More holy.
He had almost forgotten. The dizzying days with Castiel by the lakeside had completely wiped his mind of his obligations, but now they return, full force.
“Calm down,” the angel spits. He whirls, starting to circle around Castiel. “I’ll heal her up soon enough.”
Afraid of their situation, afraid of himself—afraid of what he might do. His grip on his control feels so thin, so tight that it might snap any moment. And Castiel isn't really sure what will happen when it does.
Soundlessly he dismounts, holding up a hand to his horse, who turns away in disinterest, searching amongst the ground for a few blades of grass.
He darts a hand out, seizing her neck. Anna gasps, and chokes, grabbing at his wrists. Alastair’s eyes have turned dark, and he towers over her, his voice thundering.
It's the last straw. Dean's control on his temper snaps, and he throws down his napkin, glaring back at her.
Castiel blinks, finding himself inches away from surprised green eyes, nearly crossed as he tries to look at what collapsed on top of him.
He digs his heels into his horse’s side and she starts off, gaining speed. Dean can’t help a look back. The two of them are frozen on the back stairs, watching him ride off, Sam’s candle tiny and helpless against the black night.
“Save it,” Sam snaps. “Because I know what your promises are now. I see them for exactly what they are—just promises.”
Dean's face flashes with pain, but he doesn't seem surprised. Charlie takes Sam aside, whispering in low tones. After a moment, they fall quiet, and give the rest of them a brief nod.
“Checking on the family assets, coz! And Mother mentioned you’d be here with a few friends for a wedding, so…” He smiles. “Figured I’d join you. I love a good cake.”
He kisses his temple, lips fumbling as he murmurs nonsense, of love and desperation, telling him it’s all right.
They float for a minute, staring at each other. The city lights spiderweb across the world below, and Dean takes a deep breath. He lets go of Cas’s hand.
Someone’s covered Emmanuel with a blanket, hiding his nakedness, which Dean is glad for. He still feels skittish and unsure, hesitant of how much of this he's allowed. The man had almost died. Wouldn't be right for Dean to be oglin’ him as he was halfway to bleeding to death.
The impact spins the man around to face the woman, who deftly aims and puts a bullet through his throat.
She had just come up to him, minutes earlier, and started just babbling about who the hell knows what—and Sam had listened to her out of politeness—but then she had started rubbing her hand up and down his thigh, and Sam had realized exactly her intentions.
“Probably two weeks,” Sam says, oblivious. “But with any luck, we’ll be back at the end of it, with our very own archangel blade.”
Castiel stares at it for a minute, unblinking. His mouth is dry, his heart lurching unevenly inside him. He can’t seem to move.
He grips Castiel’s arm and helps him up, quickly dancing back out of reach. Castiel shakes his head, struggling for breath.
Castiel tightens his grip around the hilt, licking his lips. His heart is starting to pound, and they hadn’t even started yet.
"That cage was designed to keep her locked away." Sam exhales deeply, looking tired. "Breaking out probably took a lot out of her. And the garrison believes she hasn't taken a vessel."
She steps back, dropping her hand. She jerks her head, and in an instant another demon is at her side.
They’d never said, not even before Dean left. But Castiel knew he was. Only love leaves that big and jagged of a hole.
Since that first night, every time they’ve done this has been hard and fast, rushed in a dark space, or in the back of a car. Now they finally have each other, all to themselves, with the whole night ahead of them. Castiel’s going to let himself forget the world for a moment, and focus on this. There’s no apocalypse, no devil, no demons. Just this. Just them.
Castiel slides in beside him, and Dean slips an arm around his waist, tugging him in. Despite his inexperience, Dean readily closes his eyes, heaving a sigh. Castiel pulls up the sheets around them, just looking at his face. Dean looks so worn and tired.
Castiel lets out a soft moan, fingers grabbing uselessly at the sheets when Dean thrusts his hips again. Castiel hunches over, panting hard in his ear. Dean grabs the backs of his thighs and Castiel straddles his waist, groaning as Dean slows, pulling back from his lips.
Dean can’t help a sneer, turning his head to stare off into the darkening night. Emmanuel purses his lips.
“And I’m not proud of what I did. I found him, Campbell was sitting in an inn, surrounded by all his friends—he was terrified. Thought it was a dead man come back to life. He never defended himself from the bullet I put in his heart.”
Dean holds up the ring (something they dug out of the bottom of a 99 cent bin in Walmart), adding a hesitant edge to his voice.
For a moment, they stare at each other, not speaking. Then, from behind him, the approaching sound of hooves. Dean glances over his shoulder.
“Pull up a chair, love, don’t be shy. Hat, coat, it always gets so stuffy downstairs—” She waves a hand, vaguely indicating the corner of the room. “Em, darling, glasses and bottle in that cabinet. There, you remember.”
It pains him physically, just to be near it, to where the rift in the universe had been. It's a horrible, evil thing, because the world could have been torn apart, everything could have ended, all of existence destroyed without the blood to tame it—
Dean presses up against him, and despite his anger, Castiel feels a spark zip through him at the contact.
Dean thrusts hard, once, and stops. Castiel arches back, black creeping into the corners of his vision. He sees stars, only called back to reality when Dean’s fingers tighten on his wrists. Castiel jerks under the touch, cursing him, garbled whimpers and moans under his breath as he fights against his grip. He struggles to thrust his hips up, goad him back into fucking him again, to let him go, to do anything—
Shouts follow him, but they soon fade away, and the only thing he hears is the wind as it whips past his face.
He gets an idea, and decides to just go for it, before he can lose his nerve. He pitches forward and somersaults in midair, a surprised laugh escaping him.
He looks north, but the camp stretches on and on, next to the freshly laid track. Dean only stops when he spies an anvil, set up outside one of the tents, and quickly swings off his horse.
He’s a quiet kind of man, a gentle man, and he takes pride in this small plot of land. Sometimes, if Castiel asked nicely, Joshua let him help. He showed him the things
Dean never finishes his speech because he doesn't need to. In three swift steps, Castiel has reached him and pulled him in by the front of his shirt.
Raphael grips her arm, turning down the knife. Anna struggles against him, but he pushes her away like she’s nothing but air.
He brings his hands up in front of him, feeling the swirling energy start to take form. He keeps his eyes closed, concentrating, but he can imagine the scene. Gold and green threads, weaving delicately into a sparkling orb, pulsing and humming with the life around him.
He figured it out a few miles back. With no conversation to overhear and the endless miles on the hot trail, there's little else for Dean to do but think. Dean might not have had much experience with outlaws firsthand, but he knows their type. Men who are only after one thing, and would do anything to get it. Money.
The thought makes him smile, and that’s when Dean strikes. He hits Castiel hard, and they tumble, Dean wrenching away both blades and throwing him to the floor.
Dean sobs, his face twisted in agony. Anna scrambles up against the wall, chest heaving with fear and the effort to breathe.
He absentmindedly toys with the cord around his neck, staring unseeingly at the graves before him. Anna had given it back to him, pulled it off her own head when she had finally accepted that he wasn’t dead anymore.
Sam tightens his hands on the reins, keeping his breath even. Luke glances at Sam’s white-knuckled grip, unimpressed.
Ruby stares at him, chewing at her lip. But she isn’t arguing back, so Sam hopes that signals agreement.
Dean looks up sharply. There's a strange look in his eyes, something Castiel isn't quite sure what to make of. So he stands too, awkwardly changing the subject.
Castiel looks up at him, meeting his gaze. Those eyes are relentless, a storm of fire and lightning building behind them again—almost piercing through him as Castiel continues to press gentle kisses to his fingers.
Castiel catches it, fingers wrapping around the familiar engraved grip. He automatically releases the safety, his mind buzzing with questions.
“I meant to stay in shape,” she says, smiling at him through her lashes. Dean tracks the conversation, his eyes narrowed.
He finally manages to straighten up, and turns, leaning his back against the door. He casts his eyes back to the garden, the plants and buds now blooming around the crumbling stone.
Castiel doesn't answer. He sees a smudge of blood on Dean's shoulder, probably from when Castiel was freaking out on him—and feels the strangest twinge of guilt. He reaches out, wiping it away with a brush of his thumb.
“Yeah, you’re right,” he says, indicating Cas’s bedhead. “Out of the pair of us, you would be the scruffy-looking nerfherder.”
“Didn’t want to do this, but I’m starting to think it’s inevitable,” he says, glancing pointedly behind him. Castiel turns, just in time to Eileen storm off, Sam hastily following her.
Lining the room, wall to wall, are dusty shelves, crammed with the largest collection of books Dean's ever seen in his life. But not only books—Dean walks slowly, seeing maps and parchments and an odd assortment of objects piled in haphazardly among the tomes, lit by the dusty sunlight coming from the windows high above. He leans down to look at one of the titles, and is surprised to find a pair of eyes peering back at him.
Dean doesn’t move, eyes still burning with a metallic sheen. But he releases Castiel, who collapses, desperately clutching at his broken arm.
“So I try to make jokes, and make people laugh—what’s wrong with that?” He scoffs. “Everyone likes it. They like
He glares at her as she grabs the scissors and sits down beside him. Castiel really wants to be angry at her, but some part of him knows he deserves this.
When he wakes, it’s still dark. Looks like it had rained briefly while he was out, and the light of the moon shines through the rain-spattered glass, dotting the leather of the backseat with stars. Castiel smiles faintly, yawning. He shifts to his side and goes to readjust the pillow under his head, when he remembers he didn’t bring a pillow.
Dean buries his face into Castiel’s neck. He’s speaking in starts and stops, words barely edging past his lips as he hushes out the truth.
Castiel looks around wildly, for help, for anything—Sam and Charlie are fighting off angels and demons, Anna and Gabriel struggling amongst the haze and smoke to find them, and in the middle of it all—the archangels snarling at each other, locked in a stalemate.
Castiel looks up sharply, but Dean is grinning at him. Castiel realizes belatedly that he’s returning the smile, and hastily clears his throat, looking away.
Dean crosses his arms over his chest, tucking his chin down. The rain continues to hit him, getting steadily stronger. Ain’t long before his hat is soaked through and drooping, water running under and dripping down the back of his neck. His teeth are chattering, and his feet have long since gone numb. Every raindrop chills him down to his bones.
“You’re projecting from school grounds?” Castiel asks. Dangerous, risky, and not to mention highly forbidden. Something Castiel may have tried once or twice.
“Protective sigils,” Dean echoes. “To shield you.” He draws his hand back, smiling apologetically. “Angels won’t be able to hear or see you now. Should’ve done it earlier.”
They just stare for a while, but Castiel can’t stand it any longer. He grabs Dean’s collar and pulls him in, their mouths meeting for the first time in what seems like years. They're always broken apart, separated, and a few desperate kisses spread out over months and months just isn’t enough.
Dean wants to shy away, almost feels naked under the slow touches Castiel is giving him. What happened against the abandoned cabin was nothing like this, yet this feels far more intimate, Castiel twining his fingers through Dean’s hair, one strong hand gripping at his back.
“The man wanted revenge, rightfully so. Campbell, I think his name was. He found my town—and tried to put a bullet in my back.” He takes a deep breath. “Only....he found the wrong person.”
“Let’s just—let’s find someplace to stay. A motel. The church is too far, we gotta—we gotta get him someplace.”
He gets into the back and Dean sits up front, making awkward small talk. He keeps his eyes determinedly out the window, and misses the constant looks Dean darts up to the rearview mirror.
It’s hardly anything, a wound he got on a hunt a while back. He had taken off the bandages earlier that week, and it's scabbing over nicely. The most annoying part is the bruises. They throb sometimes, reminding Castiel of his stupidity, of his recklessness.
He tells her the strange story in its entirety, of his encounter with Dean and his claim of being an angel. She listens for all of it, shaking her head furiously once he’s finished.
“Anna,” he says when he sees her, his face melting with relief. “Thank goodness. When we lost sight of you, we did not know what to think, and I—“
Ketch takes a step back, perhaps surprised by the sudden difference in their heights. But he barrels on.
Anna glares at her, pulling a little at her restraints, but they’re solid. She shifts slightly to the left.
“I think it’s a grand choice,” Gabriel says, clapping Eileen on the shoulder. “The guy is well-worthy.”
Dean kneels at Emmanuel’s side, brushing the hair back from his forehead. He’s drenched in sweat, his face pale.
Time is winding down on them. It's one thing to be optimistic, to keep the faith—but it's another thing to see the reality of their lives. Castiel wants nothing more than to spend as much of his remaining time with the ones he loves.
“Hey, it’s fine,” Gabriel consoles. “There were probably some people out in Canada who didn’t know—”
“Oh, yeah, well, Cas loves to pretend like he doesn’t care.” She leans back against the wood, and Dean flops back out of sight at the last minute, tripping over his pants again. “It’s how he protects himself.”
“Well, ain’t that lucky. ‘Cause I got a Winchester rifle that can shoot you dead." She jerks her head. "Come on in.”
He checks his phone, looking at all the missed notifications and texts, including some that look like they’re from a wrong number. He opens up a message of his own to send.
He flips up just in time, but she’s already there, her arm quick and deft. Dean parries and strikes back, shoving against her.
Castiel stares down at him, his naked chest heaving. Dean slowly pushes his jeans and boxers out of the way and takes his cock in his hand, and he sucks in a breath, unable to tear his eyes away.
“Wouldn’t happen to be that tall fella at the other end of the table with the Fabio mane and an ass like the North Star?”
“You’re not a part of this, trickster.” She turns her head slowly, fixing him with hard eyes. “Get out of my way, or you’ll be dust, like your demon friend.”
Creaser pulls the engineer from the car, holding him with his hands in the air. The engineer swallows.
Anna holds up her hands in surrender, but she still doesn’t lose that grin. Castiel struggles not to roll his eyes. Despite all of Anna’s and Gabriel’s teasing, Castiel isn’t exactly the delicate flower they paint him to be. He just had never really enjoyed sex for the sake of sex, and was perfectly content waiting for the right person to come along. He now realizes he wasn’t waiting for a 'person' after all.
He throws a hand over his eyes, blessedly blocking out the bright light. His other hand fumbles, pats beside him, and hits something cool and wet. Dean chances a look again.
“If anything's going to point us in Emmanuel's direction, it’s going to be her, and the railroad. Makes sense she’d be gunning for the man who signed her father’s death warrant.” Her mouth tightens into a thin line. “I know I’d do the same.”
“I shoulda done better by you boys,” he murmurs. “That’s what John asked of me, and I couldn’t even manage it—not for a month. I—”
The bartender eyes Dean with dislike, but thrusts the glass forward again, then turns and stalks off to help another customer.
Dean places a hand on her wrist, concentrating. He quickly soothes her mind, sweeping away the bad dream. She immediately relaxes, the furrow of her brow smoothing out.
The third rider, taking dead aim for him. And Emmanuel, throwing himself without hesitation in front of the bullet.
He quickly finishes the rest of the code and enters it into the nav-console, sinking back in his seat. Charlie purses her lips.
So that one time was convenient, yes. But mostly, Anna and Castiel just carry on like they always have.
Castiel spins the knife back and forth a few times, experimentally. His hands have stayed limber, at least. The bullet has robbed him of his strength—he’ll have to do with cunning.
The woman in the suit pulls his father aside and starts muttering something about legalities, but Castiel tunes them out, trying to calm his fear.
Michael presses a hand to his throat, cutting off his voice. Castiel vainly struggles against him, but it’s no use.
We waited in vain for him to return. Waited, for years and years, while the world below changed and burned with unnecessary grief and war. The braver ones among us whispered, wondered how we could stand by and let such suffering continue. Those whispers were silenced with a look—sometimes painful warnings.
“You actually got feathers, or what?” He wags the glass in his direction. “Could use some angel feathers.”
Castiel opens his mouth, but she quickly tosses him a burger, and he has to focus more on stopping it from hitting his face instead of thinking of a witty retort.
He took extra care with bathing tonight, and made sure his face was cleanly shaven, his hair neat. It seems silly, but he wants to look his best for this moment. He has a feeling it will be one of the most important of his life.
He opens his eyes and stares down the gaping void. He fights back every instinct telling him to turn and run.
“Why do you need to find him again? It’s not like he’s done that much for us. Just gotten us into a whole lot of trouble, as far as I’m concerned.” He leans back in his chair, shrugging. “He’s just become another angel to avoid.”
There isn’t much to see against the thick tree trunks, but Dean can see the faint silvery reflection of the moon on what must be a lake.
The woman in front of him just shrugs, shaking her head, but another sharp-eyed chorus girl turns towards them, her voice cutting through the noise.
But Dean doesn’t relent, he just fucking stares him down. Castiel trembles underneath him, glaring back.
Dean jerks back to the present, gasping wildly. Emmanuel is crouched over him, a worried terror in his eyes.
Castiel swallows. He sets the kit on the table, opening it up and quickly kneeling by Sam’s side. He’s just grabbing the bottle of antiseptic from the box when there’s a slight rustle of movement behind Sam. Castiel glances up—and freezes.
He meant it to be a dramatic, romantic gesture―but Dean misjudges the distance and they go tumbling backwards, hitting the floor in a way that has Dean's back groaning in protest, Cas messily falling on top of him.
“Cas, you ain’t gonna break me,” he says gruffly, wiggling his hips slightly, pushing back against him. Castiel huffs, nudging his head as he pushes in further.
“Shouldn’t you know, Castiel?” Dean says, shuffling the cards with a snap. “I thought the devil ran hell.”
“The Marshal has been assigned by the governor to personally track down Emmanuel, citing his excellent history of service and record with violent outlaws. He is to bring the outlaw to the county seat, dead or alive.”
But Dean. He’s taken Cas’s words and mixed in some of his own, and created something entirely unique. He’s funny, and heartfelt, simultaneously joyous and incredibly sincere, and Cas finds himself falling in love with every word.
They had finally gotten Cas back to the cabin, back to his room, but in a moment of quiet he had looked down, staring at the jacket in his hands and just snapped—raging and fighting against them until Charlie forcibly put him to sleep.
Dean has broken out of his fog, and hurries down the hall, all voices stopping as every eye turns to him. “We have to move C—Emmanuel. He’s what Morgan is after.”
Dean walks past another tree, frowning. It looks the same as all the rest. His feet are starting to ache, and there’s a sharp pain in his side, making it hard for him to breathe. He does not know how long he has been walking.
“What do you say, we hop in that hot tub, make sure we’re all rinsed off, then we can move things to the bedroom?” He asks lowly.
He dives to the ground, just as a bullet splinters the support beam behind him. He scrambles behind the first thing he sees for cover—a rotting wagon—and sees the kid—Sam—standing on the porch and gaping at the scene on the street.
There’s a sharp crack and the ground beneath them splits—Castiel barely rolls Dean away in time from the gaping chasm cracking open the floor. Abaddon is stalking towards where Alastair is lying, spitting blood, echoes of grace dancing in her dark murderous eyes.
Castiel can’t make sense of anything, he’s just yelling, his head pounding, clogged with hate and fear and—
Dean presses two fingers to Anna's forehead, and she drops immediately, unconscious. Dean scoops her up into his arms—and Castiel desperately lunges forward, reaching out a hand.
Pieces fly everywhere, spraying out across the table, the sound of them setting his teeth on edge. Castiel snatches up one of the larger shards, and slices it down his wrist, blood quickly welling up in the cut. He ignores the throbbing pain that twists through his arm as he starts to trace the blood spell on the table, trying to remember the complicated runes. Castiel’s not sure if it will even work—he doesn’t have the proper set up—all he can do is pray that it does.
—like this—and Cas is glaring at him, his eyes hot and challenging. But despite the steel, there’s a softness there, a strange sort of vulnerability.
Emmanuel grabs his arm and pulls him up, the pair of them half-running, half-crouching to dive behind an abandoned wagon. Dean puts up the revolver, peering around.
Abbadon whirls and their blades clash again. With a great lurch, the ground beneath them splits, shaking the building and rafters. The fire is spreading, and it surrounds them, separating them from the rest of the war—dancing eerily around them as they fight, moving faster than the eye can follow.
Their teasing lasts them all the way down to the end of the lane, both of them laughing as they round the corner, towards the gate for Dean’s house. Once there, they quickly fall quiet.
Dean seizes his forearm and Castiel jerks against his grip, but it only pulls him closer. He can see every fleck and break in those eyes.
“Probably didn’t count on the fact I was looking for you, too,” she says, pursing her lips. She finally retracts her hand, frowning slightly.
He saddles up and gets on his horse, turning her quickly. She paws at the ground, breath visible in the cold air.
They turn, and an old cabin comes into view, sitting inconspicuously amongst the trees. Castiel stops.
He spies his shirt, where it's lying discarded on the grass, and he slowly picks it up, shaking away the last traces of dirt. He pulls it on, relishing in the rough brush of cotton over unbroken skin.
Their footsteps sound down the hallway, and Cas panics, scooping up the entire mess and throwing it in the sink. He whips out of sight behind the fridge just as the three of them enter the kitchen, still talking animatedly.
“What do we do with her?” She mutters. The angel may have saved her, but that doesn’t mean Anna has to owe her a damn thing.
Chevre whinnies and tosses her head in delight when she sees Dean—he hasn’t ridden her in nearly a week—but there’s no time for a reunion now. He swings a leg over her and digs his heels in, urging her forward.
Castiel just nods, clapping Gabriel on the back in a vain attempt to reassure him. “Where’s Sam?” Gabriel looks around. “Don’t we need him? To start the spell—“
The place where Sam had fallen is now overrun with demons, and they’re quickly fighting their way towards him. To where the altar is set up.
But Gabriel is incessant, filling up shot after shot even after they tell him they can’t possibly keep going, and when he whips out the deck of cards, it’s all over.
Dean recognizes it. It’s exactly what he felt when Sam told him about Eileen in the first place. It’s worry, and pessimism, but the deeply buried tiny hope that this time, this relationship
“Then that’s where I’ll be,” Gabriel says with an evil grin, grabbing a full handle of rum and heading out towards the balcony.
“The railroad’s tr-transferring a big payload, I dunno—but this—this ain’t supposed to be on the records.” He swallows, looking all around. “Supposed to go to some big important fella,” he says. “Some head honcho.”
“People do all sorts of crappy things in the name of love. You two are so self-sacrificing, you put every life ahead of your own.” She shakes her head. “Honestly, it’s a miracle you’re both still alive.”
There’s only the sounds of Anna in the back, humming slightly to herself as she moves things into their bedrooms. Castiel picks at his fingers.
He looks at the supplies in front of him, and suddenly feels lost. Maybe this is a fool’s errand. Maybe he doesn’t have a chance in hell of finding his brother.
Dean comes back, setting the kit beside him. He gently prises Castiel’s hands from his side, getting a closer look at the wound. They’ve managed to soak up most of the blood, but once Dean sees the extent of his injuries, he curses under his breath.
Dean’s weight is feather-light, and his body barely sinks into the bed as he moves toward Castiel. One hand comes up slowly, brushing a lock of hair from his forehead.
Dean sucks at his neck, just the barest hint of teeth reaching out to scrape at Castiel’s collarbone, breathing heavy against his skin. His smell is all tangled up in his nose, deep earth and wet moonlight hissing in his ears as Dean touches him.
They talk about nothing in particular while the humans finish up their breakfast. Sam politely refuses everything he’s offered, sending reproving but amused looks at Dean as he steals from Castiel’s plate.
The guy looks him up and down, absently plucking the strings on his guitar. He’s already hooked to the amp and everything.
Abaddon slowly comes to a halt, and the two of them are silent. It’s the strangest kind of reunion, meeting after all these years.
They both hesitate, and Castiel tightens his jaw, jerking back a chair at the kitchen table and falling into it. Then Gabriel opens his mouth.
Cas sighs, looking out at the mass of seething bodies in the club. He’s entirely too sober for this.
It’s the same argument that left Castiel feeling like his lungs were ripped out, and he knows it does the same to Dean—because Dean’s staring at him, his chest heaving with sobs, his face utterly broken, but Castiel can’t stop.
He feels like he’s dying. He’s never felt pain like this before—it’s second only to the torture Lilith put him through, but that was the essence of his grace. This stabs at his physical body, tearing and ripping him apart from the inside out.
Dean shucks his clothes, hanging his coat over the back of the rocking chair in the corner. Boots off, trousers, suspenders. He rolls up his sleeves and sits at the silver basin in the corner, splashing some water on his face—he also makes sure to put some clear petroleum oil on his hand—a burn he got from firing one of the cheap guns that came in from Blackwater.
He shoots a quick text off to Cas as he’s leaving work, telling him he’s gonna hit the garage and will be coming home late. Nothing unusual, so Cas won’t be suspicious. He used to work at Andrea’s garage back in college part-time, and once she heard he was moving back to Lawrence, she enthusiastically welcomed him with open arms.
Dean doesn’t intend to let the man intimidate him, but after a few moments he has to look away. He makes as if to stand, when the outlaw speaks.
“Horse is ready,” the blacksmith says in the same falsely cheery tone. “Why don’t you come around the front to pay?”
She doesn’t respond, that serene smile unfazed. Castiel’s instincts are screaming at him to run, but he holds his ground.
Sam is screaming at them, screaming for them to follow—and Anna yanks Castiel up, stumbling against each other as they run, careening around the corner. They barely make it, the world exploding behind them.
He turns, dropping the bag from his shoulder. Anna is glaring at him from the couch, her arms crossed. She must have been sitting there all night, to catch Castiel if he tried to do exactly what he just tried to do. He sighs.
Castiel braces himself as he kneels over Dean, gasping. He pushes himself up, his breath evening out as he comes back down to earth. Dean reaches a hand towards him, smiling sleepily.
The storm has worsened by the time night falls, rain steadily pelting against the window as Gabe’s car rolls in.
Castiel closes his eyes, trying to process. The more he sees of angels, the more he hates them. He can't imagine the one who's supposed to possess Anna would be any different. But she doesn't have to say yes. They can fight this.
It sounds like Raphael. Like Naomi. Like every dark terrible thought she’s ever had, the ones that kept her up night after night—the ones that drove her to this shit in the first place.
He quickly puts on the outfit picked out for him—a jerkin in the Daughton style that Dean would never choose to wear—and sits brooding in his room until a servant comes to fetch him for dinner.
Dean slows and twists, drawing the sounds of out him, leeching them like poison. But Castiel doesn’t want that, he doesn’t want gentle, he doesn’t want nice—
Abaddon turns slowly, fixing her eyes on the four of them. Castiel feels Sam’s hands jerk slightly, and his gasp when he realizes they haven’t moved. Abaddon raises a finger.
He drops down, pulling the bottle into bed with him, until the chaos in his head melts away and he falls into blackness.
Dean quietly steps back from her bedside, moving towards the hallway. He glances over his shoulder, turning right, but his feet won’t let him move.
Neither of them moves. They just stand, staring, frozen beside the church—and it’s been forever, or perhaps just a few seconds—agonizing, dragging seconds—
Dean swears again, turning his horse on a dime, setting off towards the man once more. But Butler keeps zigzagging, huffing and puffing, just evading Dean as he’s pulling up beside him.
Sam clears his throat, unsure how to proceed. Meg was Emmanuel’s ally, which means she surely doesn’t want to lead any lawmen towards him. Sam has to tell the truth.
He's been going to the lake, almost every night. He knows he's behind in his studies, but all the goings on at court just don’t interest him anymore. He spends his time waiting for the sun to go down so he can ride to the lake and be with Castiel again. No one knows, but Dean dares not let anyone in on the secret. If word got out that there was a curse—and a sorceror in their lands—who knows what chaos that could unleash.
Dean huffs and hugs her back, wondering if he just made a huge mistake. In terms of things Dean is good at, public speaking ranks pretty much at the bottom of the list. And being open and emotional on top of that? Recipe for disaster.
“You think I know?” Dean shoots back. “We’re in the best place, I mean, he can’t really go anywhere without us knowing, if we stick right next to him—”
Dean stares at Castiel in wonder. He had always been so focused on his own inability to say anything when Castiel was around—he never once thought Castiel might have felt the same.
Whatever home he might have found on the trail, Dean knows he’ll never be happy without his brother by his side. Despite their differences and the strange stilted relationship they’ve had in past few years, they’re family. Dean doesn’t leave family behind.
Abaddon narrows her eyes. Sam braces himself, but she does not move. Her gaze has turned curious, and she leisurely takes in Sam’s figure, finally settling on his hand, where it clenches tight around his angel blade.
He spots him, fighting off another angel. Sam ducks and plunges his blade into its chest—and it dies with a shriek and an explosion of grace. Gabriel cups his hands around his mouth, yelling.
“You know, I had me a Winchester once. Rifle.” The man sits up, blathering on. “Didn’t do me any favors though, I can tell you that—”
Cas teasingly knocks him with his knee, but pauses. He tilts his head, looking at Dean in that piercing way again.
Cas looks up from the laptop, his joking expression quickly turning into concern. Anna braces her hands against the counter, fuming.
“Whatever you think those demons can tell you, you’re wrong,” he breathes. “You won’t find anything.”
And he does. Dean looks up and meets his eyes, and Castiel swears there’s something there, something fighting to break through—
Dean quickly shakes his head, cupping Castiel's cheek. He could never stand seeing Cas cry, even if it is from happiness.
Christ. He wants one of the most notorious murderers in the West to trust him. How fucked up is that?
From the airport, it’s a hop, skip, and a jump to the hotel―and despite being socked out for most of the flight, Dean’s eyes are drooping when they finally reach the hotel’s front counter. Cas doesn’t look much better, yawning and swaying slightly.
He makes his way slowly back to Benny and Sam as the stars spill out above them, shining over the revelers as they continue on, laughing and drinking. Several men have taken up a song, swaying back and forth in time to the music, happily spilling wine as they sing. Dean sinks back down next to Benny, where a small crowd has gathered. A pretty maiden with golden hair sits in their midst, speaking animatedly.
The sheriff, Winchester, looks around them, his gaze fixing on the rubber-coated canvas above him. His eyes narrow.
"You cannot seem to stay away from these woods," he says, but there's no reprimand behind it. Dean swallows.
Castiel slings the bag from this shoulder and steps up to the counter, starting to pull everything he needs out of his bag. Dean watches the ever-growing pile of supplies, his face going pinched.
Dean is still unable to move, frozen at the end of the hall. Ellen, Bobby, Jo—everyone is clustered in the main room of the inn, all talking over each other. There’s someone Dean doesn’t recognize behind Bobby’s shoulder, a man with a thick beard, covered in dirt and sporting a bloody lip.
He snatches the drink from Sam’s hand. He doesn’t care what’s in it, he just needs to be a lot drunker than he is right now.
Ruby jerks his hand, twisting the wrist, and the man cries out in pain. Sam starts to bolt forward, then halts himself, clenching his fists. “What was it, three or four?” Ruby snaps.
“I just didn’t want anymore to die,” he says hoarsely. “I couldn’t do it, and Dean stepped in, and—“
He mists up, slightly, when Alicia and Charlie exchange vows. They both look beautiful, in their dresses, with matching flowers in their hair, and Cas can’t help the ache of joy as he watches two of his greatest friends profess their love. But he finds his eyes sliding to the man beside them, who’s holding it in just about as well as Cas himself is.
Castiel shivers. Not candle-warm, like the other souls he’s helped cross over. Dean’s hand is as cold as his own.
Hour three in a stuffy van with four cops is starting to get unbearable. And only a little bit because of Dean’s proximity to Cas. Only a little.
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs, fighting back tears. He breathes deep, steeling himself as the air around him shatters again, sending a pulsing bolt through the earth beneath his feet.
Castiel shifts, and slides his hands down the back of Dean’s thighs, starting slow. The nervousness has burned away, and he gets bolder, kissing the head of his cock, little kisses and licks before Castiel takes Dean deeper, the scent and taste of him heavy on his tongue. Dean strokes through his hair, panting hard. He’s broken, an endless litany of soft gasps and Castiel’s name falling from his lips.
He glances over his shoulder, seeing her stiff and awkward behind him—and Zeke stops abruptly, turning around.
The dirt scrapes at Castiel’s skin and he tries to push himself up, but his heavy weight shoves him back down, the breath knocked from his lungs.
“See, some of us don’t like you Winchesters,” the tall one says, advancing on him. “Some of us don’t think you’re our
Dean’s skin is glowing again, little lines and swirls of golden light washing over them as he stares.
“I know Ouray is the key. It's the center to all of this. Raphael working for Adler, and ending up dead. The coach belonging to the Pacific getting ransacked. Emmanuel's the connection."
“I don’t get it either,” he admits eventually. “But hopefully now he’ll have some answers. He said Charlie could help him.”
Dean is left frozen in the bathroom, one sock on, pants halfway down his legs, the bathroom faucet slowly dripping water.
She’s talking to someone else, but that’s no matter. Ketch comes up to the pair of them, eyes fixed on the girl.
Cas has sobered up some but apparently hasn’t regained his motor skills quite yet. He steps back, waving a vague hand over his shoulder.
The cheers and congratulations carry on like that for a while, and Castiel’s cheeks start to hurt from smiling so much. Even as everyone presses in around them, offering hugs and kisses and love, Dean doesn’t stop holding his hand. He keeps looking back at Castiel, and every time there’s that soft realization in his eyes, joy sparked with awe and wonder.
Castiel struggles to understand through the fog in his brain, black starting to overwhelm him. There’s blood dripping down his temple.
The room around them gives a jolting heave, and the man stumbles. Dean looks around wildly, the walls starting to shake violently around them.
Anna stops, clenching her hand around the cool metal of the blade, struggling to make sense of anything.
It smashes with a sickening sound, echoing loudly in the emptiness. Castiel falls back against the bed, chest heaving. He watches the alcohol trickling down the wall, pooling around the shards of glass. But instead of feeling satisfaction, he only feels horror.
Dean’s standing at the foot of his bed, his face horrified. Castiel follows the direction of his eyes, but immediately wishes he hadn’t.
He bolts up, hand going for the gun underneath his pillow. It’s still dark outside—and in the other bed he sees Sam up too, rubbing at his bleary eyes.
Dean holds his head in his hands, shaking. He sucks in deep breaths, choking on his words. Castiel takes a slow step forward.
“Hi,” Dean says back. He looks around briefly, then holds out one of the pints. “Looks like this is for you.”
As he pushes his way through the crowd, a girl appears, and quickly attaches herself to his side. She's fairly far gone, breath reeking of whiskey and sour beer, but Sam endures her prowling hands, trying to ask her questions.
“As if he hasn’t anticipated that,” a third adds. “I say we follow the original path. Back to Teller Country.”
Castiel swallows, the pit in his stomach seemingly getting deeper and more painful with every passing second.
She stood at the door and waved them off, all the way until they were out of sight of her inn, on the path towards the mountains.
There are only a handful of souls left in the world that I can trust. And I still can’t guarantee their safety. Not even my own.
Sam doesn’t hesitate, he bolts up—and the shotgun drops to the ground as Sam locks his arms around Bobby. He might be older and quite a bit taller now, but Sam suddenly feels twelve years old again, traveling the backwoods of Kansas to Colorado’s border, laughing and joking with Dean and Bobby beside him to displace the sorrow of losing home.
Sam throws his arms around her neck and sloppily kisses her cheek while she squawks and pretends to hate it. Dean suffers through the motion sickness and congratulates them, his heart swelling.
“No worse for the wear, right?” Dean says, smiling thinly. Emmanuel tries to smile back, but it’s forced too.
“Don’t think this means I’m gonna go easy on you,” he quips, as Castiel starts shrugging off his own jacket.
The alarm abruptly cuts out. The wind stills, every last sound dying away—even the crickets outside have stopped chirping. It’s eerily silent.
, he thinks quietly. For reminding him. He can’t have them knowing where he’s going. He has to do this alone.
This was his one flaw, his one weak spot that Castiel knew he could exploit. Shout at Dean, and he would shout back.
