Marv clears his throat, “Elysia Johnson, otherwise known as Shaylene, twenty-four years old, student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, majoring in business. Well, she’s certainly well-prepared for that, isn’t she?”
Cas pulls Dean’s hands to his chest. He cups his fingers gently, solidly giving Dean something to hold onto, trying to center himself around the pain.
“I’d like for you to list five things you can hear, four things you see, three things you can touch, then two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. You don’t have to tell me, just take a moment and do it in your head.”
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to say,” Dean says. There’s a hallow space between his ribs, carved out by the trowel of Bevell’s pointed words, and Dean doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do, now. He doesn’t know how they can come back from this. How Dean can come back from this.
“I have, um,” Dean falters when Cas turns to look at him, one finger in his mouth as he licks a stray drip of jelly. But he figures he owes Cas some kind of explanation. “I’ve got, ah, PTSD. For, um, some stuff that happened a while ago. It’s not usually…it’s not usually like this.”
Then time moves weird again and they’re driving, Sam’s eyes fixed on the road and hands white-knuckling the steering wheel. And Cas is – Cas is in the backseat, braced forward with his hands on his knees.
“I got you,” he repeats, rocking slightly. He hopes the movement will lull Micah back to sleep. Bedtime has been dealt with so far by either letting Micah fall asleep with one of them on the couch before transferring him to bed or sitting beside him in the semi-dark of the bedroom, lit by a Superman nightlight, until he heads off to Lalaland. Getting him back to sleep after an episode like this one is always difficult.
“You wanna stop me?” Dean turns on his heel, spreads his arms at his sides. And he is shaking, but he thinks he could land a couple punches if he tried. He’s been doing it for long enough. “Fucking stop me.”
“Dean Campbell?” says a man’s voice. Another figure drops in front of Dean’s eyes, a man with a blond beard and a white coat. “I’m Dr. Jorgensen. Can you tell me why you’re here?”
Many thanks to the reader who suggested that Dean and Emma feed ducks together. I was planning a daddy-daughter park date, anyway, so it was wonderful to add in some friendly water fowl, as well.
Dean is entranced by her face. Her cheeks are flushed. Her hair is a little mussed. Her lips are red and swollen. And there are tears in her eyes.
Visitation is the first time he’s left the house. Pam called for a brief check-in on Friday, but talking too much makes Dean’s lungs hurt, so it was only a few minutes. She talked him through strategies for quitting smoking. It’s not like Dean’s had the lung function this week to pull out a cigarette, but the urge is still there, which he’s been channeling into cutting, despite what he implied to Kaia about it
“What does that, ah, mean?” Dean asks. He’s not stupid. He’s not. And maybe Sam would have answered with a roll of his eyes or patronized Dean like teachers did when they’d answer a question with another question:
Dean knows a thing or two about getting over family shit. It’s never that simple. But he’s not going to contradict him.
Cas was right: the headphones are noise cancelling. The low frequency rumble and chatter of the other passengers immediately cuts out. Cas fiddles with the mp3 player before a generic folksy, indie tune comes through the headphones, but Dean doesn’t even care. He’d take Taylor Swift if it meant escaping this death trap, right now.
Cas laughs, clear and unexpected. He grabs hold of Dean’s hand without thinking. “It is true,” he says, and runs his thumb over the back of Dean’s knuckles on instinct. “You are quite charming.”
“Jesus, Winchester,” Meg rolls her eyes. “I thought last night was your first date. You’re fighting already?”
The thick, droopy feeling in his limbs from the weed, mixed with nauseating vertigo, and a cloying sense of nerves in his gut make for one of the most confusing erections Dean’s ever had in his life. But it’s definitely there, and the pressure of his jeans across his pelvis as he sits on the edge of his bed only make it that much harder to ignore.
, Dean sends, and he hopes the thread will be relatively inactive. He fucking hates group texts. He doesn’t have the message rates to spare.
“I’m not the one who’s a coward, here,” Cas says, voice a growl. Dean feels the knife slip cleanly below his ribcage.
“Did, ah,” Lydia asks him at the door, when he’s already got one foot on the front porch. Emma’s back in the living room, chattering happily and loudly in her playpen. “Did you get a call from your lawyer?”
Cas looks honestly alarmed, and Dean stifles the brief flare of jealousy that comes when he realizes Cas is probably thinking about Michael and Luca, and not Dean, himself. “Does that happen often?” Cas says.
“What happened?” Cas says. He approaches Dean’s bed. Dean can feel his presence looming above him, but he doesn’t chance looking, because he doesn’t want to see Cas again with a bloody knife in his hand or rotting flesh peeling away from his skull. “Sam said you were awake. But he looked upset.”
“Okay.” Billie nods sagely. “Do you think it was the stress, or was there something specific that occurred that upset you?”
Ella thinks seriously for a minute. She’s got her chin propped on the safety rail. Her nails are still painted bright yellow. Jody, Donna, and the girls celebrated the kids’ arrival with ginormous gift baskets: enough candy to keep them both jumping off the walls for a year, nerf guns from Claire, coloring books from Kaia, a
“You know how to hold a baby?” She asks a little snidely when he doesn’t immediately move to take her.
Cas isn’t dead. Sammy isn’t dead. Dean isn’t dead. This is real, he thinks, digging his nails into his arm through the sleeve of his sweatshirt. This is real.
There’s a little prickle of discomfort in the base of Dean’s skull. He doesn’t know if Cas ever told Meg that Dean’s been to prison. “Not all inmates are bad guys, you know,” he says awkwardly.
The engine starts. Cas’s foot finds the gas, and then they’re flying away from the curb. Dean lets out a shaky breath, and he crawls his fingers over Cas’s thigh. Cas squirms under Dean’s touch. The passing streetlights reveal Cas’s face as he bites his lip against making a sound.
Dean can feel Cas expand beneath him. His cock tents his boxers and digs into Dean’s neck from where Dean is leaning over him. Dean loosens his grip on Cas’s shirt. Instead, he slips his finger under Cas’s waistband. Cas squirms. His thighs shift under Dean, and his dick bumps Dean’s chin.
Spoiler: Dean attempts to cope with these confused feelings and memories by provoking Cas sexually. His actions are unexpected and unwanted – quite honestly pretty creepy. It's clearly trauma-motivated, doesn’t go beyond kissing, and he does stop when Cas tells him to - but none of these extenuating circumstances make what Dean does okay.
Cas stops suddenly, pulling away so he can meet Dean’s eyes, and his gaze is solemn and sincere. Dean kinda wants to duck away – maybe just dive back for Cas’s lips so they can keep kissing.
Dean doesn’t reply. He’s too busy feeling sick and tired and disgusted with himself. Benny drives them in silence.
. And, sure, he prays sometimes. When everything feels like it’s just too much. But he’s never been really certain that there’s someone up there listening.
Sam doesn’t exactly look convinced, but he doesn’t say anything else when Eileen puts a hand on his arm and gives him a pointed look. She’s been good for him; Sam’s always had a level head about everything except Dean, but Eileen makes him steadier.
Something hot and poisonous pulses in Dean’s belly, a mixture of anger and fear that he can’t quite parse out. And he knows he’s being threatened again. Warned to behave or they won’t let him go. Won’t let him go, and day after fucking day, he’ll make tally marks on the walls.
“Dean,” Cas says steadily, and his pale face comes into focus in front of Dean’s. He’s crouched in front of him. Dean’s in a hard chair in a too-bright room and there are too many noises around him: ringing telephones, rattling gurneys, low moans of pain, beeping monitors.
“You must be very capable, if you’ve been working at it your whole life,” Cas says generously, and Dean’s face goes warm. Cas’s voice is perfectly calm; he sounds comfortable. But Dean can’t help but notice that he’s fidgety; it reminds Dean a little of himself to see Cas drum his fingers on the steering wheel, run his tongue over his chapped lips, bounce his left knee as his right works the pedals. Dean wonders if Cas is anxious about his show, or if it’s being in close quarters with Dean that’s making him nervous.
Sam leaves without another word. As soon as the door shuts behind him, Dean deflates, letting the tension bleed out of his muscles. He doesn’t dare collapse back onto his bed, because he might not get up again, so, instead, he leans against the counter and shuts his eye. At this rate, Dean will also likely be late for work, but he needs to take a minute to calm down.
There’s a jarring sense of weightlessness, and then the slide of fabric and metal, and Dean’s suddenly in a tiny room with bright lights and wires and machinery around him, and Dean doesn’t know where he is. He doesn’t want to be here. He wants to go home.
“But then I met Amelia,” Sam continues, like he didn’t even hear Dean. “And it made things…smaller. Easier to understand. I had, you know,
Missouri is back sometime in the next hour. She comes bearing more Jello for breakfast. Apparently, Dean’s banned from anything more substantial until he can keep from puking up his intestines. But she is able to twitch out the mask for the nasal cannula, again, which makes Dean get a little choked up with relief.
Charlie turns her head and stares at him steadily. “You said you didn’t know me. Well, I want you to know me.”
“Dean,” Sam tries to keep his voice level. Cas is sitting next to Sam, silent and troubled. “It’s only two more nights, man. You can get through two more nights.”
And he can’t. Not if it means he’ll lose Cas again, Dean can’t. If Dean loves someone, they leave. Or Dean leaves. Dean doesn’t know how to stop that cycle. He doesn’t even know where to start.
Dean shrugs, but he feels like he owes her some honesty, so he says, “I, um, had a really bad one a little over a week ago. It knocked me on my ass.”
“Okay,” Billie says seriously. He hates that knowing look in her eye. He wants to scream at her. He wants to yell in her face that it
“What’s up?” Sam’s there to meet Dean at the door, concern lining his eyes and clear surprise written on his face when he realizes Dean hasn’t brought Emma with him. “Where’s Emma?”
“Don’t –” Dean gasps. He’s never lifted a hand against Sammy before. And maybe this is what Dad felt like – anger blinding and fluid inside his body, like molten lead – before he started wailing on Dean.
Dean grabs his crutches and hauls himself to his feet. There’s a shivery, unsteady feeling in all his limbs, but he’s okay. He’s not going to fall apart. There’s nothing quite like a kid to force you out of your head.
Bobby scowls, but his cheeks are a little red. “How’d you manage to make something so cute, huh, boy?” he grumbles.
Sam sprints as fast as his pounding head and uneasy stomach can handle. He knows it doesn’t make sense – because Dean didn’t run toward the garage when he left Sam in that alley; he ran away from it – but Sam tells himself that that’s where Dean has to be, now. That maybe Dean left Sam in that alley to go to Bobby for cash. That everything’s going to be okay. Sam’ll find Dean, and then they’ll get the hell out.
“You’re…really strong,” Dean says, head lolling toward Cas’s shoulder. His nose ends up mashed against Cas’s trenchcoated arm. The material is damp; it’s probably snowing again. Dean fucking hates the snow. He fucking hates winter. He fucking hates the Goddamn Midwest –
“I want it to go the fuck away,” Dean grumbles. He briefly considers the idea of kicking off his shoes and curling into the fetal position on Pam’s couch. Damn, he’s tired. His eyes itch from lack of sleep.
Dean doesn’t say anything, unable to speak around the renewed anxiety in his chest: the knowledge that Cas is responsible for so much, now, that Dean is no longer able to help in ways he’s accustomed to helping, the crushing fear that maybe this won’t work out, that maybe they’re not ready, maybe they won’t every be ready, not with Dean still floundering for solid ground in the midst of his injury and all his mental shit, not with Cas still fitting the pieces into the puzzle of his human life. The waves of anxiety are slowly battered backward until it’s just a buzz of uneasiness in the back of Dean’s head, combatted by rolling, heavy medicated disconnect, and, finally, he dozes.
From down the hall, Sam can make out the sounds of Eileen and Jack in the kitchen. Sam had made sure they stayed out of the way when Cas and he first brought in Dean. Sam knew how badly Dean would hate spectators.
“Hey Dean, you just pay attention to your boyfriend, okay?” Risa tells him kindly. She’s fiddling with his arm, sliding an IV catheter into the vein. “You just look right at him.”
Sam rounds his fingers into fists, and he knows Victor and Benny are thinking about Dean, too, because both of their faces go slack with anger.
After he knocked up Lydia, Dean went and got a full course of STD tests at a clinic. As it is, Dean’s actually been pretty lucky. He’s only had the clap twice in his early twenties. And he knows, because his tests came back clean, that he didn’t pick up something nasty from Alastair. But there was still Nick. Dean hasn’t – he’ll probably need to go to a clinic to get checked out. He feels a little ill at the thought.
It lands like the jab it was meant to be. Dean schools his features. He’s definitely not going to call the mother of the mother of his child a conceited bitch, no matter how much he wants to. Instead, he smiles with difficulty and tells her he’s looking forward to lunch. They both know he’s lying, but Charlene is as adept at playing a part as Dean is, so she gives him a closed-lip smile and a cheerful wave before driving away.
“I-I don’t know,” Dean says helplessly. He’s just scared. So fucking terrified he can’t even think straight.
Emma fights to get out of his arms again, so Dean lets her go and then curls on his side around her, penning her in, in case she wants to try walking off the bed. It’s only a foot off the ground, but he’s not risking any unnecessary drops.
Dean’s so surprised, he blurts out, “You go to church?” without thinking about how rude it will sound.
Goddamn, it’d be nice to just ride out this wave. He wants to head upstairs to buy a baggie of Ash’s smoothest Indica. Just spend the day totally blissed out, and he knows he can’t do that if he takes his meds, ‘cause that totally sucked the last time.
He might not be sure how he feels about Jack, yet. But moments like these, when the kid is awkward and sweet and so fucking endearing – it’s almost easy to forget that this is the same kid that killed Mom. That almost killed Sam.
The guy released Dean’s arms with one hand, kept a fist clamped tight around Dean’s wrists, reached around and under Dean’s stomach to fumble with the button of Dean’s jeans, tugged down the zipper. He wasn’t supposed to take his clothes off, that was a rule. Blowjobs only. Clothes stay on. No kissing. Those were his terms.
“Even though I’ve known him for less time, you sure as hell don’t know what’s best for him. I’ll fucking presume that.”
Benny scuffs his toe into the floor, and at least he has the grace to look repentant. “Playground,” he mutters.
“Stop,” Dean says, distressed enough that the word jumps out of his lips. “Stop – it w-wasn’t you – I-I didn’t mean it, and –” he’s crying. He’s really crying. Shit. No. Fuck this. He doesn’t want her to see him cry.
me do anything!” Sam wrenches his arm free and Dean totters backward, a look of shocked hurt crossing his face so quickly Sam wonders if he imagined it. But Sam doesn’t care. Sam doesn’t care if Dean thinks Sam as good as hit him. Sam isn’t letting Dean boss him around anymore. Because Dean is – Dean is waiting for some fucking
Sam’s head spins. Pain thuds from the back to the front of his head and then does it again in a repeating wave. He blinks furiously to get rid of the smudges across his vision.
There’s something wet and warm trickling down his back, seeping into his shirt and the top of his jeans. His body tingles with a thousand pricks of a needle. The electric buzz turns into heat, which solidifies into a fierce, fire-poker sharp burn in his back where he was –
“Sleep is an integral part of human health,” Cas reminds them gravely, but the frown on his face doesn’t quite look genuine.
Dean slaps his hands against the steering wheel and climbs out of the impala before he has any more time to think. He’s not watching where he’s going, so he nearly plows over a dumpy guy who’s smoking by the wall and chooses that moment to head for the door, same as Dean.
“What happened to the rat?” Dean calls – he thinks the new dog is a golden retriever. It’s currently licking Jo’s laughing face, who immediately descended on the mutt in rapture, bypassing Eileen entirely.
It’s like someone slit open Dean’s chest, yanked out his lungs, and then crushed them under a Humvee. Dean’s fairly certain he just stops breathing. If not for the counter propping him up, he’d be on the floor.
“Shit,” he hisses, waiting for the momentary vertigo to pass. He blinks several times, then beelines for the kitchen.
mug, filled with water from the tap. Dean cradles it in both hands, not trusting himself to keep it steady with just one. He takes a careful sip, and the cool liquid immediately soothes his throat.
He struggles to remove the child protection cap on the bottle of pills. His fingers are clumsy and numb. There’s a weird tingling spreading down his arms. All over his body. He manages to get the cap off. Tosses back a couple more pills with another swallow of whiskey.
Dean moves so he can take Jack’s shoulders and make the kid look him in the eye. He stares at him unflinchingly. “All that – that stuff that went down with Mary? With Chuck? That wasn’t your fault.” He says it now because, if there’s one thing he’s learned in his life, it’s that there might not be a tomorrow to say it then. “
“You,” Campbell says suddenly, pointing to Sam through the crowd like he’d somehow sensed the waves of hatred Sam’d been sending his way. “Kid, come here.”
It’s subdued at the bunker. Sam is restless. Jack is moody. And Eileen isn’t there because she had a second interview at the college, something that makes Sam says, “Shit, dammit, I totally forgot!” as soon as Jack gives them the message.
Sam takes a step back, still frowning at Dean, and Dean wishes his little brother would just leave him the hell
Then Cas perches himself on the edge of Dean’s bed and pulls out his phone. He finds the internet browser and taps into the search bar: “catatonia.”
“I’m not –” there are two high points of color on Sam’s cheeks now, and Dean can tell his brother is starting to get mad, too. They both inherited Dad’s quick temper. “Jesus, Dean – I just don’t understand why you didn’t tell me –”
Cas hears a clatter of metal against the floor. Dean’s face is very close to Cas’s. There are tears stuck to Dean’s eyelashes. His pupils are blown wide with terror, and Cas’s chest aches, because he isn’t sure if Dean’s scared of Cas or of something Cas can’t see. Dean starts shaking his head, and doesn’t stop. “Not real,” he chokes, and tries to tug away from Cas, but Cas doesn’t let go. “It’s not real. Not real. Please stop.”
Dean didn’t even falter when he made his demands to Chuck. Laid down his and Sammy’s life for the lives of everyone else on this fucking planet as long as –
Cas smiles again, a swift upturning of the corner of his lips. “It is cool. It can also be overwhelming, but I’ve learned to adjust to it. I’m inspired by the colors I see while I work.”
“No,” Dean says, and the sick feeling of shame is back when he remembers his night with Nick, along with it anger – split two ways between frustration at himself for falling off his self-imposed celibacy wagon and exasperation that he feels bad at all, because he’s thirty-three years old and he should be trusted to have a one-night-stand.
“The first step is filing your motion, which is a great deal of paperwork on your end,” Mick explains. “We’ll serve Ms. Lydia Penn with a summons – I’ll reach out to her lawyer, Ms. Bevell. You’ll have to complete a litigant awareness and a parent education program. If Ms. Penn opposes your motion, we’ll request a meeting. Usually, a judge will request you both meet with a mediator before scheduling a hearing.”
“So,” Mick continues, letting the Sam conversation drop. “It’s been over six months since entry of judgement, so we’re in the clear to file a motion.”
Speaking of space – this chapter is coming in early because I won’t be able to get to my computer for the next three weekends. I’m very sorry about the brief hiatus, but rest assured that the next several chapters are already written, so the story will continue once I get back in June. As always, thank you so much for your dedication to this story. My readers are the best readers!
“I’m really happy for you, kid,” Dean says, not telling her how happy he is that she’s only gonna be across town. He doesn’t need to verbalize how much of a needy shmuck he is.
, Dean wants to say, but he bites the inside of his lip instead. Tries to count to ten so he doesn’t explode. He can’t afford to go off the rails here. Not when it’s so important he convince everyone else that he’s okay again.
Cas swallows. He lets Dean’s word sink deep into his skin; they make him feel a little ill, but he cannot stop them now.
“Just gonna keep my eyes closed,” Dean mutters, keeping with the narrative of a migraine. Mercifully, Sam seems to buy it, and he keeps his trap shut the whole way back to the apartment. It turns out to be kinda true, actually, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, because now that Dean has space to think, his head does really hurt. Probably a result of skipping sleep the night before.
but won’t because Cas is right there. She knows they went out the night before. She’s a smart girl: she’ll figure out something went wrong.
Miracle yips in Dean’s face, and his wet tongue drags against Dean’s cheek. Dean phases back in enough to notice Mir’s front paws are on Dean’s lap, putting his nose directly in front of Dean’s face as he tries to drag Dean back from the near panic attack.
“So fucking what, she wants to go to Europe, right?” Charlie replies. “I’m not stopping her! But don’t tell me I
“Wow,” Dean says, momentarily sidetracked by the starkly beautiful landscape Cas has brushed into the canvas. It’s full of towering, wispy trees, ethereal and majestic.
The tremor in Dean’s hands has moved up his arms, into his chest, through his entire body so it feels a little like electrocution. Fire pumping through his veins. Juddering on the cold, wet cement, waiting to die.
“I’m Risa, by the way,” she says, sending him a wink. “Ready to transport?” she asks her team. It happens in quick, well-rehearsed movements: Dean’s rolled onto a backboard and transferred to the stretcher, buckled in across his chest, thighs, and ankles.
Cas gently lifts Dean from the ground. Dean’s knees threaten to give way, but Cas clutches him unforgivingly and leads him to the bed. The backs of Dean’s legs hit the mattress, and he collapses automatically.
He drapes the blanket around Dean’s shoulders, remembering how Dean had insisted on doing so while Cas struggled against Rowena’s mad dog curse, despite the fact that Cas literally felt like his brain was boiling inside his skull.
“Sure you do,” Charlie says. She reaches out to pinch his bicep. “Mmh, see? Lots of muscly muscles.”
Cas fumbles for the light switch on the wall and the fluorescent bulbs in the ceiling flicker to life.
Then Michael kneels in the high, dry grass, bows his head and shuts his eyes. “Amara,” he prays. “I need your help.”
“Dude,” Dean insists. His voice is kind of wispy, like it got tired climbing out of his throat. “It’s not the pot. I had less than half a gram.”
“I left,” Sam whispers. Tears spill down his cheeks. He doesn’t even try to stop them. His eyes are latched to Dean’s face, begging him to take it away, to make it better. Things used to be so easy. Dean used to have all the answers. “I-I can’t, Dean,” Sam fumbles for an explanation. Dean doesn’t really need him to; he somehow knows what his brother’s going to say. “I can’t – with her, I can’t.”
Dean remembers watching his house burn. Holding Sammy tight against his chest. Nearly deafened by the baby’s wails, but refusing to let go, even after his small arms started to ache, because Daddy said to take Sammy and run. And Dean wasn’t ever gonna let anything hurt his little brother.
“Yeah, I know, I know,” Dean says, coming around to the back to release her. He slings Emma’s backpack over one shoulder then unbuckles her. “You’re just impossible to please, aren’t you?”
“Don’t apologize, love,” Cas tells him gently. He holds him until the panic subsides, even if his leg still feels like it’s on fire.
The plastic bags rustle as Dean inspects his spoils, and he draws out a sack of green stuff and demands, “the fuck is this shit?”
Someone knocks, hard and frantic against Cas’s door. Dean startles and tries to leap off the bed, but his legs get tangled in the mussed quilt, and he stifles a curse. They’d both been too engaged with each other to hear anyone come into the apartment.
“You think you’re weak for not resisting?” Billie says shrewdly, evidently making the jump in the conversation from Dean’s teacher to Alastair with ease.
“You’re right,” Billie raises both hands to shoulder height, sits back in her chair like she’s trying to look as nonthreatening as possible, and Dean feels bad about snapping at her. He doesn’t – he doesn’t know why he got so angry. “I won’t second guess you.”
Dean turns and makes his way back to the car. He passes Eileen on the way. He expects nothing more than an awkward head nod after the way they departed last time, but, to his surprise, she stops to pull him into a hug. She even pecks him on the cheek.
“Hello, Eileen,” Cas says. And then he fluidly signs, like he’s been doing it all his life: “My name is Castiel.”
But Dean tries to stifle the thought because he doesn’t care when he thinks about the should-have-beens regarding his own death, but he hates it when his brain inevitably turns toward Sam’s death: the horrible, ugly truth that, had one or both of them died, then so much of this crap could have been avoided.
He hears a snort behind him, and he turns to find Lydia staring at the two of them with an amused grin on her face. Dean didn’t hear her come back in. Donna’s already getting her coat on; Dean was so occupied with Emma that he didn’t notice.
Dean circles through goodbyes with the rest of his family before securing Emma in her car seat and climbing behind the wheel. She starts crying loudly again almost as soon as Dean pulls out of Bobby’s driveway, obviously upset that she’s no longer being cuddled by Dean.
“Yes,” Cas answers. “He is two years older than I. But he left a year ago. He wanted to go West like the cowboys. Like John Wayne.”
For a second Dean thinks Sam’s going to lash out at him in turn. They’ll have a repeat of Dean’s last night at Sam’s apartment and not talk to each other for another three weeks.
,” Gabe says. “Go regurgitate a dictionary somewhere else. Dean, I told you to get him out of here, didn’t I?”
“Ah…we were friends for a long time before…” Cas flounders. He looks at Sam. “We have lived together for nearly three years now.”
“Thanks,” she says. The cold slaps more color into her face, but Dean can see that, beneath her makeup and the flush of the day, she’s pretty pale; the moonlight makes her arms glow. “You’re Cas’s, ah…?”
That warm, twisty feeling is back in Dean’s core. He quickly turns his attention back to Emma – joining Charlie on the floor – before he’s tempted to do something stupid. Like hug the guy. For a really long time.
Cas shrugs, “Occasionally. I try not to weigh myself down with only one milieu. Except the color, obviously.”
“He told me to get out, Dean,” Sam says softly, eyes going all droopy and earnest. And he’s the only one – the Goddamn only one – who can pull that kind of shit on Dean and not expect to get his ears boxed. “I was stupid and didn’t listen.”
. It was a guy because Dean needed it to be a guy. He needed to be fucked and fucked hard by an anonymous man. In the moment the desire had been unquenchable, so he did the only thing that made sense. He doesn’t understand why it didn’t make anything feel better. In fact, he feels a lot worse. Not least of all because he spent the entirety of the next day wincing every time he moved, making him remember walking around prison after getting stuck my Alastair, feeling like everyone could see him limp.
Dean retches helplessly for several minutes, eyes still shut, sweat standing out on his forehead. Cas climbs onto the bed with him so he can hold him on his side. Dean tries to roll back, but Cas stops him.
There are tiny flashes of light framing Cas’s face, and Dean realizes for the first time that Cas’s ears are pierced – he’s never had earrings in around Dean before, but he’s wearing small diamond studs tonight. Charlie’s right again: earrings are sexy as fuck on a dude. Dean angrily stifles the desire to see what they feel like against his tongue.
“It don’t work like that,” Dean says thickly. He sucks in a hard, tremulous breath. “No matter how hard you try, Cas. You can’t stop no one from getting hurt. ‘Specially if you love ‘em.”
“After discovery, we meet for a pre-trial hearing. The majority of child custody cases don’t make it to trial. So, we take the hearing very seriously. Both sides will be prepared to argue their cases, and hopefully the judge will be able to reach settlement there. Of course, if that doesn’t happen, we’ll move to trial, which is more involved. But, for now, you need to focus on proving yourself a fit father.”
Dean ignores them. He shuts his eyes and lets his head fall against the pillows. Sam can see each of his freckles standing out starkly against Dean’s pale cheeks. He shifts, as if he’s uncomfortable or in pain. His eyebrows furrow and a small sound looses from his lips, not quite a whimper. “It’s just…can’t and…so fucking loud. It’s all so loud. And I can hear them.”
“It’s not my fault he’s fucking psycho!” Christian says angrily. “If he’s gonna freak out about a little joke –”
“Okay, okay, man,” Dean says. And he supposes four miles in the pouring rain is better than fourteen. “Let’s get you warmed up.”
“Bullshit,” Dean hisses, because he knows a threat when he hears one, and people who are trying to help don’t use threats. “Don’t fucking touch me.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Jesses interrupts him with a grin. “Turn right at the top of the stairs. You’ll see ‘em.” He peers at Dean carefully for a moment. “You’ve been here before, yeah?”
It hits him, all at once: the shock, the pain, the fear, waiting for Sammy to get back in time to say goodbye, having to leave Cas, again, just when he thought maybe there was a chance – it is such a waste. Such a Goddamn waste, and Dean keeps missing his chance.
So, Cas leaves his arm around Dean’s waist, and waits as the tension slowly bleeds out of Dean’s body. He relaxes his grip on Cas’s wrist and lets his arm drop. He leaves his eyes closed. He’s breathing better now, and Cas looks at his perfect cupid’s bow, the angle of his cheekbones, the way his hair sweeps across his forehead. He can’t see his freckles in the dark, but he knows what they look like. He can imagine how they dust his nose and cheeks. He looks a little healthier than he had weeks ago – not quite so gaunt. His face is less angular, and his ribs don’t protrude quite so drastically under Cas’s hand. Cas knows the medication is helping him gain weight, and he’s eating better again.
“Cas is autistic,” Dean snaps. “He’s not a kid. And he’s the smartest damn person I’ve ever met. And you know what? He’s artistic – a genius, actually – and sweet and gentle and fucking kind, too. And you don’t know any of that because your head’s so far up your own ass it’s hitting your throat. Wherever Cas learned to be a good person, it sure wasn’t from you, lady.”
Sam eases Dean’s phone from his loose grip and hangs up the call. He clicks off the screen and sets the phone somewhere behind him.
“Samuel doesn’t even fucking want us there,” Dean says. “It’s not like we’re family to him like Gwen or Mark or fucking Christian –”
“Ah, breakfast,” Dean says. “With my brother. Sorry, I’d have gotten you something –” Why did he say that? Why did he
, he thinks, and he pokes his watery eggs around on his paper plate with his plastic spoon. He can barely eat, and he wonders how long they’ll let him starve before they flag him for an eating disorder.
Please don't hesitate to point something out to me that is potentially hurtful. That goes for all topics explored in this fic: Cas’s autism, Dean’s mental illness, queer experience, or trauma. Anything. I don’t want a reader to feel alienated or diminished because of my ignorance or perpetuation of harmful stereotypes.
“I don’t want to be here, anymore. C-Cas, I don’t –” Dean takes his hand away from his face and runs it, shaking, through his hair again. He winds his fingers into his hair and tugs.
“And bad for the soul,” Dean shakes his head. Eileen beams at him. “You wanna ride shotgun?” Dean asks Eileen.
“Oh, Lord, Dean, I didn’t mean to scare you!” Bess says, a brittle, breathless laugh in her throat. She dropped the coffee pot she was carrying, and glass and dark liquid is splattered across the floor. She’s got her wrist in her hand, rubbing the place Dean smacked it.
He grabs hold of Sam’s arm and hauls him back into a sitting position. Sam’s chin drops toward his chest and he mumbles something that sounds like, “gerroff,” but Dean persists.
The bomb Billie set off in Jack’s body sent shock waves through the Empty, waking up everything that slumbered there: demons and angels, both. Millenia of bad blood spilled over into outright war. The Shadow, after absorbing Jack’s blast, was powerless to put its charges back to sleep, so when Jack appeared with a solution, it was willing – neigh, desperate – to make a deal, even if it meant releasing one of its most prized possessions.
“Well, you should.” Dean turns around. It’s hard to look at Cas without wanting to burst into tears or start yelling. He’s breathing kind of hard. “You – shouldn’t – I’m not good at getting close to people, okay?”
“I’ll do my best to give you what you need, Dean,” Cas says. He holds Dean tightly. He doesn’t ask any more questions for a while, and Dean waits until his heart stops trying to burst out of his chest. He does his best to remind himself that Cas is there. That Cas might actually want to be there. That Cas might actually want to stay, and Dean doesn’t need to worry that he’s going to leave – not right now, at least.
Yep, there’s Meg. And she’s naked, balanced crisscross-applesauce on top of her stool, arms cradling a blue swaddled infant. Her body is splashed with colors: deep reds drip down her chest, blue shading on her arms, yellow light around her head, green hollows in her cheeks. She’s not looking at the baby, but right through the center of the painting, like she’s breaking the art equivalent of the fourth wall. There’s a disdainful curve to her eyebrows that Dean remembers from what little he paid attention to Meg’s face. Dean wonders if Cas purposefully copied her
“Maybe I should check,” says Dean, and his voice is high with urgency. A little breathless. Just teetering on the edge of hysteria, and Cas knows it’s a bad night. Dean’s already half-way out of bed.
Additionally, Michael is not stupid. He knows that it took the combined weight of his own, Lucifer’s, Gabriel’s, Raphael’s, and God’s powers to bind the Darkness. It will take more than Michael and Castiel’s combined Grace to get the binding spell off the ground.
So, Jack gave Cas the choice, because he wasn’t going to force anyone’s hand. He’d learned too much about free will to do that. Cas could stay in the Empty and find his eternal rest with the others. Cas could return to Heaven, but this time as just a soul, and perhaps he could help Jack with some design changes there. Or Cas could go to Earth. He would be human. He would live and grow old and eventually die. And he could go anywhere he pleased. He needn’t return to Sam and Dean if he didn’t want to. Jack would drop him off anywhere on the planet he so desired.
It’s impossible to tell whether Charlie is home; although, Dean wouldn’t exactly want to talk to her if she was. He feels shitty. Of course he feels shitty. He wishes he hadn’t walked out. That was a really crappy thing to do. But he also…he also feels fine. Like not great. But it feels a little bit like resignation. Dean knew he was going to screw it up, so at least that’s out of the way now. He doesn’t need to tell anyone else about it because what are they gonna do? Tell him something he doesn’t already know?
“Holy shit,” Lydia says on an exhale. She puts a hand to her forehead. “Have you –” she begins. “Did someone say something to you?”
A red land rover pulls to the curb and honks its horn. Kaia immediately launches herself off the wall, stubbing her cigarette out.
Dean taps his fingers against his side, behind his crossed arms so the doctor can’t see. He wants to leave. He told the truth, dammit, so now he wants to leave. Now he gets to leave.
Somehow Sam – really Sam – met Dean’s eyes from within the mass of blinding light, and the bitch actually had the wherewithal to smile. “It’s okay, Dean,” Sammy said. “It’s gonna be okay.”
“Mmh,” Dean grunts. There’s a pause, then he says, “Fucking always hurts. And my hands keep shaking. Can’t fucking make them stop.”
“F-fuck you, too,” Dean chokes out, even though he knows it’s only going to make things worse. But he doesn’t want to deal with this right now. He wants Sammy to leave him the fuck alone. He wants to go back to sleep and not wake up again. He feels like he did after he woke up in the hospital, when everything was too close and too far and nothing felt real. Too much was touching him. Too many noises.
Mir nestles his nose into Dean’s neck and wiggles, licking him a few more times. Dean pats him. He’s shaking hard. He takes a few deep, stuttering breaths.
He’d finally worked up enough courage to text Cas after he hung up with Sam. He asked him where the gallery was so he could plan on catching the right bus, but Cas told him he’d pick him up at four.
“No – no thanks,” Dean says. It feels like pulling teeth, but Jesse doesn’t seem to think he’s strange, and merely lets Dean go with a cheerful wave.
“That’s not actually the case,” Billie says delicately. “It’s true that some parents use corporal punishment, but there’s a definite difference between that and a beating.”
“Hi, baby!” Lydia coos, showering Emma’s face with kisses, making Emma giggle. It’s like two entirely different babies. Dean tries not to let the hurt show on his face, but it feels like he’s taken a chest full of buckshot.
Sam threads his brother’s arm over his shoulder. His heart hammers in his belly. The fucking cops are
“Isn’t it?” Jesse says with a warm smile. He glances around the bar like he’s admiring it for the first time. “Gotta hand it to Cesar. It’s his vision.” Jesse gets their drinks as he talks, lining up one after the other on the counter. “Food’ll be out in a minute. And I’ll keep an eye out for anyone looking a little lonely.” Jesse directs his last comment with a wink to Charlie.
I like to structure my stories like a hurricane: start hard and fast, move into the eye of the storm (a lull, maybe a bit of drizzling), and then get bombarded by the other half of the spiral. Anyway, the last few chapters were the eye.
Dean’s face flushes. He stuffs another half of a pork chalupa into his mouth to hide his discomfort at being found out. Meg continues to stare at him; Dean looks away.
“I, um,” Sam rubs the back of his neck. It’s a tick they share when they’re nervous. Dean doesn’t really know what he’s supposed to do. He’s not used to being faced by Sam’s embarrassment. His brother always seems so sure of himself. “You could have called me, you know,” he finishes, still speaking in that soft, sort of hurt voice.
Sam gets filled in by Dean’s attending nurse – they have him on twenty-four-hour watch because he’s a suicide risk. Dean’s improved. He’s more aware of what’s going on around him than he was when they brought him in. He’s still not speaking, but he’s eating on his own. He hasn’t reacted violently. He hasn’t hurt anyone or himself.
The car loses traction on the slick pavement. Dean overcorrects. The back wheels skid. Metal screaming.
Cas smiles, like a genuine, relaxed smile, like Dean definitely said the right thing, and Dean’s chest glows.
Dean only fleetingly thinks about Cas, but even he knows that that’s not the kind of boundary you plow down when you’re – whatever Cas and he are. It really isn’t fair of Dean to keep piling things on Cas’s shoulders if Dean’s not prepared to open himself up to more from the guy.
, and now there are tears pooling in his dark eyes, as well. Dean’s heart sinks. Dean is so tired. The kids officially moved in a little over a month ago. Their days have been filled with toys, new clothes, favorite foods, kid movies, games, and anything else money can buy that will make Ella and Micah feel safe and at home in Cas and Dean’s house.
“Fine,” Dean says. His throat is tight. Jack isn’t sleeping. And he’s eating cereal at midnight. And he keeps doing all sorts of uncomfortable and vulnerable things that remind Dean that he’s just a human. That he’s just a kid. And he killed Mom less than a year ago. But he didn’t mean it.
“I’m ruining her life,” Dean tells the carpet. “I haven’t even met her yet, and I’m ruining her life.”
“Hold up for a second, Dean,” Pam cuts him off, raising a hand. “First of all, an apology doesn’t need to involve self-recriminations. You don’t want to take the focus off the other person’s hurt by making them feel sorry for you. You want to tell them plainly what you did, apologize honestly, give them space to feel whatever emotion they need to feel, and make an effort not to do it again.
“Text him,” Charlie orders, but then she must read the realization on Dean’s face, because her mouth drops open in disbelief. “Dude, you don’t even have his
“Yeah,” Dean says. His eyes burn. He fights back the strange urge to tell her more. She already knows he’s a shit person who abandoned his kid; it won’t change anything to tell her Sammy thinks he’s an unfit parent, too. But he doesn’t think he can talk about Emma, right now, without crying. And he really doesn’t want to cry.
They pull away after a moment. Dean meets Cas’s eyes, can’t help feeling a little sheepish, but Cas’s eyes are warm, latching ahold of Dean’s face so intently Dean has to look away. He ducks back into Cas’s chest, puts his nose against Cas’s neck. Cas drops a kiss to Dean’s forehead, and Dean closes his eyes against the feeling of Cas’s whiskery chin rubbing against his brow.
“That’s the red truck,” Dean points, shoving down his dark thoughts. He doesn’t have to worry about that, now. Christ, she’s a week away from one. There’s time. “He goes
As much as the constant buzz of activity had grated on Dean’s nerves when the apocalypse hunters had bunked there – the multiple sets of footsteps ringing through the halls, the constant chatter, the bodies invading Dean’s home – Dean had gotten used to the momentum.
“Cas –” Dean says a little desperately, voice all clogged up. He looks up finally to find Cas’s eyes soft on his face. Cas’s eyes are a little wet. The sight makes Dean’s own burn a little at the corners. “You gotta understand – when I said I don’t know how to do this, I wasn’t kidding. I’ve never – I’m not good at opening up, and I’m not good at – at
“I still do not understand the necessity of final exams,” Castiel pouts. “It is superfluous to put the students through so much stress when they have worked so hard the entire year, and I believe it merely hurts their understanding of the subject because so many of them cram before the test only to forget it all the moment they put aside their pens. That is not a way to engender long-term retention.”
Dean laughs weakly, but it punches out of his mouth and turns into a stifled gasp. He slides down the wall until he’s sitting on his ass, knees pulled to his chest.
“Is, uh,” Sam rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands. “Is that why you deal with, ah, you know. The hypersexuality, stuff? I know sexual trauma can –”
again. Splinter right down the center. Scream and hit the wall. Or maybe Mick. “It’s fine,” he says again. “It’s fine.”
. Because Bobby is as close to a second father as Dean’s ever had, and being reminded that Bobby is, in fact, legally Jo’s second father just makes it worse, because that makes Jo basically Dean’s little sister. And shit.
“Dean, it isn’t real,” Cas says softly. He bends his elbow around Dean’s shoulders so he can reach Dean’s head. He cards his fingers gently through Dean’s hair. “You’re safe. I promise you’re safe.”
He thinks about what happened on the stairs. And Sam is a trigger. Sam has always been a trigger. Dean knows this. And when he knows something, it makes it easier to control.
“Holy shit, it’s just hair. It has nothing to do with liking dick,” Dean snaps, and the table goes silent. Sam’s eyes are wide. He’s staring at Dean, and his mouth is slightly slack. It’s probably the first time ever Dean’s defended his brother’s hair – and it still looks stupid as fuck but – shit. The back of Dean’s neck is hot. It feels like flames are licking up his spine toward his brain.
“I just wanted to finish the movie,” Jack hedges. “My headphones broke. I didn’t want to play it too loudly in my room so I came down here.”
Dean walks toward the front of the courtroom to take his seat beside Sam and Mick, and he remembers, like it was yesterday and not almost four years ago, the last time he stepped foot in a courtroom.
The silence keeps up until Sam finally pulls off at a dingy roadhouse where the Impala waits, shiny and beautiful as ever, and Dean lets out a breath of relief, happy that she’s, at least, still something he can take care of.
Dean sucks in a ragged, steadying breath. He puts a hand over his chest. His ribs must be giving him hell. “We’re gonna get out, Sammy,” Dean says. “Tonight. I’m gonna get you out a’ here, okay?”
from her. She didn’t – it wasn’t like that, okay? It’s – I fucking chose to hang out with her. I fucking chose – I could have left at any moment. I could have fucking said no – and I – I didn’t, okay. I fucking let him –”
“Let me take your temperature,” Cas says. When he was gone, he must have made a stop at the Walgreens down the street, because there’s a crinkly plastic bag in his hand. He rummages in it for a second before he pulls out a long, plastic thermometer.
“Hundreds of nice, unbroken toes, I’d rather not risk it,” Charlie replies. Dean chuckles. “Besides, you’re dancing enough for the both of us, Fred Astaire.”
He looks at his watch and sees that it’s early enough to get down to the kitchen and make Sam a hangover cure breakfast. He peels himself off the chair, back protesting the awkward sleeping position, and then his bad knee almost buckles when he finally works himself onto his feet. God, it’s always the mornings that make him feel like an old man.
Cas makes a plate of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for Dean for an early lunch. He finds he’s strangely nervous when he reaches Dean’s door.
The sick feeling returns. Dean left his phone in the bathroom last night. This is Cas’s phone. He must have left it when he –
Cas hums in pleasure, a noise that never fails to send a thrill through Dean’s chest. He sucks Cas’s lower lip into his mouth, gently teasing the soft skin with the tip of his tongue.
Cas’s murmured pleading transforms into rapid fire cursing, “Fuck,” he says a little louder. “Fuck. Shit. Fuck this.”
Dean towels off Miracle to get whatever water he missed, and then he leaves the bathroom and nearly walks headlong into Cas, who is standing right in the middle of the hall, looking uncomfortable, and Dean wonders if maybe he’d been trying to convince himself to come into the bathroom to talk to Dean. Which means he probably has something he needs to talk to Dean about.
franchise, and he’s screaming at himself not to go downstairs into the murder basement, but he’s totally deaf to his own voice.
Initially, I included the term "Asperger's" to describe Cas's autism in this chapter. I've since changed it when user neuromagpie kindly pointed out in a
There’s a lump in Dean’s throat when he finally gives up and takes out his phone. Pickup wasn’t scheduled until 5:00, it’s barely after 10:00, now, but Dean’s not going to force his kid to spend time with him if it makes her miserable. It’s just cruel and unusual punishment at this point.
“Wait,” Lydia stops him. He turns. It’s her turn to blush. She shifts Emma from one arm to the other. “I, ah, wanted to, um, talk for a minute, if that’s okay.”
“It’s over?” Sam asks. Dean can tell his brother is crying. Dean feels tears well in his throat, but he swallows them down. He doesn’t need that right now, not when Sammy needs him.
Charlie chokes on her spit and stuffs her knuckles into her mouth to stop from laughing out loud. Her face turns red from the effort of staying quiet.
Dean’s face goes hot. He doesn’t know how to talk about Cas. He doesn’t know how to talk about any of it. “We’re not anything, cross my heart. It’s just – it’s fucking complicated, okay?”
“Someone’s modest,” Meg calls after him. Dean flips her the bird before he closes the bathroom door behind him so he can change without all their prying eyes.
“L-liked that jacket….” Dean says weakly, trying for a smile, but his throat just bobs noiseless for a minute. His face feels numb.
Dean looks up from his fingers. He finds Cas’s eyes are wet. And he’s staring at Dean with such unfiltered, unabashed adoration, it kind of makes Dean want to curl into a ball and die in a dark corner. But he makes himself just sit there and take it, eye contact and everything, because Cas deserves it, dammit, even if Dean thinks Cas deserves more, Cas disagrees, and the least Dean can do is try to be the kind of man Cas is in love with.
: something she can’t change about herself and shouldn’t feel ashamed of. After all, part of the reason she and Cas broke up was because she was poly and he wasn’t. So Dean knows they were open about it. He knows she didn’t cheat.
And that’s the thing Dean can’t stand: the total lack of autonomy, just like being behind bars again. The
“You’re in a good mood,” Sam says as he makes his way through the relatively empty, mid-afternoon Sunday streets. “How was the art show with Cas?”
He wheels over to the closet on the other side of the room, accidentally rolling over one of Ella’s building blocks. Dean already knows the closet is empty. There are too many wards around the house to allow anything onto their property. Besides, there’s no better alarm for supernatural activity then a dog, and Miracle was sleeping peacefully before Ella woke him up. But Dean still makes a show of throwing both doors open, checking between Ella and Micah’s hanging clothes, even ruffling through the hamper because it makes Ella give a watery giggle.
Charlie, if possible, looks even more delighted. “Hell yeah,” she says. “Let’s extreme makeover home edition this shit.”
The doctor reaches over to unbuckle the cuffs around Dean’s wrists, and Dean barely stops himself from flinching away. Then he undoes the strap around Dean’s chest. He gets up from his chair to go to the foot of Dean’s bed, unfastening the bands around Dean’s ankles.
Almost immediately, he realizes this is a mistake. Charlie climbs out of her window to join him, like she was waiting for him.
“Kid’s too stubborn for his own good,” Dean says uneasily. This is the second time he’s been told Sam’s working too hard. Dean needs to call him. Clearly his little brother’s not doing so hot.
“Hence my suggestion to remove your jeans,” Cas replies wryly. He’s probably doing that sexy eyebrow-raise thing. Dean wishes the room would stop spinning so he could open his eyes and check.
Dean can’t speak, so he twists the knob in answer, letting Charlie slip through the door. Her eyes are wide with sympathy. It’s that that makes Dean feel like he’s going to cry.
“Dean’s not a Hunter no more,” Ash says, and he wrinkles his nose like he’s confused, not trying to pick a fight.
“Kay, Bobby,” Sam says again, but this time his throat is clogged. He turns out of the bedroom and enters Bobby’s grungy bathroom, with black mold in the corners of the shower and exposed, rusty piping under the sink and toilet tank.
Dean breathes out slowly, shuts the washing machine and turns around. “He’s, ah, yeah. Can you drive him into town to get his car?”
A moment later, Cas is answering his brother’s knock at the door and relieving Gabriel of a pot of soup. They exchange a few furtive words that Dean thinks probably have to do with him.
Even in his haste, Dean remembers his strict policy – no clothes, no lights. In the back of his head, Dean’s aware of the risk of Cas feeling his scars: dozens of razor-bitten ladders climbing up his arms and legs, but usually his hair is enough to hide the uneven texture of his skin. There’s also the big ones: the inch-long incision where the surgeon went through to repair his hip, and the mess that is his left shin and knee, held together now by a long rod down his tibia and a couple of screws pinning his ACL into the bone, all relics of the car accident that put Dean into a 50 hour coma, month long bedrest, and six month long physical therapy and oxycodone jag.
Dean’s not too sure how long he’s just been staring at the wall behind Cas’s head. He blinks hard a few times because his vision’s a little fuzzy. His bowl of cereal is empty on the table, so at least he ate; Cas should be happy about that.
Dean’s lost count of how many times he’s closed his eyes during a quiet moment, prayed to whatever might be listening that he was
Eileen gets the dog out of the backseat, and the guys make fun of Sam for it, which Dean can’t help but agree with.
“I-I don’t know,” Sam says breathlessly. “He showed up at the Bunker. He called my cell when there wasn’t anyone there.”
“You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, Sam, okay? I wasn’t using the oxy to get high. And so what I overdosed?”
“I c-can’t,” Dean says again, helplessly, not even sure what he’s trying to say anymore. “I don’t know how to do this.”
Dean only gets through one mile of his run the next morning until he’s hacking up a lung. He blames the cold, dry air, but it’s getting harder to ignore the possibility that he’s worn down his immune system from under eating and lack of sleep. He wonders if he picked up whatever Emma had on Sunday.
By which time, his phone starts buzzing with an incoming video call from Eileen. Sam immediately swipes it open, and the relief at seeing Eileen’s face on the screen is so immediate and intense Sam almost starts crying again.
Dean’s silent for long enough for Pam to lean back into her chair. She crosses her legs. “What happened after that?”
Amara cocks her head. She stares at Jack with a curious expression. “Killing my brother would, of course, also mean killing Sam.”
“Shit no,” Dean says immediately. “Guy was just doing his job. Not his fault Dad wasn’t paying attention. And the – I mean, the doctors did what they could.”
“I’ve got you on 100 milligrams of Zoloft right now.” Victor purses his lips and taps his pen against the clipboard on his leg. “And I have down you tried Prozac when you were 19?”
“Howdy, Dean,” Jesse replies with a warm handshake. “Can I get you a drink to bring up with you? Cesar made nachos for the table.”
“My, ah, parents are dead, too,” he admits before he can think about how much he dislikes talking about his family. “Our apartment caught fire when we were little. Mom didn’t get out. And, ah, Dad died a couple years ago.”
“Is it though?” Dean demands, narrowing his eyes. Tongue suddenly rattling and unable to stop the rush of words from leaving his mouth. “Because it seems like maybe you don’t really understand what your role is here. You’re not my damn therapist. It’s not like I go around poking into all your relationships – making judgements about your mommy issues and how you can’t survive without a woman’s shoulder to cry on.”
“Mmh –” Dean tries to say, but liquid fills his throat. He coughs, sputters; he can’t get enough air into his lungs. And he doesn’t want to die here. He doesn’t want to die in Cas’s lap. He doesn’t want to die when Sammy is – and Sammy won’t know – And he sure as fuck doesn’t want the last thing echoing in his ears to be Rowena’s smug voice:
“Shit – I don’t – I don’t think I’m drunk,” Dean says, a little breathless against the surge of panic. Because is he? Dean doesn’t remember walking into the store. Shit, he doesn’t remember – he remembers sitting in Pam’s office. He remembers getting into his car and – and trying to scratch away the phantom press of Alastair’s fingers on his arms – and then – and then –
“Sam doesn’t want to leave you alone, right now,” Cas says, like it’s an apology. And Dean hears the creak of the wooden chair by the bed as Cas settles in. “He isn’t really angry, Dean,” Cas continues. “He’s just worried about you.” Which is basically the same thing Eileen told Dean when Dean woke up, hungover, at their apartment.
“Baby, I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” he mutters. He grips the steering wheel hard, doubles over to put his forehead against the dash, chokes on a gasp of pain when he rubs the cut on his forehead.
“No, it’s…fine,” Dean says. There’s a tremendous twist of nerves in his stomach, and then he shrugs off his flannel overshirt, bundling it into a ball and tossing it across the blanket. He’s wearing a short-sleeved shirt underneath, and the sun feels good on his bare skin.
“He’s not here,” Dean repeats firmly. But, God, he wishes he was. This isn’t – Dean doesn’t know what to do. Meg is Cas’s friend, not Dean’s. She called Cas. She deserves to get Cas when she’s feeling so vulnerable. Not Dean. Who’s floundering, whose palms are sweaty puddles, whose own brain buzzes with an undercurrent of panic.
“What experiences?” Dean says before he can think better of it. It’s sort of like hurtling down train tracks on a diesel engine.
“I think I’ll, um,” Charlie stops in the middle of the hallway at the top of the stairs, looking a little lost even though she grew up there. There are family pictures in the hallway, three people in various poses in front of various landscapes: a woman with dark hair and familiar dimples, a tall man with a bald head, red beard, and cheerful eyes, and a kid-shaped Charlie, who’s got her same goofy smile and lanky build. “Maybe I should start…?”
Forgetting is one thing, but it’s been literally years since Dean skipped his meds on purpose. And Sammy plus Pamela plus Victor are all screaming bullshit at him about
Cas says something to Sam before pealing off to his truck, but he doesn’t say anything to Dean, and Dean doesn’t…he doesn’t know what to do with that information. He doesn’t know whether he’s glad or upset he doesn’t have to deal with Cas right now.
Cas can hear the note of reluctance in Sam’s voice, and he’s sure Dean picks up on it, as well, because Dean says uncertainly, “So that’s it then, right? I’m going home tomorrow.”
Dean compensates for the dead weight of his left leg with his arm, levering himself toward Cas with one hand braced on the mattress. The other he uses to wrap around the back of Cas’s neck and draw his face close.
Dean’s fairly certain he’s got at least three cracked ribs. And there’s a dull, formless ache that hops from one part of his skull to the next, almost like his brain is playing wall-ball in there. And a few of his fingers on his left hand are puffy, purple, and stiff, probably broken from when Luca crushed them under his heel.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean waves her away. He fixes his watch on his wrist, pulls his amulet over his head, and sticks his ring back on. “You finished?”
“No,” she says firmly, because she knows how to read him like an open book, now. “You’re not. You won’t be able to help Dean if you’re asleep on your feet.” Sam opens his mouth to object, but Eileen puts her hands against his chest, shoves him slightly back toward the open door. “Go,” she insists.
Sam closes his eyes. He feels abruptly and strikingly ill, and he gulps air over the basin for a minute, urging himself not to throw up. Inside his skull, he keeps replaying it: Luca falling backward, startled look in his eyes, dark stain on his chest. Gun shaking in Sam’s hand.
But the guy was down. And there was a humming energy coursing through Dean’s limbs. Like he got on a hunt when he knew he was headed for the kill shot. So, he kicked the guy, one, two, three times in the ribs until he curled in on himself, whimpering. And then Dean kicked him in the face, felt his nose snap under Dean’s steel-toe boot. Blood spurted. The back of the guy’s head cracked against the base of the toilet and he went still. Silent.
– so instead he gets a face full of everything else in the room: it’s stacked with vividly painted, half-painted, and empty canvasses. The walls are covered with sketches, torn magazine pages, and strips of fabric. The entire place smells strongly of paint. There’s a box fan in the window for circulation. And there’s no furniture except Cas’s easel, a desk smashed in a corner, and the stool with the naked lady on it.
“Yeah,” Kaia says, and the hint of a smile is gone again. “Jody’s some lady cop who takes in delinquent girls. She’s fine. Just a hard ass. And Claire’s, okay.”
Dean hadn’t realized Benny knew that Dean took meds. He’s too exhausted and muddled to puzzle it all out, now.
“Hear that, Cas?” Dean nudges his shoulder against Cas’s. “No pot smoking in front of the nice cop lady.”
“You’re not fine!” Sam says. His hands are balled into fists. He looks like he wants to hit something. Dean has the sneaking suspicion that something is him.
He knows how to take apart his razor. He remembers how, when he was infected by the Mark, he used to slice his arm every day, just a little to check if the accelerated healing was still working, in case maybe…. And for a while in purgatory he kept track of the days by leaving scars on his arms. And after Hell. Because the pain was different. And he needed to be able to keep reminding himself it was different. That’s how he knew to tell Sammy –
“The mom was left alive. Except they ripped out her tongue. But she drew a picture of her attackers, here –” Sam turns his laptop around. Dean and Cas lean in to look at the screen. Dean’s aware of Cas’s knee as it inadvertently bumps Dean’s leg.
Lizzy’s apparently feeling shy and sleepy after her nap because she buries her face in Dean’s neck and pretends like Gertie isn’t there, which leaves Dean to strike up a conversation with Gertie about her future little brothers. He teases her about changing diapers, and soon has her solemnly swearing to teach ‘em how to climb out of their cribs as soon as they can walk.
“About that,” Cas begins carefully. “Jack and I went to visit a…ah, a house the other day. I had thought – Sam and Eileen have their own apartment.”
Maybe Dean is embarrassed now. Cas wants to tell him that he shouldn’t be. That nightmares are nothing to be ashamed about. That needing help –
Cas threads one arm around Dean’s back, keeps another arm fixed against Dean’s chest, and they make slow progress toward the door.
“It’s fine,” Dean cuts him off. And it’s like he just kicked the puppy. Because he knows Mick is genuinely sorry, even if he didn’t do anything wrong, because Dean agreed to let Sam be part of his legal team, which meant Sam had access to Dean’s records. It was just dumn luck that Sam hadn’t seen that part of them, yet. “It’s really fine, Mick.”
“I’ll get some water,” she says. She climbs out of bed and returns with a glass. Dean’s back to shaking, so Charlie holds the cup to his lips for him. Dean swallows with difficulty.
Somewhere in the distance, a dog is barking. There are sirens, too: the city’s constant call. Someone getting stuck or shot or raped. Some kid dead too early. Some homeless guy, prostitute, or junkie shipped off to Potter's field.
“Dean Winchester,” Billie says from behind him. The heels of her leather boots click and echo against something, but Dean isn’t exactly standing on anything. At least – it seems solid, except that it’s not. If he’s somehow ended up in the motherfucking clouds, he swears – “This is getting to be a habit, isn’t it?”
“We – we gotta, Cas,” Dean says rapidly. All at once. Ripping off the band-aid. The pain is sharp and sudden. “The cops’ll be looking for me. And I can’t – I can’t do that to Sammy. I won’t let them take me away from him again.”
“Dean,” Sammy whispers. His long fingers comb through Dean’s sweaty hair. “You’re okay, man. It’s okay.” Sammy puts his face close to Dean’s. Close enough Dean can feel his warm breath on his cheek. Like they used to lay when they shared a bed as kids, and Sammy would curl close if he woke up from a nightmare or if Dad came in late and drunk. Only it was Dean who’d whisper reassurances into his brother’s hair back then.
“Thanks, Bobby,” Dean says quietly. He presses the icy block to his eye, flinching a little at first contact but relaxing as the coolness seeps into the heat and swelling of his bruised face.
“I mean it, Cas,” Dean says to Cas’s face, now much closer than his face has ever been. And Dean can see every wrinkle, every hair in his eyebrows, every piece of dry skin on his chapped lips. Those lips are soft and warm, despite their dryness, when Dean presses his own against them. “I mean it.”
before he met her. Now he’s going to look like a total asshole. He knows a few signs from prison, but that sure as hell ain’t ASL. The nervousness that Sammy mentioned a couple minutes ago is suddenly there in full force.
. “It’s not like I’m fucking persecuting her,” Dean defends himself. “Charlie seems cool. I didn’t even ask her if she and her girlfriend would go down on each other while I watched.”
“Just tell me what you need, Dean,” Cas says gently. And he doesn’t sound like he’ll be angry if Dean asks him to stay. He sounds like maybe he actually means it, when he says he’ll be there.
“I don’t – you don’t gotta try again if you don’t want to.” Dean wants to make sure he knows that. He doesn’t want to guilt Cas into sticking around. “If you want to walk away – that’s fine. I mean, I’d be…”
Dean puts his little brother out of his misery. “So, what’s up? You forgot to tell us something at dinner?”
Dean doesn’t look away from Michael’s face. Dean’s wearing an expression that Sam’s never seen before: something closed off and calculating. Jaw squared and eyes hard. It makes something inside Sam’s stomach curl up small and shiver. It makes him feel like he doesn’t know his brother.
“How long have I been out?” Dean asks. He wants to get his bearing. It’s impossible to focus on anything; the room is still spinning. It’s making him nauseas.
“No,” Sam says. “No, Cas. No.” He turns back to his brother, digs his thumb so hard into Dean’s shoulder that Dean winces. “Dean, you don’t get the easy way out, you hear me? You don’t get to do this to us.”
Dean squirms. He makes a small, strangled sound that might have been a sob if it wasn’t for the tube in his throat. Cas brings Dean’s hand up close to his face, so close his lips nearly brush Dean’s knuckles, and Sam feels something deep inside him ache. The movement is so intimate, Sam might as well have walked in on his brother and Cas in bed.
Dean swallows back the wave of despair and frustration that rises in his throat. It’s fine. He’s fine. He just needs to keep looking. Maybe he can find another dump like Gabe’s – someone who doesn’t care who they rent to. He can – fuck – yeah, he can drag Emma into a building with drug dealers and crack whores and other losers like Dean. A fucking great plan.
“I didn’t realize anyone needed to say who they planned to vote for,” Eileen says, eyebrows creased in innocent inquiry, but Dean recognizes the note of danger in her voice.
It’s not like Dean’s been actually sleeping all this time, mostly just staring at the wall or looking at the back of his eyelids while his brain cycled through the usual dark thoughts and the feeling of hopelessness burrowed deep into his lungs.
“Not,” Dean insists, voice constricted. “It’s not, Cas. It never has been. Everything’s just a big fucking joke and – and I’m so t-tired. So f-fucking tired, Cas.”
“I thought that was just, you know,” Dean says uncertainly, “being aware of your surroundings. That’s how my dad trained me.” But now that he thinks of it, he doesn’t notice Sam still eyeing everyone up for possible hidden weapons, even though he was given the same spiel about unspeakable, invisible evils.
“Oh, no, you’ve already done so much –” Dean protests awkwardly as they all round the house toward the driveway.
But Dean’s done. He’s done with questions. He wants out. He needs to get out. He wants it to go away. He wants it to end.
“No,” Sam answers. “I did.” Saying it makes it true. Dean taught Sam to shoot a long time ago. Sam must have been about seven. Sam remembers his older brother’s steady, capable hands guiding Sam’s fingers on Dad’s army-issued Colt MKIV.
“Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean,” Cas whispers frantically, and his fingers are on Dean’s chest, pulling at his shirt. “Look at me.
The parenting class he took over the winter impressed on him the importance of routines. He never had much of a routine growing up – no bedtime or bath time or time to eat meals. But things seem to go much smoother with Emma if Dean keeps to a set list of activities. She’s more likely to cooperate with taking her bath if he talks her through a promise of a bedtime story well in advance.
