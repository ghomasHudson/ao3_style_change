“It won’t stand,” Greg tells them, resolutely ignoring the fuming coach inches away from him. Greg wants to put a little space between himself and Sherlock, but refuses to give even the slightest impression that he is backing down. “Molly took a hard hit. She was falling fast and knocked her face right into an elbow. She could have mistaken anything for the poke of a needle. And how the hell could they get a syringe on the track? Tell me that.”
He smiles at John lovingly. John’s eyes fill with every word until one tear finally tumbles down his cheek.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock confirmed quickly. “Naturally nothing that would compromise patient confidentiality, but the work and advice of a skilled surgeon would come in very handy. Maybe even at crime scenes, if you’re willing.”
So...stick around for the end of the case and its aftermath. It's a pleasure to entertain you and thank you again for all your support. It means so very much to me.
The cry set John’s body alight with an unexpected energy. He stepped right into Sherlock’s personal space and they popped together, their bodies skirting the line of what was appropriate in public. They turned and leaned and undulated in unison, turning up the heat as they did so. Sherlock dropped in front of John with his back to the doctor and rose again thrusting his perfect ass against John’s groin. John moaned out loud. The sound disappeared into the noise of the club and the music, but Sherlock heard. His head was cocked to the side so he could watch John with a saucy smirk as he continued to grind against him. John placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips and pulled him tight. They swayed in tandem as they worked their way across the floor. Sherlock’s back was hot against John’s chest, his hands aflame where they rested on John’s.
“Sentiment,” Sherlock’s tone is dismissive and John gives him a look. “After Victor, I determined that sentiment is a defect on the losing side.”
He pauses a moment and mirrors Sherlock’s warm smile. Maybe it is the wine he drank earlier, although he did not have nearly enough for this, but Sherlock feels pliant and cozy. The soft oranges and yellows from the lamp lights in the room make the deep red of John’s shirt look even softer. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth curl further and he allows his middle finger to just barely graze John’s elbow.
“I look forward to it, John,” he smiles. John smiles back almost like a shy school boy and they share a quiet laugh.
2. Sherlock knows the place and the boat, but now WHICH boat? We've already seen that he doesn't have much time. How is he going to figure it out?!?!? Gaaaarrrrghhh!
Poor, poor Greg. He's such a good man and doesn't deserve to be pulled into the life of a murderous bitch like Mary. Tears.
The men glance at one another like two school boys who have been caught out. Sherlock’s expression is one of apology for saying too much and John’s is resignation.
“Not if it’s you,” Sherlock replied with a glance towards the club. “He might not even know without me to pull him away from this place.”
Sherlock fell silent again, his lips clamping shut as though they had acted of their own accord and he had finally managed to regain control of them. John stared into his horrified face and blinked. The initial surge of anger John had felt began to drain from his body, not even replaced with shock like Sherlock. To his surprise, John felt completely at ease and something he had not experienced in months sparked at the back of his mind: the warm glow of happiness. It bloomed through his mind and filled his body with light energy that John readily embraced.
“Coach!” HardOn had suddenly yelled form the track. “Stop mistreating Ph.D. He can’t take care of our sorry asses if you keep bustin’ his.”
Sherlock thanks him and sits down. He looks back at the skaters again and then gazes across the aisle at John. He has a curious expression on his face. His lips turned up on one side in that crooked smile Sherlock loves so much. His stomach flips, even as he affects nonchalance.
At that moment, the door to John’s office opens as someone knocks on it sharply and Sherlock Holmes walks into the room.
“Well, well, well,” Budreau walks to Sherlock and John and stands before them with a look of interest, “what were we doing here, gentlemen? Evening on the lake to watch the sunset and have a drink?”
“Goodness, boys, settle down, settle down,” she clucks. “I could hear you all the way down the hall.”
“You are a coward and a hypocrite. You hold others fast to the rules while you break them as it suits you. You are pathetic, Mr. Holmes, and I’m going to put a stop to it.”
Before I turn you loose, I just wanted to thank you all for your love and support. Thank you for all the kudos and comments. Each and every one touches my heart and keeps my spirits up. I love and appreciate all of you, whether you've read everything so far or just one chapter. You all mean the world to me. Thank you and enjoy!
“I’m always at the stadium just like you,” John says with a smile, “and I’m not one for going to a gym in the middle of the night. Or getting up at the bloody break of dawn.”
The dream, and marriage, ended in 1987 when Mr. Hudson was arrested for larceny, embezzlement, drug and sex trafficking, and murder. Some of his crimes were directly related to the team and some not. For her part, Mrs. Hudson testified against him and sealed his fate with a smile on her face. After her husband’s conviction, Mrs. Hudson spent the next six years doing everything in her power to rid Rock City of disgrace. She fired everyone on staff and dismissed every team member proven to be willingly involved. With the rubbish cleared out, she rebuilt from the ground up. She slowly re-established her own reputation and the team’s along with it. When she finished what had once seemed impossible, she was finally in a position to attract talented newcomers again. One such young upstart was Gregory Lestrade.
“I took the liberty of examining the wound while you were making preparations,” Sherlock replies haughtily. “There are two visible shards in the skin. Possibly more.”
It is not a question exactly, but his tone rises at the end as though it is one. Greg had donned his scuba gear and disappeared into the water when they were still quite far from The Crown. Sherlock could easily see its four occupants on deck, but not clearly enough to determine who was who by features. He still knew, of course, based upon their relative positions. He knew John would be in the water soon and that they needed to act fast, but had no idea how quickly Greg could swim or how easy it would be to find John once he got there. Sherlock had tried to delay Moriarty as long as he could and John still went into the water before Sherlock would have liked.
Not a term here, but when I refer to a triangle formation it is made of of three blockers. One faces the jammer and is the head, or top, of the triangle. The two remaining blockers stand side by side, facing the head of the triangle and facing away from the jammer. The head has a hand one of of each of their shoulders and they each have a hand on her shoulders. This keep the triangle tight and steady. The head shouts commands to the other two blockers because she can best see the jammer.
What did you all think of one, James Moriarty? Grade A Bastard, as John thinks? Not sure yet? Well, we shall see. Trust that this is not his only appearance in this fun little fic. He's like a bad penny. He always turns up. Oooooo! It's so much fun to quote Indiana Jones. He is the pinnacle of hot. THE MAN, my bestie and I used to call him, in spite of the fact that he is the same age as our fathers.
I can't help myself. Take some solace in knowing it happens to me too. I really surprise myself with some of the stuff I write because even I have forgotten some of the nitty-gritty by the time I've finished a story and begin typing and editing. It's true, really. When I edited this one, I got to the end and just exhaled a quiet "uhh". I felt totally deflated and thought 'Damn, Jane, you really wound me up for that goodnight'. I felt like John with the disappointment in my eyes and whatnot. I do hope you have all come to love my villainy be cause it isn't going to stop. Mwahahaha! (diabolical laughter, diabolical acting) More bonus points if you know where that one's from.
She puts her hands on her hips, but one is soon on his shoulder. Sherlock stares up at her, weighing her words carefully. He finally dips his chin in a shallow nod.
“It’s one of the bigger ones in this building,” Sherlock tells him as they walk. “If I’m not buying a house, I might as well still have what I like.”
“Yeah? And they pay you for sticking your nose in?” was the first thing that popped out of John’s mouth. God only knows why. He was not usually such a tease, nor such an idiot. He watched the flicker of hurt slither over the brunette’s expressive face and bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from repeatedly hitting his head against the bar counter. Nothing like opening his mouth and inserting his foot all the way down his own throat, he mused of his actions, especially considering he was in a somewhat relationship with Jim and all, but there was something about this man. It was something so powerful and too complicated for John to understand just yet.
Trying to clear his mind and focus on what is real, John leans against a wall and watches Sherlock as he stands by the window, playing his violin and looking down on Baker Street. The clock on the mantle strikes midnight. John blinks slowly, peacefully, having finally found something to quiet his thoughts. He starts when Sherlock stops suddenly and places the violin on his desk. He strides toward John, a smile quirking on his lips as he approaches. John steps forward in question, but backs again as his flatmate nears. Sherlock crowds in, invading his personal space, his back against the wall, and fixes intense eyes upon him. Completely captivated, John watches as Sherlock’s full lips part. His voice comes in a low rumble that starts a faint tickle at the base of John’s spine.
“You’ve no reason to fear, John. No reason to hide. That is all behind you and has no bearing on us now,” he explains in a very serious tone. “It will not write our future or cloud my view of you. No relationship is exactly like another.”
When Greg opens his eyes, the coach is closer and wearing the same face he does in the huddle. The face that motivates every one of the ladies to kick ass on the track, and Greg feels it too. It starts down in the pit of his gut and roils up inside his body, bringing with it new focus and determination until Hell, yeah, we’re gonna find who’s behind it and we’ll make ‘em pay!
John searches his eyes. Sherlock can tell he is trying to chase away the worry from his own dark blue gaze. It might have worked if anyone else was looking into his eyes, but not Sherlock.:
“Have I ever given indication to the contrary during our association?” he asks, but it is not really a question.
“All right then,” John wets his lips and slips his fingers into the waistband of his boxers. Sherlock’s brain stops as he watches John pull the waistband down to reveal a hipbone, the wound and skin much lighter than the rest of John’s body. Sherlock’s mouth goes dry.
Sherlock, on the other hand, now seems to be annoyed in addition to furious. He rolls his eyes again while John stands fixed to the spot and studies him. Clearly frustrated, Sherlock steps forward and tries to muscle his way to the door, but John has none of it. After another try to no avail, the coach backs up with a long and angry sigh, and glares at John with his hands on his hips.
Moments later, the two men are seated in the living room. John is on the couch and Billy sits in the recliner just opposite. John purses his lips with no idea how to start. To his surprise, the older man beats him to it and cuts right to the chase while he’s at it.
“You certainly don’t have to use it on my account,” he looks across the car roof with a bright smile. “I believe the proper term for my home is condo.”
John’s moves intensified as the verse came to an end and he began to mouth the words in anticipation of the chorus, giving Sherlock a cheeky grin as he did it. The man matched his expression and movements beat for beat.
Of course John hears none of Greg’s side of the conversation and can only guess at what he said to elicit Sherlock’s expression of shock. He is about to whisper an inquiry when the coach lays his mobile on the table.
“Okay, okay,” John almost whispers. He clears his throat and looks at Sherlock with more of his usual certainty. “So, how do we find him? Maybe Greg…”
After a short cab ride through London, John emerges from the car and walks swiftly into a tall, but rather inconspicuous building. Getting through security is no problem, due to his association with Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, and the fact that has been summoned to the building before. He makes a beeline for Mycroft’s office, ready to push his way passed the man’s rather surly secretary. Much to his surprise, he finds himself staring into the eyes of the elder Holmes when he walks in.The gatekeeper is nowhere to be found.
His gaze slides along John’s torso and stops on the exposed skin. He can just see a smattering of light curls that disappear into the boxer shorts. He blinks and shifts his eyes to the wound quickly, hoping John did not notice.
So, John gave up dating. Sherlock did sit up and take notice of that, certainly, but never pointedly asked John why he had done it. Instead, he made more benign remarks and inquiries into John’s love life. “...that is, if you do not already have a date for tonight…” “...you haven’t brought any of your insipid women to the flat in weeks…” and the like. John mostly ignored these comments and went about his business.
do it again in the future. He has already gone over this in his mind palace enough times to know he cannot act on these feelings. It is too great a risk.
“It’s been over a long time, yeah,” John said definitively. Jim’s expression changed instantly. He pressed his thin lips together and inhaled deeply, a long centering breath. He glanced down for a moment and gave a slight nod of resignation.
“How was school today?” he asks. It is a tact he has used before - engage in friendly conversation and work his way to more serious topics. He loves talking to Rosie. She is so full of life and energy. She loves speaking with people, especially Sherlock because he is the one person who will do ‘grown up talk’ with her. Mycroft does to a degree, but steers away from certain subjects. Sherlock does not place restrictions on their conversation topics. It is just as complex and honest as with anyone else. Rosie has quite the vocabulary as a result, though she does not always use said words correctly.
John collapses to his knees immediately and Sherlock drops to his own in front of John. Leaning forward, he cups John’s face in his hands and presses their lips together in a kiss that reawakens John’s spirit. He slides his fatigued arms around Sherlock’s waist and holds on. When Sherlock breaks the kiss, he continues peppering John’s mouth with small kisses as words fall from his lips like rain.
John was enjoying himself so thoroughly, he almost did not notice Sherlock slowly closing the gap between them. It was not a huge shift of the space between them. Sherlock was not suddenly up in his business, grinding against his leg, but he was closer nonetheless. The tips of John’s ears prickled with heat and not just from the dancing. His whole body was hot with it. A burning deep inside of him, just like the feeling low in his stomach was not so much from nervousness as it was from anticipation of what was yet to come. Would Sherlock inch even closer? Did John want him to? Goddamn right he did.
John leans forward over the back of the sofa and looks at his flatmate with a sideways smile. Sherlock glances at him with narrowed eyes.
“Hm, I’m more concerned about this,” he bends to look closer at a dark bruise on her ribs just under her left breast.
John finishes the last of his notes when there is a knock on his door. He grants entrance as he types the last few words and closes the file. He stands as Bloody Mary Morsten walks in, closing the door behind.
“Shh. Shh. Don’t, Sherlock. It’s okay. I’m right here,” John whispers. “It’s going to be all right.”
I considered a summary and then decided on no spoilers. Although I would like to add a disclaimer. I was watching/listening to Inception for the first time while writing this and I think it influenced me a bit. (shrug)
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and stick with me. Your support means so much to me and inspires me to keep writing no matter what. Thank you all. I love you. So, until next weekend...Keep your pants dry, your dreams wet and remember, hugs not drugs.
Suddenly feeling as though he may burst into a million pieces if he doesn’t cover John as completely as he can and shield him from harm, Sherlock rests his head on John’s thigh. He still holds one hand and wraps his other arm around the smaller man’s body, holding him tightly.
Holy shit, Jane!! Not Molly! WTF are you doing?! Weren't you just telling Pat and Franc how much you love her friendship with Sherlock? Why would you try to off her, you bitch? Yes, I know. I'm evil, pure and simple. But she's okay, friends. It'll all be fine. The real question is who did it and how? On the track? Immediately after? But I get ahead of myself. I'm skipping straight to the question portion of this end note.
“No…” he struggles to speak, to hold his eyes open. “John…” Sherlock’s eyes close and silence surrounds him.
Knowing he isn’t going to fall asleep again anytime soon, Sherlock gently kisses John’s forehead and quietly gets out of bed. He pads out of the room and down the hall, stopping only when he reaches his desk. Sitting down, he begins going over various documents, on paper and on his laptop, in an effort to find Moriarty’s safe houses and hired hands. He has evidence of several crimes, both already committed and still to come, that he must discuss with Lestrade in the morning.
“We always use the same company,” Sherlock answers, “and we always request Lawrence. He chauffeured us around my first time here and every one since.”
“You know now,” his words silencing John. “Now you can help Molly find out who’s doing it and then prove it. I have the tox report, but it isn’t much good without a suspect and proof.”
“I would do anything for you, John,” he replies after a few seconds. John looks at him, that ghost of a smile still on his face. He pulls away the elbow Sherlock has been touching throughout the conversation and extends it until his hand is resting on the coach’s bicep. A shiver surges through Sherlock’s body and he is sure John feels it too because his smile widens slightly.
“It is possible,” Sherlock lightens his tone. “You were fully submerged for quite some time and are still wearing the same clothing. I’m surprised your teeth aren’t chattering. I’m assuming you were out of breath before Greg found you.”
“Shall I take you back to the stadium?” John asks, breaking through the quiet spell in the air around them. “Did you drive in this morning?”
She slips out the door, waving and pulling it shut behind. Sherlock purses his lips and turns his head to face Greg, who frowns back at him. The GM holds out a cautioning hand to Sherlock upon seeing his expression.
“They weren’t accidents, Dr. Watson,” Billy’s voice is stern and his eyes are so intense a pang of discomfort jets down John’s spine. “Every one of those incidents was sabotage.”
“She really has put her trust in you,” he says quietly. “Yes, I was poisoned. I made sure everyone was told it was a bad case of food poisoning to avoid panic, but a couple of them knew what really happened. They could tell.”
“Yeah?” John asked with anticipation. He had looked like a child at Christmastime, his bright blue eyes shining.
Find out the answers to (some of) these questions and (perhaps) many others in Chapter 4, which (if I had chapter titles) I would simply call "Dinner?".
“Right. Tell me if you get dizzy or anything,” Greg says in a serious voice that demands John’s full attention. John nods and Greg helps him turn to face the ladder. He seems to sense that John’s tired muscles are ready to give out, but does not utter a word and John is grateful for it.
By the time Sherlock finished, they were well into another song. It was the third in a string of songs that couples could use to their advantage, which meant there would be one more and then faster songs would rule again. John and Sherlock would have to part and dance further apart again. It was the last thing John wanted.
Their eyes are locked on one another. The human eye can say so much without words. John’s are open and honest, conveying his every emotion so articulately. But there is also something that remains so clearly hidden, just beneath the surface. What Sherlock wouldn’t give to know what it is.
WTF does Mycroft mean by "I will do whatever is necessary to keep harm from coming to [both of] you"?
That said, thank you again for all the support and well wishes AND great feedback. I appreciate it and value each and every one of you. How better to show my thanks than post another chapter right on the heels of this one. Watch for that to come before the weekend. Did I say before the weekend? That only leaves tomorrow. Ah!
“Sherlock, there is absolutely no proof that Moriarty has anything to do with this,” he lifts his hand in placation when Sherlock opens his mouth to protest. Against his better judgement, Sherlock remains quiet to hear the doctor out. “I’m not saying I don’t trust your judgement. He is definitely a suspect. I just don’t want you to convince yourself that we should only focus on him is all. It could easily be someone else, anyone else at this point.”
John is alone in his room. He has been a prisoner for seven days. It is hell. The time on his own is frustrating, but preferable to the alternative. John has tried every way he can think of to escape and all to no avail. The wires holding him to the bed cannot be broken and are so tight that he cannot inch his way out of them either. His wrists and ankles are heavily marred from his efforts. Jim will still bandage them on occasion, but only long enough for the wounds to stop bleeding. John discovered that the protection they offer made struggling easier and nearly had a hand free late last night before Jim made an unexpected visit. After a rousing fight that ended in John being securely tied again, he was forced to suffer terribly for his efforts.
“Fine,” he says in a calm voice that is almost unsettling. “May I remind you of our position on fraternizing with the skaters?
John looks at Sherlock and is damned if the coach doesn’t look like he knows every thought in John’s head. Sherlock could probably see it all plain as day as it flickered over his features. John huffs to himself in fond exasperation before making a small bow, befitting of Poe himself.
I love reading all your thoughts and fears in the comments and look forward to more. A shout-out to my Pat, Purrfect and Brna, and newbie Anna, all of whom have helped me battle fiercely against a downturn in mood of late. Thank you so very much. To my beloved Sherly, Hiddles and Julie, I hope you are all well and I see you again soon.
The dance floor was already packed as John walked into the club. He had expected nothing less for a Friday night, and a late one at that. It was just after eleven o’clock and the club was in full swing. The lights were low and the bass thumped a steady rhythm he could feel in the floor beneath his feet. It had been a long day at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, packed with patients and an emergency surgery right at the end that kept him late again. He had dashed out of the hospital as soon as he was finished and grabbed a cab to a chip shop around the corner from the club for a quick bite. He came straight to the club after that one detour. He had meant to arrive earlier, like nine o’clock earlier. He could only hope the man he was to meet was still here, or had been here at all. Now the pounding music and vibrating floor rippled electric sparks through his body, making him want nothing more than to join the pulsing throng of people on the floor. He had the burning desire to be free and forget everything, but he had to find someone first. The man of the hour.
Sherlock shrugs as he places a bandage and begins taping. John looks right at him, sparing none of his attention for anything but the man before him.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I hope to get the next one out soon. If nothing else, I'll see you after the holiday. I love you all and thank you for your kindness and support.
He stands aside and John walks in hesitantly with a ta. In moments, they are seated on the couch, sipping from water bottles. There is an air of discomfort and awkwardness between them that crushes Sherlock’s heart. He has never felt this way with John in the whole of their association. Even when they met and he attacked him with accusations and suspicion, John was completely at ease. Irritated, yes, but not uncomfortable. Sherlock’s mind works fast for a way to fix this.
Riley holds Sherlock’s shoulder as he sits him next to John. Sherlock takes in the doctor’s condition in a glance. His skin is pale and his whole body shivers where he leans against the boat with his eyes closed. Unacceptable. Sherlock turns back to Riley abruptly.
* Oh my god. How much sex are they going to have? Because, because this is hot. H, O, T, HOT. I'm looking forward to more of that and I mean just for reading. You know, because I wouldn't do anything but read when I'm reading that. (clearing his throat and glancing away) Where's my unicorn?
“What can I do about this fuckstick? It’s like I have target on my back,” Harry complains. “How the fuck do I stop her riding my ass?”
Sherlock shifts back, but is still close. His gaze falls to John’s chest as it rises and falls, the thin fabric of the shirt pulling taut over his pectorals. Sherlock can just make out the darker outline of a nipple before he forces his eyes back to John’s face, trying desperately not to stop on the man’s lips.
Sherlock leans forward a little to look at John straight on. He nudges John’s thigh where it is still nestled under the blanket and the doctor raises his eyes to look at Sherlock from beneath long lashes. Sherlock wets his lips and inhales a silent breath, his pulse quickening slightly.
Also, BLOODY MYCROFT!!! And isn't Dr. Hoover the coolest badass ever? EVAH! Even though she doesn't have a huge part in this story, she's one of the favorite female characters I've written to date. What did you all think of John's final words? Isn't it just the icing on the cake and yet, totally leaves you wondering what will happen next?
Then he realizes his own hand still rests on John’s, warm and soft, and for much longer than is normal for friends. He grins uncharacteristically foolishly, hoping it will distract John while he slowly slides it off. The doctor just chuckles quietly and says nothing. Sherlock chastises himself in his mind for being such an idiot. Is this what love does to him? He clenches his jaw irritably. No. He was never like this with Victor. This is what John does to him.
Sherlock’s lips curl into a knowing smirk, but he does not have the chance to speak because Angelo is suddenly at their table.  He asks about dinner and if they would like dessert or more wine. Both give him their compliments and turn down both offers. John goes on a bit about the alfredo and Sherlock can’t blame him. It is amazing.
Are your hearts broken? I can hear you now. "Jane! Jane! How can you even live with yourself after ending the Part this way??? Oh god, Jawn. AND Sherlock." I know, but Pat and Purrfect do call me Empress of Evil for a reason. Speaking of which, how's that for angst, ladies? Heh heh heh. I really AM evil.
When the chorus began, both John and Sherlock leaned forward toward each other. John’s lips parted and new droplets of sweat bloomed at his hairline. Not just from the dancing, but from the desire pooling in his belly and the thoughts taking root in his mind. John quickly lifted a hand and wiped his forehead in an almost unconscious gesture. He had never eye-fucked someone so hard in his life and every bit of the effort was reciprocated.
“Molly stayed in the midwest. Well, Ohio before heading back to Detroit and I followed Victor to California for grad school. I hadn’t intended on studying, but I was bored with my job within five minutes and Victor thought I’d enjoy school. Molly and my parents did too, for that matter.”
Thanks for all the love and support. I truly will never get tired of saying that. You all are The Best.
John’s eyes go wide and his lips part in shock. It only lasts a second before the doctor schools his expression, looks at his hip and then back at Sherlock.
You know, the first time I did this in my first story I never intended it to become a thing. Seems a little silly to have teasers at the end of every chapter and I'm sure some people find it annoying. Of course, when I think about that my Deadpool side comes out and I just think "Don't care. You don't like it, don't read it. We all do what we like and go about our business." But I digress. I have to say that my little question and answer section has become a great source of amusement. Yes, indeed. Anyway,
A wave of panic descends throughout Sherlock’s mind palace when John disappears over the side of The Crown with a loud splash.
John furrows his brow in determination and continues to work his hands within the ropes. He’ll be damned if he goes down without a fight. After a few seconds, John shakes his head and lets out a few bubbles to combat the burning sensation in his chest. Soon his lungs will feel like they are exploding and taking a breath will be the only way to combat it, whether John wants to or not.
Don't worry, my friends. I won't leave you hanging for long. I'm already editing Part 3. It looks like I may have done the same thing with the chapters as this one, so I'm not even sure how long it is. I may have actually edited all of chapter 1 already and just don't know it yet. Ha! In any case, I'm plugging away and will try to post soon. Also, be warned. Some of the tags are going to change and I'll be adding warnings as part of the chapter summaries.
“I did, yeah. There weren’t a lot of kids in my neighborhood, so I spent most of my time on my own. That’s how my parents discovered my aptitude for knowledge,” John dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin. Sherlock licks his own lips and his eyes fall to John’s for just a moment. The barest hint of a moment is all he allows himself and his damn stomach flips again. He sighs quietly.
“What the hell is she doing, Greg?” Sherlock is already asking. “Did she learn nothing from the disaster that was Phillip Anderson?”
John snapped his mouth closed quickly, unsure of how long his lips had been parted in wonder and awe. Too long judging by the smirk the man gave him with that sidelong glance as he continued to sway his hips. God, he did it with such skill it was obscene and John could not stop himself staring. He swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry, and took a sip of scotch. John had seen this man here before quite a few times and he had seen him go into the back offices with Greg almost every time. He had even seen them leave together and yet, John had never asked Greg about it and Greg had not volunteered. John had simply not thought it any of his business. Now John wondered why he had never stopped to consider this one exception to Greg’s rule.
“It really isn’t,” John scowled, directing his glare to his boyfriend. No, not boyfriend. That was not what he wanted.
Sherlock looks around the boat quickly and sees a length of rope hanging from a nearby hook. He lifts off Moriarty just enough to grab it and sets to work tying the man where he lies. He rises as Moriarty turns his head to look at him in a daze.
“Uh, no reason. I just.. I’ve never heard of it before,” John replied slowly, trying to gather his thoughts.
“She does have a bruised rib,” John interjects in an unassuming tone. He is not about to get defensive about this, something he is not responsible for.
John and Jim had started growing apart a long time ago. They were happy once and for quite a while, in fact. They met when John was still in med school during the A&E rotation. Jim was working in construction and had sliced a substantial gash in his forearm. They hit it off while John stitched him up and Jim asked him out before he left for home that night. The rest, as they say, was history.
“Mine too. It just never worked out for them,” Sherlock admits grimly, remembering how he used to ask his mother when he would have a brother. He was too young to understand at the time. Sherlock turns his gaze back to John and continues. “Then the Hoopers moved in next door. I was six and Molly was five. We were instant friends. We did everything together. Neither of us really had any family. Grandparents dead and the like, so we spent holidays together. We would have one at my house and the next at hers.”
Sherlock takes a toothbrush still in its unopened package and a small tube of toothpaste from the bucket. Replacing the bucket and standing, he catches John’s curious eye.
“I’m sorry,” he says simply. His big brain cannot come up with anything better or more eloquent than the truth. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Right. Sherlock’s cases. You’re right,” his lips are a thin line and he bites his upper lip. His eyes dart away from John’s and he grabs his pint, hurriedly taking a pull.
Clearing his mind to focus on the here and now, Sherlock rises from the couch and walks briskly to the foyer as another pound to his front door sounds through the hall. He leans in close and peers into the spy hole to see John Watson’s head and torso. Sherlock steps back, his mind confused by the man’s presence and his stomach already doing those annoying flips.
Hahahahaha! Thank you again for all of your love and support. I'm having an amazing time and I hope all of you are too. For what it's worth, this has been the most fun I've had writing anything (and I've written a lot throughout my life). You all are fantastic!
“John, no,” Jim’s hand was on John’s chest and he pressed in as close to in between them as he could. “It’s fine.”
* Why do you torture John so?? He's such a good and sweet man. (I know. I love him too, but I'm afraid I often make my favorite characters suffer.)
“Good. I want to take her straight to the closest ER. If her tibia is broken the way I think it is, she’ll need surgery,” John’s voice is crisp. He is in full-on doctor mode, his orders for the two men clear and concise.
“Torch?” Sherlock’s eyes crinkle at the edges and John looks at him blankly for a moment before realizing. He smiles brilliantly before he can even think twice about it and Sherlock’s heart swells at the sight.
“She checked all of her equipment a few hours before the bout. It was all fine, but a bearing came loose and the wheel flew right off,” Billy’s voice is very grave. “Even that could have been coincidence, but her knee pad blew out as soon as she hit the ground. There’s no way. No way in hell.”
“FINE,” he replies through clenched teeth, wrenching his arm away and walking to his room. He mumbles as he goes. “You’re as bad as Mycroft.”
Holy shit, Jane!! What the hell were you thinking?! And you goddamn sneaky bitch. That chapter summary was so cute and I never suspected for a minute that it would end like this. Oh. My. God. (Yes, that's right. It's so intense we're spelling out the words.)
“For god sake,” Sherlock mutters. He opens his eyes and looks toward the team, catching Molly’s eye almost immediately. “I’ll be back.”
While we're talking about future chapters, you might have noticed that this Part has been shortened from ten chapters to seven. It finally happened. I usually guess at the beginning how many chapters a Part will break down to, and I usually underestimate or am spot on. Well, this time the Part isn't as long as I thought. So there is but one chapter left. Just one. I'm about to edit it a second time and when I read through the first time, it was lovely. Just lovely. I giggled, I cried, I'm giving too much away. :O
“I’m inclined to agree, but won’t know until you clean it up,” John’s voice is tight. “It hasn’t stopped bleeding. Could need stitches. You up for this?”
“I’m not rushing to anything. It makes perfect sense. The bastard wants to win and will do whatever it takes to do it.”
Until then, keep your pants dry, your dreams wet and keep you stick on the ice. We're all in this together.
“What are you afraid of?” John shouts, dispelling Sherlock’s distracting thoughts. “What do you think I’ll find out? I remember your sister nearly blowing my head off. I know you broke me when you faked your own death. And then you waltzed back two years later expecting everything to be the same, but nothing was the same.”
Sherlock feels like he is floating. He lets out a long, smooth sigh and then opens his eyes to find John staring back with an unreadable look on his face. The doctor blows out a quiet breath, his eyes searching Sherlock’s. His body is full to the brim with tension.
Sherlock rolled his hips and head, fingers sinking in his hair. John was dancing just as enthusiastically, but also completely mesmerized. He had not felt anything like it in some time and he did not even try to stop it. It was the feeling of attraction and one so strong he gravitated toward it like a moth to a flame. His life was suddenly full of possibility and so intoxicating John could never turn away. He and Sherlock fit together like the pieces of a puzzle. There was no denying it, but did Sherlock feel it too or was John just another person on the dance floor?
“Do you want me to put a towel down before you sit? Because you are going to sit on the bed,” he says, meeting his wide eyes. Are his pupils bigger than the lights should allow? They are certainly beautiful. Blue like the ocean, clear and open. Then John blinks and looks down at his feet as he shifts them.
Until then, keep your stick on the ice.    -- and yes, I'm sad the NHL suspended the season, but I get it :(
There it is, my friends. Part 3 begins! I thought I'd reward your patience with a nice, long chapter.
When Sherlock pulls away, he’s quickly off the sofa and walking toward the door. John looks after him in frustration, uncertain how to proceed. Sherlock glides to a stop in the doorway and turns back with a sincere and almost shy look on his face.
Sherlock on the dance floor with his long, elegant limbs and swaying hips. Such amazing hips. He could move like no one John had seen in real life and it was captivating. Lithe and smooth, every step and swoop and shift in perfect alignment with the music. Sherlock effortlessly danced to any song or genre and Greg’s DJs liked to mix it up too. From hip hop to techno via pop or the 80s. They were even known to throw in slow songs so patrons could relive their high school prom nights. Jim always wrapped his arms around John and snuffled into his neck during those songs. John had tried to do the same, but his heart was never in it, especially during the last few months.
“Harry, if you’ve flooded your room again, I will not be responsible for my ac...tions,” Sherlock loses the vehemence in his last word as soon as he sees the figure at his door.
“You should see your face,” he struggles to say, his body tilting slightly from side to side with laughter. Realization quickly dawns on John’s face and he shoves at Sherlock’s arm, mumbling something that sounds like prat. He wears a smile of genuine amusement only a moment later and laughs with the coach.
JANE! JANE! DOES THAT MEAN?!?!  Yes! Yes, friends, there will be a Part 8. Editing will soon commence.
can fuck with her turf. The Woman twirls her head toward the track dramatically in invitation to the others to join her. They each nod, steel in their eyes and tenacity on their faces as all five women skate onto the track and get into position while Sherlock remains on the sideline. He cannot resist a quick look to John, who is across the track standing in the aisle with spectators all around. He looks inconspicuous enough, but can hear most of what the other team is saying. It is perfectly legal as far as the official rules go, but the two men have to watch carefully that they do not do anything that looks even remotely like signaling. Any cheating results in disqualification and Rock City is still undefeated at this point, which is difficult, but not unheard of.
“Certainly not!” Sherlock replies indignantly and wishes he could take it back as soon as he sees John’s face. Definitely not the best way to react when John still has no understanding of his personality at all. “Sorry.”
“Hey, Coach!” Harry ‘HardOn Skates’ Dewhurst calls from the track. He shifts his gaze to her in response. “You know your phone is ringing, right? Turned up the volume so you wouldn’t miss a call from Lestrade, wasn’t it?
I hope you all enjoyed chapter 3. I know we didn't see John and you're probably worried about him. Rest assured, he'll be in the next chapter, but I can't say things will be going well. :'(
John looks at him with nothing less than adoration and gives him a radiant smile. He believes he knows Sherlock better than most, maybe even more than Victor Trevor had, the wanker, but he wants to know more. He wants to know every detail of this man and his life. Every thought and memory, every feeling, every inch of his body. God, his body. John saw so much of him last night and it wasn’t enough. He longs to explore Sherlock’s body again, worship it with his hands and his mouth.
“Right. You’re all coming to the station so we can get this straightened out,” a tall sergeant orders all four of them. “Cuff ‘em, Riley.”
“An erogenous zone, my…JESUS CHRIST!” John gasps, his hands suddenly clutching at the sofa. Sherlock skillfully leans across John’s body and seals their mouths together. His tongue immediately winds around his flatmate’s, tastes and breaths mingling. Both men feel like they have been kept out of heaven until this very moment and sigh into one another.
Dropping his bags onto the bed unceremoniously, Sherlock runs a hand through his hair and sighs. They boarded Mrs. Hudson’s charter plane that morning, destined for Baltimore and a bout against the Rolling Ravens. With the bout on the following day, they loaded a bus and went straight from the airport to the practice facility to get some footwork and scrimmaging in. It is now around 5:30 and, having just arrived at the Sussex, they are all dropping bags in their rooms and meeting back on the bus for dinner.
Sherlock blinks. He cannot believe his ears. Trying to keep the surprise from his face, he concentrates on John’s features. Honesty and curiosity are the primary emotions he sees and they make him love John that much more. Flip.
Thanks again for all of your love and support. I'm always open to comments and suggests. They are my bread and butter.
The close of the song bled right into the next one. Without missing a beat or pausing for awkwardness, Sherlock held one of John’s hands to his chest and slid the other around the shorter man’s waist, taking the lead. John put his hand on Sherlock’s hip, flashing a sly smile and effectively stealing the lead. Sherlock laughed and followed John as he set the pace for their steps. Around them, the whole dance floor began to relax after the long stint of nothing but fast and furious. Many headed for the bar to make Greg’s night incredibly harried once again.
“Nonsense. My calculations and strategies for upcoming bouts are coming along perfectly,” he told her around a mouthful of chocolate chip cookie dough. “Besides, there is nothing in this world that is more important to me.”
John moved away from them and turned to look across the dance floor. Sherlock was gone. John turned his body to face the mass of people fully, a pang of alarm shuddering through his body. His eyes darted around the club, but found nothing. Finally, his focus settled on the door just in time to see a long, swooshing coat topped with a head of gorgeous curls swoop out into the night air. Sherlock must have stashed the coat somewhere before introducing himself to John. John’s heart clenched painful in his chest like a piece of it had been wrenched out. Sherlock had left and John would never see him again if he did not hunt the man down right now.
“You really are brilliant,” John said sincerely. He bit his lip as he watched Sherlock’s face slip from one expression to another. It was not the best thing to say and John had meant to say Sherlock’s deductions were brilliant, but he could not take it back and part of him did not want to.
“I know,” he replies like a sullen teenager. He meets Greg’s eyes and already knows what he is going to say next. Rolling his own eyes, he blows out a breath that flutters the curls resting on his forehead. “I’ll be nice.”
Sherlock licks his lips and begins to imagine what it would feel like to touch John’s lips. What must they taste like and how would they feel against his own? Or on his collarbone, his shoulder. Sherlock stutters back, staring at John with wide eyes. He absolutely was
A corner of the detective's mouth curves up and he fixes the man with a doubtful, yet taunting expression.
“What?” John shakes himself back to the here and now, only to see both Sherlock and the guide looking at him curiously. He blinks once or twice, trying to devise from Sherlock’s face what might have been said.
Sherlock becomes more and more concerned about Moriarty's plans for John, and begins to fear his feelings for John are damping his deductive skills.
Sherlock stares at him, expectant and annoyed. He even jerks his head forward to punctuate the unspoken addition.
“I was not suggesting that you couldn’t,” Sherlock looks at him evenly. He narrows his eyes. “But you do not have all of the data.”
The two gaze at each as the taller man takes a small step closer and looks at John with an open, honest expression. John’s heart skips a beat while Sherlock’s next words give him a heart attack:
Sweet baby jesus. I forgot the questions. How could this happen? I'm surprised you all didn't think the evil empire finally found me and replaced me with a pod. Rest assured, I'm still me and no impostors have taken over. That said, here we go...
A couple of logistical notes. I have marked this Part as being 9 chapters. The truth of it is that, as I have been editing, everything I have written from here on in claims to be one huge chapter. Needles to say, that is not the case. I don't what I was thinking while in my creative process or where the chapter divisions went. In any case, I will be splitting them into shorter chapters. I guessed on the number as 9, so it could turn out to be more or less. I'll keep you informed.
Sherlock straightens and removes the gauze, and his hand, from John’s hip. The angry mark on his skin looks so hateful, marring what is otherwise a gorgeous landscape. Sherlock clears his throat and looks at John, nodding toward the wound.
“I’m sure you did,” Sherlock assures him when he trails off. His index finger joins his middle one, touching John’s elbow gently. “You must have saved countless lives over your career.”
“Longer than he expected to be. He said he was on a schedule,” John’s voice is harsh and Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise. He had not expected the attacker would have spoken to John and the fury simmering just beneath the surface of John’s words makes Sherlock wonder what else was said. He is suddenly and inexplicably compelled to lighten John’s mood.
“Now just calm down,” Greg Lestrade rises from the chair behind his desk. His hands are out in a placative gesture and he quickly side steps around the desk to stop in front of the furious man before him. Cold, hard grey eyes burning with fury are trained on him as he moves. If looks could kill he would be flat on the floor. Greg might have considered appealing to John to diffuse the situation, but he is just as angry.
Sherlock’s expression changed in a heartbeat and his relaxed posture tightened into stiff muscles. His smile vanished, becoming a clenched jaw with muscles working beneath the skin. John felt the open door between them slam shut. Sherlock released his hold on John’s arms and began to step away. Shit, John was not entirely sure what he did wrong, but he had to make it right.
“You really think so?” Sherlock’s brow creased with confusion as John studied his reaction. It was positively endearing, perhaps because it was so unexpected. Sherlock had obviously made his deductions to impress, but still seemed genuinely surprised by John’s response. He was not used to being praised for his abilities, which told John all he needed to know about some of the assholes at New Scotland Yard.
Sherlock’s hand flies to the man’s face and cracks against his jaw with splintering force. His head falls to the side, blood spattering on the deck and staining Sherlock’s shirt. Moriarty’s arms fall limply to the floor and, for a moment, he is completely still. Then his legs begin to move slowly from side to side as he fights to stay conscious.
He clicks his tongue and slips out the door, closing it on his way. With a small smile on his lips, Greg lets his eyes slide from the door to his coach. Sherlock is glaring back at him.
Hello, everyone! I'm so sorry it has taken me so long to get this chapter out. I've had some troubles reading through the rest of this part, but I'm working day and night. I promise!
“Nine and ten,” Sherlock answers, silently cursing his damn stomach. “From then on we started blocking each other. Sometimes we got other kids in the neighborhood to block while we jammed.”
“See that you do,” Sherlock commands in a steady voice. Mary nods, glances at John one last time and then slinks out of the room. Sherlock turns his furious gaze from the now closed door to John.
John puffed out a breath of annoyance as his eyes ran the length of the floor like laser beams tracking prey. Though his focus was razor sharp, it was still a challenge to find any one person amid the countless bodies crammed together in the space, but the man he was looking for was very hard to miss. He was very distinctive in his look and manner. He always put on a show for John’s benefit or was getting into a fight that he never started, as he often declared in a, frankly, obnoxious tone to everyone within five feet. John huffed again. The man he was looking for was decidedly not there and never had been, in spite of his promise.
Sherlock nods against John’s shoulder and tries to avoid looking him in the eye as he schools his expression, making sure his eyes reveal nothing when they meet John’s. He desperately wants to let out a long sigh and tell the truth, but how can he? How can he tell the beautiful man before him what Moriarty wants to do to him? Hurt him…fuck him.
Ahhhhh.... I'm sitting back on my sunchair with a margarita on the rocks, no salt. Idk about you, friends, but I feel very refreshed after that case. Just like John said, no danger, no risks, no hospital. Just a good, honest case...of murder. Well, you know... That's not what I mean. Murder isn't honest, but Sylvia Piper was when she confessed. That woman has balls. I like her. It's too bad she's a killer. Anyway, I wanted to say that this one time - case wise - it was not entirely original. I borrowed a couple ideas from two of my favorite old episodes of Murder, She Wrote and adapted them. I was very excited about ice cream the evening I wrote this chapter and just HAD to include it in some way. The result is a giant walk-in freezer in the opulent office of a mafia king. LOL
John’s breathing normalizes within a minute and Sherlock should really get off of him. He knows he should. He absolutely cannot take advantage of their close proximity and position, but a war rages in his mind, each side battling for control.
Sherlock studies John closely. He doesn’t know why he hesitates, but still does. He can trust John with his concerns. He trusts him with his life, for god sake, but this is different. This is a feeling not backed by logic. Ordinarily, he would tell no one and dismiss it as an absurd lack of concentration. Sentiment. But John. He will understand and still Sherlock watches him, unsure. He soon finds himself looking intently at every aspect of John’s expression, getting lost in his eyes. The crinkles around them, the way his brows punctuate every expression, and his mouth… God, his mouth.
“What??” Sherlock ceases his pacing and gesturing to stare at Greg, utterly taken aback. Greg’s lips creep up on one side, giving him a kind of crooked smile. He has the upper hand now and intends upon using it to the fullest.
“When Claire, her name was Claire. When she told me she was pregnant it was because she wanted me to marry her,” John licks his lips and stares at his water glass like it holds all the answers.
“My cases?” John questioned. He had not expected that. His profession did not seem nearly as interesting as the detective’s.
“What did you say?” Greg growls slowly. Neither one answers, only staring at Greg after his sudden change in demeanor from confounded to absolute anger. “Someone threatened John in
Sherlock raps his fingers on the desk one by one in a distinct pattern. He glances at his notes. At the clock. Back to his notes.
“Do someone else,” John suggested lightly. Sherlock looked relieved and he let his eyes wander all around, looking for the next subject. John pressed his lips together and licked them with trepidation, never taking his own eyes off the taller man. “Do me?”
“Look, how else do you explain the poison?” John presses in next to Sherlock, nudging him out of Greg’s face. The GM is certain it was not done to make him more comfortable, but is glad for the distance nonetheless.
“I may not have been the only target after all. You and Molly have to stop it before something terrible happens. Get Sherlock to help. He will face the devil himself for the ladies. He’ll listen to the two of you. Don’t dismiss him as a lost cause.”
The words rang out in the air around John and he increased his pace until he was running for the door. He burst through it and stopped in the middle of the pavement, looking right and left almost frantically. He was not there. Sherlock was nowhere to be found. It was dark even with the streetlamps, but the tall man should have been visible. John looked both ways again. There was not a single figure on the abandoned streets. There were plenty of cars passing by though. John’s shoulders began to sag as it became clear that Sherlock must have caught a cab. John chewed on his lip in disappointment and stared out into the street. It was too late. He had missed his chance.
Sooo... Only one chapter left. Will there be another part? Will all of us need to keep persisting? If you'll notice with me for just a moment. Just about every character in this story has to do that on some level.
There it is. His intuition laid out on the table with no basis in logic, just a notion that something is off. He expects John to scoff, tell him he is a weak-minded fool and walk away.
It is in the second section (divided by asterisks). If that is a trigger, you may skip the entire section or stop reading where I have underlined and pick up again where underlined.
“That’s not what people usually say,” Sherlock mumbled after watching John for a moment. The next song increased in volume as the last one faded away. The prom-themed dance continued as John’s cheeks tinted at the thought that he and Sherlock were a couple. He hoped the detective had not noticed as he asked the next question curiously.
“No, it’s not about the bathtub,” John answers as he thinks What about the bathtub?, but doesn’t ask because he does not want to be sidetracked. He squares his shoulders and clears his throat. “There’s something much more important and we have to talk about it.”
So what happens now? What just happened exactly? Tune in next time for the answers. Same bat time. Same bat channel.
* Will Sherlock change his mind about sentiment and whatnot again? (God, just the thought is exhausting, no?)
He pulled a now stunned Sherlock in so their heads were close together. Their faces only inches apart, John eyed the man with an almost childlike excitement.
Goodbye, my friends. It's such a hard thing to say. I hope we will meet again. I will never stop writing. It is a part of me as much as you and these two idiots are. Keep an eye out for me because i'll be back. I pledge to make our boys fall in love again and again with you all by my side. 😂 Until then… Keep you pants dry and your dreams wet and remember, hugs not drugs. We’ll all get through this together.
“Yes,” Sherlock says again in a smooth tone. He notices a shiver ripple through John’s body and narrows his eyes. “I do. Thank you, John.”
John stares for a beat, giving the man the opportunity to defend himself. When he says nothing, John shakes his head and sneers in disgust.
“What makes you think you could have made it to him?” Sherlock asks. His tone is firm, but empathetic and John gazes back with uncertainty written all over his face. He looks lost and yet, ready to hear what Sherlock has to say, ready to believe. It hits Sherlock all at once that John has never spoken to anyone about this before. He has never been able to put voice to his pain. He has never trusted anyone enough to share it. Sherlock takes a moment to let the weight of that realization wash over him before he speaks.
Whew. Okay, that was a bit excessive. I'm like a woman possessed. Am I wearing a skin-tight black and red leather suit right now, living out my Deadpool dream? (uh, no)
Thanks so much for all the awesome input on the first chapter! I love reading all your thoughts and seeing what you think might be ahead for our Boys. Thank you all for being readers too. I know I keep saying this, but you all mean the world to me. I just can't believe all the positive responses and hits and fans each part has gotten. I never expected this and I owe it all to you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
“Riley is correct on all counts,” Greg begins calmly from where he stands, “and we were not here on a pleasure cruise. The truth of the matter is Moriarty, that man you’re pulling from the water and a woman named Sarah Sawyer brought Dr. Watson out here against his will, intending to kill him.”
Unfortunately, Mycroft agreed with Greg that they do not have enough evidence to prove anything and that it would be useless to go to the police. Plus, that would only alert Moriarty to their suspicions. Instead, Mycroft enlisted the help of a few friends on the force who could look into Moriarty’s activities without being noticed. There had been no news thus far and with no further attempts on anyone, Sherlock and the others must simply maintain the holding pattern. Something will happen soon enough and they must all be ready for it, but the frustration of waiting becomes more and more evident, especially in his new roommate.
“Greg, you can’t be serious,” John says incredulously. “Given what Molly remembers and the indications of a puncture wound on the back of her neck.”
“John,” Greg’s face brightened as he placed a glass in front of a woman who winked at him as she picked it up. He gave her a sort of lop-sided smile he had perfected over the years and then turned his attention to John. “Rather late for you, isn’t it? No work tomorrow?”
“Sherlock,” Greg replies sternly, gesturing at the man, who finally comes to a stop directly in front of the desk, “need I remind you that Martha Hudson owns the team? She can hire anyone she likes.”
John purses his lips and widens his eyes in exasperation, moving his body away from his flatmate’s. This is definitely NOT how he wanted their first night sharing a bed to go.
“Sorry. Your apartment,” John sneers the word and then laughs. “I’ll never get used to that word no matter how long I live here.”
Riley looks from coach to doctor and nods sharply. He rises and immediately addresses the sergeant. Already getting an earful from Greg, and beginning to understand the circumstances of the rescue, Budreau gives his approval. Riley adjusts Sherlock’s handcuffs so his hands are also in front of his body and then helps John to walk down the steps to the cabin. The man remains with them for the duration of the trip, standing back and silently watching, but neither Sherlock nor John spare him a thought.
Sherlock furrows his brow deeply and watches John closely, but remains silent. For a moment, John thinks he is going to say something. That all the feelings he hopes Sherlock hides away will spill forth like a damn breaking and flood their flat with possibilities. There is a light just beginning to shine in those piercing silver eyes that John would like to coax into a flame burning brightly, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared and Sherlock closes himself off. He lifts the violin once again and resumes playing.
Sherlock stops dead and stares straight ahead, every muscle in his body rock hard with tension. He turns to Greg abruptly, livid and eyes blazing.
I thought I'd take a moment to remind you all of how I said this Part might go into extended chapters. Well, I was wrong.  It all broke down into ten after all and I will be posting chapter ten, the last chapter tomorrow. Da da daaaaaa!! I hope you all like it. Until then, friends, feel free to tell me how you feel and what you think. I love you all.
“Read people?” John’s brow rose to his hairline. “What? You mean you can tell what a person is thinking?”
“Oh god, yes. I’d love to,” John blurted, lifting his hands from his hips and holding them out slightly, not sure how to contain the ecstatic energy within his body. John watched as Sherlock did the impossible: His smile grew and warmed into true fondness. John’s heart gave a squeeze as they began to walk down the pavement together, the sound of music fading away as they went.
“But now you think of old Angelo and bring your date to the best restaurant in all of Detroit,” he winks obviously at Sherlock.
“Yes,” John breathes. He swallows and leans forward, sitting on the edge of the couch. “She told me about the accidents.”
I also forgot to thank my beautiful, wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. You have helped me hone my craft more than you know and no, I do not always do it just to please you. I like how it can help me paint a clearer picture of the characters, what they're doing, and what they're thinking. (She knows what I mean.)
“Not if I kill you first,” he cackles loudly in the detective’s face. “I should’ve done it already. You’re on borrowed time, Sherrrrrlock.”
His eyes slip closed as he carefully analyzes each strategy against each jammer. His hands steepled with fingertips just touching his lips, every sound filling the stadium fading away as he enters his mind palace. This is the place where all the information is stored and every skill will match up with his ideas.
2) Speaking of, what will Jim have to say about this? John's taking a big step defying him. Mistake??
“He is very opinionated,” Billy laughs, “and has one hell of a stubborn streak. He can be a handful.”
“You didn’t,” Sherlock says simply. John huffs a quiet, disbelieving laugh as Sherlock leans in. “You are concerned about your past, about what I have learned of it, especially this morning.”
Hey, it seems like I just did question time without even realizing and not in the usual format. Bugger.
“No,” Sherlock replies, sobering, “but he appeared in the playground after school the next day and extorted us.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, my friends. Don’t hesitate to ask me anything or just say hi. I truly cherish every comment and answer them in my own long-winded and crazy way. Just ask my newest of friends, My Bread and Butter. I'm pretty chatty. Lol.
. John could tip his head forward mere millimeters and his mouth would be on Sherlock’s soft cupid’s bow. God, it would be life-altering. Lips so soft, so perfect, and they would move with John’s. He knew they would.
Sherlock looks around while John checks his watch. The dining room is empty. Sherlock wouldn’t be surprised if Angelo is the only other person there.
“You should know by now not to keep us waiting,” Hella teases, standing at her seat with a knee resting on its cushions.
“You even suspect he is seeing someone else. He has increased the time he spends with a certain friend, especially in the last four months, but you have done nothing to alter your relationship,” Sherlock gazed at John for a long moment, obviously seeing his growing irritation. His lips parted in what might have been an apology, but instead Sherlock spoke firmly. “He is not cheating.”
“Good. Yes. Stay with John and stay out of trouble. We’ll figure this out when you get home,” Greg says with a hint of that GM instruction in his tone.
Sherlock places his left hand on John’s bicep to hold him steady and touches the wet gauze to the wound right at the curve of his shoulder. The skin around John’s eyes tightens slightly as he watches the gentle ministrations clean away blood to reveal an angry dip where the skin was split open and the muscle marred.
John’s eyes snap open again when a third lubricated finger joins the other two. He grits his teeth and swallows the pained groan in his throat. He will not give Jim the satisfaction of making a sound. Instead, he glares daggers at the man and growls a command.
In one swift motion, Sherlock pulls the flare gun tucked in his waistband from behind his back and fires it at Moran. It whizzes past his right ear and flies far off over the lake where it explodes, alerting every other boat in sight to the trouble. It also sets off a chain reaction on The Crown.
“Oh, sure. Of course he isn’t,” Angelo winks at John conspiratorially. “Come. I’ll take you to his table.”
My god, I cannot believe it's the weekend already. Idk about you, but it has flown by for me. This new normal really is so weird. My husband says it won't change anytime soon. Gah.
“It’s fine. Just leave it. I need to get this bandage on and then you will tell me everything that happened.”
And yet, there he is. Still at Sherlock's side, still wanting to know more and learn more, wanting to understand why he did what he did and why he didn't tell John about his sister. He wants to get to the truth of it instead of blowing up. Greg was right when he said John is more patient than he was before and Sherlock was right when he said John is using everything he ever learned from him to put his memory back together. When Sherlock blames himself for what happened with Eurus, John comes to his defense. For as smart as Sherlock is, he doesn't always follow his own advice. Don't just see. Observe.
WTF, JANE?!? WHERE THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM?? I can hear you all asking it. The answer is that I have woven a great tapestry that comes to life in this story and it isn't over yet. (I hope you are all as excited as I.) How can I call something Persistence and cut it off at three parts? No, no, my friends. The story goes on. And because I love to do this (and because it seems very appropriate after this chapter)...
“Nicely done, Dr. Holmes,” John jokes, eyes bright and amused again. “Now all we need is a bandage and you’ll be doing my job. I don’t think I’d be very good at yours though.”
“They are the only family he’s ever known,” Sherlock replies, rolling his eyes and then adding. “Aside from the reindeer.”
“If you’ll pardon me, sir,” Riley observes as he heads for John and Sherlock, producing another set of handcuffs as he goes. He nods back at Greg. “This is Greg Lestrade, General Manager of the Rock City Rollers.”
Sherlock’s eyes are watering so much he can barely see and they begin to close. He can see himself in his mind’s eye as he gasps for breath. John must look the same, struggling not to gulp in the liquid all around.
“I can see why you like it.” Suddenly music starts playing and John jumps back, standing straight. “And, oh my god, they’re singing.”
“As a matter of fact,” Sherlock gives him a smartass grin, brows still raised. He places the gauze he is holding back on John’s hip, fingertips grazing the soft skin, and then reaches for John’s hand. He places it gingerly on the gauze. “If you would be so kind.”
He gapes at John, his mind suddenly back in focus. His eyes dart around the room and at John’s face. Seeing no trace of Moriarty, Sherlock sighs and lets his body fall limp onto the bed.
“Accountant. Recently subscribed to a conspiracy theory that the company he works for is secretly financing an investigation into the death of John Lennon, who he believes is still alive and hiding somewhere in Yorkshire,” Sherlock stated as his feet took a step forward and back to the rhythm. He pulled John in a bit so they were closer when John gave him a stunned look. “There is no investigation, of course, and Lennon is most certainly dead. Not so in the mind of our friend with the beard, which he grew for his lover.”
He kisses him again and then along his jawline to his ear. After a few good nibbles, he ducks his head down under John’s chin and snuggles up to his chest.
(Hmm. I'll be honest, that terrifies me. I've written nasty Moriartys before, but this one is so calm and subtle. He has such potential for evil and is so quiet about it. He threatens with looks and with his eyes and with smiles. He told John what he wants and he might lose his temper if John defies him, or worse.)
Thank you again for all the love and support. I love having little comment conversations, so thanks to all who left one and even responded back. Every one of you, reader and commenter alike, makes me smile.
What?? John, no! NOOOO!  Talk about sacrificing yourself for the one you love. Eesh. And poor, poor Sherlock. He's so grief-stricken he doesn't even see the truth when Greg says it. And what does he immediately turn to for solace? Sherlock, no!
He never did find his voice before John continued speaking. John did not think better of saying the word and Sherlock never brought it up, not wanting to hear John correct himself. Sherlock knows he should forget it, assume it was a slip of the tongue and not pin any hopes on it. His conversation with Greg weeks ago has still not motivated him to say a word to John for fear of what the doctor will say. For the time being, he would still rather live in ignorance and misguided hope than know John does not think of him in that way.
And what about Sally's "Yeah, I like him too much" line? WHA??? So much more is going on around Greg than even he knows!
“I got him off a murder charge,” Sherlock answered in amusement, his rumbling baritone honeyed with satisfaction. John gulped, so caught up in the sheer brilliance of this man. There were a thousand questions in John’s mind and he wanted to ask every single one as soon as they could get out of the club with its loud beat, blaring music and tons of people.
“I believe I misjudged you, John,” Sherlock called over the noise around them, his face every bit the smug bureaucrat who is too posh for his own good. John raised his brows in response, an unspoken question on his lips. He wanted to take whatever Sherlock was about to say seriously, but how could he possibly do it when he had that look on his face? Sherlock continued in a very superior tone, barely keeping the corners of his mouth from quirking upwards. “You’re a much better dancer than I expected.”
John is fed up with Jim's shenanigans after the catapult and goes to Mycroft for help, much to his chagrin.
“I’ll drive you in my car,” he placates in a soft voice that surprises even himself. Sherlock looks to the paramedic for approval as he continues. “We’ll go to the ER and get you taken care of.”
Stay tuned for the next chapter. As you can see, this part is much more subdued than the last, but how long will that last? You all know me, after all. (infamous eyebrow waggle) Thank you for all the love and support, and happy reading!
“Don’t be,” John answered, removing his hand from the man’s shoulder. “We’ve already moved on and it’s better this way.”
Sherlock’s criminally full lips quirked and his eyes warmed at the challenge, revealing shining flecks of green. For the next few minutes, Sherlock selected the most interesting subjects from the people around them and revealed the various secrets of their lives. Most were fairly normal with a few stranger outliers. It was all fantastic as far as John was concerned. From the boring Tesco clerk who snuck crisps and biscuits while stocking the shelves to the florist who taught her parrot to say ‘fuck you’ to troublesome costumers, John soaked in every word like a sponge.
“And the physique,” Sherlock says before thinking and immediately closes his eyes, cursing internally. John just laughs.
John stops short. He stares at Sherlock a moment with wide eyes, his muscles tense. He looks as though he has either given himself away or been caught in the cookie jar. What had he been about to say?
“You looking for him?” he finally asked, passing John a bowl of bite-sized pretzels. John nodded his thanks and tossed one back, grateful that Greg always remembered he was not a fan of crisps, at all. Greg still jibed John about it.
“Did they test your IQ or send you to boarding school or…” Sherlock trails off. He feels like a nosy idiot. John must think him a fool, especially since he already said his parents didn’t enroll him in nursery school - is that preschool, he wonders - based on geography. They couldn’t have had the funds for such things if they needed a school nearby. As if reading his mind, John shakes his head slightly, taking a drink of water.
John breathes slowly into the regulator when Greg hands it over and pushes down his fears. He cannot let himself panic, but how the urge does grow and it is all he can do to tamp it down. Sherlock said Moriarty would not kill him, that he wanted to destroy him instead and leave him to live with the pain. Moriarty himself said as much on The Crown, but Sherlock was pissing him off on purpose from the moment he showed up. He has a real knack for doing it too. God, John hopes he didn’t push the man too far.
“Not a chance,” Sherlock gave a single shake of his head and huffed a laugh. “Angelo’s well on his way home by now.”
Sherlock sighs, places his hands on John’s shoulders, and rolls them onto their sides. He looks into his flatmate’s deep blue eyes and tries to rid his own of the anger he feels. He is not angry with John and does not want him to mistakenly believe it so. He is, however, furious with the situation. He cannot allow Moriarty to disrupt their lives any further, but he cannot lie to John about the man’s motives. He must tell him what he has deduced, even if it may only cause John more concern.
John gives him a roguish grin before turning to start up the ladder. It is harder than it should be, so he goes slowly. The pain of the wound has lessened, but his muscles are tight and pained. There is no cramping yet, but it is only a matter of time. It will most likely start in his calves, which will make climbing this damn ladder even harder. John grits his teeth and concentrates on his task, moving one foot up and then the other, one rung at a time.
Sherlock turns his hands under John’s and twines their fingers together as he lifts them to his lips, pressing a kiss to John’s knuckles. The doctor lets out a breath and bites his lower lip. Sherlock’s eyes track every movement. He mirrors the action and then slowly, deliberately glides his tongue across his own upper lip, knowing his teasing has John’s full attention. He raises his eyes only after John’s breathless gasp reaches his ears. They stare at one another for a full minute before John clears his throat and breaks the spell. Sherlock lowers their hands, but does not let go.
Sherlock’s fork stops half way to his mouth and he raises his eyes to meet John’s. The moment hovers thickly in the air between them. Sherlock cannot tear his eyes from his colleague’s face. The doctor looks content and relaxed, his eyes full of admiration. Sherlock clears his throat and shrugs his shoulders.
When he opens his eyes, John no longer sits on the bed before him. In fact, John is not even in the room. Sherlock’s eyes look from side to side sharply, his brow furrowing with worry. Is John even in the condo? Sherlock jumps to his feet just as the en suite door opens and the man in question appears in its frame. He still wears only boxer shorts and Sherlock feels his knees weaken a fraction. Flip.
“Did you?” Sherlock asks, not failing to notice John has not moved his elbow. The doctor raises his eyes and looks at him sadly.
4. Speaking of our duo, will they grow ever closer now that they are working the derby racket AND trying to solve this mystery together? (If you know me, and you do, you already know the answer to that question too.)
So, the story continues. Now we can all see if our intrepid duo is interrupted or if Cakey Jane, evil though she is, surprises you with very exciting and much anticipated intimacy. Only one way to find out!
They lie down in one another’s arms. Sherlock, lost in thought, and John, determined to find out what’s wrong. He knows Sherlock is lying. Sherlock is troubled and it’s about Moriarty. Something he doesn’t want John to know. A threat, most likely, but it isn’t his own safety that Sherlock’s worried about and John is pretty sure he knows who it really is.
Sherlock spins around and tackles Moriarty, grabbing his wrist to keep him from slashing or thrusting with the knife. The smaller man struggles to get the blade close enough to stab Sherlock’s body and escape his grasp.
“No, no,” Sherlock says quickly, suddenly on his feet and yanking the suit jacket from his chair, “it’s a good stopping point.”
“Ha-ha! Way to go, Molly,” John laughs. “So you coached for a bit somewhere else and then Mrs. Hudson hired you?”
“You can’t go back there,” Sherlock tells him abruptly. John’s fixes a glare on him, anger burning dangerously beneath his skin and tinting his cheeks. His mouth is a thin line. He watches Sherlock, biting the inside of his cheek. The coach diplomatically backpedals before John has a chance to speak. “Not tonight anyway. Not until the police look over your apartment and interview the neighbors.”
“Yes, sir,” she replies and steps up to the steering column. The remaining officer takes hold of Moriarty and drags him to the side. Propping him up to sit, he stands next to him to prevent any escape attempt. Not that Moriarty could get away if he tried and he glares across the boat at John and Sherlock.
“I was taking a look at her knee. It was a follow-up visit weeks after to make sure it had healed well. She went very quiet when I asked her how it felt. I knew there was something on her mind, but I didn’t say anything,” he shrugs. ”I knew she would tell me when she was ready.”
Sherlock stares at John without blinking, unsure of what to say or do. Don’t apologize could simply mean that John takes no offense and does not want to dwell on it. Several internal dialogues rapidly play out in his mind and Sherlock ignores them all to concentrate on a decent response instead. He begins to speak, but is not beyond John’s name before he is being manhandled towards the door. His back thuds against the wall with a curse and John’s body is against his, pinning him there. John’s face hovers in front of Sherlock’s, looking uncertain and a little scared, but heated and full of want. Without a word, he presses his lips against Sherlock’s and Sherlock’s mind goes blank.
John turns to face him with an expectant look and Sherlock has a sudden flash of unadulterated panic, but he pushes it aside before he shows. At least, he hopes so.
“I could explain further, but do you really need me to?” Sherlock asked, his eyes flicking to John’s lips again.
Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this one. Uh-oh. I feel myself slipping into Deadpool mode. Take a little time for yourself, friends. Sit down with a cold brew, maybe a good red wine, some bonbons, or maybe just a Kit Kat. Kit Kats are good. Put on some good, soft music and just groove while you read. That's it. And if you find yourself reaching for a unicorn, we'll just keep that to ourselves. Hahahaha!
“You can do that?” John stopped walking in shock. Sherlock stopped a pace ahead and turned to look at the doctor.
Hello, my friends! I’m so sorry to get this one out so late. I didn’t have time to edit yesterday and today has been one of those start, stop and repeat days. In any case, it’s finally here. I hope it finds you all well and safe.
“Damn you, Jane! Why didn’t John tell Sherlock he loves him?! He figured it out, didn’t he? WTF’s the holdup?” Heh heh heh. What indeed.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s body relaxes and he lets out the breath he was holding. “Thank you. Please, come in.”
“Sorry,” Greg cringes. Sherlock rakes his hands through his curls and turns to the GM in abject frustration.
Sherlock closes his fingers around John’s elbow and fixes him with an earnest gaze. The next words out of his mouth are nearly ‘I love you’ and thank god, he doesn’t say them. Nothing in the world would be more awkward and John would have bolted like a frightened rabbit.
Sherlock blinks, now utterly confounded. He is about to ask John what the hell he is talking about when he finally notices what John is wearing. Sherlock typically sees everything one has to tell in a glimpse, but the combination of the doctor’s odd behavior and the effect John has on him in general, much as Sherlock hates to admit it, renders his powers of observation moot. Finally observing everything John has to tell, Sherlock finds himself astounded and more than a little confused.
John is in the kitchen, lingering around until his tea is done. He glances toward the sitting room and is reminded that today is a break day. Craning his neck to listen, he catches a word here and there in different voices. Sherlock must be watching telly. Removing the bag from his mug, he sets off, glancing at Sherlock as he walks through. He stops as soon as he is out of the room and blinks in confusion. He slowly turns his head back toward the doorway and stops again, looking back into the room. Sherlock has either not noticed or is ignoring him. Truly unable to help himself, John walks back in and stands behind the sofa, sipping his tea. Sherlock is slouched down in the chair and only his curls are visible from the back. John watches the screen for a moment. He sips from his mug again.
Thank you all! Thank you so much for reading every word, for loving it and sending comments and love. You all mean the world to me. You inspire me to keep writing and sharing. Thank you for that, every one. You are my life blood.
“Exactly,” Greg says emphatically, pointing a finger. He turns to John suddenly. “And we need to keep you safe.”
3) Will John delay telling him anything and, if so, will there be another accident to push John along?
“Get out,” Sherlock growls. His voice is so low John can scarcely hear him and when he does, those two words tip the scale. John bends forward slightly cupping his ear.
Later that night, Sherlock wakes to find John missing. He rubs his eyes and runs a hand through his curls, looking around the room.
“You’re right,” John said suddenly, his mouth curving up. He looked back at Jim and clapped a hand on his shoulder. “It is fine.”
“The home I grew up in was full of love. It was bright and airy. So was Molly’s. It just doesn’t seem right to have one all to myself.”
“Great. I’ll drive and you pick the place. I don’t know enough about the city yet to find something suitable.
They gaze at one another wordlessly, but a thousand words pass between them silently. John’s heart beats faster, thrumming in his ears, which the monitor reveals cheerfully. Damn machine. He resists the urge to roll his eyes and keeps his attention on Sherlock. He doesn’t remember this man, but knows his voice. He hears it in his mind and in his sleep. It helps him, comforts him, shows him the way. Now, as John sits face to face with the man it belongs to, he feels comfortable and safe. Everything he doesn’t know, all the black panes of glass, none of it seems to matter when he is with this man.
“With myself,” John rushes to say and continues in a decisive tone. “Not with you. I didn’t mean to give the impression that I wanted to disassociate myself from you.”
The remainder of the Christmas holiday goes without incident. As the new year approaches, John tries to put Christmas eve out of his mind and move on. If having Sherlock as his friend, his best friend, is the only way he can have him, John will gladly accept. However, his brain has other ideas as Christmas is still front and center in his thoughts. He has barely kept himself from mentioning it to Sherlock in the days that followed AND it has not escaped his notice that Sherlock seems to have no interest in discussing it. It is New Year’s Eve, only seven days later and John feels as if he is going mad.
Oh my god, friends, am I using my powers for good? Am I?? I don't even know what to say about this one and I don't want to give anything away, like I haven't already. Ha!
Sherlock looks at him with admiration as John’s hand slowly strokes up and down Sherlock’s back beneath the covers, his fingertips grazing that supple ass when his hand is low.
It is cold, a shock to his system and a single, quick shudder vibrates through his body. The weights around his waist and ankles drag him down immediately. He looks up to watch the water’s surface and its light pull away fast. He desperately wants to struggle and thrash his body in an effort to escape, panic clawing at his mind, but he does not. He resists the urge because it will only waste his energy and what little air he has in his lungs. Instead, he moves his hands as steadily as he did on The Crown. The ropes are looser, but not enough to pull a hand through. It will be harder to slip free now that they are wet. It will take more time to work the ropes enough for that, too much time and John is very concerned about sinking to a depth he cannot swim back from before his lungs give out. Even once his hands are free, there are ropes and weights to consider. As if that wasn’t enough, a sudden spasm of pain shoots down his side from the gunshot wound and it is all he can do not to gasp. John clenches his lips, rolling them in on one another to form a seal and looking back to the rapidly vanishing surface again. He doesn’t have a chance.
John’s brows raise as he blinks in disbelief. He leans back on the couch for the first time since he sat. He turns everything around and around in his mind, trying to put it all together in a way that makes sense. Who would target the Rock City players and their doctor, especially their doctor? Another team? Why? The answer is obvious. To be on top. To win the championship. But why Billy? Why not Sherlock? He rebuilt the team from the ground up.
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
“The pain, the torture I endured in those two years, physically and psychologically, was nothing  compared to what I felt being away from you. Mycroft watched you, gave me updates, so it would be more bearable. He didn’t mention Mary. I only found out about her when I came back. I watched you marry her and never said a word because I wanted you to be happy. I would do anything for you, John. It has always been you. You have my heart.”
“Molly and I used to walk to the library in the snow after school to look at journals and magazines,” Sherlock says after the server has gone. He pops a ravioli into his mouth, his eyes sparkling. “We learned all about bearings and wheels and the tools we would need to make adjustments. Then Molly came up with shoveling driveways and using the profits to buy what we needed to be real professionals. Or, at least, what the minds children thought professionals would need. We weren’t far off though.”
Jam - or round. Each jam lasts a maximum of two minutes, if the lead jammer does not call it off. Blockers and jammers may be swapped out in between each jam.
Jim glanced at Moran as he nodded in agreement. John stared straight ahead, not even seeing them anymore. His own words ringing in his ears. ‘Already moved on’. John had to keep a certain consulting detective from moving on and that meant he needed to get the fuck out of here now.
“Let me take him to the deck below,” he says to the officer. “There are no weapons down there and we won’t try to escape. Please. He needs to warm up.”
4. And the one question burning in everyone's mind... Just WHAT was John going to say after "But now"?? Oooo, oooo, a shiver runs down my spine just thinking of THAT one.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes and this is Dr. John Watson,” he informs everyone in a firm, commanding tone. “He needs medical attention immediately.”
Their server suddenly appears, earning him a glare from Sherlock. But he bites his tongue and hands the young man his picked-over salad. Sherlock finds himself excited to continue, which is odd because he doesn’t usually offer information about himself to others. This whole conversation is odd. It is like talking to Molly, only different somehow. He cannot quite put his finger on it. It is certainly just as comfortable as talking to her.
Thanks so much for all the love and support. You all mean the world to me. I couldn't have made it this far without you.
Some of these questions and many others will be answered in the next chapter of Knickerbocker's Yolanda the Famous Chicken. Tune into the same bat time, same bat channel.
A loud voice echoes through the stadium and pulls him from his thoughts. Sherlock’s eyes fly open to see the skaters loitering around the track and drinking from their water bottles. The music was turned off after the last workout rotation and no longer blares across the track, marking the beginning of drills. Sherlock typically leads the drills and scrimmages, but the ladies are more than capable of regulating themselves when he is pulled away. Or delves too far into his mind palace, as the case may be.
“Oh, come on,” Greg barks as he stands to his full height. “How long have we worked together? Too long for this bullshit.”
Our next chapter returns us to Greg and Sherlock, now working alone to find John. But don't count out Mycroft and Molly completely. We know Mycroft will never pay any mind to a word Sherlock has to say and Molly certainly won't give up looking for John either. Hopefully, they won't get in each other's way.
Also, on a purely ridiculous note, I just noticed when I was looking the title that the abbreviation is KFC with an extra letter. Lol. Now I feel the need to come up with other words to replace the real ones, like Keep Your Fried Chicken or KY for Comfort. Bwahaha! That’s a good one, if I do say so myself. Sorry. Sometimes I really am still 15 years old. Like when I chuckle every time I hear the movie title “Pacific Rim”. Heehee. I really am very mature, but I do have that Deadpool side too.)
“It’s unbelievable,” he sighs and turns his eyes to Sherlock. “I just can’t believe it. She was so small and...and now she’s such a wonderful, outspoken girl. And you… It’s all down to you.”
As my very own PatPrecieux pointed out, how the hell does Moriarty always seem to know where John is?
“That, Mrs. Hudson, is a boldfaced lie,” Sherlock snaps, “but if you’d like to hear my objections to this farce at full volume I will be happy to accommodate.”
I do hope this chapter has found you all well and safe. My thoughts are always with all of you. I cherish every one.
“Why haven’t you bought a house? You’ve been here a long time,” John asks, referring to their previous conversation, clearly trying to distract himself.
Sorry, my friends, I have little to no time to add something to the end. I just finished editing this and HAD to post.
“I know a restaurant not far from here,” Sherlock replied quickly and decisively. “It’s open late and I know the owner.”
Now I'm feeling the more Deadpool side of my personality coming out. I'm starting to feel like I should have a name for all of you like Lady Gaga does with her little monsters or whatever she calls her fans. Any suggestions? Perhaps true DP style - Dirty Little Unicorns? Lol. Or maybe something simple like Peaches. That's a real gangster name, that is. Forget Bugsy and Baby Face, my Peaches are the biggest badasses. Bahahaha! This is too much fun.
Rosie started primary school this year. She spent the whole ride back to Baker Street telling Sherlock all about her first day and ran up to her room the moment they were home to do it all over again for her photos of John that cover her chest of drawers. Sherlock cried that night after she was asleep. When the weekend came, Rosie and Sherlock made the trek to John’s bedside and she told him yet again. She included other details of the week and showed him all of her drawings and projects. Sherlock nearly cried again, feeling an overwhelming guilt at his decision to bring her for visits on only weekends now that her days were full of school. Fortunately, Rosie did not make a fuss when he told her. She has always been a very reasonable and thoughtful child, nothing like Sherlock when he was a boy. He decided long ago it must be a reflection of John’s personality.
I know what you’re thinking. “Awwwwww, Jane, thank you. Thank you. We finally got the happy ending we’ve craved for so long.”
So, our duo has been separated. Sherlock is back home in Detroit and John is still in Baltimore. Remembering the last chapter’s questions, is Sherlock right to be worried about John? Are he and Janine safe? Like I’ve said before, only one way to find out.
I said it all at the beginning, but I will again. Thank you all for being with me as I edited and posted my way through this. Your love and support means the world to me. All of you are my treasured friends on and after this journey. This story has a special place in my heart for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is meeting my lovely beta, MyBreadAndButter. Thank you, my friend. You have help me shape this story and my craft into something truly great. I look forward to working with you, and to seeing all of you again, which leads me to...Questions Time?
The skin beneath Sherlock’s eyes contracted slightly as he looked at John thoughtfully. The doctor could tell there were a myriad of questions turning circles in his mind and he was trying to pick one to start with. Rather than wait for it, John decided to counter with one of his own. One that was much on his mind at the moment.
“A partner,” Sherlock replied just as tentatively and brushed his fingers delicately over John’s in an unmistakable gesture.
Well, there may not be as many DP questions at the end of this one because it was a rather peaceful departure from the madness of my (as it would seem) usual chapter. Although, I maintain that if you go back you will discover more non-violent chapters than you expect. They just aren't as memorable. I swear I remember this work having more sex in it that it has had to this point. Arg! I will admit that I did cut one for sure. I remember reading it while editing and thinking, "No. No, they wouldn't do that here. Not now." So, I apologize, but if I'd left it in you would have been saying the same thing.
They had moved in closer again, seemingly unable to be apart for any length of time. They were not pressed together like the other people around them, but John’s hands rested comfortably around Sherlock’s waist and Sherlock’s fingers were wrapped around John’s biceps in a tender embrace. Their steps had turned into something more like a mere shuffling of feet as the great detective spoke quietly and John laughed or did double-takes. Everything about it was delicious and there was not a thought in John’s head that was not about this man.
And there it is! AAHHHHHH!! What an ending, eh? Poor tortured Sherlock. And John. What a tangled web I weave!
“Sherlock,” John sighs, “when you woke in hospital the first thing you said was that Moriarty purposefully failed to kill you. That he’s trying to make a point.”
“John!” Sherlock bolts forward to grab John’s hands. The police voice barks orders for him to stand still, but he ignores it and helps John into the boat.
John purses his lips and shifts his weight. His hands rest on his hips and he looks at his colleague skeptically.
Another song began that was one of John’s favorites and he let out a hoot as the faster beat took hold of his body. He switched his weight from one foot to the other, turning his body to match, sometimes twice in the same direction before changing.
John stared at him, eyes shining with unanswered questions. The smirk he got and the tilt of the man’s head, curls bouncing in the direction down the bar. Greg. Of course, Greg. He must have told this mysterious man John’s name. The doctor tilted his head as well, unable to look away from that angular face now framed by soft, dark curls as their owner tilted his head upright again. Suddenly John’s heart skipped a beat as his mind caught up with the conversation. Did that mean this dazzling beauty had asked Greg about him?
Meanwhile, Sherlock finds himself completely mystified by his flatmate. In defiance of all logic and belief, the mind of the Great Sherlock Holmes is SILENT. His only thoughts are of John. He wants to know everything. Every part of John’s body - touching, tasting, smelling, listening. Will John cry out at orgasm? Will he say Sherlock’s name? Will he curse? Likely, given his propensity to swear. Sherlock wants data and yet, cannot be troubled with it. He’s so swept up that all he wants is John. Not to think or reason or analyze. Just John.
“No one should ever keep you waiting, John,” Sherlock said with conviction. John tucked his chin, turning his head slightly, but kept his eyes on Sherlock. A crease formed on his forehead and his brow furrowed as he tried to wrap his head around this man. He clearly knew far more about John than John did of him, either from Greg or his own deductions. It was also clear that he was very keen on spending more time with John. The doctor was both dumbfounded and thrilled by this knowledge.
A burst of laughter popped from John’s mouth before he could stop himself. It was so loud that he quickly pressed his lips together again and glanced toward the man for fear of drawing too much attention and giving them away. He need not have worried. The club was far too noisy for anyone to notice. Sherlock smirked, his eyes bright with amusement.
“Oh, you didn’t, did you? But you’re more than willing to throw it in my face when it finally comes to a head. Fucking hypocrite.”
One short disclaimer: I fully admit that I'm taking certain liberties with the reality of waking from a long-term coma. I have made some aspects very realistic and others not so much. Artistic license.
“It’s all right,” John tells him, eyes half-lidded with weariness. “The bullet just grazed me. It’s only a flesh wound.”
There is a long silence. Sherlock is just beginning to think he should have kept his mouth shut when John’s lips turn up at the ends. It is a subtle movement, one he almost did not detect, but it is there nonetheless. John places his hand over Sherlock’s where it still rests on his knee. Sherlock’s stomach flips and his brows bounce up to reach the curls on his forehead.
And poor Mycroft, right? I think it's safe to say that I haven't been entirely fair to him. Always distancing him from everyone else and from his own feelings, so cold and calculating. I've hinted at his emotions and we all know he cares deeply for Sherlock. Why else would he devote himself to Sherlock's protection? But here, we finally see a bit of his perspective. We finally see that he understands how important it is that John and Sherlock be together, how perfect they are for each other. Not only does their little domestic sadden him, but he must be terribly conflicted knowing that he will be complicit in John's eventual capture.
“Can’t really blame her, love,” Clara Hell on Wheels teases with a flirtatious grin and a glance at HardOn’s posterior.
“Somehow, in all the bouts we’d watched, I never deduced that all female teams meant it was a women’s only sport,” Sherlock pauses thoughtfully and marvels at how caught up John is. He has never had such an attentive audience and his damn stomach flips again. “I told Molly as soon as I got home.”
“I don’t have a boyfriend,” John shrugged as he casually took a step closer. Sherlock’s eyes widened and his brows furrowed in confusion.
“It’ll be fine,” Sherlock protests while nodding in answer to the question. “They aren’t juvenile delinquents.”
“You’re very tired, aren’t you?” Sherlock interrupts forcefully. His voice is gentle and he ghosts his fingers over John’s hand. Where John first looked hurt, he now looks calm. He extends his fingers to touch Sherlock and the detective takes his hand. “I’ll stay until you fall asleep and I will be back tomorrow. As soon as I get Rosie to school, I promise.”
“John? John, wait!” Sherlock calls from the top of the stairs, but John just slams out of the building and hails a cab as he steps quickly toward the street. It takes a moment for a cab to stop. Long enough that the building’s door opens and Sherlock emerges. Not wanting to hear what Sherlock has to say and not wanting to argue about where he’s going, John climbs in the cab and gives the driver quick orders. It starts off just as Sherlock dashes out onto the sidewalk. “John!”
Sherlock keeps his icy gaze on the older woman, pointedly ignoring Greg. Mrs. Hudson herself just looks at them both fondly. She has never made a secret of the fact that she views them as the sons she never had. Greg holds the place of firstborn - polite, responsible, authoritative. Sherlock is the little brother who will always be quietly satisfied that he is taller. He is just as responsible and an excellent coach, but is also petulant, disagreeable and a bit of a shit. Both men are friendly and talented and won over Mrs. Hudson nearly the moment she met them. Martha is nothing if not an excellent judge of character. It’s like a sixth sense and she prides herself on it, so how she failed to notice Anderson’s complete lack of ethics is beyond her.
The feels! Writing the conversation between John and Sherlock in the hospital room nearly killed me, y'all. It made me so sad to think of these two in so much pain. When I read through and edited "Sherlock's lip quivers" just a few minutes ago, mine was doing the same. Oh, my poor boys.
In the meantime, enjoy the chapter. I do hope it brings you a few moments of solace in these bizarre times.
The Woman plunges her lanky body into the triangle of Ravens blockers nearly slipping between them right off the line, but the skater acting as the head of the trio closes the gap and prevents her escape from the pack. Face to face, they snarl at each other as The Woman gives a good push and then hops to the right on her toe stops, lunging forward and pumping her legs. Not to be undone, the trio moves with her, still in triangle formation. They tighten the iron grip on one another’s shoulders to stay together as they move. The skater closest to the outer side of the track shoves The Woman with her ass in an attempt to knock her out of bounds. The Woman sees it instantly and twirls to keep her skates inside the line, circumnavigating around that ass and cutting to the left, only to meet the fourth blocker in the pack. Hungry to break through, she continues to hop and push at the blockers.
WTF, Jane?! Seriously. WAT THE FUCK! What is that? You didn't answer any questions. You just threw everyone off a fucking cliff. (OMG. I can actually hear Ryan Reynolds saying this in my head.) And that thing with Mary? Is that her name? What the fuck is that? There's something a wrong about her. She did what, just stayed in the closet listening? Twice! Yeah, that's just kinky, you know what I mean. But I guess she called in the good guys in the end. But no, don't trust her. And that pompous douche bag, Mycroft? Ha ha! He's gonna have to get wet. Ready for a little swim, Mycroft? (uncontrollable giggling)
“Hello, John,” a deep baritone, all dark chocolate and velvet rumbled from the man’s chest. John’s lips parted and he nearly gasped, but swallowed it down along with his surprise. How the hell did this man, with perfect cupid’s bow lips, know his name? “I’ve seen you here before. We have a friend in common.”
“We’ll get you to the hospital once we reach the marina,” Sherlock informs him, leaving no room for question. He is well aware of the fact that John Watson does not like to be told what to do, but he doesn’t give a damn right now. John looks up at him with a scowl on his face, but does not protest. “Stay here. I’ll get something to slow the bleeding.”
The sex holiday begins!! I don't know about all of you, but I'm excited! Yippee!! Not only are these parts perhaps The most fun to write, they are a lot of fun to edit too. Oh yeah.
Sherlock just cocked a brow, his expression screaming ‘Come now, John, don’t be dull’. A smile broke over John’s lips and he tucked his chin down with a quiet self-deprecating laugh. When he looked up again, Sherlock’s amusement was easily apparent and he had taken a step closer.
“No offense, Billy, you know him better than I, but why would he believe me? He doesn’t believe Molly.”
“Do you have a friend like that?” Sherlock asks and then wonders if it was wise when John looks at him with shining eyes.
“She’s right, you know,” Greg says just as Sherlock’s fingers reach the knob. The coach drops his hand and looks at the ceiling.
“What?” John huffs a startled laugh. “No. That isn’t what I meant at all. Look, I know I left abruptly.”
“Sir!” calls a man from the police boat. He had been directing other boats to the marina to be questioned as witnesses when something caught his eye. “There’s another one in the water over here. We’re pulling him out now.”
* Holy shit. Where DID Sherlock learn to fight like that?? (It's a bit like I felt while watching S4 and Sherlock kicked ass not only in the flat, but in that swimming pool at that guy's house. I think it was episode 1. It was like being Dr. Strange rubbed off in more ways than just bigger muscles to fill out his *ehhem* entirely new Sherlock wardrobe because his previous little Sherlock garb was too small for him and said muscles. My eyes are popping here.)
His mouth watering and cock twitching with interest, John leapt into the perfect accompaniment to Sherlock’s sultry moves as another voice began to sound.
“As are you,” Sherlock stated. He rested both elbows on the bar and laced his fingers in between, a calculating edge to his gaze. “You’re here alone.”
There are so many more questions, please feel free to pose them all. I can't promise I'll answer, but I'll certainly lead you along in my own humorous and snarky way.
“Right about the time I went to uni, he graduated and joined the army. We were in contact all through med school and basic training. We found weekends to meet up here and there. I could tell him anything,” John smiles wistfully, but it fades from his face and Sherlock finds himself dreading John’s next words. “I thought about joining up once I was done with school. Figured they’d be happy to have a ‘brilliant’ army doctor.”
Fear flashes across Sherlock’s features and a chill runs down his neck, spreading into his veins until he can feel it in his fingertips. Did he just profess love for John? No. He tries to deny it, but the proof of it appears around every corner he turns within his mind palace.
“Ten seconds!” the timer shouts and all ten women on the track bend their knees and straighten their spines. The whole stadium vibrates with energy, fans for both teams stomping and shouting. The whistle blows as the timer drops her arm from where it was held aloft and the track springs to life.
* So things are kind of normal between the duo, but when will John TALK TO SHERLOCK?!?!?! You know it's all just festering right now. Will it blow John's top at some point or will he broach the subject rationally?
“Molly is my family. I will place myself in the line of fire to protect her every time. You know that. Failure means the murderer will try again. And she isn’t the only target. So are you. I cannot allow that.”
And another chapter is in the books! I hope you all enjoyed it. The next one is already edited and will be up soon. Yay!
“No,” Sherlock replies after a moment. “Not his style. We lived in an upscale apartment downtown. It was right where he needed to be, both for his work and social life.”
fit that bill. To make matters worse, he never understood my relationship with Molly and hated our marathon phone calls once a week. We divorced a year after graduation.”
“You’re amazing,” John uttered with nothing less than awe. That was not quite what he had meant to say. Then again, what had he intended upon saying? John pulled back, biting his bottom lip in embarrassment, unsure of how to explain that one away. Sherlock’s cool eyes looked back at him without a hint of reproach as a deep, melodic voice boomed over the floor.
“On local channels. Nation-wide during the championship,” Sherlock chuckles at John’s wrinkled brow. “Don’t worry if you’ve never noticed. It’s rather eclipsed by the Stanley Cup playoffs, but it pulls in decent viewership.”
“His memory loss is substantial?” Sherlock phrases it in a question to make her feel more comfortable telling him. It seems to work as a bit of the tension visibly drains from her body.
Striding up to the house, he takes in its white siding and dark green shutters. Many of the windows have boxes containing bright red poppies and small daisies. It’s like it was pulled right from Wizard of Oz and deposited in a Detroit suburb. John steps onto the porch where there is a single wicker chair sitting just to the left of the door and suddenly visions of the stereotypical old man perched on his porch with a shotgun, yelling at children to get the fuck off his lawn pop into his mind. A small smile teases at the corners of his mouth as he directs his attention to the door again and hesitates before knocking. He has no idea what to expect from this man. John glances at the chair again and then knocks firmly. The door opens almost immediately to reveal a man with greying hair and a smile that lights up his whole face. He looks almost joyful. And the epitome of Mr. Rogers, tan cardigan and all.
Still he tries, tearing at Moriarty’s flesh and grappling desperately for the upper hand or leverage or anything that will help. Even as he struggles for his own life, his mind turns to thoughts of John. Alone in the water, in the dark, dying. Sherlock’s lungs are just beginning to burn for lack of oxygen. John has been underwater for thirty seconds. How long can John hold his breath before his lungs inhale involuntarily in search of air only to fill with water?
“This will help,” he tells him in a quiet voice. John simply nods in response and sits up more, blankets falling away to rest on his lap. He takes the cup in his hands and breathes in the steam. He exhales slowly, the scent of chamomile easing his nerves.
“No,” he answers plainly, averting his eyes to the table for a moment. “I retired and moved on. That’s what whoever did it wanted and I’m too old to deal with that shit.”
“D’you think they are connected?” Greg asks them. They look at him and then one another. Neither looks completely certain, as if each wants to say yes, but just cannot be sure. They need more data, as Sherlock would say.
“I didn’t miss much,” John amends and takes a quick drink of water. His eyes are shifty and he looks away pointedly. That is absolutely not what he was going to say and Sherlock knows it. And John knows he knows it.
“Greg insisted,” Sherlock shrugs in reply and then his eyes soften. He tilts his head as he watches John wobble and begin to pitch over. Sherlock grabs him quickly to prevent his fall and wraps an arm around his shoulders, leaning John against the side of his body.
Tightening his jaw, John tries to concentrate on whatever it is he and Greg are standing on instead. It can’t be the lake floor. It would be softer with sand or mud. He looks down, but the sting of the water at this depth forces him to close his eyes. He can feel a pull on the belt of weights he wears and then it falls away. Next are the ropes and weights around his ankles. At first, John wonders at Greg’s speed and accuracy. Then he remembers that Greg is wearing goggles and has a torch. Of course he can see what he’s doing and thank the fuck for that. The man came prepared. Goddamn, Sherlock must have expected all of this. That’s why he stayed on his boat and didn’t come closer to them. He had Greg beneath to save John once he was out of harm’s way, leaving Sherlock behind alone.
“Did you notice it happening more or less during a certain part of the season? Or in certain places?”
Sherlock squats and opens the cabinet beneath the sink. He pulls out a mid-sized sand pail. It bears the image of the Grinch from the 2018 remake. Molly had begged Sherlock to go with her and they gave him the bucket as soon as he entered the theater. It was some promotional thing and he was the umpteenth person. Dull. He would have refused had they not filled it with popcorn. Sherlock could eat his weight in popcorn.
“Behavior,” Sherlock tells him. “You are very independent and driven. You may work well with others, but have set ways of doing things. You speak of your parents fondly, but not of siblings.” He pauses, the corners of his mouth turning up and a mischievous gleam in his eye. “I’m not wrong.”
Now, a little of what you all love best about me - a chapter and a little craziness, maybe a little snarkiness, maybe a little of column A and a little of column B. Or maybe I'll save that for the end. Haha. Anyway, so John has a little more information from the good Dr. Wiggins, but what will he do with it? There's a lot to weigh in on and a lot to do. Getting to know the skaters and staffers is number one on his list.
Until next time, my friends. Keep your stick on the ice. (I watched a most excellent winter classic from 2008. They went into double OT and the penguins won on the stick of Crosby in a shootout! My god, it was fantastic!) We're all in this together.
YIKES, what a chapter! The blocked number, the roof, John watching from the ground..anybody fear the Reichenbach? I know you're out there.
“They have been involved for quite some time. You can see it,” he muttered. The soft wisp of his breath made John shiver and he turned to face him, their faces dangerously close.
* Wait a minute. KC and the patriots? JaneOFCakes, the Empress of Evil, watches football on Sunday nights?? (You bet your ass I do and, if you ask nicely, I'll tell you my two favorite teams and the two I hate the most. I am a woman with many hobbies.)
We have emerged on the other side. How ya feelin'? Did you think I was going to end it? Oh, no no, my friends, not yet. There are still so many questions to answer. So many lose ends to tie up. So much sex to be had and, apparently, there is a following among you that wants John to do more ass worshipping.
Sorry for the super serious notes when mine are usually somewhat humorous, but I just can't see making jokes just now. This is certainly a downturn in the story, but things will look up again. Highs and lows, up and downs...Persistence.
Greg lets out a huff of breath with a quiet laugh dancing around its edges and Sherlock joins with a small smile. A moment later, he opens the door to leave and Greg briefly stops him again.
When John’s eyes came to rest on him again, he blinked and blinked again in shock. That man, that gorgeous man with legs a mile long and cheekbones sharp enough to cut yourself with was absolutely
“Would you take a look?” she sways her hips and her breasts move with them. She continues in a low, sultry voice. “You can...touch them if you want. In fact, I think you’d better give me a full body examination.”
Sherlock raises his arms slowly, fingers splayed wide, arms bent at the elbow. He lifts his eyes to meet Moriarty’s and curls his lips into a self-satisfied smirk. That seemingly innocuous splash of water, not at all the same as the natural movement of the lake against the boat, is all he needs to hear. Moriarty grins up at Sherlock with cruel amusement, but falters as Sherlock’s expression grows more smug.
