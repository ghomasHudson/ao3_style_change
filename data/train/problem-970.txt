He said, almost irritably, ‘You love him, John.’
Later, he puts the dogtags back in his drawer. It's months before he looks at them again. He’s digging through the drawer, looking for something else, when his eye catches them. There are three again. Frowning, he takes them out. Sherlock’s is back. But his name is no longer alone, and the dates are gone. It simply says:
‘She didn’t strike me as the type for romantic fancies.’ I said evenly. ‘I can’t think of any reason you, as Escott, would have deliberately given her that impression.’
The man himself chose that moment to slam into the room, and our client broke off with a jump. He had finished his toilette, and looked every inch the perfect gentleman. His finely tailored black frock coat flowed elegantly over his silk embroidered waistcoat and cravat, and he had finally arranged his hair into its usual slicked back formal style, which as ever, gave his aquiline face its slightly severe look.
I sighed. ‘As I am sure you have already deduced-‘
I said resignedly, ‘He isn’t heartless. He just isn’t interested in love. Of any kind.’
I froze.
With him here, so close, I couldn't remember my rehearsed words, and others rushed out. ‘You saved my life. Without you, I would not have survived those first years after Afghanistan. James is a good man, and a friend. But he is not….you. My life has been yours since that day at Barts and I would not change a moment of it.' I saw uncertainty still in those clear, grey eyes, and I gripped him tighter. ‘Not one moment.' My own voice was unsteady now, I wanted so desperately for him to believe me. He looked at me, still uncertain, but beginning to hope. This close I could see his eyes were misty. He said, wonderingly, ‘Truly?' It was barely a whisper, but it was enough. I pulled him to me, holding him close against my chest, and moving my hands in comforting circles on his back. I said, voice raw, ‘Yes.'
. And his vulnerability had been laid bare in front of this young woman. I felt a weight in my chest. All my brief irritation had long vanished, replaced by a desire to have him home, where he was wanted, and yes, loved.
I threw him a look and he flashed me a smile. Even in my confusion I felt a sudden rush of gratitude.
‘Well he need hardly be a detective to track you down here.’ Holmes said mildly. ‘He need only read the Strand.’
‘It’s concern, it’s affection, it’s –,’ I couldn’t say the word. What if they were wrong? I crossed the room, intending to take him in my arms, to show him my meaning.
He flashed a quick smile at that, and there was, I fancied, some genuine relief in it. Holmes is not, as I have stated, a cruel man. ‘I am gratified to hear it. Young Harry Anstruther, I hope, and not that dreadful Stokes?’
Mrs Hudson drew herself up and said with icy distain, ‘That is a matter of opinion and I have my instructions.’
‘Goodnight, Mrs Hudson.' I looked after her retreating figure fondly, before mounting the stairs. The door to our sitting room was closed and I'm ashamed to admit I hesitated in front of it for some moments, before seizing the handle and entering the room, closing it again behind me.
I moved across to my desk, retrieving the paper from the couch as I went, and took out my notepad, lest the affair be of interest. Lestrade entered, and at the look on Holmes’ face, launched into the details of the case without preamble. After ten minutes Holmes raised his hand and Lestrade stammered to a halt. Without a word, Holmes crossed the room, swept up the paper from my desk and thrust it at the confused Detective Inspector.
He is at my side in an instant. ‘Is something wrong? What is it? Tell me.’ He is beside me now on the settee. He has seized my wrist to take my pulse again. His solicitation makes something tighten in my chest. I stare into his grey eyes, so close to mine in his concern, and I am suddenly overwhelmed with emotion I can’t quite name. I seize his hands in mine.
‘Watson, try to imagine the tonnage of things you cannot conceive of,’ he snapped. It was a deliberate barb and a poor one. I ignored it.
‘Holmes,’ I kept my voice down, certain that there was at least one person in the house abed at this hour. ‘Couldn’t you sleep?’ I had left my coat and scarf in the hall, so the warmth of the banked fire was very welcome. I sank into my chair with relief.
'I'm gratified by your respect for my medical skills. I'm only sorry it doesn't extend to a respect for my feelings. Or any consideration of them at all, in fact.'
She turned to face me then, holding my hand. ‘He needs you, Doctor. I know how difficult he can be, and so soon after that terrible time too, but oh, he was so miserable after you left last night Doctor, I was worried, and he's not eaten, you know....' the flow of words came to a stop and I pressed her hand reassuringly, touched anew by her concern for Holmes.
I couldn’t meet his gaze. ‘That my love for you was more than friendship.’
For my own part, I had never allowed myself to even consider a physical relationship with Holmes. From the moment I realised I found him attractive, I had stamped on any manifestation of that thought occurring again. Bad enough that I should be unable to conceal my great affection for him. Worse that he should read from me such thoughts as would have us both arrested and jailed. His friendship was far too valuable to risk with such indulgence.
John thinks it’s a little bit disconcerting, this new considerate version of Sherlock that’s appeared since Mary's death. Considerate is a relative term, obviously, but the concept of him thinking before he just blurts out whatever he’s deduced, is strange. John isn’t entirely sure he likes it.
He stopped, returned to the settee, and sat down again. He looked as if all life had been suddenly drained from him. I remembered his black moods in the wake of the Milverton case, and couldn’t find it in my heart to remonstrate with him any further.
He takes a breath. ‘I will try. God, I swear I will try, but promise me you won’t do this again. Watson. Promise me now.’
‘Holmes,’ I said carefully, ‘I don’t think you should take up poker either.’
‘On page four,’ Holmes was saying to Lestrade, ‘you will find the details of some financial irregularity that has recently been uncovered at a London bank. I would begin your investigation there.’
‘I don’t belong on there. It’s not the same.
Then he’s stepping right into Sherlock’s space, he can feel the warmth of his body, his breath, and the whole thing is as serious as a goddamn heart attack. Right up to the moment their lips meet he’s expecting Sherlock to pull away, so it’s a jolt when his mouth is suddenly warm against John’s. John can feel his heart beating like he’s running a sprint, he’s hyperaware of everything, and the world is spinning around him, but Sherlock isn’t reacting at all, he’s just letting himself be kissed, and John stops, draws back and looks at him.
‘Fine, I am. We done?’
He stomped back into his room. ‘It’s not the start I’m concerned about, it’s the middle and the end. The man couldn’t play a decent cadenza....’ the rest of the statement was lost behind the closing door, and the slamming of what I hoped was a jar of pomade on the surface of his dressing table.
And so we passed a number of pleasant evenings, our talk no more intimate than newly reacquainted colleagues, until Holmes became ill.
I nod. ‘I promise. I promise.’ I try to rest my forehead against his, but he pulls away slightly to raise his hand to my face, lifting my chin to examine my pupils again.  His other hand is still clasped against my chest and I find I have no desire to let go.
He glared at me then, looking almost betrayed, and a memory of another recent argument surfaced between us. He dropped his gaze and his shoulders slumped.
The momentary horror seized me that he could read my thoughts, but I felt my recovery was impressively fast. ‘Good afternoon, Detective Inspector,’ I answered with a smile. ‘Are you here to see to Mr Holmes?’
‘Yes.’
‘A fool, and a coward.’ Even through my sleep addled haze I could hear the unhappiness in his tone. ‘We have had this,’ and here he tightened his arm around my shoulder, ‘years ago.’
His voice was hoarse as he said, ‘I’m sorry. I cannot…regulate my responses.’
He said, into the horrified silence. ‘I can’t, Watson, don’t ask me to…’
‘Drink it.'
John. My name. To hear it in his voice is so rare, and so lovely, I almost forget my next words. I take his hands again.
He was staring at me and his face was almost blank. In sudden alarm, I whispered, ‘Sherlock. Are you alright?’
She reached the top, flushed and panting. ‘There’s a young man, Doctor, says it’s urgent.’
I turned back to our client, who had gone a little pale, and attempted to reassure her. Silently I dammed my friend for making no attempt to appear any less than thoroughly intimidating.
He says, ‘Oh.’
The medical practitioner in my mind is observing now with interest. My respiration and heart rate have increased. My mood is buoyant. I laugh at nothing. My inhibitions are decreased. I am increasingly sensitive to stimuli.
James said wryly, ‘Quite.’
I felt some tightness leave my chest. I looked up at him then, his face only inches from mine where we sat pressed together on the narrow seat. To this day I don't know who moved first. We were beyond exhaustion, beyond morality, beyond caring. In that shadow world of death and violence, the world of home was too far. His lips touched mine, and I forgot the dead and the dying, and pressed forward into the warmth of his chest, releasing his hand only to slide mine across his back, winding my arms around his surprisingly slight frame.
He shot me a half smile and said carefully, ‘Shall we indulge in some comforting small talk, or would you like to move straight to what brings you here at this slightly unsociable hour?’
He said, that quietly distressed tone back, ‘This cannot come between us. I cannot lose you.’
I stared at her in disbelief.
But I knew what she meant. I had felt it. The evening of my return from Raleigh Street I had held him, to repair our friendship, comfort his distress, and we had never spoken of it since. He had held me like that. Why had I not seen, as she had, the wasteland of physical affection that lay behind that embrace?
‘The girl herself suggested that she would be happy with a letter from Mr Escott, once we found him, assuring her of his wellbeing and happiness, and officially releasing her from their engagement to allow her to marry Mr Anstruther with a clear conscience.’
He sank down onto the settee. I regained my chair, and he looked at me evenly and sighed.
I think if he hadn't used my given name, and pressed my hand, I might have kept my slender control. But as it was, I broke down, weeping like a child over our clasped hands. He took his hand from mine then, and I expected him to move away. Instead he sat next to me on the narrow bench and pulled me to him, wrapping his arm around my shoulders. My grip on his other hand must have hurt, but I couldn't have released him if my life depended on it. He seemed to understand and simply held me, murmuring reassurance.
In my accounting of the cases I shared with my friend, I have occasionally been inexact with dates. This is usually to ensure that no connection with events in the public eye at that time could be made and the anonymity of our clients invaded. In the case of Culverton Smith, however, the reason is simpler. It was only with the remove of time that I could bring myself to write of those events with any degree of equanimity.
She looked at me a little pityingly at that suggestion. ‘Oh, no, sir, that’s not right. He loved, sure as i’m sitting ‘ere, he did. But he loved someone else, someone as ‘e couldn’t ‘ave, an’ it made him so sad, sir.’ She bit her lip.
‘This isn’t funny, Holmes.’
After an uncertain start, the newly intimate aspect of our relationship had not, as I feared, damaged our friendship. In fact it seemed to me to be richer for it, knowing as I did a side to Holmes that had been closed to me before. Holmes himself still sometimes struggled with the vulnerability of our night-time activities for his own part, but he applied himself to my pleasure with the intense single minded dedication he brought to his work. I frequently felt like the focus of one of Holmes’ experiments, but the results were far from unpleasant. If I was to be Holmes’ subject for his explorations in intimacy for the rest of my life, then I would happily resign myself to my fate.
‘We know the details of the case,’ I said. ‘There’s no need to describe that night any further.’
In 1894, after three years in which I believed him dead, Sherlock Holmes returned to me. Scant weeks later found us lodged together once more in Baker Street, and tackling those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so plentifully presents. Not all of these cases have been laid before the public, some due to their sensitive or confidential subject matter, others because their inherent nature renders them unsuitable as a narrative intended primarily for entertainment.
He looked at me with mock affront. ‘I have an extremely active mind.’ He pressed his lips to my palm, which tickled, and I drew my hand back with a huff of laughter. ‘And I’ve been busy all afternoon. If you want quiet, you will have to find a way to distract me.’
‘Holmes has never-‘ I began. Then remembered Holmes’ hand slipping into mine, and said weakly, ‘That’s just…. Holmes.’
I kissed him.
‘Even so, Holmes,’ I began.
.’ John reaches out and takes the tags from Sherlock’s hand, careful to avoid touching him in any way. He folds them tightly into his own hand so there is not even a telltale glimpse of silver. Sherlock stares at his closed fist like he can still see his name.
Sherlock says bluntly, ‘You’re not
He still looked taken aback, but said carefully, 'Watson, I've explained. The deception was necessary to-'
‘What happened to my fiancé, sir. My old fiancé, that is. Harry says as how he was mixed up in the murder, but I can’t believe it, sir, I can’t. But ‘e did vanish you see sir, with no word,’ here her lip trembled slightly, ‘and the master was mixed up with some bad people sir, as we weren’t meant to know, but we did, and it wouldn’t be right sir, for me to just carry on and marry, without knowing what happened to him.’
The situation that greeted me at the Palmer house was one every physician dreads. I had simply been summoned too late. All I could do was make the poor woman more comfortable in her final hours. I stayed as evening wore on and night became morning. I hope that I eased her passing, but there was nothing I could do for the distress of her family as the reality of the situation became clear.
I sighed. ‘Eight days, Holmes, to be precise.’
‘Well, luckily you won’t have to sit through the interview, as you will be enjoying the excellent violin work of Signor Picarello.’
I started. ‘We-‘
Holmes had stood as I did and touched a steadying hand to my arm. ‘You should certainly sleep. You’re exhausted.’
‘Harry was mentioned at frequent intervals, so, yes, I believe him to be the fortunate gentleman.’
Unwilling to upset him further, I murmured, ‘Of course.' I felt a cold hand run down my spine. But if this was to be the end of our friendship, I would face it with all the equanimity I had lacked the previous evening. I drew myself up, and waited.
My heart was hammering and the room felt far too hot as I closed the distance between us.
He grimaced. ‘Hasn’t there always? And one beyond the ken of Scotland Yard, no doubt.’ He sighed with a put upon air. ‘Alright, send him up. Tell him to make it quick.’
I expected him to make a dismissive comment about keeping irregular hours, but instead he held out the brandy and simply said, ‘I was waiting for you.’ The comment did more to warm me than the fire and the brandy combined. I smiled up at his angular face in the firelight and said ‘Thank you.’
‘Indeed,’ he returned a brief smile. ‘The criminals of London give me no rest.’
‘Well,’ I cleared my throat. ‘You will be relieved to hear that, as expected, you were supplanted in her affections very quickly by a rival.’
He said, making an obvious effort to keep his voice steady, ‘Your room will be cold.’
To my surprise, the idea did not seem to cause her distress. ‘I think that might be part of it, sir, yes.  She paused and then said quietly. ‘He did like me, you see, a lot, I think, but…. ‘e didn’t love me.’
He neither moved nor spoke. I couldn’t see his face.
John sighs, debates leaving the room to stop this conversation. He sits on the bed instead. ‘Let’s not pretend you don’t already know, yeah? You just tell me what you’ve deduced, and I’ll fill in any gaps.’
‘It’s late.’ I said. ‘We should both get some sleep.’ I stood too quickly and swayed slightly.
‘You are not so affected.'
Still without taking his eyes from our joined hands, he said, voice slightly hoarse. ‘Did you mean it, Watson? Anything in your power to give. Anything?’
I finished my breakfast with subdued appetite.
‘I’m sorry.’ I said quickly. ‘I should not have spoken. We can forget this conversation ever took place.’
A month later, I was walking home to Baker Street on a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon. My morning’s patient had been well on the road to recovery; lunch at my club had been genial in the extreme, and my mood was buoyant. I knew Holmes had been out all morning, but he had stated his intention to stay at Baker Street this afternoon, and I hoped I would find him at home.
, John.’
I should begin then with a little of my own history. As I have recorded, prior to my first meeting with Holmes, I was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon, and sent to India. By the time I arrived, the second Afghanistan war had broken out, and I followed my regiment to Kandahar. This was my first experience of the horrors of war. I had thought my training as a doctor and surgeon had prepared me for anything that could be done by violence or disease to the human body. Now I can hardly credit my own naiveté. To learn, in such a visceral way, how much pain and trauma the body could take before breaking, and the meagre limits of my own skills to keep body and soul together, was horrifying.
We sat in silence for moment, then he said, ‘So our course is decided.’
He drew me against him and held me so tightly it was almost painful. He said hoarsely, ‘I will not.’
‘Mrs Hudson,' I began.
‘What makes you say that?’
He didn’t reply, and didn’t move. I began to fear that I had overstepped some invisible boundary.  After what felt like an eternity of silence he whispered, ‘That’s the second time you’ve said -.’ He stopped.
Mrs Hudson’s sigh was audible. I continued, ‘Would you care for any refreshment?’ This earned me a disbelieving glare from our landlady.
He says, ‘Sherlock, I’m, er – I'm going to kiss you now.’
He didn’t move or reply, and I felt cold fear grip my heart.
He leapt for the mantelpiece, retrieved the offending item, and straightened his collar. ‘Mrs Hudson has not been our landlady all these years and learned nothing, Watson. She is developing solid instincts.’ He began to fix his collar. ‘Laying aside her ingrained snobbery towards those of a lower social standing, if she believes the case to be unsuitable for us, she is probably correct.’
I had long schooled myself to keep the thought that my affection for Holmes could be more than profound friendship far from my mind. Holmes had made it clear, in many ways, that he had no interest in the softer emotions, and that a physical relationship with the fairer sex would be unwanted and unthinkable. I had always assumed that the same applied to relationships with his own sex. When I had wondered about it at all, I had supposed, given his stated feelings towards the fairer sex, that his affections would run towards his own gender. But since he appeared to have no feelings in that regard towards either sex, the thought had been irrelevant.
‘Thank you sir.’ She sniffed. ‘But the thing is sir, well, Mr Escott – John – I never saw ‘im again. Not after the master died. Which is what made me think he must ‘ave fallen in with a bad lot.’
But I was lost to reason. 'I grieved, Holmes. For years. For you. I was broken.' It was becoming harder to breathe. 'The world was so dark-' I broke off to inhale deeply, trying to gain some control. 'That you could do that to me again, make me believe, even for one night...' I gripped the back of one of the dining chairs and forced my lungs to take in air again. The silence in the room was suffocating.
‘But the child will live?’
So he had agreed with enthusiasm, only to discover that the promised soloist had been replaced with another violinist, who, to quote my friend, ‘presumably only took up the violin because the penny whistle presented too ferocious a challenge’. He was now dressing for the concert with every appearance of reluctance, and only my intervention had stopped him attending in his favourite grey morning suit rather than one of the excellent dress suits he had for such occasions.
There is a pause so long that John thinks Sherlock has wandered off into his memory palace and got lost. When he looks up, Sherlock does look lost, but he’s not in his memory palace, he’s just staring at John, still clutching his shirt.
I said, 'I can't'.
He stared at me, mouth slightly agape and I realised I was seeing James Paulson speechless for the first and only time in my life. I sipped my brandy as I waited for him to recover.
As a raised my eyes again I thought of James, and heard his voice, sad in the firelight. ‘
John says, ‘Sherlock, you okay?’
I stared at him in confusion. ‘What-?’
Still addressing his glass, he said, ‘I’ve read your stories. It’s clear how much you admire him. And he does indeed seem admirable.’ He flicked a glance at me then. ‘But not perhaps the easiest man to live with.’
At that moment Mrs Hudson returned, a picture of upright disapproval, being trailed by a plain young woman whose simple clothes and shy demeanour proclaimed her station to be exactly as Mrs Hudson had indicated.
He sighed. ‘Oh yes. And it is, of course. And I was going to suggest that you get as far from him as possible as quickly as possible. I was going to recommend, in fact, that you come here.’ He looked at me then and I felt a heat rise in my cheeks that was nothing to do with the fire. ‘But,’ he continued, ‘as this paragon of virtue and good behaviour you imagine me to be,’ and here he threw me a wry look, ‘I find I cannot say that.’
‘You were with Mary. You loved Mary.’
He rounded on me then, hoarse and angry. ‘And what exactly is it you think you can do? What are you trying to help me with?’  This almost shouted, ‘I will not be
The room around us felt suddenly cold as I stared at her. Escott would know, surely, that character: the worldly tradesman, he would know.
Holmes could not have looked more shocked if I had stepped forward and slapped him.
I twisted my hands together in my lap. This would not do. I, a former soldier, was as good as hiding in a park, scared to face my dearest friend. I had no desire to leave Baker Street. In the cold light of morning I knew that as clear as my own name. Whilst I had denied James' assertion that I loved Holmes as more than my closest friend, I knew that my feelings were such that losing him again so soon would be a blow from which I would not soon recover. I could only hope that Holmes would forgive my outburst and that we would continue as before. But I could not know his thoughts without returning, and facing whatever justified remonstrations he would feel necessary. Fixed on my course, I left the bench and turned my steps homeward.
He kept his face away from me as he said, ‘Forgive me.’
Holmes looked surprised. ‘And you would be content with such a course?’
He gave a bark of bitter laughter. ‘I flatter myself Watson, that I am not usually transparent.’
‘I apologise my dear, Mr Holmes was running late for his concert,’ I didn’t add,
‘I know ‘e didn’t ‘ave nuthin’ to do wif that, I know ‘e didn’t. But I am worried for ‘im. The master knew all kinds of shady types, an’ if John was mixed up wif them, he might be in any kind of trouble, ‘e might even be-‘ She broke off, gulped a breath and continued.
" So you're  telling me,  this MicCroft sent you back to save that kid .Then told  you that Bobby can get you home..-"
“ You always looked up to your uncle. But to take his name ?  Tisk tisk .” Sherlock said with a smile .
That was just a test . And it provided a wonderful amount of data.
" I have no idea and I don't want to find out." Sam caught up to them not long after. He glanced over the scene and pointed to the far end of the Cemetery. " The kids are over there. "
" Sorry I laid my  filthy hands on you and I will never touch or speak to you again . Because if I do John Watson is going to feed me my prick for lunch. ”
“Why should John tell me anything when you haven't even answered his first question!!.” Sherlock challenged “It is best you go ”
Surprised Henry pulls his hand away with a start.
The next morning John was at the bunker again watching the strange men and women go about their business. Whatever that may be. Who knew the post office had this huge bunker like building built into it. He was sitting on the edge of the balcony when Khoung's deep Russian accented voice broke his train of thought.
" Enough chit chat! We have work to do"
“Nicer. “ Sherlock finished “Much nicer.  I will even pay. I don't feel like coming down with a serious case of Pediculosis pubis.”
Somehow the further into the graveyard they went the darker it got. Sherlock and the girls pleas faded into that darkness. John's legs were burning . How long has he been running?
One look at the message made
"How about you lay back yeah?"John said pushing the boy back to lay on the sofa. Once he was sure Sherlock was somewhat comfortable he placed the frozen peas on his ankles and used the shredded pant legs to hold them there .
John snagged the necklace from the strange man . He couldn't look away from the tiny frilly top hat clipped on the red side of his head. It to matched his hair and sunglass...this guy was a weirdo!
As usual, the bloody idiot had refused medical help till John had bullied him to it. John had been so enraged by then that the whole cleaning, stitching, pumping of anti-biotics, drinking of fluids with electrolytes, et al had been accomplished with almost no fuss. Sherlock had even acquiesced to the bloody orange shock blanket!
Sherlock stared at him mute.
Sherlock can see the struggle in him. He can see that his hand is clasping and unclasping, a hint of a tremor again. His frown lines are prominent even though he is trying his best to keep a neutral face. The bravery is a soldier’s, but the honesty is all John Watson’s.
My salute to my hero. You will be missed.
“Can I hug you?”
“But... but with you it would… Can’t you see? I’ve already given you all… So don’t okay. Just please don’t ask this of me, okay. Cos I need to leave something of me for me. Okay? And yeah! I’m fucking scared. Call me a bloody coward if you want. But I can’t. Just leave this piece of me for me. Please. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I can’t.”

.” He threatened but his tone had no sting  and so now Sherlock gave him his full
“I’m glad that fool didn’t shoot you.”
“She told him- good thing you didn’t hit our good doctor or you’d need an ambulance.”
About a week later they were seated at the table after a crazy chase both following and being followed by a psychotic killer. One look at Sherlock’s tired face coupled with John’s mulish scowl and Lestrade had allowed them to go home instead of ordering them to the Yard.
“Me too. And I will add the same for the other fool and you. Ta very much. Once in a life is quite enough wouldn’t you say?” He immediately stumbled. “Sorry. Sorry.”
When he first returned to find the detective missing John had first called his mobile, gotten his whereabouts (with surprising calm given his exasperation) and then the DI’s to relay them, cursed Sherlock for losing John’s revolver a few days back, and rushed to the site as fast as was humanly possible in London.
“Yeah, only when I texted. What if he had taken the gun before I had reached you? We are partners, Sherlock. You can’t. Oh hell! We are having the same conversation again. So forget it and go to sleep.”
"You are perfect as you are. Just right. And we are good. And I can take it as a friend, best mate, colleague, flatmate, partner. I can and I like it. But if we became more then I would resent it. It would poison everything. And I can’t change okay? I don’t want you to change either. Why should you? But if… if we… I will be the one to ask for more, to ask for change, for things you can’t or won’t give. I will need to
That's it. I'm hoping this brings our beloved idiots to some conclusion.
John patted him softly and nodded, “Can you tell me why?”
“Get up,” he said, rising himself. Sherlock slowly got to his feet, wincing as he unthinkingly pushed up on his arms. It is unclear why this happened next but John said, “Sherlock?” in a querying voice, prompting Sherlock to raise his head enquiringly. “I’m going to hug you, okay?” Sherlock merely blinked and turned his palms outward in mute and weak invitation. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist resting his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s expression was now unreadable even to his blogger now. John bit his lower lip. Wishing he could always know. And if not know then wishing he had every right to demand to be told.
It had been three weeks since that conversation. He didn’t want to hear it all again, but he didn’t want his best friend to suffer either. He was torn. Sherlock’s eyes were on his. He knew a part of it was the nearly seeing each other killed again. Thats what had triggered it the last time as well. And if truth be told for a brief moment he had feared for Sherlock as well. John scrambled back and touched Sherlock’s face. Barely skimming his cheek with his finger tips.
As soon as they reached home, John had gone off to the wash, retrieved the bottle of meds, helped Sherlock to change (taking a look at the dressing, it wasn’t stained) and wash, pushed some food into his flatmate, followed it with tea, and here they were now, adrenaline receded, tired, one of them barely able to sit up, the other too keyed up to even blink. Finally, John did blink and noticed Sherlock ready to slide off his chair.
They were both home.
Sherlock lifted away his hands abruptly.
“Sherlock, what is it? I already told you to go ahead, didn’t I? I’ll tell you clearly what I like or don’t.”
On 28th of July this week my hero and idol - the author
“You are already….” Finally, John removes his hands and moves them expansively as if covering the universe, “…to me. Everything.” He tucks his hands in again.
Sherlock cocked a brow and John knew his misstep hasn’t been missed.
Yes, I thought the first chapter would be a stand alone. Yes I had no intention of writing any more here. yes, I must complete my other Johncroft instead.
“You are so important to me. So very important. I hope you know it. Please know it. You can say anything, I swear. I want you to tell me as much as possible. Anything. I’ll always want that. Even if you think that I wont understand, even if I’m an idiot or because I’m an idiot, or it’s just something unimportant to you, it wont be to me because you are telling me. I promise. And I won't stop you ever from telling me or from acting upon it. And I promise to... to... to reciprocate. I promise Sherlock, I'm listening and I promise to tell you as well. It's all ok and... and Yes. So. Please tell me. Please.”
In a while the trembles subsided. John reluctantly let go.
So when Sherlock noticed his stillness and raised his head again still smiling through his pain, John finally decided to find his courage. He lifted one hand and laid it over Sherlock’s cheek, when Sherlock didn't react he did the same with the other and let his face show his heart. Sherlock drew in a hard shaky breath and John spread his hands to cradle the one thing he found most precious in this world.
in danger. I like joining you on chases. Yeah ok, don’t give me that look, I more than like it. But… and I do realise that we aren’t equals in many ways, but I do wish you would take me along when there is likely to be danger. Even a small chance. I’ve said it a million times. Just let me know. That’s all.”
He told himself he was tired as well and he should stop this… whatever, and go to sleep. With a soft sigh he heaved himself from the bed. “John?”
NOTE: Gregg and Pret both used to have branches on every high street and office area in London a few years back and people like me who couldn't or wouldn't cook were regular customers. The food used to be great for grabbing a bite on the go. Hope they have survived the downturn in the economy.
John looked up again, frowned, bit his lip and smiled. “Anything you want. Just say ok. I’m not a genius.”
“No. No.” John hastened to put those loving hands around his own face again. He rested his chin against the detectives chest and looked up with his heart in his eyes. Sherlock drew a breath that sounded more like a sob. “I… Who do you think is more… I’m scared, Sherlock.”
“You do recall that you, the great consulting detective, deduced shotly after we met that I had no issue with facing danger. So no, I still don’t get where this is coming from.”
Just as well, seeing as the quarry had become the hunter. Sherlock had managed to follow the killer to a warehouse that was very obviously owned by a
“Starved I suppose?” Sherlock teased mildly.
“John.”
John whisked off his jacket, toed off his shoes, put the two in their places by the door almost as soon as he closed the door behind him. Brisk. Efficient.
John beamed and got up to walk to the sofa tugging him along. “Go ahead then. Just as you please.”
“Why are you here?”
He rolled over and threw his slipper at it, missing.
“I’d thought you’d gone.” Sherlock said, looking as if he bolted down from his room.
Sherlock Holmes was loved by John Watson and John Watson was loved by Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock didn’t speak and John sat against the frame of Sherlock’s bed, reading his chart.
John spluttered as Will leant back, a smug look on his face.
He ran after Will and the escaping chef into an abandoned car park, helping Will trap the man.
‘Come on.”
John nodded.
Even after solving the case, solving the puzzle and finding the children and the assailant, Sherlock was a few hours too late. One was dead and the other in critical condition, the abductor unconscious from John’s fist and Sherlock miserable.
“Sorry,” John said, bending his knees in no way to hide his interest. “Just seeing you does things.”
“John.”
The man looked at him with distaste.
The doors closed and Sherlock vanished, leaving John alone with Sherlock’s keeper who was staring at him with interest.
“I didn’t want the first time I said it to be this depressing, nor did I actually want to say it first, mind you.” Sherlock said, sounding like his old condescending self.
Great.
“Yes.”
There was a lull in conversation as Molly tried to get over the mortification but John didn’t mind, instead searching the restaurant for Will.
John wasn’t going to leave him alone but he knew he had to be strategic when it came to helping this man.
Sherlock dragged John by the wrist back to his room, not speaking once.
“Hello, are you ready to order?”
“Doctor Watson, do not think me oblivious.” Mycroft stepped forward, swinging his umbrella. “You like my brother.”
The man blinked and narrowed his eyes at John.
John hadn’t received a call from Psych and John was adamant to the receptionist, (who John had finally learnt was called Natalie) to call him if Sherlock was readmitted.
“Great,” Sherlock said, flapping his hands awkwardly towards his person. “Hit me with it then.”
Jesus, he really needed a kip.
Sherlock shrugged.
John turned on his own charm.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said, licking his lips. “I just love morning breath on you.”
Sherlock smirked.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and cocked his head, looking too innocent and cute for John to handle this early.
“Wait, this restaurant doesn’t have a murderer for a chef, does it?”
“Oh, I’m sorry. What are you in for?”
Sherlock slid his crotch to John’s and froze.
John’s date was twenty minutes late.
“Hi, Molly, isn’t it?”
“Are you one of Sherlock’s doctors?”
“Yeah, well,” John said, looking up from his menu. “We all need a bit of excitement in our lives.”
John’s eyes were drawn to the movement.
They were sat at the table he was at last time and he quickly pulled out Irene’s chair for her.
“Brilliant.”
Mycroft just sat there; reading today’s paper, completely oblivious with John’s internal debate with the pros and cons of slamming his head against the table.
Unfortunately, John’s friends decided to step up and play cupid.
John had never seen anything more beautiful in his life.
“That’s really for the psych to decide, but I don’t see why. We normally only put recovering addicts on anti-depressants if they are showing signs of depression or something, but Sherlock seems right, but then again I haven’t been monitoring his mood.” His tone turned serious. “If he is showing signs of possible relapse, maybe don’t let them administer him drugs that would worsen his conditions.”
John jumped up and worked his magic, causing not only two
He wondered aloud what Mycroft did that provided him the finances to live here.
“Excuse me?” John said, walking towards the man who, as John got closer, was shaking quite servery and sweating feverishly. “Are you okay?”
Sherlock threw up just as John was placing a thin sheet over him, and stopped to rub calming circles on the sick man’s back.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, the spray soaking John’s boxer briefs wet, turning them a darker grey and causing them to cling to his skin.
John gave in, sliding down next to him, checking his pulse and his temperature once again before letting go and studying the man’s face.
“Wait,” he called and John returned.
The man swore and hit the machine.
“You can’t blame yourself.”
“Thanks for the tip earlier.” John said, nodding towards the restaurant.
“Not yet, mate. Can you give us a min-“ John looked up at their server. “You’re not Chinese.”
John’s heart and lungs stopped.
John helped Sherlock to bed, laying him on his side facing the door, a bucket beside him, just in case.
“Curry laksa with prawns, please.”
“Oh, I don’t really. We met last Monday and we got to talking and she asked me if I were single and voilà, here I am.”
Like clockwork, his date melted and sighed, closing her eyes at his slight touch. The way she was reacting to John’s touches was astounding. It seemed that maybe John might get a shag out of tonight.
Mycroft just stared at him and soon John was in the familiar black Benz, driving through a neighbourhood too posh for the likes of him, a heavy feeling in his stomach.
“Yes,” Molly said, staring heatedly at her menu as she tried to decide. “I’ll have the—“ Molly broke off when she looked a Will, a starry-eye look overtaking her face.
“You’re on the lowest dose of buprenorphine possible and you’re not showing anymore withdrawal symptoms, unless you count irritability, but I’m coming to think that you’re just irritable by nature.” He gave Sherlock a grin, letting him know he was kidding. “They’ll probably want to keep you in here for a few more days, just to make sure you’re not dependant on anything new or likely to relapse which means you’re probably going to have to stay with a reliable friend or family member for a while.” He gave Sherlock a sympathetic smile, as he knew how much Sherlock detested his brother. “But nevertheless, you’re free.”
A tea light candle sat in a brandy glass between them, casting a golden light on them. The restaurant seemed a tad bit more romantic then John remembered, but he normally came here exhausted and left with takeout, plus this was a date.
“’Night John,” Sherlock mumbled, his voice slurred by his sleepiness. “’Loveyou.”
John took his and Sherlock’s mugs to the table, stopping to mark off the calendar.
John knocked on the door but when there was no reply he pushed the door open slightly, only to be almost hit by an empty IV bag.
“Yes, I’ll have the roast duck with rice, thanks.”
“Dinner?” John asked.
“So, I heard you got shot.”
“And anything else?”
“Oh,” John said, crossing his hands over his lap, embarrassed.  “I haven’t seen you naked before and I didn’t want to until you were ready and it seemed insensitive to ask you while you were upset but you need comforting and-“
After ten minutes, John gave in, needing to make sure Sherlock was okay and needing assurance himself, as he was the one who found and tried resuscitate the kids.
“You know that bloke you told to keep an eye one while I’m on Psych rounds? He’s leaving. Thought you’d like to know.”
“Got stuck, huh? Here, I’m good with these.” John tipped the vending machine slightly to its side and then thumped it quite hard.
in his sweaty hands.
“This’ll do nicely,” she looked away from the stuttering waitress. “Won’t it, Jack?”
The man suddenly curled into himself and started retching and with cat-like reflex, John grabbed one of the kidney shaped bowls that was, luckily, stashed between seats and place it gently under the man’s chin.
“How did you guess doctor?”
“If you can tell me that, you are definitely not dying.”
They stood outside a large wooden door, a tray of sandwiches and iced tea waiting outside, untouched.
Sherlock’s hand settled around John’s waist and the two swayed in their living room until Sherlock’s empty stomach protested and the two shared a simple breakfast of toast between them, their seats much closer than usual, sharing small, secret smiles with each bite.
“Some mate he his.”
Once again, the check came and no numbers where exchanged, but John did hope to see her again. If John ever had to work with a pathologist, it would be Molly. Many pathologists were too serious, but Molly had a certain morbid sense of humour that John enjoyed.
John shrugged and Will came over, his notebook poised and ready.
John followed Sherlock’s gaze and found it stained orangey-red.
“You can’t expect to solve every case.”
“John, look at me.”
This was one of the best hospitals in London, so John was used to dealing with posh and ill prats but he had never come across one quite like this.
Sherlock froze and his eyes widen.
Sherlock held out his hand.
“Irene, I take it?”
“Maybe I missed my favourite patient?”
(Or how John came to realise that Sherlock needs more love and Sherlock came to realise that John was willing to give it to him)
He sat on the edge of the bed, one hand on Sherlock’s forehead, keeping the flannel there and the other rubbing soothing patterns on his neck as he checked his pulse.
“John Watson.”
When their server came over to their table again, John’s gaze got stuck on his face.
Louise was…spiteful, to say the least.
“Afghanistan. How did you know?”
“So,” John said, taking a sip of tea. “I heard that Greg brought you over some cases. Still wanna’ be a detective, huh?”
Mycroft smiled and yep, the slimy feeling hasn’t vanished during the past fortnight.
“Really?” He purred. “Tell me more.”
John was happy to stay at this speed and so was Sherlock, so that was where they stayed until that one case.
John and Mycroft shared a look and John threw the bar at Sherlock, who caught it gracefully.
The man lifted one thin, frail wrist and John watched the plastic hospital band slide down his pale forearm.
John shuffled in his seat; terrified that Louise was going to poison him.
“Did you want to get back to your date?”
when Sherlock’s arm wrapped around his waist, turning him around.
Will hummed.
John, not at all encouraged by Sherlock’s response, pressed on and placed a small peck on Sherlock’s lips, finding them flaking and cracked.
“Excuse me,” John interrupted the man. He looked up and smiled at John, looking far more awake and alert than John felt.
John stood up, leaving his now-cold tea and sorry excuse for Italian cuisine behind. He patted his friend’s back in thanks and bolted up the stairs, not even considering waiting for the lifts.
opened.
“Yes,” he coughed out.
“Love you, too.” Sherlock said, taking the notebook back into the bathroom with him.
“Yes, we were.” John grinned, a fond feeling filling his chest.
“Withdrawal.”
“Thanks, mate.”
“Maybe I overstayed my welcome.”
“Yes.”
“Well, whenever you’re on leave again and you want to grab a coffee with a friend, or get tired of a warzone and just want a calmer job, call me.”
John bit his lip, his cheeks hurting with the velocity of his smile.
Both Greg and Mycroft were looking at him oddly and John felt that that was a sign to leave.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she spluttered, turning even redder. John worried about her blood vessels. “It’s just that Clara told me you were shot and everything and that you went back and-“
, watching the man watch him.
John followed him into the kitchen, where Will sat him down at a small table crammed in between a pantry and a stainless steel bench.
John kissed back, changing the kiss into something less forceful and more relaxed.
“I proved he was across London.”
John laughed, trying to hide his broken feelings.
Somehow, John would have felt more comfortable if Mycroft turned out to be a mafia king or something less likely to ruin John’s medical or military career in an instance if something bad happened between him and Sherlock.
The door slammed shut right back in their faces.
“Sure.”
A few minutes later, he was back next to Mycroft, panting but pleased, with four
“Yes, now leave me alone!”
“Well, I should head out. My break ends soon and I’m starving. It’s good to see you’re better and… real.”
“You know what, Holmes? Just, come to the Yard tomorrow to fill out a report.” He turned to John. “You too.”
John nodded at his name.
John took a breath.
His phone buzzed and he pulled it out.
“The bastard. I asked him if he wanted it earlier and he completely blanked me.”
“So,” John said, causing the man to look up from where he was slumped. “Are you visiting?”
That morning when Sherlock woke up, John was in his chair, a plan firmly stuck in his head and he was ready.
“As much as I enjoy hearing about your impending departure to the Middle East,” Sherlock said, pulling John back to the bedroom. “I have something else in mind.”
John made eye contact with the waiter. The waiter raised his brows and looked down at his notebook, to Sarah and then back at John, giving him a significant look.
“Yes,” came the arrogant reply through the door and since John had just zipped his jeans up, he knew Mycroft was correct.
“Oh,” John said, huffing a laugh. “My sister-in-law is setting me up and I think Irene thought Clara was asking her out, not me—or for me, really. It’s confusing.”
“So they gave you naltrexone while you still had heroin in your system? Well, that explains your state last night!” John was angry.
Despite the lack of light and the sickening health the man was in, he was still handsome and if he and John met in any other scenario, John would be turning on the charm.
John flushed at Sherlock’s tone.
His shaking was getting worse and the man’s knees started jostling together.
His cigarette hung out of his mouth so nonchalantly, as if he didn’t just completely astound and stump John.
“Dinner?” He whispered into Sherlock’s ear.
“Anytime.” The man held out his hand. “Greg Lestrade.”
John choked on his water.
“I’m fine, thank you.” Even though the man looked and sounded like hell, he still spoke with a pompous tone.
coffee at his feet and
“Morning John, is there any tea?”
He straddled Sherlock, Sherlock’s hands resting on his hipbones, and slipped Sherlock’s head through the t-shirt, kissing his forehead as soon as the shirt settled to hang around his neck, waiting.
John gave his brightest grin.
Sherlock shut the door behind John and pressed him against it, kissing him dry and hard.
Mycroft didn’t say anything, instead moving aside to allow Sherlock to catch sight of the much shorter John.
“Hello,” John sing-songed, and press a dry kiss to the end of Sherlock’s nose.
“Good to know you’re just as cheeky when sober then you are when you’re high.”
Sarah nodded and fixed her gaze at her toes, looking nervous and apologetic.
With their return home, John was happy, but Sherlock was ecstatic, jumping up and down with glee.
When Sherlock nodded his head, John frowned.
It was a bit awkward being left there, with each of the chefs and a number of wait staff frowning at him whenever they looked his way, but he was hungry and he really wanted to see Will.
John was about to punch Mycroft’s exasperated expression right off his face.
John laughed.
John sat down across from him, suddenly wide-awake with curiosity.
“Yeah, basically.”
as well.
He watched Will have a heated conversation with one of the chefs in what sounded like fluent Mandarin and came back with a plate of garlic fried vegetables and a plastic bag of prawn crackers.
“Could you help me, please?”
They were working on a kidnapping case. Two children, £50,000 ransom, seventy-two hours.
“I use to feel that way during the war.” He moved his foot closer to him, causing a squeaking noise that echoed in the otherwise silent bathroom. “How pointless it was to sew up and heal injured soldiers just to have them go back out into battle and get shot all over again. What was the point?”
There was an awkward silence as John stared at Sherlock and Sherlock stared back until there was a cough from behind John, forcing him back into reality.
The man laughed.
“Is there anything I can do?” John asked, running his fingers across the sweaty back of Sherlock’s neck in a soothing gesture.
“No, no. I want it!”
“Your date left.”
He watched the man vomit up the food he had attempted to beat up a vending machine for.
Sherlock nodded.
John hummed and was gratefully saved from further conversation by the arrival of Will.
John bit is lip, looking into the window that was too tinted to see inside.
“And if you ever get over this guy and want to date a soldier, call me. I’ll hook you up.”
“Yes, that.”
John clutched at the two thin shards of metal and flushed. He had gotten used to the ever-present clinking.
“Thanks, but ahh-care to tell me what the bloody hell happened?”
“To war?”
Sherlock froze and his eyes widened, as if the thought never occurred to him.
“Mycroft went to go get me something, or he just wanted an excuse not to be around Lestrade. One night stands do tend to make things a bit awkward.”
He climbed into the bath, tucking his feet between Sherlock calves and the edge of the bath.
“Go home, John.”
When Detective Inspector Lestrade came over to 221B to get both men’s statements and give them his congratulations of a case well solved, he was rudely told to bugger off by one Sherlock Holmes and a well-thrown leather brogue.
John took a minute to think that maybe Mycroft was downplaying his job description. He then mentally slapped himself for thinking about
“Finished?” Will asked and John nodded.
“Seriously, good luck.” Greg said, with an amused smile.
The man ate one half of the chocolate before he answered John.
He did, out of his goddamn British politeness, and was stunned to find Mycroft there, suited to the nines and still wielding that umbrella/weapon.
Sherlock opened the door, shaven yet unwashed, wearing only his pyjamas and dressing gown, looking peeved.
“Good job. Here-“
The kitchen door flung open so hard that it chipped at the paint on the wall, revealing a washed, dressed Sherlock.
Molly was funny and wise and, if you ignored her enjoyment of
Mycroft spotted John’s haul and, for the first time since John’s known him, smiled in a way that didn’t seem creepy or leave John feeling slimy.
John flushed at being called cute but his interest was piqued from the other thing the man said.
“Well?” He asked.
“And you, sir?”
“Anything else?”
Enter Mike Stamford, an old med school friend of his, who thought the pathologist from Barts would be perfect for him.
“Why did you come?”
“I prefer to be…precise.”
“No,” he said, drawing the sound out, staring unnerving at John.
Sherlock nodded and John lightly touched the tie of Sherlock’s towel. He froze and John raised his hands.
“Fine, but only because I’m worried about my patient.”
Sherlock laughed and pulled John down.
John didn’t mind shy girls, in fact during his uni days he thrived on them but Molly seemed so small that one small gush of wind could knock her over flat.
Faint violin music was heard.
His arms were bare and with a quick look, John did notice a couple of track marks.
John wasn’t sure what happened to Doctor Nelson but the nurse’s assistant that John cornered the day after he met Sherlock, said that he never came in for his next shift and no one had heard from him since. A little disconcerting, considering Mycroft’s face when he found out about Doctor Nelson’s fuck-up, but John really didn’t want to get involved in any of that shadiness, he just wanted Sherlock to get better.
Mary was flirting with him and John smiled and replied politely back, his concentration on the red door that separated the kitchen from the dining room.
The rest of the meal was pleasant.
He watched the nameless lady and the nameless man get it.
Also, the gratification and hysteria both he and Sherlock felt whenever a client (or Mycroft) used the crystal (and stolen) ashtray.
The man smirked and before he could answer, the back door to
John laughed as well, knowing full well that Sherlock could hear everything that they were saying.
“But I haven’t even touched you,” Sherlock said incredulously, taking John hands and heaving himself up.
Will raised an eyebrow and gave him a look.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered towards him and he sighed, slumping further against the wall.
John huffed a laugh.
John unlocked the door to Will.
Well, that bought John’s attention and determination back.
John sighed and stood up.
John closed his eyes. He had a very short temper (not best for doctors) and Sherlock’s suggestion that he made his own drugs was just about enough.
“Are you ready to order?”
“Your date Sally said you were both doctors. I overheard.”
Doctor John H. Watson and W.S.S. Holmes’ Study on Intimacy and Affection and its Affects on its Participants
“Really not fond of visitors, are you?”
John inwardly cringed. He didn’t partially like woman who giggled like schoolgirls.
“I should thank you, Doctor Watson, for everything you did for my brother.”
“Sorry, I’m so late. It’s just, there was no one else at the surgery and just before we closed a boy came in needing stiches and I was the only one there and-“
Sherlock glared at him and he shut up.
Will stopped dead and John could have sworn a light flush highlighted those cheekbones.
“I do not… not like him.” Even to his own ears, his denial sounded weak.
She was funny and quick and not to mention beautiful but when they sat down at his normal table
“Regardless, if there is anything I can do for you, name it now.”
The man raised a brow.
“It was nothing, I would have done it for any other patient.”
“Can you guess what patients I had today?”
There was a silence that seemed to follow John and Sherlock everywhere.
He saw Sherlock roll his eyes and John laughed, a little self-conscious at his obviously concern for Sherlock.
They passed a
John went to walk back to his flat when he was stopped by a deep voice in the alley.
John was quite shocked. The man said it with such indifference. As bad and stereotyping as it was, John could normally pin point any drug addict but this man didn’t seem the type.
“Sarah?”
John was disappointed at the womanly voice.
He walked past Sherlock, stopping to put the leftover chocolate bars in front on his when Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
A dark skinned woman came behind John and took the struggling chef away from him, handcuffing him and reciting his rights.
They were nearing closer to the end of the hallway, a large window waiting for at the end. John tried not to imagine himself jumping out of it.
Sherlock and him had always been close, John wasn’t denying that. There was a reason that many believed (or more hoped) that they were together and their easy friendship, living situation and lack of significant others made those presumptions understandable.
“Sick, vomiting child.” John nodded. “Plastered a broken bone.” John nodded again. “Someone bled on you—broken nose?” John smiled. “And…you delivered bad news.” John nodded and pulled a
John was tired.
“I’ll find out and deal with that later. My break ends soon,” he looked Sherlock up and down, remembering last night vending machine and vomiting festivity. “Have you eaten?”
“Sherlock?” John called.
It was a lack of communication, a complete inept and childish reason on why the two shouldn’t be happy, and, despite the one having a MD and the other being a Savant genius, the two ponces couldn’t have one conversation about feelings without becoming two great big emotionally stunted, too-British idiots.
“I’m a chemist major at university.” John deflated. “Besides, who else would deal me drugs after Mycroft paid them all off?”
He and Sarah sat in a booth near the kitchen doors.
“Haircut, mostly, and the way you hold yourself but you know what truly gave it away?” The man lifted his non-vomit-smeared hand and pulled out John’s dog tags from beneath his shirt. “You’re jingling.”
John was sitting in the canteen trying to choke down what was apparently lasagne and lukewarm tea when Stamford came barrelling towards him.
He watched the man slowly eat the ‘c’ shaped crisps.
“But then Gregory suggested that he was missing you and I, of course, had to check.”
“No.”
John folded his arms.
“Certainly!”
“No,” John chuckled. He didn’t really want to talk about his womanizing ways in front of the man he really, really wanted to shag.
“Will there be anything else?”
“Why? You didn’t push the needle into my veins.”
“Good to know you’re real as well.”
“Guess we got our answer.”
Mycroft looked puzzled.
Sherlock smiled wide and John’s chest hurt. He was beginning to not think of Sherlock as a helpless patient anymore and that wasn’t good.
“I’m just—“ He got up when he got no reply and walked towards the bathrooms.
“Don’t move. Stay right there.”
Well, John thought. At least she’s protected.
While his next shift started at nine, little Josephine McKinley’s test results would be back from the lab soon and John really didn’t want to keep Mr and Mrs McKinley waiting, especially since they drove all the way from Dartmouth to be here tonight.
He flipped the page of the notepad, revealing the message underneath.
“Sorry about that. My last patient, Mr Abbott, was found partially decomposed and I had to cut the maggots out of him for his family.”
“I’ll be back with drinks.”
John snorted.
John removed both of his hands and stood up, fixing the sheet around his friend and turned off the light, and turn to check on Sherlock once more.
