After dinner, and a few more beers, Dean excused himself by telling his family he wanted to go to bed early so he could get up early in the morning to train. It earned him a few confused looks but he didn’t pay any attention to them, trying to give them a convincing yawn on his way out.
“What the hell are you doing?” He couldn’t help the anger dripping from his words, loud and startling the angel. This short-fused temper was something he’d clearly gotten from his father, and he hated it, he loathed the times when he spoke, harshly, and heard John’s voice instead. Bobby used to say Winchesters had a fuse so short they made volcanoes look stable.
“Do you even know how to cook anything?” He noticed the way Cas was looking at the packets of instant noodles in front of him, and it didn’t look as if they had a lot of pre-packaged ramen in Heaven.
Castiel looked up at him, his eyebrows lifting as if to say ‘be my guest’, he didn’t need to though, he knew Metatron would speak anyway, he clearly relished in the sound of his own voice.
“Maybe it’s just some old slice of pie someone forgot to mail out. Maybe it’s got nothing to do with why we’re here.” Dean offered, trying to convince himself as much as Cas. “We should go, because I’ll bet you my left kidney whoever came to unload these boxes, is going to come back to throw all this away.” He kicked some of the cardboard boxes on the floor.
“Yes, a terrible inconvenience,” Once again Metatron's face didn't show a trace of emotion. “Don’t you worry, I have got it all under control.”
Dean looked up, Cas’s face showed more emotion than he had ever seen in him, he could feel himself sobering with every second that passed, and just wished time would stand still for a minute.
She opened the oven and took the pie out, placing it in front of him on the table. “Whatever you say Dean-O” she laughed. “So to what do I owe the pleasure then?”
An idea had occurred to him, one where he didn’t actually need to get rid of them, just keep them out of trouble. And if they became a nuisance in the meantime he would deal with it, in some way, before Metatron would be the wiser. He never expected to actively rebel against Metatron’s cause, never in a million years did he guess he would not only not follow orders, but to allow the kid he healed, a grown man now, to get to know him, and to spend so much time with a human.
“Ah, I wondered when I would have the pleasure to meet you, Dean,” The figure spoke, his head heavy, eyes on the floor beneath “I have been waiting for you to stop by.”
Metatron's face turned into a wide smile and slowly an eerie laugh started to fill the room. No one said anything, not even Gabriel.
Dean couldn’t help but feel taken aback by the completely honest answer. He didn’t expect Cas to tell him much, but he was grateful to know that coming over here, trusting he would help him understand,  hadn’t been for nothing. Castiel had always been vague about everything Heaven-related, understandably so, but this was not the time for compassion.
Dean knew he had to leave sooner than later. He had two options: either knock John out - which was easier said than done - or make a run for it. His duffel was right by the door where he’d left it, and the keys to the cabin and the car were inside. He’d left the impala parked down the street, so John wouldn’t notice he was home (so much for that), so he could just try and run past him. He was faster and lighter, he could probably get away in normal conditions, but he was hurt, badly, the ribs on his right side were burning in pain, like someone was pulling them apart from the inside, his head was whole other story, he felt the cuts opening with every small muscle movement, blood dripping and clouding his vision a little, he was unbalanced and there was this ringing that he was pretty sure wasn’t from the outside - so, all in all, he wasn’t sure he could run three steps without falling face down and being at his dad’s free will, and as much as he wanted to believe John wouldn’t kick him while he was down, he wasn’t so sure with his current state of mind.
“C’mon Dean, you know what I mean. You know you can talk to me, right? I’m not dad, I’m not gonna tell you to drop your life for us.”
“I’m serious Dean, you should just take a step back and realize not everyone is out to get you, just give this poor guy a chance to prove you wrong.”
The box wasn’t any old regular prison cell, it was actually a normal room surrounded by four grey walls. There were no windows, no beds or toilets, no metal bars, and only one way in. There was one piece of furniture in the middle of the room, a simple iron chair. It was completely surrounded by hand-painted sigils and heavy iron chains. For years this chair had been empty, unused for the most part, besides a few demons who had only lived to sit in the chair for a few hours. However this time, the iron chair had been occupied by someone for months.
so after training with Sam, he’d go straight to the cabin. The faster he would leave a note, the sooner Cas would be able to act on this new information.
The words hit him harder than the steel door and he felt like he’d just been punched in the gut. Dean made himself breathe through it because if there was anything worse than having Sam actually say these words to him, it would be to have Sam see his reaction to them.
“You know when you want to pick up a chick-“ He decided to just drop it, he was too drunk for this.  “nevermind”.
“I told you.” It said while slowly pulling the knife out of its chest. “Those won't do you any good.”
“No,-” Dean’s mouth let the words fall out before his brain even got the chance to catch up, “-no, I know for a fact you don't mean,-” Surely Cas wasn’t saying what he thought he was saying. Still, that’s exactly what it sounded like- like he should just be done with Dean, cut his losses and move on.
He got to the door, trying not to look back as he walked out, where everyone could see him. Not that he could count on any of his neighbors to intervene if it really came down to it. Dean tried to jog to his car, more limping than actually running, pain radiating from basically everywhere. His bad leg was throbbing, and Dean cursed the damn werewolves for the scar that still bothered him, he cursed at everything and everyone he could think of. Except for the few people who were actually there for him. He didn’t curse Sam, he didn’t curse Cas, in fact, thinking of Cas was the only thing that kept him from giving up and just dropping to the floor. He wasn’t sure why his mind went straight to Cas, maybe because he had healed him multiple times, or because Cas was the only thing that brought him joy lately. He could see the Impala now, just around the corner, and more thoughts of Cas and the time they had been spending together busied his brain, made him shift his focus from the pain. He allowed himself to dwell on the thoughts for once. He allowed his mind to picture Cas’s face and what he looked like when he smiled, the way his voice sounded, and how Castiel’s wings had been the most amazing thing Dean had ever seen in his life
“I don’t know,” Dean looked over at him as he stuffed his hands deeper inside his jacket, and Castiel wondered if he was cold. “I guess they’re just not convinced that he doesn’t know what they’re asking of him.”
A sly grin appeared on Uriel’s face while he nodded in agreement. His superior Metatron was a wise angel, he was right to say that it was time to take action against those pitiful ants. Ever since their father (God himself) had disappeared, things had been a colossal mess down on earth. The humans had proclaimed the planet as theirs, it was truly a despicable thing to witness. They started their own wars, started to chip away at the planet, and worst of all, they lost their respect for God. All of Heaven had been waiting for their father, God himself, to return. Years had gone by but none of the angels had ever come across a sign. Eventually, the four elders stepped up and began to rule in their father's name. It was the only plausible solution at the time but they lacked a certain quality. They were too busy trying to please their father, too busy to see that their control over earth was slowly slipping out of their very own hands.
“The one I healed in the alley,” Castiel’s eyes found his. “You care a lot about him,” it wasn’t a question.
“Found anything down there?” Dean asked, trying to not sound out of breath, as the weight burned his shoulder blades.
“Do you not want me to?” Cas was still speaking softly to him, like he was talking to a child having a temper tantrum.
The archangel was locked away in their highest security cell, with hunters stationed on guard duty at every door and window.
Dean sighed. “Well, one minute I was walking by myself, and then next thing I know I was playing tag with a bunch of bloodthirsty wolfs.”
“Well I’m fine, aren’t I?” Dean threw his hands in the air which caused his right leg to sting, but he refused to let the pain display across his face.
“That’s… something.” Dean didn’t know what to say, because really, what was there to say? What do you say to someone who is older than anything you have ever touched, or maybe even heard of?
The three figures disappeared into the night again, John and Curtis heading one way and the lone man heading another. The pair waited for a few minutes, Dean had to be sure he wouldn’t run into his father on the way out, that was a conversation he wanted to avoid at all costs.
“Yeah, you know how it is, the old noggin just ain’t what it used to be.” Dean forced a laugh, hoping to god this guy would just let him get on his way “Didn’t
Once in the kitchen, Dean stretched his arm as high as he could, but it was useless, Sam had stored the Lucky Charms’ box way up high, and he wasn’t about to use a step ladder to get it, his pride couldn’t handle that big of a hit. He’d just eat toast instead.
“Your city is being fed false intel, and slaughtering angels with no provocation whatsoever.” Gabriel hissed at him, and Castiel thought it might be wise to step in before things got heated, but Dean didn’t seem upset.
After the conversation with Gabriel Dean had tried his best to keep things light with Cas, giving them one last night of
“More than you, that’s for sure.” And at that Dean could only roll his eyes, making a low complaining noise in the back of his throat. He wasn’t even sure what he was complaining about, that Sam would think he knew more about love than him, or that his own brother would bait him like this.
“What are you talking about?” Castiel tried hard to pretend he didn’t know what the other angel was referring to.
“Yes,” Sam and Dean said in perfect unison. Truth was that Ellen would probably do a lot worse than murder them if they would let Jo tag along on a hunt. And that’s if Jo came back in one piece. A shiver crept up on Dean’s spine at the thought of telling their aunt Ellen Jo hadn’t made it back.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up, expecting Cas to explain further. When he didn’t, Dean tried again, verbally. “Well, are you sure you weren’t followed now? And what the hell happened? You’re getting me kind of worried man.”
Even if every time Cas brushed against him, his skin was set afire and the night flashed across his brain, like muscle memory of those drunken touches, how Castiel’s lips felt against his, and how he melted into him for a few seconds, how his fingers felt like on his back and
Dean’s legs moved by their own accord, and he was running back to Cas, blade in hand, and there was just a second’s worth of hesitation as he pierced it through the back of the angel that had Cas in a stronghold.
When Cas had told him about his orders, to keep track of suspicious activities in the Shady Lady, Dean suggested he stayed at this motel, right across the street from the Club.
“He has a point,” Curt Hunter said, causing the hunters to turn their surprise towards his direction. It wasn’t often that people agreed with Bobby, most hunters thought he was getting too paranoid for the job.
was open on Cas’s knee, all its innards on the ground - still to be organized as the contents of the duffel - and the piece of paper Castiel was inspecting was the picture he kept in his wallet.
“I need you to find anything you can regarding angels and prophecies. Any omens of things to come, you write it down and give it to me, get it?”
“Bye, Dean,” Jo waved as she walked off in the other direction and before she turned around the corner Dean could have sworn she winked at him. This girl really had some nerve.
“Don’t mock me, Cas!” He raised his voice, there was no way in hell he’d let this happen, no way he’d just let Castiel ridicule him, over everything else.
They spent the next few days preparing for the hunting trip to Colorado. The weather had been awful which was why Dean was home earlier than usual on Friday.
“Not that it matters,” the warm feeling in Dean’s stomach turned sour again. “It’s not like it is going anywhere. He’s made it pretty clear that we’re just friends.”
“Look, man…” Dean could either make a run for it, but he was sure Sam could catch him and tackle him, the guy was like a bloodhound, not to mention faster and bigger than Dean,
The leather jacket was hanging loosely over his shoulder but overall Cas (and by Cas he meant the clothes) looked pretty good, really good actually.
as he would have him, so he would do whatever he could to protect the son of bitch, even from himself, even if it would make him hate Dean.
He had to be clear enough to do what he needed to. In a quick move, he jumped to his feet, his bench almost falling over. He made his way out of the bar, through the backdoor, and into the alleyway. Dean looked around, just to be sure he was alone, and no one would think he was insane, and when he made sure there wasn’t a soul to judge him, he let his voice, hoarse from the liquor, echo through the street.
"They've really outdone themselves this time, I'll tell you that," Bobby didn't meet their gaze and his hand reached towards a bottle of whiskey even though it couldn’t be 8 am yet.
“We cannot let them get away with what they have done, it would be an insult to all of Heaven.” From across the marble tabletop, Hannah called out, her tone clearly impatient. “There is no time for such theatrics, Metatron, we must act, now!” A fist slammed on the table, resonating throughout the room.
Castiel looked like a deer caught in headlights and Dean was starting to feel somewhat bad for him, wait no he wasn’t. All he wanted was for the angel to answer his question.
The room was filled to the brim with shelves, holding everything from books to scrolls, and thin glass vials filled with questionable substances. Half burned candles were scattered throughout the room, dry wax dripping from one shelf to another here and there, and Dean couldn’t help but wonder what the room was normally used for.
When Cas finally turned around, his face held the biggest smile Dean had ever seen on the angel. He made his way towards the couch, holding out a bowl of noodles in front of him. Dean could barely bring himself to look at the food, even though he was starving, because the way Cas was smiling, so proud of himself, made his stomach twist and turn (but he figured it could also just be the hunger), but for a moment, Dean thought that he would do pretty much everything to see him smile like this again.
Dumping the duffel on the floor, he took out some of his things. He took off his jacket and shirt, to put on a white training tank, and skimmed out of his jeans to get in a pair of comfortable sweats. Then, he took the tape and started wrapping his knuckles, tight, before sliding his hands into the gloves. Bumping his fists together before starting, he took a step back, and then, hand on the bag, pushed it as far as he could.
“Alright, fair,” Dean put down the bottle of beer. “Though I wouldn’t say I’m avoiding you, I prefer the term safekeeping my sanity.”
“So dad moved it?” He watched as Bobby opened up a map. Dean tried to figure out which state it was, but upon further inspection, he realized it wasn’t even in English. “Where?”
“Two,” he shook the thought out of his head. “You know what, make that one, I'm not staying.” He felt the need to explain, but the woman at the desk hardly looked up.
“I don’t mind,” Cas’s face had that small smile again, that Dean admittedly thought was adorable and he didn’t think he would ever have the strength to say no to him like this. He was about to comply when the angel’s smile faltered and his face scrunched up in what looked like a mixture between focused and annoyed.
“Yeah, I know how sleep works, dumbo.” Dean fumbled around on the couch, not sure where he’d put his legs if he was going to lay down. Or did Cas mean he should lay his head back? Maybe he should just stretch his legs in front of him, and if Cas moved he’d lay like that, if he didn’t he’d find another way.
“So what you’re saying,-” Sam repeated for the umpteenth time, still trying to wrap his mind around it. “-is that there is someone on the inside, driving angels and hunters against each other, in a weird power move to gain control of Heaven?” Dean nodded. “And the only way to avoid a major, unnecessary war that would slaughter hunters and angels alike, is to free the archangel that is being held prisoner in the safest place in the city?”
Instead, Dean just nodded, suddenly very aware of the flush that had risen up his neck and his cheeks.
Over and over again he had tried to refrain himself from jumping to conclusions, just because the hunter wasn’t a cold-blooded murderer, like the rest of his kin, it didn’t mean that it had anything to do with him.
Dean decided to make his way over to Bobby’s, thanking his lucky stars that he forgot to call Sam earlier that night, that was gonna save him a lot of explaining why he looked as amazing as always and not like a strawberry way past its due date. And with everything going on right now, a brawl with his dad was the least of his worries, tonight the angels would meet with the hunters to negotiate. Dean wondered what either of them thought they could possibly gain from one another. Both parties were stubborn and unlikely to give in to what the other wanted. Maybe the angels were looking for a reason to attack? Maybe the hunters were looking for- actually, Dean had no idea what the hunters were hoping to achieve during this conversation. He had always assumed they captured Michael to obtain more knowledge about angels, as a way to better project themselves. But lately, his doubts seemed to keep growing and he was less and less clear as to what the hunter’s intentions were.
“But you did save me,” Dean was still very intrigued by a broken branch near his shoes. “More than once, didn’t you?”
It was foolish, really, he knew that Heaven probably existed outside the realm of space and time, and not really up in the clouds. But he couldn’t help but picture it hanging over his head, pearly gates and all. His eyes dropped back down to his baby’s shadow, and what looked like someone’s shadow next to it. Dean squinted, confused, he was sure that wasn’t there before. He stared some more, and when it wasn’t moving, he got up, grabbed his gun from the table, and carefully made his way outside.
“Hey, can I ask you something?” Dean’s voice sank a little lower, almost as if sharing a secret.  “Amuse me for a second - if you were, you know, able to actually meet an angel and you figured, hey they’re not so bad, or whatever - what would you do?” He had to know, was what he was doing so terrible? For his dad, absolutely, he was sure of it, but to Sammy?
Cas sat up even straighter, but Dean, still leaning over him, didn’t move. They were mere inches apart now, their body heat almost buzzing with electricity between them, both of them bare-chested, and completely unprivy to the cold January night. They were so close. If Dean took a deep breath, he was sure their lips would meet, and his shallow breathing fastened, aching for Dean to fill his lungs. Aching to be closer to Cas. Their eyes were unblinking, in a staring contest and Dean didn’t know what the winning prize was, but he wasn’t about to lose. And it was easy, like breathing, or falling asleep, losing himself in Castiel’s eyes - like the deepest of oceans, like the clearest of crystals - and he didn’t want to wake up.
“Oh, wow” It was incredible, and Dean couldn't understand how he’d failed to see it at first, it was clear as day. “What else is up there?” He sat back up, and Cas looked amused, like watching a kid that couldn’t stand still, and sat back up with him.
“Whoa, wait, heaven doesn’t have unlimited fast food?’” Dean dramatically put his hand over his heart.
Castiel followed his every move and undoubtedly noticed when Dean tried to play it cool through the pain. But Dean could feel his eyes on him and made extra effort to play it off like it didn’t really hurt.
They walked back to their cars with Sam supporting Dean’s shoulder again. The dark street started spinning before Dean’s eyes so he didn’t protest when Sam suggested driving.
the words had lived in his head since their talk in the dark bedroom. He knew that Dean didn’t dislike him, Cas would even go as far as to say they enjoyed each other's company, but to think Dean enjoyed being around him as much as he liked being around Dean? That was a nonsensical thought, dangerous even, and he couldn’t allow it to grow roots in his mind.
Sam and Dean shared a look before they both burst out in laughter. It was no surprise that Bobby had gotten into trouble for using colorful language to give someone a piece of his mind.
The angel rolled his eyes, but he didn’t try to argue with him. Instead, he sat back against the couch, his body relaxed until Dean’s feet touched his legs with enough pressure for Cas to know he was planning to place his legs there.
“Just a little further. Some of the trees have been warded-” Cas’s breath was ragged but he spoke fast, anyway, unaffected by the lack of air in his lungs, “, that’s why they were running after us and not using any power.”
Sam took off at around eleven, even though Dean had practically begged him to stay, he told him he was tired. “You didn’t really dig any graves tonight, did you?”
“You hunters sure seem to enjoy your barley,” Curt paused in thought. “But yes, why not indulge a little?”
He waited in his car until it was exactly 12 pm. He cut off the engine, and with it the Rolling Stones hit. When stepped out of the impala he looked around for Castiel.
, Dean thought. His plan to ask Castiel about all his burning questions seemed fucking laughable all of a sudden. However, calling the angel here to say nothing at all was even more idiotic.
“Sam!” Dean hissed down the stairs, a voice so low his dad had to have superpowers to hear him. But Sam was awake, and he could damn well hear it, he was just ignoring him, apparently. “Sam, you’re not coming.” He continued, down the stairs.
“Uriel,” Gabriel acknowledged him like a cow would a butcher. “He can expect all he wants, I am an archangel, I do not answer to him.” He raised his voice, trying to show them the potential of his full power, anger erupted in blue waves around him. It wasn’t doing him much good but at least it was enough to make some of the lower pay grades stand back, even flinch a little. There had been a time when archangels were respected, feared, and rulers of Heaven, but now, Gabriel was the last one standing, and it made for pretty terrible leverage.
“Dean...” His name on Cas’s lips, in a whispered apology for a crime that was not his, almost sent him crumbling down, losing all control over his emotions. Tears threatened to cloud his vision, so he looked up instinctively at the ceiling, there was no way in hell he’d let Cas see him cry. Still, the way Cas spoke, so softly, so tender, hit him like a cinder block and left him a disheveled mess.
“Information, of course.” Michael's lips curled into a smile. “Your father was the expert they called to extract information from me, and when his ways failed, obviously, he asked me if there was anything that would make me talk, any information that would make me spill all of Heaven’s secrets.”
“Of course, my little brother,” Metatron picked a single flower from one of the nearest cherry blossoms.
“Good, because I left it in that Vonnegut book and I wasn’t sure you’d find it.” Dean interrupted him, a noise rolling off his tongue that Castiel could only assume was a nervous laugh. “Are you still staying at that motel?” Dean was in an apparent urge to speak of anything, it seemed. “Across from the Mischievous Woman or whatever it’s called.”
Six figures stood, on one side, still and unmoving, like stone statues long-forgotten in an abandoned garden, not even the threat of a thunderstorm making them move an inch.
“Were you sent to torture me?” Dean guessed. That was the only sensible explanation. Heaven wanted Dean to tell them all the city’s secrets. “Because I can tell you right now! You’ve got the wrong guy. I won’t tell you fucking jack shit!”
“I know,” Dean toyed with one of the cleaning rods on the table. “I was just wondering if you and the others had gotten anywhere with Michael yet.”
He turned the water on, counting on his hands how many weeks had been, and gasped in shock when he was already counting months. This wasn’t normal for him, going so long without some sort of sexual contact - be it a one night stand with some bimbo, or a sloppy handjob from some dude who made him, or the occasional make-out session with some deeply closeted hunter back in the city, who’d swear him to secrecy afterwords. And in the past 3 months,
The angel on top of him was massive and completely unrelenting in trying to pierce the blade into Dean. He was hissing something in a language Dean recognized but didn’t understand, the language he knew Cas was fluent in, which made him think, in a panic, ‘
“Yes,” Castiel seemed worried, like he was expecting someone to jump out at them any minute.  “Like you said I have to be more careful now that the hunters are sending out extra patrols.”
It took him way too long to think of anything to answer that, and the moment was gone, he had been completely and utterly seized by it, and had it been just a slip of the tongue, a moment’s worth of weakness, or simply a play on words he did not understand, Castiel didn’t know, what he did know was that he’d hear those words forever, they were carved into his soul.
“Who? Jo?” Dean looked over at his brother as he turned down the volume. “You know she’s safer inside the walls.”
“Yeah, okay, that works,” Dean tried hard not to seem impressed by the fact that Castiel just snapped a steel lock with his bare hands as if it was built from legos.
“So this is it,” Cas’s voice startled him, almost making him spill his coffee. He hadn’t heard him approaching. “Back to work again,” Dean didn’t look at him, it would just make things harder. He knew there was probably no occasion for them to spend as much time together like this again in the future, and that thought left him feeling emptier than it should.
“Of course. Cold, tiredness, pain-” It’d been hard enough to get it out, and Dean was pretty sure Cas was bustin’ his balls.
“Good.” Dean’s hands were clammy, he brushed his palms over his thighs, slapping his knees at the end. “Go team, or whatever, I guess.”
“His name is Metatron, Dean,” he stood corrected. “And, yes, he is the obvious suspect, I just don’t see why he would do such a thing, to kill another angel, the punishment would be worse than death. And even if we assume he’s attempting a coup, he is still an angel, it’s unlikely he would risk the lives of his own kin, however not impossible.”
“Why would you think that?” The lines in Castiel’s forehead creasing, and his shallow breath didn’t register in the mess that was Dean Winchester at the moment.
“Dean,” the name was spoken fondly on his lips, almost whispered, Castiel had not meant to say it. It read as ‘Dean, please calm down, and ‘Dean, I’m right here and ‘ Dean, I’m not going anywhere, but those were all words caught in Castiel’s throat, if he were to say them they would all blurt out in a disorganized speech that would give him away. “You don’t have to worry about me. My brothers and sisters were caught by surprise, but now that we know hunters have gotten hold of angel blades we won’t be as reckless.”
“I’m afraid they need some more convincing,” Uriel said. “Maybe there’s another way to show them that you’re a powerful leader. What about those hunters within that city that are threatening to ruin your plan?”
“Funny you should ask,” the corners of her mouth turned into a smile, “because I followed him into town, right into a strip club called ‘the Shady Lady’.” Dean’s whole body stiffened at the mention of that place, his interest suddenly growing. He nodded along for her to continue. “And hell, I figured he was just a creep, but I followed him in anyway. The thing is, he was there less than five minutes and when he came out, he wasn't wearing the same clothes anymore, he was dressed like was going to a weird costume party or something. I figured maybe he was into some weird roleplay, but something told me to keep following him. I walked after him through the streets, but when I turned a corner just seconds after he did, he was gone. Just vanished into thin air.” She looked incredulous, “I’m telling you,” Dean licked his bottom lip, thinking. This couldn’t mean what he was thinking it could. Could it? He glanced over at Sam who was just plain staring at him at this point, like he was waiting for Dean to get to the same conclusion. “He was nowhere to be found, believe me, I looked for hours.”
Dean plopped down on the couch, a beer in his right hand. His eyes scanned the room for any more possible distractions, but there were none. He couldn’t remember when his leg had started bouncing up and down, but it was the only thing keeping him from actually pacing around the room.
“What do you mean?” For a second Dean panicked, what if Castiel had noticed the effect this was all having on his body, to the point where he couldn’t sleep.
“Oh come on! You son of a bitch.” Dean kicked the nearest object in his range and scolded again when the object turned out to be solid rock.
“Where do you think you’re going?” John’s voice pierced through Dean’s eardrum like a drill sergeant's command. He sounded angry, even more so than usual. He really didn’t want to do this now, he’d felt so cheerful just moments before, but it didn’t seem like his dad would just drop it.
Dean thought about this for a moment, trusting an angel to do any mojo on him again seemed like a bad idea. But why would it lie after everything it had already done for him and Sam?
The warmth of the booze inside created a fake bravado, all of his doubts and fears suddenly washed away, the memory of their blowout, faint in the back of his mind, the only resemblance to where they were now was the closeness, except this time, he was anything but terrified, and he trusted the angel completely this time around.
“As long as Michael is unavailable,” Metatron began somberly, but quickly developing into a meek conclusion “I’m afraid it is a burden I must accept.”
He waited and he looked around again. There was no sign that Castiel might have heard him, but then why would there be? Whether Cas had heard him or not, there was no way that they would meet each other again soon. Dean wanted to deny that he felt empty at the thought of never seeing Castiel again, but he couldn’t. Whatever crap bonding had happened between them had royally fucked with his perception of angels. Well, at least his perception of one angel.
The angel’s demeanor didn’t change, it rarely did. Michael’s expression resembled that of a father at his kids’ terrible soccer game, bored and considerably annoyed.
Castiel could see Dean, now, easing into the presence of a safe and sound Castiel, and carrying bags full of fast-food. So Castiel figured he’d add more, try to get him in a better mood, “Not to mention that I am a superb soldier, great with a blade, I highly doubt any of the hunter training would be enough to take me on.” He let a smug grin pierce his lips and watched, delighted, as Dean’s grimace shifted into a look of amusement and offense at the same time, exaggeratedly laying a hand over his heart.
Castiel was now only inches away from him, eyes desperately searching his own. He wondered for a second if anyone had ever passed away from an exploding heart because his felt like it was about to give out,
In the afternoon Dean decided they’d watch a movie, one of his favorites obviously, because if Cas had seen zero movies, then he would make it his personal mission that he only see great movies.
Gracy's diner was definitely one of Dean's favorite places to enjoy a good burger. Dean licked his lips at the sight in front of him; a beer, bacon cheeseburger, and a slice of apple pie. The cute waitress he just chatted up was about to finish her shift. He grinned, life was good.
“It’s a human superstition thing, it’s basically a good luck charm, supposed to ward off evil and sickness and all that stuff.” Dean let out a laugh, “can’t say it’s done me much good in that department, but my little brother gave it to me.” He didn’t know why he mentioned Sam again near the angel, he really shouldn’t.
“In all seriousness, though, Dean,” Sam looked at him, hand on the door handle, before pulling it open. “I’m afraid to even mention this around you,” he paused, obviously for (over) dramatic effect, and spoke his next words carefully, “you might just be falling in love with the guy.” Sam pushed the door open and stepped inside, leaving Dean back, dumbfounded.
“I’ve felt human emotions my whole life, and, hell, it still scares the shit out of me.” He said, anyway.
“So as you may have heard, Michael is still locked away in the city of losers and Metatron has made exactly zero effort to free him so I did a little digging and I discovered that he spends a lot of time sneaking around with Uriel. Now either they’re in some distasteful love affair or they’re up to something, and I’m honestly praying for the latter.”
“Dean” He heard Cas mumble his name, but it was barely a whisper. He hurried down the steps, careful not to fall face down. As soon as his eyes adapted to the darkness, he saw it. Cas stood in front of an iron cage, and Gabriel was hanging on the other side, motionless. Dean moved over to stand next to Castiel, staring at the sight in front of them, unable to say anything.
“I don’t take offense. He is very complicated,” Castiel couldn’t exactly reduce Metatron to, as Dean put it ‘being a douchebag’, he was cunning and rarely did anything without good reason - which was not so say it was the same as a
Thank you for reading chapter 4! I think it's my favorite chapter so far, but I'd love to know what you think.
“Please, laugh at my expense,” Bobby said sarcastically, but a small smile on his lips betrayed him.
He remembered that night, sitting on the sidewalk of some sleazy motel, deciding he needed to see Castiel, just to be sure there was nothing there, nothing but a somewhat weird, secret, friendship between a hunter and an angel. The last time he’d seen Cas, though, at the lake, he felt himself get closer to this being, and at the time it was easy enough to let his guard down, to get closer, and to let himself be
“Look, maybe if you ask your mom beforehand next time you can join us on a routine mission,” Sam said apologetically. Dean wanted to kick him in the leg.
“You can’t just-” He felt the collar of his t-shirt suddenly tightening around his neck, the heat in the bathroom getting to him, rising from his chest to his face as he awkwardly gestured Cas to sit back down, and yet he stood still, head tilting to the side a bit, obviously intrigued by Dean’s sudden dismantling.
“He sounds lovely,” Jo smiled at him, a warm tone in her voice, a bit different from what he was used to hearing from her usual sassy banter “I can see why you like him.”
Somehow during their conversation, the bus had passed right by them. Sam had been so caught up in the ins-and-outs of Dean’s love life, or the lack thereof, that he’d just nudged Dean to keep walking, and so they would go the whole way on foot.
The first few days after leaving the cabin, the hours seemed endless, stretching for far longer than Dean felt they should be.
Dean felt confused at the order for a moment, still not used to them, but he followed Cas’ lead as he turned on the log, and lay his back against the wood. Dean mimicked him, laying down, his head slightly brushed against Castiel’s, their feet hanging from their respective ends of the log that was clearly too short for both men to lay completely.
Cas stepped away from him, and made his way into the kitchen area, staring at the cupboard and the displayed utensils.
“What should we do about Curt, or Metatron or whatever the son of a bitch’s name is?” Jo brought up a great point. “Because telling anyone might just be the thing that tips the scale and sets this whole thing off.”
This hadn’t been the first time something like this had happened, and it probably wouldn’t be the last. This type of unspoken conversations and support were the pillars of their whole childhood, so they had gotten pretty good at the whole non-communication-communicating thing.
When they were sure no one was close enough to hear them anymore, they let out a relieved sigh in unison, and while Dean wanted to address the fact that he was shocked to have seen his father in the midst of what he was sure was something really questionable, he had no idea what to say.
The flash of light he saw earlier, could it be? His eyes scanned the room again but there were no signs of anyone else in the room. Dean was completely alone, left with yet another magically healed wound and another chunk of his memory missing.
“Are you going to answer me or not?” Dean pressed, pretending to sound at least equally as threatening.
“Fine.” Sam said, “Details later. Jo, will you tell him?” He pointed, palm side up, to Jo, as if to give her the floor. She leaned against the kitchen counter, and she looked older than Dean had ever seen her. Not that she looked any different, it was just as if he was seeing her in an entirely new light, her face like stone, and her expression unreadable. Cold even. There was something weighing on her shoulders.
Dean laughed and started cooking away. Cas kept reading. Dean looked at him, over his shoulder, and as glad as he was that Cas was staying put and not going out into the possible hunting grounds of the newly weaponized hunters of the City, he wasn’t sure it was because of
sounded, he despised the way he must look in Cas’ eyes, like a child, whining and crying that he got tricked by the older kids, still, he couldn’t give a rat’s ass at the moment, he needed Castiel to hear him, and for better or worse, have him set the record straight.
Dean tried his best not to look caught off guard. Though it wasn't the words that shook him, it was the deep, menacing voice that had spoken them.
“I know, it’s just a classic pickup line.” Dean laughed at how clueless the angel could be, even if he found it amusing, more than annoying.
“You’re gonna catch a fly.” Dean joked, easing the mood, once he'd finished. Jo closed her mouth. Dean took another bite of his pizza. It’d gone cold. “What do you have for me?” He looked away from her, leaving her to process the whole thing, and turning his attention to Sam who looked about done with his doodling.
That was not something that was done, humans couldn’t see their wings for good reason, and the act of allowing one to see them was much more meaningful than Dean even considered. It was a doting memory and looking back, Dean’s reaction had been, assuredly, worth it, he had stared at them, all jaw hanging and whispered praises and Castiel would ravel in the memory forever. It wasn’t so innocent that he’d brought them back here.
“C’mon Cas, let’s go” he almost giggled. It sounded like a giggle, didn’t it? Dean mentally slapped himself on the mouth, and that nickname,
He knew perfectly well Bobby didn’t know about the ambush before it happened - he had seen his reaction, and there was no doubt about it. But there was something Bobby could know.
“Yeah, right, because I’m a dainty schoolgirl who had one too many wine coolers.” If Cas hadn’t wanted to kiss him, it wasn’t because he was too drunk, it was because he just didn’t want to do it.
Unsure of what to do with himself, he sat down at the small table next to the window. The cabin really wasn’t much to take in, made up entirely of wood, with little to no decorating elements, there wasn’t a lot to look at, a large leather couch that had seen better days, right across from him; a fireplace that kept the place warm in the winter, now filled with ashes, but a scent still lingering in the air; a small kitchenette with the essentials, with some weird appliances that Cas knew were used to cook food on, but couldn’t, for the life of him, figure out how to work; and the table he was sitting at. On the other side of the room, a door was opened to the only room in the cabin, revealing a small double bed, neatly made, where Castiel was sure many girls had spent the night. Other than the bed, the room had a bathroom, and nothing else.
Welcome back to another chapter, and yes it was another long one! There was some long-overdue angst in this chapter because well, this is a supernatural fic after all. As always I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it in the comments!
“Yeah, I’ll be down in five,” Dean said. He kicked his legs out from under the covers and tried to shake the anxious feeling in his stomach. It was just a bad fucking dream, that was all. No need to go soul searching and find a deeper meaning behind it all, something Sam would likely suggest.
“Gabriel,” Castiel greeted his brother. The wooden floor of a boat churned beneath his feet with the current. That Gabriel always insisted on meeting in remote locations he could understand, but why they had to be so arbitrary he didn’t know.
There were the angel blades, at least two in case Cas had lost his own, and then a Sig Sauer across his back, a beretta CX4, and a whole lot of ammo stuffed in his duffel.
He could remember the first time he’d went way over his orders and saved Dean from a nasty fall - he’d fallen, hit his head, and lay there bleeding on the floor, and at this point, Castiel had been watching him for months, at the command of Michael, watching over  Hunter’s City.
“He does? That’s not the Cassie I know, he must really like you.” Gabriel’s voice preceded his manifestation, just behind Dean, and it was not possible to keep a straight face at the way Dean jumped across the room, even if Gabriel’s words targeted Castiel as a victim. He hoped Dean hadn’t registered what he actually said.
consisted in a significant change. He wanted them to appear, now, like angels who would grant favors to humans, but meanwhile slowly gaining all control over them. This was just one of the many changes Metatron was aiming for, and none of them promised a peaceful transition, Castiel knew the humans, the hunters in particular, when they would figure out what was happening, they wouldn’t sit idly by, it was evident a war was to come if Metatron was not stopped.
Dean had to concentrate on keeping a straight face a few times because the sight of a powerful angel looking so lost in a sea of bubbles was probably one of the funniest things he had ever seen. And he had been there during Sam’s awkward emo teen phase. But this?
before you interrupted, Curt explained that it needed to be as far away from Michael as humanly possible, as there was always a risk of the thing floating back into him, or something.” Bobby got up with a grunt, heavily supporting his bad hip. He turned to one of the shelves behind him, aiming right at something (how that was possible, in the absolute mess of a system he had, Dean didn’t know.)
“You’re an angel right?” It sounded like a question when it shouldn’t, he gave him no time to answer. “Aren’t you supposed to have you know, wings and whatnot? Isn’t that the whole package deal, fluffy wings, and halos?”
The mention of his father took Dean by surprise, his arms crossed over his chest, and he took a step forward, to stand closer, looking down on the angel. “What do you know about my father?”
He took a good, long, look at John. He wasn’t looking so great himself. From what Dean had managed to get in, he looked pretty shaken up, his face not looking better than Dean’s, he was breathing pretty heavily, flushed and sweating. If he was as hurt as he looked, Dean could,
“- Brothers, sisters,” Metatron vociferated, he held up both of his hands as if to calm the altercation. “Let not this tragedy drive us further apart, but let it help us reunite Heaven in the way our Father intended it.”
“Don’t you see enough horror on a daily basis?” Sam didn't look up from his laptop screen while talking to his brother.
“Well fellas, while this was fun. I don’t feel like getting eaten alive tonight, sorry to disappoint.”
Dean had woken up safe and sound in his bed that night. He had healed completely from his fall, and it would have looked as if it had never happened if it wasn’t for the small white scar that marked his right eyebrow.
“There must be something we can do to make you feel better,” Sam frowned, but then his face turned into a smile as if he just came up with a great idea. “How about we drive to Welldale, they have those burgers you like right? The best bacon cheeseburgers around?”
Castiel wasn’t sure about any of this, all he knew was that he trusted Gabriel, and he trusted Michael. And he desperately needed to protect humans from heaven’s politics, all of them, humans didn’t deserve to die for this -
“Cas, I think you went a little overboard here,” Dean said as he gestured to the layers of clothing.
“You always think people are being shady, Bobby, ain’t no surprise there. They gotta save your life or die trying before you give them the time of day.” Ellen told him, half-serious, half-joking while she passed Sam the wedges.
Finally a new chapter, sorry for the wait, but it's an important chapter and we wanted to do it right. Plus, life kind of got in the way. Still, I hope you like it and that it makes up for the long wait.
“Because,” Dean started, getting to his feet again with Cas’s help, “you’re not always gonna be around to fix me every time I go and fuck myself up.” It was the type of reasoning Castiel couldn’t understand, but he knew better, by now, than to argue with Dean about it. He could be really pig-headed when he wanted to. “I’ll just walk it off, c’mon Cas.” And just like that, he was prancing away, even if limping a little, looking back at Castiel with a stupid grin.
They ate dessert in silence, well apart from the occasional hum to compliment Ellen’s baking. When he thought he could get away with it, Dean made his way out to the back porch to drink his beer in peace and quiet. He couldn’t have been out there for more than minutes when his quiet was interrupted by the opposite of peacefulness.
Dean made sure to walk deep into the forest, far away from patrols, before he started shouting. The last thing he needed was to be seen talking to an angel, good luck explaining that one to his dad and commander Barnes.
He tried to shrug get out of his jacket, but it was proving hard to do, his arms weren’t cooperating as he needed them to, and his head felt heavy, his eyes heavier even, and the room kept spinning. Losing his balance he gripped whatever closest to him, which turned out to be Cas’s arm, who reacted by sliding his arm behind Dean’s back, supporting almost all his weight, like it was nothing.
With every hour passing Dean grew more anxious, just waiting for his dad to walk through the door at any moment. There was no telling what would happen. Sometimes he’d ignore Dean for days, weeks even, pretending Sam was his only child, other times, he just beat him until submission, and every so often he’d get Dean a beer and drink one himself as if to say “let’s put this behind us”.
“I guess you could say that,” there was no possible scenario in which he would take this smile away from Dean. Not when it made him have a smile of his own.
He had other things to worry about at the moment. He needed to stop this. He ran into the bedroom, and then into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
Dean reached his arm to put the plate down on the floor, a movement that wasn’t agreeing with his body and he winced in pain. He was sure he had a few busted ribs and that was probably gonna hurt like a mother for the next few weeks.
Cas grabbed the towel and wrapped it around his waist as he clumsily threw one leg over the bathtub brim, and then the other, water still trickling down his bare torso. The towel hung, barely hanging on, on Castiel’s hips. The V-like muscle glistened with the remnants of soap, just above where the towel folded in. He was able to get a steady hold on the wet floor, carefully not to slip, and positioned himself in front of Dean, his back to the door and facing the mirror over the sink.
“I’m not saying it is all going to be a delight served on a silver platter,” Metatron replied with a nearly childish tone, he didn't appear phased by their comments at all. “I’m saying that we should earn their trust before we can successfully apply our new rules…”
“Cas?” It came out more like a broken whisper, but Dean didn’t care. He didn’t care what the angel thought of him in this moment, because Cas was alive, he was
Castiel hesitated for a second, “yes, of course”. He wasn’t a fool, he had expected this to happen at some point, and definitely after his last conversation with Uriel. It wasn’t in his nature to be two-faced, let alone deceiving, and now he found himself in need to do so - it was imperative that Metatron was convinced he was on his side, for Gabriel’s plan to work.
“Yes, he is one of the few angels I would trust with my life,” Castiel said as if he had just mentioned something casual.
Dean frowned, once again the fine line between awkward and acceptable didn’t hold up between them. However, he couldn’t argue with the angel’s logic so he just rolled with it. Sure, it felt a little weird to lift his shirt over his head, and kick off his boxers with Cas sitting right there but the angel seemed still like a statue.
Once again Dean found himself wishing that he had more self-control and cursed his eyes for not being able to look away from Castiel’s body. His eyes darted over the muscles in his chest, the amulet Cas always wore, down to the muscles in his stomach
All the hunters older than 18 could join training five days a week. And when they weren’t in dangerous circumstances, everyone got to go home during the weekend. People who didn’t fit the age category, or weren’t capable of fighting lived in the outer circle. Because of the city’s size, the outer circle was divided into zones; Alpha, Beta, Charlie, Delta, and Echo. Each zone held a watchtower which were all connected by a tall, wooden barrier wall. Unknown to most, an intentional pattern, existing out of pure iron, ran from all five towers across each other, forming a giant pentagram. While this sounds like a nice little touch of decoration, it actually served a purpose. Because what most outsiders didn’t know was that the real meaning behind their city’s name; Hunters' City, was exactly what it sounds like, a city full of hunters. But the hunters didn’t chase after deer, they were not after animals at all for that matter. They protected the people from the real evil out in the world. The evil that some people might speak of as the boogeyman in children’s books. Apart from the fact that these monsters didn’t (normally) live in other people’s closets, most of them did actually roam the earth freely. Demons, werewolves, vampires, skinwalkers, wendigo’s, witches, and well, the list goes on. Though that was nothing compared to their current enemy. The enemy that no one could have foreseen. An enemy that history had spoken of greatly in holy books, and humans had built places for to worship their power. And while their existence had been contemplated, their loyalty had never been questioned before.
The kiss deepened as their tongues met at last, clashing against each other, dancing while trying to flavor every inch of each other. Dean’s hands gripped hard at the angel’s back, holding on tighter, like he was afraid that if he didn’t, Cas would suddenly disappear into thin air again. Cas made a small gasping sound at the pressure, a sound that sent a ripple effect of fluttering up his back and down his legs.
“Easy to talk, you’re the one with the flashlight,” Dean muttered softly. Either his dad didn’t hear it, or he chose to ignore it.
I also want to thank my amazing friend and writer PB165 for helping me out when I get sick of my own writing, she's amazing!
He’d said it to Cas before leaving so hastily. He never did check in. And that thought kept him awake.
But when he did, Dean’s expression was caught between surprise and something that oddly enough resembled awe. His mouth was slightly agape, and his eyes big, glued to the crystal he was still holding, that was now emitting a soft blue hue.
“They want us to acknowledge their pain; the apes think that we exist to fulfill their needs, make their miserable little lives meaningful. So we play the part and they will trust us like the blind-”
For a second neither of them moved, and in that moment Dean could swear that Castiel could see right through every part of him. And then, as if by some unspoken rule, they simultaneously leaned back into the couch, the acceptable space back in between them.
“Yeah, it’s kind of unsettling to see the trucks coming and going, this whole militarization of the city is kind of sinister, isn’t it?” Sam turned his attention to Dean.
It was short and informative, but right now he didn't care about the lack of update, because Cas was alive. He sighed in relief. That son of a bitch had better come up with a great explanation for going radio silent on him.
“Because I’m asking you to, or rather I’m telling you to Jo. If you decide to tell anyone I will make damn sure you won’t see the outside of these walls in a very long time”
“No thanks, you're not really my type.” Gabriel was known to be immature, and almost none of the angels appreciated this quality.
“What about me, Cas?” His voice was so small he could barely hear it, he wasn’t sure it had even escaped his lips or if Cas had even heard it, he wasn't sure if he even wanted Cas to have heard it.  He hated how it trembled and how lost he sounded.
Dean’s brow furrowed, trying to comprehend what it was that Cas was saying, urgently trying to catch his eyes as Cas made his best effort to look anywhere but at him.
“I’m sure by this time tomorrow everything will be a mess. But if we don’t find the grace tonight, we still have to sleep, and still have to wait for things to escalate. I know you’re restless, but it won’t do you any good to just keep flying around. You’re in the big leagues now, you should lay low until it’s time to fight.” Dean paused for a second before adding, “If it comes to it.”
“She’s beautiful, I can see the resemblance,” Cas smiled at him and Dean instantly felt the heat rising on his neck and up to his cheeks.
It seemed so real, Dean could feel the warmth of the sun hitting his bare skin, and before he even opened his eyes, he could feel the weight of a body pressed to his, the flicker of a breath on the back of his neck. He was afraid to move, as if he’d turned around to face him, Cas would be gone, just a ruffle of feathers ringing in his ears, or worse, he was afraid that if he opened his eyes to meet Cas’s, he would wake up. So he did neither - he let the reminiscents of his dream sway him in a state between half asleep and half awake.
All the while Castiel stood staring at him like he was afraid Dean was going to collapse. Dean finally managed to pull himself together, but not without having to wipe away a few tears from his eyes.
“Better now,” he paused, going around Dean to close the door behind him. “You really did a number on him,” his tone wasn’t accusatory, more like a statement. Dean kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for Sam to ask about the fight, what had happened and why he wasn’t all battered and bruised, but there was nothing.
Dean’s breathing was ragged and failing him more with every passing second, like he couldn’t catch his breath. He could hear the distant noise of the angels looking for them, the leaves and sticks cracking under their feet. Time was running out on this conversation, but Dean was sure Cas wouldn’t start being careful with himself
The demon, seemingly not impressed by Dean’s words judging from the look on him, threw another punch in the direction of Dean’s face. Dean anticipated the blow and dodged it by ducking underneath the arm of the demon, bringing the hand still holding the demon blade up with enough force to bury it in the demon’s chest. A deafening scream echoed through the hallway and the bright yellow light followed.
There. The words hung in the air like a heavy, wet blanket, over them, and Dean’s eyes slowly widened in sudden clarity -
There was no way in hell that this hunt was a three-person job. There was no need for the three of them to stick together in this tiny cramped hallway. And there was definitely no fair answer as to why John hadn’t let Dean out of his sight for a single second.
I also figured some of you may be wondering how long this fic is gonna be, and the truth is I'm not sure yet. We are definitely over the halfway point and I've always known where I want the story to go, the question that remains is just when it'll get there. Just a heads up, sadly there won't be a new chapter next week as I am overflowing with deadlines and I should probably take responsibility for them, sorry about that! But don't worry because after I'll go back to uploading every Tuesday.
He told himself this had nothing to do with Cas, that this was nothing more than curiosity, something important to learn about angels in general. But deep down he knew that was a lie, even though he had no idea what answer he was hoping for. If angels weren’t able to feel things, like humans, there was nothing he could do, and might as well just befriend a rock; on the other hand, if they were, in fact, able to reciprocate certain feelings, well then, that just made him feel like crap because it’d mean that Cas could feel the same way Dean did, he just didn’t - and that possibility hurt like a son of a bitch.
For thousands of years he’d had no problem doing whatever was necessary, unpreoccupied with moral values and choices - that was never his job, his job was to do whatever he was expected to, he was a soldier in a war, a puppet on strings, heaven’s personal gun, fired in a direction and he’d shoot. He fought for Heaven whatever that might’ve meant. And now, Heaven was divided, angels having to make decisions they weren’t prepared to make, taking action into their hands, this was all headed down a dangerous path.
When he had left Cas the note it had been a shot in the dark, he’d been busy worrying if Cas would even show up at the cabin to read it, and even if he did, Dean didn’t know if the angel would actually still want to talk to him. Well as it turned out, Dean had been worrying about the wrong things, and while he was relieved to see that Cas was still gracious enough to pretend nothing had happened, nothing could have prepared Dean for how awkward he felt in this moment.
“Let’s go,” Cas carefully pushed the door open and they slid inside, and after closing the door behind them Dean pulled the light string that hung from the ceiling. Looking around they realized the whole floor was covered in cardboard boxes
“I do, yes,” Castiel wasn’t scared of him, in the least, in fact, Metatron had never been a fear-striking angel, his appearance was all but menacing, he presented as short looking, facially hairy, involved in a thick layer of adipose tissue, he wasn’t anything like the other angels. But still, Castiel knew better than to make him his enemy - at least for the time being.
They made their way to Metatron’s office in silence, Castiel wasn’t surprised to see that Metatron had gotten comfortable in Michael’s old office. It wasn’t a matter of convenience, because Metatron could easily alter his own corner of Heaven to create an even bigger and more imposing office, no this was about exerting power.
“Look, about the other night,” Dean started, the bravery he felt just seconds before seemed to laugh in his face. Cas’s presence in the passenger seat was a lot, and he actually felt nervous.
“ ‘M fine Cas, besides I’d be shit company if I just fell asleep right now,” his words were more of a mumble as he tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes, obviously it didn’t work.
Rufus nodded. “Yeah, well, you tell Jo she still has to come talk to me, ya hear me?” Rufus was already turning his back on him. Dean said his goodbyes, and Rufus added something about the Beretta being a great choice of gun but how the kickback was a son of a bitch “Better give that one to Sam, that boy got shoulders for it.”
Suddenly he remembered hearing the other voice in the room, he looked around to find someone that it could belong to, but there was no one there.
Dean would only allow him to look back in quick glances, just long enough to make sure they weren’t being followed, and if they were, how close the sons of bitches were. He felt like a thin barrier between Cas and the other angels, a wall they would have to break through to get to Cas, even if it was a frail one. He was sure, as he ran, that they would have to kill him to touch Cas, and he found some solace in that thought, that he could be the one to save Cas, to give him time, to give him a chance to get away if that came to be.
Castiel thought, Dean didn’t look as irritated by Gabriel’s request as Castiel would’ve thought he would be.
The morning sun was still enough to have natural light inside the cabin, the leftover pancakes from breakfast laid forgotten on the kitchen countertop.
“You’re talking about this like they’ve fought in wars,” that was an aspect Dean had never considered, he’d just assumed that because he didn’t know of any angel wars besides maybe the one currently about to burst, there hadn’t been any.
“I'm proud of you,” Bobby added before tossing him back in, ruffling his hair, and slamming the door.
“You remember what we talked about?” Dean tried to shake the feeling away, looking somewhere other than their hands.
about the things they cared about, such earthly, meaningless items they seemed to obsess over - wheels, cars… burgers… - and he tried and tried to understand, to feel what they felt, and sometimes he succeeded. Music, for instance, had been around for centuries, even the cavemen hummed melodies to keep warm. And watching from above, Castiel had tried to mimic it, never quite accomplishing it, until one day somewhere in the fifteen hundreds a boy in a village had prayed, singing ever so slightly, and he’d heard it - it resonated with him so much, that he finally understood music. And the kind of high he felt when that happened was unlike any other he’d ever felt in heaven - he actually
He turned his attention to the books that were scattered across the table, most of them held titles that suggested their content focused on lore - Cas smiled in an almost laugh, he knew Dean’s talk about how his brother was the bookworm was mostly for show, and here was the proof, -  there was also a book by the author Kurt Vonnegut, the spine creased and the pages worn out, it looked like it had been read over and over again, and he recalled Dean going on about his books on multiple occasions. Curious about its content, Castiel picked up the book, and a small folded piece of paper fell at his feet.
The girl nodded, and with a smile gestured to him to follow, as she made her way down the block. Dean promptly did so, just a step or two behind, his hands in his pockets.
“Yeah, well they’re doing a pretty fucked up job so far,” Dean huffed. Not letting his mind trail back to the exception he knew was out there.
“Is it true you sent me there, thinking I’d just free Michael?” Dean’s hand tightened around the beer bottle in his hand, throwing it on the floor before it shattered in his hand, the crashing of the glass against the pavement ringing in both their ears. “Do you think I’m that stupid?”
an inferior species Dean, that is not the point! The point is that even though you are, I have trusted you, I have shared with you matters that would have me killed. And to stand here, accusing me of things I have never considered,” In a split second Castiel’s whole body launched at him, pressing his arm against Dean’s chest, pinning him against the wall   “- and you think, what? That I’ve been manipulating you? Is that what you think?” He’d lost his patience now, Dean had never seen him so angry, in fact, he had never seen him show this much emotion.
For someone who had been around since the creation of everything, months were not even comparable to minutes in a human’s experience. Yet it was almost as if the memories before
He fired again, two shots this time. Making sure the bullets hit their target, they did. But the figure showed the same lack of any injury.
“I’ll explain later, Sam, promise. I gotta go now.” He rushed through the goodbye and hung up before Sam could get another word in. He felt lighter somehow, like a weight he'd been carrying had been temporarily lifted off his shoulders.
"That seems to be the answer a lot these days," Dean looked out into the hallway. He could have sworn he just saw something move, but maybe it was just the concussion making him see things.
He waited patiently, his eyes occasionally drifting to the door, always expecting Dean to just barge right in. Eventually, his gaze turned back to the items on the table, the bitter scent of the cold coffee filled his nose and even though Castiel had started to appreciate human foods and drinks, this would probably never be one he’d enjoy, not as Dean drank it, at least, dark and bitter.
It took him a second to notice that Sam was standing in his doorway, his expression somewhat amused.
One month passed without much news from outside the walls and there was no progress in extracting information from Michael. Dean remembered learning about the angel Micheal in school. He was one of the four archangels and the leader of all other angels, he was said to be one of the most powerful.
“Doing the right thing, especially when everyone you know is about to do the wrong one, is damn hard.” This was not what he was expecting to hear.
“Look just because someone can kick your ass in training doesn’t mean she would do better out doing the real thing.”
He let his breath even, slowly breathing in and out to calm down. He was torn. He could admit it to himself, at least. This had never happened before- no one had ever made him doubt even for a second, that if it meant protecting his family, he was prepared to give anything away, his happiness would never get in the way of him doing the right thing. This was the first time he felt like he could almost get a glimpse of his own happiness, and now he wasn't so sure.
They dropped the conversation pretty quickly after that. Dean had no idea what to say, and Castiel seemed more focused on thinking, and staring out of the window rather than talking about it. So he let the angel have his time, he wouldn’t mention it again until Cas would bring it up.
It was 2 pm by the time Dean finished training, but there wasn’t a single part of him that wanted to go home already. It wasn’t often that John was home instead of working on a case. Dean knew that his dad didn’t like being stuck at home and he always ended up taking it out on Dean. However, his dad had been so busy with the recent angel case that work outside of the walls had to wait.
Castiel had told Dean that the place they were looking for was on Chapel street and that it was located near the town center. Would their leader really be hiding something in a church or would it be smarter than that? As they made their way through town, Dean couldn’t help but wonder what angels had to physically hide anyway.
Curt didn’t seem phased by the comment at all, he kept smiling as he spoke, “I’m an open book, honestly”.
So a whole month had passed since they locked Michael away in the angel-proofed prison. “How exactly do you capture an archangel?” had been Sam’s first question, followed by Dean’s question “Where exactly do we keep him?” Sadly none of the hunters they had spoken with had been on the mission that night, none except... their dad. But the chances of Dean capturing an angel all by himself were bigger than getting John Winchester to talk about his missions. Not that he even got much of a chance to ask because their dad was always at the command center.
He looked to his side, still trying not to look in Castiel’s general direction, and found the towels stacked up by the sink. He took another step into the bathroom to reach them, now standing back against the sink, towel in hand.
- he had told the angel, who still seemed unconvinced with the idea that burgers, as Dean had put it, could have been the one thing to resolve every major conflict in history.
As they were walking towards the end of the street Dean immediately noticed that the purple-lit building matched the address Cas was referring to.
Sudden realization hit him like a slap in the face. “Wait, were you worried about me?” Castiel blinked and teethed his bottom lip as not to let a smile appear, Dean would be mad if he smiled, there was no reason for him to smile. None at all.
A note at the beginning this time, because I need to apologize for the delay. I'm so sorry this chapter took so long to upload, I would go into detail about my new job and my thesis deadlines closing in on me but those would sound like excuses! Nevertheless, I hope you will enjoy this chapter now that it's finally here :)
“Angels are capable of some form of emotion, you could call it a moral compass, but they rarely encounter love. And if they do, they often mate for life.” Curt answered nonchalantly. And Dean had to try his best not to choke on his beer, this definitely wasn’t the answer he had been expecting, and he had no idea what to do with this (awful) fact of trivia.
“You should sleep. Tomorrow will be tiring.” He said at last. It wasn’t what Dean was expecting. He didn’t know what he was expecting. But it wasn’t that, at all. “I should go.”
Dean stretched his leg out in front of him, hoping it wasn’t going to give him hell during the three-hour car ride they had ahead of them.
“We should get closer, there’s no way we can see what’s going on from here.” The strategist in Cas awoke, and Dean nodded in agreement.
They hid, crouching next to the tire of the nearest truck, the voices becoming clearer with every second passing as they’d gotten as close as they could without being detected. Dean could see, from his angle, three men making their way out of the warehouse. He elbowed Cas, stepping back so he could see too.
“Well, I think it would be a great idea to let more people in on all those little secrets you guys keep,” Dean said, crossing his arms.
They talked some more about arrangements and contacts down there that he could do with, Sam and Jo tried to lighten the mood, even got a good laugh out of him, but it was nervous laughter more than anything. Jo gave him some useful pointers, - like ‘don’t drink tap water’, or ‘get a bug spray’ - and some not so useful ones, - ‘oh you should go visit this really cool snorkeling station’ and ‘the best place to poop, when you’re a far away from your motel, is always the fancy hotels.’ - ok, maybe the last one was kind of useful. And then Dean said his goodbyes, thanked them again for all the help and told them he needed to go fill Cas in.
That didn’t surprise Dean, it was just a matter of time until he came head to head with his father about being out so much, especially without Sam. He was walking on very thin ice, and one day his lies would catch up with him- someone would eventually see him in town with an unknown face, or maybe someone had already spotted him. Like Jo… He remembered their encounter thinking he should go see her before she spilled the beans - and that’s exactly what he got up to do.
“Watch where you’re going, we don’t want to disturb anything more than we have to,” John said in a low hushed voice.
“Dude you went full Eastwood on the sucker,” Dean said while wiping away a tear from the corner of his eye.
Dean was too tired to argue with this logic, and the fact was that he hadn’t eaten yet, so the thought of anything warm and edible sounded good to him.
It happened just as they were making their way back to the car, they were nearly at the main exit when Dean saw it; a flash of light. It wasn’t bright enough for Sam and Bobby to notice, but then they weren’t looking for something out of the ordinary.
Because if Sam was right, and angels were originally supposed to be the protectors of humans, that meant there was
“Yeah, I needed fresh clothes.” John seemed to shrug off the lack of Dean’s wounds, maybe he was being paranoid, his dad probably just attributed it to Dean being young. “And I’ve been meaning to see you.” That part made Dean’s insides feel strung out, a strange mix of childish joy at having his dad’s attention, but mostly a wary pang in the back of his stomach.
“I could heal your leg if you would want me to,” Castiel reappeared out of nowhere, giving Dean’s heart yet another near cardiac arrest.
“Will you keep your voice down,” he moved his hands up and down, gesturing for Sam to lower his voice. “That’s the whole thing, idiot, we didn’t. We just slept in the same bed together, nothing else happened.” He tried to explain to Sam, still frantic.
Castiel just stared at him, defeated. Perhaps it was the knowledge that he wouldn’t make it, not in this condition. Perhaps Dean had gotten through to him. Whatever it was that made Cas get back up and start running, Dean was glad.
This had to be the most straight-forward, run of the mill, haunting he’d ever seen. Old house in the middle of a farm, new family that had moved in.
A completely stupid - and just crazy enough to work - idea popped into his brain. He took a deep breath and focused on reducing his heart rate. He had to appear completely calm.
“You must be excited for tonight,” his brother patted the spot next to him on the couch as Dean made his way to the fridge to get himself a beer.
“This concerns more than our family relations, Dean. This concerns everyone in Heaven, your city, and maybe even beyond that.”
Dean had paid attention in school to all the lessons about angels, but the truth was that the hunters simply didn’t know a lot about them. He had spent a few hours researching them himself, but when it didn’t give him the immediate answers he was looking for he got bored. Guess he just wasn’t as big of a nerd as Sam.
Dean took another sip, trying to process the unexpected answer. He had thought the books in the city would have some things wrong, but he didn’t expect them to be completely untrue.
Bobby gave him a weird, side-eyed look at that and looked him up and down like he was searching for something he couldn’t really find.
“You have--” Gabriel’s breath hitched like every word was gnawing away at him from the inside out, but he continued, still, “--have to step up Castiel. I’m--” Dean felt the thumps of bodies hitting the ground above their heads, “--dying. Don’t--don’t come back for me.”
He watched as Cas disappeared into the dark, and then took a deep breath when he heard him calling out for Dean to follow.
“I had hoped this day would never come” Metatron wore all black, a suit that differed from his usual ensemble, it gave him a more respectable look and it was, undoubtedly, a statement. He spoke loud and slow, a pained grimace painted across his face, “nevertheless, let it not be neglected that I have been trying to warn you all that this would happen.” He paused, awaiting the reaction that soon spread across the room. The angels were hurt, they were angry and this was the time to feed it. “Humans are ungrateful, selfish, and worst of all they have delusions of grandeur,” Metatron said, and then he added in a lower voice, only for those closest to him, "which is ironic, considering we’re the ones running the show.”
Dean shot up from the bed, Jo had run into them and he hadn’t seen her since. Every curse word under the sun crossed Dean’s mind.
He couldn’t stop his body from leaning against Castiel’s as a hunger washed over him, because this time he didn’t have to push his desire down. He could bask in the way he was pinned between the wall and Cas, every inch of their bodies colliding, he could relish the small sounds that Cas made in the few seconds when their lips parted, before they joined again, always with a renewed sense of wanting.
Dean stepped onto the porch and let the chilly air hit his face. The grass was slightly dewy from where it had been frozen at night, signaling that winter was getting near. But the sun had turned the white frost into small droplets on each individual blade. Dean briefly closed his eyes, letting the morning sun warm his face. Though the wind was crisp and cold, the air felt refreshing. Dean didn’t often find himself enjoying the simple thing in life, but this peaceful morning was pretty damn awesome.
If this was a normal situation, his next step would be to talk to Sam and Bobby, but there was nothing normal here, and they would have questions to which Dean didn’t want to -
“I’m just saying, man, when he finds out, and trust me, he will, he’ll be pissed you didn’t drag him,” Sam argued. “And, he’s the only one who I think dad would even tell about the thing. It’s not like he’d tell any of us.”
“What is it Cas?” What could possibly be so bad that it was making Castiel look even more uncomfortable than normal? The way the angel looked at him made him feel completely uneasy, he knew for certain he wouldn’t like what was coming.
The dark lake resembled a mirror for the full moon and the surrounding stars, it looked absolutely beautiful. It didn’t take Castiel long to find a tree trunk for them to sit on, similar to the one they had sat on, all those weeks ago. Moments with Dean Winchester always felt longer and shorter at the same time. It made him feel as if time were stopped, like he could stay tucked away in these moments forever, and yet, they just kept washing away, like the foam of the days.
“The only way you can get out once you’re in, is with Michael’s help. Now, archangel grace is powerful enough to zap out of there, warding and all. But-” Dean remembered the amulet Cas kept around his neck. His grace. He held it outside of him, as a sort of second battery, he’d told him. So, Dean figured, it was possible to take all of it and hold it on the outside too. It was probably what Curtis-the-angel-hunter-mole was doing himself, to get into the city through the warding. It was entirely possible that Michael had been stripped of his grace so he could be contained.
“Singer, I’m glad you decided to show up to our meetings for once,” Barnes said dryly. His tone made it very clear that he meant quite the opposite.
something - and so, from that moment on he found himself chasing that kind of high over and over again. But this? This kind of interaction with a human? Allowing himself to be seen, and engaging with him, was something completely new - and
“Because Cas,” Dean was confused, and even though he was furious and wanted to stay that way, his voice was small and pleading, with the alcohol making its way into his brain, everything was foggy, and the way Cas stared at him, so vulnerable, looking genuinely hurt made things exponentially worse. “What am I supposed to think, huh? You show up in my life, turn everything upside down, and now -” He looked around, his arms motioning to his surroundings “- here I am, contemplating the betrayal of everyone I know. Sounds like a successful plan to me.” The words purged out of his body, as all his doubts, all his questions finally made their way out, and he hated how it sounded, how
“Yes, I’m aware. But why not ask me to help you?” Castiel said tentatively, hoping the answer wouldn’t hurt him.
He slowly made his way down the hallway when suddenly a door appeared out of nowhere. A strange sound was coming from behind it. The closer Dean got to the door, the louder it became, he finally recognized it as a low growling sound, like an angry dog.
“The thing is, Michael, that there’s intel on the contrary, and where does that leave us? The leader of the angels, saying he knows nothing? You can understand how they don’t believe you.” If Castiel had told him the truth, and god, he wanted to believe he did, there was someone providing false information to the hunters, which meant that Michael was telling the truth, but that was a big
“Alright,” Sam shrugged. “Then I won’t ask again,” his face didn’t show any signs that he felt angry.
The background chatter and clinking of glasses helped him to clear his head, the bourbon in his glass helped too.
The round trip to the nearest grocery store took him about an hour - most of which he spent combing through each and every corridor. Dean wasn’t the ‘make a list and grab the items’ type, at the store, he liked to take his time, he didn’t know what snacks would speak to him as he passed by, he liked giving them all his undivided attention. And he liked to do it alone. Sam was a list guy, and every time they went to the store together,
“How could I? They're all individual bubbles. I can’t just make them all disappear into thin air, I’m not a magician Dean” Castiel’s voice rose a bit louder as he lifted his hands in frustration, and dropped them back down, splashing in the bathwater.
“You okay?” It was a stupid question, he knew that. Of course Cas wasn’t okay. He’d just left his brother to die. If it was him, he’d be drinking himself into a stupor.
By the time dinner was ready, Dean’s stomach was growling so loud it was almost painful. Despite the awkward air between Bobby and John, dinner was actually enjoyable. Ellen had prepared roast chicken with all the side dishes a person could dream of, it was probably way too much food but Dean would never be the one to complain. For the first time in weeks, Dean felt able to relax, putting aside his worries for at least a little bit. He laughed when Jo tried to comb through Sam’s hair with her fork, in her defense his brother could do with a haircut.
“Sadie,” She extended her hand, in a greeting. Dean took her hand and kissed the back of it, eyes never leaving hers. She was rather striking, he thought, her hair was dark and framed her face, falling into her clavicles. Her eyes blue and with dark eyeshadow, contrasting against her pale white skin.
, Dean thought, he tried hard to think of something else to say. “Why didn’t you?” his own voice wasn’t much steadier, it was strange to be this close together without him being completely drunk off his ass, but still, the same feelings stirred in his stomach, as they did that night.
“Yes, that’s most likely what was in the boxes we saw. This drives me to a very unsettling conclusion, that-”
“We just executed the spell and it worked like a charm. The archangel didn’t know what hit him.” Commander Barnes barked out, followed by laughter which was joined in by the others.
Dean stared at him like Castiel had punched him in the stomach. And it sent all sorts of shivers and slithers up and down his spine.
“Thank you,” John Winchester’s voice echoed. “We’ll be in touch.” Dean had rarely heard his dad sound so formal, so uptight. Who on earth could he be talking to? He looked at Cas who was also eyeing the three men attentively, and Dean studied the angel’s expression closely, it was clear that he recognized one of them, and Dean had a gut feeling that it wasn’t one of the hunters he recognized, he wondered if he wanted to know what this meant.
After a quick breakfast and a short text to Sam, explaining why he wasn’t at training today (he was running a car parts errand for Bobby) Dean made his way to the edge of Welldale.
The words fell flat. Metatron wasn’t even looking at him anymore, instead, he’d focused on the silver blade that rested in Michael’s secretary.
The sky darkened with heavy clouds and the shadows disappeared, one by one until they stood facing each other in the cover of complete darkness. Across from the still unmoving group, one man stood tall. He was making an effort to look as steady as the ones in front of him, but the rising and falling of his chest gave his nerves away. Still, he didn’t move any more than they did.
“Jeez Cas, you could at least buy me dinner first,” Dean laughed nervously. What the fuck was up with the nickname?
Thank you for sticking with me for another chapter! As per usual, I hope you enjoyed this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. I would love to know what your favorite chapter is so far, so please let me know with a comment or message on Tumblr!
“You’re awake,” the fingers stopped moving, and Dean didn’t know if it was a question or a statement.
Dean thought he was a weird, funny-looking dude, but he was grateful that for once someone had answered at least some of his questions. All the other older hunters usually just told him to 'stick it where the sun don’t shine’ - clearly coaxed by John to keep him out of the loop. But he wasn’t a kid anymore, and he was glad someone could see him like a man, a real hunter, old enough to deal with the important stuff.
Dean made his way over to the couch where Cas sat on. A quick glance at the book and he realized Cas was reading his (very worn out) copy of Cat’s Cradle, by Vonnegut. He felt his cheeks pink up and couldn’t help but smile a little.
The biggest thank you to my lovely beta, Fred, my funniest friend and an amazing writer who never fails to help me out with these chapters. Go show her some love on
Cas obliged, even if stubbornly. He let himself gently fall down on the couch next to Dean, and even though it was a small couch there was still some distance between them, which Dean didn’t like, but still, he resisted the urge to skid closer.
“I know.” Cas’s compliance felt like a battle won too easily. “I’ll be here when you come back from Robert’s house.” Cas pushed himself off the car, and took some steps in a circle. Dean had never seen him display any signs of nervousness, maybe this was it. “I’ll ward this cabin. It’ll leave me weaker while inside, but I don’t want to risk any angels finding out where we are. This morning was too close to call.”
By the time Dean got to parking the impala next to the cabin, he could already see a light on the inside. A sudden fear clouded his brain, that someone else was in there. He ran up the steps, purposefully leaving the duffel and the weapons in the trunk, and carefully peeked into the window, his fist loosely around the knife in his jeans. His wariness quickly took different turns, though, when he spotted Castiel.
“I could have healed your wound easily that day,” Castiel’s words were barely a whisper, “without leaving a scar I mean.” Dean could feel the words against his skin, and his mind went completely blank, he’d heard Cas, but it was proving difficult to focus on anything but trying not to focus on Cas being so close, and definitely trying to look anywhere but Cas's lips.
As Dean ran out of the building all he could feel was anger, anger towards his father, for basically selling him out to the enemy, angry at himself for almost giving in to Michael’s words, and mostly, angry at Castiel. His stomach twisted and turned at the idea that the angel had wanted this all along, that this was his end-game.
Every day it was getting harder to separate things. To think about angels as their enemy and to think about Castiel, as possibly a friend. Would he even consider Castiel a friend? He’d like to think so, but then, what are social norms between different species? How was he to figure out how he felt about these celestial beings, if he was possibly being influenced by his feelings toward simply one of them. Feelings that he was having a hard time describing even to himself, feelings that kept him wide awake at night and had never been clear to begin with.
The room was immersed in deep silence, only disrupted by their breathing. The hours had passed, one after the other, and Dean was still counting. When he got to high hundreds, he gave up. It was dark, and he was tired, but somehow sleep didn’t come to him. He looked at the ceiling and tried to find the weight of Cas pulling him towards him, but his body had gotten used to it by now.
“Are you on your way to the meeting?” He heard a voice from behind him while a hand grasped hold of his arm.
“Yeah, fine,” Dean whispered and once again his breath caressed the back of his neck, Castiel suppressed a groan of frustration. “Turn on one, two, th-”
kind of movie. And for all the times Dean had thought an apocalypse could be kind of cool, he was wanting to go back in time and kick himself in the nards for it.
was different alright. Dean had never felt more grateful for the fact that his dad couldn’t hear his heartbeat.
or if he was just hanging around because he thought Dean would crumble into a puddle on the ground if left alone. The last three times he had been alone, he had, in fact, been a very crumble-y, puddle-y mess of a man, so he didn’t blame him, and even though he was pretty sure he was fine and didn’t
“Certainly makes my top ten.” Cas huffed out a laugh. The sound echoed into Dean with such ease that he felt a little overwhelmed, he couldn’t help smiling at the sound. Maybe it was the tiredness, pricking away at him, maybe it was the darkness that surrounded them, lit only by the stars, maybe it was the fact that Cas knew how he felt, and was yet to walk away. Or maybe, it was just the nagging thought in the back of his mind, that they wouldn’t make it another twenty-four hours. Whatever it was, Dean was too tired to fight it, to change the subject, to keep his face in check. If his days were counted, what was the point in pretending he wasn’t completely head over heels about Cas?
“Your ankle is hurt,” It was more of a statement than it should be a question, it was evident that it hurt.
“I heard that you’re trying to make some sort of deal with the angels, about Michael,” Dean said in a hushed voice, if anyone noticed he was going around and asking these questions they might try to stop Curt from answering.
“- run some errands''. He really needed to start coming up with better excuses. “Anyway, my dad isn’t too big on the whole angel thing, as you might have guessed, and he's getting suspicious because I keep disappearing.” Dean wasn’t sure this was going well. “I mean, I don’t think he knows I’m out, hanging with some angel, that's for sure, but now he thinks there’s some chick involved and I don’t know what else to tell him. Anyhow, I don’t know when I’ll be able to leave his sight for the next few days, just thought I’d let you know” He opened his eyes again, it didn’t make sense but he could almost feel someone watching him “So, this is it. I guess I’m done?” A smile opened up a little, heat rising to his cheeks.
“With our brother, archangel Michael, locked away downstairs, someone will have to step up while the others look for him,” Uriel spoke, encouraging those who were still reflecting on Metatron’s words.
“Well for one, you could have combed your hair this morning,” Dean grinned knowing he had hit a nerve with his younger brother.
“Yeah, you made me watch it when I was five. I had to sleep within a circle of salt while clutching an iron poker for ages.”
on the discovery channel. He nodded towards the armchair where Bobby was enjoying a beer, his eyes were glued to the tv but he lifted the beer in Dean’s general direction.
In reality, Dean could think of a handful of things he should tell Cas, that he wanted to tell Cas, but he just couldn’t. He could hear Sam’s, annoying, voice in the back of his head, calling him
“But angels aren’t exactly monsters though, are they? Or at least, they weren’t supposed to be.” He couldn’t see everything so black and white anymore. Cas, he was pretty sure, was no monster and it made it hard to believe that all other angels were. Maybe they just had a bad reputation. Once again, all those classes made their way back to him -
“Nothing you need to worry about,” Dean knew this was gonna come up sooner later, but he’d rather choose later. “Come on, let’s get you to the car.”
Cas could hardly move his body without pressing back against Dean’s, it was a small, tight, space and as soon as the door had closed behind them Cas had immediately regretted this decision. It was too late now, the voices on the outside warned them it was impossible to leave without being seen.
“Y’all think some strange guy who appeared out of nowhere just happens to have all the right answers to our problems and don’t want nothing in return?” Bobby’s skepticism was met with both protest and agreement from the crowd of hunters.
he wanted to say, but the words stuck to his throat. “Are you worried that you will have trouble sleeping tonight?”
He could just picture him now, sitting on the motel bed, staring at a blank wall, just waiting patiently. Or maybe he wasn’t doing any of this, at all, maybe Castiel hadn’t even thought about Dean since he’d left. Maybe he went on about his angel business and could care less about this one human. That thought stung him more than he cared to admit. It wasn’t like the angel had a phone, anyway, not like Dean could just text him. Unless...
When Cas didn’t answer, he instinctively opened the door. Nothing could’ve prepared him for what he saw.
“I’ll go first” Cas offered, and Dean was fine with that. He’d been down enough creepy holes in the ground for a lifetime, and he knew being the first one down wasn’t really pleasant. Plus, from up where they were standing, Dean could cover for Cas.
Dean could feel the angel’s eyes on him. He looked up to see Castiel’s face doing that thing again where he slightly squinted his eyes as if it would help him think. And Dean realized he couldn’t do it, he wasn’t strong enough to hold a grudge against his enemy, and he hated himself for it.
A sudden noise startled them both, and Dean drew his focus away from Cas and onto the window. It was pouring rain, and the sound they’d heard had to have been thunder if the lightning outside was anything to go by. He approached the windowsill and stared up at the sky, beholding the looming storm.
As if reading his thoughts Cas stepped back towards the living room, Dean was half relieved but half displeased by the thought of having the angel out of his sight. But Cas didn’t disappear from the bathroom, instead, he sat down in the door opening, his shoulder leaning against the doorframe and his back turned to the shower.
Reluctantly he turned the water off, stepping out of the shower, and grabbing a towel. Cas still sat, his back leaning on the door frame, and Dean took a look at his watch -
“Alright. So we stay put.” Sam clapped, once. “You find the grace, as fast as you possibly can, and we’ll hold down the fort here.” He gestured at Dean and then at the three of them. They looked like a poor rendition of the power rangers.
“What? I didn’t fall from Heaven, Dean,” Castiel looked about as done as could be expected. “That was my brother Lucifer.”
They pulled up onto the dirt road in front of their cabin. Dean could feel Bobby’s eyes watching him as if he could burst out into flames any minute. It made him nervous but he kept his mouth shut as they walked up to the front door.
After a short interrogation, and 50 bucks from Dean’s wallet, they were on their way to one of the private rooms downstairs. Castiel had described his leader to the bartender who, after the money, seemed to know who he was talking about “Oh, short guy, in need of a shave, who is a terrible tipper?”  so he directed them to room 11.
Even with his eyes closed, he could still notice that there was a bright light in front of them. Actually, it was heading towards them... Dean had to press his arm over his closed eyes because even like this, it was extremely painful.
He wasn't sure how he’d been so open with Dean, answering his questions, specifically the one that might just have given him away. In the fleeting daylight it was easy enough to think back and determine he should have lied, but in the moment, being dishonest never even crossed his mind -
“Yeah Dean, once again she’s not a kid anymore. Plus she’s good, which you would know if you’d ever let her come with us on hunts.”
He slid the wicket to the side, revealing the box -  no windows, no beds or toilets, no metal bars, and only one way in. It was completely surrounded by hand-painted sigils and heavy iron chains. There was one piece of furniture in the middle of the room, a simple iron chair, where a dark, slumped-down figure sat, feet shackled, and dirty clothes, stained with blood.
Cas was making a face at him, clearly hearing both sides of the conversation, mouthing at Dean, asking what they were talking about. Dean raised his palm, telling him to wait.
“We should meet again soon Cassie, somewhere far away. You should choose, too, I feel I am a little predictable and many of our brothers and sisters would be able to find us.”
Sam was quiet for a second, probably processing the information Dean had just blatantly told him without meaning to, he realized that Sam was still under the impression that there was actually some girl outside of the city he’d been pining over.
“It’s easy, if you know where to find them,” Cas smiled. “Here, you can see the Ursa Major- it’s Latin for what you may find referred to as the greater bear, ” he pointed to a group of stars above them.
Dean fell to his knees, next to Cas. He was half sitting, half laying down on the floor, his shirt completely torn off, revealing deep cuts and gashes. Blood was dripping down his side from a major flesh wound that spread from his bottom left rib up to his clavicle.
Cas reached out and lay his palm over Dean’s heart, causing it to flutter a little at the touch “This” He pressed against the fabric of the cotton shirt beneath his fingers, signaling to the beating inside his chest “Is what it means to be human, Dean. This courage to try and fail - that is why we need to do this, this is what makes humanity worth saving, and I needed you to figure this out by yourself, that’s why I sent you there. There was no masterplan, there’s no ploy - you needed to see we’re on the same side.”
He only moved again once he heard the door close, looking at the spot where Castiel had stood a second ago. He just needed this day to be over - stumbling his way to the bed, he let himself drop down, face-first into the pillow - he just needed to sleep it off, all of it.
The next few seconds felt like a blur, Dean’s entire ability to be rational and think things through went right out the window. His dad really knew what buttons to push, and in just a few words sent him spiraling down - he didn’t think that what his dad was saying was true, and yet, guttural guilt settled in his stomach, like a wet blanket over him, suffocating him, and he let his anger flow through his body, in spurs of rage and adrenaline.
“Yeah, I bet.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, and let his dirty fingers press into his eyes for a moment.
“It wouldn’t be the first time, and it probably won’t be the last time either. Unfortunately, this is what Heaven has come to over the past decades, brothers and sisters turning against each other and murdering for their own benefit.”
The room was silent, some angels nodded in agreement while others seemed displeased with this new idea.
Dean took a deep breath, moved a little, making sure nothing was broken, just badly bruised, and when he figured he was fine, he ran over to Castiel.
“Just let me talk,” Dean interrupted the angel, if he was gonna say anything he’d have to say it fast. “I was pissed, and clearly piss-faced drunk and I’m sorry” He took his eyes from the road to try and get a read of Cas's face. “I didn’t mean to, you know, I shouldn’t have done that,  so let’s just forget about it.” It was a longshot, he knew if Castiel had been too bothered by it, this wouldn’t work.
“Why?” Castiel found himself saying. Apparently, Gabriel had more thoughts than he’d shared with him before.
“Mind your tone, son! You know that love only makes you sloppy, and you know what we can’t afford right now?” The rhetorical question hovered over them, for some time, Dean actually thought maybe he was supposed to answer, but soon enough the other shoe dropped “Sloppiness! Goddamn Dean, you´re walking around all caught up in your feelings while angels are trying to kill us every chance they get!”
“Yeah, I guess,” his voice was still somewhat unsteady. The truth was that he could use a nice hot shower, to wash away the nightmare and soothe his aching muscles, but that also meant leaving Cas out of his sight, and he didn’t know if he could do that at the moment.
were hardly seconds compared to the weeks he had spent with him. Time had never held much meaning to him, but now, he finally understood why humans referred to time as the most precious thing in the world, it now held much more meaning, so much more value ever since he was able to feel human-like emotions, and sometimes it was completely overwhelming to him.
“Yeah,” Bobby looked pleased about the change of subject. “I heard something about an abandoned office building in Colorado being infested with demons.”
He could feel his brother's eyes on him, but what could he say? There was no way Dean could explain the way they both got healed without involving the supernatural. And Sam had never bought Dean’s explanation of ‘being there just in time’ in the first place. The worst part of it all was that he didn’t know who he was protecting by keeping the truth to himself, if he was protecting Sam or Castiel.
Castiel tried to appear impressed at Metatron’s little display of power, just as a thought crossed his mind. The last known person to be called to this office was Joshua, and he hadn’t seen him at the meeting today, in fact, he hadn’t seen Joshua in quite a while. Which was an awful coincidence, seeing as he knew Joshua was one of the remaining angels on the fence about Metatron. It was weird enough for an angel to vanish like this, especially when considering the fact that the last time he was seen was on his way to discuss matters with Metatron… But Metatron wouldn’t be the one to dispose of questioning angels like this, would he? His interests were clearly troubled, but would he be capable of things this morally wrong?
“Like a spare battery,” a smile spread across the hunter’s face and Castiel couldn’t help but relish in the warm feeling that spread through his chest at the sight of it.
“Or not,” the figure said. He still hadn’t moved a muscle, though his voice carried the smallest hint of doubt, unlike before.
The first encounter between hunters and angels went by quite amicably, if you will. They discovered common ground in their shared enemies and were able to strike a deal to tolerate each other's existences. It wasn't until years later that the hunters learned of the angel's plans to attack the city and burn it to the ground. Though it was supposedly only a part of the angels that felt this way, it left the hunters with an unnerving need for more precautions and safety.
“Anyway, he’s also the kindest person I know, he cares about the entire world as if he’s the one that created it. He makes you look at the little things differently, you know? It’s like he can appreciate even the ugliest thing, and make it seem like the most extraordinary thing in the world. Just being around him makes you feel confident, like he looks at you like you’re this amazing part of the world, like you’re an expensive painting that he’s admiring or something.” Dean couldn’t help but blush at his own words, feeling ridiculous for saying them aloud, talking about Cas like he put the stars in the sky. (Dean still wasn’t entirely sure he
The thought of the weapons sent another surge of panic through his body, palpable to his toes. He didn’t let the thoughts unfold though, he couldn’t let himself fall back into that whole slippery slope of useless anxiety. Instead, he spent time trying to clean up the ever-growing pile of used plates and trash he had been accumulating during the days he stayed there with Cas. He didn’t let the empty packet of noodles distract his mind, he ignored the napkins from the burger place as he stuffed them into the trash can, and he definitely didn’t pay any attention to the unmade bed and crumpled sheets. After two hours of thoroughly cleaning the cabin, it looked cleaner than it probably had in years, there was no evidence that anyone had spent much time here.
When Dean felt sure his knees wouldn’t give way beneath him, he pulled away just enough to look at Cas. He felt lightheaded and with an immense sense of ignorant glee. He carefully peeked through his eyelids, and theatrically looked around.
“You totally cuddled,” he said with the most annoying smug smile plastered on his face, it took all Dean had not to swat at it. Sam knew he would be grossed out by the accusation, but that only seemed to make his enjoyment grow bigger.
“Yes, I have another thing I would like you to take care of for me.” Metatron’s tone held nearly any signs of interest. He wasn’t even looking in Uriel’s direction, instead, he seemed to be deeply fascinated by a branch of cherry blossom that curled around one of the gazebo’s arches.
He was significantly tired, and mostly out of it, watching a rerun of some shitty cartoon while dozing off. That was probably why he didn’t notice the door opening.
“For argument’s sake, let’s say I believe you.” Dean really needed him to keep talking. “Why on earth, would my father tell you fucking anything?”
“It would happen right now, if we knew where his grace was.” Dean slapped the side of his thigh, annoyed. “I’m going to Bobby’s, I’m sure he can help with that.” He sensed the shift in the atmosphere and realized Cas was about to leave. Quickly, he added “how did it go with Gabriel’s army?”
Dean took the early bus to the command center to follow his daily training. He was also hoping to talk to his dad about his position as a hunter. He had always been interested in joining the inner circle of hunters. They were the ones responsible for taking care of the city, making sure that everyone within its walls was safe. When the hunters had their first big showdown with the angels nearly over thirty years ago, a lot of lives were lost. The attacks became more frequent and the inner circle was the first to start building the walls of the city. When Dean’s mother was killed by demons, John made it his mission to hunt down every single demon he came across. This meant that he had to make sure Sam and Dean were safe while he was out hunting. That was when they had moved into the city, where they lived with Bobby for most of their childhood. Dean despised demons, but at least their motives were clear. They were evil and all they did was evil shit, this much made sense. But why angels would attack innocent human beings, Dean would never understand. This was why he had made it his mission to hunt the bastards down and show them that hunters are not to be messed with. The unfortunate thing about this was that there wasn’t much lore on angels. Sure, there was your standard bible bullshit and a few books that went into a bit more depth about the celestials, but those books were strictly forbidden to read by anyone other than the inner circle. Dean never understood why, wouldn’t it make sense if every hunter in the city was prepared to face their most dangerous opponent?
. The memory of the morning’s events made him even more flustered. He tried to shake it off. “He’s not my-” but they were gone, and Dean was left standing there, feeling like an idiot, with a sharp and annoying pang behind his ribs, somewhere between hunger and an empty feeling he couldn’t name.
“I have to say I still don’t know what happened,” Uriel looked puzzled. “However, I do come bearing good news.”
“Thanks for saving my ass back there, you didn’t have to do that, but hell, I’m really glad you did.”
He asked Cas to pass him his tools, and the lock gave away easily enough. Cas pulled the latch door open, revealing a steep ladder down into the dark.
“Where are we going?” Dean finally asked, when he thought his knees were about to give out. They slowed a little.
“Yeah, that is- if you don’t mind.” He didn’t know how much it would actually help him sleep, but knowing that if he woke up in a complete state of panic, and he could see that the angel was okay, was the best shot he was gonna get at some rest.
After he’d spend hours fighting off heavy eyelids and crashing waves of sleep, only then, would he let himself give in to sleep. The problem was, however, that these thoughts, these intrusive waves of feelings he couldn’t have, carried into his dreams as if they didn’t deserve to be stored away. The dreams taunted him with a reality that could never be his, they seemed so impossible, but at the same time, almost palpable, like it was already happening in an alternate reality, worlds away, but just a thin enough barrier to breakthrough. And in that space between sleep and consciousness, was Cas.
“Well, it sure as hell fits the description of our little Wolfman and co,” Dean said while reaching for his car keys in his pocket.
“It’s Sam, he’s hurt.” Dean pulled his brother closer. Sam’s shirt was almost entirely covered in blood by now. “I didn’t know what to do, and I think you healed me back at the cabin, so I figured...” he didn’t have the strength to hide the panic in his voice.
He impatiently drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, normally he enjoyed driving and it was able to relax him like nothing else. But lately, he felt restless, the (pretty one-sided) conversation with his dad was heavy on his stomach, and he hadn’t actually heard from Cas in a few days. And they hadn’t even seen each other in two weeks, not after that awkward goodbye, the closure of spending those days together.
His heartbeat fastened, and he could feel it on his fingertips, he was almost worried it would cause them to reach out of their own accord.
He swallowed a bitter taste down, at the idea that this could be it, that one or both of them might not make it. That they had been so caught up in frugal matters, that Cas could die without knowing how he felt. That seemed like a fate worse than death itself.
“Son, I’m-” It was barely there. But Dean heard it. “-I just, I want you to know that I’m doing the best I can here.”
These thoughts floated around in Dean’s brain, making it so that his cheeks were reddening, leaving him feeling flustered and warm. Cas had, seemingly,  taken notice of it. He stared at Dean, in silence, eyes squinting a little, as if he was trying to figure something out. Dean watched him as he opened his mouth to speak, but closed it immediately, probably regretting what he was about to say.
. Dean had been completely and utterly intoxicated, in no control of himself and Castiel knew he would never have done
“That would be because of your feud with angels. You never want to accept whatever diverges from your beliefs. I, on the other hand, am above such internal conflicts, so I have no reason to lie to you, Dean. What could I, possibly, have to gain from it?” A small pause allowed Dean to tilt his head, getting a better look at Michael, through the shadows. “My hands are already tied.”
“You heard me. You walk around with this big shot attitude, pretend like you’re some fucking saint, like we are lucky to have a dad like you. Well, guess what? I don’t think you would even qualify for a participation trophy, I basically had to raise Sammy on my own.” Dean could tell his dad was taken by surprise, he’d never had either of his sons talk back to him like this. “And all because, what? You’re trying to get
Castiel offered to sit on the floor while he slept, obviously wanting to keep some space between them. And for a second Dean wondered if Cas was afraid he would try to kiss him again, but he wasn’t drunk this time, and the distance between them had become considerably less over the past two days. But he decided it was ridiculous to ask the angel to sit on the floor for at least six hours when there was a perfectly fine double bed next to them.
“I thought you were-” His voice cracked and he tried to steady himself before rephrasing. “I didn’t know if you were
Bobby had always been like a second father to Dean, just a lot nicer and more understanding version than John Winchester. Maybe Dean would have more luck getting some information out of Bobby. He was a higher rank hunter after all, even though he didn’t attend the meetings anymore. Dean knocked at Bobby’s door and heard the familiar ‘Come in’. Bobby was sitting at the kitchen table, a microwave dinner, and a beer in front of him. He seemed to be in a good mood, so what better time was there for Dean to try and find out more information. Dean pushed one of the chairs back and joined Bobby at the table.
“That’s what happens when you spend time on research instead of wasting time playing ghostbusters,” Curt said with a composed look.
And unlike what the name of the street indicated, it wasn’t a family-friendly neighborhood or even a chapel to match the name for that matter. Ironically enough, the street functioned as the center of nightlife. Bars and clubs surrounded what could better be called a town square. Dean’s eyes immediately recognized the purple-lit building on the far right end of the street, it was a sight he was no stranger to.
“Thank you, I don’t think I’ve consumed alcohol in a long time.” Cas gave him a wide smile, as he looked around for a place to sit. Dean gestured toward the log and the both of them sat down. Castiel watched as Dean flipped the cap off, copying his move, and when Dean took a big gulp, he followed.
sex scene. He cleared his throat, shifting on the couch. His feet were propped over Cas’s lap, and he was, apparently, mesmerized by the whole thing. While a normal person who catches an uncomfortable sex scene averts their eyes, tried their best to appear unfazed, Cas was glued to the screen, head tilt and all. Dean did his best to do the same as if it didn't make him so
Dean’s shirt quickly became soaked in blood, and Dean just kept pressing. His other hand rose to Cas’s jaw, his thumb stroking his cheekbone. His eyes trying to catch Cas’s. “Hey, hey, you gotta stay awake man.” Dean’s heart thudded inside his chest. He’d been in this position before, with his dad, with Sam, on hunts gone south, but when that happens there’s always the chance of taking them to the hospital, which is a no-go with Cas. There was no way he could drag a bleeding angel into the hospital, he wasn’t even sure he bled the same as humans. Although looking at the glistening red on his hands, he couldn’t tell the difference.
He looked down as the water trickled down his body, it wasn’t going down, at all. If anything, Dean was sure it was
“Fuck, Cas, it’s about you not dying on me, okay?” Dean’s frustration rippled through his body, making him reach his hand out and not-so-gently shove Cas’s chest.
to make it go away. Cas was everywhere, and every time he touched Dean, even in the most innocent of ways, his whole body would try to do
“Okay, they’re gone. I believe we should move now,” Castiel said and Dean had never been happier to just go put himself in harm’s way.
“Dean, I know,” Castiel said slowly, marking his words. It took him a second to understand what the angel was saying, did he believe that Dean didn’t know this would happen? He must have looked as lost as he felt because Cas continued. “I’m aware of what happened last night. It’s been hours, all of Heaven has been informed.”
After a quick freshen up, Dean made pasta and Sam lectured him on healthy eating but ate two plates nonetheless.
The streets seemed emptier than usual, there were almost no other hunters passing them, no teens on a break from training hanging in flocks outside stores. He did, however, notice an unusual amount of trucks passing through, there was quite a lot of them and they were coming in and out, repeatedly - Dean was sure the same truck had passed him by at least twice in the last few minutes.
Dean had to do everything in his power to stop himself from punching the angel in the face right then and there.
He was more careful with the front door to his house, as to not wake up a would-be very annoyed John. He just had to get in and out without anyone noticing, and then he would make his way to the weaponry. Easier said than done, though.
“Hunters spotted an angel near lake Lacua two days ago,” Dean decided what the hell, what did he have to lose. “Was that you?”
“Let us not worry with the reasoning of these mud-monkeys, brother.” The angel who’d spoken first did so once again. He was tall and wide, and even though it was obvious any of them could kill them with a snap of their fingers, this one was more threatening than the others. “Here is our
Dean pulled the trigger, and the body in front of him slumped down before it could get back up. The shocked look was etched into his expression, and it would stay like that as the light burst out from every hole, until it dimmed and the angel fell flat against the earth.
“Alright, you will tell me exactly what I want to know and in exchange, I will tell you about Dean,” John said.
“Not exactly,” Castiel seemed to mirror someone in the booth next to them by wiping the corners of his mouth with a paper napkin, which Dean appreciated.  “Heaven is designed to reflect all of the same personal wants and needs you had in life.”
Upon entering Welldale, Dean started navigating his way through the familiar streets. The main road of the town was nothing special, or least of all suspicious, it had the typical all-American look about it.
The angel let out a small “oh,” and his demeanor changed back to his usual self again. “I didn’t save you so that you would have to save me in return.”
Dean just stared at him, mouth agape, wide-eyed and silent. Castiel couldn’t read him. There was no guessing what Dean could’ve been thinking, and the room fell quiet.
Dean let out a humorless laugh, “Yeah I’m pretty sure he wasn’t all that into it, seeing as he told me that it wasn’t right and that we should stop.” He tried to replicate what Cas had said in a straight face, but he was sure he hadn’t been able to disguise how it really made him feel. It felt weird to discuss this part of his life with Sam, partly because Dean had been keeping it a secret for so long, and partly because they were talking about Cas, and usually, when Dean told Sam anything it was usually a done deal, or he was just bragging - and this was none of the above, in fact, he wasn’t used to being rejected
Cas just looked at him, brow furrowed, eyes squinting more than Dean had ever seen it on him, his hand so tight around Dean’s arm it would leave a bruise. In the few fractions of a second they had before Dean felt himself get yanked backward, he saw Cas’s lips purse, and then open as if he was going to say something, then a flash of something shining in his eyes, and as fast as Dean noticed, it was gone again, focusing on something behind Dean, and it was probably nothing, but it felt like the entire fucking world, in that one, fleeting, almost-esque look.
As luck would have it, sitting on the couch, immersed in his cross-words puzzle, there was only Sam.
From a distance, he could see Dean leaning against his car, exactly where they were supposed to meet. Castiel couldn’t deny the unnerving feeling that sat low in his stomach, their last meeting was spent mostly by fighting, and while that was nearly a week ago, he didn’t know if Dean was still angry.
human. Dean was clever and cunning, there was no denying it, but he was also smart. Gabriel seemed to share the same train of thought, as he looked at Castiel. “Then, who is the righteous man?”
“Don’t stop on my account,” he gave Cas a little smirk, still hoping he would keep doing the thing with his fingers. Unfortunately for Dean, instead, he pushed his legs aside and got up in a haste.
not even catching the hypocrisy that was spewing out of his mouth. “But then again,  I guess  I hurt you more times than anyone else ever did, in the process.”
“I didn’t spend all this time healing you, just so I could take you apart.” Of course, he wouldn’t admit that he actually wouldn't mind, to take Dean apart, figure out what made him tick, just to put him back together again, leaving out all the hurt and all the pain. Castiel would love nothing more than to sew him together at the seams, unbreak the broken, and to leave his own mark, his signature just etched beneath the surface.
“Indeed, that leads us to the next dilemma.” Once more, Metatron paused, this time, making his way around the table, his hand hovering over the backs of the angels, fingers grazing one or two as he made his way around. The angels nervously fidgeted, eyes on each other, as if the traitor would burn at the touch. “Who is the traitor in our midst?
“Dean,” Sam’s grin greeted him when he walked through the front door. A quick glance around told him it was unlikely he’d get any shut-eye soon, Sam held a bucket of popcorn and told him that it was
“Which is why we are sending six of our own to go down to negotiate with the hunters. We have already arranged the meeting.” Uriel said, genuinely fed up with Josua’s insistence.
“Look for what?” Dean’s eyebrows rose, what could they possibly be looking for? And how would an angel be able to walk into Welldale anyway?
“We should go in, it would be rude to be late to our leader’s gathering.” Castiel opened the doors with haste, bright light flooding them for a moment, and then revealed the marble tabletop where many familiar faces sat around. They semi-bowed their heads in a greeting manner towards the lot of angels already sitting there, and made their way to their usual chairs.
, and he didn’t feel like arguing with logic, so he didn’t. Cas didn’t refuse when Dean offered him to share the bed,
The thought grew in him, until it became more of an impulse, gnawing away at him until he stopped fighting it. In the darkness, he felt brave enough to do it, or at least, stupid enough. It was just a flick of his wrist, the smallest movement in the world, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, but it was enough. He brushed over the back of Cas’s hand, gingerly tracing it with his index finger until he placed his entire hand on top of the angel’s. His hand lingered for a few seconds and time appeared to stand still, he was sure his heart skipped a damn beat, he waited for Cas to wake up, possibly pull away from his hand. But he didn’t, instead, the angel’s eyes fluttered open and his fingers wrapped around around Dean’s, their fingers intertwining. Dean could feel him squeeze his hand, and the wave of heat that spread up his arm, and through his whole being was inebriating. Dean wasn’t sure what made him feel this way, with the most innocent touch he’d received. Whatever it was, he squeezed back and decided he would hold on for as long as he was allowed.
His eyes never left Dean, didn’t bother blinking, afraid the seconds would tick by, faster and faster, until this was but a distant memory. Even if he knew what to say,
, Castiel thought as he promptly abided, pulling up a chair. “Tell me, Castiel, you remember your orders, do you not?”
“One more word out of you and you’re suspended from these meetings!” Barnes yelled, a vein on his forehead nearly burst out of anger.
“That’s very funny coming from someone who looks like they just walked out of a lumberjack’s weekly magazine.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean took another sip of his beer. “Can I at least buy you a beer?” He did the math in his head, and he was sure he could spare a few bucks to thank the man. Had it not been for him, he’d be in real hot water right now. “It’s the least I can do”
Somehow the dark was a way for them to talk more freely, to share their thoughts out loud without hesitation. When Dean had rolled over to his side to face him, Castiel could have sworn his grace left his body for a second. The moonlight drifted in through the window, casting faint beams over their bodies. He was able to make out the features of Dean’s face, his jaw, his cheekbones, and even down to some of the freckles that covered his face. It was a good thing that breathing wasn’t as important to angels as to humans because he was pretty sure he stopped doing that a few minutes ago.
When he looked back at Dean he noticed a pleased smile on his lips, and Castiel couldn’t help but reciprocate it, he smiled until it hurt the muscles in his cheeks. He was no longer afraid to look at the beautiful man in front of him, no longer wary to find hatred in his eyes and he wondered how he had ever imagined to find it there. Because when their eyes met Castiel couldn’t find anything in them but kindness, and as the light of his grace dimmed, leaving both of them back into the dark, he knew he would never feel anything as deeply as the way he felt towards Dean Winchester.
