“No contract. Verbal agreement.”
“I-” Cas swallows. “Fine. I’m fine.” A familiar expression rolls across Dean’s face. The one that says
I'm easing back into this fic, so this is a MINI CHAPTER with NO SMUT. Just be aware :^)
“Mmm, open up, angel.” Dean murmurs against his lips. It makes Cas shudder, but he stubbornly shakes his head, despite how it painfully pulls his hair. Dean’s eyes narrow. “I said,” His free hand slides down the font of Cas’ body. It settles on his groin and squeezes painfully. “
, dark and wanting and focused on his wet eyes. Cas wants to pull away from the overwhelming attention, to close his eyes and pretend Dean isn’t staring down at him, but he can’t. He’s never been able to pull his attention away from Dean.
Dean shoves in hard and holds himself there. He grunts against Cas’ neck, his body tense. He grinds his hips against Cas’ ass and goes limp. Cas reaches up to stroke his hair, his fingers combing through it.
, has his whole body throbbing with a low pleasure. He can hear his heartbeat in his ears, feel it in his dick, he idly wonders if
“Relax now.” That’s all the warning Cas gets from Crowley before his hand’s slowly slipping out of him. Cas sucks in a pained breath. Despite how loose he is, the friction against his sore insides has him gripping the sheets. Dean’s clean hand gently stoking his hair helps him relax enough for Crowley’s hand to slip out with a wet sound.
“Dean, I-” He stops dead in his tracks. The man in the doorway looks him up and down, leering at him.
Dean shrugs. “I like to mark my territory.”
Cas blinks at the light as the blindfold is pulled from his eyes. He watches Dean pop his blood covered finger in his mouth. Dean makes a pleased sound as he savors it. It makes Cas’ stomach turn.
“Hard, huh? I could see that shit even before the pants came off, damn you’re a pervert.” He leans forward until his face is just inches away from Cas’, his hand keeps it’s slow, even pace. “Can’t believe you’re getting off on this. Guess it makes sense though, considering how much you’ve let everyone step all over you.” It stings, but he’s in no place to argue.
“Deal or no deal? This’s a one time offer.”
“Dean...” He feels both the urge to bolt from the car and try to lose Dean in the forest, as well as to turn his head and kiss him for as long as he’s allowed. The options run circles in his head, he doesn’t know what to do.
“You’re too weak to resist me,
“Of course I do! That doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy the company of you and-”
Cas has done this for him before when he’d been too tired after jobs, but he’d never made it an
“Keep your nose in your own business, or else I might decide to cancel my offer.” Dean’s voice is low, serious. Crowley holds his hands up in surrender.
, but Dean shuts him down with a reminder that
“Please, Dean. I want to make you feel good. Want you to cum in me.
“Nope.” Dean ruts against him with a soft moan. Cas isn’t even fighting it anymore. Can’t bring himself to. It just feels
Every ounce of Cas’ blood runs cold as he registers the sound of a pocket knife flicking open. He’s instantly struggling against Dean’s grip on him, but his current form has no chance against a brawny hunter. Dean’s arm locks down over his own, keeping them pinned to his sides.
, angel. That’s so fucking hot.” Dean rubs a fingertip around Cas’ stretched rim. “I’ve been wanting to fill you up
“Mmm, do that part nice and slow.” Dean’s voice is pitched low.
. He shoves his thumb in.
“Gonna cum for me?” Dean’s hand tightens almost painfully.
I took a (several month long) break from this fic due to both a personal situation and being burnt out on spn, but we're officially back in business!
“You can have the bed for tonight. I’ll take the couch.” Cas starts to protest, but Dean shushes him. “Don’t worry. We’ll be sharing it for the next seven nights...that is, if you can handle them.” His voice is low as he guides Cas to the bedroom. Once they’re in the room, Dean plants a short kiss on his lips and tells him to get some sleep.
, you’re pathetic like this.”
“Continue.”
As the hour grows late, his eyelids droop. Eventually he gives in and crawls into bed. He falls into another restless sleep and dreams of Dean tying him up with endless amounts of knots. He doesn’t wake when Dean slips into bed with him and pulls him close.
.” He leaves the room for a few nerve-wracking moments, Cas listens carefully for his return, but is confused by the soft sound of wheels rolling on the wood floor. Dean reenters the bedroom, preceded by a small rolling table. Cas struggles to keep his head held high enough to keep his eyes on the strange machine atop the table as Dean wheels it to the end of the bed.
, if it means getting Dean back. He starts the shower and steps in. It’s clean and stocked with the basics. He scrubs himself down and makes sure that everywhere is as clean as it can be. Once he’s out and dried off, he starts dressing in the familiar clothes. He idly wonders why Dean didn’t include one of his signature flannels with the outfit.
“What?”
that Dean does to him. The ruthless thrusts makes his insides ache, but he’ll savor that ache afterwards. He’ll jerk off to the memory of Dean’s cruelty while the brothers are off hunting.
Cas sucks in a sharp breath before falling over the edge. He cries out, voice uncharacteristically high. The men’s hands on and in him don’t slow, they keep him going until he’s shoving weakly at them, desperate for the overstimulation to stop. Dean releases his spent cock with a smile and nods at Crowley.
Dean leans back. “You like this?” His voice is husky and his hand speeds up. The question swirls through Cas’ mind. He doesn’t know. The slick sounds of Dean’s hand on himself makes his cock ache, but the derision in his voice makes him want to run and hide. “
Cas suddenly realizes that both men are looking down at him expectantly. Crowley’s hand stills and Cas lets out a soft whine before he can think better of it.
“Come on.” Dean mirrors the movement, his hand firm and possessive on Cas’ skin.
“Now look what you’ve done.” Dean calls out from his chair. It gives Cas a spark of hope that Dean might actually defend him, but the sound of a zipper opening dashes it. Crowley rolls his eyes and leans down into Cas’ space. He slowly licks up a tear track on Cas’ cheek. Cas gasps, tries to pull away, but Crowley grips his chin and licks up his other cheek. Cas gapes up at him, his face wet with saliva and red from humiliation. Crowley’s sneer sends a jolts of anger through him, but it tapers off into acceptance as he reminds himself of the deal.
Castiel hums. "I was in a postcard club, too, with members from all over the world. My collection filled two walls of my bedroom. I used to have pen friends. I always loved learning about their culture. I travelled a lot in the past. What I'd give to go to Venice again, or Tokyo. I miss the Scottish Highlands."
Dean frowns at his boyfriend. "For what? I slept seven hours straight. If it weren't too straightforward, I'd ask you to move in with me."
"Marrying your little brother off."
Dean pulls him into a long, languid kiss. "Thanks, man. I needed that."
"Your shift is starting soon," he finally says as if coming to a conclusion.
Castiel gets up from the bed. His hands are trembling when he cups Dean's face again. "Ace?"
there's no reason to fear an earlier dinner. But he set all these eating rules for a reason, and an afternoon picnic with junk food, sweets, and soda breaks every single one of them.
They arrive at their destination shortly after, and Dean turns Castiel in the right direction. "Open your eyes."
"Bees can recognise faces and memorise people. Maybe they'll come back to you, no matter what you're wearing." He lifts his head to take a sip from his lukewarm coke and looks up at the mackerel sky again. Dean turns his head back and closes his eyes.
He pulls back in panic and an apology is already forming on his tongue when Castiel's lips crash onto his. Dean feels the backpack glide on the floor and Castiel's hands fisting his shirt. And then, there is just the two of them and the slide of lips, cautious yet curious tongues, and jittering breaths. Time stops still and moves faster and all that romantic shit that Dean thought he hated. But it's true. He just never had this before.
"Cass, we need to talk," Dean's voice comes from behind, and Castiel nods, back still turned to the other man. They'll have to. But his mouth refuses to form words.
Castiel walks the streets without a destination. He walks his thoughts away until his alarm goes off. He can't believe he missed dinner time. But Dean is out with his new colleagues, and Charlie is at some conference in Illinois. He doesn't feel like company anyway. They would just bug him about the interview, and the more he thinks about it, the more he's convinced that he blew it.
Someone rings the bell,  and Dean is gone, leaving him with a room full of strangers. Castiel is still fidgeting with the top of the sofa's backrest when Dean returns with a couple in tow.
Castiel's lips curl up into a soft smile. "I love you too, Dean. Have for a very long time."
wasn't enough, no matter how hard he tried. Because his dick stayed soft, and arousal was a foreign concept to him. Still is. Always will be, probably.
"I don't either," Castiel whispers.
"This isn't funny, Dean. Rowena said, 'No suits.' And all my smart casual clothes that Hannah sent me are at least a size too small."
"That's lovely, Dean," Hannah says and smiles at him.
Castiel laughs, this time without mirth. "I bring bad luck. It follows me everywhere I go. I haven't had a boyfriend in two years and the longest lasted ten months."
"Cass."
Rowena worries her lip and nods. "So, you fear about him not just fasting, but being anorexic."
Castiel blushes and shakes his head. 'Angel' sounds so nice off Dean's lips, and there is no mistaking that it's an endearment for someone you lo—care deeply about.
He winces. He had sworn himself to never sleep outside again. He blows the bellows to ignite the fire of his newfound pride and asks, "Could I sleep on your couch? I don't have enough money for a hotel room."
They kiss for a while as they usually do when they go to bed, lips and tongues gliding, hands running over skin and fabric. Castiel kisses over the cut of Dean's jaw, nibbles his earlobe, and presses a trail of wet kisses down his neck. Dean hums contentedly, now and then a soft moan falls off his lips.
Castiel frowns. "Why not simply 'Cass'?"
Dean takes Castiel deep into his mouth. God, he loves the sounds his boyfriend makes, the hand in his hair—never guiding, just another point of contact—the way his body strains in an attempt not to fuck his throat sore.
The music coming from the party changes to something slow and Castiel asks, "May I have the next dance?"
"Wow! Congratulations. You made it." Kevin looks down at himself, the pullover he sports not much help against the cold.
The next time he wakes up, there is another dose of painkillers on his nightstand and quiet noises of cluttering tableware coming from the kitchen. Castiel's back.
Dean ducks his head as he realises the slip of his tongue. He's thankful that Castiel doesn't point it out, like he didn't back when his boyfriend moved in and called him just that. Dean clears his throat. "Did you think about reducing to five shifts?"
Dean looks at the little Yoda sitting on the TV bench, replacing the emptiness that used to be there in all its soft-looking glory. "Plushies are for kids and women," he states.
"I was surprised to see your application. Your credentials and references are excellent. Your manager sang your praise. You are made for this job which would likely only be a stepping stone on your corporate ladder."
Castiel nods and smiles before he takes a spoonful of borscht and blows over it, sending red droplets all over the table.
"Did you meet your new partner?" Garth calls over to him.
"I gave him the sandwiches. Jenny has the one from Monday. She put it in her locker but then called in sick."
Castiel chuckles. This is going to be a fun road trip. Just him, and Dean, Baby and the open road. And a pair of cowboy boots that will surely bind this man to him for the rest of their lives.
Castiel freezes underneath him. "Dean?"
Dean's eyes fix on the stripe of bare skin, a perfect hipbone peeking out over the low sitting sweatpants, and the beginnings of a soft pouch. Warmth pools in Dean's stomach. Maybe not the best time for his occasional moment of arousal.
Dean's eyes grow wide, realising that Castiel caught him red-handed.
"Does it matter?" Rowena raises an eyebrow. "About eating," Dean grumbles.
He's not fine. Even after a cool shower, he's sweating and he feels miserable. His mouth would put the Sahara to shame, and no matter how much water he puts into his system, he feels parched. All that the liquid manages is to make him sick and in constant need of using the bathroom. He barely gets sleep in between his trips to the toilet.
"Perfect, love. Kevin agreed to meet Missouri tomorrow." Castiel smiles at him from ear to ear, and for a long moment, Dean returns the smile and pats his back.
"Ten."
Dean grins and wipes the splashes away. "So, this is Russian?" he asks, mouth still full of soup.
But he can't mess this up. His cock won't get between him and the man he's so happy with despite his fuck-ups. Dean could keep this from Castiel until now. For him, he's just as ace as himself.
Another hit lands on Dean's arm. "And I thought I was like a little sister to you."
"Looking good, Mr Supervisor," Dean says, his smirk only slightly teasing. Castiel raises his eyebrow—a sure way to make Dean lick his lips. Castiel grins triumphantly as he succeeds.
"I'm just so happy," she snivels.
Dean can't really argue with that. "I don't know her well enough to judge. I just know that my brother is a different person now."
He still thinks about Castiel when he lies in his queen-sized bed and imagines what it would be like to be with him. To hold hands, to cuddle, to kiss those beautiful lips. To sleep through the day after a night shift spent together and make Castiel laugh for a lifetime.
"Castiel!" she shouts as she's running.
"...someone living on the street, yes. That boy was freezing and hungry. He ran away from his umpteenth foster home, insisting his mother is still alive."
"You did. And it's fine, Cass. I can't promise to say it often, but I promise to show you, okay?"
Dean shrugs his shoulders. "I only want Sammy to be happy."
He runs a hand through his hair. Just two more hours until Castiel is back, and Dean can just imagine what he might think if he sees his plushies spread on the bedroom floor. No, this won't do.
"I know." They share a tiny smile.
Dean chuckles. "Good for her. That scumbag didn't deserve her." He eyes his new colleague as he walks closer and offers his hand. "Name's Dean. And you are?"
"My cousin is British. He loved that band," Castiel explains frowning, and Dean explodes into a full-on belly laugh.
Castiel grins. "I once had beehives."
Still, Dean finds himself on the balcony once again. His thoughts need space to swirl around him. There's a lot to process on this fine day—his brotherly/parent-like love, his own loneliness in a room full of people, the strange stares that Castiel and he have been sharing the whole day…
A knock at his door rips Castiel out of his dreams. He scrambles off the bed, runs a hand through his messy hair, and brushes the sleepy dust out of his eyes. He opens the door and finds Missouri on the other side. Her warm, thoughtful eyes scan him.
"I get what you mean. That's why I never told you I'm gay."
Castiel stifles a laugh. "Do I have to be jealous about all the customers you're calling that, Dean?"
Castiel waits patiently but no less nervous than the man opposite him.
"How'd you sleep?"
Dean cups his face with a tender hand and runs a thumb over his cheekbone. "It's gonna be alright. And if not, we're out of here, enjoying a nice motel. I already checked some out, just in case."
Cas presses a kiss to his hair. "That would make me extremely happy, Dean.”
The channel is paused on a commercial for some kind of vegetable chopping device.
“Oh.” Dean fiddles with the empty shot glass. “That means you won’t have all day tomorrow then.”
“Yes. I won’t be helping with as much of the prep, but I will work the opening shift.” The phone beeps again.
Whistling, Dean casts his line. “So, you wanna tell me how you got out of the Empty?”
Dean thought it was coincidence when Mr. Novak was standing by his assistant’s desk both Monday and Tuesday, but by Wednesday, Dean’s beginning to wonder what’s going on. Does the guy not want him in his office? If so, he should just let Dean hand the mail off to Meg. But no, she looks on with this sly look when Castiel reaches for it, and inevitably Dean zaps the shit out of him, regardless of how he tries to not shuffle his feet on the carpet along the way.
They stand in silence a moment, before Sam says, “Do you remember when you were Emmanuel?”
Clearing his throat, Castiel straightens his spine. "That's inappropriate," he says, before turning to go back into the office, the Anderson files forgotten.
“We’ll need to perform more tests, but he seems to be experiencing full autobiographical and episodic memory loss.”
Remember, in fiction, characters live as long as you have stories to tell for them.
“I was waiting to make sure they were willing before telling you. That was Jesse. Remember him and Cesar? The Bisaan about four years ago?”
Not able to do much more than putter around the bunker, Dean dug into the library with a purpose, Miracle at his side, most of the time. While Sam slept, Dean scanned the Rowena files he wasn’t supposed to know existed on Sam’s computer.
There’s a shuffling noise on the other end. “Not sure yet, I’ll decide when I’m in Wyoming.”
Stephanie, a young woman with glasses and long brown hair neatly tucked into a ponytail, smiles sadly at him. “I’m sorry Mr. Novak, I won’t be able to make it.”
Frustrated, Sam puts down his fork and leans forward to tap his phone’s screen. “This description looks familiar, Dean. We both know what’s big, looks like a bear, but isn’t.”
With a nod, Castiel picks up a pen. “Are we talking half-caf, or double shot fortification?”
here?”
When he rounds the doorway, there's Cas, standing at the make table with his hands resting on the edge, head down. Dean brings the bucket over, places it on the steel surface with a clang, and wraps Cas up in his arms from behind. He can feel the tension drain out of his body, and he buries his face in the crook of Cas's neck, seeking comfort too. Cas makes a noise and tilts his to the side.
“Jolene, this guy wants to apply for the barista job.”
“Excuse me,” he manages to choke out as he makes his way back to the Impala, loosens his tie, and leans on the bumper with his hands, head bowed, catching his breath and shaking. This shouldn’t be possible, he thinks. Can they track me somehow? Why do they keep showing up near me?
Castiel wonders. He sees the row of knives attached to a magnetic strip along one wall. None of them will do much to an angel, but maybe…
...Mr. Winchester will not impress.
Castiel reels at the news. This means that Heaven is truly empty, if those who had been imprisoned are now free to take vessels. Not only that, but the angel responsible for letting Lucifer himself into the Garden is now in Sam’s body. Everything that has happened to humanity… and subsequently, Heaven, is all Gadreel’s fault.
One, who says his name is Ed, shows Dean to his closet of a room, with a small dresser crammed into the closet and just enough space for a narrow bed against the wall. He briefly socializes, grabs a couple slices of cold pizza someone was kind enough to hold to the side for him, and explains his hell-trip before excusing himself for a shower and to pass out. On his way back to his room, someone says there will be a shuttle to take them to work in the morning, and he sets his alarm before flopping on the bed with a sigh.
The problem is, Dean took this job in order to learn about working in the tech field, not to play errand boy. It’s boring and he’s frustrated, and he curses United airlines for somehow sending his suitcase to fucking Orlando. Even getting a daily glimpse of the very attractive CEO isn’t enough to make up for his overall boredom and frustration. How can he make a good impression and use them as a reference, when they’ll probably always see him as the jeans-wearing loser?
Shit, has he been that transparent? "I'm not the one comparing myself to movies, Cas."
“Yeah, Cas. I’ll live.”
“Well, I’ll make sure your shift is covered tomorrow regardless, so you get better, and if you get frisky, don’t forget protection.” That causes a furious flush to burn its way up Castiel’s face, and he can’t help but remember when Dean had used that word, not that long ago. He’d missed the meaning then, but not now.
Just a heads up.
. He nods, and Dean starts the car. They sit there a moment, the engine rumbling. He’s beginning to wonder why they haven’t left yet, until Dean says, “Well?”
Head hanging in shame, Castiel agrees. He spends the rest of the work day finishing the sandwich cookies she had started and cleans up. After five o’clock rolls around and the shop is closed, Castiel loiters at the stainless steel work table, wiping it down over and over with a bar cloth. The door opens and Jolene comes in, carrying a cup.
That attracts the attention of both man and beast, Miracle off the bed and down the hall in a flash. Cas looks so happy, and Dean wants to bottle this moment forever. Cas looks back at him, and he doesn’t have a big smile or anything, he just… radiates contentment. “I’ll go make coffee.”
“You wouldn’t have to be a girl, Cas. I’d do you anyway.” He says it almost flippantly, like he’s trying to make a joke. But Castiel’s seen this before, the way Dean deflects.
“If I need help I’ll call for you, okay?”
Dean is bored out of his mind. It’s the last week of June, the weather’s been decent, and he spends most of his time in the basement of this shitty building, only getting peeks at the windows when he does his rounds. What he wouldn’t give right now to be able to cruise in his dad’s classic Chevy around the lake. At least they’ve got a three-day weekend coming up since the 4th is on a Monday.
“So you’re Cas, huh?” Jody steps back and gives him a look up and down.
“That’s why we gotta get closer then,” Dean counters, pulling Castiel’s injured hand up so that arm will rest on his shoulder, another hand snaking around Castiel’s waist; he finds they are standing pressed close, bodies flush together, with the water cascading over both their shoulders.
“No Dean, I’m not.” Frustrated, Castiel throws down the cleaning towel in his hands. “I failed as an angel. Everything I did came out wrong. Since arriving here, I finally feel like I have a chance at getting things right.” He notices Dean’s eyes widen in surprise, his mouth part as if to speak. He doesn’t want to hear what Dean has to say. “Maybe you don’t understand, but… there’s a real human dignity in what I’m doing here.”
Dean tries to not stare into those blue eyes looking at him. “Heck yeah. After napping on the trip back, free food and fireworks sounds awesome.”
“Hmm,” Cas rolls onto his back. “That seems prudent for me as well.”
So when Dean met Castiel’s disapproving frown at his jeans that first day, and then got assigned to the mail room, he wasn’t surprised. But ever since, he’s been surprised by how Castiel seems… to actually like Dean now. He’d been expecting stuck up and pompous, and got… aloof and maybe a little awkward. And he’s trying to not think about how good Castiel looks with his sleeves rolled up, wide lips pursed and brow crinkled with concentration.
“I have work to do.” As tempting as it is to drop everything and go help Dean, Castiel has responsibilities. And besides, being kicked out of the Bunker still stings a bit. “If I discover anything new, I’ll call or text.”
“No, Dean! You’re still recovering! I’ll do it!”
Taking his glass from the nightstand, he waves his glass at Dean. “Gimme some more of that.”
Nodding, Castiel closes the door, turning the bolt to secure the lock, and enters the code for the alarm. Unable to withstand hearing Dean’s voice right now, he texts that it’s done instead of calling. He leans against the door and listens, and moments later the Impala roars to life. The sound of it fades and Dean pulls out onto the street, and away.
“I’ve had enough of this transphobic language. I realize you don’t know any better, but Jolene is a
“Enjoying the view?” Dean asks, lips twisted in a sly smile.
Sam’s eyes look away. “I told Dean I was Ezekiel.”
“Yeah. So…” Dean looks at his watch. “When do you have to be at work?”
Dean ended up getting to work later than he intended, because while he did enjoy about fifteen minutes extra free time, he forgot the bus stop near the apartment is every hour, so he had to look up other routes and walk four blocks, praying he’d catch the other one on time. But that one was late, and crowded, and he had to stand next to someone who smelled like a dirty diaper. So by the time he arrives in the conference room he’s a bit sweaty and rumpled. Thankfully, his boss doesn’t seem to mind or notice.
The short trip to the back door is made in silence, and Castiel has to force himself to reach for the door handle. This is it, Dean’s leaving now. No more reason to keep him around. Taking a deep breath, Castiel pulls the door open, the orange street light illuminating them. Dean drags his feet across the threshold, and turns back to Castiel, his face now in shadow.
Castiel pulls back, sitting on his heels, and he lets out a breath with a whoosh. This was not what he expected. Maybe for Dean to pull away, but not for the kiss to have lingered. His lips still tingle. Dean stands there, staring down at his hands, his breathing ragged. Is this when Dean will finally reject him? Say it was a mistake, that it was all a joke? The warmth from the whiskey suddenly becomes a chill, and Castiel feels the need to leave Dean’s room right now, before he can hear the rejection.
Dean’s voice has risen, and Cas places a hand on his arm. “Dean, Emma means a lot to me too, and that’s why I think she should help Sam.”
Cas gets up to let the dog in, who promptly bounds on the bed, covering Dean’s face in doggy kisses, making him laugh. It makes Cas laugh too. “No more kisses from me, until you wash your face. Breakfast?”
“Security will let you in, you’ll go to the top floor, and there will be directions to the roof entrance from there.”
“Why not?”
“It’s practically on the way back, and if it’s what I think it is, this should be an easy one.” Sam slides his phone back to his side of the table and tries to not make a face at the smears across the thing. Dean’s been weird about his recovery lately. Sure, it’s been rough, but he is getting better. And sitting around the bunker is just going to make them both soft.
In the kitchen, Jolene tries to pump him for information, but all Castiel will tell her is that Dean is a friend, and that he’s in town on business. “I saw the way you looked at him, he’s more than just a
While Suzie bemoans the lack of actual alcoholic add-ins at the cafe, Castiel sees the door open, and that familiar green jacket that Dean was wearing yesterday. He proceeds to ignore Dean as he rings in the order and makes the half-caf Americano with a shot each of chocolate and Irish Cream flavor. Handing it over to Suzie, he gives her a wink and a thumb’s up. “Good luck!”
After a brief speech about the opportunity to prove themselves and learn during their time with his company, Castiel hands the group off to someone who will give them a tour of the facilities before they are given their assigned tasks. As they walk away, Castiel frowns at the list of interns in his hands, writing "mail room" next to Dean Winchester's name. With a busy day ahead of him, Castiel soon puts the interns out of his mind.
While Dean is spewing swear words at a driver with their high beams on, Castiel’s phone beeps. The battery is getting low, since he didn’t plug it in last night. “Dean, my phone is running low on power, so I should probably go.”
“Christ.” There’s  a noise, like wind blowing across the microphone. “Look, Cas. I don’t do well with the whole… relationship thing, okay? Can’t we just act like we always do?”
Finding the two kids is easy enough, and for a minute Sam thinks they might escape without a fight until they see a row of masked figures standing at the entrance. There’s at least half a dozen, and some are bigger than Sam. This is gonna be a close one. After sending the two kids out the back, they engage the vampires.
Castiel binks up at him a moment. He wasn’t expecting Dean to recognise that at a glance. “Err, yes. I’m afraid my personal experience in office software doesn’t help me here.”
Dean’s voice sounds wrong. Sam turns, giving a look at his brother who still hasn’t moved from his slump against the post.
“Will you remind me why we’re doing this?” asks Castiel while he tucks some hair behind his ear while looking at himself with a hand mirror.
Dean blinks at him, whiskey glass loose in his grip. “I… I dunno, Cas. With you being the way you were? All uptight and
Dean watches as Cas turns toward the sink. Yeah. “I promise we’ll fix that as soon as Warden Sam says I’m allowed to drive again. We’ll go somewhere and get you something that fits better.”
They clink their bottles together, and Dean takes a long drink before digging into the pie. Castiel doesn’t take more than a couple bites and a sip of his beer, because it’s much later than he normally stays up, and he’s exhausted after everything that’s happened today. But of course, Dean’s accustomed to staying up late into the night, and appears to be just getting started. And of course Dean notices Castiel leaning heavily on the counter, his injured wrist in his lap.
For some reason, that argument sounds perfectly feasible, so Castiel hands over his glass, to which Dean adds more than the usual measure. “You gotta catch up to me, you know.”
Oh. He was staring again. Old habits are difficult to break. “N-no, still looking.”
“How is Sam’s recovery?” That should be a safe topic.
Castiel glances at where Sam’s holding Dean’s hand in both of his own.
“Yeah. Look,” Sam turns around, running a hand through his hair. “I talked with Jody. It’s really in Dean’s best interests if he doesn’t know about… what we do… quite yet, so I need to square some things up.”
The road flattens out, and a small river opens up into a beautiful, glistening lake to the left of the interstate. Another sign, just before a bridge, announces he’s looking at Lake Coeur d’Alene, and Castiel thinks, if the town is right next to the lake, he might like to stop and admire the view. The water is a lovely, deep blue-green, and Castiel almost pouts when his view is obstructed by terrain. As they enter the city proper, even though the lake can no longer be seen, he can tell it’s there, merely by observing the landscape beyond the trees.
The next morning, Jody drops him off on her way to the station. Expecting to see Sam sleeping awkwardly in his chair, Castiel enters the room to instead see a blue-white glow from Sam’s hand, lowering toward Dean’s head. Blinking in shock, Castiel can only think to say, “Sam?”
She leans back in her chair. "You want a piece of that intern's ass, don't you?"
There’s a Biggerson’s right across the street, and Dean leads him there with enthusiasm. With negative memories attached to the restaurant chain, it’s not a place Castiel would normally go, but the location fits Dean’s requirements so Castiel keeps his own thoughts silent. Once inside, they’re led to a booth near the back. As soon as they’re seated, Dean flips open the menu and starts looking at the burger section. Castiel is surprised to find he’s not hungry. When he mentions this, Dean insists he order something, that as soon as he’s got food in front of him, he’ll eat.
At first, they kept waiting for some kind of sign that Cas was alive again, in spite of Jack’s warning. But as days turned into weeks, Sam saw the light fade in Dean’s eyes. It’s why he’s made Dean the sole person responsible for Miracle. The dog sleeps in his room, has food and water bowls there. Sam pretends like he doesn’t see the way Dean cradles the dog in his arms and rocks, face buried in the soft tan fur. Fur very similar to a certain trenchcoat. He still doesn’t know what happened with Cas, and hasn’t felt like it’s his place to ask.
“Not anymore,” he says. “The smarter brother's back in town.”
“Yeah, don't mention it.” Sam responds, and Dean pulls the cord over his head for the first time in years and feels it settle against his chest with bittersweet familiarity. “Hey, Dean? What was it like?”
There’s a moment, where the two of them look at each other, crickets chirping around them and stars spinning above them, before—
Dean laughs again, so he doesn’t cry. “I think I know what he wanted, Jack. He wanted to save me, again, and all that got him was dead. Again. So spare me the bullshit, okay? Cas is gone, he’s not coming back, and I ain’t gonna beg you to bring him back. That’s not me.”
She scrubs one hand over her face. “Oh,” is all she can muster up.
“Ramiel, Prince of Hell. It’s catchy. It rhymes,” Crowley muses. “And he’s going to kill you if you try to take his toy.”
“Dean,” Bobby says with uncharacteristic seriousness. “The fact the Witnesses rose means a seal has been broken. One down, only so many to go until Judgement Day is upon us.”
“We weren’t sure how powerful Jack was, though, so we tried to see if we could meet with Chuck and have him make everything right again.” Two quick squeezes from Cas. “Relax, we didn’t think it’d work. And we figured Chuck had us right where he wanted us, anyhow: broken down and feeling defeated.” Dean pauses. “Honestly? He did. All three of us were… none of us were in a good way,” Dean confesses. Cas’ thumbs rubs reassuringly across Dean’s knuckles, and he can’t help but smile. “Yeah, so. We asked, he refused; said he was enjoying it, actually. Sick bastard.” Cas squeezes his hand once—in agreement, if Dean had to guess.
“Dean. Let’s go home.”
“Yeah, you're preachin' to the choir,” Dean replies.
Dean laughs, tastes saltwater. “Cas. I love you, too.”
“It was an angel.”
, Dean thinks,
“No. The Princes are all dead,” Castiel disagrees.
Between one blink and the next, Deanna and Castiel shift from the dingy motel room to a living room, with a man seated on the couch, cutting out a section of a newspaper.
For now, he swallows it all down, and quietly says, “Heya, Sammy.”
Castiel sighs. “A good friend.”
The bastard has the nerve to grin, smugly, and throw up a pair of jazz hands. “In the flesh.”
“And by the way,” the angel sneers. “Raphael says hello.”
Now, Deanna sits bleary-eyed in the kitchen, watching the
“Force of habit, sorry,” Sam apologizes. “What are you doing up?”
“Pleasure,” the hunter and the angel say in unison, still eyeing each other suspiciously. Bobby lowers the shotgun, at least.
He doesn't bother crying out; no one is coming.
to want, Deanna.”
“I didn’t intend for my absence to be so lengthy,” he replies, still staring unblinkingly at her. “I was wondering if, perhaps, we might speak inside?”
“Wait, you—you're saying your nukes are loose?”
“I believe…” Castiel interrupts, “the hairless ape has the floor.”
Balthazar turns to face Castiel. “Castiel, I stood for you in Heaven. Are you going to let—”
“He just... gave it to you?” Deanna scoffs. “Ah, come on. He didn't just give it to you, did he, Aaron?”
She doesn’t even hesitate, or make a quippy comment; she aims the Colt and fires, hitting Ramiel in the center of his back. A perfect kill shot.
Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Cas and Balthazar moving towards her, and Bobby barking commands at the hunters and angels alike to check bodies and to
To his credit (or maybe he’s just a little too South of sober to care), he doesn’t startle. “What’s up, kid?” Dean says, proud of himself for not slurring his words. Jack furrows his brow, looking at Dean with mild disappointment sketched into his youthful features. He raises a hand and
Deanna sighs. “Castiel, this is me praying to you. I know you’re busy leading a revolution or whatever, but—”
After catching Sam up on everything, first Cas then Bobby disappear from the room, the latter giving her brother’s shoulder a squeeze and a muttered,
“Everything you said about me? You were right. That’s how I see myself. And the fact that you said it, made me hear it… that didn’t erase that image I have. But honestly? If you hadn’t said all that, Chuck might be dead. Because all I’ve been able to think about since you died was what you said. That hasn’t always been a good thing, though, man. I—I’ve dreamt of nothing else except you getting taken, hardly done anything but drink and mope. But—I want—I just
Immediately, Dean turns to look at Cas, who is already looking back at him. Tears stream down Castiel’s face, which is lit up by a smile as bright as the sun.
Cas pipes down eventually, and Dean grimaces as he remembers the ordeal with Jimmy and Amelia and Claire. He jots that detail down and underlines it before turning to Bobby, casually asking, “Up for a ride?”
It’s painful enough that Cas considers asking him to stop, but their deal makes him hold back. He nearly goes soft, but Dean pulls his mouth away and murmurs, “You’re gonna cum like this, whether you want to or not.” and presses a gentle kiss to the bitemark. “We’ve got all day.” Cas can feel his mouth twisting into a smile against his aching skin.
“And just where do you think you’re going?”
taught you that?” Dean releases his mouth, but Cas just gasps into the sheets. Dean yanks his head up by a handful of his hair. “I said,” He presses his mouth against his ear. “
Dean calls Crowley into his lap with a crook of his finger. Cas watches with bewilderment as the ever arrogant King straddles Dean’s lap and begins kissing his neck. Dean gives him a smug look over Crowley’s head. Cas forces his eyes away, trying to ignore the stab of pain in his chest. He shoves his fingers in one more time and decides that he doesn’t care if it hurts. He just wants... he has to admit it to himself. What he wants more than anything is to get Crowley off of Dean. And if that means Crowley gets on top of
“Well that’s too bad,” He leans in and lick a line up Cas’ thigh. “’Cuz I do.” He pulls his fingers free with a slick noise that makes Cas cringe. “And you’re gonna
“You should learn to ask for things. Don’t want you forgetting who’s in charge here.” Cas pulls his hands away. Shame burns in his cheeks, despite it being such a small mistake, it stings to be scolded. “Ask to touch me.” Dean pulls his head up by his hair.
“Please, Dean, please!” The tears spill over. Cas’ desperate at this point, his shame transformed into need. “Please, Crowley.” He looks at both of them with wet, begging eyes. Dean and Crowley look at each other and come to a silent agreement. Dean grips Cas cock tight and begins a fast, hard pace. The dual stimulation of their hands inside and out has Cas writhing on the bed, whimpering out their names.
His fingers are just barely touching him, but it makes Cas’ blood run hot and fast in his veins. He’s imagined it so, so many times, and the reality is even better. He wonders how amazing it’d be if the situation was different. He pushes the though from his head, right now he needs to focus on doing what he’s asked. Dean slips his loosely-circled fingers slowly up and down. Cas can’t quite stifle a gasp, the pleasure that radiates from where Dean’s fingers are brushing makes his toes curl.
the kind of thing I like to hear.” He strokes himself as he looks at Cas’ face. Cas burns with humiliation. Dean cocks his head to the side and licks his lips. “Take the shirt off.” Cas forces his hands into motion. He tugs the shirt off and sets his hands on his thighs. His shins ache from being pressed to the wood floor, but he doesn’t dare readjust.
the smirk in his voice. He slips them down his legs and kicks them into the pile. He stands naked before Dean and fights the urge to use his hands to cover himself, because he knows that’s not what Dean wants.
Dean takes a long, hungry look at him. “Damn. Knew you’d look good in my clothes. That trench coat’s been hiding too much.” He wraps an arm around Cas’ waist, his hand straying under the hem of the shirt. A shiver runs up Cas spine as Dean’s fingers stroke his lower back. “Although I
“Who’s Hannah?” Dean’s eyes are narrowed and his voice pitched low.
Without warning, three of Crowley’s thick fingers plunge into him. He gasps. Despite stretching himself so much, he can’t help but tense up.
Stricken by a sudden sense of defiance, Cas mumbles under his breath, “Getting right to it.” Crowley barks out a laugh and Dean raises an eyebrow. Cas looks down at his lap, surprised by his own attitude. He’s startled by Crowley’s hand pulling him up by his shoulder. He pulls him into a sitting position and strokes his cheek with his free hand.
Cas stops a few feet before him. He knows Dean isn’t
Cas shudders. Crowley makes a low, pleased sound as he tightens around his hand. “I love... getting stuffed.” His face flushes an even deeper shade of pink. The humiliation burns hot in his blood, but it doesn’t put a damper on his arousal.
how much Dean likes it. Dean’s kissing his neck with something like desperation. His teeth sink in deep enough to make Cas cry out in pain, which only excites Dean more. He bites lower, in the junction of his neck and shoulder.
“Why?” Castiel lowers the mirror. She already knows Steve isn’t his real name.
Not knowing how to answer that, Castiel kisses Dean on the lips. One kiss turns into two, then three, and then they’re exploring each other’s mouths with their tongues again, holding each other close. It’s Dean who backs away, hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “If we keep that up, we’re never getting out of here.”
“Just give me a minute, it’s a lot to process.”
Behind Ephraim, Castiel can see the kitchen door move. Right now, he can only hope it’s Dean, and makes sure to focus back on the angel threatening his life. Teeth clenched, Castiel hisses, “But I want to live.”
When his fingers stroke along Cas's lower abdomen, he feels his hips rock forward. So he explores further, fingertips dipping just under the waistband, and Cas growls. Oh yeah, it's on. Bolder now, he whispers encouragement in Cas's ear, as he palms the hard length straining against the already snug front of his pants. Hips snap sharply forward, Cas letting out a shout at the contact.
Thinking back to a lesson he learned from Frank Deveraux years ago, Dean puts on a smile, pats Sam on the back, and grabs his keys so they can get some supplies for the bunker, and for Miracle.
at him that way…
“Hello, Castiel. I’m surprised you remember me. I was nobody, but you — You were a legend.” Ephraim looks around the kitchen, scuffs his feet on a no-slip mat, grazes his fingers along a counter. “This is my first time in a human body. It’s… intense.”
. Somehow, Castiel’s jeans don’t seem so uncomfortable anymore.
But that burn for
He licks his lips. "I thought we weren't analyzing characters, Cas?"
“Go back to sleep, Cas I had to visit the bathroom.”
“Dean, I—”
“No, it’s your turn to listen.” Dean squeezes the hand he’s still holding onto. “I should have told you, back in Purgatory.”
Daniels County, Montana
Uneasy with the thought of having his belongings discovered at work without him there, Castiel had brought everything with him. That being the case, all he places in the back of her car is a duffel bag and a tightly rolled sleeping bag. During the drive, Jody tries to make conversation.
“Oh.” Castiel makes himself look at the figure lying on the bed. Except for his chest moving up and down, he’s so very still. Feeling completely useless, he forces himself to notice the plastered arm, the bandages around Dean’s neck and head, the tubes coming out of his nose, the wires and IV tubing sprouting from the edge of the blanket.
“Ooh, Licorice! You’ve got taste, my man.” Dean tears open the bag without a second thought. “You mind tossing the popcorn in the nuker?”
“C’mon, man. Let’s get this apron off, and your sleeve rolled up.” ‘
Sam leads Cas back to Dean’s room, where he appears peaceful in his drug-induced slumber. Another wave of exhaustion rolls over Sam, and he suggests they both go back to Jody’s for food and showers.
Another customer comes in, ordering a flavored iced tea and chocolate cookie to go. Dean places his pie plate in the bus-bin, and leans against the counter on his elbows. It makes him look vulnerable, and Castiel wonders if Dean is trying to manipulate him. ‘
Might be a little OOC, IDK, but Dean's learning new habits. re-thinking how life's supposed to work.
Sam’s words hurt. Yes, Castiel didn’t remember who he was, but had felt, at some level, his connection to Heaven. He’d felt a sense of purpose, even though he didn’t know why. And his affinity for Dean had persisted; he couldn’t resist the man’s pull even though he didn’t remember him.
“No, Dean. I need to say this.” Castiel knows he needs to say it before he loses his nerve.
He’s nervous, hands shaking as he picks up the cup. The coffee smells alright, at least. When he takes a sip, he’s expecting bitter, or sour, for the milk to taste scalded… but it’s actually good. Surprised, Castiel takes another sip.
As Castiel is thinking he should just go back to the library, a new customer person enters the establishment, a young man in a suit. He immediately goes to the counter, calling out an order for what Castiel assumes is coffee, but the order involves a combination of words he can’t decipher. Double shot? One pump? But Bernie seems to understand and jumps to the task. Fascinated by the process, Castiel watches from the side as a single drink is made with an interesting machine. He’d seen the Winchesters make coffee before, but it involved paper filters and a much simpler device that featured a glass jug.
Dean’s mouth lifts in a half smile, and he glances up at Castiel’s face before focusing on rolling up the pink shirt’s sleeve. “Worse, I think.”
“What? But… ” His eyes focus, and Cas bolts upright. “Dean! Are you?—”
With a nod, Dean straightens up from where he was leaning over the table. “Be right back, I gotta get some things from the car.”
It's getting harder to help the guy stay upright, so with his hips, he pushes Cas forward, pressing him against the table for support. One hand ends up in Dean's hair, fingers tangled in the strands and tugging. Oh yeah, he can work with this. He bites at that stubbled jaw, works his way down to the stretched collar of Cas's borrowed t-shirt, one of Dean's older ones. Oh, and doesn't that spark a possessiveness deep within him, Cas wearing his clothes.
“What?” Dean’s eyes widen, making him look childish. “Oh, I, uhh…”
“You need some painkillers, buddy? I have some in the car.”
. It doesn’t matter who or what she used to be. Yes, we took advantage of her status to change my look as well, few people bothering to comment when I changed to a more feminine appearance. But while I accepted a new name, I still consider this body male. I feel no need to take it any further than that.”
He'd prefer this lying down, but he's not taking any chances that Cas would want to put a stop to it if he were thinking more clearly. Cas has one hand gripping the table for support, the other still tangled in Dean's hair, and he's so deliciously noisy like this, Dean can't get enough.
Someone vacates the chair at the head of the table as Castiel stands there, surveying the collection of young men and women. He’d asked for weekly evaluations yesterday, so everybody would know their new assignments before the weekend. Their supervisors had given recommendations as to their next placement, and except for a few exceptions, everyone is going where they were suggested.
In a roundabout way, Sam asks if Dean’s found something. He has. Along with the vaguest hints of a hunt, Dean found a pie festival in Ohio. If it snaps Dean out of his funk for a while, Sam’s all for it.
“I’m glad. He seemed well when…” How does he finish that sentence? A petty part of him wants to say, ‘when you kicked me out.’ But what good would that do? Dean will leave soon, and he wants to enjoy this time together.
(See the end of the chapter for
This was supposed to be combined with Dean's heaven, but the Heaven section has grown past the original 400 word ficlet I started out with in notes, so I'll get back to you shortly with that part.
"Yeah?"
This makes him pause. Castiel had once asked Dean what he’d prefer, peace or freedom. Could this be his opportunity to give Dean both? “And you?” he asks Sam. “What will you do? Hunt behind Dean’s back for the rest of your lives?”
Sam scans the barn for movement, then puts his machete away, turning to Dean. “Alright. Let's go find those kids, get them outta here before more show up.”
He needed that.
Dean Winchester, at the counter near the door, frowning and flicking at a bag gourmet coffee with his fingers. Suddenly, Castiel’s head itches, and he tries to not swipe the blond fringe out of his eyes. Heart pounding in his ears, he can’t look away as Dean’s eyes slowly travel up to meet his. There’s a moment of confusion, then incredulity, and then something unreadable.
Sam glances up at him, not stopping his movements. “Hey,” he clears his throat. “Well, we kind of left Crowley chained up in the bunker’s dungeon, with Kevin watching over him, and I was gonna stop and check on a case along the way…”
bacon.”
Ah, good. But if Dean is getting out of the tub, will he need assistance with anything? He should ask, and braces for more rejection. It takes a moment before he asks, “Are you going to need help getting dressed?”
“Cool, I’ll just go wait in the car.”
The doctors leave the room after checking Dean over, and Sam stretches in his chair, his long legs extending under the hospital bed. He lets out a jaw-cracking yawn, and Cas looks up from the paperback he borrowed from Jody.
Castiel sits at the dining table and eats slow. It doesn’t taste over-salted and processed like what he usually eats, and it’s wonderful. The bread is still soft and fresh, instead of stale and soggy like the past-date discounted sandwiches he gets from the store usually are. Sam wolfs down his food, takes a quick shower, and returns to the hospital. Jody suggests Castiel get a good night’s sleep and go back during the day. He agrees.
“It’s not…” He can’t finish that sentence with Dean in the room.
“Oh, and I have to wait for Jolene to get back, too.”
After all the tubes and wires get reconnected to Dean, Sam, Jody and Cas are herded into an office to have Dean’s condition explained to them, what the amnesia means, and how to progress with further prognosis and treatment. They’re told that the effect could be permanent or temporary, and there’s no way to tell which way it will go, without further testing. She says that usually, cases of complete autobiographical loss but retention of declarative memory are typically psychosomatic.
Back in the bunker, the silence feels almost deafening. Sam manages to get off the phone with Eileen long enough to sort through sending out mass messages to everyone in their circle of contacts. By the time he’s done, it’s late and Dean’s halfway through a bottle of whiskey, minus the glass.
When Castiel looks up at Dean, he catches the young man licking his lips as he looks down Castiel’s body.  “Huh?” Dean responds, before looking back up to meet Castiel’s eyes. “Oh, yeah, sure. We can take care of that.”
Dean’s breath is already gurgling, indicating at least a punctured lung. Something survivable if he can only get Dean help, stop the bleeding. But Dean asks him to stay with him, and Sam does.
“I have something to tell you, Sam.”
“Make sure you lock the door and set the alarm, okay?”
A lump in his throat, Castiel closes his eyes and takes deep breaths. It’s just a meal. Dean doesn’t often get to eat something other than fast food, so that’s all this is. As soon as the Rit-Zien is dealt with, Dean will leave, and everything will go back to the way things were.
, he has to stop thinking about these things.
After exchanging goodbyes, he ends the call and sets the phone on the counter. The day has been way too long, and he still needs to finish cleaning up and get a shower before going to sleep. Shoulders slumped and head drooping, he stifles a yawn.
“Should we let him in?”
Dean managing to grate out two whole sentences have their discussion grinding to a halt, and Sam turns to see him looking at them with a frown. They both make their cases to him, and await his verdict. Thankfully, Dean goes with Sam’s idea to wait, at least for now. Sam hopes they won’t need to wait long.
Cas’s grace doesn’t come back after a couple of days and they determine, while Cas isn’t fully human, he’s not an angel anymore either. Sam and Dean both reassure him that doesn’t matter, what matters is he’s alive.
Well, it definitely looks like a bear at first glance. But bears don’t have the large and pointy ears that are characteristic of a bugbear. They also don’t use tools as often, either. On the grainy security footage, they watch as the “bear” picks up a long, hefty stick to flip over the dumpster lid before hauling itself in. Great. Bugbears are usually harmless. When they live in a proper wilderness area with plenty of space to roam. But when people start disturbing their habitats, it can get bad. Now Sam just hopes there’s only one of them.
“Dean?!” The feeling of cold metal against his cheek quiets him. It’s not the edge, but the threat is still clear. “Dean, what are you doing?” He’s surprised by how soft and scared his own voice sounds.
“But what about Demons?” Dean’s eyes flash black. “I’m sure you don’t like hanging around
Dean groans, the slick sounds of him jerking off filling the room. Cas lets his head fall to the side so he can look. Dean’s eyes have shifted down to Crowley’s barely moving arm. His eyebrows furrow and he stands, letting his hand fall to his side. He comes to stand next to Crowley.
“May I touch you, Dean?” Cas stares up at the table. He’s once again grateful for the barrier. “Please?” He’s found that a please always helps with humans. He flinches as he reminds himself that that’s not what Dean is anymore. It’s still so painful to remember.
“What are we doing here, Dean?” He slips out from under Dean’s arm (although he half-expected him to tug him back) and takes a few steps away. Being physically separated from Dean helps clear his mind. He can barely think when Dean’s body is pressed to his.
place.” Dean’s familiar contempt for Crowley makes Cas smile, just slightly. But the image of the two
“But-”
“I-” Cas’ voice cracks as Dean catches his eye. “I’m...” Dean’s gaze paralyzes him. Knock his thoughts from his head. It’s dripping with
Dean’s eyes dart to the chair beside the bed. Suddenly, he looks so sad that Cas can barely stand to look at him. He pulls his hand back and wipes it on the bedsheets, uncaring of the mess. Dean laughs, low and soft, and for a moment Cas is sure he’d slipped back into his callous, demonic headspace.
“Now take it in your mouth- ah, just the head for now.” Cas sucks gently, the thought occurs to him that he’s doing more than ordered, but Dean’s hitched breath reassures him that he’s doing well. “Mmm, good boy. You’re doing even better than I expected.”
it?” Crowley’s mouth turns up into a knowing smirk as Dean speaks. Cas shudders. He has to admit at this point that he’s enjoying Crowley’s attention, but Dean’s will always hit him differently than anyone else’s.
Cas sucks in a deep breath. “Yes, I’ll be out in just a moment.” He shuts the water off and steps out.
He pushes the thought away. Right now, he just needs to focus on enjoying what he’s doing. He slides the flat of the blade up Cas thigh, over his vulnerable groin and belly. The back of the knife catches on Cas’ nipple, forcing a soft gasp out of him. He’s not aroused, can’t be, but the amount of power that Dean holds over him in this moment puts butterflies in his stomach. Of course, Dean can control him purely though the power of their deal, but the physical domination puts Cas in a strange, strangely pleasurable headspace. He balances on the knife edge between loving and hating being subjugated by the man he’s in love with. And the more Dean does it, the more Cas’ learning to enjoy it. Even in this terrifying situation, with a tool of violence hovering over his bare throat, he can’t deny that the flush on his cheeks isn’t purely from fear.
Cas lifts his head. Dean’s eyes lock on his, the intimate gesture sends another jolt of pleasure through him. Dean’s small smile stretches across his face into almost a snarl. His hand tightens almost enough to hurt. The first stroke sends Cas’ head crashing back into the pillow, the ones after send frantic moans out of his mouth.
TW for knives, cutting, blood.
“Crowley.”
“Mhm.” Crowley doesn’t spare him a glance. He seems just as captivated as Dean now. Relaxed, now that Cas’ taking it without struggle. He can shrug off Dean’s watchful gaze and enjoy himself like he’d intended to do in the first place. He carefully moves his fingers into a proper fist, drinks in Cas’ little whimpers.
“Those’re some sweet little noises you’re making.” Dean’s voice drops to a growl. “You sure love being pinned down and
“Mine? Yup. I’ve been wanting to see you in my clothes since, like,
Cas tries to tune out Dean’s jeers, but he never could ignore his voice. Dean whistles as he loosens his tie and pulls it over his head. He tosses the clothes in a pile beside him as he strips.
Dean’s throat clicks as he swallows. Arousal burns through him, making his mind fuzzy. He slips the slit open underwear off of Cas. Naturally, he’s soft. Unaroused. But Dean takes a certain sick satisfaction in being the only one getting any enjoyment out of this. He doesn’t like to admit it, but Cas’ reminder of their time limit is hitting him hard. He’s not ready to give this up. Won’t be ready in five days. Might not
. Crowley pipes up with an annoying
Cas tries to stand, but Dean’s arm squeezes him tight to his chest. He awkwardly shoves his underwear down and kicks them off his legs.
“Wooah, now don’t get too excited.” Dean pins him firmly against the wall with the length of his body. “Demons don’t really have the same emotions, you know.” Cas knows. But hearing him say it still pierces his heart. Tears slip silently down his cheeks, he can’t help it. “Oh, don’t cry.” Dean presses pecks over the tear trails. It’s comforting, but Cas can’t stop. A sob tears it’s way out of him.
“Good. I’m gonna hold you to that.” Dean’s eyes finally slide away from him and Cas isn’t sure how he hadn’t crashed the car. Now that he isn’t captured by Dean’s undivided attention, Cas registers the fact that they’re on a dirt road approaching a heavily wooded area. They appear to be in the middle of nowhere and yet Dean navigates the old roads with ease.
and pulls a small remote from his pocket. Cas pulls fruitlessly at his bonds as panic washes over him.
Crowley turns his head to look at the three fingers shoved inside him. “Doubt that.”
Cas tries to think back on what he was dreaming about as he pushes himself upright. Most of it slips though his fingers, but he gets glimpses of hands, so very many hands, touching him all over. Every time he’d pry one off, another would reach out from the dark. He shakes the nightmare from his head, it’s not important.
“Don’t worry about it.”
fisting
“I- I don’t know.” Cas has to fight to maintain eye contact. His shame sits heavy in his gut. “I’m sorry, Dean. I really don’t know.”
“Damn, angel. This grace shit really has you down, huh?” Dean reaches down and ruffles his hair, teasing, but not cruelly.
“No.” Cas hasn’t felt truly unsafe with Dean in so long... but the way Dean’s looking at him makes his blood run cold. “I finally found you. I’m not going to run away.” Dean’s gaze is sharp and predatory. Cas has the irrational thought that he’s about to be eaten.
This takes place on the same day as the previous, but after the
“But, Dean-”
“Now just look what you did.” Dean nudges Crowley’s shoulder with his elbow, teasing him.
“What? I don’t get to decide what happens to me? I’m not letting anyone control me, not anymore.” He turns into a long gravel driveway. “In fact, not only are you not going to control me,” He stops the car and turns to face Cas again. “I’m going to control
“Guess you need to get cleaned up again, huh?” He detaches the bar and undoes the cuffs with practiced precision. Cas holds the question of
"Yes, Dean?" Castiel croaks, his voice rough from hours of crying. Dean wants to pull him into his arms and never let go. But anger is still burning in his stomach. Still, this is his boyfriend. He needs to take care of him, no matter what.
"Dean." Castiel grabs his arm, pulling on it in desperation. "I really haven't thrown them away. I swear on everything that's holy to me."
The arrival of their waitress pulls Castiel out of his thoughts. She looks nice. With an easy smile on her face, a tea towel over her shoulder, and a notepad in hand, she raises an eyebrow as she takes in the scene in front of her.
That gets his attention. He stares at Dean, his eyes comically wide. “Dean, you don’t have to—”
"Good morning, Dean," Castiel says, relishing the brush of fingertips and the little static zap that almost always accompanies it. Dean doesn't even flinch anymore, and he gives Castiel a bright smile before he waves and moves along to continue his deliveries.
Castiel blinks. They’ve had this discussion before, microwaves don’t emit nuclear radiation. But it’s a colloquialism apparently, and he’s learned to not argue semantics with Dean about slang terms. After carefully reading the instructions, he places the packet into the device as shown, and sets the timer. The TV comes on while he watches the popcorn rotate, and Dean starts changing channels.
Chapter 2: Still before the events of BaM
As soon as Cas is out of the room, Dean puts his face in his hands. Shit, how did this all go sideways? He should have just kept his mouth shut. Okay. Movies. What should they watch next? He’s debating between
With a sigh, Dean turns off the stove, breakfast cooked, and fills up a mug with coffee to lure Cas out of bed for the day.
Meg interrupts, "May keep you from acting on it, but it doesn't keep you from wanting."
He can’t get rid of the smile on his face the whole way back down to the basement. It’s not until he’s stepping off the elevator, when he thinks,
“Hmm.” Dean raises his beer, his voice hoarse when he speaks. “To everyone that we lost along the way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ephraim slowly stalks toward him from the far end of the table. Just a little bit more… It’s getting difficult to tell if he’s actually drawing anything properly in blood.
“So… Cas,” Dean leans closer and Castiel reciprocates, bringing their faces closer together. “We can’t stay here all night, and it’s starting to get crowded.”
“Yeah, but…” Dean turns on his stool to face him. “What if, because I took you to the crime scene, that triggered something?”
“Yeah, join you in a minute.” But first he needs to wash his face if he wants any more kisses from Cas.
Any more I write for these characters will most likely be AUs.
When the door closes behind her, Castiel lets out a deep sigh. “Do you have any idea how hard it’s been? Falling to Earth, losing my Grace, I… had nothing.”
“For your head, or your wrist. If either still hurt.”
But what is Castiel supposed to do in this situation? He left his blade at Jody’s, thinking it would be unneeded.
And that's that. Cas grabs their plates, the popcorn bowl, and tries to grab the bucket they use for beers.
do. But apparently that’s off the menu for a while, thanks to his injury.
When they stop to make dinner, Cas sneaks a peek at the news channels, only to find more insanity. When they settle back on the couch, Cas says it’s his turn to pick what they watch, and Dean rolls his eyes when he selects
They make their way to the cafe counter and while Castiel makes them coffees, Jolene ponders names. “We can’t have something too girly. Do you have any sisters?”
“It’s okay, Cas. I’ll heal the old fashioned way.”
Fridays usually involve staying late, as Castiel dislikes the crush of traffic as people scramble to get home for the weekend. It's not like he has much of a life outside the office, anyway. The last thing Castiel looks at before leaving the office is the stack of weekly intern reports. They're scattered throughout the company, and after the first month, will be evaluated and switched around.
“And you learned how to do this on the internet?”
“I’ve got it in my pocket,” Emma says, showing the reflective blue armband. “And I’ll wear the official jacket this time too, just in case.” She sweeps her bangs to the side revealing her circular LED, peacefully cycling blue. “I trust you guys can handle your own lunch, and the pharmacy has your medication ready, so I’ll stop and get that on my way back.”
“Yeah, I should get outta your hair, let you get some rest.” Dean’s mood turns pensive, his mouth a thin line.
And here we goooo!
“Thinking too hard, if you didn’t hear my question.”
After calming down, a little, Castiel insists Sam know the truth.
“That’s going to be part of your new identity. Open it up, I want to see how it fits.”
Cas’s brows scrunch, his mouth turning down. Then he groans. That’s it, buddy. Time to wake up. A deep breath, and Cas opens his eyes. He blinks, then those eyes turn to Dean. For a second, Dean’s breath catches. “There you are.”
Sam drags himself into consciousness. Some days are better than others, but recuperating from the trials is taking a long time. Once he manages to open his eyes, he sees that Dean’s not in the room, his bag already packed and ready to go. Large quantities of coffee are required. And a shower. Having to bend over to get his head wet under the weak spray, Sam misses the showers at the bunker. While he doesn’t think he’ll ever consider it as some place permanent, it does have some nice amenities.
When Dean hands Castiel the remote, he wonders what they should watch. He hasn’t bothered with much television himself, other than the news and a couple afternoon shows. While scrolling through the menu, he spies a show that features monster hunting similar to what the Winchesters do for a living. Is it considered forcing a memory if they watch a fictional story similar to their own lives? Dean notices what he’s paused on, and Castiel rushes to explain his decision. Dean seems willing to watch the show, so he clicks on it.
Dean sets down his cup. “I’m here,” he leans on his elbows, curving forward, voice low. “Because I wanted to see how you were doing, make sure you’re OK.”
Fans of Misha should be familiar with this shirt.
Dean fumbles with the cardboard and places it back on the table, then hides his hands in his lap. “He’s, uh… he’s doing good.”
The thought of Dean ordering for him makes heat rise up the back of Castiel’s neck. There must be something wrong with him, because this is starting to remind him of dates he’s seen on television. Food. Yes, he really should eat something.
“Nah, just… surprised me is all.” Dean coughs and pulls up the waistband of his trousers. “Let’s do this.”
The whiskey is potent, and Castiel stops drinking once he runs out of soda. Dean drinks a sizeable amount, drinking it straight when his root beer is finished. The shared popcorn makes it halfway through the first movie, the licorice by the end of it. They share the pork rinds through the beginning of the second Indiana Jones movie, since it turns out the channel is running a marathon.
“Over my dead body.” Dean’s counter caused Sam to wince. Hey, he’d take whatever advantage he had. “It has to be me, Sam. The spell requires a strong bond to the one we want to pull out.”
A nurse enters the room, Cas on her heels. She tries to get Dean to open his eyes, who seems to resist the idea, until she turns off the overhead light. Slowly, Dean manages to open his eyes, and looks to Sam, who gives his hand a squeeze. With the nurse here, he’s unsure how much to say, so he just gives Dan one of their knowing looks they’ve come to share over the years.
After what feels like an embarrassing amount of time, Dean manages to stumble back, breaking eye contact. "Uh, sorry. The, uh... secretary wasn't at her desk, so... yeah. I'll just..." His flailing hands manage to tip over a cup of pens and they scatter across the floor. "Shit," Dean cringes at the swear word coming out of his own mouth, scrambling to pick up the pens and stuff them back into the cup. One rolled all the way near the door, and as he crams the last one into the cup, he clears his throat, cheeks burning as avoided looking at the still-seated man as he places the cup back on the desk. Turning on his heel, Dean rushes out of the office and back to his mail cart. The secretary, now at her desk, watches him with a confused expression.
He rushes into his office, grabbing a couple of envelopes that need to go out before end of day. “I don’t have stamps, and Meg usually handles those things, so I hope that’s alright?”
Sam’s shoulders slump, and he rests his hands on the table. “Actually, it would be great if you could stay here with Jody and keep an eye on Dean?”
, Dean. No matter how much I realize I’ll never have them, the longing is still there.” He misses that feeling he used to get from Dean that almost made him feel wanted in return. Maybe not the same way, but it was some form of longing, wanting Castiel by his side. He misses that so much.
At the door, he stops and turns to Castiel, pointing at him. “And don't get attacked by any more angels while I’m gone, OK?”
“Do you have any plans for Independence Day?”
While they’re catching their breath, there’s the sound of approaching boots and, “Ugh, GUYS WE EAT IN HERE!”
"What?"
Castiel leans forward, gesturing at his nametag. “It’s Misha now,” he hisses.
This is the problem with diversifying his company. Sure, the head of the department proposing the deal knows cars, but Castiel sometimes wishes he’d never given into his family’s suggestions of expanding. He had liked being a small business owner who personally knew all his employees. Now, there are more people whose names he doesn’t know than he does know. It’s quite a change from when he first started the business four years ago, right on the heels of graduating university with a dual major of business and software engineering.
? Castiel doesn’t understand. He says so.
Dean rushes inside, Emma in tow, to see an urgent news report about androids having taken over a broadcast in Detroit, demanding equal rights.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I… I have to…” Only knowing he can’t sit in that office another moment longer, Sam stumbles out of his chair and into the brightly lit hallway. If Dean can’t remember anything, is he still Dean? What about their lives? How will Sam be able to take him back to the bunker, where a prophet of the Lord and the former King of Hell await their return? And what about Cas, the former angel, with his brethren after his head? Is this what Gadreel couldn’t fix?
Dean smacks his leg and grumbles, “Shut it.”
“Uh, yeah? I mean, yes, boss?” Dean looks at Cas, whose hands are clenched around the handle of his briefcase satchel thing, his eyes lowered.
It sends him into a spiral of negative thoughts throughout most of Dean’s nap. Is he expected to stay? Should he prepare to leave? Where will he go?
Cas groans and Dean kisses his shoulder. “Hope she enjoyed the show,” Dean mumbles.
“After what you told me right before the Empty swallowed you up, did you seriously think I’d leave you there?”
Dean stares at him numbly. Sam’s shipping him off to… a ranch? Literally being sent out to pasture? “Aren’t you forgetting, that if I can’t hunt, I sure as hell can't sling bales of hay or work a pitchfork. The hell, Sam?”
Where the incident took place isn’t difficult to find, with an area by the yellow buses cordoned off, and law enforcement at the scene. There’s even someone in a hazmat suit. They get out of the car, and Dean instructs Castiel to follow his lead. Dressed in a white shirt and tie, Castiel smooths his hand down the green and blue striped polyester that Dean had tied at his throat.
While he takes a sip of coffee, Jolene gives him an incredulous look. “I could tell you cleaned in here last night, plus the wig, and you hurt yourself.” She leans against the counter as she continues. “You had a
“Yes, Dean. We’ll talk later.”
While not perfect, what Castiel lacks in skill he makes up for with enthusiasm. He’s only a trainee to start, but he shows up diligently at 4 a.m. every day he’s scheduled to help with prep. It’s too early for a shower at Fresh Start, but there is a 24-hour gas station nearby where he can tidy up. He can use the shelter’s showers when necessary, at least until he’s saved up enough to find a place to live.
Castiel sighs and mumbles, “Okay.”
Cas faces forward in his seat, hands clasped between his knees. “I’m the young man in the coat, Dean. A warrior with principles, who found… someone who fascinated him.” He turns to Dean. “I know you hate being compared to a female in any way, but when we met, you overflowed with purpose and potential.”
Castiel is fascinated with the golden glow of Dean’s eyes in this lighting. “Then what do you suggest?” he whispers.
For those who skipped the barn and can't manage to read about the wake: They hold it outside Sioux Falls and tons of hunters show up to celebrate Dean's life. Eileen is with him, and after the wake they go back to the bunker together.
He learns the names of the regulars, their preferred daily orders, and when they usually come in. He learns that some of the old pastries get sent to Fresh Start in the mornings, for the homeless. It’s his proudest moment when Jolene hands him a key and tells him to lock up for the evening.
With a sigh, Castiel pries one eye open. That thin shard of light is from a part in the curtain, and reveals enough to show that he’s in Dean’s motel room, alone. There are no sounds in the room or bathroom to lead him to believe that Dean is anywhere other than gone.
Castiel goes about his next day as usual, trying to ignore that not only is Dean in town, but that there’s something killing people. He’s human now, and useless. Why would Dean ask him to help?
“Yeah, but they won’t shoot at
After greetings and small talk with Eileen, she and Sam are out the door. Now it’s time for Dean’s plan. He’s made burgers, and all he has to do is herd Cas into the Dean Cave where he already has drinks and snacks ready to go. This time, he has Cas choose the movies from a pre-selected list.
and some refills after he sees Castiel get a package of the cheapest single-blade disposables available. “Trust me, these will last longer, and your face will be smoother.”
“We could tell you weren’t the typical transient wandering through town. A little socially inept, but smart enough to pick up how to work the espresso machine in what, two days? Off the internet? That’s something that is usually taught with a minimum two week course.” She stands up and goes to where Castiel stored the sandwich cookies, grabbing a couple. “Do you know how many people I actually let use this kitchen, let alone bake unsupervised?”
What? Sam stands there a little stunned. It’s Cas who speaks up next. “How extensive?”
“No,” replies Castiel, leaning back enough so he can look, his good hand raking through Dean’s wet hair. “Just unexpected.”
Nodding, Dean crams another mouthful of croissant. He actually takes the time to chew and get a sip of coffee this time. “You wanna maybe show me around, then?”
November 11, 2038
It’s only a moment before his face smoothes out again, and the doctor summons the both of them to her office. Doctor Cameron is petite, and Sam towers above her as they make their way into the room. As he folds himself into a chair, the exhaustion and nerves of the past couple of days catch up. He’s really glad Cas is here.
is still there, and even though Dean’s not as young as he used to be, he still has a sex drive. And he doesn’t have the guts to ask if that interests Cas at all. But then again, he didn’t think Cas felt human emotions either, yet here they are.
“Ahh.” So little time left. “I would like to use the shower, if you don’t mind.”
when Cas re-enters the room. On one hand, Cusack is a badass in
Dean turns towards the bed and prepares the covers, so Castiel moves to give him privacy, turning off the hall light as he passes the switch. It’s late, so Castiel checks the perimeter of the house, making sure the doors are locked, the salt lines are intact, and that the devil’s trap rugs are in place, then prepares for bed as well.
“YOU ARE DISGUSTING, DEAN!”
When Sam realized how badly Dean was injured, he panicked. Dean told him to stay, so he did at first. But then he remembered. After Jack went and fixed the world, Sam had re-packed their emergency kit with extra supplies, including some experimental spell bags from recipes he’d found in the deep archives, augmented with some of Rowena’s texts. He had no idea if they worked, but Dean was going to die anyway, so what was the worst that could happen?
This was a mistake. Every relationship screw-up Cusack's character made feels like a callout, now that he's paying attention to the way Cas interpreted the last movie. He can't even enjoy the record store shenanigans, because he keeps glancing at Cas, who is paying rapt attention and munching popcorn.
With a deep sigh Castiel capitulates, agreeing to go along with it. For now.
“There's something in my...Something in my back.”
They fall into a comfortable silence as the movie continues, Dean having stopped quoting so proliferately the more he drinks. Castiel feels himself grow more languid, and by the end of the movie, he’s slumped against the headboard, eyes drooping. Dean gives him a liquid smile, and takes the now empty glass from his hand. “Yeah, you’ve had enough for now.”
Castiel is sitting fully upright now, facing Dean, a small bit of that old righteous fury burning through him even while the world tilts on its axis. “But I can’t help the things I
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean."
The next day, while chewing on a piece of toast at the drop-in center, Castiel thinks about checking out the job resources available. On the way to the library, he passes by the cafe and notices Bernie taping a help wanted sign to the door, looking for a barista. Once at the library, Castiel uses one of the computers to research baristas. There are a surprising number of how-to videos available. He watches them all.
After waiting an hour, he finally puts in a ticket for lost luggage at the counter, and summons an uber. Once he’s settled in some sedan which smells like antiseptic, Dean leans his head back and lets out a breath. Tomorrow’s his first day, and all he has is the clothes he’s wearing, and what’s in his carry-on, which isn’t much but a spare change of clothes, and a tie. He’s screwed.
As soon as the nurse is out of the room again, Sam rushes to try to explain the situation. Honestly, if it weren’t for Jody, they’d both be a little screwed right now. He falls silent, waiting on some response from Dean, but then Dr. Cameron comes in. It will have to wait. She chases both Sam and Cas out into the hall for her examination.
“Why? Why ignore it? Didn’t... didn’t you say you want me too? Did you not as a human?” The questions tumble out of him. He’s terrified of the answer, but he can’t just ignore it.
“Why are you making this difficult?” Dean stops the car as he speaks. Cas gets the feeling that they don’t need to be worried about being in anyone’s way out here.
of the percolator as she makes coffee. The radio has just changed to a song she’s sure she knows, but can’t remember the name of in her exhausted state, when Bobby enters the room. He grunts at her, and she can only nod back at him.
. And isn't that something, Dean contemplates as he hotwires the same car, the knowledge that Bobby is only a phone call and a mere 9 hours drive away, in his wonderfully unburnt home. He pretends the water dripping down his face is only sweat from the oppressive Illinois sun, and carefully shoves all thoughts about anything except getting to Sioux Falls to the back of his mind before driving away from the destroyed field and windowless gas station shop.
Deanna gathers herself, then thrusts her cell phone into the angel’s hand. “Mind taking a picture? I wanna see.”
“He always like that?”
Sleep doesn’t come easily that night.
“Why would I be resurrected after Lucifer killed me?” Castiel volleys back.
They go through the whole Wedge-Antilles-and-proximity-to-grave-site song and dance again, and then head to the Astoria Motel. The whole way there, Dean wars with himself over what to do with the whole Ruby situation. He doesn't want to get Sam's hackles raised this early, but the sooner his brother gets away from that demon bitch and off her blood the sooner they can deal with… well, everything. Heaven and Hell and Lilith and Alastair and Lucifer and Michael and the damn
world
“Uh, well. Enlighten me?”
Deanna sits up, scrubbing a hand across her face. “Why?”
Castiel doesn’t bother turning around when he hears the
Dean swallows, for the first time really acknowledging how difficult it’ll be to get Cas the hell outta dodge when the goon in charge seems to hate his guts. Luckily for all involved, he’s blessed with a true lightbulb moment, and says, “wait,” to the thing wearing Meg’s face. It arches an eyebrow, tapping its foot impatiently. He grasps the slip of paper Jack gave him and hands it over to the Entity with relish.
Castiel doesn’t reply, still standing just in front of the door, and damn it, why can’t she handle this like an adult?
“Not particularly,” Balthazar mutters, angel blade dropping into his hand. Castiel and Rachel follow suit; Deanna tightens her grip on Ruby’s knife in her left hand, and flicks the safety off of her gun in her right.
she thinks to herself,
he placates himself.
“Yeah, yeah. Wanna hear what I found, or not?”
Clearly, he and Dean—and Sam and Bobby, when they were told—have a momentous task ahead of them. The very fate of the world rested in their hands. Castiel only hoped the four of them were strong enough to withstand the brunt of all that would test them in the weeks to come.
“Cas!” Dean couldn’t have stopped himself from shouting his joy and relief if he wanted to.
we were gonna kill him. Called me the ultimate killer and everything. Trying to goad us, maybe? Whatever. At that point, I’d made up my mind. See, I’d recently been told by—by someone very important to me, that that’s
He coughs. Cas is still gazing at him thoughtfully.
Question: What is the opposite of faith?
Castiel is loath to leave Dean in this strange new-old world alone, but Dean firmly tells him to get lost.
“Me?! I didn't kill anyone! Look at how they died!”
“Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Sorry,” Sam says apologetically, and both he and Ruby go to put on more clothes. Bobby raises an eyebrow at Dean, who shrugs.
“The pizza…” Ruby says slowly, “that apparently takes two guys to deliver?”
The four of them begin walking towards Ramiel’s home, and Deanna can’t help but think,
“Back?”
think you could trump me?”
She half listens to the conversation, most of Bobby’s side being noises of acknowledgement, until he loudly says, “He what now?”
Deanna eyes it. “Nice place.”
“What are you trying to—”
“Dean, we could use Sam on this,” Bobby counters.
“So.” Meg’s hands clap together gleefully. “Let’s begin.”
“And everyone is clear on the plan?” The two nod again.
Castiel, still invisible, arrives at Singer Salvage Yard. More specifically, he lands in Bobby’s kitchen. To his surprise, the Winchesters and Bobby Singer are sitting at the table, exhaustedly eating a meal despite the clear signs of some kind of struggle having taken place recently.
Bobby has just made the four of them stand for the customary “we’re probably all going to be dead tomorrow” photo, and is pouring out whisky for them when Deanna wanders outside, needing to clear her head for a bit.
Sam nods. “We follow the trail the demons left, find them. Someone's gotta know something about something.” Their waiter appears with two plates of pie, and as he pulls up a chair and sits at their table, Dean instantly recognizes this for what it is. Sam, none the wiser, asks, “You need something?”
“You got what you want, now send me back,” the demon pleads. Bobby grabs a can of lighter fluid  from the work table and pours it over the bones. “No!” she says, as Bobby continues pouring the liquid into the barrel. “We had a deal!”
“A soldier of Raphael.”
“Well!” she claps her hands together briefly, before striding towards the door. “You go block angel ears from the rest of the house, and then we’ll all hit the books together. Maybe we missed something last time.”
“Now, you’re not gonna like this next bit, but I promise it worked out.” Dean takes a deep breath. “Me and Sam, we figure Michael’s gonna side with Chuck now that Lucifer is gone again. Try to get back on Daddy’s good side. So we lie to him about being able to read Chuck’s book, that Sam is gonna try to translate it—surprised he bought it, honestly—but Jack and I distract him by convincing him to help us look through the lore.
I think we deserve
Unfortunately, by this point, Castiel has clearly heard enough of Dean’s attempts at bravado and obfuscation over the years and doesn’t even deign to comment. Instead, he continues to look at Dean, face soft and eyes gentle.
Deanna thinks,
Forget drinking demon blood; this is his little brother's most grievous offense. Dean wipes his own blood off his face.
Sam is standing on the front porch, sheepishly running a hand through his hair.
“I’m not coming with you.”
“So, uh. Well. I know you can’t talk back, but—” Dean has another lightbulb moment. Score. “Wait! Squeeze once for yes, twice for no. Capisce?” One squeeze. Dean allows a moment of smugness for doing literally the bare minimum to find a loophole in the Entity’s rules before continuing with his original plan: updates.
Dean’s mouth opens, about to challenge that as the one who actually
“His name—did he give you a name?” Castiel asks, gaze unwavering from the kid’s face.
Anger sparks within her, so she takes a breath before she can spew more spiteful bullshit. “Yeah, well, you’re not alone, okay? I’m glad you came to me. You dragged my sorry ass out of Hell; it’s time I return the favor.”
Let us crash,
“Aside from the church bells ringing in my head?” Dean asks, recognizing the painful irony of his phrasing. “Peachy.” He pulls out his phone and calls Sam.
“Um.”
“Plus, it served a purpose: Jack was able to absorb all the cosmic energy getting tossed around, so he got stronger. It looked like Lucifer was winning—almost did—but then wham! As he’s leaving and giving this asshole speech, trying to convince Jack to join the dark side or whatever, Michael appears behind Lucifer and stabs him when he turns around.” Dean smirks. “And again, an archangel dying releases a lot of energy, if you catch my drift.” One squeeze.
“Trade?” Deanna questions.
“You mean the Apocalypse we just stopped?” Bobby asks. Castiel nods. “Balls,” the hunter sighs, adjusting his cap.
A polite cough from behind Cas has Deanna craning her neck to see behind his shoulder.
“They both had it coming. Me, too. I'll be the next to go, and then it'll be over. And God will be satisfied.”
“Agents Green and McVie, FBI,” Deanna responds. “We're here to ask you a few follow-up questions about your partner's death.”
“Sam.”
That’s—that’s Cas. Dean picks up the pace, two figures becoming clearer the faster he runs towards them.
“Eh, not so much.”
She raises an eyebrow. “Care to share what’s goin’ on in that head of yours, Cas?”
Dean stares at him. Cas stares back. Dean prematurely folds, eyes darting back to the crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich in front of him. It’s never a good idea to start a staring contest with an angel. The bastards always win.
“The test! You’ll love it,” the Entity promises.
“That we coulda gotten to people quicker,” Dean confesses. “A few hunters died today.”
Deanna snorts. “Yeah, right. You’re Team Gabriel.”
Ed rights the bottle, as Castiel again asks, “Who is Christopher Birch?”
Raphael had begun approaching her at that, eyes narrowed in a mixture of disgust and befuddled amusement, regarding her like one would regard a bug before stepping on it.
She’s sure she’d drawn the devil’s trap correctly; she could do that with her eyes closed. The circle of holy fire had only bought them thirty seconds before the demon had extinguished it with the spear he’d pulled out of his back.
Dean rests his head on the kitchen table, letting the cool surface lull him into a doze. He’s awakened by the quiet
“Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife,” Dean lists. “I mean, we're pretty much set to take care of anything I've ever heard of.”
Raphael doesn’t keep them waiting long. They’re outnumbered by a good margin, and Deanna grips her angel blade tighter.
Deanna feels frozen, but forces out the first question that comes to mind: “Didn’t we trap that son of a bitch in a ring of holy fire? How’s he even… y’know, flying around, making this mess?”
“Hey,” she says, and shuts the door behind her, leaning back against it. She drinks in the sight of Cas, as close to relaxed as she’s ever seen him, in her bed, alive and staying that way for the foreseeable future.
Agents Green and McVie from the FBI aka the Fleetwood Bureau of Investigation, because they don’t actually say the aliases used in 6.03 and I really love Fleetwood Mac.
Deanna blinks. “You saying you’re not gonna meet us at Bobby’s?”
“King of the Crossroads,” Bobby confirms, “I've heard the speech.”
“You know I couldn't dig up jack or squat on this thing. Why the hell didn't you tell him?” Bobby demands to know.
A hunter who Deanna had only met the day before, bleeding profusely and scrambling back on the ground before one of Raphael’s pant-suited soldiers had stabbed him through the heart.
“I want you to plant a garden, keep bees, do whatever makes you happy.” One squeeze. “I’m not sure I wanna keep hunting, so I gotta figure out what I
Said brother looks skeptical, and Dean remembers the last first time they were back in the Impala when he last first got back from Hell, remembers questioning Sam over Lilith and if he was using any of his
Dean shakes his head, which Sam incorrectly interprets as,
“I called the others, told ‘em what the plan is. ‘Course, things never go to plan, but maybe this time things’ll turn out right,” Bobby says. He doesn’t look very hopeful.
“How were the witnesses?”
Deanna smiles wider, and the slight one he’d had on his face grows. Hers does, too, until they’re both grinning at each other, slightly giddy.
Castiel glares at her. “That’s a foolish idea.”
Deanna waits outside the mansion, trying to breathe as quietly as possible. An angel, with his blade already in hand, walks by her hiding spot, and as she steps out from the shadows, she cockily greets him, “Hey, there.” The angel turns to face her, and she holds her own angelic weapon up so that it glints in the moonlight. “Yeah, I’ve got one of those, too.”
Deanna leans towards Castiel, saying, “Shouldn't it be bigger?” out of the corner of her mouth.
Dean splutters. “Where was that attitude when you’ve been tiptoeing around me this past month like I’m some kind of—of baby to be coddled?!” Dean thinks he hears Sam mutter something about how
