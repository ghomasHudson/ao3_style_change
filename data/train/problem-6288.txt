"They were experimenting with that drug," Peter said, grabbing his polar bear and stuffing him under his chin. He let out a hard shudder as memories from the Miami bunker flooded his mind, of him lying there, strapped to a freezing cold concrete slab as the Aminacin burned through his veins like molten lava, while he bit through his bottom lip to keep from screaming from the almost unbearable pain.
No. It was better to simply prevent the snap from occurring rather than try to reverse it. Even if doing so meant that some babies wouldn't be born or relationships wouldn't be formed, the tragedy of having potentially tens of thousands of people reappearing at thirty-plus thousand feet or over the open water because their planes and boats were no longer in the same place would be far, far worse.
It was like Steve could read Tony’s entire being just by looking into his gorgeous brown eyes.  And what he saw said that Tony loved his son more than anything in the world, and that he was no stranger to being hurt.
He ran his hand through his hair again, trying to force his exhausted mind to function. "Steve! JARVIS, you need to get Steve's aircraft up and running again, he needs to reenter the atmosphere as soon as possible, and—"
"Yeah, yeah, I already know all of this," Steve muttered. He continued scrolling down, searching for a list of the projects that Howard's division had worked on.
Peter’s head snapped back in surprise, his expression a mixture of such shock and hurt that Tony felt his heart crack.
"I know, Dad," Peter said, rather impatiently. He had just thought of something, a solution to one of the programming roadblocks he'd come up against, and he wanted to get it written down before his nurse came in to check on him again.
"But—!" Gwen's lower lip shook as she wrapped her arms around Peter's computer, as if it were Peter himself. "I just want to help. Peter, he just hasn't been the same since they took his papa away, and—"
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered. He turned his head just enough to cup Steve's cheek. "It's okay, I'm here. I love you, and I'm always gonna be here."
"Daddy," Peter whimpered, his hands clamped around his ears like his head was about to explode. "Daddy, why're they all screaming at us? It's too loud, why do they have to be so loud?"
First it had been Riley's death, which happened so quickly that it was as though Steve had blinked and suddenly Riley was nothing more than an airborne fireball, and one so close that Steve had actually
"I do not mind at all, Captain," T'Challa said graciously as the four warriors surrounding him all backed off three paces. "What can I do for you?"
His shoulders sagging, Steve opened his arms, his heart fluttering when Peter stepped right into them. For all of his proclamations that he wasn't a little kid anymore, both Steve and Tony were still relieved that he never shied away from a hug. Even out in public, where his friends could see.
Tony cried as he suddenly came so hard that he nearly blacked out, clutching Steve's shoulders as he rode out the overwhelming onslaught of sensation. Then he pitched forward, practically melting against Steve's broad chest as the post-coital warm fuzzies overtook him, pulling him down into their drowsy depths. He only vaguely noticed as Steve shifted them so they were lying down, tugging the throw blanket over them as he kissed the top of Tony's head.
"Hey," he said, the smile dropping from his face as his eyes swept across Tony. "Tony? Is something wrong?"
Which meant that no matter what the outcome of the battle, the team would be stuck there, in their new present.
With less than three minutes left until curfew Tony pulled into his spot at the base, managing to make it to his office just as the lights cut out. His hands were shaking as he unlocked the door and stumbled towards his chair, fighting to keep back the tears threatening to fall.
Tony said on a gasp as Steve's right hand slid down to his pelvis, pressing him even closer, so close that Tony could feel the thud of Steve's heart against his back. Steve had looked so exhausted on the flight home that Tony had had half a mind to insist that they just take a nap after they got cleaned up, but it was now very obvious that Steve had other things on his mind besides sleep.
"Oh. Well, I s'pose that's a good thing," said Ned as they arrived at the front door. "So, do you think we're supposed to ring the doorbell, or just go inside?"
For a moment, Shostakov stares at Steve, his lips twitching like he’s trying to figure out how to respond.  Then he laughs, clapping Steve so hard on his left shoulder that he has to bite down on his tongue to keep from crying out.
"Don't mention it, hon," Tony said as he skidded to a stop above Steve's head. He attempted to repulse the alien away, swearing when the thing deflected the repulsor beam off to the side with a simple flick of his wrist. "Goddamnit! Where's a spaceship when you need one, hmm?"
"All right, all right," Steve said, holding up his hand. He cleared his throat again, his eyes sweeping around his teammates all gathered in a circle and ending on Tony, who gave him a single nod.
And not that they had discussed Sam and Bucky's sex life in great detail, but Sam had also mentioned to Steve a few times during their runs that sometimes when Bucky was going through a rough patch mentally, he just wasn't interested. And that even with all of his knowledge and training, Sam still had to remind himself not to take it personally.
And while Steve felt kinda bad that he had chased Sam away, he still couldn't bring himself to slow down. Running had always helped to clear Steve's head, and at the moment he could use all the help he could get. Especially since the phone call he had made to his ma after leaving Phillips's office had only managed to muddy the waters even more.
"Is there no chance of one of us getting in to see Toomes?" asked Sam. "I mean, the Avengers' name still has to carry some weight with the feds, maybe it's worth a shot?"
Tony had told Steve numerous times that he'd never had any intentions of becoming a father, and especially not after having his heart broken by Peter's mother, an undercover SHIELD agent sent by Nick Fury to evaluate Tony. Steve had heard the story of the night Peter was born many times, mostly at his request. Since he didn't get to meet Peter until he was already eleven years old, Steve loved hearing stories about when Peter was a baby and younger child, and especially about how much Tony had adored him from day one. From the moment Tony laid eyes on Peter as a tiny baby, he was hooked. Born prematurely and suffering from underdeveloped lungs, Peter spent several weeks in the hospital after he was born, during which Tony didn't leave his side for longer than a few minutes, a protectiveness that hadn't waned at all in the sixteen years since. Tony was so head over heels for his sweet boy that Steve had no doubt that he would move heaven and Earth in order to keep him safe.
to get Uncle Bucky's new arm finished. With how fast he was deteriorating and with Papa leaving on his mission in only a few days, Peter didn't figure that he'd still be around by the time Dad was actually able to build it, and he didn't want Dad to have any unanswerable questions about its design.
"No, thanks," Carol said from across the table, her own glass clutched in her hand. "I think we're good."
"That was a long time ago, and things were very different back then," Papa stated. He held out his arms, glancing around the busy café. "Things were a lot slower and simpler, and there weren't as many threats out there as there are now." He paused, poking his straw at the ice cream in his float. "Threats we still can't seem to shake no matter how hard we try, so… I'm sorry, Peter, but until you're a legal adult, you're just going to have to live with the rules that Dad and I set. And if those rules seem to be a bit overbearing… well… then I'm afraid that's just how it's going to be."
“Really?” Tony asked.  “For real?  What was he like?  I’ve got all the comics, books, couple of action figures, the—the ah, the radio program,” he said, casting a furtive glance at Steve, who was watching him with an indecipherable expression.
Breakfast, which probably should have been awkward, at least in Tony’s morning after experiences, ended up being surprisingly easy, even though Steve traded the towel for the robe that matched Tony’s, which was unfortunate, in Tony’s opinion.  Steve read the paper that had been delivered along with coffee, pastries, fruit and two plates of eggs and bacon, and Tony checked his emails, while the conversation flowed from how bad the Dodgers were this year (“They never should have left Brooklyn”—Steve Rogers, at least three times) to a photo of the two of them accompanying an article on the gala (“I see I’m ‘And Husband’ now” “Pass me the bagels, would you, And?”) to a news report on the Air Force assuring the public that any resemblance the contrails their pilots left in the sky bore to a part of male anatomy was purely coincidental (“It definitely
“I don't need time to think about it, Tony. I've had ten years to realize that you were right. Not how I wanted to hear it said, I'll admit, but you had the right of it. Even if you don't think you were right now. This is—you're just—you're caught up in something that isn't real, Tony. It never was. You were right., what you said. Maybe for the wrong reasons, but you were right. You usually are,” Steve said as he bent over to shove textbooks and folders into his backpack.
By evening, the extra supplies had arrived, and they spent a pleasant hour or so in the kitchen preparing the items for their meal. Steve got the coq au vin heating in one fondue pot and grated cheeses melting in the other, while Tony chopped up slices of potato, and soon enough they were laughing over Steve’s mistaken assumption about the implications of the dish. Tony initially tried to demur, but finally let Steve feed him, small bites of meat cooked in the boiling broth and breads that were coated in melted cheese. It was a different kind of taking care of Tony than this morning, but it felt good nonetheless, and Tony couldn’t seem to stop smiling a bright, pleased smile each time Steve offered him food, so he counted dinner as a success.
Bright lights hummed overhead, and shoppers veered around Steve, giving him a wide berth, though Steve suspected the haggard parents feeding snacks to children strapped carefully into the carts like birds delivering dinner to their young or the myriad people with their faces glued to their phones were barely aware of what they were doing. There were easily thirty types of soap lining the grocery store shelves.  More, if you counted what were called body washes, according to the brightly colored labels that promised some version of floral, tropical or vanilla scents. The future was sometimes a cacophony of choices, Steve thought.
“I think I can swing this memory loss thing in our favor,” Steve replied evenly.  “I’m told it’s very sympathetic,” he deadpanned.
“Friday, get us a lukewarm bath going, would you? Not too deep,” Tony requested.  He kicked his shoes off and nudged them to the side of the elevator before it opened to his suite.  He dropped the bags in the bathroom next to the tub and unwound the shirt from Steve’s body, tossing it to the side to be burned, probably.  It was wet with something beyond pasta sauce, as was the front of Tony’s pants leg.  Fan-fucking-tastic, Tony thought, shooting a disgruntled look at Steve.
“It’s not a formality, Buck, it’s important. This is—this is it. Come on, you—” Steve broke off, running a hand through his hair.  “You know how important this is. We’re running out of chances.”
He wasn’t sure if it was comforting that human greed remained a constant this past seventy years or not.
“You tell me,” Coulson responded, watching Tony with that same mild, probing gaze.  “SHIELD’s gym equipment budget can only stretch so far,” Coulson added, which seemed like a completely random segue.
He felt the warm heat of Tony’s lips against his skin and then, one of Tony’s hands dropped from his chest, and the blunt pressure of Tony’s finger against his hole replaced it. His nipple was on fire. Flames of heat seemed to rise in his gut, behind his throbbing cock. Tony’s hair brushed lightly against his shoulder and cheek, and he felt a shiver work its way through Tony’s frame as he pushed his finger in, breaching Steve’s hole.
“You kinda stepped on it. Sir,” Dominic said.  “I think I got it back together, though. I put it in your trunk.”
“Yeah, how?” Brock demanded with a derisive snort.  “How am I supposed to do that, Steve?  I can’t just make money appear, and apparently, I can’t win it, either. This trip was a fucking disaster. I have a grand total of one investor so far, and I’m sleeping with him.”
“He is gone. What does it matter the how of it?” Cam asked with a shrug. “I liked her. Ms. Potts.  She was nice. She gave me a jar of honeyed figs and said I could get more from the kitchens anytime I liked,” Cam added.
“I—thank you,” Steve said, feeling his cheeks heat at the compliment.  He ducked his head, but squeezed Tony’s hand for a moment before releasing it.  “Master Len, he is a good teacher.”
“Exactly,” Tony agreed, taking another drink. “Pepper's running interference for me—which, thanks for getting the mea culpas, by the way. Though, fair warning, Pepper and Nat hit it off, so you might want to, I don't know, change your name, buy supplies, move to Montana. Just a suggestion.”
“Home, sweet home,” Barnes added, scrutinizing Tony with a narrow-eyed look.  “Maids had the week off, so…”
“Uh-huh,” he heard Tony reply.  “Well, remind me never to piss off your friend, then,” Tony said jauntily, standing up from the table.   Steve stood, too, and started clearing off the table.
“Where the hell’s Jarvis?  Did you run off again?  Huh?” Howard muttered, tugging a bit at his tie and checking his reflection again while Tony ducked his head until the hair fell over his eyes.  “Dammit, Tony, what has your mother told you about pulling crap like that?”
been going well, damn it all to hell.  It was like he couldn’t just have enough with Steve.  He always had to try for more, push at whatever boundary there was between them just to see if he could get that line in the sand to move a bit further.  Tony could only imagine the thoughts that must be running through Steve’s head.  This was all so very, very fucked up.  Granted, a large part of why was Tony’s fault, but if there was ever any proof needed of why he’d made the right call not just outing their past relationship from the get go, here it was.  This Steve, the one just out of the ice, wasn’t ready to deal with this, not even close, though it was, admittedly, hard to convince himself he’d done any of it for Steve.
“Then, what…” Steve began, voice trailing off as he frowned, still trying to shake the image of Tony spread eagled on the bed loose from his mind.  “But you enjoyed it. What she did to you? At least in the beginning. You—you liked that?” Steve asked, his mind a swirl of curiosity, repulsion and arousal.  He wasn’t sure what to think. Tony had said things, sure, but Steve hadn’t really put much stock into any of it, other than that Tony enjoyed a breadth of experience that was somewhat daunting.
“Something like that,” Steve agreed with a lopsided smile.  It wasn’t actually that far from the truth.
Then he realized he hadn’t seen Tony in a suit since that first night, when he’d been so nervous he’d barely been able to string words together, let alone appreciate anything about how Tony looked. There was a strange, fleeting expression of almost fondness that floated across Tony’s face, lost before it ever actually settled there, and Steve wondered, not for the first time, how Tony remembered that first night, when he’d brought Steve home and asked for only what Steve chose to give.
Tony tugged Steve along into the house and kicked open the door of the bedroom, dropping the suitcase as soon as they were inside. Steve leaned back against the closed door, eyes closed, breathing through his nose with no small amount of effort. There was a light sheen of perspiration on his skin, making it glow, and his cheeks were high with color.
The stranger came. Steve could feel it happening around him. The clench of the man’s inner walls, the sudden shudders, the sharp, tight movements, then the transformation to a languid bonelessness. The man’s stuttering cries quickly became muffled moans from behind the wall. But it still, it just—it wasn’t right, it wasn’t—
He wondered about it.  He wondered about it a lot.  It was becoming something of a distraction.  If by distraction, you meant the way Jack Torrance was mildly interested in his winter caretaking duties at the Overlook.
“That is a gross misinterpretation of the sequence of events,” Tony said slowly, his brow drawing together in a frown as he thought back.  It was…wasn’t it?
.  Something moved inside of it, a round, hard bulge that stretched the skin until it was glassy, and another something behind that.  A whole row of somethings was inside the alien’s cock, Tony realized with a start, like large beads or...he stopped, his mind going blank for a moment at what his eyes were seeing.
“Sure is great of you to do this for the team, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, looking around the gym.  “Sorry--Tony,” he corrected quickly.  Tony closed his eyes and sighed.  The fucking niceness of it all was going to be his undoing.  Hey, Tony, why did you smash up your gym?  Well, see, Bruce, Steve was being nice to me, and I couldn’t take it anymore.
“Which is why I’m always careful,” Bruce said. Tony pursed his lips, then huffed out an acknowledging chuckle.
He felt the brush of Tony’s coat against his side, then Tony’s hand closed over his where Steve’s damaged fingers dug into the pockmarked wall, the rough pads of Tony’s palm brushing over the open skin on Steve’s knuckles with a stinging burn that wound its way down through his stomach to his cock.  He twisted his head to look. The ring Tony had given him stared back at him like an eye, brilliant and blue. Dark flecks of dried blood peeked out from between their fingers. He remembered being ten and slicing his palm to baptize a promise to Bucky that he hadn’t been able to keep, and had the disconcerting feeling that he was doing the same, but then Tony’s hand pressed his into the wall and his other hand, slick and warm with oil now, pushed Steve’s ass apart and found his hole, and Steve didn’t think about anything anymore, the sensations driving everything else away.
Happy had the limo waiting under the portico by the valet stand.  He was standing next to the rear door, and swept it open as Steve and Tony approached, plucking their bags from their hands and stowing them in the trunk before Steve could protest.
“Of course, Captain,” JARVIS replied.  “Someone must have reported the disturbance because it appears that there are already units on the way.”
The lump in his throat wasn’t from happiness, though.  It was jealousy and resentment and the nearly overwhelming desire to rail at a deity he didn’t believe in and demand to know why.  Why did they get that, and he and Steve didn’t?  Howard and his machinations, sure, and Tony could admit that he might have dug his own karmic grave, but Steve…Steve was good.  Really and truly
“Steve was still arguing with the manager because you told him you had a reservation for your birthday, and come hell or high water, by God, his boyfriend was going to eat there,” Rhodey reminded him.  “I can’t believe they brought you a cake.”
He should’ve just left the balcony as soon as that guy showed up.  He’d known.  Damn it. That was the thing.  He’d
“I’m fine,” Steve countered through gritted teeth.  He had to resist the urge to shift in his seat, use his bulk, throw her off this nonsense.  He could do it.  A sharp word.  The right tone.  It would stop.
“They laughed. I remember that,” Tony said in a flat, dull voice.  He watched Steve, sitting there on the hard stone by the fire, eschewing the plush, cushioned chair that Obie had favored.  Steve still wore the leather leggings and boots he favored and a bracer that slung over one shoulder and buckled under his arm and sometimes held a shield to his back, but nothing else.  Bare-chested, face streaked with paint and sweat and flecks of blood that probably wasn’t his own, he looked every bit the conquering warlord Obie had warned Tony about two nights ago when he informed Tony about his plan.  Tony, in exchange for the safety of his people.
“Ah, Tony.  Always joking.  That’s what I like about you!” Hammer replied, patting Tony lightly on the shoulder as he brushed past and sauntered over to the poker table.
“No, I—I know that.  You wouldn’t hurt me,” Tony said, realizing that he actually believed it.  How long had it been since Steve had promised him that?  Long enough for it to become truth, Tony supposed.  “I mean, sometimes you get all sort of, like, closed off or something.  You paint those swirly dark things that make me wish you were painting clowns.”
“You know they want to pin something on the Ayatollah, Peggy, whether it’s this or something else,” Stane shrugged, glancing at Steve before dropping his gaze back to Peggy.  “Good for business, I suppose,” he grinned. It was full of teeth. Steve wanted to hit him hard enough to knock them out of his mouth. “Just going to,” Stane said, holding up the cigar with a slightly apologetic look.
He didn’t want to become like that man who Zola brought here for the demonstration.  He didn’t want to be
I want you, Tony thought, a sharp pang bursting bright in the center of his chest.  He had to resist the urge to tap at the reactor, his own little Morse code of a nervous tell.
It was always the little things, Tony thought, as he looked desperately at the man across from him, but one of the investigators was eyeing him, so there really wasn’t much the man could do. The answer, Tony assumed, was probably not Hot Thong Guy. More’s the pity.
Tony. It was perfect, Steve thought.  Beautiful and perfect and given to him to say.  A shibboleth, Steve thought. The good kind. I didn’t know those existed.
Tony gave a quick, jerky nod, then released his hand from Steve’s jaw and placed it back on the mirror in front of him, eyes locked now on his own reflection in the glass.  Steve pressed his mouth again to the line of bone that jutted against Tony’s hip tracing it over the curve, then going up on his knees to kiss a path along Tony’s lower back, hands coming up to cup the globes of Tony’s ass, massaging the supple skin.
But people, even people who loved him, didn’t want to touch old, bruised skin that was pulled too tightly over brittle bones. They didn’t like the smell, a bit like dead leaves, that told them something was rotting underneath it all, and that something was him. He understood.  It was natural, most likely, to fear seeing what waited for us all.  He had done it, too, when he was younger and his mother insisted they go sit with her father when he lay sick.  It had scared Steve, then, this frail old man who couldn’t hold his own bowels anymore, the life leaking out of him while they all watched, and he hid, he remembered, out in one of the fields, so that he wouldn’t have to be in the room when his grandfather took his final, rattling breath.  People shied away from him now, just like that, probably not on purpose, but shy away, they did. They saw it, this shadow that hovered over him.
“Of course I hacked his phone.  You think I’m going to bring this guy into all this and not find out if he’s got a bookie or crazy ex or, God forbid, one of those Farmville things where he’s going to send me messages about his fake crops?  I think we all agree, everyone has a dealbreaker, and updates about your pretend corn—come on,” Tony said.  “I had JARVIS take a download of all the data—search history, phone records, messages, all that.”
“Obie,” Maria said.  Even through the years, Steve could hear the cautionary note that tinged her voice, though Stane seemed to miss it entirely.  Or, more likely, just ignored it.
“Honey,” Steve breathed out, eyes bright with amusement and a spark of something that might be challenge. “I missed you so much.”
“I was going to cry.  Manly tears, but I felt it building,” Rhodey said.  “In here,” he added, tapping at his chest.
“Ugh, you two,” Barnes said, shaking his head and making a retching face. He got up and pulled out his phone, then walked out into the hallway, presumably to impart the good news to Wilson.
They had been Bonded long enough that Tony could decipher anything from the smallest furrow of a frown that sometimes creased Steve’s forehead when he was frustrated by some gap in his knowledge—of Tony, sometimes, though, mostly, these days, the host of other what’s the world coming to moments Steve had to navigate--to the way Steve’s hands on his hips meant making a decision.  Steve’s quirks had long since become familiar. Comforting, for the most part, though there were times Tony could see the tension building in the set of Steve’s jaw and shoulders and knew it meant waking up to an empty place next to him in bed and Steve on the sofa with some infomercial playing in the background, unseen and unheard.
“Who are these people who are going to say these things about you?” Steve asked, voice low, but Tony knew that tone well enough.
Steve was pressing closer now, humming lowly.  Tony could feel the heat of him, the warm, wet skin of his thighs against Tony’s backside, the hard jut of his cock sliding between their bodies.  It was more sensual than just about anything Tony had ever experienced. Not just the physical sensations, but the intimacy of it, the act of being cared for, the way it felt to surrender to Steve’s touch and trust him with this.  Tony’s eyes dropped closed and he tilted his head back against the pressure of Steve’s hands. A low, rough moan escaped his lips as Steve’s deft hands worked over his neck, his shoulders, his scalp, even rubbing Tony’s earlobes between his fingers.  It was heaven. He could feel his whole body relax, like his bones and muscles were melting into the water. Everything faded away except for the feel of Steve’s hands.
Steve leaned forward and peered out the side of the carriage, looking for Tony, who rode up next to the carriage and dismounted once the Castle gates closed, while the guards and others followed suit, as stable boys hurried to assist with the horses.  Tony waved the driver away and opened the door himself, holding out a hand for Cam, then Steve, to climb down.
“Do you?” Rhodes asked sharply.  “Really? Your Free States are how old?  Not yet a full generation behind you, and how well did you fare when Schmidt’s armies attacked, and all you had was a bunch of farmers?  No standing army, no navy, no stores,
“Here,” Tony said, nodding towards one of the boulders that protruded out from the grass forming a nearly flat shelf of rock, smoothed by ancient waters. Steve walked over to it, feet scraping through the sandy bottom of the pool, sending silvery minnows darting everywhere, looking for the choicest bits stirred by the movement.  Steve leaned against the warm rock, as Tony followed him, running the piece of soap up and down Steve’s arms, then gently up and down his back, over and over, until it was the stroke of Tony’s hand that Steve felt against the skin there.  Steve dipped under the water again, then reached out a hand to Tony, palm up.
“You gotta let me catch you sometimes, too, Tony,” Steve said quietly.  “You were ready to give up on your dream project just because you thought it might hurt me.  I want you to do this, Tony.  If we’re wrong, or if the situation goes South on us, well…we’ll deal with it.  Together this time, okay?”
a hero, let alone thinking of him—well, Captain America—as one.  He always treated Steve with something approaching mild disdain, or so it seemed to Steve.  There was a distance there, that was true, he thought, but looking back, he wondered at it.  The man sitting across from him was open, honest, funny without being unkind, cared about whether his random blind date was uncomfortable and apparently concerned enough about his ex to agree to meet up with some stranger in a Brooklyn no-star to appease her. Not exactly how Steve would have described Stark thirty minutes ago had someone asked him.
“Should I sing?” she asked with a breathy sigh, like the conversation was already exhausting.  “You’re probably too old for that now, aren’t you?”
,” Brock said, standing up and facing a bewildered Steve.  “Go see if you could get a little on the side, is that it?” he sneered.  “Mitch give you some ideas, hmmm?  Well?  Did you?”
Ms. Romanov’s admonition flashed through Steve’s mind at Tony’s words. They don’t want to know, not really.  Don’t confuse polite interest with the client actually wanting to hear about the problems or dreams they’re exploiting.
.  Keep it together, Tony admonished himself harshly.  Granted, at this point, he wouldn’t trust them within ten miles of Steve, but there could be something out there.  Some contingency plan.  Something.
“I have this idea,” Steve repeated as Tony came over to stand next to him.  In front of Steve, there was a stack of parts maybe ten inches high, a Jenga-like structure that looked as though it was about to keel over with a stray breath.
He didn’t have many paints left.  They were too expensive and took up too much space.  Brock didn’t like the smell, either.  The few canvases Steve had painted over the past six months were tucked in a corner in the closet to maybe send to Bucky’s parents or Laura one day since what Steve painted wasn’t really Brock’s thing.  He did have some colored pencils and a sketchbook stashed in his bedside table, though, so he took those out and sat by the window, sketching the view from the Skywalk from memory.
“Tony, have you told him how you feel?” Jarvis asked.  He was picking at non-existent lint on his coat sleeve and peering at Tony from under his eyebrows.  “That you would, ah…perhaps welcome a more…physical relationship?” Jarvis inquired with a slight catch in his throat around the words.
Steve heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath as he turned his head to the side, hot breath warming the silky skin of Tony’s cock that jutted up from the nest of dark, springy hair, full and reddened, a bead of moisture clinging to the head. He cast a quick look up at Tony’s face, satisfied to see the other man’s eyes had gone nearly black in the low light, his hands reflexively grasping then releasing the bed’s coverlet before one came up to circle the metal disc, then follow the path Steve’s mouth had taken a moment earlier.
"I guess," Peter said with a shrug. "I'm gonna take it that way, anyway." He gathered up his backpack, pulling his glasses out from one of the side pockets and slipping them on. It had been getting harder and harder for him to keep his vision focused as the practise wore on, and he was starting to get a headache.
Changing into his favourite Hulk pyjamas, Peter brushed his teeth and climbed under his covers, making a very poor attempt at a smile when Papa knocked on his slightly cracked door.
But Gwen only shook her head, gripping his hands. "Peter, I'm sure your dads already know exactly what to do, so—"
“Oh, now you’re interested in our ‘petty human linguistics’, are ya?” Tony grumbles.  “JARVIS, find me a way into this goddamn bunker!”
"Really?" Desire was already coursing through Steve's body at MACH-1, and he was cursing the fact that he still had to drive them home. "I'll—there's room in my footlocker, so you could store some of your clothes in there if you want. And I could bring you into the locker room with me to shower in the mornings, and—"
Steve's lower lip shook as he studied his hands, clad in their heavy blue casts. Captain America blue, even.
"Well, yeah, that is one of the main goals," Anthony answered. "The Air Corps isn't in the business of stranding its pilots out in space."
"That's 'cause you ripped out your IV, bud," Tony said, his heart rate finally returning to something resembling normal. He nodded at Bruce, who quickly fetched the first aid kit from Peter's bathroom and bandaged his torn-up arm before turning his attention to Steve's busted-up face.
"Yeah, it does. Fuck, baby, you're so good," Tony whispered, his stuttered breaths hot puffs of air against Steve's cheek. "I swear this ass of yours was sculpted by the gods."
"Yeah, I'm sure you would believe that, considering where you come from," Mr Stacy said. "But I'll also tell you that our police have orders to arrest this so-called Spider-Man on sight if he ever dares to show his mask again in public, and if I had my way, that would extend to anyone else who wants to try something stupid like that. No one should be operating above the law. No one."
go on the record and say that if anything happens to you, that it will not only destroy me, but Pete as well, so you'd better make damn sure that it doesn't. You got that?"
And in the twelve years since, Tony’s commitment to his son hadn't wavered in the slightest.  Instead of hiring a nanny, Tony chose to care for Peter all by himself, through the seemingly endless days and sleepless nights of the first few weeks of his life, working from home unless absolutely necessary.  Once Peter was a few months old—and sleeping just a tiny bit better—Tony started bringing him to work during the day, setting up a baby-proofed area in his office, and even conducting the occasional meeting while Peter slept on his chest or back.  After Peter was old enough to start school, Tony made sure to keep his calendar completely clear during dropoff and pickup times, and for any events Peter participated in.
"Your thoughts aren't as quiet as you think, babe," Tony said once they broke for air, still pressing soft kisses along Steve's jawline as his fingertips trailed across Steve's chest, brushing lightly across both his nipples. He then tapped Steve on the shoulder, indicating for him to roll onto his back. "Let me make you feel good, yeah?"
are the most important thing to me in the entire world, and—and I just can’t—I’ve gotta be absolutely sure about what happens next, okay?  You're just gonna have to trust me on this!”
"I'm worried that you're gonna get sick, sweetheart," he finally murmured. "And with that thing embedded in your chest, I'm just—"
And after the serum, he could.  For the first time in his life, Steve could actually stand up to the bullies he had despised ever since he was a tiny, sickly lad, and not come out of each engagement half-dead.
Tony waited until they were safely inside the car before turning to his mischievous son.  “So, how long have you been planning that ambush, hmm?” he asked.  He should’ve known that Peter had been just waiting for the perfect time to pounce.
“You sleep good, bud, yeah?” Tony murmurs as he tucks Peter’s blankets up to his neck.  He’s so tired that his eyes are already closed, his beloved stuffed polar bear held tightly in his arms.
"Okay, so why don't we just pretend for a second that you're not beating yourself up about it, and just tell me what JARVIS found?"
He had already accepted what was coming, and a bit more mothering from his really nice nurse unfortunately wasn't going to prevent it.
Thanos paused, a smile stretching across his lips that was so full of irony and sarcasm that it made Peter's belly swoop.
Leave it to Peter to find the one old-fashioned soda fountain left in all of Midtown, complete with scoop-to-order ice cream cones and big band music playing in the background.
"Cap, I've got two heat signatures breaking through the treeline," said James as he flew by, followed directly by Sam. Outside the domed area, Steve could see orange flames and smoke rising up from the forest where a few of the projectiles had landed.
you are, 'cause then we'll end up just sitting here all night and Pete'll end up worrying about us, and—"
The guy shrugged. "Well, I dunno. Maybe 'cause they royally screwed something up the first time around?"
"Peter!" Gamora cried as she placed her left hand onto Tony's right shoulder, shaking her right hand in Quill's face. "Peter, take my hand! We must help them!"
"I know," Steve murmured, so low and thick that a knot rose in Tony's throat. "And I was trying—Tony, I was trying so
Having them be mobile enough to follow Peter around, though, was a whole other thing. In order to cover the school from the Tower the drones would basically have to be in a low geosynchronous orbit to avoid being a hazard to aircraft, which could potentially slow their reaction time, or Tony would have to get permission from the city to station more units around the school, something he was very reluctant to do because it would require him revealing their existence to Senator Davis, and he really didn't want to do that unless it became absolutely necessary.
“Mmm, fine,” grumbled Peter, sticking his bottom lip out.  “But you're gonna come back tomorrow night, right, Steve?  Then you can even stay even later since you don't open till noon on Sunday!”
"You're so beautiful," Steve whispered as he crawled up over Tony and gently removed his glasses, his lust-blown blue eyes sweeping across Tony's face and body. "Gods, Tony, I love you so much!"
“Obie?  What’s this got to do with Obie?” Dad demanded.  “Pete, Obie hates Hammer Industries!  He would never—”
"Peter?" Liz interrupted, one hand on her hip as she eyed him pointedly. "You might wanna pay attention here?"
And then, his left arm shaking with the effort of keeping it in place, Steve squeezes his arms against his head and locks his hands together.  The pain in his left shoulder ramps up to an almost unbearable level as Steve holds the position for three additional Brooklyns, but he forces himself to lower them slowly anyway, breathing out a long breath once they’re safely back in his lap.
"Ah, that'd be Phantom of the Opera, Uncle Thor," Peter piped up from somewhere off to Tony's left. "We can go once we get home, okay? And I'm pretty sure Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam wanna come too."
"I love you so much," Steve whispered, his lips trailing along the slightly puckered skin over Tony's repaired sternum as Tony's hands fisted into his hair. "You have such a big heart, mo grá, the biggest of any of us, and I'm so lucky that you let me inside. Ni féidir liom maireachtáil gan tú."
"Bruce!" Steve exclaimed as Bruce stumbled forward, practically collapsing into Steve's arms. "What—what're you doing here? Where's Thor? And—and Loki? And the ship?"
Unfortunately, Steve highly doubted that the general would dare to do so again, which likely meant that he'd just painted a target not only on his own back, but on Tony and Peter's as well.
But even as he said it, he knew it was too late. Tony was already skidding to a stop in front of Thanos, already reaching his armoured hands towards the gauntlet, as if he were trying to pull it off Thanos' arm. With a furious growl, Thanos yanked the gauntlet away, backhanding Tony into a big pile of debris several metres away. Steve's panicked cry of alarm caught in his throat as Thanos sneered in triumph before raising his left arm, preparing to snap his fingers.
"Someone obviously messed with the program somehow," he said once his monitor had stopped its annoying beeping. "But it can't have been very recently because then my encryptions would've caught it, so it would've had to have been really early on in the process."
"It's weird," Tony said as Steve guided him over to the metal bleachers along the third baseline. "I don't think I've ever seen this part of the base during the day."
“But… buddy, I—I don't—I can’t believe why he would—”  Dad broke off, shaking his head.  “Even if this were true, which I don’t—but anyway—okay.  Pete, even if this were true, there’s no way Obie would’ve been able to send Hammer Industries the money for these things without someone else noticing.  After all this time, someone would’ve eventually caught some whiff of it.”
Or the slight rattle in Tony's breathing that Steve had noticed ever since he'd got back from D.C. Or the deep purple circles under his eyes and the faint greyish tint to his olive skin that probably only Steve would notice.
"Yeah, when he got really sick as a toddler. My grandpa gave it to him," Peter said in amazement. "Wow. You never forget anything, do you?"
"Well, the time has come for us to say, enough! The time has come for the pawns, bishops, and knights to fight back! To take down the enemy king and queen and finally win this never-ending game! And today, we are going to do just that." He tightened his fingers around Tony's hand, already dreading the moment he'd have to let go.
There was also a thought bouncing around in the back of his mind that had been there ever since Beck's presentation. Beck had stated—rather emphatically—that his glasses contraption couldn't work without the added zombie effect of the CTX-616 drug, but…
"Indeed she has, Captain," JARVIS said. "I will also of course inform you if there are any changes in Master Peter's condition."
." Tony's teeth dug into his bottom lip as he glided his hands up the broad planes of Steve's back until they hooked around his shoulders, pulling him closer and pressing their foreheads together. "Feels so good, baby. You're too good to me."
incredible, even better than Steve had remembered, and it took nearly all of his willpower to keep himself from thrusting sharply up as Tony slowly sank down around him.
"Okay, but who?" asked Carol. "Do we know who this person is? And maybe more important, do we know where this person is now?"
"And I thought you were already asleep, sweetheart," Papa answered, winking at Peter. "Which you should be since you didn't get any last night."
"No, not really," Peter replied, breathing a slight sigh of relief as his locker popped open. He shoved his backpack and jacket inside, pulling out the books he needed for his first three classes. "I'd love to forget about all of it, actually, but I don't think that's possible anymore."
"I love you," he whispered, tracing his fingertip down the scar marking the centre of Tony's chest, the scar he'd always associated with Tony's never-ending strength and determination. "
"I know," said Steve, his heart doing a flip as he watched Peter leap from Tony's back, aiming directly for one of the Chitauri speeders.
How did he manage to get so unbelievably lucky? He and Tony had both been through hell and back multiple times, and yet Steve firmly believed that as long as they had each other, they would be able to get through just about anything.
Even more evidence that his little boy was growing up.  And that Tony was nowhere near ready for it.
Just as he had the previous day, Steve managed to completely lose track of the time as he and Peter proceeded to create an entire backstory about the blue and red momma bird and her three eggs, complete with what career paths the chicks would choose and whether or not one of them would be allergic to worms, requiring the momma to bring her bugs to eat instead.
Somehow, it just didn't seem right. The math was all wrong, and Tony had always abhorred when the math was wrong.
Steve sat ramrod straight on his stool for several minutes, staring so hard at the door that his eyes were out of focus.  He had known that he was perhaps tempting fate a bit too much when he’d chosen that particular location for his storefront, but in all of his wildest possible imaginations, he had never,
"Oh I know, hot stuff," Tony said with a grin. He tipped his head up to kiss him, forcing himself to pull back so they couldn't get too carried away. "But right now I'm thinking that we've got about thirty minutes before that kid of ours decides that he's hungry, and you know what happens when he decides that he's hungry."
Tony huffed out the breath he'd been holding, turning with wide eyes to Phillips, who gave him an approving nod.
"What?" Steve asked as he glanced up at the ceiling, swiping droplets of cold sweat from his forehead. "JARVIS?"
“And I’m pretty sure Tony would’ve offered to help,” Steve said.  He turned as Tony cleared his throat, holding up the stack of papers.
"Well, isn't that nice of you," Gwen said. Her green eyes were sparkling as she placed her hand on Peter's knee, sending a burst of warm fuzzies shooting up and down his leg. "So, is this Han Solo movie we're gonna see supposed to be any good?"
"Three security guards sustained some minor injuries and a couple of scientists who were working late got pretty freaked out, but no," said Natasha. "No fatalities."
Colonel Phillips owed Steve's father, Steve never found out. All he knew was the very next day, even though Steve was already eighteen and technically a year older than the military preferred for its enlisted men, his ma approached Steve and asked him if he wanted to participate in the program.
"Yes, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions for the Captain." Davis licked his lips, rearranging the pile of papers in front of him and shifting in his chair, and in general forcing Tony to bite his lip to avoid laughing out loud. Steve's nearly impeccable poise through Davis's disgusting questions had rattled the man, and Tony was so proud of his husband that he was nearly bursting with it.
The crowd erupts again as Steve raises his hands to smile and wave.  The cheers are a bit less enthusiastic than they were for Schmidt, which Steve quickly dismisses.  With the games being held in the recently reunified country of Sokovia for the first time, it’s no wonder that the cheers for Germany and the other European countries are louder since they’re geographically closer.
As Dad and Papa loved to joke, apparently Peter's appetite was trying to make up for a lot of lost time. Peter had always been able to eat a ton, or at least he had before his bum heart made him almost too weak to eat. But ever since he woke up in that metal tube down in the basement lab at the hospital, his appetite had been about a thousand times bigger than usual.
"And before you guys ask, no, Gwen's dad hasn't said anything about what happened at the theatre," Peter added as soon as Thor was out of earshot. "Or at least not to her."
"Yep," she said. "And if you're not feeling well enough to go to school in the morning, just let me know and I can bring your homework to you."
Gwen jumped as a huge, booming explosion filled the massive screen, her grip on Peter's hand tightening just as the strange dude who had been sitting behind Peter suddenly got to his feet, hurrying up the centre aisle like he had gotten spooked or something. Peter glanced back in Uncle Bucky's direction and gave him a nod, letting him know that he and Gwen were fine and there was no need to worry. Peter had noticed the guy when they had first sat down, thinking it was weird that he didn't have any snacks or drinks and was sitting so ramrod straight in the otherwise comfortable reclining chairs, but since his Spider Sense hadn't gone off at all he had decided that the guy was just a bit different, and hadn't really thought much about him since.
separate times over the course of Peter’s tryout.  Tony can’t remember ever being a sucker for dimples before, but holy hell, is he definitely now.  Because he is absolutely
Steve gulped, gripping Tony's hand as he gave a brief nod. "You're right. So, what should we do with this information?"
"We will, sir," said Stacy, followed by a series of three gunshots. "He's also very concerned for Peter, says he thinks that he saw him briefly before they were both overpowered."
"So, you wanna tell me what that was all about?" Gwen asked as they exited the classroom, right on cue. "I know you might not think that you need to pay attention all the time, but it's not like you to get called out for it in front of the entire class."
"Yep. That's my милая ошибка," Natasha said, tossing Steve a smirk. "Good thing your kid is cute, Rogers."
"I am absolutely certain, Captain," JARVIS said firmly. "My upgraded systems have detected no anomalies since the incident at the Tower."
Closing his eyes, Tony breathed in, absorbing the sounds and smells of the lake and the trees and the gentle wind, and the drop-dead gorgeous man standing next to him. For the first time in his life, Tony could truly say that he was content. His son was healthy, he had a man that he loved beyond words, and he finally had a real home to call his own.
Tony had even asked Sam that question a few times since he'd moved into the Tower, but not even he had a decent answer for it. His standard answer was that it was his job to help the team move forward from the whys and the what ifs, not to dwell on them.
, but Tony knew him better than that. As much as he still tried to hide it, constantly wrestling with his own persistent demons took a lot more out of Steve than he liked to let on, and adding Tony's in on top of everything else only made it that much worse.
With any luck Peter was already situated on Asgard, but knowing Tony, he was probably holed up in his lab, running himself ragged with trying to find him. Tears stung Steve's eyes as he imagined his beloved husband going mad with worry, refusing to eat or sleep and snapping at anyone who attempted to help him.
"That is for my wife and daughter!" Drax yelled as Thanos ripped the webs from his face, launching them so hard at Gamora that they sent her flying. Dr Strange quickly conjured some kind of mystical sword, swinging it at Thanos' head as Quill swooped off to the side, catching Gamora just before she would've slammed into a big pile of rocks.
And it was up to him to do so, as arrogant as it may have sounded. After both SHIELD and the government allowed HYDRA to grow undetected to the point where they nearly attained unmatchable power, there was no one who Steve could trust to help outside of his team.
"I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but I have orders," said Bartlett as one of his partners pulled out a pair of handcuffs that looked like they could've contained a rhinoceros.
He couldn't help but wonder if Gwen being out with her dad meant that she'd heard back from Oxford about her internship. Despite Peter's misgivings about her going, he had helped her prepare for her interview, and she had told him afterwards that she'd thought it had gone well.
"Copy that," Tony replied as he swerved, heading back towards the hole in the roof. "Then I think it's time for a new plan."
"No, it doesn't!" Peter yelled, startling them both enough that he nearly knocked over Dad's coffee. He got to his feet, running his fingers through his hair as he paced back and forth. "Dad, there's no way that Gwen's father is a HYDRA agent, there's just no way! I'd know it if he was!"
"Well, since the elections they've been able to stack their side of the deck a bit better," Steve said.
"Cap, these things are starting to circle around!" Bruce called from somewhere behind him. "I think they're trying to flank us!"
"All right, Steve," he said, so quietly he was surprised that Steve even heard him. "You have exactly one minute."
“Well, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind if you took her out sometime,” Tony said as they pulled onto the street.  “I don't drive too many places by myself, so I’m afraid she doesn't get out all that much.”
"The god you call Thor told us of a sister he had that was similar to Thanos," said Tattooed Guy. "He and Gamora bonded over their experiences with evil, murderous family members, and that is why Quill was jealous."
"All right gentlemen, we're getting a bit closer to the re-entry point now," Tony said, his slightly raspy voice in Steve's ear sending warm shivers down his spine as he guided his imaginary spacecraft through its orbit. After three full weeks of rehearsing launches and entering and maintaining planetary orbits, Tony had decided that he and Bucky were ready to start learning how to re-enter the planet's atmosphere and land.
"Please, sweetheart," Steve pleaded as he gripped Tony's elbows. "Can't we please just go back to bed?"
"Argh," moaned Scott, rubbing at his eyes with his fingers. "And I used to think that Hank's technobabble was confusing."
"Come in?" said Tony, his eyebrows shooting up when Colonel Phillips, Rhodey, and Sam all came into the room, assembling at the foot of Steve's bed.
"He doesn't—he just doesn't deserve to be saddled with a cripple," Uncle Bucky whispered. "He's already spent over three month's pay on setting up a house for me to live in and physical therapies and all the other shit I'm gonna need in order to function, and it's—it's just not fair to him. He deserves better."
“Hello, Mr Wilson,” Tony said, grateful when his voice didn't catch.  “Ah… my name is Tony.  Tony Stark.”
"Shh, honey, it's okay," Tony whispered. He wound his arm around Steve's neck, turning his head so he could kiss him. "It's okay, baby. I'm here."
His hand on Tony's shoulder, Steve raised his other hand to knock, then hesitated, not quite mentally prepared for what he might see. Despite Ma's best efforts at caring for him, Peter's condition had already been deteriorating before Steve left on the Phoenix mission, and the thought of him being even worse now, of him being hooked up to even more machines and wires and tubes and not able to interact with Steve or Tony at all, had Steve's chest so tight that he could barely breathe.
"And you, Tony," Steve said. He placed his hand on Tony's leg, gently squeezing. "Sometimes I think you forget that you were once a kid like Peter." He held up his hand, halting Tony's retort before he could even retort it. "But I agree with you. And once the mission's over, they won't. We'll make sure of it."
"Okay, I'm just gonna pull rank here and go with yes," James said from his seat next to Bruce. "Seeing as how Spider Boy and Flash Boy over there are just about ready to vibrate out of their seats."
"And there's that huge guest room there that never even gets used, and I really want to show her around everywhere, and introduce her to Pietro and Wanda, and she's told me a few times that she's never been upstate, and in the early spring it's really pretty and stuff with all the leaves that are starting to bud, and—"
Instead, after managing to stamp down his pain level just enough to drag his eyes downwards, he saw that instead of sprawled out on a freezing-cold floor, he was actually strapped to a concrete slab that was outfitted with several of what appeared to be some kind of fancy electrodes, not unlike the kind the SSR had used to measure his heart and lung capacity after his serum procedure.
“Mmm, if you say so,” Peter said warily.  “But, as you can plainly see, yes.  I have remembered my head.”
Tony huffed as he picked up his coffee cup, downing the rest of the lukewarm liquid as Peter stood his ground. The boy was just too damn smart for his own good most of the time.
“We’re good.  I think.  He offered to just pay me, if that’s what I wanted,” Steve said after a moment’s pause. “Do you think it’s about the money?”
The thought that it was no place that Steve belonged flitted across his mind before he could stop it.
One night. One million dollars.  He stared at the glowing, green numbers on the bedside clock telling him it was just past two in the morning.  Steve’s mind flashed back to the balcony, to Stark in his fancy suit, managing to look perfectly rumpled by the wind.  Heremembered thinking how Stark was smaller in person than he looked on TV or in pictures.  People always said that about celebrities. Steve supposed it was probably true.  But, somehow, Stark didn’t
“So…our plan is leave him.  Drop the car at Manny’s,” Malcolm counted off like he was tapping at a finger with each part of their plan.  “And just…hope to God that he doesn’t find out.”
“Okay,” Steve said.  Somewhat tentatively, since he wasn’t exactly sure what Tony liked or even, really, what he was was supposed to be doing with his hands, he reached out and let his hands skate across Tony’s back and arms.  That was nice.  Tony seemed to agree.  He arched into the touch, like a cat, seeking more.  Taking that for permission, Steve let his hands roam where they wanted. Through Tony’s hair because he liked the feel of it, strangely intimate to be able to touch him there, and over his back and hips, then carefully lower to the supple curve of his ass again.
“Ah, a lost soul,” the man said.  “How...interesting.” Something about the way he spoke, the timbre of his voice, perhaps, set the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck on end and a spike of cold lanced through his gut.
Steve made his way to the spot Tony had indicated and knelt down onto the plush carpet. He put his hands behind his back, as Tony had instructed him to do. His cock strained painfully between his legs, red and leaking from the head. A momentary feeling of ridiculousness at his position came over him, but he glanced at Tony’s back and remembered Tony’s impassive face after his outburst, and the need to be good enough to put pride and pleasure on Tony’s face worked on him like an aphrodisiac.
Steve looked askance at Rhodes, brow furrowing.  “Would you?  If you were in my position. What would you do?” Steve asked.
“That’s comforting…by the way, I have something to run by you when you finish telling me how Steve’s roommate is good at killing people,” Tony replied, mouth twisting into a grimace.
“Yeah,” Tony replied breathily, mouth suddenly dry.  The position had the benefit of stretching out the onesie’s front opening enough that it left most of Steve’s chest on display.  Tony’s gaze went to the dog tags again, his fingers tingling with remembered heat as his eyes trailed down past the dusky pink nipples, over the expanse of muscles to the fine sprinkle of light hairs that began just above the point of the V.   “Yeah, that’s—that’s good.  Just, ah.  Just lift your right knee up a bit.  Like that.  Good.  You—that’s good.  Now—ah—now, look up here,” Tony said, holding the camera up and out in front of him.  He adjusted one of the flat reflector screens, then stepped up onto the ladder so he could get the right angle.
“I saw that I am meant to love you  I saw that we could be happy. You and I. We could be so very happy, if you would but
“I’m sorry, I’ve gone temporarily deaf, what was that?” Murdock asked placidly. “Hey, I went instantly blind. It can happen,” Matt said at Pepper’s silence.
His mind was still half abed, his body warm and teetering between the need to stretch and move and an indolent desire to do little to nothing, as if all it would take was stilling himself for a moment to recapture whatever haze it was that had ruled his body and mind during the night.  He could almost see it, hovering just out of reach, but so close, and if he but stopped…turned around, returned, he could find it again…though he didn’t.  He never did.  He wondered if that was enough, not to let himself go back, or if now that he’d gorged himself, freeing himself from the fairy folk was as illusory as his mother’s tales claimed.
“What? No, it’s--that has nothing to do with this,” Steve said. “I’m not mad that you told him. It was a good idea. You’re right that I don’t know much about what happened to me, and I know you did it because you worry,” Steve conceded.  “It’s only that you did it without even consulting me, Tony, and--”
“Classy,” Natasha snorted. ““They’ve got a dedicated concierge just for that suite,” she informed him, and he didn’t really need to ask how she knew that. “I’ll drop your bag with them.”
“Smart and beautiful.  I like that,” Stone said with a smile that was probably supposed to be flirtatious but sent Tony’s heartrate spiking and klaxons blaring in his head.
In every other part of his life, he would have, he supposed.  That was what he did. What he was made for.  The things he could do, the things he had to do, they were about keeping people like Tony safe, he told himself, or they told him that, and he let them. He wasn’t sure if there was a real difference anymore.  What else was there for him?  He thought he needed the answer to be Tony.  Or someone did.  Someone not Tony, sure, but someone needed there to be an answer, and Tony was the sacrificial lamb, whether he knew it or not.
The city spread out beneath them, the glow of the lights and muted honking, rushing sounds echoing over the buzz from the ballroom.  Not as good a view as from the Tower, Tony noted, though you could see the large ‘A’ in the distance.  Never let it be said he was subtle, Tony thought rather proudly.  “Nice view,” Tony quipped, nodding towards the Tower.  “Thought you might need some air,” Tony remarked, loosening his bowtie and letting the ends hang down.
Shuri, Steve reminded himself, because the young girl who liked her technology and her music was long gone—said.  They’ll come after you, and Wakanda can’t protect you forever. We have bled enough. Fix it or run was the unspoken message.
“Unconventional?” Tony huffed bitterly.  “That’s one way to put it.  I mean, I was glad about it, at first, because…well, because.  But then, I thought…maybe with him, maybe it would be okay.  And then, I thought…maybe it would be better than okay.  If he wanted me like that.  Which he doesn’t, so, fine. Whatever.  Let him have what he wants.  I have my ‘bots and my work and…”  Tony stopped, forcing out a rough breath of air that seemed to have to scrape itself out of his lungs.  “He’s gone a lot.  Missions and stuff. Brings me souvenirs, though.  That’s what I get. A--a coffee mug. When he comes home.  A mug. But, he comes home to me.  To me, Jarvis.  He comes home. That’s enough, right?  I mean, that should be enough.  I don’t know why that isn’t enough, Jarvis.”
"No, there weren't only two doses made, Tony," Howard said as he came up next to Colonel Phillips. Steve clenched his jaw, fighting the strong urge to step in front of Tony. "In fact, I made a total of six doses, but somehow only three of them made it into Langaran hands."
, just—" Peter said, or rather, squeaked into Dad's chest. He knew she was just worried about him, but her voice was rapidly reaching dog whistle levels in pitch and his head already felt like it was splitting in two.
"Someone either associated with Damage Control or someone associated with a member of Damage Control's oversight, yeah," Tony answered. "But hell, Steve, that could be any number of people! D.C. is filled to the brim with wanna-be government leeches and lackeys!"
"Yes, Young Starkson, I'm sure you did, given the quality of your education here," said Thor. "And when I slipped into the water and allowed the spirits to overtake me, I saw in my vision six brightly-coloured gems, the combined power of which is nearly indescribable."
"Okay, so I'm absolutely sure that you didn't make things worse," Tony cut in. His heart was thudding so hard it was practically echoing, but he couldn't afford to panic now. Not when Steve was right on the verge of it. "You're way, way too smart for that, so why don't you try again, yeah?"
"Here," Bucky said as he screwed the cap off a bottle of blue superwater and handed it to Steve, who guzzled the whole thing down in about ten seconds. "Gods, Steve, I haven't seen you this bad since you first got the serum!"
"All right," Tony said proudly. Slowly, he raised his right hand, splaying his fingers just as Steve entered the lab, carrying two steaming cups of coffee.
Tony gulped as the door slowly opened, his heart skittering at the tentative smile on Rogers' face as he stepped inside.
"Okay, fine," Peter said after a short pause. "But it's not like I don't already know what's going on. I don't need Grandpa to tell me anything 'cause I already know all of it."
I was able to finish this chapter earlier than I thought, so you guys get it a day early! 😊.  Please be aware that this chapter gets pretty dark.  Our boys are hurting, and not handling it well at all 😢.  It does get more optimistic towards the end though.
"I know that," said Steve. Inside the room he could hear Tony still talking to Peter, telling him some story or something that only the two of them would understand. "I'm gonna ask Tony to marry me, Ma. As soon as I get back from the mission. I've already bought him a ring and everything."
"It's okay, honey, I'll get him!" Dad said as the beam deposited Peter onto the side of the ship. "Pete, just hold on!"
“Okay, but three shipments of five thousand each only equals fifteen thousand,” stated Tony.  “So… what the hell are the rest of ‘em for?”
Somehow the experiment seemed to have caused he and Peter's empathic connection to reactivate, the same connection that had allowed him to locate Peter during the battle.
"Well… no, not exactly," Peter replied. "It's not really that simple. Have you told Betty that you like her?"
About fifty seconds later, it becomes apparent exactly why Steve was so nervous.  Tony’s heart skips a beat as he watches Steve touch the wall in a heartbreaking fourth place, leaving him out of the medals.  As Steve pulls himself out of the pool, Tony can tell by his expression that he’s absolutely stunned, even as he graciously congratulates all three of the medalers.
"He's a plague," Bruce continued. "He invades planets, he takes what he wants, and he wipes out half their population. Guys, he's the one who sent Loki. The attack on New York? That was him. The Chitauri are his army, Tony. And he's their general."
Tony turned his head just enough to kiss the underside of Steve's jaw. "I know, honey. I love you too."
"Tony!" called Sam as a man suddenly appeared in the image, dressed in the uniform of a Russian Army Colonel and holding a red-bound book embossed with a dark grey star. "Are you sure—?"
And he knew it was even worse for Tony. While Steve had no memories of Peter from when he was well, he knew that Tony's vast memories of him as a happy little boy running around outside and climbing trees haunted him as they watched Peter grow weaker and weaker.
The smile dropped from Dad's face like a rock. "Not if I can help it, Pete. Not like I need his permission for anything."
"No," Peter interrupted. "I know what you're gonna say, but you're wrong, so I'm not gonna listen to it."
Steve gasps as the thought slips past the protective shield inside his mind before he can stop it, practically parading itself out in front of him and dancing a jig.  Steve has told himself multiple times that he needs to keep a lid on his personal feelings, needs to maintain the proper chain of command, or the team could fall apart at some critical juncture, but—
"Here we are," Steve said as Tony pulled into the cracked concrete driveway of a small, bluish-grey house that looked remarkably like his own, even down to the overgrown yard and scraggly bushes lining either side of the front steps.

He glanced at his clock, letting out another groan when he saw that it was already after 3pm. Through his slightly cracked door he could hear Uncle James talking to someone in the living room, and he knew Dad was in his lab, no doubt talking to one of his army of lawyers to try and figure out some legal loophole that would force HYDRA to release Papa back to them.
"The purple stone is the Power Stone," said Wong. He stepped over Dr Strange, his hands clasped behind his back. "He must have retrieved it from somewhere offworld."
Tony shook his head against Steve's back. "Hell no it's not, and I've already got JARVIS working on it. There's gotta be a commonality in there somewhere, we just haven't found it yet."
And, as it turned out, both Peter and Dad were right. Dad's phone call with the convoy foreman ended up being quick and easy, Papa's dinner turned out amazing, as usual, and Peter was able to finish all of his homework in time to help Dad out in the lab before bed. They were working on developing a portable repulsor, one that could be launched in groups with the theory that they could be used to help stabilise airplanes experiencing engine failures or other similar issues. Dad had already successfully tested out a prototype at the Compound recently, which managed to keep the Quinjet level enough for a smooth emergency landing after a simulated engine failure, even, as Dad liked to point out, with Uncle Clint at the controls.
“Yours,” Steve slurred out. Tony came with a shout, hips jerking forward a few more times as he spent himself inside Steve. He groaned and bent forward, letting his forehead rest against the expanse of Steve’s sweat-slickened back for a moment. He felt the familiar swelling pressure on the end of his cock and pushed himself back up as the welcoming gush of warm wetness coated his shaft. His knot released, expanding inside Steve until it filled him fully. Steve’s body bucked and shuddered as the knot brushed across his prostate.
Steve stood there at the door, unable to comprehend what he was seeing.  He was shaking his head, opening and closing his mouth, trying to force the image to form into something else.  Something that made sense.
“God, you are truly awful at lying. Really, don’t even sing ‘Santa Clause is Coming to Town,’ you’ll never make it through the chorus,” Tony said after a moment’s pause.  “Why do you even need seven thousand dollars—no, wait, thirty thousand.  You have twenty-three in savings.  What’s the thirty thousand for?  You said you owed someone.  Who?  Not a bookie or loan shark, I’m pretty damn sure of that.  So, who then? SI gave settlements—generous settlements—to the families of those who—“ Tony stopped, cleaning his throat.  His gaze dropped from Steve and darted to the window, where he stared at nothing.  “To everyone who was hurt in—in what happened.”
Eight days later, he told Joshua about his idea for a new kind of missile.  Josh was a good listener as long as you kept tossing nuts his way, but ran up the tree by the deck and chattered at him, tail all puffed out, if he ran out.  Or maybe Josh was just a pacifist.  Hard to say.  He finally broke down and called Happy, who showed up a couple hours later and took him to an outdoor mall boasting over one hundred and fifty shops and restaurants, or so the brochure proclaimed.  Tony sat in the car and stared out the window at the people out enjoying the day, while Happy brought them both back milkshakes.  If he thought it was strange that Tony didn’t get out of the car, he had the wherewithal not to say so.  Maybe one day, he’d go back.  Walk in a store and buy something that he picked out, all on his own, because he liked it, but for now, it was enough just to be close to it.
“I mean, you look nice.  With the—the tie and suit and all,” Steve stammered.  “The different suit.  Than the one from earlier.”
Tony could get sometimes.  He wondered if people know that about Tony.  How quiet he could be, how intimate it could make things, that absence of commentary, when all of his focus shifted and settled.  How it always caught Steve a little by surprise to be on the receiving end of it.
“Wouldn’t bet against Steve, Obie.   How many of those panzers did he take out with just his shield?  Oh—Peg, you remember that—that thing at the dam?  Thought we’d never break those lines.  Months and months, God!  What the hell were they thinking? They should have sent him there sooner, I can tell you that,” Howard said.
“If there’s a tap-out, the intercom will chime three times, and you stop immediately. There are cameras for everyone’s protection. All files are destroyed at the end of the session. Check this box here that you understand,” the man continued, turning the tablet around to face Steve. There was nothing on the screen except an empty box. Steve punched it, and it darkened, then disappeared.
The bed dipped, and Tony was there, smiling down at him, possessive gaze moving over him, eyes wide and dark. Tony’s mouth was parted slightly, and his breath came quick and heavy.  Steve shivered at the look.  The pressure down the length of his cock where it jutted out between them grew exponentially, and he dug his hands into the bedcovers to keep from reaching out to grasp it.

“Jewelry belongs to you, Tony.  It is one of the few items of any value that Omegas can legally own.  It’s portable, easily hidden.  You can trade it or pawn it,” Jarvis observed mildly, like he was discussing the weather, while Tony stared at him.  “Do you really think the love of sparkly stones shared by so many Omegas grew solely from shallowness and vanity?  Jewelry is independence.  A way out, Tony.  Not all Omegas are as fortunate as you are in their mate.”
“Zola took you to Hammer?” Tony questioned, voice almost mild, as if they discussed the day’s weather.
A part of him wanted to just set the food and water down outside the cave and go.  The man could stand now, albeit not particularly well yet, but he couldn’t shirk his responsibility just because he was humiliated.  What would Maara think of him? A healer who let his embarrassment keep him from healing was no healer.
“I want that, too,” Steve said, his voice thin and pinched, and he imagined parts of the words still stuck in his throat, unable to make it past his collar. There are no secrets, only lies, he thought, though he held his face still, even in the dark.
“You love an idea.  But, ideas do not fill your belly, Raj’Inama,” Cam protested.  “So, I could be free to be hungry anywhere in the world that I wished?  I could be free to huddle in some dirt hut out on the steppes burning donkey dung because I have no wood?  Free to scrape together what coin I can come by, working all day for the kind of merchant who cannot afford slaves?  Why would I want this
“You really don’t know, do you?”  Tony asked.  “Did Barnes and the others think I was just going to throw my hands up in the air when they chased Pepper off?”
“Something like that,” Tony smiled tightly, tilting his head and returning Rhodey’s look as they walked up the steps into the building, Pepper’s heels clacking on the sidewalk behind them.
Harder now.  Faster.  Rougher.  There would be callouses on Tony’s hand from his work, Steve well knew.  They would scrape along the delicate skin there.  He could almost feel it on his own cock, which jutted out insistently between his legs as Steve’s eyes tracked Tony’s hand while he stroked himself.  Small pants of air sounded in the quiet of the room.  Another groan.  A broken-off curse.  Tony’s body slumped, then bowed, and he cried out, harsh and guttural.
“Yes, having only known him for less than a day, that does seem shockingly out of character for him,” Steve said with a dubious look aimed in Tony’s direction.  Tony threw his hands up in his best ‘who me’ attempt, then gave up at Rhodey’s look and dropped them to his sides.
It was just that as soon as his lips brushed Steve’s, tasted Steve’s mouth, he wanted more, nothing was enough, it couldn’t possibly be enough, and something wound its way down his spine, that itchy heat thing that pooled low in his belly, coiling down deep and driving him insane, he was sure he would come apart, skin sloughing off in waves if he wasn’t able to touch and taste and feel, God, he needed to feel, just feel. As if from a distance, he heard a low rumbling sound and realized it was probably coming from him, and he realized he was hard and straining with need.  He felt Steve shudder against him, swaying a bit, and thought he should probably ask if Steve was alright, but then his hands brushed the warm skin where Steve’s shirt met his pants and that answered whatever question his mind was still capable of concerning itself with.
Five weeks later and everything was horrible. Okay, not horrible.  Not at all, really.  It was great.  Fantastic.  Absolutely everything he could possibly want, from dinners to movies to baseball games and Jesus Christ, it was horrible.  Tony was going to be the death of him if he didn’t do something other than spend long stretches of time kissing Steve deeply, running hands up and down Steve’s body, and then pressing a chaste kiss to Steve’s lips and wishing him a good night.
They continued on for another ten minutes or so, until Mr Harrington called an end to the practise, practically tripping over himself in his haste to rush over to Papa so he could shake his hand.
Tony sighed, checking the old-fashioned wall clock he’d installed by the doorway at Steve’s request.  While Steve had adjusted well to most of the twenty-first century technology, thanks largely in part to Peter, he still far preferred to use analog devices whenever possible.  Things like non-digital clocks, windup record players instead of MP3s, and compasses instead of fancy GPS devices were just a few examples, and Tony was only too happy to indulge his beloved man in his desires to keep a few familiar things close while he continued to navigate through his new time.
"The Avengers are a family as well, sir," Peter said, his voice trembling despite his best efforts to keep it steady. "My parents are married just like you and Mrs Stacy, and while my aunt and uncles aren't related to me by blood, that doesn't mean that I love them any less. And just because my papa and Uncle Bruce are enhanced it doesn't mean they're not people, just like the rest of us."
Because as much as Steve hated to admit it, Anthony Stark was quite possibly the most beautiful man that he had ever seen in his life, and as much as he had tried to convince himself that he needed to hate him because of what happened to his father, from the moment he laid eyes on him in that classroom, Steve had realised that that was going to be impossible.
"All right then, little guy, off you go," said Steve. He planted a quick kiss to Peter's forehead, then guided him down the hall to his room, one hand holding Tony's and his other resting protectively on Peter's shoulder. Tony's hands were still shaking as they tucked him in, and he had to force himself to smile as he kissed him goodnight for the second time.
"Incoming," came Clint's voice over the comm. Not three seconds later, he dropped down from the arms of one of Tony's reconnaissance suits about ten metres away, unsheathing an arrow before he'd even skidded to a halt. "Might wanna step back there, Tony."
Which, if Peter was honest, didn't really narrow things down all that much. Dad had made more than a few enemies during the years that he was making weapons, and they probably didn't just disappear once he stopped.
"No, it doesn't," Steve said with a light sigh. He sat down on the edge of Tony's desk, pretty much the only available space for him to sit in the room. "Does that worry you?"
"Well, Fury's pretty good at stuff like that, 'cause he helped me with the exact same thing," said Natasha. She stepped forward, holding out her hand towards the woman. "I'm Natasha."
"Yes, yes, I'm sure this is all quite important," Senator Davis cut in. "But as I'm sure you're aware, Mr Stark, our time is both quite limited and quite valuable, so why don't we just get on with it, shall we?"
"Okay, but why," Peter asked. "Just 'cause he's rich? Did people use to report on his comings and goings on a regular basis?"
The first two files he downloaded turned out to be more supply lists, with his frustration almost boiling over into rage when the third ended up being yet another page of the HYDRA manifesto. Against his better judgement, Peter decided to read it anyway, the knot that had been sitting down in the pit of his stomach ever since he'd gone to bed growing larger and heavier with each passing sentence.
"Where are my husband and son?" Steve demanded, his hands clenching into fists when the female alien's lips curled into a smirk.
Steve's frozen fingers were so tightly wrapped around Tony's gauntlets that he had managed to dent the metal. "S-stay with m-me!" he gasped. "P-please, d-don't l-leave me alone!"
"Flashman, you've got incoming!" Tony cried as pieces of his target suddenly shot out in all directions. "Get 'em outta there!" In a burst of flying debris Pietro took off, gathering Natasha into his arms and disappearing.
Peter huffed out a sharp breath, loosening his ironclad grip on his poor polar bear before he managed to force it into another dimension. "That's what I told her, and she said it was fine."
"Huh?" Peter whispered as he turned on his heel, leaning closer to the cracked door. He felt a small pang of guilt for eavesdropping, but if the guy really was talking about his father, then was it still technically eavesdropping?
"No, that won't be necessary, Mr Stark," Davis said hotly. "I do, however, have a few final questions that I wish to ask."
Tony pulled back his head, his brown eyes twinkling in the dim morning light as he angled Steve's chin down so he could kiss him. The kiss was slow and lazy, as even on a normal day Tony never woke up very fast, which somehow managed to make Steve's desire for him skyrocket even more. Aside from the sex, which was always incredible, Steve just really loved kissing Tony.
And he enjoyed it even less when said news was reporting on whatever goofy space phenomena had occurred over Africa. Ever since he'd stumbled upon an entire space-faring army just waiting to invade Earth during his emergency missile flight through Loki's portal, Tony had adamantly decided that he had seen all he'd needed of space, thank you very much.
Papa shook his head, giving Peter a proud smile. "Wow. I don't think I'll ever get used to just how smart you are."
"Sounds good." Peter pulled on his jacket, swinging his backpack over his shoulder as Gwen packed up her index cards.
Tony’s fingers curled into such tight fists that his fingernails broke through his skin, causing him to flinch.  He drew in a deep breath, deliberately loosening his grip as he looked Fury straight in the eye.
"So that's why I think we need to move the sceptre," Peter said, finally pausing to take a breath. "'Cause I'm thinking that one of these semi-enhanced people can run really, really fast and was trying to steal it when the drone fired at up at the Compound, so—"
What they were planning, if anything happened to go wrong, then… there was no telling what could happen.
"No! Why would you do that?" Steve yelped, his heart jumping into his throat. The last thing Tony needed was another potential exposure to the drug that almost killed him. "Tony, I don't want you or Peter anywhere near that stuff!"
The party, as it turned out, was quite honestly the best party that Steve had ever attended. The food, catered by Tony's very favourite restaurant, the place where Mr Jarvis would often take him, was absolutely impeccable, and the company even more so. As the food and beverages flowed freely and everyone in attendance came to offer Steve and Tony their personal congratulations, Steve felt certain that his face was in danger of becoming permanently locked in the wide smile he'd worn ever since he'd first set eyes on Tony from across the aisle.
"Tony, I just want you to calm down first!" protested Steve. "Please, sweetheart! If you go bursting into Peter's room like this, all you're gonna do is scare him!"
"Well, that'll kinda depend on what he thinks of you when you do finally meet him," answered Peter. "But like I said, he usually trusts my judgement, so I think it'll be fine."
Several heartbeats passed before Dad answered. "You're damn right, buddy. We don't lose. And I'm not ready to start now."
"We are," Steve said, only semi-convincingly. "But even so, when you said that just now, that I was a good man, it just… it just made me think about it, and I hope—I just hope that you're right. I hope that whatever intentions Dr Erskine had with his serum, and with me, that they don't come back around and try and hurt you or our son again, because… Tony, I don't—I wouldn't be able to—"
“Oh, Tony,” he said, shaking his head.  “Tony, Tony, Tony, how many times have I told you not to fuck around with stuff you don't understand.  It’s always like this.  Someone comes into your life who’s a less-than-stellar influence, and suddenly you start sticking your nose in places where it clearly doesn’t belong.  And now, since you seem to feel the need to hold this conversation in front of your friends rather than in private, I’m afraid—”
