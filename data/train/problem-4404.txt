He picked his phone up off of his bed, where he had tossed it when he got in, and sat down on his bed, sinking into the soft mattress below him, letting the towel fall loose over his legs. He checked it, finding two missed calls and four messages, both calls were from Michael, he’d deal with that later. He checked the messages, the first was Ion wondering how John and the others were doing, two from ‘Drea that he didn’t even look at those, just scrolled down to the next one. It had been months since he had seen that name on his phone.
Cas pulled out his phone, dialed the number he had programed for the best pizza place around and ordered two pizzas, one all meat without italian sausage and a pepperoni, bacon, mushroom and onion, and some garlic bites, paying for with the card he had in his wallet.
Cas was talking mainly to Dean’s hair but Dean still heard him, “I’m not saying we should jump into bed together,” Dean said lightly, lifting his head and looking at Cas, “but I’ve slept better here than I have in days.”
Cas walked home at a slow pace not really wanting to face his parents now knowing that they had been right about Dean. He walked up to the house about thirty minutes later, seeing his mother sitting out in her rocking chair. "Oh thank God," she sighed as she rushed out to meet her very tired son. "I didn't think I'd see you again,"  she wrapped her arms around Cas. "Come on in. I'll make you a sandwich. You don't have to talk if you don't want but if you do I'm right here, baby, as always." She tugged Cas's arm until he followed her inside and to the kitchen.
She let go of Cas and ran over to Sam, “Bye-bye Uncle Sammie.” Sam picked her up and she kissed his cheek.
“Sam bitched at me the entire time you and Jo were together. Kept telling me that I was acting like someone stole my puppy.” Dean huffed out a small laugh.
“I have to, Ash has my keys,” Dean got quiet again; it wasn’t an awkward silence like one might think, but a silence filled with loss and regret. Dean tried not to think about how many time he and Benny had skipped class to hide in the gym or how they would race down the steps that they sat on now.
Dean looked up and Cas, his bright green eyes almost glowed with rage, maybe he was meant to be an alpha, Cas thought, “What?” he asked.
“Yes, I am.” the shaggy alpha said, “Why are you here, Dean? Why care now?” He moved from standing in front of Dean to sitting in a chair beside him.“From what Cas had said I didn’t think you would come, told him he was crazy for putting you down. But, anyhow, what are you gonna do, now that you know?” he paused for minuet waiting for Dean’s answer.
“You turned your back on me when I needed you the most. I went through hell because you claimed me and then rejected me. I gave you everything and you almost killed me, literally. I can’t do this right now.”
A low feral growl echoed in the room, causing Dean and Benny to turn to Cas. His eyes were glowing, a dangerous shade of red. He was fuming at the site in front of him. How dare this Alpha think he can be next to his family. Dean and the baby are his. Dean has his claim and Grace has his blood. They are his.
He didn't know about most of them but Marshall had been in killed in Iraq also, so the town paid tribute to him, much like they had Benny. As for Ron, well Dean didn't think that anyone would forget what happened to that kid, turned out Ron was schizo, went off his meds, and he robbed one of the main banks in town, claiming that the manager had laser eyes.
“He’s inside with your mama,” she told him, sitting down beside him. “You know how she loves that boy. Still swears he looks just like you. Today seems to be a good day, doesn’t it.”
Dean was eating some soup when Bobby returned with a bag from a pharmacy. When bobby walked in the room, Dean handed the almost empty bowl to Mary and she exited the room. “Do you think you can make it to the bathroom? I need you to take this,” he handed Dean a small box.
Cas would never admit to the damage that Dean leaving had truly done to him. It was a hurt that he would never forget and something that would always linger somewhere with him, no matter what happened with him and Dean. One day he would be free of Michael and his all alphaness bullshit family and he would apologize to Dean and beg for the rest of his life, if he needed to, to get Dean back in his arms and he would never ever let Dean go again.
Mary was the light in the house. She was kind and loving, always did her best to make the ones around her happy. She lived to see her boys smiles. Working part time as a nurse, one of the few jobs an omega was allowed to have, barbaric I know. She knew how to  make people feel better, but not always medically. She had a gift. She was the best omega that many people know.
Sam climbed into the van and told Dean bye. Mary said bye to Dean also and walked around the van. Dean stepped back onto the porch and watched them drive away before looking into the dish. Holy cow, it was apple pie. Dean may have squealed a little.
Dean moaned as Cas’ kisses stole his breath. He knew that this should not be happening but he couldn't find it in himself to stop the omega. Cas was so wet and impossibly tight around him.
“Cas was right, Michael, it’s time for you to leave.” Dean reached over and grabbed Cas’ hand holding him in place.
Crowley pulled into the driveway and helped Dean inside and up to his room, “Do you need me to get you anything?” he asked as Dean laid back on the bed.
“You know, Cassie,” Bart spoke loud enough for the entire lunchroom, “If your little brother, Dean, over there wont take of you, I can. I can take real good care of you, baby boy.” Bart lifted his hand to Cas’ cheek and patted it gently.
“He won't be,” John said looking at Mary then Dean, both of who nodded. John then looked at Cas, “You always have a home, Son. We’ll figure out the details later.”
Dean nodded understanding what Gabe was talking about. He had already taken so much from Cas, to much. He wouldn’t take anymore.
“Hi,” Dean said after a moment. “Mom told me where you moved to,” he added after Cas didn't say anything, “I hope you don't mind.”
“I know, but you looked peaceful and I miss her.” They went back to the living room and Cas sat on the couch, “I miss her so much,” he looked up at Dean, who still stood in the middle of the room, “I miss you both so much and having you here, even if you're asleep, it’s like, well, it's like heaven.”
Cas pulled his hand back and began playing with the knee of his jeans. They sat in silence for a moment, “Are you going back to the party?” Cas asked still messing with his knee.
Dean turned his head to the side and buried his face in Cas’s dark brown hair, and he placed a hand over Cas’s on the dark mat, “Comfortable?” Dean asked.
Cas doesn’t remember much after that. When he woke in his bed, he could see it was dark outside, so he must have been out for a few hours at least. “...Sleep, Sir, you can't go in there,” was the first thing Castiel heard his room came into focus around him. The voice was strong but lacked any power behind it, Ion, again was trying to save Castiel’s ass.
So so sorry about the wait on this. I wasn't sure how this chapter was gonna happen until about a week ago. I've looked it, deleted and retyped what i didn't like and I'm still not completely sure I'm happy with this but I can't make y'all wait any longer. so as all ways tell me what you think I love your feed back and think about what all of yall say when writing new chapters so please let me know.
“I was,” Dean spoke up before Mary could continue. He had been nice to Cas, well nicer, but it wasn’t his fault that Cas left today.
“No, he’s fine here,” Dean wasn’t really eating anymore just pushing the green beans around his plate, “but you can’t expect it to be like it was. He may still be family but it’s different now.”
“Yep,” Dean said, agreeing, “wanna know a secret?” Dean wasn't sure he actually wanted to tell Cas this, but he needed to get it off his chest. He needed to tell him how he felt, how he has felt for so long.
John sat in the dark living room, in his chair, looking at his wife sitting at the table, looking so incredibly sad. It was his fault. He could feel the stiffness in his knuckles from where he punched a kid. A boy. How could he do that? He was stronger than that. It wasn’t just Castiel that he was mad at. He was mad at himself and Kate and Mary and Dean and Sam. He was just mad.
“No,” Dean sighed and shook his head, “I had Benny whenever I needed to figure things out. He was my best friend.”
Dean had never heard a voice so deep and gravely before. He knew that he had been caught; he might as well fess up, “Yeah, “ he called back in voice that he would have like to be much more in control. Dean stepped into the aisle and began to walk toward the man on the stage.
Cas walked through the dining room and into the living room making up Dean’s mind for him.  Dean followed Cas through the house and into the living room, sitting down on the other end of the couch from Cas.
They left the room and walked back to the living room, both sitting on the couch this time. Cas sat Gracie in lap. She giggled more and started to yawn.
Dean sighed, “Do I know you?” he asked, already knowing the answer. The piano man knew Dean and from the sound of his voice was not a fan of his in high school, not that Dean could blame the man if he was one of Dean’s favorite victims.
Cas laughed, stood up and left the room. It only took him a few more minutes to get ready to school. He walked around the house collecting what he needed and fixing him a bagel before he walked out the house, checked to make sure the door was locked and walked to his car.
“A few weeks later, he had arranged for me to marry your mother and Luke and Gabe weren't spoken about again.”
“Just don’t leave her again,” Dean whispered, “please don’t punish her because of me, of what I did.” Nothing else was said and Emmy was rolled back in sporting a sky blue cast, that almost did match Cas’s eyes. She crawled back onto Cas’s lap and snuggled into his chest. Cas wrapped his arms around Emmy and pulled her close, holding on to her for as long as he could and trying to let Dean’s words sink in.
John grabbed a fork out of the cooler bag and handed it back to Dean, “Enjoy,” he smiled. As Sam walked up John tossed him two sandwiches, both with his name on it.
What a great morning it was, waking up beside Dean, wrapped in his brother’s strong arms, his breath hot on Cas’ neck. He was in paradise. Cas had tried not to move, to pretend to be asleep but he guesses he moved to fast, or maybe when he realised that Dean was hard and pressing into his ass, Cas thinks now, that maybe Dean had been drifting awake to and noticed that also, but no matter how it happened. It happened.
She's said the same lines a million times. She knew how right they were but that didn't stop her from crying her whole way home.
He started working for Bobby full time in the small garage slash scrap yard the old man had. Dean was good at fixing cars always had been. Thanks to John, Dean’s father that passed away when Dean was fifteen. John had taught Dean all about cars and had left the boy his most prized possession, his baby, a sleek black beauty, a 1967 chevy impala. Dean passed his GED test while working full time at Bobby’s, keeping Sam on the straight and narrow and taking care of his ailing mother. Dean thrived when he was busy. He couldn’t think about any stray thoughts if his mind was always busy. It was late at night when the house was dark and silent that Dean let him mind wander to where his beautiful omega was and how he was doing.
“Alright, I’ll talk to him. Hand him the phone.” Bobby did just that and passed the phone to Dean. Benny talked to, told him that he was gonna come back, that he would be there in just a hour or so and then he just talked. He talked and tried to sooth the whimpering omega. Soon the contractions eased. They stopped completely when the alpha arrived at Bobby's and climbed into bed behind the omega.
“He claimed him?” John gritted out through clenched teeth. He knew letting those boys be together would end badly but he didn't think it would be like this.
Dean wondered what happened to Scott, Sophie, and Tessa as their pictures slipped on and off the screen.
Dean watched as high school and some college photos of the missing classmates flowed across the screen. Everyone looked so happy.
Dean smiled and followed behind Cas to the car. Dean closed the door behind Cas as he slid into the passenger seat before walking around the front of the car and climbing in the driver seat.
“You know the rules, Castiel, you had your fun and now you’re an Alpha, time to act like it.” His father released him and grinned, “Are you having fun with your Omegas, son? Heard you’re going through them like candy,” he said smiling, “good night, Son.” His father turned and walked down the hall that led to his study.
“Its getting late,” Cas sighed. Dean didn't say anything just looked at Cas, “If you want I can take y’all home”
Sam and Dean were lost in conversation when the waitress returned with their drinks, sitting one in front of Sam and the other by Dean, “Your food will be out in a minute and Ellen said that she would be out in a minute to see y’all.”
“Its ok, Dean,” Sam smiled softly, “it was about an hour after y’all got quite that he left, all sad smiles and shit. Just told me bye and walked out. ‘m sorry Dean.”
“Yep,” Dean closed his eyes and the words just fell out as Cas backed out of the parking spot and left the school grounds. “I bought it for Lisa as a wedding present and now I’m alone in a house that I don’t want, surrounded by memories of a family that I can’t have anymore. I don’t even go upstairs anymore. Ben’s door hasn’t been opened in months. She took everything from me.”
Part of him was beyond happy to be under the same roof as Dean, but all of him was upset about how Dean as treating him. He understood it though.
Mary didn’t say anything at first but Cas saw her face fall slightly. “You’re not intruding, Cas, you are family too,” she said it earnestly and Cas knew that she believed it, but it didn’t change how things were at the moment.
“Wow,” it was beautiful, hardwood cabinets and counters, dark countertops and wood backsplash behind the sinks, red plaid curtains hung in front a window looking out onto a dark, deserted street. The applinences were nice and shiny. This kitchen was nicer than his, and he was the rich one.
“Thanks,” Dean said tiredly. “We can watch t.v. or something ‘til Anna gets here.” Dean grabbed the remote of the coffee table and turned on the tv. “There’s bound to be something on this damn thing.” He flipped through the channels until he landed on Dr. Sexy, they were all reruns but it was one of Dean’s quilty pleasures, it used to drive Lisa insane, she would always accuse him of watching it to fantasize about him while they were having sex. He laid the remote down on the couch and stretched out as far as he could.
“Yes, Alpha,” stilling his hips automatically. Dean’s mouth followed the path of his hands, pausing briefly for a moment over each nipple before moving farther down his body.
They were almost done when Mary’s phone started ringing, she hurriedly answered it. She didn’t say much just a few okays, we will be there in a minute and thank you, as she hung up. She looked at the boys, “John’s showing signs of waking up soon, we should get going. I’ll go get the check from Ellen,” she said sliding out of the booth and stood up.
Cas tensed under Dean’s hands but didn't push him away, couldn't push him away, “She fell because I was there. I wanted to see her and I distracted her and she fell. Lisa said that I could come in and see her and I want to see her. I want to know her. I’m so sorry Dean.”
Sam walked in while Dean was pouring himself a glass of tea. “Hey Sammy,” he called over his shoulder, “when’s Mom coming to get you today.
Cas turned back to Uriel, moving faster than he ever has before, his hand around Uriel’s throat, nails digging into the flesh, “Touch him, and so help me God, I will rip your fucking throat out.” He kept a grip on Uriel's throat, pushing up, so that the tip of the boy’s shoes just were touching the ground, and looked around at the small group of alphas that belong to his father crew,  “That goes for all of you, even look in Dean’s direction and I will rip you apart.”
Cas wanted to go in there and talk to her, to see her up close in person again. He walked over to the gate and stopped. Lisa followed him down to the gate and opened it. Cas walked just inside the gate and passed. He looked up to where Emmy was playing, hanging on a set of monkey bars. She was smiling, swinging from bar to bar.
“I was an ass in high school and really for no other reason than because I could be. I know it doesn't make much difference now but I am sorry. I’m sorry for making you ever doubt yourself. I’m so sorry for everything.” Dean kept his eyes out at the empty seats, not wanting to look at the man, that the boy he broke down everyday at school had grown into.
“She woke up a few minutes ago,” Mary said shaking the bottle and testing on her hand, “we can get her back to sleep why don’t you get a shower and go to sleep yourself. You don’t have to do this all on your own. We are here to help baby.” She handed the bottle to John and walked over to Dean. She kissed him on the forehead before shooing him upstairs to take a shower then back to bed.
It was pitch black when Dean pulled into a roadside motel for the night. Cas followed Dean into room 13. It was a small dingy motel room. Dean lead Cas in and Cas sat down in a small chair.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean said removing the tinfoil completely and handing Cas a fork. “You didn’t answer my question, do they pick on you often?”
“Sorry. It's just all so complicated. So much more than I even realised to begin with. It... god mama, what did I do?” Dean slid the collar of his shirt off his shoulder enough to show the scar.
“Oh, umm, since around five, maybe.” Cas sat the syrup on the table and filled up both glasses with orange juice before placing it on the table as well. “We had fun didn’t we, sweetheart?” Cas looked down at Grace, smiling as she shoved her thumb in her mouth.
He passed the bathroom that was on the opposite wall than Dean’s room  and opened the door next to Dean’s. It was Gracie’s room. Cas knew that these room may never be used but he wanted them ready for his family in case they were ever needed. Gracie’s crib was placed against the wall in front of the door. It was a stormy grey high back victorian style crib. There was a matching dresser and changing table in the room also. He had plans for this room, his little princesses room. It was going to outstanding.
“Yes, now unlock the door,” Cas handed over the keys and Dean shankingly unlocked the door, on the third try. They entered in to the kitchen, and Dean flipped on the light switch, flooding the room  with light from the fixture that hung over the picnic style mahogany table.
Cas knew that after today, this that they had was over. They would never be allow to be out in the public together. He was terrified, he knew that he couldn’t keep Dean, that loving him wasn’t enough, that the invalid claim on his shoulder was just that, invalid. He was gonna lose him.
“Miss Mosley,” Lisa said getting the nurse’s attention, “can I talk to you in the hallway, please?” The nurse nodded and followed the teacher out in the hallway, “I wanted to tell you he isn’t some random guy, he is her omega father. She just doesn’t know yet.”
“Yeah, I was thinking about it,” Dean moved before Cas could grasp the movement, muscular arms wrapped around Cas waist and pulled him close to Dean’s chest. Cas embraced the hug and buried his face right where he wanted to, in the crook of Dean’s neck, scenting him. He still smelled so sweet, so amazing. “Good night, Cas,” Dean whispered. Dean let go and Cas followed, dropping his arms back to his side.
Dean sat up on the couch and turned to look at Cas, “You met Dr. Sexy?” Dean seemed a little star struck at that moment.
Michael reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. He just held it and looked at it for a moment before saying anything, “I never meant to be like him,” he paused and looked out across the Winchester’s front lawn and across the paved highway, “like my father.”
Dean looked so happy, resolved. The pain of losing of Cas seemed to faded some at the news of the baby, “You have to tell Sam too.”
Andrea came back and brought them out their drinks, sitting them down in front of the right person, “She’s adorable,” Andrea said as she sat Dean’s drink in front of him. “So do you know what I can get you guys?” she asked looking at the family but stopping on Benny.
Cas handed Dean his phone, “So that white coat covers up alot, huh?” Dean laughed as he handed the phone back “I don't think I will ever be able to watch this show the same way again.”
“Well,” Cas said soft blue eyes looking at Dean, “you do have your own bed here.” Dean smiled at Cas, “It should be more comfortable than this old couch.” Cas stood up, “I’ll go get you something to sleep in.” He walked toward the hallway before stopping to look back at Dean, who had just leaned back against the couch, stretching out, “You might want to call Mary, if your gonna stay,”
After sharing their stories, the car was engulfed in silence again. Cas looked out the window watching the scenery blend together. It wasn't too long before they pulled into Lawrence. "I can get home from here," Cas said as Bobby pulled the car over to the shoulder, "Thank you sir." He said shaking the man's hand before he climbed out.
“He was,” Mary said feeding Gracie a spoonful of mashed sweet potatoes, “He came into the kitchen before he left.” She turned to look at Dean; it was not a very nice look. “I told you to be nice to him.”
Dean sighed, and then chuckled, “You could be one hundred percent my brother and I’d still fill this way. I’ve tried to hide it, to deny it but whatever is between us is something that I’m done fighting.”
“We need to get her to the nurse, Cas, can you carry her?” Lisa asked looking at her student. Her arm was bleeding, Lisa had never seen Emmy cry like this before. She watched as Cas swopped Emmy up in his arms, trying to calm his daughter.
“Benny, it’s Bobby. Dean’s real bad. He's having contractions and I can't get him to calm down. He’s on the verge of a panic attack.”
Cas opened the door and walked out onto the porch pulling the door to behind him. Emmy was smiling and waving from her booster seat in the back set of the impala.
It wasn't perfect, it was barely even ok, but there in that room with Gracie asleep in her crib and Cas’ arms wrapped snugly around him, Dean felt content. It was a kind of contentment that he hadn't felt in a long time.
Cas stepped back into Deans space, “And, I faced you,” he smiled softly, before leaning in and stealing a kiss. It was soft and quick. Cas moved back leaving the both with smiles. “I’ve wanted to do that since before you started picking on me.” A horn honked outside and Cas laughed lightly, “Thats Anna, if I don’t go, she might break in the door.” Cas started back toward the door and pulled it open.
They were both so focused on each other that they didn't feel the rain until the first big boom shook the trees and light flashed in the sky. “Shit,” Dean jumped up before they both started gathering up the stuff off the trampoline before rushing to the door.
Dean was in school the next day, full of life, smiling and laughing. He was looking for Crowley wanted to thank him for his help, but he couldn’t find the short scottish kid. He grabbed a few books from his locker and headed to his homeroom class, arriving a little later than he usually did, so most of the desk were already taken. Cas was already in his desk, he looked like he had gotten the hell beat out him. Dean hoped Michael hadn’t done that, but he knew Michael wouldn’t leave visible marks, he never did.
“Yes sir,” he gasped as a hand closed around his throat, “J-John… sir… p-punched me.” His father released his grip just enough for Cas to breath and tell him why he was that close to a Winchester again. “I was just walking by. He was outside and saw me. I’m sorry sir.”
Dean looked over at Cas, who was still looking at him, “You okay?” he seemed to be lost in thought or something.
The nurse barely looked up, “I need to see some ID,” she snapped. Dean dug in his back pocket for his wallet, damn it he didn’t have time for this. He needed to see her. He handed his licence to the nurse. She typed something on her computer and a snapped a picture of him before printing him off a badge and telling him how to get to the room that Emmy’s in. The only thing keeping him calm during this was a single thought that Cas is with Emmy.
“Six months, Cassie, only six months.” They walked outside together, “Can I stay on the porch?” Dean asked looking around at the wrap around porch.
Mary had set the food on the table while they were getting John and Grace seated. Everything looked great. He kinda wished that Cas was here with them. There seemed like a part of his family was missing.
Cas may have felt his eyes watering, when Dean simply elbowed Gordon in the side and said, “Everyone wants me, dude.” Cas dropped his gaze to his desk and tried not to pay attention as the class erupted in laughter around him.
He took over Bobby’s garage a few years ago when an accident left the man in a wheelchair, but how exciting was that, being the co owner of the town's only car shop? He didn't go off to college like most in his class did; he stayed at home and worked two jobs, saving moving to make sure that Sammy could go to college.
She opened her eyes and looked up at Dean. She was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. She had Cas’s bright blue eyes and bit of hair she did have was dark. She looked just like Cas. “Hey Gracey,” he said softly looking down into those sweet blue eyes. “I’m gonna love you forever,” he kissed her sweetly on her forehead and just held the baby close.
They all walked out the door together, Dean and Cas said brief goodbyes to Sam before helping Emmy into the pink booster seat in the back seat of the impala.
“I got it, Dad,” Dean said walking by with the cooler, sitting it down on the porch. He open the door and looked back out at the impala. He wouldn’t mind staying out here, he thought to himself, away from everything, just him and Gracie. He could see fixing it up and sitting on the front porch in rocking chair with Gracie, looking out into the trees, just listening to sounds around him.
Castiel knew that he had no right to care about the boy anymore but he wanted so bad to walk over to the house and go to his Dean. the omegas at school were nothing. He only wanted Dean, only his Dean, but he knew he couldn’t, not anymore. Never again. It was times like this that Cas hated his family. His fucking family and all the shit that came along with being a Di’Angalo. He hated all of this. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he didn’t notice John move from his porch until the alpha was standing a few feet infront of him, baring his teeth, eyes glowing red and anger rolling off the man.
Dean looked for Cas over the next few weeks but the omega was gone. He had left school. His house was empty and locked up tight. He searched around the house and town looking for any info on his omega. Nobody knew anything, well nobody but Old Man Rufus, the Novak’s caretaker, and well he threatened Dean with a shotgun, that if he didn’t leave the property within the next two seconds his body would never be found. Needless to say Dean ran like a hellhound was chasing him.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean got up from the table and walked upstairs to his room, promptly flopping down on his bed, staring at the ceiling. A smile gracing his lips until he slipped off to sleep.
Cas was standing outside the lunchroom leaned back against the red bricks. On the outside he looked like he did everyday, but inside he was dying slowly and painfully. Maggie, a pretty omega freshman, had plastered herself by his side today. He wasn’t sure why the omegas in school still wanted anything to do with him. He has a horrible rep since he presented. He used them to get what he needed and he’s only felt bad about it once. That was with Sammy, the sad look on those light green eyes as he left the bathroom stall, Dean being there didn’t help any. He’ll never forget that look, either of those looks.
“Listen here, John Michael Winchester, tell your little beta bitch that you have to leave. Your family needs you. Dean needs you. He needs an alpha and if your don’t come, I’m calling Bobby, which I might do any way,” she paused and took a deep breath before adding, “Come. Home. Now,” she punctuated each word before hanging up the phone.
“Oh,” Mary said, moving around Sam and grabbing the dish, “this is for you,” She handed the dish to Dean and gave him a hug, “love you, Dean.”
“Thank you,” Cas said sitting in the matching recliner.  He watched as Dean maneuvered the stroller to where they could both see Gracie. Cas smiled down at his daughter's bright blue eyes as they took in everything around her.
“I was staying at the house and your grandfather wanted then both to go away but Luke wouldn't back down. He wanted his son taken care of.”
“Gabe?” Dean was shocked to see him here. Emmy’s birthday had done past along with any holidays between January and August. Maybe he just randomly wanted to surprise Emmy.
John Winchester was a man of many wonders. He was a older Alpha that had the brute strength of a lion and the cunning of a wolf. He was a true Alpha. Brawn and muscles.  He was not someone you wanted to mess with, which is why he had the perfect job. He worked as the town’s sheriff and had the lowest crime rate the town had seen since 1905. Most say it’s because John puts the fear of god into every soul he has ever come in contact with. But under all that there was a big teddy bear that loved his family unconditionally and was 100 percent controlled by his omega.
Dean's eyes flicked over to him only momentarily, only to see to Cas flirting with ‘Drea. Cas liked her and all, not enough to mate her but enough to convince his father, and her’s for that matter that, he was serious about this. He didn’t like her father anymore than his own and he was sure that she didn't either, but neither was in a place to do much about it, so they dealt. Cas had his devices, most of which consisted of drugs and ‘Drea worked at the dinner as much as Ellen would let her.
Dean was halfway through his last slice of pizza when the baby monitor started making noisy. Gracie was waking up and was probably getting hungry. Dean sat the slice down and moved to get up.
Sam was what he was proud of. Dean might not have made it big, but Sammy was going to. He had gotten a full ride to Stanford and Dean made sure that his little brother had everything that he needed. Dean lived with Bobby until Lisa said she was pregnant three years ago and Dean stepped up, getting a home for him, Lisa and what he thought was their baby. He even married her before Ben was born.
Getting dressed for school every morning had become sorta a game of chance on whether he would be matching when he walked out of his closet. There wasn’t a light in the closest, and he couldn’t turn on the bedroom light, so he got dressed in the dark, pulling a shirt of the hanger and grabbing a pair of jeans from a cubby. He got dressed then pulled a pair of shoes off the floor and walk out the closet and the room.
I want to try to explain Cas's thinking. I know IRL that this would never happen. What happened to Cas is not something that can just be gotten over, and he may never be over it but at the same time He and Dean have a bond that cant be broken, a true bond now that Dean also has a claim from Cas. There's conflict inside of Cas. Fear and longing, its not something that can be dealt with easy and I don't feel like I have given Cas time to work throw things. It took entirely to long to figure out how i wanted it to happen and there will be more until I feel like the ending I have wrote fits the story.
Dean didn't say a word as he watched the scene unfold before him. Cas was so good with Emmy. This is where he belonged, right here in this house, where Dean and Emmy could spend every day with him. This is what they needed, they needed him.
He looked into the open doorway, he could clearly see the check-in desk and a handful of people waiting but none of them were the Winchesters. So he took a deep breath and walk in, up to the desk. A middle aged lady looked up from a stack of papers, “How can I help you, Sir?” She asked, her sweet southern voice easy to hear and claimed his alpha almost at once.
Lunch was, well lunch was just as bad as it usually was. He was standing in line to get his lunch when things got bad. He jumped when someone tapped him on the shoulder, “Hey pretty,” he knew the face but he had never spoken to it once in four years. He’s the blond guy that sat behind Cas in English. Cas just knew that nothing good was going to come from this interaction.
He handed Cas the remote once it was over and Cas looked through the guide before pulling up the DVR and turning on Star Wars.
Dean made his way upstairs. He paused before pushing open his door. He stopped mid-step as his eyes fell to his bed. On his bed lay Cas, and on Cas lay Gracie, both sound asleep. Dean pulled out his phone a snapped a few picture from different angles as he walked up to the bed.
“William. He said that only girls and omegas can have babies.” Emmy was quiet for a moment. She just looked at Dean, like she was trying to see into his soul. “Where is my mommy or omega?”
“Mom,” Dean croaked out his voice barely above a whisper. Dean wasn’t sure how his mom heard him but she almost jumped up from the chair she was sitting in.
Dean chuckled lightly before walking down the hallway to the left of the stairs. There was a small cupboard under the stair, that held the extra blankets and sheets. Dean opened the white door and grabbed a quilt.
Cas walked inside and sat back on the couch. John and Mary had disappeared to somewhere in the house. He pulled out his phone and started looking for apartments.
“I fixed you a plate last night,” Cas followed Dean’s gaze to the plate in his lap, “and you didn't eat it.”
“You won’t, Alpha,” Cas was holding Dean by the shoulders now, trying to pull him on top of him, “please, it's been so long. Fuck me, please, Alpha.”
“You don't have too, Dean. I never should have agreed to stay here any way. I knew you wouldn't be comfortable with me being here but I wanted to be around you so bad that it didn't matter.”
“I’m in Georgia, so it’ll take about a day to get there. I’ll be there as soon as I can. I’ll have my phone, please, if anything happens call me.”
He walked down the hall and  pushed open doors as he went the bathroom door first, then a small bedroom,only housing a twin bed and a small dresser. The next door led to a larger bedroom. He pushed open the door and stood in the doorway for a moment looking around the room. He had spent a few nights in here with Mary, in the queen bed that took up a good portion of the room. The bed was pushed against the wall in the corner and against the opposite wall was a long dresser.
Dean walked back into the room holding a glass of ice tea and a fork. He sat them down in front of Cas and moved behind his chair. Cas wasn't sure if he imagined the soft “eat” muttered next to his ear or the barest touch of lips on his temple but he did as Dean had said to and he ate.
Cas felt his face pale he knew that John was serious. “Yes, sir,” he said as the door opened. Dean, holding Grace, and Sam stepped inside.
“I went after you when you left that night but I couldn't find you. I spent weeks working up the courage to tell you how I felt but by the time I did you were with Jo.
“Umm, yeah, Dean,” Sam paused looking at Dean, “I usually don't go around scenting omega’s they tend to find it offencive and kinda creepy, maybe you should work on that.”
He pulled open the large heavy wood door and walked inside. He stood at the threshold for a moment before heading to the stairs that led to the west wing. His wing. He made it up the first flight of stairs before he was shoved into the wall by a rough hand, “You smell like a Winchester, boy,” his father growled.
His hands shook as he watched himself caress the mark. Dean would have a scar just like this in a few months. He had claimed Dean, without his consent. What a pair they were.
She pulled back the flaps more pink paper filled her view. Her smile grew as she began to pull paper out. The first gift she found was a stuffed blonde bear in a pink tutu outfit. Her eyes lit up and she squeezed it tight before sitting down on the table.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked his mom. He hadn’t really been paying attention to them all that much while they talked. His mom and Bobby had been babbling about the science behind what was going on with Dean, like science could actually explain the animalist side of each person, or how they presented. It wasn’t science it was nature.
Just wanted to add that most of this story will be in Deans POV, which is why the chapter begins with the phone call and not Cas being pregnant. I hope I didnt make anyone mad about skipping that nine months.
Dean had changed into loose fitting pajama pants, an old t shirt, and had shed his shoes somewhere. He flopped unceremoniously on the couch.
“I have to go get the burgers on the grill, you wanna go inside and play with Uncle Gabe and Lisa and Ben and maybe Uncle Sam will let you ride on his back,”  he rose off the swing and Emmy followed.
The ride to the office was uneventful, but filled with giggles and laughs. Cas looked over at Dean and watched him for a few seconds. He seemed relaxed, and happy. He was singing along with Emmy to the tape that he had playing in the radio. And not for the first time did Cas think about how much he had missed out of his daughters life, how many rides like this, how many doctor appointments, how many smiles and laughs.
Cas sat up, looked over at Dean, and he let his eyes fall to the mark on his neck. It was already almost healed, just faint teeth marks left.
Dean unbuttons his pants and slid the down and tosses them on the floor. He got up and walked over to get a small plastic bottle out of the pocket his leather jacket. He stands at the foot of the bed looking at the angel, his angel, spread out before him.
“What do you want Crowley?” Castiel asked without looking away from the mirror. Crowley was standing behind him before he even got done with the sentence. He noticed how sad the boys reflection looked in the mirror, but it was nothing compared to the devastated looked that shown on Dean’s face yesterday in the other bathroom.
Cas held Emmy, who was still crying terribly into his chest close to him. She was hurting and Cas was terrified, “Shhh, Baby Girl, it’s gonna be ok,” Cas said trying to sooth his daughter. it was in that moment that he decided that he wanted to know her, for her to know him. “My name’s Cas by the way,” he said still in the same soothing voice, “I don’t think I told you that the last time we meet. It’s gonna be okay, we are gonna get you to the nurse in just a minute.” He followed Lisa through a set of double doors, into a small hallway and knocked on the first door.
The nurse nodded. she knew Dean, had for a long time. She remembers the day that Mary, God rest her soul, called her and told her to come meet her new granddaughter. They walked back into the room to see Emmy still clinging to Cas, who was softly humming a tune.  Lisa smiled and took a quick picture. “Alright,” the nurse began rolling her stool in front of Cas, “let’s see your arm, Dear.” She lightly held Emmy’s right arm to examine it, “It looks broken, Lisa can you call Dean, while I call for an ambulance and clean up the cut.” Mosley rolled over to her desk and grabbed her phone to call for an ambulance.
When he comes home, he stays in room, mostly. Dean’s hardly ever home anymore, but Sam and John reminded him so much of Dean that he stayed away from them too. Naomi only lets the both of them miss one family dinner a week. She had told them that after they both started coming up with reason to not be there. She sat them both down after school at the end of the week told them, that she didn’t cook for nobody to eat and that they better show up for the next one.
The heat was fading and Cas knew it was almost over. Dean would be going home in a little while. Cas didn't want to let him go again. Dean had been a comfort over a very short time period. Cas no longer saw flashbacks of that day when he sat with Dean. The scent of his alpha no longer made him want to barf.
“You can sit up front with Daddy,” Emmy said sliding in the middle of the bench seat and buckling up. Cas followed Emmy’s instructions and opened the passenger's side door and slid into the car. He had almost forgot the beauty of the car, but Dean still kept her in perfect condition. He lovingly rubbed his hands over her dashboard before settling into the leather seats. He heard Dean chuckle  beside him, “I missed her,” he mumbled.
“You were family,” John spat him, punching the young alpha in the stomach. “He loves you and you are killing him. He’s dying and it’s all your fault. You no good waste of space.”
“Well,” Dean sighed, shifting Gracie in his arms, as the walked into the house, “So the couch sleeps well. Mom won't say anything for now. I’ll bring you some blankets after I lay Gracie down.”
Both of the boys groaned, but said nothing. Since that night they have figured out a pattern. Cas never went to dinner on Tuesdays and Dean stays out most of Fridays, including dinner. It was two days that they didn’t have to spend that hour together.
Hey guys! So sorry if an added chapter kept appearing and disappearing. I was trying to figure out how to add pictures and I think I figured it out but please tell me if this doesn't work.
“Bobby,” Benny hollered for the older man. “Something's wrong with Dean,” he said as the beta bust thru the door. Benny threw back the covers to reveal the blood.
It wasn’t until Dean shifted something that he was holding in his arms that Cas’s focused moved from Dean’s back to his shoulder, where a little face lay looking at him with blue eyes. Cas just looked back at the baby. The baby was wearing a soft blue hat, a boy maybe. Why was Dean holding a baby, was the first thing that popped into Cas’s head. Maybe it’s the alpha’s, he thought still looking at the child, Dean had always wanted kids, so maybe he found a way to get an alpha and a baby.
Bobby had a few guys working for him. An Omega, Garth, who Dean thought wasn’t the brightest crayon in the box but after a few later Dean would admit that the omega had grown on him. A beta, Ash, Bobby had him working on most of the new cars that came in that needed work done that involved the computer. Bobby would work on new cars at all if he didn't need the money, he hated that damn thing. And an alpha, Benny, Dean didn't trust him at first but now Dean adored the big the bear.
They were quite for a few minutes, “So you really did make it big, huh? Famous friends, and I’m  guessing a famous ex.”
Cas smiled and raised his hand so she could reach him. She squealed and wrapped her hand around a finger. A small laugh escaped Cas’s lips when she squealed, Cas found himself falling head over heels for this little girl. He decided right then, with his daughter’s hand wrapped around his finger, that he was gonna fix this. He was gonna bring his family back together. The hell with Michael and any other alpha that stepped in his way. He would figure out how to be the alpha that Dean and Gracie needed.
Tammy tried to get Cas interested in her but often found himself looking in the rearview mirror at  Dean, “Oh,” Tammy whispered, “You like to watch huh?” Cas felt something snap inside him. He wasn’t watching them, he was watching Dean. Why was this random beta more than he was. Why wouldn't Dean hold him like that, wrap his arms around Cas and pull him close to him and suck marks on his neck or gently push him down against the leather seats and press his lips against Cas’s. Cas groaned as Tammy kissed his neck, Dean’s eyes opened and looked in the mirror catching Cas’s eyes on him. They looked at each other for a few minutes before Dean looks back at Suzy. It was at that moment when their eyes meet that he knew that he wanted something from Dean that he couldn’t have.
Dean places his hand on Cas's chin and pulled his face up to look at Dean. Dean sat there for minute taking in the beautiful face looking back at him. He caught the gaze of the deep blue eyes.
“Oh, um, no I’ll go down with y’all. I didn’t mean to fall asleep up here,” Cas got up and stretched.
On the stage sat a large mahogany grand piano. A single spot light lite up the stage, a part of the stage. Behind the piano sat a man, all Dean could see was his profile, a sharp chin, a straight nose. Long, thin fingers dancing over the keys.
Cas maneuvered to get under the blankets, it was May, but there was a slight chill in the air, he guessed that’s why Dean had brought out the blankets. The last time they did it they just had sheets. “What’s that?” Cas asked, holding the blanket open for Dean to join him.
He had married Lisa, just like everyone thought he would and they had son, or well she had son. He had just recently found out that the boy he had raise since the day he was born wasn't his biological son. Lisa had taken Ben and moved to her mother's. They were in the middle of a divorce.
He sat on the bottom step of the stairs leading out of the gym. Tonight had not been the best night for him. Hell, he wasn't even sure why he came to this damn event. High school was a great time for him, but it was something that he had left behind years ago. He missed it sometimes, the freedom of not having to much to worry about everything, his whole life in front of him, Benny by his side, Lisa in his bed.
“Alright,” the doctor smiles, “ the nurse will be back in a minute to take her to the cast and then once all the paperwork is done y’all will be free to go.” They shook hands again and he patted Emmys leg before walking out of the room.
"Don't… stop" Cas gasps through the pain. His hands gripping tight to the sheet as Dean pushes his shaft the rest of the way in, stopping when he is fully sheathed.
Cas knew that they were already texting Michael to let him know that Dean was back. Nobody but family knew why Dean left. There were rumors, none of which Cas actually believed other than he was sick and went to live with Bobby until he was better.
“Pizza’s good,” Dean said pulling Gracie’s diaper bag out to check the amount of formula he had left for her. The can was half full so that would last for while they were over here. Dean sighed watching as Cas order a few pizzas for them. Dean knew that he and Cas had to talk, that they had to figure out something with Grace. She needed Cas just as much as she needed Dean and he knew that he couldn’t continue to keep them apart.
It was hard for Dean, in school. It seemed like every week Cas was throwing a new omega in his face. April Kelly lasted a week. Hannah Martin lasted for a week and a half, until she found Cas in the janitor's closet with Tessa Evans, who was replaced a few days later by Anna Milton. Anna was gone after two days.
Mary answered her first, wanting a chicken caesar salad; Sam ordered the same thing. Dean wanted a double bacon cheeseburger with cheese fries and a slice of apple pie. Benny sat quietly, just watching Andrea, “I’ll have the same,” he said watching as Andrea wrote out their order. Their eyes would meet every few second, a small smile spreading across her lips.
Cas was awake when Dean slowly looked up. Cas wasn’t looking at him, but down where his hand lay just inches from Dean’s. His fingers twitched, aching to hold that hand again, but he didn’t. He wouldn’t. He waited for Cas to say something, anything. The silence surrounded them, the only sound was the peeping from the machines, echoing around the room.
Before Dean knew it, it had been six weeks since that night. Dean was struggling. It wasn't just Cas and his parade of Omegas but it was something in Dean. He was sleeping more and he always felt tired. He was barely eating and when he did eat, it usually came back up. He was sick and no one knew why.
He walked over to impala and fired her up, pausing only a moment before pulling out of the motel parking lot, driving back the way they had came.
Mary sighed on the other end the phone, “ I’m stuck at work. Can you take him home, Fergus? I know its alot to ask but John is still out of town for another few days. I would usually ask Cas but well I'm sure everyone knows by now that ain't gonna happen. Please”
Everything was great until he walked in on her and some fucking blond guy. They were fucking in the storage closet that her and Dean usually fool around in. So the hell with her.
Cas's mother watched as her son drove away with Dean Winchester. Cas was 17. She could stop him but only for a few months and he would resent her the whole time. School was done so she let him make his own choices. She knew Dean would never stay with her son and she had tried to tell Cas over and over. But at 17, he thought he knew everything and Cas refused to listen, saying that Dean loved him and wouldn’t hurt him.
“The hobbit,” Dean said not questioning if it was up there or not. Dean knew it was his almost unhealthy want to have any movie that he thought he might enjoy.
“Uncover,” Bobby told him and helped him pull the blankets off him. Under the cover, his shirt was soaked to the skin with sweat, you could see the faint outline of his ribs. “Are you more comfortable with the heavy weight of the comforter on you then without it ?” Dean nodded. “I’m gonna push around on your stomach let me know if anything hurts.”Again Dean nodded.
Cas looked up from his book as the old rusted car passed by. The car was going slower than it should have been. It took Cas a minute to realize that it was Bobby’s old clunker and that Dean was in the passenger seat. He waved slowly at Cas as they passed. Cas smiled and went back to his book.
As Dean stood there scenting the newly outed omega, Cas broke, “Please, Dean, stop,” He managed to  weakly out. He managed to place his hands on Dean’s chest and pushed at him. He tried to bring back the Alpha voice that he had been using but he sounded pathetic, causing Dean to chuckle.
“No, sir,” Sam grumbled, dropping his book with a small thud on the floorboard and climbed out the car. Really all he wanted to do was to climb back in the seat and pick up his book. He was really enjoying it, more than he would fishing with Dean and the old man, but he would do his best. So he stretched out and walked over to where Dean was standing on the porch looking out at the woods.
There are times when he's playing with Emmy or washing up the dishes after supper that he could smell the shame and regret rolling off Dean. He can feel the strain in Dean's arms to keep his hold on Cas light when Cas hugs him. He can feel how almost every move is a well calculated and controlled. He knows that the alpha Dean is now wouldn’t do what the teenage alpha did.
“Ok,” Cas said stepping away from the crib and walking back to the living room. He sat back on the couch with Dean. “Whats up?”
They were again lost in the silence of the room and in each other's eyes, until a few cries brought them back out if the trance they seemed to have fallen into. Dean snapped his attention to Grace and began to work on the straps holding her into the stroller. He lifted her out.
Dean wasn’t sure why Cas was letting him hold him but god it felt like heaven, holding his sweet omega safe in his arms, where he needs to be, where he should have always have been. Where he would have been if Dean had not have been so weak that day. If he had listen to the omega and left him. They wouldn’t have Emmy but he might have Cas. The weight of the omega in his arms felt like it should always be there. Dean removed his arms from Cas giving the omega the space he needed to back away from Dean. It was Dean’s turn to mumble a “Sorry,” before turning around and leaving the room beckoning Cas to follow him.
He gasped as Dean ripped him apart, tearing muscles that clinched him tight. Castiel was sobbing and Dean was relentless, fucking into him at a brutal pace. “Fuck baby boy, you're so tight.” Dean moaned into Castiel’s ear, “I’m your first, ain’t I baby, so tight just for me. All mine,” he said licking up castiel’s neck. Castiel felt Dean’s knot growing filling him up even more. He hurt so bad, it all hurt so bad. Dean was his friend. He should be able to stop himself.
Dean could smell something else also. He had gotten the first whiff of it when he was in the shower. It was something softer than his alpha smell. He just wasn't sure what it was.
It was difficult for two grown men and a five year old to squeeze onto a twin size bed but they managed long enough for Emmy to fall back asleep listening to Dean read Alice in Wonderland, but if truth be told Cas might have fallen asleep before Emmy did.
Mary walked through the door sometime after nine. She didn't want to leave the hospital but the nurses persuaded her. They told her the same things that she has to tell people.
Upstairs Dean sat up straight, unsure of what had woken him until he looked over and noticed that Grace was gone. He rushed out of his room and down the stairs only to find her giggling at her grandfather, while Mary made a bottle.
“What do you want, Bart?” Cas snapped, “and don’t call me that.” Cas looked around and everyone was looking a them, including Dean and his goonies.
Cas sighed, barely listening to what Ion was saying now, knowing that he wouldn't be drawn into the conversation he looked over and noticed that Andrea was still with Dean and Sam, “Looks like the little bitch came back,” Uriel spat looking over at Sam and Dean.
“That's what Michael doesn’t understand, he may have came to my father with this arrangement but I choose it, and I can break it, if I wish,” she said rearranging into a sitting position. She patted the seat beside, and Cas moved from his seat in front of her to beside her. “I choose you because you were different from the rest of your family. You’re sweet and loving, but I could also tell that you belonged to someone else and that worked for me because,” she stopped and looked down at her hands that lay folded in her lap.
“I didn't know I was playing for anyone,” he said not moving from where he was standing by the piano.
John smiled up at Dean, “It's not your fault. None of it is. It would have happened if I had been driving too.” John handed Gracie to Mary and pulled Dean into a hug.
So I have the ending wrote out but I feel like it needs thing between where I left off and the ending and this is one of the things.
“Cas,” Dean said quietly through the door, a small call. “Do you want me to leave?” his voice was still so quiet, just loud enough to get through the door.
So Happy New Years Eve guys!! 2016 is coming and 2015 was a pretty good year for me. I'm thankful for all that's happen to me this year and for all of yall.  I may have started this started this story for me but it's being finished for y'all every comment and kudo is motivation. The ending is close. There is a big time jump from the last chapter. 5 years.

“After I graduated, I came back home. I was here maybe a week when Luke showed up, holding a baby. They were both so unbelievably tiny but Luke said the baby was healthy, that he made sure that Gabe was good.”
Dean  listened as the surgeon explained that they had done everything they could. He told Mary that they had stopped the swelling and bleeding on his brain and the internal bleeding. John’s heart had stopped twice while they were working on him. He was in his own room and under sedation, would be until tomorrow, when the doctors would bring him out and see if he wakes up, hopefully he would.  He told them it would probably be best if they all went home and got some some rest. So they did. Dean told Cas to follow them to the house, that they needed to talk.
Much like in the drama room Cas’ fingers danced over the keys but there was other music being played also, on a CD. The pictures flowed effortlessly with Castiel's music. His voice was rougher and impossibly softer at the same time.
“Sure,” Dean said, looking up at Cas. It had been a long time since they had gotten along this well and he was enjoying it. He had almost forgotten how easy it was with Cas, how good it felt.
Dean’s focus was purely on fucking Castiel into the wall. A few thrust later, his knot had swollen and caught, locked deep inside Castiel. Dean moaned into the omega’s neck and sunk his teeth into the perfect unmarked skin. He applied pressure until a coppery taste hit him tongue. He pulled back and ran his tongue over the fresh mark, cleaning it, almost lovingly.
He took one last picture, bending down and getting both Cas and Gracie’s face in it. The light lite up their faces perfectly. He locked his phone, suck it in his back pocket, before gently laying a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Hey,” whispered. It wasn’t a loud whisper, but it still was enough to stir Cas.
He thought about it alot. He thought about what Dean had done that day. He wanted to be over it. He wanted to push past that day and move on. He wanted to be there for Emmy and a part of him wanted to be there for Dean, a huge part of him. However, at times when he would be at Dean’s playing with Emmy and Dean would walk behind him and all he can think about is the fear and anger he felt that day. He had worked through a lot with Pam, his therapist, and he knew that nothing could change what Dean had done, but he also knew how much Dean was trying to make things ok.
"Cas pushed himself into a sitting position against the wall, he wrapped an arm around his stomach and tried to breath. It was hard, his breaths were shallow and painful. He laid his head back against the bathroom wall. He could feel the warm blood trickling down his face. He was light headed and the white walls seemed to be spinning, “Tisk, tisk, tisk,” Cas looked up and tried to focus on the blurry figure in front of him, “Daddy’s gonna be upset with you, aint he?” Cas knew the voice and scent, it was family, but he couldn’t think of who. “Come on, I’ll help you get home.”
“I’m sorry sir, did you say no that you are not Castiel Novak’s mate. We have you down as his mate. Your Dean Ross Winchester right?” the voice asked, trying to figure this out.
Dean paid extra detail to the pictures of Benny, seeing if Becky was able to get any others than the ones that Dean had sent her and she had. There were a few that Dean had never seen, which was weird because he was in a few of them.
“And you don’t still love me?” Cas asked placing a small kiss on the side of his neck just below Dean’s ear. He felt Dean tense again but Dean didn’t pull away. Cas sighed into his neck and pressed his nose a little more into Dean’s neck, pulling him closer. He let Dean’s scent fill his nostrils. He was getting dizzy, drunk on Dean. It had been too long since he had had Dean in his arms, able to smell the thick leather and spice, breathing in again he could tell something had changed there was less smell and something different, apples, fresh and crisp. Grace.
Dean relaxed in the passenger seat. He would miss his life here, but he knew that this was best. He tried at school, but after the final rejection outside the lunchroom, he couldn’t do it anymore. He hoped that Crowley would show up, so he would have someone by his side, but at the end of the week there was still no sign of him. There was a rumor going around that he beat the shit out of cas and Michael, or Cas, got rid of him. Dean really didn’t want to believe that but he knew it was possible.
Unbeta'ed all mistakes are my own. If any are to bad please let me I try to catch what I can but I'm sure some slip by.
“I could drive you home,” Cas offered voice low and soft almost like he was talking to a wounded animal.
Emmy begged for Cas to come back home with them and, God how did Cas want to, but he had made a deal with Gabe to cook tonight, so instead he invited them for supper. Emmy agreed before Dean could even blink.
It only took a moment for him to answer the omega back, “I’m looking the Winchester’s, John and Dean, father and son, brought in about an hour ago, they were in a bad car wreck.”
Grace started wiggling in her bed, opened her big owlish blue eyes and started to whimper, it was a small heart breaking sound that grew into a wail in about 30 seconds. Dean lifted the small child out of her bed and held her closely for a few minutes, before walking to the bed and laying the baby down. She started to whimper again and Dean knew he had about a minute to change her diaper before the crying began. He rushed to get her changed and she started screaming just before he was finished. He was snapping her sleeper back up, when there was a soft knock on his door, and Benny stepped in.
Mary spoke first, “You truly are welcomed at the house, Cas. Dean agreed also. If you want, that is.”
“I’ll race you!” She screamed and they took off toward the house. Dean started to jogged but Emmy reached the house long before he did. She started jumping up and down singing, “I beat you! I beat you!”
Cas watched as Dean came and submitted once again, without truly realizing what he was doing his face was buried in Dean’s neck. Gently he brushed his teeth across the smooth skin, Dean flinched but made no move to stop Cas. Cas thrust only a few more time, but that's not where his focus, he wanted something more buried in Dean. He wanted to sink his teeth into  Dean’s neck and claim him.
John was standing on the front porch, it was freezing but he needed space. Mary was right, as always. Things with Kate had gone on for too far. He knew what he had to do. He would never give up his family or his omega. He had a phone call to make. He was about to push the send button when something caught his eye, someone was standing maybe a block down, looking in his direction. He shoved his phone in the pocket of his blue jeans and started walking toward the person.
In the moments where he could think straight, he felt himself falling for the man he had always hoped his beautiful green eyes alpha would be.
Sam’s alarm went off bright and early. A new day. Dean climbed out of bed and went to pee. He really had to pee. Next he walked into his room and woke up the snoring twelve year old tangled in Dean’s blanket and spread out like a starfish on Dean’s bed. “Sammy,” he sang, “oh Sammy. It’s time to wake up.”
Sam sat in the living room waiting on Dean to return with Cas. This was about to be the first time the nineteen year old alpha had seen the omega since before that day, that's what everybody thought of that day as that day, the day that everything began to change. Sam looked up as Cas almost cowered behind Dean. Gabe had said once that most alpha scared and intimidated Cas, so why didn’t Dean? Why was Cas almost hiding behind Dean for protection from Sam? Was he scared of Sam or just scared? “Hey Cas,” Sam said trying to sound sweet, bringing out his ‘lawyer voice’ or at least that’s what his family call it. It’s the low, sweet sound he gets when he’s trying to convince someone of something or to do something they kinda don’t want to. It’s half of the reason he wants to become a lawyer.
“Come eat, please,” Dean said again. Cas watched him move away from the bottom of the stairs and toward the kitchen.
“Ok,” Cas breathed out a small sigh of relief. He couldn’t express how happy he was that Dean rejected that last idea. He had to suggest it but that didn’t mean he wanted it. He knew that he couldn’t have what he wanted; he wanted them both here with him all the time, “umm, you can take a pillow or a dirty shirt or something that smells like me.”
“Okay, baby girl,” Dean moved beside Cas sitting as close as he could, they were touching from the waist down. Emmy sat in Cas’ lap with her feet thrown over Dean’s. Dean may have tossed an arm around Cas’ back and let it rest on his shoulder but hey Cas didn't say anything so Dean wasn't gonna say anything.
“Stand up, Dean,” Cas said, a small touch of demand behind the gentle words. Dean tried, twice, to push himself up off the concrete steps, but he didn't seem to be able to Cas. Cas dropped the keys into his pocket and held out his hand for support to helped Dean up off the steps. “I'm not gonna let you drive home when you can barely stand up. I can go get Ash to drive you home.”
Dean smiled and turned around to see a small shaggy headed man being dwarfed by his little gigantic brother. Emmy ran up to her uncle and jump on him. “Hey sweetie,” he said, lifting her up and wrapping his arms around her. “I’ve got you something special for you,” he reached into his pocket and pulled out a brown tootsie pop.
Dean walked over to the fridge, opened it and stood there looking into the lighted space, silently debating if he wanted another beer or if a bottle of water would be better, he has spent so much of the past months drunk that he wasn’t sure he remembered much else. He listened to the better side of his brain and grabbed a bottle of water, turning around to offer Cas one, “Do you want one?” he asked, pulling Cas out of whatever trance he seemed to be in.
Sometimes when he’s alone and it’s late he’ll wonder about Cas. If he’ll ever find out about her. If he’ll ever love her, or them. If they will ever be together again. When things get bad and he needs someone to cry to or just a friend he calls Benny. He loves Benny, he really does.
After he had laid Gracie in her bed he grabbed a throw off of his bed in the room across the hall. He walked back the living room to find that Dean had laid down all the way down on the couch. Cas smiled while throwing the blanket over him. He walked into the kitchen and decided to fix some lunch while Dean was asleep.
“That, I’m afraid, is up to your alpha, not the staff. I’m gonna check you, make sure everything seems fine,” she seen Castiel’s body tense as she went to remove the blanket of him. She stopped short and looked at the omega’s mate, “Perhaps, this would be easier for him if you leave. I can’t make you but it is a suggestion I strongly advise you take.”
“‘Bout six weeks since the claim. Schools been in for a month and it was at the beginning of break” Mary said, looking down at the table. She knew she should have told John before now but she was scared of how her husband would react when he found out that his big bad alpha son submitted to a Di’Angalo. She looked up at John and saw the rage building behind his eyes.
“Yes, we do,” was Dean’s response, “he doesn’t dictate where I go.” Dean and Sam walked over to a booth and both slid in on opposite sides of each other.
Dean smiled at the nickname, “You’ll have to ask him, babygirl, only he can answer that.” She smiles softly and looked hopeful at Cas, “Hey Cas,” Dean called, “you wanna push her some?” he asked with the same hopeful look that Emmy was sporting.
“I’ll deal with that,” Michael said walking away from Castiel, who fled back to the safety of his room. He knew that he was meant to act like this big tough alpha but his father scared the hell out of him.
“Castiel? Yeah, your friend that left right before y’all graduated. What about him?” Sam asked thinking it was way too early for his brothers shit.
“I know,” Castiel whimpered, holding his face, before turning away and walking home. With each block he passed, the houses got larger and farer apart, until he stopped at large iron gates with a D on both sides. Beside the gate was a little black box that contained a keypad used to open the gates. 3426456 was typed into the pad followed by 104756. The medal gates opened and he walked up the long driveway to the large red brick mansion.
Garth was the first to notice that Dean had gone a whole day without coming into the garage and sent Benny to in to check on him. Dean was 25  weeks pregnant and not and large as he could be but definitely sporting a baby bump. Benny found him snuggled in his bed moaning, seemingly in pain. He was laid curled on his side, his hands were wrapped protectively around his bump and he seemed asleeped.
Cas snorted as Dean took another deep breath, “You’re dangerous,” Cas said opening the stall door and looking into the eyes of his friend. The green was now a thin circle, his pupils completely blown. “You became dangerous the moment you smelt it. The moment you smelt me. There is a reason no one knew what I am. Why everyone thought I was an alpha,” he was almost screaming now. His voice was hard and steely. He was mad, mad at Dean for not leaving, mad at his suppressants for failing, and for the first time he was mad at his body for being an omega. His voice was shaking when he added, “Bad things happen to male omegas here.”
Dean was stiff by the time his knot went down, turns out that a toilet should not be sat on for 30 minutes straight with someone in you lap. “ Cas, I think you can get up now,” Dean tired to keep his voice indifferent, to pretend that hearing his omega claim that he hated him didn’t bother him at all. Castiel didn’t respond, just sat on Dean’s lap crying into his hands. Dean bounced his legs attempting to get Cas to respond.
Dean laughed and followed him at a slower pace, stopping by the kitchen to grab two bottles of water. “I did check the weather,” Dean said laughing as he walked into the room, “there was only like a ten percent chance of rain today and that was earlier.”
Emmy walked in between them as they walked into the doctor office. The appointment took about a hour and a half, and afterwards Emmy had talked Dean into stopping by Dairy queen for ice cream. They sat outside on the warm day, laughing and talking while eating their cones.
“A parent, I think,” Lisa said looking back at the fence, “I’ll be right back, keep an eye on my kids please,” she asked the teacher.
Dean wasted no time sliding back to meet Benny as Benny wrapped his arms around Dean. The trembles stopped soon and Dean drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Something about Benny being there with Dean made everything feel ok again. Dean embraced that. The alpha helped sooth the omega.
Before he could protest Dean flipped him so he was facing the wall he was being violently shoved into it. Dean held Cas in place by holding both arms down at his side. Cas tried to fight against him, to pull his arms free but Dean was too big. Dean dropped to his knees behind Cas, and shoved his face into the dark wet spot on Castiel jeans, right at the back, almost between legs. Cas was driving Dean insane.
Ellen hung around for a few more minutes talking to Mary about how John was doing. Dean shifted Gracie around laying her against his chest, she was facing Cas and as happy as she could be. She started giggling when she noticed that Cas was there. She was stretching and reaching for him, whining and babbling, hitting Dean on his back. She really wanted to get to him.
It was also Sam’s weekend to go to their mom’s. Dean didn’t go anymore. It used to be the best part of the month, then Dean got older, and he realised that main reason he liked going over was for the pie. Then she started dating a guy named Michael and Dean just really didn’t like going over there with him there so he stopped going.
Dean didn't say anything to that. he wasn't really expecting anything to come out of the last few days but he was happily surprised.
He pulled off Dean’s throbbing cock and began to suck at his balls, then moving back to his entrance. Cas swept his tongue across the puckered hole. He could feel Dean shiver below him, “You like that, baby boy?” Cas asked starting to suck at the hole, getting him all nice and wet before he slicked a finger in his mouth and gently pushed inside Dean.
Cas looked up at Dean’s face, “I’ve loved you since we were ten and Michael pushed me down on the playground and even thought he was twice your size you still beat the fuck out of him for me.” Dean chuckled as Cas continued, “Do you remember what you told me, when you helped me up?”
“Dean has more of the alpha attitude and he would have probably present as an alpha if not for Cas. When he submitted like he did, to another alpha and the claim was made, Dean knocked his body out of whack. He probably felt it when it happened, something just changed. What was actually happening was his body released a ton of hormones and everything else that is released when an omega goes into heat but it was only for a short period of time. He was extremely fertile when they were together,” Bobby paused drinking down half his beer, “God this is awkward.”
Dean pulled on a pair of old jeans, with a tear on the left knee, and an old worn t-shirt, with a band name so faded on it you couldn’t read it. He slipped on his old work boots and went the the bathroom to relieve himself and brush his teeth before he made his way down stairs.
Hey y'all so I had mentioned earlier that this A/B/O was different. Dean is different. I hope I did good explaining the not science behind this. If not please let me know and I will try to explain it better for you. Thanks to everyone who commented on here. Y'all are the pushing force behind this story. Love you guys
John spoke up again, “You said you were ok with him being here. Do we need to figure out something else?” he was looking at Dean. John could see the struggle in his son.
Dean laid his new angle back in her bed and crawled back into his bed. Blue eyes and sad words haunted his dreams again.
“Oh your awake baby,” she said rushing to him, still holding Gracey close to her. “She’s perfect,” she handed the baby, who instantly pulled her close to him.
It took a few minutes to get to the kitchen. Dean was sitting at the small dining table sitting off to one side of the average size kitchen. There were four sandwiches sitting on two separate plates, one was sitting in front of Dean and the other in front of the other chair.
“Even when you saw me puking my guts out in the bathroom, you still said nothing. You looked at me and walked away, like I never meant anything to you, like you didn’t care. That is why I’m mad not because of Grace, in all this Grace is the one thing that I gotta say in. I make the decisions that affect her, only me.”
“Hey Cher,” Benny whispered, laying a hand on the omega on the shoulder, only to feel trembles running down the boy's body, “have you been in bed all day?” Dean only nodded his head as an answer. Benny  pulled out his phone and sent Bobby a message telling about Dean and asking him what he needed to do. A few minutes later Bobby told him to see if Dean would let him lay down with him, that his alpha my help with the trembles. “Scoot, Cher,” Benny commanded, pulling the blanket back and slidding in beside the omega.
“Better now,” Cas briefly tightened his hold on Dean before rolling away and stretching, “but I know I’ll feel even better after a shower. You can get one next.”
Cas’ face lit up a bit, “You really going to share Mary’s apple pie with me?” the look on Cas’ face was something Dean couldn’t really explain.
They watched finding Dory mostly in silence, except when the laughs were needed and boy were a lot of laughs called for.
John's words stung as much as the fist that just landed across his face. “You’re poison just like your family.”
He winked at the lady as she batted his shoulder, grinning, “You are too much boy, what are you doing in here so early, I think you're the first student I’ve seen today.”
“I had hoped that by now Cas would come back, but mom, I'm not sure if he is ever gonna love me. I miss him. Sometimes it hurts so much because she is just like him. I know I fuck up I’m not trying to make excuses for what I did.” Dean took in a shaky breath, “She needs him. I need him but he doesn’t need us. I wish you were still here, sometimes I just need your advice, but I understand. Things just got too bad, you just got too sick.” Dean was crying, his head laid in hands sobbing quietly.
“Cas was sick,” she gasped, pushing out of Dean’s arms and running over to Cas, who was standing, awkwardly, by the door. “Are you okay?”
Mary was done feeding Gracie, so Dean walked over to her high chair and scooped her up. “I’m gonna go give her a bath and get her ready for bed.” Dean leaned over to his mother and gave her a kiss on the cheek, “Supper was great. Save me pie, please.”
Dean slept through the night. He hadn't had a full night sleep since before Gracie was born. He woke with a start, looking for Gracie. Last night came rushing back with the strong smell of apples and pancakes. Dean pulled himself out of bed and walked out of the room. He checked the room beside him and saw an empty crib, Cas must have her. He followed the smell and ended up in the kitchen. He didn’t say anything as he entered the room, he just watched. He watched as cas danced around the kitchen with gracie to music playing from his phone. As the song ended cas flipped what  an believed to be a pancake and spun around with gracie.
“I tried to stop it but your grandfather told me if I fought him on this then we would both be homeless, broke, and I wouldn't have a job. So I let him send Gabe away.”
Dean looked over at Cas, “I’m sorry for who I was in high school. We, me and Benny, had talked about you, Garth and Kevin a few times since graduation, believe it or not we did grow up and realise what colossal assholes we were. Benny treated you how he did, because he was afraid of you, afraid that I would leave him. Its funny, he noticed long before I did, after that I would watch you at lunch and when we saw you in the hallway. He was scared that I would try to replace him.”  Dean huffed again, at how ridiculous Benny had been, “Like that could ever happen. He's gone and still holds most of me.”
“Sorry, I was just walking the halls and heard you through the door.” Dean had made it almost to the side of the stage where the piano sat. “That was beautiful,” He added, taking a deep breath and making quick work of the few steps to get on the stage.
“Come on, Castiel, we need to get you cleaned up some before we head out of here.” Ion helped him over to the counter and wet a wad of paper napkins, before dabbing the blood away from Cas’s face.
Above him Cas was whimpering, “please, stop,” it was becoming a chant. But Dean wasn’t listening to the omega, he was focused on ripping Castiel blue jeans down. He popped the button off and completely fucked up the zipper. Once Castiel’s pants and boxers were around his ankles, Dean wanted a taste of the sweetness that was driving him mad. He licked a broad stripe over Castiel’s hole. Moaning, he stood back up and started yanking down his own pants and boxers. His member sprang free, rock hard and leaking.
After the feed and a diaper change Dean and Grace dozed off to sleep. Mary gently lifted Gracie off Dean’s chest and placed her in a small bassinet. She place a kiss on both of their cheeks before walking out of the room, leaving the door slightly cracked.
A movie projector had been set up in the gym and Becky had spent what seemed to be months arranging the pictures that she had collected of everyone to the songs that were playing.
Cas watched until Dean had closed the door behind him, then he closed his door and flopped down on his bed.
Dean took in Cas’s face, his eyes didn’t seem as blue as he remembered them, there were bags under his eyes, and his face seemed to be paler too, but none of that stood out as much as the look on his face. Fear shown through his eyes and his pale pink lips trembled. He  seemed to curl into the bed some. Dean broke the silence, “Hey Cas,” he said softly, just above a whisper, “the doctors need me to be here.” He pulled his hand off the bed and placed it in his lap, “I’ll go. I know you don’t want me here and I don’t want to hurt you anymore. I’m sorry,” the last bit was more a mumble than a whisper. He was about to stand when the door opened and Tessa walked back in.
“Let me help you in,” Dean moved from his laid back position and looked at Cas. He couldn’t understand how Cas could be so nice. Dean wondered if Cas was this nice in high school and how different things could have been had he not been an ass. “I’ll call Anna to come get me after your settled in.”
Blood was oozing out of various places on Castiel’s body and face, “I know,” he gagged around the blood in his mouth. Crowley landed one more good kick before he left the bathroom, then the school.
Dean wanted to punch Cas in the face, “If you don’t put something in me right now, I swear to god, I’m going to flip you over and fuck you, Alpha,” There Dean was submitting again.
Cas looked around the room until his eyes landed on Dean, who was standing in the corner with his back to the glass talking to, from the looks of him, an alpha. A new alpha. Cas had been replaced, but Dean could have anyone why would he chose to be with another alpha, maybe he just had a type. Cas was staring at the back of Dean, well Cas wouldn’t call it staring but Dean would and actually had a few times. It was just one of the things that Dean picked on him about.
Dean chuckled, “yeah, mom’s a stickler about how sweet tea should be made.” Dean smiled over at Cas, “Thanks, I’d love some.”
Lisa smiled brightly at Cas, “Yeah, I’m Emmy’s teacher this year. She’s talked about you a lot since her party. Do you want to come say hi?” She knew that Dean would love to know that Cas was still showing some interest in Emmy. “I know she would like to see you and Dean won't care.”
Dean forced a fake small smile and nodded, “It’s ‘K, Sam. Dad ask tell him I’m in bed, not feeling to good anymore.”
He had thought about it but in the end the uniforms changed his mind. He really hated uniforms, “It was long, stayed at home for most of it. And I thought about it some, but we all can’t pull off that uniform as well as you do,”
The sun began to set behind them before they closed up the house and pack everything back into the impala. They had the fish they caught in an extra cooler in the trunk. They had done good enough for a nice dinner one day. “Wanna drive?” John asked tossing Dean the keys, knowing that Dean would not say no.
Dean just smiled more fondly at Cas. It was nice seeing him setting beside him again, maybe they could do this more often, “We have to stop by Wal-Mart to get her medicine, hope that's ok.”
Dean dropped the hamburger meat on the counter and ran out of the house. He pulled open the front door and looked down the road. He saw him. Dean saw him walking away from his door, headed down the street away from him. Should he follow him? What do you when the last part of your family is walking down the street away from you?
“What do you mean your daughter, Cas? The baby at the dinner, the one that Dean was holding, she kept playing with your hair. She’s your daughter? I thought Dean was the father but if she’s your baby,” she stopped talking and walked over to the bookshelves lining one wall, “Has Dean presented?” she asked changing the subject looking at the names of the thick leather books.
Dean noticed, looking slightly down to see the angry red mess left on Castiel’s neck. The animal side took over again, leaning in to Cas and began cleaning the wound. He licked at the wound until the noise died down and the last of the boys had left the room. The bell rang signaling the next class and Dean and Cas were still locked together sitting in the stall. Cas winced every time more cum was shot into him, silent tears still running down his face.
Back in the living room, sitting in the couch Dean took another swig from the bottle and passed it to Cas, “Your turn,” said turning to face Cas, who was looking at him, “truth or dare?”
Emmy was having so much fun playing. She loved the monkey bars. She played on them at home and when Nana and Daddy took her to the park, now she gets to play on them at school too. She was swinging to the next bar when she saw Miss Lisa talking to the man that she meet on her birthday. He said that she would see him again and he’s here. This is awesome. She moved to grab the next bar and missed. She was scared as she fell to the ground. She screamed out in pain as everyone ran toward her.
Mary left her husband standing in the kitchen and followed Bobby's instructions. After she gave Dean the medicine she went to the kitchen to put the soup back on the stove. John had left the room as Mary turned on the stove, so Mary headed upstairs in search of her youngest son. She found Sam asleep in Dean’s bed. The floor had been cleaned and Sam’s hair was still damp from a shower. The room still smelled slightly of vomit, so she went to the storage closet down the hall, grabbed a can of air freshener and sprayed slightly around the room. She walked out leaving the door cracked and went to check on her soup.
He smiled at one of him and Benny, stretched out on the Impala looking up at the sky not really doing anything, and there was one of them both, still in their football uniforms, helmets raised in the air as they cheered with the rest of the team.
“I'm not gonna do that to you anymore. I'm gonna find an apartment and do what I can to make sure you and our daughter have everything you need or want. I'm going to be the alpha I always wanted to be and not the one my father tried to turn me into.”
Cas sat back on the porch and looked at the picture, it looked like it had been taken from a distance. Michael probably had a private detective following the guy. He wondered what his brother would be like. If Cas would ever get to meet him.
When it came to Cas, she acted no different, “I’m sorry, Mary,” he whispered to her as she pulled him into a hug.
John was still sleeping when they got to the hospital. Mary went to John’s room while the boys and Gracie went back to the waiting room. It seemed like forever before Mary walked in crying, “He’s awake,” she said, smiling with tears still in her eyes.
Emmy was quiet until they reached the movies and Dean picked up Minions. She knew that Cassie was special Daddy never looked at people the way he looked at Cassie and Cassie smelled like Daddy, he smelled like home. Cassie is family. she wasn’t sure how he was family but she knew that she never wanted to be without him again. “Daddy,” Emmy said getting Dean’s attention.
Food, Dean thought, Cas needed food. He was probably getting exhausted and hungry. Dean could fix him food. Dean pushed himself off the floor and stumbled down the stairs to the kitchen. He could do this, this is easy, simple just food, something to eat...  Something that's not Cas, his mind supplied, which did not help at all and caused him to drop the bottle of water he had just pulled out of the small black mini fridge just off of the kitchen in the laundry room. “Fuck,” he said picking it up and moving back into the kitchen.
