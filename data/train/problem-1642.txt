John looked up at his boyfriend with a fond stare. "You know, I never did thank you for saving my life...."
Sherlock sat down on the chair and locked eyes with the red balloon. "However you should know I genetically changed the chemical sequence so it couldn't hurt you, Mrs. Hudson, or Rosie because I truly care for all of you."
John laughed weakly. "Rosie, don't ever think I forget about you, okay? I love you, I love you so much. You're our little family...."
Sherlock sighed. "Yes, yes I do. When I went for an...... experiment around a week or 2 ago, I did see Kat at a drug scene. We exchanged different things and she didn't understand how to use Ketamine and.... John I may have created that drug so it wouldn't affect kids because Kat worked with children in the daycare and if they breathed in the smoke I made it so powerful that even a breathe in would knock them off their feet. So I changed the chemical sequence of it and made it so it was only airborne through mouth to mouth and so I taught Kat.... by smoking Ketamine and giving it to her through, well, the mouth."
John nodded and smiled as he walked out of the door. When John got back to the apartment, Sherlock was sitting on the sofa, his eyes shut and fingers on his temple.
"John I can't stop don't you get it? With this power of making people crumble at my finger tips, oh it's wonderful John! All the people here in my grasp and I could kill any of you, and nobody would know until the police found your body. Wanna know how I kill them John, do you? It's quite simple actually. John you don't realize it but you've been here for two hours. The meeting stared at 5 and it's 7 right now. One more hour and your body will not be able to handle this much of a drug in your body. Overdose is so simple John. But here's the trick. I have hidden antidotes in a pocket of every person here, except for one. All of you go home and when you feel the sudden fiery feeling in your chest as all the oxygen leaves your body and you're begging for mercy, when suddenly you feel something in your pocket. It is the one thing to save you. The person takes it and passes out. They wake up and do not remember a thing and carry on with everything else. It's a cycle John. A cycle of elimination. Natural selection at its finest. Somebody here is not worthy of time or any of its essence and isn't a person worthy for society. Society needs change, John, and it has to be done by people motivated to do so. But then there's others who care more about their job than family. So when they're struggling for breath as they go through a heart attack or their lungs have had enough, they try to find anything to stop it but it's too late. They can't find any medicine and drop dead, oxygen left in their fingers from trying to find that last drop of hope. So, John Watson, let's hope you have your own personal drop of hope left in you, ay?"
Everyone had quieted down and was now staring at the obviously stressful talk between the three of them. Joan was, at this point, showing how desperate she was to keep her disguise, John was looking outright murderous while Sherlock was looking smug but tense.
"The whole thing, everything I thought about for the experiment, what Ketamine does, everything about the case." Sherlock said, waving his hands.
John giggled as he sat down with Rosie still in his baby carrier. "Oh wow. Just when you started playing that piano.... it was brilliant, absolutely brilliant! You made a toy for babies sound magnificent and I'm pretty half the mothers were a tad pissed that Rosie wasn't playing."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled out the recording. "Just listen to this and it will explain it all."
There was a short break where Joan was given water and some crackers while the others got lunch. Sherlock refused to eat and instead shut his eyes and held his hands in a prayer formation as he thought deeply. John watched in amusement as he took a bite of the sandwich he bought.
Greg blushed deeply and cleared his throat. "Um anyways, we asked some witnesses or friends of hers and they admit she would always ask people to walk her home after working her shift from the daycare-"
"Precisely! I don't know why Mrs. Hudson laughed at me! Oh and John took Rosie so I have no idea where they are or anything because John won't pick up his phone!" Sherlock shouted as he paced faster.
"No.... no there can't be- there has to be another potion; she wouldn't make it that obvious." Greg said, his eyebrows stuck in disbelief. "I am not going to just sit here and watch one of you... I can't even say it."
Greg frowned. "An airborne poison? Unless it was in a spray bottle and this mystery murderer was going around spraying people, I doubt it was that."
"Mrs. Hudson, oh thank god." He gasped out, a sneaky tear slipping out of his eye. "It's so nice to hear your voice."
"Oh I love you too Sherlock." Mycroft says bored as he types on his phone earning a strong glare from Sherlock.
Maria laughed again. "Okay anyways so after the meditation, Joan sends us back to our homes and let's us just think you know? And go through our everyday life struggles and usually I pass out and wake up and feel great! Sometimes I wake up and I had broken something from passing out but it's okay because I'm fine afterwards but it's nerve wracking cause I feel deep down that something bad is happening but her organic herbs are just wonderful."
Sherlock again rolled his eyes. "That does not even make sense but with the system these days with police officers, I am not surprised."
Sherlock narrows his eyes again. "I'm not giving up that easily. She started this fire and I'm going to extinguish it."
John turned back to Joan and scratched the back of his neck. "Well, uh, we aren't.. um we aren't really together together but we are together and, uh, we-we are just raising Rosie platonically."
Sherlock sighed and rubbed his forehead. "Maria I know what is happening but I can't do it without-"
Sherlock cut off his sentence as a wave of information smacked his brain causing John to jump into defense mode.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned to speak softly to John. "Why don't you go put her down and I'll rock her to sleep? Rosie, daddy will be there in a moment alright?"
John flinched at the name and sighed. "Sherlock and I had a fight and I said things I didn't mean but at the time I did mean them and he probably hates me and..... god I screwed up." John moaned as he pressed his hands into his eyes.
John frowned and looked at Sherlock. "Remember when we went out to dinner, just the two of us, and Mrs. Hudson was out playing poker so we had to find somebody really fast to watch over Rosie?"
"If she was at the daycare, maybe the poison was attached to her and is now on us but we don't realize it. I looked at a witness report who was a friend of this now dead woman and she also had the feeling she was being stalked for the past couple of days and would ask to be walked home. Now tell me, John, the previous woman who was murdered, what did she say and what was common with her dead body?" Sherlock said, now pacing in circles around John.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond but the door opened with Greg and John leaning against each other. Greg softly helped John sit on his chair with a smile before turning to Mycroft who smirked.
Mycroft nodded along. "Well she knows, most likely, that if she hurts John Watson, Sherlock Holmes will for sure be following in a way of revenge. You're a very possessive boy, Sherlock."
Sherlock looked over and saw John with the look of 'say one more thing and I will personally make you a murder victim.' "Sorry my apologies. This is Rosie Watson."
That was just one of Greg's examples of how he knew deep down John and Sherlock had a relationship that wasn't just 'best friend' material..... but he wasn't complaining cause he got $60 that week. Sure, they would act as they normally would around colleagues and during cases but as soon as they felt nobody looked there would be secret smiles and comments about Rosie.
The woman nodded before coughing. "Wait one more thing.... this John you're saving..... you make sure you protect him.... with everything you have and love him.... because it takes a hell of a man... to take another life for another.... treat him well, boy, treat him like he is a bloody treasure...."
Sherlock quickly released him causing John to recline into his body and smile softly at him. "Wow, my hero."
Sherlock swallowed and this was the first time John saw him nervous. "Well, she asked for more. I told her it's a bad idea but she gave me an offer and I took it. I will not go into the offer so do not ask me. But she took a couple of grams from me and went to work. That's all I know."
Sherlock rubs his thumbs over John's hands, remaining eye contact. "I would kill for you John Watson, normal or not."
The minute John walked into the meeting, something seemed off. Looking around, almost every other chair was not being sat on. Joan was at the front at a single chair facing everybody else. There were machines around the room like ventilation tanks with some sort of air inside of it, floating particles visible there as though something was crushed and put into a vapor form. John carefully sat down close to the back as Joan cleared her throat and smiled at everyone.
As soon as John shut the door, he locked it and sat against the doctor. His breathing became shallow and he pressed his palms against his eyes as he tried to level it out. But anxiety was winning this battle. John felt his heart pounding against his chest, his arms starting to shake, flashes of heat causing him to sweat. Anxiety attacks were not for John. He has handled enough war nightmares to last a lifetime so for it to randomly attack was not his cup of tea (damn British). John looked up at the tile ceiling and let out a sob as he clamped a hand over his mouth and shut his eyes tightly. He didn't even understand what this was about. Was it about his fight with Sherlock? Well he is pissed, was pissed.... oh fuck it he still is pissed but it's Sherlock. And he killed for John. But he didn't want that, he didn't want Sherlock to go and do that for the sake of him. HE is the soldier, HE is the fighter, HE is a killer. Yes he was a doctor but there were some off days. Wiping his face, he quickly grabbed his phone and called up Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock looked up at John and frowned. "Well if we are following the other common symptoms of the lesbian couple that died who both had worked at the daycare, they used Ketamine therefore slowing down any part in their body that would cause all sorts of self defense to be destroyed. Then they were murdered by our mysterious person and left for dead at their home. Everything is in common, the daycare, the feeling of being watched, but now we have Susan who I guarantee was not given any Ketamine from me."
John, as he left the room, missed Sherlock's lingering stare as he bit his lip to not laugh at the ridiculous situation.
John frowned, there's obviously something Sherlock knows and he doesn't. "Sherlock you're not going to do anything rash, are you?"
Mycroft just smiled as his antics and calmly smoked his cigar. "Well she should be arrested for one other thing."
"So he yelled at you, and you called me because you were.... upset." Mycroft said slowly as Sherlock paced back and forth around the apartment.
By the time John and Sherlock got to the scene, all the police officers were chatting and taking pictures of the crime. Greg and Mycroft were talking to one another and to Sherlock's surprise, Mycroft was softly smiling at whatever Greg was saying.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Mycroft with a warning. "No, it doesn't make sense why she suddenly killed two people. She probably was after John, that much has to be true, but I took the antidote from one woman which would mean one death but another woman has died due to the same reason and my question is why she suddenly would not give out antidotes to two people instead of one. She's changing her ways and how she is going about it all."
It's been a couple of weeks since Sherlock and John had been raising Rosie; together. They had a mutual agreement of being her father's and anybody could argue if they were a couple. John, of course, would continue to claim he wasn't gay. Greg and Mycroft had a bet and every time they visited the Baker Street Boys, if they caught them in some sort of intimate moment, Mycroft would slip a 20 into Greg's pocket. For example, Greg had found a particular murder case and needed to tell Sherlock after getting a lot of text messages from him complaining he was bored. But that wasn't what he saw when he opened the door to 221B Baker Street. John was holding Rosie by her arms and was having her walk towards Sherlock who was smiling and cooing at her. Greg nearly dropped his coffee in awe as she grinned at Sherlock and fell into his arms. Then, oh but then, Sherlock LAUGHED. He. Laughed. John was grinning at the two of them and the three all shared a hug as if they were a family.
Mrs. Hudson looked at the three with a knowing smile. "Well aren't you all a sight for sore eyes! Where are you off to now?"
John locked eyes with Sherlock and sighed before pressing play and holding it up to his ear. It was silent except the muted voices from the recording machine as John's face changed in accordance with what was being said. Sherlock was desperately trying to find something to distract him before he did something else stupid but before he could grab something from the shelf, John was letting out a quiet sob. Sherlock turned and John was holding the recorder with it at full volume, locking eyes with Sherlock. Sherlock didn't understand and was about to ask before John, with tears in his eyes, pressed play.
ENOUGH SHERLOCK!" John snapped before muttering about picking up Rosie from Mrs.Hudson leaving Sherlock alone in the room.
"I would love it?" Sherlock spat. "You tried to kill John, I am not going to enjoy something such as that."
Greg sighed and just nodded along before glancing back at the woman. "It's sad though. I mean with all the murders going on I would think they would have a heart for the ones with children. I mean honestly who could be so-"
Sherlock stared at the woman. She used to be married but he ran off leaving her in the care of their child. She stresses constantly and something is on her mind but she isn't sure what it is. She feels in danger but again does not understand what is causing it. Her mind is at battle with herself and the poor woman doesn't understand how she is being tricked.
Sherlock pouted but stood up nonetheless, an obvious tent visible causing John's eyes to widen. "What John? You said we have to go work."
"I SAID STOP." John slammed his fist down on the table and looked up. His eyes were glassy and mouth was trembling. "I..... trusted you. I have you come and raise Rosie with me..... but, oh but then you go... and do drugs EVEN AFTER SEEING HOW IT AFFECTED YOU?!" John screamed the last part. "How dumb can you be, Sherlock? You.... Sherlock do you understand that I can arrest you for being a potential criminal in this? Do you understand you can be taken away for the death of two people? No, I really don't think you understand that." John whispered to himself as he looked up, tears starting to form. "To think that I would TRUST you. You realize, Sherlock, you may have killed me. After that kiss? Airborne Sherlock."
Greg let out a low chuckle and stole a glance over at him. "Well since you owe me $40, I suppose I can let you take me to dinner."
John was at this point sitting down and had his head in his hands. "You mean to tell me, you went to a fucking drug scene, to get wasted on KETAMINE." John took a deep breath. "And proceeded to give it to a woman who was found dead a day later?"
"Oh well thank you but I have to leave." John said suddenly standing up and feeling a wave of confusion as Joan walked up with a smile. "John didn't she explain to you the last rule? You don't leave until I tell you to."
The two made it to a closet where they had their first kiss and yet now it was filled with a lot of steam; no not in that way at all.
John shook his head fondly. "I've waited, let's see, an hour for you to be home? I ordered Indian food but you probably already ate-"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greg, who had been walking around the crime scene with Mycroft, frowned at Sherlock. "Wait a minute you said 'her game.' How do you know it's a woman?"
John felt a warm buzz in the bottom of his stomach at that and fought back a smile. But as he thought about his own lips he thought also about Sherlock. How warm it was, how it felt like a secure blanket and- JOHN. STOP. Standing up quickly, he grabbed the dinners and put them in the stove to warm up. John looked over at Sherlock who was busy hanging up his coat and taking his shoes off.
Mycroft walked out of 221B and watched as Sherlock hailed a cab and took off quickly. Shaking his head at the detective's style, Mycroft walked to the crime scene where Greg was doing paperwork and finishing up with cleaning of the scene.
Susan's smile faded at that as she cleared her cheerful voice. "Well, of course it's been rough! I was good friends with them since they were such lovely people and it's a shame but we have to move on, ya know? Oh and by the way, tell Mrs. Hudson it worked!"
His hand went behind John's body, almost pinning him against the cupboard, earning a nervous gulp from John as he shrunk slightly against the counter. Damnit John, come on! You can't just submit to him like that! John whimpered to himself. But Sherlock wasn't doing anything.... sexual to say. For he removed his arm and had a piece of bacon and he smiled, winked, and took a bite of the food and walked away. John blinked in confusion, arousal, and just a tad of anger because his face was as red as a tomato! There was a awkward cough from the doorway and John saw Greg with a blush going to the tips of his ears as he stared at the floor.
Greg shook his head knowing to one, get $20 from Mycroft and two make sure they don't screw this up.
John's laugh faded slightly. "Yeah... uh sorry about that I didn't mean to draw too much attention."
Joan nodded in sympathy as John felt a tear escape his eye and fall down his face. "He probably never wants to see Rosie and I again, hell I don't deserve to see him again."
"But Sherlock now that you've explained this to me, how will you explain to everyone else? A lot of people think you're dangerous already, they'll most likely arrest you for the murders and I can't let that happen! We need to find who finished the job."
He knew Sherlock wouldn't be home, so John grabbed the phone and dialed a number for an Indian restaurant as the two men quite enjoyed that type of food. Yes, at the moment he was ignoring the fact that Sherlock locked lips with a pining John because he just didn't understand what to do, most likely due to a sexuality crisis but who knows these days. He heard Rosie downstairs giggling as Mrs. Hudson entertained her. It was quite funny, actually, because Mrs. Hudson began to demand to have time with Rosie, even if the two men weren't busy. Checking the clock, the time read out 8 p.m. And it was beginning to be odd that Sherlock wasn't home. A half hour later, John was beginning to put the now cold dinners away when Sherlock barged in through the door.
John continued his army crawl despite his vision adding different colors and his arms becoming slightly numb. "Stop.... plea....se."
Turning around quickly, he saw an average but happy looking woman who was holding pamphlets. "Uh, yes it is. Who are you?"
John nodded tiredly. "Yeah I remember last night I was pissed at you and so I thought going to the meeting  to just escape for a little would be nice because I can only  handle both you and Rosie's crying for a small amount of time. Then I remember you kept telling me not to go and then there was me chasing after you to angrily glowering at you all the way to passing out into your arms because of the ventilation in Joan's room."
"Did you know, he earned $240 in the past week? Absolutely odd how he gets all of it. My guess is he's in some sort of relationship where he gives affection in return for money." Sherlock remarked as he took his socks off, ignoring the growing blush on John's face.
"I'm not following you, Sherlock. You're not the only person who walks around in London." Mycroft says as the two walk in sync next to each other. "Now I know you're dying to talk to me about what's going on."
John just nodded awkwardly while Sherlock, not embarrassed whatsoever, continued to wander his hands. Greg and Mycroft left the room laughing in unison while the two Baker Street Boys sat there, Sherlock straddled on John's lap.
John shook his head and squeezed Sherlock's hands. "I'm not going to be happy if you keep running away. Us together is the safest thing we got. I know that sounds bizarre but we are better together than apart."
John bit back a laugh as he snaked his hands around to cup his ass and pull him so he was flushed against John's chest. "Well then let me show you."
Sherlock turned accusingly towards John with a look of disbelief. "Politely? You nearly ripped my ear off pulling me out of the woman's home. All I said was I thought she had a stalker due to her closed blinds, triple locked doors, and opened rooms to get up and down the stairs quickly. She clearly was in a state of distress. No wonder she was found dead."
"Sorry I'm just, uh... getting ahead of myself." John mumbled as Sherlock just frowned and looked down suddenly noticing that there was an added tension to the ex soldier's pants.
Sherlock just shrugged and put a jacket on. "It wasn't my fault John, if we didn't drop her off she would see a woman dead and you wouldn't want that would you?"
"Meeting...... poisoned..... help John." Sherlock gasped out, falling back and trying to search his jacket.
"I could be asking you the same question. Sherlock what part of leave me alone, didn't you understand?" John asked, a warning tone evident.
Joan rolled her eyes. "Can't be saying that until I have been legally charged. You should know little soldier. But regardless, ever wondered how you woke up? You should be dead."
"Joan..... meeting....... drug.... the others.... have..... antidote..... don't take.... but share....." John croaked out as he held his throat and began to whimper.
"John lower your voice or you're gonna wake up Rosie." Sherlock said taking a sip of tea that Mrs. Hudson brought up.
"Bugger off." Sherlock growled out as he went into the kitchen and poured himself some tea. "What even happened last night?"
Yes yes yes I have been very late with updating yes yes yes I am a terrible person BUT I'm a terrible person with an excuse ayyyyyy! So I'm in Europe lol, and I'm from the US so I'm super excited and it's a lot of fun but as I had a 7 hour flight I decided to write another chapter and boom here's an update! Yes I'm gonna be working on ANOTHER chapter ASAP to make up for how terrible I am but yeah as always please review and favorite as it gives me hope and inspiration to write more and I'll see you in the next chapter!
Right at that moment, Greg had opened the door and only saw Sherlock pointing at a bored Mycroft and shout the words 'I love you.'
John rubbed his forehead. He can't admit that he is growing attracted to Sherlock because that would just end terribly for both their friendship and work business. He couldn't afford that, even if it would cause more pain to him.
Greg looked at Mycroft and pulled on his hand before whispering something causing the older Holmes t walk away. "Well Sherlock, he is a soldier. He has done stuff like that all the time. Hell he killed people for America in general, I highly doubt he would hate you for one person."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock, as he stood up and walked out the door, let a tear fall down his cheek as he heard her last breath be exhaled out.
Greg looked up and cleared his throat. "Well it's another woman and this time it's gotten weirder.... you probably know her, actually. She went by Susan?"
"So.... they finally caught you. How does it feel huh? After all this time, all this work, and all your pity suffering. I would like to know. It's not personal.... it's just a.... NATURAL selection I suppose."
Mycroft frowned and gave Greg another $20. "Can you two knock it off for at least until you get home so I don't continue giving out my money as if Greg is a stripper?"
Joan passed around the piano and Sherlock took extra time grabbing the toy piano from her hands in order to deduce her. Luckily, John took the toy from both of them earning a scowl from Sherlock. The mothers were letting the kids bang annoyingly against the piano which made Sherlock twitch with a tad bit of anger as John and Sherlock took turns playing the piano for Rosie because she had no interest in doing it herself.
Mycroft again rolled his eyes at his brother's antics. "But yet you seem to have no problem when you hug, caress, and even kiss John."
Dear lord I have not updated in forever but hey I am back, back in block dun dun dun. But yeah I wanted to surprise you after3 months with a painful chapter cause why not ;) Anyways I'll try and update again later in the month.
Sherlock quickly picked it up and rummaged through it, looking for some pill bottle or anything close to it. Suddenly he saw a glass jar at the bottom with the words 'drink me.' It had to be the antidote and he had to bring it to John. But that inner human side of him (horribly annoying by the way) was saying John would be beyond angry. But if it was between John being an angry hedgehog and him being a dead hedgehog, Sherlock would rather him be angry at him.
"But that's because they love each other and are married! We AREN'T Sherlock! Or have you forgotten that?' John said, his voice a loud whisper. "We've done this charade for too long. I call us family because we are... but it's not  the same. You don't kill people, normal people don't do that."
The murder scene was almost predictable. The girl was blonde with green eyes, a tattoo sleeve down her arm. She was found on the street 2 blocks away from the daycare. Her left arm was limply draped across her chest, while the right arm was twisted upright by her head.
Sherlock did know he should probably not go but if somebody else invited him to go somewhere then it's only human decency to agree to the terms. So therefore if this little meeting went up in flames, Sherlock couldn't be blamed.... who is he kidding he would be blamed even if he wasn't there. He focused on how to talk to Joan when he gets there but he had no idea where to even start. If he just waltzed in there shouting at her about how she was a killer of more than five women he would most likely be restrained. But if he didn't go and make a fuss then 1. People would wonder if he was the real Sherlock 2. Nobody would know that she tried to kill him. As the car drove in silence, Sherlock kept glancing at John and back at everyone else. What were they thinking? Was John still mad at him? What was their relationship? Despite him being a genius, Sherlock had no idea how to solve this one. The car ride remained silent and soon Sherlock just drifted into thought. Meanwhile, John, who was seated next to him, was thinking about everything going on. Yes the two of them have gone through a lot from being poisoned to now getting dragged away from their semi normal life and into talking to some lady he really wasn't in the mood to see. Besides that, John remembered that the woman they have to talk to, literally tried to kill him and Sherlock. This isn't really in the hypothetical agreement he signed. John shook his head absent mindedly as the car slowed to a stop.
Shaking her head and cuddling Rosie to her chest and sighed. "Your father's are something else, aren't they Rosie?"
"Well you see those ventilators? Usually we put water vapor in them to just add some easy breathing but Joan, being the wonderful woman she is, put her homemade herbs in them!"
There was a rustle against the phone and another coo as Mrs. Hudson laughed. "Looks like you have an admirer."
Joan cocked her head in confusion. "Oh I know about that. But John, I'm talking about something else. Sherlock you can tell your husband or I can just as easily spit it out."
Suddenly there was a loud whirring noise and the ventilators turned on, causing a dispel of the herbs to cloud the air. John and Sherlock immediately ran for the door and desperately tugged at them but there was no movement. Sherlock yelled out as he slammed against it with all his might but there was no chance. He bit back a cry as he slowly stopped, looking at John's face, his eyes glossy.
John angrily looked at the ceiling and whispered some obscenities before just sighing. "Fine, okay? Just please apologize."
John blinked again sluggishly as he desperately held her hand. "How.... are ya gettin..... the herbs? I.... only know.... one personnn...."
John didn't get a chance to even ask what he was blubbering about because he was gone without seconds causing the sweater wearing blogger to just stare in utter confusion. Sherlock, on the other hand, was nearing thoughts of murdering rage as he ran up the stairs of 221B by sets of two. As he slammed open the door his eyes met with John's coat from the Taxi ride that had been carelessly thrown by Mystrade (yes he just called Mycroft and Greg Mystrade because honesty, it is obvious) during the event where John was having an overdose attack. Running over the jacket he picked it up and as soon as he did, something hit the floor next to him. Letting his eyes follow to the noise that was made, Sherlock's eyesight began to color red with rage as a familiar bottle of the antidote rolled onto the floor. Picking it up, he stared at the bottle and realized what he had done. Not only did he murder someone, but he didn't play the rules of the woman's game. And everyone knows that cheaters always lose.
"Joan excuse us for a moment." John managed to growl out as he gripped Sherlock's arm, leaving a bruise probably.
Sherlock looked at John with a look of fond disgust. "I did not such thing I just realized they were doing it wrong!"
The woman looked up between the two of them with a confused smile. "Oh hello! You're the Baker Street Boys correct? That's what you're called these days at least. I'm Joan! This is little Markus, he's a sweetheart!"
Sherlock felt his jaw tense as he glared at her when he felt a hand go on his shoulder. John was frowning at Sherlock and then back at Joan.
Also thanks so much for the follows, likes, comments! It helps a lot and I'm so happy you guys are enjoying it! If you want to leave feedback on what you want on the next chapters, plz plz comment down below and I'll put them in! Thanks everyone!
Greg flushed red as he ducked his head slightly. "Well he was eyeing Sherlock with this look in his eye and-"
Mycroft carefully pulled out a voice recorder that had recorded Sherlock's entire speech. Sherlock slowly took it and nodded at Mycroft, a silent thank you. Mycroft nodded back and left 221B.
"That's enough." Sherlock snapped causing a surprised look on the three other men. "We are at a crime scene not the funeral. Let's just figure out what the hell is going on and finish this up."
Sherlock watched as John's eyes still seemed to have that foggy gleam to them. "Well you most likely can answer these questions. Last night you were at a meeting, the head of this meeting was a woman named Joan. Joan had drugged you and the rest of the members there in order to finish her own personal cravings for vengeance. I'm not sure how she did it or even if SHE did it but I am almost certain it is her. You were told in the beginning something about a medicine that wasn't given to everyone; natural selection at its finest. So I need you to do something for me, you must tell me the names of all the other people that were present there. This is very crucial, John."
Sherlock cautiously walked over and held John's hand with a blush. "I don't want to talk to 'Greg,' he's annoying. Why don't I go with you?"
Greg smirked to himself as he powered down his laptop and put it in a carrier as he looked over at Mycroft. "$20 for Sherlock pining for John and the other 20 is for you blatant flirting. Now hurry up and put your jacket on, it gets busy this time of the night."
"Brilliant, then why are we all still standing here?" Sherlock snapped as he bolted down the stairs earning a middle finger salute from John.
The officer blinked slowly before raising his walkie-talkie. "Sir I have a code 22 in the lobby where a man is shouting about Prisoner 147, should I use force or let him continue?"
Greg let out a sigh on the other side of the line. "Sherlock come down to Washington Street, we have two dead and get this, exact same symptoms of what the other victims had."
Sherlock stared at John as he processed the words. The feeling he felt was weird, different and made him feel like he wanted to either throw up or take John Watson right here, right now.
Sherlock at this point was pissed as he quickly spun around and threw a vase on the floor, shattering everywhere. "I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE! Mycroft, if John discovers what happened here, he will never forgive me and feel guilty. Now I know what guilt feels like and if I don't take it well, neither will he."
All Mycroft could do is just stare at Greg's face, wondering how the hell he wasn't as sneaky as he originally thought.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and walked calmly over to John. "John, listen to me, the poison isn't meant to harm the children but only the caregivers. The child takes the poison after playing with the toys at the daycare because the murderer laced it with it since all kids play with the toys with their mouths and hand and then gives it to the parents. This virus was specifically motified in order to not harm any of the children so our murderer has a soft spot. He's just trying to destroy any parents. The murderer obviously wants to own these children and raise them like soldiers. It's the worst kind to be completely honest cause these kids are so stupid and small they can't do anything but that's my opinion...... no offense Rosie."
John was blushing profusely at Greg's comment but quickly straightened his crooked shirt, letting out a cough. "Okay what proof?"
"Because in my little game I don't play like that. I give one antidote for two affected people. The night you left that meeting, you were one of the victims and I didn't give YOU the antidote."
Sherlock coughed harshly causing Mycroft to flinch slightly. "Yes she would be that obvious. She knows she has been caught and figured I would tell everybody where she was located. Not only that but she openly used her name. It was all just a show, she told me it was Natural Selection. But honestly you would think that she would've been more careful around ME."
Sherlock continued to pace before looking out the window. "I..... mycroft I don't know what I did wrong. I made a drug so people wouldn't get hurt and he didn't let me finish my sentence. He thinks he's gonna die because I kissed him! I genually modified the drug so that the people I care about the most in my life wouldn't get hurt! The drug itself was just to help me."
-------------------------------------(back to pain land)-----------------------------------------------------------
Joan laughs and blinks innocently at Sherlock. "But dearest Sherlock I didn't make it in the first place. By changing the chemical alignment who is to stay I made it more dangerous? Maybe what I changed was something to protect the people in my little club." Joan leaned forward and sneered upwards at the detective. "Face it Sherlock, you. Can't. Touch. Me."
"I gave the drug to Kat because she had a girlfriend. Guess who it was? The second victim. Her name was Beatrice Lauren, partner; Kat Grinly. The two of them died because I guarantee they both shared the drug together. I grabbed the Ketamine from the police scene because I can't let this drug getting into the wrong hands. But John you must understand that this drug can't KILL people. Yes, everything I said implies that I murdered many people but that's not the case at all. This drug has the ability to knock people out or paralyze or even cause paranoia but nothing else. It can't kill them. So somebody else knows about the Ketamine that I have been giving people because they somehow are finding ways to kill them after I weaken them. It's sick and twisted and, oh so clever. Brilliant actually, I mean to know that a man is going out giving a chemically engineered drug to people so they become out of focus and then knowing the precise time when they would use it so they can attack when most vulnerable is ghastly... which makes this case so amazing but I NEED you, John Watson, to help me find the other people and I promise that I will not use the drug again if you and Rosie come back...... because I.... well, John Hamish Watson, I love you." Sherlock said spinning around and pointing at the red balloon.
"Thank you John for agreeing." Sherlock said with a smile and left the apartment with a glaring John following him and a smirking Mrs. Hudson watching the boys bicker.
Greg however ignored Sherlock and turned to Mycroft. "Listen I can't give you the $40 from the two boys petty argument-"
Around 10 minutes later, Sherlock with a grand flourish, slammed open the door and pointed at a security officer. "I am here to talk to Joan, a murdering psychopath that needs to be talked to otherwise I am afraid I will have to break her out of her cell and confront her at another area."
Greg flicked his eyes to John and sighed. "You got a half hour max. I'll bullshit what I know while you go find your lover."
"No no, we have to head down or people will wonder what's taking so long." John said as he pushed Sherlock off of him with a sly smile.
"Um, sorry about uh... interrupting.... mycroft owes me $60 for walking in on this..... uh anyways we found more proof."
Kate smiled uneasily and shook Rosie's hand. "Well we are pleased to have you here! You can go and talk with the other parents and we will start the activities soon!"
"John this was never about forgiveness. I was giving you space. You were angry at me and I knew whatever I would say you would not listen. Yes, I killed a woman but if I were given the chance I would've done it again."
Mycroft nodded along in fake interest as he pulled a chair up right next to Greg's. "I can help with it as I am known to be quite skillful in this area. By my knowledge, it appears the only way to get this done is by dinner, with me, at 7 down at the Royal Oak."
Mycroft frowned and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Even though John hates it when you do drugs? Well Sherlock for one thing you should know that randomly kissing people is not a very good strategy at getting people you want-"
"If she was one of the victims, maybe we can see if she had the same symptoms as me? We could easily just remake the antidote you gave me-"
Sherlock and John turned to each other and gave small smiles before leaving the daycare, oblivious to the stares of the other mother's, all sharing knowing looks. Sherlock and John left the daycare in a hurry and gave the address to the cab driver. The two boys arrived at the scene and looked down at the woman. It was a young girl, 22 by the looks of her crinkles around her eyes with pale skin, ginger hair and green eyes. John scrunched his face up in pure sadness as Sherlock just walked cautiously around the sight.
Sherlock gasped as his breathing was getting more and more constricted. "But I gave the drug with MY DNA in the first place- how am I being affected?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "It's not 'parent' sing along cause it was originally mommy sing along but once a male couple comes in you changed it to parent. I applaud your effort though."
"Did you? Sherlock have you forgotten that I have been in many circumstances like this and every time I or someone else have seen another dying person, we found a way. But you left her to die? How fucking selfish are you?!" John yelled.
Greg just nodded along to that and the corners of his mouth titled upwards into a smirk. "So how are you and John?"
John smiled softly and walked over before tucking his head under Sherlock's head. "You scared me a little because I woke up alone in YOUR bedroom."
Greg, at this point was rushing Mycroft to hurry up so they could leave but Mycroft, being the cheeky bastard that he is, just looped an arm around Greg's shoulders causing him to jump.
Mrs. Hudson let out a soft laugh and heard her walk around. "Well I thought you forgot about your little angel."
The two men laughed as they looked at each other. Mycroft looked at his watch and frowned, "Now I know Sherlock went to that meeting but he promised to call once it was over... it just finished 15 minutes ago."
John didn't really know what happened but he did know that he felt two warm, sturdy hands strongly tuck itself on John's rosy cheeks. The next moment was a warm and wet feeling on his lips and with a startling realization he realized it was Sherlock...... WAIT.
"We..... we should really be going to bed." John said suddenly but still didn't move, neither did Sherlock.
John chuckled as blush covered his neck. "Yes we are better, thank you Joan. I'll be here next time okay?"
At the mention of her name, John felt his dinner crawl up from his stomach in depression. "Oh god no."
John frowned. "What? How did I get drugged? I just remember going to the parent meeting for a while and then going home...."
John rolled his eyes and pecked Sherlock's cheek. "You'll be fine! I'm not gonna be long and then we can meet up at home okay?"
"Well Sherlock we aren't actually, you know, husbands. I.... I just want to make that clear to you." John said with slight hesitation.
"John it's okay I understand. He's stressed and I'm used to that asshole's nature. Just go on and help him, God knows he needs it." Greg said with a mutter at the end.
"How dare you just accuse my FRIEND of all people- do you understand that Joan is trying to help us raise Rosie? To me, that is absolutely generous and heartwarming to know someone cares! Sure we have Mrs. Hudson but Rosie needs somebody more than just a caretaker, she needs parents and the only person who actually understands what the bloody hell that means is your 'murderer,' Joan!"
Sherlock whimpered as John disconnected their lips but frowned nonetheless at John's statement. "Well obviously I didn't kill them because Ketamine can't do that unless you overdose but I specifically gave her only enough for one hit. Yes I could be arrested for taking part of the murder but we don't have to worry about that. What we need to focus on is the connection between the two. Yes the two victims found dead were girlfriends but how do we know that they didn't share the drug with anyone else? I got a text when I was heading over to see you from Lestrade saying they found another victim but I don't understand what it could be from. At the moment the daycare is the only place similar to the two victims, now we just need to see who this next one is and start finding the suspects."
The door flew open as Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the worried taxi driver. "Yes, why do you ask? He's my..... boyfriend."
He chuckles in response. "Ah the dollar bill. Well I started that trend because I thought it would be funny as your relationship is so American to Greg and I."
John smirked. "Of course. He makes it easy considering he never sleeps and when he does I have to make him."
"What is it Mycroft? Unless you have some incredible and life changing news for me then hang up and I'll pay you the $2o you've been spending." Sherlock spat bitterly.
John shook his head and sluggishly moved away from Greg's hand holding the antidote. "Wait what does he mean by where's yours? Wouldn't you both have one?"
“It’s been right in front of me and I never realized it.” Sherlock explained standing up with a grin and walking over to John. “Love.”

Sherlock slowly looked up and motioned for John to come closer. Uh oh, here comes the blush. As John moved closer, Sherlock's eyes twinkled with mischief as he leaned in and whispered, "I'm joking, John."
"Because what Sherlock? What? You didn't think it would affect us because we didn't know or were you just being an arrogant-"
Mycroft just stared at his younger brother with a disturbed look. "You are much too attached to this man. You are Sherlock Holmes, you don't feel you just, do. But regardless I can't always stop you when you do stupid things, even if those 'stupid things' are everything you do. So go, but if you end up in trouble I will have no choice but to inform John and not only will you be dying but so will your relationship with Mr. Watson."
Sherlock huffed and picked her up, immediately smiling and tickling her stomach. John was in the middle of fixing Rosie's bottle when a woman cleared her throat. Looking up, John locked eyes and oddly recognized her but didn't say anything as he stood up and shook her head.
"Wait hold on, you KNEW it was the daycare we dropped Rosie off at? And you didn't think that, oh, I don't know, maybe it isn't a goOD FUCKING IDEA TO PUT HER WHERE THERES A POISON SCARE?" John screamed at Sherlock who was calmly sitting in his chair.
Greg shared a look with Mycroft before stepping forward and looked at Sherlock in the eye seeing the glazed look. "Damn..."
Mycroft arched his eyebrows and shrugged, standing up and fixing his jacket. "Sounds good I'll see you in the cab."
Sherlock frowned and looked around the room they were in. "I wanted to test out the drug because I was.... doing research and John please understand what I'm saying! It was an experiment to see what would happen with any of the murderers that Lestrade has cooked up and whether they would choose the victims that I 'intoxicated' and clearly Ketamine is powerful enough to daze the victim because two people are dead now! But you, Rosie, and Mrs. Hudson weren't in danger because....." Sherlock faltered at the next line earning a scowl from John.
Ketamine 'trains' your body to become submissive to everything and therefore any form of attack. She was using phrases in her speech to alert Sherlock that she wasn't who she seemed. The training at the meeting is what Sherlock needs to know about and when he realizes what she really did, then maybe, just maybe he will be able to get enough proof and arrest her.
Sherlock smiled at the corner of his mouth in acknowledgement of John's idiotic comment. "I actually must discuss with you about the crime scene."
"We?" John spat and stood up viscously until he was right in front of Sherlock. "There never was a WE, Sherlock. It was me, Rosie and Mary. But Mary is gone, Sherlock. So it's just Rosie and I. You never were part of this family and I'm damn sure you never will be." John growled bitterly as he spun on his heel and ran down the steps out of 221B.
Sherlock blinked slowly as he took a sip of the tea. "Well some of it seemed familiar but I am rather unsure. If you give me some time as well as the location of our so-called killer, hopefully that will make me get out of this humanistic state."
"I am not a boy, Mycroft. I just don't like it when people play with my stuff." Sherlock said, his eyes now focused on John who had his nose scrunched up as a doctor checked his blood pressure.
Joan looked up the minute the door opened and saw Sherlock standing there, his chest puffed out, eyes narrowed, body upright and attentive. "Ah Sherlock, if it isn't my favorite-"
Sherlock rolled his eyes and muttered something about John being a 'muppet' before walking over to the dead body. John put his hands in his pockets and approached the two men.
John, who was standing next to him watching him work, cocked an eyebrow. "What do you mean 'what drug'?"
"Uh, I'm gonna uh just you know.... investigate.... yep." John murmured more so to himself as he lifelessly hailed a cab.
"Well aren't you a dominant." Joan sneers. "Sherlock I may be brilliant and I may have told someone to spray the drugs into the air, but I never laid a finger on it."
John nodded in understanding but his head was still buzzing from that kiss. Slowly moving to the desk where all the information was on the murders, he gathered them all up as quietly as he could and headed to his bedroom. Once there, he laid down all the papers. The first victim that they ever saw was Kat Grinly.
Sherlock nods and begins to lean forward, John leaning at the same time to meet him halfway. Suddenly there's a cough and both boys turn to see Greg standing there sheepishly with the car parked on the side. John tries to let go of Sherlock's grip but Sherlock is relentless and remains attached to him, his eyes narrowed and body protective.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well well well! That was absolutely incredible! Everybody let's give a loud applause for the Holmes family!" Joan said happily.
"No, don't apologize..... actually wait no I want an apology but I want a reason for it, Sherlock. And don't you dare say research or I will punch you in the face." John growled out.
Sherlock chuckled softly at that earning a surprised look by Greg. "Well looks like you remembered too. So Grant lead the way for us."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and put his jacket down. "Oh? Then please, show me how to talk to..... men."
"Not that type of law you idiotic specimen," Sherlock hissed out. "The law of Natural Selection. Just like Joan and her reason for killing the people in the meetings-"
"Drunk, Sherlock. I was meant to go to that parent meeting but I couldn't because... Well I don't know why but I woke up with a headache and no understanding of the night's adventures so PLEASE, do me a favor, and just leave me alone for right now."
"Okay, so now we gotta check her background history." John murmured to himself, biting on a pen but his lips were still burning from that kiss and he was just out of it for right now.
Sherlock cocked his eyebrow. "What do you mean? Aren't husbands supposed to share intimate moments such as those to make their daughter more lovable?"
"Sherlock he stopped breathing 30 seconds ago." Greg nearly whispered as he saw flashing lights for an ambulance.
Sherlock's facade crumbled slightly as he leaned forward and captured John's lips in his own. John smiled into it with victory as he carefully pulled Sherlock to the point where he was basically straddling him. The kiss started getting more heated as Sherlock's hands seem to have found a way under his shirt causing a blushing Greg to nudge Mycroft who was just staring amused.
A piece of rice fell off his fork and onto the plate as Sherlock just continued eating. "Okay well if you're going to act like that, I did talk to Joan, the overly happy woman that looks as though she's going to burn down an entire neighborhood? Speaking of I believe she has a dark past and gets set off by easy things and so one day a woman makes fun of her cooking and BOOM! Her so called best friend is now in ruins." Sherlock said with a deep chuckle as he ate another piece of food.
Mycroft chuckled as Greg's realization blossomed across his face. "Really Greg you had to ask didn't you?"
The woman frowned. "In a way? Oh it doesn't matter, regardless my name is Maria! So here at the meetings we start with meditation with organic herbs that make you feel so calm almost like you can't feel anything and it's great because all the stress of caring for children and annoying husbands, I have a feeling you deal with that, is finally just let go!"
Sherlock picked up the cold woman's hand and looked at her fingers. Pink was visible under her fingernails and under the skin of her finger. He scanned her body and entered his mind palace, looking at possible ways of dying. There was glass around her body from crashing through her window but that was on the bottom floor so she would not have died from that. The glass was cleaned but fragile so if she had passed out and died, her body weight alone would've crushed the window to pieces, not the glass so she must've been poisoned before. Sherlock quickly jumped up and grabbed John's arm as they headed to the entrance of her home. The first thing Sherlock saw was that there wasn't much struggle. The doorknob was turned in a rush as though she was fearful walking home from walk alone(there were no footprints in her garage that would say another person was there) but when him and John had opened the door to let themselves in, it reset the door therefore throwing off any source of security the woman planned. Sherlock slowly crept in and examined the scene. The window was just across the room where she fell out. Quickly moving, he ran to the window and examined the outer layer of the window:
Sherlock growled under his breath and kneeled next to John, pressing the bottle to his lips and tipping it back. Quickly lifting him up, he titled his chin so the liquid went down his throat. Sherlock watched with intense eyes as John's remained closed.
"How long do I have to go find Sherlock?" John whispered as the police began to cuff Joan to move her into another room.
Sherlock had a strong grip on John's hand as he jerked him forward, a small pout on his lips. "I don't like the way she smiles at you...."
DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN TO BE CONTINUED! Also thanks so much to all the reviews, I love reading them and I get such a big smile at the support I am getting. It is a lot of fun to write this story and I am so glad to share it with all of you!
Greg nodded and looked down at her. "What I don't understand is how she was poisoned. There are no needle marks on her skin, no residue of a pill, we checked for both tablet form and liquid."
They got to the sing along and John felt out of place. He watched as only mothers entered the buildings with their children.
John frowned and sighed. "Alright how about I go and talk to Joan at the parents night to see if anything has happened there, see if any witnesses noticed anything."
Joan laughed bitterly as she went up to the cell gate. "I'm talking about the drugs, John. Half of the women that are dead all had interactions with your man over there... ain't that right Sherlock?"
Mycroft quickly shushed him by standing up. "Sherlock stop blabbering and actually accept what's going on here. You may be a genius but you can be incredibly dull.... and expensive I lost $300 but Greg owes me $40 because of the domestic fight between you and John."
There was silence except for the comforting squeeze from John's hand. Joan, on the other hand, had been silent before breaking out into laughter causing the rest of the women to do the same.
"Can you stop being so philosophical and help me with John?! He's trying to say something everyone shut up." Sherlock shouted as John weakly gripped Sherlock's shirt.
Mycroft joined Greg as the two helped John sit up and search his pockets. Greg whisked out a bottle and frowned at the label 'drink me :)'
"You think it would be that simple for you to leave after you 'deduced' me? Oh no, Sherlock, you haven't been playing by my games so I will not be playing anymore of yours. Maria, turn it on."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Mycroft and turned stiffly to John. "I apologize for him he's very annoying."
"I don't have time for this, john please deal with my brother's hormones, they're very frayed already so try and be harsh." Mycroft said as he shoved his hand in his pocket and turned around, walking in the opposite direction.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and slightly puffed his chest out to display a 'if you mess with me or my boyfriend I will 221B Beat your ass.' "Ah, Joan, lovely to see you as always. How are the meetings? I seem to notice that there are more absences lately."
John sighed as he sat at the parent night. He was pissed at Sherlock. No, he wasn't pissed; he was hurt. But anger was his default mode for when Sherlock does something stupid so that was his only excuse. Him and Rosie were sat on the carpet during which Joan was having everyone do some exercise with their babies. John was not in the mood and was lazily moving Rosie's legs back and forth like she was pedaling a bike.
Rosie gurgled at him and John scowled. "Whatever. Listen we have the sing along today and you're going as punishment for putting her in harms way."
Greg nodded and they both looked over at the kind woman's lifeless body. "Apparently she was leaving the daycare, last one out and was heading to a parents night meeting when she just, collapsed. We looked at her body and sure enough there was still red under her fingertips and it seemed like she was under some intoxication before dropping dead. She did make it to her car and by the looks of it was halfway to unlocking it. She smashed her head into the window of the car, breaking it slightly, before slumping down and just... stopped breathing."
John frowned and snuggled Rosie more against his shoulder as he held onto the baby bag with the other hand. They entered and saw possibly 24 other mothers all talking amongst each other. They of course stated slightly at the two men as they sat as far away as they could.
"Perfect! Just so you know the daycare closes at 4 so please be here to pick her up." Susan said as she nodded at the men and left the room.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well boys have fun, just come down when you're... relieved. We have two murders to solve gentlemen." Mycroft said as he scribbled down a check and handed it to Greg who just frowned at it, mumbling about how he could buy a dinner for the two of them with this money.
"Sherlock," Greg said as he bounced Rosie on his knee. "I don't understand why you think Joan would do this, she's kind and has given us such a lead on the case and is super involved in the community. Are you maybe jealous that she is out with John tonight?"
John frowned down at Sherlock, okay frown is too nice of a word... maybe glowering? Fuming? Shaking with anger?
He could imagine it perfectly; Susan was closing up the daycare after every child was taken home and every employee clocked out for the night. She was nervous and needed to relax with some sort of drug.
The two boys arrived at the scene and if Sherlock wasn't so good at a poker face, everyone would see him on the verge of panicking. At the moment he just had a large dose of inner hatred for himself. He stared at the woman on the floor and wouldn't move despite John slowly walking over and investigating her.
Sherlock shook his head and panted as Mycroft soaked a towel and tried to cool down his brother's burning skin. "Don't worry...."
He scrunched his nose up and casted a glance at Mycroft who just nodded quickly. "No John I can't, I do not know what happened when you were at Joan's meeting but I'll be able to deduce what happened just by the scrunched up collar of your shirt from being roughly manhandled by a woman, most likely Joan. But for now you are going to hospital and get yourself checked out."
John weakly pushed Sherlock to the side with a giggle. "No no we- Sherlock stop- we will be ready to- Sherlock not thERE- ok just give us a minute to settle down- holy fuck- yeah just give me a minute." John gasped out.
John laughed bitterly. "Care? You don't care about me or any of us! If you did you wouldn't be fucking around with my emotions or kissing me randomly or selling drugs to a woman found dead! You would actually be there for me... for us."
"Alright everyone! You're free to go as it is 8! And remember, check your purse when you get home and have a hopefully safe night!"
Joan rolled her eyes and pushed John on the floor as he inhaled more and more. "Don't worry I promised I wouldn't hurt Rosie... never made a promise about you though."
Sherlock had been pacing the room frantically as he looked at the clock. 8:15 and John wasn't home yet. In clear frustration, Sherlock called Mycroft and demanded his assistance after mrs. Hudson dropped off Rosie to Sherlock but him being as nervous and annoyed as he was, began to question a crying Rosie and shout at her as he shot at the wall. Rule number one in parenting was made clear by Mycroft that he should not shoot in the presence of a child. Mycroft had dragged Greg along who nonetheless was pleased to see an angry Sherlock though that quickly faded when he threatened to make Greg the wall.
John groaned as he started to drag himself to the door but Joan just slowly followed him. "John John John, do you think of me as that dumb or do you think you can try and leave? The mediation isn't over until I say it's over. And by over I mean one of these lucky ladies gets to leave tonight and not come back. I can let you choose John, if you want. Who would it be? Maria? Susanna? Katie? Julia? Or would you rather just sacrifice yourself as the good little solider you are?"
Sherlock clenched his fists and smacked them on the table. "Listen, Joan. You just need to admit your faults and we can all be done with this. I'm not asking you to tell everyone what you did, I'm ordering you, Joan."
Sherlock stomped his foot and growled menacingly at Greg. "I am NOT jealous! I am just annoyed that John didn't let me join him because I could've helped and-"
John looked up and couldn't help it as he started laughing too and it was so alarming to Mrs. Hudson that she thought something happens and ran upstairs to see the two boys looking at each other in pure tears.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Not in the slightest but if you must know, John found out about the dead woman incident and basically told me to leave him and his 'family' alone."
Everybody was quiet. The police were staring, the victim was STILL dead, a woman had fainted, and mycroft was angrily pulling out 4 $20 bills to hand to a shocked and most likely confused Greg. John, on the other hand, just stood there staring at the space where Sherlock was a moment ago. What the hell. Slowly turning around he grabbed the notepad and pen from Greg's frozen hand and cleared his throat.
"Bloody hell; what the fuck happened to you two?!" Greg shouted as he quickly moved Sherlock to a chair despite him pushing weakly at him.
Greg's face heated up instantly as it became a dark red and he cleared his throat with a low chuckle. "You know you can't keep doing that."
"Sherlock? You alright? What do you mean by 'she killed two' there's only been the murder with the child-"
Joan just stared at him before bursting into laughter. "Oh John Holmes you are a funny man indeed! Ha! Oh well best to you and your husband! As well as little Rosie too!"
"No." Maria snapped. "It won't help because I know something is off but I never know what it is. All I know is you must stop now or it will only get worse."
"Good evening all my daycare employees and parents!" Joan chirped out as all the girls chorused back a hello. "I see John Holmes has joined us as well so everyone please give him a warm welcome as we do our training and exercises! Can somebody also explain the rules while I prepare everything?"
When Mycroft said the last part of the sentence, Sherlock could hear him both through the phone and right behind him. Sherlock let out a sigh and turned around, cocking an eyebrow at Greg.
Mycroft wrinkled his nose. "Please I don't know how to do it but I can at least give you tips. Here, I'll be John and you talk to me as if I was him."
Sherlock stood up abruptly and stared at John for a minute before turning sharply to Mycroft and Greg. "You two watch over him and I swear if you let him die I will cast you off to an island with no civilization causing you to die slowly and painfully. Do I make myself clear?"
John frowned and scrunched his nose before nodding and walking over to Sherlock. He was being cautious as the detective didn't seem his normal self; that is if he even has a normal self.
He narrowed his eyes and nearly ran over to the window to inspect Joan. “She was making it so bloody simple and I was such an idiot to not realize it in the first place. It’s a game of a love, John.” Sherlock said turning to John. “And we are one of the few players that have won. All we have to do is beat her at her own game.”
"Your murderer is a parent at the daycare. The woman was unhappy about the care her child received from this particular care giver and she lashed out by dropping off a toy that was laced with a poison I'm not sure which one have Anderson find it, maybe if we're lucky he will get infected because of his low IQ. Point of the matter is you must interrogate every parent there and make sure no child goes to it." Sherlock said as he slowly grabbed John's arm and looped it with him. "Now if you don't mind us, we have to save our daughter from a possible murderer."
Sherlock growled and tried to throw his shoe but Greg shut the door just in time. "You, Mycroft Holmes, are going on a date?"
Mycroft and Greg arrived quickly and ran up to the steps to see a pale and barely moving John with an equally pale but moving Sherlock who looked at the edge of collapse.
Greg stared with his mouth open slightly as Sherlock basically said exactly what happened at the meeting. "Sherlock you need to come down to the station and state exactly what you said to me if we want to make sure Joan doesn't hinder our own process."
Sherlock shrugged. "That part I am still a little dazed about but most likely yes. It's interesting, the human species need to have Natural Selection. It doesn't make sense that humans have this strong urge to cast out anything that isn't considered normal but yet we all do things that aren't normal. For example I analyze bodies and find killers to put it vaguely and I am a high functioning sociopath. But yet people rely on me for solving cases that their small brains cannot interpret.  However as soon as somebody comes out as a homosexual or anything in that general area, it is considered not normal. And Joan, in a way is doing the exact thing. She tries to kill me or John so that the two of us are out of the equation, the equation for success in exposing the crimes of those not worthy for selection. Her whole plan is to just select those to create an army. Imagine it Grayson, an army of those who are trained in killing those that slow down their process. Can you imagine how much greater the world can be with no weaklings or powers of authority? But again, this is just a guess."
Sherlock frowned again and opened the door to see Mycroft's arms holding Greg who had a goofy smile on his face as he was twirled in a circle.
John frowned and felt a stab of suspicion as he stared at the back of Sherlock's coat. "Intoxication, huh?"
"This mask was used by her in the auditorium while all the others sucked in that 'organic herb.' But I bet that if you run this through with Molly and the proper lab equipment, you can track her DNA to the next sadistic meeting that she holds.... oh and another thing, she's pretty clumsy for a killer, dropping all her antidotes right in front of me. I am actually slightly disappointed that I couldn't have experimented with my death."
Greg frowned in confusion as Sherlock pulled out a folded gas mask as well as another potion. He laughed in  surprise as Mycroft's shoulders lost his tension and John smiled softly.
John rolled his eyes and secured Rosie on his hip. "Oh yes Sherlock, of COURSE, kids at Rosie's age should for sure be okay to play violin!"
"Greg. But regardless, you are involved in a crime scene, not surprised that you forgot as usual. But you went into a meeting yesterday to see if the killer is the actual killer and it turns out she is. We went to the lab and ran some tests on the gas mask you managed to grab as well as the antidote that you took and both had traces of her fingertips and when we went to the meeting we saw the ventilators, the medicine, everything. She's being held right now down at the station for murder and everything else. We have to figure out who gave her the medication in the first place but that is more difficult... any of that ring any bells or are you just helpless to us at the moment?"
Sherlock looked as though he was going to smash the cell so john gently pulled him back. "Don't let her win like that. What does she even mean?"
Sherlock paced across 221B as he kept flickering his eyes back to the board where all the evidence was kept; photos, 3D prints of bodies, different view points, the whole deal. He froze and spun on his heel as he took Kat's photo and lined it up next to Susan's. They both seemed to be laid down in the same form; one arm laid above the head, legs spread like they are running and the fingertips still containing life. Sherlock jumped up and looked closer at the picture and frowned. But she didn't have the ketamine how did she do it? Sherlock froze. John was going to question Joan, the one woman who has been part of all the victim's lives. The parent meeting, something they all had been trying to go to. Kat and her girlfriend were heading home and by the way the house looked, it seemed as though they were in a rush. Sherlock bolted over to get his coat and quickly got his phone out, dialing John's number.
Greg rolls his eyes at the name. "I came to get both of you, the hearing for Joan is starting in 2 minutes, I held them off for as long as I could but we must finish this once and for all."
"Because soon enough the bet I have going on with myself over you is going to equal our little Johnlock deal."
"Not interested." Sherlock said as he fell down on his chair and picked up a newspaper. "It's probably boring and most likely the wife was the one who hid the children and threw the husband's body into the river. So go away, I have to make sure Rosie gets her sleep or John will have my head."
John frowned. "Do you want me to, like, make a report of that? Cause that's not normal, seriously I would know I am dating a detective."
"I don't want you to be a normal mate, Sherlock. I want you to be you but I don't want you to feel the need to prove that by doing rash decisions such as letting a woman die for me."
One woman raised her hand and Joan smiled warmly as she walked around the room, flipping a switch on the ventilators creating a whirring noise as a slight haze began to flow out the vents. John frowned as he watched her movement. Something seemed familiar with the way she walked, it was as though she had a mission to do and was not going to let anyone get in the way of it.
Everything was silent. The faint sound of the ambulance was merely a whisper as all of the boys stared at the bottle. John was pale but kept his eyes open a crack to watch what was happening while Sherlock was holding the antidote with shaking hands, sweat dripping down his body in pearls. Mycroft and Greg were keeping their eyes narrowed; cautious and torn of what to do.
Joan lifted her head from where she was sitting on the bed and just cocked an eyebrow. "Sherlock this was never about that. It was about finding the right people I suppose. All these mothers going to make a better life for their children is complete bullshit. But, that's not the reason either. It's just fun, Sherlock. You know all about that don't you?"
Sherlock felt his throat close up slightly as he coughed and hung up the phone, not bothering to answer. He stood up and walked to the window and saw that John was sitting on the edge of the ambulance with Greg chatting to him, phone in hand as if he had just told Sherlock that the anecdote he took killed not one but two people. However if Joan hadn't given one to John, why would she not give one to another person? Balance? She had been perfectly fine killing one at a time.
Rosie just stared at him with a seemingly annoyed glance and surprisingly enough, Sherlock wore the exact same expression.
John's eyes widened as he realized Sherlock Holmes was kissing him. Before he could either A. Return the kiss or B. Push him away, Sherlock pulled back and sighed.
Sherlock nodded again this time with a glint in his eye. "Yes of course. However, guidance typically, if I am correct, doesn't come in the form of an herb."
Greg chuckled and scratched the back of his neck. "Yeah it's ok. Hello to you as well! Speaking of, you owe me $40 once for Sherlock shouting at us to do it correctly and another $20 cause he obviously got jealous from giving mouth to mouth."
John stopped at the look of panic on Maria's face and laughed awkwardly. "Sorry sorry that was too extreme."
Sherlock's eyebrows knit together as he comfortingly put a hand on the nape of John's neck. "I would rather be in this with you then for you to be alone."
Joan's jaw stiffened at that but she just nodded. "Yes we have lost some people either from moving away-"
Greg smiled. "Yes that! You never mentioned that part of the conversation before with Joan. So that was her plan? She is getting rid of the weaker links?"
The two boys were silent now except for the harsh breathing between the two. Before either could bring up any more harsh words, Joan appeared between the two of them with a smile.
"I-I.... I need to go." John muttered as he brushed past Greg and made a beeline for the men's bathroom.
Sherlock turns around and sees John, panting heavily as he just stares at the detective. Neither say anything as the two simply look at each other.
Finally, Sherlock quickly moved so his arms were on either side of John's head, pinning him there, face close. "I wasn't, jealous."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and jabbed at his forehead causing John to cry out in pain. "You sure about that? John if you don't get in the ambulance I will carry you to the ambulance."
To say that Greg was having an off day would be an understatement. "Um, I love you too?" Greg joked.
There was pure silence as she uttered those last words. Sherlock's hands were frozen on the cell, Joan's expressionless face was staring back, and John was simply standing there, tears becoming evident as he drifted his eyes over to his 'husband.'
Joan shrugged as she slipped a bottle into John's jacket but not Sherlock's. "I guess this is just a mystery you'll have to solve; oh but wait, you won't remember it will you?"
Greg nodded at Mycroft and smirked at a confused Sherlock. "Good luck with John, give him a kiss for me will you?"
Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose, hoping that he could still connect with John in his lucid state. "No, John, listen to me last night you were-"
There were two relieved chuckles from Greg and Mycroft as John smiled into Sherlock's chest. "Sherlock.... can't breathe..."
John didn't know what to say. What could he say? I'm sorry? It's my fault? Come back to me? Thoughts flooded his mind as john stared at Sherlock, his eyes locked with John.
Sherlock felt a shock of guilt wash over him but at the moment he would rather be getting turned on than feeling bad about the choices he made. "Yes that's true, I did save your life and everything and I don't think I got a proper thank you.."
"You'll always be my best friend cause you're all I have." Sherlock spoke softly as he caresses John's cheek with a small smile.
Sherlock was quiet at first and simply just frowned at him. "Okay. Fine. But I will not stay at the meeting."
John let himself chuckle but even that felt forced as his attack still thumped against his chest as if to say 'hi John I'm still here ya bastard.' "We.... we had a fight but I want to handle it my own... Can I talk to Rosie?"
Despite Mycroft's semi influential words, Sherlock heard none of it as he already put on his jacket and hat before turning and nodding at his brother's direction to which he responded back with a nod.
Sherlock didn't know where to go first. He thought going back to the apartment would cause Mrs. Hudson to go all mother hen on him and call John demanding them to start off on a better foot. But Sherlock was not in the mood. He walked along the streets searching for something whether that be a serial killer, robber, maybe if he's lucky a homicide. But that all was ruined by a phone call. People. Not something he was in the mood for either.
Sherlock growled under his breath. "John for God's sake I am not trying to be the boss of you! I am trying to save your life. This place isn't what it seems-"
John's face turned red as Sherlock just shrugged. "Well we are apparently married, or so says the daycare John and I dropped Rosie off at. Speaking of, John we have parent time on Thursday so don't make plans."
"He remembered... my name?" Greg whispered as Mycroft just smirked to himself and put a $20 in his coat pocket.
John scrunched his nose up and nudged Sherlock. "As much as I would like to take bets on what position your brother would be doing with Greg, I would rather keep whatever sanity I have left."
Joan smiled softly and sat next to him, picking up Rosie and doing the exercise for him. "You seem stressed, everything ok? How's Sherlock?"
The car ride to the station was simple enough. Greg was sat up front driving and Sherlock and John were in the back. As soon as they got in the car, Sherlock coughed and flopped his hand down, palm up in between the seats as he looked out the window. John smirked at Sherlock's simple token of love as he placed his down on top and they sat in silence. As they got to the station, Sherlock immediately straightened up and his face became stony.
Sherlock looked back over at Mycroft. "And it's none of your business of what is happening between John and I yet here you are exchanging twenty dollar bills with Greg. Do you two not realize that we aren't in America? Why are you even doing dollars?"
The activities started pretty fast and the next step was team building activities between different parents. Since sherlock and John came together, they automatically were partners.
And Sherlock ran out the door, slamming it shut. Mycroft and Greg looked at each other before carefully caring for John.
Mycroft chuckled and turned so he was leaning against the window. "Then by all means brother of mine, protect it then."
Sherlock let out a puff of air in frustration. "But John knows I am different than a soldier. I don't kill people for anyone or rather any reason at all. Sometimes I admit it's for fun but most of the time I do it for the law."
Suddenly Sherlock was holding two sticks in his hands and was releasing a very high pitched version of Mozart. The other mothers stopped their children and stared in amazement as Sherlock rhythmically tapped against the piano keys. John's mouth fell down halfway through and he stared at Sherlock's expression and the movement of his fingers. As he continued playing, John's mind wandered into something more..... deep. He watched his hands go in beat with the keys, how his knuckles were clenched around the stick and showed his veins against the skin, how his long fingers gracefully moved against the piano. Traveling his eyes up, he looked at Sherlock's face. His lips were in a pout of concentration, eyebrows burrowed down in a state of amusement and play, and when John looked at his eyes in wonderment, Sherlock's flew to his and they held contact for what seemed like hours but it was merely seconds. Suddenly there was no calming music in the background but rather of applause and Sherlock's steely gaze locked onto John's glazed one.
Sherlock couldn't move when she sad that because he was feeling something he shouldn't ever feel; guilt. "I will make sure they don't take photos... I'm sorry for this, really I am but I have to leave or he will die too."
"Okay now I'm ready." Sherlock said, pleased with himself. "John I want to start off by saying..... I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you about Ketamine because I knew you would overreact like you always-"
John and Sherlock looked up and even little Rosie looked at him and began to cry. Sherlock' face contorted into anger and annoyance.
"Well we did make out in a storage closet at a parent meeting so if you call that fighting then by all means yes we were." John spoke distracted as he slowly walked up to Sherlock.
Greg opened his mouth and shut it before narrowing his eyes. "For god's sake Sherlock what the bloody hell has happened to you?"
As Sherlock walked away, John became acutely aware of all the blubbering police officers as well as an annoyed Mycroft who grumbled as he threw a $20 at a laughing Greg.
Sherlock quickly disappeared into the kitchen and Mycroft heard him shuffling, uncapping, and the sound of a helium machine being used. Sherlock returned and Mycroft groaned loudly. In front of him was a red balloon with a poorly drawn face, now tied to mycroft's hand.
"Well sounds to me somebody's honeymoon went a little past paradise brother of mine." Mycroft chuckled.
"Shut up Grant." Sherlock snapped, earning a pissed off glare from GREG as he knew Sherlock said his name wrong on purpose. "It tells us the side affects of the poison. Paranoia, fainting which leads to death due to lung collapse of some sort most likely from, hallucinations. So now all we do is go to the daycare and see who else feels that way. Then from there we track down and see what is common with all of these people which will eventually lead to a person that was in contact with either a friend of the victim, coworker, or anything else."
"I will then tell John I will watch Rosie. You can't win this one Sherlock, just let the police do their job."
"Shut up." John hissed. "Joan what do you mean? I know he has had drug deals in the past but he's past all that."
John nodded and quickly held Sherlock's hand. "I'm always gonna be here Sherlock, you know that right?"
The woman froze for a minute before nodding slowly. "I understand... but please... when they take my body.... don't let them take photos. I don't want my son.... to see that. Or my husband. I understand it's the protocol but please do that, for me."
"Save it." Sherlock remarked. "I don't have time for your games, Joan. We have you surrounded with information. We have your precious gas mask and bottles a plenty, so why don't you just stop while you're ahead."
Mycroft was unfazed but nonetheless just nodded while Greg just froze and mutely agreed. Sherlock ruffled his hair and quickly pecked John on the top of his head.
A darkness waded into Sherlock's eyes as he looked away from Greg and instead at the very interesting fire place. "I don't know. Everything seems very confusing right now... I mean I killed someone for him and I don't have the, dare I say it, heart to tell him. He will despise me."
Joan quieted and Greg growled out in frustration. "Then what the hell are we going to do now? Either you go make up with him in twenty minutes or you go and sell your bullshit to the police officers."
"So then, uh, how do you get these, um, organic herbs pumped through your body?" John asked as he eyed Joan's movements as she examined everyone until she finally locked eyes with John.
"That, my dear Lestrade, is something called lust." Mycroft spoke as he licked his finger and grabbed a $20 out of his wallet.
"John I want you to know, whatever happens in there, it is not your fault and I will be okay and you must not meddle."
Sherlock didn't know where to look. John was too ill to be asked questions and by the looks of his state and the amount of drugs in his system was dangerous so he had to hurry. He wracked his brain for one of the daycare employees because they must have had been there or maybe even a parent. Sherlock froze and remembered the woman from their first parent meeting. He remembered that flash of jealousy-
The blush that covered Sherlock's face was enough to make John grin and bite his ear playfully. The two boys pulled away after that and Sherlock searched his face.
Sherlock had listened to John quietly and in the inside he knew he screwed up majorly. It was supposed to be a secret. He was supposed to protect John from knowing so he wouldn't hurt him.
Sherlock growled at the man before he ran up the stairs and put him right on the couch, causing Mycroft and Greg to hurry over as well.
John tightened his jaw and smacked Sherlock's arm. "I am sorry Joan. As you know my..... husband, here, does not understand the laws of humanity."
"....L is for the way you look at me! OH, oh- stop Mycroft no! Is for the only one I see, V is v- MYcroFT!"
The room was silent despite the wailing sirens outside the apartment. Greg and Mycroft stood at the window watching the two boys. Suddenly there was a low moan and John's eyes cracked open slowly. Sherlock felt relief flood through his chest as John began to cough weakly, his face regaining some color. Sherlock couldn't understand what was going through his mind. He seemed much more aware of John in front of him. He noticed how slowly he moved his curious eyes around, especially when they drifted over his face. Or rather of his lips and how they were always parted except when he was angry and they would retreat back into a firm line. Sherlock also noticed his body, how he actually had some curves to it, his legs always seemed to wrap around whatever was near and his arms perfect for hugs. His hands were strong yet welcoming and Sherlock noticed now that he was holding his. John's eyes slowly locked in with Sherlock, earning a whimper from the detective.
As Maria was talking, John took all those details and sorted it through his head. Organic herbs that make you pass out, break things, and feel drugged in a way? That is all what ketamine would do to the victims before they died. But how were they dying and how were they getting the drug pumped through their systems if there isn't any form of needle or pill?
Sherlock narrows his eyes. "I made the drug, yes, but YOU changed the chemical alignment! You said so yourself."
"Uh hey he still has to pay-" the taxi driver began but in one swift movement Sherlock whipped out his gun and pointed at him. "Ok you know never-mind tonight is on me!"
John tensed up and casted a glance down at his arm that was intertwined with Sherlock's. "What do you mean/"
"KILL." John shouted, scaring Greg and Mycroft who had appeared at the scene. "Kill, yes when I was begging you to kill that woman who kept shouting in the restaurant."
The first thing Sherlock noticed, was that he wasn't sweating. He didn't feel like he could barely breathe anymore or even feel that sense of unknowing.... but what bothered him is that he couldn't remember what all of those feelings were about. Was it a robbery where they had some weird men dressed as clowns? Or maybe some supernatural being took over his mind? Or possibly it was just a serial killer? Oh that would be fun if it was. Sherlock smiled at the voice in his head at all of the ridiculous circumstances before actually taking in his surroundings. He was on his bed under the blankets as though, dare he say it, he was sleeping. He frowned as he felt body heat next to him and turning his head he saw John's peaceful face as he slept on. Rolling his neck, he stepped out of bed and began his way to the door when he froze and heard music coming from the kitchen.
