Clutching his backpack straps tight, he stood and almost imperceptibly nodded, trying to take some deep breaths through his nose to calm the anxiety in his chest.
“You’re looking good, son.” Steve smiled from behind the kitchen counter, clad in a dark blue t-shirt with a leather jacket. Tony was dressed similarly casual in just a blue Nike hoodie with some jeans and had their ‘disguises’ in his hands.
"Bagsy banker." He quipped after Tony, face in a smirk. Natasha not so subtly rolled her eyes, pushing Clint's legs down with a simple flick of her wrist.
They made they’re way over to the room where Doctor Strange was situated, and when they reached the room, they were greeted by the man in a lab coat with a small smile.
“It’s not fancy, just good food.” Steve smiled. “But we don’t have to go if you’d rather stay here.”
“Why were you sleeping in the vents of the tower?” Asked Clint, voice kind and soft, no hint of interrogation at all.
Had he been sick? His past couple of months kind of blurred all into one, and with his new spider enhancements, he technically couldn’t get sick. But he does remember having a pretty bad headache, fever-driven flu a couple of weeks ago. So were his spider enhancements failing?
The first thing that Peter noticed when he was in the med-bay of Stark Tower is that the Avengers were communicating without speaking, like a well-oiled machine.
“I was going to recommend a therapist, once your mental health starts improving, your physical health will too.”
No one said anything as they all sat down around a glass table and mulled over what had happened less than two hours ago.
Peter looked over to them, but it seemed as though Tony didn’t even think about it before answering: the names already in his head.
He was brought out of his haze by Bruce softly calling him. He turned his head to the man to see him holding up a small casing of something called ‘banana bag’ which then listed underneath it all the supplements it had in it. He nodded and Bruce began to attach it to the IV pole before attaching the tube to it that would eventually go into Peter.
“Yeah, uh sorry it’s been pretty crazy recently.” He pulled off his mask and smiled sheepishly, “I got a new foster family and I decided to take some time off school to deal with everything.” It wasn’t a total lie, he did get a new foster family, but that wasn’t the reason he didn’t go to school anymore.
“Peter? That’s your name, right?” Tony asked, looking up from a tablet that he and Bruce had been looking over. “Peter Benjamin Parker?”
Steve and Tony hopped out of bed, the latter right behind the former as they sped walked down the hall and then into Peter’s room.
“Or how about how I fell through your ceiling, or what I did today or the fucking meals I’ve had or the words I’ve spoken since I got here?” He asked, stepping off the couch.
They shared unhurried, indulgent kisses, each time pulling apart when their play got too heated so that they could ease off and try again. Tony quickly learned that Steve responded to gentle bites, but found ways to back off if there was too much tongue. He wanted to drive, that much became clear early on, and so eventually, Tony surrendered, encouraging Steve’s every touch.
“You know who I am, boy,” Howard snarled, eyeing Steve like he was something filthy stuck to the bottom of his shoe. “What are you, the flavor of the month? Go get Tony.”
“I am the most dangerous man in this city, Tony!” Steve snapped, his words forced through gritted teeth. “If you are worried about safety, fine. Bucky and Natasha can come with us. But no cars, no royal guard, no—no us versus them. You said you wanted an equal,” he finished more gently, and hearing his own words repeated back to him, Tony looked at Steve more carefully. “You wouldn’t let me abdicate to marry you as a Prince Consort. Remember why.”
The words needed time to find their place, touching on different emotions along the way until Tony could pick through and be honest with himself about how they made him feel. Sarah’s words returned to him about his and Steve’s duties, about whom they should love above all else. Even now Tony knew she was right.
“Patiently!” Steve called back over his shoulder. “What grown man can’t wrap a birthday present?” he muttered to Tony, who snickered quietly in his amusement. “Anyway, sweetheart, just—if it’s not a good time, we can reschedule. Or, you really don’t have to do this. Not the field trip, not the mother.”
Tony Stark,” Carol observed when Tony finally wiggled his way down to the mostly empty seat beside her. She watched him look at her and look at her bag sitting on the empty seat, as if she had no idea what he meant.
If burgers made him sick to his stomach, Tony couldn’t bear to watch Steve and Natasha’s reunion. How could Steve so freely share his body with these people? He shook hands, he hugged snotty children, he kissed unclean faces.
It was only meant to be a peck, but Steve couldn’t resist getting his arms around Tony and pulling him into his lap to give him a hungry, filthy kiss worth coming back to continue. When he finally let Tony pull away they were both panting for breath, and Steve could barely tear his attention from Tony’s swollen, spit-slick red lips.
Contrary to what people might believe, Steve was aware of how people perceived him. He had a lifetime of experience in being judged. As a kid, he’d been smaller and weaker than his peers, and his closet of hand-me-downs from kind neighbors and Salvation Army sales finds made his and his mom’s circumstances obvious everywhere he went. As an adult, people measured his tailored, brand-name clothes and his expensive car against his youth and treated him as a spoiled child of wealth who had side-stepped effort and hard work by coasting along on a trust fund and his good looks. A dim blond who wouldn’t open the New Yorker except to look at the pretty pictures. A man whose greatest aspirations were to host charity events for underprivileged youth in the Hamptons and to snare a trophy wife who could pop out three handsome kids (and at least two sons).
“Thanks for nothing, you worthless two-dollar whore, goddamn dirtfucking sack of piss-soaked shit,” he told the machine as he plucked off one ticket after another, “you scum-sucking son of a motherless goat.”
For the first time he felt an understanding for how important this part of Tony's life must have been for him. In his way, he could better appreciate Tony’s loss. It was tragic and heartbreaking, but still Steve he couldn't stop himself from smiling about realizing this unexpected connection between them.
“Good morning, all. We will make this quick—Thor,” he said in surprise, not having expected him there. “It is good to see you in the office again,” he amended without irony, but then with a stricter glance towards Bruce and Tony, he added, “Remember, if you feel unwell, you are under no obligation to attend these meetings. Your health must come first.”
On the tray there was also a large wooden box. Steve opened it slowly in case something tried to jump out, but the most dangerous surprise he found in there were a set of knitting needles. He eyed the knitting needles and all the yarn Tony had provided for him with suspicion, unsure of how this tied into this insane future. Tony hadn’t said anything about knitting requirements, but at this rate Steve wouldn’t be surprised if knitting a part of the mandated daily routine.
Steve eyed the two bags Tony had dropped on the coffee table dubiously. Neither of them looked particularly cheesecake-shaped. Guessing he had the slight advantage of being weak and needy, he turned his most pleading eyes up at Tony, his secret weapon since childhood. Back then, it was his sure-fire way of getting his mom to let him skip school. Now, he really needed it to shout
“I missed you, too, Sparky,” he teased, intentionally turning his head to mouth at Steve’s plump bottom lip with every word. “We’re not exactly in a state to invite more injuries. Let’s wash up and take this to bed, hm?”
He got back to his dorm at three, and didn’t open his eyes again until five hours later when the ringing phone woke him up. His Sweetheart was calling.
“It’s romantic,” Carol disagreed, and Rhodey jumped as if he’d been kicked under the table. “Maybe scale down on the flowers.”
cottage in disbelief, and silently he begged the gods to explain how the day could have turned on him like this. “But,” he stammered, too angry and shocked to patch his thoughts together properly. “This, this is
The phone went to voicemail, but before Steve got a chance to leave a message, he noticed Tony was calling him back. Steve connected the call, already smiling, when Tony croaked out, “Steve? Y’kay?”
“So am I,” Tony countered. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t at least try to—for Stephanie, I mean; she shouldn’t have to be bound to someone she doesn’t care for for life because of us. It can’t be too late for that, right?” he trailed off uncomfortably, and the uncertainty of what to believe, or what to do was enough to make him want to scream. Scream at himself, scream at the scary dragon that was napping, scream at Clint for letting it go this far without telling him what was happening.
Steve covered one of Tony’s hands with his own, and he gave it a grateful squeeze. “It’s only two more days, sweetheart,” he said in a calmer, steadier voice. “I can survive unwanted looks and words for two days.”
Steve was moving on to the kitchen, where a good camera could be positioned to record the dining room, when Bucky called him back.
“Listen,” Tony said, smiling but serious. “Steve and I were talking yesterday, and we thought—he’s got guest rooms, we wanted to invite you to the city. Why don’t you and Laura come this summer, get out of the heat? We’ll plan something nice.”
The thing was, Steve loved it when Tony stayed the night. They’d either cook or go out for dinner, then collapse together in bed to just let the day roll off their backs. Sometimes it was as quiet and peaceful as reading their own books or magazines, but as their nights together became less of an exception and more of a norm, they started watching TV shows together, too.
“I’ll die on your doorstep!” The voice threatened from the other side, “Have you seen a dead body, pal? You know what dead bodies DO? First thing: they evacuate everything. EVERYTHING! Shit and guts all over your doorstep, and I’ll make it extra shitty just for you. Is that what you want? You want me to—”
Steve was a model patient. He didn’t fuss, he did everything Tony asked him to, and even after the first week, Tony could comfort himself with Steve’s clear signs of improvement. Every day that passed, Tony left for work knowing Steve breathed more easily, and would come home in the afternoons to bigger, more brilliant smiles.
“I don’t know, but I think so?” Steve swallowed uncomfortably. He set down the couch and sat down on it near Tony, leaving a respectful distance between them. “I don’t have much experience. Besides kissing, I mean. But mom didn’t have serious problems, and I’m more human than dad. I have his strength and his senses, but not—I can’t fly, I don’t have heat vision or freezing breath. I don’t have x-ray vision. I can bleed.”
“Remember what the Captain said: we have two days,” Steve reminded his partner as he gathered up his coat and gloves. “Let’s find the man who sent that letter.”
“I mean that literally, Tony, it was a dream,” Steve tried to explain. “I didn’t—it wasn’t with anyone special, it wasn’t even conscious, I just… it was a recurring dream. A nice dream, but… I was alone. Who is more important than how.”
“Do you know who Steve, Steve Rogers’ roommate is?” Rhodey pressed. “Do you know if his roommate will report you for breaking the only rules they have while—”
Hours later in a warm bath and absolute silence, Tony stared at Detective Rogers’ business card. It could have been minutes or hours before Tony accepted that he would have to make the call if he wanted answers to the questions haunting him.
Steve scratched at the back of his head, and looked anywhere but at Tony. It had been a long hundred and forty some-odd years. But Tony, unaware of Steve’s source of frustration, cleared his throat again.
“I’m sure something changed in his schedule,” Steve said much too casually. “Maybe—maybe whoever he was meeting with wanted to meet in Brooklyn instead? Maybe he’d made a mistake when he said Harlem; it happens,” he decided, nodding to himself. It did, people made mistakes every day. People changed their minds every day, too.
“Do you still want to see the movie?” Steve asked quietly, anything to ignore the stupid nickname. “If you need to get back to work...”
“Where,” Steve demanded to know, but Bucky wouldn’t look away from the news on the TV to meet his eyes.
“I leave you alone one day, one date, and you get kidnapped. Scared the shit out of me... how do you feel?” Tony asked with a worried expression that made Steve ache for him.
“You want me to fuck you, Tony? Fill you with my come and send you back to the party, filthy with it? Come spilling down your thighs? If only I could sit you on my cock all night, sweetheart,” he moaned directly into Tony’s ear, “fuck you full of my come in front of them all… keep it all plugged up inside you, make you mine…”
“On your timeline, you’ll have to,” she agreed. “And if you don’t lock down a third date at the end of this one, cut him out. Move on.”
“What kind of a question—Steve!” Brock called after him, but Steve never stopped to listen to him again.
Tony helped Steve into the flatbed of the truck, and pulled together some of the horse blankets so that Steve could at least be comfortable even with his scratched up hands.
Steve leaned in close while Tony still had his fingers over his ears. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder in a silent expression of affection.
“You… you’re perfect, Tony, you feel amazing,” he moaned breathlessly into the soft skin of Tony’s throat as he was finally fully seated in the tight, slick clutch of Tony’s body. He paused there for a moment, rolling his hips experimentally before stilling and holding his position with care.
The Plaza Hotel. On a random Thursday, Tony was sending him beautiful flowers and stealing him away to the Plaza Hotel for pampering. It wasn’t so out of character for Tony to treat him to something special out of the blue, but even for them this was a lot.
“What?” Tony asked him with a confused quirk of his brow, but he quickly seemed to realize what Steve meant. With a laugh, he said, “No! No, I heard them fucking. You should’ve seen dad’s face the first time I called him ‘big daddy.’”
“The city’s small and concentrated, and the hotel can send the car as late as seven tonight,” Tony said as he resumed their earlier conversation and turned his phone around so Steve could see the map.
“It makes me happy,” Tony replied, like it was the simplest question in the world. “It reminds me of you.”
Suggested menu: Jalepeno Scramble, Fried Chicken, Avocado toast. Drinks: Eastside. Dessert: Sour cherry pie.
look up from the letter in his hands. Before Tony had a chance to reply, Bucky and Steve’s phones rang. They both rushed to answer, but Bucky reached his phone first.
She returned his smile and wished him luck before leaving Steve to his business. Steve looked into his cart and took a steadying breath.
“I don’t know, Sparky,” Tony said with exaggerated suspicion. He swept his soap lathered hand over Steve’s cock, balls, then the crack of his ass, forcing Steve to take a wider stance to steady himself so Tony rubbed his soaped up thumb slowly around the puckered rim. “That look of yours is filthy.”
books, Maria. He's a glorified spellchecker,” Howard scoffed, but Maria smacked her hand flat on the table, hard enough to rattle the vases of fresh flowers and the cutlery.
“Tony, hi!” he said with exuberant false cheer, as if Tony’s call was the biggest surprise of his lifetime. “What a, a great surprise. I thought you were busy tonight?”
Unbidden, Tony found himself remembering happy Harold Hogan’s smug chuckling from their recent conversation. He was a good man, and here Tony was, watching his friend fail in his last attempt to crawl to safety in a room full of law enforcement officers who could do nothing to help him. A number of officers collapsed from shock, and others wept openly; the stronger souls only doubled over as they were sick over the pristine marble floors from the revolting and unimaginable brutality.
But of the human fluids that had not been tested for practical use, saliva and sweat topped the list. Despite the risk, and knowing he would lose both his job and his license to harvest if he came back haunted with symptoms, Steve couldn’t resist the temptation. The risk was negligible compared to the overwhelming desire to receive what Tony seemed so desperate to give. He parted his lips as Tony pushed up enough to move past his chin and reach Steve’s mouth, and with lazy, sloppy imprecision, Tony’s lips slotted over Steve’s, spit, tongue, and all.
Tony choked on his scotch - the alcohol wasn’t nearly as smooth coming back up, and Jane pounded Tony on his back to help him clear his throat enough to breathe.
The elevator doors pinged open on the twelfth floor to let Tony out into the newsroom. The smell of fresh coffee and morning pastries warred with an invigorating rush of manic energy and typing. All around him Tony felt his colleagues working on the next big story. He was just like them; he was the worst of them. But for the first time in all his years at The Gotham Gazette, Tony didn’t blindly make a beeline for the next case or to finish the draft of a big story at his desk.
Tony didn’t know what it meant, but a chill ran through his veins. In the near distance, his mom was saying something about being Steve’s witness, but Steve looked ill. Whatever his dad had said to Steve had him scared, so scared the blood drained from his face.
A dozen men and women were already seated at the Governor’s table when Steve and Tony arrived. With a subtle nod from his assistant, Governor Pierce stood to greet them.
With a few grumbles and a lot of yawns, Tony reluctantly agreed that Steve was right and finally hung up. Steve pocketed his phone and sat down to read the card again. Just because Tony needed to rest didn’t mean Steve couldn’t be close to him.
The one farthest away frowned and asked, “Chi?” The woman in the middle, who may have been the younger of the two, shrugged in response and asked, “Kto ty?”
“No… it sounds so nice,” Steve mumbled, barely intelligible but very insistent. Listening to Tony’s voice, hearing his smiles, his laughter, and having his attention, all of it was infinitely better than being left with the thoughts swirling around in the forefront of his mind. “It’s still cold here,” he said then, clearing his throat so maybe Tony could hear him better.
Steve came to a halt in the middle of the suite as the decision solidified in his heart. This part of the night felt all wrong - he wanted to go home. Loose limbed and still a little dizzy from the long massage, Steve shuffled to the nearest phone to call the front desk and arrange a car to take him home.
“For the third point,” he began slowly, building the anticipation. “Steve, what would Tony most likely be doing if he wasn’t an actor?”
“Listen, Steve’s wouldn’t say it if he didn’t mean it. If he’s anything but a thoughtful, helpful, caring man, he’s hiding it
It took Tony all of a minute to feel absolutely rotten about his bitter thoughts. Steve worked hard, damnit, with his diving scholarship and his ROTC. How the man had a life outside of full class load, sports, and the reserve army Tony didn’t know, but he was grateful Steve was making the effort to carve out time for him.
With reluctant feet and a quiet sigh, Steve got up from the desk where he was doing real work to follow Jane. “Alright, fine. I’ll see you at six for dinner?”
“I come with news, Tony Stark,” she said in a secretive undertone, and offered Tony a tablet where several crime scene photos were already pulled up. “A most egregious crime occurred right after dawn, sir. I thought you might want to be informed.”
Steve watched him with a slow dawning horror, but Tony interrupted him before Steve even got a word out.
This time, when Tony stared at him, he was neither incredulous, nor on the verge of giggling. He stared in shock and open admiration. His positive reaction sustained Steve for some time, but as Tony’s silence dragged on, Steve started to feel less like a partner, and more like an object on display.
Steve stuffed three fingers into Tony’s mouth to silence and distract him, gripped Tony’s hip with his free hand, and with no other warning, he thrust his cock into Tony’s ass.
“Did you do this from scratch?” he wondered, peering at the pans full of bread baking at a glacial speed (by Steve’s estimate). “I didn’t know you could fit that many buns in the oven.”
“Yes and no,” Steve admitted, and he swore he heard the moment Tony’s playful mood calmed into careful attention at the other end of the line. “What’s going on?”
Hours later, when he stirred awake by the early signs of dawn, Steve made up his mind. He rolled Tony over again, letting the boy lie on his belly while Steve knelt between his spread legs. He had three more canisters to fill before they could go home.
“Stop right there, Steve,” his mom interrupted him again, this time more firmly. “No more calling it a compromise, and stop using ‘I’. Compromise means giving up on something. Think of your relationship as a collaboration: you’re building something new together with your partner. So, no more ‘I’: you need to talk to him,” Sarah added more gently. “You’re my son, baby. I will always be here. But this is between you and him.”
“Teeth,” Steve murmured, already half asleep on his feet. Tony chuckled quietly, but he obliged Steve with a gentle pat on his back.
“She listed her education in an early version of her modeling biography - it didn’t mention her interest in graduate school, but it says she finished a double major in plant botany and biochemistry at Princeton.”
Steve had barely understood Tony’s words before Tony started tugging on the waistband of his boxers. Steve lifted his hips without a second thought, helping Tony pull his underwear down and off his legs, leaving his straining, hard cock exposed.
The conversation took no more than a minute, and soon he was free to review Sharon’s notes on the hiring process, along with her preliminary investigation of their references. He typed up his reply to each of her reports, then finally sat down to slog his way through some prioritized manuscripts until the scheduled interview.
“Yeah, here and now with me,” Steve said with a smile. “You’re even wearing a suit, you look great. Just give the key to the valet.”
“He asked about the cases being picked up by different precincts?” Bucky said, echoing Steve in his disbelief. “That specific detail? Steve, are you sure we want to discount him as a suspect?”
“So he distracts the public with some charitable acts and you decide he’s a good person? We like to think we know people, but all of us wear masks. You never know who anybody is, and you know why?” he said between his second and third shot. “Because the second someone sees you for who you really are, they will use it against you.”
“You’re impossible,” Tony decided with a sniff, and with a final couple of bites, he pushed his plate away and slid off his stool. “Whatever. You win:
“Could we… talk? In private,” Tony asked as they stepped out of Dr. Odinson’s building, speaking in a measured voice, as if he was worried speaking at his normal speed might spook Steve somehow. “My place, your place, either way.”
Brock scrambled to wrapped his bath towel around his waist as Steve walked by, but neither Sharon nor Steve had to wonder why.
“No,” Steve disagreed, because there was no way a plane Tony designed for him would be that slow. But Bucky shook his head and quietly explained, “Steve, we can’t fly over Consone, we have to go around. We don’t even know if the King will be in Lumine.”
for support & looking these drafts over, because mannnnn this could have been so much more involved and convoluted. But the story is done, we did it!! I hope y'all enjoy!
tree house—that was emailed in the last week of December. Steve has made these plans three months in advance. Steve had been so sure they’d make it to six months that he’d paid—
Steve expression warmed with in his surprised delight, the way he always did when he realized he and Tony would be sharing a new experience together. He pressed his lips to Tony’s temple and breathed in the scent of his hair deeply before straightening again.
Tony knew what was expected of him, what his only option was if he wanted to survive unharmed. He squeezed his eyes shut and hugged the cushions desperately as the master made uncoordinated attempts to suck his come from his body. It didn’t seem to know what it was doing, and its blunt teeth kept scraping at his skin more forcibly as it grew increasingly frustrated with him. Desperately, Tony tried to push the monster away so he could roll over and offer it his leaking cock, but Steve had told him not to waste his come. Steve, who was all the way across the room chatting amiably with the other master and the handful of others who had arrived for the demonstration. He seemed unaware of this alien clawing at Tony’s soft thighs and twisting him into a painful, aggressive back-bend. The position left Tony struggling to catch his breath, but the master didn’t care - if anything, its renewed vigor suggested that it had finally found a position it thought would provide the rare, raw come made in Tony’s prized body.
Later that day, it went without question that Tony would help Steve home from set. Some of the crewmen helped Tony pack his limping co-star into his Jeep, strap him in, then stood on the curb and waved goodbye as Tony drove them off into the sunset without a clue.
Steve was silent after the woman’s explanation, then in irritated bewilderment, he turned to Tony with a shrug, as if to say, ‘so what?’
“With all due respect, Steve,” Rhodey replied as diplomatically as he could while both irritated and exhausted. “I’m not sleeping while Tony is out here working.”
“You made time,” Steve said gently, but Tony could only roll his eyes. That was literally the least he could have done.
For the first time in a long time, Steve got out of bed with a smile on his face. He washed his face, spent a few minutes recording a reply to his family, then texted Coulson to let him know he was getting ready for the day.
By contrast, from its shared history with Bavaria and Bohemia, Machtberg embraced Christmas with vibrant markets and hardy food. Antique gilded carousels were assembled in parks and town squares all across the kingdom, inviting families to celebrate the festivities of the season. Everywhere the smell of flavorful sausages, roasting chestnuts, and mulled wine filled the air, and no expense was spared to add the sparkle of excitement in every child’s eyes.
One look at Steve, and Tony knew he had passed out. He looked at the bottles more carefully, set his alarm to remind him when Steve’s next round probably was, and tucked Steve into bed. Tony didn’t know why Steve was determined to stay away from the hospital, but at least he was resting peacefully now. Maybe that was better for him than stressing out in a hospital.
,” Steve tried to explain in a perfectly reasonable tone of voice, but when Tony gave him a sly look and rocked his hips, Steve found himself breathless for more than one reason. “Why, is sex only a nighttime activity in your life? I wanted to take my time with you, undress you in daylight. Look at you, Tony,” he whispered, skimming his palms over Tony’s thighs to frame his hips. “Can you blame me?”
“I vote against waxing,” Tony finally whispered, his words pregnant with a soft, needful moan. “Trim, contour, sure; I even know a guy. Nobody has a body like yours. But this,” he said, scraping blunt nails through the hair over Steve’s abdomen. “You don’t understand how fucking hot you are.”
At first Tony was absolutely silent in his surprise. For a man whose only physical contact had been limited to family all of his life, being so intimately touched confused him deeply, until it was over. Then, more than in his first moments of shock, did Tony recognize what he wanted.
Slowly, his breathing calmed and his mind cleared. Carefully, without moving the rest of his body, Tony tried wiggling his foot. He couldn’t gain an inch any way he tried, the damn root held - but at least the worst of the pain was already subsiding. With a little luck, nothing was broken.
The first time he had shared with Tony that he had been thinking about the taste of Tony’s cock to the point of distraction, how he had dreamed about the feel of him on his tongue, or the burn of friction down his throat if Tony would ever fuck his mouth, Tony thought it was a hallucination. He’d stared back at Steve, a dominant top if Tony had ever met one, and wondered if April 1st was making a winter-time encore just at Tony’s expense.
“So strong,” Tony murmured with a soft slur, still foggy from his nap and warm from the wine. “I love you, did you know?”
“Good, then that’s settled,” Steve decided with a relieved smile. He pressed another kiss to Tony’s hair before stepping away, taking the shirt with him as he walked back into his closet to dig out the ironing board.
So the week after Tony’s safe return, Steve flew to Eisenturm to take Tony to dinner. It was the most difficult decision he’d ever made outside of the war, but even so, Steve had to do it in person. He loved Tony too much to end their relationship by phone.
“Unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one night stand and sperm donation in order to determine if a child resulted from those unions, I don’t see how he has parental claim over this child. Why this sperm? Why now? And for that matter, if any sperm emission is cause for parental rights, all acts of masturbation where his sperm was not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment.”
To all of you who responded to the first chapter and shared your ideas and suggestions with me, I can't thank you enough!! Thank you so much for your response to this fic! I hope it continues to be an enjoyable read for you all! <33
He wasted no time pulling his sweater over his head and unbuttoning his jeans. Tony unstopped the tub and turned the shower head on, so by the time Steve had tossed the ring boxes safely on top of his pile of clothes and stepped in beside him, they could stand together under the warm spray, indulging in the intimate canopy that kept the rest of the world at bay.
“You probably should,” Bruce agreed, and Tony stretched to swat his arm. Bruce winced and momentarily stuck his bottom lip out. “Alright, I’m out. Meet back here at seven?”
“I don’t actually think I’ve seen irises before, I’ve never been this close to them,” Steve admitted, a touch bashful. There was nothing embarrassing with this being his first time near irises, or even being a man who received flowers. But if you’d asked him the night before, Steve would never have thought that being surprised with flowers - and such thoughtful flowers, where someone clearly took the time to find flowers the same color as his eyes - could make him feel
In the end, Tony stood up in the tub and let gravity do the work for him. The warm water from his bath trickled down his shoulders, smoothing down the natural planes and curves of his arms and his chest, until a few drops landed on Steve’s hands.
Tony had learned not to move no matter how badly he wanted to turn and face Steve. On nights he woke Steve from his nightmares, Tony had learned that Steve often slept badly, or still remembered the episode when he woke. So he practiced patience. He wouldn’t touch Steve’s grasping hand first, but he would gently caress his arm, smoothing a hand over Steve’s firm bicep and the corded muscles of his forearm. It took time, but the warmer he managed to make Steve feel, the more of that unwanted tension seeped away. When finally Steve’s bicep relaxed under Tony’s cheek, and his hand lay limp with sleep over Tony’s lower back, Tony reached back to cover Steve’s hand with his, lacing their fingers together. Without letting go, Tony slowly slid their joined hands under his pajamas and underwear to guide Steve to softly cup and squeeze his bare ass. Unconventional or not, the bare touch of Tony’s ass was so familiar and intimate that wherever Steve had been in his dreams, he still returned to cherished, loving memories.
Tony rushed back to his place where he washed up and strapped into his uniform in record time. On the way out, he instructed Steve on how to navigate the building - operating the elevator by spoken commands, exiting the building with a retinal scan, and finding the space where private conveyances were returned.
Tony slipped his hand further into Steve’s, and as Steve had asked, he led the way down Harrington. As promised, it was only a block away from Maitre Choux. Tony told him about the projects he had been folded into at work, and the handful of graduate students he was supporting through their dissertations. One of them was even working on solar powered continuous glucose monitor that Tony was really excited about, though they still had work to do on the software.
Steve had never seen so many cocks in the same place at the same time. Not even in gay porn did you get such a high density of cocks per square inch as in Chapter 6 of his
She was gone for thirty seconds when from across the room Steve threw the curtain aside in indignant outrage. “
“You city folk get so sensitive about compliments,” she said with a roll of her eyes and a shake of her head. Then, as if nothing had happened, she changed the subject by putting the shopping bags down on Tony’s workbench. “Here, Tony. One of these should fit. Now, I don’t want to see your underwear showing the rest of the time you’re home, you hear me? I raised you better than that.”
“Tony—” Steve gasped between needful kisses, squeezing Tony closer against his body even as he tried to be responsible. “Dinner, Tony—”
. “You’re an investigative journalist, Steve. Do you honestly think it’s something that innocent? He is
Maybe Steve shouldn’t have been so touched that a machine missed him (hell, maybe he should have been creeped out?), but he gently rubbed Dum-E’s arm in greeting. “I’m happy to see you, too,” he said quietly. The whisper of a human voice caught Tony’s attention, and he sat up in his confusion.
Bruce blinked owlishly at the Chief Director’s back. He glanced at his partner as if to ask for help, but he’d spoken out of line too recently to dare disagree with a direct order. “Yes, sir.”
“No pockets, huh?” Tony teased as they finally emerged to rejoin the party. They were just making their way back as they realized Sam and Sharon were standing at a podium in front of the whole crowd.
“Oh, for—what if we never find her?” Tony snapped. “It’s been centuries! You don’t think anyone has ever tried?”
“Seven months, Steve,” Tony reminded him, rolling onto his back. Steve followed his motion without thinking, slotting in between Tony’s thighs and settling on top of him like he had never left. Tony grinned up at him in his mischief, bringing his legs up to gently squeeze Steve’s sides between his thighs.
Tony licked his lips without taking his eyes off of Steve. “And then when?” he whispered, grinding his teeth against the pitiful tone he hadn’t meant to share.
“No shaking after fucking,” he mumbled half-heartedly, pushing himself up carefully. It took him a minute to notice the time, too. “What’s—oh,
He probably had a point, and they probably had ways of making their request less pleasant, but Tony had never been very good with being told what to do.
Steve’s sudden urgency alarmed Tony into reflexive action. Without thinking, he pulled the car to the side of the road and switched on the hazard lights. They were still only minutes from Pierce’s offices, and Tony opened his mouth to ask what had happened, if perhaps Steve had forgotten his gloves or if he was suffering another panic attack at the thought of a repeated prison sentence. As before, Steve held his tongue, and without a word, he climbed out of the vehicle.
A week later, Bucky had a comfortable, functioning metal arm he’d warmed up to, and Steve had a floundering, half-assed plan for romance.
“You’re serious,” Tony marveled in a whisper after an agonizing silence. “You have feelings for me?”
Thor shrugged a little, looking inexplicably small in his large red jumper. He shook his head once, but he struggled to find words he was comfortable speaking.
Sensing a tension from his new ward, Tony lowered his voice to address him urgently.  “Captain Steve Rogers, enhance your calm. This will not take long.”
“What?” Clint complained from where he still sat in the moist grass, then in a louder voice he called after Tony again. “Wait, what’d I say!“
Half of it slid into Tony smoothly, but there was enough resistance where Steve’s fingers hadn’t reached that prevented it from slipping in without force. Tony held his breath but kept his knees spread wide as Steve pushed it in further, until Tony’s thighs quivered and a good six to seven inches of the canister was inside Tony’s body. With a press of his finger, Steve warmed it a few degrees and turned on a soft thrum vibration; young and responsive as he was, Tony’s breath hiccuped with the added sensations, and Steve watched on with satisfaction as Tony’s fingers began digging into the mattress again. As Tony’s soft whimpers and whines turned into murmured pleas and cries for
Steve practically wriggled in his seat in his excitement to get in on the story-telling. “You have no idea—I am so upset I wasn’t there when you hung up on him!” he said with tears bright in his eyes.
The door creaked open, and both of them looked up. Finally, it was Tony who came in. It took him a moment to spot Steve and Bucky at the bar, but when he did, his face warmed with a smile and he made his way to them easily.
“Why? You’re not my fucking dad.” Peter said hotly, anger pooling deep in him. “What gives you guys the right to tell me what I can and can’t do?”
Peter felt groggy when he woke up, but vaguely realised he was laying down, still in the common room, but laying down on the couch. He was about to sit up and look for Clint or someone else when he heard a voice.
“Miss me, beautiful?” Tony grinned as he popped his head around the corner, then walked up to the cart, assessing the contents.
Tony didn’t say anything as he watched Peter put on his shoes but did smile again when the boy turned around before leading him into the elevator and pressing the button down to the medical wing.
Steve paused, blinked a few times and for a second there was tense, unyielding silence before Steve sat in front of the boy (who was still squinting at the man in disbelief) with his legs crossed and his hands in his lap.
“Me too, I shouldn’t have shouted or got angry and I’m sorry,” Tony said after him, also calm and collected.
“But finding something permanent that is equipped to deal with that kind of trauma could take months.” Pepper countered. “He’ll need some sort of legal care here until that happens.”
“He tried to burn down the fucking kitchen making toast,” Tony muttered, pursing his lips before taking another sip of his drink.
“Not usually as bad as this.” Tony just nodded, and then that’s when Steve returned with a cup of ice water and a few squares of chocolate. Once Peter had consumed both, he laid back down and pulled his Star Wars bedding back over his body.
Steve grinned, then dumped them into the shopping cart, turning to the other side of the aisle at the throws.
"Yes. I just said that." Steve responded, trying not to grow frustrated at Tony's insistent questioning and diversion to the matter.
“You’re full.” Steve pressed fondly, scratching his fingers through Tony’s hair as the latter leant against him in just his pyjama pants.
“So, on school nights, your curfew is ten pm, and on weekends it is eleven. Okay?” Tony asked, and Peter glanced up.
“If you want, Pete, we could start testing your limits?” Tony asked, pouring himself another mug of coffee.
They sat through the appointment as Stephen carried it out in relative silence save for Peter answering Stephen’s questions and when it was finished just after his blood pressure was taken, he stood up from the bed and smiled tightly at Stephen when he handed over some more antibiotics and pain relief for his mostly healed jaw.
Peter raised a small, hesitant smile before cracking the bones in his knuckles in nervousness because he had nothing to do with his hands.
Sam glared at him, but started the game anyway, only muttering a few unintelligible curse words under his breath.
Peter wants to be glad, wants to shout ‘thank fuck for that’ and get to sleep without a nurse prodding him awake every two hours to hear his breathing. But he just raises a forced smile and settles down under his blanket heap again.
“I make it,” Peter said quickly, flexing one wrist as if to prove it. Tony’s eyebrows raised in surprise.
Bruce didn’t say anything then, observing for just a moment before turning back to the computer to evaluate what he should do.
Although Tony and Steve had brought him new clothes, Peter hadn’t been wearing a lot of them. Whilst on the streets, he’d kept his clothes in pretty good condition so his t-shirts were only faded with minimal holes, and his jeans were pretty badly faded and there was a rip in the knee of one pair that he passed as fashionable enough to still wear.
“And also, to say that Mexican place was amazing.” Tony adds again, grinning. “I’m favourable to the tacos.”
“So, Peter, I’ve noticed that your school has reported you absent for the last two months,” Tony stated, looking at him dead in the eye. “You went to Midtown High, right? That’s a tough school to get into.”
Tony and Steve chatted about nothing as they walked down the hallway to the elevator, the ride down to the garage and all the way through the garage until they got to a sleek grey Mercedes. Peter tried not to look at it as Tony went around to the driver’s side and opened the door because it was obvious the car was worth a lot of money and he was wearing jeans he hadn’t washed in at least a week.
Feeling too choked up to talk, he just nodded and slid further down into the covers, still not making eye contact with either of them.
Both Steve and Tony bid him farewell before stepping into the elevator behind Peter who was leaning against the back of it with tired eyes.
Peter gazed around all of the different options, feeling the tight feeling come back in his chest just from all the options and the prices that came next to it.
He was sat on a pristinely made cot-bed that had a comfier mattress and sheets then he’d ever had, with his rucksack on his lap, clutching onto the straps as he watched Tony Stark murmur something inaudible to Bruce Banner, even with his super hearing.
But he simply just ran a comb through his drying curls and then slid his new phone into his back pocket.
So, he simply nodded, and he held out his arm so Bruce could extract a few vials of his blood, not even flinching at the pinch of the needle.
The blond began moving towards the bed but then faltered with the next words that came out of the boy’s mouth.
“Morning Peter.” Peter could tell Bruce tried sounding as cheery as possible as he came through the door of Peter’s room on the medical wing with Tony, Steve and a man he didn’t recognise all following behind him.
“Stay here.” Steve found himself saying. “Just for a couple of hours while we contact your family, okay? We won’t hurt you; I promise.”
“I’m good thanks, I’ll start on lunch,” Steve replied, stepping back away from the group to the kitchen.
Clint’s body relaxed slightly as if he hadn’t realised he was uncomfortable and gave Peter a gentle smile.
“Uh, yes, it was good.” Tony smiled, and Peter didn’t say anything, too interested in the artwork on the walls.
Peter nodded, trying not to make it too jerky, and shifted on each foot as he took in the room fully.
“Well your blood tells us that your glucose levels are a little lower than I’d like, and so are your iron and calcium levels.” Bruce looked from the computers to Peter with a small frown. “Have you been experiencing dizzy spells? Moments of breathlessness?  Fatigue?”
“There is nothing to be sorry for, kid,” Tony responded softly and laid down flat next to him, though he didn’t cover his face.
“Hey, Pete?” Peter hummed in Steve’s general direction. “Which of these sheets do you like? We need to get you more than just the set in your room right now.”
He handed the tub to Peter and sat again, gesturing for the boy to open the tub and then promptly shoving his spoon inside and grabbing a spoonful of chocolate ice cream and marshmallows.
And if Peter thought the elevator ride was bad, that was nothing compared to the journey in the car. The atmosphere was tense, and Peter stayed silent throughout, body clenched as he observed Steve’s fidgeting and Tony’s hands gripped on the steering wheel.
“Why don’t you come with us and we’ll go and get some pain relief for you, maybe some food, I’m starving.”
“Peter, I never wanted to have to restrain you, but you were trying to hurt yourself and I don’t want you to that ever again.” Steve states and Peter blushes at the moment of vulnerability mentioned. “Promise us that you will let us help you?”
Peter watched as Steve rolled his eyes again, picking up one of the napkins he brought to wipe mayonnaise off Tony’s chin.
They waited out the next twenty minutes in relatively comfortable silence, waiting for all the children to get inside their lessons before Tony and Steve pulled on caps and sunglasses (making Peter roll his eyes) and they stepped out of the car.
Tony snorted, then stuck his hands in the pockets of his jeans, grinning at Peter before mumbling about it being a fair point.
There was a moment of silence where no one said anything and all that was heard was the sizzling of the pan that was on the stove.
“The food. I know it’s nothing to you. But-But I can’t choose and it’s a lot of money-“ Peter felt hot tears of frustration pooling behind his eyes.
“That was sort of the plan. We’d foster you, and we’re pretty equipped to deal with superhero shit – sorry for my language Stevie – and you’d stay with us whilst we sorted out your legal forms and found you someone to live with permanently who can cope with your needs.” Tony explains, not looking over to Steve who glares at him as Tony swears.
“When police got to his house after neighbours reported they heard a commotion, police found Garett unconscious on the floor surrounded by: quote ‘hundreds of beer cans and blood’ unquote. When taking him in for questioning, he stated he didn’t know where the two kids where, but prodding found that Mary had been returned to Queens Sunflower Orphanage only a few hours before, but Peter was nowhere to be found.” Tony read off quietly, before saying. “That was a month ago.”
On the end of the bed perched a cream throw and resting on top of that was a dark blue fluffy dressing gown and a pair of slippers in the same colour. On either side of the bed sat two bedside tables, each with a lampshade on it and above his bed was a shelf which had a few books along it. On the other side of the room was a small dressing table with a mirror perched on the top of it and a row of draws on the left-hand side, but that was empty (presumably for any hygiene products he may use). Parallel to his bed was a tv, and Peter didn’t even want to think about how much that cost.
Sure, he’d felt guilty after every time he chose a shirt or a pair of jeans and they were added to the pile, but mostly he just shut his eyes and thanked every god he could think of.
So, he’d not been wearing a lot of his new clothes, save for a top every now and then. Taking a deep breath, he reached out for a pair of new jeans that were black and skinny, with rips in the knees (intentional). He also grabbed a red sweater that was slightly baggy and some underwear and socks.
“I’ll be careful, I’ve been doing it since I was fourteen, and it will be quicker instead of the early morning traffic.”
“Ready to go, kid? We thought we could go out and get some stuff for your room or some more clothes if you want?” Steve asked, eyes shining and warm.
“Uh, I don’t know. I’m fine with anything.” He muttered, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pocket and trying not to look at either of the men.
“N-no. Fuck off.” Peter tried pushing Tony away, but in his weak nature he just kind of pushed himself away from the man and he stumbled backward, where Steve moved quickly to catch him.
“You want me, the homeless boy who fell through your ceiling, to live with you guys?” Peter asked, smirking at just the mere thought.
When he was finally back in his room, he dug through his bottom drawer and pulled out his suit, grinning like a mad man as he shoved it into a backpack. Part of him was tempted to just swing out of his bedroom window but even he knew that he had to be discreet when leaving Stark Tower; it was always watched.
On top of that, he had three nightmares and barely gotten any sleep, so instead spent the remaining hours of the night having Jarvis read him Chemistry textbooks and studies, even going as far as reading some famous papers on interesting subjects.
And as Peter watches Marlin and Nemo reunite, Peter thinks back on the time when his Uncle Ben and Aunt May had promised him that if he was ever lost, that they would find him and make sure he knew he was loved.
The entirety of the living room, kitchen, and dining room were open plan, the kitchen raised on a platform that you could get to by a small set of stairs all around the platform. The kitchen was mostly pristine marble and fancy equipment that Peter was too nervous too even look at, and he then moved his eyes over to the living room.
Swinging through the city brought a smile to his face that could only ever be achieved by doing this, he let out a hearty whoop as he flipped up and onto the roof of a nearby building, panting a little after his small twenty-minute workout. Usually, he wouldn’t be this out of breath, but he figured that he was still recovering from a chest infection so it wasn’t too bad.
Now they were sat warm and full and Peter could feel his eyes drooping, even if he loved the movie, because of his lack of sleep. He shifted slightly, so he was in a slightly more comfortable position and rested his head back against a thick cushion.
Peter just smiles at them again, and lets Stephen put the thermometer in his ear to check his temperature before murmuring a small: “Glad you liked it.”
The ‘finished’ sign came upon Sam’s screen to show that his car had lost, and he threw his hands up in rage.
“Won’t people recognise you? Y’know, being superheroes n’stuff.” Both Steve and Tony turned to look at him as they walked into the mall, frowns on their faces.
All eyes were on him now, and he sunk slightly lower in his seat, toying with his food with his fork.
“And we promise to try our hardest to talk to you like this instead of getting angry in the future.”
“Take it easy.” Steve murmured, handing him a water bottle, but Peter’s hands were so shaky that he couldn’t grip it properly. Tony took it from him and held it to his lips, letting him drink as much as he needed before pulling it away.
“Which is why we’re gonna set a curfew, so everyone is clear about when you need to be home, no matter where you are, and if you miss that you understand that you have messed up.”
Peter stilled, entire body locked and frozen, and he found that no words would come out, despite how much he wanted to scream at everyone about everything in his life that was unfair.
He knocked on the window gently, but the boy still jumped and turned sharply to where the noise came from, but relaxed and grinned when he saw the familiar face peeking behind the window.
“I’ll go and get you some water.” Steve murmured quietly and left quickly to get the required refreshment, leaving the two brunettes in silence. Tony watched as Peter sniffed once and then twice, lying back down so he was flat with his hands covering his face.
“We know it’s hard for you, and we’ll try and make everything as easy as possible because we care, okay. So much.” Steve didn’t break eye contact the entire time and smiled softly when he finished. Peter blinked, rapidly fending off tears as he pulled his knees to his chest as he nodded.
“How about you leave your shirt on? You can flip it around so Dr. Strange can listen to your back and then he can put it under your shirt?” Steve asked, voice gentle, all soft and warm and the kind of thing that made Peter want to cry because it reminded him of aunt may.
Peter squirmed, cheeks also flushing red but answered quickly: “It’s okay. I- uh- got a full paid scholarship.”
“Did you sleep well?” Bruce tried again, going over to his workbench and snapping on some gloves, before turning to face his patient.
Peter doesn’t say anything, just looks over to the other side of the room where his bed is now made primly and he tugs his ankle a little to make sure that his foot is still wrapped around his ratty backpack.
“Woah kid, come on, back to bed.” It was Tony by his side, gently hovering his hands around Peter so that if he fell, he would be caught.
Thankfully, Steve and Tony weren’t in here with him and were waiting outside for him whilst he had his hour-long appointment.
He took it easy going to Neds, swinging safely and slowly until he reached the apartment building Ned lived at. Crawling up easily to Ned's bedroom window, he grinned as he watched his best friend sat at his desk studying, knowing he would be back doing that soon.
“We only want to help you, you know that, right?” Tony asked softly, and Peter looked straight ahead before responding.
“No.” He protested shakily, trying to grip at the arms he could only presume were Steve’s that were encasing him to his chest.
She studied him for a second, just one, and that was all it took for Peter to start squirming in his seat as his face flushed red and his hands to bury deep in his pockets.
“Jesus Christ, these kids are irritating,” Tony muttered irritably from where he was sat behind the wheel of the car, arms folded across his chest and head thrown back onto the headrest.
It wasn’t what he imagined Tony Stark’s living room to look like. There were plush grey couches that could easily fit eight or so people as well as multiple armchairs, most of which probably cost more than he was worth. But there were hand-knitted blankets in various colours strewn about and scatter cushions that were pressed into the couch cushions from use.
Peter could feel his temper rising, hands clutching at his sides, eyes squinting at the over confident doctor.
He’s been in the system for half a year, and his only experience so far has been shit. Sure, living here would mean he has to be more careful with his stuff and what he did and said, especially since they could be just as bad as the other foster parents.
Tony narrowed his eyes, pursed his lips and folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn child who was refusing to go to sleep. God, Steve loved his boyfriend but he could be stubborn as hell.
“We’ll go shopping for more things for your room and some clothes when you get off the ward.” Steve said, smiling.
“We’re leaving at eleven to go and see Annie, your therapist.” Peter paused, debated turning around and shouting fuck off, but instead he didn’t respond and just walked over to the sink to rinse off his plate before setting it into the dishwasher and heading back to his room.
“So, I was thinking you’d maybe like to go out for dinner?” Tony asks, “There’s a good Thai place not too far from here. We can take the secret exit from here in ‘disguises’ and walk?”
Peter didn’t respond, looking away towards the table of activities that he presumed were for her younger patients, judging by the doll’s house and Lego across it.
Peter scoffed, “Screw you.” He spat, then turned around and flew open the door to the stairs and slammed it shut behind him.
“Sometimes it feels like it, I swear Stevie.” Peter snorted, digging his hands deep in his jean’s pockets.
“He is aware of Steve’s faster metabolism and can treat it effectively, and because your powers seemed to be similar, we called Dr. Strange in.”
Steve could sense Natasha going to pick the boy up, keep him detained whilst they got answers and he raised his hand to halt any kind of movement or speech from anyone in the room.
“No.” Peter immediately refused, eyes cold and unyielding on the subject. He wasn’t letting people he’d just met take blood that would undeniably come up as strange thanks to his special mutation.
It was true, how could they kid themselves? The child was sleeping in the air vents, wrapped up in a sleeping bag. He wasn’t doing that as a choice, it was a necessity of not being frozen to death in the cold nights of what was proving to be a horrid November.
“Mostly bio-chem courses. I like maths too.” He paused and then added. “Though I highly doubt I’ll need trigonometry in my daily life.”
Oh, that made sense. Peter thought about telling the man he wasn’t hungry and that he was fine, but he could always eat more and the man seemed tense and uncomfortable.
“Kid, whilst it may have never happened before, it could happen again.” He says gently, eyes soft. “We need to know you will let us help you if it does.”
“Is it okay if I set you up to an IV? It will distribute some supplements to get your blood sugar levels back up as well as administering some pain relief that you won’t burn through in ten minutes.” Bruce smiled and then smiled a little wider when Peter only hesitated a few seconds before offering his arm out.
Peter shook his head, a lie, but didn’t feel bad about it in the slightest as he looked away from Bruce to look at the ceiling and the slow movements of the fan.
Peter jerks slightly when he’s fully aware of his surroundings, pulling his legs off Steve and sitting up straight.
“Uh, yeah I am. I told Ned I was coming back, and he was pretty excited which was pretty nice.” Peter answered as he tapped his fingers against his glass, smiling to himself.
That was the point where Steve came over with a tray that held two burgers and a pretzel covered in cheese. Taking the cardboard container from the man with a small smile, he slowly ate the food, trying not to appear too eager or hungry for real warm food.
“Okay, kiddo,” Tony said immediately, sitting back down and getting under the covers next to the teen. “We’ll stay.”
“Well, nice to meet you, Peter. You seem to have a pretty bad fracture there, how did you get it?” Bruce asked, rolling over on the small stool from the desk that was there to the bed Peter was sat on.
“About eight in the morning, you’ve slept for about sixteen hours kiddo,” Tony answered him, setting down a tray of food on the bed next to him.
And on reflex, Peter flinched and shielded his face with his hands, letting out a cry of “I’m sorry!”
Last night after Peter had stormed off, he’d immediately gone to his room and stayed there throughout the evening and dinner. He’d not responded to anything Steve or Tony had said to him, and he debated not responding now, but before he could even consider it Steve was speaking again.
They had also talked about school, and in a few days, they were going to go to his school and talk about getting him enrolled about two weeks before the Christmas break so he could get settled. He was actually excited about going back, so much so that he’d asked Jarvis to read him some chemistry textbooks before he goes to bed.
Peter didn’t say anything, eyeing the blond man very carefully for a few seconds before speaking in a slow voice.
He nodded again and then sat back, letting Steve, Tony and Mrs. Lowitz talk about what else they could do to help out and details of the private tutor.
“I think it’s caused you to contract a bacterial chest infection, which is easily enough treated with antibiotics.” He then eyed Peter thoughtfully. “How’s your diet been in the past few months.”
“Is there anything for me to do in here?” He asked, clutching his hands around the scratchy hospital blankets. “You know, for fun?”
Peter’s head snapped to Bruce then, mouth pursed. For a moment, Peter could tell the others thought he was about to shout at Bruce and state that he didn’t need to be looked at like he had multiple times yesterday on the way down to the medical wing from the meeting rooms.
“Sort of, just something legal that will make sure he is cared for while he is here. Otherwise, Peter could go to the police and say he is being held hostage or has been kidnapped. Not that he seems like the type of kid to do that just to be spiteful.”
Peter felt as though he should be more nervous than he was, but in reality, coming back to school was a nice break of familiarity between everything else in his life. He missed having something he could rely on that he enjoyed.
“We think so, she specialises in child trauma and is free for two sessions a week, so she’s ideal,” Steve responds, clear as day, as though the person he is talking about isn’t about ten feet away.
When the hour ended, Peter felt he had been there all day and was all too happy to swing his bag over his shoulder and follow Annie out the room to where Steve and Tony were waiting and talking quietly. They both stood up when he rounded the corner.
“I thought we made progress, which is really positive for our first meeting.” She smiled warmly. “What did you think, Peter?”
“I’m, uh, also coming back to school.” Peter smiled shyly at him, and then laughed softly when Ned's face lit up.
“So, Peter, Tony tells me you go to Midtown High?” Bruce asked from next to him, pushing his glasses up his face. “That’s a difficult school.”
“That is not the point and you know it,” Steve said firmly, making Peter roll his eyes. “Don’t roll your eyes at me.”
“I’m not that hungry, thank you,” Peter muttered quietly, making the smiles on the two older men turn slowly into frowns and they sat forward in worry.
God, how much of a dick was he? Of course, other people had gone through what he has, he wasn’t the only person out there struggling with money. And worse, he had presumed that Steve was pretending to know what was going on because he was living a life of luxury now.
Peter tried not to let too much excitement show on his face at the idea of being at school again, with Ned and MJ. So, he just smiled a little and nodded.
Peter looked up where Steve was gazing over some sets of sheets all ranging in colours and patterns. He raised his eyebrows, feeling his chest become tight once more.
Peter thought quietly to himself as he sat curled up on the couch next to Steve and Tony as they watched ‘
Steve slid his phone into his back pocket and smiled at Peter before walking around the kitchen island so he could slide on his coat that was resting on the arm on one of the many couches.
And the only notice he gave them that he was angry, was that he slammed his bedroom door so forcefully the drawers in the chest of drawers rattled.
Then they were gone, walking back into the elevator discussing new training regimes and whatnot and it was just him and Clint.
“Stevie! You forgot to ask for my burger without pickles.” Tony whined, pouting at the two pickle slices resting on top of his lettuce.
“I went out,” Peter replied bluntly, putting his hands in his pockets with his eyebrows still raised.
“Uh, around three.” Steve checks his watch. “You were asleep for about an hour and half, maybe two? We’re watching some story about toys now.”
“The big deal is you didn’t tell anyone! What if you got hurt? We didn’t know where you were!” Steve replied all in one, tone irritated.
When the trio had returned home after what was an amazing meal, they split up to head to respective beds. After Steve and Tony had watched the new episode of ‘the great British bake off’, they’d retired to turning off the main light and getting changed into pyjamas.
“If I may, sir, Captain Rogers is hearing Peter Parker, who appears to be in distress,”  JARVIS repeated monotonously, which made both men bolt upright in bed.
Peter didn’t say anything, but smirked, the first smile that he had uttered towards anyone in the last hour.
“We’re really sorry about that, we know you don’t like shouting, so we are sorry for getting angry and shouting,” Tony said softly, followed by Steve.
“Well we were concerned when Peter did stop coming to school, you were the top of the class and doing brilliantly.” She looked at him, smiling softly.
Around half way through, at around ten, there’s a quick knock on the door and Peter barely has time to pause the film before Stephen Strange is walking in with Steve and Tony in tow.
After dressing, he slipped on some of the new trainers that he’d been provided with, and tried not to cringe at his reflection in the full-length mirror. It’s not that he didn’t like the new clothes, there was nothing more that he wanted to do than wear all of his new stuff every day and burn his old stuff, but he didn’t want Steve and Tony to think he was taking advantage of them.
“His blood sugar levels are low, extremely so. And judging by how skinny he is he seems to not have had a decent meal in a while. Even as a growing teenager, he needs a lot to eat, but also with his enhancements he probably needs more food than Steve on a good day.”
“Okay, okay,” Steve muttered, following Tony. “You’d think you were the one with the enhanced metabolism or something,”
“No, you fucking signed me up for therapy without asking me and then shared my trauma with your friends over coffee!”
Peter didn’t quite know how he got to the point where he was eating breakfast with the entirety of the avenger’s team on a random Thursday in November; yet here he was, staring at the mountains of scrambled eggs, platters of crispy bacon and stacks of fluffy pancakes that Steve had made that morning and the earth’s mightiest heroes delve into it like they hadn’t eaten in months.
“I think you’re the only sixteen-year-old who does.” Clint snorted, and Peter blushed again, shoving a piece of pancake in his mouth. Thankfully, the subject moved onto the new training schemes Tony had set up and were available for test runs, and Peter listened carefully, still eating.
“Successful shopping trip?” Bruce asked cheerfully when they bumped into one another down the hallway.
Steve had offered for Peter to go out and meet up with his friends after they got out of school, but Peter was too tired, so he just asked if they could watch a movie and they had agreed.
“How about, we all go out and I’ll have Jarvis lock the door and notify you if someone tries to come in and then make sure you are awake if someone comes within five feet of your bed?” Clint tries, voice calm.
Today was currently a Monday, so that gave him a week to prepare himself for school and to tell Ned and MJ that he was coming back.
“Look, I didn’t hear anything. You can just let me go and I won’t talk to anyone – I know better than to mess with you guys.” He then paused, gazing around at the rubble from his fall. “If you want me to work to make up for the damage, I can do that too.”
“Okay, well do you mind telling us why you were in our vents?” The kid didn’t reply as quick that time, obviously deciding what to say as he looked Steve right in the eye.
Maybe he didn’t want to go because he didn’t want to admit that he was having trouble sleeping without seeing Aunt May, or maybe it was because he wanted to just think everything was normal for a few days. Either way, he didn’t want to go.
Slowly, Peter lowered his hands when he realised what had just come out of his mouth and blinked a few times before looking up slowly to see everyone’s face. Sam was completely still, eyes wide and eyebrows raised.
Also, I talk about the American schooling and grading systems in this book but I'm British so I know fuck all but what I know from glee pretty much. If there's anything wrong feel free to tell me :)
“But what? What excuse could you possibly have for talking about my personal problems without my consent?”
But just as he was about to open his mouth to ask who this guy was and why was he listening into private Avengers meetings he caught a glimpse of the boy’s face.
They went through more routine questions, like Clint’s and Sam’s numbers and Peter’s doctor’s information before she saved it and turned to him.
“He wouldn’t let me listen to his breathing but just from sitting next to him I could hear how his chest was crackling as he breathed, so he probably has pneumonia, or at the least a bad chest infection.”
After coaching some breathing and offering him some water, peter had been left drained and just complied with picking out clothing after that.
“How about you go with Tony whilst I pay for this stuff? You can go and think about what clothes shops you might want to go to.” Steve smiled kindly, and Peter just nodded, chest too tight to speak, and headed for the door of the shop.
He reached into the drawer from the metal end table next to his bed and with pinched eyebrows pressed the power button experimentally.
He wants to snap at Tony, shout the words he’s thinking right in his face. But he holds back because these are the people that could dump him back to the social services at any moment, which would be living hell.
“See you tomorrow, kid.” Tony says softly, at the same time Steve says ‘night’ and then they both turn towards the door hand in hand.
I thought this chapter would be up on Wednesday but I've had a few exams this week and then my internet was down on Thursday so I'm really sorry that this is going up so late! On the bright side, I think I'll be posting twice a week, on no particular days :)
Peter narrowed his eyes, face still flushing, and pursed his lips before looking away from her eyesight and shuffled his feet whilst answering shortly.
Although when they reached the administration’s office, a lady he didn’t recognise was sat behind the desk in a white blouse. She looked up when Tony opened the door and then smiled when she realised who it was.
“Okay, well thank you for telling us that,” Steve said and then smiled lightly. “But to keep you safe, we need to know where you are at all times and how to reach you.”
It must have been difficult for him to wake up in a whole different century and also have a bunch of money that he didn’t know what to do with.
“God Steve, use your fucking head. He fell out of the ceiling in a sleeping bag.” Clint groused, hands clenched on the table, eyes down and angry.
Once he was far enough away from the tower he slipped into an unassuming alleyway and opened his backpack to bring out his suit. He quickly shucked off his sweats and hoodie and replaced it with the suit, shoving the clothes into the backpack and webbing it tightly to the side of a bin.
After twenty anxiety-ridden minutes of trying to pick out two sets of sheets whilst Steve kept telling him to ‘not worry about the price’, he had managed to vaguely gesture to a set of black star-wars sheets and some white and light blue sheets.
“You okay?” Tony asked softly after a few minutes of silence where Peter regained his breath and became more familiar with his surroundings.
But he couldn’t do that, because they needed Peter to trust them, and breaking the rule Peter had set about him going to sleep would certainly break any sort of trust they built with him.
Peter tilts his head to gaze at him, observing him quietly, blinking a few times. Then, almost imperceptibly, he nodded.
Peter chose to sit in the chair at the end, looking around the office and picking at the rips in his jeans.
“Peter?” It was from Tony. “Can we come in?” Peter panted, gripping his hair once more as he folded himself over and dug his forehead into the plush carpet. He tried to say no, or argue that it was locked but nothing was coming out except for wheezy breaths.
“I’m a super soldier!” Steve growled, glaring at Tony playfully. “I could’ve easily carried those bags.”
“Come on Peter, take a nice deep breath for me.” He thinks it might be Steve talking next to him, but the noise comes so blurred to his ears that it could’ve been anyone. He hiccupped, hands desperately trying to clutch something underneath him.
Subsequently, the next morning he slept for a few more hours but woke at around noon when his stomach simply wouldn’t let him get away with not eating anymore. Whilst there was food in his sock drawer, he was saving that for emergencies and refused to use any more of it when he could still go outside and get something to eat.
Peter nodded slowly, then pulled the sheet off the bed he was on around his shoulder before shimmying out the shirt and putting it on back to front.
When he was done, Stephen placed the stethoscope around his neck and brought up the results from his bloodwork.
He debated not mentioning it, leaving Clint be. But he didn’t like seeing the man uncomfortable, so he took a deep breath and turned towards him.
“Okay, then you’re fit to go.” Stephen smiles, “Just make sure you take the pain relievers and antibiotics every morning.”
“You were good with Peter today at dinner, I wouldn’t be able to think of a solution like that.” He watched as Tony blushed; the brunette never was good at receiving compliments (especially if they were related to his parenting skills) and then turned to hug his small body around Steve’s
“Ben, please, no, no, no.” His voice was slurred, still groggy from sleep, but still panicked and scared like a small child would have been. Steve gently hovered by the bed before calling out to him.
A loud crash cut off Steve's sentence, followed by a groan from the person who had just fallen out of the ceiling.
It was, though, in some ways nice to relax from the walls he put around himself or worry about where he was going or who he was with or what he was going to eat the next day. Only in some ways though.
They were handed menus and that’s when it dawned on Peter, he was going to have choose something that required money. He licked his dry lips and looked down at the menu along with Steve and Tony who were already mumbling about sides to share, trying not to show his inner turmoil.
“Well I hate to break you from your corner, but we need to go to your appointment.” He smiled but Peter didn’t smile back, folding the corner of the book down and standing up slowly as he set the book down.
Instead of proclaiming that he wasn’t that kind of doctor, Bruce shifted in his seat slightly before grimacing.
And for the first time since Steve had begun speaking to him, the young boy took his eyes off Steve to look at Tony who was standing near the back wall, one iron man gauntlet on.
He was forced to endure ten more minutes of Bond’s latest magnum opus before finally only Bond’s panting breath came across Tony’s headset.
What occupied his thoughts long into the night wasn’t death, but the chance to grow old. At least the serum hadn’t taken that sliver of humanity from him. In the early hours of the morning, it occurred to him why this all felt both exciting and so damn intimidating:
“...I mean, we are human,” Tony tried to say without laughing, “but we haven’t had a serious fight since I was allowed to eat carbs again after
“We call her the LaWsp,” he said with a smug grin, pronouncing it law-sp to emphasize the wasp. “Laser Weapons System Pen.”
Apart from the slow, hypnotic circles Tony was rubbing into his aggravated lower back, neither of them moved.
Ahead, long planks were laid across the tunnel floor to allow large numbers of people move through the tunnels with ease. A dozen figures dressed in dark colors armed with blunt clubs and long knives descended on them. Steve met them head on, intentionally positioning himself between Tony and the mob when Tony slipped around him and under Steve’s arm. Wedged in like a shield for his ward, he kicked the first Scrap coming at Steve in the gut, elbowed another’s club away before kneeing that Scrap in the crotch.
Tony took pictures of his legs in different positions, until one with his thighs slightly splayed and bent stood out as a winner. He sent it to Steve with the caption,
Christopher Walken? Creepy, right? But it’s kinda sweet, he fell in love with Elvis’s style, and he hasn’t changed it since. Weird, huh? But that kind of commitment to anything, who has that anymore? I change my hair every six or seven months; short, or cut it to grow long… fashion, you know.”
“You had a great career going, babe. What are you doing here? You think you’re smart enough to get Hawley’s internship?” Brock pointed out softly, as if to emphasize how he was only saying it to protect Steve from future disappointment. “You’re setting yourself up for failure, Steve. There’s no way you’ll get the grades to stay here, let alone qualify for competitive internships. I don’t mean—”
There was a brief silence, but even though the contempt was clear in Steve’s eyes, he inclined his head just enough for Tony to understand. Relief washed over him, and Tony quietly instructed Steve to step back and stand with him against the wall as the meeting resumed.
With a quiet rumble of laughter, Tony squeezed his thighs around Steve’s hips. “You always ride this slow?”
And you know Tony. Even though he wants to keep away, he really can’t. Maybe he went by to see Steve in an open practice, along with a smattering of Steve's fans (and also the opponent's fans, who come to see what they're up against for betting purposes), and the media, all of them there to see Steve train. It was a beautiful sight, whether he was sparring or if he was throwing power punches at the reinforced bags. Tony would try to stay in a corner, try to stay unseen, but when the new manager wasn’t calling the right shots, wasn’t keeping a close enough watch on the trainer, and maybe even getting swept away with the media attention, more focused on making sure a good photo is taken of them/Steve/himself, Tony would get fed up on Steve's behalf. This was not what you were supposed to be doing the week before a fight: you needed to focus.
“Clint Francis Stark, you better talk better than this when you ask that girl to marry you,” Tony said with a huge grin, and when Clint snapped his gaze up to look at him, Tony laughed and pulled him in for a hug, smiling even when he pressed an adoring kiss his brother’s temple.
“Confirm that they would be willing to meet our minimum bid,” Steve mumbled sleepily without so much as looking at either of them. His head was too heavy so he rested with his forehead against the car window, and his tired eyes couldn’t endure the California sun without watering. His weary thoughts swarmed and echoed with roaring force inside his head leaving him with no energy to spare on any thought besides how badly, how desperately he wanted to rest. All he wanted was one night, one rotten, godforsaken night of peace.
Sam nodded and echoed her sentiment. “There’s a lot of fish in the sea, Steve. Take it from someone who learned it the hard way: you don’t always need to reel in the one that’s fighting back.”
Without releasing its mouthful, the master probed at Tony’s ass with its dry fingers and long stone talons, delighting in the way Tony’s body finally responded with hitching, pained noises. When Tony’s come didn’t gush from Tony’s hole (like a woman’s body might), the master buried its long, flickering tongue even further in his body, slurping up whatever it could from Tony’s colon and intestines. A shout of shocking discomfort and pain was punched out of Tony and he scrambled to get away. The master clearly had no awareness for male anatomy (or lack of self-lubrication) or how to extract what it so dearly wanted.
When Steve didn’t offer any more information, Tony felt around in the pockets of the hoodie to see if he’d missed something. They turned out to be empty, but after a quick pat-down, Tony found the three pill bottles in Steve’s sweats.
“Garters don’t come with the underwear, did you know that?” Sharon commented simply from his elbow. “Common misconception.”
“Hey, no, Steve,” Tony said in a gentle, sympathetic tone that made Steve want to crawl to a confessional and repent. “He’s happy as a clam, alright? I’m sure you made his day. Thanks for doing that, I know it’s late where you are, and—it just means a lot. Thank you.”
“There’s breakfast if you want some, I made waffles.” Peter would’ve felt bad at the man’s desperate voice if he didn’t remember that he had to go and see a therapist. “Look, Peter, you have every right to be mad but you need food and if you don’t come out, I’ll get Jarvis to unlock the door.”
“Fine, I’ll be out in a minute.” He replied, waiting for Steve to walk off before he walked over to the door and opening it.
But his legs wouldn’t co-operate, they felt like sand and he was sort of aware that his breathing was coming out in shallow pants that made his head go fuzzy and panic swell up in his chest.
Seemingly satisfied with his answer of no, Clint turned back to the movie, but only twenty minutes later did he ask if he wanted something else to eat.
Was he shivering? He wasn’t cold, rarely was anymore, and the tower was usually a pretty nice temperature. He hadn’t been cold for the past few months, he’d had to learn to not be, and he tried to keep himself wrapped up in whatever he had to stop him from getting pneumonia.
“Tony,” Steve said as soon as Tony shut the door behind them. He hadn’t even let go of his duffle yet, and his tone was inexplicably cautious and uncomfortable that Tony’s eyes grew wide with concern. Were Dum-E’s guts all over the floor again? Had he forgotten to clean up and again left his room looking like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of actual chainsaws?
“Why?” Sharon wondered, angling the computer towards Steve in quiet encouragement to come back and look himself. “Does a tutu make you less of a man?”
she needed to hear everything. “I’ve had one night stands, sure; even friends with benefits occasionally. But… a date, a relationship? I’ve never… needed that. What—how do you ask someone out on a date?”
Meeting Barnes was a clear improvement to every accolade and achievement he had shared on his CV, and after a surprisingly good conversation, Steve grudgingly found himself sharing Sharon’s assessment. Yet the thought of his department falling into the hands of his assistant and a new hire was already giving Steve a migraine.
His hunch paid off spectacularly. Tony had instinctively learned what it meant when the cold Boston night turned warm and humid. His subconscious remembered, and sometimes before Steve even reached his bed, Tony would have tossed his blankets aside and spread his knees in anticipation, his ass turned up to be touched, and his heavy cock leaking against the mattress.
“Funny you should say that,” Tony observed with a quiet, thoughtful hum. “Did you know that Rhodey always knows when we’ve spent time together? It’s almost as if there are visible signs on my body that—”
When Tony had showed up at the gate with no luggage, Steve had assumed he’d checked everything. But it turned out the man really had traveled with nothing but his wallet and his phone.
“The King is not subject to his own law!” Steve snapped, venting his crippling fear and hopeless rage on his friend. “I will not sit and wait here for some talking head to tell me whether my husband is dead or alive. With or without your help I will be there,” he finished with a promise. “If it is the last thing I do, I will be there. And I will be there well within the goddamn hour.”
Tony tugged the neglected comforter closer to cover Steve as well as he could while still straddling Steve’s thighs. Some treasures he wasn’t willing to give up that easily.
Her cheerful tail wagged farther ahead of him than usual, acting like she’d been in doggy-prison for years and only now been allowed to come see her friends. She wiggled up to the two or three other runners ahead of them, making sure they could see and envy her toy before doubling back for Tony.
Bucky leaned around Steve without breaking his stride. “That’s touching, but did you really just say ‘a cornucopia of fisting?’”
“Where’d you go, Buck?” Steve called far too sweetly as he stalked from room to room, “I won’t hurt you, I just want to talk…”
“Your Majesty! Forgive me,” she said in a rush, scrambling to get out of bed. Whatever her plan was, Tony feared she was trying to stand to bow, so he placed the food on a small table provided for her and hurried to help her get back into bed.
Sure enough, Tony was cantering back to the house on Dummy’s back, but this time, the horse was fully decked out. No more bareback rides with makeshift bitless halters: Tony sat in a full saddle, with real reins in his hands, and the rifle was safely tucked away in a scabbard like the one Clint had strapped to his horse.
Unbidden, a familiar knot started to make itself known in Tony’s throat. Quickly, he looked down at Steve’s phone before his eyes gave him away. The phone had been idle too long, but Tony stared at the black screen as he tried to will his tears away.
- Steve relented. Tony coughed through the last of his laughter while scrubbed half-heartedly at the tears on his face and tried to grumble through something snarky when Steve caught his hands.
The audience lifted in cheerful applause, drowning out the sound of Tony’s racing heart and his lingering anxieties. On set, the cameras were there to capture your character, or whoever you were trying to bring to life. You could play around, you could make shit up, but there was nothing to hide behind during talk shows. Millions of Americans were tuning in to see
“You’ll be there, too, won’t you?” Tony asked with a smile in his voice, and a moment later he asked, “I’m guessing she lives out in Brooklyn? That might be too tight for me.”
“Steve, no,” Tony promised, relaxing further into Steve’s lap so he wasn’t looking down on him anymore. Face to face, Tony brushed a kiss over his lips before pressing his forehead to Steve’s. “Your friendship isn’t worth risking for sex.”
“I’ve been wanting to tell you, Tony. I wanted to tell you when I first told you I liked you on Tuesday. I just, I wanted a chance to know if I was enough, if just Steve was enough. But you deserve to know, too. So, Lois Lane is my mom and Clark Kent is my dad,” Steve explained as steadily as he could. “Tony, Clark Kent is Superman.”
“I need us to talk about the sex outside of sex,” he finally said. Tony lifted his head to watch him and found Steve smiling at him - sheepish and adoring, but sure of what he wanted - and Tony couldn’t help but smile back and steal a quick kiss from the lips he’d missed for too long.
Despite the grip Steve had of him, Tony adjusted his position to leave Steve’s throbbing cock untouched.
Very quickly, Tony became more sensitive to Steve’s touch. Sometimes it was the faintest contraction in Steve’s bicep that would wake Tony from the deepest sleep, or even a twitch of Steve fingers. More often than not, Tony would lie awake for a short time to listen to Steve’s even breathing until he was sure Steve’s sleep was peaceful. He could have been dreaming of painting or swimming in a lake, and with the added comfort of knowing that Steve slept peacefully, Tony would close his eyes and drift away so easily.
“I’m going after her,” Steve told him while paramedics rushed to stabilize Tony. “I’ll be back; you can be angry then.”
“—instead of asking Steve to come to you,” Rhodey finished in a louder tone. He could see in Tony’s expression when the point landed, how his lively excitement waned and paled in understanding.
“You say that like there was a plan in place! I didn’t know what this was until last Thursday, and Steve’s barely let me come up for air since.”
“I have wanted to marry Éli as long as I have known her, Your Majesty,” he eventually confessed. “I was twelve and she was ten. Her family was from far away, but they fled during the war and hid in the same camp as my family. When we talked, I forgot we were hiding from a war. But ten years have passed and I worry she will say no, that we are too young. That it is not the right time,” he said with a grumble of irritation. “But how do you know when is the right time?”
“Now, unless you’re some kind of millenial polygamist, it looks to me like you’ve got someone mailing you a selection of engagement rings. Does that sound like love to you, Steve?”
“Hi, Tony,” Steve said with a smile, leaning back comfortably in his seat. “I’m Steve. Before anything else, I gotta ask: is this a typical night out for you?”
- but his brain had disconnected from all speech long ago. Tony guided him onto his side, and Steve obediently did as he was told. He felt Tony brush a kiss over his shoulder and another over the back of his neck before he felt Tony’s long, lean body sliding up behind his, curving around him in a protective embrace. Tony settled so they shared the same pillow, and he pressed a final kiss over the back of Steve’s head before nuzzling into his hair. Together they drifted off to blissful sleep.
“His parents made him do it, he said,” Steve eventually muttered under his breath, a quiet hiccup catching in his voice. “He said he still, that he still loves me. But what’s… what’s wrong with me? Is it a gay thing? They knew about me the whole summer. I met his mom.”
Steve reached down to run his fingers through Tony’s soft hair as the stoic Graekol concluded the section of legal concerns and moved on to the typical physical problems. Tall, illuminated panels turned on all around the audience with graphic visual evidence of various side-effects of trusting poorly conducted private harvest masters.
“Tired of seeing you?” Steve guessed with an affectionate smile. “No, genius, I won’t get tired of seeing you. I’ll either be in the shower or on the couch when you get there, so just let yourself in, alright?”
As dusk turned to night, Ean, Marham's chief priest entered the ceremonial lodge. He was the mortal conduit for Brigid, their patron goddess of fertility, raised from an early age to serve Brigid by surrendering himself in their most sacred rites. Through his body, Brigid received Marham’s sacrificial offering. Through him, she weighed their worth.
After all this time, all of his memories were still there, but they were strangely out of reach. Steve knew every piece of the apartment, from the shade of the mismatched wallpapers, to the hairline cracks in the kitchen floor tiles, but it somehow wasn’t his home anymore. Even his childhood room, now cramped with all of his boxes and bags from college, felt strange to him. He lost his virginity in that bed, and now he slept in it as a working adult.
Bruce’s eyebrows climbed up his forehead. “Oh, man. He’s so screwed,” he said, not without pride, “if there’s anyone who can be a real asshole in public, Tony, it’s you.”
When the next spinning throw had Tony turned to face Steve at the control stand, Tony winked at him with a grin and taunted him with, “You can go harder than that, darling!”
“I’m your lucky star,” Steve teased, then with a quiet laugh he quickly added, “just a government grunt with friends in low places. I would have been screwed without your help, so I pulled some strings. Was it too much?”
“Mom, you’re messing up his hair,” Clint complained on Steve’s behalf, as if it had happened so often in his life that Steve was more worried about his hairstyle than the affection shared.
When they parted, Steve smiled back at him with nothing reasonable to say; he might have mumbled something about how it was a good surprise, but he wasn’t sure, and nothing really mattered in that moment, except that Tony was there, smiling back at him, and they were happy.
“You know… when you say things like that, I sometimes worry that I’ll wake up and see it was all a dream. Like in
“Shower’s the first door on the right the way we came, use anything you want in there. Clint has his own,” Tony was saying while Steve looked around the room. “I’m gonna grab something from the kitchen, you want anything?”
“Holy shit, aren’t you Iron Man?” cried the kid who thought he’d simply caught Captain America in a gay embrace.
Tony surged up after him and threw his arms around Steve, chasing his kisses with a hungry, biting greed—in one heartbeat, he seated himself in Steve’s lap, and in the next, Steve pushed back, pressing Tony down into the mattress on his side and crowding around him possessively, biting into the crook of Tony’s neck and thrusting his cock against Tony’s ass eagerly, grunting with the need to be inside him already.
Tony didn’t say anything, but Steve felt how he shifted in bed, adjusting his position so he could plant one foot on the mattress next to Steve’s shoulder. With newfound leverage, he pulled out of Steve to thrust back into his body with greater force, until he was pounding into Steve like an animal.
“It’s him,” Steve said and held the ringing phone between them, as if he suddenly didn’t know what to do with it. “What do I say? He probably thinks I’m home, if I—”
They grabbed their food to go and wandered out to the sand. It was easy finding a spot for themselves, and Steve pulled a blanket out of his bag for them to sit on.
“Is she alright?” Georgie asked, bringing Tony back to the present, but it wasn’t until Steve smiled at him and promised he’d watch her that he could sit back and think again.
He slipped out of the van unnoticed, locked it back up, and headed into the pub for a drink of his own. Steve wasn’t letting the ratty crew out of his sight until he was sure they were headed to London, and besides, they were treating everyone to a free pint. An ironic perk of the job.
, Steve thought to himself while his best friend and his boyfriend continued their fiery argument that somehow had nothing to do with Steve or Steve’s opinions whatsoever.
“Steve would like Paris,” Carol assured them both before Tony had to defend his choices, and Tony brightened with a glimmer of new-found hope. “He loves art, he enjoys French music, language, culture.”
“To be honest, I don’t know what love is,” he confided in Tony. The silence on Tony’s end was deafening, and he wasn’t even sure Tony hadn’t hung up on him in his embarrassment, except that was so unlike Tony that Steve braved the rest of his confession. “I thought I did, but nothing I knew holds a candle to how I feel for you. I care about you, Tony, a lot,” he finished more quietly, suddenly aware of the fact that he was standing in the middle of rush hour foot traffic. Steve shuffled to the side and cleared his throat before to speak before he lost his nerve. “I miss you all the time. I think about you all the time. And if that’s how you feel, I, I want to earn your love.”
“Do not fear: I will not breakfast alone. I took your advice and called Lila,” Steve heard Tony explain in the video, confirming Steve’s own guess. “She and Shuri are here now and they have graciously allowed me to join them today on a visit to the Queen’s Troupe and the visiting exhibition of Victor Hugo’s artworks. Incidentally, Shuri let it slip that her brother’s birthday approaches. How do you think he would like a Super Soaker? From us both, of course.”
“With all due respect,” Tony spoke up, speaking through gritted teeth despite his polite address. It was only then that Steve realized everyone besides them at the table was dripping in gold jewelry, and what that meant for someone in Tony’s position. “Refrain from asking my ward such insensitive and hurtful questions. His courage and selfless actions saved the life of our most benevolent Governor earlier today, he is not here for your vile amusement.”
“Truly so,” Tony agreed, and he allowed a brief pause to act as a natural break between such terrible historic characters and the exalted Captain.
“I see,” Tony murmured, a playful lilt in his voice. “You had the time to call them, but you couldn’t find the time to call me.”
lives,” Steve reminded him, softly. He could feel the knot of tears hot and heavy in his throat, but he gritted his teeth against the tears and pushed through. If Tony wanted to talk, he was damn well going to give Steve some answers.
“May she rest peacefully,” Steve eventually murmured into Tony’s hair, following it with a kiss. Tony stirred in his arms and glanced up at Steve looking dazed and a little lost. Steve smiled back at him fondly, then pressed up to kiss Tony’s forehead softly, a lingering, unhurried kiss that left Tony pliant and warm and nearly smiling again.
If Tony had ever wondered what crazy rich people decorated their offices with, he could have stood and stared for hours. There was an original Dali hanging near an original Jackson Pollock, and it made no artistic sense other than to show off just how wealthy the asshole really was. Beautiful marble sculptures and enormous slabs of ancient bas relief were mounted on sturdy plinths.
Just as Bruce was peeling off his gloves, was when Steve came back in, face pinched in frustration and worry.
“Just here to check your vitals for the day.” He murmurs, flitting through the notes the previous nurses had made over each of his appointments.
Just as Tony was about to answer, Peter couldn’t stop himself from jolting upright and startling the others as he spoke.
Peter blushed, “I took some time off for dealing with my recent family situation.” He mumbled, still red.
They settled into somewhat of a routine over the next week where Steve and Tony would go and do their respective jobs and Peter would either stay at home and read some of his many books or hung out with one of the team that wasn’t working that day (luckily none of them brought up the incident that occurred on what Peter is calling ‘night from hell’).
Steve’s mouth snapped shut, trying to observe every detail of the body that had just fallen through the ceiling of one of the most secure buildings in Manhattan. The boy had dark brown curly hair, long and unkempt, dirt and grease streaking through it as though it hadn’t been washed in a while. His face and body were skinny, unnaturally so, and he could see that by the way that his thin clothes were draping off his body. But the most alarming thing about this boy was that he had a large bruise planted across his jaw, deep purple and yellow standing out against his frightfully pale skin.
“Do you have ice cream?” He asked instead, pulling the blanket over his shoulders. Clint’s eyes lit up, and he jumped up, speed walking to the freezer before pulling out a tub of rocky road ice cream out and grabbing two spoons from the drawer.
“I think you should be ready to get out of the med bay tomorrow.” Stephen smiles at him. “Provided you eat your daily number of calories and you don’t do any heavy exercise for the next week.”
Clint pursed his lips, hands clenching underneath the table almost imperceptibly. It must be hard for him to hear this, Steve thought sadly, knowing what it was like.
He was due to go and get checked later in the day for how his chest infection was getting better. He could feel his chest was better but every time he coughed and wheezed, he felt tired and worn out and Steve winced each time he did it. Still, he was dreading going back.
“Hey kiddo, you with us?” Tony asked softly, and Peter blinked a few times before nodding, not trusting his speech.
“Where do you wanna go?” Steve asked with a smile, looking at him through the rear-view mirror and Peter just shrugged and looked out of the window at all of the other cars lined there.
“Are you looking forward to starting school on Monday?” Tony asked, thankfully not mentioning the freakout.
“I was sleeping.” He gestured down to the bag he was wearing. “Honestly I didn’t expect to be disturbed, I expected better structural integrity from Stark Tower.”
“Thank you for meeting with us on such short notice,” Steve said politely, choosing to let Tony sit in the middle seat.
Steve looked up at him from where he was looking at some blue and black sheets and smiled softly, before setting the package back on the shelf.
Also, there were multiple sketch books and magazines piled up on the coffee tables next to some coasters which had some coffee rings on them, and a MIT jumper folded up next to everything.
“Hey, guys – wanna play?” Clint asked, only briefly looking over his shoulder so he could keep his eyes on where his kart was going.
Tony and Steve both had the decency to leave Peter alone whilst they chose some food and let him gather himself, so when the waitress came over, they asked for all the food, choosing a few sides and starters as well as the three mains. They had decided that Peter would have Ramen Soup, which sounded pretty nice, and when the waitress left his shoulders sagged with relief.
“Are you sure you’re okay with starting next Monday?” He asked, one eyebrow raised. “There’s no pressure to go back, you know.”
“And you guys wouldn’t be my parents, right?” Peter knew how the system worked, he knew foster parents weren’t parents, more like caregivers. But Steve and Tony couldn’t think that they were going to be parents because it would just be better for Peter’s conscious on the whole.
“Because it’s too much.” Peter hissed, face bright red and he then sighed and took a deep breath, tangling both hands behind his neck and dropping his head so he was staring at the table.
“Well, you were great anyway.” Steve pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head, making the latter hum contentedly.
“But I want to watch you take the meds out of the casing and immediately administer them.” He said sharply, voice firm.
Peter didn’t respond, just watched the new doctor move around the room, putting on a lab coat, snapping on gloves, writing notes from the tablet down on the clipboard being kept on a small desk on the opposite side of the room which he knew had his medical notes on it.
“So, where has he been staying in that month?” Steve asked quietly, looking at the face on the file that was staring back at him.
“Hmm? Oh, he’s looking at tech.” Steve gently began feeling some of the blankets for texture. “He likes looking at the competition. He’ll probably be back around-“
After last night, Peter had only just realised how much the two really care for him. That was dangerous, bad things always happened to the people that cared about him. It was almost like he was cursed, so he just stopped caring about anyone or letting anyone get too close.
“Okay, well we’ll talk tomorrow morning anyway. Goodnight, Peter.” Stephen smiles at him quickly before turning to the door and heading out, lab coat breezing behind him.
“You always want to go to that Italian place for date night.” Steve complained. “Let’s go somewhere else?”
“Bruce.” It was Tony who spoke first, hand still clutching at a tablet. “What can you tell us about his physical health?”
“I-I’m sorry. I don’t know what happened, it’s never, um, happened before.” He murmured and looked forward when Tony touched his leg gently.
“Hey, no one is gonna kill you.” He said softly, gazing down at the thin blue sleeping bag the boy’s lower half was still tangled up in from the fall.
“Whatever,” Tony grumbled, turning around to face Peter who was in the backseat and also observing his school with curiosity.
He listens out to hear what the voices are saying and is pleased to see that it’s nothing about him.
He didn’t want to look over to Steve and Tony, but when his eyes flitted to them, he wished he hadn’t. They both had faces of complete pity and sadness which just wanted to make Peter crawl into a hole and die.
“Peter? You okay?” Bruce asked, noticing how Peter’s heart rate was beginning to rapidly increase from the monitor by his bed.
Peter obviously wouldn’t have said it, since that would have raised many unexplainable questions, but the pain relief they had administered fifteen minutes ago was already wearing off and the gentle throb in his jaw was beginning to come back.
“Nice web fluid by the way, how do you make that?” Peter remained tense, gripping his bag even tighter, eyeing the two men in the room in suspicion.
The pair nodded and began a discussion on the new training schemes, so Peter felt okay to just slip away into his bedroom and shut the door on the noise.
“I-I- “ Peter stammered, and suddenly he ripped the pulse monitor off his finger, throwing his legs off the bed sideways, and tried to stand.
He felt pretty refreshed as he walked out the door and onto the sidewalk alone for the first time in a while; he even had a little spring in his step.
“It will feel a little strange at first, having money, being able to get things that you not only need but
The man took the stethoscope off his neck and placed the earpieces in his ears before gesturing to his top.
When he walked into the living room wearing a hoodie and a pair of jeans and his old sneakers, Steve looked genuinely surprised to see him there. He didn’t say anything to either of them as they got into the elevator, and the trip down was silent, save for Steve asking Tony what time Tony’s meeting was later and Tony’s response of ‘five’.
“Well, we thought we’d let you settle for two or three weeks and then go and speak to your headmaster to see about enrolling you again. Sound good?”
“Oh fuck.” The voice from below him suddenly said, and when Steve looked down at the body, he saw that deep hazel eyes were gazing around the group of people in the room to varying degrees of fear.
Peter’s eyes flitted over his new home, taking in the vast clean white space and felt himself curl in on himself whilst is hand tightened over his IV pole (He was allowed to visit the penthouse suite but after an hour he was supposed to be back in bed on the medical ward so he could be taken care of while he recovered).
eats my pickles?” Tony sighed dreamily, biting into his food before looking at Steve with a loving expression.
“I don’t know? A pretzel?” He tried not to roll his eyes when Steve grinned and nodded before telling them he’d go and grab the food, and letting Tony guide him to the table.
“Good to see you again, Peter.” He shut the door when they were all in the room. “How are you feeling?”
“What does it say?” Peter asked, suddenly, like he hadn’t thought about asking it before he did. “My blood, I mean. I’ve always wanted to test it but I never could.”
“Okay.” Tony agreed, and Peter felt a grin split his face apart. “But you have to message us when you’re on the way home and not stop anywhere that you’re not supposed to.” He said firmly, and Peter nodded.
All in all, the car journey only lasted fifteen minutes, and when they pulled up outside the building with the gold plate stating the professionals that work there, he wished that the journey was longer.
“Stephen Strange.” He then turned back to the tablet, missing Peter’s hard glare, but feeling it burn into his head.
“And you fucking should.” Clint nodded. “Popcorn?” He plopped a huge bowl of popcorn in between their bodies and then threw a large blue fluffy blanket across their knees.
“Sorry about the mess.” Steve huffed, eyes sloping over to Tony. “I’ve tried to make everything as neat as possible but Tony manages to get his stuff everywhere no matter what I do.”
A hand pushed at the front of his chest, attempting to get him to sit up straight but it took a pair of hands at his shoulders tugging back for him to get upright. When he was upright, he was pinned to a chest, and that’s when he realised, he’d been thrashing against the two pairs of hands.
She still had the same expression on her face, but she didn’t say or do anything other than glance at Steve to carry on.
No one said anything as they filed into the meeting room one over from where a fourteen-year-old enhanced superhero literally fell into their lives.
And no one said anything at all when they all glanced wearily up at the ceiling as if they expected another child to fall out.
Nothing was perfect, he still woke up some days where he couldn’t talk about anything much and he felt more closed off than usual. He had seen Annie once more but he had felt very anxious and jittery when he’d gone so they hadn’t talked about anything that was particularly stimulating or interesting.
“I tried tracking his phone but- oh thank god, Peter,” Tony exclaimed, joining them in the group to also hug him quickly.
He wanted to be excited about tomorrow, but something was holding him back. He was scared, scared of getting attached, scared of hurting them and especially scared of them leaving him.
Peter just blushed again and looked away from Tony to gaze around the mall until Steve came out looking annoyed.
Peter beat him three twice, and to finish it off on the last game lapped him too. He smirked as Sam let out another squawk of surprise when Peter’s bike zipped past him on the screen.
“One is your closet the other is a bathroom.” Steve explained, sensing Peter’s confusion. “Believe me, you don’t want to share a bathroom with Tony.” He laughed, making Tony huff and pout dramatically.
“No,” Peter said immediately. He was fine with most things these doctors would ask to do, but anything that required him to take off his shirt was a no-go, they would see how skinny he was and how his ribs protruded greatly.
“So, how did it go with the psychologist?” He thinks that’s Sam. “Are they prepared to take on Peter?”
Once Bruce finished, Tony didn’t speak for a few seconds before he pressed a button on his tablet so the boy’s file was open for everyone to see.
On top of the plush cream carpet sat a grey fluffy rug that moved nicely under his feet and made the room feel smaller, which he appreciated. And then on either side of the tv were two doors, and his eyes scanned them in thought.
“It’s cool, I’m just glad to see you!” Ned threw his arms around him and Peter smiled softly, squeezing back before pulling away.
“Could we sit down in the living room maybe? So everyone is comfortable?” Steve asked again, and Peter pursed his lips but nodded and followed the two men into the living room before squashing himself as far back into the sofa as humanly possible whilst Tony and Steve took to armchairs opposite him.
“Don’t mock.” Steve scolded, eyebrows furrowing. “Anyway, you like Star Trek, from what I’ve heard: that’s worse.”
He could hear someone sigh and his shoulders tensed as he waited for the shout or slap or insult, but instead, the car just began reversing and Tony and Steve started talking about going to some homeware store for things for his room.
“God, I know I have it every time but I’m going to have to have the Pad Thai, it’s just too good.” Tony groaned, making Steve grin at him as he closed his menu and made his choice.
“I’m not a medical doctor, Peter. I can say what I think personally, but we need a doctor to tell us how to treat you in a professional opinion.”
He carefully clambered out the thin material so they could finally see the torn jeans he had been wearing underneath, before expertly rolling up the sleeping bag and stuffing it in a battered rucksack that had fallen out with him.
“Now you have taken ten weeks off school, so there is always a possibility that you could be held behind or you have to retake the year.” Peter felt his chest tighten, he couldn’t fathom Ned and MJ moving on to being Juniors without him. “But based on your grades and performance, maybe a little extra credit you can be back up and ahead in no time.”
But they could provide a bed and meals consistently whilst also dealing with his Spiderman problems, and they couldn’t outwardly abuse him because no doubt the media would be after him and that was press The Avengers didn’t want.
“Why are you so insistent?” Peter snapped before he could stop himself, suddenly clenching his fists in anger.
“After a week of rest.” Steve cut in, glaring at Tony pointedly, who just rolled his eyes and looked over at Peter for his answers.
Eyes flitting around his room, he tried to come up with something to do or say when confronted because he probably only had limited time until someone came to get him, but his chest felt too tight and his breaths were coming short.
Peter breathed deeply when told to, only glaring at Stephen in slight annoyance when he made him do it more than once. Then it was time for his chest and when Stephen placed the stethoscope under his flannel shirt, his cold fingers grazed along one of Peter’s protruded ribs, making him shudder in response.
Peter didn’t respond to Bruce’s greeting, eyes trained in on the new man, who had a stethoscope around his neck and was talking to Tony in hushed tones whilst they both leant over a Stark Tablet.
“How about I order for you?” Tony asked him. “Give me your menu so you can’t see the price of what I’m ordering, and I’ll choose. Okay?”
“Hey kid, I have to get to a meeting and Steve needs to go and help out with some new recruitments because he’s a nerd, you can stay here or go down to the common floor and watch a movie with Clint.” Tony popped his head around his door, clad in a suit and freshly washed and shaved.
.” Both Steve and Tony turned to look at him and Peter felt his face flush red and he looked away from their eye contact.
“But I’m back and I’m fine.” Peter squinted his eyes in irritation and moved past the two men. “Christ you guys are tetchy.”
Promptly ignoring the blonde, Tony turned to Peter and told him they’d be back at around six and if he needed anything, he could ask Jarvis to call them but the others would be more than happy to help with anything he needed.
“We’ll make sure he gets everything he needs.” Tony nodded; his hand linked tightly with Steve’s. Peter watched as Steve squeezed his hand tightly and then sent Peter a warm smile.
“We’re not that bad to live with, really,” Steve says with a hesitant smile, hands perched neatly in his lap as he talks to Peter.
Annie asked him a few more questions, mostly about his health or about how he was feeling about returning to school, and he gave one-or-two-word answers. Annoyingly, she never got angry or even hinted that she was annoyed, and he sort of wished she would.
“The law. So I’d shut it if I’d were you because the adults are talking.” Tony snapped from next to Steve. “Now you’re going to apologise to Sam, Clint, Wanda and Natasha because they wasted valuable time trying to look for you and then you’re gonna listen to us when we say that you’re grounded for the next two weeks,” Tony repeated, calmer.
He distantly heard Steve say something but his hands were over his ears because everything was too loud; too bright; too much.
“Peter! You left, on your own, without telling anyone where you were going or how long you were going to be gone for, without a phone and you expect us not to be angry?” Tony asked, making Peter stop on his way to the stairs so he could go upstairs to his room.
“I talked to Fury.” Tony continued. “He wants us to keep Peter with us, just until they sort out something permanent because he’s worried his enhancements and what he’s been through will be a problem and we’re more equipped to deal with that.”
“Hey, hey. It’s okay.” Steve said gently when he saw that Peter was getting worked up, resting a hand on the boy’s arm and making him look up from the table. “Pick what you like. It’s no problem.”
He couldn’t even begin to think about how much they were spending on him, all the money that could’ve gone to people like him.
“Are you stressed at all, Peter?” Stephen asked as he wrote some notes down in a file. “Or had any anxiety-like symptoms in the past few days?”
“So, who is gonna be his legal caregivers while he’s here?” Natasha asked, eyes skating over everyone in the room.
“Well I’m having the Black Pepper Stir Fry, I promised myself I’d have it the next time I came here.” He threw an arm around the back of Tony’s chair and leant back, “Do you want to share the corn fritters to start?” Tony’s eyes lit up and he nodded, his stomach rumbling as to prove his point.
Settling down into the two cushions behind him, Peter watches the first half of the film with soft eyes and barely breathes too loudly so he doesn’t spoil the atmosphere he’s created for himself.
His eyes fluttered open, taking in another deep breath, hands clutching tightly at the bottom of his grubby flannel shirt.
“Yeah, I bet.” Steve murmurs and then takes the bottle from Tony before uncapping it and taking a swig before holding it out.
“You’re only irritated because it’s before ten in the morning,” Steve replied, looking out of the window at the swarm of teenagers flittering around the school premises before they settled into their first lessons.
Wordlessly, he sat down at the table, not looking either Tony or Steve in the eye as he put a waffle on his plate and drizzled maple syrup over it. They ate in uncomfortable silence, the only noise cutlery on plates as they ate.
Peter takes it hesitantly then, taking a large gulp and then another. It’s stupid that he wants to test for food and drink before consuming them, especially because if these guys wanted to do it, they’ve had multiple chances since he arrived.
“It’s a lot of food.” He murmurs quietly, and he watches Steve’s face in the corner of the room flash with sympathy.
Annie was a slim woman, dark skin contrasting brilliantly against her yellow long-sleeved top and denim washed out dungarees. Her dark curly hair was braided back into two thick braids down the side of her hair and a few loose pieces fell against her forehead, framing her round face. Her eyes were kind and warm, dark hazel, they sort of reminded him of May’s.
“Okay, first of all, I’d like to apologise for what happened on Monday.” Steve started, voice steady; Peter belatedly wondered if he was actually feeling calm and collected or he was just trying to appear so.
“If you worried about the fact that we’ll figure out that you’re that spider-ling, don’t worry, we already know.”
“Tony, a quick word?” As the two men left the room, Peter let himself lean back against the head of the bed, head resting back as he watched Bruce test his blood.
Once in the penthouse, he practically ran to his room, twisting the lock once he was inside and immediately crumpling to the floor in breathy sobs. He tugged on his hair fitfully, sobs of frustration and fear coming out; not being able to stop them.
“One is mine and Stevie’s room. One is the main bathroom. One is Steve’s art studio and this one here is your room.”
Both men shared another look, passing a whole conversation between the two before turning back to Peter.
“There might be a few changes based on your private tutor time to catch up on your missing work, but not too many changes.”
“I hate them.” He muttered; voice thick like he was trying to fend off tears. “It’s bad enough going through the experience once without going through it every night.”
“Okay.” He agreed, sitting down and accepting the controller. “But just remember it’s going to be ten times more painful losing knowing that I haven’t played in a few months.”
The restaurant they were at was nice. It reminded Peter of the Indian place he used to go to with May and that made him smile slightly as they were seated. It was homely and petite, lightbulbs hanging off ropes dangling over circular light wooden tables with mismatched chairs creating a pleasant atmosphere.
He mostly just let Bruce work as he wiped his hands and inserted the cannula so the banana bag could serve its purpose, only pausing to read the casing of the pain relief certifying that it was, in fact, the pain relief as promised.
“Do you hear that?” Steve quickly cut off the smaller male, making him huff. But he just strained his ears to hear the same strangled noise he had a second ago.
“Uh, I’m just going to the common floor to show Clint my new book.” He didn’t think of himself that bad a liar, but people that knew him pretty well could always tell, so he tried to act as unsuspicious as possible. But there was no need:
But currently, he was sat on the sofa in the penthouse, wrapped in two blankets and reading ‘when Hitler stole pink rabbit’ which he was around halfway through. He’d was comfortably warm and cosy so he knew when he had to get up later it would be a problem, especially when he knew it was for going to the medical ward.
Peter stayed silent, still staring down at his water and began tapping his fingers against the glass.
As the drugs began to take effect after half an hour of staring at the ceiling was when he began to feel the inescapable pull of sleep, straining to keep them open after the trying few hours.
He was traipsed around the store and required to pick out things he liked. Including but not limited to: Lampshades, books, pillows, picture frames, mirrors, and curtains.
“But I don’t need any help!” Peter cried again, feeling very hot and angry and emotional all at once.
“What is actually going to happen?” Peter asked hesitantly, unsure that he wants to know the answer.
A blanket was laid across his body and he groaned, trying to push it off him because he was hot, did they not see that?
There was a beat of silence when no one said anything, and Peter simply stared down at his tap water whilst his leg bounced underneath him.
“I didn’t like it when you got angry at me.” He didn’t dare look up, but he knew the two men shared a look.
Peter chuckles lightly and snuggles back under the warmth of his blanket at the other end of the couch, knees bent to his chest.
"So what? We sit around and play monopoly?" Clint snorted from across the table, legs kicked up on the dark oak table.
The team had been worried that the pair would act differently towards one another after they started dating, putting them and others in danger or compromising a mission. They had been proven very wrong when the two continued to bicker like children every time a mission came about.
Although he stayed comfortably silent throughout the journey back to the compound, he was practically vibrating with excitement and he didn’t even care when Steve started asking him incessant questions about what textbooks and school supplies he would need. The prospect of another shopping trip didn’t even phase him.
“She was okay,” Peter responded, still tense from his talk earlier, he couldn’t get Annie’s words out of his head.
Steve smiled at him warmly, and Peter didn’t even acknowledge them, looking to the other wall where there were posters about mental health posted up.
After some time of both men speaking softly to him, pinned to Steve’s chest, he could feel his normal senses coming back to him and he stopped trying to get out of the grip holding him back, breathing hard and suddenly really cold.
“I know you’re lying about being hurt,” Tony said with a sigh, sounding more tired than upset. “Look, I know what it’s like. Bruises, whatever. You can’t even be honest about an injury, that’s cool, it’s just not something I’m interested in, alright?”
She acknowledged him with a quiet hum as she looked up what seats were padded, and then which were center ice.
“Ma used hazelnuts when I was little, since that was what we had,” Steve told Lila (and the rest of them) while handing out cutting boards and a few bags of nuts to adults around the counter. There were almonds, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts for them to pick from. Only Natasha and Rhodey seemed to get onboard with the unspoken request to chop nuts; both Bucky and Tony were happy to sit back and munch on handfuls of delicious nuts. “We didn’t get almonds until after the war, and I didn’t know what macadamia nuts were until… when did we go to America?”
“No, Tony, not all of them,” Steve promised, and finally, carefully, released Tony’s ankles. He helped him lie his legs down at last, giving Tony time to find a comfortable position before taking Tony’s soft cock in hand.
“To be honest, I was as confused as you by this assignment. I think there’s been a mistake,” Chris replied with a nervous, jittery laugh. “But, I got to watch the movie early! Plus—okay, I've never done this before, I can't give any spoilers, but I just have to tell you, I freaking loved it. That was so f-bomb cool! You guys did amazing work.”
Tony’s look of embarrassment turned into confusion. “What are the Fast and the Furious?” he asked after a beat. “Is it an archival film about speeding? I have yet to find such research on your time, but our historical directories attribute many tragic events to the combined behaviors of drinking and driving, texting and driving, and screening and driving.”
None of this was new to Tony—hell, it was probably normal. But he didn’t rush Steve or suggest they move on. Instead, he waited patiently, leaning against Steve’s side, still hand in hand, while they both watched the woman stay in her seat for a ten to fifteen seconds before being tossed from the saddle.
On one hand, Steve was inwardly pleased by the photo they’d chosen of him - something from the Armani fall collection earlier in the year where he was fully dressed. The close-up photo of Tony in a well-cut suit, smiling at an event of some kind, was also very flattering. Steve resisted the urge to ask if he could keep the paper.
“No, nothing like that,” Tony muttered and glared at the file, as if its content was more offending than Steve’s fears. He was angry, but beneath the anger Steve caught the glimpse of an emotion that had no business weighing on Tony.
He pulled down the tattered scarf obscuring half his face, and Tony watched as horror flickered across Steve’s expression.
Since Tony spent so much of his time in front of computer screens or working on tablets, they both made an effort to reduce screen time when they were together. On weekends they tried to get out of the house as much as they could - wandering through farmer’s markets, taking in a new museum exhibit, or stopping by for Shakespeare in the Park in the summertime. During the weekday when Tony got home late from work and didn’t have the energy to move a finger, they typically stayed in to play board games, solve crossword puzzles, or read together to wind down the night.
“I think she likes you too much,” Tony snickered, going back to the hole with the post-digger to clean it up for the replacement. “Steve? Don’t think too much about it. It’s not like the movies, unreasonable parents aren’t going to realize what they’re doing wrong and fall in love with you in 60 minutes or less.”
Despite his dedicated and eager interest, when Tony tugged him off by his hair, Steve relented without delay.
“I’ve never been on a date,” Steve told her in a quiet voice, and just like that, Sharon was shocked into silence.
Steve smiled at her before turning to look at Clint, where he sat in his saddle already, waiting for Tony to get ready. “What are you guys even doing?”
In the end, Steve gave up and returned to his room. After all, if there was one thing that Tony shouldn’t be surprised by, it would be Steve’s overeager cock.
“She will follow us from a distance,” Stephanie said quietly. “The only thing our legends have in common is compassion and love. We cannot frighten the tribes to do as we ask.”
“Steve?” Tony mumbled, slowly pushing himself up to sitting with small, careful movements. “What’re you doing?”
Tony had ever experienced. He hadn’t even gone for his precious monster dildo that he kept for the most special occasions, since this was meant to be for Steve. He didn’t need Steve to know Tony had one (or more) dildos longer and fatter than Steve’s cock. So he went with a tried-and-true average dildo that was passably realistic, which hopefully would make it easier for Steve’s future fantasies.
His lack of experience seemed expected, if not outright appreciated by the people who growled and rumbled with glee every time he stumped or grasped for anything to steady himself. The way they watched him, the lust in their eyes, told Tony volumes of how badly they wanted to be a part of breaking in a new human pet. Terrified that they might try to make it all come true by taking him from Steve by force, Tony closed his eyes and dreamed of a private time between himself and a human lover, a man who knew just how to make the most of his body with the vice-like strength of his hands, the slow, controlled roll of his hips, and self-assured confidence of his voice.
Steve held on, fucking Tony through his aftershocks as Tony continued to shudder and jerk his hips in his pleasure, groaning and drooling around his mouthful of Steve’s forearm. Slowly, he eased down from the force of his orgasm, and with a deep, guttural moan of satisfaction, Tony rolled his hips back to meet Steve’s leisurely thrusts. He was high on endorphins, high on life, and all he seemed to need anymore was Steve’s fat cock filling him. He followed the gentle nudge of Steve’s arm, twisting so they came face to face again and Tony could reach his mouth, sucking on his bottom lip with lazy interest and watching the dazed smile that spread over Steve’s face. The next time Steve was buried to the hilt inside him, Tony squeezed down around him; he purred at the sight of Steve’s eyes rolling back into his head, and he chased the victory with a sloppy, needful kiss. This time he heard Steve gasp his name, quiet but unmistakable.
Steve watched as Clint shrugged at what was undoubtedly part of every-day life, while Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. Clearly, he accepted the news with far less grace than his brother.
“How could I say no? I mean, is there a better audience in the world?” he said, easily scoring bonus points and applause with pandering flattery.
Except, when he tried, Tony wouldn’t answer his first or his second call. After the third attempt, Steve used an added feature on his phone to forced the call through onto speakerphone.
“Stephanie is right,” Tony agreed when Clint seemed to wheeze in complaint about not using their most effective weapon. “You said it yourself, Clint: How many men who have searched for Stephanie do you think have done so with genuine compassion? It’s gotten us this far, we can’t stop now.”
“Nothing like that, Steve,” Tony eventually sighed while Steve strained to catch the cues Tony tried to hide. “Thor and Danvers confirmed it: we don’t know how, but Thanos is history, and—that’s done, okay? This is about you and the samples we started working on two years ago - remember, after Future-You said Hydra kept him alive and used him? Bruce and I started working on a formula that could sedate super soldiers for that worst-case scenario?”
“It was great while it lasted, and… just, being honest about who you are, about how you feel about another person, whether it’s a man or a woman, I can’t,” Tony stopped himself abruptly and heaved a quiet, frustrated sigh. “I really appreciated that about him, you know? Bisexual doesn’t exist in Hollywood—gay barely does, but people like me and him? It’s exhausting being with people who hide or, I don’t know, pretend it’s a phase. Being with him, I didn’t have to explain anything, or hide anything. That… that was nice, you know? Honesty.”
“Nothin’ will hurt you,” he eventually said, and he squeezed Tony against his side. “Safe Tony, sleep, shhh…”
He blinked up at the body seated at the foot of the bed. Howard? It couldn’t be. Steve and Bucky had been pallbearers at his funeral. He remembered Maria weeping, he remembered the service.
Steve made a quiet, plaintive noise under his breath, just loud enough for Tony to hear. Tony took the hint easily.
Tony’s well-practiced smile warmed with genuine relief. “We got a working anesthetic for Barnes from your samples. We’ll be able to put him under for four hours, maybe five. Five’s pushing it, we’ll work on it, but for now we only need three. Helen will be here Friday and we’ll get his arm reattached, pain free.”
Those wicked fingers were all too familiar with Tony’s most guarded secrets. Steve only pressed chaste, reassuring kisses to Tony’s chest as he worked three thick fingers into him, dutifully steering away from Tony’s spot and minimizing distractions to let Tony indulge in the gradual stretch—the initial resistance, the blunt, burgeoning pleasure, and the inevitable
The rock found its mark between the beast’s eyes with perfect accuracy, and he crumbled to the floor with a fallen log. His end was the spark that lit the fuse. With a roar of vengeful rage, the handful of villains rushed at the dozen waiting Scraps. The Scraps has the advantage of numbers and perhaps even weapons, but their enemies were twisted with decades of hate and a lifetime of crime. They fell back in the first onslaught, but as Natasha and the super soldiers regained their footing, the tide of battle began to turn.
The guilt of bringing Tony to tears threatened to choke him, and Steve scrubbed a hand over his cheeks to wipe his own tears away. It hurt to watch, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop. Why had they filmed this? Why had they thought it would help? He missed Tony terribly, but it hurt now to see how loosely his clothes fit and how his strong fingers trembled.
“In that case, the court rules in favor of the defense. Mr. Barnes is hereby awarded primary custody of the children. Mrs. Hansen is awarded half of the marital assets, or thirty-seven million dollars.”
Without getting up, Steve reached up between Tony’s legs and started slowly spreading the warming lube between his cheeks. Tony whimpered the first time Steve’s arm grazed against his straining erection, but otherwise he remained obediently still, even spreading his thighs as Steve guided his legs apart. With his legs spread widely, Steve smeared slick coats of lube up and down the crack of his ass, getting him good and sloppy wet all between his cheeks. Now and then when his fingers brushed over Tony’s hole, Steve slowed his touch, circling it without penetrating him until Tony was powerless to control the rutting thrusts of his hips.
Whether he meant to pause or not, the audience’s reaction forced his hand. It started as thundering applause and grew into a standing ovation, whistles and hollering and an incredible, sustained roar that Steve felt deep in his bones. He wanted to run out to them and share in the excitement, but all he could do was thank them over and over again, until eventually they were reined in and told to sit.
All around them, the bullpen fell quiet. Instinctively, Bucky and Steve turned to look at the figures occupying the hallway. They all matched, with their blue windbreaks and polished shoes. Their bored glances around the bullpen betrayed little, except for the guy at the very front. The guy with the sunglasses and the tailored suit.
“You can’t have heroes without freedom, Tony,” Steve told him quietly. “This world Pierce has created could not exist with freedom. Individuality, diversity, a desire to do better. Everything that makes America the country I love. The country I will fight for. You’ve chased those people away and forced them to live like animals in the sewers.”
“What fucking context could possibly make that acceptable?” Tony demanded, glaring at him in a rage with his arms crossed tightly across his chest. He stood in the far corner of the elevator, as far from where Steve hovered in the doorway as he could be.
“My favorite scratching is being told I’m right, extensively,” Tony said with a deadpan delivery that had Steve shamelessly cracking up. “But, about specific things! I—you know when you recommend a TV show, or a book, or a podcast, whatever to someone? There is nothing I find more satisfying than getting texts or calls from friends telling me how much they liked it.”
A shaky smile wobbled across Tony’s face, as if he wasn’t sure if he should laugh or cry again. “You were safe in Berlin,” he whispered in accusation. “It gave me comfort, knowing you were safe in Berlin. Whatever happened to me, you would live.”
There was a momentary pause on the other line, presumably while she investigated the question. “Generally, prepare for rain," she eventually told him, “and temperatures range from mid-40s to high 60s. They’ve got venomous snakes, so wear boots if you got them.”
Steve snapped his mouth shut and gave Tony a flat look. “How about you stop talking and go fix that fence? Be back by one if you want the rolls hot out of the oven.”
Steve’s valiant brain short circuited. In one moment he was desperately trying to think of how to cover his lap without giving away the obvious, and in the other, he couldn’t think of what word was the opposite of
Mr. Perfect laughed, a warm, deep chuckle that left Tony’s side tingling where their bodies pressed together. Until they reached the dining room, of course, and Mr. Perfect helped Tony into a chair and cut him off from the incredible strength, heat, and comfort of his body.
But Steve’s gaze swept over Tony’s strong hands and forearms, over his finely made robes, and down the trail of glimmering silver chains decorating his bared chest. All Steve needed was Tony, and if Tony was amendable, the two pots of honey.
A long beat passed between Tony cursing himself for his blind trust in Steve and hearing what Steve actually said.
Did elevators have security cameras? What were the odds that a man like this had enough lawyers to put Steve away for defending himself?
Steve slipped into the room and let the door click shut behind him. With quiet, confident steps, he picked his way across the room, neatly avoiding the cramped desk stacked three, four feet high with textbooks and binders, and tip-toeing past the landslide of stinky laundry,
“What evidence she has for claiming he cheated and that he was not sober while they were apart,” Maria said first.
Steve turned to frown at where Tony was already bent over at the computer to plug in a thumb drive. “That’s your big plan? Fishing? Tony, who’s to say he even has a safe?”
“Thank you, Sparky,” he murmured against Steve’s lips, and when he leaned back, he was smiling up at Steve with a contagious, buoyant affection. “You know, I’m gonna miss you today. The lake was fun yesterday, with you. Can’t believe you’re letting me go alone today… think you can make it up to me when I get back?”
“The legal discourse will be tangled at best, I cannot deny that this is unprecedented, but no man—”
He ended up signing twelve receipts and walking out of Shake Shack with a free meal. Time to wander down the street and eat his food in peace before calling Happy.
“That’s it,” Tony murmured with a broad grin, so pleased with the parking job that he reached across to gently squeeze Steve’s knee. “Darling, I love the way you handle a truck.”
The car understood Tony’s request, and without the need for buttons or even a touchscreen, the radio turned on at a reasonable volume.
Looked like Peggy hadn’t managed to suppress it after all. Steve sighed, but found himself more frustrated by the appearance of secrecy than what the ‘secret’ was about. The last thing he wanted was for people to think he had been bi all along and actively pretended otherwise. As if his orientation was something to be ashamed of, or worse - that he could be ashamed of Tony.
“Your best friend, you said?” Tony teased Steve, pulling back to watch him with an adoring smile. “So delightful.”
Tony whistled twice, long, high-pitched notes that brought Dummy dutifully, happily, trotting to the porch. With a hand in Dummy’s mane, Tony swung himself up onto his back, and spun his horse around to chase after the speeding truck.
in Vancouver, and they had to put me in maternity clothes because I’d put on forty-five pounds to look like an alien. I was supposed to be a custodian—someone who blends into the background—and here I show up looking like Luca Brasi,” Tony said with a self-deprecating roll of his eyes, then for clarification for those who didn’t know, he quickly explained, “Don Corelone’s enforcer.”
,’ and started the coveted task of unwrapping his lover. It was fairly easy business unzipping his jacket and getting one naked arm out of its sleeve, but Steve was snoozing on his side, trapping his other arm.
Tony perched a respectful distance away on the bed. The concern in his voice caught Steve by surprise, and he quickly shook off his daydreams and shoved more of the duvet over his lap in an effort to give Tony his undivided and PG-rated attention.
, okay. Cool cool cool. But,” he added in a quieter voice, “uh, thank you for trusting me. I will keep the news to myself.”
“Allow them to put me in the freezer, yeah, I heard you,” Steve said, slowing his pace before taking stock of his surroundings and turning in the general direction of Pierce’s offices. Soon, they would emerge into the garden that was the Governor’s backyard, and what would Tony do then?
The miserable butt plug fell to the ground. Marple dutifully picked it up, and without acknowledging it, Mr. Perfect helped Tony balance so he could take it and stuff it into his pocket where no-one else had to see it again.
This time, Tony felt a little less embarrassed in his reaction. It was nice to feel like he wasn’t the only one excited for their next date. Steve slept naked, so there wasn’t much to grab on to - Tony took him by the hair and pulled him in for a happy, sloppy kiss and didn’t let go until his man was moaning putty in his hands.
His partner stared back at him, jaw slack and paler than he had been seconds ago. “Tony Stark,” he breathed, horrified. “Extinguished lives are ‘minor blunders’? How could you—”
Something slammed and shattered against the front door, and Tony jerked back instinctively. “Go away, Stark!” Thor roared, destroying something else against the door. But this time, Tony kneeled down at the door instead of retreating, pulling out a small lock-picking kit out of his wallet to start working on the door.
Except, Steve was too impatient to wait for their new equipment to arrive: he wanted to take Tony out into the world at first opportunity.
“As primates, our closest relatives are chimpanzees, then the gorilla. All of us found different ways to deal with sperm competition, which is a male’s race to make sure he produces as many offspring as possible. The gorilla did it by physically becoming strong: they fight for control of a small troop of females. Because their genitalia has nothing to do with their chances of reproduction, they have one of the smallest penis-to-body ratios of any animal on the planet.”
“Please,” he tried instead. “If you could see yourself through my eyes… be kind to my husband, mein Schafes. Don’t ask me to watch him suffer a fever so carelessly.”
“You choose, I’ll pay,” he promised as he came back to the bed, and before Tony knew what happened, Steve had scooped him up in his arms to toss him further up the bed, so Tony sprawled haplessly in the center. Tony hurried to push up on his elbows and watch Steve crawl up the bed after him on his hands and knees.
Forget the fact that Steve had no idea what the dispute was, what it was called, or who was involved. He didn't know what she was talking about, let alone why he would have an answer in the first two minutes of the lecture. In his sudden spike of distress, Steve could only gawp up at her and try to fill in the blanks with his best possible guess.
Curiosity, affection, and a touch of exasperation quickly pushed aside the last traces of insecurity that had clawed their way into Steve’s thoughts. “That’s a first. You’re asking for permission?” Steve teased. “Who are you and where is Tony Stark?”
He had to play it cool. Brock couldn’t know he had guessed the night’s highlight weeks in advance; it would only make him more nervous about getting it right. So Steve did his best to keep one hand on his champagne flute and the other in his lap where Brock couldn’t see his fingers drumming impatiently in his lap.
Dr. Odinson looked confused for a while, but as understanding dawned, he blurted out, “Are you saying you are a virgin, Steve?”
“And they’re the best fucking rat burgers I’ve ever had, Steve,” Bucky promised with a cheeky grin, and to Tony’s horror, Steve only laughed back.
“Mr. Stark, are you there?” he heard Steve call through the phone. “This is not your fault. The murderer is to blame, not you. But you can be a part of ending it. Each of the victims deserve justice, Mr. Stark. You can help us give them that. Give closure to their families.”
“You mean that, Tony?” he asked. “It wouldn’t have anything to do with the Superman suit I’m wearing, would it?”
Except, Brock wasn’t the one he found first. Across the room he spotted Sharon with a few of her friends, all of them modestly dressed in cashmere and pearls.
“Can’t bear to watch, Tony?” he growled between sucking wet, biting kisses to the soft skin behind Tony’s ear. “Will that set you off, watching me? My lips stretched over your thick, gorgeous cock?”
in the 80’s and Neil deGrasse Tyson’s continuation later in the 21st, and over Tony’s chrome rimmed, white finish tables hung framed posters of
“Never could I have imagined your legendary accomplishments could be true, Steve Rogers, but now you are before my eyes and there is no other truth. With your help, I have no doubt we will soon apprehend the cruel maniac,” Tony rushed to say between his gulping breaths, “it is only a matter of time before we all can witness you blow him off!”
Steve’s expression turned grim as he looked over the letters Tony had pulled aside. They weren’t typical examples of one-sided love or desperate cries for attention. They weren’t even homophobic rants. The first letter was chock-full of vitriolic attacks on Tony personally, presumably from a collaborator who felt inadequately compensated for her research and input. In her letter, she outlined her fantasy of engaging a gun for hire not to kill Tony, but to make his life so miserable that he would only end his misery by taking his own life. In the next letter, a man accused Tony of rape after he did not feature their sexual encounter in his books. By not following through with his presumptions, Tony had taken advantage of him in a vulnerable state and the man vowed vengeance on Tony for his assault.
“Then I’ll make it quick, Governor,” Steve replied without dawdling over pleasantries. “You designed an entire society of followers and pushovers to flatter your ego, but with them, you have no way to control your Scraps and problem makers who don’t care for your cult. So, instead of working with them on a compromise, what do you do? You program Rumlow’s rehab so he’d come out of Cryo as the perfect 22nd century terrorist.”
“You leave me speechless, Agneta. In fact, I fear you leave me no choice. Would you do me and his Majesty, my husband, the honor of joining us at the palace in Eisenturm next June in celebration of the solstice? Every year we celebrate those who allow Consone to thrive, and I cannot imagine such a celebration this year without your attendance.”
It wasn’t long before Tony came to the bedside of an older woman who had no-one watching over her. The little sign at the foot of her bed clearly indicated her name, that she was allergic to shellfish, and that her language of preference was
Steve cursed and jumped at the unexpected sound of Tony’s voice. Tony laughed in his triumph, and leaned in to steal a kiss while his husband still looked disgruntled. Steve had found a seat near one of the smaller fireplaces in a corner, well concealed from staff and politicians alike. It was unclear how long he had been hiding in his books, but this late in the year, it was difficult to mind the hours at all. No sunshine shone through the library’s tall windows, and the world outside the palace looked so bleak that only the occasional dusting of snowflakes gave depth to the darkness of the winter’s day.
The alarm in Steve’s voice caught Tony’s attention and he looked up in time to see Steve heading for the door to the hallway.
“Stark!” Steve snapped in a sudden rage. “Those are people! Living, breathing people like you and me. Hurting people is not a good time. Well, okay, sometimes it is…” he conceded quietly before returning to his point. “But they didn’t look like anything more than a bunch of desperate people trying not to starve. This is a future you’re celebrating?” he snarled at Tony and the Governor. “Shunning people in need because they’re not like you?”
When Steve stepped out of the bedroom and let his robe spill to the floor, Tony cut himself off so abruptly he practically swallowed his tongue. The silence was deafening. Steve wouldn’t let himself twitch, as if he was comfortable standing in the middle of a well lit room in nothing but black garters, a black lacy thong, and his beat up combat boots. He wore his dog tags around his neck, the way Tony liked.
But Rumlow wasn’t there for archaic relics of his own time. This was the future, damnit. Where were the phaser guns?
Steve grunted as he tried to sit up, but every part of his body ached in a terrible way and he only managed to roll onto his side. “I would, too,” he replied with a huff of dry amusement. He still wasn’t sure why Bucky had followed him, but he’d been grateful not to do it all alone.
The team shouted after them, mostly either cheering Bucky on because they admired a man who could take one for the team, or because this was clearly his last day on earth.
“And you don’t think the rest of your family gets star-struck? How would you keep it together when you’re having breakfast next to Spider-man?”
He couldn’t wait to be home, but in that moment, it felt exciting to share a new experience with Tony as it happened. Except, of course, Tony was surely sound asleep in Consone, and so Steve wished him a good morning, and sent the video to start his day.
Steve closed his eyes and pretended not to pay attention, but without the sound of traffic or talking neighbors, there was nothing for him to hear but the sounds Tony made. Steve heard his careful footsteps and the shuffle of linens as he retrieved a spare blanket from the closet. With his eyes faithfully closed, Steve laid perfectly still and listened to Tony climbing into bed, clearly making every effort not to disturb Steve as he settled down to sleep.
“I think I ate two sausages and half a pound of potatoes on my own,” Tony announced immediately, because hell yes, and he’d do it again given the chance. “So much wine. Steve ate every sausage.”
Steve might never understand what was going on, but he could see the care and attention that Tony put into his work—he knew where everything was, and even what the once-discarded scraps could be employed to do. Nothing was a waste, nothing was useless in Tony’s hands, and if Steve didn’t love him already he’d been a lost cause.
“I can follow your logic Steve Rogers, but you simply cannot accuse the savior of our city of being connected with this vicious multi-murder-death-killer.”
He hadn’t made it half-way through his dinner before he realized the pounding storm and howling winds were suspiciously articulate.
“As do you,” Steve replied, then after some thought found it to be true. They fell into a companionable silence after that, making their way to the theater arm in arm.
Tony rolled his eyes, but he finally gave in. “I think somebody needs a nap,” he cooed in a playful sing-song, kneeling up on the bed and straddling Steve’s hips to lean over him and tug on his zip-up. “Wanna take this off, gorgeous? You’ll sleep better.”
Steve had gotten the message loud and clear. He had pulled away and shoved Tony down onto his back, pinning Tony to the mattress with one big paw over his chest. After that, it didn’t matter how Tony squirmed and thrust his hips. Steve was strong enough to hold him down, and he kept Tony spread out for himself like a banquet feast. Tony had learned quickly that day that Steve wasn’t a man to bullshit or tip-toe around sex.
“No lie,” Steve promised, holding up his hands in further expression of innocence. “I’ll call Cambridge myself and get you the job. Hell, I’ll call Imperial College London, they’ve got a great engineering program—”
From behind him, Tony snickered to himself. “Is this your villain origin story, Steve? A failed date?”
“I lived in the East,” he explained while he gnawed on a raw turnip. Tony couldn’t stop staring at his teeth. “I thought I was safe in the mountains, but one night it was cold, and I had to build a fire. Women found me by morning. Their chief is old, and she has not yet had a daughter. I was in her bed for a week before I escaped.”
“God bless you, boy,” Maria grinned down at him, giving him his glass of water and ruffling his hair. Like he was just another kid in the house.
“I figured,” Bucky sighed, already peering out to see if Tony was out of sight. They weren’t far from Shield, maybe four blocks, but Tony was already taking the most direct route. That meant Steve and Bucky would have to book it to reach Shield first the long way around.
He watched in silence from the sidelines as Bucky comforted his ward, helped Steve through his grief and even helped him find his smile again. The Scraps gathered around them at Bucky’s request, introducing themselves to Steve with genuine smiles and eager handshakes.
“I mean, how does he feel about children, and how many will he want to have? How did his parents raise him? Are they in the picture, would he expect you to move if you have a family?”
and type out five little words: he’ll call you back later!’ But the bigger part of him remembered what week ten of a crash diet felt like, and that was the voice Steve tried to hang on to before he acted defensively.
“They finally found Giordani’s car, hauled it out of the East River,” he said and got up for his coat. “It’s on its way to the lab, I’ll call in if anything turns up.”
It was the witch from Stromwell’s class! Steve didn’t know whether he should be sick or livid, and as Sharon held out her hand to him, there was nothing but contempt in her eyes.
“And, if you don’t know the answer or understand the question, they just kick you out? That’s normal?”
“Then my dad said,” Steve continued more quietly, nuzzling into Tony’s hair. “‘What’s he going to do with a ring? Get him something he can use.’”
It was new, it was all new, and without thinking Steve hugged the pillow to his chest and bit into it to muffle the embarrassing string of aborted gasps and whines Tony was drawing out of him. At the first sign of easing tension, he felt Tony push his thumbs in deeper and stretching him open. Again the chilling reality clawed at him, and Steve squeezed his eyes shut and clutched the pillow in his arms to brace himself for Tony’s cock. He reminded himself that whatever sound he made needed to be Tony’s name; men liked hearing their names.
“Give me one week,” Tony said in the pregnant silence left by Steve’s lack of an answer. “Four gay men are gone, Steve. In our city. Let me help.”
Steve’s first clear thought when he woke up was that his head felt lopsided and disconnected from his body. He didn’t know where he was, how he’d gotten there, and his attempts to piece it together failed. A fog weighed on heavily him, smothering his senses. Steve scrambled to shake off the delusions detracting him from scraping together what happened to him, but reality was slippery and hazy, and his drug-addled thoughts quickly turned against him in mortal panic.
“This is exactly what I thought it would feel like,” Tony whispered as he inched closer. Steve could feel the feather-light touch of his fingers over his lower back sweeping up the breadth of his shoulders. “Every fantasy come true, except… now, it’s you.”
Almost by accident, the alien’s silken finger brushed over Tony’s spot, and all at once Tony’s body lit up with feverish excitement again. His sudden show of interest was all it took. With renewed confidence, the student used his unusual features to his advantage, and with a dexterity that had Tony’s eyes rolling back into his head, he rubbed his long, silken thumb over Tony’s prostate and used his other fingers to caress and roll his balls in the palm of his slippery, cool hand. Tony’s skin felt like it was burning and his cock hung hard and heavy between his thighs, so hard now it was flushed unnaturally dark against his skin.
“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Bruce mumbled without picking his head off the floor. “That… that Amanda? She sounds great for subject number two.”
“I can buy a new mattress,” Tony said, but the idea still made him grimace. “Uh. Commission a new bed?”
“No,” Tony interrupted Steve before he said any more. “Don’t. Don’t ‘oh, Tony’ me, like I’m some wayward child. Like I’m a victim. I lost everything that was important then. They all look at me here, they see I’m different. I’m not as strong. I’ll never go on a drive with my brother again, I’ll never feel the rush of the cage. The only horse I can ride anymore is Dummy, because I broke him in, he’s only ever been mine, and he’s so familiar I could ride him in my sleep. But my life now,” Tony said with a small, but genuine smile, “Steve, I’m enjoying my life. I apply myself in other ways, not just physical strength. It’s a second chance; how many people can say they had that?”
“Wasn’t him,” Tony remembered with a smile. “I was dating this Colombian girl at the time, Magdalena, she was a dancer. I’m talking professional, tours around the world, lives in Mexico City. She hadn’t really been confident in her English at first either, but she told me she would never have seen the world or met the people she loved if she hadn’t tried anyway. She encouraged me to take that first meeting, and Sam Mendes was there. I didn’t know why a director would be part of hiring a role as small as mine, but the way he talked about the Secret Empire, about his vision for my part in it… he was so sure, I didn’t feel like I had to worry.”
“How about, I’ll ask you a question,” Tony said with a simple, matter of fact tone. “And for every answer you get right… I’ll take one piece of clothing off.”
Steve sat down on a bench outside the library and tried to get his thoughts together. He had tried so hard and come so far, and still he was miserable and alone. He missed his mom, he wanted to talk to her so badly, but Wednesdays were her early shifts and she’d already be asleep. If he woke her up with a phone call, she’d think it was an emergency no matter what he said.
They had done a rush job of evening Steve’s hair and beard out with clippers before his release from Cryoprison, but here, the barber took his time. He worked with care, and if Steve closed his eyes, the white noise of shuffling feet and quiet conversation let him imagine he was kicking around in Clarence’s old barbershop around the corner, and Bucky was trying to chat some girl up from the stoop.
“Tony, you hungry?” Bucky asked Tony, pushing a menu at him. “You eat, right? Steve usually goes for the wings, but I’m telling you, get the shepherd’s pie. Natasha likes the pork belly pot stickers, if that’s something you go for...” he added, leaning in close to point it out on the menu.
