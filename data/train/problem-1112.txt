“Mmm sleeping,” said Sherlock in a muffled voice behind him.  John could feel Sherlock’s face nuzzling into John’s neck, and he chuckled, enjoying the feeling of a snoozy hug.  Pretty good first morning on holiday, if he said so himself.
Lestrade snorted with laughter then tried to school his face after receiving a quick glare from Sherlock.  Sherlock was so earnest, and really looked quite vulnerable in this moment.
John growled in his throat, thrusting a little into Sherlock’s hand as he buried his face in Sherlock’s neck.
“If you mean, why am I not dressed in a collared shirt and work trousers, the answer is that it’s the weekend and I’m not working today.”
Sherlock’s head popped around the door again, while the rest of him remained hidden.  John struck a sarcastic pose, modelling for Sherlock.  He gave John a thoughtful once over, ignoring the pose, and pronounced the outfit, “Splendid!  I like that colour on you, John.  Also your calves look particularly shapely in that length of short.”
“Yes, of course!  Look, I know it’s not very “me” in the way you know me, but I’ve had a lot of time on my hands and I wanted it to be perfect.” Sherlock bit his lip nervously, and then looked back at John. “I know I probably went a bit overboard, but I really enjoyed it.”
John paused, thinking about what that meant.  Unlike Lestrade to share a detail he didn't think was important.  John wasn’t that surprised that the physical side of a potential relationship would be the biggest barrier for Sherlock – he’d written a special FAQ for it, after all – but he was surprised that Sherlock had raised it with Lestrade of all people, even though Lestrade had been the only one there.  John wondered what Lestrade had advised.  He half wanted to respect the privacy of their conversations yesterday, but he was deeply curious too.
John thought for a moment.  “Ok, here’s one for me.  Not a sexual one.  It’s important to me that you acknowledge me when I come home in the evenings.  It doesn’t need to be a big deal, but I would like it if you looked up from your work, or your book, or whatever, when I come in.  Obviously… you know… not if it would be super disruptive to you.  But if you’re just there and you’re aware I’ve entered, that acknowledgement is important to me.”
He strode back to his chair and dug in the gap between the cushion and the chair’s arm, looking for his phone.  Blasted thing always fell out of his pocket and down the side.  Scooping it up, and brushing the crumbs that also inhabited that space casually onto his trousers, Sherlock sent a text.
“No – I tried to talk him out of leaving straight away.  I thought you’d have questions, and that it’d probably be better to discuss what this meant for the two of you.  But he was sure, so I didn’t push it.”
Lestrade watched Sherlock closely, with his head cocked slightly to one side.  “Was it really?  I guess, I’m pretty surprised that you didn’t know that already.”
“I know that was a lot to share with you, John.  You want a relationship, and I upped the ante with the children thing.  It’s fine if that’s not what you want.  But I do want to be honest with you, and that’s what I was thinking about.”
John thought about this.  It was still, to John, a heart-wrenching thing to say, but he knew what Sherlock meant.
They smiled at each other then, both still nervous, but hopeful too.  Sherlock stood awkwardly, unsure where he should put himself, and John wondered if he should get out of bed.  Sherlock realised that he’d been so focussed on making it to John, to this moment, he hadn’t put enough thought into what he’d say when he actually got here.
“Yes, I think we should,” Sherlock said seriously.  Sherlock returned to his seat and Lestrade stepped neatly around into John’s.  He looked evenly at Sherlock, noting the worried expression and the nervous twisting of hands.  It was the most jittery Lestrade had seen Sherlock in years.  Actually, Lestrade thought to himself, the most jittery he’d seen Sherlock since John had come into his life.  He took a deep breath, noted idly that he hadn’t been offered a tea, then breathed out as he remembered his role here.  He caught Sherlock’s eye once more, and Sherlock began.
“I won’t ask what those reasons are – I think that’s probably between the two of you – but I’m really happy for you, Sherlock.  Assuming this is what you want, of course.”
Pulling away, Sherlock silently knelt on the floor at John’s feet, eyeing John’s cock directly.  “Now, you know I’ve never done this before, so go easy on me…” Sherlock started to say, looking up at John.  John’s head shot forward immediately, and he stared wide-eyed down at Sherlock before him.
“But, I know this is really big for you.  And I don’t expect you to know exactly how you feel when you’ve had this information for less than a day.  I really hope you’ll find that you feel the same way, but I mean it when I say that I’ve prepared for that not to be the case.  That’s just the chance I had to take, if I wanted to have the possibility that you might care for me too.”
Mummy shook her head with a smile. “Oh, our brownie wouldn’t like that. It would be like paying them, you see, and you mustn't ever pay a brownie. They aren’t servants, and if you ever treat them like one, they’ll soon leave.”
“I’m heading back to the hotel now. Should take me about thirty minutes. See you soon, love.” John said, sounding back to his usual self.
Whatever game Magnussen had planned now, Sherlock was quite sure it wasn’t Magnussen who was about to be embarrassed. He stepped out of his trousers and pants, heading towards the ensuite bathroom.
Sherlock wouldn’t disobey a direct order, even one as gently given as that. He opened his eyes, gazing hazily up at John. His pupils were wide pools of black, and his eyes were glazed with tears. John watched and waited for a few seconds, and Sherlock blinked a few times, consciousness returning.
Having assigned Sherlock this monumental task, he then proceeded to make it almost impossible by lowering his head and swiping his tongue over Sherlock’s pink and quivering hole.
John nodded again. “I’m not going to leave him. I-” He glanced towards the stairs. “I love him.” He said quietly. “And he seems to feel the same, even though I’ve...made a lot of mistakes. So. I’m doing my best.”
Sherlock twisted in John’s hold, gazing up at him with a returned look of adoration. John leaned down to kiss him, slowly and sweetly, not letting up until they were both gasping for breath.
John soon realised that Sherlock took after his mother in the sense that she, too, covered her negative emotions by throwing herself into a task with frenetic energy. As far as he could tell, she hadn’t stopped except to eat and sleep since they arrived, spending the whole day calling various people to make arrangements, and baking endlessly. The rest of them helped out where they could, arranging flowers and snaffling scones when she wasn’t looking.
John took several moments to catch his breath as Sherlock wiped them both off with the sheet. Then he pulled Sherlock close to him, wrapping his arms around him like an exceedingly handsome and cuddly octopus.
Gosh, this chapter was hard to get out. I had to get up and walk around every two or three sentences because it was just. Too much to write down all at once. And i spent way too long looking at the Google Maps street view of Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, I want to wear it.” He didn’t mind a little discomfort. It could even serve as a nice reminder.
Sherlock blinked slowly, then hummed in acknowledgement. “Good idea.” He agreed. “Take a break from all the pasta.” He rolled onto his back, stretching. “Think I might have a wank today.” He added, glancing up at John.
“I only wanted to see, how far you would go.” Magnussen was saying. “That was the furthest I could think to go. And yet you accepted, did you not, Mr. Holmes? With nary a whimper. You do love him so.”
Sherlock screwed his eyes shut and came with a whimper, clamping his thighs together as his body trembled and shook.
John’s features softened. “I’m not leaving. I’m just going for a bit of a walk, get my head sorted. I’ll be back within the hour and then we can talk properly, okay?”
Sherlock stopped resisting the impulse, and slid to his knees beside John. John didn’t protest. He’d said his piece now, and he watched Sherlock, waiting to see what he would do. Sherlock reached up to cradle John’s face in his hands, his long fingers enveloping both sides of John’s head.
Mary looked between him and Sherlock, who had come in after John and was now standing behind him, looking primed and ready to jump in and intervene if the situation called for it. Her eyebrows rose.
John stared at Sherlock for a long moment, then broke out into a wide grin. “Yeah. Yeah, you’re right. That we do.”
John’s eyes glazed over as he jerked and shuddered, his cock hot and pulsing in Sherlock’s hand as he came, spurting over Sherlock’s hand and the rumpled white sheets. Sherlock stroked him through it, only stopping when John began to wince with oversensitivity.
It's the beginning of the end! I've been planning this for what seems like ages...almost two months! Can't believe I made it all this way. In terms of plot I think this is the most challenging fic I've ever written. Trying to get into the heads of Sherlock, Magnussen, Mycroft, all these brilliant and complicated people, trying not only to figure out what they would do, but how to engineer the situation to make them do what I want them to do while staying in character. Whew, what a ride. I was still hammering out the details of things last night.
This chapter is set a few days before the last. I don't normally jump around much with my chronology, but all will be explained in future chapters.
Always a light sleeper, John was sitting up in bed and switching on the bedside light even before he consciously registered another presence in the room.
“How’re you feeling, love?” John asked as he uncuffed Sherlock from the bed, briefly massaging Sherlock’s hands and feet to get blood flowing.
John, looking at Mycroft move, saw him move a brief moment before he heard the gun fire. He whipped his head back to Magnussen, and seeing a clear shot, immediately fired his gun directly into Magnussen’s brain.
“No, John.” He said earnestly. “That’s not it at all. You’re right, I have been...distracted. But it isn’t because you’re not enough, not at all. How could you think that? John, you’re- everything. You’re all I need.” He hesitated, glancing away, his hands falling to John’s lap. “Though, what you said- you’re not entirely wrong. I hadn’t thought about it that way until you said it but now that I have… I’ll admit that it’s entirely possible that were I to find myself in such a situation, there might be a part of me that could- derive some sort of pleasure from the experience.” He looked back up at John, earnest, pleading. “But it’s not that I want that, I don’t want to be- I’m yours. Completely.” He touched his fingers to his own chest, fingers unerringly tracing the inked letters there though his eyes never strayed from John’s face. “I don’t want anyone else, or any experience that isn’t given to me by you. There isn’t anyone who can do what you do for me. Because I love you. And- and you love me.”
Sherlock lifted the violin to his shoulder and, with a small, secret smile at John, began to play. John, recognising the melody, laughed, eyes lighting up, and Sherlock smiled wider, feeling himself warmed by the fondness in John’s gaze. The James Bond theme song wasn’t exactly a technically challenging piece, but still, John managed to look at him like he was playing Locatelli’s ‘Labyrinth’.
I love it when it's Sherlock who proposes. It's counter to the expectations of a lot of fans, because John's the 'romantic one', but you know, he's such a giant softie.
Sherlock nodded stiffly. John reached up, cupping Sherlock’s cheek, drawing him down for a long, lingering kiss. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed, and he exhaled softly, his lips otherwise unresponsive against John’s. John pulled away, glancing up at Sherlock and sighed, pressing another kiss to the tip of his nose.
“Fuck, that was gorgeous. God, Sherlock. Amazing.” John held on tight to Sherlock, and Sherlock snuggled back against him, panting lightly.
After a minute or two he was left with only one student, who was approaching his desk with a flirtatious smile. John smiled outwardly, but inwardly sighed. He could see where this was going. He’d had a few students attempt to proposition him, over his years of teaching. He’d only succumbed once.
“We aren’t in London.” John had pointed out mildly. “And you wanted to go to new York anyway.” That was one of the places on their extensive must-hit list.
It didn’t always go like that. Sometimes, instead of letting Sherlock suck on his fingers, he would have him lap at them like a kitten, or sometimes, rarely, he’d press in deeper, pushing his fingers in until Sherlock choked and gagged. No matter what it was, it quite frequently ended pretty much the same way.
John returned, as he had promised, less than an hour later. Sherlock, lost in his thoughts, startled to his feet when the door opened beside him. He -Sherlock- looked a bit of a mess. His hair was wild, and his still-unbuttoned shirt flapped open. John glanced at the spot on the floor next to the door where Sherlock had been sitting.
John took a moment to collect himself before getting up and knocking on Sherlock’s door. Sherlock grunted in response, and so John let himself in.
Now that Sherlock was there, John latched onto the opportunity to forestall the awkward conversation he’d just been dreading. “Sherlock, this is Sarah. One of my dedicated students who keeps coming for lectures.” John could see Sherlock’s eyes narrow in recognition from the John’s recounts of his day each evening. “Sarah, this is Sherlock, my fiance.” Sherlock wrapped an arm around John, not-so-subtly flashing the ring on his left hand. Sarah’s eyes widened.
“Yes, but I’m going to need a nice nap now.” John chuckled. “Maybe a massage first.” He added, giving Sherlock a pointed look.
She hugged him tighter at that, tearing up again. Siger wrapped his arms around her, and Sherlock tugged John away, the two sneaking silently back to the house to give them a moment alone. While waiting for them to return, John set about making tea for everyone.
Sherlock flushed as his pants and trousers were tugged off his ankles, leaving him naked in the cool air of the room. He regarded Magnussen nervously from his half-sitting position, uncomfortably aware of how he looked, even as he consciously told himself that he shouldn’t care. What did it matter how he looked? There was only Magnussen to see, and Sherlock cared nothing for what he thought. Except, Sherlock knew what he looked like. He chose his clothing carefully, to make himself taller, broader, more masculine- to protect his weakness and vulnerability from the rest of the world. No one had seen him completely naked since he was a child, not even John- no one until now.
I'm trying to keep the story pacing along. This won't be an endless travel montage, we'll probably skip over a few places. The focus of the story will remain Sherlock and John's developing relationship, with their travels as a kind of provocation and backdrop.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “No, I don’t need that. You don’t owe me anything, really, I phrased that badly. I just- I want to help, if I can, but I’m not sure what you need me to do.”
John watched as the very small handful of students who’d actually attended the lecture filed out, most calling out a cheerful goodbye as they left. The class he was teaching didn’t have a final exam, so after the mid-terms ended, attendance had dropped drastically. In a way it was disappointing that so few of his students really cared about the class beyond their grades, but at the same time it had left him with only the most passionate students, leading to rather interesting lessons. It was nice to hear voices other than his own for a change.
John toyed with and teased Sherlock’s nipples, pleased with Sherlock’s debauched appearance. “What do you want, Sherlock? Tell me.”
don’t make any sense. Can’t you just be happy?” His voice was fond, though. He didn’t resent Sherlock’s need to work everything out, even when it was standing in the way of his post-engagement snog.
“We’ve got reservations in an hour.” Sherlock muttered. He tossed his head back and began to bounce on John’s cock, moaning at the way his thick length spread him open, the feeling all the more intense when he hadn’t been prepared as thoroughly as John usually did.
“Hello, John.” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand. John pulled the covers over them, and Sherlock snuggled close, letting out a small, triumphant grin. This experiment hadn’t gone exactly as planned, but Sherlock was pretty sure he could call this one a rousing success.
Sherlock lowered his eyes. Those words- what he’d have given to hear it from someone, anyone else- someone whom he liked, someone who actually loved him.
Sorry, again, about my increasingly terrible update schedule. I dunno whose idea it was to put presentation week directly after the Chinese New Year festival, but it was definitely someone evil. Or dumb. Also I've been having issues with spotty wifi. It conks out ever half hour and i have to just stop everything and wait the ten to fifteen minutes it takes for it to spontaneously return so that I can continue writing. Alas, the spirit is willing but the internet is weak.
“I wish there was something I could do.” John murmured. “To make sure you’re never hurt again, in any way.”
John and his team were out on a routine patrol when they spotted the footprint. They didn’t recognise it for what it was, at first, it was so huge. It just looked like an oddly shaped dent in the ground. It was Murray who realised it first.
John slicked up the sound and carefully dripped lube in and around Sherlock’s slit, smiling slightly when he heard him gasp at the strange sensation. Grasping Sherlock’s hard, flushed cock in his hand, he positioned the sound at the opening of Sherlock’s cock and slowly slid it in.
“Want to get lunch before we head home?” John asked as they stepped out into the weak winter sunshine.
“Lovely.” Magnussen murmured, and Sherlock turned his face away. Magnussen’s eyes on him were like a physical touch, making Sherlock’s skin crawl.
Sherlock watched John’s face with bewilderment as it expressed something almost akin to relief before morphing into confusion.
John in the early morning was a wonder to behold, soft and sleepy against Sherlock’s side, every part of him limp and relaxed- well, almost every part. Sherlock held John close to him, pressing kisses to his cheeks and nose. John blinked awake, smiling hazily at Sherlock.
Sherlock hummed nonchalantly. “Most major European languages- German, Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, Portugese, a bit of Swedish and Polish. Other than English, obviously, I’m most comfortable in French and Greek. I learned Russian, too, and Mandarin. And I picked up bits here and there while I was...away. Mostly Arabic, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi- and Nepali, but the two are similar enough that it’s probably unfair to count it as knowing two languages. And Serbian, though I’d really rather not go there.”
“How do you think I got Sherlock to comply with me?” Magnussen laughed softly. “He knew if you found out it would destroy your happy little family. And he would do anything to stop that from happening. I really do mean
“Of course you’ve been counting.” He said fondly. “Alright, not hundreds, but close. My point, anyway, is that we’ve had many kisses, all of which have been wonderful, by the way.”
So there they were, on the thirty-first of December, ringing in the New Year from the balcony of a hotel room overlooking Times Square itself. How Sherlock had managed to wrangle that, John had no idea.
He patted Sherlock’s cheek, straightening up. “I’ll be in touch, Mr. Holmes.” Then he turned and left, leaving Sherlock with his churning thoughts.
Sherlock moaned helplessly as he nodded. John leaned down again to peck him chastely on the lips, then got up. “Good. Now get up. Breakfast.”
John took Sherlock’s hands in his, massaging them absentmindedly. Sherlock’s fingers were always cold- they were colder than John’s now, though John had just been outdoors in late autumn without his gloves on. John cleared his throat a few times, then in true John Watson style, jumped right in with little prevaricating.
John’s cheeks heated at the obscene noises Sherlock was making, pretending to poke around the safe and hoping Sherlock wouldn’t notice how affected he was just from that.
John shook his head. “No. That’s not-” He scrubbed at the side of his head with the heel of his hand, frustrated with himself. “I can’t explain it now, I’m still too worked up. I need to get my thoughts in order first.”
Other than just wanting Sherlock to enjoy himself, John actually had an ulterior motive for taking Sherlock to the Criminology Museum, one that appeared when it came to time for lunch. He’d known beforehand that he’d never have been able to drag Sherlock out of that museum for food, and he’d packed accordingly- sandwiches and juice boxes. Sherlock would never have agreed to even a snack break, but there was a strategy to getting him to eat, when he was excited and distracted. All John had to do was unwrap the food and place it in Sherlock’s hand, and as long as Sherlock had to do nothing more than bring it to his mouth, chew, and swallow, he’d finish the entire thing without even consciously registering that he was eating. This only worked for John, of course- he was the only one Sherlock trusted so completely, all the way down to a subconscious level. The ulterior motive, though, wasn’t that John was getting Sherlock to eat. It was what, precisely, he was giving him. Give Sherlock a glass of cranberry juice, and tell him to drink it, and he’d figure out his surprise in a hop, skip, and a jump. However, take him to a museum, present him with a panoply of old cases, and sneak juice boxes into his hand while he’s thinking, and he’ll be completely oblivious. Besides, he looked rather cute like that, pausing mid-crime ramble to sip at a juice box before continuing, not breaking stride for even a second.
Sherlock breathed out a slow sigh of relief. Sherlock this was just an ordinary episode of dysphoria. He’d had those, every now and then. Quite rarely, and never like this. He slumped over, leaning against John’s side.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up with interest as he nodded. They’d gone to the British Museum to see the new exhibit from the otherwise highly restricted Criminology Museum. The twenty old cases showcased there had completely absorbed Sherlock for the entire day. While they had all been solved already, the novelty of a case so removed from his own time- crimes committed and solved by people who had lived so differently from the way he did, that mentally walking through how he might have solved such a crime held an added layer of delightful complexity.
“God, yes. Come. I want to feel you.” John pounded into Sherlock, stroking his cock furiously. Sherlock’s back arched, and he stuffed the heel of his hand into his mouth to stifle his scream as he came, his arse clenching and fluttering around John’s cock.
Weeks pass without word from Magnussen. Sherlock heals, slowly. He escapes from hospital as soon as they will let him- he prefers the pain to the experience of being drugged, helpless, and almost naked while people bustle around and fuss over him. He doesn’t escape the being fussed over quite as much as he’d hoped, as once he goes back to Baker Street, Mrs Hudson is nearly always in the flat, bringing him unsolicited biscuits and tea and blankets. Even John keeps coming over, sometimes alone, and sometimes with Mary, who shoots him warning looks when John isn’t looking.
“Fuck no, you bastard. You don’t get to do this. Stand up and talk to me like an adult.” He growled.
The question had been running through his mind the entire time. He didn’t know which answer he preferred. Logically, he should want it to be a lie. Who would want to have a wife who’d shot his best friend? Yet if Magnussen had been telling the truth, it would mean that John’s moment of distraction hadn’t been because he’d fallen for Magnussen’s ludicrous lies. It lessened the sting of failure, just a little. In the back of his mind, John was also thinking that this was his way out. From the beginning of his marriage John realised that it had been a terrible idea; but this was a vague, shifting feeling, a hazy sense of discontentment that stood in stark contrast to Mary’s sunny smiles and cheery, easygoing demeanor. However, there was nothing sunny or cheery about shooting John’s best friend.
Magnussen's games are not usually as deadly as Moriarty's were, but they're both skilled at wielding suffering for Sherlock.
Magnussen’s ‘session’ with Sherlock had ended the way it usually did. Once he was done, Magnussen got up, gathering his clothes. Sherlock stared resolutely at the ceiling, waiting for Magnussen to exit. Instead of leaving, though, he returned to the bed, sitting down next to Sherlock.
“I wasn’t a good brother. I can’t- It’s hypocritical to be upset now, when there’s nothing I can do about it.”
“This isn’t because of your singing.” John interrupted impatiently. He hadn’t meant to reveal his feelings, but now that he had, he wasn’t about to let them get swept aside as a residual magical effect. “I’ve loved you for months.”
Sherlock chuckled softly. “Mine, I think. I suspect your present will render me rather too exhausted to give it to you.”
It occurred to me that I could end the story here. It's a good stopping point, in a sense. Things haven't been resolved, but the road to the resolution is clear enough that I could easily stop ad let you imagine the rest yourself. I won't, though. I still have some plans.
Mycroft Holmes was worried. The delicate balance of power between himself and Charles Augustus Magnussen that held them in stalemate was a long standing one, but in recent months, Magnussen had gained enough power that he was threatening to tip that delicate balance. He had Lady Smallwood in his grasp, along with several other key players in the government. Now it seemed he’d managed to dig something up on Sherlock as well. This was worrying for a number of reasons. Firstly, Mycroft had no idea what Magnussen was holding over Sherlock’s head. For all his supposedly dark past, Sherlock was rather open about it. It could be hardly be drugs, then, or anything else that an ordinary person might be ashamed to share with the world. Mycroft’s next thought was John Watson, but John had a clean past, free from any particularly dark secrets. All in all, Mycroft was clueless, and he didn’t like not being in the know. The second worrying thing was that, clearly, Magnussen was making good use of Sherlock now that he had him. Mycroft had watch of the CCTV on Baker Street, and Magnussen had been seen going into 221B numerous times. In that same time period, Magnussen had managed to dig up dirt on several more of Mycroft’s allies. Mycroft wasn’t stupid enough to think this was a coincidence. With Sherlock now on Magnussen’s side, Mycroft knew he stood little chance against Magnussen. Still, he felt a reluctance to act in such a way that might risk exposing his little brother. After a moment of consideration, he made a decision. Getting out his phone, he dialed the number of the one man whom he hoped would be able to get through to Sherlock.
He grasped Sherlock’s chin, gently tilting his face up, and leaned down to kiss him. Unconsciously, Sherlock let out a soft sound of distress. Everything about this was wrong, the way Magnussen’s facial hair rubbed against his skin, the way his huge hands cradled Sherlock’s head, trapping him there with an awful gentleness. Sherlock would have preferred if he’d been rough, if he’d pinned Sherlock down and taken what he wanted. This way, there was no escaping the knowledge that he chose this, that he’d been given an option and this was the path he’d decided to take, that he continued to choose, every second that he failed to fight back. Like this, he was entirely complicit in this situation, and he had no one but himself to blame.
Mycroft was unsurprised to be largely ignored during the exchange between John and Magnussen. Everyone in the room was well aware that between him and John, John was the greater threat. For all his genius, Mycroft spent most of his time behind a desk, while John had been a soldier, and spent his free time chasing criminals through the streets of London. Still, even as he did nothing, he wasn’t completely useless. While John had been distracted, Mycroft had a split second of warning as Magnussen reached for his gun. Mycroft thought, very, very quickly.
“Mummy, this is John. I don’t believe you’ve met.” Sherlock said as they entered the warm kitchen. He looked visibly relieved as his ploy worked, and he was released from his mother’s clutches.
Sherlock gave a lazy half-shrug. “About fourteen that I’d say I’m actually fluent in. Barely notable, really. The current living record is fifty-nine languages, and there are accounts of people who knew eighty to two hundred, depending on how strict you are on how fluent they had to be and what constitutes a language.” His words were dismissive but his tone was pleased. He always enjoyed a chance to impress John.
Sherlock didn’t reply. He stared out the window as the car began to move, heading west. “We’re going to Appledore.” He murmured as they turned onto the A40.
Sherlock huffed, somewhat put out, but he tangled his fingers with John’s, leaning in to brush his lips against the tip of John’s nose. He had anticipated that John might have concerns, but he’d hoped that by catching him in the early mornings, he might stave of that conversation until he’d sufficiently proved his capabilities. It should have worked. For an army man, John was remarkably partial to his lie-ins. Then again, his fondness for sleep paled in comparison to his love for Sherlock- something Sherlock both marvelled at on a daily basis and frequently forgot to factor into his calculations.
I added this note to the first chapter, because I forgot to mention this when I posted, but for those who've already read the first chaper, I'll put it again here. The timeline for this fic is after all the other fics in this series, between two and five years after the ending of In Safe Hands. I know, that's a wide range. I'm a fuzzy writer (naughty and lazy, I know. Sorry).
Sherlock’s eyes tracked the movement of John’s hand with interest. “If you’d like to take of the rest your clothes,” he suggested casually, “I think I’d quite like that.”
For a while, it seemed as though they might actually walk from Appledore to Wotton-Under-Edge in silence. Sherlock led the way, unerringly following the directions he’d memorised. A couple of kilometres passed before John spoke.
“She’d just been through a traumatic experience, and you were an insensitive prick. She didn’t need that, and you know it. Or you would’ve, if you’d stopped for even a second to consider her feelings. But you didn’t, did you? You just barrelled in without a care, with no thought for what she’d just gone through. Or, hell, maybe you just didn’t realise because if it’d been
John allowed Sherlock to crush his hand in his vice-like grip with nary a wince, looking with concern at his friend. He placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s cheek, but the other man flinched away as if he had been burned.
John got to his feet, groaning as his back clicked audibly. “Alright. But come get me if you need me, okay? For anything at all.”
Magnussen lifted his head, smirking up at Sherlock in triumph. He’d been disappointed, initially, by Sherlock. He liked his prey with a little life in it, and Sherlock had been so still, and so silent- a far cry from the sweaty, panting mess that now lay before him. He moved so that he could could kiss Sherlock’s lips, letting him taste himself. He reached down, fingers sliding over Sherlock’s now wet hole. He slid one finger in easily, and then two with slightly more difficulty, the muscular walls of Sherlock’s vagina clinging to his fingers. He began to stretch Sherlock, coaxing him open with a scissoring motion until he could just fit three of his fingers.
Spring passed in a blur of towns and cities. It felt almost like they could keep exploring the ancient continent forever, but as they began to make plans to move on, Sherlock came to a realisation.
John reached down, sliding the plug out of Sherlock with a slick pop, leaving him wet and open. He grabbed the lube, pouring it into his hands and began to stroke his cock, enjoying the view.
“Good night, my love.” She kissed him on the forehead and turned out the light, softly closing the door behind her.
Sherlock glanced down in surprise. That was true, he wasn’t wearing anything. When he got excited, he tended to forget petty things like that. Well, that’s what he had John for, among other things.
John turned to reply to him, but his breath was stolen away as Sherlock leaned down carefully, pressing a brief, chaste kiss against John’s lips.
Magnussen had one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s waist, the other hand gripping his knee. Sherlock was seated crosswise on his lap, so that Magnussen could see past him at their ‘visitors’, once they arrived. He hadn’t told Sherlock who they were. It had something, surely, to do with the dress. Magnussen hadn’t told him anything about that, either, just instructed him to put it on. Sherlock wasn’t sure whether or not to be comforted by the fat that it clearly hadn’t been made for him- it cinched his waist too tightly and sagged loosely at the breast, and the hem rose awkwardly above the ankles.
“Unfortunately not.” Sherlock sighed. He laced their fingers together, and they didn’t speak again for the rest of the ride.
Sherlock huffed. “She was being very forward. Did you see her blouse? Two buttons undone, and straining on the buttons-”
John sighed, his breath gently ruffling Sherlock’s curls. “It’s...it’s not alright, but I understand.” He nuzzled along Sherlock’s hairline, kissing his forehead. “But you know- you don’t have to keep doing that. You’ve done so much to protect me. It’s my turn, now. Let me be the one to protect you, and keep you safe.”
Sherlock grinned and kissed him. “I’m not busy. Though I do want to have a shower first. I’ll meet you back here in an hour?”
He’d found an app, online. You spoke into the phone, and it’d tell you if your voice was masculine or feminine sounding. Sherlock hadn’t been able to stop himself from downloading it. Several times a day, he’d take it out, speaking into it, feeling a spark of relief each time the screen told him that he still sounded like a man.
In the square below, the crowds screamed as fireworks began going off. Sherlock smirked. “Happy New Year, John.”
Sherlock kissed him, number one hundred and thirty-eight. His hand crept up John’s thigh, gentle and deliberate. His fingers traced the outline of John’s cock through the loose material of his pyjamas, and watching John’s face, Sherlock could tell the exact moment John woke up properly.
Bit of an interlude today, tying up loose threads and providing a little background. Sorry it's late, my internet was being funky all of last night, it only just started working again.
Alkyl nitrites are also known as poppers, they're drugs, though they're not considered to be particularly hardcore, I don't think. Certainly not on the level of heroin or cocaine. They're meant to be inhaled, and are supposed to relax you muscles, so some use it before anal sex to make it easier.
John was dressed only in a form-hugging white shirt and boxers, and when those were gone he was left in all his naked glory, kneeling at the end of the bed with his hand around his cock. Sherlock groaned, eyes roaming over John’s muscled form. He turned the vibrator up a notch, the new intensity making him moan.
John and his family lived in London, but in the summer, they would go to the countryside to live with his grandmother in Suffolk.
John, still laughing, followed Sherlock, gently taking the coat out of his hands. “Love, you can’t go out wearing nothing but a coat.” He said, with a pointed look at Sherlock’s nude frame. He smirked slightly, remembering another time he’d tried to stop Sherlock from going out in nothing but a coat. He hadn’t succeeded then, but the situation now was quite different.
“Perfectly fine.” Sherlock breathed. “I like it better than you thinking about anyone else.” John had belonged to others for far too long. Now he was Sherlock’s, only Sherlock’s. The brief flare of possessiveness mingled with his arousal, making him gasp. He turned up the intensity of the vibrator a notch.
When finally the heavy fog of sleep lifted, Sherlock opened his eyes to find that night had fallen. In the hazy light of the streetlamps filtering through the curtains, he could make out the vague shape of John’s body in the armchair. He hauled himself up to kneel by John’s side, boldly placing a hand on his knee as he shook him awake.
“Doctor Watson, please.” Sherlock gasped. His heels were digging into John’s shoulder, hips twisting as he sought for release.
Sherlock shuddered inwardly at the implication, as Magnussen continued to talk. “I happened to overhear your little conversation with the woman you know as Mary Watson, yesterday.”
John looked like he wanted to say something, not content with letting her have the last word, but Sherlock tugged him away, hand still around John’s wrist.
Magnussen licked his way into Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock shuddered in his hold. He’d done this before, for a case, but somehow this was different, worse. It felt unbearable intimate, having someone else’s tongue in his mouth, saliva mingling with his own, sliding down his throat, being absorbed by his digestive system into his very cells. Just barely, he stopped himself from biting down.
She nodded, then smiled, brightly and falsely. “Well, everything’s settled now. Magnussen’s dead, we all got what we wanted, you don’t need me for anything, I don’t need you for anything. Go home with Sherlock, I’ll contact you about the divorce.”
It took them two months and one hundred and thirty-seven kisses to decide they’d had enough of North America. Sherlock had equally had enough of pretending that John didn’t require sexual satisfaction, and so on their first morning in Mexico City, Sherlock made his move.
Just a teensy bit longer than my usual. There was just no good place to end it. And this chapter came out really quickly, if not as perfectly or as smoothly as I might like.
John shook his head. “Not really. It’s normal, you know? What turns you on, turns you on. Like you said- if a beautiful woman got naked in front of me there are probably parts of me that would be interested-”
It even was somewhat helpful. Many nights, he was jerked out of nightmares feeling like he’d been doused in cold water. Not the most pleasant way to wake, admittedly, but John supposed it was better than staying asleep. The ghost would never let him have lie-ins, though. No matter how badly he’d slept the night before, if he tried to sleep past eight in the morning, he’d find himself woken by that same cold-water sensation.
The boys were so uncooperative with this chapter. I wanted to move on to the confrontation with Mary, but they were all 'I think we might talk about something, tonight.' Okay, fair. So I wrote them a nice little set-up, and then they clammed up. But they still wouldn't let me scrap it and just move on. This is all I managed to squeeze out of them, after three days of wrestling with the story.
John hung Sherlock’s coat back up. “Come on, let’s go have a shower. The museum’s not expecting us until noon, anyway.”
Sherlock considered, trying to imagine it as best he could, though he’d never tried it himself. Being unable to see or move, just lying there as John explored the most intimate, sensitive parts of him. It would most certainly be intense, but Sherlock had never shied away from such things. Rather the opposite, in fact.
Sherlock heard a door slam on John’s end of the phone. “Of course, yes.” John said. “All the time.” After a moment’s hesitation, he added, “Is that all right?”
After the ‘photoshoot’ Sherlock scoured the web, the newspapers, dreading the moment when the photographs of him would inevitably surface. That was the only reason he could think of for their existence- so that Magnussen could leak them, humiliating him publicly, outing him as a transgender man, forcing him to scramble to explain their existence without revealing his connection to Magnussen; just another mind game. A couple of days passed. Sherlock had seen everything that existed on the internet that even passingly mentioned his name. In all photographs of him, he was fully clothed. Sherlock felt no relief. He went back to the Google home search page, refreshing the results for his name. When that turned up nothing, he tried googling his birth name. Then he tried ‘Sherlock Holmes’ again. He was interrupted from this obsessive cycle on the third day, when he got a text.
So we learned from TEH that Sherlock becomes a giant teenager when his crush/boyfriend and his parents are in the same room. I wanted to write a bit of that. Look at him, all shy but also showing off his shiny new boyfriend at the same time.
“But that’s months off!” Mrs Holmes exclaimed. She caught sight of her husband’s face and sighed. “Yes, dear.” For a moment she looked so like Sherlock denied a cigarette that John had to stifle a laugh.
Sherlock finally relaxes, and John get his post-engagement snog. Indeed, he gets a lot more than that. It’s hours later before their exhaustion finally gets the better of them, and John collapses back against the mattress, Sherlock a sweaty, limp weight atop his chest. John runs a hand through Sherlock’s curls, trying to rouse him a little before he’s claimed by the usual post-coital nap.
So. I wanted to establish that. A base for them to stand on, in the storm that's to come. I hope it didn't seem to contrived.
“But you have.” Sherlock said earnestly. “That’s what you’ve always done, from the beginning. Since the first time you shot a man for me.”
Sherlock barely lasted a few seconds before he was shuffling back into John’s arms. “You’re a horrible man.”
When John Watson first started school, aged five, he was told to eat up all the food on his plate. This perplexed him, as his mummy had always told him to leave a little food on his plate when he was done. That night, when Mummy was tucking him into bed, he asked her about it.
The cab pulled up in front of their flat just as Sherlock’s phone rang. Sherlock picked it up, frowning. He hardly ever got calls. Anyone who knew him well enough to contact him semi-regularly knew that he hated phone calls. He trailed up the stairs after John, listening to the person on the other end.
The sales assistant looked on as John said quietly, putting the items he’d tried on the counter, “I, uh, think I’m fine, actually.  I don’t really need new swim shorts – I barely use my current ones as it is.”
He pushed the door into the room, noting it was mostly dark, but one lamp had been left on at the far end, near the sliding doors out to the balcony.  Sherlock moved quietly on the terracotta tiles, pulling his suitcase in the door behind him then softly closing it, hearing the lock click back into place.  Putting his key in his pocket and moving the suitcase to the side so it wasn’t in the way, Sherlock quietly toed off his shoes and walked lightly down the hallway in his socks.  He didn’t think John would be sleeping, but nor did he think this moment called for a grand entrance.
“Come on, John – after this morning’s performance, nothing going through your head right now can possibly be that big.”
John nodded slowly.  He had every intention of taking it slowly.  Glacial, even.  Last night’s embrace had been more than he’d dared hope for, and knowing that Sherlock was still in John’s bed, sound asleep, made John feel pretty sure they’d be ok.
With his eyes still closed and their foreheads still touching, Sherlock breathed deeply and nodded.  “Yes… that was… that was everything.”  John scanned Sherlock’s face to check… and when Sherlock opened his eyes and looked straight into John’s, John felt overwhelming relief.
“I came,” Sherlock agreed, nodding a little.  He moved further into the room, scanning John’s face, which already felt more intimate a gesture than it had this morning.  “But you knew I’d come.  You packed for me.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and his expression said that Lestrade was intolerably immature.  Lestrade found he didn’t care.  The less he was involved in this part of the conversation, the better.
John smiled into the kiss; message received.  He shifted on the bed, scooting down further and adjusting for Sherlock’s weight.  God, but he had dreamt of this.  The feel of Sherlock on top of him, his beautiful mouth, his eyes closed as he felt everything for the first time.  John lifted his hands and started to lightly run them up and down Sherlock’s back, slowly.  He felt amazed, blown away, really, that he was touching Sherlock.  That he was permitted to touch Sherlock.  He could feel Sherlock’s warm skin, the firmness of his back, the tension in his shoulders, and the narrowing of his hips.
John chuckled, aware of Sherlock’s racing thoughts.  “As long as you don’t throw my back out, I’m basically up for anything.”  John then had a panicked thought at how literally Sherlock might take this, and hastened to clarify: “Anything within reason, I mean.  I’m not into knives… or fire… or third parties…”. He wracked his brain, trying to think of more carve outs he should add. “Or… like… choking stuff.”
John smiled.  “Precisely.  So, no solo nautical adventures with roguish sea captains.  I’ll be there to put a dampener on things if you’re feeling frisky.”
Days later, Sherlock had a plan.  He needed John to know that he would respect his wishes; that Sherlock understood that continuing to contact John, to show up at John’s door, was about what Sherlock wanted;  Sherlock’s need to be close to John.  Drafts consumed Sherlock for days.  In the end, he landed on a note.  Short and sweet.  Posted rather than hand-delivered, so John would know that Sherlock hadn’t come around again.
John stopped taking Sherlock’s pulse, and started rhythmically stroking Sherlock’s wrist instead.  It was calming for both of them, he hoped.  He looked up, trying to catch Sherlock’s eye.  Sherlock took another deep breath before meeting John’s gaze.
Sherlock took control then, feeling more confident.  He pulled John’s shirt up further, not just running his hands under it, but clearly trying to get it off.  John shifted, lifting up off the bed and almost tipping them over in his haste to remove it.  They both laughed as the t-shirt sailed across the room and John righted himself, coming back down to rest under Sherlock.
“I – Look I know this must be a lot to take in.  I’ve known for a while, and the idea has had time to settle.  I knew… I mean I knew for a long time that I loved you.  Maybe I’ve always known I loved you… but in the last six months… It’s like it hit me over the head one day.  I didn’t love you like a best friend is supposed to love another… I loved you like I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.  Like I wanted us to live together, and cook together, and…”  John looked a bit embarrassed now.  “You know… *be* together.”
John nodded, even knowing Sherlock couldn’t see it.  “Me too.  How about this – if you lay on your back, I’ll come over for a cuddle.”
Sherlock’s face shifted then, as he absorbed Molly’s meaning.  He felt crushed, and almost sank to the floor with the weight of this revelation.  Realising he wasn’t coping, he put down the wooden spoon he’d been using to stir the Bolognese sauce, turned the heat under the saucepan down, and pulled out a chair from the kitchen table.  He sat, heavily, ashen-faced and wondering if he might throw up.
Sherlock considered this.  “Hmm… no. Though I will acknowledge this has been one of his more useful weekends in recent memory.”
“Do you want to play?”  Tim said suddenly, holding out the ball and directing the question at Sherlock, who looked taken aback.  His relaxed posture stiffened, and he looked at John with something approaching panic on his face.  John laughed, and said to Tim, “We’d love to!  Sure your mum won’t mind?”
“Sherlock, two things.  First, if you want to make the big romantic gesture and get to the airport before John gets on the plane, we have to leave right now to have any chance of making it.  But secondly, and I think this is more likely, if you want to just sit here and talk for a bit, you know that’s fine with me too, right?”
John smiled then, and looked around some more.  The room was now pleasantly minimalist – there was no clutter, there were neat spaces to put everything, and simple Roman blinds in the windows, with a drawstring to lower them at night.  He admired a new chest of drawers, also simple in natural wood, and then turned to open his old closet.  Inside, he was pleased to find new shelving in addition to his old hanging space.  It was meticulous – polished and clean and just waiting for his things to be hung up.  Somehow it smelt of cedar, which it never had before, though how Sherlock could have achieved that, John didn’t know.
Sherlock looked relieved, and led the way back down the hall to his own room, whose door had been closed this whole time.  He paused as he rested his hand on the door handle.  “I should say… I made some changes in here too…”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  Mycroft was bloody everywhere.  He didn’t think John would have confided in Mycroft, and yet… the Hilton was niggling at him.  How could John have afforded the Hilton?  He pushed the thought to the back of his mind, and replied.
John was hit with a pang of sadness at that, but also reflected on the nugget of truth.  Mycroft, Lestrade, and others who had made Sherlock feel that way in the past probably hadn’t intended to hurt Sherlock’s feelings (mostly), but Sherlock did make it hard sometimes.  The Palace came to mind, as did various moments where Sherlock had loudly insulted people in the vicinity with comments on their marriages, hair plugs, social climbing, and so on.  John couldn’t always blame them, but he knew that as long as he lived, he would do everything in his power never to make Sherlock feel John was embarrassed by him.
Sherlock nodded again, looking down at his shoes.  His mouth subconsciously twisted with uncertainty, and worry wracked his face.  Lestrade’s heart gave a twinge.  This was a man in pain.  He and Sherlock hadn’t always seen eye to eye in the past, but now he wanted nothing more than to comfort Sherlock.  Lestrade noted the oddity of that feeling – a new one, certainly – then moved to reassure Sherlock.
Though now Sherlock thought about it, maybe John had?  He had noticed John watching Sherlock more closely.  Maybe standing a bit closer too.  And sometimes when Sherlock looked over to catch John’s eye, he’d see a tender expression on John’s face; one that would be masked almost immediately with a friendly smile when John realised he’d been caught.
John floated on his back for a while, feeling light and happy and enjoying the sensation of being buoyed by the water.  It’d been a long time since he’d spent as relaxed a morning as this, and he was struggling to remember his last actual holiday.  Certainly he’d had leave while he’d been in the Army, but he’d mostly used that to potter around London seeing friends and, when duty called, family.
Sherlock scanned John’s face, clearly seeing he was serious.  In a startling moment of emotional intelligence, he said evenly, “Well, what if I got them for you?  It’d be my treat.  You got the hotel room, and I’d like to get this.”
“And… what’s that?” John asked as he took in the unrecognisable sofa area.  What had previously been a dark corner, piled high with books, magazines, old mugs of tea and (he thought warily) sometimes the odd experiment, now looked like a cut out from a glossy day-care brochure.  On the floor was a soft foam mat, almost puzzle-like, with interlocking coloured squares each featuring a letter or number.  On each wall, about a foot off the ground, was clear shelving about 10cm deep, with books set up as if in a children’s library.  All the covers were facing outwards, and they had intriguing titles like “Quantum Physics for Babies”, and “Awesome Science Experiments for Kids”.  As he moved closer, he inspected more of the titles; “The Big Book of Why” jumped out at him, as did “The ABCs of Space”.  They were books for a whole range of ages – some were board books, made of stiff cardboard and almost indestructible for little hands, while others were for school age children, with hardback covers and normal picture book paper.  There were probably 20 of them, all arranged neatly like a choir, slightly overlapping, and all at eye level for a toddler.
Sherlock nodded, thinking.  “Lestrade said it would probably be ok with you if we tried it out a bit… so I could see how I felt, having dinner with you and knowing that you love me.”
“I really like it – it changes the feel of the room so much!  I always thought of this as kind of a dark room, but now it feels much brighter.”
“Now look back at him!”  the girl ordered in an Italian accent, and John was startled into obeying, looking adoringly up at Sherlock before Sherlock turned side on and caught his eye.  John felt pleasantly silly, doing this.  He was far too old, really.  But something about Sherlock brimming with happiness, his eagerness to have a photo together, and knowing that they were documenting this feeling, this week, overtook him.   John beamed at Sherlock, mouthed “I love you”, then faced the camera again, thinking it was about time they wrapped this up.
“Really, Sherlock.  I mean it.  And the same is true for you – if there’s anything that I can do that would give you pleasure, I want you to tell me.  Doesn’t even need to be sexual – just, you know, anything that would be an important thing to you as part of a relationship, or our home.”
“Sherlock… I mean… I’m trying to say… I’m trying to tell you that I’m in love with you.  That I want to be with you… you know… romantically.”  Sherlock’s confused expression morphed a little.  Shifted into more of a considered look, like he was assessing this new information. John decided to plough on.  Cat’s out of the bag now, and all that.
“Yeah, no, I know you were here.  I just… ah… I just thought there were some things you should know.  Some context that you might need or want as you think this week.  And while you are, of course, able to contact me the whole time, I thought that you might not want to.  You might prefer just to have a page you can read and absorb in your own time.  I’m happy to tell you all of this to your face, of course, but I don’t want to overwhelm you.”
After a few moments, Lestrade shifted his gaze back to Sherlock.  “It’s an honour to be loved like that, Sherlock.  Not many people get that in their lifetimes.  I’m…” Lestrade gave a sigh and bit his lip before he continued, “I’m not sure I’ve ever been loved like that.  Or will ever be loved like that.”
Lestrade looked down at the paper and saw that John had indeed shared his hotel information at the bottom of the page.  Struck with curiosity, he started to scan the rest of the page, wanting to know what John had written to Sherlock that had provoked this frantic reaction.  Before he could get much beyond the first question,
“Yes… no… I mean, sort of…” John trailed off awkwardly, moving to sit down in his own chair, facing Sherlock.
John smiled at Sherlock then, genuinely, warmly, glad to be back in 221B with his best friend.  Feeling relieved he’d come today, and hadn’t turned on his heel at the top of the stairs.  John felt his face relax as he realised that they might be ok, and was pleased to see Sherlock loosen up as he watched John’s reaction – clearly he’d been worried about the reception this new set-up would get.
John studied Sherlock’s face, seeing how much he was trying.  “Sherlock, you’re here, and that’s miraculous.  Honestly – I don’t know if I can possibly express how amazing and terrifying it felt to hear the buzz of your key card on the door just now.  I didn’t expect you tonight, and after how the conversation went this morning, I was preparing myself not to see you at all.”
He let himself into a stall, undressing then pulling on the t-shirt and the buttercup yellow shorts.  He looked at himself in the mirror, quite pleased with what he saw.  It wasn’t his usual look at all, but then he didn’t feel like his usual self here in Malta.  He decided to go out and show Sherlock, and see what he thought.
Sherlock huffed a little air out, surprised and pleased by John’s words.  Feeling that John had put himself out there and bravely made the first move upstairs, Sherlock thought it was only fair that he initiate this time.  He stepped into John’s personal space, ran his left hand through John’s hair, and bent down to kiss him on the lips, bringing both hands up to cup John’s face.  John leaned up, resting his chest against Sherlock’s, and shifted gently against him.  John sighed happily as Sherlock moved to deepen the kiss, running his hands up and down Sherlock’s back now.  This was better than taking the carrier on and off – now there was nothing in his way, no hidden purpose, and he let his finders linger over Sherlock’s muscles.
Sherlock laughed at the exaggerated movements, feeling pleasantly silly even as he marvelled at how much he liked that John was demonstrative in public.  It made him feel even more loved, that John didn’t want to hide him; hide this.
Sherlock crossed the room again with quick strides and crushed John into a second hug.  This time, John didn’t hesitate to wrap his arm around Sherlock, and squeezed tightly so Sherlock knew he was serious.  He never really thought of Sherlock as a toucher – he wasn’t a physically affectionate person – and yet John knew in every part of his being that Sherlock needed this.  Deeply.
They sat in silence for a moment, both watching Sherlock’s thumb.  John breathed out deeply, actually feeling more relief now even than when Sherlock had arrived.  He really wanted to hug Sherlock, but wasn’t sure if that would be too much too fast.  He suppressed it, deciding that slower was better.
Once Sherlock was sure the girl had her brief, he scrambled backwards over the rocks to John, throwing his arm cheerfully around John’s shoulders and sporting an enormous grin.  John relaxed, tucking comfortably into Sherlock’s side, where he'd always belonged.  He looked up at Sherlock, grinning himself, and then over at the girl, who had now decided to take this worryingly seriously.  She was crouching then standing, moving around and ‘working their angles’, and John shuddered to think how many photos might be produced.
“Yes, really.  I never once doubted what you brought to our partnership, how much value you added to our cases.  I know I didn’t do a good job of showing you that, and I’m going to be different next time.  I’ll never let you doubt what you mean to me again.”
John bit his lip too, though he looked less nervous and more as though he was restraining himself.  Well, that was flattering.  Sherlock lifted the covers up lightly, and slid in, and across to join John on his side.  No need to be coy, he supposed.  John grinned and reached for Sherlock, leaning in to kiss him deeply.  Gone were the afternoon’s chaste kisses – Sherlock felt John’s tongue enter his mouth almost immediately and suddenly his feelings roared up and his nerves abated.  He melted into John, letting him lead.  This was right.  This was everything.
John opened one eye, and scrunched the other closed as he squinted up at Sherlock, whose face was mere inches from his own.  He didn’t even jump anymore, so common was this occurrence in their Baker Street lives.  “I’m awake.  Just resting.”
“Mm hm – absolutely.  I have to say, I was quite nervous about today and didn’t really eat lunch.  Tummy’s been holding out on breakfast until now.  I think those onions sizzling were the final straw.”
Those memories felt impossibly far away, now.  Before Mary, before the fall, before John was wary about caring too much.  He tried to push these thoughts out of his head, and be present for Sherlock, for whom this was clearly an important moment.
“She didn’t write anything down,” Sherlock noted with mild annoyance.  While clearly an Alessia-fan, she’d disappointed him.  He hated it when wait staff didn’t write down orders.
“Fine then, in that case, can you reach over and get my sunglasses?  I’m going to put them back on as I mosey about in here.”
“OK then, Rosie darling.  Let’s get you settled in.” And with that, John plopped Rosie into her carrier on Sherlock’s chest, pulled the straps tight, and closed the Velcro over.  He gave another double tap once that was done, to signal to Sherlock they were ready to go.
“No, I shouldn’t expect so.  I think you could tell John that this is new for you, and that you would like to see where it goes.  I think he’d understand that.  He knows you, after all.”
John was floored.  Of all the things he’d possibly expected to come out of Sherlock’s mouth, this wasn’t it.  He felt his eyebrows raise in surprise and his heart rate spike, and reminded himself that he’d been determined to provide a reassuring response to Sherlock, regardless of what it turned out to be.  He just hadn’t expected this.
John blinked, feeling this was vaguely familiar from senior school history but rather rusty on the details.  He was also a bit confused as he was pretty sure Sherlock’s story had started in the 1500s so he wasn’t sure how they were already up to the 1940s.  He stared out the window and marvelled as the cab pulled up at an enormous fountain, wide and shallow with three bronze men holding up a large bowl thing.  A smattering of tourists milled around, taking photos and drifting away from the area the cabs pulled in, towards an enormous yellow bricked wall.
Sherlock continued laughing, having hit that point of amusement when it’s very hard to stop laughing even though the moment has passed.  He did pause, momentarily, to say “John, language!” which John took with a grain of salt as Sherlock had rather a potty mouth himself when the mood struck him.
John groaned again, pushing his arse back into Sherlock’s crotch as he muttered, “Swear to god, Sherlock.  If you keep that up we won’t make it down to the pool.”
John smiled reassuringly at Sherlock.  “Mutual, then.  But I think we’ll work it out.  You wouldn’t have got on the plane otherwise.”
“So… yeah.  That’s what I wanted to tell you.  And I booked the trip to Malta so you could have a week alone to think about it.  Because I know this will be a big shock, and maybe quite an unwelcome one, and I didn’t want to be awkward around you while you take it in.”
Sherlock’s eyes continued to scan John’s face.  “Mycroft helped too, you know.  He arranged the flight on two hours’ notice, and Lestrade made me thank him and everything.” Sherlock made dramatic eyes at John, so John would understand what a sacrifice this had been on Sherlock’s part.  John chuckled, and Sherlock liked that he could feel the reverberations through John’s hand.  Much to Sherlock’s surprise, he found himself shyly running his thumb up and down over John’s knuckles.
“Excellent choice!” Sherlock said enthusiastically, and spun John around down a side street.  No Google Maps, no street signage, no previous trips here, and yet the man apparently knew exactly where he was.  John chuckled.  Trust Sherlock to acclimatise immediately to the walled city.  John hurried a bit to keep up – Sherlock had abandoned “wandering together” in favour of a “keep up, John, it’s long past adventure time” approach.  Given his singular focus, he was lucky they hadn’t marched into traffic.
“She’s on the floor!” said Sherlock with surprise, looking down at his feet as she crawled towards them.  John smiled a little as he looked from Rosie all the way up Sherlock’s long body to his face.  She did look particularly small down there when faced with Sherlock’s height.  He wondered idly if all adults looked the same to Rosie, or she could tell that Sherlock was particularly lanky.
“No, I mean – I knew he felt that way about you.  I guess I was surprised that he was telling you now, and choosing to tell you this way.  I assumed you already knew, and that you’d had that conversation before now.  And I was pretty surprised that he thought the right way to do it was drop the news in your lap and then leave immediately, but he knows you better than anyone, so I trusted him that he was making the right choice.  I did try to talk him out of it, mind, but I could see that he’d decided already.”
Sunglasses in hand, he stepped back out onto the balcony and stared around himself with delight.  Their room was on the top floor, with incredible views of the sea for 180'.  The horizon was stark before him, and John realised how pleasing it was, that dark blue line.  The sky was cloudless, and the horizon was broken only by an evenly spaced row of palm trees.  John looked down, admiring the main pool and noting that at least 50% of the deck chairs had been claimed, as early as it was.  To his right lay St Julian, the town he’d had dinner, though his view was blocked somewhat by a marina.  He breathed in the salty air happily, utterly delighted.  After a bit of snooping at what was on the neighbours’ balconies (mostly towels, some laundry, last night’s champagne and beer bottles), and judging the hotel guests who’d claimed deck chairs before going to breakfast, John settled into one of the two wicker chairs on the balcony, picking up his book but quickly abandoning it for his phone.
“Yes, I rather thought Mycroft must have known I was up to something,” John responded.  “I didn’t tell him, you know.  I didn’t think you’d like that, and I felt quite private about it myself, for obvious reasons.”
Sherlock trailed off here, and John pulled him into an embrace, feeling the need to be physically closer as he absorbed the weight of Sherlock’s emotions, and the interconnectedness for Sherlock of John’s love and Sherlock’s surprisingly traditional concepts of family.  He breathed in Sherlock’s smell, enjoying the rosemary and mint scent of the hotel’s shampoo, and the feeling of Sherlock’s linen shirt under his fingers.  It was looser than his London shirts, and John enjoyed the movement of the fabric as he rubbed his hands up and down Sherlock’s back as he held him.  He was glad for the contact, and also for the time to think without his face being scrutinised.  He knew it wasn’t fair, but some part of him was wondering how they could possibly be discussing kids when Sherlock hadn’t actually said he wanted to be in a relationship with John yet.  Or even really shared his own feelings.
“Pip-pip, then.” And with a wink and a smile, Sherlock pulled the room door open and headed out to the corridor.
Sherlock put the phone down, and went back into the kitchen to steep the tea, satisfied that Lestrade would be on his way.  As infuriating as the man could be, he was there any time Sherlock had ever really needed him.  After precisely four minutes steeping, he lifted the teabag out and whisked it into the new compost bin John was insisting they use.  Sherlock had thought it a nuisance at first – just one more thing to clean, to manage – but now he was in the swing of it and quite liked the idea.  Not that he’d tell John that.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and wiggled back off the bed, less elegantly than was characteristic for him.  He stood up and gave himself a bit of a shake.  “Fine.  I’ll get into my pyjamas and brush my teeth, but I’ll be right back.”
It went no further than that, but they rested there for long minutes, each comfortable in his own thoughts and enjoying the embrace.  With his eyes closed, Sherlock realised it was less of a choice and more of an imperative as he relaxed further and struggled to open them.
“Wait a sec!” Sherlock said cheerfully, and John waited outside the door the voice had come from.   The doors didn’t reach the floor, and John had a glimpse of Sherlock’s familiar ankles shifting as he moved about.  It felt oddly voyeuristic, though John couldn’t quite put his finger on why.  Weird to know that John would know those ankles anywhere.  Loved those ankles, even.  John snorted and rolled his eyes at himself.  Talk about sentimentality!
“Good,” Sherlock said softly, and he lightly lifted up the covers on the bed, slipping into them and leaning on his elbow to face John.
“Tim!  Time to get out!”  A tall man with freckled shoulders and foppish auburn hair eventually called out from the edge of the pool.  Tim turned, grinning up at this fellow, who was clearly his dad.  John gave a friendly wave in the father’s direction, and saw Sherlock do the same.  “Why don’t you thank these nice gentlemen for playing with you, and we’ll head up to get some lunch?”
“Oh come on, Sherlock.  He got you on a flight to a peak holiday destination in the middle of the summertime, and arranged for cars at both ends, on two hours’ notice.  That’s pretty nice.  Even you have to acknowledge that.”
“Same-same,” said Sherlock, and dropped her a wink.  John enjoyed flirty Sherlock, particularly when he was feeling quite secure as to his own position.  “You’re right either way.  It’s been a long time since I’ve been in such bright sun and I don’t have my sun cream down here. Let’s take that nice looking sofa thing in the shade.”
Sherlock gave a last, low “Fuuuuuuck” and his whole body stiffened.  John felt Sherlock’s toes press against the bed, and his chest lifted off John as suddenly John felt wetness hit his own pyjama pants.  As Sherlock came down, he collapsed on top of John and John gasped as the friction returned.  Reaching his hand down, he gave himself a few quick strokes and bit into Sherlock’s shoulder as he came himself in a flood.  Over the next few minutes, their breathing slowly returned to normal, and Sherlock remained collapsed on John.
By the time John reached the landing, Sherlock was well ahead of him, having leapt up the stairs two at a time despite Rosie’s additional weight.  He was standing in the centre of the bedroom with his arms outspread when John came in.  He wore a beatific expression, and clearly wanted John to be as delighted as Sherlock himself was.
“Nah, she’ll be right.  She’ll be pleased I’m not asking her to get in.  She doesn’t like to get wet.”
“So... what do you know?  When I texted you, I didn’t expect that you would know anything, but the nature of your texts suggest that John let you know what he was going to do.”
Back inside the flat, Sherlock is staring at the closed door, John’s crushed silhouette as he pulled it closed behind him imprinted on his mind’s eye.  Sherlock doesn’t always read others’ emotions well, but he can read John.  And John isn’t ok.  John is devastated.
John’s head fell back to rest on Sherlock’s collarbone.  “Sherlock, I swear I’ll do anything you want right now as long as you keep touching me.”
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully.  “Yes, I can see that. In retrospect, it’s not that John was particularly subtle, it’s more that… you know, nothing had changed.  I knew he loved me – he’d never said it, but I knew.  But that was different.  Because I knew I loved him too, and we’d always been this way.”  Sherlock gestured around the room, and Lestrade nodded understandingly.
“Sherlock, please don’t worry.  There isn’t a right or wrong answer here.  I’m sure John doesn’t mean this as a test.  I just think he couldn’t not tell you any longer.”
“John let me know that he was going to talk to you, and that he intended to leave immediately for a holiday to give you time to think about it.  He asked me when my days off were, and we agreed that I would be available on the day he did it, so you would have someone to talk to if you wanted to. So ... I wasn’t terribly surprised to get your text.”
Sherlock looked confused and put down the towel he’d been stroking, following John away from the counter.  John kept his voice low and angled his body away from the assistant’s curious gaze.
“Oh, that wasn’t really a deduction.  Just felt more likely that you’d been to Lisbon than Malta – maybe a university trip with friends, or a group trip while at Bart’s.  Malta tends to be more popular with the over 40s crowd, which hasn’t been you until rather recently.”
Sherlock scrunched up his nose and looked displeased.  “John, this is our flat.  It will always be our flat.  Me knowing Mrs Hudson first doesn’t make it any more my flat than yours.  You know that.”  John breathed a sigh of relief.  This, at least, was good news.  The idea of moving out, not seeing Sherlock every day, having to start afresh after his declaration, felt a bit much.  Even if he had to suppress every feeling, restrain every gesture, and go to bed alone and broken-hearted each night, it was still better than the alternative.
“No, Sherlock – it isn’t that at all.  It looks great.  Amazing, in fact.  I can’t believe how different it is!  I’m just… struggling… I guess.  I didn’t know you had an interest in this stuff, and yet you clearly thought a lot about this.”
John shot a quick glare at Sherlock and chose the chair, plonking himself down just as Sherlock had done.  He sat back, delighted with this.  So deep and comfortable!  The table did seem rather far away and too low to be of much use, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.  What bliss!
Sherlock considered this for a few moments, biting the inside of his cheek.  Eventually, he ventured, “I don’t mind telling you, but I’m aware that there are certain social rules about these topics that I’d be breaching if I did.”
Sherlock nodded, smiling a little as he acknowledged the comment.  The room was brighter – he’d also changed the curtains and pulled them wide for maximum sunshine to enter.  Instead of feeling betrayed by the sun spilling through the windows on his darkest days, he’d found he was able to wallow perfectly well, and see things more clearly.
“Um… Sherlock?” John said, lowering his voice and feeling rather tense. “Mind if I have a quick word?”
John raised his eyebrows, interested by this idea and thinking through the practical implications.  “I’d tell you what I’m thinking even if I think it’d freak you out?”
They were laying on the rocks around the bay from the hotel.  They’d seen some of the younger couples among the hotel’s guests heading out this way and decided to follow them, delighted to find such a beautiful place to spread out.  It wasn’t terribly comfortable, but after a week of lounge chairs and pools, Sherlock was actually pleased to be on the hard surface by the sea, towel stretched out languidly beneath him, the rock rough against his fingertips.  He took a deep breath in with his eyes closed, revelling in the salty air and strong sunshine.  As sorry as he was to be heading back tomorrow, he felt that they’d really made the most of the week.
They walked companionably down the hall in silence, back to the kitchen.  Though it wasn’t really necessary yet, Sherlock leant to his left to flick on the overhead light, which shot a warm glow over the room.  John turned to him, drinking him in once more and said with lifted brows, “Now, where were we?”
John snorted a little at that, as heartfelt as Sherlock’s little speech had been.  “Still not gay”, he thought to himself, with a mental eye roll.
Sherlock slowed down and turned back to John.  “Are you seriously telling me that you just noticed?”  His brow was furrowed, and he looked quite concerned.  They’d been in the city for well over an hour.
Once seated, facing each other, Sherlock looked thoughtfully at John for a moment, before starting.  “I was thinking… If we do this… you know… permanently… I think I’d like to raise children with you.”
After an invigorating shower in which John used every one of the fancy toiletries the hotel had on offer, he whipped open the door to let the cloud of steam out.  He was fragrant – clean hair, clean skin, newly moisturised.  Not a thing John usually did, but then staying in fancy hotels was not a thing John usually did either.  He chuckled to himself as he thought he should take a holiday more often.
It was a brief, sweet kiss, and John pulled back a little so he could rest his forehead against Sherlock’s.
“You’re welcome, Sherlock.  And let me just say this, before we go to sleep.  I will show you, and tell you, that I love you every single day for as long as you’ll have me.   I never, ever, want you to wonder where you stand with me.  I want you to know that you are the person I love most in this world, and go to sleep every night knowing that I’ll be right there next to you when you wake up in the morning.  Or… you know… I’ll be around somewhere, given you’re not a big sleeper.”
Sherlock grimaced.  Weird to have Lestrade on his bed when John had never even taken that liberty.  Sherlock gave a shudder of surprise as that thought crossed his mind.  How comfortable he would be with John being on the bed.  How uncomfortable he is that Lestrade is.  Putting that thought aside, he pulled the chair right up beside the wardrobe, turning it around so the back was right up against the wood and he could easily step on and up.  Grasping the suitcase now at its top and bottom, he swivelled on the chair.
John leaned further forward, taking one of Sherlock’s hands in his and resting the other against the side of Sherlock’s face, framing those incredible cheekbones and pushing Sherlock’s hair back lightly.  He turned his head to the side a little, aiming for an easy angle, and pressed his lips softly to Sherlock’s, breathing him in as he did so.
Sherlock nodded and looked at his hands, now folded neatly in his lap.  “I… I don’t think I’ve ever been loved like this before.  Even… even my parents, and Mycroft.  I know they love me, even when Mycroft is being a right arse, but this feels different.  Like John chose me.  No one has ever chosen me before.”
“I want this.  You.  Us.  I want us to make dinner together every night.  I want to learn what turns you on.  I want you to fall asleep in my arms, in my bed.  I want to work with you, solve puzzles with you, and fall into step with you as we run.  I want Rosie to grow up at Baker Street, and I’ll pack her lovely lunches, and we’ll go on adventures to see my parents.  She’ll know that we love her.  She’ll probably know a worrying amount about soil and dead bodies and whether people are lying to her.  And eventually she’ll head off to university, and you and I will grow old together.”  Sherlock sighed, and closed his eyes.  “That’s what I want most in the world.”
Sherlock crossed one leg over the other and tried to hide the evidence of how John’s answer affected him.  Not that it was terribly risqué, but the implications were… enticing.  He looked up at Lestrade, and was unsurprised to see that Lestrade was deliberately looking away from Sherlock.  The rustle of Sherlock’s trousers probably told Lestrade all he needed to know, anyway.  Loath as Sherlock was to admit it, Lestrade was no idiot.
Lestrade took a breath before starting, wanting to be honest with Sherlock but not freak him out.  It was a fine line.  “Because I’ve seen you two together, Sherlock.  I’ve known you both for years.  I see the way he looks at you.  And often, you know, the way that you look at him.  It’s there for anyone to see – you’re connected, deeply.  I can almost see a physical tether between you – you know exactly where the other one is at all times, you’re in each other’s space, and then you spring apart, but never too far.  You communicate with a series of meaningful looks and eyebrow movements.  You drive each other mad, but only because you deeply understand each other.  And I don’t think John has many people in his life who really get him.  I try, obviously, and there are others who think he’s great, but he doesn’t let people in.  But he let you in.  More than even he realised, I suspect.”
