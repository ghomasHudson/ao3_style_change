“He’s terrific, folks!” called John, fingers simply dancing along the familiar keys beneath him. Sherlock flushed and pushed forward with confidence:
He knew he only had three measures to begin singing and he was wholly unaware of why he was here at all. He wasn’t a singer. Sure, he sang and he understood it all, but a singer? They would laugh at him.
Still, the pros were compelling.
Self-hatred.
- did grant himself permission to try?
“And you don’t mind me, either,” John said, more passion in his voice.
“I- sure?” Philip said, startled by the drastic change in his demeanour.
“Why does John’s imminent marriage bother you?”
This short letter was proof that one of the other letters bore the first time John confessed his love. He knew John and knew beyond doubt that he wouldn’t have confessed such a thing for the first time in a manner so cavalier. No. John- his John- would have confessed it in a letter dedicated solely to the subject.

Because Tobias is a salty bitch.

“Ah,” Sherlock drawled, bringing his glass to his lips for one small sip. “As always, context clarifies.” When John gave him a quizzical look, he waved away John’s unspoken questions. “Doesn’t matter. I’m a detective... of sorts.”
“Don’t be.”
One particularly lovely spring day, the two escaped responsibilities together in favour of the refuge provided by a serene pond. It was picture perfect with snow-white lilies blooming around the water, beautiful petals floating across the shallow water that reflected the brilliant shade of blue provided by the sky above them. The air was moving everything slightly to the left, carrying a light aroma of fresh lavender from somewhere nearby. Yet despite the almost unbelievable beauty of it all, Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off of Victor.
“Of course it-”
Minutes and minutes later, when John gathered his courage enough to look back up at his model, his eyes were back to their previous focus point and John releases a tension he hadn’t known he was holding. He didn’t know why the man had turned to stare at him in such a manner, but he knew the simple contact had been the most exciting thing to happen to him all day- even all year.
“Good, now go!”
Those days left John with an emptiness he felt pathetic for experiencing. It was as though this game- and this game alone- was the reason for him to wake up in the morning. When he needed to rationalize it, he reminded himself that the game offered him mystery and something to look forward to. It was more than he could say about any other aspect of his life.
Sherlock shot up, reaching his feet with impossibly rapid movement. He stared at the scene before him, his mind playing out a nightmare. Eyebrows furrowed together, mouth dry, his breathing shallowed until he was barely taking in any air at all.
Of this John Watson, he could deduce many things. He could read his brother’s alcoholism in his phone, his military experience in his posture, and his insomnia in the dark bags lying beneath his eyes. But the most important thing that he could read on John Watson was the manner in which he regarded his words carefully, the way they seemed to be ripped from his against his will.
But Sherlock’s eyes widened with surprise, a joyous glint flickering within them. “Classical music,” he repeated and it wasn't a question. “Which sort?”
“I liberated Dachau.”
Two minutes.
Hastily, he flipped on the radio with the eagerness of a starving cat reaching for scraps of food. A smooth, low voice of an announcer filled the tiny flat and the background noise supplied him with the motivation to move once more. He escaped the drab kitchen to rummage in his closet, the radio growing soft from distance but remaining audible as he pulled a button up over gaunt, lifeless skin.
Sherlock laughed at his feet, the sound light and melodious in John’s ears. “Right then. See you around.”

Mycroft: *leans back in his chair and puts his feet up on his desk and waits for his brother to regain consciousness for Maximum Drama™*
John rolled his eyes but otherwise let the comments go. “Sherlock, that was amazing.”
It was silent for an eternity. There existed only Sherlock, still as the dead, and John, cheeks wet with his silent tears and frozen only by the weight of the truth that finally lay between them both.
“There’s more,” he whispered and Sherlock was certain he wouldn’t be capable of movement until he heard the rest. “I have a deduction.”
As always, thank you for reading. I appreciate you all. <3
He had demanded that Sherlock put the star on that evening, insisting it was an important rite of passage. He had fallen into the job next year and the next, and now seven Christmases had passed with Sherlock placing the star on top with John beaming to his right.
“Of course they’re cute,” muttered John, embarrassed to say it any louder. “Look at them. They’re adorable.”
The paper bore patterns where ink was subtly warped from the liquid of tears. Though there were certainly a fair amount when Sherlock began the letter, there were a few extra fresh ones by the time he finished. Try as he might, the tears flowed from his eyes liberally. He hated the tarnished effect they had on the letter, though they fell outside of his ability to prevent them.
“Just realizing that now?”
“You’ve been back for how long now?” she asked, head tilting.
Sherlock clearly liked this.
sorry for what I did to you in that mortuary. I am sorry for doubting you, for isolating you, for treating you like you’re anything less than the most important person on this Goddamn planet. Mostly, Sherlock, I am sorry for leaving you that night when you begged me to stay. I’m sorry for hurting you, choosing imagined safety over you. I’m sorry for leading you on, sorry you had to go to the wedding after the fact. I’m sorry I was too much of a coward to admit to everyone else what I’ve always known: you, and you alone, are the only thing I’ve ever truly loved in my whole life.”
It's the night of the band's first performance at The Cresent. Despite the thrill of playing for a crowd after years, the hour-long set will only be the second best part of John's evening.
This was it: their first show. Their first real attempt to see if they had what it took to win this contest. This was all on John.
If anybody in the world shared his unique experience, it was this man. He had never once thought it would be possible, but lightning does- sometimes, somehow, miraculously- strike twice.
“I- Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. I would lo- like that.”
“I do,” John answered with a hesitant voice, his eyes remaining glued on the sight before him. “But what's with-” he gestured lamely around him, his voice trailing off.
“How do you clean up any other mess?”
It was so close to dying, his mind on a third level high. He lived for this, yearned for it to consume his every moment. The world was spinning in pointless circles until Sherlock could experience this next. He didn't always need this level of disconnect, but he did always crave it.
This was the darkest room of the wing, a room he fled to when his heart was so miserable with the weight of love that it threatened to drag him down to his depths, to drown him.
“John,” Sherlock projected hesitantly into the soft quiet between them.
He ran from the idea, acting like a child who believed he could run from anything.
Instantly drawn from his doctor mindset with sheer confusion, John asked “You don't like it? Why are you here?”
John responded with a noncommittal grunt, thoughtful of the different sort of hell this man saw. John’s story against Wiggins’ would likely sound like products of two vastly different wars rather than stories originating from the same fight.
Before him, Sherlock was standing tall, determined, radiating a tense professionalism that John didn’t understand how to react to. He was certain this couldn’t be happening, certain this was a terrible, terrible nightmare borne of his nodding off on that old chair.
What! We're halfway done already?!
“Thank you,” Sherlock whispered, still so close to John yet so far from where he should be. “I love them.”
As the contest crept closer and they had only two more sessions to achieve perfection, Sholto was particularly on edge. His personal distemperment tipped Tobias past the edge of his always precautious temper who then took it out on Greg. The result was a nearly unbearable bout of bickering between the two. It was a domino effect across the band and John was certain he would descend into madness if it continued even one minute longer.
“No, stop,” said John loudly over Sherlock’s dismissal. Sherlock fell silent, mortified. “It’s my fault.”
The boy smiled wide enough to strain his cheeks, shaking his head slightly. “That’s really impressive,” he said simply.
“It’s because they’re
Understanding bloomed deep within the darkness of John’s eyes. “Do you leave disgusting experiments in our fridge?”
And he knew, frozen in that spot, that he needed to answer John one way or the other. Whether or not he joined them was entwined with whether or not he enjoyed himself and John’s eyes were too inquisitive, too loaded. Yet-
“What season is it?”
“This is destiny, John. Consider all we’ve been through, all we have suffered to wind up here: finally, happily, miraculously together. What we share can never be reversed, what we’ve been through cannot be rewound. We are tied together as one, locked in love and fate, we are bound together. Whatever fate the heavens are weaving- which I have never believed in before I met you- I refuse to play any part in breaking it.
Then, so slowly John couldn't be certain it was happening, Sherlock's cheek fell slowly upon his head. The hair on his neck stood on end and there was no questioning whether Sherlock would notice the impact.
Yet he knew it was an emotional pain he was experiencing. An emotional pain so severe, his body was reacting to it in an effort to release a bit of the tension building up within his mind. His heart was pumping quickly, feeling too heavy but breaking apart more and more with every beat. His limbs were no longer his own; rather, they were limp, surreal attachments that served no purpose other than to weigh him down enough for any movement to be impossible.
“Yeah, well, I’m not,” John whispered, embarrassment rushing hot inside him.
as a flatmate?”
“Always,” he returned with his closest impression of a sultry tone.
John. John Watson. Real. Here. Holding him. The fire, innocent and warm.
Tomorrow's prompt: Season's Greetings
“And what day does the train leave for London?” John asked, his smile surely permanent upon his face now.
Italics in this chapter indicate (besides emphasis): one, Sherlock's deductions/inner thoughts and two, words that are sung versus spoken.
“The game is on, Sherlock,” he responded mischievously. “Let’s see if you can deduce which pair is from me.”
He counted them, an unnecessary act since he’d already known how many there were before the knight’s disappearance. Still, he counted: two pawns, two rooks, one knight, one bishop, and his kind and queen still intact. Alternatively, his opponent still had three pawns, both knights and rooks, one bishop, and their queen and king.
He shrugged off the thoughts and walked out of the backstage area, approaching the bartender, his heart rate elevating with every further step. When he stepped up to the beaten, discoloured wood, he called his order (double whiskey, neat) to the bartender and, spotting his missing bandmates several tables away, called in a honied voice, “Oi, you two come here often?”
“You said ‘if only he knew.’” Sherlock was staring at him curiously and John was burning under the intensity of those eyes.
Sherlock’s tears were falling unabashedly now. Without care or precaution, the tears fell heavily down his cheeks, the waves of water tracing down his face in peculiar designs. Some were racing to the floor to fall in puddles that were water paintings of his pain. Others fell down his cheek so slowly, they were nearly immobile- each slight motion down his face an alarm to notify him of his sorrow as it crept along the height of his cheekbone and then dipped into the valley of his cheeks.
John considered the proposition.
. The other song is called "Right This Way" and I could never,
In the dim light of backstage, the band was messing around with such childish abandon that it warmed the corners of his heart to observe. Oh, what different men stood before him now than had stood before him that first night they had played together.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side, his eyes narrowing. “You don’t believe any of them could be gay or prisoners or war?”
I used this style because one POV in my original novel has this sarcastic, intimate narration and I needed to practice before I start rewrites in January.
It was an uncomfortable silence, standing there stewing his rejection. It hurt more than he could have thought. It seemed a pattern, this underestimation of emotional pain. He stood in near stillness as the detective walked around the kitchen to prepare tea that John did not sincerely desire.
Beware
Mycroft, who possessed neither the time for Sherlock’s presumed lunacy nor an understanding of the breadth of his brother’s affliction, answered: “You’re born for it. The instinct to lie is as deeply ground in myself as it is, and always will be, in you.”
realize how handsome he was. He was the picture of beauty with soft waving locks, enormous sparkling eyes that were always wide with inquisitive curiosity, and his impossibly long legs were accented pleasently by his smart fashion and high-waisted tousers.
Who can explain it? Who can say when it started? Perhaps that very first day. Perhaps it was one year later when Victor socked a boy in the face for telling Sherlock to jump off a cliff. Perhaps it started when Victor grew into his clothes and it became apparent that he was more handsome than Sherlock had ever seen. Or perhaps it started so slowly, there was no start at all. Perhaps it crept along so slowly, Sherlock was destined to look upon Victor’s beautifully angular face with a gut-wrenching pain and think “Oh. It’s you.”
!” he shouted as loudly as he could manage, his hand crushing the telegram in his hands. The telegram, the unlikely cause of his shattered heart and crumbling world, shook in his clenched hand. He wanted to turn the newly formed fist against his brother, but his body collapsed beneath him, no longer in possession of the strength it took to live.
want to go talk to the man. And Sherlock’s request for him to do so gave him an excellent excuse to go do so. He could pretend to find the ordeal dreadful while revelling in just a bit of self-indulgence.
Now John’s face was contorted in confusion because, of course, this John had no idea what he was talking about. He would not become Sherlock’s blogger until after the conclusion of what he- annoyingly- called “A Study in Pink.”
“Don’t tell… you know. Don’t tell John, please? Don’t tell anybody?”
The small shop was ordained with bookshelves brimming with a variety of fiction and nonfiction essays, novels, and picture books. Along one shelf, dozens of board games were lined up in worn boxes. Only seven tables were available for customers with only three of them occupied. The two employees moving in fluid, dance-like cadence behind the counter were wearing matching black aprons.
Sherlock pushed forward, hoping to change the direction of John’s mood. “I don’t mean you’re-” but his throat burned with the almost truth. He twisted his face from the fire in his throat and altered his tactic. “I mean to say… has your moderate intelligence allowed you to-” a deep breath to steady his nerves- “nothing anything peculiar about me?”
They broke out in a rhythm of song, mostly perfect in their execution with his experienced ears perking up at the slightest mistake. He took a seat in an uncomfortable, wooden chair and watched from the side as the lot of them practised, only the occasional glance of curiosity wound with animosity directed toward him from Philip or Tobias.
He trailed off weakly and Sherlock appeared so thoroughly caught off guard, he was blinking at twice the normal rate. His brow was furrowed, his eyes moving rapidly over John to scan every inch of him.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed, a ghost of a grin dancing across his lips. John knew he was imagining the scene, grateful for this almost-memory.
Taking a drink of his now-cold tea, he hoped the flush of colour in his cheeks was hidden from the dim light. The brain and the heart. Always bound to find one another, sharing a bond in any potential reality.
John’s smile faltered in response but didn’t disappear. Rather, his head shook in confusion and his eyebrows stitched together, asking, “Wh-Sorry?”
This seemed to appease her a bit, her arms falling gently to her side as she walked away from him, back from wherever she was staked out to watch and judge him.
The gorgeous man stayed silent as he finished straightening the board. When he finished, he stood up, brushed his hands together, and met his eyes to John’s once again. “No, you cannot. But I can help you. The name’s Sherlock Holmes.”
Eyes closed, he focused on the taste of him- the taste of Sherlock Holmes. What a wonderful taste it was, too.
It was mounting in John, his walk turning into a skip, his glee keeping him buoyant, unable to prevent a true giggle when he caught Greg’s eyes and saw a blissful disbelief that matched his own.
“It was holly!” roared John with complete and utter bewilderment at just how stupid Sherlock thought he was. “Even
A lie could be anything. The truth can exist in only one form.
Somehow, by some miracle, John’s eyes found Sherlock’s again. His eyes were brimming with apparent tears, his hands shaking in Sherlock’s.
“What happened before- the war, the fighting, the starvation, the loss? Getting through it required brotherhood. At the end of the day, we didn’t fight to win the war, we fought to protect each other. Well, we’re in a different sort of fight now. We’re in it together. This band is founded on devoted brotherhood. Frankly, if you are willing to win this contest at the price of crawling over your fellow brothers, then you’re here for no reason at all and you can leave right now.”
feeling?” asked John.
to see-”
He turned on his heels, a fluid rotation accentuated by the twirling of his jacket and John allowed him two-three-four steps away from him before he was shouting after him without consciously making the decision to do so.
John appeared somewhat surprised by his response, but he shrugged it off and, feet tapping to an unheard rhythm. Sherlock continued, “So… in light of...
this man?
, he thought, watching their performance from his seat in the back of the club.
When his body finally went limp under John, his hands released their hold and John gingerly removed himself from the still-erect cock. He swallowed the massive load, enjoying the feeling it was it went slowly down his throat.
“John?” said Sherlock in a defeated whisper, not daring to get his hopes up.
The room at the very end of this corridor was the reason he came. He itched for the final room, yearned for it, craved it. Yet he caught sight of the second door on his left and his feet faltered in their assured motion. The moment he saw the door, he knew he was helpless to avoid the pull of temptation it posed.
, George. I’ve been in love.”
So he tore his eyes off of the handsome, sturdy man and intently returned his gaze to the pinpoint he’d chosen to stare at during the hour. Just fourteen minutes left. Just fourteen minutes until he could confront the murderer.
John.
“Fine,” he muttered and leaned closer so he could whisper the words under cover of blaring jazz. “My brother does not have mere influence over the government. He essentially is the government. He is the power of the state and the church rolled into one massive pain in the ass.”
“The best.” He released the words reluctantly and rolled his eyes, a strangely out-of-place sentiment for a man who’d talked about the liberation of Dachau without a care.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait! Sherlock!”
His brother was absolutely insufferable since he’d abandoned his caution of emotion. This day- this absolutely dreadful day- was only making him more intolerable.
“Then what, pray tell, is your area?” John flirted, and he was certain it was too far. He couldn’t make himself step back from the ledge he was so near to leaping from.
-Grounds for Thought Staff
“We’re here to tell you about your next steps,” said Nicholas, clearly bored. His hair was wispy, his skin nearly translucent in the horrible lighting offered by the room. “This is a paper that outlines the date and time of your expected arrival.” Philip, who was both nearest to them and passionate about reading fine print, grabbed the paper and began to immediately ignore the men before them.
“Your insomnia,” Sherlock said slowly, leaning forward to rest his chin on his propped up arm. “It’s related, isn’t it? To Victor, that is?”
Did you know England doesn't use the term "mall"? Neither did I until I wrote this chapter. Also, it's only "cozy" in America, but "cosy" everywhere else. The more you know! I'll keep the chapter title the same as the American spelling since it's the prompt name, but it's properly spelt in the fic.
Al’s face fell alarmingly fast, John’s words seeming an act of cruelty as a frown formed underneath those kind eyes. “Ah,” he said simply, his eyes moving rapidly from John to the current player and back to John. “Tell you what, kid. A friend of mine needs an accordion player for their wedding next month. You still do that?”
Sherlock was no longer looking at him, but down at his own knees. Though his face was unreadable, it seemed to lose a bit of its edge and John’s chest eased the slightest amount.
One more! But we're out of band members! Who will it be the featured POV for our last day? You're all bright, I'm sure you have a hunch.
It was not unheard of for Sherlock to enter moods from which he could not escape. In these times, he felt incapable of grasping a lifeline. He fell and fell and there was no chance of surviving the fall into consuming sorrow.
The world was a plane of fog, a painting of balsams, surrounding him with green thickets. Each bristle was ringing with clarity, millions of points of interest and his mind couldn’t handle the ferocity with which it was trying to register the information.
John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were not two birds of a feather. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were two sides of the same coin; the unity in a whole of two opposites.
Sherlock blinked, the question taking more than a second to process. He held up one finger and took a great gulp of his beverage, the small umbrella sinking lower into the glass. It was impossible, he knew, but the impact of it
In way of an answer, Philip’s feet shuffled uncomfortably beneath him, his eyes looking everywhere but John. He didn’t leave, didn’t continue, but stood there, teeth working on his lower lip.
“I am.”
The portion of him that was always so close to the edge took over, his mouth thrashing before his mind could prevent it. “Yeah, well some of us had a little service to take care of- a little war to fight. Maybe you heard something about it in the papers?”
He heaved a sigh, clicking shut his case. “He’s a bass player. He was in the Army with me and he’s a better bassist than anybody when he’s not drunk- or high.”
And he isn't empty-handed.
So he’d never spoken of his loneliness again. His 19-year-old big brother had to know something Sherlock didn’t.
close eye on him as he made his way through the Solomon Islands. Close enough to be present as they brought in his body fourteen minutes ago.
“Sir, are you ready to order yet?”
“And how, pray tell,” Sherlock urged, “did he convince you to get onboard?”
Without another word, he swept his violin off his chair and into his hands. He started to play the first Christmas tune that came to his mind, praying John could not deduce the love and longing painted all over his face.
Sherlock reads the last letter he'll ever receive from Victor.
“Let’s hope so,” Sherlock responded, his gaze torn suddenly by a motion to his left. John turned to see Mary waltzing away, toward the door. “Because our suspect is leaving and it’s a case that requires two minds.”
Sherlock was close- John knew it. His twitching beneath him was uncontrolled and wild, begging for sweet release. John would grant him release.
John put incredible effort into controlling his anger, working the muscles in his body to relax, and tell himself that Sherlock’s reaction had no impact on the need for the words in John’s mind to escape. He needed to continue his confessions even if they were not met with eager ears.
“Alright, and who was it this time?”
John smiled a genuine, wild smile. His first in quite some time. The motion was foreign to him- like the expression wasn’t really even his own.
“Oh.”
“And why should I do it, then?” Tobias challenged John, arms crossed over his chest.
“She’s… showing off?” ventured John, trying desperately to imitate the train of thought that Sherlock’s mind climbed aboard to make these deduction. “She’s dressed up, in a group of only women?”
Sighing, Sherlock imagined John before him, all 5’7” of shining eyes and strong stature. “He’s so handsome. His big eyes that I want to swim in and his powerful but cute hands and... I can’t wait to be home. Our home.”
Hand on the doorknob and panting with the effort of his wanderings, he swung open the door to see a half-dozen heads turn to watch his entrance. Among them was Professor Hudson who rose an eyebrow but silently gestured him inside, continuing her sentence.
“Well, you chose science over love- yeah? But isn’t it
-the most comments
“But then,” he said, eyebrows furrowing together as the words came out slowly, “why didn’t he stop Victor from entering?”
John took a moment to take a long drink of his martini. He felt the liquid burn in his throat and settle as a ball of warmth in his stomach. When he returned his glass to the table, he fixed Sherlock with an investigative gaze and asked, “Alright. Impress me. What else do you
“No, no, I’m sorry,” Sherlock rushed to say. His face was hot with embarrassment, his words failing to leave him fast enough. “I don’t know why I’m here, I didn’t mean to offset your practice-”
Me: wait for it...
John’s eyes flinted to Philip, their number one flight risk. “Whatever gigs we can get, we’ll take. If there’s a place in town where we can play a set, we’re going to do it. No exceptions. We book every opportunity starting now. We have 97 days until the final round. We take them all, place all the funds in a savings and earn our way to London. We book a train, we book a hotel, and we perform. All with the savings we’ll get from 97 days of hard work.”
At first, there was no visible change in his expression and every hope he’d built up began a rapid descent.
The words were so sudden, his mind raked for exactly the last words the two had exchanged. He never knew where Holmes went in his mind when he dozed away from reality, but he suspected he knew this time.
I didn't actually use the words "comfort and joy," but I rather think I captured the essence of the phrase, don't you?
here?” Philip asked with a directed nod toward Sherlock.
From the first moment, John Watson had known this man was going to be something special. After that perfect evening, their lovely conversation, and this one deceptively significant touch, John knew his life had casually changed course permanently. He knew with crystal clear certainty that this was the first date of many.
He’d been asleep long enough for the effect of his nightcap to wear off. Now, horrifically sober, his insides were pleading for the satisfaction of his craving. The desire for it was a flame that put every nerve of his on edge. Everything was too sharp around him, reality pulverising him with its intensity. The drink relieved every pain inside him as it rushed down his throat.
An hour is an incredibly short time when you’re doing the thing you were born to do. It positively flew by, the time flowing at the exact tempo set by their band.  When they concluded their final song, the individuals who had taken up dancing on the huge marble floor before the stage stopped with panting breath and clapped enthusiastically.
A bit of warning that tomorrow's may be late since I work from 9 am until 9 pm. I apologize ahead of time and I will try to get it posted in a timely fashion.
It was a dingy bar, the air thick with poor ventilation. Each table bore signs of abuse. Two tables were missing rather large chunks of wood, one table was criminally crooked and John was convinced drinks would simply slide off it, while another table-a booth table- was so littered with dried, sticky rings, he would have been surprised if the table had been cleaned even once in its long life.
John’s first day in his new civilian job coincided with the winter’s first frost. The cold bit at his neck and the tips of his fingers, but the break room where he was expected to enjoy his lunch was suffocating with its drab, medical environment. He’d grumbled something about needing fresh air and sought refuge in a quaint shop lit up with delicate, blinking Christmas lights.
There are some things so ingrained in the minds of a society that they create links where there is no conscious train of thought to connect them. Colour is just one example. In Western Culture, the colour of darkness is evil.
Tobias stared at John for nine long seconds, his mouth working in minute motions to betray his processing mind. He looked briefly toward the other two men, who were staring at the floor but nodded their heads in agreeance with John’s words. “I can’t do it Tuesdays,” he said, speech thick with reluctance.
The winter wind whipped a long pea coat around his legs, standing far from John- and not just physically. His answers had been short, his patience thin, his demeanour unkind.
“How did it happen?” he interrupted, words trembling with his silent torment.
“Mmhm,” said Sherlock again, his smile remained glued on his face at the thought. “He’ll be home and I’ll be tipsy and he’ll take care of me.”
He imagined he could see the flashes of confusion, defiance, and reluctant agreement behind John’s unmoving gaze. This is the way it would always be with him, he knew in the warmest corner of his soul. There would be John, existing in pained silence and there would be Sherlock, noticing every invisible change in John that no one else could.
Excusing himself to ask for pen and paper from the bar, John wrote down the location of their rehearsals and the different days that he could drop by. Hesitating, he refrained from only giving him the date of the soonest practice. It was fairer, he knew, to give him options.
It had, of course, been lovely. But what he’d thought was a simple uncontrollable urge to lie brought him to the larger bedroom in the house, hands wringing in on themselves as he asked his elder brother, ten years old at the time, “Why do the words from my mouth sound different from the thoughts in my head?”
“My dear Watson,” he said again, slowly and with a rare tenderness in his voice. “The brain will always need its heart, the heart will always need its brain, and the two cannot exist without the other.”
John pushed thoughts of the band to the very back room of his mind. What he needed to do now would require every last ounce of strength he possessed. It was no time to have any semblance of split focus.
He reached an excited hand to the door handle and began to turn it.
” he watched himself ask John hesitantly.
“My whole life.”
“Cof- No!” John shouted incredulously, though he wanted nothing more than to accept the offer. “I have class.”
“Of cour- Sherlock,” John sighs angrily. “We’ve been over this-”
“I was thinking about Victor. I was re-reading the letter he- the one you gave me. I was thinking about how my experience isn’t remotely near a rare one,” Sherlock said in a blur of words, shoving the pages onto the piano and fluttering his hands about. John stared at him, trying to keep up. “But that’s the thing: it doesn’t matter if it’s common. It’s still hard. It’s hard to let go because it feels like a betrayal to him but it’s simply an impossible task to keep holding on. Especially against his explicit request.”
changes to canon. We're world building from John's POV here.
“Your socks,” John repeated, attempting not to get lost in those beautifully complex eyes. “I like them.”
He said it with a nonchalant finality, as though he’d simply relayed the score of a game John had missed the night before. John’s stomach dropped into a tight ball deep within him, his smirk instantly fading to give way to regret. He shouldn’t have challenged him. Greg remained unconcerned but John swore he saw the slightest tightening of his lips before he brought the glass to his lips.
So he suffered- silently. He hated himself, hated the situation he was in, hated his choices and he took it out on Sherlock Holmes.
One minute.
It was his turn now, John handing him the box addressed to “Mycroft” while the both of them were-poorly- suppressing bouts of laughter. Their faces were red, their lips trembling as they continued to look at one another in delight.
Never, in his whole eight years of life, had anybody told him that his ability to reason facts was cool. His mummy and daddy were accustomed to it from Mycroft’s ability. By the time Sherlock came, it was old news. His classmates were always affronted, his teachers angry, the whole world furious that Sherlock had the nerve to exist so intelligently.
Whatever he’d been expecting, it certainly hadn’t been that. “Mary?” he practically shouted, ducking down in the booth as her head turned to the source of her name. Then, in a whisper, “Why was Mary going to hire a private detective?”
He could see it as though a physical manifestation of his vision truly stood before him. He could write a song detailing the appreciation and adaptation of returned soldiers with both hands tied behind his back. He lived through the war. That was the difference between himself and the other contestants- his personal connection to it all. Somehow, someway, he needed to put together a band- saxophone, drums, bass, trumpet, and trombone- that also served in the war. That would be the key.
“Tell you what. If you actually have a piece of helpful critique on my playing, run it by Tobias.” Greg’s face fell instantly, his smile becoming a ghost as his eyes made their way to Tobias, trumpet in hand. “If he agrees it’s serious, he can tell me. If not-”
Oh, Sherlock
Except that he couldn't.
Was it his imagination or was there a trace of defeated sorrow to the question? “That’s it, then?” he demanded of his friend turned stranger. “No cases together? No talking? We’re just two blokes who share a flat?”
Hmm... what's Sherlock writing? 🤔😉
“Surgeon.”
“Oh sure,” he drawls with a voice dripping in sarcasm. His knee started digging into John’s back and spots appeared everywhere around him. “You were acting that way because you
“It's complicated,” he said quickly, waving his hand as though he could physically push away John's curiosity. “So tell me, John: What sort of music
John shot a purposeful look toward Greg. The Supernova Band was the ensemble Greg had enjoyed as well.
No, the rest of the letters would never see the light of day. Sherlock’s regret ran bone-deep already. All he needed to know was already learned: John had loved him, John had believed him dead and begged frequently for that not to be true, John had suffered, and John would never forgive him for these digressions.
(Also, yes, that is light Mystrade you see at the end there. Mycroft did show up because he's not used to people talking to him like that and he is intrigued."
Sherlock was incredible, of course. His vibrato more controlled and expertly executed than any Greg had ever heard on a man. The greatest moment of his performance came, however, when he would cross to the piano and, maintaining eye contact with John, scatted his way through several difficult key modulations. They worked as a wondrous unit, John’s eyes never wandering from Sherlock’s, even as his fingers continued to perform wondrous melodies. They communicated nonverbally with an ease that couldn’t have gone unnoticed by anyone around them. They acted as a unit, two halves of a whole, two drastically opposite sides of one coin.
“Right,” said the soldier to the woman, eyes now adamantly avoiding Sherlock’s. “Just the 16 oz black, then.”
But Mycroft is busy with the UN. SH
that the murderer had to be here.
“So you’re being cautious, then.”
The words came out in a blur, the eye contact he maintained as he spoke was entrancing, impossible to look away from. John’s head spun from information, still reeling from when the man said-
He tried again: “My name is Sherlock Holmes, the colour of blue is decent on the eyes.”
“To be frank, I am relieved to hear you say that,” said Sherlock in a hushed tone that was difficult to hear over the blaring music.
,” his caged mind screamed at him.
There. The truth. The gravity of it echoed in his head in endless circles, swirling down his mind in loops that made his stomach lurch.
“Indeed.”
When Sherlock’s eyes slid closed and became accompanied by even breathing that was sending him rapidly into sleep, Lestrade patted his shoulder affectionately.
“Aye,” agreed the rest of them.
Not so much when I’m not listening. SH
John was a blur out the door. The sound of the door closing behind him was absolutely the loudest sound to have ever reverberated through this or any universe. The echo of it rang through Sherlock’s heart and mind for hours as he sat motionless in that bed.

“I have extras,” he muttered before huddling over his paper once more but not retaining a single letter on the page.
“No kidding? How do you know him? You wouldn’t happen to know what happened to, you know,” he said and pointed to his head, whistling.
potential TW: drinking
He lifted his thumb and middle finger to one end of the ribbon, pulling it with grace to allow the mass of string to tumble off and float gently to the floor. He removed the lid with shaking hands- though he didn’t know why- and gazed inside.
It was impossible, seeing him like this and not kissing him.
“No,” he drawled, a grin growing slowly, knowingly, entirely across his disbelieving face. “You said you don’t sing in
The man was saying something else. “Mmhm,” Sherlock hummed without looking up, putting his card down with the c'est la vie attitude he often reserved for those who would only ever be background noise to him.
“What? How am I wrong?!”
,” he announced with heavy emphasis. The gift was clearly wrapped by Sherlock but the design of the wrapping paper was surely John’s choosing while the tag sat face-up with a message of love from both of them.
Sherlock hopped off the table, put his shirt on with a wince of pain, and, to his surprise, crossed over to John’s desk. He plucked one stray pen and one dirty post-it and began to scribble something he couldn’t make out without exposing his curiosity and stepping nearer to him. Luckily, he didn’t need to wait long to satisfy his curiosity. Straightening up, Sherlock extended the paper to hand to John.
Sherlock’s eyebrows were stitched together looking down at John until, finally, looked deep into his eyes and whispered, “May I remove your clothes and suck you off?”
John’s hands ripped out of his own, the ghost of their touch remaining as his whole body tore away from Sherlock’s. His body rolled suddenly off the bed and before Sherlock’s love-drunk mind could figure out what was happening, John stood exposed before him, though he seemed barely aware of his naked form. His hands raked through his hair, his eyes raking around the room that he knew so well.
“That’s bloody us!” shouted Greg.
“Thirty-two,” answered John.
“And they’re for-”
“We’re married, yeah.”
So nobody had removed or searched for anything. Rather, someone had been tampering with the board in order to place this box there. But who? Who would have spotted the floorboard, known it could hold a package? Who would
“Yeah,” he answered without thought. He was always free.
“Tell me more about John, Sherlock,” prompted Lestrade casually.
“I would love to go back to school,” he confessed. “Medical school, specifically. Always fancied being a doctor.”
: 40s slang for bullshit
“Sherlock?”
She froze for the slightest of seconds before her motions resumed slower than before. Her eyes darted briefly to him, though her voice remained steady when she said, “You know, that’s the first time you’ve said his name without flinching since... Well, you know...”
Suppressing an eye roll, he responded with every bit of patience he possessed: “Socks, Sherlock. They're fuzzy socks.”
Greg sighed with relief, his hands resuming their stance over the wooden bass as he said, “Oh, thank God” and began plucking at an accelerated rate for the same tune.
Sherlock turned his eyes to Philip, his head held high but his tone soft as he prompted: “And Philip?”
The pleasure of these moments of intimacy were lost with worry. He pulled John closer still and worked to push away the consuming fears.
John slipped his hand into Greg’s with a flicker of a smile and shook vigorously. The air between them was dense with the alcohol lingering on his breath but John couldn’t pull his hand away. He’d asked for a man who was good-looking and Philip certainly hadn’t disappointed.
“Not bad?” John challenged, mock outraged. “That was amazing!”
The lot of them walked onto the stage with a confidence entirely feigned, falling into position, allowing silence to fall for one simple moment. In that moment, John’s fingers hovered over the keys of the magnificent Grand Piano and he understood with alarming clarity that
“Sherlock Holmes,” he repeated softly and it was such a ridiculous thing to repeat, his face flashed to expose his embarrassment. Jerking into motion quickly, he dropped his gaze and murmured “nice to meet you” before entering a long silence between the two of them, John focusing hard on attending to the bloody gash.
They both giggled and the laughter brought a deeper color to their faces that were already colored with a semi-permanent pink from the alcohol.
The answer was short, contrite, and shallow in his own ears.
It was better than he ever could have hoped. John noticed when no one else ever had. Could it be because John, unlike everyone else, had reason to suspect?
Sherlock returned in almost no time at all with both glasses close to the brim with a deliciously amber liquid.
“We gotta plunk it out here,” John said when he turned to the third page and saw some technical problems with the bass line. “We gotta fine tune it.”
“Like most soldiers,” remarked John, nodding.
Agony.
“It’s lonely being brilliant,” confessed Sherlock in a whisper, the rarity of that truth surprising even Sherlock.
He drew himself a bath and bothered with no luxuries- bubbles, salts, and the ilk. He sank in the water, closing his eyes and feeling the pressure on every inch of his skin. It was warm, welcoming. The still water left him feeling suspended in the air, it lifted him away.
The music halted to a stop, Philip’s voice rising above the tense silence of their judgement. “He doesn’t remember the bridge!” He was exasperated, tense, and made it quite clear that Sherlock was an unwelcome addition to their band of veterans.
“But- but-” and his entire body was shaking, his eyes blurry, his world shattering. He forced himself on, the clarity of battle- this dramatically different sort of battle- overcoming his urge to run. “But- I didn't throw the grenade hard enough. It… fell. Back into our trench. It rolled too far away from me to risk grabbing it for a second throw. It was better- safer to get out. I screamed at everyone to get out, screamed it over and over and watched everyone scramble away and I, too, crawled my way out.
The sun was setting behind him, the last rays of the day holding on desperately to dimly illuminate the world at its most ominous.
His eyes were wide in surprise, his lids falling in several heavy blinks as he took in the sight of a diminutive box sitting within the now-exposed small expanse of wood. The box, pastel purple and sealed with a crude makeshift bow sat innocently before him.
Without his sun tethering him into an orbit, he was spiraling.
Any minute now, the alarm would clamour with chaotic commotion. It wouldn’t be necessary, but the alarm wasn’t programmed to sense whether it was needed or not. It would go off and John, already wide awake, would throw an impatient hand to shut it off.
“Er- Yeah.” He cocked his head to the side, wondering why she seemed so surprised. Did he have something in his teeth? “Do you know him?”
No. No, it wasn’t okay. Without realizing he’d made the decision, he was on his feet and throwing open his bedroom door. He felt as though he were floating toward his destination rather than stomping like a maniac in a manner that would surely offend the floorboards. Rounding the corner with his eyes on the prize, he spotted the light come to life under the doorway and a wave of newfound anger mounted in him. So Sherlock
“It-It’s radio,” he stammered. “What does it matter?”
he could try to play it cool.
“I love you.”
John lowered his hand then, his eyes connecting with Sherlock’s only under the hood of lowered eyes.
“Thanks,” he said shyly, a nervous smile threatening at the corners of his mouth. “What about you? Going to medical school yet?”
Who was Sherlock now? Truly, he didn’t know. He knew himself only in relation to others, and the realization of it was creeping up on him more quickly than he fancied. So much of him was an act for those who surrounded him- even if they weren’t there. For many years now, Sherlock had simply known himself in relation to John: what John would like, what he wouldn’t, what would make him laugh, what would make him scowl. Depending on each assumed reaction, he attempted to act accordingly. Sometimes he got it wrong, but the center of his universe had always assisted in guiding his choices.
How could he possibly honour his friend’s dying wish? How could he bring himself to face his wife, to relay his message of undying love, to offer support for her when he couldn’t even support the weight of his own memories? Somewhere in Cardiff, his widow mourned without the knowledge that her hatred for John should run fiery in her veins.
This was once the most visited room, used to be the most precious room. Even now, his stomach fluttered with anticipation at the sight of it. Sherlock put one hesitant hand on the door knob, pushed, and he was instantly transported.
. Tomorrow's fic will be light and fluffy to heal my heart.
If you've been reading along but haven't dropped a comment yet, I'd love for you to do so now! I have no idea who has been reading along all this time except for a handful of you. Thank you to EVERYONE who has read and made this journey worth it.
Oh, right. That might have only been obvious to him. Sherlock reprimanded himself internally, fending off a wince that wanted to occur in response to his careless choice to make such observations of the boy. So much for forging any sort of friendship.
“Oi, back off,” he said, shoving Sherlock out of the way as though he actually were some stranger who had just spilt water all over him.
” sang ABBA.
“The sweater. I like it.”
John took in a large breath after some time, alerting Sherlock’s heart to the fact that he was about to speak. “Why do you say my name so much? Much more often than anybody else says it, even more than you say anybody else’s, you say it. Why?”
Truly, John was unsure whether or not he should laugh. The look on the man’s face was so serious, he decided to say, “That… would...
He possessed all the qualities of a person who should have been damned unbearable and yet the man drew affection with an ease that was frankly infuriating.
His head turned then and John was startled by how handsome he was. He had a long, narrow nose, a pronounced jawline, short locks of sandy blond hair, and blue eyes that were hooded with intoxication. John had always been a sucker for blue eyes.
He thought to himself, his head shaking indiscernibly and his hand clenching once again.
John glowered at him, refusing to match his joy even though his smile was doing things to him.
Maybe one day these two will just...
John’s stomach churned, unsure whether or not to believe Sherlock and his cynical smile. “1934? Are you serious?”
Sherlock. His Sherlock.
"SAMI! How did you type with your pinky broken?!"
“When's practice?”
“Then you’ll see why they called me “Tobias ‘punches people who irritate him’ Gregson.”
“I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for,” said Sherlock dejectedly, hoping his utter hopelessness came across as cold distance.
He’s a detective. Those three words threw everything else into place. He’d initially thought John was a client. Then, he’d known that he was a soldier from the Pacific theatre despite not knowing who he was. John had nearly forgotten that part in all the insanity of that day. He had been perplexed, wondering how on Earth he knew. “A detective, you say?” He took a drink while Sherlock nodded and he punctuated the realization with, “You’re right. Context clarifies.”
“Who’s what?” asked Sherlock, sounding sincerely dazed.
“With the tenderest of motions, I leaned up to your lips, brushing mine against them with the slightest touch. I felt the wet of the snowflake spread to my lip, a single gust of air expelling from us before we fell into each other with desperate intensity.”
He was out the door before any rational thought could follow.
With this, he felt burning and discomfort, but the words, their important truth diminished, successfully escaped freely into the world.
“Because he deserves to,” said John sharply, his eyes narrowing upon Philip, daring him to challenge him.
“None taken,” John said with a shrug. And he really meant it. And for one split moment, Sherlock could see it before him: singing with men who served, singing songs in front of people and becoming a part of a whole again. Serving a purpose. Doing something that was
He swore vehemently under his breath, faltering somewhat as the bell sounded because he was
No. None of that nonsense. Mourning would do no good in the next steps that faced him. He needed to jump into action; he would need to ensure that the news would impact Sherlock as little as possible. He needed to control the situation.
“Right. And do the others share your passion for punctuality?”
This wouldn’t have been a problem if Sherlock had simply listened to him.
Thank you for your help, Detective Inspector. Couldn’t have done it without you. SH
Sherlock was going to despise him. He would never fully understand. He could, of course, explain to Sherlock the truth. Though in doing so, Mycroft would be acting against Victor's direct request. It was, admittedly, much more difficult to disregard the wishes of a dead man that lay before him.
Sherlock joins the band for a rehearsal and it's beyond anything he could have expected.
“So what’s wrong?”
A flash of confusion blinded John, his smile faltering in response. “Sure,” he said lightly, “but is the date of departure on the paper you’ve given us?”
“Okay. New idea,” said Sherlock, standing up in one fluid motion. John panicked for a moment, certain he was getting up to leave when Sherlock smiled wryly and disproved every assumption within him. “Time for a game. You can handle it?”
Yet the third measure came to a swift close and, content or not, he had to begin. He took a shaking breath and the classic words flowed from him- from an ancient source of bravery he knew not how to consciously access:
“Yes,” she finally said with the note of a question in her voice. “Are you a client? Did you hear of him through his advertisement in the paper?”
“I love you, Dr. John Watson.”
“Wha-” John couldn’t believe how easily Sherlock was letting her go- abandoning the case. “Shouldn’t we follow her?”
“I thought this was a
“One room,” he said distractedly to the well-dressed man behind the concierge desk.
. A man that I develop affection for. What if when he sees me, he’s only disappointed? What if he runs away and I can’t stop it?”
She let out a sharp bark of laughter that was unmistakably one of ridicule. John didn’t care for it so he snapped, “What?” with as much venom as he could muster.
Oh, you clever man. “Of course. I’d be lost without my blogger.”
John assembled his clothes, attempting to pull them on, though the task seemed to be taking him a great deal of effort. “How can you say that?” asked Sherlock through a stifled sob. “It would not have been better. John-
Any guesses on who the POW is? I did tell you... But did you listen? 😉
At first, their friendship had been nearly as good as actually being with John. This was not the case in those rooms which took place after Sherlock’s return from the dead. Their relationship was strained, complicated, and desperately falling apart over time.
“Sounds like a lovely time, mate.”
“It is not!”
“Your eyes opened to stare into my eyes under thick eyelashes. That moment lasted for so long- the two of us connected in the snowfall.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock flushed a colour that John rarely saw on the man. His heart was racing, though he couldn't say why. Sherlock's words were hesitant and soft when he spoke, “I read that candles were a nice way to set a romantic mood.”
Yes. What was your first recommendation? SH
” John had said finally, slowly, uncertainly. He removed his finger from his book and set it down beside his leg. “
“Don’t be. We’re ready.”
“Then perhaps it should become
“I- sorry?” stuttered John, wholly unsure of what else to say.
“Wait, wait, wait,” John interrupted rapidly, fixing Sherlock with a disbelieving look. “Did you say you sing?”
He turned the knob and wrenched the thing open, blinking in surprise. He registered a flushed Sherlock before him, his eyes alive with the flame of excitement, his entire body radiating with the energy of an untold thrill.
“You don’t mean that,” John said with a confidence he was starting to lose.
When John seemed to truly see Sherlock, those moments were with him eternally. It was a fresh hell, a torture no foreign intelligence cell could inflict upon him, to watch the narrowing of John’s eyes when Sherlock was too close to a truth, too insistently touring the lies forced from him. Other times, he would forego that pain of analysis and instead watch John’s hands curl on themselves as his body seemed to fight against actions that would contradict his silence.
“Why did you kiss me?”
“Good Lord, it
Why didn’t Sherlock listen to him?
He went, if possible, even more pale but continued without hesitation. “I decided to leave.”
Detective? How could that be possible? He looked much too young. John stared at the hand, certain his bewilderment must be painted all over his face. “John,” he said with the inflexion of a question. Now, facing him again, John’s anger lost its sharpness. It held less bite, softened by the stunningly elegant air of this madman who he couldn’t even begin to understand. He took his hand and felt a shock of excitement run up the length of his arm.
“Yes, sir.”
Late January in Cardiff was insufferable, the cold penetrating through every thread on his jacket to seep into his skin, the cold reaching the very deepest portion of his bones. This excessively frigid air did nothing to quell his chronic pain. Wiggins curled in on himself, only willingly exposing his eyes as he tucked the rest of himself away beneath layers.
see you. And what I see is intoxicating. And that I want to see more.”
“Mr. Watson, surely-” began Nicholas.
The air between them turned into solid ice. Surely that must be why John was rendered completely breathless at the sight before him.
Blinding rage. White-hot fury. Conscious thought wiped out in favor of allowing misdirected violence long bred into his instincts.
“Tell me something about myself you believe to be true.”
He led the way, pretending to be blind to the suspicious look that Sherlock was shooting the two the entire time since John left. Both Greg and John fell into step with the beat of the music, an unconscious inclination to march to the beat of the drum instilled in them both in the military.
What has John been up to since the preliminary?
“Well, it was fucking brill-”
https://itsalwaysyou-jw.dreamwidth.org/
He was right. He could have stalled forever.
Three minutes.
“I can’t say,” Watson answered, tone light with curiosity.
John was a prism in his life, scattering color and beauty onto everything in sight. John was his guiding light, his conductor of light, his spotlight of truth. He had spent years learning how to be honest with the man who changed it all.
of my fav-” but the words caused him such pain, he had to stop. It was, apparently, too close to the truth.
He almost raced back to the table with the note, worried that Sherlock may have left to avoid John’s invitation. However, he remained seated, eyes wandering around the room and hands toying with the now-empty glass.
“Our patrons come to hear classics, to shout requests. They’re not interested in original tunes,” said Mel Jackson with a dismissive tone that triggered an anger deep within him.
The silence between them was tense and tumultuous. Sholto and Tobias were still, Philip’s eyes wide, John’s eyes a blaze of flame directed toward the culprit of instigation.
John closed his eyes tight enough to spot circles and reopened them, willing with the whole of his being to stop the emotional train barreling toward tears within him. It was painful, this sight of abuse on Sherlock’s back. Scars crawling along every inch of his back with reckless abandon were causing a horror show in his head: Sherlock, tortured. Sherlock, whipped into obedience. Sherlock, alone and afraid and enduring unimaginable pain.
“What?” said John, whose smile was stupidly remaining in place. “What do you mean?”
The universe was an obscure heap of nothing for ages. It could have been years before the world came back, slowly, into a black-and-white focus. When it did, Sherlock knew only two things: John had made a choice and the choice was not Sherlock.
“Yes?”
The truth must come out eventually. But how can Sherlock draw it out when he cannot speak the truth?
“Sherlock?”
And now on DreamWidth:
“Oh,” he said, suddenly impatient and dismissive of the question. “Philip.”
“This,” he said with a grunt as he attempted to activate his abs, “is why you’re my second best friend. You’re absolutely right. I learned science, why can’t I learn love too?”
“Go back further,” Sherlock demanded, turning his hand counterclockwise and he watched the scene rewind to the beginning before letting his hand fall. Never before had he needed validity as he needed it now.
Yet apparently the truth was all it took to break Sherlock of his stoic demeanour. His jaw slackened, his arms suddenly unaware of what to do, falling to his sides with drumming fingers. His head cocked to one side, eyes wide with analysis that made John feel naked, exposed.
All this time, John had been searching desperately for one minuscule crack in the door that he could sneak through and this was it. Right behind this crack in the door was everything he could possibly dream of.
Instead, he simply said, “I won’t regret telling you how handsome you look in that sweater.”
Sherlock wondered- more than once- whether he should speak up regarding a mistake he was hearing.
As some (many?) of you already know, this update took so long because my computer (specifically, my hard drive) shattered mere days after publishing the last chapter. Since I am wholly unable to tolerate writing on my phone, I wasn't able to write until just a few days ago. Thank you all for your patience! <3
“Will I ever suffer the pain of losing you?”
“No. Ask me if I leave disgusting experiments in the fridge.”
“Well it’s up to you, innit?” Alex said with a laugh. “You have to be there no later than 8 in the morning on March 22nd but most bands are planning on arriving a couple of days earlier. You know- to see the city.”
In order to win the competition, John must assemble a band of veterans. Luckily, John knows a guy (who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy).
Sherlock smirked like he knew something John didn’t. “I’m a detective. It could happen.”
“Come on, Mycroft,” he had said dismissively. “It’s more of a surprise that it took so long.”
He dropped his arm without a word and Watson fell over the unmoving body, back arching repeatedly with silent, encasing sobs.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in turn as well, half-mocking John’s reaction. “Of course he is.”
Those, surely, were acquired after their marriage.
Why had he done that? What had made him think he couldn’t afford his own coffee? His shirt was
Follow me on Tumblr, if you fancy it:
the exhibited one.
“An exchange,” Sherlock continued below a whisper. “He’s giving her money, she’s giving him a package. Good God-
No, only the thought of John had done that.
“It’s… blue?” he proposed lamely.
“Kiss me,” she breathed, and only now did his intoxicated brain realize that yes, she reeked of hard liquor.
“What does the evidence suggest, my dear Watson?”
“Anyway,” said John uncomfortably, studying his shoes. “I guess I’ll see you within the next two weeks, yeah?”
“Sherlock,” he observed, attempting to sound surprised and, somehow, indifferent. “You came.”
“Have you- er- seen who my opponent is?” he had softly asked one of the employees about five days into the game.
John thought for a long moment, hoping desperately for a satisfactory clever response to come to him. When none did, he conceded, “No, it just is.”
“I have friends in high places. Well- not multiple. Just one. And not particularly a friend, either” said Sherlock, still looking at John like he was a puzzle he couldn’t solve.
Hushing him again, John placed one hand gently against his shoulder to keep him in place. “It can wait, Sherlock. Don’t push yourself.”
Perhaps he was right.
His body was marched relentlessly forward, hauling him through abuse, torture, sorrow, and suffering in the name of life. All experiences came and passed without pity and in the end, it wouldn’t matter. This march had an inescapable destination: Samarra.
“Yes,” Sherlock drawled, the “s” coming out in a hiss. “Physical evidence is your basis. It’s not a deduction, however.”
And yeah, John is literally going to read the card on sexuality, hand it to Sherlock with no hesitation, and be like "ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ME" and then they're going to do it all night.
“John!” he bellowed, aggressively loud against the ringing silence John’s ears were accustomed to. He walked into the flat past John without waiting for any further exchange of formalities.
“Basic training,” he said, throat tight and fighting to maintain an easy mask.
He would begin to make up for his wrong-doings right now.
He was clearly, visibly fighting against a smile. John wondered how much he suppressed active emotion, wondered why he wouldn’t allow even this small happiness. Gingerly, he extracted a thick, woollen pair of socks that his mom had chosen for him. It was designed with pointed tops to remble cat ears, the neck of the sock bearing the eyes, nose, and whiskers of a cat while the whole foot was decorated with pawprints. His eyes scanned the others: the fox pair, the pair with doughnuts, the mix-matched sort that portrayed Marvel heroes, and others. All of them were fuzzy, all of them were adorable.
, but I must warn you that it's quite harrowing. I was positively nauseous after my research but it could provide character insight if you are interested.
“You’re a consulting detective,” he said at last.
, John.” His words were tense, almost… protective? “He is not high. He is not homeless. And he would never presume the worst in a person without knowing the facts.” John flushed a deep, solid scarlet. “He was hurt in the war. Nobody knows what happened, he can’t even remember obtaining an injury. My bet? He was shot in the head and they had a devil of a time with the surgery. He isn’t always brilliant but he knows things and he is still useful to society and others. Yet as much as this hypocritical society claims they want to help the men who served, no one will hire him. Because there’s ‘something off with him’ or he’s ‘
Sherlock gripped the phone tightly between his fingers, his knuckles marble white with the pressure of it. Stuffing down the urge to hurl the phone into the nearest thicket of trees, he rotated sharply on his heel toward a shoppe that had caught his eye. Not much was open at 7 in the morning in this gentle area, but a quaint cafe would have to sufficiently fuel his addiction. There would not be cocaine to be found until he was back in the heart of London, but coffee would move matters along.
This was so much fun to write. Thank you for reading!
Where there had only been ringing silence, there was crisp clarity. Victor always gave that to him: clarity. The incoherent muttering was the background to one soft, trepidacious: “John?”
The question caught Sherlock completely by surprise and he couldn’t immediately answer. He thought about situations that were supposed to make people hate other people. He thought about the worst things Victor could do or say to him. Yet not one single thing stirred anything other than sadness within him and he knew the answer with absolute certainty. “No. There is nothing you can say to me that would
He wondered if he should lie. Mind racing, he stole a look at Sherlock, desperately trying to understand what sort of music
John attempted a subtle glance at his phone, a difficult feat considering it was flipped upside down on the table. Fingers itching toward it, he looked around nonchalantly and then down toward the device only when his finger connected with the power button and he knew the digits would be displayed on the screen.
Face still twisted with displeasure of the alcohol rushing down him, Sherlock let out a tight “Ah,” spinning the shot glass between his fingers but remaining quiet.
There is was. All of Sherlock’s feelings were laid before the both of them. Having entirely exposed himself in body and emotion, there was nothing more to do but wait with baited breath.
The question was appalling to him and he couldn’t keep the offence out of his voice. “No, of course not. Jesus, you’re like… a work of art, Sherlock.”
am the dancing queen,” murmured Sherlock before reluctantly grabbing Lestrade’s offered hand and lifting onto unsteady feet.
She shrugged, eyes sweeping around the bar before landing upon John’s. “I try not to think about it. But I have to say, I am mighty pleased to see you here.”
His tears were screaming to come out, but he refused them. He was an idiot- a proper fool- to not have considered this. Of
Tobias walked without a greeting and his mind clearly distant from the room around him. Sherlock studied him studiously, his eyes raking from his deformed face to his long sleeves with raised skin peeking out beneath his shirt cuffs.
The four shots were racing through his veins now, his focus shifting without his will and his fingers tingling with acknowledgement of his state. He was certain his inebriation was plastered on his face for Sherlock to read as he pleased. Sherlock, on the other hand, appeared merely flushed, eyes perhaps tighter than before.
Not heartwrenching in their endings, which were all jubilant, but in the knowledge that things hadn’t really gone that way at all.
“John,” he said impatiently. “But wh-”
sang- in front of people, too. His mind ran inexplicably to Victor who was always pestering him to do something with his musical ability.
Sherlock Holmes made him feel pretty unimportant.
Poor Sherlock. :(
Two days.
“John,” he gasped, eyes locking on him with the desperation of a blind man granted only one more sight.
“Yeah, well,” he said, rising to his feet and refusing to meet the grey-green eyes that were wide upon him, “I’m not particularly bowled over by you, so I reckon we’ll forget about the dinner, ta.”
“It’ll require personal sacrifice,” John said, matching Sholto’s stature in solidarity.
“I used to go steady with her.”
It was days before John was able to procure time alone with Sherlock once again. The case, it seemed, must have been an interesting one for his friend- if he could call him that still- did not return home but for brief flashes of time when John could not talk to him.
“Tell me,” said Sherlock quietly, focusing his eyes with great intent upon her, hoping the intensity of his gaze would shock her as much as his deduction. “Do you tell people it was home for four years because you’re ashamed that it took you six years to finish uni?”
“And that train would take us home. Directly home. We would ride first class and everyone- they would thank us for what we sacrificed for Britain. But first, we needed to fight, needed to win.”
“Which story would you like to hear, my dear?” John's fingers looped in and around the curls so delicately, a lesser effort wouldn't have moved the hair at all. He thought of the beautiful mind beneath these curls. Once storing every memory like a computer and now weakened with age- but always beautiful.
“Cold,” said John.
“Hey, this is Greg,” John said over the music when they got to the circle table John had been sitting at with Sherlock. “The bassist, as you saw.”
Sherlock’s ears pounded with rushing blood. His voice was hoarse, terrified as he asked again, “But?”
“Holmes,” he said softly. There were times Holmes’ mind would wander from boredom and his insertion would warrant a smile, an eagerness to do something besides getting lost in his own thoughts. Other times, Holmes would find himself so deep in his mind, his friend’s interruptions would merely roll around the ears of the genius and a silence between them would continue.
The man was nearly standing in a puddle of his own making now.
His stomach dropped a bit lower, hastily letting go of the phone and allowing his eyes to comb his surroundings again. Imagining he didn’t notice the multiple pairs of eyes on him, he searched only for the familiar face he was waiting for.
It seemed to Philip that everything he had ever gone through was simply preparing him for the thick guard he now put between himself and everyone else around him. He exited the military at long last and finally go to law school- a long-time dream of his.
“How?” asked John. The word held more emotion than Sherlock had ever heard in the man's voice. In the lonely word was a world of pain and conflict. It broke under his uncertainty and Sherlock felt his hands turn clammy in the absence of John’s warmth. Sherlock sat up, his blanket falling to expose his chest but resting comfortably around his hips as he stared bewildered at John.
"hey! that's the name of the fic!" you, probably, after reading the chapter title
serious.”
A leap of courage supplied him with the strength to commit his hand to a grip on Sherlock’s shoulder, his fingers applying pressure and sensing warmth beneath the cotton shirt. “Hey,” he whispered, resisting his desire to lean in further but willing the sincerity of the words to ring true. “You’re going to be great. You’re going to blow them all away.”
John's heart lurched, a too-familiar pain spidering out into the nerves of his fingers.
Today's prompt: Star
“You,” said Sherlock suddenly, staring intently upon Philip who looked more than a bit alarmed to be addressed as such. “You were quite good.”
“It’s direct to Kings Cross, gentlemen. And the train has first-class cars reserved for movie stars. And you know what? We’re going to be on one of them.”
That's all, folks! Thank you for reading.
“Wow.” It was an unsatisfactory response, yet the only one John could muster. He was brilliant. Really, truly, astonishingly brilliant.
somebody. God, you’re just really hot!”
I will likely end up re-writing this one. The concept of this was much better in my mind, I was trying a different writing style from what I usually use, and I am delusional with exhaustion. However, I am out of time to fix it so I hope at least some of you enjoyed this ficlet.
And John continued talking to him but it was too much.
“Don’t worry,” he said, matter-of-factly. He moved around John fluidly, the motion sending a gust of air toward John that smelled of woods and coffee, and began to arrange the chess pieces into upright positions. “I remember how they were.”
If he dressed in black, acted blank and ruthless, if he truly emulated the colour of emptiness, then surely the book must be judged by the cover. Black was his cover; the colour of midnight, the colour of death. It represented his authority and sophistication while symbolizing the dangerous and unknown. The colour itself is a void where all other colours are absorbed. It takes and it takes and it takes and it does not reflect even a ray of light.
!” Sherlock was most definitely flustered now, and the look was so incredibly endearing that John felt his heart ache for the sight.
A sigh loaded with frustrated disappointment escaped Lestrade behind him. The sound shot a wave of irritation through him and although he fought against the urge to turn around that was welling inside him, the attempt was futile.
“John,” purred Sherlock, his forehead finding relief as it pressed against the cold window.
It was supposed to be a magnificent reunion: John would scan right over him in apathy before snapping back to look into his eyes. It would be his eyes- he knew it would. For Sherlock’s body was different now, his face aged and hard, his skin lightly scarred and different in its colour. But John would know his eyes.
No, not now. John shut his eyes against the ghost of Victor, willing him to disperse.
“Not yet,” he said with a false growl because being called “Captain” had been so extraordinarily hot, he needed Sherlock as badly as Sherlock needed him now.
Sherlock was right- Sherlock was always right. It took time- roughly twenty minutes- but eventually, Mary grew bored. The gentleman who she’d been courting before John had left and she had no luck with any other gentleman in the place. All this according to Sherlock since John had waited in the washroom all the while.
Philip hardened under his stare, his eyes moving rapidly between John and Sherlock. “He didn’t even serve,” spat Philip with bitter resentment, more to the ground than to anyone in particular.
When Sherlock caught the lingering eye of John on Christmas Eve, he inquired exactly what he found so intriguing.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was evident that Lestrade was in desperate need of a night out with a friend; with someone who would have fun and engage in shared laughter. The fastest course of action, of course, was for Sherlock to allow himself to "let loose." By letting loose, he would provide him with the entertainment of seeing the side of Sherlock that was so often locked away. It would help him, he knew it would.
“T-Thank you,” said Philip with a hint of a question.
He was coming down, now. The worst part passed, the world’s edges returning to their sharp corners. He thought of John, laying comfortable in his bed- his marriage bed. He couldn’t believe the loss of such a profound love. He couldn’t believe that the love that sustained his life was now over- had never begun.
“Oh, put a sock in it!” bellowed John over the man who would surely go on for ages without interruption. “It cost nearly nothing and it’s not just from me. It’s your present from everybody- Molly, Mycroft, your parents, Greg-”
y'all. I have never cried so hard while writing before. Who's ready for some happier days? I know I am.
“Yeah, he’s probably not better than you anyway, John,” Greg said, interrupting John’s racing thoughts.
John studied him with unsure eyes for what felt to be a small eternity. Whole stars could have been born and crumbled within the time that Sherlock sat, breath bated, for a response he was certain would never come.
“But still soft,” sniggered Sherlock.
“But I gravitated toward you as though I was not in possession of any control. I moved toward you slowly, smoothly, and you moved into me.”
He could pretend he was assessing the size of the crowd. He could pretend he was checking to see how attentive the audience would be. He could pretend he was simply observing people who would soon be cheering their hard work. He could pretend.
The truth was that they’d only arrived so early to prevent this exact happenstance. By appearing onstage last, it was guaranteed that they would be performing for judges who would be tired of the whole ordeal by the time any of them set a single foot on that stage. As the last band, they would have to be ten times more enthralling than the first or second band would need to be.
When Sherlock maintained a cocky appearance, arms crossed and eyebrow cocked, John shook his head at him and said, “I was in the Army, Sherlock. The
This time with a gentler touch, a more cautious motion, Sherlock placed his hands upon John’s waist. He made sure to apply enough pressure to securely lift him up once more, the body beneath his fingers much less tense this time as he adjusted the star into an upright position.
need this.”

Greg called John "Johnny boy." It's a cursed reference that I'm making.
With a swift, hurried motion, he removed the pants until the full length of Sherlock’s cock rose before him.
His heat was light, soaring within him even as he kept his face still.
He needed to find evidence. He needed
He could only nod in response, mind screaming at him to look at Victor and body unwilling to do so.
I mock you frequently, but every now and then you have a brilliant idea. SH
Sherlock took one last look at the nearly dozen socks he’d been gifted before closing the lid and placing the box on the table beside his seat. He moved toward John and he vaguely wondered if he should duck, move, or even run.
. Doing something that wouldn’t remind him of Victor every moment because this was new and exciting. Doing something that made him feel good and… wanted.
Adorably, Sherlock's nose wrinkled at the description.
John ran hastily moved to his seat and cared more about sinking into his desk than he did about whatever instructions she was providing. With a grateful sigh, he relaxed against the plastic and rapidly dug out his art supplies.
“I’ll tell him you’ll do it then.” John would have said something in the silence that followed those words cloaked in a disappointed tone but his tongue was too heavy to form any words. “Hey,” Al said quietly, hand on his shoulder once more. “Something will turn up, Johnny boy. Remember: the cream always rises to the top.”
“Why?” he asked suspiciously, seeming to expect some sort of foul play.
“Quite. You can’t take ten shots by yourself,” he said with the tone of someone who knew his words were fact. “Alcohol poisoning, Watson.”
I shan't spoil it. Tune in next chapter to find out when our boys perform the regional round of the contest.
“Payback?” teased John through heaving breaths.
“This,” John said confidently, his finger gesturing between the two of them, “is a date.”
-” prompted John, crooning the next line to the song.
“Right,” John said uncertainly. Then, more confidently to Sholto, “I saw Wiggins unloading outside. Philip’s with him. They’ll be in any moment.”
“Oh, please!” said Lestrade with a laughter that fluttered his words. “Come off it. You can’t pretend you haven’t noticed how he's changed you.”
But yes. SH
John didn’t need to think twice. Throwing all caution to the wind, he flew down the street to fall into step beside the man. The winter air was sharp in his lungs but he paid it no mind. Beside him walked a sexy, mysterious, and clever man. He was right out of John’s dreams.
It felt like an eternity until, finally, a stranger poked their head through the doorway and into the silent room.
“God,” he shouted in surprise. Normally, his shifts here never saw more than the occasional scratch from over-ambitious concert-goers wearing too-big jewellery. Once, he treated a sprain- but that was nothing more than applying a buddy tape with gauze to their middle and ring fingers. But no blood.

“Anyway, we all spent less than ten pounds each because we
Sherlock stood silently for a long moment, his brain’s churning was nearly audible in the silence. “It’s a horror I can’t bear to see in your eyes. These scars… they’re… ugly.”

“You know,” John said, suddenly on the edge of his seat and his body language exposing his own glee, “I’ve never told anyone before.”
, this band will provide relief from the relentless struggles of everyday life.
(or rather... where I got the sentence that he was reading. Because of course, he wasn't reading the real book.)
“Well you know,” he said with a shrug. “What with John and your newfound attitude, I thought you’d maybe at least consider the proposal.”
Nothing more than a feeling.

John stared unabashedly at the feet, warm and cosy in fluffy fabric that hugged the long feet of his friend. His toes wiggled a bit as he thought and the result was a chorus of dancing penguins.
Sherlock sat on the table and John wished he’d put on a shirt. It was impossible to keep his gaze away from the glorious marble skin and he hated forcing his eyes to look at the nondescript wall. With no willingness to kick Sherlock out and no medical reason left to treat him, he assumed the seat he'd been in before Sherlock had arrived.
John Watson was giddy with Christmas cheer and flushed with heat from the half-consumed cup of tea in his hand. His brother- more ridiculous than he could have imagined- was quite literally hanging off of him. One arm was thrown around the shoulders of the solider while the other was resting in playful motion on his stomach, both legs a mess of limbs over John’s lap. The two were sickeningly affectionate, unable to keep their bodies apart since they confessed their mutual affection.
that John liked what he saw. He felt ashamed of his open staring and desperately wanted to avoid contact with him.
“Can I ask you for a favour?” he said quite abruptly.
John, just home from the war, struggles to find work.
Sherlock ripped through his mind palace at a speed unprecedented. There was only one thing that mattered now, and as always, it was the same: John Watson. Getting to John Watson now, being before him now. He was chasing his last hope in the universe and it would be the only hope to survive endless denial. The floor was air beneath him in his race to escape, his feet flew more than ran as he passed it all: all his cases, all his heartbreak, all the times he’d ever pushed someone away without wanting to, all the times he’d spent laughing alongside John, solving mysteries with John, his college boyfriend walking out the door and Sherlock dying to stop it, endless memories of events that had always been working, always leading to this moment right now.
