Dean can’t breathe, the lump in his throat too hard to swallow past and the weapon tucked down the back of his jeans feels corrosive to the touch — the safety, untouched for months, remains just that. He’s on his knees at Claire’s feet before he’s even aware of moving at all. The concrete floor is cold and unyielding.
“You should’ve told me sooner,” Claire says, voice calm but wavering on the edge of something. Anger, maybe. Dean’s too far gone to tell the difference. “Five months, Dean. I just— I thought it was something I’d done. I thought he didn’t want to talk to me anymore.”
“Amenable? Did you eat a thesaurus for dinner?” Dean smiles right back, everything edged with a softness that hadn’t been there before. He’s closer, leaning in ever so slightly and Cas can taste the warmth of his breath. He’s not sure what part of his brain is controlling his body right now but he’s perfectly okay with it, drawn in by whatever magnetic force connects them, too strong to resist—not that he ever would.
when things get rough, when Cas grips his thighs just right and bruises linger like shadows for days.
To be honest, he hadn’t been thinking much when he left, too concerned with the fact that he’d had to buy the bones of a dead animal on Etsy, of all places. People are into taxidermy now, apparently.
In Dean Winchester’s rebirth, every inch of his being had been carefully curated by the divine, sinew and muscle and blood formed anew by grace. Each breath Dean has taken since he awoke, gasping in the dirt, is because of him. Hidden in the little infinities between time and space, he created. His entire focus realigned, dedicated only to forging cells from atoms he made. He rebuilt a body; repairing shattered ribs with marrow and bone, rebuilding an entire nervous system in all its complexity, mended synapses, organs, and a whole host of insignificant things that make up just what it means to be human.
“Fuck.” He sighs, not entirely dissatisfied. At least he tried. At least now he gets to gloat to both Meg and Rowena that this kind of stuff just doesn’t exist. No matter how many times Meg assures him that it really
He's so fucking wet for it, leaking all over his stomach as Cas fervently avoids touching where he so desperately wants to be held. A sharp breeze would send him flying at this point. But Cas, with fire in his eyes and magic in his veins, takes it as a personal challenge. Every. Single. Time.
All of a sudden, one shrieked at them from behind. In unison, the women turned around and shot at the creature, but it continued to charge them.
When he got to the front, his cart was piled high. The green-haired teenager at the register grimaced visibly, and the kid at the bagging station looked skyward, as if asking God to grant her strength.
“Well, we keep it simple,” Dean replied sarcastically, “tell her the guy she’s banging eats dead people, and we’re here to kill him. Or we could lie.”
“Lucifer is dead,” she replied softly. She placed a gentle hand on the side of Jack’s head. “We’re safe.”
“You were right,” he said, guilt crashing through him. “This whole time, we should’ve been looking for her.”
“Sorry, you caught me at a really bad time, I don’t mean to be rude, it is good to see you two again, it’s just…”
Great. So Velma was a stone cold skeptic. They sprinted down the stairs back toward the sitting room. They ran through door after door. Sam could swear that they went through the same hall multiple times.
It showed him the memory of walking into the river, Leviathans controlling his body, and before that, as he fell to the floor after releasing all the other souls back into Purgatory.
“So,” he said, wanting to break the silence, “Tell me, how exactly does this work with your patients? I mean, you show up as their dead relatives, and they think what?”
She wanted to turn around, go back to the safety of her home, back to her father. But she couldn’t. She just couldn’t. She clenched her jaw, and walked the rest of the way to her car, making certain she didn’t look back. She couldn’t bear to see the disappointment and betrayal on her father’s face.
“Uh… hi,” Dean greeted, suddenly acting nervous. Honestly, it was kind of amusing. “Uh, I’m Dean, that’s my brother Sam.” Sam waved half heartedly. “Mind if we join you?”
When Dean reemerged, Cas scoffed quietly. He was wearing his fed suit, but instead of a regular tie, he wore a ribbon with a brooch. On his head was a cowboy hat, and Cas realized that he was wearing cowboy boots. Cas had to admit, it was a pretty good look on him. In his hand was another cowboy hat, this one of notably lower quality.
“Thanks,” Mary replied. The kitchen fell into a loaded silence. Cas wasn’t sure what was going on, so he just continued to eat his breakfast. Truly, it was delicious. He hoped that Dean would teach him how to cook like this one day.
Sam figured he must have a concussion. His brain was whirring away uselessly, like an overheating laptop with a fan as loud as a jet engine. “So… wait a second, then why did he….”
Jack reached out a tiny, sticky hand and laid it on Gabriel’s cheek. Despite his fear of the archangel, Cas’ heart melted with pride. Jack was so empathetic already, and it made Cas so happy.
“More than alright, man,” Dean replied, leading the way down the hall, “I really missed you. We all did,” he added as an afterthought.
Dean sank back down onto the chair. This was too much. Apocalypse 2.0? Why couldn’t they seem to go a month without the world trying to end itself again?
But then their camp was attacked. Angels surrounded them on all sides. Lucy and Mary fought side by side, holding the angels back while the rest of the camp evacuated.
He turned to see how Cas was doing. The angel was on the ground, his blade laying in the dirt a few feet away, staring up at the blond warrior as he raised his sword. Without a moment’s hesitation, Dean sprinted up behind the man and plunged his sword through his chest. He fell to the ground beside Cas, who stared at the corpse with wide, fearful eyes.
“Sounds like a plan,” Sam replied as Dean strode past him, through the saloon doors. He followed, figuring Cas could deal with Jack for the time being. He decided to ignore Dean’s ramblings about the rest of the decor in the room as he unpacked his clothes and hung them on the god-awful stirrup hangers in the wardrobe.
Dean sighed. “The bitch put Cas through Hell for almost a year, tortured him, physically and mentally. I’m just…” he paused, searching for the right phrasing, “giving her Hell back.”
Her dad gave her a look full of disappointment. “No,” he said softly, “if you get involved in that….” He looked down. “Look, I was wrong to lie about Grandma. But you know what happened to her.” He had a point, Patience had to admit. But…
That seemed to sway Claire. Within minutes, they had grabbed Jack and as much weaponry as they could, and were on the road, Alex and Jack in Jody’s sudan and Claire and Kaia in Patience’s Jeep.
“Yes, haunted,” the record confirmed, “and if any of you can’t make it through the night, his or her share of my fortune will go to the others. Now good night and pleasant dreams, y’all.”
“Hiya ladies.” Donna hopped out of the truck in her cowgirl boots and fur-trimmed jacket and sunshiney smile.
To Sam’s surprise, he hadn’t forgotten much sign language. He and Eileen sat across from each other at the library table, signing back and forth as Sam told her about everything she’d missed. But his heart ached. They both knew that he’d need to send her away soon. She couldn’t stay.
“It’s fine, Dean,” Cas soothed, trying to adjust the pillows behind himself so he could sit more comfortably. His wound twinged painfully. That was not good. It had been multiple days since he’d recieved the injury; his grace should have healed it by now. The fact that it hadn’t was a bad sign.
“Alright,” Sam continued, “what about that night? Notice anything else? Maybe, uh, flickering lights, cold spots?”
“Tell me, Castiel from another world,” apocalyptic Castiel sneered, “what was it that was so worth falling for?” He lunged at Cas with lightning speed.
All of a sudden, a hand was wrapped around his wrist, preventing him from injuring the angel further. He turned quickly, infuriated and ready to attack.
He looked around. The Impala was parked in its usual spot. He couldn’t tell what time it was, nor how long he’d been gone. Had it been months, like last time?
At that moment, Cas entered the room, carrying Jack. He looked at John warily, still blinking sleep out of his eyes.
Lucifer groaned loudly and childishly, and banged his head on the table. “Why, why, why, with all their second guessing and their whining?” Cas resented that, but made no move to reply. “This is an emergency, Castiel, and all they’re gonna wanna do is put me back in the Cage.”
“No!” Dean defensively. It had been a childhood dream of his, but now… who was he kidding, they were in a kids’ cartoon! They were supposed to be teenagers, right?
Dean furrowed his brow. There was something off about the conversation; Cas had sounded robotic, emotionless, almost like he did when Naomi was in control.
“Of course you don’t matter,” the woman snapped. Her heart sunk as the truth hit her. “But they think you do. They’ll show.” Kaia didn’t believe that for a second, but so long as the woman deemed her useful, she’d remain alive. “And when they do, we’ll kill them and take the child.”
“Totally,” Dean said noncommittally. Benny didn’t need to know that Dean had never drank alcohol, or had sex. Back home, Dean was a clean-cut Mama’s boy. He dated only one girl, Lisa, and he broke it off because she wanted more. But here? He could be anyone.
“No!” Dean screamed, sitting up. “He went through all that, and agreed to be a freaking swan, just to find out that it was all worthless? What’s the point of it all?”
Dean couldn’t believe the ego on this guy! And yet, he found himself grating out those two words. “Yes, sir.”
Sam clicked the ‘send’ button on his computer, emailing their friends a Save The Date: Destiel is Canon wedding invitation. He knew he’d be getting a call from Charlie in 3… 2… 1… yep! His phone buzzed and he answered, equally as excited as his friend. This would be one
It was Dean who ventured to the bathroom, bringing a warm cloth to clean them up. He wiped between Cas’ legs and his own, and then rubbed Cas’ hands as he washed the come off.
comfortable…” the man scoffed. “I guess you won’t mind that I’ll have to come in your ass now? It’s only fair.”
Dean decided that he’d wake Cas up when they arrived at the college, but as he turned off the ignition and looked in the rear-view mirror, he couldn’t bear it. Cas looked so peaceful, and it seemed like he needed the sleep. A few more minutes couldn’t hurt, right?
“Likewise.” Cas said, a bit too clipped. He remembered that summer alright. A bit too well, if he was telling the truth. It was the first time Cas realized how important and necessary Dean had become. Cas missed his friend every single day that summer, but that didn’t matter when he saw how happy Dean was when he came home.
It was all too much. Cas’ saliva, Cas’ come, and Dean’s pre-come mixing together created the perfect amount of friction as Cas teased the head.
“I assume you know how to take care of yourself in order to prevent sub-drop. We’re both adults and aftercare is a personal responsibility. Own up to it – you shouldn’t have to rely on me or anyone else to do it for you. There is no reason to blame me for what happens after I leave here tonight.”
“Right? I saw this girl come out of the dining hall earlier and... whew!” Benny whistled low. “Legs for miles, soft curves, and hair long enough to really grab hold of. I wanted to sink my teeth into her right there! There’s nothing better than the warm wet heat of a willing female.”
“Well, for one, we’re going to be invited to a lot more parties like this. Frat boys will practically beg for us to join them.” He joked.
Dean wanted to laugh, but thought that might be too insensitive. He did feel sorry for the guy, after all.
Sam shook his head in disbelief. “I’m seriously starting to doubt your previous statement that we are indeed related. No brother of mine could be this focused on one activity.”
“Like this,” Dean answers suddenly as he pushes Cas back down on the hood, moving over him and claiming his lips possessively. Cas’ mouth is like a drug to Dean. He can’t get enough, and has no intention to stop tasting, licking, sucking, biting – especially when Cas seems to be just as affected (and addicted) as Dean.
“You’re going down, Dean.” There’s a glint in Cas’ eye, and yes, this is what Dean wanted. He wanted Cas to get excited by something. They had both been working so hard this semester that it sometimes seemed like they were roommates-with-benefits, instead of actual friends or significant others. Dean couldn’t remember the last time they did something that wasn’t scheduled three weeks in advance, only to be canceled at the last minute.
“Give me a minute. I might have one in my wallet somewhere,” Dean says as he fishes through his pants pocket and thankfully finds a small foil square. He squints at the expiration date and checks for holes.
The crazy antics did earn Dean a laugh. It was music to his ears. He stood up and wandered into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Dean spent an inordinate amount of time in there, but Cas didn’t think much of it. They had already been through this discussion of Dean’s bathroom habits many times before.
As Dean turned the corner and walked down the street, he pulled his leather jacket a bit closer and checked to see if anyone was following him. Although he was headed for the club, he hardly wanted to draw attention. He hoped his jeans, t-shirt, and flannel were inconspicuous enough.
Over the course of the next two hours, Dean learned which professors graded harshly, which of the three coffeeshops on campus had the best pastries, and what classes to avoid. He found himself laughing more than he had in a long while. Maybe college wouldn’t be so scary after all.
Dean turned to Cas with a sad smile. “I guess this is it. Thank you for doing this on such short notice. I really owe you one.”
“Maybe next time,” Cas replies. Dean wants to correct him, wants to say there probably won’t be a next time, that this is just two boys experimenting before college demands a better sex life out of them, but he takes one look at Cas’ face and can’t find it in himself to break his best friend’s heart.
“Once. Rhonda Hurley used her finger when we had sex. She didn’t even make it up to the first knuckle before I was coming. I guess I liked it then? I tried several times after that, but the angle was never quite right.”
Dean was 95% sure Cas was joking – which, thank Chuck he was finally picking up on sarcasm! – and was completely convinced once he saw the twinkle in Cas’ eye and his small smirk pulling at those lips. Dean stared a bit too long before remembering he had to say a witty comeback.
“We all have our hobbies, Gabe. Not to mention – the Novaks have a reputation to uphold. You with the parties, Luc with the cheating grades. We wouldn’t want to go soft now, would we?”
“Cas, you’re a genius! You always were the smartest in the group.” Dean grabbed Cas’ cheek and kissed him.
He kissed Cas’ forehead in reassurance. It was their “thing” – whenever they said goodbye to each other for a long period of time, or someone needed to be calmed down, that person kissed them on the head. Dean kissed Cas the first week they met in kindergarten, and Cas kissed Dean when his mother died a couple years later. It didn’t mean anything, just two friends caring about each other.
Finally, after Dean’s fingers cramp up from the weird positions and crisp morning air, he hears: “I’m ready.”
Around 8am, Dean pushed open his bedroom door to use the bathroom. He felt horrible – both physically and emotionally. Sam and Cas shouldn’t have to put up with him. He was getting too old for this behavior. He should be happy they found love, right?
“I’m telling you man, the top three things in life are beer, babes, and bacon. If I get two out of the three tonight, I’ll be happy.”
“Dean, there’s no denying that you and I share a profound bond. The things we have gone through together – “
Immediately, she hurried off and was lost in the crowd before Dean could blink. He wasn’t sure what just happened, but that raised eyebrow was doing things to him.
Dean knew he was acting like a petulant kid, but he didn’t care. Sam – and Cas – had lived with him long enough that they were familiar with his behavior, so they’d just have to put up with it. Dean could tell the Universe hated him. There was no happy ending in sight, and he never got the girl… or the guy, now.
A gust of wind blew the map from Dean’s hands. Dean groaned, watching it dance farther across the lawn as he tried to chase it.
Hearing that almost made Dean feel sorry for the guy, but he remembered what other things the man had said.
Once in his car and at a stoplight, he chugged a bottle of water that he found on the floor. Sammy must have left it there the other day, that health freak.
“Ya know,” Dean slurred. “If I had known how you felt, Sammy, I wouldn’t have pretended to be a couple with Cas for all those cases. It could have been you! You should have told me, man. I would have said yes.”
Circle of Hell Club quite well. Many years ago, Crowley brought him in as one of the first employees and was grooming him to take it over one day. But as Dean became older than most of the club’s patrons, he knew that this party lifestyle wasn’t for him. Thankfully, that was around the same time that Dean’s dad named him the head of daily operations at their family business, Winchester Auto. Dean’s first project there was to oversee the buying of Singer Salvage Yard. It was sad because Dean honestly liked Mr. Singer, but Dad was counting on him. If everything went right with that initial sale, Dean was on track to one day inherit his father’s business and become President and CEO of the company.
Cas isn’t sure what to do. Obviously, Dean is not awake yet, and therefore unaware of what he’s been doing. Hearing yet another muffled moan, though, Cas thinks he can help them both out.
They headed towards the direction of Dean’s dorm. First-years weren’t allowed to move into the frat house, so Dean shared a room with a guy named Andy. He had a weird sleep schedule and always complained of headaches, but other than that, he mostly kept to himself.
The rest of their conversation was cut short as the bell rang for their next class. For the rest of the day, though, Cas couldn’t stop thinking about if Dean had tried this particular technique.
Halfway through his stream, Dean said: “I can feel your eyes boring into the back of my skull. It’s creepy to stare at someone urinating, you know.”
He finished up in the bathroom before heading to bed. As he was falling asleep, one last text came through.
“Dean, I’m serious. You can’t distract me with sex whenever there’s a problem. Orgasms don’t fix everything.”
Afterwards, the stranger wiped himself quickly and zipped his jeans, walking towards the door without a second thought of Dean, who was still bent over the toilet with his pants down.
They watched in pity as Dean got slapped by a woman. Sam cringed. Dean headed towards the bathroom. He never returned to their table.
a minimal amount of friction due to the condom. On a semi-related note, I do think you’re moving too slow. You’re going under the natural speed that you should be. Lube would encourage faster movement, because there’s less drag.”
Dean pulls out of Cas entirely and looks him straight in the eye. “I might not be an expert on gay sex but that is probably not the intended reaction.”
“Just try it, Cas. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work and I’ll make it my duty to find you someone worthy to fuck.”
“Look, Sam. I love him and I do want to marry him, but he has to be ready to admit those feelings on his own.”
“He agreed to the deal. By the time he got to the bottom of the river, though, Phaeton was already dead.”
Speaking of which, they were all huddled around one of the bonfires as Dean strummed his guitar. People had stopped what they were doing to go listen to him, as was the usual response when Dean typically started playing. Gabe was man enough to admit that Dean had an alright voice. The sound of the waves crashing in the distance definitely added ambience. And Cas was smiling, which is all that really mattered.
“Let’s work up to that, yeah?” The man patted Dean’s cheek. “Don’t want to overwhelm the newbie. You might run away and never come back.”
“You – you wanted it?” Dean repeats, not comprehending words and thoughts this early in the morning.
Dean finally came out of his room many hours later, much more sore than he originally had been during the earlier part of his hangover. Sam saw his sheepish look and nodded towards him, accepting the apology that might never be spoken. Sam’s job was done – maybe he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it turned out right in the end.
missing that. No one had to know about his guilty pleasure except Cas. Though, Dean would admit that the bending and stretching did help with their sex life).
“I thought you liked my ass!” Dean exclaimed, shoving Cas’ shoulder playfully. He turned on his stomach, wiggling the body part in question. “You pulled it out of Hell for somewhat selfish reasons, after all. I bet you just wanted to see it live and in person.”
Cas laughed as soon as he recognized it as one of Dean’s mixtapes – this time, labeled as “Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.” His best friend had spent the better half of high school teaching Cas what good music was.
The man behind Dean was holding his hips so tightly as he fucked him, that Dean knew there would be finger-shaped bruises tomorrow. Good, he wanted to remember this. He wanted a souvenir, even if it was temporary.
After putting each arm in its respective hole (and Dean did not want to dwell on the sexual implication of that), he faced his friend. The man ran his fingers over Dean’s shoulders and smoothed out his lapel.
“I admit that I am not too familiar with most human customs. However, would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?”
“Dean, please. I’ve already stretched myself open and made myself hard. All I need is another set of hands.”
If Dean were honest, he’d say that the light blue dress shirt brought out the man’s eyes. However, he settled on one last look and led with: “Why don’t you unbutton it?”
The room still dark, Dean pulled down his pants and separated his ass cheeks a little, being careful of his soreness. Indeed, what he saw gave new meaning to the phrase ‘the sun shines out of his ass.’
“No, you don’t understand. You could probably do what I like to call ‘The Reach-around.’ It’s when you lay on your stomach and tuck your dick down so it comes up and into your butt. It takes a couple of tries to keep it in there, but you should be able to fuck yourself if you’re desperate.”
“Ah, yes. Have you not tired of him yet? I must admit, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he is obedient and gullible. I’m sure in a few weeks’ time, he’ll be a distant memory for you. The kind thing to do would be to let him go. Don’t break his heart.”
Dean laughed. Yes, it was true that Cas was cursed – or blessed – with perpetual bedhead. It always looked like Cas had been freshly fucked. Dean imagined he looked the same tonight.
It was the last week of their senior year, and the summer weather was at an all-time high. Of course Cas had to choose the one college dormitory building that was located on the top of a hill, which made each step feel like a million miles. Dean still reminded Cas about how he almost crashed his prized car going down the hill during an especially dark and rainy night. Summers weren’t any easier, it seemed.
It was a short drive to the neighborhood park, but it was hard to find a parking spot that suited Dean. He dropped Sam and Cas off at the front, opting to drive around the lot once again before choosing a stall under some shade.
“You know how much I love to participate!” The adorableness of Cas’ pout should be illegal. That, combined with the puppy-eyes that he learned from Sam, was what made Dean ultimately crack.
There once was a man that claimed he was a healer. He had everyone fooled – everyone except me. The queen of Russia kept him close as her personal advisor, and the ladies fell under his spell as well. He loved being in the limelight, but soon the fifteen minutes of fame would be over. Even
“So… you like getting pounded into a wall, do you? I can work with that,” She leered at him. Dean backed away, feeling creeped out.
The man turned back to Dean and said, “Sorry about her. She can come off a little too strong and doesn’t know when to back off.”
“And when exactly would that be? We spend every waking minute with each other, Dean! To be honest, I’m getting kind of sick of you.”
“Well, I met Benny there. It’s so cool that you’re here, man! I can’t believe the coincidence,” Dean mused.
“Oh come on, Cassie. You only come to these parties to hook up, but as soon as the mission’s accomplished, you disappear from my life. Am I that horrible to be around?”
Oh yeah, Sam was coming up to stay the week with them before they all drove back to Kansas together. How could Cas have forgotten?
He chose to walk the short block to his friend’s house instead of driving, because it gave his body something else to do besides getting hard for his best friend. Dean tried to explain the physiological response as naturally caused by teenage hormones, but this was Cas – his best friend who was a dude. A dude who was very much gay and currently asking a seemingly straight Dean to… what? Touch his cock? His asshole? Make him come?
“Cas?” he asks warily. “Did I do that? Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! I never meant to…. That was wrong of me… I shouldn’t… I didn’t have your consent… Just because I’m a guy and you’re a guy and you like guys… oh man, I had no right. I’m just gonna go, yeah I’m gonna go and take care of this,” he motions to his own crotch and moves to get up from the car.
“Good?” he asked, looking Cas in the eye. His friend returned the gaze, nodding. “Mhm. Thank you, Dean.”
The thing was, though… nothing excited him anymore, which is why he found himself on the corner of 2
Dean pouted silently. He opened the screen door and looked back to Cas, as if he might change his mind.
“I hope you prepped yourself before coming here,” the stranger added, pulling down Dean’s pants and underwear. They were only held up by where Dean’s thighs pressed against the toilet. “It would be a shame if you had to wait any longer than absolutely necessary.”
People say that time heals all wounds, but I don’t believe that. I believe that with time and isolation, anger grows. I – along with others- have lived a millennium without you, and things haven’t improved since you left. You abandoned us, and left us to clean up the mess you made. More importantly, you left me to take care of Dean Winchester. He and his brother are more of a family than you or the other angels ever were.
Gabriel Milton and Castiel Novak had been stepbrothers since they were little, but no one would ever expect it. First, they were the complete opposite of each other: Gabe the party animal and trickster, Cas the studious nerd who loved books more than people. They also never were seen in public together because Gabe had a certain ‘cool-guy’ reputation to protect. But if Cas was ever bullied by someone at school, Gabe would always find a way to get back at the jerk. Although it didn’t seem like it, Gabe really cared about his baby brother… which is why watching over him at his senior Sunset and Sunrise party was so important. After this, Cas wouldn’t need Gabe looking out for him anymore. He was on his own, and soon would be off at college. Gabe didn’t know what he’d do if something happened to his brother there without him, so much so that Gabe had started having mini panic attacks these past couple of weeks leading up to the farewell. Thank goodness Cas’ best friend Dean would be attending the same school.
Sam found them later, in front of the dwindling fire. There’s still no sign of clean blankets but he hands Cas’ trench coat to Dean like a lifeline. They wrap Jack in it together, the worn lining soft against his brand new flesh. He fusses at the material but settles back into Dean’s arms as he is held.
He smooths out where his fingernails bit into the leather of Dean's jacket, unable to completely hide the fact that he's thinking about his mouth wrapped around— Oh, he's really going to hell.
Cas laughs and what light and fleeting thing it is. An errant stream over a pebbled shore. "You're unreal."
That's the life he should be living; white picket fence, 401k, 2.5 kids, gorgeous wife or husband or… well, they never really talked about that, but it doesn't matter, not to Dean. Sam got out and Dean roped him back in and now they're co-parenting Lucifer's bastard offspring.
Dean reaches across to him, his fingers catching beneath Cas's chin and turning his head so their eyes meet. There's nothing but sincerity burning away behind the green.
It takes yet another orgasm, slow and sharp as it pricks its way up from his groin until he’s shattering completely against his own resistance, to lull him to sleep; hot and sticky and past the point of discomfort. He rolls onto his back, letting oblivion drag him into the black.
In the time it takes him to throw the heap of white at the floor, Dean is tugging off his own shirt and, not to sound cliche but what the fuck? Averting his eyes is not an option.
and done all of it because it was the right thing to do. He’d risked everything for this. There are so many parts of Dean that want to revert to his roots, claw back any scars hunting left deep in him and slaughter this monster that would end the world in a tantrum, but it reaches for him and every instinct in Dean’s body calls to reach back.
“Finally! I thought it was gonna take you all night.” One step closer. Another. Until there’s less space than he’s comfortable with between them. Cas’s heart stutters a little and he realises that, for the first time in a long time, he’s genuinely terrified. “I’m a busy guy. Deals to make, souls to collect. You know how it is.”
brings him even closer, impossibly deeper, and his knot is right there for the taking. It’s right there, teasing the edge of his rim on every stroke It’s right there but not settled inside him yet. Why?
—takes down each one with a snarl and a smile. Dean loves the proud looks, the way his eyes shine in low light alleyways and when the kisses taste of something more than just tequila and salt.
In reality, Castiel was already halfway to being over it by the time he buried that damn box. All he needed was a little, you know, kick for him to realise it.
Coming untouched isn't as common as pornos and eroticas like everyone to believe. Cas' dick is just that good.
His feet feel less like they’re buried in the ground but the urge to run still escapes him. It takes a few moments just taking in the sight before him for Cas to realise that it’s not entirely fear that’s keeping him rooted.
The man looks him up and down, lingering over parts of Cas he hadn’t paid much attention to himself. His thighs, his chest, his mouth. Part of him wants to confront this stranger about it. It’s not nice being objectified like that, subject to what can only be described as a predatory gaze.
His brothers and sisters had always scoffed about the fragility of humans; their hot blooded impulses and their fragile minds, so easily broken by the faintest touch of heavenly might. Castiel had thought—hoped—that the fabled Michael Sword, would be different. Special.
Cas, still leaning over him, still with Dean’s hand held to his face, licks a stripe up the centre of Dean’s palm. It’ll be over in seconds if he keeps doing shit like that.
“That being said,” Cas muses, taking the hand from his cheek and holding it against the leather couch cushions next to Dean’s head. It’s barely even a restraint, just a grip over his wrist, but that doesn’t stop Dean’s stomach from dropping out his ass, through the floor and down through the basement. It’s a heady mix of anticipation and arousal that floods his brain and he’s so ready for it. “It would be interesting to see the effect of Sam’s spell on refractory periods. I would love to go all night with you.”
Dean’s 100% convinced he’s getting a slap for that one—wouldn’t be the first time he’s overstepped the mark with banter at work—but, after a few seconds of stunned silence only punctuated by the tick of the wall clock that’s always two minutes early, both women burst out laughing.
It’s skin and sweat and hushed curses and sharp teeth against his neck. It’s the wet slap of his cock bouncing against his stomach and the urge to reach out and take it. It’s knowing his hand will get dragged away, pressed flat into the sheets below in a crushing grip. It’s the finality of cresting that all encompassing peak that’s been taunting him all day and crashing over the other side like a wave, dashed against the rocks to one of many oblivions he’s had this week. The world blurs as he comes and it’s so right—so fucking right—but not enough.
Quickly as it came, the cold stare is gone, replaced by something much much darker, burning in its intensity. It could be considered, in some circles, as sleazy, which would be uncomfortable if he weren’t so attractive. Why is he so hot? Is that a prerequisite for demons? Are they all down in hell looking like ruggedly handsome runway models?
Jack still cries, his tiny lungs breaking on choked gasps for air, and Sam sings Free Bird in the softest voice, just like Dean used to.
“I can feel your magic call to mine, Dean. I don’t know if it wants to consume or caress you but I can’t help but burn when we touch. It’s never been like this with anyone else, not for me. So, if you think I’m having second thoughts about my attraction or my permissions when it comes to what I am allowed with you, I must confess, I am quite clear on how you want me — you are incredibly vocal about it — but I pace myself because I intend to last more than two seconds once I'm inside you.”
It feels kinda ridiculous, crouching in the middle of the road, wielding such a small thing with such obscure intent. If the cops pulled up, what then? How would he explain?
“Noted, bitch.” The image of Rowena fussing between an intricate black lace gown and a silk red one flashes into the forefront of his mind. It’s no longer than an instant, a glimpse into something not yet cemented in the past. The red gown sports two thigh-high slits and she toys with the fabric between two fingers and, despite being surrounded by the cloying scent of citrus sharp mint and the soft slosh of water against his chest, Dean can feel how soft, how delicate and cold the fabric is. “Tell Ro she’s gonna look stunning in the red. I don’t know what you did to bag that woman.”
“I could say the same thing.” Cas breathes, catching the shell of Dean’s ear with his lip. Dean shudders, winces. “You okay?”
’, Castiel.” Kelly shouts—he shouts—Jack shouts. “I’m going to die. I’ll never meet him. I’ll never hold him. He'll never know me or love me.”
Jack doesn’t cry once, barely even makes a fuss as she takes to carrying him around, walking through the bunker with his head buried in a mass of blonde curls. He bubbles along as Claire talks with Sam about some vegetarian restaurant just outside of Sioux Falls that they’ll have to hit together next time he’s around. She talks to Dean too but it’s stilted, just shy of forced.
Thankfully, they settled into bunker life with Sam as their buffer. He doesn’t know about the confession, and why should he? The moment was personal. Theirs. The memory of it weighs on him daily, each word a stone in his gut. Cas doesn’t bring it up and Dean doesn’t want to ruin the relationship—such a fickle thing—that exists between them now. Just like Cas said: happiness isn’t in the having.
But he can’t say it. Can’t say his name. It sticks to the roof of his mouth like tar, cementing his lips shut until he swallows it back. It sits like a stone in his belly but at least he can talk again. “Not Lucifer. Jack’s not his. He’s ours now.”
At first, it’s dry sobs. He attempts to choke them back, smiling at Jack who reaches for the bottle like it’s the most important thing in the world. To him, it is. There is no heaven, there is no hell, there is no danger or grief or loss.
“Hurry up.” Dean bites, teeth grazing Cas’s bottom lip in the process. Sharp, but not sharp enough. The thought of him, impatient and wanting, pushes so many buttons Cas didn’t even know he had.
He’s halfway through counting to ten when there’s a hand on his lower back. It’s Cas’s, of course, feather-light touch so easily discernable from the heavyhandedness of the rest of his team. He appears beside Dean for a moment. Dean’s not angry, but tension he didn’t know he was holding seeps out of him at the gentle press of fingers. It says so many things but mostly it asks
pulsing between his ears. Somewhere along the way, his brain to mouth filter falls just ceases to function and the question spilling from his mouth catches them both off guard.
—” The reply catches, torn apart by a cry as Cas hits that much deeper, that much harder, that much closer. He fucks the scream right out of Dean's throat with precision and vigor and nothing less than perfect aim.
There’s a much larger part of him, hidden deep down behind whatever it is that remains of his sanity, that wants to ask for his number.
Cas shudders as Dean’s hands graze his thighs, pushing along the rough wool of his slacks. The cool air against his cock in contrast with the warmth of Dean’s proximity has him harder than he ever thought he could be in a decrepit motel at the edge of state lines but it doesn’t stop him wanting. Doesn’t stop him thanking whatever was going through his wine-addled brain that had him agreeing to come out here, mess with dark forces on the off chance that he might succeed. Doesn’t stop him gripping Dean’s hips and rolling them so he’s flat on the bed, legs hiked around Cas’s waist.
He steps closer, Jack still fussing in his arms. Dean wants to tell him what that means, that Jack wants to be closer, wants to touch, but it doesn’t seem like the time. The icy intensity of his eyes has never been warmer and Dean melts beneath it. “Did you mean it?” He asks. “What you said?”
“Please,” He moans, one palm shooting out to grip Cas’s shoulder. He could’ve crushed it beneath those calloused fingers, turned his bones to dust. He could. But he doesn’t. Instead, he begs.
"—or their business,” Charlie’s stopped pouting, taking instead to rolling her eyes. They’ve had this conversation so many times—last time it was Hermione, Éowen the time before that—and it never sinks in. “But you gotta learn to keep your trap shut when it comes to protecting your fictional wives, Bradbury. They’re not gonna fuck you!”
“You don’t have to, let me.” Dean makes to stand but Claire, in almost a mirror of Sam earlier, wields her fork as a warning.
“You do,” He nods, looking at where Jack clutches Dean’s thick fingers with his tiny palms and, for a second, Dean feels only love. It’s gone just as quickly as he registers it, replaced with only a hollow ache. “And he’s incredible.”
smells good. It takes everything Dean has to not to present himself, needy and willing. The cloth drags higher up, pausing to pay extra attention between his cheeks, cleaning up his mess with deft touches. Something catches on his rim and Dean gasps, eyes snapping open to take in the view.
“I think I need institutionalising at this point," He doesn't stutter, which is good. "So it’s best to not trust my judgement.”
Dean stares up at the hollow of his lover's throat, thinking of how easy it would be to sink his teeth into the sinuous flesh there and leave a bruise for days. Cas stares right back like he's witness to something incredible; a shooting star or a volcanic eruption or the way Dean smirks, all defiance, like he's winning this fight. The throb of Cas against his thigh says he has. The way Cas surges in for a kiss says the jury's still out on that one.
“Cas?” He can feel himself falling apart, feel the sureness of his talk with Sam fade into anxiety. He just lashed out at the guy holding his baby, like an idiot. What if he’d dropped him? What if he missed?
Sam perches beside her, reaching to wipe away one of the tears. It drifts from the pad of his thumb, dissipating in the circulated air like smoke. He says something like
Dean can feel the twitch of Cas’s cock against his thigh and he’s not sure how much of this he can take. Judging from the amount of slick he’s trying to hold back, clenched tight to prevent any leaks, he can’t hold out much longer. “Yeah?”
The looks he gets in response as he shoves Dean backwards is priceless. The solid single knocks the air right out of him and Cas zeroes in on the breathless laugh he gets as an answer. Those just aren't the sounds you’d expect demons to make. Then again, his knowledge of demonology is limited to Rowena’s library and this sole encounter so… maybe, he’s in for more where that came from.
“Good luck with that. Donna still owes me fifty from that werewolf in Wolf Trap.” She stands and for a second Dean realises he’s been listening to this conversation but not really partaking, sitting silently as Jack’s feeble grip clenches and unclenches on the hair at his chin. Claire doesn’t go anywhere though, just collects the dirty dishes. “These good to go in the sink?”
“Lucky for you, I always show up prepared.” Dean sighs, reaching over the edge of the bed to retrieve his jeans. He, like magic, produces a single foil wrapper and two sachets of Astroglide from the pockets and Cas has never been more relieved to see lube in his life. It takes a second for disappointment to set in. Dean catches it before Cas can let poison seep in, reaching out to stroke the scruff along Cas’s jaw. “Don’t pout. This isn’t a regular occurrence for me. Just like to be prepared.”
He nods, taking a seat in the velvet wingback they'd hauled into Dean's room. It doesn't match the furniture or the second-hand crib, but it's more comfortable than the desk chair and offers more support than the bed.
He’d not managed to procure a shovel or spade but Rowena’s hand trowel hangs heavy in his pocket, hitting his leg with every other step. He’ll thank her for it later, while simultaneously rubbing her nose in his failure.
It’s always there. The hesitation. It’s not a reluctance — Fuck no, Cas is anything but reluctant — but it’s a trepidation, almost. As if he’s not quite sure if he’s allowed to be like this, to experience it, to touch him. The first time, it’d been cute. Dean had felt the nerves coiled tight in his partner’s belly and made a night of unfurling them, getting to know just which buttons to press to reveal another piece of the hot professor pinning him to the mattress. It had been a memorable evening, to say the least. Top 10, easily.
“I’ve been so out of it these past few months, Claire. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I never called. I haven’t— It’s no excuse.
“Dean— he might seem a little rough around the edges but he’s a good man, his brother too. Some of the only ones left in the world.” Cas, beautiful Cas, ruminates on the thought for a second, eyes slipping shut as a private smile crosses his mouth.
“That you got this, Cas. You always do. You just gotta do it, you know?” He takes the joint from Cas’ fingers—almost touching but not quite—and places it between his own dry lips, inhaling steadily, slowly. Time stops and it’s just the two of them, surrounded by fumes and each other. “You’re in your head too much, man. Sometimes you just gotta channel all that shit and make it happen. Take a leap.”
“What, you need reminding?” The man scoffs and his voice melts like whiskey over gravel. How can it be so impossibly rough and smooth at the same time? Jeez, Cas constantly sounds hoarse no matter what he does to quell it. He’s never felt self-conscious about it before. Is this jealousy? “Come on, man.
"It's ok, Sammy. Hand him over." Sam's hand is giant against Jack's head, cradling it so gently. Azazel is long gone but Dean doesn’t need to be a psychic to know the look of old wounds being torn open. They are the same — him and Jack — both born into things bigger than themselves. Both unable to do anything about it.
“You still want to make a deal, right?" Dean takes Cas's forearm, not in coercion, but with something that looks awfully like concern in his eyes. It doesn't freak him out as much as it should when they flash to unfathomable crimson as Cas finally looks at him. "You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours?”
Sometimes, when he slips into Cas’ bed at night instead of his own, lips tasting of salt and cheap beer, he gets enough of a glimpse through the cracks to see who Dean Winchester really is. They don’t talk about it, but they don’t dismiss it either—seeking each other out in the dark.
Dean falls, rather than climbs, through their window. Which is a feat in itself considering the apartment is on the third floor and he’s definitely had to make a dicey jump from the fire escape to make it—Cas knows, he’s tried. He thuds to the carpet with a muted
With a slippery twist, Castiel pulls his fingers free. “I should’ve been here. I should’ve—” He starts but Dean interrupts, whine tearing from his throat when he’s empty. Skin on slick on skin drag burning through him, wildfire made flesh.
But he can’t. Cas, stubborn, stupid, impossible Cas, would not have let that happen. He’d taken off, protected Kelly, protected
Cas can’t help it. Can’t resist. He steps into Dean’s space, shame at his nakedness nowhere to be found. Dean looks up at him with the same reverence he had earlier, back in the street when it had just been them and moon as their witness. Cas kisses him again; softer, sweeter.
Demons are real. They’re real and there’s one right before his eyes, looking like something out of a fantasy. In comparison, the ache in his chest seems minimal. He takes a deep breath, letting the night’s chill ground him. “I just want to know what to call you.”
“I got it from a friend.” If you could consider Meg’s shady cousin-slash-arch-nemesis a friend, sure. How Crowley got his hands on grave dirt is anyone’s guess. Cas tried not to think too much into it at the time. He’s kinda forced to dwell on it now, though.
Charlie breaks first, then Jo, then Eileen. Hell, even Crowley chuckles from his perch behind the register. Laughter fills the air like it belongs. And it does. That’s all Dean ever wanted when he opened the store in the first place—a safe place to share with his friends-turned-employees and anyone else that needed shelter, company and a good book. It was never his intention to garner a reputation among the queer youth of Kansas City, but hey, as a card carrying member of the LGBT community, who is he to deny their custom? It also doesn’t hurt that, with the exception of their weekend guy, Garth, all employed staff members coincidentally fall somewhere under the queer umbrella.
Castiel Novak, 31, is making out with a demon and he can't find it in himself to find a problem with that.
This time, it’s his turn to nod. So he does, letting Cas take the floor. He crawls closer, laying Dean back down onto the couch as he does so and, yeah, Dean’s not surprised as his dick leaps against his stomach, trapped beneath the ratty sweats he’d pulled out especially for their date. Comfort over style, of course.
She loves him, too. Dean’s yet to meet anyone who doesn’t. That being said, Jack’s current visitors have been limited to Dean, Sam, Claire and the pizza guy that drops off their Friday night order. But parents get that way about their kids, apparently. Sometimes he still looks at Sam that way — like raising him is the greatest thing he’s ever done.
He looks at Jack just to see depths of blue, so painfully familiar and welled up with unshed tears. He’s no longer crying, just whimpering in the way he does when he wants to be held, to be cradled — he’d started it when they first tried him on solid foods, teething at mashed bananas then pouting to be picked up, wrapped up in someone else’s warmth. It’s not like Dean can do much else aside from what he’s already doing.
A decade of lost time, building up to this; years of maybe’s and almost’s. And now, with the rough slide of Cas’ lips against his own, he can confidently say with all his heart, that it was worth every second.
He’s caught off guard when Dean hooks a leg around the back of his knees, tugs, and then he’s falling. His knees take the most of it, landing on the edge of the mattress with his arms either side of Dean’s head. He still has some advantage, not that it matters.
“One of my favourite parts.” Cas agrees, putting inches between their chests so he can really look. He’s got this way of seeing through the bullshit, focusing on Dean’s core and somehow knowing what he wants. What he needs. It could be down to the bond but, really, in their time as friends, boyfriends, partners, Cas has proven himself to be nothing if not intuitive. He pulls himself away, far enough to strip out of his suit but close enough that Dean can still feel his warmth. There’s a wet stain on his thigh; black against prussian blue. “How do you want this?”
“You might wanna run this by Castiel first, though. Spontaneity can be romantic and all but things can get a little intense and— yeah, I don’t have to explain this to you. Just mention it over dinner or something.”
. That can wait until he’s home alone, tucked into his own bed, with his own Netflix account and not out in the middle of nowhere, looking like a fool with a key for a single room at a shady motel whose clientele range from escorts to serial killers, probably.
— but I want you to know that you don’t have to be. I just— sometimes I think you don’t want it because I see you almost get caught up in yourself just when kissing and touching starts getting a little heavier but then you seem to be definitely okay with the sex itself it’s— if I’m not making sense or I’m jumping to conclusions you can just tell me to shut up, okay? I want you to know that when I’m kissing you and I’m touching you and I’ve got my hand in your boxers, Castiel, I am 100% down for whatever you wanna do to me. I mean, if it’s just a pre-sex nerves thing, that’s ok! We can talk it out. I mean, Sam recommended a spell we could try that acts as an aphrodisiac but I don’t want to resort to magic if this is something we can work on with words… if it’s something you want to talk about, that is.
Palm flat against hard muscle, he pushes. A testament to their bond, strong hands bracket his waist and, in one swift movement, Dean is face down on the mattress. Breathless, needy. In a deliberate attempt to please his Alpha, he lifts his hips, shifting his knees up the bed to hold his ass in the air. Present and willing.
He hums, releasing Cas’s wrist with gentle consideration. It hangs there for a second as Cas weighs up his options in silence. Does he take it back? Does he need permission? He lets it fall to his side, trying not to focus on the way his skin prickles where Dean’s fingers were. It’s quite pleasant.
“Make you feel any better if it was?” It comes out as almost a whisper, not that it matters because they’re sat so close, but he’s not looking at Cas. He’s looking at his lips, eyes fixed on something Cas can’t see. Cas responds by wetting them, tongue swiping across the bottom, tasting the sweet and ashy spice and when Dean follows the movements, he knows.
The first seal was broken. Dean, whose very essence shone fierce enough to elicit envy from even the brightest of stars, whose body—battered and broken—had yielded so easily to Castiel’s care, who knew just what he’d done in hell and refused to burden his brother with that knowledge, had succumbed. Dean had broken.
“Benny skimping on his rolls?” He eyes the anaemic blunt incredulously before taking it anyway, letting the weight of it hit his throat and settle deep in his chest before letting it all flow out on the exhale, dragging his worries out with the smoke.
Cas probably should've asked for permission before diving in for a kiss as he does. Two steps forward and clutching at leather, tasting bourbon on Dean's lips—burn and salt and a spike of something else. A hand grips at the back of his neck, while another winds around his waist, holding him close and Cas can't imagine ever saying no to this. He's never kissed like this. He's never been kissed like this.
Honestly, death is preferable to the inevitable embarrassment of being stood at the intersection of two dirt roads, disappointed, with nothing to show for it other than the mud under his nails.
Cas smirks, close enough that Dean can feel the curve in his lips almost against his cheek. “He thinks it’s because this is the first since the wedding and said to keep an eye on it. We might have to check into the clinic if it doesn’t break soon.”
“I made a mistake.” It doesn't hurt to admit but it kinda stings to see Dean sigh, visibly deflated.
“Yeah man, you were completely knocked out.” Sam, always Sam, pours him another cup of coffee. It’s bitter and scalding but Dean can’t feel his tongue anyway. Different parts of him feel numb. All he can think of is the dark. His coffee is black. “Jack’s fine but you shouldn’t sleep with him on your chest like that. If you roll over—”
Dean reaches a hand down, shoving suit slacks and boxers aside in his search for Cas, thick and warm beneath his palm. He twitches at the touch as he's guided, head wet and blunt and every inch of it does nothing to assuage the burn Dean can't help but fuel whenever they get like this. "That's not your call, sweetheart."
Jo wipes away her tears first and makes her way over to Crowley who had, in fact, snuck off to make them all coffee while Dean was dealing with damage control. She picks up three mugs—his, Charlie’s and her own—and hands them out in that order. He doesn’t miss how she throws her free arm around the redhead’s shoulder, tugging her in close. “Maybe not,” She starts, smirking again. “But I will.”
—” Jo places a palm on Charlie’s arm. Wordless but supportive. “Sorry. Anyway, he said some choice things to say about my girl Shallan Davar and I’m not going to take that kind of slander here, Dean. I’m not.”
, if I’m ever touching you in any no-no zones or when you’re not in the mood, you gotta tell me. I’ll stop, we can just watch TV or curl up or— shit, I’ll give you a foot rub after a long day if that’s what you need.”
It takes a second for him to catch his breath once he’s fully seated, wrapped in such an all-encompassing heat that it’s almost too much. His fingertips grip at Dean’s flesh, promising bruises in their wake. A trail of breadcrumbs to find his way back.
"Babe," Dean sighs, pulling his boyfriend up by the point of his chin, stubbled and spit slick. "Shut the fuck up."
“Fucked yourself all day and you’re still this tight?” It’s said into his neck, around puncture wounds and re-split skin and Dean wishes he could see the blood in Cas’ teeth, taste it on his tongue. Thinking much further than the immediate—Cas within him, around him, focused solely on him—is impossible. He rocks back into it, letting words sink in, spur on his hips and arch his back. “You’re beautiful like this. For me.”
Dean doesn't push to take more than he's given which is, quite frankly, unexpected. It's not discouraging, though. He lets Cas control how far it goes, how fast they advance, and Cas can't help but be surprised at the moan he catches with his mouth when he lets his tongue into the mix. It's frightening how easily he could get used to this and yet he can't bring himself to stop. He doesn't want to stop.
It’s soft, gentle, and brief but it’s perfect. He doesn’t want to ask for too much, to take and take and take but
Throwing his arm back around Cas’s neck proves more effort than it’s worth but holding him close like this, fingernails piercing the soft flesh of his neck for that burst of ozone and
Whoever said college life would be fun definitely wasn’t in any of Chuck Shurley’s theology classes. He sighs, shuts his laptop, lets his head hit the desk with a soft thud and contemplates the pros and cons of dropping out.
Dean hums in agreement, already aware of that part from Cas's earlier outburst. “And you wanted them gone.”
He tries and tries but the tortured cacophony echoes on long after Castiel ceased his song. Dean’s face scrunches up into a grimace, struggling to stand upright past the ringing in his ears that throws his balance.
“No! No, not gone." The thought of this being just snapping his fingers and doing away with Raphael forever— it's not even tempting. It just feels wrong. He doesn't wish death for Raphael, he never had. He just— "I just wanted to forget.”
By the time there’s a hole big enough for the box, moonlight is the only thing that illuminates the place. The neon vacancy sign at the motel’s roadside had long since flickered out. It’s serene darkness and yet, Cas can’t bring himself to enjoy it. If he wanted to stare up at the sky all night, he would’ve gone to visit Jack, surrounded by snowdrifts as cold as he feels. Escaped his problems by simply leaving them behind.
And yet, each time, his human charge would wince away from the noise, palms clamped over his ears, screaming in agony.
Dean isn’t in control of his mouth—hell, he’s barely in control of his own body—but he’s in control of this. His elbows give out and his face hits the bed, clutching at sheets drenched in his own sweat and slick and come. “
"You're wearing too many clothes." With a flick of his wrist, Cas' tie unravels itself, drags its silk blend to the floor without so much as a whisper. Rowena would scold him for using his magic for convenience instead of change if she saw. Then again, she's never seen the hunger that crosses Cas' features when Dean uses his power to tug at his zipper. And hey, knowing her, she's probably done worse with Sam. Definitely not the time to be thinking about that.
Sam, used to this shit by now, rolls his eyes. Dean doesn’t have to see him to know that. He just knows. Call it intuition. Call it living together for almost twenty-two years. “Premonition?”
The smile Cas gives him, all crows feet and laughter lines and happiness, lodges into place with the rest of them. Kept tight just behind his ribs, tucked next to his heart. Dean holds onto each one, worn like the dog-eared pages of a well loved book or the softened edges of a photograph, folded in four and tucked into soft leather.
“Huh.” Confusion crosses the face of the nameless man-being-thing followed by a pause. He blinks, slowly, almost to himself and smiles. “I guess you can call me Dean. Dean Winchester.”
’. The normal stuff people will sell their soul for. I don’t think I’ve ever been asked my name before. You don’t seem like my usual bag.”
— eyes give him the once over, again. There’s a little furrow between his brow and it’s such a human expression. It’s… comforting? No, that’s not it. Cas wants to reach out and touch it, for some reason. Yeah, probably better not to dwell on that.
He’d whispered, between hot kisses to Dean’s throat. When the threat of teeth and bites sent electricity through his veins. Even now, he can’t find any shame in asking for what he needs. Castiel takes his sweet time undressing and Dean watches as his cock slaps fat and heavy against his belly.
Cas blinked his eyes open slowly. Stars twinkled above him. A cold breeze blew over his skin. Grass poked into his back.
“Winchester… the hippie-looking guy at the hospital?” Her head hurt too much to be thinking this hard. How the hell was she getting out of this?
Cas stepped toward Dean slowly, as though he weren’t sure if he were welcome back. Somewhere inside him, a levee broke. Tears suddenly welling in his eyes, he rushed forward and wrapped the angel in a hug that would have cracked his ribs if he were an ordinary human. He felt Cas sag against him as he wrapped his arms around the hunter in return. “Welcome home, pal.” He didn’t want to let him go. But he needed to get him home. Back to Sam. And Jack. He backed up, discreetly wiping away the tears that had dripped down his cheeks.
“What, have you got a giant underground bunker to keep them in?” the boy at the register bantered, starting to scan the items.
“We will handle it,” Jody replied firmly. She attempted a smile. “Come on. You guys take care of the world. We’ve got Sioux Falls covered.”
Dean frowned. “But iron isn’t a permanent fix, it just makes them disappear for a few seconds. She’d come right back after we hit her.”
Dean pushed himself to his feet, clutching his angel blade. He looked around. No, this definitely wasn’t Purgatory. And it sure as hell wasn’t Apocalypse World.
“She’s not what we want,” the woman replied, eyeing the child with an almost hungry expression. “The child should be among his own kind.”
“Lil’ Asmodeus,” Lucifer shot back, “My onetime stooge, runt of the litter.” Cas silently wished that Lucifer would shut up. “Dimmest bulb in the string, et cetera, et cetera. I see you must’ve taken Crowley’s spot? Yeah. That’s okay, you can stand down now.” He cleared his throat, and Cas was alarmed to hear the fear in his tone. “Skipper’s back.”
“Alright. You guys pray to me when you need liftoff,” Gabriel said, glancing nervously at a barred door to the side of the room before disappearing.
“Run!” he cried. Shaggy and Scooby were moving their legs frantically without moving, so he scooped them up and continued to sprint towards the sitting room. He lept over the iron chain tripwire, and the ghost barreled right into it, shrieking as it burned its form. The tripwire triggered an ax that cut a rope that caused a dozen coconuts to drop onto the phantom (how Fred had gotten ahold of coconuts, Cas didn’t want to know). Unfortunately, the coconuts dropped right through the phantom, rolling beneath Cas’ feet. He slipped, dropping Shaggy and Scooby and skidding down the soap slide (what kind of trap was this?). They skidded and were finally tossed into a washing machine reinforced with iron chains (how the three of them fit into a washing machine was beyond Cas’ comprehension).
“Your brother said you lost someone else, too.” Dean’s heart dropped to his stomach. Cas’ scorched wings flashed across his mind.
Amara explained. “Billie has agreed to disregard the resurrections prior to this moment. So Dean, and Sam, and all your rule-bending friends are safe.” She paused. “As will you, should you choose to take up my offer.”
With one final click, he opened the file. He knew that the infant in his arms would not understand anything in the video, but he figured it would be nice if the kid could hear his mom’s voice, even if it was only a recording. The screen filled up with Kelly’s smiling face, and Sam felt a pang of guilt over her death.
“Really, Sam?” the woman in orange said in a very condescending manner. “I wouldn’t expect such a big, broad-shouldered fella like you to be as chicken as Shaggy.” She placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder, which Cas supposed was rather broad. “No offense, Shaggy.”
Dean frowned. “Okay, first of all, when did you hide that in there? And second, what the hell kind of spell was it?”
“J-Jack. Jack Kline.” In a brief moment of clarity, he figured it would be safer not to use the name Winchester. “He turned six months old a few days ago.”
At first, everything was great. Rowena had enchanted Jack’s favorite stuffed dog to act like a real puppy, and was watching him crawl around after it with a soft smile on her face. Gabriel had run off to the grocery store, probably to stock up on candy and sugar cereals again. Sam kept an eye on the portal, waiting for his brother and best friend to return.
“I’ll go with you,” Dean said. No way he was letting Cas go alone. Not if he was going to get himself as badly injured as he did with Lucifer. The dude wouldn’t admit it, but he was low on angel mojo, and he needed the backup.
“She…” Cas hated to remember this, but he supposed that Dean should know. “She made me kill you. Fake versions of you. Hundreds, maybe a thousand, I don’t know. Not to mention the lobotomies.” He glanced over at Dean, whose face had gone red with rage. He could almost imagine that the black demon eyes were back.
Mary returned after a few minutes with the gaggle of ten children trailing after her. A few of them were wearing the shirts and sweaters Dean had bought earlier that day.
“Here,” Sam said, taking the bottle. Cas hadn’t heard him enter the room. “You gotta warm it up.” He stuck the bottle in the microwave, and they waited impatiently for the bottle to heat up. Cas watched as Sam tested the temperature by squirting a few drops onto the inside of his wrist, then handed it to Cas.
A dark figure was reaching for the door handles, lightning and thunder crashing behind it. Sam and Dean rushed to either side of the entrance, ready to take down whatever it was. The figure opened the door and stepped inside.
Meanwhile, Cas was not, in fact, on Earth. Jack had not called him away, though he knew Dean would likely assume that was the case. He stood outside the two-story house by the lake, occupied by John and Mary Winchester. He watched, invisible to the couple inside, as John walked out the back door, his hands resting in his pockets. Dean’s father stood there for a while, staring out over the sparkling lake, happy and at peace. Cas wanted to smite him, but that would only anger Dean, and Dean did not need to suffer any more. But John did.
“Give us a second,” Dean said, pushing away from the table. Sam followed him a few yards away. “Hey, you wanna pull that stick out of your…” he paused, “nether regions and just play along here?”
Sam felt a nudge at his shoulder, and accepted the beer that Dean offered him. Jack was in the nursery for a nap. Sam pretended he hadn’t just heard Dean cooing to him through the baby monitor.
“Hopefully he doesn’t get taken out by a rusty nail,” John quipped. Cas’ head snapped up, and John flinched, although Dean didn’t seem to notice as he examined the label on his beer.
Kaia was dead. She had promised to protect her, and she was dead. She had died in the very place she feared. Died to save Claire.
“It’s my favorite suit,” the ghoul replied, licking his lips hungrily. “You know, I like to keep a little piece of old Dave on me just to gnaw on.” Dean grimaced.
Dean woke tied to a tree. His knees ached; somehow he’d been stood upright. He looked around, and saw Sam to his right, still unconscious.
“Because,” Sam said loudly, “we both agreed to give it a shot, right?” Dean smiled tersely in return. “My brother, he’s not processing his grief.”
The Light huffed, like the children on the playground beyond these trees when they didn’t get their way. “It’s boring.”
Not wanting to waste another moment, Sam and Eileen followed Rowena downstairs. Ingredients were laid out on a countertop alongside a piece of thick yellowed paper.
“Oil of Abramelin, angelica root, a bunch of stuff we already have… oh, and the hearts of Gog and Magog?”
Dean seemed not to notice his change in tone. “Yeah, well, not like the Empty can come to this plane.”
The bare truth of it shocked Sam to his core. He couldn’t bring himself to say anything in response.
Cas glanced at him, then back at Jack. “I’m afraid I’m not much of a singer,” he apologized to the baby.
“Yeah.” She turned back to the pink liquid, and began to put her mask back on. “Look, if you want to check out the grave, the cops have it roped off, over on the west plot.”
Dean raised his eyebrows suggestively, but decided not to make any crude jokes in front of the kids at the table. Sam glared, but didn’t respond. He left the kitchen.
He must have made a noise, because Lucifer snapped his head around, grinning a plaguish smile. He held out a clawed hand, and Sam found himself being dragged toward his tormentor.
A shock went through Cas’ vessel. Mary? Mary was still alive? Still alive, but being tortured by Michael himself? Cas wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or dismayed.
The Empty dropped him back to the ground. “Come on, Castiel! Wouldn’t you rather be a fond memory than a constant, festering disappointment?” Cas yelled as the Empty planted a rough kick into his gut. He wanted to get up and fight, but instead he lay still. “Let’s just lay down. Let’s just try and sleep.” The Empty stroked his back, as if he were a toddler trying to stay up past his bedtime. It made Cas’ skin crawl. “Think about it. Infinite peace, yes? No regrets. No pain. Kiddo, save yourself.”
“Dean, I… I’m sorry,” tears began to fall from Cas’ eyes. Dean wouldn’t send him away again, would he?
“Asmodeus had my phone.” Cas’ eyes were closed, but Dean could tell that he wasn’t going to fall asleep anytime soon, not with that gash in his side.
“Could be a ghost, or maybe a revanant,” Sam offered. It didn’t seem likely, but who knew what went on behind these suburban facades?
Hunters were no good with babies. Well, Dean hadn't been so bad with that shifter baby, Bobby John. But Jack was set to become more powerful than an archangel. This was a whole new ball game.
“And Donatello’s already corrupted,” Cas added. Though he hated to suggest it, he felt he had to. “Perhaps the kindest thing to do would be to end his suffering.”
Castiel scoffed, and circled around Cas, sizing him up. “So the Righteous Man, the Michael Sword, came to be in your world.”
“‘Code three…’” he mumbled, “Okay, so that means an officer down.” Dean walked through the saloon doors, his face blank with sleep, and trudged to the coffee machine. He hummed happily when he saw that Cas had already brewed the coffee.
The apocalyptic Castiel snarled and made to charge at Cas, but before he could, there was the sound of a loud gunshot. Castiel jerked backwards, a bullet hole torn through the chest of his trench coat. The hesitation was enough that Cas could find an opening in his other self’s defense, and he stabbed his counterpart in the heart. He watched the eyes flare out, then dropped his corpse to the ground.
Dean sighed and stood, and made his way to the library to find something to do. Sam and Eileen, though they mostly stayed in the bunker these days, had gone off on a case, tracking down some spell books before they fell into the wrong hands. Sam was doing all sorts of witchy stuff these days, and though he would never say it out loud, he was dreadfully proud of his little brother.
Sam groaned, and sat up. He looked around, freezing when his eyes met Eileen’s. He lunged forward and wrapped his arms around her, drinking in the scent of the shampoo in her hair. She pressed her lips to the skin just above his shirt collar. He pulled back to sign to her.
“Yes,” replied Cas. He tried to form a plan, but it had been so long since he’d fought another angelic soldier. How had he forgotten how to fight? Angels were not supposed to forget.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Dean snapped, rushing over and pushing Cas back down by his bare shoulders. His fingertips tingled at the touch. Probably from the angel’s grace. “Cas, you gotta lay back, man, you’re really hurt.” He was also probably cold, what with his torso bare and bloody, but at the moment Dean was more concerned that he would pop his stitches.
Somehow, that seemed to put their father in his place, but Sam noticed that he glanced warily at Jack before moving on. He fixed his attention to the people sitting around the table. “Who are you?”
Dean grimaced. “Called in a favor from a witch and an archangel.” When Mary’s face morphed from concern to confusion, Dean frowned. “We had to get you back, Mom.”
“Hey! Baby ears!” Gabriel shot back defensively, laying his hand protectively on Jack’s head. Dean scowled at him as he picked Jack up and carried him out of the room. Let Sam deal with him.
“All right, you wait here,” Dean said, “I’m-a flush him out.” He figured that if he could get the Sarge a good shot, he could take care of the ghoul just fine, without instigating the whole ‘by the way, monsters are real’ conversation. He crept forward, but stopped when he heard rumbling beneath him. Before he could react, the Sarge yelled, and fell straight down into the ground.
“Fight? No.” How could she make Claire understand? Sure, the girl had taken on one, but she’d be no match for a pack of them. “I run.”
He paused again before continuing. His end of the deal was the crappy end, but this was Billie. There was no point in bargaining with her. “How do I know I can trust you?”
Before the brothers could do anything, the blond man lept toward the phantom, yelling. The phantom screeched as the man passed through it and fell to the floor. It swung its arms around, chains rattling and claws scratching into the wallpaper, before turning and disappearing through a wall.
“All we want is to be able to save Mary from the Apocalypse World,” Cas explained calmly, his heart pounding in his throat. “We don’t have anyone else to turn to, Gabriel.”
Definitely a demon, because he lifted himself against Dean’s armbar with superhuman strength, and drove his fist into Dean’s side, knocking him away. Dean stumbled, trying to regain his senses, and the demon punched him in the face, once, twice, then slammed him into the dresser. Dean quickly took stock of his situation as the demon swung him onto the table, adrenaline finally kicking in, and swung his legs up to block the demon’s arm as it swung downward in an attempt to stab Dean. To his surprise, the demon lifted him off the table, and Dean managed to slam his elbow into the thing’s skull before it flung him onto the bed (at least it wasn’t the floor). Dean rolled away, prepared to continue fighting the demon, but the demons eyes suddenly sparked and flamed orange. It dropped to the ground, revealing Sam with an angel blade.
“No,” Sam agreed, shaking away his thoughts, “but we do have the demon tablet.” He unwrapped the ancient stone sitting in the center of the table. Cas sank into a chair next to Dean, and turned Jack around so he could watch the events unfolding on the table in front of him.
Trying not to wake Jack, he quietly opened the door of the rental car and pulled out the folded stroller from the floor of the back seat. He unfolded it, unbuckled Jack’s car seat, and transferred it to the stroller. He hoped that no one would pay too much attention to the fed at a crime scene with an infant in tow.
Kaia looked up, and their eyes met. She felt a shock go down her spine. The mug shots didn’t do Kaia justice; yes, she had the shoulder-length dark hair and the brown eyes, but the photos didn’t capture the wise, knowing, almost otherworldly look in her eyes.
“Oh, yes, excellent question,” the thing answered, as though he were a teacher praising an inquisitive student, “You see, before God and Amara, creation, destruction, Heaven, Hell, your precious little Earth, what was there?” He looked at Cas expectantly.
“No no no no,” it chided. “Not with me, and I’m the only one that has any pull here.” It grinned maniacally. “Not Heaven, not Hell, not G–O–D himself. So, think harder. Rack that
“Kaia, please,” Sam said, “Just once. Just so we can get our mom. Please.” The other brother had begun to pace, and kicked at the tires of his car.
“Dude,” Sam scolded, well aware of how much of a mother hen Dean must think him to be right now, “you were hallucinating sheep on the road. We need a few hours.” Jack hiccuped and coughed as they entered the room, and Dean set his carrier down on the couch while he examined the cleanliness of the room. “Let’s ward the room, get a bite, get a few hours of sleep, hit the road first thing.”
Cas continued. “But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being. It's in just saying it.”
He turned back to Dean, a hard look on his face. “An eternity in Heaven’s prison should do her some good,” he said, his face unreadable.
“Hey, we’ve outrun cosmic consequences before,” Dean interjected, “and as cautious as I usually am with the whole defying the natural order thing, I’m really not planning on looking a gift horse in the mouth this time around.”
“I’m sorry,” he said mercilessly, “but I’m not going to let you or anyone hurt the people that I love.” He tightened his grip on the mouth destined to spout the word of God. “Not again.”
Cas smiled to himself. If nothing else, he felt some satisfaction at being able to get under the devil’s skin.
“Amara, too. She’s in here with me.” He chuckled. “She’s not too happy about it, but she really should have thought it through before agreeing to ‘become one again.’”
Rowena set her jaw. “Well, if anyone can make it back from the dead, it’s that stubborn little angel.”
Fear raced down Dean’s spine. God, it had been forever since John had used that voice with him. “It wasn’t a deal. It was a gift.”
“Angel blades don’t cause allergic reactions,” Charlie replied, advancing on Cas. Dean stepped in between them.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “Okay, so when Lucifer stabbed me, it may or may not have actually killed me. I tricked him. Duh.”
Sarah bit her lip, frowning. “Well… I’m not certain I believe you, no offense, but if it’ll make Mariana feel any better, then I might as well.” She gestured for them to follow her to the table, and set down the drinks.
“Well, I’m sorry that I didn’t teach you well enough to protect yourself.” His words were quiet and laced with venom.
“If you go,” Kaia said, her eyes also flicking momentarily downward, “I’ll go with you.” Claire’s stomach erupted with butterflies. “Maybe together, we can save them.” She wanted to kiss her, but now was not the time. Now was the time to fight.
They came to a field where Donatello (but not Donatello, the real Donatello was in the back seat) was holding an infant Jack high in the air, Lion King style. The fake Donatello was chanting as Jack cried, his eyes glowing yellow. Sam was shocked to see waves of power, like the heat waves above asphalt in the summertime, emanating from the infant in the bumble bee onesie.
“I’m so sorry,” she choked out, digging her bloodstained fingers into the grass and dirt. “I k-keep failing you. I just keep f-f-failing you.”
“I hope not. But I’m prepared for that possibility.” Dean hoped to everything that Jack would turn out good, but this… this was not a good sign. If he could blow out light bulbs as a newborn, what could he do during a temper tantrum as a toddler? What would happen when he was fully grown?
Sam sighed and turned back to Dean and Cas, away from the woman in orange, who looked at the red headed woman and giggled. “If this is a real ghost, these guys are in trouble,” he said quietly, so that the others could not overhear him. “We can’t let anything happen to them.”
“Donatello,” Sam said, breaking the tension, “whatever it is you’re feeling, whatever it is you’re going through, you can fight this.”
“Okay, well, is there anything we can get you?” Sam offered. He knew it would be miserable for poor Donatello, but they needed that spell.
“Come on,” Dean urged, unfazed. How many times before had he crept through dark graveyards in search of monsters that wanted him dead? He’d lost count, but it was a lot.
“Dean.” He couldn’t possibly understand. No one else could. Except for Rowena. She’d seen his face. She understood.
Sam looked like he wanted to argue, but instead swallowed his words and handed Rowena the spellbook with the proper incantation.
A band of about a dozen children huddled around his mother and a few other strange adults, who were quickly herding them out of the room as Dean and Lucifer battled hand to hand. Cas was kneeling over Rowena, who had somehow ended up on the floor, a large gash above her eye.
“More of the same,” Sam conceded, “he was really into the whole catharsis thing.” Before he could continue, Jack gurgled, letting the two of them know that he was finally awake. “Hi, Jack,” Sam said softly, turning in the seat.
“Yeah,” she gasped. “He, um, he tried to stab me with that.” She pointed at a bonelike spike on the floor, dripping with blood. The wraith’s claw.
Jody knew it was beyond hope, but she hoped that it didn’t have anything to do with Sam and Dean not answering their phones.
“Dude, I felt you shivering,” Dean scolded, leaning over and picking up a flannel from the floor next to the bed. He pressed it into Cas’ hands.
“Didn’t make it.” He hadn’t known Kelly well, but he still felt sorry for her, and guilty for not being able to save her.
There was a Gas-n-Sip ahead, and he took the opportunity to fill the Impala’s tank and escape the conversation. Jody took the hint, and grabbed the nozzle, nodding to Dean to go inside and pay.
This was already making Dean’s head spin. “Okay, so we’re supposed to find these guys and cut out their hearts? How?”
“Neither do I.” Dean glanced at Sam, who was typing something into his computer. “Sam, you got a case?”
“Figured we could all use a breather.” Jody adjusted Jack on her hip. He was surprisingly quiet. Kaia had explained how the kid had been suffering a fever, and his distress had caused the portal to open. But the kid was fine now, and he seemed entirely normal. She wished the Winchesters had introduced her to him before now. He was a cute kid. “And I called in some backup.”
“Hello, boys,” Rowena drawled lazily. Though she tried to hold herself with intimidating ease, Sam could see the tension and fear underneath.
Cas didn’t want to admit that he needed Lucifer more than he could know about. Yes, he supposed he would need Lucifer for the Michael problem, should that come to pass, but he also needed him to heal Jack.
“Um, we’re just… going to go. I, uh. Promised Michael I’d show him my hometown before we head up to Heaven.”
“What did you do to me?” he asked the Empty, trying to sound angry and intimidating, a true warrior of Heaven, but failing miserably.
“Right, because this is so easy for you, huh?” Sam said, turning to Dean with his voice raised. Jack whimpered quietly against Dean’s chest.
Dean was about to explain further, but someone else’s groaning reached him from across the room. He turned to see the Sarge writhing on the floor by one of the lab tables.
Dean didn’t want to think about what was going on over in Apocalypse World. He patted Cas’ hand and stood.
“I….” Patience looked at Jody. “No. I’m not….” She scoffed. “I get deja vu sometimes, but that’s normal. I’m normal.” She reminded Dean of Sam when he was first dealing with his psychic episodes.
Sam raised his fists to rocheambeau. Dean rolled his eyes and raised his fists. Sam won when Dean played scissors, as always. He chuckled as Dean stood by the backseat, struggling with the straps on the carrier. He left Dean by the car and walked up to the witness, who was hosing down the plants in her garden.
Dean turned away from the laptop to help him. He laid one hand on Cas’ back while he fluffed the pillow. It sent shivers of electricity through him. Oddly enough, he physically shivered.
With a groan, Dean exited the car. He grabbed a cart, and began to make his way through aisle after aisle. He stopped in the snack aisle, trying to think of what kind of snacks Cas would like. In the end, he went with just some ordinary chips and salsa. One of these days, he’d take Cas shopping. In the produce aisle, he decided to be nice to Sam and get some real vegetables. Sauteed in bacon grease, he figured it probably wouldn’t taste too much like rabbit food.
The first two demons rushed at Cas. He twisted the arm of the nearest one, easily tearing the blade from its hand. In the same motion, he stabbed the other demon in the stomach. It screamed and fell to the ground as Cas whirled around and killed the second one. Gabriel watched him, nodding with approval.
“How’d you guess?” he replied, smirking. His heart pounded in his chest. He did not want to talk about that night. He would not.
Dean laughed. “I can teach you.” He leaned over to Jack, planting a kiss on the top of his head. “Goodnight, kiddo.” Jack glared the most adorable glare Dean had ever seen, then buried his face in Mary’s shoulder. It was comforting that she was still willing to be involved as part of Jack’s family.
Vaguely, she could hear some creature roaring, some enormous footsteps shaking the ground, but she could only crouch over Kaia’s body.
Dean swung at the girl, but she flickered out of existence and reappeared a few feet away… just behind Cas. Cas whirled around, but the girl raised a hand, shrieking again, and the iron pole flew out of Cas’ hands.
“Play–” Sam shoved the newspaper in front of his brother. “There are no words in this newspaper, Dean.” The mysterious music played again as he looked over it. That was going to get really old really fast. “We should be trying to get out of here, and instead, you’re hanging out with Marmaduke!”
“Fine.” A blade just like the one the man carried dropped from the woman’s sleeve as the other of Kaia’s kidnappers threw his head back, knocking the man away.
“Yeah, well, now we’ve got Jack to take care of,” Dean said, not wanting to dwell on the exact thing he’d wanted to not think about for the entire trip.
She clutched at her stomach, where the wound from the spear was mostly healed. The wound from the spear meant for Claire. Maybe one day she would be able to show it to her. She could only hope. She imagined the beautiful blonde-haired girl running her fingers gently over the scars, ones she had earned fighting instead of running.
“And we got prints back from the murder,” the Sarge added. “They matched prints from the bank. That boy’s been busy. I already checked out his place, it’s cleaned out, but I figure he ain’t goin’ nowhere without his best girl. So that’s why I’m here.” He paused. “Why are you here?”
Alex snatched the stack of papers from her desk and set them roughly in the stacking cubicle in which they belonged. “If she needs my help with anything– the dishes, monsters– I’m there. For her.” She wished Claire could see how selfish of her it had been to leave.
“No, I’m not. I’m sorry that I ever did.” Dean pulled back and stood up, wiping at his face and returning to the food on the stove. There was a slightly acrid smell in the air. The food must have been burnt. “Shit, I burned breakfast.”
“Hey, now, you have nothing to apologize for. You saved Jack. Just…” Dean paused, and Cas could almost see the dots connecting in his mind. “Breathe.”
Sam set his jaw. “So we track him down. Wait until he’s somewhere we can manage him. Gabriel drops us on his head, and we take him down.”
It was the exact place where she had lost Kaia. But there was no body, not a single bone or shred of clothing. Claire’s stomach rolled. Had one of those horrid blue-blooded monsters dragged her away to be eaten? Why hadn’t she taken Kaia’s body when she went through the portal? Then she could have given her a proper funeral, burned her and put her at peace.
“This is Jack,” Jody replied. Jack cooed at the mention of his name. “He’s the Winchesters’ kid. Half angel.”
Sam just nodded. Would Jack respond the same to baby aspirin? He was part archangel, after all. Dean started the engine, and they raced back to the motel, the radio squealing due to Jack’s distressed energy.
Cas gave him a soft kiss on the cheek, his eyes already drooping. Then he curled up in the front seat with his head on Dean’s thigh and his legs sticking out into the footwell. It didn’t look comfortable, but who was Dean to police Cas’ napping habits?
Cas looked up at Dean. Dean didn’t look away. Cas did. He needed to say something about the elephant in the room.
“So you died to become Death?” Dean asked. His brain could not have come up with this. But it couldn’t be real.
She fell to the ground, her legs too weak to hold her upright. She felt Jody take her into her arms and card her hands through her hair. All she could do was sob, burying her face into Jody’s chest.
“Yeah, we do.” There was no possible way that Lucifer hadn’t killed her the instant they landed in that other world. No possible way. He wanted to have faith in her, but he had none left. The only being he’d ever prayed to with any sort of hope was lying dead on the pyre in front of him. “We do, Sam. Lucifer killed her the moment he realized we trapped his ass.” Saying it was agony. But he knew it was the truth. “He killed her, you know he did.” He bowed his head, trying to will away the tears that were starting to clog his throat. “She’s gone. They’re all gone.”
Either way, Jody climbed up into the passenger seat of Donna’s truck, and they drove to the shipyard. Donna parked a good distance away, with a good view to scout the place out. She was a good sheriff, Jody knew that for sure.
Cas’ eyes snapped open. He hadn’t even realized they’d been drooping. Yes, he had regrets, but his being awake was a chance to escape, to remedy his mistakes. He had to take it. He lifted his head, and looked up at the Empty, at his own face. If he was awake, then he could fight his way out.
“Dude,” Dean said, grabbing Sam by the lapels of his jacket, “this is not the way things went down in the episode.” He shook his head vigorously. “I remember everything that happened in Scooby-Doo, and no one ever got stabbed in the back and ended up in a pool of their own blood.”
“Ignire!” Rowena cried, purple flame erupting around the doll as the blade flew into her chest. Lucifer roared as purple flames engulfed him, the sound echoing off of the walls at a deafening decibel. Blood flowed down Rowena’s dress in crimson rivulets as she wrenched the blade from her breast. She glanced to the ceiling briefly before driving it through the doll’s chest.
“Then I guess we have to make up some way to defeat her,” said Dean. He looked over at Cas for ideas, but the angel (ex-angel) was lost in thought, staring at the mountains out the window. “Cas, you with us?”
“It is said that the little girl shrieked and screamed for days after the town left, before dying in the mineshaft. The screaming was so horrible that the marmots in the pass echoed her screams, and still do to this day.”
“I didn’t have any near death experiences, if that’s what you’re asking,” Dean replied defensively. “She busted into my head while I was asleep. Wanted to know about the portal. She said that Sam and I were important, that we have work to do.”
“We’ll take him with us,” Dean declared. “Might as well get the kid out of the bunker for a bit. Besides, it’s not so far of a drive.”
Dean ran back to the hole, cursing, and aimed his flashlight down into it. He needed to go after the Sarge. He laid down next to the hole, but the thought of following the ghoul into the ground made his stomach churn. With a groan of exasperation and fear, he pushed himself head first into the hole. He crawled through the tight dirt tunnel, grimacing as roots brushed across his face.
Without lifting so much as a finger, Billie changed the setting of the dream– or was it a dream anymore? Dean found himself in a library, so large he couldn’t see where the ‘W’ section ended on either side of them.
“Yeah, well, what does these days?” Dean paused to pick up the salt canister with one hand and shake salt onto the body. He hoped the movement wouldn’t wake Jack. “I mean, we’ve got portals to apocalyptic worlds, we’ve got shape-shifting demons. Dealing with a whole new set of tiddlywinks. I say we just do what we do.” He sighed while Sam tossed a pack of matches into the grave. He watched the flames lick up against the dirt, trying not to let his mind wander back to the pyre by the lake in Washington.
The girl smiled weakly at them. “Oh, hey guys.” She glanced nervously back at a table where two girls sat, another taller blonde and a girl with curly black hair. The blonde girl had her head in her hands, and the black-haired girl was rubbing her back comfortingly.
“It happened every time, Jody!” Now that they were finally having this argument, Claire decided it was time to let loose. “You’ve never even seen what I can do.”
Dean sighed, and looked down at the trench coat. He could not bring himself to look at Cas’ face. “I don’t have faith in this kid,” he whispered. Prayed. “But I have… I had faith in you. So I… I’ll try.”
“I could use a breath of fresh air,” Dean said, hoisting Jack up to carry him and pushing himself off the floor. “Maybe you can help Sam with his research.” He grabbed a few toy cars to keep the kid busy in the library, and carried him out of the room.
Ignoring the slight tug at his heartstrings to hear Dean refer to Jack as their collective kid, Sam rolled his eyes. “If Rowena wanted to hurt Jack, she would have during that last case we worked with her. Besides, Cas and Gabriel would smite her before she could even think about trying.”
Cas was unsure of how to respond to the commentary, and so just took the kid’s hand. “Uh, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Donatello inhaled deeply. “Yes,” he said, a philosophic tone in his voice, “that is the question we all must ask.”
“Yes, that’s bad,” Cas shot back, “Theoretically, the human soul would act as a filter, inoculating the prophet against whatever darkness is in the tablet.”
“Well, can you blame him?” Dr. Vallens replied. He thought of how Sam had stormed out of the room after their conversation about Mom. He pressed his lips together and pulled his phone out of his pocket.
Well. Kaia had a cousin in South Dakota. She hadn’t spoken to him in years, but if she could catch a ride, get a place to stay….
“Oh, save it,” the Empty groaned. It stepped toward Cas. “I have tiptoed through all your little tulips.” It crouched in front of Cas. “Your memories, your little feelings, yes. I know what you hate.” Its voice dropped to a whisper. “I know who you love.” Cas thought of Dean momentarily, but pushed the thought away quickly. “I know what you fear. There is nothing for you back there.” Cas looked up at his own face, remembering the fight that he and Dean were in the middle of when he died. Did Dean even miss him, after all of that? “No. Here,” the Empty smiled mirthlessly, “let me show you.” It grabbed Cas by his temples, and even more memories came rushing back.
Sam finally managed to pull Dean to his feet. His brother wobbled, but let himself be led to the library. He slumped into a chair, and returned to his unresponsive state.
Mary cleared her throat. “Dean, do you mind if I commandeer the kitchen? I need to make breakfast for the kids.”
Slowly and carefully, he scrambled down to the heavy metal door. He tried the handle. It was locked.
“She does,” Claire said, gesturing to Kaia. The girl lurked in the doorway, although Patience couldn’t tell if she was more afraid of the horrific corpse or the motley crew of hunters.
“That sounds like a swell idea!” Fred said cheerily. “In fact, I think it’s high time we hit the road.”
Adam’s eyes flashed. “Yes,” Michael said. “Rowena and I agree that Heaven and Hell need to work together as a system again. But Adam and I want a vacation first.”
“But if she’s right,” Sam continued, “if she does see Lucifer again, then… I hope she makes him suffer.” He shuddered to think that Lucifer would ever return to Earth.
“Ah, yes.” Naomi took a step toward Dean, but he didn’t balk. “How I’d love to see you dead on the floor for the, mmmm, six hundred and twenty-fourth time.”
Donatello scoffed. “Friends? I see how you, both of you, look at me.” He glanced between Sam and Dean as he spoke. “Covetous. Well… God didn’t choose you for this part, Dean. He chose me.”
One of the men, with long blond hair, began speaking to them in some foreign tongue, raising a fist in… greeting? Threat? Dean wasn’t quite sure.
“Sam went to Hell to take on Lucifer.” Mary’s eyes widened in shock, but Dean continued before she could respond. “I need you to get the kids out of here. Cas and Jack too.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, not really wanting to dwell on that hellscape. “I’ll just say, it’s not Candy Land.”
“John?” She felt like the breath had been knocked out of her. How could he do this? This was his grandson. This was an innocent child. He was wailing in the crib behind her.
In an instant he was awake and standing next to the bed. Before he could call out to Sam, though, he saw his brother holding the kid, feeding him from a bottle. Every muscle in his body relaxed, but his heart rate would not slow down.
“What Buddy did was my fault,” Dr. Vallens replied solemnly. “I should’ve….” She shook her head. “You guys can go. I’ll take care of him.” Sam nodded at her, and she sighed. “You know, I just… I just wanted to help people.”
“You had something with her I never had,” Sam continued, “and now I’m just supposed to accept that I never will have it?”
“Yeah,” Sam said, unsure. “But then what? Once it’s gone, no EMF?” He mulled it over for a moment. “Okay, but if we go in, we can’t go in as FBI, not with doctor-patient confidentiality.”
Donna led the way into the glowing room. There, floating above the floor, was a large glowing rip in the air. It crackled with energy.
Sam let out a sigh of relief. He thought he’d have to convince her more thoroughly. “Blood of a most holy man, fruit from the tree of life, and the Seal of Solomon. I found some fruit in the Men of Letters storeroom, but the other two we need.”
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean said, suddenly at Cas’ side. Cas gasped in a breath. He hadn’t realized he’d been holding it. Dean took the ex-angel’s arm and sat him down at the table.
“103,” she said, and pressed a button on the wall. “Thank you, but I’m going to need you to wait outside.” She ushered Sam and Cas out of the room as a doctor in a white coat walked quickly into the room.
“It’s a tulpa,” he said, “a creature brought to life by a combination of that sigil and a whole bunch of people believing in the same story.”
Dean and Cas whirled around. There, at the top of the stairwell, was Chuck, grinning maliciously at them. One eye was a brilliant white, the other a deep black.
“You don’t have to do this alone,” Jody said. Claire couldn’t bear to look at her. “When you’re ready, if you want… we’re all here for you.”
One of the sisters, he assumed the elder of the two, was onto him, wielding a knife. Dean grabbed her wrist before she could sink the blade into his chest, and twisted it away. But she was surprisingly strong for someone so small; she grabbed his throat and slammed him into the wall. He fought against her as she raised the knife again.
Dean ignored him. “All right, let’s see how good old Gloria was dealing.” He read from the journal in a painfully condescending voice. “‘And now that I’ve achieved catharsis, I can truly see the program works.’ The program, man? I mean, she’s one Kool-Aid away from Jonestown.” He grit his teeth. “What’d Wes’ journal say?”
“What is it?” Dean asked nervously, glancing back at where Cas must have been, hidden behind a copse of trees.
“No,” Dean called from behind the saloon doors, “She’s got access to the bodies before they’re ever in the ground. Anything she wants, she would just take, she doesn’t have to dig them back up.”
Sam gripped the door of the Impala in one hand and his dad’s hunting journal in the other as Dean sped down the two lane road. He didn’t even want to know how many miles per hour above the speed limit he was driving. He was scanning the pages, looking for anything that could fit the MO for what had taken Jack.
Rowena turned on him, her eyes filled with rage. “Don’t be stupid, he’s never gone!” Jack whined in discomfort and clutched at Dean’s shirt.
“Like, none taken,” the teenager in the green shirt replied, poking his head out from behind a suit of armour.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean wished he could help ease Cas’ pain, but he had no idea how much Advil was enough for an angel, and he wasn’t about to experiment and risk overdosing him. He gently laid the back of his hand across Cas’ forehead. He was hot and feverish. Dean stood and got a wet washcloth from the bathroom and laid it across his friend’s forehead.
She stopped. Her dad had told her to try and get rid of them, ignore them, make them go away. But it was the only way she felt connected to her grandmother, and despite the knowledge that it had been her dad’s fault that she never got to know her, she still felt guilty. “They never stopped.” She didn’t need to mention that she was actively practicing.
At the sound of Claire’s voice so close, Kaia lifted her head. Her vision blurred as she felt Claire pull her into a halfway sitting position in her lap.
Charlie stared him down for a long moment without answering. Then she put her gun in her hip holster, resting one hand on it, as she pulled an angel blade from behind her back. “Let me test you two. Then I’ll take you to her.”
“Oh, there he is,” she commented, racking her shotgun. However, as she took aim, more creatures stalked into view. There were at least seven, maybe more.
Gabriel just stared at Sam as he reached for the box of Cheerios that Sam had been giving to Jack. He shoved a handful in his mouth and grimaced.
“May I…?” Cas started, then trailed off. He’d been gone for so long. Did he have any right to play father to Jack just yet?
“Oh, lovely. Mind if I ask what your plans are for tomorrow?” she asked, tucking her keys into her jacket pocket.
Amara considered it for a moment. She did want to try her hand at Creation, and her brother was certainly experienced in that arena. “You won’t lock me up again?” Now that she had enjoyed her freedom, ending up back there would be all the worse.
Sam picked up the parenting book he’d set aside, and bounced Jack gently on his knee. He turned to the third page, a timeline of developmental milestones. He wondered if Jack would grow at the same rate as human babies; after all, he was part archangel. He figured it would be too much to hope for a nephilim parenting book. Then again, he was sitting in the largest collection of supernatural knowledge in North America.
“Hey, you know us, always picking fights with the big guys. Speaking of, uh…” he pressed his lips together, not sure how best to continue. “You, uh, you know how you killed Billie?”
“Oh, uh, well–” Donatello cleared his throat. “After God left, I said to myself, ‘Donatello, you are so retired.’” He chuckled. “I mean, who needs a prophet of God when there is no God? So,” he sighed, “a few days ago, I’m online, checking out condos in Boca, and I am knocked off my feet by this weird wave of power.” He screwed up his face in concentration. “Not exactly like God’s, more like… something new, something fresh.” Sam looked over at Dean, who had on a bitchface that could probably rival his own. “I was drawn to it.” Donatello paused, tilting his head. “It’s here.” Jack whimpered from the bed, which caught Donatello’s attention. “Who is that?”
“Yeah, for a few hours.” Dean chewed on his lizard. “We’ve been here for what? Two days and change?” He exhaled sharply. “Look, man, I hope you’re right, but if you’re not, and we’re stuck here in this freaking monsterland? I mean, nobody back home even knows where to start looking for us.”
“That thing is huge,” Dean said, unable to remove his gaze from the huge teeth. Those jaws probably could have crushed his skull in one bite.
They stacked an incredible amount of the sandwich fixings that had at some point been served to the table, creating the tallest and most barbaric sandwiches Sam had ever seen.
“No,” Missouri said, stopping Dean. “I just complicate things.” He stared at her. “James won’t have anything to do with me,” she explained.
Dean stumbled as his feet hit the carpet of the movie room. Gabe was giggling maniacally with Jack bouncing on his lap.
Sam turned around. There, on the road was the Impala. How Gabriel had managed to teleport an entire car into this cartoon was beyond him.
“I don’t know,” Cas replied, his voice breathy and weak. “Asmodeus captured us while Jack was at the hospital.”
“Ah, that’s nothing that we can’t fix.” Cas’ stomach roiled to see Lucifer talk about Jack like that. “But seriously, you know, why can’t I detect a presence?”
He rubs his temples, finding the telltale pressure of a tension headache building beneath his fingers to the incessant stream of
When Jack settles into his arms, Dean cradles him close, the boy’s head resting over the dark ink of a devil's trap, ear pressed to the thudding beat of Dean's heart. His whines flitter off like butterflies, replaced by soft whimpers and, finally, softer snores.
It feels so good just to have another body close by. He can fend for himself; managed through the majority of heats in his twenties alone, spent his formative years wrestling Alphas to the ground at the insistence of his commanding father—
“Why does that not surprise me at all?” Dean sighs, letting his head rest against the tub’s edge. Cold tile and warm steam.
If he had just listened, talked to Cas. If Dean had taken his blade and drawn on everything venomous within himself to see Lucifer stayed dead, if Dean had never kicked him out of the bunker, if Dean had never left him in purgatory, if Dean had just told him from the start how it felt to watch him leave every damn time, wishing more than anything else that he would just
Instantly he stills, eyes open and adoring and Dean watches as he reaches with a tiny fist for his cheek.
Kelly sobs—he sobs—Jack sobs and Cas holds on for dear life, his arms wrapped around the tender, pregnant frame, over nothing but comfort. Dean has seen him tear monsters limb from limb and yet this, this is the strongest Castiel has ever been. The weight of the world on his shoulders, its saviour in his arms.
Sam took off early on Saturday. Something about Eileen needing backup with a case in Casper. Wendigo, maybe? Vampires? Dean wasn’t really listening when he first mentioned it, distracted by Baby’s oil filters and the steady drip of black into the tray beside his head. It doesn’t really matter what’s rearing its head in Wyoming, not really. Eileen had called and it’d take a lot more than two states and an eight-hour drive to keep his brother away. Boy’s smitten. He knows it. Eileen knows it. Even Cas had quirked a brow seeing Sam splutter when Jody brought it up last time they were at dinner, referring to the hunter as his better half.
. I miss him so much and I don’t know what to do other than this. Cas was— Jack’s mother, Kelly, knew she was going to die and Cas was meant— Cas was meant to be here, be his guardian angel or something but—” The rest goes unsaid, ground already covered through bitter tears and anger. “I want you to meet him. Cas would want you to meet him.”
She thrusts the infant towards him, naked and wailing. Her palms glow where they touch it and Dean can see that she’s bleeding way more than she should be. He can see that she’s already dead.
“Not your fault. Heat’s fault.” Dean gasps, trying his damned hardest not to sound as desperate as he feels, but he
A massive understatement. Typical Dean Winchester, downplaying what could possibly have been one of the most life-changing moments of his long and arduous existence despite already having admitted to himself that Cas is, well, Cas is it for him.
They’ve never lasted more than four days before, torturous and isolating, but the shining thick platinum band on his fourth finger and still bruised ridged bite at the juncture of his neck signify changes not only to his body’s chemistry but to his entire life—never having to go through his heat alone again, no pricey suppressants or blockers, no more Alphas vying for his attention when they find out he’s unmated. In theory, it’s fantastic. In practice, calling his husband’s secretary because his skin crawls painfully with the urge to be mounted is not ideal.
As expected, his arms give out and he falls on top of Dean. Too exhausted to care, their hearts race in an echo of each other.
Meg gets it, the playful flirting they usually share shoved aside in favour of reassurance and order. The husk surrounding her voice is nice, just enough Alpha lilting through to take the razor edge off, tricking his body into thinking there’s a juicy knot close by just waiting to pop him.
“I encouraged him to sign quickly. Meg helped,” Cas pulls back, resting on his forearm, their faces so close. Dean can taste the coffee on his breath, the heat of it melting against his lips. He wants to whine, to buck up and urge a reaction out of his Alpha. He’s so desperate for it he could come just from the deep gravel of Cas’s voice alone. “Something about me having a better offer waiting.”
Dean’s eyes flash to red and Cas, unable to hold himself back from the edge, stutters out a few weak thrusts as he comes.
Dean’s not looking at him, intentionally or not, but Cas can see his eyes glitter in the dim light. Then they’re slipping closed and he smiles as smoke slips from his nose.
He uses all the hurt, all the rage, and transforms it into something good. Or something better. A catalyst. An alchemist. Pain turned golden.
“Badass? Loyal? Dedicated? Understanding? I got more if you want ‘em.” Sam scoffs, halfway through his second plate. Maybe Dean should add this one to his arsenal of recipes, even if it is a bitch to find egg-free lasagne noodles in Lebanon, Kansas.
“I love it when you beg.” Cas smirks against the back of his neck, one hand braced on the mattress by his own, using the abundance of slick to wet himself and Dean can’t stop the choked cry he makes as silken warmth slips against him over and over, close but not close enough. Never close enough.
Claire’s crouched low, silver switchblade in hand. She’s unharmed but her palms are shaking. The fluorescents of the bunker bounce off her knife in thready beams.
“Angels?” He says it on a downstroke and Dean gasps a little as the stretch overwhelms him. If he could, he’d spend hours, days, drawing those noises from Dean’s throat. Raw. Unfiltered. Each one goes straight to his cock.
Words don’t come, just laboured breaths and wandering palms as limbs give out and Dean falls boneless to the mattress, the absence of heat allowing the more unpleasant aches in his body to come to the surface. Cas, ever the pragmatist, rolls them to one side, still spooned against Dean’s back and tied deep inside. The closeness of it all, the intimacy of being as close as two people can be— this is the part he loves.
In all honesty, no. He doesn't. He wishes it hadn’t taken driving all the way out here, getting caked with dirt and actually meeting a fucking
Dean, of course, catches him watching. There’s a stubborn set to his jaw, defiance in its rawest form, but his eyes are softer, bright and swimming with endorphins.
He’s crying — screaming, really — with his tiny fist pressed to his mother’s chest. Kelly’s eyes glow golden. She shimmers with divinity and tears of ethereal light streak her face. She’s dead, or she should be, but instead, she’s shining, seeing something that isn’t there.
“I do believe I’m being a terrible husband.” His voice is honey over grit and it sinks to the pit of Dean’s stomach and takes root.
Cas turns to look at where he’d buried the box but the ground was how he’d left it. Nothing had happened. Nothing had happened and yet…
Abandoning the trowel, he nudges the excavated dirt on top of the void of his own making, regretting that he’s still wearing his good shoes and hadn’t had the foresight to slip on sneakers or walking boots or something a little less conspicuous.
Mary was dead the second she stepped through that portal, sealing Lucifer in the barren wasteland with her. Dean forces himself to believe it, even if he doesn’t want to. It’s the only way he can sleep at night. Sometimes there are worse things than death. He nods and it’s not enough for Sam but he doesn’t push for more. He knows not to.
He chuckles, lips turned up in a smile that completely derails whatever thoughts had been running through Cas’s head, replacing them with things he shouldn’t be thinking, especially not about the demon he summoned with dirt and bone. “Depends. Do you think you deserve damnation?”
knows he would if he could. There’s a part of him that’s worried about their audience, but it disappears when Cas’ takes an arm around his waist, drags him back in and just fucking
, checking in beforehand sounds like a better idea. The last thing Dean wants to do is fuck this up. And hey, consent is sexy.
“Is this still about Shurley’s final?” He steals the joint back, taking his own drag and letting the familiar heaviness weight in his limbs. It’s hitting him already and he can’t even feel embarrassed about it, revelling in how he’s floating but still grounded, still safe. Dean leans forward, chuckling to himself and then he fixes Castiel with a look; heavy lids and soft eyes and a half smile that’s just
"Nah, just hold him for a second?" Dean whispers, shushing Jack gently as he does. It's instinctual and useless.
.” She bites, self-control kicking into overdrive as Dean’s melts away completely. “I’ll drop him a memo but, honey, this merger’s been on the books for months now and Zac ain’t joking around. It’s been the only thing on Clarence’s mind ‘cept for your nethers. If he doesn’t come out of that conference room with a signed contract—”
The night is still as silent as it was when he first got here — moon still bright, air still crisp — only now he has dirt caked to his slacks and the only thing he’s thinking of is the dry cleaning bill.
he feels for not telling Cas when he had the chance, about the flash of golden light and about waking up hours later and still shaking from the intensity of it.
He pulls two inexpertly rolled joints from his pocket, slightly crumpled but still intact. “You wanna get high?”
and Dean nods because there’s not much else he can do. Cas gets it, turns and heads back to the rapidly growing pile of paperbacks next to Eileen.
Dean wraps one leg behind Castiel’s knees, weakly urging him forward. He goes willingly, letting himself fall. The sudden roughness of Castiel’s starched shirt against his bare chest knocks the air out of him. Wrapping an arm around his husband’s shoulders and using the other to card through his hair, Dean sighs. Cas smells incredible; ozone and cut grass and sandalwood and an edge of copier toner. It’s so natural to him now, each inhale has him relaxing into the mattress.
“Are you sure you’re gay?” Kelly asks—he asks—Jack asks, and Cas chuckles at her question. He gets that look, the one Dean’s only ever caught as Cas looks away. The one Cas has never allowed him to see. The full force of it, with the half-smile and the sincerity and the crow’s feet he’d never noticed before now, shatters him.
He sighs. Jo smirks. Charlie pouts. She’s stubborn and passionate and one of the most infuriating people he’s ever had the pleasure of sharing a hangover with. And yeah, maybe she has a bit of a ‘problem’ with ‘authority’. It’s not like Dean didn’t know that. She single-handedly demolished the restrictions on their dorm’s wifi the first day they met.
Whatever self control Cas had been using to hold himself back, to let this be about Dean—about care and assistance and protection, about his Omega—and not just his own needs, breaks. It falls apart beneath Dean’s nails, biting into taught muscle hard enough to draw blood.
Dean looks up at him from beneath thick lashes and Cas wants nothing more than to kiss him right now. That is, until Dean opens his mouth to speak. “Do you wanna fuck me?”
The room spins for a second and then he’s somewhere else, still clutching tight to the infant in his arms, sat on a bed that isn't his own. There’s a crib in the corner but it’s not the same one they picked up second hand from a carpenter just outside the city. There’s a mural on the wall and Dean knows instantly where he is.
“But I don't deserve it!” Kelly cries—he cries—Jack cries. Cas holds her hand tighter, refusing to give up, refusing to let go.
The memory turns blurry around the edges as if Dean is slipping underwater, slipping away. Every part of him yearns to reach out as if he could feel the soft fabric of Castiel’s trench coat, the one that doesn’t smell like him anymore, but Kelly’s arms—his arms—Jack’s arms don’t move. “Will you get some rest now, please? My doula class said stress is not good for the baby.”
“Called it!” Crowley shouts, handing out the remaining mugs. Cas smiles in thanks and raises a single eyebrow at Dean. ‘Gaydar’ doesn’t exist. This he knows. There’s no genetic mutation that allows people to identify who is or isn’t queer. God, Dean would’ve been screwed if there was. High School was not the easiest place to realise he didn’t just like girls. There’s no biological giveaway, no neon light flashing above anyone that identifies as anything other than straight. This is real life, not X-Men. And yet, of course, Cas knew. He’s got that glint in his eye, that smug little lift at the corner of his smile, the one that says
“Oh yeah,” Sam’s voice comes tinny through his phone speaker, reverberating against the porcelain of the sink. It’s not often Dean takes calls while he’s in the bath but he hasn’t heard from Sam in a week so it’s nice to catch up and relax at the same time. Multitasking. The lemon mint scent of the bath salts Charlie gifted him last spring solstice is headachey; rich and vibrant and, yeah. Kinda grounding in the way he feels his magic simmer to attention beneath his skin, kinda unsettling in the way he knows he’s gonna smell like dessert for hours after. He shoulda used the chamomile salts instead. Benny’s blends never let him down before. “Tried and tested, man. Ro and I have used it a bunch of times. Full moons, planetary alignments, holidays, anniversaries. It’s a good time.”
In the days since Dean pushed his way out of the earth, crawled from the copse of dead saplings, and started back towards civilisation, Castiel had tried his best to communicate. Free of the darkness of hell and the gravity of his task, heralding praises for the heavens, he sings.
“That, my friend," Dean starts, pausing to pull out a silver flask from his pocket and take a sip. A drop of liquor catches on his bottom lip. Time slows for a second as his tongue darts out to collect it. Cas knows he's not being subtle as he watches but, quite frankly, he doesn't give a shit. "Sounds like a no. Call it demon intuition.”
“I’d offer up my own services but, contrary to popular belief, I don’t have a deathwish.” She drawls, probably smirking about the whole ordeal. “Don’t you have any toys to mount? Plugs? Anything?”
He can feel, rather than hear, the rumble that seats in his husband’s chest, caught between a growl and a moan. It’s no question that he’s trying to hold back the ferocity. Dean doesn’t want him to. He
Cas is close behind—so close that Dean can smell it on him, woodsmoke and lust—and each disjointed stutter of his hips, groan of
With practised movements, he slides home. Two fingers shallowly displacing more and more slick as he rides them, caught rutting between the sheets and his own hand. It’s lazy, doing it this way, but he doesn’t have the energy for anything else. Even if he had a toy, something to ride while waiting for his husband, his Alpha, to return, the bone-deep exhaustion dragging at his limbs probably wouldn’t allow him to fully utilise it. Is it too much to just want to be filled? He clenches at the thought, easily swapping two fingers for three, four. It’s not enough and he knows it but it’s not like there’s anything else he can do other than fuck himself and wait. The comfortable pace and friction of cotton on the underside of his cock has him passing the brink of orgasm once again, drenching his wrist and spattering the sheets in the process.
Where did all his anxiety go? All the fear, all the hurt. He can't find it but, then again, he doesn't really look, too focused on the opportunity presenting itself before him. The only thing screaming through Cas's head is want, so visceral and fierce, and the telltale signs of arousal licking their way from the pit in his stomach. Fuck.
He’s no longer in the memory, Cas’ voice is vibration alone and his eardrums throb with it but it quietens until he can’t hear it or feel it at all. Jack’s presence is nowhere to be felt either.
“Luckily, Dean, the answer is simple.” Cas, voice just as rough as Dean thought it would be, settles between them. He doesn’t sound pissed or shocked or sad or any of those things. He sounds content. Happy. “Would you like me to enlighten you?”
through Kelly’s eyes.” Dean sinks his fork into a slice of bacon as Sam nods, intentionally silent as to give Dean the time and space to talk it out.
“I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you. Hey, buddy? I’m sorry. Daddy’s sorry. I love you. I love you so much. Your other dad, Sam, loves you too. And your other dad, Cas— Castiel. You only met him before— Claire says you remember him. You showed her. He’s her dad too, kinda. He’s not here now, Jack. He’s an angel and he’s watching over you, okay?
Cas takes a step back, trying his best to remain fucking calm but this guy looks like something that walked straight out of a rock concert and into the middle of the street. Leather jacket, wash faded tee and thick combat boots. Despite the distance between them, he catches the cloying reek of gasoline, leather and sulfur in the air. “Who are you?”
He can’t find the words. Envy gains him nothing and yet it gnaws at his bones like ice. Why Claire? Why now?
. What Dean wouldn’t give for his old knot toy, with its thick silicone base and blunt head. Cold and clinical in comparison to the real thing, but familiar all the same. The second this wave of unrelenting libidinosity breaks, Dean makes the decision to treat himself to a new one; larger, thicker.
Cas can feel his eyes widen, his pulse race, breath catch—all of it. Any moment now he’s going to wake up, sweating and hard, the result of too many late nights and not enough action.
Cas lets his hands settle at Dean’s hips, thumbs rubbing circles into the prominent juts there, tightly coiled muscle jostling whenever he shifts his weight to shuffle out of his jeans. Laying back and just taking in the show, it occurs to him how much strength Dean really holds.
,” It comes as more of a whisper, a revelation. It’s no secret that his husband is a little possessive. She’d been at the wedding, watched as Cas sank his teeth into the fleshy skin of his throat in a performative imitation of the mating claim they already shared, seen the bloodied smile and caught the pinpricks of need Dean couldn’t quite hide from his scent when they’d parted. Guests had left pretty quickly after that. “I can respect that.”
falling from his lips. His dick, untouched, flushed red against his stomach, lurches in response — a string of precome attaching itself to Dean’s navel.
Dean can’t hold it back. Cas is here, his throat feels like sandpaper and everything he wants to say, everything he’s ever wanted to say gets caught, but he tries, tries and tries again.
“I’m sorry.” It comes out as sobs, a confession wrapped in salt and barbs. Dean swallows them back, swallows it all back. The dam breaks, regardless.
Cas looks to Sam who doesn’t even need to be asked. He takes Jack to his hip, letting the kid twist his hands in the soft strands of hair at his nape. Claire goes to his side, cooing over Jack’s toes as if that’s something normal people do.
The stranger raised one eyebrow as if to challenge him. “Then prove it to me. Show me why I should waste my time with you.”
Cas’ eyes shone brightly up at Dean.  Now he understood.  Dean already knew.  Cas was going to say it anyway.  “I love you, Dean.  You loving me back; that was the happiness that summoned the Empty.”  Cas’ teary-eyed smile only made Dean hold him tighter, wiping the tears from his face.  Cas continued.  “When I made that deal, I never thought I could risk professing my love for you.  I didn’t want to lose the relationship we had.  When Billie was pounding on that door, I was ready to do it anyway, to summon the empty and save you.”  Cas’ gaze, still directed up at Dean, intensified.  He looked at Dean as though he was the most wonderous thing in the universe.  “I never imagined you would beat me to it.”
Cas had been rehearsing in his mind what he would say to Dean.  How he could follow Dean’s confession with his own.  How to word it with enough reverence to truly show Dean how much he
.  Knowing that you love me, with your love that has saved the world, over and over again – that is more than I
It was Jack’s turn now to feel guilty.  He looked at Dean sorrowfully.  “I – I think I know what happened.”
.  I had lost faith in everything, and – by having faith in me, and having my back in everything, I gained faith in
Dean lifted his head off his sleeve and looked towards Sam’s shoes.  “Billie – she – she chased us back to the bunker.  She was determined to - to kill me for killing her.  She almost suffocated me in the war room, but Cas – he – he carried me to the dungeon and warded it.”  A wet gasp interrupted Dean as he tried to speak.  “We were
“After all that we’ve been through, what would it be worth if I never got to say it?  And I’m sorry it took me until now to say it, Cas.”  Dean gasped through a huge sob as the door rattled hard.  “Cas –
He thought back to the vision Jack had shown him from the womb.  The better world, the future, that Jack was destined to bring.  Cas knew now that it was up to him to claim the rest –
, again, because of him, all bets were off.  She had nothing to lose and nothing to uphold anymore.  Billie was going out, and she had made it clear that she was taking Dean with her.  There was no stopping her; Dean understood that.  He was going to die here in the bunker, with Cas.  She would probably kill Cas too, for helping him and for being the one who broke their deal and killed her the first time.  She has no reason not to kill Cas.  They’re both going to die.
Cas closed his eyes and checked his grace.  It was fully intact.  His wings – he spread them and the lightbulbs burst in the dungeon and down the hallway in a shower of sparks as his full power unfurled.  Cas was whole.
Cas was now less than a foot away from Dean, looking up into his tear-filled eyes with a mixture of wonder, hope, and despair.
Sam’s face contorted with concern. “Dean!”  He ran up and put his hands on Dean’s shoulders.  “What happened?”
“I know Chuck’s gone,” Dean sighed, a trace of desperation still in his voice.  “But I can’t help that I’m still afraid of losing you.  I’ve lost
Dean took a labored breath, and looked at the street beneath him, seeing the black sludge swirling in its depths.  He closed his eyes, but that didn’t help, because all he could see then was the desperation in Cas’ face as he said Dean’s name for the last time.  He opened his eyes and looked towards the car Sam had been driving instead.
.  Afraid that I’d push you away, or that by telling you I would doom you, or doom myself to losing you.”
Sam got beside Dean and wrapped an arm around him for support, bringing them both to lean on Baby.  “Dean…” Sam spoke softly and his breath caught in his throat.  It hurt him to see Dean like this, and he thought he knew where this was going.  “Dean, you didn’t know.  You couldn’t have known.”  Sam’s voice was almost a whisper at this point.  “Dean, what happened?”
After football practice that afternoon, Dean went home to finish his remaining schoolwork. He got lucky with mostly easy classes this year, but still acted as if he deserved a break after only two hours of studying.
“No, but it’s getting hot in here,” Dean said as he peeled off both his flannel and t-shirt underneath.
They continued talking through dinner, and then it was time to go. Michael stood up, addressing the table.
“Hmm?” Cas’ boyfriend didn’t want to separate their lips. He could feel the vibration of the words on both of their mouths. Why did they have to talk
Dean grabbed the front of the man’s shirt as he plundered his mouth with all he had. He licked inside and within seconds, engaged in a battle for dominance as both men’s tongues met each other. If you were to ask Dean’s opinion, he thought that it went pretty well.
Dean unloaded the car and made his way up to their dorm. He didn’t unpack anything – he’d leave that to Cas, who had a bit of a talent for interior decorating.
He jumped on the bed like the overgrown man-child that he was, and started peppering Cas’ face with kisses. Cas returned each one, and even gave him a small smile (score 1 for Dean, his plan was working!) but pushed his boyfriend away after a few moments. Dean couldn’t stand seeing his lover like this, biding their time until something better came along. A smile wasn’t enough, he needed a laugh. So Dean kept on rolling away from Cas until he reached the edge of the bed. Dean winked, and while looking directly at Cas, promptly fell off the bed. Cas peered over and saw Dean give a flourish with his hands and copy one of the gymnastic poses he had learned (the summer Olympics would return to television soon, and he wanted to be caught up! His childhood friend Jo would be competing this year, and he was
His real name is Dmitri Tippens Krushnic. He went undercover after the last fiasco with the Queen of England. To this day, he continues to harbor an obsession with her.
Ever since that day, Dean would mysteriously find a different pair of underwear hanging in his locker. Once it happened two days in a row, another time it was three weeks before a pair came to him. He didn’t check to see if they had been worn or used, he didn’t stop to wonder if that punk Cas copied his idea and was taking the girls’ panties to give to Dean, and he definitely did not think of Cas wearing these panties… and nothing else.
Cas handed Jack off to Sam, and joined Dean at the stove. He chattered instructions to Cas, trying to drown out the awkward silence at the table. His heart pounded. John hadn’t seemed to approve of a single person they’d introduced him to so far, and Mary obviously did not approve of John’s behavior after her death. Would he have to choose between his father and the rest of his family?
“No?” Dean replied lazily. He leaned over to turn down the music playing from the boombox set between them, and grabbed his beer from where it was set down at his feet.
“He’s got a fever, we can’t get it down, and he wouldn’t stop crying,” Sam explained. The nurse took Jack from Cas, causing him to wake and start whining.
One of the creatures bumped up against the car, rocking them, and it shot even more adrenaline through Jody’s body. She watched as it dragged a hand across the window above Donna’s head before moving around and thudding up against the hood of the car.
“You’ll forgive me if I’m a little on edge,” Cas growled. “The last time we were together, you killed me.”
Dean helped Cas to his feet, then leaned toward him to speak. “Castiel– the Scooby Gang,” Dean said as an introduction. He gestured to the four people and dog standing before him as if posed.
“Yeah.” With the danger of Jack’s health averted, his mind wandered back to the girl he’d seen earlier. He stood and left the room, heading to the room a few doors down that she’d been taken to.
“I’m gone for just a few months, and you’ve already got another powerful enemy. Why I even bother….”
“Excuse me, dears,” Missouri replied. She walked back to the front door and began to hum softly, hand shaking as she held it over the doorknob. Jody turned to Dean in confusion.
“He’s part human. The doctors may be able to help.” Cas sighed. “And… If necessary, I can go to Heaven’s gate. See if any of the other angels will help me.”
Sam nodded. “Now, you’re sure it was his wife?” Dean walked up to them and stood next to Sam. He could feel irritation radiating off of his brother.
Patience looked at Dean, likely hoping for a different plan, but Dean agreed with James. Best get them out of here.
“Yes.” Lucifer’s face continued to morph, slowly, into his true face. Rowena screamed again. Sam lifted himself up onto his hands and knees. Something dripped onto his hand. He looked down to see blood dripping through his hair. So much blood. Too much blood.
“Not great,” Sam sighed, “she said she got out of the life for a while, but something happened, and she needed help with a case, so I put Jody on it.”
Cas rested his head against the stone wall behind him. “Well that’s a nice, horrifying plan. A little cannibalism?” As much as he wanted out, to return to Jack and Sam and Dean, he would not sink so low as to supply Lucifer with power. Not again, not after he let him use his vessel in the fight against Amara.
Sam attempted to tug the book from her hands, and she looked up at him in… terror? What was that about? She whispered something to Sam. He thought he could make out the ‘Lucifer’ among it. Sam took the book, and they both watched grimly as Rowena rushed out of the house.
“His soul was gone. He was corrupted. He was a danger to himself, and to you, and to all of humanity.”
Claire lifted her in her arms, grunting with the effort. Kaia wrapped her arms around Claire’s neck and buried her face in her chest, letting her tears soak into Claire’s shirt. She must have been drifting in and out of consciousness, because it felt like only a few minutes before there was a bright flash of light, and the two girls tumbled to the ground.
As he slid into the driver’s seat, Dean wondered again where Cas could have run off to. When he did pick up the phone, he said he was working on a lead, but he never gave any details, claiming it was too sensitive to say over the phone. Personally, Dean thought it was bullshit, but who knew what the angel got up to when he was away from the bunker?
“Mm. Most of the people I see are in the same boat.” She sat in a white armchair, leaving the pristine white couch for Sam and Dean. “No goodbye, no closure.” Dean sat slowly, trying not to jostle Jack too much as his legs scrunched upwards.
“For war.” Dean recoiled slightly. “War is what Michael does.” It pained him to think that he would have to once again take up the role of soldier, but really, wasn’t that what he was doing as a hunter, too?
“Yep,” Jody replied curtly. They listened to the creatures clattering and shrieking in the other room. Though she’d only seen two, she was sure there were more. Honestly, though, she didn’t want to find out just how many of them there were. She and Donna snuck silently back down the stairs. Adrenaline pumped through Jody’s body as they rounded corners and searched for another way out.
“Why do you look like me?” It wasn’t the most important of the questions racing through Cas’ head, but the whole situation was very disconcerting.
He almost crashed into Gabriel as he entered the kitchen, swinging a large purple crystal on a silver chain.
“Sam, growing up on the road, no matter where Dad dragged us, no matter what we did, there was always a TV. And you know what was always on that TV?” He smiled, which was a little bit hard to get accustomed to in cartoon. “Scooby and the gang. These guys are our friggin’ role models, man.” Sam thought that was a bit of a stretch. “Except Fred, he’s a wad.”
Rowena smirked. “I told you, Samuel, the Grand Coven dampened my powers. Thanks to you, I am now at my full strength.”
She took a deep breath as Claire joined her. “Claire, I know you’re not gonna like this, but I need you to stay here to keep Jack and Kaia and the girls safe.”
“The angel was Sam’s idea,” Dean said, interrupting Cas’ thoughts, “Kelly left a video message for Jack, and in it she told him that he had angels watching over him.” He smirked at Cas. “Seems like Kelly told it right.”
The oven beeped, breaking Dean out of his thoughts. He shaped the cookies and put them on the cookie sheet, then slipped them into the oven. He set the timer, then sat back down at the table, where his half empty coffee mug was waiting.
Dean swore under his breath. “Someone has to stay here and deal with this ghoul,” he muttered. He turned to Sam. “I’ll drop you both at the motel room. I packed some baby aspirin in Jack’s duffel, and there’s an ice machine down the hall. I’ll head back to the cemetery.”
It wasn’t just a revenge trip anymore. She needed it for herself, too. She needed to see it dead. She needed to know that it was rotting in Hell.
“He said they’ll keep an eye out, but….” She looked at James. His face grew went from melancholy to anguished. He stood from where he was sitting at the counter and left the kitchen. He returned with a map and a collection of crystals.
“I learned something very interesting today,” Dean said. “I learned that you– you, personally– lobotomized angels in order to reform them.” He stopped spinning his blade, catching it in a fighting grip. He raised his arms in a fake shrug. “I wanted to hear if it’s true.”
“I’m a friend of Sam and Dean Winchester.” Kaia stood, looking frightened. “And I think you know them too.”
“Yeah, well, at least Sammy’s still down there, living his best life,” Dean said, raising his beer in a halfhearted toast.
“No!” Kaia cried, “What the hell was that?!” Her head throbbed painfully from both the concussion and the very strange things she had witnessed. Usually these sorts of things only occurred in the Bad Place.
Dean groaned, and stood from the couch. “Man, I am getting real tired of fighting things that look like other things.”
For a moment, Velma just blinked at him. Then she burst out laughing. “Look, Sam, the simple fact is monsters are nothing more than crooks in masks– usually unscrupulous real estate developers.” She turned away to continue her search for clues.
“What do I want?” the Empty echoed, “I want you to shut up. I want– hmm.” It placed a hand on its cheek in frustration. “Having you awake, it’s like a gnat flew right up here–” it pointed to its temple “– and it’s trapped and it’s buzzing.”
“Walk with me.” She began to walk into the void. Cas followed. As they went, tiny stars began to appear. “There are certain rules of the universe, and transfers of power in the universe. You know some of these.”
“It’s not a gh–!” Velma batted away a rogue teddy bear. “It’s probably just Christmas lights and– and fishing line.”
For what might have been hours, Jody and Donna had hidden in a ratty old car, listening to the monsters shrieking outside. Each woman had her gun aimed out the opposite window.
“Donatello came back, offered to take him out on a walk, get him some fresh air. Don’t worry, I gave them protection charms. I, uh…” Sam cleared his throat. “I was changing him, and he must have been cold, or hungry, or something, because he wouldn’t stop crying, and… and the lights exploded.”
