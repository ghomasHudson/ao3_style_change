“What do you mean? How did she get her powers back from a demon?” Sam asked, turning back towards Andrew.  Andrew smiled, looking excited now.
“If you have any more questions or anything, don’t hesitate to call me.” Dean didn’t miss that she said all of this to Cas, not even sparing a glance at him.
Andrew jumped. “Right. She had to reform the rope; there isn’t another way to break the spell.”
“Dammit, Gabriel, stop screaming!” Dean said loudly. He stepped forward and relieved Gabriel of the baby.  He started to rock and coo the baby, muttering things like “shh” and “it’ll be okay” and “Dammit, Cas, what the hell” and finally, Cas stopped crying. Dean looked up, still rocking the baby.
Comments and kudos are almost as wonderful as the people taking the time to read this :)
“Shower’s free.” He told Cas as he walked across the room to his bag. He could feel Cas’ eyes follow him as he crossed the room and he had to suppress a smile. He turned around and caught Cas’ eye. The angel’s eyes were black with lust, with the smallest ring of blue surrounding them. Cas bit his lip and nodded, moving towards the bathroom. When the door closed, Dean was just thinking that maybe he didn’t get clean enough in his shower and that he may need to go join Cas in his when he heard a knock on the door.
His face wasn’t disappointing either. Strong, stubble-covered jaw, leading to slightly chapped, plush lips. Angular cheekbones, and the bluest eyes he’d ever seen.
“That woman today…” Dean said, in-between kisses, “you liked it, didn’t you? Liked me being possessive and claiming you as my own. Didn’t you?”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“I love you, too.” he said.
“Hadn’t realized what until now?” Dean asked, confused. Cas glanced up at him and then looked back at his feet.
“I hope so, too.” Gabriel said, and Sam nodded. Sam climbed in the passenger seat and Gabriel climbed in the back.
“Yeah, Cas. Thanks.” he said with a laugh. Cas grinned.
Sam, Dean and Gabriel all looked at each other. None of them had expected her to just outright admit that she had been the one to change Cas into anything. She smiled pleasantly at the three of them and sipped her tea.
“She was hitting on you.” Dean growled, and unconsciously pulled Cas closer.
“It doesn’t look like a witch’s hideout.” Dean said. It was a single-story brick building with a large garden and a gazebo. Gabriel shrugged.
Toddler Gabriel! Who's excited?
“Any cold spots or lights flickering, maybe the smell of sulfur?” Dean pressed. Amanda shook her head.
“Okay, so here it is: Addison, Wisconsin – 7 people have gone missing in the past four months – 5 of them in the last two. Of the 7, three have been found dead, and the other four are still missing. He paused and looked up at his brother. “Sound like our kind of thing?” he asked, grinning. Dean shrugged and stretched, leaning back in the chair.
“For God’s sake, fuck me, Dean.” Dean grinned at Cas’ blasphemy. He took his fingers out and slicked his cock up. He pressed teasingly against Cas’ hole. Cas surprised Dean by pressing himself down and taking Dean inside himself with one fluid motion.
I don't understand that last emoticon. CN
“He’ll be here any minute.” She sighed happily. The words filled Dean with dread. He didn’t want to be here whenever this Bael showed.
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean said. The angel nodded and was suddenly gone, leaving a terribly awkward silence in his wake. He snuck a look at Gabriel and found that the archangel was sulking in the backseat. Dean couldn’t help but to feel a little vindictive pleasure at the unhappy look on Gabriel’s face. Sam was staring out the window, obviously avoiding any drama between his brother and his boyfriend. Dean shrugged mentally and looked back at the road. It won’t hurt Gabriel to pout for a little while.
“Let me finish.” The angel nodded, and Dean took another breath. “Regardless of what happens tomorrow, I wanted you to know that I love you. More than I’ve loved anyone in a long time.” Dean smiled at Castiel, who took a deep, shaky breath before speaking.
“That, I don’t know.” he smiled. “But we know
“What happened to an hour?” he asked and Dean shrugged.
Lisa let out a cruel laugh. “Too late for that.” She said, her tone cold. She turned around once again, flipping her hair as she walked out of the bakery.
“Fine. But be ready to go in 10 minutes. It’s a long drive to Wisconsin.” Gabriel snorted.
“Dean, is there supposed to be a piece of cloth in the front?” He asked, pulling at the collar. Dean smiles.
“Amanda Wilson.” she said, her eyes wide. Whether it was in wonder or fear, Dean didn’t know. Gabriel glanced over at Sam and then back to Amanda.
“I love you, too.” Dean answered automatically, his eyes lighting up with happiness as he wrapped his arms around Castiel and kissed him enthusiastically.
Dean chuckled and threw an arm around Castiel. “I know. I worry about you, too.” he said, kissing him on the cheek. Castiel scoffed.
. He squirmed uncomfortably as Dean changed him. He didn’t really understand how Dean could be so nonchalant about it. Then Cas remembered that Dean didn’t see him as Cas, he saw him as a baby. And there was nothing
The smite-y expression was back.
“The cuddling or the bath?” Dean asked, and Castiel sighed, relaxing even more against Dean.
“Katie’s Mom?” he asked, and Dean nodded. She turned towards Dean.
“Do you truly believe Andrew is in the wrong for wanting to drink away his feelings?” Cas asked. Dean hesitated, and then slumped in defeat.
“Is it a spell?” he asked curiously, studying the ingredients.
“I can get us out of here.” Gabriel offered, but Dean shook his head.
“I’m always gonna need you, Cas.” Dean whispers against his collarbone. Their pants had disappeared a while ago “You’re always going to be who I need. What I need. No matter what happens.” He picks up his head, trailing careful kisses along his jaw. “I love you, Cas. You and Sam, and now Mom, you’re all I have.” He kisses him softly. “You aren’t an attack dog. You’re family, Cas. You’re mine.”  Dean rolls his hips, causing their naked cocks to slide together in agonizing pleasure.
"You didn't. But anyway, what do you want? I know this isn't a social call." Castiel said, making his voice light, teasing. Dean didn't need to know what he did to Castiel.
Castiel was shaking by the time he made it to his car. It took him three tries to even unlock the door, and another five to get the keys in the ignition. He was stupid. Now everyone would know. He wouldn’t be surprised if someone had videoed it. It would be viral by the morning. And everyone he knew, his family, his co-workers…they’d all know what type of person Castiel was. A homewrecker.
as Dean bottomed out. Dean pulled out and pushed in again, starting a fast pace that showed just how much he wanted and needed the angel. Dean slid his hand down and gripped Cas’ other leg and pulled it slightly. Cas got the idea wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck, allowing Dean to pick him up and wrap his legs around Dean’s waist. Dean held him close, kissing his chest, shoulders, and collarbones as he moved in and out in an increasingly frantic, uncoordinated pace. Cas could feel his orgasm building up slowly and reached one hand to jerk his own dick, knowing Dean couldn’t do it and hold him up at the same time.
"Sure. I haven't eaten yet today, so I probably should." Dean said, accepting the wrapped burger the Castiel handed him. He picked up his own burger, as well, though he didn't really want to eat it. Dean had bought it for him. He was definitely going to eat it.
was your favorite.” Cas said, still looking down in embarrassment. s. Dean actually had to laugh.
It was Cas. The angel smiled.
“Last time I heard, he was at Jefferson’s, killing his liver.” The way she said it made it clear this was a long-running fight between the two of them.
He really had no idea why Sam was so worried.
“Dean, your heart rate is increasing.” Castiel said, his arms circling Dean’s waist. Dean took comfort in it, fighting off the panic attack. Damn, he hadn’t had one in years, and now he was on the verge of one just because he thought about Cas leaving him.
“Bitch!” he called.
“What, Dean? Just tell me what you want; I’ll give it to you.” Dean moaned.
Dean pushed open the door to their room. Sam was nowhere in sight, but Gabriel was sitting at the desk with Sam’s laptop open in front of him. As soon as Dean stepped in the door Gabriel stood up. It was obvious he had been waiting on him.
Dean stood there, dumbfounded, staring at Andrew. He looked at Sam and then to Gabe and finally back to Andrew. Sam’s mouth was set in a hard, unhappy line and Gabriel was frowning. Dean stood back wordlessly to let them all enter the room. He watched as Gabriel plopped himself down on the bed and started flicking through the T.V. Channels. Sam leaned against the wall and Andrew sat down at one of chairs at the table. He watched as Dean cautiously placed himself in the opposite chair. Cas moved to stand behind Dean, putting one hand on his shoulder. (Normally, Dean would object about the PDA, but he was so
“C’mere.” Dean said, walking up and grabbing Castiel’s arm, leading him over to the bathroom mirror, putting his back towards the mirror. There, on his back, were track marks made by Dean’s nails; in the shape of two red angel wings.
“Good morning, my name is Chris Anderson, and I came here today to ask you if you have accepted our lord and savior Jesus Christ.” the man said, holding out a pamphlet. He smiled at Dean and the hunter had to fight the urge to laugh. It was kind of funny, considering he had
Castiel hurriedly downed the coffee on his way to the bathroom. He needed a quick shower, to wash off the smell of the sex he was sure was lingering on his skin. If anything, it had probably gotten worse after all night. He brushed his teeth first, staring down at the sink to avoid looking into the mirror. He didn't need to see what was in the mirror. He didn't want to see what everyone else saw when they looked at him.
“What should we do?” Sam asked. He stood slightly off to the side, his stance half-ready to run, half-ready to fight. Dean swore under his breath. This shit was not supposed to have happened. They were completely unprepared for a fight, especially a fight with an obviously powerful witch.
“We were already here about the other disappearances, and we happened to hear about your daughter.” She nodded and held out her hand.
“Nothing gets past you, does it?” Dean said sarcastically, and the way Cas’ face lights up at Dean’s ‘praise’ sends a jolt of guilt through the hunter. He knows the angel is trying his best and being a dick to him (although it was Dean’s nature) wasn’t necessarily called for.
Gabriel sighed and stood up, walking over to Sam. They might not be able to get up to any of their usual shenanigans but even being closer to the man was better than nothing. Sam picked him up without a second thought, before Gabriel had even had a chance to pester him about it. He and Sam had been like that from the very beginning – always in sync, knowing what the other wanted before they knew it themselves.
“I didn’t like it. You’re
“Will you stop doing that?” Dean growled, rocking the baby trying to calm him down again. Gabriel just rolled his eyes.
“Nooooo.” Dean said, reaching out and grabbing Castiel, hauling him back down onto the bed and throwing both his legs and his arms around the angel. “Just…stay. We can be responsible later.”
“Cas.” He said in a hoarse voice. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Cas, Cas, buddy, wake up.” Nothing. “Cas, c’mon, I need my arm back.” Dean touched the angel’s shoulder with his head. Cas woke with a start and turned over, almost punching Dean in the face. He blinked several times as his brain gradually started to catch up with his body. He looked at over at Dean.
“I think we should leave, Dean.” he said, sitting the beer down carefully. Dean swallowed, nodding, and stood up. Oh god, what if that woman just ruined everything? Didn’t Cas see him fighting her off. He thought about what Cas had walked up on, his hands on her hips and her lips on his neck and
“Yeah, yeah. We’ll see.” Dean turned to Cas. “You wanna zap us to the nearest baby store?” Cas nodded and stood up, turning towards Gabriel and addressing him.
“So tell me, boys, why are you here?” She asked. Dean swore internally. She knew exactly why they were here and yet. Damn witches. Sam, Dean, and Gabriel exchanged glances. Dean cleared his throat.
“I think he said ‘Thank you.’” Gabriel said, appearing out of nowhere. Dean scoffed.
“As long as he’s okay, you know. I can handle it.” Sam said. Gabriel leaned his head around the corner.
"It's also full of love." Castiel's voice was sincere as he placed his bag gently on the dresser and started to pull off his clothes, undoubtedly changing the ones he'd had on since late last night. “Which is something I’m not sure I’ve experienced before. It’s certainly different.”
“Dean, calm down. Dean!” Castiel snapped his fingers in front of Dean’s face and Dean looked at him. “There you are.” Cas said gently, cupping his face. “Where did you go?” he asked softly.
It was over after that. Dean was relentless in his worship of Castiel’s body, tasting and teasing and bringing him to the edge, only to pull him back with sweet kisses and whispered endearments. It was the most exquisite kind of torture, something that Castiel would experience over and over again so long as Dean is the one who administers it.
Plus, no one was paying attention to the powerless angel in the corner. They would see their mistake soon enough. After a few minutes, Castiel saw a flake of paint drop and float down to the floor. In the next second, Castiel had to stifle a gasp as all of his power rushed back to him.
Watching the witch gather the ingredients for the spell was downright
“I know, I know. You’ll find me and kill me or make me your sex slave or whatever the hell it is that you witches do. Now, please, just give me my angel back.”
"So should you."
“What was that?” Dean bit his lip, the harshness in Castiel’s voice sending chills down Dean’s spine. Dean swallowed.
“Oh, Cas, I’m so sorry.” He said, sitting down in a chair beside the bed and taking his hand. “I love you. So much. I’m so sorry.” He closed his eyes, resting his head on their clasped hands. He wasn’t ever going to let go.
“Winchesters.” Gabriel said, shrugging slightly. Castiel sighed.
“I would never, ever, hurt anyone on purpose, Gabriel. I would give my life for anyone of you in this room, for anyone else that I’ve gotten hurt. I would gladly take their place.” Dean said, his eyes flashing. “If you think for one second I would put my life above anyone else’s life, especially Cas’ or Sam’s, you’ve got another thing coming.” Dean shoved past the archangel and grabbed his jacket, making his way towards the door. He turned to glare at Gabriel one more time before opening the door and walking out, slamming it behind him. Gabriel turned and looked at Sam, who shrugged.
“Hey, guys.” He stretched out a little and blinked at the sun. “What time is it?”
Cas popped back in, a move that would have scared Dean once upon a time, but he’s too used to it by this point.
Yeah, both of them had been a little sore from sleeping like that all night.
“His magic is still in effect. We will have to carry him.” Cas looked a little strained under the weight of the man.
Of course, having a toddler/archangel with him kind of shattered that peace. Gabriel was a talkative, bouncy person anyway, and that had transferred over to his current toddler state.
“You didn’t do anything, Cas. You were just being you.” The angel still looked confused.
The kisses slowed gradually until they were just curled together, so close it was difficult to tell whose limbs belonged to whom.
Dean hung the phone up. Cas tilted his head the way he always did when he was confused.
Great. See you then :* DW
“Don’t move!” Dean said. The guy froze and put up his hands up. He looked scared.
“Please what?”
“I have always had God in my life.” Castiel stated, looking at the man. Dean couldn’t help but grin at the look on the man’s face. He knew it was wrong of him to exploit the angel’s lack of understanding, but he just couldn’t pass up this opportunity. It was too funny. The guy -Chris- set his jaw.
he did it, and it isn’t your fault that you reacted. He’s your brother, Sam. He knows how to push your buttons.” Gabriel got up and walked over to Sam. “Besides, I’m pretty sure it’s Dean that gets stuck up Cas’ ass, not the other way around.” He bumped Sam with his hip. Sam rolled his eyes but Gabriel could see a smile on his face as he pushed him away.
“If you are having trouble just carrying Sam and Andrew, I would fear that something is wrong. You should be able to lift much more than that.” He said, looking worriedly at his brother. Gabriel just smiled.
“Deeeaaannn.” he moaned in a high-pitched whine, as Dean hooked his fingers and found Castiel’s prostate. He pressed against it, and Cas arched his back.
“So you don’t know…hmmm…now that is quite…
“I’m tired.” he muttered. Castiel smiled and sat down next to Dean on the bed.
“You didn’t give me a chance to.” He replied, staring right back at Dean. A silence stretched on only to be broken by Gabriel.
“I may have some information about that. Casmiria
"What? Oh, yes, it's here." Castiel said, looking up from the jacket.
“Do you miss them?” Castiel asked bluntly, as he pulled away.
He didn’t forget that this entire thing was his fault in the first place. If it hadn’t been for him, they would have never had to deal with this witch and they wouldn’t have to be risking their lives to take her down. He knew that they didn’t blame him for any of it, but that didn’t matter; he blamed himself enough for all of them.
started. He tried to fight with me earlier, but then we made love and I thought he had gotten over it.” Cas gestured towards the still-open door. “Obviously not.”
Dean heart leapt happily and he surged forward unthinkingly to kiss his angel. Cas responded almost instantly, tangling his hands in Dean’s short hair and opening his mouth to deepen the kiss. Heaven. This was what heaven felt like.
“Yeah, but we can’t. So get your feathery ass up and get dressed. We got shit to do today.” Dean still wasn’t looking at Cas, but he felt a
“No problem, I hated her anyway.” He turned and started to walk away but stopped and turned back around.
“Always.” Cas said, diving in to kiss Dean again.
Dean was sitting in his office, attempting to finish some paperwork when his phone beeped, telling him he had a text message. Glad to have a distraction, he picked up his phone and read the message.
“You do that, and I’ll break your arm.” he stated, and then pulled the door open, hauling Cas out behind him. “See you in an hour!” he grinned.
“That is my boyfriend you are trying to sleep with.” he said bluntly. Natalie looked between them, her mouth open and gaping, and then she sighed.
“Welcome to our lives.” Dean said. Amanda didn’t respond. Dean cleared his throat.
“Ank  ooo.” Dean looked down at Cas, almost copying the angels confused head-tilt.
“Are you okay?” he asked. Dean nodded, running his hand through the angel’s short, dark hair.
“I saw you trying to push her away.” The angel clarified. “But…it does worry me, sometimes.” Dean turned towards him.
“We take turns.” he said matter-of-factly. Dean didn’t know it was possible for any person to turn as red as Sam did. He stood up quickly, crossing his arms.
“Lap dance?” Dean asked, confused.
“I feel the same.” Castiel declares, not looking away. “I love you, as well. I have since I first laid eyes on you in Hell.” He turns his head, pressing a kiss to Dean’s thumb.
Dean couldn’t look away as Jimmy strode closer, reaching out and touching Dean’s shoulders as he threw a leg over and straddled him. “Hello.” He said, his voice deep and rich, and Dean felt himself chub up at the sound of the guys’ voice.
I have your daughter. And if you want to see her again, I suggest you do everything I ask of you. The FBI agents you met earlier, I need you to carry this note directly to them. You will find them in the Happy Nights motel, rooms 3 and 14. Do not call the police, I shall know if you do and I can guarantee that you – and your daughter - will regret it. I don’t know exactly what they told you their names were, but you would do well to follow my instructions.
The water was wonderful. The hot water unknotted the muscles in his back and made him feel refreshed, even when it was used with the unscented, cheap motel room soap. He stayed in the shower much longer than strictly necessary, but Dean felt like he had earned it.
with the demon. Which was just all kinds of disgusting. She smiled at him again.
As a matter of fact, I do. CN
I'm a terrible individual and you should all hate me. But I promise I haven't and won't abandon this story. I've been extremely busy but I should be back now.
Dean thought. He should have had Cas leave the room before he took wing. But he had forgotten about Amanda.
“I’m so sorry.” Amanda said again.
“So how are we finding Andrew?” he asked. Since he and Gabriel had been the ones to find Andrew yesterday, he had counted on him to know. Sam shrugged.
“Should we interview the families?” Cas asked. Dean nodded.
“Dean, why do I not have any clothes on?” he asked, tilting his head. Dean smiled. He had almost forgotten that Cas did that.
“Wait, wait!!” He half-yelled. “I can’t kill her, but I can put a binding spell on her! It’ll keep her powers sealed away.” Dean looked down at the man.
Gabriel was back on the stage, but the next girl he announced didn’t do anything for him either. Or the next, or the one after that. He was beginning to get disheartened with it, but he could always find one thing he didn’t like about all the girls. He was about to admit defeat and go home, but then Gabriel said something that caught his attention.
exactly but it was close enough. The effect was immediate. All three of them stopped talking and looked at him. Sam spoke first.
“I know you guys came out to watch me, but the powers that be are telling me it’s time to let the less important people out on the stage. So, before I get fired, I’m going to turn the stage over to the lovely Abaddon.” The woman that replaced Gabriel looked predatory as she walked out on the stage. The song was a heavy rock song Dean didn’t recognize, but he could see how well it suited her. With her fire-y red hair and dramatic make up, she gave off the entire ‘Dominatrix’ vibe. Not Dean’s thing, but maybe that was exactly what he was looking for. Something to make him forget. He was half-considering buying a lap dance from her later, but the look she gave him as she approached made him shiver in an all-too unpleasant way. She looked like she wanted to tear him apart, but Dean knew that wasn’t what he wanted. Like with Meg, he tucked a few bills into her thong anyway. There were still plenty of girls to see tonight.
Ah. Dean was breaking up with him. Now that he wasn’t dying anymore, Dean didn’t need to be around anymore.
Andrew shrugged. “Probably because it’ll be the full moon.”
“Dean…I don’t understand. It will not take us an hour to pack. Why did you say we needed an hour? If people are really dying we should get to Wisconsin as soon as…” Dean pulled Cas inside the door and shushed him with a quick peck on the lips. Cas kissed him back hesitantly. “Dean…?” he asked, sounding hopelessly confused. Dean hoped that Cas would never lose his cautious innocence. He loved being able to take the angel by surprise. He gasped slightly when Dean started to kiss his jaw.
“Anyway.” Dean cut him off. Andrew’s eyes blinked to Dean and he nodded.
“Castiel.” Cas said, taking her hand. “But you can call me Cas.” Dean saw the surprise on Castiel’s face as Ellen used the grip to pull him into a hug. After a moment, Castiel even hugged her back.
“So what, we have two days to come up with a plan?” Sam asked.
“Who was it?” he asked sleepily. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and kissed him on the forehead.
smile, but what the hell could Sam know? There wasn’t anything to know, Dammit!)
“Don’t worry about it.” Jimmy said.
Dean sighed in relief and went to fix the baby food. He chose carrots (because if he was being honest, they didn’t really taste all that bad) and spooned a little bit onto a plate. He debated on warming them up but ultimately decided against it. He picked up a plastic spoon, along with the plate and walked over to where Cas was sitting. Gabriel adjusted the baby as Dean neared him with the food. The hunter put a little onto a spoon and offered it to the little angel. Cas eyed the spoon suspiciously, but after a few moments his hunger seemed to win. He leaned forward slightly and accepted the offered spoon.
Dean is sitting alone at the bar later that night when it happens. Sam and Gabriel had gone back to the motel, intent on getting some sleep so Gabriel would return to his normal, annoying self. Amanda and Andrew had disappeared ‘to talk’; but hell, they were both consenting adults, what did he care? He was actually pretty happy for them. After all the shit that Amanda and Andrew both had been through, they deserved some measure of happiness. Of course, Amanda was still married, but Dean knew it was an unhappy marriage. Divorce had likely been on the horizon anyway, and while he hated it for Katie, he knew the little girl would be okay.
"Dean and I are friends. He just left his jacket in..." Castiel started
“As I love you.” he replied, giving Dean a chaste kiss. Taking a deep breath, he squeezed Cas’ hand once and then began the slow track up to the cabin’s door.
“Learn to take ‘No’ for an answer, will you?” he said.
Dean hated seeing Sam like this. It lit up all his ‘big-brother’ sensors and all he wanted to do was fix it. There wasn’t anything he could do, though. They would have to get Casmiria to reverse the spell again before they killed her or else Gabriel could be stuck as a toddler forever. (Unless he grew up. Would he grow up? Hmm, good question.)
“I was doing some research, you know, looking for ways she could have gotten her powers back – because the binding spell we used was one of the strongest ones that exists and the only way that I know to undo is to untie the knots.” he said.
I'm so sorry about how long this took. I'm posting three chapters today to make up for it. (Since it's been about three weeks).
“Dean. What was that about?” Cas asked. Dean knew he was walking fast but the angel didn’t seem to be having any trouble keeping up.
“Role-playing game. Like Moondor.”
“Okay, Sammy go and get a cart. Gabriel, go find an assistant and ask them what we need to take care of a baby for….two weeks? And I’ll….well I guess I’ll stay here.” The two of them nodded and ran off. Dean stood there awkwardly and held the sleeping baby. Sam came back almost immediately.  Gabriel came back a few moments later, a pretty female assistant in tow.
“Here, I’ll take him. You go and get some sleep.” Dean gratefully passed Cas to Sam-careful not to wake him up- and went to find his bed. Perhaps he was a little eager to push Cas off on someone else. He had had quite enough of being a daddy. Dean kicked his boots off and fell on top of the covers, fully dressed, and passed out.
Comments? Kudos? Please?
Although he would never admit it to anyone, like
“Oh, yes, Daddy.” Cas moaned, digging his nails into Dean’s back. Dean leaned down and claimed Cas’ lips. The other man kissed him back with such passion it almost overwhelmed Dean. Dean snaked a hand down between their bodies and grabbed Cas’ hard member in his hand and started to stroke it in time with his thrusts. Castiel threw his head back. “Dean.” he whimpered, and Dean shushed him.
Cas locked eyes with Dean as he ran his tongue around the head and then took it into his mouth, tonguing the slit and then sucking him down all at once. Dean threw his head back and thrust his hips up into the heat of Cas’ mouth, releasing the grip he had on the sheets in favor of tangling them in Cas’ hair. Cas hummed happily and pulled off, lapping at the tip and then he started to bob his head quickly. Dean bit his lip and tightened his grip in Cas’ hair, fighting the urge to fuck up into the angel’s mouth. Cas deep throated Dean, never taking his eyes off of him, and started to hum, tightening his throat and lips around Dean until the man cried out. Dean had never been happier that angels apparently had no gag reflex. Watching Cas, eyes blown wide with heat and lust was almost better than the blowjob he was receiving. Dean was so enraptured with the sight that he groaned when Cas pulled off and gave him one final lick.
“I thought we were watching a ritual?” He asked, and Sam nodded.
“I got them for two reasons.” Castiel had explained later, once his shirt was back on and they were passing a joint back and forth on the couch. “To cover up the scars and to symbolize me ‘spreading my wings’ when I finally left the church.”
“You okay?” Sam asked. Gabriel nodded. They turned and walked to the end of the aisle.
“What do you mean, what are we going to do about him? We’re gonna hand him over to that witch bitch and then go on our merry way.” He said. In no way was he going to mess this up so that Cas might get turned back into a baby. Not that he minded taking care of him, not really, but he liked Castiel much better as an Angel. Sam rolled his eyes.
“You were in the missing person’s reports we looked at when we first started to look into this case. I remember you because you didn’t fit the profile.” he said, and looked between her and Casmiria. “I guess I know why.”
The road was blurred by the tears in Castiel’s eyes, but somehow, he made it home alright. It was almost a tragedy, but in the end Castiel was glad. If he died, he didn’t want to hurt anyone else in the process. Once he parked, he texted Dean, canceling their plans tonight without telling him why. He’d know soon enough, anyway. It’s not like Lisa would keep her meeting Castiel quiet.
“Dean…” The hunter held his hand up, silencing Cas.
“So…” he said, conversationally. “How did you rig the strollers?” he asked. Gabriel let out a giggle and shook his head.
“Can I see him?” Dean asked.
“So eager.” Castiel whispered his breath ghosting along Dean’s cock. It took every ounce of self-control the hunter had to not thrust up into Cas’ face. The angel rewarded Dean’s patience by placing his mouth on Dean’s clothed member, causing Dean to moan louder than the hunter would ever admit. Castiel started to kiss slowly up Dean’s body, stopping to suck little marks into his skin every so often. Dean squirmed a little but kept his hips firmly on the bed. He wasn’t sure whether he was allowed to move them yet.
He sighed and tried to get back to work. A few minutes later, his phone beeped again. He sighed and picked it up, reading the new text.
not really
“He’s resting, but yes. We’re going to be moving him out of the emergency unit and into a bed, but you can go see him before then. Follow me.” Dean did as the doctor said, following him behind the doors. Castiel was lying in bed, an oxygen tube in his nose. He almost didn’t notice the woman sitting in a chair by the door. It made sense though. Castiel had tried to kill himself. He was on suicide watch now.
“Hmm.” Gabriel said, contentedly, reaching to find Sam’s shirt on the floor and wiping himself clean. He rolled over and did the same with Sam, even going as far as to take the condom off and toss it in the trashcan they had placed by the bed. With all of that done, Gabriel sighed and cuddled up to Sam.
“Now, I will be more than happy to reverse the spell on your charming angelic friend. But of course, you will have to do a little something for me.” She said, smiling slightly. Sam felt the pressure around him go away and assumed Gabriel had released him. He cleared his throat before addressing her.
After what seemed like
“Haven’t you spent the last few months getting drunk?” Dean asked testily, although he knew he had no room to talk when it came to drinking your feelings away. He wasn’t even entirely sure what made him say that.
“Gabriel?” Sam called out again, and then a single stroller rolled out at the end of the aisle. Sam rolled his eyes and started to speed walk towards the end of the aisle, muttering under his breath when a stroller rolled out of the line directly into legs. Sam cursed and almost tripped.
You're no fun. DW
“I’m his fiancé.” Dean lied. The doctor looked skeptical but finally nodded.
Castiel took Dean into his hand and pumped him lazily a few times before sliding his hand down towards Dean’s puckered hole. The hunter gasped when he felt Castiel’s long fingers tease him before the angel pulled away and squeezed some lube out onto his fingers, rubbing it around slightly to warm it. He ran his hand back down towards Dean‘s entrance, circling the ring of muscle with one lubed finger before easing it inside, causing Dean to gasp. Castiel gently worked his finger in and out before adding more lube and another finger. He started to scissor them, opening the hunter up. Dean moaned and pressed down impatiently against Cas’ fingers.
“I don’t have to read your mind to know what you are thinking, Dean.” The angel said, turning Dean’s head so that the hunter was able to see the serious look on the angel’s face. Dean smiled and stretched his neck so he could place a gentle kiss on Cas’ cheek.
He wasn’t sure which option he would prefer.
“What do you mean you can’t go in?” he asked, his heart rate sky rocketing. Could he do this without him? If Cas couldn’t get in, then Gabriel probably couldn’t get in either, and that meant that they were without their two most powerful players.
Castiel knew he shouldn't. It was a bad idea, and had been from the very start of it all. But the first time he'd laid eyes on Dean, from the first handshake on, he'd been lost. Captivated by the green eyes and the faint freckles, the strong arms and charismatic smile. Castiel was sure he wasn't the first affair. And there would probably be more after this thing they that had fizzled out, but Castiel couldn't help it. He was already in too deep. He loved Dean Winchester almost more than he'd ever loved anyone at all. Even if it could lead to heartbreak. Even if it was
As soon as he had gotten through all of the buttons he slid his hands against the smooth planes of the angel’s chest. He groaned, suddenly needing to feel Castiel against him. He tried to pull him down on top of him but stopped when Castiel caught his hands and held them. Castiel stood back and gestured to Dean.
“Good?” the angel asked, and Dean nodded.
too much time with Dean. I never thought I’d get to hear you say something like that.” Gabriel chuckled again. “Gotta give that one to Dean.” He chuckled again and clapped Cas on the back once more. “I’m gonna go find my hunter and try to calm him down.” Cas nodded.
“Please, Dean.” He whimpered. Dean smiled.
Dean nodded. “That way Cas could go back to being his angel-y self.”
“Should we get help?” Sam asked Dean, looking around. Dean shook his head.
“Hi.” He said, surprised he’d been able to make a sound.
After collecting Sam and (a very reluctant) Gabriel, Dean and Cas climbed into the Impala to start the interviews. Sam had put together a list of all the children that had witnessed Katie’s disappearance. Dean decided they should split up, since, at least in his mind, it would seem suspicious if four different FBI agents came to your house at one time. Besides, they would get through the interviews much quicker that way, so they divided the list into two and went their separate ways.
“I’m going to cut her head off. See if that works.” The rest of them rolled their eyes, but followed him. “We’ll storm the front door.” They all moved forward in unison, Dean at the front and Andrew at the back. Nothing was going to stop them from getting her this time. This time she was done for.
Dean swallowed before he answered. “Yeah…uhh, the one with James Frampton, right? That Spencer guy we ganked.”
Sam nodded. “Think we can scrounge up the ingredients for that witch-killing spell?”
Cas feels Dean press against his back and wrap an arm around him. He must be doing this unconsciously, in his sleep. Why else would he hold Castiel like this?
“Mine.” Dean said again. He moved his hand down to unbutton the ill-fitting slacks that the angel always wore and pulled them off. Cas gripped Dean’s shoulders and pushed his hips upward in search of friction. Dean laughed breathlessly and moved his hands away only to replace them with his mouth, pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses along Cas’ cock through his boxers. The angel gasped and thrust towards Dean’s mouth as he slid his hands into Dean’s hair.
“Come on, then, Winchester.” he gestured to his body. Dean leapt up and quickly straddled Cas, leaning over to kiss the angel sloppily. The hunter positioned himself over Cas and slammed down, taking all of the angel in one swift motion. Castiel groaned and gripped Dean’s hips and thrust himself up into Dean at the same time Dean pushed down on him. Dean threw his head back as the angel brushed his prostate.
“Jerk!” came the answer from the living room. Dean moved around, trying to prepare the bottle with one hand. He had added the powder and was filling it up with water when Cas started to make noise again. He was trying to talk, but no one seemed to be able to hear him and the words just weren’t coming out right. Dean shook the bottle up and ran it under hot water for a minute, before offering the bottle to Cas, who absolutely refused to take it.
Castiel finally met Dean’s gaze. “We could die tomorrow, Dean.”
He thought. The elevator dinged, announcing his arrival on his floor. He steeled himself and then stepped out of the elevator, ready to face whatever was waiting for him inside the room.
Castiel’s phone was constantly vibrating, and without looking he knew it was Dean with all his questions. Castiel ignored it. He didn’t want to talk to Dean. He didn’t want Dean to break it off with him. And he knew he would. Once he found out that Lisa knew, then he and Castiel wouldn’t be a thing anymore.
“What is it?” Sam demanded as they turned the corner. Gabriel smiled and nodded over his Sam’s shoulder. Dean turned around to see the woman from the hotel smiling serenely at him from the front porch.
Dean knew that Castiel didn't mean it like that, but the other man's words still made his chest ache. As much as he would prefer to be with Castiel, Dean knew logically that wasn't going to happen. He didn't want Lisa to get suspicous, so he only went to Castiel's once or twice a week. He was almost positive that Lisa knew anyway, but he liked to keep up the illusion. He would cling to it until he couldn't anymore.
“Thank God.” Dean said, when he realized that Cas had finally fallen asleep. Hell, he had only had him for like six hours and he was
Or…well…maybe it was. It didn’t really matter. So what if Cas made him feel like he was in one of those cheesy chick-flicks Sam was always watching? It wasn’t anyone’s business but theirs. Dean shifted slightly, trying to alleviate some of the pain starting to shoot up his back.  He stood up and stretched, listening to the bones in his back crack from the movement. He’d been still too long. He sighed and glanced at his watch – it’d been four and a half hours with nothing. He was thinking about just going to find the others and calling it quits for today.
“So…I bet you are all wondering why I’m here.” Dean felt Cas’ hand tighten on his shoulder.
“I heard a commotion.” he said. Sam rolled his eyes and helped Amanda to sit back in her chair.
They all trooped back to the Impala and climbed in, Cas in the front again with Sam, Gabriel and Andrew in the back, Gabriel in the middle. The archangel had yet to say a word, ever since Dean had found a way around asking him for help. He sat there and glared at Dean, which Dean ignored. If Gabriel was going to sit there and sulk, Dean was going to let him. They had bigger problems than Gabriel’s hurt pride.
“That’s not entirely true, Sam.” Cas said, speaking for the first time from his position at the foot of the bed. He looked shaken up, but far from freaking out. He seemed to be handling this much better than either of the brothers were. Or maybe he was just better at hiding it.
Jimmy worked him through it, pulling away just as the denim got to be too much on Dean’s sensitive cock. He licked his lips, hearing the music fade away. He shook his head, trying to regain his head. Holy shit. He’d just come on stage in front of God only knows how many people. He looked around quickly, seeing Jimmy collecting all the stray bills around the stage and even stopping to allow a few more to be tucked into his thong. Should Dean be tipping him? He didn’t know, but he winced a little as he reached into his pocket. Sitting down, it took him a minute to reach the money, but then a hand on his stopped him. Dean looked up to see Jimmy smiling at him.
Next Chapter!
Ten mintues after he stepped out of the shower, he was out the door of his apartment, a travel mug of coffee in his hand and Dean's jacket thrown over his arm. He rode the elevator down to the parking deck, sipping his coffee all the way. He'd have to get more once he got to the office. His mind wondered, thinking of all the things that he had to do when he got to work. There was a sells meeting at 9am, and he had to have a presentation ready or risk enraging his boss. It wasn't the first, or the last time he'd been tasked with something so menial. His boss, Metatron, loved to push lesser tasks onto Castiel, even though Castiel was qualified for so much more.
“Go pee. It’ll fix that.” He said, one hand covering his eyes. He heard the bed creak and then the bathroom door shut and he sighed. The door opened and Sam and Gabriel walked inside, Sam carrying a bag of food and Gabe was carrying coffee. Dean spoke.
“Dean, I’m a
Out of all the lovers he had taken in his very long life, the one that was able to tear down his defenses and sneak into his heart was a moose of a hunter with list of family issues that could rival his own. (And that was an impressive feat)
about Cas. The angel is always on his mind. Castiel starts to rub him through his boxers and Dean can’t help the breathy moan that falls from his lips. “Answer me, Winchester.” The angel commanded in a low voice. Dean whined a little when Cas stops his ministrations.
Hey look guys I'm not incredibly late! Yay!
“Smart Sammy…but we don’t even know if it was a witch. And if it was a witch, we don’t have any idea where to find her.” Gabriel pointed out. “and...well, Cas is still a human baby. He’s gonna do whatever human babies do.”
He walked back over to the bed and climbed in behind Cas, wrapping an arm around his torso and kissing the back of his neck. Cas hummed and arched his neck.
“Dean, come on.” Castiel moaned, trying to push down on Dean. Dean grabbed Castiel’s hips to steady the angel before pushing himself slowly inside.
It was a very manly noise.” Sam huffed out a laugh.
“Would a witch have this much power? I mean….he’s an angel.” Dean said, gesturing to the bundle in his arms. Sam shrugged.
From: Castiel
Dean had finally convinced Castiel – his best friend and roommate - to come home with him this semester. After almost two years of leaving Cas behind in the dorm room during the holidays and feeling bad about it every time. Even if Castiel insisted that he was fine, that he didn’t care much for the holidays either way, and that he’d just be in the way if he came, Dean had finally managed to convince Castiel to come to his house this year. He was so excited to be able to show Castiel what Christmas with a real family was like.
Not to mention, he was
“So what do you think we should do about this?” Sam asked Gabriel in an undertone. Gabriel chuckled and nudged Sam.
“Cas, let me…” he started but was cut off.
The fucker had been expecting that. Dean was forced to watch as Jimmy made his way around the stage once again, and all the greedy men and women tucking money into his panties. It seemed like it was forever before Jimmy made his way back over to Dean, straddling him again. He kept his hands to himself, wishing that the stripper would grind against him again like he had been previously. But he didn’t. His hips were moving, but they weren’t anywhere close to where Dean wanted him to be. Jimmy’s lips were next to his ear, though.
Dean isn’t the only one that loses himself when they were together. Having Dean’s lips moving over his, their bodies pressed together, was the most wonderful thing Castiel could ever remember feeling. (And that was quite a feat, considering just how vast his memory was.)
“Yes, sir, Captain.” Gabriel said, saluting him. Apparently, the archangel had decided that Dean was forgiven, at least enough to talk to. Dean went on ignoring him. Instead, he slammed the trunk and walked off, knowing the others would follow.
“Dean, I am…” Dean cut him off.
Cas was asking to top.
“Done with the paperwork already?” he asked and Dean grinned sheepishly and shook his head.
Sam started to thrust harder, with more purpose as he neared his orgasm. He let go Gabriel’s legs and took his cock in his hand instead, stroking him in time with his thrusts. Gabriel grinded back against Sam, coaxing him deeper as he neared his own orgasm, his hands found their way to Sam’s back and he dug his nails in, pulling Sam closer with every thrust. Gabriel came a moment later, and Sam kept stroking him through his orgasm. Gabriel started to tighten up his muscles on purpose, working Sam closer and closer to the edge. With a garbled version of Gabriel’s name, the archangel felt Sam come inside of him and he rocked forward, helping Sam work through his orgasm. Sam pulled out a moment later at collapsed alongside Gabriel.
As of yesterday, he’d had a plan. He’d had a girlfriend.
“If we attack, we do have the advantage of numbers.” Cas said. “There are only three of them, and five of us.” Sam shook his head.
They were back at the hotel in no time. Sam, Dean, and Cas were all gathered around the table as they did research on various ways to re-age someone. Sam was on his laptop, and Dean and Cas had books. Gabriel, apparently worn out from his shenanigans, was asleep on the bed. Every now and then, one of them would speak up when they found something, which means they were mostly silent.
“So, Dean-0, what did you and Cassie do today, huh?” He grinned, waggling his eyebrows. Dean shook his head.
They were back in the bunker now. Mary had retired to her room, and Sam had gone into the library to see if he could find anything on the British chapter of the Men of Letters. He and Dean were in Dean’s room, watching some mindless documentary on Netflix. Usually, Castiel would be enraptured. He loved learning new things.
“Hey, guys.” Andrew said, stretching. He stood up and yawned. “What did I miss?” he asked.
“Don’t worry about it.” He shot Sam a look that said ‘if you ever mention this to anyone I’ll rip your lungs out.’ Sam just smiled. (If Dean had to guess, he would have said it was a
“She turned you into a toddler, Gabe.” Sam said. The archangel’s expression didn’t change for a moment, and then he pulled away from Sam’s grasp to look at himself. He held out his hand and looked at it, stretching his fingers out and then forming a fist. He kicked off the blanket and then looked at his feet, wiggling his toes. He repeated his actions on the other side of his body and then looked up at Sam.
be able to say words. He concentrated and tried to say one word: Dean.
Huh. That actually made a lot of sense. Sam resolved to have a talk with the archangel once they managed to get out of the store. Sam glanced down at Gabriel, who was walking quietly alongside him. Sam smiled to himself.
“Was she?” Cas asked, sounding genuinely surprised. Dean nodded.
That had been their argument, at least. Dean had agreed finally, but leaving the witch alive had left him uneasy. Dean felt Castiel move against him and he looked down into the blue eyes of his angel.
“Oh, yeah. She must have gotten something – probably a demon, I don’t know anything else that would have the power…” he trailed off, looking at Castiel. “Maybe an angel.”
A nip to his neck brought his attention to back to Castiel. Now was no time to thinking about Lisa, of all people. He brought his hands up and gripped Castiel's hair to pull him back. "I wish we had time for you to fuck me." Dean whispered, surging against Castiel's mouth. Cas was a fucking amazing kisser. He could make Dean forget anything and everything in a matter of minutes.
“No, ma’am, he wasn’t.” Sam said, throwing Dean a shut-up-now look. The witch turned her face towards Sam instead. “We were just hoping you would be able to tell us who did it.” She raised her eyebrows and laughed shortly.
“I’m not sure what exactly it could be though.” he mused, shutting his laptop. “It could be anything from a witch to a wendingo.”
“Be safe!” Bobby yelled. Dean ignored him still but he waved when he got into the car. He quickly went to pull out to the garage. The thoughts of Cas waiting for him to get home made Dean drive faster than was strictly necessary. In next to no time he was pulling into his own driveway.
Dean was awoken sometime later when someone knocked on his door. Apparently Sam had come home early. The hunter sat up groggily and slowly shuffled to the door, rubbing at his eyes as he opened it.  He was angry at being woken up and that made him sound harsher than the meant to.
“No, nothing like that…but…” she glanced away. “I did notice this woman the day before yesterday. The only reason I remember is because she was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and it was like 90 degrees outside. I remember thinking that she must be crazy. She was across the street from my daughter’s school, watching the kids play on the playground.” She cleared her throat. “I only saw her for a second, and then she was gone.” Dean and Cas exchanged significant looks and then looked back at her.
Dean had convinced them all to let him take the Impala, even though flying via angels wings would have been much faster. He told them he wanted to drive her because he didn’t know whether or not he would live long enough to drive her again, and since the only reason he was doing this was because they had forced him to, he should be the one to decide how they get there. Which was, of course, his beloved Impala. In the end, they decided it was easier to let Dean have his way.
"Thanks, Cas. One of these days, you're gonna believe me when I say shit like that." Dean promised, his voice gentle.
“Use your eyes, Dean-o. Fairview Hotel. Best hotel in Wisconsin.” Dean looked down, shuffling his feet in embarrassment. Sam chuckled and they all three walked across the street. When they stepped into the lobby, Sam ran off to check them in, leaving Dean and Cas alone with Gabriel. He was eating candy and not paying attention to anything until Sam came back.
Castiel frowned. “I’ve been here the entire time. Other than when I left to collect Andrew.” Dean got up and crossed to the angel, putting his arms around him.
“I’m sure there isn’t anything you can do.” Dean said, and put his arm around Cas and walked them out of the library, leaving the very flabbergasted woman in their wake.
To: Castiel
“Don’t make me tie you up, Dean.” he said. Dean moaned at the thought, and Castiel paused, raising his eyebrow at Dean. “Dean?” he asked, his mouth quirking up.
“No. You’re gonna come just from my cock tonight, Cas. No touching.”  Cas whimpered and nodded, changing to grip Dean’s shoulders instead.
“Dean! I need your help! Where’s Sam? We’ll need him, too!”
“What do you mean? You had to eat and stuff when you were a baby.” Sam said. Cas nodded.
“No. Only you.” He whimpered, and Cas was on his feet again, his face inches from Dean’s, a possessive glint in his eye.
“So, what, we wait here and see if they come back?” Sam asked. Dean shrugged.
"And?"
Sam’s thoughts were interrupted when he felt Gabriel let go of his hand. He looked down in just enough time to see the archangel’s grin and then he was off as fast as his tiny legs would carry him. Sam cursed under his breath.
“Sorry.” he said. “That was supposed to be for Dean.” Sam groaned and laid his head against the floor.
Castiel knew he was worthless. He felt it every day, almost all the time. His feet carried him to the bathroom, and he opened the medicine cabinet like a robot. He was too chicken shit to shoot himself, and he didn’t know where he would get a gun anyway. And cutting himself would be too messy. He didn’t want to leave that mess for someone else to have to clean up. The painkillers he had left over from last year when he’d stretched a ligament in his knee while running would do the trick. He could take the rest and just…go to sleep. Never wake up.
was going on with them, he just didn’t know what. It didn’t seem to be affecting anything, so he wasn’t that worried about it, even if it was a little annoying that he was being excluded. He could worry about that later, if they all survived.
“Good work, Sammy.” He said. Cas was showing his excitement by wiggling and making cooing noises. Dean almost dropped him.
“Are you okay?” he asked, once he’d bottomed out. Dean nodded.
Dean moved his hands to Castiel’s waist, soothing his thumbs over his hipbones and then going straight to the button on his pants. Before he could get it undone, Cas’ hands circled his wrists. Dean pulled back, confused, and looked at Cas. The angel smiled softly at him.
“Well, Dean, you see Gabriel and I thought that….” Sam trailed off.
that people knocked on our motel room doors?” Dean muttered to no one in particular as he walked towards the door. No one answered and Dean pulled open the door, his hand on his gun (because you could never be too careful). Much to Dean’s surprise, it was Amanda Wilson.
“Dammit, Cas!” he swore. Dean could hear Cas’ confusion.
To: Castiel
“Okay, so, the problem: We are going to be fighting Casmiria on her own terms, and we have no idea how to kill her. Cas and Gabe aren’t going to be able to use any of their powers because of the warding that Casmiria used. Not to mention, Katie and Amanda and who knows who else will be in the crossfire.”
let him live it down. Like
about him. Dreams that Dean would almost rather die than admit to. Hopefully, though, tonight, those rather embarrassing dreams would stay away.
The first thing that registers on Andrew’s face is terror. It makes sense, I mean, who wouldn’t freak out if they woke up in an unfamiliar room with four other men all of which (with the exception of one) are considerably larger than they are. Andrew was no exception. One of those men happen to be sitting on another bed to the right, less than three feet away from him, one of them has frozen mid-bite of eating what appeared to be a hamburger, and the tallest one and the smallest one were stand beside each other, both comically seeming to make the other appear smaller/larger than they acutally are. The small one speaks first.
“So that means…What exactly?” Dean asked. Cas looked up at Dean.
“My apologies. I didn’t mean to startle you.” Dean sighed and put his gun away.
“Ba-ba.” Okay, that wasn’t at all what he wanted to say. Dean nodded, though, understanding anyway. Cas watched as Dean walked into the kitchen and began to prepare a bottle. The angel noticed that Dean didn’t read the side of the formula container anymore. A sudden rush of gratitude flooded through the little angel. He was so grateful to Dean for doing all of this for him because he couldn’t do it himself. The hunter had literally dropped everything to come and help him. Cas smiled and now, more than ever, he wished that he could talk so that he could tell Dean exactly how grateful that he was. Never before had he wanted to say words more than he wanted to say ‘thank you’ in that moment. He resolved to try.
“Eager tonight, are we?”  He asked in a throaty voice, as he started to massage Dean, using the hand that was still in his hair to pull the hunter down to his mouth. Dean couldn’t help but to thrust into Cas’ hand. He nodded eagerly.
by Andrew’s sudden appearance that he allowed the small comfort his angel/boyfriend was giving him.) They all looked at Andrew expectantly, except for Gabriel. (He was still flicking through the television channels but Dean could tell he was listening.)
“It worked, didn’t it?” Sam laughed tiredly.
"It's you." someone said, breaking Castiel out of his daze. He glanced behind him, only to have his heart stop when he saw who it was. Even though he'd never met her, he'd stared at her picture enough to know who it was.
“Well, Dean-o, I just assumed you didn’t want to walk fifteen miles.” Once Cas had quieted down, Dean turned to the other two men.
Castiel was aware of Sam standing behind him, could practically hear the man begging him to stay calm, to not do anything that would cause Gabriel harm, but Sam’s voice is just a distant buzzing in the background because Casmiria presses the tip of the dagger into throat hard enough that it leaves a line of blood. Gabriel whimpered and all Castiel saw was red.
“You think we are going to find her by ourselves? We don’t know anything about her! Hell, Dean, we don’t even know if it
Cas chose that moment to put his mouth on Dean’s dick, effectively cutting off any and all thoughts that wasn’t about the hot wetness around his dick. His hands worked their way into Cas’ hair and he tried to force his hips to stay down. Cas hummed quietly and licked a stripe from the base, flattening his tongue as he reached the tip. He closed his lips over the head and sucked, moaning quietly at the taste of the hunter. Dean whimpered, sinking his teeth into his bottom lip, unable to help thrusting up into the heat of Cas’ mouth. The angel tightened his grip on Dean’s hips to him in place as he swirled his tongue and bobbed his head, his eyes fixed on Dean’s as he attempted to suck Dean’s brains out through his dick.
“Shut up, Gabriel, it’s not like you can talk.” Dean smiled at his brother. Yeah, he was a little pissed Sammy had kept him in the dark, but he was honestly too happy right now to be mad at anyone. Besides he and Sam could talk later. A strangled sob broke out and all of them looked at the former witch who was on the floor. They exchanged looks and wordlessly left out of the front door. Andrew followed them.
The smuffiest smuff to ever smuff
” They reached the Impala and Dean pushed Cas against it, kissing him again. “Mine.” he said possessively, kissing Cas’ neck.
Dean woke up to the sun shining brightly into the hotel room. He yawned and stretched, instantly looking down to ensure he hadn’t crushed Cas in his sleep. The tiny angel was still asleep, his little fist balled in Dean’s shirt. Dean smiled at how cute the baby looked. It really was adorable. As if sensing Dean’s gaze, Cas woke up, stretching and yawning, then opening his eyes and blinking a few times in the light. He looked up saw Dean watching him.
“Good evening, ladies and gentleman. I’m Gabriel, your wonderful and incredibly talented MC for the evening.” Everyone cheered, and Gabriel bowed. “Thank you, thank you. Now, as you all probably know we have a very special show lined up for you tonight, in honor of Valentine’s day.” More cheers. Gabriel grinned. “I myself will not be preforming.” The crowd let out a collective ‘Aww’, making Gabriel wave his hand to shush them. “I know, it’s a pity. But do not fret, my dear patrons! There are plenty of other – granted, much less attractive – performers here tonight.” More cheers. “Now, as I’m sure you all are very well aware, we here at Hell’s Angels pride ourselves on having a little something for everyone.” The cheers were louder this time, making Dean flinch a little. “So, without further ado, I’ll turn you over to the people that you actually came here to see. Ladies, gentlemen, and anything in-between, I give you: Meg!” Gabriel bowed off the stage just as a upbeat pop song (Poker Face, by Lady Gaga, not that Dean would ever admit to knowing that) as the silhouette of a woman strode onto the stage and straddled a chair.
“H-how d-did I-I get here?” he asked the room. The three men in front of him exchanged looks but it was the one on the right that spoke.
“You can’t honestly believe that Gabriel is my favorite.” He said
He sat his phone down, going back to work because he was sure that Castiel wasn't going to respond with any type of quickness. He was a very dilligent worker. He was suprised when his phone buzzed a moment later.
Much to everyone’s surprise, Sam answered the door almost immediately. He smiled happily at the food and proceeded to tear the bag away from Dean before him and Cas could even get over the threshold.
“What do you want, babe?” Cas arched as Dean slipped a third finger in.
“Cas, did you just make a joke? I’m so proud.” he teased.
“Sometimes, you two are so disgustingly in love it makes me want to puke. I mean, even when he’s doing nothing but complaining to you…you just sit there and smile and hug him and it’s so
“When he called me your attack dog.” He confesses, looking up at Dean. He sees the recognition there, when Dean realizes exactly why those words would bother him.
“Shows what you know. I make all sorts of sounds.” Gabriel kissed him. “And it wasn’t
Of course, letting Dean have his way lead to…complications. Fitting five fully grown men in the car was a major one. After a brief fight over shotgun, (which Cas won, much to Dean’s surprise) they all managed to squeeze into the Impala. Dean and Cas were up front, with Sam, Gabriel and Andrew in the back. Gabriel, being the smallest, had been forced into the middle, wedged between Sam, who was sitting behind Cas, and Andrew, who was sitting behind Dean. Sam had his arm around Gabriel’s shoulders, presumably because he didn’t have anything else to do with it.  In all honesty, Dean was starting to wonder about those two. They seemed to be spending increasing amounts of time together, and, more often than not, whispering together in corners. Whispering that happened to stop the minute Dean came anywhere near them. He knew
“RPG?” Dean asked.
“Baby oil.” he said. Sam shook his head.
"I do, too." Castiel agreed. Dean sighed, kissing him one more time before pulling away.
“Hey, hey! What are you doing?” a guy asked as he ran up to them in bunny slippers and a house coat.
“Relax, Cas.” He said. “It’s gonna be fine. No one is going to expect us to be social after riding for six hours.” He waited  until Castiel nodded at him and then got out of the Impala. Castiel followed him after a second, and Dean opened the trunk to get their bags out as the same time the door opened. He handed Castiel his bags and slung his own over his shoulder and slammed the trunk, already smiling as Ellen strode across the yard.
spell
“Am I going to get one?” Gabriel asked, snapping Dean out of reverie. Sam frowned.
“Cassie! Dean-o! I don’t suppose you two could come back in an hour or so? Me and Sammy are kinda…” Dean held up his hand to silence the archangel.
“Perhaps we are just wrapped around each other.” He said. Gabriel turned around in time to catch a soft smile on his brother’s face before Cas disappeared. Gabriel smiled and shook his head. As sickening as it sometimes was to watch them together, he was glad for it. Dean and Castiel both deserved the amount of devotion they had for each other. Gabriel walked out of the room and shut the door behind him. Even if neither of them had a key, Cas could always pop in. He strode down the hall towards the door of the room him and Sam shared. Talking to Sam after him and Dean fought was not on his list of favorite things to do.
“Thanks, Sammy.” he said, and then walked out and closed the door.
Sam opened his mouth and then closed it. Apparently, he didn’t have an answer to Dean’s question. That didn’t make Dean feel any better.
As Dean took her to the ground, said tea tray went flying, the cups and saucers flew into the air, while the sugar, cream, and boiling tea spilled all over Casmiria, causing the witch to scream. Simultaneously, Andrew threw off the rope and jumped to the altar and started to light candles. Casmiria looked at Dean with wide eyes.
“Aww, what’s wrong, Sammy? Gabe keep you up all night?” he teased. Before Sam could do more than give Dean his signature bitch-face, Gabriel spoke up from the bed, startling Dean.
Dean thought.
“I’m not sure yet. It’s obvious you would go through great lengths to get him back…part of me wonders just how…far…the three of you would go….” She trailed off, her sentence leaving all sorts of implications up in the air. Sam glanced back at Gabriel and then at Dean. All of them silently agreed to not say anything.
“Let me put on some clothes. You go track down Cas and Gabe and then we can get this show on the road.” Dean nodded and went to the door. He pulled it open and then looked back at Sam.
“No, I’m fine, thank you. I’m just waiting.” Cas said, indicating Dean. The woman turned around and gave him a once over before turning her attention back to the angel, giving him a 1000-watt smile.
It was ridiculous. This little human body couldn’t do anything but cry and move. Cas struggled to say something but every time he did, it would come out as a string of babble and Dean would shush him. But now he was drinking whatever was in the bottle and had finally stopped trying to speak. He heard Sam come into the kitchen.
“Wow.” he commented. “You’re heavy.” He grinned at Gabe and transferred him to his other hip. Gabriel smacked him.
“Can’t wait, Dean. Need you now.” he whispered, pulling Dean’s body back to back and wrapping his hands around his waist so Dean couldn’t move away. Dean’s eyes darkened in lust and nodded quickly, moving one hand to hitch Cas’ leg around his waist.
Cas was in shock. He couldn’t believe that Dean-Dean-was actually going to go into a witch’s house. Not only a witch, but the witch- the one who had turned him into his human infant. Cas remembered her all to clearly now. He had been at a bar, (following a lead on a vengeful spirit) and she had walked up to him and started to talk to him. Well, flirt was probably a more accurate word. Cas could tell that she wanted to…what was the expression? Take him home? He told her that he was not interested (To quote: “I am not interested in having intercourse with you. I wish for you to leave me alone.”) and apparently that had offended her. And now they were going to stroll into her house to talk. Cas whined and tried to pull Dean away, towards the Impala.
“Casmiria, I bind thee from hurting others!” She reached out but nothing happened. Andrew laughed once.
“What plan, Sam? We don’t know how many people she’s going to have there, we may be hopelessly outnumbered, and not to mention that there is a very good chance that neither of our angels will have any powers. Yeah, we can reverse the fact that Gabriel is a toddler, but we don’t have any way to get rid of Casmiria! So tell me, Sam, what exactly is your plan?”
“We walk from here. No one can enter this zone by magical means.” Gabriel said, his voice a little irritated. “Not even angels.”
Castiel was rolling his body to the song, his hips moving in perfect harmony to the beat. Jimmy strode around the stage, collecting a few of the dollars that everyone was waving his way before he turned and made his way back to Dean. In an instant, Dean was straddled again and Jimmy was going to town grinding and turning and Dean
“Jesus, Gabe, I already apologized, okay? Now move, so I can go and explain to Andrew what an asshole I am.” Gabriel didn’t say anything, just stood there with his arms crossed, staring at Dean. So, naturally, Dean did the totally mature thing and copied him, crossing his arms and staring Gabriel down. They stood like that for a few tense seconds before Gabriel broke into a grin and shoved him playfully.
“Look, I just…I wanted to say that I love you.” Dean watched as Castiel relaxed. “I know I don’t say it enough, but it doesn’t make it any less true.” He looked down. “I’m not good at feelings, I never have been, but…” he trailed off for a moment. “I don’t regret anything that’s happened between us, good or bad, because if something else had changed we might not be here.” He laced their fingers together and looked back up at Cas. “Regardless of what happens tomorrow…” Castiel stiffened.
“Huh.” Dean said, grinning. “Handy.” he reached up and pulled Castiel down for a kiss. Eventually, they were going to have to get up, and Castiel knew that, but for now he wanted to ignore the realities for a little while longer.
“Fuck, Cas, you gotta…” he moaned as the angel pulled back and off, giving his head little licks as he gazed up at him.
“Things in general or things with Cas?” Sam smiled sheepishly.
him.  And he needed him now. Right now. Castiel must have seen the look in Dean’s eye because the angel grabbed him by his coat, spun the hunter around slammed him against the door. Dean huffed in surprise, but the angel throw him around like this was always such a turn-on. Castiel moved closer and started to kiss up Dean’s throat, only stopping to whisper in the hunter’s ear.
“Good things, I hope?” Castiel said, glancing at Dean. “If not, I want you to know that Dean has a tendency to exaggerate that he definitely didn’t get from you.”
“It’s always been you.” he said, and Dean realized that his eyes were glistening. “From the moment I laid my hand on your soul in Hell I was gone. Ever since then, Dean, I’ve been yours.” He sighed, bringing Dean’s hand to his mouth and kissing it. “At first I never dreamed that you could feel the same way. But then you did.” he said. “I’ve existed for a long time, Dean.” He leaned in and kissed Dean softly. “But I don’t think that I truly lived until I met you.” Dean was the one in danger of crying now, with the way Cas was looking at him. “I love you, Dean Winchester. Thank you making me live.” Dean couldn’t help it, he pulled Cas in and kissed him with everything he had. His words failed him, so he tried to convey the message with his body. He was almost sad that he wasn’t fifteen years younger so that he could make love to Cas the way the angel had just done to him.
“Yeah, but at least one of them is a very powerful witch, who has somehow got her powers back, even though we bound them.” Sam said. “And she is not going to be very happy to see us.”
“Don’t ever change.” he murmured, pressing a kiss to the angel’s cheek. Castiel wasn’t exactly sure what had happened, but he smiled anyway. He wasn’t going to deny Dean’s affections.
beyond caring at this point.
“Fuck, I’ve missed you.” Dean could hear the smile in Castiel’s voice as he answered.
“No, no, no. You do that again and I’ll stop.” Castiel threatened. Dean groaned and nodded.
The elevator ride up was uneventful. Some days he took the stairs, but he obviously didn't have the time for that today. Castiel was alone, since most people who worked in this building were already hard at work. It was actually kind of nice to not have to wait on someone else or to have to stop at every floor for someone to get off or on. His own office was on the ninth floor, and for once, he got to ride all the way there without stopping. Once he was there, he went straight to his cubicle, ready to finalize and finish his presention. Just another day at the office.
