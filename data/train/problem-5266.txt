“Tony?” Steve asked, stepping forward, but Tony only backed up another step, and another, until the kitchen island was between them. That hurt, and a flash of it must have shown on his face, because Tony’s expression turned placating.
“Omega,” Tony whispered, and then he was coming, his teeth fastening sharp on Steve’s collarbone, hard enough to break the skin. His knot swelled, hot and hard and so big Steve moaned at the feel of it after weeks without, his body not quite adjusted to the stretch. It burned, but it was good, too. It was everything he’d wanted for weeks.
Tony shrugs, raising an eyebrow as he shoves a piece of pilfered brownie into his mouth. It’s still probably too hot for the average mortal, but Tony had killed off those nerves in his mouth long ago with buckets of scalding coffee. He watches Clint cut his dough and lay it into pie tins while he chews. The chocolate is warm and gooey in his mouth, with just the right about of chewy. When he swallows, warm chocolate sticks to the roof of his mouth like glue.
He stands up, putting the plate with its one measly slice of toast on the vacant stool. “I know you have an R&D meeting today, so I’ll let you prep. Steve can be a real asshole, but so can you, Tony.” He pauses. “But he’s still on the shitlist.”
The words land like a physical blow, but it’s a necessary one. Tony has been compared to Cassandra more times than Steve can count. It’s an old, tired metaphor. But still, the classics are sometimes classic because their lessons are important. Because they teach something new to each successive generation.
Gently, he uncurls his tentacle from around Steve’s sac. Steve makes a punched out sound, his lashes fluttering.
“Sounds perfect,” Steve said, and he couldn’t help from sounding adoring, because he was. “You’ve ruined me for anyone else.”
As soon as he’s gone, pain curls into Tony’s chest like a knife. Has to take shallow breaths. It hurts. It hurts so fucking badly.
Tony sighs. He straightens up, wiping a hand over his face. “Did you put the time in so Pepper knows?”
Behind his eyes, he sees Steve Rogers as he first truly saw him: pulling off the cowl in the cramped SHIELD jet, and with it releasing a cloud of alpha battle pheromone, fierce and unapologetic. There was something wild about him that was almost beautiful in that moment. A warrior of old, myth come to life. It was like returning to lucidity while dreaming and understanding, suddenly, the absurdity of the life you thought you’d been living. Steve was something gleaming and purely himself. It hurt Tony to even look at him.
Xavier laughs. “Well, Stark is incredibly open about his PTSD, and anyone who’s taken even the most rudimentary psychology class could diagnose Dr. Banner. I know from the files that much of America has read after you so boldly released them online that it is nigh impossible for Ms. Romanov to be neurotypical after the horrific developmental traumas that she suffered. And I do not imagine that Thor or Mr. Barton could be so different, considering the studies that we have done regarding routine work environment stress and PTSD in police officers. This does not at all conflict with my point.”
“Did you even think about the consequences if Loki gets attached to you?” Bruce asks, voice genuinely curious. He’s angry, Tony realises with a start. “One family spat turned into an intergalactic war, and Earth was the loser. People died, Tony.”
Steve doesn’t react when Tony walks into the penthouse, his whole body leaning forward towards the television. One hand is clapped over his mouth, his eyes bright and red-rimmed as he watches the screen. And there, on Tony’s enormous flat screen TV, is the security footage of their first time together.
"What kind of New Yorker are you?" he demands. He pushes play, and the swelling sounds of a big brass band envelop them, loud and triumphant.
“Steve,” Tony says, much closer now, and Steve sucks in a shaky breath though his mouth. It doesn’t help at all. Tony’s sweat is evaporating into the air, a fine mist of pheromones coating Steve’s tongue like candy. He feels like he’s drowning. He can’t breathe. “Hey…”
Steve watched in horror as two nondescript SUVs pulled up to the curb, a team of men in black tactical gear and masks pouring out. Their guns were immediately trained on the group of students behind Tony, a smart move if he had to admit it. After a tense moment, Tony began to strip, beginning with the cuffs to call the armour, then moving to his coat, his suit jacket, his shoes, his pants, his shirt. He handed his belongings to one of the students, a young black woman who looked as though she would kill the men if she had half the chance. When he was left standing on the street in his boxer briefs, visibly shivering from cold in Cambridge in November, one of the men moved to hit him, clearly displeased. Before he could manage it, the woman holding Tony’s clothes lunged for the man, knocking his feet out from underneath him and breaking his nose with a swift thrust from the base of her palm. One of the other men shot her in the arm, and the girl crumpled to the ground. Next to her Tony was shouting, hands up and out as though he could protect the students behind him with his half-naked body. He pulled his com out of his ear and tossed it on the ground, then pulled off his watch.
“He turned it into marshmallows,” Bruce says, gesturing with a pen. “It wasn’t exactly world domination and genocide.”
Natasha’s mouth twitched, just the barest corner of her mouth. It was what Steve liked to think of as her Tony smile, the one that appeared on her face only when she was trying to hide her amusement at his antics because she didn’t want to encourage him.
Tony shrugs, difficult to do with a super dense god draped over him. Something in him doesn’t want to shake him off, likely the part of him that shook at the sight of Loki’s blood splattered all over Amora in the wake of the explosion, his guts and burnt clothing lying in a soupy mess at the bottom of a charred pit.
There’s a long silence on the other end of the phone. Steve’s face is contorted, but Tony is too drunk to properly contemplate what it means. He settles for pulling the phone back and showing Steve his own shirtless torso, framed in lush folds of dark merlot fabric. He makes quite the pretty picture. He's done enough photoshoots to know his angles.
And then he stops, and the lights dim. Blessed darkness covers the room, and Tony wipes a hand over his face, gasping in relief.
“I got the impression that’s not what NIA thinks happened,” Rhodey corrects him. “Apparently, his equipment is mysteriously missing. I’ll let you know if I get anything else, but right now we have a positive ID on the body.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony smiles thinly at him, and Luke twists his lips up into a grimace. “You should go outside. Take a walk. It’s a nice day.”
“How are you feeling?” he asks, unable to help himself. Natasha’s mouth twists into a small smile as she heads towards the bar.
“He just said some uncomfortable truths. Nothing I don’t know,” Tony says, swinging his legs around to sit properly on the couch like a human being. Bruce’s face slips into a cousin of disgust.
Loki hums, clever fingers loosening it. Tony takes a sip of his drink as Loki undoes the knot, drapes it on the arm of the sofa, leans back in. Tony tilts out of reach.
“Not yet,” Tony says, mouth crimping in displeasure. “Things were kind of rocky between us for a bit, there.”
“Wait, Cap, stop,” Tony says, reaching out and taking a hold of Steve’s wrist with his free hand. Steve’s expression is determined, furious, and he turns to Tony with wild eyes. “Listen! You’re forgetting that we have a brainwashed super-spy assassin double agent living in the tower with us. Again.”
“I kind of thought we were coming up here to talk about…us,” Steve says, a sinking feeling building in his gut, because he doesn’t think that’s what’s about to happen.
“I…” Tony tries, then stops, not sure how to explain himself, or if he even should. He had no idea what Loki’s plan was, or if Amora could somehow hear him the same way Loki can. He didn’t understand the mechanics of the protections that Loki had wreathed around him. He’s flying blind.
“Little late for that,” Tony mutters, and Steve properly scowls at that. “Sorry, ignore me. I’m tired. Um. I mean, do whatever you wanna do. You live here too, now, so. Y’know.” He waves a hand, awkward, to the kitchen they’ve all been sharing while the penthouse is still being repaired. “This isn’t even my kitchen. It’s your and Bruce’s kitchen. My kitchen is broken and crusted over with flecks of biohazardous Asgardian supervillain blood.”
Tony watches him curiously, waiting. Loki is on the verge of some great secret, he can tell. The real reason, maybe, that he’s done...everything, really.  It’s not the first time they’ve skirted around it, but it seems harder for him to contain in these moments; when he seems more vulnerable, more open to Tony’s touch and word. “You’ve earned some trust,” Tony says, slowly. “Why does it matter to you what I tell Steve?”
Steve glanced up through his eyelashes, smiling when he was rewarded with the sight of Tony’s beautiful eyes half-lidded and desperate, so dark with desire they looked black all around, both pupil and retina. “You’re mine,” he growled playfully, but both he and Tony knew he wasn’t really kidding. Then he dipped his head, and swallowed Tony down.
“Steve, if you think I’m gonna play one-on-one after you’ve stuck your hand inside a New York City trashcan-”
“Rogers!” The wind stole his voice, whipping the sound away from him as he turned his head, seeking. “Sheriff? Sheriff Rogers!”
“Come on, Pep,” he says, shaking his head, “guys like that are always already unhinged. Any little thing is the catalyst for their crazy.”
Tony scraped his teeth over Steve, and it was enough to spur a genuine scream from his mouth, his hands fisting behind Tony’s head to keep from hurting him.
. The crowd was cheering, a single loud ‘we love you’ bursting out, and Tony turned his head to offer a wink to the culprit.
Xavier smiles wryly. “I’m sure they did. They had a use for you, after all. Or was it someone else who burned SHIELD’s headquarters to the ground?”
“Okay,” Steve says, embarrassment and dread curling in his stomach unpleasantly. “I…is this going to tell me something about Tony that I shouldn’t know?”
“Thank you,” Steve says, fervent, weirdly serious, and then he’s reaching over to the bedside table for the lube. “I just…the way you looked at me, like I- God, I…”
“Some of these machines are Strucker’s design alone. I cannot determine their purpose without more time.”
at you. Do you have any idea how much I missed this mouth? Watching you from the other side of the glass, every time you bit your lips. You’re so damn pale, and your lips so red, it’s like you’re begging to be used.”
Steve blinks, because he’s never thought about the team like that. Is that how other people see them? Him as the idealist, and Tony as the architect?
Steve loved this, the feel of Tony on his tongue, of being useful to his alpha, of being close and buried deep in Tony’s scent. But they rarely did it this way. Steve liked to be on his knees, liked for Tony to take charge, loved when Tony made him take it. He’d been selfish, maybe, with his wants. He loved Tony, more than he could even bear sometimes, so much he could feel it as a phantom pain: in the obvious places, like right under his heart, but sometimes in places that were strange. Tony would say something self-deprecating, and Steve would feel heartbreak spike along the outer edge of his hand. Tony would get hurt, and Steve would feel his own weakness unspooling tension behind the backs of his teeth, filling his mouth with slobbering anger. Sometimes, he felt as though he could slaughter every moving thing in the cosmos if it would spare him pain, or even if it made Tony happy. But Steve didn’t know what to do with that feeling, besides give himself utterly to Tony’s desires and let himself be claimed. Maybe that wasn’t fair. What did he know?
“Please,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. “You’ve already spoiled us all with gadgets. You built Banner his own personal lab.”
“Is that likely?” Clint asks, looking perturbed, but Loki shakes his head. Hawkeye straightens, slipping into serious, mission-report stance. “We’ll be entering in stealth mode, and I had JARVIS input the nearby flight paths for the next hour. We shouldn’t run into any issues if we do this right.”
“Ghosts,” Peter says weakly, and both Steve and Tony’s eyes snap to him. Steve’s fingers slip through Tony’s skin, once again unable to touch.
“But because she made this statement, you’re questioning that.” The professor nods, taking a sip of tea and leaning back in his chair. “You know, surely, that you are surrounded by a particularly unusual group of people.”
Steve’s mouth trails up his jaw, his tongue dipping into Tony’s ear and turning his knees to jelly. One arm slips around Tony’s waist, one hand hooks his knee, and then he’s being held open against the wall, legs spread, pinned like a moth to a board with Steve moaning into his mouth. He twines his fingers into Steve’s hair, something he’s always wanted to do, and the rasp of a sharp edge of cardboard slicing into his knuckles pulls him out of the moment.
“Touché, Captain.” Steve grins. “I would recommend you follow the park edge, in order to remain within a high surveillance area. If you run at your current pace, you can catch Mr. Wilson in twenty minutes. If you would like a more strenuous run, I can adjust.”
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve waits, albeit impatiently. Already, his eyes are looking away from the screen. There’s tension in every line of his body. “I’m sorry, too.”
The door clicks heavily, then decompresses with a hiss. It slides out, then to the side, opening to reveal Natasha. She glances up, eyes flicking between them. The corner of her mouth kicks up in a smile.
Steve opens his eyes. “Franklin, I need you to help me out. I need to talk to your dad, okay? Can you go get him?”
Steve counts out twenty minutes after Tony’s left before trying to shift back to his side, and every minute is excruciating. Because he’s sure, he is absolutely, 100% positive, that he touched Tony that time. He touched Tony without having to make himself sick over it. He hadn’t had to stretch the limits of whatever spell keeps him tied to Tony. He’d just put a hand on his neck, to try to comfort him, and he did. He’s sure that Tony relaxed into his hand. He remembers the feeling of Tony’s warm skin pressed against his, the way the tight tendons of his neck went lax under Steve’s fingers. He knows the sensation so well he can feel the echo of it, tingling down to his wrist like a live wire.
Steve frowns. He shakes his head against Tony’s forehead, noses catching. It makes him want to press his mouth to Tony’s, to draw their bodies together again.
Afterwards, they lay in Tony’s bed together, Tony half-collapsed on Rogers’ chest. The sheriff’s calloused hands swept slow over his spine, fingertips catching on the occasional scar, lingering over the mottled lines of Tony’s body. The sun had long gone down, and in the faintest glow from the stove’s grill, Tony could make out almost nothing of Rogers’ face. He seemed content enough as he was, half-asleep and perusing Tony’s body like he had nowhere else to be.
Tony stares at him for a moment too long to be comfortable, then pulls up the holoprojectors. He finishes his sandwich and licks his fingers clean, wiping his hands in the damp paper towel he’d tossed on the workbench and fiddling with the controls.
“Are we really gonna do this?” he asks, and Loki looks up at him, raising his head from where he’d been mouthing at Tony’s collarbone.
“And that’s what bothers you,” Xavier observes, nodding. He reaches out a hand, floating his teacup to him, and plucks it out of the air with delicate fingers. “I presume you were discussing your mutual superhero friend, in this instance?”
“Holy fucking mother of God,” Tony gasps, and he has half a second to appreciate the smug quirk to Steve’s mouth until it is absolutely otherwise occupied. “Oh my
Pepper levels a telling look at him, which Tony blithely ignores in favour of more yoghurt. Eventually, he hears her sigh. “You have Maria and Rhodey, and probably Phil. The contested senators are anybody’s guess. It depends on if Ross got to them first, and how much political manoeuvring he’s done already.” She pauses, and Tony glances up to meet her eyes. Her expression is harried. “Ironically, this was easier when we were a military contractor,” she admits. “We had more weight.”
—and seen everything from Ellen Page’s dramatic speech to Lace Bass’ surprisingly casual interview with Rosie O’Donnell. He knew that Tony had never really come out, either, just let himself be photographed with whoever he was with at the time and told anyone who tried to disapprove where to stuff it. Steve liked that approach, mostly because the idea of someone asking him about his sexual preferences made something squirm unpleasantly inside his stomach. It wasn’t that he was ashamed, or embarrassed, but mostly that he didn’t feel it was anyone else’s business. If he could step out with Tony and have no one say anything about it besides how good they looked together, it would have never been a problem. It was the people who would make nasty comments about their sex life, about how him engaging in anal sex must make him unfit to be Captain America, as though somehow he hadn’t been queer the whole time.
Steve thought about it, and the idea was appealing in its own way. He got to have Tony intimately, without having to worry about either of them doing something they’d regret. Biteblockers didn’t have a key, and they could only be opened when the heat had passed. A bit of technology on the inside made it impossible to remove while an omega was still producing heat hormone, although it could be overridden by the company’s tech specialists in the event of an emergency. Most came with a special override that you could give to someone you trusted. They even came in different materials and colours. Part of him bristled at the idea, considering the old Victorian tradition of collaring omegas, but he knew that a lot of omegas liked them because it felt like a reclaiming. Another part of Steve flared hot at the idea of wearing a collar for Tony, kneeling for him, serving him, and
“Over my dead body,” Tony says, cutting off that line of conversation before it can even get started, and Steve laughs. “I fly. I have a flying suit. It can go supersonic.”
“How long were you going to avoid me?” Steve asks. He presses a soft kiss to the skin above Tony’s collarbone, and the
Loki glances towards the windows. "You are self-designated heroes. Risk exists for you at every turn."
Steve leans in, taking Tony’s mouth in a slow, drugging kiss. It’s enough to make Tony moan quietly into his mouth, and when he pulls back, Steve looks like he’s ready for a second round.
Tony’s throat clicks, and Loki grins up at him. “You want me to prove my skills, but you want to run the show?” Tony teases, voice surprisingly steady. “Seems like there’s a conflict there.”
“If you entertain this nonsense and we lose not just Captain America but Iron Man as well, that’s not just a loss for the superhero community. All of his employees-”
Professor Xavier just chuckles. “I much prefer your honesty, Captain, as I’ve stated.” Outside, a group of young folks huddle together over their books, conversing animatedly. One of them has a magnificent pair of wings. “I’m just saying, perhaps you mistake the world view of your compatriots as the average. Your social circle is very niche, Captain, and comprised of individuals who have committed themselves to protecting the world, often at the expense of their comfort, their physical health, and their life. That is not a decision to take lightly, and it isn’t fair to expect that from everyone.”
“Why am I suddenly sure that your ‘common disagreement’ with Steve wasn’t common at all?” He sounds resigned, grudgingly amused, and Tony does not answer. He trains his eyes on the elevator doors as well, neither daring to flinch first.
He’d said it kindly enough, but it was too late for that. He’d already violated the most basic rules of both biology and society. He’d shown the worst possible side of himself to the one person in the world that was supposed to love him unconditionally.
“It was I who felled your would-be killer,” Thor says, matter-of-factly. He does not bother to hide his sorrow when Loki pulls out of his grip.
Steve waited for the laptop to boot up for a long time, not sure what exactly he was looking for, but knowing that Google was generally a good place to start. It took longer than he thought to get a computer to work after not touching it for over a year, but eventually he got it going, the little fans on the bottom of the machine whirring so hard that Steve was worried it would break. The StarkTech they all used was just so quiet. Steve had forgotten what it was like to have to deal with a subpar machine. In this, as everything else, Tony had spoiled him.
Steve wants to tell him not to blame himself, but he knows that would be a waste of breath. He tries to tighten his grip on Tony’s wrist.
“-but the FBI doesn’t do anything by halves, so even if he’s not found guilty, I can’t imagine the stain of whatever evidence they’ve found will completely wash out. I imagine that McCoy is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future.”
“I just told you what I want,” Steve says. His voice is plaintive, helpless, and Tony closes his eyes. “You’re upset.”
Tony detaches a pair of the standard enhanced-dampening cuffs from his armour, and Natasha offers him a small smile as they close around her wrists. Her eyes float to half-mast.
Steve reached a shaky hand out to turn on the intercom, bracing himself to hear Tony’s voice and sure that he wasn’t ready for it. He was sure when it came it would wreck him, worse than anything before.
“No,” Tony says with a wry twist of his lips, “it was my big mouth that did that. I said some unfair personal shit to him. He caught me off guard, cornered me-” Tony stops, realising too late that telling Loki he’s a little bit claustrophobic might not be the best idea. By the expression on Loki’s face, he’s already caught the slip, and Tony grimaces a little.
When he came up, Rogers was out cold. He hadn’t even touched the cheese, and Tony sighed and checked on the pot on the stove, giving it a stir and adding some more water. Then he piled the food onto the board, cutting a few slices of cheese and then running his fingers through Rogers’ hair.
“Stop thinking about it,” Tony said, and his voice was raw, now. It was the closest he’d ever come to begging Steve for anything, and so he turned instead and kissed Tony full on the mouth, framing his face between Steve’s hands to hold him there.
“Knock it off,” he slurs, lifting a weak arm up to knock the hand away even as he winces at the bright lights. “FRIDAY, lights at 10%.”
Steve eventually shows back up at the garage to work, watching Tony with a calculating expression that makes him unaccountably nervous. He tries to strike a good balance between coy flirtation and genuine exhaustion, but he doesn’t think he manages it. Worse, he catches Beth whispering furiously at Steve later while the man looks equal parts embarrassed and indignant. They both stop talking immediately, but Tony knows exactly what that’s about.
Tony isn’t listening. He’s walking across the broken balcony tile on bare feet, and his blood is rushing so loud in his ears he feels like he can’t hear anything. His heart is going to crawl out of his throat.
“This is a place of business! You can’t imprison civilians underneath SI’s New York HQ! That’s what SHIELD is for!” she’d told him.
“You’re an ass,” Rhodey says, and Tony grins at him and steps out of the workshop, heading up the stairs and towards the penthouse suite. He measures out the battle as he goes, considering weaknesses and gaps in the fight, where to place who. They’re outpowered, he knows, but that’s never stopped them before. He’ll just have to play the board carefully.
JARVIS pulled up a still frame. “They entered an area with low surveillance and shook the officers tailing them.”
“Yes. It was Loki, all this time, who had been ruling Asgard in Odin’s guise. I had declared my abdication, our father had never officially repudiated him, and our mother was dead. Legally, the throne was his.” He looks up to meet each of their eyes individually, from Natasha’s blank mask to Bruce’s furrowed brows. “He has caused a fair amount of embarrassment for the council and the royal family. We cannot accuse him publically without admitting to Odin’s weakness, and now that he has proven his point, Odin cannot rule without wariness from advisors that before had been content to agree to his every whim. He has proven his superiority to me as ruler of Asgard, as well. Ultimately, this turn of events changes nothing in that regard; I do not want the throne.”
He braces his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and for once he is glad that there is no one to hear him scream.
Steve must fall asleep, although he doesn’t remember it. He isn’t sure where he goes when he sleeps. He doesn’t know if he dreams.
“Well, yeah, he and the Captain could enter a bonding fugue after so long apart, and there’s bad guys,” Riri said, and Steve peered up at the closest camera. He couldn’t tell if she didn’t know, or if she was just playing dumb for Tony’s benefit. “Personally, I would like to point out that the building is crawling with SHIELD, and also some Hydra agents are left. Y’all can talk about this later.”
When he walks onto the communal floor at eleven on the dot, the rest of the Avengers are already gathered. He finds the dining table laden with plates of eggs both scrambled and basted, bacon, waffles, toast, and various fruit-imbued pancakes. Steve is standing at the stove manning a pancake station while Clint washes his hands of batter, clearly having been in charge of making the pancake and waffle mix. Bruce is cutting cantaloupe and apples on the kitchen island in a clear bid to try to get something more than protein and starch into the team. Thor and Natasha are sitting at the table already, and Nat nods at him and holds out a huge mug of coffee as he approaches.
Steve really did mean to sleep, but even standing in their bedroom and smelling his scent entwined with the faded remnants of Tony’s made him feel like he was crawling out of his skin. Instead he took a shower, again using Tony’s products even though he could hear his alpha complaining in his ear that they had different hair and skin types, that Steve’s was more delicate and he should be using his own shampoo. There was no chance of running out of hot water, and Steve didn’t know how long he stood there, letting the water jets beat against his back at scalding enough temperatures to release at least some of the tension coiled inside of him. His entire body felt like one big bruise.
“Is it?” the professor asks archly, taking Steve’s proffered hand. Steve is immediately charmed. “And likewise, Captain.”
“Thor’s fine,” Steve says, trying to soothe Tony’s manic babbling. He needs to deescalate this situation, now. “He’s barely even bleeding, and you know we heal-”
"I trust you," he says, which, wow. Tony was not expecting that. "If you think we can trust him, then I'm willing to follow your lead." His face hardens. "For now."
Tony hums. “Well, better than it was,” he says philosophically. “But some of the people that hate me are kinda right, even if they are bigots. I became a so-called advocate because I was scared. I wasn’t really an activist. I was just a coward.”
Steve reaches out, fingers closing gently over Tony’s wrists. His jaw is still tight, and Tony knows he’s still angry, but his grip is gentle on Tony’s skin. His eyes are soft as they meet Tony’s, lashes lowered a little as he meets Tony’s gaze with steady reassurance.
Steve opens his mouth, not sure what is going to emerge, but Peter holds up a hand to stop him and turns away.
“You know what I’m saying,” Tony says. For once in their whole miserable relationship, he’s sure it’s true. “This isn’t working, Steve. We did our best, and we couldn’t make it work.”
Tony shakes his head, lips pressed into a thin line. Syrup trips over his fingers and down his wrist, and he lets out a small curse. His tongue catches the drip, following it up over his fingers. He pushes the last of the waffle into his mouth, sucking his fingers clean, and Steve’s mouth is so, so dry.
“Steve knew people. He knew how they worked. He knew how they fit together. He knew how his enemies would behave, almost with preternatural intelligence, which was what made him such a fearsome tactician. But he knew real people, too. Citizens he met and spoke to every day. The name of the man who ran the bodega three avenues over from the mansion, who’d always made him his breakfast sandwich just how he liked it. The regular volunteers at the soup kitchen he volunteered at. He knew the name of the kids and spouses of every security guard who works the front desk at the tower. My favourite restaurant. What I want to eat when I’m having a bad day. What I want to eat after a gruelling battle. What show to put on when I need a break. What record to put on when I’m in a good mood. All of his eidetic super-soldier brain abilities, zeroed down to what kind of milk and sugar every Avenger who’s ever lived with us likes in their morning coffee or tea.
“I am Amora, sometimes called The Enchantress,” she says haughtily. “On Midgard, I have been known as Frige. You have not heard of me?”
“You’re always so sensitive here,” he murmured. He pulled back, straining his spine in a steep bow to get his lips around one of them, and Steve let out a skirling cry at the feel of his tongue laving over the pebbled, reddening nub. Tony sucked at him, his thighs tucking under Steve’s body and forcing his spine into an arch to better meet Tony’s mouth. “Maybe after this I can use the clamps. What do you think?”
“I told you; I need you to meet me in the middle,” Steve says, solemn. His eyes gleam bright and crystalline in the light, bathing half of his face in gold, and Tony can’t do anything but kiss him.
“But they said it isn’t likely,” Kitty reassures him, as though she heard him. “Hank’s just telling you how it is.”
Steve’s fingers tighten gently on Tony’s wrist, and Tony turns his attention back to him. “Can you come out from there?”
“Keep me updated on whatever bullshit he spins, so I know what to say when I next get ambushed by camera-laden vultures.”
Steve stands there for an hour, watching the minimal foot traffic on a Thursday night as it wanders to and fro. No one bothers him, leaning on the railing, feet crossed in front of him. The moon crosses the sky, hides behind one hulking tower. A taxi honks behind him. Eventually, he turns around and walks home.
“I dreamed of this for so long,” Steve confesses, not a self-conscious bone in his body, and that…that’s way too much for Tony to handle at this hour. Steve is too much for him.
“Because I don’t want to tell you why I hid from the CCTV cameras,” Natasha tells him plainly, and Tony’s eyes snap open wide.
Tony fights him, knees weakening, but Loki holds him easily. He lets Tony sink to the floor, then protects him with his body, breathing slow and holding Tony as he tries to match him. “What the hell do you want?” Tony snarls, struggling again, but Loki only shakes his head. He rolls his skull back and forth along Tony’s, skin cool and dry.
“Harpy,” Tony mutters, and Steve smothers a laugh. He swings his feet like a kid where he sits on one of Tony’s tall workbench tables, watching curiously as Tony pulls out an actual phone. It’s an old one, a burner, and Steve raises his eyebrows and scoots a little closer as the dial tone trills against Tony’s ear.
“Because you’re a masochist,” Steve says easily, setting the plexi sheet down. “The last shipment of balsa just came in. Where do you want it?”
“That is true, sir,” JARVIS says, sounding surprised and cautious, and Tony freezes. “Sergeant Barnes does not appear in the footage taken from Lagos, and due to the angle of your gaze and the severe damage to the display of the Mark 50, Sergeant Barnes is not visible during the climax of your staged battle against Mr. Laufeyson. As always, you watched the footage on mute, due to the increased speed. As such, there was no visual or auditory evidence of Sergeant Barnes’ present in any of the footage you covered with the Captain.”
From the expressions on the faces of basically everyone in earshot, his act is about as transparent as cellophane.
“Thank God,” Steve whispers, and then he’s leaning back in, and there’s nothing tentative about that. His mouth is everywhere, hot and warm and wet, and Tony opens his lips under Steve’s because he doesn’t know what else to do. This is wrong, part of him knows, and he has no idea what’s going on, but that wasn’t a lie. He’s wanted Steve for years, longer than he even knows, probably. He just didn’t think he could have him.
JARVIS obligingly brings up a still from the security feed. Amora stands at half size, shouting up into the skies on the edge of the tower landing, and Thor blinks at it for a moment before breaking into uproarious laughter.
Tony circles back around, peeking out from behind another pillar and firing two flares simultaneously at Amora, cementing it with a third missile. The impact rocks her back three feet, but more importantly, the resulting flare of light should be enough to blind her. Tony opens his eyes to a skirling screech, Amora swinging around aimlessly as she shakes her head back and forth. Tony broadcasts a high, wailing alarm specifically calculated to disorient, the sound bouncing back against the hard concrete until the entire place is an echo chamber, deafening and coming from every direction.
Steve hummed, the rumble of it echoing deliciously through Tony’s body. Steve’s fingers skimmed over his hip, and Tony closed his eyes and relaxed back into his broad, warm chest.
“Not just-” Steve stops himself just in time. He trails off, then laughs a little helplessly. He stares down at his hands.
Steve could laugh, but it’s clear that the man is serious. He takes a slow, considering breath. He thinks of Tony’s mind, his generosity, his wealth, his looks. He isn’t sure where Jim’s driving him. “That’s a big question,” he says, finally. “Everything about him is unbelievable.”
The traffic is surprisingly light for New York City, especially approaching rush hour. Tony takes them uptown along 1
“Upon your miraculous resurrection, the rights, trademarks, and patents associated with the Captain America image, character, and name were passed back to you, which you know. What lies behind this door is the remains of Howard Stark’s personal collection of Captain America memorabilia, products, and other associated items. This exempts anything on loan to the Smithsonian.” Here she hesitates for a moment, looking conflicted, before she straightens up and puts her hand on the doorknob. She holds out the StarkPad. “I am a busy woman, Captain, but I wanted to be here for this. Everything in the room is yours, to do as you see fit. Everything has been assigned a barcode, which can be scanned in order to attach notes to its file. If there is anything you want shipped, or donated, or whatever it may be, you may mark it down. Do you have any questions?”
“Good,” Tony repeated, tilting his head to the side like Steve was a particularly interesting puzzle. “Like?”
Tony grins as a path lights up for him, directing him through the maze of hallways and towards silver elevator doors where an empty elevator awaits him. He takes down two guards as he goes, the rest having fled to deal with the sudden Avengers incursion. The doors open with a ping, and Tony steps inside with a clank and a worrying creak from the interior. He checks the max weight, then winces.
"I'm willing to help, Captain, not an idiot," Loki scoffs. The prickling feeling disappears, now that he's looking for it. Tony grunts and lands next to Cap.
“We will find him,” people kept saying, but they didn’t fucking know. No one knew. No one knew where Tony was.
“Yes, sir,” Steve drawled, and rolled to stand in a move that was more to show off for Tony than representative of how steady his legs felt just then. He pulled Tony to standing, then traced his fingers through the mess on Tony’s stomach, rubbing his thumb against his slick fingertips and biting his lip.
A warm hand braces against the back of his neck, Steve’s thumb coasting over the knob of his spine. It’s enough to make his eyelashes flutter, and it comes in strange contrast to the bated anger he can feel rolling off of Steve’s body in waves.
“No,” Steve says, pulling back, and Tony’s chest tightens. He’d been hoping to avoid a fight so soon after Steve was back. Maybe he should have waited until tomorrow. “You’re right.”
The rustle and clack of Pepper moving somewhere at full speed with her entourage stops immediately. “Tony, what’s going on?”
Tony's face crumples into a vicious smile. Steve braces himself. "Jealous, Captain? I'm not allowed to make new friends?"
“Of course,” Cap says, looking resigned. The usual battle readiness is sinking into him, his shoulders rolling back, and Tony turns, trusting Cap to follow. The legionnaire takes up the rear.
“Steve?” Tony says, turning to face him. Steve reaches out, brushes his fingers against his hand for the barest moment before his fingers go right through again.
A familiar yellow and black gloved hand comes up from the floor, an equally familiar device glowing in its palm.
Steve steps out into the bright, loud world, and it’s like a weight has been pulled from his shoulders. He sucks in a deep breath, and it lightens him. He feels like he could float into the sky. He feels like nothing bad can touch him.
Tony rolls his eyes, but his shoulders slump a little. The tenseness in his body leaks out, and Steve wishes he could clap a hand to Tony’s shoulder. Cheer him up even just a little. “Thanks, Poppa Cage.”
“You have until we reach my office to answer my question or I am going to sign you up to teach at Global Game Jam this year, so help me-”
The glass door swings shut, and Steve takes a slow breath, releasing it. He steps into the elevator.
One of Loki’s hands slides down his chest, grazing the soft skin beneath his navel, and Tony pulls back enough to gasp a breath. Loki’s eyes are blown, green a thin ring around black pupil, and Tony hisses as he leans in and bites at the corner of his jaw, sucking a bruise beneath Tony’s left ear. His fingers trace maddening lines around the top of Tony’s waistband, and Tony squirms a little and cards his fingers through Loki’s hair, dragging his nails down Loki’s spine. Loki arches into him, their legs tangling, and Tony swallows and turns to suck on his earlobe.
It was like touching an electric fence, sensation rocketing down his spine in a lightning spark that made him arch, opening up his body instinctively as he went limp under Tony’s touch. It felt like being drugged, like Tony pushing inside him on that first, sweet, burning slide, like the full force of the sun on a beach in August. It felt like Tony had split him open down the middle, and when he pulled his hand back Steve reached out desperately for him, gasping. He hadn’t even realised he’d stopped breathing.
By the time Pepper appears in the doorway, Steve is rinsing his mouth out with water, trying to wash the taste of vomit from it. Steve spits and wipes his mouth a third time, glancing up into the mirror to see Pepper’s grim face. She holds a glass of milk in one perfectly manicured hand, and Steve knows, this woman could end him. She would burn the world, just for Tony Stark.
“They are, technically, doves,” he explains. Peter, predictably, refuses this request. Only the small smile that flickers concurrently over Tony and Strange’s faces hints to Steve that it might have been a joke.
“It’s funny,” he says, and the room quiets as some folks nearby blatantly stop what they’re doing to eavesdrop. “I was used to being invisible before the serum. So maybe that part didn’t bother me as much as it might’ve bothered someone else.” The ‘but’ to that sentence hangs unspoken in the room.
“Dick,” Spidey grumbles, not quietly enough in Steve’s opinion. Still, despite his manners, despite his professional respect for Strange, he can’t help but feel a little bit like he agrees.
“It isn’t, actually,” Bruce says. “We’ve got data on cortisol levels. You don’t have to be any particular dynamic to have a Pack. But you’re ignoring what I’m telling you about Steve.”
Bruce so rarely asked for anything. Mostly he just wanted to be left alone. What kind of leader would he be, if he couldn’t provide the one thing his packmate had asked of him?
“You’ll be in the way,” she said, which hurt, but that was kindness, too. Steve was good at killing, but he wasn’t built for it on the inside. Not the way the two of them were. “Clint?”
Tony blinks and meets his gaze through clumped lashes, eyes still damp. His pulse jumps in his throat for entirely different reasons, and he slides his hand into the hair at Loki’s nape and holds him there, watching the way his pupils dilate, the way his fingers tighten on Tony’s wrist. When Tony tilts his head slightly to kiss him, soft and chaste, he keeps his eyes open to watch Loki melt into it, his eyes closing as he leans in. He tastes like mountain snow, cold and sweet on the tongue, and his brows furrow in confusion when Tony pulls away.
“You kept this secret in jest?” Thor demands, furious, and Tony holds up his hands in the universal sign of surrender.
Steve sucks in a shaking breath. His mouth feels dry as parchment, and he is aware for what feels like the first time since he’s died of the desire for water. W H A T A B O U T S H R A
“Omega,” Tony rumbled, and Steve tilted his head back and closed his eyes in willing submission. “Fuck. If you were this desperate you should have come down to the workshop, baby.”
“Your hormones check out,” Bruce tells him, and Tony slumps onto a stool and presses the tips of his fingers to his eyes until he sees stars. “Your bloodwork is basically textbook, Tony. You’ve developed a nascent bond.”
More complicated sexy times. If the last spoilery warning applied to you, ditto for this one. Skip the whole section that begins "That night, Tony welcomes Steve into his bed again." It's short and v sad.
“These aren’t just people, they’re super powered criminals,” Secretary Ross says, and Tony glances over at him. “There is no facility on earth at present that could safely house these things. We had to improvise.”
“Easier said than done,” Tony snaps as another bolt takes down a pillar he’s just flown by. He’s close enough to see Cap, now. His blonde brows are knit in pain, skin sallow. He looks so vulnerable, secured to the metal bed in his civilian clothes. He’s wearing nothing but a white t-shirt and slacks. Tony dodges again as he scans the machines; life support is obvious, the rest less so. A supercomputer, cooling units, a DNA sequencer, some other things he can’t classify because Amora hits him in the shoulder, spinning him out and throwing him to the ground. The entire garage is bathed in green light, and Amora is shaking with it. “Shit, we’re sitting ducks in here. But maybe…”
Loki crawls over him, then leans in for an absolutely filthy kiss. Tony presses up into it, then rolls them, pinning Loki on his back and straddling his waist. He grinds their hips together, grinning at Loki’s moan. He grips Tony’s hips tightly, and Tony leans over to grab the requisite items from the nightstand.
He’d tried Googling “why does my mate smell different?” but that just brought up a whole host of strange things about yeast infections and smegma and STIs that made his skin crawl. He’d closed that webpage pretty quickly. When he’d asked “can you be an alpha and an omega at the same time?” he’d gotten some confusing answers about trans-natured people and gender identity, and he didn’t think that what he was looking for at all. Then he’d typed in “people who choose to wear blockers all the time” and stumbled onto some blogs that claimed to be a part of something they called the anti-dynamicist movement. And there, on the internet for everyone to see, on a post with over
Tony half expects Steve to have moved himself out of the tower by the time he gets out of the Sanctum and makes his way home. That would be the kind of self-sacrificing play he’d expect from the man.
“And say what?” Tony snaps. “That my hot, young, peak-of-human-perfection soulmate doesn’t want to fuck me? What are they gonna do about it? No one can make Steve want me. Even if they could, I wouldn’t…” His voice breaks a little, in the middle of the word. “I thought…I don’t understand.”
“Haven’t you read the papers?” he hears Tony ask. “I’m the Invincible Iron-Man. A little building like this couldn’t drop me.”
“Wouldn’t it be more shocking if I was loyal, if I stayed true to you and only you?” Loki simpers, eyes crinkled with mirth. Tony rolls his eyes in the most exaggerated way possible.
“Blackface is a bad look,” she deadpans, and Tony laughs. “But yes, to be delicate about it, there was no one I could have ostensibly entered the facility as.”
“Hush,” Tony says. He drops his phone to the ground, cupping Steve’s face with his free hand. “Don’t you leave me again. Don’t you dare!”
“I don’t know-” Steve tries, because he’s not sure if that kind of thing’s appropriate to say these days. As for the drink, he knows a losing battle when he sees one. He is Captain America, after all.
“They’re hell on your body, and Tony wouldn’t want you to unless you had to,” Bruce finished. He nodded. “Good call.” He waved a hand at the screen. “Look, if Thor, Nat, Clint, and a SHIELD team can’t stop these guys, you probably wouldn’t do much to change the outcome. Tony always has six different tricks up his sleeve. He’s been kidnapped more times than we can count by now. He’ll be fine.
“It sure does, buddy,” Tony had managed, his eyes wide. If they were a little damp, no one called him on it. Not even Sue.
“I don’t understand what you’re asking me,” Steve says, frustrated. He takes a shaky breath, shoulders shifting under his leather jacket. “I need you to explain. Now.”
The common kitchen is buzzing with talk and laughter when Tony and Rhodey step out of the elevator, hands aching and smudged with black grease. Tony expects Steve’s chiding voice telling him to wash his hands, knowing better, hating that no one says it and thankful that no one says it all at once. They’d bicker, about whether or not Tony had already washed them, or perhaps if he’d done a fine enough job. He stops in the living room, one hand on the back of a couch, watching the team bob and weave around each other as they unpack brown paper bags full of takeout. They’re a well-oiled machine, and the missing intercooler is conspicuous.
“Right. So he recovered easy, and I’m stuck like this after a two-day coma,” Tony said, and Bruce had sighed.
Zvezda moya is a Russian term of endearment that means my star, for those of y’all who are wondering.
Tony is the hero for the new America, sharp and beautiful and devastating. The people love him with roaring, thunderous applause, with no privacy and a million photos of him from every angle. Tony loves them back with slick grins and repulsor blasts, with fast technology and clean energy. It's no wonder, then, that Steve would fall in love with them both. He will make these new pieces, too, fit inside of him, jagged edges and glinting gold. He will hold them close to his heart until they cut him open.
The first thing he notices is an enormous square canvas filled entirely edge to edge with prints of his shield gripped in his hand, each varying in its own garish colour. Another piece of equal size sits next to it, with his face in the mask printed large and monochrome. Colour fields of neon blues, reds, and a sickly yellow have been layered over the portrait, and Steve walks towards them as if in a trance.
“A tempting counteroffer,” he says, and Tony closes his eyes against the whiplash of arousal slipping back into his body. He’s had an exhausting day and it’s not even dawn yet.
“This is bullshit,” Clint sniped, but he lifted the mask and fitted it to his face, shifting it until he found a spot he liked before pulling it back off and peeling the film from around the edge. He dropped the wrapping back in the duffel, then put the mask on properly. “I’m only doing this because you assholes are family now, and that breaking the pack up shit scared the fuck out of me.” He turned to Steve, eyes strangely fierce and terrifying with the mask on. “You’re not the only one who cares.”
“If,” Stephen says, face shifting slightly into something kind, “you wanted everything that happened, then I’m sure you will be able to work that out with him later. But right now, my priority is making sure that you are fully possessed of your faculties when you do so. Does that sound fair to you?”
, he thinks. He rolls onto his side, pulling the pillow over his head into his chest and hugging it against himself.
Steve shook his head, closing his eyes to block the sight of Tony so close to him and yet impossible to touch. “You have nothing to apologise for.” He took a deep breath, counted to four, let it out. He could do this. He was Captain America. He could be brave. “I owe you an apology, actually.”
Tony turns down the comms again, then pauses, looking down at Cap’s slack face. He eases himself out of the armour with a hiss, stepping down from the metal to take Cap’s pulse. His leg is burning, wet blood trickling down his back from where the plating cut into him just below the left scapulae. He feels like one giant bruise, but Cap’s breathing. His pulse is slowing down as Amora’s magic fades.
"You're a reckless asshole, and I need control, and what's why we didn't work out. But it wasn't just you. We've been over this." Pepper touches his hand on the gear stick for a moment, until he looks at her.
“Look,” Tony tries, “if you didn’t want the job you would have already turned it down. But you didn’t. You left the door open because you want it. So I’m telling you that you can have it. This works out, Steve. You said you’re just meant to cover for Barton. I’m working through SI’s transition. It’ll just be for a little while. A few months at the most. We can still talk. You can call me whenever you want. Think of it like a break. Did they have those in the 40’s? They must have.”
“I can see that,” JARVIS says, and he must have done the scan after all. “I’m going to create a sheen of condensation within the inner shell of the greaves and cuisses to alleviate the discomfort you must be feeling. There will be some dramatic temperature changes. Please bear with me.”
Steve nods, because that makes sense to him. He’s seen how Bruce deals with the Hulk, the way the reactor pains Tony in the winters. Powers often come with a price. He thinks of Erskine, lying dead on the basement floor, and thinks maybe he knows that better than most.
“No,” Steve says, rolling his eyes, and Tony chuckles. “We’re too late for that, anyway, even if I could catch something.”
Tony shakes himself, his hair flinging water across the wet tiles. “Sorry,” he chuckles. “I haven’t. Uh.”
“Gorgeous,” Tony tells him, and Steve cracks a smile. “You’re incredible, all trussed up for me like this.”
“Yes,” Steve admits, so straightforward that Tony’s caught between the desire to laugh and an unexpected swell of emotion emanating from behind the reactor casing. Steve leans in again, nosing gently along his brow. “God, I never want to leave this bed.” His voice sounds wrecked, and Tony swallows, suddenly much more awake. “You look…”
There’s a low curse from the centre of the room, and Steve gives in to the urge he’s been fighting for three hours and glances up to look at his soulmate.
As one, everyone in the room turns to look at Tony. Tony, who is busy bandaging his arm—alarmingly efficiently for someone working one-handed that speaks to years of him avoiding medical at all costs—does not look up. But there’s a tension in his shoulders that might as well be shouting “don’t look at me” for how obvious it is. After the day he’s had, Steve doesn’t even have the wherewithal to blush.
This is not how Tony thought this call was going to go. What's the phrase? No plan survives contact with the enemy? No, there's an even better one, considering the way Tony prefers to do science. He thinks it goes something like this: ‘In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is.’ Here it is in practice. His soulmate: a soft-skinned, weirdly hairless, blonde artist with a heart of gold and a stubborn streak a mile wide. An alpha born in 1918, a time traveller who's both 27 and 94 years old, who'd spent hours on Tumblr trying to understand why his soulmate was so tetchy about dynamics, who crawled out of the dredges of internet SJW blogs as an omega rights activist. Out of all of the infinite combinations of DNA possible, his hypothalamus had chosen the body of a man who would drag himself across broken glass if Tony asked him to. This is the real Steve Rogers, and he’s just as impossible as Tony had been told from birth.
“Or perhaps I was bored,” Loki says, and Tony levels him with an incredulous expression. “I’ve proven my point to Odin, Frigga was dead. What else did I have left to do?”
“He seems to be attached to me,” Tony muses, and Steve can feel hope building up in him again. “I think…” He touches his chest, right above where the starburst scar Steve knows well sits. “I think he’s tied to me. I think he can’t leave.”
“Ohmigod,” Tony says, recoiling as though she’s slapped him. “Who are you and what have you done with the real Natasha? Is this a Loki trick? This better not be a Loki trick.”
“Come on,” Tony says, and then whines as Loki adds a fourth finger. The stretch is good, and unnecessary, and entirely maddening. “Loki.”
“Captain, if I may, Agents Barton and Romanov are ready to leave. I would highly recommend that you let them go. The assailants looked to be entirely made of average soldiers. I am sure that they can handle them.”
If Steve loves him, he can’t possibly understand what that means for Tony. He can’t know what it would mean to lose what little of him Tony has. They laugh, and they fight, and they function best as a unit. Steve keeps him safe. Steve seeks him out when he wants solitude, as though being with Tony is the same as being alone, as if they were one being. If Steve loves him, Tony has always loved Steve Rogers.
,” Steve says, betrayal thick in his voice, but it’s Natasha that Tony’s watching. Her expression shifts through irritation, then tired resignation. She’s letting Tony see her, he knows. She’s telegraphing for him, just the barest micro-expressions across the placid, emotionless mask of her face.
Usually, he touches inanimate objects without thinking. It’s when he’s trying that he can’t quite manage it, and he doesn’t understand why that would be true. He can’t figure out touching Tony at all. He’d think it was when his emotions were running high, but he’d tried to touch Tony in the car at his funeral, and he’d been plenty upset then. He has better success, he thinks, when he’s trying to comfort Tony in some way. But then, he’d touched Tony’s neck to catch himself in the cemetery.
Peter rears back as though Strange has slapped him. “You’re a miserable, callous man,” he tells Strange. It’s a shockingly angry sentence from Spiderman, but that was a shockingly harsh truth, even from Strange. “At least I did something, instead of hiding in the arctic circle.”
The professor tilts his head to the side for a moment, considering. “May I do something unkind, to illustrate a point?”
Tony raises a hand, rocking it back and forth in demonstration. “He’s given me his magical Asgardian oath that he isn’t intending to harm any of my people, or plotting our demise. He also promised not to use anything he knows about the Ten Rings and my PTSD against me while we’re allied, but hasn’t sworn to being my ally yet. It gives him a lot of wiggle room, but it’s better than nothing.” He licks his lips. “I fucked him without my cuffs. JARVIS was on alert the whole time, but. I spent most of yesterday with him without fearing for my life, unprotected. And Cap’s probably classifiable as compromised, too.”
Tony’s mouth twitches. His eyes crinkle with warmth, and Steve can’t help but move a little closer to him. Tony’s eyes are dark, gleaming liquid pools in the yellow streetlight, and there are clichés, he knows, about this sort of thing. Fathomless eyes. Falling. Steve wets his lips, mouth suddenly dry.
Distantly, Tony can hear Beth cackling something about Tony calling Steve’s bluff, but he isn’t listening to her, really. He’s watching Steve as he pulls back, the bright red blush skittering over his cheeks, the way he looks completely poleaxed. And maybe, just a little disappointed.
“I had to fight these animals off with my bare hands,” Tony agreed, throwing the controller up in the air and screaming in triumph as he crossed the finish line. “That’s three! I
“Typically,” Strange says, not looking up from his work, “this spell requires something of great importance to the deceased. We do not have a material object that matches that description, so I had to create one.”
Steve fell back asleep after another orgasm, Tony’s fingers light and teasing on his cock as his knot pressed up against his sweet spot. It was almost like a heat, without the mindlessness. Everything was good. Everything was right.
“That’s what happens when you leave your mate wanting for almost a whole week,” Steve said, and he wasn’t pouting, he wasn’t. “It’s okay, go shower.”
“Baby, please don’t cry,” Tony implored, looking a little panicked, and the sight of his alpha caring about him right now, the sound of Tony’s voice murmuring sweet endearments, was too much to bear. It just made him cry even harder.
“What the captain is trying to say,” Thor says, expression openly amused now, “is that we have come to an agreement, and we wish for you to remain our leader in the field until our captain is once again fit for the role.”
Steve woke up with Tony’s fingers pressed inside him, three wide, circling maddeningly over his sweet spot. He was halfway to an orgasm already, the sight of Tony’s mouth wrapped around his cock getting him to the edge quicker than he’d have thought possible when he was so spent.
When he pulls away his head is spinning, and Steve looks ravenous. His eyes are black, just a thin ring of blue around the pupil.
Tony laughs, glancing at the nearest security camera. “Boyfriend material? JARVIS, what the hell have you been up to?”
It’s the closest Steve’s ever heard Reed’s voice get to openly fond. It’s the voice he uses around his family, his children. He reaches out and shuts down all of the unnecessary equipment in the lab, fingers moving over switches and levers. Eventually, the room goes dark and Reed takes his leave.
Steve nodded, fingers moving mechanically on the glass. “I…okay.” He put the glass in the drying rack, then turned around. “I should probably wait in the heat room.”
“Lacey is a…well, she’s a repeat,” Tony tells him. “I met her before Afghanistan. We’ve messed around a few times, all fun, and she’s never said a thing to anyone. She vouched for her friend. We’re clear.”
It’s already afternoon when a coffee mug appears at his elbow, smelling strongly of good espresso. He hadn’t heard her come in, but then, that was the way of it when Natasha Romanov didn’t want to be heard.
“Breakfast,” Tony rasped, and Steve glanced back over his shoulder to watch him retreat, putting the kitchen island between them again. “I need you nourished.”
"Well played," Tony mutters, smirking as one moment Natasha is standing in front of a SHIELD agent with a terrified trigger finger, between a furious Hulk and a wall of men who should be evacuating Madison Square Park, and then there's nothing but green and gold light. The bullet lodges itself harmlessly in a tree, and then Natasha is behind him. The agent is out cold. She takes the gun apart and drops the pieces on the floor in front of the rest of his unit, who quickly find themselves somewhere else to be.
“Sir, yes, sir,” Grace says seriously, offering him a salute. Joyce just rolls her eyes, a small smile pulling at the corners of her mouth.
Tony can relate. As good as it feels to mark Steve, his chest feels like it’s going to break open. There’s no coming back from this, not really. There’s no exit strategy, no parachute. Just the long fall into Steve, until Tony can’t fight him anymore. Until he’s subsumed. Overcome.
He wants Tony to be his. After all the years of waiting, all he wants is to clutch Tony to his chest and keep him there, warm and safe and loved desperately, achingly.
Tony moans helplessly into the back of Steve’s neck, then buries his head there to hide himself from the sight.
It is a temporary stopgap, but it is all he has until he can speak the words he means to say with his mouth.
“Your dinner is still hot,” JARVIS prompts, and that’s just not playing fair. “Shall I have DUM-E fetch the plate?”
“Kinda the opposite,” Steve says, taking the seat at his right. He pushes a frankly alarming number of apple slices onto Tony’s plate. “Eat some fruit.”
Tony laughs, turning back around and picking up his coffee again. He rubs a tired hand over his eyes. “Sure, Peter. Ask away.”
Tony squinted, but there was no answer that he could hear. Still, Flower’s ears flickered vaguely to the left, and Tony tilted his head down to look at the horse.
“Hence the smoothies,” Tony agrees. “Which, hey, my bloodwork is way better than it was pre-smoothies, so I think I should get some credit for self-care or whatever the hell Pepper is always going on about.”
“You’re right, I did. Sorry about that.” He glances around at the living room, but there doesn’t seem to be any permanent damage. “What happened here?”
“I think so,” Tony says. He’s had Rhodey, and Pepper, and Happy, but Bruce isn’t like them. Rhodey takes care of him, but he would have never given him a post-heat massage. Pepper might have, but they had feelings for each other. What he has with Bruce is closer to the bond that the omegas in movies have: a fierce, intimate, ride or die kind of love. He’s never felt anything like it. “Is this…I’m not sure I understand what’s happening right now.”
A/N: Aaaaand that’s a wrap, folks! (Pun maybe intended?) I hope you enjoyed this v p0rny tentacle fic. Now back to the serious plot-based WIPs…
Eventually, he returns to the worktop where Tony is passed out. He sits on the table, and he brushes his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Captain,” Thor ventured, “we understand you desiring to keep some intimate knowledge to yourself. But I for one do not understand this request. My understanding of Midgardian biology tells me that you must be in anguish without your alpha. Surely you wish to savour his embrace as soon as possible.”
“I suspected as much,” he says, clapping his hands together. Then he whirls, rounding on Cap and pushing into his space. “What
A/N: Look at me, actually updating! I haven’t seen the new movie yet (I know, I know, I’m waiting for the weekend so my brother can be out of school) so plz no spoilers.
Outside, Beth looks up from where she’s measuring a length of balsa against the table saw. Her expression shifts from amusement, through shock, then delight, and finally, into worry.
Through a combination of tentacles and arms he moves Steve until he’s draped over the edge of the tub, facing the mirror. He’s blissed out, moaning like a harlot when Tony handles him. He can barely keep his eyes open.
“You’re not wearing your blockers,” Bruce tells him, and Tony freezes. He goes back over the morning, and realises that Bruce is right. He didn’t apply anything to his bonding or scenting glands when he came home. He was too hungover to remember.
Xavier smiles kindly. “I think every so-called superhero should probably be in therapy, yes.” He holds up a hand to forestall Steve’s protests. “Captain, I suspect this is a cultural barrier. Therapy is not indicative of any failing. Think of it as mental housekeeping. It’s good to tidy up every so often, isn’t it?”
Lately, Steve often finds himself wondering whether he should be touching Tony at all. Some days, every caress makes Tony freeze, caught somewhere between guilty pleasure and terrified exhaustion. No matter how much he sleeps, he doesn’t look rested.
“Glass houses,” Tony mutters. He rubs a hand over his face. “We’ve never actually worked with them in the field. Cap and I have been talking about building bridges. The hero community is getting bigger, and we’re not talking to each other. It makes for bad situations when real disasters happen. Going out into the field with an unknown entity for the first time ever will be a shitshow, and we all know it. We don’t always play well together, let alone with others.”
“I’m an asshole,” Tony agrees, and Pepper smiles at him with all the resignation of someone who’s put up with his bullshite for way too long. “Does Rhodey need to be read in? Maria?”
“That is your job, yes,” Tony says. He drags the other pillow over his face, ignoring that it smells like a horrifically intoxicating blend of Steve and Loki. “Fuck. Fucking fuck. I’m going back to sleep.”
“Okay,” Bruce says, pushing himself to standing. “Okay, we can work on this. We’ll get you an MRI, and we’ll get Shuri down here. Maybe she’ll see something I don’t.”
There’s so little they understand about Franklin’s powers. He is beyond Omega level, but he’s still young. All they know is what they can observe.
Tony took a pillow, slipping it under Steve’s hips as he hooked his arms under the crook of Steve’s knees.
He glances at the screen, but it’s presently just a blank split view in preparation for Tony and Jim’s respective views from the helmets. Steve wishes Tony had told him about it beforehand, because frankly, he wishes he didn’t have the screen. He wants to be there, to find out who had done this to him and beat them with his own two fists. He does not want to watch from afar, a powerless victim with no recourse for action beyond waiting. It’s enough to make fury writhe in his gut like centipede.
But mostly, Steve thinks, it’s because even without knowing what Tony felt like under his hands, his mouth, he already loves Tony. He loves him so much it hurts. And it’s dangerous, that feeling. Loving Tony feels dangerous, like a cliff’s edge he cannot come back from. It’s always been just as alluring to his adrenaline-loving heart. He and Tony are wildly combustible, and loving him in that way had always felt like a step too far. To love Tony in that way means that he would own every inch of Steve, more than he already does. Even before his death, it still felt like Tony was a magnet. Steve has always been pulled firmly to Tony’s North Pole, always intensely aware of everything he is. Everywhere he is. Tony has been his home, and his first anchor to this life, and the abstract representation of his desperate wish for a utopian future that they both know doesn’t really exist. But sometimes, on good days, Tony can make him believe in it. Some days, Tony can make him believe in anything.
“Yeah, well,” Tony says, looking away. He wets his lips, stares out blindly over the tops of skyscrapers standing proud in the bright blue morning. “He’s still playing dead, and none of us know why. I’m not even sure
“You love the roof too much to never come back,” Tony snipes easily. He steps into the elevator. Steve crosses his arms and doesn’t move. Clint clears his throat, then glances up at the ceiling.
warning: Steve and Tony discuss the consent issues of their first encounter. it is resolved with no hurt feelings, but it is discussed. also there's more sexy times alluded to in here, but it is explicit consent. it's also not graphic, so imo also fine for sex-repulsed people, but ofc your mileage may vary.
“I guess I’m getting up,” he says, feeling wrung-out and beat to hell. “Might as well head down to the workshop if I’m gonna be wasting my time.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” JARVIS says primly, and Steve grins for what feels like the first time in years.
“It’s not your shield without the paint, Cap,” he’d said, looking incredulous. “You have to know that. It’s a symbol of hope and freedom and other patriotic bullshit. People see that shield emerging out of the smoke, and it tells them they’re gonna be okay.”
“Alright,” Xavier says, soothing. “We can come back to this, later. How are you feeling? Any nightmares? Do you still feel unsafe on your morning run?”
“Let me make something very clear, Captain,” she says, folding the StarkPad into its case and tucking it under her arm. “You are here only by the grace, blood, and sweat of Stark Industries. Doctor Erskine’s original project succeeded because of Stark Industries technology, your legacy ballooned instead of fading into oblivion largely because of Stark Industries’ licensing and distribution of Captain America merchandise, and you were only found in the ice because Howard Stark made sure that said licensing and distribution of Captain America patented materials funded the search for your remains into perpetuity. You have a home, and a job, and a shield because of Stark Industries. You are paid by Stark Industries, and any tech that you have on your person, the very uniform that you wear into battle, was personally designed by Tony. In short, Howard and Tony Stark are the only reason that you exist, as you are, right now. They are why you are alive.”
“That’s the best way anyone’s stolen intel from me,” Tony observes, and Loki slits his eyes open to look at him. “You just wanted to know why your magic stick of destiny didn’t work on me, and this was the easiest way to do it.”
For the most part, Steve’s avoided places that featured heavily in his life from Before. He’d known, in some instinctual way, that he wasn’t quite ready. It was why SHIELD had put him up in a little cabin in the woods for several months. Everything in the new world is bright and fast and loud. Even now, he dreads leaving the tower, even when it’s to help people in need. The city in recovery is twice as overwhelming; jackhammers, and cranes, and thousands of memorials full of flowers and candles and photos of the dead everywhere he looks. It’s enough to make him want to crawl back into the woods and stay there until the ringing in his head is quieted once more by the crickets and the night owls—the sound of the wind through the trees.
Tony lets out a slow breath. He closes his eyes, breathes in once, then out. “Why are you telling me this, now?”
Sue, predictably, leaves without another word. The last thing Steve sees is Franklin waving at him over his shoulder. He waves back until the boy is out of sight.
“I was warned,” she says. She glances at Tony, a thoughtful expression on her face. “And I was the one who told him to do it.”
“Well, from what I’ve heard, it doesn’t sound like Odin was always wise,” Tony points out, resolutely not thinking of empty halls, of the clink of ice in a glass, the sounds of muffled shouting. “It sounds like he was an asshole, and then he learned something. That’s not too unlike you.”
Steve steels himself and walks over towards Stark. He’s about to climb into his ostentatious car, but then the man pauses, his hand on the handle of the car door. He turns to Steve, and Steve reaches a hand out to shake. Surprisingly, Stark reaches back.
Steve’s frowning again. “What did I do wrong this time?” he asks, tiredly, and that’s the answer, isn’t it? That’s Tony’s answer, right there.
Steve pulls off immediately, a sheepish expression warring with one of absolute satiated smugness. “Mm,” he says, pillowing his head on Tony’s thigh, and Tony can’t deal with that.
Steve’s pretty sure his face was red as a tomato by the time he left the bookshop, but the young man hadn’t said anything about it. If he’d recognised Steve, he didn’t say anything about that either. Towards the end, though, he’d also quietly handed Steve a book about questioning your sexuality when you’re an alpha from a traditional background, and something called “alpha-supremacy.” Steve has never heard the term before, but he’s pretty sure he gets the gist. He’s probably going to read that one next.
Tony sighs. He’s still been reticent to tell people about Steve, even now when he has evidence and witnesses to back his claim. With a few gestures, he brings up more files: crime scene photos, ME reports, DNA testing. “These were a warm-up,” he deflects. “To get noticed. Appetisers.”
“I don’t really think I agree with your metaphor, Professor.” Steve rubs a hand over his face. “What does this mean? Am I clear for the field?”
Steve takes a swift, shaky breath. He makes himself keep his hand where it is. “I figured as much,” he says, even as he can make it.
“I know,” Tony says, holding up a hand. He takes another bite of his sandwich, and Steve stares at him, brow furrowed. “But if we’re such a mess, do you really think it’s a good idea to get tangled up in something even more complicated right now?”
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Tony says, waving his free hand. “Reed was just talking shit. The fault is mine.”
“Not really,” he admitted. He grabbed a banana from the fruit bowl, peeling it and glancing over the headlines spread out on the kitchen island. He took a few bites and turned the arts section over. “Anything interesting?”
Tony turns that over for a moment in his head, considering. Sure, they joke a bit at Thor’s expense, but the man takes it all with good-natured aplomb. And there are moments, too, like this one; where Tony can see the age of him, peeking through like the copper under gold plating.
“He likes her, I think,” Tony says, watching as Loki’s blade presses warningly under Natasha’s chin. She raises her hands immediately, dropping her own knife, and Loki smiles rakishly at her and pulls away, holding out a hand. As she takes it, her broken skin reknits itself, thin trickles of blood slowing and then stopping altogether.
“So the alternative is to never ask for what you want when it matters?” Bruce asks him. “You’re not the autocratic leader of America, Tony. You act like you’re one step away from becoming a supervillain-”
“So I ran with the info you gave me, put some feelers out. There have been two deaths in the last year that match the MO, but they’re pretty low-level, which is why it took a sec for them to register.” Beth gestures to a holoscreen and does something on her phone, obviously sending Friday the files. A photo of an androgynous young East Asian person with short green hair pops up. “Thanks Fri. This is Avery Yamashita, an environmentalist lobbyist and podcaster. Killed quietly on their way home from work. It was investigated as a possible hate crime, then mysteriously classed as a mugging gone wrong, even though there was $36 in cash left in their wallet. Supposedly the cops couldn’t find a phone or laptop and that’s the motive. Can’t really tell if it’s corruption and someone was paid off or it’s just your garden-variety transphobia from the Baltimore PD, but I’m betting on the former.”
“That’s not a fair question, Cap,” he said, finally. It was quiet, defeated, and before Steve knew it he was moving, walking around the island and taking Tony’s wrists in his hands. “What-”
The line clicks off, but it's too late. Steve is already laughing too hard to breathe, loud barks of it echoing down the empty urban canyons and over the park's green canopy across the street. He takes a moment to plant his feet, hands on his hips as he arches back and laughs, and laughs, and laughs.
“So he twisted the knife in your insecurities.” Bruce’s voice is dark, and Tony shivers. “You must’ve said something nasty.”
“Well, now you have Loki to do that bit for you,” Pepper says, smiling a little, and Tony groans and rubs at his brows with one hand. He offers Pepper a napkin. “Is Natasha coming?”
“I have the cars now, Captain.” Steve watched as the view switched, blinking quickly between different grainy cameras, tracking the SUVs as they blazed through the city streets, the police hot on their trail. “The proper authorities have been notified. Thor has already left, as he can fly faster than the team can assemble to the quinjet. He is heading towards them as we speak. SHIELD is already sending out a team.”
“Tell me when you’re ready for me. I’ll call SHIELD for clean-up.” Bruce wasn’t even trying to hide his laughter.
“Hey,” Tony says, awkward. He scratches at his facial hair. “Everything’s fine. I think. I’m, uh. I’m calling in that favour you keep saying you owe me.”
“I’d recommend just taking off the entire firing mechanism,” he says, pointing to Rhodey’s halved shoulder guns. “You’ll have to go without looking like a poorly dressed tank.”
Natasha tipped her head to the side, acknowledgement and considering both at once. “Because you were exposed to us without your consent. It only seemed right, to tip the balance back in the correct direction.”
Tony pressed two fingers into his mouth, smoothing over his tongue, and Steve moaned and let him. He was pressing too hard for Steve to suck, just rubbing his fingers slow over the soft pad of Steve’s tongue, and Steve moaned at how helpless and strung-up and used he felt. He wanted Tony’s cock, but this was good, too. He was being good for Tony. He could be good.
“Let me show you, alpha,” Steve pleaded, one thumb following the dark line of hair from Tony’s navel to his waistband. “Please.”
“No,” Steve says, blinking the moisture out of his eyes, and now Tony just feels like an asshole, He grabs hold of Tony’s biceps with fingers that are a little too firm for comfort, desperate and pleading. “Stay. Please, stay. I can’t- I need-…”
He’s caught between letting Tony drag him around behind him, dizzy and in pain, or shifting himself over to stay with his body, but he decides that there isn’t anything he can do to stop him. And he’s been meaning to try climbing back into his body, to see if he can affect it in some way.
He is not feeling particularly charitable towards Tony’s self-deprecation. Instead, he waits while Tony and Friday do a bit of digital sleuthing, trying to find a connection between Roxxon’s lab and Steve’s murder. He lets one hour slide by and then he wraps a steady arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him meaningfully away from the console and pressing his nose behind Tony’s ear.
“You know,” he said, “this isn’t…I mean. I really…” He stopped, pulled the cabinet door open. He fetched a mixing bowl and a whisk.
Tony looks away, and Steve watches the motion of his throat as he swallows. He tilts his head back to look at the starless sky.
Xavier shrugs. “The one that feels true to you,” he replies easily. He turns back to the rubble, where Tony is ready to be lifted out of the debris and brought back into the light of the sun. Steve moves closer, just to see Tony’s face as he pops the faceplate, his beatific grin as he quips, “Miss me?” In this place between memory and vision, he is both watching and holding one of Tony’s precious gauntlets, is both pulling him out of the rubble to clutch in a hug and wincing at the fact that Thor had to be the one to grab the girl whose arm would soon be amputated.
TonyandSteve. SteveandTony. They become partners. In battle. As friends. Somewhere, through all the bickering and the drag out fights and the alcohol and coffee and the laughter, they meld together to form something new.
“You, Pepper, and Rhodes used to be a Pack before he was deployed. That’s very common. Families, high school and college friend groups. Adults not having proper Packs and being socially maladjusted because of it is practically
“Did he not tell you how he first fell from the bifrost?” Thor asks, expression cruelly triumphant, and Tony swallows his tongue. “You thought wrong, Tony Stark.”
“It’s normal for mates to have strong reactions when they meet,” Bruce says patiently. “He had no idea what he was feeling, Tony. He’s been through a trauma. Give the man a break.”
“Okay.” Tony holds out his hand. Stephen takes it, a portal opening in the air behind him, and then they’re through and gone.
This was Pepper. All of this, every moment was Pepper, teaching him that it was not Tony’s benevolence that he should trust, but her retribution and that of his loved ones trailing behind Tony like a caravan of war, the flags streaming high and uncowed by the magnificence of Captain America. This was Pepper, showing him exactly where he belonged in the larger scheme of Tony’s world.
"No," Steve says, shaking his head. It's an old game, but they have yet to run out of new things for Steve to learn about. Tony looks at him with mock indignation.
“What are you saying please for, hmm?” Tony rumbled, and Steve gasped as Tony ground down over his sweet spot and stars burst from behind his eyelids.
Tony’s mouth twists. He takes a long sip of coffee, scorching and black as he likes it. Bruce waits, sitting on a stool and sipping his tea. Dummy is hovering, and Bruce has one hand on his strut, thumb brushing back and forth ineffectually in a strange affectionate approximation of petting. He looks comfortable. Tony knows better than to try to wait him out.
“I’m a futurist,” Tony quips, a token protest. Steve’s fingers tighten on his hip, a delicious burn before he remembers himself and lets go. “I’m here, Steve. You’ve got me right where you want me.”
“Pleasant Hill?” Steve asks, and Tony sighs. He turns around to look at him. Steve’s retreated into himself, his arms folded across his chest. He looks small, somehow, and when he turns his eyes on Tony they’re lost, almost pleading. “Could you…um.”
Steve glances to his left. Xavier stands next to him on his own two feet, hands folded behind his back. The smile that he gifts Steve with is kind, but somehow wry.
“And, when is that gonna be?” Tony frowns, holding out his wrists. “Are you gonna do something about this?”
“’Cause it’s always you,” Steve murmurs, closing his eyes, because he can’t bear looking at Tony any longer. He rests his forehead on his bent wrists, incapable and devastated, as always, by Tony’s excruciating self-deprecation and selflessness. “You’re always the one not taking care of yourself.”
But instead, what he says is: “I don’t know.” He remembers Tony dying, over and over and over again. He’s not sure he’s ready, yet, to see Tony jump off a building without the suit, or take a missile to the chest. “Tony always acts like the best way to come back from this sort of thing is to jump right into it. If something scares him, he’ll build an army to crush it and then go out and call it to his doorstep.” He doesn’t know if he’s that kind of man.
He can feel Steve talking, but he can’t hear him. Steve nods against his face. He sweeps his hand down Tony’s back, presses his fingers into the dimples at the base of his spine. It’s his first time touching them, and already it’s his favourite place to put his hands.
to Tony. What a fucking plot twist. “If I had completed the mission, as ordered, I could have disabled Hasegawa. But I didn’t, and that’s on me.”
“Can you see me?” he asked. There were still strains of fighting happening around him now, but Widow seemed to be watching his six well enough. He had to fight off a few more goons, but he stayed put. “Can Tony see me?”
Steve closes his eyes, just for a second. He takes a shaky breath. He’s pretty sure he’s in actual shock.
on the three dollar cart at The Strand. It was a dogeared little thing. Someone had loved it dearly, and there were notes written in all the margins in a pale, thin pencil, and he’d thought it would be a quick read. Something easy to page through in the park with a cup of coffee and then bring back, maybe for Wanda or someone else to look at. Poetry is always hit or miss for Steve: either he loves it dearly, or he wants nothing to do with it.
