John scuffed his boot, feeling a blush build in his cheeks. “Yeah, that was me,” he licks his lips, “but my sister got caught during a food raid, I never should have let her go. Never should have let them put me on the helicopter, but I had to make sure the other kids were okay.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to begin one of his usual tirades, but instead he gasps. His eyes go wide with shock and his knees weaken beneath him. He collapses into a heap, clenching at his left shoulder.
Sherlock stashes the document in his coat with a grin, “Found you.”
“Oh, right,” Harry murmurs, realizing they aren’t alone.
Mycroft shifts his head, it lolls heavily on his neck, pointing in the direction of the last body in the room.
“You know I’ve never done this to someone that was awake before.” Hamish moved to the side sink and scrubbed his hands and forearms. He didn’t have anyone he trusted to help him prep, but that was okay. The tray by the table was nicely set for everything he needed.
Soon turns out to be in the next ten minutes. Moriarty strolls in looking nothing like a man that just escaped from jail. He’s in another Westwood suit like the one from the pool, this time a grey number with pinstripes. A silver chain holds the blazer closed over a grey vest and a crisp white shirt, though he has forgone the tie. Sherlock can only imagine where he got it.
I had a hard time writing Mycroft in this chapter, he isn't the same man from the show, not yet anyways, he's just 20 years old here and still figuring his way in the world, all while trying to protect his little brother and this strange new angel.
“I could never be dull,” Hyperion rolled his eyes, perched on his desk as a small snow leopard. Hyperion favored smaller forms of animals, which Sherlock appreciated. It made him easier to carry.
“I am not a damsel in distress, I am capable of defending myself, I’ve been doing it for over thirty years now,” Sherlock scowls.
Sherlock steps forward quickly, grasping his sleeve. “You could stay with me, we have a guest room. We could play pirates, you could meet my dog Redbeard, he’s really friendly. You like dogs.”
“He did what?” Lestrade gasps, though he’s not sure why he is surprised.
The crime was at a collection of council estate flats in a bad part of London. The whole place was awash with lights. The LFB were already there, their fire engines having been called in first when a fire had erupted in one the flats.
He turns in a slow circle, brolly held out like a saber. He stops at a light breaking through the shadows. Wings. White and gold wings fill the air, feathers spread wide and proud.
“Let’s get this cleaned up,” she says, surprisingly calm.
“Captain Watson,” he grins, pulling his hand out of his pocket to give a little wave. “Haven’t seen you since Maiwan, long time.”
“You have a chance.”
Seb glares at him, chest heaving, fists shaking with barely constrained rage. “It doesn’t matter,” he bites out, right eye twitching. “This will be over soon.” He stomps off, leaving out the room with a slam of the door.
Hamish felt his heart swell; he had missed his parents’ strange form of domesticity.
“I suppose not, but you two shouldn’t have gone harrowing off without back-up! How hard is it to tell me what is going on?” Lestrade yells at them. Now that the adrenaline is wearing off, his headache is getting worse. His gift is going haywire, he can see connection lines all over the place, everything from the slimmest fishing line to the massive thing binding the two idiots before him.
“No,” Lestrade shakes his head. Sally has known what he is not long after they became partners. A case with a particularly powerful demon had required his unique brand of holy magic. “I just,” Lestrade sighs, “He’s bloody brilliant and he needs someone keeping an eye on him.”
“Yes, but a University Hospital is always equipped with a research lab, and this one in particular contains the equipment I need,” Sherlock answers in the tone of voice that would be accompanied by a ‘duh’ if he wasn’t such a posh git.
“I`m just a scientist, a simple researcher trying to better the world,” the man answers.
Z peels out into the road like a racecar driver. The wheels squeal in protest, but they are lucky to go from gravel to pavement in a few short meters. It is dark, even with the flickering festival lights, but John recognizes where they are. They are just on the outskirts of Kandahar. Despite the hell this place has brought him, for a moment, it reminds him of home.
The black lines Sherlock had noticed in the station lead down to the heel, crafting a spider web of lines down to a black mark, a stylized flower. Sherlock reaches out. The mark reacts, dark sparks leaping from it and sting his finger.
Mycroft moved the tip of his brolly from side to side as he contemplated what to share with his brother. “ Two months ago, a body was found outside of a Chinese gambling ring, gutted with a hunting knife. The body was confirmed as Sebastian Moran, Moriarty’s head sniper and one of the men from the pool incident. The man in that picture took the name when he started to work with Moriarty; however, he is very much a different sort of threat. The original Moran was prone to gambling and bouts of rage, an easy target.”
Sherlock gave the instrument a few more shrieks in childish rebellion, before setting the bow down. “I won’t take any of your cases Mycroft, I’m much to busy.”
“Who is that?” Sherlock asks, because while he is well aware that Mycroft might have colleagues, whoever had been talking to him sounded fond.
“I know you…”
Moriarty didn’t even look up, just continued to sip at his tea, undisturbed.
John shakes it, while the others make their introductions.
John closes his eyes, leaning against James’ weight at his back. He can read between the lines. “Someone is hurting him, hurting him badly enough that he’s lost control.” John stands on shaky legs. He feels strung out, stretch too thin with half of his concentration spread to the other side of the world. Still, he flexes his fingers, the warm metal of his guns falling comfortably into place. “I’m going to Afghanistan.”
Lestrade pushes his hand away, not unkindly. “I’ll fix them later. We don’t have time.” He stretches his wings out, sweeping them up to full height before folding them against his back. They disappear in a flash of magic. He spins his spear, faster and faster until it is back to being a long dagger. With a flick of his fingers he makes it disappear as well.
Lestrade throws his hands up in defeat. “I’ll call Mycroft.”
“Fine, fine, I’ll be there in twenty minutes,” he waves the man off.
Soo Lin shakes her head, “There is no such thing.”
Mum ‘faded’ after that. Her skin grew translucent pale, her eyes smudged with lack of sleep. Worst of all, was the now endless collection of alcohol filling the flat.
Sherlock can’t hid his surprise. “Why would a Hound get mixed up in Baskerville? What could they want with Moriarty’s blood sport?”
“Not yet, you go on,” Sherlock says, leaning into the touch.
Sherlock watches him drop, the angle of his body as he races towards earth is perfect, like an eagle on the hunt. With a laugh, he folds his own wings spearing through the air with equal grace.
“Yeah,” John turns his gaze back to him, but his posture is still tense. “It’d be chaos if Mythos could summon or seal each other after all. Of course, Angels can’t be summoned or sealed, so there is that.” At Mycroft’s questioning look, he continues, “It’s our bond, with our One. The bond acts like a contract and no Mythos can be bound by more than one contract at a time.” He shouldn’t be telling him this, even the Compound isn’t aware of these details, but he trusts Mycroft not to misuse the information.
“Christ, really!?” Don huffs in surprise.
The helicopter landed a few yards away, far enough, that the men struggled to bring their wounded aboard.
The outside of the flat was not terrible, but the inside reeked like old blood and cat piss. The walls were scratched and dented, the paint flaking. Hamish resisted covering his nose by force of will.
After another long silence Sherlock asks, “You are certain?”
Chapter Seven: Dinner?
Chapter Six
He would not wish his nightmares on his worse enemy, let alone this brilliant man he considers his.
Mycroft is sitting at the dining room table, staring at a single file folder. His thoughts are a worried buzz in the back of Lestrade’s mind, but he can’t pick out any distinct thoughts.
“I’m sorry Officer, but we really must be going,” Mycroft growls, pulling his brother up.
Sherlock is sitting in his chair, plucking at his violin. He’s in his usual sharp clothing, so he isn’t quite in a sulk. “Trouble at Tesco, honestly John,” he comments.
The kill had been messy and close, he had dark blood on his gloves and the sleeve of his jacket, but the dark leather disguised it.
“Well then, what shall I call you my dear?” Moriarty looked inordinately pleased.
Tianlong pulls away, form twisting into ever tighter coils. “I’m afraid not little one,” her head dips in a forlorn shake. “You will find them, but it will be through great pain that you will be brought together.”
Sherlock sighs, and Lestrade half expects him to throw his arm up to head like a fainting maiden, but instead he turns his full focus on Lestrade. It’s rather disconcerting to have someone stare at you when their eyes are covered. “Tell me about the first crime scene.”
“What?” John asks, leaning over to break the chains, lowering Mycroft’s arms carefully.
Mycroft takes a seat, toeing off his shoes as he contemplates his answer. “I think the best idea now is to just sleep off our jet lag. It is late enough now that we should be adjusted to the time change if we sleep through the night. There is very little we can do now, that would not benefit from us both being well rested.”
The voice that answers is young, close to John’s own age, but filled with Mycroft’s same posh accent. “What do you want? And don’t be dull.”
Being a consulting detective, having ‘The Work’, was the culmination of everything he had worked toward. He wasn’t happy, per se, but in the heat of a chase or the heart of a brilliant murder, it was a close thing.
Instead he trudges up to John’s room. They gave him the key, so he lets himself in with a soft knock of warning.
Compared to everything else, the chicken is oddly bland, but he likes it dipped in the soy sauce and the freshness of the cucumber pairs nicely. John has taken a taste of everything before he notices that Mycroft is just staring blankly at the food.
John imagines that would explain to most people why he spent the first day after his surgery screaming and trying to claw his nanite leg from his body. “No, I… its with my mate.”
“Yesh,” John chuckles hollowly, “ found her mate while I was in hospital.”
Sherlock stood, tucking the band into his pocket as he moved. “In this case, I think it best to involve big brother.”
“That won’t be necessary.”
Something about the way he says it ‘a fan’ lights up his mind palace, but he pushes it away. He’ll examine it later. “The venom, Doctor, where is the antidote?”
“Now, now Mr. Holmes, you know every street in London, you know exactly where we are,” the Cabbie turned in his seat, looking pleased with himself.
Sherlock sighs,”Fine, fine.” He taps out Mycroft’s number and tosses the phone on the counter. The phone rings twice before picking up with a click.
The Diogenes club was like something out of a Bond movie. If Sherlock hadn’t warned him about the ‘no talking’ rule he would have let out an impressed whistle as they passed the thresh hold. The room was filled with old rich men and the very curtains had an air of opulence.
“What are you doing?” John asks, moving his weapons with practiced ease as he shoots the demons, but his light is fading and there is sweat at his brow. The Fomoiri are drawing ever closer, their noise filling the woods as the burst from the bog.
“Well that’s unfortunate, I almost tolerated you,” Sherlock drawls, suddenly appearing beside them. He glances at the shared marks and shoots his brother a glare, “
Mycroft approached the light board, while he did not have experience reading x-rays, he could identify the missing pieces. “They removed his kidney and a part of his lungs.”
“Honestly, John,” Sherlock sighed, pushing himself from the couch. “That is a very unique set of skills, and loathe as I am to admit it, if Mycroft says this device can travel through time, it very likely can.”
Sherlock grins. “But how many of those things would leave gravel burn on his hands.”
He gives a nod, “Yeah, the radius is good. I think an ace bandage and a sling should be fine.”
The crush of modern buildings rapidly shrinks to more traditional buildings. The air starts to smell of spices with a hint of fish. John watches as the glass and steel morphs to bright splashes of reds and yellows.
John looks at his watch and then jolts out of his chair. “Ahh crap, we’re running late.”
“I’m afraid not, no. Now, you’re going to die, Mr. Holmes,” the Cabbie opened the door, revealing his gun.
Lestrade knows Sherlock doesn’t mean anything by it, the kid just wants to prove his deductions and solve the case, he knows this, but can’t stop his anger from bubbling up. “You are not,” he snarls, “my One.”
Lestrade turns to him, bug-eyed, “What?”
Mycroft pulls the book to him, flipping to a page in the first half of the book and pushing it over to John. The open page is filled with an illustration, with a helpful label at the bottom in elegant calligraphy ‘The Nile Water Seal’. The Seal has a triangle base filled with interlocking water runes set around cardinal points. It is structured in a way John remembers from his training, but he doesn’t recognize the tiny, cramped runes working along the edge of the triangle. “What is this?” he asks, running his fingers tentatively over the page.
Sherlock gets up with care, using the stones to support him. His legs ache, blood rushing back and leaving a wake of painful tingles. He presses his fingers down one calf then the other, soothing the twitching muscle before he dares to take a step. When his legs decide to connect properly with the rest of his nervous system, he heads back for the house. It’s snowing again, must have been for awhile now, because he has to brush off his coat. It’s gotten wet and is irritated about it, the eye on his collar glares at him.
Here is the final chapter. I struggled with this one, I knew how I wanted it to end, but getting everyone into place was a pain. There will be a short epilogue after this, but then that's all folks.
There will be a third part promise.
John glances at Sherlock, to see how he will proceed, but he looks vaguely bored. Trying to cover his bond mate's rudeness, John gives his best doctor’s smile. “How can we help you Henry?”
It was strange to see her now, younger, but just as dangerous.
The bar erupts in a riot of comments and opinions, but John doesn’t hear any of it. He’s focused on the picture of the culprit currently on screen. Of a man in his mid-thirties with dark brown hair and a small build. He’s wearing a white shirt and a Union Jack hat over a swarmy smirk. The man is Jim Moriarty.
“Come on, wakey wakey. I know you’re up,” the man’s voice from before taunts him.
They land in Afghanistan five days after Mycroft first sent out the cry for help. Five days feeling the anguish along their dwindling link.
Lestrade blinked owlishly. He had noticed the black shape draped across the man’s shoulder, he assumed it was a cat or a huge lizard of some sort, but closer inspection revealed the daemon to be a small dragon.
Sherlock glances away from the road for a moment to run his piercing gaze over John. “When everything is quiet and dull my mind tears itself apart like a rocket bolted down, but for you, when everything is quiet your mind goes quiet with it. You hibernate in the quiet like a sleeping lion or a coiled cobra, and when it gets dangerous you turn into something deadly.”
“Well,” Sherlock smirks, “now I need you to get me into them.”
Sherlock would probably have been amused by the whole endeavour if either one of them would let him leave the house. After a year of being free to wander as he wishes, the sudden confinement grates at his nerves. He wants to see John, wants to know if he has won the last three fights.
“Yeah,” John gulps, and lifts his trouser leg. Above his sock, his leg is starling silver, the soul metal never fades or tarnishes, the surface looking as brilliant now as it had the day he got it.
Sherlock stays silent on the matter, he knows his brother is as conflicted as he is on the matter. Britain needs new fuel sources, but they both know that the soul metal needed to produce the nanites will come from the homeless, from the desperate. He runs his fingers over his chest, where his bonded rings sit beneath his shirt. “I’m going for a walk,” he says, standing swiftly and marching to the door of their hotel room.
“Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson were both bitten by the hound that caused your…” Dr. Stapleton waves vaguely at Henry’s arm, “If I can’t synthesize an antivenom soon then they very well could die. If you would be willing to donate plasma apheresis it would greatly help.”
“Sally,” Lestrade warns.
Breaking into the house was another challenge. Circumventing alarms had never been a specialty of his, even if he could pick most locks within 60 seconds.
“Third?” Lestrade asks, surprised.
“Yes, rather unusual ones,” Sherlock comments, picking up what looks like a ticket stub.
Agent Smith goes his own direction, heading for his connecting flight to Boston. He doesn’t give them so much as a backwards glance. Mycroft doesn’t know if his feigned disinterest is because he trusts them to accomplish the mission without further input, or he just doesn’t want to reveal their connection. Mycroft rather suspects it is the latter.
“The Colonel is waiting for you,” says a stern faced soldier, when they step off the plane.
“Aren’t I always?” she shoots him wink before disappearing down the hall.
Sherlock busied himself preparing a cup, so he did not have to see Mycroft’s smug face when he entered the room.
“I enjoy the mystery.” Hamish had used his appearance to his advantage quite often, it’s amazing what the right choice of clothes and posture could do for a disguise.
Sherlock opened his mouth to deliver a scathing retort of deductions at the mass of imbeciles surrounding him, when pain shot through his chest. He cried out, falling to his knees at the burn tearing up his shoulder. His left leg was on fire, everything was wrong. His heart was pounded, adrenaline pumping his system even as he struggled to breathe.
“She’s stuck,” John murmured, scratching behind her ears.
“Ahh, Christ,” John curses, pushing himself up so he is standing on his own.
“An Ilimu?” John asks. The creature sounds vaguely familiar, but he can’t place it.
Greg snatches it up quickly, while he doubts the man would ever try to steal it, desperate people do desperate things. But instead of moving after the watch, Mycroft pulls out his necklace.
John teased.
The violin gives a sharp squeal, before falling into the dulcet tones of Swan Lake. Sherlock loathes Swan Lake, but it always attracts the most patrons. People wander by the park, making short-cuts to the tube. They don’t look twice at the grubby twelve-year old playing the violin, but most toss a quid or two into his open case.
“Think of it as a game,” he starts, watching for that telltale head tilt that shows Sherlock is actually listening. “A challenge. Can you observe even without use of your eyes?”
“You must be the angel. Sherlock has told me so much about you dear, it feels like we have already met. Your poor hair though, Love, you’ve put yourself in quite the state,” she says, completely ignoring his horrible greeting.
The gelatinous mass dribbles across the floor, as if drawn to his light. It heaves upwards, piling on top of itself. It’s body hints at a lion, one head roaring with a mane of fire. A second head bubbles into form, horns twisting forth. It slithers over the rocks, limbs twisted back in a grotesque parody of a prowl.
Moriarty hums, giving Sherlock a contemplative look. “Perhaps.”
“Yes, and thank you, both of you,” Irene says taking her eyes off Molly for a brief moment, and for the first time since they met her, she sounds sincere.
The man huffs. “I see your results were accurate. I am Agent Smith,” the man’s lips quirk in amusement, clearly a false name. “We had intended on sending our more domestic security department, but I believe our department has a mission better suited to your particular...gifts.”
“How about you, Love? Have you bonded yet,” Irene asks, instigating herself into the conversation once more.
Murray rolls his eyes, “Fine, fine,” and adds a plate of baby carrots and a packet of ranch.
John’s first thought is a wolf or perhaps a local dog with rabies and wonders if this case is a waste, but Sherlock seizes onto the answer and John can feel a pulse of something along the bond like an IED blast and he’s swept up in it.
“This is separation sickness?” Bill asked, brow furrowed. He had seen it before of course; being in the military could make getting to your bond mate difficult. But he had never seen anything like this. Separation sickness was characterized be finger twitches and a slight fever. John looked moments from death’s door. “We have to get you to Sherlock. We know where he is, come on. I can even call him, his number was on that weird website of his. “
Moriarty and Haddock where sitting at the patio to tea like proper English gentlemen. They were so nicely placed; Hamish was certain Moriarty was expecting him. Seeing Moriarty in his scope, imagining his skull with one of his bullets in it, was a hopeless indulgence; it would not solve his problem.
Sherlock scowls, tugging off his coat and flinging it behind him. It gives a flutter of irritation before stilling to float. “Yes, of course. Did you think I was just a summoner?” He walks around the table and takes a seat at one of the high powered microscopes - if only they had such equipment at school.
“No,” Mycroft shakes his head, “but the rest will have retreated into the depths to hide.”
Sebastian snorted, “Oh god no, I believe he wants me kept as far away from you as possible. Though I’m not sure if he thinks I’ll kill you or you’ll steal me away.”
Her brow rises to her hair line. “I suppose so.” She offers her hand, “Soo Lin Yao.”
She glares at him some more, placing the glowing bunny into a wire cage, before finally shaking his hands. She doesn’t remove her gloves until after. “Dr. Stapleton,” she offers.
“I was wondering where you got off to, Seb. I’m afraid Haddock’s associates were none to pleased to scrape his brain matter off the wall.”
“Dr. Watson!” a young soldier comes running up to them. His top has been haphazardly pulled on, fitting awkwardly around his fluttering grey wings. “OH!” he exclaims, “congrats Captain, but we need you in the lab.” The soldier, whose tag reads Murray, helps the doctor to his feet.
“I am well aware,” he gives a wry grin before moving to enter the building.
While Mycroft thought himself lonely surrounded by all the idiot goldfish, Sherlock was a veritable pariah, he wasn’t just separate from the rest, he was shunned. At six years old, Sherlock was perhaps the only child in primary school that regularly skipped. He hated school and his peers, and no matter how much he would deny it, he was petrified of meeting his other half.
“That wasn’t a question,” John snarls, reaching forward and grabbing Smith’s wrist. His power flares out protectively, lashing John’s palms, but he ignores it.
He was led into a back room, enforced with a steel door and industrial soundproofing. The floor was slanted toward the walls, where four separate drains rested. There was a metal surgery table in the center of the room.  A man was strapped to the table, held down by his arms and legs, with extra straps on his chest, waist, and knees. He was blindfolded.
The Cabbie was leading him into a nearby warehouse when the police rounded the corner.
The man has a good point, but still. “Are you sure?”
The sound of blood dripping on concrete is oddly soothing. Sherlock listens to the the steady plip and tries to let his mind wander. It is hard. His leg aches and his chest is on fire. Seb had been ‘kind’ enough to pull out the knife and care for the wound with a wad of gaze and a tight bandage. The pressure stops the bleeding, but hurts terribly.
In an alarming turn of events, that involved hostile Americans and a safe rigged with a gun. Irene turned over the phone to Sherlock, and they all returned to Baker Street.
“MmHmm,” Lestrade hums, biting back a laugh. “Alright, what’s the emergency then?”
Sherlock is breathing hard, eyes wide and frightened, but Lestrade has to give the kid credit, that doesn’t stop him. He draws a sigil in the air, casting blue light as his shield variation takes hold. Unlike Lestrade’s, this shield sticks to the walls, casting a giant web.
Bill looked nervous, focusing on everything, but John. “There was nerve damage to your arm, and with your Vision. I’m sorry Captain, they passed your paperwork.”
“Oh yes of course,” Lestrade rolls his eyes. He’s gonna need coffee for this. The coffee maker hasn’t been used in a while, but he has filters and grounds, and that is all that matters. “What are you searching for then? If you’re trying to steal my cuffs, you are way too young for that sort of business.”
“She isn’t feeling well, but he said he’d help her if I brought him a daemon. They also die so quickly, but yours is special. I think he’ll like her,” the man grins, holding up a wicked looking knife.
“Agent Navamas Security and Intelligence Division. I’m accompanied by two foreign intelligence officers. There is at least one dead passenger, possibly more. Proceed with caution.”
“Of course.” Sherlock looks over at the bed. John is just a lump under the covers, but he is finally sleeping restfully, the antivenom breaking his fever with surprising speed.
“Give him a chance, it will be good for him. I think this John will work out well. Sherlock certainly needs someone brave and protective,” Greg said, watching the consulting detective walk off.
Weather it was moments or hours later, John wasn’t sure, but he woke up screaming, the Afghan desert fresh on his mind. He turned over, panting and sobbing, attempting to force air into his stubborn lungs. “Idiot,” John snarled to himself, how could he have bonded with Sherlock. The man was an amazingly brilliant detective; he didn’t need a half mad, damaged ex-soldier dogging his heels. God, his mum was right.
That tells Murray absolutely nothing, but he takes a wild stab in the dark, “Your soul mate?”
James shakes his head at having his words thrown back at him. “I haven’t given up, not exactly. I’ve just decided to stop looking.”
“What,” Lestrade sputters, “Sherlock!?”
“Well I’m afraid I’ve had trouble finding Johnny boy, your mate seems to have run away. Weeeee,” the man seemed gleeful running his fingers through the air like a child. “You should be pleased he is being sensible, you hardly want to spend your life tied to some dumb soldier. What do you think that bond would have been level one, two maybe? Or were you hoping to match your brother with a four, or a legendary five, perhaps?”
Hamish watched the blood splatter in scope, the way Haddock jerked and slumped sideways in his seat. The tell tale red splay against the white siding of his house.
His fingers twitch over the handle of the brolly, spell ready on his lips. With narrowed eyes, Mycroft can just make out the hulking shape in the alley. It’s aura is blood red, oozing with black like a wound.
Here, Sherlock looks sheepish, averting his gaze to hide the slightest of blushes. “She said I was a… a sweet boy and it would do her heart well to know he wasn’t ever going to get out.”
“A diamond,” Sherlock comments, sounding pleased, “clever.”
Don grunts, “Bauza, this is ridiculous, put me down. You are going to have to leave me here.”
Mycroft offers him the smallest of smiles, more of a quirking of lips really.
“Records in the system have him listed as one John Harrison, but we had Q Branch go through the records, and the files appeared out of no where two months ago. They were well hidden, and expertly added, but traces will always be left when an entirely new life is added. CCTV shows the man first appearing with Moriarty sometime in the last month, but he evades the cameras with some skill. Closer reports say the man goes by the name Sebastian Moran.” Anthea read from her phone.

This story does contain some torture scenes. They aren't explicit, but FYI, may be triggering.
John listened carefully waiting to hear from Bill.
“I had a fantastic day, thank you,” Hamish said, snagging a biscuit from Jim’s plate. “Hmm chocolate,” he grinned, taking a bite, “I’m going to change, do you need me for anything.”
A constable cuffed the Cabbie, while Lestrade looked Sherlock over. “You alright?”
John looked at the soldier; he had to be at least forty, one of the sad percent of the population without a bond. He knew the Army had a high percentage of people either without a bond or a black one.
“Did they give you a message when they dropped you off?”
“John,” Sherlock says, louder this time. When John doesn’t stop, he tugs his wrist out of John’s grip, and immediately misses the contact. “Saw us at the University I imagine,” he comments, wishing he had a coat to wrap himself in, something to help hide.
Hamish had met Irene Adler when he was ten years old, and it had been love at first sight. She was just shy of her fifties, but she was still ‘The Woman’, the one who bested the Holmes brothers.
Lestrade looks at his phone for a long time. “Fuck. Sally’s gonna kill me.”
Mycroft shakes his head, “Moriarty wants to play a game, he has been moving Sherlock around the board for months. This move makes no sense.”
“Our orders?” He asks, peering around his shoulder.
“Of course you do, never here just to visit, either training or dying, never here just to say hi,” she tuts, but her smile is welcoming when she turns her focus to Mycroft and John. “Have we started to take in babes? Oh honestly S,” She clucks her tongue, pulling John and Mycroft into a hug. She is actually a bit taller than Mycroft, and this close John can tell what she really is. Her magic is subtle but powerful and all encompassing. John’s never met a godling before.
“London.”
Close to 0100 he still hasn’t been approached and Sherlock texts him to come back to Baker street. John grabs the first cab that will stop for him. That’s when everything goes to shite.
John offers him a quirked grin. “I know,” he says in a way that implies he would be snorting in disbelief if he were a less polite person. “Though I figure a gunshot is a bit more effective than an aluminum IV pole.”
They stop at a castle about an hour away from the forest. It is a grand old thing, all grey stone and climbing ivy. It is nestled between verdant hills and a sprawling lake, looking more like a tourist advert than the headquarters for a spy organization.
skull. Irene was facing him, but she made no sign of seeing him.
Mycroft flicks the watch closed and shoves it in his pocket. “Ehm,” he clears his throat, “thank you.”
“Yes, well,” Mycroft huffs, brushing imaginary wrinkles from his suit as he stands. “I needed to speak to you without my brother’s interference, though with John back, he is somewhat distracted.”
John holds it carefully, pointing the barrel towards the ground. Its massive in his hands and feels strange. Its just warm metal, no different than holding a phone, but it feels deadly, powerful.
“What the heck was on that card?”John asks, as they make the short drive to the main building.
“He ran,” Sherlock remarked, he could feel his body being overcome with numbness. There was a twitch in his fingers he only got when he needed a hit.
“I gotta admit,” Agent Smith steps towards them, “I almost interfered when he started to uncover his eye, but I wanted to see if the water shield would work. It should have boiled you.”
“Are we dipping too much into that trust fund, lad,” the businessman laughed, saluting with his scotch.
“Thank you Mrs. Hudson,” John blushed darker.
“Hmm, fledgling,” she says, sounding amused.
Sherlock shoots him a grin. “I know just the place.”
“So,” Gabriel drawls, still looking amused, “we ready for this mission or not?”
The light overhead flickers, the room dimming as the wall in front of them seems to warp, the walls rippling. Sherlock has a sudden wave of vertigo, his stomach rolling with discomfort.
The next voice, just as desperate, is his own, “JOHN!”
Sherlock scoffed.
Sherlock found Sebastian Moran settled in his chair, with his Strad nestled in his arms. He was holding it carefully, obviously aware of the instruments age and value. He was plucking at the strings, a tune Sherlock did not recognize, but one that showed some knowledge of playing.
Gary and Billy flee from the table, heading back into the kitchen with childish giggles.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft pulls on one of the hotel’s robes and leans into the pile of pillows against the headboard. He looks drained, dark smudges of exhaustion lingering beneath his eyes.
Sherlock throws the mouse at the wall.
“So tell me Captain,” Sherlock holds out his hand, “Do you want to fly?”
“Yes, Sir,” the soldier salutes and leaves.
The noise of the festival reaches them as they reach the building’s exit. There is loud music and the sounds of dancing. It’s sheer luck that they run across a batch of AK-47s that was left behind. There are enough that John is given one. He slips the strap over his head so it can hang by his side.
Sending freezing water in all directions, Hudson River shakes his head. “No, he is gone.”
“Old man Bauza, will be fine. My Dari is shit though, I have no idea what Sarge and that asshole were screaming about,” Z half shrugs, careful of Murray.
That night, Sherlock found the dealer he had once dealt with for an experiment. He bought a bag of cocaine and spent the night making a six percent solution. He injected it into his veins still hot, enjoying the burn throughout his body.
“You think it was something else?” Sherlock asks.
Mycroft sits up with some effort. “Fine,” he winces, breathing hard, “just magic exhaustion.”
When he first meets Sherlock Holmes, the man has one of the strongest bonds he has ever seen. It’s bright gold, shinning like the sun, and loops around his right hand before disappearing off into the distance. Due to the color and strength of the connection, Lestrade is hardly surprised to see the bonded mark on Sherlock’s palm.
“Hello Johnny boy,” Moriarty greets, sounding unsurprised. He is standing behind Sherlock, leaning close, and Jim has a gun pressed against Sherlock’s temple.
“You would be surprised,” Irene said.
The rest of the ride passed in silence. Hamish watched as the nice houses of upper end slowly bled into the rougher parts of southern London.
Lestrade forces him to sit in a chair in the hall like some errant pup.  Sherlock fumes over the indignity, trying to figure out how to sneak into the observation room. He could unlock the door even without magic, but any sprite he summons to enact invisibility would be dispelled the moment he steps through the door. If it was just Lestrade he is certain he could wriggle his way in, but Donovan is guarding the room.
He does not realize what is happening until he sees the pain mirrored in Captain Watson’s face. The man doubles over, his foot-long wings stretched wide open. They shake with the pain of sudden growth, and Sherlock feels the same pain radiating through his form. He curls into himself, trying to fight off the muscles spasms. When the pain reaches it peak, he thinks he blacks out for an instant.
When Hamish’s mind settles back into his body, it’s because the sack of meat in front of him has finally stopped breathing. He’s not sure how long he’s been at it, but he has flayed flesh and removed the bones in the man’s hands and feet. He castrated him and removed the tattooed reminders of his conquests.
“How bad is your PTSD,” Mycroft asked.
“Back up slowly,” Stapleton whispers, tugging at Sherlock’s elbow to pull him back.
The Reichenbach Fall was a challenge made by Moriarty a few years ago, open to anyone who dared. If a fighter could win twenty-five fights in a row then he would hand over half a million pounds, no strings attached. If the fighter lost, however, Moriarty was allowed to do with them as he wished. Since the challenge there have been five that have taken him up on the offer, all of them lost. Four of them are dead, the fifth now serves as Moriarty’s right hand man.
They breath together, awed at the physical proof of how strong their bond will be. “Harpy Eagle,” they say together, admiring the plumage of one of the largest eagles in existence.
John is suddenly quite aware of the sound of sirens in the distance.
Sherlock opened the door, sweeping his gaze from top to bottom. “Gaining weight I see, the desk job must suite you,” he snarled.
“I wouldn’t do that if I was you,” the man warns, and suddenly he has a gun.
Murray was at his side, passed out at an odd angle on one of the hospital chairs. He was in a clean uniform, but a bit of stubble on his face suggested he was not taking the best care of himself.
“I had imagined this playing out very differently, but I’m rather afraid I have a favor to pay,” Irene smirked, perched in her chair like the Queen.
Sherlock scowls, “It wasn’t a double da…” but is interrupted by John’s kiss. The kiss is chaste, a warm press of lips.
While the water boiled, he contemplated the sudden shift in his life. He had gone thirty years without a bond and suddenly he had one so strong that he would never be alone again, that was both comforting and unsettling. Even now, he could feel John’s presence as a comfortable warmth at the back of his mind. He would never have trouble finding John again.
“What happened after?”
John wasn’t lying, he did need to go back to the lab, just not the lab classes were held in. He plugs in the security code for the level III lab, a laughably simple 911. The heavy wooden door clicks open and he slips inside.
An instant later Mycroft hears, “Woah! Check out the tub!” He can’t help it, he laughs.
“John, I need to… John needs me,” Sherlock was shaking and he had no idea where the name came from, but it was the right one. His brave, little soldier was named John.
Sherlock watched, fascinated.
Mycroft takes a step closer to get a better look, John is right at his side, eyes wide and curious. The first object that draws his attention is a simple black brolly, the handle is simple polished wood.
John spins around, guns in hand with a flick of his wrists.
Mycroft knows they have a few minutes before the guardian appears, and decides to ask a question that has been nagging him since London. “How do you get your wings to pass through your clothing?”
The man’s name turns out to be Mycroft Holmes, which is perhaps the most pretentious thing John has ever heard, but judging by the way the man dresses, he’s not all that surprised.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
The flat is a cramped studio with the haphazard clutter of a long term bachelor. There is no kitchen table, just a counter with two old bar stools which, judging by the staining, did once belong to a bar. The couch looks equally second hand and what he can see of the bed, half hidden behind a screen, is a cheap mattress on an even cheaper frame.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft nods, effecting an air of polite embarrassment as he moves towards the platform, inwardly cursing his luck. He knew that non-Hindu were not allowed in the temple, but had hoped it would not be guarded. Not for the first time, he wishes John was here. With his wings displayed, they would have been allowed into the temple without question. No one would bar a Devas from a place of worship, Hindu or not.
Sherlock took a seat in John’s chair, the perspective was wrong, having his back to the kitchen, but he refused to show his discomfort. He laced his fingers under his chin and asked, “Are you here for Moriarty?”
“Hmm,” John hums, “they taught us all sorts of different things at the Compound. I can’t use any of the Summoner’s arts, no Angel can, but it’s still good to know.”
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I've been uber busy with school. I'm still trying to finish a research paper covering Food and its effect on cognitive functioning in the elderly. I wrote this instead.
“But,” Lestrade’s brow furrows, “if they can kill through the mark, why send a Golem after Lukis?”
The intercom starts to announce the next station, catching their attention, when the train slams to a stop. The sudden movement sends people tumbling down the aisle and out of seats. John knocks his head against the pole he had been leaning against.
He fishes his badge back out. “Detective Lestrade from the MET, I was hoping to ask you some questions. It appears we have a Golem on the loose.”
Mycroft has never been one for Christmas, but the sight makes something in his chest seize, reminds him of Sherlock darting about the base of their own large tree, casting spells to make the ornaments dance. He can scarce imagine how angry Sherlock is about him not being around for the holiday.
Their CO was leading them to cover, when another IED took Corporal Wiggins leg. John was already behind the wall when he realized what happened.
Sherlock pushed his way into the right side of the bed, curling his arm over John like he belonged there.
Sherlock lights up suddenly, “What if you tell them that I’m your One. They can’t chase me off if they think you’re bonded.”
“Please forgive us Guardian, we had to speak with you, and knew no other way,” John pleads, his left wing stretching to hide Mycroft behind it.
“Thank you, father,” He whispers, tucking the watch back in his pocket.
“A level five bond, perhaps the strongest bonds need time,” Mycroft remarked, coming up beside Lestrade.
“You know this guy?” Lestrade asks, though its obvious Sherlock does, the real question is how.
“Umf,” he gasps, breath knocked out of him, but can’t linger, he is in the middle of an active train route. He dashes to the edges of the tracks, running along the line before he finds a maintenance tunnel to shoot down.
Sherlock leaned against the side of a police car. His shoulder still ached with a dull throb, but he could feel the pain fading.
“Do you have a plan then?” John asked.
Sherlock breathes a sigh of relief, letting himself relax against his bonds. He’s exhausted, the adrenaline pounding through his system can only hold him together so long and he already feels wrung out. He takes a deep breath, letting his eyes slip closed as he pulls himself together.
“We just summoned an angry Guardian in a method almost assured to get us eaten. If we didn’t do the things that scared us, neither one of us would be here, now would we?” he argues.
Finding who had broken into the bank to leave a strange message, proved to be far more exciting then he expected.
“Christ Sherlock,” John huffs, taking slow steps toward the bed, “it was more than a dream.” He perches on the edge the bed, as if ready to flee at any given moment. “I think I was having a nightmare, and I...shared it with you.”
Sherlock look startled for a moment, but hid it well. “ You ran across John on accident, but you are hiding something. You know who we are.”
Sherlock finds the Sculptor and learns a lesson.
“Good day?” Sherlock asks with a quirk of his brow. He sets his case down carefully and pulls one of the containers open. Its filled with rice, noodles, chicken, mushrooms, and beef and broccoli; like someone had emptied an entire chinese menu into the box.
“12 is just where the scale stops recording, I know,” Sherlock looks down at the mark, still floating in the air. “I can do this, runes are my speciality. I can change it if it makes you feel better, but we’ll have to move quickly, the castor will feel it.”
Mycroft straightens, blinking rapidly. “Sorry,” he wheezes, pressing his palm against his chest.
Look! I updated. Now I can add more stories to Intertwined without feeling bad. :D
“I’m fine,” Sherlock takes a deep breath, trying to settle the rapid beating of his heart. “You must have startled it.”
“It should not be too difficult to find him. An Army Doctor either recently or soon to be invalided home, with a gun shot wound to the shoulder,” Mycroft commented to his right.
It’s a standard enough bond with fae, though still a strong one. Any bond made in blood is going to be hard to break. He understands now why Sherlock would seek his help. These sort of bonds have to be handled delicately.
“Take care, mate,” Lestrade calls after them, but he is ignored as the car drives off.
“Captain, Christ,” he cursed, rubbing his wrist where his double bond was.
“We were in..in..inseparable, Da would take us on walks on the m..m..mo..moors,” Henry twitches strongly on the last word, like a flinch.
Moriarty burst into a gleeful cackle, “Oh, Oh, I think we’ll get along very well!”
John has only been on the London Underground a few times, but it was nothing like the station Navamas leads them to. The station is bright and clean, and some clever magic has made it smell like fresh rain and spring growth. The train is spotless, and while the station is busy, there is no rude crush of people rushing in and out. Though John is amused to find a similar voice telling them to ‘mind the gap’.
Sherlock thought, equally worried. The telepathy could be very helpful, but having someone in his mind at all times would be beyond invasive.
“This was the bullet,” Lestrade says, holding up a glass vial with the bullet suspended in solution. “Its from an M-9 handgun.”
Sherlock is watching him, still in his seat, but now he is leaning forward, fingers beneath his chin in a speculative look. “Your eyes flashed gold.”
Sherlock enjoys the rarity even if his dumb classmates make fun of him for it. “You have to settle as something unique Hyperion, we can’t be dull like Mark,” Sherlock scowled. Mark was one of the boy’s in his class. His daemon had settled as a pigeon earlier in the week, dull, dull, dull!
“You don’t really strike me as the out for coffee sort,” John comments, because clearly Sherlock has decided to flip this conversation on its head.
“We need a flatmate,” Hyperion blurts, leaping onto Sherlock’s shoulder. “We’ll find Moriarty, stop this from ever happening again.”
Her smile is endlessly kind. “Oh Sherlock, I trust you.”
“Two someones, though it was indirectly. Lets just say it is in my best interest to see the man and his network six-feet under,” Moran said, rhythmically clenching his fist. Its a habit John has when agitated, Sherlock wondered if it was a military habit.
“You alright?” James asks, even though his magic must have told him John was unharmed.
“Hardly a surprise,” Sherlock coughs out, “You even grew tired of dear Seb, even though the marks on his arm say he is your match in every way, you still tried to get rid of them. You were the the reason Dr. Franklin started working on his serum again, he had let it go after Charlie’s death.”
They scramble out of the hut. Sherlock unfurls his wings, stretching them out to their full length for the first time. In this wind, with his wings out, it is barely a flap to leap onto the roof of the next building. John is beside him in an instant, wings wide and beautiful in the gathering storm.
“Yes, yes, pleasantries and all that. The sculpting rooms are downstairs,” Sherlock interrupts.
“They will speed up the trial, this case already has a lot of publicity. They’ll call you to testify,” Lestrade comments.
Sherlock’s entire body screamed righteous indignation, his posture straightening even more with the build of what was brewing to be an epic tongue lashing.
“John,” Mycroft calls, gesturing for the angel to come closer. He has an idea, a ridiculous idea. “He has a weak point, in the center of his forehead where his power cycles.”
“I wasn’t going to shoot him,” Sherlock scowls, though he is unsure if he is telling the truth. He is shaking all over, heart hammering and  bile sitting sharply at the base of throat. He feels ill.
Mrs. Hudson sighs, “Oh Sherlock.”
“I made you sad, so what, you’re going to kill me?” Sherlock didn’t seem all that upset about the suggestion.
“Oy,” Lestrade called out before Sherlock could wake the possibly murderous man.
“M..m..my blood!?”
Moriarty entered the house just as he finished setting the tray.
They curl up together, as has been their habit since their first night on the streets. Its strange to think just a month before the accident they hadn’t even been on speaking terms.
There is a large steel table in the middle of the room, piled high with a mess of papers and strange magical items. There is a man bent over the chaos, he’s tall and gangly like a baby giraffe.
Sherlock is clearly stunned. He stares wide-eyed at Mrs. Hudson, mouth open in slack-jawed amazement. “You would, we could...I’m sure there is a more suitable bondmate.”
The man notices his gaze and grins, the same unnerving baring of teeth from before. He holds up his arm, tugging his sleeve up to show that the mark continues past his elbow. “Nice huh?” he taps at the first two marks on his wrist, sharp-pointed runes for chaos and destruction. “You see Jim gets stupid when it comes to you. It`s my job to keep an eye on him, keep him safe.”
Moriarty lived in a very expensive townhouse in a very expensive part of town, meant to look much less opulent then it was.
He pulls open the pipette and siphons out 100 μL. Sherlock tilts his head back, pulling down on his lower eyelid. He drops one drop in the left eye and one in the right. The potion stings, forcing him to scrunch his eyes closed in pain. Tears leak out at the edges and he can feel them running down his cheeks.
John took control of the matter swiftly, holding Sherlock’s head in place so he could properly deepen the kiss.
This was partially inspired by the Johnlock fic Five Years Prior, if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.
“It was simple, elementary really,” Sherlock dismisses with a wave of his hand.
“Yes quite clever actually, I’ve never seen an arithmancy variation of a bloodline spell,” the man steps forward, his nerves gone in the face of his curiosity.
“He could have stolen them,” Sally points out.
Sherlock wanders the halls. There is a dog barking in the distance, a sound that would have once brought him joy now sends his heart skittering. He turns away from the sound, goes deeper.
There was a ruffling of cloth then a muffled noise. John guessed the man had just been gagged.
“I know,” Sherlock snarls, “That’s why I’m here.”
Greg shoots Mycroft a curious look, but he shakes his head; not expecting anyone then. He opens the door to find the young man from before, John, and an older man he doesn’t recognize.
Sherlock rather suspects the pin was stolen and has been moving through various illegal hands over the years. The question is who wants it now and why? Whatever the pin does, if it’s origins are true, than it would be quite the treasure, but did the thief want the pin for money or magic?
“It’s not that,” John slurred.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It isn’t false, Sherlock,” Mycroft pauses and Sherlock can just make out another voice in the distance. The timbre is male and young, but determining exact age and dialect would require a clearer sound.
He returned to London a broken man. He walked with a heavy limp that was all in his head, and his shoulder ached with every movement. Helios moved at his side like a shadow, her wings drooped at her side, leaving a trail of molting feathers.
John faces off with a mad man and so does Sherlock, one comes out better off than the other.
It takes the entirety of the trip to calm down. He knows he is being childish as well. Sherlock’s temper is, for once, equal to his circumstances, but the mage has always been good at getting under Lestrade’s skin.
That, however, was not the current problem.
Hunting down the Golem, may not have been one of Sherlock’s brightest ideas. While he knew the assassin was large, the eight-foot behemoth that had tried to strangle him at the science museum had been a surprise.
“Oh ay, Paul you crazy blighter, calm down. You don’t go slammin the door like that ya great bull,” Pete huffs, but moves to the only TV in the bar. It's showing different plays from the weekend games, with subtitles running across the bottom. He flips to the news and turns the volume up a few notches.
“Let me take him, I can hold his weight well enough and you need to be able to shoot,” John suggests, siding up to him.
Sherlock scowls, “you’re going to ruin all my secrets.”
There’s a long sigh over the phone.
He prepped for the second surgery on the fourth day.
“Hmm,” Agent Smith hums, trying for nonchalant, but not quite able to quell the smile twitching at the edge of his lips.
“Genes mostly,” she gestures to the bunny, “as you said, I deal with splicing. Bluebell here is a successful example of my work.”
John looks somehow very different and exactly the same. Sherlock takes in everything he can as he is tugged along. He looks like a man now, less like the scruffy boy from London. His hair is still kept military short, but the sun had bleached it an array of blond, from platinum to honey. He is wearing dark green scrubs, and there is a hint of a lab coat poking from the old backpack slung over his shoulders- medical student. His gait is a little strange - old war wound. He is tan all over from the Florida sun, but bags under his eyes shows trouble sleeping - probably a night owl.
The alligator, the shape John had spotted, explodes out of the water with an angry hiss. Sherlock and Lestrade are a fallen tangle of limbs, and alligators can be as amazingly fast out of the water as they are in it.
Sherlock sputters as Angelo retreats to the kitchen. “It is not a double date!”
Mycroft wakes with a gasp. He’s halfway out of bed, spell on his lips, before he realizes where he is. He has to take a few deep breaths to calm the magic simmering just beneath the surface, ready to lash out. It doesn’t help. He stumbles out of bed, knocking against the bathroom door before falling to his knees. The meager contents of his stomach emptied into the toilet.
“And the only one that holds the rules is the only one who doesn’t seem to be playing,” Irene remarked.
John walks over, kneeling at his side. He wishes he could lend him his power, if Mycroft was his One he could boost his magicks with ease. Trying such a thing unbonded would only burn out his core, either killing him or leaving him as the nonmagi John had initially feared.
John turns to Lestrade, taking a threatening step forward. “Greg,” he warns, “I am going to talk to Moriarty.”
“Any survivors?” Lestrade asked, though he doubted it.
“I’m fine.”
John puts himself in the center of the large cage, looking for anything that may be of use against the monster hound. There is absolutely nothing in it, and he wonders if he should have tried for one of the lab doors on the far wall of the lab, but he knows as close as the hound was following he never would have made the distance, especially now that his Browning is sitting two meters away, outside the cage.
They went their separate ways from there. Lestrade and Mycroft taking care of the scene, while Bill left to clean and return the weapon. John found himself being shuffled into a cab while Sherlock’s mind buzzed with thoughts of 221B.
It takes hours and is late evening when Sherlock gets the sample broken down into its base components. The results are… less than satisfactory. “Damn.”
“A what!?” Lestrade just stops himself from shouting. Guardians are extremely rare, a unique individual with multiple gifts. In general a Guardian not only boosts the gift of their mate, but also has a skill for different protective gifts such as perfect aim or fast reflexes. A Guardian would also be the best match for a man like Sherlock, who apparently needs protection attached to him 24/7.
“Er, yeah, Sherlock Holmes,” he introduces himself, only now realizing that John only saw him that one time. “Look I don’t really have time to explain, but your opponent tonight is Sebastian Moran, he is going to poison you. I’m not sure how yet, but you need to get out of here.”
“You know where I am,” Sherlock snarks.
Also attached, was an image of John at his bank at the day he disappeared from the hospital, withdrawing 5,000 pounds from his Savings.
Murray spent time on the man missing his leg, first. He pressed a compress bandage against the stub and wrapped it up tight before securing a strange, black tourniquet further from the wound.
In a rare bit of luck, Agent Smith is actually in London. John finds him at the range, practicing spellcraft in a deadly display of orange light. He glances up at John’s entrance, but does not pause in his casting. Each spell appears to be increasingly complicated versions of destructive magic. The range has gouges cut into the floors, the mannequin at the end of the lane is shredded.
“Your Landlady is amazing,” John laughed; he couldn’t imagine anyone renting a room to Sherlock after seeing the state of the kitchen.
John thinks the direct route was the right course. Temasek leans forward, the pressure causing his claws to extend. As far as a lion’s face can show emotion, he looks contemplative. “You are hunting the Master?”
He approaches the graves with a scowl, but smooths out his expression when he brushes the snow from the stones. There is writing beneath. One reads “Timothy C. Holmes, Loving Husband and Father.” Below is a series of what would look like nonsense chemical equations to most, but Sherlock knows it is an alchemy joke about the meaning of life. Father always did have the worse sense of humour. The second grave reads “Wanda V. Holmes, Loving Wife and Mother.” Under the writing is a series of arithmancy equations, the punch line to father’s joke.
He knows the man is reading him. His back and front are a serious of lash scars and tiny parallel nicks from a Syrian with a lot of time on his hands. There’s a scar on his arm from a near-miss bullet wound and a tiny raised bump from the removal of his appendix. There are the small scratches he’d earned as a kid in Sherlock’s school of lock picking, and the weird X over his collarbone from Uncle Greg’s lesson in wrestling that went pear-shaped when he hit the living-room table.
MI6’s home base is surprisingly open and filled with people. Agents and office workers dart about the large tunnels. Each Agent seems to have a demon servant dogging their steps. He can judge the power level of each Agent based on the type of demon they’ve managed to summon. The most powerful demons appear almost human, only pointed ears or a set of horns giving them away. The weaker demons appear as imps or hell hounds.
Sherlock ordered.
Mycroft is slow to relax his grip on the handle, his fingers ache. He takes a deep breath, but it does little to calm the rapid beating of his heart. “We need to call Smith.”
John taps one of the latin lines along the base of the triangle. “This is similar to a Summoner’s call isn’t it?”
“Get behind me,” Mycroft warns, and the moment John is out of harm’s way he activates the circle. The runes glow with violet-blue light, sparks of energy jumping off of it before the spell shoots forward with a crashing boom. The spell is blinding, and Mycroft has to shut his eyes against the onslaught of blinding light.
“This is a level five bond,” Dr. Stapleton states, pulling on a fresh pair of gloves and examining the mark. Even gloved, her touch sends spikes of pain down his arm. “This poison has always been slow acting, I’ve never seen it move this quickly.”
John feels his heart stutter in his chest, but he doesn’t lower his weapon. Sherlock is stripped to his trousers and there is dried blood covering his chest with fresh blood slowly working its way through the mess. John lets his finger twitch on the trigger.
Mycroft hadn’t called.
“What does it actually do?” Sherlock asks, clenching his fingers over his mark.
“You are quite welcome,” John grins, chest heaving from the exertion of his flight.
“Thank you,” Bethesda cups the rune in her palm, watching as it dissolves in a flash of warm light. “I don’t know how to find him, but if anyone can the Pigeon King can.”
The woman startles, the cup slipping before she catches it and puts it down. “Who are you?” she asks, fixing him with a glare. There is magic building behind her gaze.
“May I help you?” comes a wavy voice to their right. The man is tall and reed thin, with a mess of long brown hair. Judging by how wide his pupils are and the slowness of his blinks, Lestrade suspects he’s quite high, hemlock most likely.
When the cab stopped, Sherlock stalled. “Where are we?”
Currently 3 Chapters ~4,000 words.
Sherlock completely ignores the lack of enthusiasm. “I was just taking a walk,” he says with an innocent smile that means he was probably walking somewhere illegal. “When I came across an older woman. She had a London accent, I placed it immediately, of course.”
John wakes to shouting. His head is pounding horribly and all he can hear is the flow of Dari. It’s usually a melodic language, but the people shouting are delivering the words with harsh vowels and rough growls.
“Not exactly,” Q points at the stone in John’s hand, “that is Azurite, ‘stone of the heavens’ it will help filter your magic so you can use it for healing. Angels have extraordinary healing abilities, but their magic is so pure it actually causes harm to all but their One. With one of these stones, however, the magic can be filtered and used safely. Each of these stones is a healing stone, but are each a little different. They will all respond uniquely based on your own magic so I`m afraid I can’t give you much of a guide.”
Before she could fight back, however, Lestrade called out from his office “Oy, get back to work.”
“No,” Sally admits, “but the killer could have taken them with them.”
Hamish made himself stay still as Jim sat on his chest, basically pinning him to the bed. Not that Hamish couldn’t break the skinny Irishman like a twig, but it was a vulnerable position.
They touched, palm to palm. For a moment, nothing, then light exploded, a tiny sun between them.
“No,” Mycroft interrupts. He can’t let Smith continue his argument. Mycroft
“Christ!” Lestrade jumps, “Wear a bell or something.” He holds up his phone, “They identified the body. One Carl Powers, age 18, a class 7 Summoner and second year student at the Summoner’s College.”
“Water seals in their most basic explanation, give power over a body of water to the caster,” Mycroft starts.
Sally drives like a Londoner, which is to say quickly and with abandon. Lestrade would fear for his life if they weren’t in a police car, people tend to get out of the way, siren or no. She stops them at one of the service entrances to the London Underground where another police car is already parked.
On the last day of Smith’s time frame, he and James manage to circumvent the shielding and get to open air. They find themselves in an old shipyard. The air smells of salt and rotting fish. The night sky is obscured by smog and city lights. John thinks it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Clapping echoed down the alley.
“Sherlock,” he calls, yanking his knife free. “Hurry,” he dodges another flailing arm. Luckily Golems aren’t known for being clever.
“You didn’t join the army for Queen and country, not really, you joined because you were bored. The threat of war was an encouragement for you not a deterrent. The more dangerous the situation the calmer you get, you have always been that way and no one ever saw you as more than perfectly normal Dr. John Watson, it baffles.”
“How many people are we feeding?” John laughs when she places the trays down.
He was moved in that day, a lackey had been offered to help, but Hamish hardly needed assistance in moving a duffle, a computer bag, and a M40.
Lestrade laughs, relieved. “Yeah, sometimes I don’t either.”
Soo Lin’s jaw drops, eyes wide. “How?”
He drinks his cider, it’s heavily spiced and heats him to the bones. He falls asleep to the sounds of a crackling fire and surrounded in matronly magic.
Greg reached out, taking Mycroft’s hand so their marks touched along their forearms. He could feel how nervous, how cautious, his mate was, but hidden beneath that, so small it was like the flicker of a candle, was hope. He tightens his grip and offers comfort. Everything would be okay.
Sherlock hums, feeling equally lethargic from gorging on the meal. “I’ll have to remember that trick,” he grins. Full and with the time to properly place the memory, he decides to go into his mind palace.
“Genius needs an audience,” John muttered, thinking of his first trip to Angelo’s.
A Stitch in Time
The Dragon, is an older man, mid-twenties and with the sharp muscle definition that comes from adulthood. His hair is so black it must be dyed, and he has an elaborate dragon tattoo covering his torso and back. Though Sherlock suspects his moniker actually comes from the jade dragon pin tucked in his hair. His cut is so short that the pin looks ridiculous, clearly its the man’s soul metal.
John gives him an unimpressed look. “I was at the wedding, Bill.”
“That is most gracious,” Mycroft bows, John mirroring the gesture.
Sherlock ignores him. “I don’t know how you haven’t found the gambling rings. All you have to do is follow all the blood thirsty men in suites wandering about the tube. They certainly stick out. The matches have been nightly for over a fortnight now, have you just been sleeping through them,” Sherlock drawls.
Sherlock doesn’t even have the decency to appear startled. He gives a derisive chuckle. “I assure you, I knew that before we arrived.”
“Get on with it then,” Sherlock huffs, but Lestrade can tell he’s nervous.
The lower labs are dark, only a few emergency lights on. It is obvious that Major Barrymore let the staff go for the day, leaving an eerily quiet lab in their wake. He walks into the deeper parts of labs, letting the shifting blue light from the aquariums guide him.
She picks up on of the cups of water on the tray and offers it to Z. “Just drink slowly, I’ll help you,” she says, holding the cup to his lips. She moves with skill, clearly having done this before. She rouses Murray enough to get him to drink and does the same for Bauza.
“So why go with me?” Mycroft asks, curious.
“Ah finally,” Sherlock says, turning his attention to John, his gaze taking in every detail with a flutter of his lashes. “Good, Bill finally told you.”
He is a massive creature, heavily muscled and reeking of old power, skin dark green and black like a rotting limb. He has a humanoid shape, but stands at least 10 meters tall, the deep water of the lake barely reaching his knees. “It has been too long since I tasted aingil flesh,” the beast leans over, lips curling in what might have been a smile but for the rows of fangs.
Lestrade stares at the phone for a second, and he thought Sherlock was posh. “Um…” he stuttered, “Vatican Cameos.”
Grinning, Sherlock heads down the London back alleys. He ducks into the empty houses of Leinster Gardens. It’s a risk jumping down to the tunnels, but its the easiest way to get into the tunnels without jumping the bars at one of the tube stations. He hits the ground and rolls, his violin case hitting him in the back of the head.
It was all fine.
John freezes, his body taut with tension. Mycroft worries Sherlock has just chased away the one person meant for him, but John turns to Sherlock with wide eyes and asks, “How did you know that?”
Sally slumps, “Ah christ. He’s a Link.”
Of course, the man wanted him to come to the station and ‘explain’ his deductions. As if it wasn’t obvious. Though, Mrs. Hudson had stolen his skull, perhaps he could use Lestrade to bounce ideas off for a while.
“Of course, but I have some more personal business ventures to deal with this morning. I will hardly need your particular skills, go amuse yourself,” Moriarty stepped into bathroom, discussion over.
Which he does. John waits, feeling ready to jump out of his skin as Mycroft organizes a team. To give himself something to do, he goes into the parlor to grab his jacket, which has his gun in the pocket. Someone had left the telly on, it casts multicolored light across the dark, but the sound is off. The news is playing, words scrolling rapidly along the bottom.
John follows blindly, he is still slumped in pain and blood runs freely from his nose.
It is winter in London, so the next morning dawns cold and foggy with freezing rain. Mycroft loathes the weather, and hunches beneath his brolly trying not to shiver. He normally avoids the London Underground like the plague, partly because he comes from the sort of people who don’t ride ‘public transportation’, and partly because it doesn’t take a seer of his abilities to know visiting the Underground will most likely get him robbed.
There is shouting and it hurts. Someone slaps him about the face and it hurts even more.
“No,” Mycroft says flatly, but there is amusement around his eyes. “Come on then.”
“I was, yes. Haircut give me away?”
“Come along Seb, we have some uppity Libyans to deal with,” Moriarty tugged him along.
Mycroft once read that people with short Timers will have a hard life and need their Soulmate sooner than most, which is why he was startled when his little brother was born with such a short time to wait.
Sherlock shakes his head,” It’s not poetry, it’s truth.”
He can’t see well in the red light, his arm looks black and ripped apart, but a careful prodding with his fingers tells him it is not nearly as bad as it looks. He has a series of shallow cuts along his arm with only two being deep enough to maybe need stitches.
Mycroft scoffs, “What caliber? There is a demon wreaking havoc all over the planet, and I still can’t sense them, but I can do this. I can find out where the demons are coming from.”
Hamish marched up the stairs in simmering rage. It took a long shower and many deep breaths to calm back down. When he slid into Jim’s bed, the crime lord was still down stairs. Hamish fell asleep waiting for him to make his move.
“What killed her?” Sherlock asks, and John is really going to have to talk to him about tact.
They both hurry to secure their bags and acquire transport to their hotel in Manhattan. Mycroft had thought about renting a car, he does have a license, but he is hardly practiced and is well aware that New York City is no place for a driving novice. Judging by the harrowing journey of their taxi, he made the right decision.
“He smells strange, like soot or ash,” Riddell remarked, sniffing at the paper.
It should be his look next, but James steps up. He gives a bow, rather mocking, before flapping his wings and returning to the gym.
“I can’t explain it Bill, but its not time, not yet,” John, struggled to sit up, his arms shaking like an old man.
Baskerville is more dangerous than either Sherlock or John expected.
“You were going to cheat?” John growls. He pushes Sherlock behind him, trying to guard the younger boy.
“My….my...my,” the man twitches, “my name’s Henry Knight.”
John leans his head against the seat and closes his eyes, still feeling exhausted from their endeavour. The sounds of a violin concerto lure him into a sort of meditative state. His mind is blank, there is only the music and the rhythmic hum of the car around him.
“Carol, the woman in the park you were seen meeting with, she was murdered,” Lestrade needed to get everyone back on track.
Two men stood off to the right. One was a familiar looking man in a long coat. The other was a smaller man in an expensive suite and a smirk like a spider.
“You amazing man,” Sherlock grinned and practically threw himself at the man. The kiss was a sloppy mess, but he imagined most first kisses were.
He plucks the old pages out of one of the piles he has created. The edges are yellow with age and there are a few tea stains lingering on the page. The document is a copy of a purchase made over thirty years ago of a hunting cabin deep in the moors. The cabin was sold to one Charles Knight, Henry’s father.
Harry is gripping John’s arm so tight it hurts, but he can see the excitement in her wide eyes. He’s actually going to make it, a few more meters and a flight home and he’ll actually be able to return to Sherlock, the thought fills him with warmth. He rubs his thumb over his ring finger where his newly bonded ring should be. So close.
I have a great love of Chai tea, can you tell? :D
“Where is your brother then?” Greg asks. He’s not sure what he is planning just yet, but maybe he can offer a bit of help to this strange kid.
Mycroft sighed, and blessedly left.
Sherlock takes it back carefully, using the opportunity to get a better look at the boy. He has sandy blond hair, almost white from time spent in the sun. His skin is heavily tanned, hints of healing sunburn along his nose and the tips of his ears. He is dressed in an old jumper that clearly used to belong to an older man and a pair of old jeans that are torn at the bottom. Despite his dress, however, he has the healthy flush of a home kid. He’s not from the streets which bookers the question how he learned to punch like that, let alone why Bruiser seemed to not only know him, but was also terrified of him.
“Not very bright are they,” Hamish grins, pointing at the CCTV at the corner of the alley.
“I couldn’t imagine,” Mycroft says looking down at the duvet.
“Yeah,” Lestrade doesn’t bother to lie. “He’s, hopefully, downstairs waiting for me.”
“You’d be surprised what Moriarty finds acceptable to win,” Sebastian smirks before striking. He launches forward with a series of jabs to the face and chest.
John and Bill had found the pool the moment they settled in London. There weren’t that many pools to choose from, and once Sherlock had posted about Carl Powers on his website, it didn’t take a consulting detective to confirm the location.
The tube is clear pyrex glass, sturdy and nonreactive to the shimmering silver liquid within. It looks like mercury, the sluggish fluid moving softly in the container. There is less than 30cc’s within, but even that amount is priceless. John knows it is not mercury and he so grateful to Mike he’s certain he will be buying the older man’s lunch until the day he dies.
Chapter Five
John joins between Ruiz and Smith, his magic completing the protections. He pulls Witness, aiming both guns down the cavern.
Stapleton taps the side fondly, ”we’ve used this for all sorts of things. We originally got it to test tissue printing, but we found a machine that has a cooling system in it that is better for that sort of thing. It’s on the second floor now, but we still use this one for various projects.”
Sherlock grabs the pillow, tucking it under his head. He has no intention of sleeping, but the couch is as good a place as any to think. He presses his palms together, touching his fingers to his lips and slips into his mind palace.
Sherlock bristles as he slides into the booth. “No, Mycroft.”
This chapter is not my favorite, but it is done.
They go downstairs together. Amazingly, Sherlock is leaning against the police car, looking bored while trying to glance at them from the corner of his eye.
“Now,” Sally claps her hand, as if banishing the awkwardness. “Let’s find our murderer.”
“They won’t be pleased about this,” Smith says once they are out of the building.
“A calculated risk, if you will.”
Still, the scenery certainly makes up for it. Before him is the Lingaraja Temple, spires of laterite filling the sky in a reddish hue. The air is thick with the scent of spices and the murmuring of worshippers. Everything is hushed, the quiet shroud that seems to hang over any sacred place.
Mycroft keeps a mental tally of the Timer, but even he gets distracted, pulled into conversation with his Mummy. They are chatting about a new article in Mathematics Magazine when Sherlock yells.
Charles Knight had been a biochemist with his PhD work in hormonal responses in pair bonds. He’d been a lead researcher in the lab that had existed before Baskerville became a military installation. Which is where he had meet Dr. Franklin over twenty years ago.
It is not what he is looking for, so he heads out and into another room. This one is freezing cold and he hikes his jacket up around his shoulders to stave off the chill. The equipment looks like a Histology lab, there is a large hood with sets of cutting boards and a collection of different sized scalpels. He is drawn to one of large glass door fridges that has been covered in caution tape. There only appears to be a few large cardboard boxes inside, but he finds a sign taped to one of the sliding doors that says, “Leg infested with maggots, don’t open until dead.”
They pass through a staggering amount of locked doors, each one requiring a swipe of Mycroft’s stolen ID card. When they finally make it into one of the labs on the 2nd floor, 10 precious minutes have passed. The first lab is a large, open room sectioned off by large animal cages and desks. Most of the cages are empty, but some are filled with varying types of monkeys, all of whom seem to be royally pissed off.
“The hell it ain’t,” Bill scoffed, rolling John over so he could look at his shoulder wound. “Your burning up,” he muttered, pulling the jumper down to show the bandage. He only tore the corner of the bandage down, expecting to find pus or blood poisoning. Instead, he found the wound had taken on the healthy white shine of fresh scar tissue. There was barely any redness and no pus.  “John… it looks fine.”
The building looks like every other pretentious government building Sherlock had spent his life trying to avoid. The entrance is oppressive dark brick surrounded by towering white columns. The inside is pale marble marked with the Vision Center seal of the all seeing eye.
John turns his gaze to the cider, “He’s not my…”
“What is this case then?” Mycroft asks once they sit, looking doubtful. He sips at his tea, but completely ignores the bread.
“I told him his man took Sherlock. He had no idea, it wasn’t part of his plan.”
Irene turned to him, looking like an owner whose dog had done something surprising. “He asked me to tell you the truth, which is a rather large request when it also involves lying to Jim Moriarty.”
John’s lips twist into a sad smile. “You always were a terrible liar.”
“Borrowed it,” Sherlock drawls holding it out.
Mycroft finally concedes. Taking up chopsticks in one hand and a spoon in the other. He eats the laksa fastidiously, wrapping the noodles in the chopsticks and balancing them on the spoon. It’s ridiculous, but he seems to enjoy the soup, or at least he finishes the bowl. He’s even more reluctant about trying the crab, but John convinces him to at least dip the bread in the sauce. Mycroft eats with the bread held delicately between two fingers.
The removal of his shirt revealed the newly formed mark on his right arm. It was a startling pure red against Sherlock’s pale skin, red, meaning love and passion or danger and excitement. John had a pretty good idea which one theirs stood for.
The smell has gotten worse here, trapped in such a small place and multiplied. Dried blood cloggs his senses. “Oh, Mycroft,” he whispers, coming upon a locked door. The lock is a simple enough sigil, but the black magic would make it difficult for any regular mage, for John however, it only takes a hint of holy magic. The sigil sizzles as its purified.
Sherlock flips his coat collar, utilizing his cheekbones to their full effect, “I think we can show ourselves around, thank you.”
“You don’t want to leave?” Lestrade asked.
“I can see it too,” John points out, running his finger along the very edge of the weave. The magic tingles across his senses, almost playful.
Sitting in the plane bound for Afghanistan he feels the click of a merged bond, a warmth filling his chest. “Be safe Sherlock,” he whispers clenching at his shirt, “for both of us.”
“That’s why we have to go, huh?”
John shoots Mycroft a questioning look. He’s not sure why he trusts him to make a decision about this mess, but he had led them through the forest relatively unharmed, and when it came to it he trusted John to make his shot. He thinks, perhaps, that he can return the favour. Mycroft gives a sharp nod. They follow Smith.
“For science, John!”
Mycroft is not sitting near anyone, and not a soul dares to ask him about his own test. He opens the envelope, pulling out two pieces of paper. The first is a standard letter, the same Occult Department stamp now in the top center of the page.
“Nonsense,” Navamas waves him off, and marches out like a women on a mission. They follow.
The room flickers with color, the Vision solidifying on the wall. There is a man on screen, he’s blond haired with streaks of grey. Haircut and tan says military, cane says recently invalided. “Who’d want me for a flatmate?” he asks, voice overlaying with Sherlock’s saying the same thing.
With a twitch of his wings, John glides from one perch to the next. He settles on the edge, leaning forward so his wings can rest comfortably off the sides of the platform. From here he can see the others.
Dr. Franklin gives a bark of a laugh, the fire throws sinister shadows across his face. “And what about this situation implies I’m a ‘proper’ scientist.”
Luckily, Agent Navamas doesn’t look offended. She just smiles at Mycroft, looking amused.
He shakes his head, brushing the thoughts away as he enters the industrial area. The streets are lined with packing plants and office buildings. It looks abandoned in the night, no one working after hours. The building the bond leads him too seems as abandoned as the rest, no lights visible from the street and no cars parked near by.
“I know that you want to keep him close, that it is an instinct, but he’s just a kid. This is a dangerous job and no matter how strong or clever he is, he’s fourteen.” Sally’s jaw is a stubborn jut.
Moriarty hated the man for his bad style and his lack of creativity, hardly a reason to kill a potential asset, but the man had never been the most reasonable.
“Which was it, your mother or your father?” Moriarty asks.
“That wrap looks well done, but he must have lost loads of blood, it ain’t gonna be good,” Z comments, straining to get a better look.
They make it into the mountains without issue. John can feel the link strengthening the closer they get. Mycroft is still reaching out to him, but pain makes the signal confusing. He has to close his eyes, concentrating completely on the thin strands of violet magic that call out to him.
The dragon twists, mane dancing in a shimmer along her spine. Her laughter sounds like bells. “You are a wily one Farsight, but you’ve brought along a Fallen Star. Will you fly with me little one?”
John stops at his side and with a spark of holy magic, pulls his wings out of hiding. He flares them out, flapping them a few times before folding them behind him. The tips of his primaries ghost over the ground.
John straightens, looking startled. “I … ah, yes, I’d be honoured.” He flexes his wings, taking a leaping step onto the railing and diving off the the edge, wings pumping in great gusts.
“Good,” Lestrade stands and claps Sherlock on the shoulder. It shouldn’t be, but the warm weight is comforting. “Get some sleep.” He waits until he is at the door to add, “brother-in-law.” Sherlock’s scowl follows him out.
John has to stifle a laugh.
Sherlock presses against the wall, careful not to block the path of the light.
“Bit of a headache,” he admits, rubbing at his temple. The flash on his palm distracts him. He pulls his hand away to look at his palm, where a glowing blue rune of the justice scales are now etched. “I don’t bloody believe it,” he’s honestly awed. Nearly forty-years old, and he meets his soul mate in the older brother of his obnoxious consulting detective.
The man is standing next to the bar, shoulders slumped so he looks hunched in on himself. He’s picking at his right sleeve again, fingers tugging nervously at his shirt.
Wiggins lives in the tunnels, knows them better than even Sherlock. Most people call him “Rat,” but Sherlock tries to avoid using nicknames if he can help it. He finds Wiggins in his usual bolt hole, a small maintenance room that’s been abandoned for years.
Proving it, however, was harder than he had assumed. If he had been an instant slower, a child would have died for his failure. Perhaps knowing about the Solar System could be of ‘some’ use.
John walks up to him and has the man sit down so he can make sure he is okay. He checks pupil dilation and reaction time with a penlight from his jacket. Sgt. Hunt is shaking, his wings flexing with adrenaline, but he appears fine.
John feels the echo of the pain across his own skull. His grip on his gun reflexively tightens.
Now John was standing in Sherlock’s room and hadn’t the faintest clue where to begin. Being an idiot, he started with, “I found my sister.”
The section of tunnels, however, that lead to the base are empty of riff raff. Even the refuse looks staged, like an interior decorator had decided that corner needed a few broken beer bottles just so and this corner needed a bit of rotting food. His gift flares up at the wrongness of it, but he shoves it away, he already knows there is something here.
Sherlock observed the body in front of him, washed up on the side of the river Thames. Deductions whirled through his mind, he felt like a super nova, a machine of thought.
“Chances are high,” Mycroft responds, but he sounds amused. “Coffee?”
“And what is your role here Doctor?” Sherlock can easily deduce that she is a practical woman, brown hair kept short, easy to maintain. She has small, understated earrings, and she wears her lab coat over a cardigan and black trousers. Her shoes are flat, comfortable looking with heavy scuffing from continuous wear. There are no stains on her fingers, but they are dry, signs of constant glove use and continuous hand washing.
With John off to the upper labs, Sherlock takes a moment to press his forehead to the cold metal of the elevator wall. His head is pounding, he can count each beat of his heart to the throbbing behind his eyes. He takes a few deep breaths before straightening his posture, just in time for the the doors to open.
The door opens with a screech, admitting Agent Smith and another man. The stranger is young, though his three-piece suit hides his age well. From above, his light brown hair has a shimmer of red about it, and he can just make out the sprinkle of freckles across his nose. John ruffles his feathers, the ringing in his ears has gotten worse, but he wants to concentrate on the newcomer.
“Pete! Christ Pete, turn on the telly mate, to the news” the man orders, looking excited.
“I told you to stay away from the park, Freak, ya shoulda listened,” Bruiser snears. He tweaks the strings, making the violin give a sharp cry in protest.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, completely unconcerned. “I needed it.”
“No one is making you go, you could start on the force. You know I’d put in a good word for you, you’d be brilliant,” Greg says. They’ve been having this conversation since Sherlock graduated a few months ago.
John stepped in front of Sherlock like a particularly vicious guard dog, but Moran makes no move towards the detective. Instead, the man offers his arm to Irene and they leave the flat side by side.
“Come along then dears, you’ve just about drained yourself dry silly boy,” Doc fixes Mycroft with a displeased look.
“I needed,” Sherlock has to cough a few times, slowly adjusting, “to know.”
With a huff Sherlock gestures at the pen and paper by the phone. “Look at it, pen on the left and the writing is clearly indicative of a left hand writer, look at the smudges. Not to mention a dozen other clues.”
Lestrade stays silent for a long time, but finally he sighs. He claps Sherlock on the shoulder, flinching when the collar moves, but the coat doesn’t sting him. “You can’t get emotional about this. The cases, they can’t be... personal.”
The floor is segmented by different furniture. One contains desks and a whiteboard like a school, another has a series of cots, and the center of the room is a mix-match of old couches. The aura of holy magic in the room is so strong it sends warm tingles down his fingers. There is a whoosh of wings above his head, he shifts his gaze upwards and is . . .
Sherlock left the bed with care, not wanting to wake the sleep-deprived soldier. The kitchen was its usual mess, but the kettle was clean and he found two cups that hadn’t held body parts, at least not recently.
“I don’t need healing, either,” Sherlock snaps. “Will you come to Cornwall or not?”
It was strange to so thoroughly concern himself with another human being - especially during a case - but the novelty of the experience had yet to waver. He pushed the incident into his mental queue along with the two -
Hamish stood and offered his hand, “I know just the place.”
Sherlock glares at The Woman, he may treat Molly like a doormat most of the time, but even he knows it is rude to ask those sorts of questions. So he is surprised when Molly rubs at her right sleeve.
“So we serve.”
Sherlock takes the chain with shaking hands. He gulps as it unravels, revealing a small golden ring, its band twisting in a pattern so familiar, Sherlock would know it in his dreams. He unhooks the clasp on his own chain and pulls both rings free.
“Yes, that sounds lovely,” John agrees, hiding his laugh behind a cough.
Mycroft steps up to his side, hands forming rapid fire rune shapes, something complicated that John can’t identify.
“I’m not staying in that room. I can’t,” John says, and hates that it sounds like begging.
If he had been put face to face with the man, John’s not sure he wouldn’t have been tempted into something similar. The question was ‘why’? Why did Sebastian Moran torture and kill the man? Was it under Moriarty’s orders, or, like Sherlock, had he deduced the horror of his crimes and decided to do something about it?
He wanders around the office, picking up nick nacks. He’s too wired to relax. He wants to be out in the world, under the blue skies again. He’s the closest he has ever been to finding his One and he is being held up by bureaucracy.
Hamish couldn’t hide his glare; “I find it rather disturbing that you thought a recovering torture victim with PTSD would enjoy the talents of a dominatrix.”
Hamish snarled, leaning into Mycroft’s space. “Bad enough. Now will you help or do you need a psychological profile to prove I’m crazy, Uncle?”
“You are very strange,” Irene remarked.
“It’s my soul mark, love. It means I’ve met my soul mate,” she answered.
“We like to think so,” Agent Smith says, tucking the card back into his jacket pocket. “We would like for you to come in for an… interview if you will. Your scores might rank you in the highest combined levels of Precognition and Energy Perception that we have ever recorded, but that does not automatically make you a good Agent.”
Mycroft is stunned, and it takes him a ridiculously long time to follow after everyone heading home. Sherlock found a match that could call him amazing at his most obnoxious. He looks at his own Timer, thirteen years and counting. He trails his fingers over the flickering numbers and thinks; it just might be worth the wait.
Seb is standing over him, a curious quirk to his brow. “You in there? I didn’t break you already did I?”
“Here for your supplies then?” He asks, stepping around the table.
It started with the serial suicides.
John shifted from his spot on the chair arm to sit on the chair Mycroft had vacated. “Is it just me, or did he seem worried?”
“Oh, and who would you owe a favor too?” Sherlock asked, looking unbearably smug.
Sherlock holds him off with a shake of his head. “Yes, I’m fine, and even better, I know where we need to go.”
He knows the next fight will be around 2200 and he is curious to see if John can continue his winning streak. He has no doubt that Moriarty will make John lose at some point. While the winnings would hardly be a drop in Moriarty’s bucket, the chance to have the Hound as his slave will be too much for the madman to resist.
“He offers you mercy.”
Oh and the poor guy that got his kidney shot out because some idiot wasn't paying attention when they were cleaning out their gun, didn't die. They stabilized him and sent him home, we kept the bits of kidney in a jar in the lab for months, I never did know why.
Hamish is certain that he isn’t widely known as Moriarty’s right hand man, but he had made his rounds enough that these boys could know of him. He gestures behind him, “No harm done, off with you.”
“Quaint,” Sherlock comments, ignoring the fact that he sounds like Mycroft.
“I think it is time I turned in for the night. It will be best to do the summoning tomorrow when we are both better rested,” Mycroft says, pushing away from the desk. His back cracks as he stands.
The problem is, while Sherlock can see the auras of others, he’s never been able to see his own, few mages can- Mycroft, the smug bastard, being an exception. There are spells to increase his sensitivity, but the easiest, most effective, and dangerous method is a potion. He needs the lab.
*****
“I’m looking for one of the Hounds,” Sherlock says. They had called the kids Hounds because when the army picked them up in the desert they said they looked like a pack of wild dogs, starving vicious things that shied from anything that wasn’t pack.
Tired of watching Irene stare at his mate, John retreated to the kitchen for food. He knew he was making too much noise, slamming cupboards and clanking dishes as he searched for anything edible. Sherlock’s kitchen was something like a cross between a laboratory and a crime scene. There was very little that looked safe to ingest or eat off of, so he wandered down to Mrs. Hudson’s flat to beg for the scones she promised earlier.
“This would have been so much easier with Johnny boy, but I suppose you’ll have to do.” The voice was unmistakable. It was the crazy man from his Vision.
“We have to evolve with the times, la,” an amused voice comments.
John keeps a close eye on her as she treats him. She gives an air of healing, but godlings can be tricky. Doc seems rather unconcerned, however, laughing off his glare and handing him a steaming mug of cider.
FYI: I always thought it was strange that John was broke when he came back from Afghanistan. While I have no doubt that an Army pension would not be enough to live on in London, a Captain that has spent at least one, probably more, deployments to Afghanistan should actually have quite the savings account. I don't know about Britain, but as an American soldier returned from Iraq, I saved something like 90% of my paychecks downrange and I was very low ranking. What the hell did John do with his money?
John can only watch as Bauza struggles to his knees. He pulls out his rifle and lays suppressive fire down the path they were traveling. There are shadows in the fog, followed by the sharp bursts of gunfire. Then everything goes black.
The businessmen across from him smirked.
“I don’t think there are any cases hidden or otherwise in any of the papers today, it is surprisingly quiet,” John comments, folding up the news.
“Hmm,” Sherlock hums, hardly glancing over.
“For god’s sake touch the man!” Bill yelled from behind them, exasperated.
“Come here and say hello to little Sherlock,” Mummy waved him over.
Bauza and Don give him assessing looks, before Bauza shifts the sergeant over. Its a bit of a struggle, Don being taller than John, but finally they settle into a comfortable stance.
(See the end of the chapter for
Z nods, managing to wake Murray with a series of shoulder shrugs and wiggling that look like the world’s worst attempt at yoga.
“Yeah,” John murmurs, crossing his arms over his chest as a shiver works up his spine, winter having finally found the garden.
Which is why when all that was pulled out from under him by a bullet to the shoulder, John may have gone a little crazy.
John has to clench his fists to stop himself from doing something stupid when Moriarty writes ‘Get Sherlock,’ with a smiley face in the o. “Where is he now?”
Around him is chaos. Demons have started to converge, coming from all directions. Gabriel and Ruiz are facing off what looks like three archdemons while Smith casts in wide bursts to hold off the smaller ones. Mycroft is still kneeling beside John, awake only through sheer stubbornness. He’s drained near to the point of death.
“Hamish…” Mycroft encouraged him.
“Surprised Jim?” John steps closer to the bars, “it appears you are not as in control as you think.” He turns away, savoring the look on Moriarty’s face as he dismisses him. Moriarty’s scream of rage follows him out the door.
For a time, it seemed his disinterest in bonding was in his favor. Throughout secondary school he watched his classmates receive their Visions. Some found their mates in the next classroom over and other in another school. One boy spent break finding his mate in Germany.
“Yes, she’s a celestial dragon. Her gift is life,” Mycroft explains, heading across the bridge. He stops midway, turning to face the lake.
“Thanks.” Lestrade heads out of the store, stepping carefully over the mess. His phone reveals 10 missed texts from an unknown number. “Huh,” he clicks on his messages, pulling up the list.
“He was a cop?” Lestrade asked.
The men he had been fighting have both fallen to their knees, eyes wide and horrified.
Sherlock grumbles, but they manage to make it to Angelo’s relatively on time. The restaurant smells heavenly like garlic bread fresh from the oven.
He studies the mechanism along the wooden handle, and with a flick of his wrist, Mycroft opens the brolly. It opens with ease, the simple black fabric and polished handle making it look inconspicuous. He flicks he wrist again and the brolly clicks closed. “I can store my magic in the wood, and then call on it when I am depleted. How much can it store?”
“Why would Moriarty get himself arrested and then have someone kidnap Sherlock, it isn’t like he needs the alibi?” John asks, he’s been pondering the question the whole drive over.
“Drug trafficking and murder are rampant in the wetlands because the bodies are so easy to hide, but Gainesville is practically in the center of the state. Mr. Hudson’s job was getting the drugs out of Florida and to the rest of the country,” Sherlock continues, shifting over to get a better look a bit of reeds that look exactly like every other bit of reeds.
“I need…” there is a long pause over the phone before Sherlock admits, “your assistance.”
Sherlock glares. “Don’t you think that should be my decision to make? Instead of hiding in America like a coward,” he snaps.
. “Probably, I…”
He shoves that thought away with a sneer. He isn’t a child to be amused by thoughts of Father Christmas. It’s just another day of the year. The house has no faerie lights, tree, or presents. He is marching up to his room to continue his research, when the phone rings. The noise is sharp and grating, that’s the only reason he answers it.
“Let’s just say Angelo has an affinity for locks,” Hamish hid his smile behind a bite of Carbonara.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Won’t help,” he reaches into his coat and hands Lestrade is phone. “Call the second number, tell him Vatican Cameos.”
“May I pick you up, John?” Lestrade asked, instead of all the other things he wanted to say.
Moran sighed, running his hand through his hair and ruffling the short strands into a mess of spikes. “My name is Hamish,” he finally said.
“Sir!” Lestrade shouted, but before he could haul the man off, he was standing, holding out a small silver needle in his gloved hand.

Lestrade quirks a brow, “So they know you’re in London working with the police?”
“Ta,” John tucks them into his pocket. When the man is turned, pouring a beer, he notices a receipt for a meat order on the counter. It strikes him as odd, seeing as the inn had a vegetarian restaurant sign outside, which had been a little strange in and of itself. Without a thought, he plucks the order from the pin and tucks it in his pocket. “I imagine tourists aren’t keen on the bloody great hound I keep hearing about either.” John still isn’t sure what he thinks of Henry’s story, even if it made Sherlock head out to the country without a moment’s hesitation.
When he came too and could finally focus, he was tucked into a hospital bed with a saline drip attached to his arm.
Sherlock made a low whine from his spot on the couch. His eyes are wide and John thought this was the first time he had seen the detective truly upset.
There is a gorgeous woman tapping away on her phone sitting in the back, but he’s too nervous to try chatting her up. Instead, they sit in uncomfortable silence before he is dropped at a fancy building in the capital district.
When they have dried off –involving a full body dryer that is just weird- Jim pulls him into his king-sized bed and does not let him go.
He can tell his arm is broken by the odd squish of his muscle beneath his fingers and the particular flavor of the pain, it is hardly his first broken bone. His exploration, however, reveals no bones or chips in the lacerations and that is good.
“Look at him John, it’s hardly a leap,” Sherlock commented, apparently recovered from his earlier shock. “He was a doctor, a trained surgeon, you can see the marks of the scalpel on his index finger. Yet he left that job to become a soldier, the skill of his shots say he entered as a sniper, not a doctor. He has already proven his skill in deduction and yesterday he showed a fondness and familiarity with my violin. It is highly improbable, but not impossible.”
Momentarily blinded, John blinked away the spots in his vision. He felt warm all over, like he’d just gulped a cup of hot tea in one go.
Sherlock leads the way like he knows exactly where they are going. Greg guesses he must have memorized to map online or something. They go down to the basement level, which is as creepy as Greg expects considering it contains the morgue as well as the research lab.
“Carry on, this is none of your business,” one of them barks. He barely looks nineteen, and he’s holding the knife so tightly his knuckles are white.
“This incident is going to have me neck deep in paperwork, I don’t think I can just wander off to get coffee,” is his immediate reply, but he feels like a jerk - this is his mate.
Greg flings his hands out, trying to look placating, “No, I, er, I just want to ask you two some questions, maybe you can help me with a case I’m working on.”
John watches them curiously, staying a safe distance away so Sherlock and the older man are barely recognizable smudges. He has to be careful in the preserve, he has to stay closer to them then he prefers, and the heavy foliage of the area makes it difficult to travel without crushing leaves and twigs beneath his trainers.
“You went to school here,” Sherlock shakes his head, “No, you know someone that went to school here, not an ex. Old friend from your criminal justice degree.”
Writing this chapter brought out the medical lab tech in me.
“I am sorry that the trip did not produce the information you were looking for. May your search be fruitful, la.” She gives a small wave to both of them, before turning and leaving, cutting a swath through the tourists that had gathered during the chat. Surprisingly, they don’t move any closer to the statue, as if John and Mycroft have an area of protection around them.
Lestrade opens his mouth to either protest or explain, but Mycroft cuts in. “I have no doubt that you can handle London, I’m less certain if London can handle you.”
Hyperion shifted on Sherlock’s shoulders, flicking his tail in agitation. “Hard to tell, not enough data.”
Bill is already sitting on one of the old booth benches, a half-drunk pale ale sitting in front of him.
Sherlock’s smirk dissolves into a scowl, “He is the British Government.”
Q nods, grinning. “Not just any alchemist, your father’s.”
He shakes his head, mane sending droplets of water in all directions. “I do not. There have been whispers in the dark, but I have yet to hear the name of the creature that has been absorbing Guardians.”
Mycroft’s eyes barely widen, but his surprise is obvious. “I had suspected, but not confirmed.” His gaze darts quickly over Greg’s appearance, “You met his bond mate?”
*****
“Hi,” John gulped, looking nervous. He rubbed his palms along his pants.
Chapter Eight
“I don’t need police assistance,” Sherlock huffs, offended.
Mycroft watches her movements and copies them. Normally trying new spells like that without practice is dangerous, but he knows Mycroft won’t miss a step. John forms the more familiar gestures for the spell.
Moran howls, throwing his back into the wall to dislodge Sherlock. He drops down without a fight, the solution in the syringe already plunged into Moran’s system.
Jones took a seat in front of him, Tresa curling behind him in a mirror of John’s pose. “You’ve been studying pretty hard lately, it will be nice to brag to all the other parents that I have a boy in med school.”
John stared at him in open-mouthed shock. “That doesn’t mean…”
Lestrade belatedly realizes he’s pulled his wings out. Twice in one day, he needs to get a grip on himself. In the bedroom his wings, already large, look massive, filling the space and blocking out the light from the window. He pulls them back in, disappearing them with a thought. The look Sherlock is giving him makes him feel like a cad. He takes a deep breath, “I’m sorry.” He sighs, “I overreacted. That just isn’t... you just can’t say things like, okay? Besides, hardly anyone knows what I am.”
John snatches his hand back like its been burned. He doesn’t want to touch it, he wants to rip the metal from his skin, pry it apart. “Its soul metal,” he gasps, and he can hear his heart beat upsetting the monitor. “It’s melted soul metal.”
“Well now you are mine. My own vicious attack dog.” Jim looked crazed, and Hamish wondered if he was being compared to his Dad. Was Jim jealous of Sherlock and John? That would certainly explain the end game.
Oh and for all my med school app well wishers, I got my first interview offer!
“He’s right” Mycroft steps up. “It will only take a moment to get a team together. I only need to make the call.”
“I waited thirty years, brother, I believe I can handle a few more days. Now, if you don’t mind, I need to find John,” Sherlock walked off into the warehouse district.
“Dropped off? You wish to return him?” Moriarty asked, face carefully blank.
He runs down the tunnel away from Baskerville, the whole way his chest hurts a bit and he wants to turn back. He ignores the feeling and keeps going.
With his rumbling laugh, Hudson River rears back and plunges into the water. The proceeding splash soaks them, drenching them in icy water.
“Sorry, sorry,” John murmurs, over and over. When it’s finally over, his bones have been healed, but the cuts are only scabbed over, and the bruising remains.
Sherlock and Henry take the lead while John takes the rear. He is intensely focused on the the surrounding woods, running his light in a constant circuit around them. Sherlock’s heart is still beating much too fast, it feels like a fist beneath his breastbone, but along the link he can feel the steady thump, thump, thump of John’s heart like a metronome.
“You ran away, I can tell!” Sherlock argues. “You broke your arm at least a month ago, but you waited for the cast to come off before running away. You left at least a week ago, which means you covered your tracks really well or your guardian hasn’t bothered to really look for you. My guess is the later.”
The light exploded like a small super nova between them, heat racing up John’s arm.
“I am very sorry about this Dr. Watson. I’ve always been a fan,” a voice calls over the intercom.
As strong as the animal he once was, he doesn’t go far. “You are a nuisance,” he snarls, spittle spraying the ground.
He grabs an IV pole as he rushes past, it is an unruly thing with four wheels on the bottom, but the top was broken at some point and is now a jagged metal tip perfect for his intention. Spinning around, he holds the sharp tip of the pole in front of him like a spear.
Lestrade felt a hard lump build in his gut. “She can’t?”
“Is it,” Dr. Cohen quirks a brow, “last time I checked we haven’t covered bone tissue just yet.”
Sherlock explains all of the points Mycroft noticed and how he came to his deductions.
Sally points and Lestrade’s hand, still holding the restrictors.
Mycroft makes a curious noise, as if he can’t quite contemplate the thought. “Moriarty killed John then?”
John couldn’t leave him there to die. Wiggins had joined the Army with his bond Julie. He was a regular scout while Julie was one of the rare female mechanics on base. It was amazing to watch them together, a quad bond so strong that they were borderline telepathic.
“Mrs. Hudson, the case,” Sherlock interrupts again, though there is a blush staining his cheeks.
John stays silent out to the car, thinking it over. Lestrade makes a good point. Why? Why would someone kidnap Sherlock when Moriarty has some convoluted plan to deal with him already in place? “Greg,” John starts, thinking about Dr. Franklin and the venom, “is Moriarty bonded?”
“Judging by your appearance, you must be John’s son,” Mycroft said, ignoring the jibe.
“What?” John asks, and in his surprise, lets the monster slip away once more. This time he can feel the transportation spell take. He can’t wallow in his frustration, however, he spins and dives back towards his companions, but the demons are gone as well. The stench of sulfur in the air is overwhelming, but there is no way that the horde was vanquished that easily. They’d been called away.
Where Haddock had terrible location, Moriarty had chosen his residence with care. There were no tall buildings near by to shoot from, and well-guarded government officials owned the neighboring buildings. The yard was surrounded by tasteful, black rod-iron that was both sharply pointed and difficult to climb. The place was covered in hidden cameras and housed two, very angry, Doberman.
“Everyone alright back there?” a voice shouts, accompanied by the bright flare of torches.
With the paste at the right consistency, he takes down his alchemist’s kit and flicks open the compartment hidden in the back of the polished chest. Inside are two small bottles with pipette stoppers.
Then, everything went black.
John winces, “Ew.” He flips the pages back to the drawing of the seal. “But you don’t actually have to seal the Hudson River, though, right? You just have to cast one to catch his attention.”
Baskerville is the badly kept secret of the London Underground. The Cops know it exists, but can’t get anything to stick on Moriarty since he is rarely ever there.
“While I trust John implicitly, he and my brother have been bonded since they were sixteen and the amount of trouble my brother can get into alone is almost doubled with Dr. Watson around, I simply wish for you to keep a, shall we say … weathered eye on the pair.”
John gestures at the two women,
He gives a sharp knock before pushing into the barracks. The room is similar to the Compound, but the roof is claustrophobically close. Both walls are lined with beds, each having a trunk in front of them.
John, sensing Mycroft’s gaze, looks up and shoots him a wry grin. “Well, we didn’t get much information, but we also didn’t get eaten.”
“I’m sorry to bring you in so early after the bond, but this had to be done. Also, Mycroft has a job for you,” Lestrade said as they handed in their finished papers.
“ ‘m up,” he snuffles, blinking one eye then the other as he tries to grab onto consciousness. “Feels like I swallowed a hive of bees,” Murray grumbles, shuffling into a sitting position. He leans forward, stretching his arms out behind him until they gave a crack. “Hmm, much better.”
“Oh,” Mummy exclaims, offering the boy a wide smile.
“อสุภ,” Agent Navamas spits, stepping between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, job hazard,” John chuckled.
They can not linger in their worry. The sun is rising and if Temasek is going to show, it will be soon. They follow along the walking path, heading for the far side of the bay where the merlion statue rests.
“Err,” Lestrade looks off to the side. “I can break the bond, but it’s been there too long. It’s in too deep. Once removed, it will leave a gaping wound that will fester and eventually kill you. The only other option is to replace the bond with another one.”
“Yes,” He barks into the receiver.
“She really is a good detective,” Lestrade says with a shrug. “Come on then, I have something to show you.” He leads them to his office and pulls up a couple of video files on his computer. The first shows the vaults opening in the Bank of England, the only cause what seems to be a computer glitch. The second video is of the security going down and the gates opening at Pentonville Prison, apparently caused by the same computer glitch. The last video is of Moriarty.
She grins at him, “You are quite correct.” She spins to the class, clapping her hands together to get everyones attention. “Now who can tell me more about Lytic lesions?” A few hands raise and in moments they are in a debate about bone cancers and tumors that somehow trails into leukemia, which of course makes the professor pull out her abnormal morphology blood slides. John loves this class.
“Ah Molly,” Sherlock interrupts them, stepping cleanly between the two. “I haven’t introduced you two yet,” he beckons towards John, and his soldier slots himself into the open arm. “This is my bondmate Dr. John Watson.”
“You don’t want to look at the crime scenes?” Lestrade looks baffled.
“He freed us.”
Sebastian sighed, rubbing his brow in frustration. “I inserted myself into Moriarty’s network to take the man down. Unfortunately, I made myself much more important to him than I intended.”
“John?” she called questioning. Helios could change into anything she wanted, but five-year-olds had five-year-old daemons and she was so very small.
Hamish looked at the side table, already set up with a gleaming array of knives and pliers. Hamish huffed, “I imagine I could, but not with this Bond movie crap.”
With the story confirmed, Gary rounds on his husband, “Billy!”
John peers around Mycroft’s shoulder, eyes squinted, there is a ripple of spellwork about the cloth. “It’s a guardian spell?”
“Oh that’s for sure,” Murray says, taking a bite of his chocolate pudding with relish.
“Of all the hostages you could think of, my brother and Lestrade was the best you could do?” Sherlock, his name had to be Sherlock, sneered.
“I don’t need a minder!”
Full-Bird: Army speak for Full-bird Colonel
“It is not fine,” Lestrade growls. “The trains won’t be running that way this late. What were you planning on doing? Taking a cab all the way to Cornwall or sleeping rough for the night?”
Lestrade pushes him back. “Alright, alright. It’s just weird, I didn’t realize this before. The necromancer reported increased levels of serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine in all three victims before death. Attempts at reviving the victims for interview failed due to the magic drain. It was so complete their systems resembled those of nonmagi.”
“What exactly does your brother do?”
John’s foster father was an older man named Jones. He had anywhere from 5 to 10 foster boys going in and out of house at any one time, but John would always hold a special place in his heart.
“How did you?” Lestrade gapes.
“You should be careful wandering about at night, Love, there’s been rumors of a killer on the loose,” Carol remarked, writing in ‘Omentum’ on 6 down.
“You always get down when the incoming siren sounds, Lieutenant Holmes, I don’t care where you are,” the man orders, his voice switching from a Doctor’s caring tone to a Captain’s orders, it’s an intriguing change.
Bill scoffed, but he grabbed his box of noodles off the table and handed John a small container of jasmine rice, he didn’t look like he could keep down much else.
The men were huddled behind a broken concrete wall and a pile of rubble. They weren’t shooting, but the surrounding area occasionally exploded with distant IED blasts. Whoever they were fighting, was closing in fast.
John released his arm, with an overriding need to see his own mark. He tugged off his jumper and undershirt, slinging them to the side. Though they had shaken hands the normal way, John was surprised to find his mark on his left arm. It was a mirror of Sherlock’s, except the sunburst on his shoulder encircled his bullet wound.
“So I didn’t properly introduce myself, I’m Sergeant First Class Donnelly, but you can just call me Don,” the leader grins holding out his hand.
“Wouldn’t think there would be much call for that out here.”
“No,” Mycroft shakes his head, “in fact there has only been one successful sealing of a guardian in recorded history.” He taps the book. “Thousands of years ago lived the Egyptian Pharaoh Narmer, who is one of the most powerful mages known to history. Of course back then the lines of kings were always filled with powerful castors. Most of the knowledge of how it was done has been lost to time, but it is known that Narmer managed to cast a working water seal on the Nile River and the Nile Guardian. He even managed a dynasty spell into the seal so that the power was transferred from Pharaoh to Pharaoh for years.”
