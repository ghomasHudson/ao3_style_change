John couldn’t believe that offer. Full of doubt, he said, “All the debts? That’s more than a lifetime of labour.”
It had been a charming fantasy, to think of giving this man a child. But Sherlock knew enough about how things worked to know that there was very little hope of that ever happening, and that the king would inevitably find a better companion to share his bed.
Moving with ardent resolve, the king led his servant deep into the temple, his grip tender but firm. No monks or worshippers they passed dared to question the king’s urgency, but merely watched in wonder as the noble figure brought his servant into the depths of the sanctuary.
Reflexively, John’s arms tightened around William. “Oh, m’lord, I wished I could be like her.” John pushed his thighs tightly together around William while the king found his rhythm.
“Actually, I want you there, by my side, but I know that you support me, that you’re behind me. I want to talk about everything with you. You’ll rule with me even if nobody else knows it. It looks like a throne for one person, but it’s really a throne for two.”
The thought of the king wanting to do such a thing stirred a deep passion in the servant. “Sir…”
“Let me have you, Sherlock,” the king said against Sherlock’s lips, “let me take you here. I would take you in front of all of them, but this will do. I’ve wanted for so long to have you right here.”
For a moment, the perpetual light in Bertie’s eyes dimmed.
He would have been content to admire Sherlock from afar. Certainly, he would never have forced his beautiful, innocent maid to do anything, nor would he have proposed anything untoward. Besides, John would have only wanted to share a meaningful connection with Sherlock, and there could be no meaningful connection between a king and a servant.
You are misinterpreting my feelings on the matter.
“I always enjoy your attention, sir,” the servant replied meekly, “but to be held in place for you… I only hope I can refrain from embarrassing myself too much, by being too loud or begging or l-losing control of myself like a complete novice…”
“Will you consider your own advice, Dr. Watson?”
And this cane of mine, which is useful in many ways, has significant force when used with proper—
“If only,” Sherlock mumbled. Slowly, Sherlock had become more self-assured, but still too often, John’s poor servant thought so little of himself.
“It was an odd place to meet you, now that I think about it. I hardly think someone like you belongs in a harsh room full of weapons.” John sighed. “I fit in perfectly well, though.”
John had land, and wealth, and power; despite all this, he had fallen in love with a gentle servant.
“You really would want my input, sir?”
WATSON
Oh, but it was so terribly hard to think, when Sherlock cuddled his knee like that. His mind filled with thoughts of keeping Sherlock in this room, and keeping him happy here. Perhaps Sherlock wanted intimate attention, after seeing to his master in such a fashion?
SHERLOCK
In the lower levels of the building, there were private altars and rooms used for spiritual purposes of all kinds, in days past as well as in the present age. King John brought Sherlock into one room that was far away from any other person, a place that was illuminated by candlelight as much of the temple was but distant from all other noise and activity.
“There’s no reason to put him away.” William stood up, and made to fetch his cloak. “Silver Blaze was meant to be seen.”
“Jeeves,” I said, “I know this feels strange, but you mean the world to me. I want to make this work.”
I say that he does.
“You mean you don’t work?”
“You may dispense with the sorries. Might I join you?”
“Your Majesty,” Sherlock said, urgently. “I’m ready now.”
You remembered all that?
SHERLOCK
“Peasants,” Montgomery muttered. He slowly circled around John, looking him up and down. “Something traditional for you, I believe. A belted tunic would do. I advise cross-gartered leggings, they do wonders for short men.”
That was not really a request, but Sherlock could not leave his modest servant unsatisfied. “Like this?” With a palm full of soap, Sherlock touched his beloved again, with a firmer grasp.
Whatever your problem is, you may share it with me. In fact, I would be honoured.
I nodded. “Yeah. You know ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’? Well, ‘the friend of my friend is my friend,’ right? We’ll all be friends, and you’ll feel comfortable calling him Bertie. Everything will be as it should be.”
Sherlock’s smile slowly fell. “I will need to do certain things in the future, John.”
Are those pistols?
That ought to be enough looking for today. I am satisfied.
“Then I will not.” Sherlock’s arm indeed remained coated, as it suddenly raised itself and brought John into a warm, secure, familiar-feeling head-to-neck hug.
“I think ‘nervous but happy’ is the caption we want. Rather fits the bill, doesn't it, Jeeves?”
John wasn’t sure that he should say anything. He felt powerful when he could see how devoted Sherlock was to him, though, and it gave him strength to speak honestly. “There’s something I’d like to do with you,” he said. “But it’s not quite right.”
“My John, my dearest.” When William was being so generous, John could barely concentrate on what his master said; all the same, his gentle voice captivated him. “You saved me. You’ve saved me many times, John.”
It was fortunate that this was such a sturdy, well-built caravan, or else other members of their convoy might have heard the many loud, uncontrolled, nonsensical noises that escaped Sherlock when he was possessed in this manner by his master.
I started writing this recently, Holmes. To cope with feelings that, until now, I thought could never be allowed to surface.
No doubt he had heard all this, but Jeeves had no comment for the press.
When William returned to his castle, in his formally guised self, he was surprised to find Lestrade waiting for him, outside of the king’s private quarters. The priest had lived in hiding before, but now without being sought he appeared.
“It was then that I took a codename, one that wasn’t so pretentious as my given one. My brother created a name as well, since he occasionally accompanied me to town. We had never personally seen how the public lived outside the castle walls, and there was so much to learn about them.” Thoughtfully, William glanced up at the ceiling. “He was always Mycroft to me, after that.”
Reluctantly, though still somewhat curious, Sherlock stood up, readjusted his scarf, and followed. They resumed their stroll at an easy pace, well out of earshot of any of the other noblemen who frequented this garden.
WATSON
You’re not much like the Holmes I’m thinking about. He’s a proper sort.
“Oh, Sherlock, I think I’ll always remember seeing you at the tournament, in that storage room, of all places.” He touched Sherlock’s slender arm, and let his hand glide up so that he could slowly caress Sherlock’s neck, and then his ear.
John was fiddling with his white shoes, which was adorable, yet Sherlock intended to witness this little exchange between his brother and Lestrade, now that he knew what their relationship was. Truth be told, it was difficult to verify that relationship so far. They both stood formally, suggesting nothing other than a polite familiarity.
What is the meaning of this? Stop this, Holmes.
“I would say so.”
It is useless to try to deceive myself any longer. In my own journal, no less, which none but myself should ever see. Why, Holmes is not even able to read this! But he can read me. I cannot let him touch me again. God knows what he divined from my pulse, for surely that was why he touched my arm when he… came so close to me. Blast it, how do I keep such a secret from the man whose occupation is to unravel mysteries?
Now, Doctor… Watson, is it? I have heard that he offers helpful little insights, but I hardly think a blind man can live up to all your generous praise.
It was the first word that Sherlock had spoken in some time. They had been walking together through the forest, hand in hand. John had tried to reassure Sherlock, to tell his sweet maid that he was certainly not a failure, and Sherlock had nodded a few times. Regardless, Sherlock still seemed to be working through his worries. Eventually they had fallen into silence, sharing support where the palms touched, and moving forward together, as John hoped they always would.
It was ludicrous, how often he had to apologize for his inappropriate behaviour. Sherlock was not fit to speak to a king. He had long been subservient to nobles, but it seemed that he would never learn how to speak to them correctly, as their subordinate.
John treasured the wooden horse of their past as well. If John continued to warmly praise the fruits of this hobby, then it would be remarkably possible for William to pursue it further.
“Let us walk, Sherlock.” Gingerly, Mycroft stood up with his umbrella. “If I truly have to tell you this, I might start blushing, and I’d like to blame it on the exercise.”
“I never thought there could be so many apples in one place,” Sherlock commented, full of enthusiasm, reaching for another piece of fruit. “Imagine all the things they could be used for.”
Sherlock had a very bad habit of spying. He’d been scolded enough to know that this was true. He didn’t mean to upset his employers by doing it; he was only interested in their lives, which were so much more noteworthy than his own. He was also generally terrible at following directions. His mind would wander, or he would become intrigued by some unimportant part of his task. All things considered, he was not anyone’s ideal servant.
WATSON
I beamed at him. “I’m chuffed to bits to hear that, Jeeves.”
This bow fitted well in King John’s hands, served him expertly, and was perfectly useful; for all these reasons, Sherlock deeply envied the thing. He still cleaned it with care, however, as it was, after all, an item belonging to the master he revered.
Sherlock did a double take, to the empty seat across from him sand back. When had Mycroft walked over there?
It seemed that, even if it was a subtle change, the wedding had altered something in this room. Sherlock could have sworn that there was a new feeling in the air. Vows of devotion drifted around them, filling the room with their union. King William, king of this land, had been wed, and now he was with his partner.
All that John accomplished was thinking of what Sherlock would look like on his knees, his slender hands holding on to the king’s brawny legs and his face tickled by the coarse hair of John’s crotch. How gorgeous Sherlock would be, were he kneeling before John submissively, at the king’s mercy, ready to serve.
While Sherlock and I made our relationship public, things were different for Bertie and Reggie. (Reggie is Jeeves’s first name—I’m still getting used to it, but I’m glad he finally told us.) Bertie was discreet about their dates and kept it mostly out of his blog.
John faltered, pausing in his wiping of a shelf for a moment. “You said that was all right?”
Keeping his voice steady, John continued, “Forget about the book for now. Your old rivalry with your brother can wait. We’re here to have a nice date, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. So please sit down.”
That was unlikely, Sherlock realised. “I don’t think he does.”
King John was not the only reason Sherlock wanted to go on this journey. The rugged, gallant king was a likeable man, of course, and a pleasure to be around, despite what he had said about his bad moods, so Sherlock could excuse himself for finding some enjoyment in being in such company. But the freedom of leaving this town and finding a new life was what compelled Sherlock.
“Sorry, Sherlock.” It was easy for John to forget that Sherlock did not stand on his rank in their class-conscious society. Mindful etiquette toward those of a higher station was deeply ingrained in the apothecary’s son.
“Not really, no,” he answered, still smiling. “It’s the polite thing to congratulate you on your own success with that fellow Jeeves, I gather.”
Taking off his belt, King John took out an item from within a pouch. It was the jar of oil that Sherlock had become acquainted with in the caravan. Excitement pooled in Sherlock’s belly when he spotted it.
Lightly touching Sherlock’s hand on the bed, encouraging it to relax, John leaned in close to his servant. “I know you can’t have children, but that’s okay.”
It had been both a miracle and a tragedy when Sherlock had offered himself to the king.
“I told you already, Sherlock, you don’t owe me that.”
Undressing himself completely, Sherlock felt a little self-conscious himself, but it was worth it to hear John whimper with helpless need.
When John had first heard Sherlock’s name, he’d said it was a lovely one, and he’d been telling the truth. John adored the name; it suited his servant very well. “I like it this way. I like how your name looks.”
John was respectfully quiet, too polite to intrude on a continuing search with even a greeting, until he saw that William was indeed approaching him. “Can I help you, m’lord?”
I’d thought more about what they’d told me, and I was starting to understand just how different their circumstances were compared to ours. Social positions meant more in their world, and going against the status quo would bring them consequences that Sherlock and I didn’t have to worry about. It made sense that they wouldn’t want to advertise the fact that they were dating. Bertie even mentioned to me that some pals of his who’d married outside their class had chosen to elope in secret, so it wouldn’t surprise me if those two someday did the same, assuming they get to that stage, and I have a feeling they will.
It was evening when Sherlock was strolling with Mycroft through one of the gardens in a wealthy part of town. Only when they stopped to sit on a stone bench to admire well-groomed rows of flowers did he perceive that they had not talked about their past all day.
It could only be the wishes of a powerful and lonely king, nothing more. Yet, even if he were the ruler of the land, Sherlock would not use him in a wholly selfish way. That was John’s firm belief. There was too much of the gentle, eccentric nobleman John had known within the man who slept on that large bed for that to happen. This firm belief also meant that, even if he truly was lonely, William would not make such an intimate request again. It made John’s heart beat a little faster to know that Sherlock was a gentle soul. The conflicted king probably regretted saying anything at all this night.
Sherlock was wondering if the king truly was remembering a story, or perhaps using this tale to say what could not be confessed with ordinary words, but Sherlock could not concentrate long on the question, not when King John was disrobing him with such sureness and impunity.
“Sh,” William whispered against John’s lips, “don’t let the coachman hear you.” He then slipped his tongue into John’s mouth, claiming his devoted servant.
There were other battles to be done between other warriors, but when King John left the arena, surrounded by an entourage of nobles and knights, Sherlock immediately left his seat. He didn’t try to follow the king, for he was certain that he would not be welcome in such esteemed company. There was no reason for him to stay in the audience, though.
Pleased, John smiled. “You’re a good servant. I don’t mean that you can’t leave me, Sherlock. But at least give me the chance to do better if I’m not gallant enough for you.”
“Sherlock?” John said again, with a note of concern.
Lestrade nodded, and left the room, another chuckle audible from the hallway.
SHERLOCK
put them to work.
Bertie grinned, which made me happy to see. “Oh, a double date! What a thought.”
Sherlock moved to the front of the caravan, eager to see an unfamiliar new town, and grateful for the opportunity to sit next to the king, who seemed to have kindly forgiven the servant’s outrageous behaviour the night before.
Sherlock was certain that the king would take the opportunity to step away from the caravan—to get away from his inadequate servant—but the king unexpectedly stepped back into the caravan, closing the door behind himself.
At this, I shut up like a clam. I was tempted to add that I do have a habit of rambling, but I was sure he could deduce that for himself.
MYCROFT
Sherlock. This plan of yours is most distasteful. You have become very comfortable sitting on Lestrade, I see.
Mycroft looked very pleased with himself. “Perhaps it wasn’t the entire truth that you wanted.”
SHERLOCK
It’s all quite innocent. I became familiar with his person when we shared a brief waltz the other day.
The king started removing his trousers. Sherlock made a keening sound when at last he saw, in the dim light, the ache that had kept his master from restful sleep. It was no wonder, for it looked as thick-bodied and potent as the rest of the king. Sherlock felt a deep, primal pull to do something for this intimate part of King John, and yet he did not know what to do.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock writhed, his arms trembling as he grasped the bed. “Yes, oh, please, yes!” The skirt of his dress bounced with John’s movements.
William grinned. “Your shoes confirmed that the rushes and coriander were used in an herbal capacity, and that you did not merely come across them in a garden, otherwise there would be much more dirt and mud present. There was a similar dearth of clues on your arm. I would see a great deal of evidence there if you had actually assisted in a childbirth, which told me that your patient is still expecting.”
John brightened, ignoring Sherlock. “I would like that very much, Father.”
“Good. Now undress me.”
WATSON
Desire had become a mighty force in John, yet he wanted to take his time. He wanted so much from Sherlock, and he was willing to wait for it. Leisurely, John started to massage Sherlock’s rear.
He told you this?
After they had held each other for a long while, Sherlock decided that the air was too serious between them. He knew how he could change that. “Did you know that my brother is sleeping with Lestrade?”
“Me too.” Still holding Sherlock’s length with one hand, John sealed his mouth around it, closing his eyes and humming softly.
Remarkable. Incredible.
“What?” I was astonished. “You don’t think he’s got a first name?”
For a moment I was stunned, but I’d been in much stranger places than this, and before long I was marching up to the desk. It wouldn’t have shocked me if the man at the computer had given me a hesitant look, given my simple getup of plaid and jeans. Fortunately, the man at the computer didn’t seem to notice. He was nice enough to me when I asked which way Bertie Wooster was. Mentioning that he’d been informed that Mr. Wooster was expecting a guest, he told me to head over to apartment 3A.
When I asked him about it, Bertie went into a sulk. He told me he wasn’t in the mood to talk about it just then, but he invited me to see him that weekend at his flat. In the meantime, he pulled out his phone and played some kind of cartoonish game, though he didn’t really seem to focus on it.
Eventually, the enrapturing aura of excitement around Sherlock and his violin became too much for John to resist. Feeling an irresistible desire to be alone with his servant, John proclaimed that they ought to find a room to stay in. His obedient servant agreed, naturally.
That’s all still true, but wow, you should see Bertie’s flat!
WATSON
Ha! No doubt you threatened him, or extracted a false confession through some pretence. He has no deep interest in me. Lestrade is a lively, likeable man. I am distant, petty, and thoroughly unlikeable. He does not have feelings for me.
“You don’t have to. I can compensate any of these caravans for making room for you during the journey. I know many of them would agree to it, especially since it’s always good to have another set of hands.”
When Jeeves had got my tea in front of me, he had used the word “sir” as one might when pointing a customer to the right aisle; it was plain and polite. I didn’t know it at the time, but this was the default option. To Jeeves, most people were lost customers looking for the right aisle.
He ran his hands through Sherlock’s hair, sending ripples of pleasure through the servant that cascaded down his body. The king leaned closer, trapping his humble servant against the bed.
SHERLOCK
“Oh, Sherlock, yes…”
Sherlock chuckled. The thought of pristine, placid Mycroft looking for a loud, dirty baby was entertaining. “We’ll find some other way.”
Sherlock noticed that Lestrade was wearing new gloves, made of a deep red that showed the fingertips, which was noteworthy because the weather was warm today, though it could possibly become colder in the evening.
The sponge moved to the ruler’s shoulder, and gradually, down his left arm. “Why did you call yourself Sherlock, then?” John asked. Now that John knew the truth, it wasn’t hard to see that William Holloway had disguised his name as Sherlock Holmes, but he did not know why the king had done so.
The king stood up from the bench, studied the clothes hanging on the line with interest, and took from the arrangement a coat that was dry enough. Sherlock had to run a few errands today. There was no doubt that the lord of the kingdom could not be seen seeking the items he wished to acquire.
Continuing to hold Sherlock’s wrist, the king guided his timid, acquiescent servant back onto the bed.
Well, you’ve been wasting my time, that’s what. You already know how to dance.
“The belts, sir,” John pleaded quietly. His body was turned away, though Sherlock could clearly see how aroused his beloved was, and the king could certainly empathise.
A musky, intoxicating scent that must have been trapped under royal clothes seemed to fill the caravan, filling Sherlock with a deep, powerful need to make that scent part of himself.
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock glanced at each item, and then at John. “Sir,” he said, in awe.
This had been incredible, and yet there were a million other things John wished to do with Sherlock. It was all the king wanted, to share everything in his life with his cherished servant.
“Um, yes, sir,” Sherlock murmured, wondering if he was actually asleep, in a fantastic dream.
“Scared?” King John asked, his voice soft, though his eyes demanded answers nonetheless. “Of what?”
Language, Sherlock!
John was staring wide-eyed at him, all gestures of polite deference forgotten. “I’m sorry, what did just you say?”
Most breweries were small affairs run from households for additional income. Brewing was an activity in virtually every town, but this was a remarkably sizeable place for a brewery.
When he chooses to be, Sherlock Holmes is a charming man. He can smile quite warmly when he wishes to put a client at ease. It’s astounding, really, when surely he has never observed a smile himself. But when he is on the hunt, using all his deductive powers to apprehend his target… his smile becomes something else entirely, more powerful, more intriguing… and it is something I have truly never witnessed on any other face.
The nobleman said nothing. Of course, his statement had been clear, and there was no need to repeat himself. Stifling a sigh, John resigned himself to his own bed, the smaller of the two though still comfortable. He was sorry to see William take to his own bed without John, pulling the sheer curtains around the royal bed, shutting himself in.
You’re utterly transparent, Sherlock. Now that you have come to depend on Doctor Watson, you are afraid of losing him.
WATSON
Sherlock glanced at the training ring. “Will you be sparring more?”
Watching John clean was far more fascinating than Sherlock could explain. It did give him guilt that he was standing uselessly while John worked, but what was truly remarkable was that John did not begrudge him for it. It had seemed reasonable that John had not been comfortable asking King William to pick up after himself, but the man persisted in doing everything even when Sherlock had finally become able to express his true self in John’s company.
“Very well, sir.”
“Right now, this is what I need, Sherlock.” His grip on Sherlock’s hips as secure as ever, King John leaned in again, and once more made it very difficult for Sherlock to think clearly.
Yet, not all the tournament’s contestants fascinated Sherlock equally. In fact, just one of the warriors had dominated Sherlock’s interest.
“It’s all right if you didn’t mean what you said,” Sherlock uttered, his voice light and tenuous.
Once she left, Sherlock gave a cursory glance at the crowd. There was nothing that could keep his attention. People laughed and drank and sang songs. He wondered if, in the days before William had selfishly taken the kind apothecary away, John had ever come here. It was likely that John had kept his friends and colleagues enthralled with his mysteries. As irrational as it was, though, Sherlock preferred to think that the stories were only for him. Maybe for their future children, too.
“I am as human as you are. You are being childish, Sherlock.”
Perhaps a ritzy building like this had a cleaning service, as well, or it was Jeeves who kept the flat shining clean. I was certain that a PA didn’t do that kind of thing, though.
“I want to remember the journey. I know it’s awfully sentimental, but our travels meant so much to me, because each of these things reminds me of a time that I shared with you.”
There were many flowers around the temple, which was surely appreciated by the bees. It was also appreciated by Sherlock, who was seeing varieties of flowers that he had never before laid eyes on.
“Thank you very much. That’s largely thanks to John, I should add.”
It was rather annoying when Mycroft knew something that Sherlock didn’t. “What are you talking about?”
LESTRADE
At first, John wasn’t sure what Sherlock was referring to. But all too quickly, he remembered the words he had foolishly allowed to slip from his mouth in the fortress, when he had been overcome with his feelings for his servant, too affected by what they had done together and too caught up in thoughts of sharing all his life with Sherlock.
John wished that Sherlock would stay with him for the rest of the day, that their respective roles in society did not keep them apart outside of God’s house. At the first thought of such a wish, however, John was compelled to swallow hard, for if he followed his treacherous, longing thoughts through to their end, God and society both would be appalled, and the former soldier did not need to give either any further cause to reject him.
That night, John slept soundly, Sherlock’s back against his chest.
“M’lord…”
MYCROFT
John was certain that he was beaming like the lovesick fool that he was as he carried the basket for Sherlock, who moved between the trees with such grace and beauty that he might as well have been dancing.
It made much more sense now that this man, in either identity, always carried guilt with him. John had been very fortunate to win Sherlock’s affections, but those affections were not William’s to give. John wasn’t meant for such gifts. But… “I am content to be your servant, m’lord.”
Upon the end of the war, he learned that his trouble was far from over. His father’s gambling habit had sent the family further into debt, and his sister was turning down the proposal of every man who tried, much to the irritation of their mother. His household was only a source of tension, not comfort.
Jeeves drifted into the sitting room and placed my tea before me. “Your tea, sir.”
SHERLOCK
He had once told Sherlock about his dark moods, those times when the emptiness of his life had kept him from acting the part of the charismatic, optimistic king. John no longer had those dark moods, and it was because of this beautiful man who had become his precious maid.
“For God’s sake—I have feelings for another man!”
“I’m smitten with my PA—the chap who works for me. That’s not good, is it?”
“Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.” Again, John’s fingers slid into Sherlock, making him writhe from the pleasant sensations that teased him for what was to come. “You’re so gorgeous. Is this good?”
John did not doubt his ability to inconspicuously acquire some of those tools from the dungeon. He was uncertain, however, of whether or not he could deny his own desires until evening.
You may leave now.
“It was more than just a gown. There was also a bonnet, a lady’s gloves, and, well,” John cleared his throat, “a woman’s undergarments.”
“He’s gone hysterical,” Sherlock remarked. “Utterly mad.”
Mycroft! I know you’re here! You planned this all along, didn’t you? Somehow you knew it would happen this way. You knew what would happen to me!
Mycroft blinked. A moment of thought passed, and then it was Mycroft who was laughing, in his way that was more contained than Sherlock’s, though somehow just as mirthful. “I’ve been delinquent in my responsibilities as elder brother, it seems—given the seven years difference, and the total lack of any other person to teach you.”
I nodded in understanding, even if I didn’t quite believe that someone as casual and young as Bertie had a PA.
Sherlock wished he had a magic spell that would ease John’s worries. He tried to recall when John had called him only by his name. There were moments of passion, when John had been too beautifully overwhelmed to monitor himself, and then, there had been the other place. “There was a time when you called me Sherlock. At least, when I reminded you to.”
LESTRADE
Absorbing so much information about his instrument, and playing for the enjoyment of so many people, Sherlock smiled with joy all the time, floating through the festival grounds with a lively spirit.
This revolver was the murder weapon. It has the correct indentation for being thrown from the room, as the murderer must have done. The other is not damaged enough for that.
Of course. You have to pay attention to your partner, for one thing! And then there are the turns. You can start turns once you are comfortable with the steps. Imagine turning the box just a little every time, you know.
“That I do. I will see you around the castle, then.” With one last encouraging smile, Father Lestrade left them. It occurred to John that Lestrade oversaw sermons and confessions in the castle. Maybe he was going to hear more confessions at this moment. How much that man must know that he couldn’t share with the new servant!
What did he want?
Sherlock smiled. John was a generous soul. “There is something I am interested in.”
Standing there was the splendid king he had seen in the tournament. Despite no longer being outfitted in plate armour, the king was no less splendid now than he had been before. Being this close, Sherlock could clearly see that the king had a broad, athletic build. He was not wearing the regal garments he had worn before the crowd, but his fine garments still proclaimed his nobility.
I’m sure I don’t know.
John chuckled, full of happiness. He was so hopeful and in love.
WATSON (O.S.)
Sherlock was grateful for every moment he had with John. This had been true ever since they first met, in the temple where John gave regular offerings to whatever local god it was that he served. The priest, who seemed humble at first glance, yet revealed hidden depths when he kept his pride in the king’s presence, had fascinated the pharaoh. John displayed all due respect to the pharaoh, of course, yet he did not cower or grovel before Sherlock. He was honest and forthright while still being respectful and considerate, which was unusual.
“It’s only a servant position, John. Of course, you don’t have to take the offer. But I know you’d like to find honest work to help your family, so I thought I would mention it to you. There are worse places to work in than a nice castle. His Highness has other staff waiting on him, so I doubt your duties would be strenuous. He just wants someone he can always depend on.”
“If nothing else,” Sherlock said, “we’ll have better music to have a dull evening to.”
Filled with strong feelings that made his body warm and his heart even warmer, John paused long enough to answer him. “It’s me. I’ll always be here for you, Sherlock,” he said, and then took William in his mouth again, rising and falling, as encouraging as he could be.
Sherlock must’ve noticed John’s confusion, because he tried to explain. “Music isn’t something that a commoner discusses with a noble, right, sir? You probably know so much about notes and instruments and so forth. I’m not meant to know that much about it, sir.”
“What did you think about what the first monk said?” the king asked him.
The hands on Sherlock’s hips became tighter, more possessive, and in the next moment, Sherlock felt the splendid heaviness of the magnificent king push into him. The breath was knocked out of Sherlock’s chest, and the servant’s very soul seemed to come alive throughout his body, especially where he was joined with the king.
Sherlock wished to do something to comfort his master. Ceasing his childish eavesdropping for the time being, he returned to the brewery, where he was generously given a warm mug of ale by one of the brewers. Soon, he was approaching the king with the mug in hand.
Sherlock placed his heavy bag down on the ground. “Do you need any help, sir?”
John tasted wonderful. Reluctantly, William pulled away, taking a few breaths to become reacquainted with air. John did the same, smiling in such a grateful way that William longed to take him to bed at once.
“He couldn’t stay with me all the time, but then I could carve something inspired by his story, knowing that he would know its name. Oh, my healer had treated me and generously shared his time with me, comforting a common soldier with his gentle tone. He did not know I was a nobleman, and still he cared so much for me. It was my pleasure to thank that kind man with a gift.”
Such kind praise from the king made Sherlock smile, despite the polite air he was trying to maintain. “Thank you, sir.”
His heart pounding, John had to take a deep breath to steady himself. “Yes, Sherlock.” He sat next to Sherlock, and held him close, feeling the fabric of a gown and apron under his hands. “You don’t have to fight it. I’ll take care of you.”
“It will only be a small affair. Just half the kingdom,” Sherlock said. “Bring a date, if you like. Unless he’s busy conducting the entire ceremony, which is probable.”
Although, the fact that many of the workers seemed to be women was consistent with the place being a brewery, since in Sherlock’s experience, brewing was traditionally the work of women.
That hardly concerns me. You know how I came to be where I am. I have enough private information on nearly every powerful figure in this city to keep myself safe.
SHERLOCK
am the one who ought to be concerned.
“That’s your car,” I repeated, still having difficultly associating it with the man in front of me. “And you have a PA to drive it.”
“Great! That’s great.” I smiled, thrilled that I could do some small thing that might make Bertie happier. I wasn’t sure if Jeeves was as dramatic as some people I could name, but it was fun to imagine how Jeeves would make his feelings known to Bertie, and how happy my friend would be.
When John’s trousers were opened, and the sweet man pleaded for Sherlock’s love, the king continued his path, sheltering John lovingly and warmly in his throat. It was pure pleasure to hear John’s cries grow louder, just as it was deeply soothing to witness John shiver from ecstasy in the intimate sanctuary of their shared home.
Sherlock gasped sharply. His master felt irresistibly hot and heavy. There was coarse hair that felt exquisite against Sherlock’s fingers.
Among the wide variety of skilled soldiers present in the tournament were members of royalty, including kings who had earned honours in battle. It was one of these kings, a handsome man with light-coloured hair and broad shoulders, who had caught Sherlock’s eye, ever since the servant had sneaked away from his boring duties to watch one of the exciting rounds of the archery competition. In that event, archers managed brilliant shots, one after another, competing against the shots of their opponents. The king had matched the efforts of the most renowned bowman in the country, and certainly defeated the other archers he competed against, none of whom were novices.
are aware of, perhaps. Gentlemen and ladies who are waited upon and have no profession. Then there are the ones who work. Dressmakers, piano tuners, and the like. I am a gentleman, Doctor Watson, but I refuse to sit idly at home, waited upon constantly. I have my mind and skills, and I
The continuous movement of the caravan stopped. Sherlock put away the bow and looked out the front of the caravan.
While they drove on, through fresh air and past calming scenery of hills and streams, the desire that had been fuming inside of John fell gradually to a low, manageable simmer. He never forgot, however, that Sherlock was sitting right next to him, and he could not help having one or two private visions of what he might do with his beloved servant sometime soon.
“Oh.” John was not sure if that was good or bad.
John quickly marched to where Sherlock was bouncing on his feet. “Yes, Sherlock?” the king asked, smiling.
Sherlock’s grip slowly tightened on John’s. “I want to do everything for you. If I do everything for you, you’ll never have to leave me.”
WATSON
veils.”
Sherlock was truly such an enthusiastic, pretty maid. He served John so well. The king couldn’t last long at all.
He attentively learned what was boiled when, what was mashed, what was roasted, and what herbs were used. He studied the kilns and kettles and barrels. In addition, he studied various ways of warming the drink when it was at last to be consumed. Sherlock had only ever consumed ale cool, but he was shown a pointed copper cup meant for holding in a fire, and even observed a hot poker being used to stir ale to be served.
In the main sitting area of the roomy, well-ordered flat, Bertie was seated at a large sofa, leaning over his laptop on a round coffee table, which also had a mug of coffee, judging from the smell.
MYCROFT
What came over him?
“The post on your blog did as much. In any case…” His voice slowed down, and he leaned a little back. “This chain of events was able to progress as it did because you showed concern for John and spent time with him. And now, I can be honest with him about how I feel.” He paused, and smiled, an expression of gentleness that I had never seen on telly-Sherlock, and clearly it was the telly’s loss. “Thank you, Bertie.”
If you will not report me to the police, it would be in awfully bad taste for me to report you, don’t you think?
Sherlock was so excited that he could hardly sit still, and nervous as well. He didn’t want to seem entirely unsophisticated to the experienced king, so even though he struggled with these emotions, he tried to appear calm.
At last, some of the books drew his interest, on account of their bright covers. He opened them, and saw that the books in this area were well illustrated, and were written with very simple language. He could tell from the drawings, which portrayed gallant knights, beautiful nobles, and fantastic animals, that these were fairy tales, probably intended for the children of the educated classes.
Before Sherlock could object, as a lowly servant ought to when his master offered any kind of assistance, King John was picking up Sherlock’s bag and bringing it into the caravan. He did so with such ease that Sherlock wondered if it was actually the same bag, or if it had not somehow been magically replaced with an identical but lighter piece of luggage.
Oh, I beg your pardon, madam.
I’m not foolish. Obviously Mycroft pays you to look after me.
LESTRADE
SHERLOCK
Sherlock smiled. “King William is far luckier. I hope he has treated you respectfully?”
“Um, if it’s all right with you. And this time, sir, don’t hold back.” As had sometimes happened before, the courage that Sherlock had briefly been able to summon was already dissipating. Staring down at the floor, Sherlock mumbled, “I want to swallow your seed, sir. Maybe then I can give you the baby you want, somehow.”
Oh. Very well.
My brother Mycroft.
With a sharp gasp, Sherlock blushed again, and nodded shyly.
He leaned forward, looking at the laptop again, and then turned to me, one hand gesturing enthusiastically toward the screen and another toward himself.
Would you share yourself with me?
The trainees took notice of John at once, and when the king was introduced to them, they greeted him appropriately. Their courtesy was flattering, but John wanted them to know that he was as much a warrior as a king. He volunteered to spar with the young soldiers, so that they could learn a thing or two.
“I have a vital request for Lestrade,” William said. “I am going to ask him to give our baby to us.”
John moved down the bed; at first, Sherlock feared that John was leaving, but that fear was soon put to rest. Propping himself up over Sherlock’s lower half, John made an incredibly tempting image, especially when he licked his lips.
“I’m not worried.” The king held Sherlock closer, such that the servant felt his master’s chest against his back. Sherlock could not recall a time when he had felt more warm or cared for than this. “I can take down anything that’s out there. My sword is here, and my bow and arrows, too. I’ll use them if I have to. I’ll protect my precious servant.”
King John’s shirt was gone. Sherlock saw his broad chest, and the rough hair that the servant had longed to see again. There was an ache within Sherlock. He felt terribly empty.
“I love you, too, sir,” Sherlock replied, his voice very soft.
WATSON
“I don’t think we should be talking about this, sir?”
It was also possible that John would never see him again.
Sherlock had only been smitten further by John’s modesty, and his deepened voice showed it. “Is that what you were doing? Killing the mood?” He kissed John’s ankle. “You had me fooled.”
“John and I were wondering something, if you wouldn’t mind one little quick question, Jeeves.”
“Mycroft would not deceive me.” Sherlock was struck by how monumental that statement was, and if the raised eyebrows on John’s face were any indication, John was also moved, but Sherlock could think on these feelings some other time. “Anyway, living in this castle does tend to have a nullifying effect on one’s conception of rules.”
The sun had set, and now the only light in the room came from the fireplace. The flames flickered quietly. It was a peaceful, discreet atmosphere.
I expected Bertie to get that the issue was about what I had just asked. In fact, I was hoping for it, since I admittedly didn’t know how to bring it up myself.
“Don’t you like him?” I asked frankly, and heard a startled gasp from Bertie. I was sorry to make him nervous by being so forthright, but
It was a charming experience, Sherlock thought for not the first time, simply to speak openly with John. “It is strange, though. My brother has always despised the priesthood. He told me that I ought to confess nothing.”
“You are a kind man. I am sorry, Your Majesty. You deserve the best possible servant.”
“It’s hard to miss. I can’t believe you live here.”
“You could work for much better people.”
They spent a long time in the library together, but King John eventually had to leave, as the town mayor wished to speak with him, and Sherlock was left with the rest of the day to himself. The king told Sherlock that he was free to explore the library and to ask for any assistance he might need from the library keepers. He assured Sherlock that they would be happy to assist the personal servant of a king.
William clung to the possibility that none of this was true. “You presume to know much about him, Lestrade.” Even if the priest had spent some company with Montgomery, it was difficult to imagine anything more than a few words awkwardly exchanged. “He couldn’t have confessed any of this to you.”
A hand was placed on his shoulder, more gently than before.
“What a strange being that baby is! Making those different sounds for different things. And being so fascinated by everything!”
John listened to the door close soundly behind Sherlock as he exited the chapel. He wished that he could have kept holding onto Sherlock. There were so many expectations on his lord’s shoulders that kept William from being happy.
John smiled warmly, as a husband would to his spouse, as one who was at last not afraid to rely on another.
Sherlock turned to the sofa. He reached for it, slowly enough so that the king could tell him not to if he was not allowed, and when the king said nothing, Sherlock touched the plush surface of the sofa. It was certainly more comfortable than any bed Sherlock had ever known.
SHERLOCK
“Look familiar?” John asked, grinning.
Sherlock was blushing sharply now. “Yes, sir.”
John also saw that there was a smaller, much less imposing bed. Its sheets and pillows were finer than most, but the arrangement did not compare to the first. There was no canopy or curtains to cover it.
Now how could you know that!
Jealous, brother mine? Interesting.
“Almost.” Sherlock wanted John to be comfortable. He also loved to touch John this way.
“Well, sir, they were talking about you. Nothing bad—they merely wondered if the king would be settling down in the castle very soon, for good this time.” Sherlock’s voice became softer. “They thought that you might miss your queen, and would spend some time with her.”
How incredible it would be, Sherlock thought with a half-rational mind, for that thick pleasure that King John was driving into him to spill, to empty into the servant; could he then give his master a child? Is that what the lady in the story did for the great monarch? Was it a story of a strong, virile king impregnating his modest, faithful maid?
Sherlock had pushed his way through the crowd, so that he could move close enough to see everything he could possibly see. He was able to glimpse the magnificent picture that the king made as he was poised to shoot, the arrow sticking out an inch past the bow. The arrows moved so quickly that Sherlock could only follow their path belatedly, though he tried to watch their movement as best he could. He could not fathom why, but he needed to see as much of those arrows, as much of this skilled force coming from the king’s capable hand, as he possibly could.
I have noted it, all the same.
“Oh, nice,” I said, continuously astounded by how friendly this man was.
I imagine she’d lament over her misfortune. How pitiful it must be to have been cursed with us. One blind as a mole, the other with skin of the wrong colour!
Sherlock calmly bound John’s wrists together. “You are mine,” he said, his tone low and dangerous. He poured some of the oil from the bottle into his hands, and began to massage John’s rear.
, John.” Sherlock sighed. “As ludicrous as it seems to me, I am a god. I can’t help it any more than you can help being human. Gods do one thing and humans do another. Gods go to one place, and humans go to another. Don’t you see, John? We won’t go to the same place after death. My place will be with the gods, and yours will be somewhere else.”
WATSON
That was where King John would be waiting.
LESTRADE
LESTRADE
What is it?
WATSON
“Of course not.” It seemed absurd to me that anybody would so private as to keep their first name secret.
He would never let his family lose their house and shop. But he needed to make sure that he wasn’t failing Sherlock. It was ridiculous to think that the nobleman’s day might have ever been brightened by John’s appearance the way that John’s had been uplifted by Sherlock’s reassuring presence, but Sherlock had said that John was his friend. John owed it to Sherlock to tell him that they wouldn’t be seeing each other anymore.
Lestrade shook his head. He spoke more calmly, but no less deliberately. “Why do you think he does it in secret?”
He lives in a block of flats called Berkeley Mansions, in Berkeley Square, Mayfair. For anyone who doesn’t know, this is Posh Land. Prestigious buildings surround well-kept gardens, and you can find corporate headquarters and upscale shops all around there. If you’re familiar with the game Monopoly—the typical UK type, with London locations—you might know that Mayfair is the most expensive property on the board. Well, there’s a reason for that.
His king had become quiet suddenly, but that was not peculiar. The hour was late, and no doubt King John was becoming very tired. His fatigue must have been compounded by the chore of soothing his meek servant’s pathetic fears with talk.
MYCROFT
What are you trying to tell me? He’s not a handsome man? I don’t care. What I care about is the man who has been so kind to me.
“Oh.” Abruptly, the heat that had been building in Sherlock intensified tenfold. The feelings he had tried to quell hit him like a gust of wind. It was urgent that he stay in this bed. “I could help you with that, sir,” he said, driven to the improper words by the precipitous force of his need for his king.
“But then sir, what will you do, without siring an heir?”
He managed to open his eyes at some point, only because he wished to admire his dear master, and witnessed William touching himself as he satisfied John. It was more than John could bear. His tears were a mixture of passion and love. He cried Sherlock’s name.
“You really think he wouldn’t mind my asking?”
Oh. In all this, I’d forgotten that I’m with Scotland Yard!
LESTRADE
Figured as much.
WATSON
William made to bolt to the door, but Lestrade, tougher than William thought a priest ought to be, caught the arm of the king, who ought to have been stronger for having been a soldier. Lestrade held him with all the force of his natural obstinacy. “Release me!” William demanded.
WATSON
For a moment we both thought in silence, then Bertie spoke again. “Oh, but I don’t mean to make this all about me. You must think me awfully self-absorbed. Does all continue well between you and Sherlock?”
“I thought he was unintelligent,” Sherlock remarked offhandedly, but at John’s glare he quickly added, “However, I learned better. It was only that he thought himself to be unintelligent.”
LESTRADE
John blinked, stunned. “That would work?”
“My sweet Sherlock. I don’t take that lightly. It means a lot to me.”
“I’m already looking forward to them, then.”
“But I thought I would be with you, sir.” It was difficult to keep the desperation of out his voice, and Sherlock was not really sure that he was able to. “Couldn’t I be useful to you, somehow?”
“Jeeves,” I said, somewhat awkwardly, not knowing what his first name was, “I can’t say I know you all that well, but I know Bertie, and I know he’ll do what it takes to make a relationship work. He certainly likes you enough. If you like him, let him know.”
“John… Are you leaving?”
“That sounds lovely. What will you two be doing for your date?”
Reluctantly, John said, “Well, that’s true enough.”
“I was going to take myself in hand,” his master said, his voice rough and low, “and think about my sweet, innocent servant, who knows so little of the world, who was at the mercy of his master. I brought oil just to put on my hand, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t put my hand down my trousers and pretend it was you.”
Sherlock had seemed happy at the fortress, and for a while after, but slowly, his mood had sunk. He was now sullenly brushing his dark, curly hair with a mirror in his hand.
“Sherlock!”
“The beautiful servant,” the king said, “so unfamiliar with the ways of the world… How could you know it was wrong? How could you know of all the opportunities that wait out there for you beyond me? Oh, but you were so tempting, and I had not the strength to turn you away. My dear Sherlock… My pretty servant…”
When he did take breaks from playing the instrument, Sherlock received advice from some of the musicians at the festival, and learned the basics for many techniques that he could rehearse later. He was a sponge of information, asking every violinist he could find about various songs and skills.
mine.” John’s tone was low and dangerous. He almost pitied any person who ever tried to take Sherlock away from him. “How does this feel?”
Sherlock was finished with secrets. “Nobody is here but us. Tell me,” Sherlock humphed defiantly, kicking one leg over the other, “or I’ll tell the guards you snuck out.”
He dipped his hand into the jar. “May I, Sherlock?”
What cruel plan have you devised for me, hmm?
Somehow, learning about Mycroft’s cross-dressing had paved the way for them to finally talk about the past. It was just odd enough that it suited them. “It wasn’t a good reason to make me king,” Sherlock admitted. “It was obvious that your strategy won the war, not some injudicious prince charging blindly into the fray.” He had a serious question to ask Mycroft. “If you would like to be king again…”
Because I’m Holmes’s new assistant. Not that he needs one, mind you. I’m only a medical man offering his knowledge to a private detective.
The king’s good will dissipated away, his entire being set ill at ease.
I’d never seen Jeeves so tremendously overcome with embarrassment and joy that he burst out laughing, nor had I considered it possible, but there it was, by Jove, and I laughed too.
LESTRADE
After services that week, John approached Father Lestrade and agreed to head with him to the castle, far away from town, far away from a fascinating tall man with a dependable blue scarf.
Until death, I wonder?
“Absolutely, sir.”
Sherlock waved his hand in dismissal. “On the contrary, a man with his connections is a useful contact. Besides, this circle of acquaintances that Bertie describes seems mainly invested in escaping unwanted engagements. Nobody consults Jeeves about murders or other things more in my line. For us not to assist each other is an appalling waste of assets. Much like you and Bertie get together as Two Bloggers and offer each other advice, why shouldn’t Reggie and I share resources as Two Consultants? In any event, if Sherlock Holmes and Reginald Jeeves become allies, then it must follow that Dr. Watson and Mr. Wooster will have better stories for their blogs. You see, John, all four of us would benefit, as would the public of London.”
Apparently the father was also impressed, because he laughed and affectionately tousled the shock of dark hair on top of the baby’s head. One of the father’s friends called him away for a moment, and the woman sat patiently, holding the baby with the practiced care of a woman with other children.
He’s… He’s…
Nonetheless, most of John hoped that Sherlock would read the letter, and visit him in what was to become his new home.
“Goodness, yes. Also, a little out of breath. Corsets aren’t easy.”
“I see. What’s the trick? Found a lady to marry you for show?”
Sherlock’s eyes were roaming over John’s form. “More, John. I need you.”
SHERLOCK
Sherlock thought that perhaps the king wanted some time to himself. He hadn’t directed Sherlock to follow him, after all. Unfortunately, sitting outside became so much less pleasant with his master gone. The stars seemed to become duller, and the air became colder. The fire was not as fascinating as it had been before. The other members of their convoy, who sat around their own fires and talked of nothing interesting, seemed more remote, somehow.
“Well, all right.” I could see that a break of sorts might do some good, and help get us back on track.
Do as you wish.
Sherlock hesitated. “It’s nothing, sir.”
“Then, what is bothering you?”
Once he was inside the warm tavern, Sherlock loosened his blue scarf and claimed a small table in the corner. A young boy and his older brother had sat in this spot long ago, one excitedly deducing the history of each bar patron, the other quietly sipping his common ale with an amused smile.
It was rare to see his precious servant so forthright, though it was becoming less rare. William would do anything for John, and trust him with anything. If John needed to act in William’s stead, then that was acceptable. “You will speak to Lestrade for me, then?”
Of course not.
“Your Majesty,” Sherlock began, bowing his head in greeting, “how was your meeting with the mayor?”
Just one question Doctor, if it’s not too much trouble. Since you live with the man, is it possible you’ve met Holmes’s brother?
Happiness and gratitude washed over Sherlock’s pretty face. “Oh, I suppose so.”
He would find sleep elusive for another reason entirely.
“No, though it may prove useful for a case someday. I have a more personal interest in the book at present. My brother has a PA, and she must certainly be associated with your network, Jeeves. I’m prepared to cut a deal. I want whatever compromising information your group possesses on Mycroft Holmes.”
“Oh, Sherlock, I’ll keep saying it to you, I promise.” John took Sherlock into his arms, and let his precious maid cry on his shoulder. “I love you.”
John wished he could share his feelings with him. As it was, he could only hope that he had served King William well enough last night, and that John might be forgiven for defying what was proper. Carefully, John grasped William’s hand to extricate himself.
Sherlock’s fate was to move from one servant position to the next. Employers never wanted him for very long.
“It’s a waste of time,” William muttered, his chin held high. “Proper noblemen do not invest their efforts in such mundane tasks.”
“You might want to come out here, Sherlock,” the king called from where he was driving the caravan. “We’re coming up on our first town since we left yours.”
“He did so much more than heal my wounds. He spoke to me, banishing my apathetic thoughts with every word, occupying my mind with stories. One story he told me was a mystery, involving a horse with a silver mark on its forehead. He constructed the tale, and let me solve it.”
“M’lord, what you asked before, did you mean it?”
WATSON
Before he could stop himself, John kept his master close to him with one arm, and touched William’s dark hair with his other hand. Only when he had done it did he remember that he was the one who submitted to William, and he worried that William would be angry. Nervously, John stammered, “S-Sir…”
Actually, I moved in because…
Stroking himself with his own touch again, John made one last cry, and spilled himself in his hands. He fell back onto the bed, overwhelmed. The relief was intense. He should have been mortified with what he had just done with his servant, but it was hard to regret anything when Sherlock made him feel so good, in body and in spirit.
William’s hands still rested on John’s shoulders when he was dressed for bed. The tall man spoke calmly near John’s ear, “Was there something else you needed, John?”
“I suppose I am.”
WATSON
“Are you a fairy, or a bee, Sherlock?” John wondered aloud, grinning.
No more talk of this here. A constable might walk in and make sense of these riddles.
Sherlock, you didn’t need to tell Watson…!
“Were you remembering when we first met, Sherlock?”
William might have been jealous if he did not know the priest. Probably John had gone to the priest to seek counsel as William himself had done in the past. Lestrade was one of few individuals who had the king’s trust. Was it not because of Lestrade, after all, that William had John by his side at last?
“Sir…”
SHERLOCK
John turned back to his servant at once. He was sorely tempted to touch Sherlock again. “I think you’d fit in very well. Isn’t there always a charming beauty for the king to win over?”
Once Sherlock was equipped with everything he needed, he raised the violin once more, and entered into a kind of beautiful frenzy. He played the instrument for much of the day, to the delight of many visitors and artists at the festival.
Well, Holmes, I’m not sure I’m the one you want to be sitting with, if I may say so?
He would never do so, much as I will not.
It was nice that Bertie didn’t seem to think badly of me. “I can’t seem to focus on anything other than him. It’s no wonder I only ever seem to write about him in my blog.” I turned my laptop more toward Bertie, so that he could see it. “At least he hasn’t figured it out yet, though I’m sure he will any day now. Then he’ll kick me out of the flat.”
Lestrade nodded. “Of course. Think it over, that’s the proper thing to do. Let me know after services this week.”
John brightened when he saw the water in the bath. “Oh, you’ll let me wash you again? But you didn’t have to run the bath, sir.”
“Some ale, sir?” he asked when the king noticed him.
MYCROFT
What did you tell Lestrade?
John seemed happy enough for the change in topic, though he was confused by this new problem. “What’s wrong with it?”
“You will serve me well,” William said. “It is a fair exchange for what I have done for your family. You should also know, I have made it clear that your sister is in charge of your family’s expenses—she may not be the most exceptionally clever individual, but it seemed to me that she had more of a head for frugality than either parent, at least as far as her potential is concerned once she receives some guidance in those matters, and I have made some arrangements for such guidance to be provided.”
“Oh, yes.” That was a little better, but still John was very quiet.
“But I do want to help you, sir.” With a deferential manner, Sherlock sat down on the bed, next to King John.
John agreed, already knowing that he was going to take the job.
Days later, when all the items he ordered had arrived, Sherlock’s burning feelings—curiosity one among many—could wait no longer. He found his beloved servant in his quarters at night.
WATSON
In disbelief, and with a growing smile, John whispered, “My God.”
In your right hand.
The king gave him a long, measuring look, which nearly made Sherlock squirm. “Do you have a name?”
“I hardly think you needed my help, sir.” In shyness, Sherlock averted his gaze from the noble presence that seemed to take up so much of the bench. “How did you know I was cheering you on?”
Throughout the carriage ride back to the village, and indeed, while they walked to the inn, John continued to ponder how he might speak to Sherlock about this. However, it did not seem possible to him to ask for what his body longed for in any polite manner. He could not think of a way to phrase it as even somewhat decent.
SHERLOCK
“I’m sure you know that the present King Holloway took over from his brother two years ago, when the war ended. Do you know why the change happened?”
Blushing as much as before, Lestrade mumbled, “What Mycroft does with those garments is his own business.”
Sherlock blushed, and played nervously with the hem of his dress. “I’m glad it pleases you. I don’t know why I wanted to wear this, but it felt right, somehow. I confess, I like being your maid.”
SHERLOCK
“What do you think of my caravan?” the king asked.
LESTRADE
No. It is for… research.
Sherlock simpered, and John fancied he could light their way himself with the pride he felt burning in his chest.
“N-No, eyes on me, Sherlock.” As soon as his eyes had begun to wander, Sherlock was called back to the reassurance of King John’s attention. “Good, Sherlock… Keep your eyes on me…”
Sherlock worried that, by being such a nervous and inexpert servant in this matter, he had let his master down. In any case, he wasn’t brave enough to ask about that. At least he was sure that he had helped his king in some small way, and King John seemed reasonably at ease. His master would now be able to find sleep, even if what they had done together had been nothing spectacular for him.
“This
John wanted to do anything that would make King William happy, and he was certain that reuniting him with his brother would do just that, but for now, John wanted to pray. He would pray, and yet he would also imagine that Sherlock was sitting at his side, commenting on his prayer and making him laugh. Besides, with all these sinful thoughts he was entertaining, John believed it would be a miracle if God listened to him at all anyway.
“It’s all right, Sherlock. I’m here,” the king murmured, lying down behind Sherlock, wrapping a warm arm around him. “I don’t usually do things like this. I’ve never held a servant like this before. But, you looked so scared. Do you feel safe now?”
“To thank you, for your support. Didn’t I tell you that?” King John took back the hand that had been touching Sherlock’s face.
“Ohh, in your story, s-sir… Is this what the m-monarch did to his beloved?”
As William was sorting his papers, his day’s work accounted for, he inquired after John’s whereabouts of a maid who was to clean the office. She replied that she had seen John speaking to Father Lestrade in the chapel. Whatever they had discussed, she said, their conversation had been animated indeed.
Feeling encouraged, John smiled wide. “That’s all I need.”
“It has a musical sound when falling from your lips. But it is also pleasing when you call me Jeeves.”
WATSON
Dotingly, John touched Sherlock’s face. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“Yet I can’t control myself as you do. When I’m close to you or I think of you, it’s so hard not to beg you to take me, in any way you like.”
“Come back down, Sherlock. There’s more I want to show you.”
Understand clearly, Doctor, that I do not need your assistance.
Though it was not particularly chivalrous of him, he could see well Sherlock’s slim breeches, and the servant’s pert little rump, which was usually hidden from John’s view by the servant’s long tunic. At this moment, John could see how Sherlock’s buttocks moved smoothly as one elegant leg rose after the other. His fingers itched to hold that part of Sherlock, to bring his cherished one close to his chest as he cupped Sherlock’s rear and listened to the longing whine that would escape his servant.
John sat upon him, whispering and moving with more devotion than Sherlock could ever ask for.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock, you might want to get off now…
In any case, all of that could wait. For now, Sherlock could enjoy having what he had wanted for so long—a loving relationship with John, his partner, and husband, and soulmate.
John’s inspiring smile filled William with pride. “Yes, you’re right, sir. How did you know all that?”
John opened the dressing gown, so he could rest fully on William’s bare chest. The heat and closeness of his master made everything better. But William’s remaining underwear kept John from feeling the rest of him. And that intimate part of William seemed so hard. John fancied it would be hot to the touch. John rested his hands on that hindering piece of clothing, and gave a small tug in question.
Subtly, Sherlock touched John’s hand, so lightly that John hardly felt anything. “I would have liked to swallow your seed, sir,” he murmured.
A little out of breath when they pulled apart, Mycroft said, with half-hearted detachment, “I will find you, naturally. Enjoy your wedding,” he said cordially to Sherlock, and then left them.
WATSON
It is gratifying to hear you say so. I should credit you as well, for coming to my defence when my abilities were questioned.
Alarmed, Sherlock asked, “What is it?”
Sherlock crossed his arms. Perhaps he should have known better than to be so hopeful about this family. He still hoped, however, that there was an explanation for the evidence Mycroft had left behind.
Sherlock nodded. “I do.”
“I’m sorry to hear that, sir.” Sherlock longed to know what sort of things bothered the king. “If I may ask, you said something like that at the tournament, sir? You didn’t find it exciting. But, um, you don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to.”
“That’s all right, Father, I can handle myself.” John nodded his thanks. “I’m sure you have duties here, too.”
SHERLOCK
“Oh, sorry, not the proper term is it?” Sherlock was nearly frenzied now.
Modestly, John cracked a smirk. “Or we can get him a new corset,” he giggled. “The one I found was sort of worn.”
“The gratitude’s all mine, Jeeves.”
Taking a look at the other members of their group, John knew that, like those nobles Sherlock had overheard, many of them were probably speculating about what the king would do at the end of this journey. There were many people in this convoy who would not understand what Sherlock meant to the king. If John and his servant went for a walk, they would merely think that the king wished to stretch his legs. They would have no conception that it was time spent between a man and his beloved.
I don’t know who you are, but I am in
Sherlock, who was a young mischievous boy who had carved tools and picked locks, who had grown into an eccentric nobleman, cared not at all what the world thought of him. It was much more pleasant to be Sherlock than to be William, who had been groomed since his baptism to be a member of the ruling family.
“No, my sweet Sherlock, you don’t understand. I want you… I want you… kneeling, in front of me. Facing me.”
“I can’t believe you’re saying that to me,” John said, but he said it with joy, not pity. “I’m the luckiest man in Egypt.” He lightly touched Sherlock’s hips, and his mouth drew closer. “Can I take you like this, Sherlock?”
“Oh, yes, that’s me. Oh, blast, I should have introduced myself, shouldn’t I? I forgot to do that with John too, as a matter of fact. I suppose I seem like an awfully rude blighter to you, walking up to you like this. I’ve seen you on the telly—well, you must’ve already figured that out—but that’s hardly fair, it’s not like you’ve seen me there, I should think!”
The servant breathed a little more easily when William sat down in the water, covering most of him with almost adequate translucence, until John remembered that he had to clean his master with the sponge. He grabbed it from where it was sitting to the side, and dipped it into the bowl of soft soap.
“I’ve done my research,” Sherlock persisted, with a lowered voice, “and I know exactly who you are. You’ve made quite the cover for yourself, staying quietly in the service of a harmless socialite, but you’re one of the best-connected men in London. You know every butler, maid, and chauffeur who works for anyone of importance, or am I wrong? It all became clear to me when I found out about the Junior Ganymede. Yes, I know all about it.”
“What do you mean?”
King William…”
“Absolutely. That story was about one thing: how much I wanted you to be mine.”
William stopped in his tracks, standing a bit uncomfortably. John shuddered to think that his own stain dirtied the nobleman’s legs under the dressing gown, and immediately he regretted stopping him.
John walked over to where Sherlock was standing, gazing at a painting that depicted a mother holding her baby. “That’s a nice painting,” the king said.
William grunted in hardly-concealed gratitude, and though John could not expect to sate the heat that was calming to a simmer in his own body, he appreciated it anyway, as one of the many nice feelings that came with being held with his back to Sherlock’s chest.
“Blow out the light, Sherlock,” the king said, “and then come sit with me.”
When the king held the reins a bit closer to them both, Sherlock instinctively flinched back.
“Am I to understand that the principle to be,” Jeeves noted, “that, in the open and informal atmosphere generated by yourself and Mr. Holmes, I will find myself able to be on closer terms with Mr. Wooster?”
They left the caravan, and the king closed the door behind them.
“Yes, if that’s all right with you? I don’t want you to be scared. You may sleep with me tonight. My bed is large enough.”
“You desire me?” John asked, embarrassed. “But I’m s-sobbing and gross, m’lord!”
That was the moment when one of the nobles that King John had been conversing with, a well-dressed and finely-groomed nobleman, turned towards Sherlock with a coy, shameless smile and a shallow, flirtatious manner.
John saw that he had made a mistake. His presence had not been ignored by his master—far from it, King William was only able to relax this way because of John.
“Oh!” John cried, his body thrusting aimlessly.
The feel of Sherlock on his shoulder felt so right. “That’s much better,” the king declared.
This all sounded great, but throughout his speech I’d noticed that the tune playing softly in the background was familiar. “Sherlock, is that Lady Gaga?”
MYCROFT
“If you don’t,” I continued, “you will always wonder what could have been.”
Sherlock stopped laughing.
Everything is as it seems.
“It’s a rummy sitch,” he murmured. “Dashed awkward, by Jove.”
“I have some business to attend to later in the trade district, and perhaps after that, I will visit a few churches, if you would accompany me.”
They’re just two people like any others, and if they choose to dance, whether with words or embraces or both, if they danced one way or another, in all the ways they wished to all through their lives, then what could anyone have to say about that?
“Besides, I can understand your situation perfectly.”
John moaned so prettily, Sherlock thought. This was his soon-to-be husband, his equal.
“Did you really intend to start your prayers without my astute commentary?” Sherlock asked, with a playful smile. A nobleman eccentric enough to spend his time among the lower rungs of society, the tall figure was nonetheless dressed in fine clothes and carried himself with an elegant bearing.
The remorse in the king’s tone prompted Sherlock to quickly object. “No, sir. It may be scary at times, but that is only when I am not with you.” He hoped he wasn’t being presumptuous by saying these words. To be safe, he did not allow them to linger in the air. “This is an exciting adventure, sir. I’m only sorry that I require such coddling.”
“Y-Yes, yes, sir.”
Finally, John returned to awareness with deep breaths. His gorgeous servant was still under him. Sherlock’s fair skin was pleasantly flushed, his curls were in disarray from his head rolling around on the bed, and he was panting for breath. There was such a look of ecstasy on Sherlock’s face that John was filled with pride for having satisfied his servant so well. It had been magnificent to inundate Sherlock with so much love and devotion that Sherlock had given in to passion at last.
WATSON
“Yes, yes! I’m all yours, John.”
They soon found transportation, and once they were seated in the carriage, the doors firmly closed, Mycroft remarked, “you have another secret to share with me.”
LESTRADE
“Now please, if you don’t mind, would you keep going!”
“The code of the Woosters?”
The few possessions he could call his own were in a trunk next to the bed. These consisted of his plain clothing, which felt insufficient in this castle where everybody was dressed in finery, and a little wooden toy that one of his patients during the war had given him long ago. He considered folding all his clothes properly at least, but his life had changed fundamentally that day, and he was exhausted. He barely had enough energy to change into his simple sleeping gown.
The town Sherlock had known all his life was now fading in the distance; there were many noises from the motion of the caravans and horses; the future beckoned with its mysteries and adventures. But at that moment, Sherlock’s attention was fixed on the king, who led the entire convoy with authority even as he was plagued by some secret grief that he carried on his own.
“It’s my personal code. My full name is Bertie Wooster, you see, and a Wooster has his code. I never let a pal down, and you’re my newest pal.”
It was probably somewhat unfair for him to use his king’s newfound jealousy this way, but the desired effect occurred, as the king grunted with agreement and instantly held Sherlock close in his arms. In that wonderful position, Sherlock felt more assured than he ever had before, and he was very comfortable for a very long time.
That unselfish, determined spirit was now making love to the pharaoh, reducing him to little more than whimpers and moans of pleasure.
These words were hardly a surprise. Sherlock had always known better than to think that he could ever have the king’s heart. He had no claim on any of his master’s tender emotions. The king might someday reunite with his estranged but lawful wife, or he might take a new competent wife, or perhaps an able mistress, someone who could give the king many children. In any case, someone would come along who would fulfil the wants of both the king’s heart and body.
Considering the unfathomable change that John had wrought in Sherlock, that was a bold claim.
After a particularly long and lovely kiss, the king held Sherlock’s hand again. “Be mine, please, Sherlock. It’s wrong of me to ask you to stay devoted to me, but I don’t know what I would do if someone else won your affection.”
“Yes, you can be certain of that.”
Why do you ask, Inspector? Are you a friend of Mycroft Holmes?
John’s eyes were wide. Clearly, he was having trouble believing that. “Well, you said you like my stories.”
Sherlock asked himself, could he be like the mother in this story?
Doctor.
“You don’t have to, you know.”
Holmes? What are you doing?
“It has been a long time since I have shared a bed with anyone. I thought that I could master myself, but…”
Mycroft…? Sherlock’s eyes opened wide, and he looked at his brother, who had obviously kept so much of himself hidden all these years.
Sherlock was upon John in an instant, holding John with nothing but water between them, and kissed him more hungrily and deeply than before. Whimpering, John ground against him.
“You’re perfect, Sherlock. And not just in bed, though I couldn’t have asked for better.” John paused, to appreciate the small giggle from his servant. “Besides, you’re going to be my musician, aren’t you?”
Yet the greatest astonishment I have felt is discovering
LESTRADE
“When John gave me this cross, Lord Montgomery was present, and, before I tell you what happened, I have to assure you that it wasn’t John’s fault.”
Petting Sherlock’s bottom, John thought only of comforting his servant. “Relax, Sherlock.”
Having no other alternatives, he marched to the bed and sat there, his hands rising up to face, curling into tight fists.
This time, Sherlock’s whimper was so intense that it was almost a sob.
It was indeed a case of blackmail, one that I recount elsewhere. As I would see him do countless times in the future, my friend solved the case and saved his client from a terrible scandal. I could hardly believe it; the man I had come to aid, the one who was supposed to be
When William retired to his quarters that night, he asked John to his bed without hesitation. John was thrilled when his master laid him down and removed John’s clothing, then his body became relaxed and excited all at once as William took him in his mouth. John breathed heavily, overwhelmed with sweet feelings.
With an abashed smile, John nodded. He was worn out from crying, too exhausted to act on excitement, and William was very calming and soft. They were over the blanket, but the blanket would not have given John the warmth he wanted anyway. He touched the sash of William’s dressing gown. “Can I undo this, sir?”
“Hmm. I saw that John has a new cloak.” Sherlock did not have to say that he knew it was Mycroft’s work. “It suits him.”
Eagerly, John joined him on the bed, sitting demurely, ready to do as William asked. “What would you like me to do?”
So you both have come together then. As I knew you would. My machinations have succeeded after all, is that not so, Mycroft?
John’s hand stopped. He recalled telling Sherlock about working a second job to provide for his family, and the sympathy that had shined in the nobleman’s eyes. “You did this for me?”
“Hmm.” I grinned. “How about I just call you sweetheart?”
“I saw you in the crowd.”
“Or ever,” King John added, his voice soft with compassion.
“You like that idea?” The king asked, though from his tone, he clearly saw the joy on Sherlock’s features. “I’m sure you’ll find good employment somewhere in my kingdom.”
John expected to feel like a new man when he donned his new clothes. These quality garments would show that he was the attendant of an important master, and would at last allow him to belong in King William’s presence.
My brother would not bother to share correspondence with you if he did not think you were worth his time.
Sherlock said nothing, but finished freeing John’s thick need from the confines of the king’s clothes, and at once, closed his mouth around it. John shook, restraining himself as best he could, but his resolve quickly weakened.
SHERLOCK
A few days later, I noticed that there was a new post on Bertie’s blog. He said that something had happened that promised to bring a joyful turn to his life, or something like that, and that he was exceedingly thankful to a friend, to whom he owes a grand favour.
Sherlock couldn't understand why this grand figure would take an interest in him. “Why look for me, sir?”
It was the servant’s dream to give the king everything he needed, but what hope did he have? He would be content for as long as he could serve King John in at least this way, to be the loyal maid who gave the king adoration and support, to be the trembling and inexpert but willing and eager body with which the majestic ruler satisfied himself.
Silently, John bit his lip. Clearly, he was suffering from some insecurity he could not voice aloud.
“I thought it was interesting, too, especially when I thought about how the two of us could use the things we saw.” John kissed Sherlock on the cheek. It was incredible that he could share this intimacy with this beautiful creature. “You are magical, aren’t you, Sherlock?”
SHERLOCK
If the clothes met with even an ounce of William’s approval, then the servant felt better after all. He decided he would keep the clothes he had received.
A sensuous shudder passed through John, and the servant’s hands weakly struggled in their binding. “M’lord,” he breathed.
I… I did not…
William cried out in passion, and John felt his master surrender himself to thrusting in earnest. It gave the weary servant a blissful sensation of warmth in his abdomen and his heart. By William’s ardent yet tender rhythm, John was being rocked to sleep.
Again, Sherlock whimpered.
John noticed that, fortuitously, Sherlock was eyeing the trees a little distance away. It seemed that he also wished to wander through the woods.
It was impossible to tell what the king was thinking as he took the reins of the horse again and led their convoy away. While words spoken in moments of passion were not always truthful, the king seemed to find Sherlock appealing to some extent, which was very gratifying; though it also seemed that he was disappointed in himself for having any kind of feelings for a common servant. Sherlock would not have blamed him. In any case, the intense but brief incident was behind them, and the king seemed eager to disregard it.
MYCROFT
Jeeves gave a light cough. “Perhaps it would be best,” he said, “were a respite to be taken, and discussion resumed at a later time, after heads have cooled.”
Taking a cloth in hand, Sherlock wiped the wood. It was an honour to clean something belonging to King John, especially an item of this nature. Certainly, this bow had been made by a very skilled craftsman, to be suitable for a king. The object had the privileged role of frequently being held in the king’s capable hands. Truly a useful implement it was, too, as the bow helped the king hunt and protect.
I’m aware of that. He has mentioned it, when remarking on the concerted effort it takes to keep me in check.
It is true that I cannot see the first punch coming, as it were, but it only takes me a moment to get a sufficient hold—
It was difficult for Sherlock to tell what thrilled him more, the way that John hummed and sucked him, relieving Sherlock of tension as only John could, or the words that John whispered when he paused to catch his breath, the way he spoke of the eternity that they would share.
“A fair part of our exchange,” William said simply. When John had finished gently soaping one hand, the nobleman drew his other arm out from the water, wordlessly commanding John to clean it.
This was ridiculous. I knew very well how Bertie felt about Jeeves, so if Jeeves felt the same way, what was the problem?
“Poor Sherlock,” the king muttered, “It is not fair to you, for you to give me so much of yourself, when I can give you so little.”
The king considered waiting a long time before bringing up his plan for the tournament, yet there was an advantage to posing the plan sooner. Public sentiment was on his side for the moment, and they were celebrating him for a tournament, of all things. It might not seem so strange to them that their king, who had found such success in a tournament, would wish to host one of his own, and for stakes that would have the whole kingdom chattering with excitement.
MYCROFT
“You’re gorgeous, Sherlock. Would you like an eternity of this? Of us, doing whatever we like together?”
Ah, well… Well, it’s not something I would discuss at present!
SHERLOCK
You have been in Afghanistan.
With a small smile, William thought of how the young boy had responded.
“Be my guest, but… you won’t do anything with what I’ve told you, right? No posting any comments about the lovesick author?”
Sherlock futilely shook his head. “I… I can’t…”
“Yes, uh, right away.” Afraid of angering the man who was, after all, supporting his family, John quickly scurried past the beds and into the luxurious private bathroom, still in his sleeping gown. He had to see to the needs of his king first. John had never been in a home with piped-in water before, yet he had used public bathhouses like most common folk did, and the mechanisms were basically the same. He turned a small wheel and water poured from a tap into the ruler’s rather large bath. Undoubtedly, the water had already been prepared elsewhere.
Which one’s worse to have as a son? A blind man, or a Negro?
“Have I failed you?”
It was always King John who decided where their convoy stopped to rest. Such stops were inevitable on any journey. Horses needed rest, and though provisions had been brought, it was sometimes necessary for food and water to be hunted or collected. In the evenings, the caravans would gather and establish a campsite, with many people starting fires with which they could cook.
All right, I wasn’t so sure that Sherlock would agree. He’s not always the most sociable guy. However, I was confident I could convince him that it was a good idea. Him and Jeeves, both being brainy, problem-solving types, ought to enjoy getting to know one another. I figured they’d get along right away, like how Bertie and I did when we first met. And just like how Bertie and I bonded over writing our blogs, Jeeves and Sherlock could relate to each other since they both did consulting work, more or less. Plus, the new experience of a double date would make things interesting for Sherlock, who can never stand a dull moment.
“I am sorry that I thought you were an adulterer because there were women’s garments in your laundry,” Sherlock said without preamble. Lestrade had undoubtedly told Mycroft about what happened. “Also, I am sorry that I found out you wear women’s clothing sometimes. It’s fine, though.”
“He would tire of me sooner rather than later. I am content to continue working for Mr. Wooster, and would prefer this to losing him entirely. I hope that you will help him see the error in his conclusions.”
“Sherlock?”
LESTRADE
SHERLOCK
Sherlock swallowed, nervously. “I’m sorry I wasn’t fit to, well, do everything for you, at the end.”
Then there can’t be any harm in teaching me.
“All I’m saying is that you don’t have to.” The king turned his attention to the horse, which idly toed the ground. “How about I tell you more about horses? Maybe it’ll be less scary if you know more about it.”
The king sounded sincere, though he was not looking directly at Sherlock anymore. It seemed that some piece of the king’s confidence had been lost somewhere. Or perhaps he had simply been underwhelmed by what the servant could give him, and did not want to hurt Sherlock’s feelings by saying so.
“I’m not sure how much I want to say to a man I've just met.”
“Have I done something wrong?” Sadly, John touched his treasured wooden keepsake. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t be playing with toys.”
A part of John felt uneasy, relying on help from Father Lestrade, but it was a sincere job offer and not some gift to inevitably be taken away. If there was something John could trust, it was the fruits of his own labour. “I’ll think on it, Father.”
WATSON
Shame bore down on John. He blushed, afraid that he had overstepped his boundaries. “I’m s-sorry, M’lord, I didn’t mean—”
John guided one of Sherlock’s arms to the corner of the bed. “Then I’ll have you in every way, Sherlock.”
“Oh, Sherlock. I meant it.”
These words struck John like a heavy blow. Sherlock was right. The fortress was where John had made that awful mistake. While trying to help Sherlock relax, he’d inadvertently done the same to himself, too much so, and had let those tempting, tortuous words slip from his lips. In the inn near the art festival, John had admitted that he’d meant those words, but it was only natural that Sherlock would doubt that, as they carried a promise that no reputable king could keep to a servant.
John sighed. “What else am I supposed to do?”
Sherlock was close, tempted by John’s kindness to finish inside him, captivated by endless fantasies of the moment they would surrender to each other completely.
“What kind of people would you like to travel with, Sherlock?”
Sherlock slipped his hand under John and stroked him, in time with every thrust.
SHERLOCK
Leaning in closer, perhaps slightly too close, if only for a moment, John whispered, “Know that I’m fighting for you, Sherlock. I want to be your champion.”
“Fine.” Sherlock crossed his arms, giving his walk a stern character. “I know enough about what adult males and females can do.”
Pulling back and moving one of his hands to where his mouth had been, John spoke to Sherlock in a low, rough voice. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“Pleasing you?” William asked, his voice low. He continued to kiss John’s neck, and to stroke him firmly. “Immensely.”
With splendid determination and more hums of interest, Sherlock followed John’s movements, learning to move with his master as more and more self-control slipped away from the king.
Quickly, William’s head turned and he snapped, “No!”
WATSON
The clothes made him feel no more worthy to inhabit a royal castle, and it was assured that they would not impress the ruler of the castle. At least John had seen to King William’s request to have the clothes ordered in the first place. It made him presentable to visiting dignitaries, if nothing else.
Ones that
It would have been plain to anyone that the conversation was getting pretty emotional, but they didn’t ask me to leave, and I felt I had to make sure it all worked out if I could.
He didn’t answer me. I thought that was rude, until I saw the wild look in his eyes. It was like something on the screen had gripped him completely.
Bertie was tapping rapidly away at his mobile, which I didn’t think he was holding a moment ago. “Ah, found it! It looks like I could be either best man or man of honour, or simply honour attendant.” He returned his mobile to his pocket, and crossed his arms thoughtfully. “Interesting how much there is to know about weddings.”
It’s in the brain, I’m told. I was bestowed with an abnormal brain in many respects, it seems.
Feeling lethargic himself, John said softly, “I love you.”
His arm stopped moving, but John still stared at the shelf.
King John was stunning on his horse, as Sherlock expected. The well-cleaned lance in his hand glinted like his armour, and his shield bore the dazzling visage of a proud lion on a red and gold background. Like the rider, his white horse was also armoured, and wore an ornamental cloth with the symbol of the lion.
Well… I do not know where he is, but if you have an appointment with him, he should be here shortly. I smell tobacco smoke; he was probably here recently. I’m sure he stepped out only for an instant.
“Some complexities are interesting, sir.“
Not that I don’t appreciate that, but my heart’s lost to Mycroft, even if he doesn’t want it. Really, you’re a good-looking man, Peterson, but I can’t.
A royal wedding was remarkably boring, Sherlock soon discovered. There was far too much ceremony involved, even if the dramatics were for his sake. His opinion of the day was much improved, however, when Father Lestrade finished reading their vows and Sherlock at last could kiss John as his spouse.
He’s the opposite of Jeeves in that way, I suppose. If you’re not watching Jeeves like a hawk, you might place your teacup empty on the table and find it filled as if by magic. Sherlock, on the other hand, strides into being with all the subtlety of the opening credits for an action film.
John breathed in sharply. It was impossible not to notice how the servant’s body responded to the request. John flipped over, lying on his stomach, his wrists crossing behind his back. His head was resting on the bed, turned to the side. “Like this?”
Are you aware, Watson, that Mycroft is desperately in love with Lestrade?
“I do think about it sometimes, sir, but you don’t need to worry. You don’t need to be concerned for my feelings.”
Ha. If you knew John Watson better, you would know better than to ask. Anyone would desire to keep his company. He is an honest man. Pleasant, endearing—more than a few ladies have described him as such.
A sudden melancholy settled on Sherlock’s features. “We all have our duties.” He stood up from the pew. “It has been a pleasure, but I think I’ve been here too long.”
SHERLOCK
“Is this all right, Sherlock?”
“I would like that very much, John.” Too timid to initiate the kiss, the servant smiled shyly. That was all right with John. In truth, it thrilled him to be Sherlock’s guide in any context, but especially in such intimate matters, of which Sherlock had known so little before he met the king.
“I think you should get rid of this bed,” John said as he worked.
John wished Sherlock wasn’t so clever, since then the gentleman would not know how disadvantaged the peasant sitting next to him was. Trying to hide his humiliation at his unfortunate circumstances, he asked, with unnecessary derision, “Oh, you don’t know which one?”
No, I was not.
“No, sir!” Jeeves’s sharp cry took me by surprise, and Bertie nearly jumped out of his chair. “I do love you, sir.”
Sherlock bravely nodded. “I would, um, I would like to serve you in every way possible, sir. I thought about it while I was in the library, too. I want to give you a child.”
“I see it is not your family’s situation that concerns you anymore.”
John closed his mouth completely over the other man’s need, and William cried out powerfully, his deep voice alive with passion. “John! My John!” He could feel his master’s body tremble, and guided William’s hips so that he could please his lord in a soothing rhythm.
LESTRADE
Sherlock was no less bewildered. “Why are you laughing?” Gravely, he added, “This might mean Mycroft is deceiving you.”
“On second thought, maybe we shouldn’t give him any apologies. It might be better to not let him know we’ve found out, or he might enact swift revenge.”
Surprised, Lestrade’s eyebrows rose. “You don’t stay apprised of news much, do you, John? You never were one for gossip, which speaks well of you, really. Now you should know, though, that the first King Holloway is the one who became too unwell to rule. He no longer walks this earth. It was only about a year ago that he passed on. To be entirely honest, it is by God’s grace alone that he survived as long as he did. He abdicated to his first son, Montgomery Holloway, when the boy was twenty-two.”
“You won’t have a problem sleeping here, then? We’ll be stopping in inns when possible, but there won’t always be towns on the road, so you’ll often have to sleep on the sofa. Will that be a problem?”
I shouldn’t have said that. I apologise.
“Yeah?”
MYCROFT
Soulless eyes?
William should have had Lestrade cast out of his keep for this insolence, and yet the king was the one who was struggling now. “That’s… My advisors do those things. Montgomery was deemed below the affairs of the kingdom long ago.”
At that moment, the king made one final groan, finding his release, against Sherlock, amazing the servant with what a handsome image he made.
Lestrade, I have one last thing to tell you. Mycroft returns your feelings.
Three. That’s half of the box, see? Let’s do it again. You count, this time.
“Sir, I have been cowardly. I am sorry.”
“I’ve never been in a forest like that. Is that safe?”
SHERLOCK
There were no guards dedicated to this spot. In fact, there was little to see but a solitary set of doors. John knocked politely, yet firmly. “Father Lestrade?”
Then you’ll… make me forget all about innocent waltzes, won’t you?
Respectfully, Sherlock rested his head on his master’s knee. He didn’t demand an answer from his master. It was as if he would accept any decision the king made. John wouldn’t be surprised if that were the case.
How could John forget when he had first seen the cute servant who would come to be his cherished maid? The question was so absurd that John chuckled.
WATSON
William closed his eyes. “My love, yes,” he whispered, imploringly.
You have been silent for half an hour. It is not like you. Come now, won’t you sit on the bench with me?
“It is astonishing,” Mycroft said in agreement, drinking his ale.
Sherlock’s tongue slipped cutely between his lips, and at last, he tasted John, little by little. His eyes fluttered in rapture as he got to know this new sensation.
WATSON
That was what he told himself, at any rate, as he tried hard not to think about the fact that soon, he would be sleeping in the same enclosed space as a certain handsome king.
Sherlock wanted John to know how much this meant to him. “Do you believe me?”
Mycroft, the lock on your door requires an upgrade, or a replacement at the very least.
SHERLOCK
I thought you enjoyed these walks, Watson.
“Tell me how you felt.” William did away with John’s underwear, and lightly kissed the male member that was freed, watching the little jump of need and appreciating the pleased shudders John made. “What made you sad? What made you happy?”
“Just walk with me. It won’t kill you.”
That was only on one… That was only on two occasions.
With the same wonderment that filled him as he pressed cider, Sherlock would cry out as John parted his servant’s legs wider and entered him more deeply with each plunge. Sherlock would feel the king using him; would he feel the king siring a child with him, if that were possible? John would take Sherlock until the king was assured of a whole litter of heirs, until John had filled Sherlock with every drop of his seed, and he had heard Sherlock scream with the thrill of his own release. Keeping Sherlock close, giving him joy—that was what John truly desired.
“I um, I should be asking you that,” John managed to state. He badly wanted to kiss William, though he knew that could never be allowed.
“Interesting,” Sherlock uttered, something ahead catching his attention.
, Mycroft had said once,
“Well, yes, but don’t you already do all that?”
Lestrade grew sombre. “A worthy goal, but easier said than done.” He clapped John on the shoulder in a friendly sign of camaraderie, and spoke to some of the other worshippers before exiting the chapel. He probably went somewhere to wait on Prince Montgomery. It was plain to see that Father Lestrade and the former King Holloway were very close.
“I suppose I will have to move closer to you,” William said. He closed the shutters over the small windows. Gracefully, he moved to sit on John’s lap, and slowly brought his arms around his attendant. “I’m sorry, John.”
“You did that so well,” John remarked, full of sincerity. His servant had become very courageous.
“Poor chap,” I heard Bertie saying one day. “Still trying to get over your crush for your pal? I can only be grateful that I’m not suffering the same ailment of the heart over my worthy PA. How awful that would be, since I see him so often. But how understandable too. He’s so charming, you know, and dashed intelligent. I really would be lost without him.”
“It was interesting, sir,” Sherlock said. “You said there was more you wanted to show me?”
“Think about it, Sherlock. If you’re still interested when the tournament is over, let me know, and I’ll find a spot for you in the convoy.”
“He’s willing to take care of all your family’s debts. Your folks would be taken care of, and your sister wouldn’t have to worry about marriage.”
“I have more.” It was incredible to hear John breathe faster when Sherlock retrieved several belts, made of the finest leather. “Should we make use of these, John?”
When the king did give a final grunt and spilled himself, he also reached around Sherlock, to help his servant finish. Sherlock was quite simply undone. It was a rapturous moment, as rapturous as all of it had been. The occasion was made all the more precious to Sherlock because he could not expect to be allowed such intimacy with the king very many times, not with a man who was superior to him in every way, for whom he could not perform any duty as well as the king deserved.
Two chaps don’t just waltz together.
“Good,” was all that King John uttered.
William chuckled. It was a deep sound, with more rue than mirth. “Last night paled in comparison to what this morning gave to me.” He looked meaningfully at John. “You cannot possibly know how spectacular you are. This country can offer me nothing more beautiful.”
The trunk was one of two pieces in the room that was John’s property—soon to be the only one, pending the removal of the smaller bed. Previously it only held some simple clothing and a small wooden horse. Now it would hold objects that they had shared in the most private of circumstances. To see John easily take claim of his gifts pleased Sherlock.
“Hmm. Well, good find, Sherlock.”
Mycroft folded his hands together and studied their table. They had each ruled over this country at some time or another, Sherlock considered, one through a war and the other its aftermath, yet neither of them knew how to move past their competition.
“I can’t… Sherlock…”
WATSON
I never had to. How you have spent your time is perfectly obvious. Pining for a white man, what hope does a black fellow have? None whatsoever. Particularly when the first is full of life and spirit, and the other finds himself rather dull and uninviting. His affection could never be returned. It would be absolutely hopeless. So he has had no other recourse but to sadly lock himself away in his rooms, in lonely solitude, and—
He heard John chuckle—his kind John. “I think I’ll manage.”
The question might have been seen as impertinent, and Sherlock hadn’t always been forthcoming with answers in any case. Fortunately, His Highness allowed the question, though he answered it curtly. “Yes.”
“I did like making music for you,” Sherlock said, coyly.
MYCROFT
Jeeves narrowed his eyes. “I am afraid that I do not gather your meaning.”
“If your partner doesn’t know what he’s doing. But, if he does… Well, God left a little surprise there.”
LESTRADE
Sherlock was staring at John in fascination and wonder. It was an expression that John never tired of seeing on his servant’s face. “Do you mean that?”
Sherlock walked down the rows of trees with John again. With boundless energy, Sherlock hopped from one tree to the next, picking apples and placing them in his basket.
“And the rest of the tournament, too? I know you were employed by the tournament, but I hope you enjoyed what you saw?”
John was incredible, his head tipped back and his mouth open in a cry of pleasure. He writhed under William when the servant’s hardening length rubbed against the king’s stomach. “I wish I could… Oh, sir… I want to bear your child…”
So they had, for all practical purposes, separated; the queen went away to live elsewhere, to do as she liked with whomever she chose, and the king had resigned himself to the dreary, lonely life he seemed destined for.
LESTRADE
William watched Lestrade’s hands tighten with a tense apprehension, and knew that whatever subject bothered the priest was a very serious one. Certainly the king could spare a little of his time for Lestrade.
LESTRADE
Opening his eyes, the king regarded Sherlock, and placed a hand under the servant’s chin.
SHERLOCK
Pardon?
“You are so beautiful,” King John told him, “oh, and your voice, Sherlock, your voice is like an angel’s.”
“Do not try to hide it. You have been talking to my employer regarding his… feelings. Though he has told me nothing, his manner has changed so abruptly and in so telling a fashion that I was able to observe what has happened. Whatever it is you two have discussed, you led to him to a false conclusion. Mr. Wooster is a young man who does not yet know what he wants. He is vibrant, one might even say effervescent, and as you can clearly see, I am not.”
Capital statement! I should have that engraved on the door.
Yes, as I understand it.
Once he had investigated enough, William stood. One final test was necessary. He wrapped his arms around John, and kissed his dear servant. John moaned, loudly at first from surprise, then with a longing for more, and William was happy to kiss him deeply, devotedly.
You think so?
John’s breath was very shaky, in that moment. “You don’t have to.”
Oh. You’re right.
Pleased, John curled his hand around Sherlock’s. “There’s always places for a king to travel to,” he said. “I’m sure there will be other adventures for us.”
I stared at him. I couldn’t believe what he saying.
It took some time before Sherlock could see the king, who was busy being congratulated by nobles and knights. It was not the place of a servant to demand an audience with the king when there were such prestigious people speaking to him already, of course. As the day continued, however, Sherlock found himself impatient to talk to King John. When Sherlock at last worked up the courage to approach His Majesty, the king saw him at once, dismissing the princesses he had been speaking with a moment before.
“But then, I already knew all about you,” the man who looked like Sherlock murmured in the eccentric nobleman’s gentle voice.
MYCROFT (O.S.)
One of the soldiers he had fought alongside now directed a fortress that served as a potential defensive position. The fortress was composed of a castle surrounded by giant walls and towers. Weapons as well as relics from wars in times past were kept in the castle, which had survived through many historic conflicts. There was peace for the moment, so the fortress served mainly as a spot of interest for various visitors. Members of King John’s convoy now counted themselves among that number.
Once John was wearing only his briefs, Sherlock guided him to his large bed. It was distracting to see that John’s underwear had a noticeable bulge, though John was effecting to ignore it. “My dear John, please lie down for me.”
