“Isn’t it clear to you?” Sherlock said walking forward. He opened the shower door all the way and stepped inside.
"John," Sherlock's eyes darted away from him momentarily and then back again. "There have already been rather cruel things said. Things I'm glad you were shielded from. I'd like to keep it that way."
"Why?" Hanah asked. "I think you're under the impression that love and affection are something solid, something with weight and mass. We're taught in school that two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. But that's not how love works. That's not how the heart works. You were in love with Mary?"
"No, no of course not." He sighed. He made a decision. After all, what was the worst that could happen? It's not like he couldn't check himself out. "I hate to ask you this but, I think I left some clothes there in my old room. Would you mind packing a bag for me. I'm...I think I'm off to get some help."
Soon it was time to return his device and dejectedly he made his way back to the front office and dully handed the mobile over.
"There I was." John said and they shared a kiss. "I guess I'm pretty lucky I happened to be out and about that day."
She stopped, sensing the tension in the room, the tears and perhaps something else she couldn't put her finger on even though they'd broken apart before her arrival.
There was a method to John's pedantics. His friend had gotten away for far too long using euphemism and innuendo. It kept him at a lofty and a safe distance from the wonderful, visceral nature of sex.
No, I asked you because you told me when we were in bed that it kept the darkness away. You also said you'd visited Ella for nightmares. I didn't ask about it and I should have.
He'd kept his drinking slow and steady this evening. The pills then the final push of booze but only
"Michael Caine is in his 80's, you daft man." John laughed and he was sure he heard Sherlock snicker as well.
"The light returned when he met you. The mischievousness and some of the joy returned. When you left those lights were doused again. Now they've come back with your reappearance. What is indisputable is that you now tend those fires, John. It is your job to keep them lit."
"So, onto business," John said. "Am I to assume you're here to express your displeasure at me seeing Sherlock? I realize it's likely a surprise but...well if you're expecting an apology for that, I've none to give."
"I've been walking around the city, talking to "Mary", getting high...trying to think of what I was going to tell you."
"It's alright, John. It takes time." He kissed me and I responded in kind. I have to say, I didn't really believe him.
Mycroft sat back in his seat and waited and John had to hold back a chuckle. He and Sherlock thought they were so different and in many ways this was true. But still there were mannerisms, tells they each had that mirrored the other. For instance when Sherlock was bracing for bad new or some sort of verbal dressing down he adjusted his jaw ever so slightly. This was inevitably followed by a tiny pursing of the lips. You never noticed it unless you knew him, unless you knew
John was shocked. He knew they were friends, the best of friends. He even knew they loved each other but it just wasn't something Sherlock said. And that was ok. Except now that's he'd heard it, he couldn't ever imagine not hearing it again.
"I've given men prostate exams before I assume it's relatively similar. I mean, I have books at home but if there's more information you can add."
"When I saw the kids running to their mums and dads on Family Weekend. It was jarring to remember I had a child too. And then shameful to recall how I'd abandoned her. I think I just want to start with a visit or two. I think...I think ultimately this has to be left up to Rosie. I don't even know what she calls Harry and Clara. I mean, if they're Mum and Mum then I can't blunder in like "Oi, I'm your Dad, come with me." Fuck that. If I have to remain on the edges then that's something I need to accept."
"No, you're not simply asking, or rather you have been asking for over a week. I am happy to stay at your parent's house. Do you not want to stay there?"
P designated that it was a Promises meeting meaning it focused on the 12 Promises of AA. Meetings at The Location had covered every variation and combination and there were certainly some he preferred more than others. Promises wasn't a favorite but it would do for today.
John squinted and then shut his eyes tightly after a moment. A peculiar sound had arisen and he couldn't place where it was coming from. He stuck a finger in his ear, moving it around a bit. There was a vague distant noise of ringing, like someone blowing a whistle a few houses down. Like a train or something...maybe.
90 days. Jesus. Three fucking months in this place. he was already starting to feel antsy and despondent."
"This wasn't to depress you but to prepare you but it does bring me to my next point. Like addiction, depression is not just something you shake off. Being here is how we address and parse it but we don't fix it. Depression can be managed, it can be overcome but it can't be cured, per se. You will always have depressive tendencies. Now let me explain why it's a good thing that you know that. If you left here, thinking you were cured you would be incredibly upset and confused the next time feelings laid you low. You might feel increasingly negative, disappointed with yourself, doubtful of the progress you made in here and perhaps even hostile toward seeking help again. I want to arm you with the knowledge that this can and will happen and that that is not defeat. Now, when you both came in this morning you were happy-"
This was nothing like that. It was modern, spacious, with a sturdy elegance being the only thing to belied its age.
He hummed absentmindedly in reply, his eyes scanning over the pages with no real plan of what he was looking for.
"She had plans to file a civil suit against my parents accusing them of wrongful death. Mycroft wanted to carpet bomb the entire situation, as usual. Dig up her past, exploit some weakness, engage in vague yet pointed threats until she backed off. I told him no, I would talk to her and keep talking to her and I did. Nearly every other week I drove past the empty, overgrown lot where Musgrave used to be to her home and we talked and we talked and we talked. Finally, after a great many tears I was able to convince her that it would be better to put that time and energy into something that celebrated his life as opposed to avenging his death."
"John, she is an absolute dream." Janine said giving his daughter several rapid-fire kisses on the cheek. Rosie squealed with delight in a way that she never did with him. Janine then handed her over. "Every time she's here I have half a mind to run away with her."
"I want you to sit with some of these thoughts, John. It looks like you have a lot of questions but you're not exactly sure how to ask them. It'll come, alright? Give it some time. I'll be here for you tomorrow. But, in case you ever need me sooner..." She reached into her drawer and gave him a card. "This is my direct number. You can call day or night. And you're right on schedule, this is about the time during treatment where patients ask how they can reach me if they need to. We're starting to dig deep into some stuff that's been long undisturbed. It might bring up unsettling memories and thoughts. That's what I'm here for."
"Look at you! Look at your life!" I shouted less than an inch away from him. "Is this who you are now?"
"Precisely. So, stuff happened and I ended up gone for about seven days. Mycroft couldn't find me though he had all his feelers on the lookout. The problem with Mycroft, which was a great benefit to me then, was that he hates, as he puts it, the legwork. He would never bother to get contacts like my homeless network. I'm not bragging just stating a fact. It wouldn't occur to him and if it did, he wouldn't begin to know how. Had he been able to manage that, he would have found me in hours. But as it was, he stumbled into what was once a house in South London, where I and about eleven other people were getting high and coming down. Peeling walls, leaking loo, unidentifiable stains on the ceiling, splashes of blood from over-exuberant vein jabs on the wall. Feces, urine, fetid mattresses and a collection of sad, lonely people. And me among them, well, me one of them. I was overdosing, the problem was he didn't know on what. By that time my dalliances had extended beyond heroin. I'm told I had dried blood on my nose and mouth, a needle in my arm and foil papers at my side that indicated I may have recently been smoking methamphetamines. What to do? Perhaps if he'd had some distance from the subject he might have been able to logic it out, narrow it down. But what he revealed to me later was that he made a guess. Luckily for me, he guessed correctly. I was overdosing on heroin and he had taken to carrying naloxone with him. He saved my life. I was of course petulant and quite put out by the entire affair. On the surface at least. I felt bad enough to promise him that I would always leave a note."
"Sex doesn't alarm me, John." He said indignantly, defensively. John heard the shifting of sheets as his partner sat up to stare down at him.
"About two inches tall, honestly. I didn't handle it well. But things got better and we...we connected, we talked. In the end, it was good."
But when they allowed one another across those boundaries, it was intense and romantic and everything he wanted for the both of them. When the alarm had sounded bringing an end to their session John had pulled Sherlock up and directly atop his chest. His boyfriend was still painfully hard and after coating his hand with lube he'd wrapped it around his cock.
history, a fairly recent Section on his records, a stint in rehab and losing his job only hours ago because of a failed drug test that would most certainly be it. He'd lose his license. He would no longer be a doctor. And whether he was absolutely in love with practicing medicine or not he realized, in that moment, being a doctor did mean something to him. It actually meant quite a lot.
He crumpled in his seat, leaning forward and resting his face in his hands as he sobbed. So much crying it was a wonder he had tears left.
"Well, obviously the orgasm is new, touching you is new. But I've felt this way ever since you first moved in. I always have. I hope I do the same for you." Sherlock said quietly. "This was the nicest evening I have ever had. Not just the touching and orgasm. This. This right here and now. Like what we had at The Location. Your body against my body. In one another’s arms. Simple. Complete. This."
"Now, you were just sent out on assignment here. You've got no idea who I am really. What I'm capable of. What I've done. Would you like to find out? I can make sure, right now, that you wind up on the front page like you've always wanted. Though maybe not how you ever imagined."
"I didn't realize I had to give you the whole 'I can't help you if you don't tell me everything' lawyer-speech, John."
"They've already met you and received you well. They like you and they trust my decision-making. If I have decided that you're a suitable partner, and I have, then they will respect my decision."
Once there he propped up on his elbow and gazed at John who only gazed back, an easy smile on his face which he hoped didn't betray his excitement.
There was a general shuffle about me from his colleagues. Like a choir practicing, they seemed to groan nearly in unison about me. They were irritated at the disruption I was causing and that only made me more incensed.
I think I would have balked at that at The Location. They helped me there, Hanah helped but I was still so far up my own arse I wouldn't let it stick the way it should.
In a way, he had been glad everything with Eurus had happened. He needed a distraction and she was a mighty one.
"Yeah, it's true I just don't know why I said it. Anyway, Sherlock and I made a go of it. Well, we tried. Or rather
Sherlock kept talking but John's mind was briefly short-circuiting. He hadn't expected this. Not in a million years. It wasn't that he thought Sherlock was commitment phobic, but rather that he didn't place much value in institutions. After all, they had both agreed to essentially living out their lives together. Surely that's what retiring to Sussex meant. But, though he was helpful and supportive while he and Mary were prepping for the wedding, he didn't seem to give much credence to the actual ceremony.
"Sorry, Sherlock, you told me repeatedly you don't believe in God or an afterlife or any such nonsense. Mary's wants are irrelevant because Mary no longer exists. Mary has long since putrefied. Do you know what happens to the body after death?"
To the point, the interesting thing about mobiles is that even once you delete a message it's never really gone. Through fairly basic steps you can retrieve them. *All* of them.
"John, I likely would have discovered it myself. He just made it more convenient. He wanted to try and it and he was too frightened to do it alone. And he didn't trust his other mates not to just hoist him into a skip if things went wrong. So he came up to my room, we frotted and came and then he took out the stuff, a spoon, a lighter and a needle. Since I was a child I'd been injecting myself with compounds, testing out different theories here and there. So a needle didn't scare me, but it terrified him. Sebastian had me go first
The line went dead and his Skype started to ring. He answered trepidatiously. And there he was on his screen, his forehead pinched, his mouth tight, the light from his bedside lamp casting him in a soft, warm glow.
"I think...had I not met Mike and subsequently Sherlock when I did..." He'd stopped and restarted. "I had decided that that was enough time for things to either get better or not. Enough therapy, enough civilian life-"
"Yes, I do." She took a deep breath before continuing. "Your breakdown was quite public. People know and the ugly fact is they may stare or bring it up or even try and use it against you. The ugly truth is that not everyone is anonymous. People are people and every manner of person can fall into an addiction and into AA and that includes unrepentant gossips. You may run into them, they may be there. It's ugly and unfortunate but it's true. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do except get a thicker skin, protect yourself as best you can and find a place you trust. I know that must feel like a great deal to ask right now, you're vulnerable and The Location wound up being a sanctuary. But in the real world there are going to be some consequences you'll need to face."
John ended the call and lay there for a moment unable to stop the smile that was spreading across his face. He was exhausted and wired. He wanted to rest and also jump on the treadmill and tick off a few miles.
"You do like that don't you?" He asked before taking a playful bite at the ball of Sherlock's shoulder.
"Yes, well...my mother has a dizzying intellect. Her one and only book "The Dynamics of Combustion" which she wrote in her 20's was derided as absolute nonsense when it was released. Since then it has become one of the foremost sources for mathematical physics and theoretical mathematics. There is not a week that goes by where she is not contacted by some asking if she would be interested in being a visiting professor, a speaker, writing another book, proofreading a thesis, assisting on a project. "
John turned his head swiftly to his partner who didn't look at all surprised by the exclamation. He did, however, look a bit embarrassed.
"We've been eating takeaway. A lot of takeaway, actually. Mrs. Hudson, that's our friend and landlady she'll often pick things up for us without asking. I also placed an online order with Sainsbury's not too long ago."
I sat down to write this and I realized I don't know what to say about our recent past or our present or even our future. So, maybe I'll go back to our very distant past. I just wanted to say I keep thinking back to this one memory. This time when we were both pretty small. We were supposed to go to the carnival in town but it was raining something terrible so we were forced to stay home. I didn't even know what a carnival was but from the other kids at school it sounded incredible and I was heartbroken we were going to miss it.
He'd never been fired before. He'd seen it happen to other people and thought; "Oh, look at that poor sod. Having to do that terrible walk of shame. Down the hallway, all his little embarrassing office belongings shoved into a box that was used to ship in bulk toilet tissue. Stained coffee mug, half dead plant and unused ruler, balancing precariously in that cardboard container with
He'd decided to wait until after Sherlock and Rosie's birthdays, the former on the 6th and the latter on the 8th.** He normally didn't want to bother with celebrating it but once it was explained to Rosie that the dates were so close she wanted a joint party. Willing to do anything for his Honey Bee, Sherlock of course agreed. The picture of both of them in matching party hats was something John planned on getting framed as soon as time allowed. After the 8th, a case found them handcuffed and otherwise bound, though not in a fun way for several hours which lead to a chase that lasted a full week.
This was ridiculous. Crying when he was sad. Crying when he was happy. Crying when he was caught somewhere in-between. When didn't he cry? He hated it, hated what his life had done to him. Hated what the alcohol had done to him. Hated what he'd done to himself. Amid all the hate was the fact that he
"Alright, I'm going to email some guidelines in a moment, but simply put, this is an exercise about mindful touch. One person agrees to be the giver, the other the receiver. As the receiver, your only job is to focus on the sensations the active partner is giving you. You'll then switch places and roles. It's important to know at this stage you're avoiding touching genitals. Stage two is much the same except genitals are no longer off limits. Stage three is mutual touching. But the thing to remember is that orgasm is not the goal here and neither is intercourse. This isn't foreplay. The goal is to reacquaint yourself with your own body and your partners. The goal is the experience. This is to anchor yourselves to each other. Understand?"
"Ohhhhh..." He groaned out before he could stop himself. Sherlocks fingers only fluttered in hesitation for a moment before resuming their efforts.
"I couldn't remain at Baker Street. I couldn't focus or concentrate. You became...indispensable to me somewhere along the way. I already knew that to be the case in my personal life. But I didn't realize it extended to my professional life as well. I cannot seem to do this without you." He said sadly.
For better access, he moved off to the side of the detective's body and brought his hand down just below Sherlock's balls. He'd played with this area briefly with his tongue moments before and now he wanted to give it more focused attention. On the other side of the perineum was the prostate and a good amount attention here would likely go along way. Sherlock sighed and settled more into the bed and John smiled at the sounds and the resulting twitch of his partners cock. After spending a handful of minutes just massaging and listening to his lover's satisfied little noises he removed his hand and began to drizzle the lube on his pointer and middle finger.
They were both stubbly and their faces rubbed against one another with the most pleasant sounding friction. Morning light was creeping in, spilling across the blankets where they lay warm underneath.
"You may text and write and I'll be happy to respond to both," Sherlock said with a smile. "Do you want to deal with the house on your return?"
The gasps had now been replaced by the sound of mobiles snapping pictures and it only increased as Sherlock drew him in for a kiss. John smiled against his lips, kissing him back happily, deeply.
He texted Sherlock as promised after lunch ended but plans had changed as they always did and he no longer needed to meet him at the station. In fact, his partner assured him that they'd soon have the culprit in custody due to a remarkable turn of events that he was eager to tell him about once it was all over.
"I want it. I want to go to Tesco, sit myself down in the middle of an aisle and dive into a bottle, any bottle. I want to taste it again, I want it on my tongue, I want..." He stopped feeling disturbed at what he was saying. "Jesus, I sound so...pathetic."
A quick shampoo, shower and brushing of his teeth and he was back in bed. Sherlock immediately pressed his body against him like a koala. He was no doubt flush with oxytocin, the wonderful post-orgasm bonding hormone that made you want to latch onto the person you loved and never let go. He felt it too and held Sherlock in return just as fiercely.
"Well, in most cases I will happily accept that response. But I do need to know what you mean by "the situation". Are you...rethinking
"Yes, yes, and glad to be doing it. I relaunched my page and I've been keeping track of every case we've had so far. Sherlock says I'm just as sacchrine and prone to exaggeration as ever so I know I'm on the right track."
as in plural. They debated the outcome, the theories, the possibilities, they bickered happily and needled one another just like in the old days. He'd been worried about that. Would this change anything, would either of them feel the need to hold back? So far, it didn't seem so.
After a while John began to feel either he was growing accustomed to the pain or it was lessening. The area, the ever expanding area Sherlock was covering had grown warm and not unpleasantly so.
"It's always about sex with you, John. Anytime anything comes up you think it can be handled by an orgasm."
Despite his words of reassurance, which truly did mean everything, he suddenly looked enormous in front of me, enormous fingers, enormous cock and I clenched up tighter than a drum.
"Um..I...well, since I started drinking regularly, I suppose a few hours. I mean, prior to this year, alcohol was never a problem for me. I'm sure that everyone who comes in here probably says some variation of that."
"Mmm." Sherlock said noncommittally. "My father is a quantum chemist with an interest in organic chemistry as well. He taught for many years at Cambridge, eventually retired after declining a departmental chair. Now he likes to do his little "scribblings" as he calls them. Of course, those scribblings are submitting papers to academic journals and working on of the three books he's writing. All this when he isn't misplacing his glasses."
"But that makes it seem like you're the predator and you're not." Sherlock went on. "I don't fear you, John. I fear what you do to me."
"Cheers to that. Look I don't know if this is done but we should keep in touch, yeah? I'll give you contact stuff."
He'd let a man bring him to orgasm, an absurdly satisfying orgasm. But not just a man. His best mate. But yes...a man. He wasn't gay. He wasn't turned on by men, he didn't think about them sexually, he didn't masturbate to them and he didn't want to have sex with them.
Clara had to work so it was just the four of them sitting down for a meal where John had no idea what to expect.
Of course, if he thought too much about that he got nervous too. It had after all been over 2 years, nearly 2 1/2 since he'd had sex.
John thought back to their first night together at The Location. Those gentle kisses. Touching. Being touched. Not worrying about it leading anywhere. He wondered how they'd gotten so lost. He'd love to find a way to get that back.
"Well...it's just that..." He faltered which was unusual for Sherlock. John stepped out of the kitchen to get a better look at him.
"I just didn't." He continued. "I tried. Not very hard, I admit. But I tried to get back some of those feelings I had when she was born, when Mary was alive but, it was like they were gone. And I knew that even if I had been well, that wasn't any way for her to grow up. I felt like a fucking monster. I
John had been sitting there frozen. He hadn't know Sherlock would choose this moment. He hadn't known he had believed this was the last time he'd been forthcoming. He also didn't know what was worse, the fact that Sherlock was going to reveal what happened after that or he fact that he was going to tell it wrong.
said I was a virgin, which is true. But that doesn't mean I haven't had practice for practice sake."
It was glorious and Sherlock in bed was sometimes his most Sherlock. Pouty, entitled, demanding, sweet, lovely and loving and complete with expected expectations.
If his hands hadn't been so busy, one with fingers inside his boyfriend and the other making gentle scratch marks on his scalp. And if his mind hadn't been so occupied drinking in every moment of Sherlock's pleasure he might have been able to give some attention to his own cock, rock hard and just this side of painful. But there'd be time for that later.
"What?" he asked absentmindedly. He'd just heard Sherlock says "Yes, it's a very pretty dress which is why- Clara? Nappy, please?"
They continued on for hours under the safety of the blankets and the dim lamplight. Because they'd gone to bed so early it was only near midnight when they'd finished, voices raw and tired.
"No." Sherlock said shortly before passing him, entering the bathroom. He shut the door leaving it open a crack as he changed. "I've been working for the past two months, first in Austria, the Hungary, then Croatia." He continued.
know how to interact with people. How to communicate. How to touch them or be touched. And my God is he starved to be touched." John said softly before continuing. "He never had a real steady boyfriend, he never had someone who loved him in that way. He's never had sex before. This is all newer than new for him."
"You know, Greg might have a point. If we're going to be doing that we might want to start closing the door. You know, having clients knock. No need to scandalize." John said.
John had given his fair share of massages in the day, though admittedly, most of them had been in an effort to talk a woman into sex, or at least make her more receptive to the idea. Still though, he knew how to do it, knew the points of pressure and release. He hadn't known about the sacrum trick that Sherlock was an expert at pulling, but in the interim, and certainly before offering his services tonight he'd done reasearch. A lot of research.
They kissed and kissed and kissed, hungrily, sweetly, with groans and whispers and pleas and all the while John's erection held steady. He brought both hands down to Sherlock's arse, squeezing and kneading the cheeks enough to make his boyfriend squirm atop him.
He felt goosebumps rise on his skin, something about the heat from Sherlock's hand and the coolness of the room, he imagined.
"No. I tell a lie, it wasn't that. She never minded that if you can believe it. She said I was too much. She said; James, this is all too much."
"For better access." He said and then before his face could turn fully crimson he turned away and lay on his side.
"Sherlock, we absolutely don't have to do this. If you're going out of a feeling of obligation, I mean...well...please don't."
good. Want to taste?" John dipped his finger in again and held it out, sticky and inviting toward Sherlock.
John closed his eyes for a moment, trying to digest what exactly had happened. What was happening. He was willing to hear him out and half hoped and assumed Sherlock might knock on his door, if not chagrined then at least willing to talk and explain. But he didn't knock. He didn't seem as though he were coming at all. The trip had left him uncomfortable, stiff and sweaty. Sighing heavily he again got to his feet and with a change of clothes in hand headed to the shower.
As always, Ao3 has been doubling and tripling some sentences and paragraphs so I apologize if anything came out wonky. Not to mention it loves to just freeze when I'm in the middle of editing. Remember that old tv show "The Weakest Link"? Remember how there were like 10 contestants and they all had to answer trivia questions one right after another and choose when to bank the accumulated money because if they didn't say "Bank!" and got the question wrong, everything they and the other contestants had won up until then would be lost. It's like that on here when I edit. After every paragraph or two, sometimes after every sentence I "Bank!" by hitting "Save without posting" because I've lost too much work already with the page freezing. Just a word to the wise if any of you are having that problem as well. Always save!
Eventually, despite both Sherlock and John's protests Mrs. Hudson efficiently took to clean up and not long after the place was back as it had been.
He kissed his neck, just below his hairline, little curls tickling the tip of his nose as he did so.
"My lumpy skull." He joked. "No, I know what you mean. Um, what was behind it was the fact that I wanted a change. That I didn't like what I was seeing in the mirror and I thought taking a stab at making my reflection look different was worth a shot. It's only hair, I mean, it'll grow back."
"I would, but I promised Hanah I'd have at least one meal a day in the public area. It's part of my therapy."
"Oh, come from Molly's have you?" John asked as he headed to the kitchen to make their friend a cuppa.
It was everything I could and didn't dare hope for. I kissed him back, again and again and again. I no longer felt the urge or need to leave.
Your reviews have all been so lovely and detailed and wonderful. I am truly overwhelmed to be fortunate enough to wake up nearly every day to such kind words. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
"I shout, I seethe, I clench my fists. I..." He struggled as he tried to get a clear handle on what exactly he
The doctor before him started to speak in that comforting tone reserved to keep family members calm while telling them absolutely nothing.
"You still look a fright, John." She said with concern. "I can look after her if you're still on the mend."
"I'm concerned if you're approaching this as Cinderella situation, looking for the perfect fit that it's going to cause serious problems down the road. There is no glass slipper, making the odds of you finding a flawless fit pretty slim. But there are shoe horns. Now, I'm not asking you to stay anywhere you feel is truly unhelpful or unsafe or not conducive to your sobriety. But I do need you to be realistic and 90 differently located meetings in 90 days isn't why you're doing this."
When he arrived back a third time Sherlock was awake, dressed, looking refreshed and nibbling on a waffle.
This time it was Sherlock who bridged the distance between them. He gently lifted John to his feet and the latter stood there limply.
He didn't know if it made him unique or not; the fact that he was a ghost that had its own ghost. But there it was.
Placing a hand on each cheek he pulled them slowly apart. The pale skin of his arse was smooth, supple but here between the cheeks there was just the hint of ginger pubic hair. Most delightful were the few nearly blonde hairs around his arsehole which was precisely where John decided to lick.
Their lips were smashed together in a kiss as he started to come, a groan bridging into a whimper as the feeling pulled him under. His rhythmic clenching around Sherlock's cock eventually dragged the other man along with him, his repetition of John's name mostly muffled and swallowed by their mouths.
I see I got recced on a Johnlock FB group that I secretly lurk in. Thank you for that, Brenna! It was quite an exciting surprise to see #CaptureTheLoveliness in real life. I admit as I was scrolling I did a double take when I saw it. From the comments, I see that people seem to think I might be a therapist which is quite high praise. No, I'm afraid I don't do anything nearly that interesting. I always just thought that John's session with Ella was a fascinating way to start off the BBC series. I liked to hear that he returned for "top-up's" and I liked that Sherlock went to see her in Series 4. But I always thought the inconsistency on John's part was part of his problem. I believe he's got a lot of problems. A
John's mouth felt dry and he started to speak but his boyfriend continued robotically...except for the slightest of slight catches in his voice.
The more he knew a lovers body the more he could tell when they were just about to come. He'd always ask them first. It seemed a little cruel to do it without permission. It was just that Sherlock had beat him to it.
"I told him that...that I worried we shared some similar qualities. That disgusts me. It truly disgusts me."
He knocked on the door to Hanah's office and waited to be invited in. As he entered he noticed Hanah's eyes were on him while Sherlock's most definitely were not.
"He looked shocked. He mouth opened and closed like a carp before he finally offered a polite, Thank you. I took him to the Criterion Bar and we had the oddest chat. He read me from head to toe and I found it to be the most disconcerting, impudent, hilarious thing that I burst out laughing. Told him he had me dead to rights and that it must take a great deal of skill to discover all that by the fraying of the right pocket on my trousers. Again he didn't seem to know what to do, he seemed rather lost. I got the impression that his skill didn't go over so well with most people. But I liked him and I told him so. He mostly just looked confused. He told me about his consulting work, where he lived, how he lived and I found it all fascinating. But I was in the mood to make friends and he looked like he needed a friend. I proposed we meet the following week for lunch and he agreed before he could think better of it. We've been mates ever since."
The answer came from him so easily and was so compelling John to agree to join him. They parted only briefly to retrieve their coats. James also wanted to grab a pack of cigarettes and they stepped outside. It was a cold night, but every night here was cold. Sometimes it looked soft, (and John could only say "looked" because he hadn't been outdoors since his arrival) because snow was falling and everything was still. Sometimes it looked harsh because a light snow had turned into a blizzard strong enough to make the electricity above him momentarily dim.
I approached each day, before we met, with a sort of leaden dread. Wishing it to all be done with. Wishing I had died in the war. Wishing I still had a purpose. You gave that to me; a purpose. A reason for still being here. I didn't have very many friends before you. If I did I wouldn't have been so hard up to find a flatshare.
Hanah was silent and he finally looked up at her to see what she wasn't saying. He was surprised to find her smiling.
Sherlock let that serve as his answer as he edged John against the wall, not hard, but solid enough to press him against the tiles.
"That's the first time I've come with you with any friction whatsoever. Hands-free orgasms, that doesn't happen every day."
It was probably the groundskeeper. That had happened before more than once in those two years without Sherlock. The bloke had gotten to know him, even started to call him by name.
And he wondered what she'd think when she went down to hers and saw that they'd decorated it as well.
"You hold a rather fanciful view of me, John, you always have. I indulge it because it strokes my vanity but it isn't true."
Again John did as requested and noted that Rosie was watching him but mostly the package with interest.
When the plant blew the nearby forests were poisoned like everything else. The soil, water, and atmosphere were blasted with radioactive degrees 20 times more deadly than what was caused by the A-Bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
"No, no, no, no, no. I ruined that. He deserves a clean break, you know. That's the thing." He said with a tight laugh. "That's the thing of it, I get why people have to leave sometimes. I get it. I was pissed but I get it. Sometimes staying does more harm than good. Sometimes you just have to excise the cancer so the healthy body can go on. I'm the cancer."
He flipped through the glossy brochure and finally made a choice that was admittedly solitary. The facility had a full-service fitness center and that seemed like as good a place as any to start and maybe disappear for awhile.
"Yes, well..." Sherlock paused as he retraced his steps. "Yes, as I was saying, there must be a line...a blood brain barrier, if you will, between the addict's experience and what they, in essence, bring home. That barrier, that filter is the job of the sponsor or the therapist. I understand that. Where we part ways is on the nature of my responsibility to John. I could give a long-winded speech about the thin line between pulling someone out of addiction and being pulled down with them. Or speak about the concept of retreating to advance. But I will only say this, if he goes to hell, I go in after him."
They didn't speak. Not because they couldn't because, again, they were off the clock. But because it wasn't necessary. They kissed and kissed and kissed and as Sherlock neared the moments of no return John tightened his grip, making his boyfriend whimper. When he came it was breathy, nearly silent and everything John wanted to hear.
"Whatever you're thinking right now, you're wrong and so is he. He asked you to look out for me when you first met, correct?"
"Yeah..yeah, so I did." John said. He wanted to smile but he was having difficulty reading his mate's face.
I was already furious. I had been since he hadn't come home the night before. Alright, first I had been terrified. He was careless, yes. Thoughtless, absolutely. But even at his worst he would respond to a frantic text from me usually with a curt reply. At his most single minded I would still get the notification he had read it, whether he answered or not. But there had been nothing. Not a word and that grim fear had started to creep over my body that someone might have gotten the best of him. Maybe he was injured. Maybe he was dead.
10 or so minutes later John emerged from the loo having again forgotten his comfy night clothes in his old bedroom. Hair damp and wearing nothing but a towel which he held closed about his waist with one hand he entered the living room.
"Well, you never offered so you'll never know." He said before growing serious. "That was before I went a year without you. Boredom pales in comparison to being without you." He said seriously.
"I hope so.” For a moment, perhaps for the first time in a very long time he was able to turn it around and if only for a moment see it from her point of view. It had been the two of them, brother and sister against their father, against the world for so long. And then nothing. They split. They fractured and were never able to put their ill-fitting pieces back together again.
"He's my best friend. We were separated by necessity so he could get better. He appears to be on the correct path."
But reading wasn't really what he was in the mood for and after about 10 minutes of staring at the same words on the same page and not absorbing anything he closed the book.
The first weeks had been turmoil. Churning up all the philosophical questions of Who am I? and What does this mean? But it didn't trouble him as much as he thought it might. Maybe it was his age. Maybe if he'd been younger he could have, would have tried to explore it deeper, plumb the depths of his psyche. But he was older, he'd seen too much, experienced too much, lost too much to dare to question the simplicity of happy. So, alright then, the touch of Sherlock, the touch of another man, his presence, his scent, him, he...it made John happy, it turned him on. And more than just the touch, more than the sex, it was the experience as a whole that made him feel complete. What of it? What more than that needed to be internally discussed?
Of course, once it was done he didn't know what to do next. So he just sat on it. It was just another file on his computer like a hundred others. He still hadn't told anyone.
Janine. So pretty and kind. So good. She'd even forgiven Sherlock for what John felt was nigh unforgivable. Janine was a good person and John determined he should exit her life as quickly as possible.
Rosie squirmed in his lap and he wasn't surprised. He was probably putting off a negative vibe, his body having gone stiff.
He shoved the pill bottle in his jacket pocket and the box beneath the sofa for later retrieval before going back to the mail.
"Godfather?" Sherlock had asked one day, so early on, clearly wanting to get the wording right and not overstep.
"I want you to be aware of something. It's about the language that you use. Clara = Saintly. Harry = Hellish. You do the same when you're speaking about yourself or Mary or your father. It's an incredibly binary speech pattern."
"No. And they never will. I gave them the same story as the press and general public. If you're worried they'll reject you because of that let me put that fear to rest. It won't happen."
First off, thank you all so very much for all the well wishes. Both Sherlock and I are very appreciative and overwhelmed by the response. In an effort to keep our inbox
It was the brightest I'd seen his eyes in a long time. In fact, they only seemed this vibrant when he was in the midst of a case.
The tears threatened with a burn but the sob that wracked his body was already fully formed when it escaped from his lips.
"I think we're done here for tonight," John said glancing up before looking toward the door dismissively. "You should probably just head back to your room now."
"I told him that I missed him, terribly. I told him he left too soon, we had so much more to experience together. So many more adventures. I told him there were so many things I wanted to say to him that I couldn't now."
"What point in the fantasy makes you come, love? What happens? What do I do?" John asked needing to know more, needing to share Sherlock's vision and play it out in his mind as well.
"Ok, we're going to circle back to this but switch gears for now. I want to follow a hunch. We don't have as much time as I'd like to explore it but it's relevant."
"Jesus..." John replied rubbing his temples. He knew this, of course, like everyone did. It was as common as the 50% divorce statistic but it was so different when you heard it directed at yourself.
"John. John! Open your eyes. Open your eyes right now. Look at where you are. You're in my office, you're safe."
"It means, unless it's a matter of life or death, we're working up until exactly 7PM on Friday and then everything gets shut off. Mobile. Internet. Everything. No callers. No clients, again, unless it's a matter of life or death. We pack Rosie off and see if Molly or Janine will be gracious enough to take her. Then you and I spend a weekend here at Baker Street, just the two of us. We even put a do-not-disturb sign on the door to ward off Mrs. Hudson. How does that sound?"
"That's a normal, level headed response. I'd be suspicious if you said anything otherwise. Now, I'm assuming you know about Family Day."
"While I never believe that false overtures are a good idea. Perhaps it might be wise to try and patch things for Rosie's sake. If they are...patchable." Sherlock ventured.
. It was more about...weakness. Who was he if he was the person in the relationship always crying always needing support and help and assistance? The batty boyfriend? The PTSD freak who needs you to speak softly and not make any sudden movements. Jesus Christ, what kind of life was that? For him? For Sherlock? And what if this was life? What if every day was a fucking struggle or just trying to smother his emotions so he could be normal in public and not sneaking drinks from a flask. Yes, a hand on his back, a gesture of affection and concern it was nice, when he needed it. But what if he never stopped needing it?
A long time ago I read this book and there was a quote that stuck with me and I last thought about it when I actually did plan to kill myself but...it came to me during those terrible months with Mary as well. I know it by heart.
while there was still a chance. Because that chance doesn’t last forever. If I wasn't careful it could be gone before I knew it."
"I said you can't get it any fluffier. You ask yourself how much more fluff could this be? And the answer is none. None more fluff."
"How long before we admit that we're beaten?" John finally asked, trying and failing to stifle a laugh as he buried his face against Sherlock's chest.
"Yes, John." He said, working his palm and fingers over his erection. He certainly looked as though he had a skill, he'd give him that.
The driver, a different one, came to his door and opened it. The chill of the air struck his face and he squinted as he stepped out. He was stiff and sore and an attempt to stretch only brought on a muscle spasm in his back so bad he wished he hadn't tried.
"It was as good a place as any. Home, as a concept or location didn't mean much to me. I just wanted a place to regroup and think. I wanted a loud place where I could be quiet and get lost. That is, by definition, London."
"Ok, that'll do, love." John had said softly, trying to stop the flow of words. "Also, we've decided it might be best if we spend tonight at a hotel. It seems like the best way to get you both to adjust to the situation. We're just going to pack up and be off. Come on, sweetheart."
We shifted positions on the bed again. I was back to lying on my back, Sherlock was on his knees between my legs having retrieved the bottle of lube when I wasn't looking. He drizzled some onto his fingers which confused me. I must have frowned because he spoke.
"Mary" had been there, through it all, encouraging him to stay, to speak and he had. He had cajoled his friend and he had confessed like a guilty penitent to the hallucination of his dead wife.
When he was done and had placed the device back in his pocket John took his gloved hand and held it.
If you think well of me, think well of him. If you think well of him and couldn’t give a toss about me, so much the better.
"Not so much discharge but I can't really chew on that side either. It still feels, well, it feels rather new. Almost like you just put it in."
"That's a natural prejudice in parents. They always see the face of their spouse in their children and rarely their own. It's usually rooted in latent self-esteem issues. But yes, as an impartial party I can say without a doubt she looks like you. Why the nose alone-"
Maybe he should say all of this aloud. Maybe he should admit how absolutely terrified he'd been for a moment in the shop. When the noise and the chatter and the stares and the lights had all come together to make him feel as jumpy and on edge as when he was crawling on his belly through poppy fields in Helmand with Taliban bullets whizzing overhead. Maybe he should to what he wanted which was to take a small refuge in his arms. To just, feel it all again, but in a safe way. Hanah called it "depositing yourself in the moment". Reliving trauma in a secure environment as a way of coping and overcoming it.
may have a hard time trusting them. There may have been ideas or buried facts or truths that have come up for you in your time here and you may be angry with them. You may not trust them or their motives. This can bring things to a standstill but it doesn't have to. Time for some hard truths. Not all relationships are meant to work, not all marriages are meant to stick, not all friendships are meant to last. But I encourage you to prioritize a return to trust, a new relationship, a new pact built on an old one. Even if it doesn't work, if you want it to work you still have to try."
"Why would I do that?" She asked pressing her lips together. "Why would I help you keep doing of this?"
He'd promised Hanah he would do this, promised Sherlock at some point as well and absolutely promised himself.
@ConsultingDetective221B Sherlock, we can’t imagine what you’re going through. But please, can you tell us, is John alright? Will he live?
"There have been three relationships of yours, judging by the way you chatted to me about them over the years, that I thought might pan out. Sarah, Mary-"
"There was nothing about him that would make me think he was gay or bi or anything but straight. But it was still the first time I'd ever felt that way about someone. I chased that feeling until I caught it again with you."
"John, please, don't let it distress you." Sherlock whispered. "I'm fine and I'm enjoying this. Please, please continue." He concluded softly.
Ten minutes later he was sitting there in his chair, his toes flexing against the carpet grabbing it in tufts.
Sherlock on his bed with his trousers around his ankles wanking to gay porn while I was in the next room was incredibly hot and I stiffened in his mouth.
He moved a little more, deeper and as I willed myself to relax the pain seems to be making its exit. This felt like an embarrassingly slow process but progress was being made. I don't even want to know how long it was taking. My mind traveled back a few decades to being a horny teenager having managed to talk my then girlfriend into bed when my parents were away. It was my second time, her first. I gave myself credit for being patient. Is any teenage boy ever patient? I remember it as going slow...was it slow enough? We dated, we had sex plenty of times after that, we were happy in that teenager-y, "our love is perfect and eternal" sort of way. I can't even recall now why we broke up. But I was thinking of her now.
house. Later, before the sunset, his new husband showed him the vegetable garden out back as well as the apiary and they just walked in the gloaming and then the moonlight with the chalky white cliffside of the Downs gleaming in the distance, the Milky Way splashed and streaked overhead.
"You'd say then you've had a minimum of 40 sexual partners possibly double if we account for your 30's?"
At some point or another Mycroft dropped by, unannounced. He looked at them, from one to the other before stating; "Well, that certainly took long enough. Where are you registered?"
“Good boy.” Sherlock now brought the hand that had been attending to his own straining cock to John’s. Wrapping it around his erection he began to stroke it slowly. “Is this good?”
"Because I have never been able to say no to her." He said in a sharp exhale that was part shame part anger. "Because I am caught. Because when Mycroft and I come here as a pair we become children again but at least we are children together. I don't want her attention, I don't want to fall under her eye. Though it may sound counterintuitive the best way to remain ignored is to go with them all to Sherringford."
Finally, I just want you to take it slow, I don't think you should leap, full throttle, back into detective work, or medicine. You should work on this gradually. I would also strongly advise against leaping into a sexual relationship. In my professional opinion, I don't believe you're ready, John. There are things you still need to address and share with Sherlock when you're able."
"Excellent, Rosie." Sherlock said with a smile. "Though it is technically a tortoise. But we'll work on that."
They both sat like that on the bed, John unwilling to give even an inch. He wasn't going to start this conversation. He wasn't going to let Sherlock in or give him an opening. If he had something to say he could say it. If he didn't, well he could march the fuck out.
. The fact that when he walked in and sat down everyone in this room knew that he was going home to a man and not a woman mattered. When he entered this church he was carrying one less secret. And it mattered.
How many hours, days had he spent at that place? How many tears had been shed there? Impossible to know, not that he really wanted to. He still didn't have a plan per se but he knew, right now, this was where he wanted to be. This place made sense.
"Please, John, please." She begged him and after pretending to draw strength from the pretended pressure of her small frame against his, he rose.
I'm trying to think of what my routine will be when I get out of here. I'm not happy that I got fired or how I was fired but I am happy that I don't have to return. I'm not happy in medicine. Not anymore. At the very least I need a break from it. A trial separation if not an outright divorce.
They lay on the bed, John spooning Sherlock. The naked flesh of his chest pressed to the naked skin of Sherlock's back. And they talked. They talked likely as they should have months maybe even years before. They talked as freely as they had that first morning together in rehab. He talked about the ugliness and pain and broken limbs, and ostracization and abuse and neglect of growing up. Sherlock spoke about his travels through Tibet, New Dehli, Nepal, Moldova, Slovakia, Montenegro and on and on and on. The drama and the danger and the fear. The time he'd been jumped in an alley. The time he'd had to run across the top of a moving train. The time he'd somehow served on a murder trial jury. But he also spoke of the loneliness. The crushing emptiness of a life without the familiar. He confessed to reading John's blog. Just to feel connected and daring to leave one comment.
The police arrived along with the press and everyone got nice view of him being lead away in handcuffs. He already knew he was being sectioned so it was no surprise when they took him to the hospital as opposed to the station.
When Sherlock came back the dreams stopped. And for awhile, for just a bit, but not nearly long enough his sleep was untroubled.
I'm going to ask you tomorrow, if I have the nerve, if Rosie and I can move back to Baker Street. I've been wanting to ask you for a few months now but it never seemed like the right time. I realize living with a baby may complicate things but not much more than they are now.
"Hope I'm not late." Molly said entering the flat with a voice a bit too bright and a smile a tad too forced. This had all been wearing on her as well. All of it. Jesus, she needed to get far, far away from them both.
"Pictures?" He asked but even as he was speaking he remembered. The letter she'd sent. The pictures she'd put in a seperate envelope. The envelope he'd never opened.
He put his hand on the side of Sherlock's face and both saw and felt his jaw working as he struggled to find the right words. John felt guilty on so many levels for putting him through this but it was all for the best.
This felt like a success. This felt like a victory. And if there was one thing rehab had taught him, it was to claim his victories when they appeared.
His partner’s legs fell open wider, wanting to give John all the access he needed. Wth each pass John took him as deep as he could until finally he was just skirting the point-of-no-return gag reflex.
He couldn't take it back now. It was out. Another living person had heard it. Not an object but a person and his breathing went from ragged to gasping and the world blurred at the edges. Christ, a panic attack, he was sure of it. Heading at him furious and unstoppable. It had been a while since he had one of these but the feelings were familiar and terrifying. His legs felt weak and he let them slowly go out from under him and he slumped against the wall. Sliding down he eventually came to rest on the floor.
This took an extraordinarily long time to write. In fact, I started it and then wound up trashing most of it and starting over again. But I think that was the right choice. I think, ultimately this is better than where I was originally going. Funny how that happens.
"I feel as though that's something I would have noticed in all these years. I can, after all, hear your shower from this bedroom."
"Before you go, John, I need you to hear something. I understand it may be difficult to accept or even digest at this point. But that's what therapy is, digesting the hard bits."
I love you. As a mate, yes, but more than that. I fought it, fought against it for years. I fought against trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted from you.
He looked at her with narrowed eyes, really looked at her and couldn't deny that she seemed sincere. Slowly he sat back down.
John huffed in anger at his weighty concerns being so easily dismissed. This was all so Sherlock. Thinking problems could be untangled like netting or Christmas lights. It wasn't that simple.
He had hoped to see him healthy, robust, rested. He'd hoped that time away from the turmoil that John brought, Sherlock would have settled, stabilized.
Well, that was clinical enough. Maybe it wouldn't be weird. He could deal with being another of Sherlock's experiments especially if it might alleviate some of what he had just felt which was only just now subsiding.
That same arrogance. Why had he never put that together before? Why was he attracted to that same almighty arrogance over and over again?
Sherlock stilled for a moment, steadying his breathing and John wondered what it felt like, to be penetrated, to be filled. But he couldn’t be jealous because his sensations were off the chart.
As always John was able to put him off then. And again two years later. And again a few years after that.
John settled down into the covers his body finally relaxing. It was out. It had happened. It was happening. My God...the relief he felt.
Sherlock didn’t answer his question but instead, those long fingers were pressing into the flesh of his arse again, tugging him forward and John went deeper still. Sherlock gave three little “Ah’s”. The first two were easily identified as frustrated, nervous and just slightly painful. But the third one, the one that occurred just as John brushed his prostate for the first time was a different sound altogether. It set off a cascade of clenches around John’s cock and he drew in a sharp breath that telegraphed nothing but pleasure.
“You really are remarkable, you know that?” But there was no admiration in his voice that Sherlock could detect and it wasn’t a question.
Today was one of the stop days. They had what seemed like a dozen irons in the fire, a dozen people they were needing to get back to them. But it meant that in spite of all that needed doing, there was nothing much to do today. So when his sister called, at Sherlock's prompting, they agreed to meet for lunch.
John woke up in the middle of the night and to his surprise, Sherlock was still there but sound asleep. He crept to the loo and back to bed carefully so as not to wake him and settled in for a peaceful night's sleep. By the morning Sherlock was gone.
"This shouldn't still be here." He said gesturing at the marker that bore his name. "It's an ugly oversight and an abhorrent reminder of something I'd like us both to move past. I can think of no better end for it than this. And no better people than us to send it on its way."
"Hmm...oh...after I thought about it I had a hunch. I followed you the other night. Listened to you outside the bathroom door." He said nipping at his bottom lip. "It sounded so hot."
Instead, when they got into bed at night they'd kiss, exchange I love you's and John would turn on his side and go to sleep. Or at least try to sleep.
"Excellent! Yes, yes we'll be in touch soon. Ok. Ok, great. Cheers." He concluded and placed his phone back in his pocket. "Hello, darling."
"If you cannot logically present your side then it would stand to reason your side has no logic behind it. So, off you go. If you can convince me that I would be better off without you then I'll let you go."
"No, please, I'd like to. We had a list of rotating chores at rehab. It made me intolerant of idle time. I'd like to keep busy, at least for now. Is that ok?"
Ahhh The Cedars. The sight where it first almost happened. One room, two beds, no heat. They’d been forced to climb in together, forced to share space and warmth. Forced to ignore absurdly prominent erections and instead try to go to sleep. They didn’t speak of it the next morning and instead went about business as usual. It was undoubtedly one of the most ridiculous experiences in their shared lives and it most certainly did not make its way into a blog entry.
“We’ve kept too much from each other,” John whispered. “You from me. Me from you. Everything locked up so goddamn tight.”
The timer sounded again and the 15 minutes were up. They were done for the night and Sherlock made his way back up the bed and they shared a kiss.
"On your chair so I can give you a once over." I said and as he walked silently to the sofa I finished making my tea.
Funny thing about habits that people fall into. They often forget why they even started them in the first place.
The man made a small frantic noise in his throat and it was the first bit of relief John had felt since this whole ordeal began. But not just relief, pleasure. He liked that he was afraid. He wanted to make him afraid.
"I'm just saying, it's a good thing you deleted the solar system so you could save space for Gooseberry Wife lore."
This was something John hadn't planned for. He didn't realize that Mycroft and Sherlock, for all their bickering, worked in tandem when dealing with their parents. Maybe his boyfriend wasn't as settled into his denial about them as he'd previously assumed.
Days later he'd been lying against Sherlock while both of them were gazing listlessly at the tv. It was impossible not to notice his boyfriend had rather busy hands.
You've done no such thing. You've deprived yourself of sleep and convinced yourself you've managed to do what people are incapable of doing it.
"Just try not to leave quite so many eyeballs, skulls and various limbs around...at least not within reach."
"I mean, she's been through this before, you know? This isn't the first time I've been in a place like this. I want her to know I'm serious this time. God, I just want my family back. I grouse and I run my life down to shit but I just want them back."
"That night at Angelo's...what did you want to do? What were you planning? Even if you were never going to have the nerve to work up to it."
He'd managed to come two characters under the limit and it seemed good enough to send so he pressed the button.
He redoubled his efforts and Sherlock's hips raised off the bed seeking more of his mouth. More contact, more pressure, more focus, more of everything, begging pleading with his body and that beautiful mouth with those cupid's bow lips, keening and crying out and whimpering and begging and begging and begging until he came in John's mouth, thick and hot.
"I know you can take it but I'm going to go slow at first." John paused. "I need to take my time before going deeper."
So, this was originally one enormous chapter that at last count totaled 59 pages in my Google Doc. But I decided to split it into two. So you're getting this part now (about 27 pages) and the rest sometime later this week. :)
"I was texting with that girl on the bus who turned out to be Sherlock's sister and...texting turned to sexting and we got off together. Or I suppose I got off, I imagine she was just laughing like the Mad Hatter somewhere. I guess that's the excitement of the affair you mentioned."
"Of course you don't Sherlock, you've always had it. People who have money never think it's that important. For god sakes, you had an ancestral seat." He said letting the plate clatter in the sink. "Don't think I missed that little fact about Musgrave Hall. You do realize that not everyone in the world has an
"Me too." John said. They'd been standing in the kitchen at the time and John had his hands on his boyfriend arse. Enjoying the firm, roundness beneath his palms he gave Sherlock an appreciative squeeze which the younger man was just on the edge of getting accustomed to.
I accept your death. But I don't accept suicide and I never will. I know there was something else. There had to be.
"Um, yes, that was, I believe our last truly honest time with each other. There were moments of honesty over the months that followed but as time went on he closed more and more of himself off. After that it was just deception after deception."
It wasn't that her words hadn't hit their target. She was good at that. But he was only able to handle life in small bites now and she was advising him that rip off a big chunk with his teeth.
“I loved every moment of it.” He said releasing a ragged breath. He never allowed himself to think of these times. Something about the pleasure he took from these memories disquieted him. “There was a repetition to this period that I liked. The owner of the pub was into some criminal stuff, pretty low level when we started. One night he calls Duck and me into his office and asks if we’d like to pick up some spare work on the side. Just running errands, he says. I was wary but Duck was all for it. God knows I would have followed him anywhere. So the next thing you know, well, we’re kind of enforcers for this guy, collecting cash, ferrying packages the contents of which I really didn’t want to know between people. All of a sudden we’re seeing more money than we’ve ever seen before in our lives. We move out of our flat into a better one on a better side of town.”
to be and would like to be again. That was unexpected and undeserved on my part. I cannot ever thank you enough and I cannot ever hope to repay the kindness and the forgiveness you have all displayed for me. I am so sorry for the turmoil and the damage I inflicted, for the awful worry and hurt I placed right in the center of your lives with my alcoholism. Because, yes, I can say it now, my name is John and I am an alcoholic. I've spoken to some of you privately and I intend to have a conversation with you all because you deserve my heartfelt apology and my promise to make amends. I don't..."
"I'm teasing you, John. It's a ceramic cup." Hanah replied giving it a resounding flick with her finger before adding. "There hasn't been a Starbucks here in years. Now, what did you think of the test?"
Again, he knew something else was going on here. He could take this. He could handle it. If Sherlock didn't even really care that much about his parents emotionally then maybe it didn't matter if they knew.
Jesus, his sweetness about all this was starting to make John feel sick. It was too nice, so nice, so terribly nice and he didn't deserve it, not any of it.
"Oh yes, I mean, she was the new nurse but by the time I got back to work she knew her way around. She'd let me know who my next patient was and what was wrong with them. She'd hand me files and do some basic work up's for me. But there wasn't much reason for us to interact beyond that unless one of us went out of our way. One day she sat down with me as I was having my lunch. Mary could just draw you into a conversation by being audacious or contrary or funny or unexpected. I think she managed all four in the span of about five minutes with me. I liked it. It surprised me that I liked it. I got used to it and started to look forward to it. But, I don't think I was going to make a move. I was too frightened to make any more moves. There was one day we'd been in mid-conversation after office hours and I suddenly remembered I had scheduled an appointment with Ella. I excused myself, rather abruptly and said I'd see her tomorrow. I got a few stoplights away and received a text from her."
"Bacterial endocarditis. I think I'm saying that right. Everybody around me had been fighting the flu, right? So I didn't think too much of it when I started to feel sick. Chills, fever, muscle aches, you know. But it kept going on and on. I started losing weight and getting these shooting pains in my abdomen. Finally one night it was bad enough that I had to go to hospital. It all came out then, of course. What I'd been doing...again. It was bad. They had to do heart surgery, replace some of my fucked up valves."
"No, now see you're coming dangerously close to policing my addiction and Hanah said not to do that, remember." John had replied with a sneer.
He lifted the lid and the seat as a precaution but followed that by leaning his head back and resting it against the wall.
My body was finally obeying me. I was telling it to relax and it was obliging in every way. He had his hand loosely around my cock and I watched pre-cum glisten on the head before running down.
I looked up and expected to see that slightly ashamed face he usually wore. But while he'd changed into the clothes I'd laid out for him, sweat pants and a St. Bart's t-shirt he hadn't put on that look.
"Well, then I'm in good company," he said drying his friend's cheeks. Once done he followed an instinct he couldn't trace and bringing his mates face close to his, he planted a kiss on his forehead.
Christmas morning was to be spent on the floor of Harry and Clara's place surrounded by toys and discarded wrapping paper. Christmas afternoon was slated for close friends at their flat. But for Christmas Eve, John wanted it to be just the two of them. He'd cooked dinner all by himself, though he couldn't exactly vouch for the quality. He'd made sure they'd spent the afternoon with Mrs. Hudson while politely hinting they'd be unavailable that night. And then, he pushed their chairs to the side and cleared the floor as much as he could.
There was silence on the line. Dead silence and were it not for a soft movement of what he assumed was Sherlock on his bedding he might have thought they'd been disconnected or he'd hung up.
"Positive." And I was. You can be absolutely terrified of something but still know it's the right thing to do.
"I'm not sure how to..." He cleared his throat and gestured towards Sherlock's erection. "Idiotic since I volunteered."
His partner and his daughter were giggling in the other room still tickled nearly to tears that he'd dropped his ice cream all over his shirt. They'd been leaving the zoo on an absurdly warm February day and a simple pebble in the road caused him to lose his step. He'd righted himself before falling but the ice cream, sadly, was no more. Once they'd gotten to Baker Street he'd made a beeline for their bedroom to change shirts and wash up.
All of that was decided before their romance was even on the table. John wanted to be there at Baker street, needed to be, in fact. He wanted Rosie to grow up with the two of them, he wanted her to grow up with the two of them in a two parent household. He wanted her to be surrounded by the two people who loved her mother most of all and the memories they could share. Sherlock never mentioned children, never seemed to think much about them, though John did recall he had a certain affection for Archie but that didn't mean he'd leap into fatherhood. And yet here he was, as at ease with Rosie as though he'd been caring for children all his life. There were flashes when the oddest memories would come into John's mind. Those rare times when he'd caught Mycroft looking at Sherlock when the latter had no idea. This pained expression, heavy with a need to protect, heavy with fear and all the complicated remnants that remained when you'd tried to tell yourself not to love but you loved anyway. It was brief and it would disappear as they launched into barbs directed at one another. But John saw it now, completely untainted when Sherlock gazed at Rosie. A need to protect. A fear for her safety and unabashed loved.
Why were there so many? Why were these two things so intertwined? He was willing to wager that if he looked up sex instructionals for heterosexuals it wouldn't yield quite so many sad sack results. He hated the idea that his addiction might be wrapped up in his sexuality. Something about it all made it sound like the reason you're gay, or in his case bi, is because there's something wrong with you. And the reason there's something wrong with you is because you're gay. It was a snap judgment and a snap summary and though a part of him knew it was wrong he couldn't shake the implication. Correlation did not imply causation. There was nothing tainted about the way he felt for Sherlock or the way he'd felt for Duck before him. The alcohol, the abuse, the anger, these were all separate and he was going to work on them separately. These were lines he didn't want muddied and wires he didn't want crossed.
"But support does not mean monitoring his progress through the steps, it doesn't mean looking over his shoulder and it doesn't mean thinking you are the solution to his addiction. You aren't, just as he isn't the solution to yours. I need you both to understand that this is
He looked around his group and was surprised to see a few faces he recognized, some from the crap telly he'd watched and others quite a bit higher up in the celebrity echelon. Again he felt out of place. He didn't belong here and not because his addiction was so unique. But because these people were bloody stars; some of them a bit B or C list but there were a few A's as well. This was absolutely barmy. He didn't belong with people whose publicists reported to the news they were being treated for exhaustion. He was ordinary and wasn't this experience supposed to at least put him with his peers. But why the fuck was he freaking out about this? He didn't care about their good opinion or what they thought of him? And still, if it was meant to be a support group how could he expect support from and to trust people who so clearly weren't similar to him at all? There were also a handful of faces he'd never seen before, definitely not celebrities, quietly sitting, perhaps trying to stay anonymous. He thought for a minute perhaps they were like him but then he looked at their shoes, easily calculated the price and decided they weren't. His mind and his anxiety felt all over the place and he swallowed hard, tugging at the collar of his shirt which suddenly felt too tight.
be checking the inbox on our honeymoon. He thought he was going to be but has since been set straight on that issue.
The pain came creeping back as pain was wont to do. In fact it seemed like now it was almost constant. Nagging and sharp and infiltrating everything he did or tried to do.
John hadn't wanted to push things too far or too fast but everyone had agreed that getting Rosie accustomed to, at the very least, his face was a good idea for starters.
"No, no I want too." And he did. Every part of his body was thrumming for this next experience. But a part of him was having experience overload. There'd been a brief time during his stint at St. Bart's where he's taken up partying to let off some steam. Nothing major but a ridiculous adjustment for him nonetheless. He'd fallen a bit behind in classes and had to cram like he'd never crammed before. It all worked out in the end but he was having those feelings again. The feeling of trying to learn everything he should have learned, experimented with and tried ages ago in a compressed period of time. He felt foolish and worried he'd make a mistake.
He came and he came and he kept coming, spasm after spasm, ejaculate shooting out of his cock onto the sheets. What didn't hit the sheets coated John's hands as he continued to messily stroke his lovers still not flagging erection smearing it happily.
"True but I don't think we're supposed to live like monks either. I mean..." He sighed. "I'm still not 100% but I can touch you and please you and that gives me pleasure too, you know? You shouldn't have to tiptoe off to the bathroom to have a wank like you were a sex criminal in your own home. Sherlock, I love you. And I'm happy to show you that by dashing with you through the streets of London, and pulling your arse out of the fire when need be and making you amazing cups of tea and tending to you when you're sick. But let me do it this way too, ok? Please?"
"I don't want to be trapped by my answer." he said practically gritting his teeth to avoid sobbing again.
I felt such anger, such rage, I knew I wasn't doing a good job of controlling myself with someone who had clearly taken leave of their senses.
"Enter your phone number, email and handle and I'll be in touch. And you'll still need to find a local therapist. I have a Location provided list so no worries about lying. They contracted, they have clearance and if you decided on one of them they'll be briefed in full. You can speak freely with whoever you choose. I
during reflection time. They'd provided him with a journal and pens so he could write down his thoughts.
were quitting. He didn't want it to appear that he was too old and too tired and too weary. But he was. He was all of those things. So, when Sherlock brought it up, unprompted, John felt a tremendous weight lifted from his shoulder.
"Is that what you want?" John asked suddenly, turning so quickly Sherlock nearly slammed into him. "Is that what this weekend was about. Some sort of stress test created to make me break. Put the stupid rat in maze that will make him break. Do you want
John ran soft, massaging fingers through Sherlock's curls, alternating between gently scratching and rubbing his scalp. He could feel his boyfriends body stretch and relax, settling into the attention.
In the face of all that, waiting for that man to be ready certainly didn't seem like a hardship, no matter how blue the balls.
To prevent any further unintentional damage to his good name I wish to publicly disassociate myself from Sherlock Holmes.
"Oh no, how on earth would I know. I've only spent the majority of my life either with a needle shoved up my arm or wishing there was one. What the hell would I know, John? You know, I have been called all manner of names over the course of my life. Cruel, mean, thoughtless, withdrawn, cold, unfeeling. And I have owned up to everyone, every accurate reading. But never, in my days, have I met a more reticent, recalcitrant, misanthropic and closed off man. You have no idea how to allow someone to get close to you. And I cannot believe these words are leaving my mouth.
"As well as property in a vibrant part of a London. Also, consider the fact that she was able to keep our flat vacant for two years without taking in other tenants to make up for the loss of income."
It was as if life wouldn't allow him to have them both at the same time. As if his greed demanded that a balance be struck. And so she was ripped away from him. Pulled from this world by a bullet meant for the other love of his life. And he tore himself to pieces for what he'd done to her, what he'd almost done to her, what she had done to their family and what Sherlock had done to them both. And oh dear God what he had done to Sherlock.
"Look, we need this. I need this. Not just for the money but for us. For some sort of future where I don't think of myself as this useless lump."
"You think I'm going to have some sort of breakdown?" He asked with a grin that was more hostile than sincere. "I'm not. Really, not having anyone here was my idea. I didn't ask anyone, no one turned me down you know? I'm fine."
Steady rhythm established John turned his attention to Sherlock's neck. It had been one of the first things to draw his eye, and his obsession in those early days. Now he took great pride in claiming it, dotting it with love bites, marking it as his own. He decorated his neck with hickey's like a teenager and didn't feel even the slightest hint of regret at the fact that his boyfriend had to up his scarf collection.
"Do what you have to do. But I still need you to feel the wood of the arm rests beneath your hands. Feel the floor beneath your feet. Look at the focal point we choose, the clock on my desk. And hear my words."
"Well then," he said, tossing the papers aside. "If I may make a request. You top." He said making sure to pop the 'P' at the end.
Following their established protocol John silently removed his body from his friend. Sherlock wasn't looking so he gave his cock a squeeze as he got off the bed.
He was struggling with the whole scenario and had been since they'd begun a few days prior. It felt combative, it felt like poking the hornet's nest and his mind and body rebelled against summoning these spirits so vividly.
He forced an odd smile and one that was completely unfamiliar to John. As he did so he raised his right hand, running it through his curls. The movement caused the dressing gown to come undone and that was when John noticed it just a split second before the door shut...and locked.
"Oxycodone and Hydrocodone. But, as I said I didn't take them." He watched as she typed on her computer not looking up at him. "You're typing an awful lot just to say I never took them."
"Have a seat and I'll bring it to you. Don't get used to this though. I'm just feeling domestic today."
"Thank you. I just want to know about Duck. From my point of view he came in one day, whisked you away and I never saw you again. I lost my brother."
He was, in a word, flabbergasted, when Sherlock walked away and without so much as a glance back, headed to his bedroom. John stood there in the upstairs hallway gawping at his back for a moment before turning in the opposite direction and going to his own quarters. Everything was fresh and clean, the bed newly turned down but he barely gave any of it a passing glance. Instead, he set his bag on the floor and promptly went toward Sherlock's bedroom.
He bought the paper and pen and another bottle of whiskey to keep what was already inside him company and he set out.
"No. That's ridiculous. You may have put me in a posh rehab but I'm not a celebrity. Nobody cares except for a few people on Twitter and maybe that club Anderson started."
"Look there's Daddy and what's he got for you? Why it's your own bumble bee." Sherlock said and while John internally started at the sudden use of the word "Daddy" neither of them reacted outwardly.
"Ok, backtracking a little here. Sherlock, same question I posed to John, what do you want from a sexual relationship?"
It had started to snow a little after he left the pub and he brushed off the thin coating of flakes that were gathered on the grave.
"Alright, I'm just...there's not going to be many places we can go in London or the world at large where they don't serve alcohol. I'm going to have to get used to it, you know?"
He knew it would come up and in the light of day the action, though not the urgency behind it, embarrassed him.
Now, Sherlock, you also need to set some boundaries. Things you will and won't accept. From what I've learned, from both of you, you're very tightly intertwined. If one of you starts to go down the other does as well, like sky divers whose parachutes get locked up.
Sherlock wasn't one for endearments and it always surprised John when his boyfriend used such affectionate, intimate language. He also couldn't get enough of it.
And he would tell him. The numbers stayed essentially the same. Enough to stop the pain of waking up, enough to stop the difficulty of going to sleep, enough to make it one more day. He would then translate that into bottle or liters or whatever his friend needed.
