"I know. Soon. Right now I just want to see John. Mad or not, I don't even care. I just want to sit and look at him. I have missed him."
Death moved closer each hopeless day. They were old acquaintances now. Sitting alone in his flat, he smiled as he invited his acquaintance to dinner. There were the painless instruments on his coffee table. It has only taken him a week to acquire them. He was a doctor. He knew how to do this in the most pleasant form possible. Some days he looked at his pistol, knowing he wouldn't feel much that way either. Death looked at him without emotion and he returned the gaze.
John paused, wanting to say the right thing. " Ford, he's an honorable man. I swear to you, he is deeply an honorable man. They both are, if you want my honest opinion. That's what the ordinary wretches can't abide. They could never be him, and they hate him so much for it. He's beautiful and they want to destroy what they can never achieve. I should have told him that. At exactly the wrong time, I was one of them."
She smirked and rubbed noses with him. John brought the tea in and she looked up as she took the cup. “You and Mary aren’t getting on?” she said with disapproval.
“If one disregards the ghost, it only leaves one suspect. But one aspect doesn’t make sense. Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit?”  Sherlock questions.  “No. Not you. Not you.” Sherlock becomes more agitated.
“He told me to. Said it was fine. Seemed pretty pleased at your audaciousness. He was running late for dinner and said he would give us a private moment while he got ready and that he just loved weddings. Next thing I knew, he and I were sharing an ambulance and he said you didn’t have much of a chance to live. They kept asking who tried to kill you, but I never saw them. I do know what he is like, but it was just a good job and he knew some things that I’m not very proud of, but other than a bit of teasing, he always treated me well. He was always nice to me. Like an indulgent but slightly baffled Uncle. He did a lot for me in the early days and I was very loyal to him. I actually met Mary there. He said they had known each other for years. He laughed when I told him about the wedding and how you and I had hit it off. He said I should let you come on up and propose properly. We didn’t expect whoever gave us the goose eggs and we still don’t have a clue how they got in.   You didn’t say John was with you. I wonder why they left him be? Poor Carl, the security guy, he’s pretty tough and he still can’t work. Hit him so hard it cracked his skull.” She explained.
"No. You aren't that important to me. I could happily do without you. Sherlock would be better off without you at this point."
“And there he is. Thought we'd lost you for a moment. May I just check? Is this what you mean by ‘controlled usage’?"
“Lucky for you another came along to keep that from happening, provided you don’t accidently hit something.”  Rat approached the spot the shots had come from.  He ignored John signaling for him to get down and walked slowly across the roof in his crumpled tux like a man searching for a wayward kitten.  His gun came up as he approached the target, but the smile on his face was genuine.  “Before you ask, you are not dead.”
"John, we can't do anything else for him. I know. I know you and he were … more than mere … friends. I don't know how far and I don't want to know, because it isn't my business and I don't care. I am here, because, there have been some who have mentioned you are not managing this. I do understand the desire to hope above all facts. But he wouldn't want to see you like this. I can't stand to see you do this any longer. You have to accept this. Grieve. Stop cursing your life with this obsessive false footing. I have seen this sort of thing. You have too."
“Possibly. Never-the-less, it is the truth.  I hate this.  We are eliminating the crumbs and I have let the meaty-bits slip away.  This will take years at this rate.  My plan was better.”
"Well, I have lots of impressive scraps of paper and I'm a homeless junkie. At least this week. I win." He says with a smirk and popping the last of the sandwich in his mouth and helping himself to her fizzy water without asking.
Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoyed my first attempt at Sherlock. I very much enjoyed writing it and hope you will check out my other Sherlock stories to be posted soon,
"Yes. So why do you have to ask for them to bring it to you. You hate it cold and you don't order anything different, but they stand around and wait for you to ask. You should have hot coffee by your chair at all times, whether you drink it or not. But you don't ask them to do that. They make you wait."
Before Mycroft had washed his balls and claimed his first par, Sherlock was searching the halls for the room of a desperately miserable doctor. He found him, restrained, drugged out of his mind and embarrassingly sitting on a bed pan.
“The conspirators had someone on the inside. They found a body, just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when... Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?” Sherlock pulls a bottle of pills from his pocket and is straining to remove the cap when John snatches them from his hand.
Jim went so far as to lie to the world. He arranged the three break-ins and the talk of the key-code in an enormous and elaborate scheme to win Sherlock from Dr. Watson. Jim could have won anyone he'd wanted with his brains, money and power. Why would he set his sights on Sherlock? What could he gain?
“If you were not there to protect me, how long do you estimate it would take for me to be found crammed into luggage and left in the tub to rot. Nobody would even discover me for ages.” Sherlock said as if it didn’t bother him in the least.
"France. We had to smuggle you in as cargo, due to the unfortunate difficulty of you not currently resembling your fake passport. No need to thank me, I don't mind a little detour. Your company is well worth any trouble you have been."
John would have been devastated at his best friend’s second death, but it would have been clean and acceptable. Killed doing what he loved was far better than driven to suicide. John was a soldier; he could have understood that kind of tragedy and moved forward.
Janine shrugged and looked at John, waiting for him to explain. John cleared his throat and waved his hand sheepishly. “Sorry about that. It just slipped out.”
He accepted and shoved a third of it in his mouth as if he were starving, then spoke before he was finished chewing. "I'm sorry. I'm socially awkward as well. Everyone hates me in fact. Had my own fun at Public school, though in my case it was Harrow and my brother had been athletic and liked. I was a disappointment."
Sherlock tilted his head, "I thought that would be obvious. I am taking you with me, the only way I can."
Now her list may be crushed. She stands abruptly as she let the thought of being a mother slip away. Her eyes were dry and her nose was running as she made her way stoically up the stairs to check for a deep blue duffle at the back of John's wardrobe, under his other suitcases and stacks of blankets.
“This should do quite nicely.  Very good nick, by the way, but not flaming ostentatious tosser.  After seeing your’s, I feared I’d find apple green with frills in here,”  John said, taking a piss at Rat with good natured disapproval.
John sat placidly in his fresh jim-jams, having had his bath, and wearing a clean diaper and in the firelight of the darkened flat, Sherlock pretended.  John looked and smelled like John.  He had improved here.  Sherlock had coaxed him into walking again if he guided him.  He sometimes dressed him on pretty days and took him to the park.  John seemed to like it outside and he needed the activity to keep his body from further atrophy.
"I learned that you put up with a lot and ignore the games they play with you, because you know what is more important. You pick what you get mad about."
Sherlock Holmes jumped off a fucking building to save him and it took him this long to question that he may have not been quite as selfish of a bastard as the person he saved had thought.
John broke up into a burst of laughter and finally helped himself to a chocolate, agreeing profusely with Sherlock’s scientific description of the combination. He looked at his glass and again grew serious as he said in an unobtrusive voice, “I have made a decision. It was hard, but I know it is the right thing. I am getting a divorce.”
Mary smiled fondly at them both. “Someone has to keep track of you, Sherlock. Must be hard being the slow little brother.”
"Molly, he left a note, his wallet, and his phone on Waterloo Bridge. At six-fourteen, according to the time stamp on the footage, this morning, just at sunrise. He was seen climbing over the rails and he didn't wait around. Most take hours and two dozen people chin-wagging to either make their point or pull back. It's just a cry for help. John wasn't making a gesture. He got right to his intended plans. A lad here from uni, caught it on his camera phone. He and his friends popped out for the sunrise. Wasn't raining then. They were just out for kicks and having a laugh. The pictures clear and crisp. The bloody kids leaked it to the media…God, it's on every channel. Got no doubt," he says reasonably, in his most soothing voice.
He had to either close his eyes and hang on to the wheel, turn into the red sky and beat to weather on a ship that was not seaworthy or he had to admit he was a rat on a ship filing Samarra as its destination and abandon it without any care to its fate.
"Mrs. Hudson said it was fine. They are on the roof. Two floors away.  They are hardly going to pop down for tea." Sherlock challenged, his face a mask of livid refusal.
John had treated Sherlock as if his sacrifice was no sacrifice, but a betrayal. John understood now how that must have hurt his best friend. John had said that he would always believe in Sherlock, but it wasn't true. He had forgotten his promise. He had been so focused on getting what he wanted, that he had never looked at it from Sherlock's point of view.
Richard the lionhearted was attended by a Holmes all the way to the crusades and it was a Holmes who paid his ransom and brought him back to his beloved people. It is legend that the last of the Templars were protected by the French Holmes family and found safe passage for the betrayed knights. There should have been reprisals, but even foolish popes and greedy kings can be brought to justice. The Poor Knights were aided by the St. Claire family and continued existence into the present day.
Sherrinford snorted, and unzipped one of the bags.  “Hardly my debut, John.”  He picked up the unzipped bag, moving it to the other bed and pointed to the remaining one as he stated, “That one is for you.”
There were other tales of that Sherlock from long ago having been caught red-handed visiting various famed Molly Houses. Buggery was against the law and to be found guilty meant prison and ruin. James Spensor was the last man to be hanged for the crime in 1860, but conviction or rumor effectively ended the life of anyone suspected none- the-less. There were many famous cases in which the highest were brought to ill fate at the mere accusation of such propensity. Sherlock had died in 1893 and it is rumored that his name was still being dragged through the muddy waters at the trial of Oscar Wilde two years later.
John looked at him with cynical amusement. "I hardly think his overdose falls exclusively in my hands. If he was telling the truth, that's kind of a double standard. Seems there were similar events on your watch. "
Sherlock stood on the street looking up at the building. It looked nothing like it had that night long ago. It had been transformed. It was also occupied, which would complicate things. Sherlock was certain that John would leave his clue in the place the body had been. He ran the stairs and knocked on the door. He inquired of a short woman, probably a retired teacher from her propensity toward apple fashion, whether something had been inadvertently delivered to her by mistake. He made pleasant chatter as he perused her now carpeted and comfortably bright accommodations.
There were only seven people on earth who would ever refer to him as the Sumatra Rhino. He looked at his watch, it was just half past two and the Tube was closed. He had to walk three blocks before he found a taxi. He was let off at Bow Road Station, and walked east, searching for the rendezvous location. He curses that he handed his weapon to Molly.
He only did it to keep going because his body was betraying him with fatigue, lack of food and the crushing headache he could no longer ignore. The signs are familiar. He'd been here before. Having survived so many close calls, he couldn't help but find it disappointing that he'd ended up fulfilling Sally Donavan's often pronounced prediction. The body he happened to murder was his own, but there would be an investigation after all, beings it may be less than apparent how a dead man would again be found freshly dead a second time.
He’d smiled at her, just the way she’d always liked, and replied, “Only his naughty bits, it was your contribution that made him dazzling.”
John tilted his can of beer up again and kept his eyes on Sherlock, "Yes, you are effective in that department. So how was your day? Did our fair lady give you any trouble?"
Sherlock was as brass as a candlestick. Sherlock was as golden as a halo. Sherlock was as detailed as the devil. John no longer met the eyes of the shadow. John is, for the first time in his life, truly alive. He did know from experience that Sherlock could die. He knew that in the end, it was more than likely that Sherlock would get John killed in one of his save the world adventures. They needed it for different reasons, but they both needed danger. But he never would have guessed that Sherlock would just give up. Giving up was not an option so long as they were together, because they were invincible as a team.
It hurt so much that she considered killing them both and disappearing into the night. Five years of peace wiped away by a mistake. She should have known better than to care. If she ran now, they would never leave her alone. She could not raise a child on the run but they could take the baby if she stayed. She hated feeling cornered and helpless. John had no idea what she had overcome and if he sent her away, she would be on her own this time. There would be no benevolent government official available to ease her way.
"Are you wishing you had been more careful what you wished for? The memory of me you created in your literary endeavors, not living down to the messy reality of me?"
John snickered, and then tried to clear his throat to cover.  “Seriously?  You want me to give you a fan girl review while we are trying to be invisible from people shooting at us while you are in a purple tuxedo and your main concern is, did your performance on stage impress me?” John said as they darted around a corner, somewhat out of breath.  He leaned over to look back the way they came and tucked back just in time for a slug to give the old plaster above his head a reason to slough off spectacularly in huge chunks.
The transport was wobbling by the time he got down the stairs.  He could not see his phone, he could barely see at all.  Just after feeling the door to John and Rosie's room, he lost the ability to navigate and slid down the rest of the stairs on his stinging bum.  Everywhere stung, in fact, and he was so alive with pain that he was getting a bit numb.
Mycroft sat and contemplated these connections, feeling like he'd been personally betrayed by those who had vetted her. But, this had all taken place years before, so there had been no glaring connections to follow up. James would not risk his kingdom for many years and there was no reason to suspect Sherlock would be able to pull himself out of the rubbish he'd made of his life at that time. Molly was actually one of the few people who seemed to be willing to give Sherlock any kindness.
*An offer that you should probably point more in the direction of my brother if my opinion may be taken in good spirit. M*
Sherlock quickly scrambles as John heads to the bathroom, not quite making it to the toilet before violent heaves and sobs mix with half formed wails of anguish. Sherlock follows and makes a face, but John falling apart before his eyes is much more important. He takes a flannel and dampens it, carefully mopping the vomit and tears away. John's emotions are manifesting in desperate wails of near insanity. Sherlock kneels down on the floor once the major heaves have passed and he wraps his arms around John, just as he's longed to do for so long.
“You know that I am dead.  Time will do what it is meant to do.  I have no power over this.  Sherlock, I don’t want you to mourn me at the expense of your sanity. Can’t you understand that this,” John said waving his hand between them, “Is not healthy?  I am a tool for you to find peace.  I am not and can’t be your peace with the fact you are going to lose your mind.”
John began to respond in kind. He closed his eyes and tried to follow as best he could.  Of course he was angry with him, but John knew his anger was not what Sherlock needed right now.  He had to be his conductor.  Sherlock had to know John was there, that his conductor of light would not give up on him.
"Yeah, CCTV. I feel so safe and happy, wish they would wipe my arse for me too. I hear from a trustworthy source that that is actually in the works. I can't wait for the wonders of such assistance. I actually know the British government, by the way. Had coffee with him last month."
"Is that so? Just out of curiosity, what were your plans after you saved me from dismemberment and deadly nightshade?" John asked, trying a hatch he was passing and finding it blocked.
Sherlock didn't wait long. He opened the door and walked to the end of the bed. "I thought you might be interested. I love you more than I ever loved anyone. Even more than me. I didn't stop. I love you. I always will. I will come back in any capacity you will have me. I can't be without you. I will only leave if you tell me it is my only way to make you happy."
Sherlock, called after him, several times, even following him down the stairs. But, John ignored him.
Molly begins to sob and Greg chews his lip and pats her like a child, murmuring silly, meaningless words. The only thing he can make out is 'all my fault' and he chides her gently. He tries to convince her that she can't predict the future, as if he's speaking to his daughter.
There was a reason Watson was so alone when he'd met Sherlock. There was a reason he had such deep seeded trust issues. He'd tried so hard to be a fluke, a success story, the one guy who emerged from his career relatively intact. John had watched most of his superiors die over the years. Those who had trained him were all gone. Only five had even attempted the transition into civilian life. Most had nothing to go back to so they picked some showy end and that was termed southern retirement. There were a few who found themselves in a situation similar to his own and they were offered the chance to pretend.
He’d planned to stay but when Mycroft showed up at John’s flat, escape was really his only option.  He waited for John to contact him but when he realized it was improbable, he grieved for John and then the inevitable call of the crown pried more time and more doubt into his thoughts.
John took a deep breath and held it.  He sucked half his lip between his teeth and worried at it a moment.  "I am sorry, but I do.  Has to be said.  I am not what the jumpers and tea tin says Sherlock.  I want to be that guy that you think I am and she thought I was...but...the day I beat you for something you did not do, changed that.  Not only did I intend to put you in the hospital...I think I tried to kill you.  I want to deny that, I have run it through my head a million times...but I cannot pretend I would have stopped.
The coincidence of the name Moriarty now made Mycroft's skin crawl, for he'd seen variations on it for his whole life, yet never connected the dots. There were ancient records that spoke of bandits with names like Muircheardach and McMuirihertie.
“No, not at present.  But, if it ever does have a chance to exist, Mr. Conductor there will be driving the train.”
John took a deep breath and held it before whispering, “Everything. My God, Mary, it meant everything.”
They had been in hiding for five months and other than the intermittent move and Rat scarpering off on occasion, there was little to do besides recover.  John had been on six very boring missions and he felt useless.  Rat constantly affirmed that Sherlock was fine, but John had yet to lay eyes on him and it was frustrating.
"So, let me get this correct. You know she's a beautiful, intelligent, kind woman, and she's devastated right this minute. Her fiancé died and she probably blames herself and you admit she is in a fragile state. And your solution to that is? Seriously? You shag her like a brass nail and hand her a nice tip of blame and think you played a blinder?" Ghost John would be leaning toward him, elbows on his knees, hands clasp in the center with his two index fingers meeting and all but wagging at Sherlock.
The wine was light and fresh and flavourful.  I drank it rather quickly, felt it buzz inside my head and exchange greetings with the bother that had taken up prior residence.
The fellow grinned.  “You wouldn't be far wrong, I don't suppose.  Now, mind your elbow, Dr. Watson, don't go and lean it in the butter dish.  I've better things to do than scrub your shirt-sleeves day and night.”
“To my new life.  To life with... you,” I pointed at him, and he raised his eyebrows high into his head.  “It all takes time,” I said, into my wine.
“All this fresh air,” I said, “is making you a harlot.”  I touched his hand.  “I'm not complaining in the least.”
Of all the exasperating situations that a man might find himself within, I had found myself within one.  The year was 1881, the early part of it, and I had recently found well-appointed rooms in London with, I was discovering, a lunatic.
“Alright. Well I don’t have a lot other than my own instincts to go on, but I think that I have found the connection between our victims.”
“John,” he breathes on his lips before kissing him. The kiss is chaste at first but then something seems to switch in John and suddenly there are hands in Sherlock’s hair and a tongue seeking entrance to his mouth. He lets him in and the first brush of tongues against each other has Sherlock thinking maybe there is such a thing as Nirvana. John’s hands are playing with the hem of Sherlock’s shirt and he shivers despite himself. His entire body feels like fire and he wants everything all at once.
“And your speech today it was lovely but Sherlock… did you mean it?” Sherlock tilts his head to the side and tries to read John’s face… self conscious and scared? Ah.
Sherlock clears his throat, “We need to put out an APB on Mark Enlow. Charlie recognized him and he does fit the profile of the killer.” Lestrade finally stops pacing and looks at them, he hasn’t slept and his nails are all bitten to the quick, and that is when Sherlock remembers. Mycroft is flying to North Korea to meet with some leaders about certain political alliances. Sherlock grits his teeth, he still isn’t sure how much Lestrade wants John to know, and since he hasn’t heard from Mycroft yet either, there isn’t much he can offer in terms of reassurance. The best he can do is solve this fucking case so maybe the DI can at least take a nap.
He manages to get a partial fingerprint and as he lifts it as gently as possible he hopes that this victim has at least been in some sort of trouble, otherwise this will turn into a needle in the haystack. He texts Lestrade to let him know and can’t help but smile at the reply.
Sherlock puts his hand on John’s shoulder and squeezes while still reading the rest of the file. He does it almost unconsciously just wanting to offer some support in the horror of what they have to look at. Sherlock sends the name of the uncle to Lestrade asking if it matches the first victim’s name.
John had slowly been walking to Sherlock as he sang and when he finished the last verse, John gently took the violin, set in safely in its case before turning back to Sherlock. “Just for tonight,” John warned before he crushed Sherlock in his arms, it was at this moment that John Watson finally started sobbing.
Oh wow, it's the final chapter. Thank you so much to those of you who have been reading this entire time. Also Mystrade decided they needed a bit more attention than I gave them so be prepared to be hit over the head with that lol. Once again all the gratitude in the world to my beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes.
John groans, pulling at his hair and Sherlock watches him struggle, he is at his wits end and even though Sherlock didn’t ask him to come he still feels guilty. John should be enjoying his wedding night in a room bathed in lights and friends all around. Not in a dark flat with Sherlock worried that he might be using again.
“Because this guy might be a serial killer who has already left three bodies behind and if you don’t want to be the fourth then I suggest…” The guy already has his phone out, navigating to the app. Once he finds what he’s looking for he hands it over to Sherlock.
John is just about to add a third finger when Sherlock half sits up and grabs at his wrist. “No John, now.”
“Are you just going to stand there all night?” Sherlock asks between breathy moans. John is silent as he makes his way towards the bed, he is moving so slowly because he can’t take his eyes off Sherlock for even a moment. When he gets to the end of the bed, and very carefully crawls his way on, he settles himself right between Sherlock’s legs. He puts his hands and Sherlock’s knees and pushes, just the slightest bit, to open him up more.
They start removing the other’s clothes as they stumble their way to the bathroom and Sherlock finds it rather amusing that they are getting completely naked when they haven’t even kissed since the street. John looks at him with a question in his eyes but Sherlock only shakes his head and tosses John’s belt on the kitchen table with a flourish. Once they are in the bathroom they both only have their pants left on, which Sherlock removes while John turns on the water.
John stays in the cab while Sherlock runs inside to change shirts. He really doesn’t think he would be able to keep his hands to himself otherwise as he is still a bit keyed up. All he can think about is the look on Sherlock’s face when he reached out for him. John has been with many people, and yet not one of them has ever looked at him like Sherlock did. The mix of pure terror of the unknown, but also a desire so deep and vast that it could fill the ocean. He’s resting his head against the window of the cab, his fingers touching lightly on his mouth, and his eyes are closed. He wishes this case would end.
“I take it this is alright then,” John chuckles. Sherlock looks up at him with wide wild eyes and seems to have a hard time speaking, John takes pity on him and continues. As John licks at Sherlock, he starts whimpering, making John hazy with lust, he starts rubbing himself on the sheets and moans against Sherlock’s opening.
Sherlock glares at him until John adopts a more serious expression. “I do but I didn’t want your first case back to be quite so complicated.” John looks at him with surprise in his eyes. They don’t speak for the rest of the meal but Sherlock can feel John’s gaze on him heavy like a physical touch.
“This man,” he starts and coughs because his voice keeps giving out. “He looks familiar, he might not be the guy that murdered my mom but I know I have seen him somewhere before.” Sherlock thanks Charlie and praises him.
Angelo already has a table waiting for them, a candle sits in the middle as always. John stopped trying to say that Sherlock isn’t his date because Angelo never listens.
“I know it’s not ideal but it is our best shot and I'm sure Charlie will want to do what he can to put away the man that killed his mother.”
“What the bloody hell, Sherlock? So wait, our serial killer is killing off child abusers. I still want to arrest him but I might just shake his hand first. How in the world did you figure that out?”
“Why are you still dressed?” Sherlock asks husky, with a slight twinge of annoyance in his voice. And oh god it really shouldn’t be as hot as it is. John finds himself taking off his shirt and then Sherlock is sitting up and helping him out of his pants. All their previous exploits have been rushed and they never got entirely naked really just removed the necessary obstacles and went to it. This time is different though, and John feels something in his chest ache at the thought that this is the first time he has seen Sherlock in all his glory. Once all of John’s clothes are off, Sherlock seems to take a minute to just take in the sight of him. John Watson hides a lot under those ridiculous jumpers. The tight muscles in his arms and shoulders are no surprise to Sherlock but the reaction he has to the scar on John’s shoulder is. He feels an ache at seeing it and gently reaches down to lightly brush a kiss against it. He feels such an overwhelming wave of gratitude in that moment that John Watson survived the war and came into his life. When Sherlock pulls back he notices that John is looking at him with his head titled to the side and his brows slightly furrowed. Sherlock leans in to kiss the expression away from him. John kisses him slowly then Sherlock pushes his tongue inside and does this rolling thing that always manages to make John see stars.
“You already know I am John we have talked about this before,” Sherlock replies in his monotone everyone is a idiot except me voice.
Molly greets them cheerfully and seems to notice that John is a little shaken. She brings them tea without a word and Sherlock even manages a small smile at her. She returns it before going back to the blood work she had been studying when they walked in. John has situated himself in one of the chairs near the coolers, he thankfully had the foresight to bring his laptop with him. Sherlock enjoys watching him for a moment as John sets to typing out a new blog post.
They leave soon after and it takes everything in John not to suggest they go back home. There is a burning fear inside his chest and a tightness in his throat that promises to strangle any words he might try to say. Sherlock hails them a cab and John has no idea where they are headed. He thought Barts but it seems as though Sherlock has some kind of a lead. If he isn’t sharing it with John that means he wants to make sure it’s real before telling him about it. John tries not to let it bother him but there is still an old hurt in his chest from the last time Sherlock didn’t tell him something big.
“Come on,” John says rocking up into him and oh fuck that is it. John can tell the moment that Sherlock switches to needing to pound and it will be the first thing that John sees anytime he’s jerking off.
“Hello brother, I need a favor. Look into Mary and see who the hell she cheated on John with and then I want you to enact protocol 5.”
“Fuck Sherlock, I’m…” and that is all the he manages to get out before Sherlock feels wetness between his fingers and on his cock. He groans and moves faster prolonging John’s pleasure and then fuck he’s there too.
“I want you to fuck me.” Sherlock said this mainly to the sheet wrapped around his body, but he was glancing at John in his peripherals. John was a bit of a loss as to what he should say. Thankfully what Sherlock had asked for didn’t really require speech. John moved slowly until he was kneeling in front of Sherlock, he used his hand to tip Sherlock’s face to look at him. He stared into that smoldering gaze searching to see if there was any fear or doubt in it. “Are you sure?”
“Does it have to do with why you left early?” Sherlock doesn’t trust his voice at this point so he just nods and waits for John to ask something else.
“Yeah, but John I can’t give you children, or any semblance of a normal life, or even a home.” John’s heart is breaking just to hear Sherlock think that any of those things actually matter. He tilts that gorgeous head up and smiles.
“Yes, well, that’s Mycroft’s line not mine. Maybe I bought into that for a long time but not anymore. John, you make me stronger. I couldn’t do any of this without you.” John can feel the tears threatening to well up in his eyes, because this keeps sounding more and more like a love confession. Sherlock brushes his fingers against John’s cheeks and he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is desperately in love with this man. He doesn’t say it though, only because he would rather show it.
Suddenly Sherlock is incapable of breathing or speaking, the armchair would be something easily explained, it was irrevocably John’s and he probably thought that Sherlock just used it as a stand in for him when he needed to think which while not wrong also isn’t the entire story. He manages to stand up and walk over to the door of his bedroom, he turns his head to look at John who has made his way into the kitchen.
“Of course I’ll have you John Watson. You don’t even need to ask.” Sherlock says and then he kisses him.
“What’s the point? You must have already figured out everything possible about it, while I was talking to Charlie.”
John takes all of this in, with that awareness he gets when Sherlock is being brilliant, but there is one thing wrong: John has tears in his eyes.
“John, you know that I am not the type of person to regret my actions. Why should I when I think through every single logical solution and only go for the one that makes the most sense and causes the least amount of pain? But if there is one thing in my life that I truly regret it’s letting you think I was dead. The way you mourned me and the hell it put you through. If there was anything I could do, anyway to take it back, don't think for a single second I wouldn’t do it.” John looks dumbstruck, his eyes are as wide as they can go and his mouth is slightly open. Sherlock has the urge to take a picture, and he would if this wasn’t such a serious moment.
Sherlock has finally coaxed John’s tongue into his mouth and now is sucking on it in a way that has his cock saluting. John can feel a grin trying to break out on Sherlock’s face and it is so frustrating that someone who claims everything is transport can be so fucking good at making him lose his damn mind.
“Of course I don’t, you can keep it if you like I can always grab another one.” And oh is Sherlock tempted to let him do that, but he doesn’t need to, he has John back and in the flesh now. Sleeping with his pillow because it smells like him while John is in the flat feels a bit creepy. Sherlock walks into his bedroom and grabs the pillow, all but throwing it at John so he’s not tempted to take one last little smell of it. John catches it quite easily giving Sherlock a small smile that just about stops him in his tracks, but Sherlock is determined to act as though everything is normal. He strides into the kitchen, grabbing a travel mug out of the cupboard and setting it on the counter next to John.
“I want to see you,” Sherlock says. John nods understanding immediately. He begins to move again, fucking Sherlock’s hand and still shuddering as their cocks slide together inside the tight heat of his grip. Sherlock is so turned on that he thinks he might just faint from want. Or at least he would if he weren’t already laying down on the ground.
This chapter was rough on the writing side thanks so much to my lovely beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes for keeping me sane
Frustrated with the usual pitfalls of shower sex, Sherlock bends to whisper in John’s ear, “Bed now.” John’s entire body shakes and Sherlock has never been more thankful for his voice than in that moment.
“I don’t know handsome, but if you need me to do some things for you… well let’s just say I wouldn’t charge.” Sherlock wants to laugh, or scream, honestly at this point either seems to be a strong possibility. He can feel the temptation to look over at John and gauge his reaction, but knowing that it probably would just be mild irritation he holds back.
He never really had a partner before that he could truly let himself go with, therefore he normally liked to stay in control, so it is a little bit of a shock to see the very enthusiastic response his body has to John taking charge. John smiles at him in the most wicked way that Sherlock has ever seen. He leans in, and Sherlock starts to close his eyes…  which fly quickly open again when he feels teeth pulling, none too gently, at his nipple. John looks incredibly pleased with himself, and Sherlock is getting rather annoyed about it. He reaches around the back of John’s neck and brings their lips together.
Oh fuck. This is what kissing is supposed to feel like; as if your entire soul is being sucked out of your body. John knew Sherlock would be good at this, the man can literally deduce anything about anyone - including the fact that John really likes it when a someone does… fuck… that!
“Actually, you presume wrong Dr. Watson. Your partner took off after Mark, name’s Ed.” The man on the ground looks smug for someone practically kissing the gravel. John suddenly feels the anxious pit in his stomach rear up so fast it takes an enormous effort to keep down his breakfast.
John will never admit to it, will protect this little bit of himself and his more questionable actions to his dying day, but when he thought Sherlock was dead, he would lie down in this bed with his face buried in a pillow that still held a small bit of the detective’s scent. The fact that he would wake up in that bed harder than he could ever remember being should have been a tip off, but John’s head had been in a fog so thick nothing could pierce through it. Thinking on it now, he figures his heart and mind had worked together to keep him sane. If he had realized that he was in love with Sherlock Holmes back when the man was supposedly dead, John wouldn’t be here with the man now.
“Yes, but that’s not all. The two crates by the couch are even older files. I have put our suspect’s age around 25-30. I am betting that he is a past victim of sexual abuse and we might be able to find his identity in those files.”
The water in the shower is still hot enough to slightly burn when it hits their skin. John smiles because, as annoying as it is having Sherlock deduce him, there are certain perks to it. Sherlock knows things about him such as the perfect placement of a teacup so that he can reach it when working but not knock it over. He knows that John needs the reassurance that he is alive but he never comments on it. In so many ways Sherlock gives him exactly what he needs and he realizes that this is how a relationship should work. That train of thought is depressing in a way because it is obvious, now that he thinks about it, that he has been in a relationship with Sherlock for years.
“I just, I want you too…” He trails off because he isn’t quite sure how to put it into words. Sherlock must read it on his face though because the eyebrows are almost reaching the hair line and Sherlock’s eyes are so damn wide.
John felt incredibly strange walking up the familiar steps to the flat but knowing this time that Sherlock was inside, breathing and whole. He used his old keys to get in and was welcomed by the sound of a soft sad melody that Sherlock was playing on the violin. For a moment John let himself close his eyes and listen.
John’s not breathing, he stopped when Sherlock snapped the belt. He can just imagine being spread out over the man’s lap naked from the waist down. He never likes to admit it but there is a small part of him that aches to relinquish control and just to let someone do with him as they will. But he has never trusted anyone enough at least not until now, and damn, it’s suddenly all he wants. He snaps back to the present and Sherlock is moving towards him, a fire burning in his eyes. John can feel flames on his skin and he has never in his life felt this alive. When Sherlock reaches him, his hands immediately go to the bottom of John’s jumper to pull it off. John’s hands catch his and Sherlock looks at him confused.
Sherlock groans as he recognizes the line as his own. Sometimes he thinks he has created a monster but most of the time he’s… proud.
“By choice,” Sherlock says in amazed disgust, and it is rather an awful name but still not even close to the damn point.
“John,” it was all he could manage as the pace was sped up and he found himself reaching for John’s cock, as soon as he made contact John whimpered in a way that broke Sherlock’s heart. Sherlock knew they would both be coming soon and he had no idea what would happen after so he pulled John towards him holding him in a bear hug as he thrust a few more times and stilled. John made no attempt to move off, and Sherlock wrapped his hand back around his cock and gave it a few elegant strokes John was coming in moments screaming Sherlock’s name like it was a curse and a prayer.
“Who did you write that song for?” Sherlock looks at him incredulously. He has the same look on his face when John does something spectacularly stupid and it is rather annoying. Sherlock doesn’t even try to respond, moving instead to his bedroom and disappearing for a while. John tries not to get aggravated after all he has been living with Mary for a long time and he can admit he hasn’t been a great friend. Maybe something happened while he was off living the domestic life and Sherlock doesn’t want to talk about it. Still there is a slight twinge in his chest when he thinks about the possibility of there being something so big that he doesn’t know about Sherlock. John heaves a heavy sigh of one going off to war before shooting off a quick text to the devil himself.
“Greg, alright?” John knows he’s not, can see he’s not, but it is more the act of asking it so that Sherlock has a moment to deduce Lestrade’s state and hopefully adjust his harsh tone accordingly. Even though he loves to deny it, John knows that the DI is one of the only people in the world that Sherlock considers a friend and he wouldn’t want to purposely hurt him.
“Sherlock, I don’t really care for kids, we both know that I am shit at normal life, and most importantly you are my home. Whenever you are that is where I want to be. Alright?”
“Hmm?” He finally brings his eyes to Sherlock’s face and his whole body is snapped back into awareness. Sherlock looks more unsure than John has ever seen him and he finds himself across the room and gripping Sherlock’s arms tightly.
“Sherlock you won’t hurt me. Just fucking move.” He does, he pulls almost all the way out and slams back in with such force that it almost feels as though he’s reaching all the way into John’s head. It feels so good, Sherlock of course has pinpointed the exact location of his prostate and he is hitting it relentlessly. Sherlock’s hand is suddenly on his cock and John’s knows he's going to come like a shot.
“Holy fuck,” John says, his hair is wet, little droplets of water run down his chest and Sherlock would lick him dry if he wasn’t otherwise occupied. The look that John is giving him is something that Sherlock will never forget, even if he didn’t have a mind palace to store the memory in. John’s jaw is slack, his eyes are wide, and he is looking at Sherlock like he is everything he’s ever dreamed of, on a silver platter.
This chapter was the first one I found really difficult. So thank you to my beta from keeping me from losing my mind @SherlockWatson_Holmes
Lestrade is waiting on the sidewalk when they pull up, and John can tell this case is taking its toll on DI, if the dark circles under his eyes are anything to go by. The pure relief on his face when he spots them is enough to make John cut Sherlock off before he can even start demanding things.
John slowly started to calm as Sherlock held him tightly rubbing soothing circles on his lower back. When he pulled back from Sherlock it felt almost as if lighting had struck. They moved towards each other so quickly, teeth clashed, shirts were torn in the rush to get them off. Flesh met flesh, Sherlock guided them over to John’s armchair where he sat down bringing John with him, straddling his lap. John kissed his way down Sherlock’s neck to his chest where he slowly played with each nipple. Sherlock was moaning softly, but put a hand to stop John before he could continue his quest south.
“That isn’t your fault, you saw something awful that day and your mind was trying to protect you from it. We need your help Charlie, we are trying to find the man who killed your mother.” Sherlock pauses letting the boy process that and John can’t help but marvel at the patience that Sherlock exhibits sometimes. This is the same man who will shoot the wall up at the flat just because he’s bored, and yet here he is.
"John", Sherlock all but screams and he’s so far gone that he doesn’t even spare a thought about Mrs. Hudson hearing them. He comes for so long that it almost seems as though it will never end and that this is how Sherlock Holmes will finally die. Coming inside John Watson for eternity, damn good way to go. It finally must subside though and when he blinks his eyes open he finds John staring at him, the softest smile on his face. Sherlock pulls out as slowly as he can manage and grabs a washcloth that he keeps in his bedside table. He cleans John first making sure to be as thorough as possible before giving himself a courtesy swipe. He nudges his way onto John’s chest and hums when he feels a hand in his hair.
“I figured it would be easier for me to come here and get your detailed statements for the case since Greg is let’s just say indisposed for the rest of the day.” And oh no, Mycroft’s lips twitch in a slight smirk when he finishes and John cannot handle bloody Mycroft talking in innuendo. Sherlock’s face is paling rather remarkably and that just makes John’s decision easier.
Sherlock is cursing himself loudly and repeatedly at least in his own mind. He knows that while, yes he did just keep John from having a panic attack, he has in a way shown his hand. Sherlock isn’t supposed to know about the panic attacks, about the figure that appears in his rooms on the few nights that he does try to sleep, or the fact that John Watson still wakes up screaming his name as though the fall is happening all over again. Of course he knows though he is Sherlock bloody Holmes and it’s not like John is particularly subtle about it. He has, quite literally, stopped speaking mid sentence just to feel for Sherlock’s pulse. Maybe John thinks him so inadequate at sentiment that he will think John is just being a conscientious doctor/friend. Sherlock is so frustrated with the whole damn thing that he almost wants to call off the rest of the day. However, Charlie’s face swims before his eyes and he forces himself to block out everything that isn’t about the case. He will have plenty of time for their personal issues after the work is over.
“No-one who would be silly enough to send me a silly card, anyway,” he continued, tucking his legs up and under him, and clasping his ankles.  “Unless Mrs. Hudson finally goes completely doolally.”
“How simply glorious,” he replied.  “'Bugalugs' must have taken a fancy to you.  Now, which asylum would you prefer I place you into?”
“But just imagine possessing a collection of skulls,” I said, shivering.  “How morbid.  Enough to give a fellow nightmares.”
He shrugged dramatically, as if the thought was too much trouble, and the voicing of the thought even more wearisome.  He scowled towards the doilies.  He advanced upon the sideboard and stretched out a hand to dab at one.
I rove my hand under and onto his chest.  The soft tickle of hair and the strong beat of his heart.  I trace down to his stomach, then down to--
“You do not recall sending the skull, with a written message, to your cousin Eugene Dawkins, at his shop near Pall Mall?”
He eased himself away and off the bed.  Affecting a demureness that served to make me thrice as hard, he shucked off his braces, and so slowly – as if time itself had ceased – removed his shirt.  He stopped to look at me again.
Holmes had the decency to blush.  He leaned to scrabble at his bootlace.  “I don't know,” he said.  “Watson, you're very bold.”
“You must remember,” I said, yawning.  “When we stayed at your brother Ulysses's house.  You came into my room, and--”
Well, there is someone I must visit near Pall Mall, a little later on.  I have some letters I must write.  I must read the papers once you've finished them – the agony column of
I looked at my friend there on the sill, seated beside me.  I was not sure what I should say or do.  My impulse was to throttle him, but I am, I think, a gentleman.  “Holmes,” I said.  “You are an idiot.”
I froze.  Something very terrible must obviously be happening.  “What?” I whispered, fair alarmed.  “Is there a spider in my hair?”
Holmes burst into the room, all flailing arms and spraying raindrops.  Coat and hat and scarf were jettisoned; the gloves were tossed upon the sofa, where Holmes rejoined them seconds later.  He slumped there in spreadeagle, head thrown back and eyes tight shut.
When I returned a little later, the sitting-room was peaceful.  The curtains had been drawn, the fire was blazing, and the table set for tea.  My friend was leafing through the yellowback novel I had left upon my chair arm.
I read the paper as I walked.  Some minor scandal as regards a member of parliament, the Hon. Cole Ramsey, held my attention all the way to Scotland Yard.  A misting drizzle had begun as I ducked through the door, and on through the long corridors to where I had to be.  I shook my hat, removed my coat, and thought of Toby as I shuffled through my paperwork.  Two months or more we'd been a pair – if you could call it that – if random trysts could count; if weekend nights and days might tally also; sex, and mainly that, with no complaint.  It had happened very suddenly; in fact, I had despaired of ever finding any solace of that nature, so precarious I thought it, notwithstanding my escapades in my old regiment – but those were different times, of course.  Now throttled up in suits and ties and bowler hats, life seemed a jot more complicated.
He was sitting at the window, looking down into the street, smoking a cigarette.  His profile was extraordinary: angled, lean, intense; I sensed the grace within the coil.  I watched him then, for half a minute, even longer, whereupon all of a sudden he exhaled a lengthy sigh, and turned his head.
The next morning, in my room, a rasping snore inside my ear.  I twisted free of its embrace, and stood, regarding Toby stretched there in the bed, asleep.
I listened, quite enchanted, as he expounded.  I had never heard him wax as poetic.  I was in awe.  He stopped to examine it closely again.
The latter chapter seemed to me well-thumbed.  I put down the book, my mood depressed.  I set myself to thinking of all the times of late that Holmes had seemed distracted and remote.  I prayed that he had not relapsed...
“I compose, from time to time,” said he, looking very pleased.  “Oh John, I wish that you were musical, and that you played piano.  I would buy one, just for you, and then we'd play duets each evening...”  He drifted off into a reverie, a smile upon his face.
He took a piece of toast and stabbed it with a curl of butter.  He paused to scratch his leg, smearing his trousers as he did so.  He shifted in his seat; he shook his shoulders, set his jaw.
“Holmes, you told me earlier that the village would know nothing.”  – I paused to mop my forehead, as the sun shone down, relentless.  –   “Why did you say that, and how do you know?”
I hovered in the doorway, still unsettled and distressed.  “Not specifically, but, oh, Holmes, if you had heard the man... it was quite dreadful.  Should I have a word with Mrs. Oaks later this evening?”
Merrill Adams and the dapper Mr. Dooley had just seated at a table.  Adams waved as I passed by.  I went and sat with them.
Whereupon the esoteric Mr. Sloan sprang from his seat, and commenced to leap with flailing arms and wet umbrella and nodding head towards my friend.
“Oh,” said she, “well, that's me done for.”  And she cackled like a raven.  “No, no, my sirs, I'm all in jest.  Do go on, Mr. Holmes.”
He set it aside, and slit open the second with the blade of his pocket-knife.  Scanning the contents, he let out a low chuckle.
with which to weigh it down?”  He smiled and touched my hand.  “You choose.  You have good taste, apparently.”
“I still have some running around,” he informed me, with a touch to my arm.  “Go on home, I shall join you as soon as I can.”
“Miss Alice has a problem with her brother,” said my friend.  “Tell me, Watson, what do you think of Joel Dooley?”
My eye was fixed upon the... something... that was dangling from the ceiling in the centre of the room.
I remember, still, the way in which Holmes had said those words, upon some case or the other, and how my heart sank deep into my boots at hearing them.
– more frequently these three days than at any time the past year.  “Holmes, wait.  What will Mycroft
“The killer must have taken it with him.  We found nothing here to match the wounds.  The weapon used was a large one with a thin and broad blade.”
“Thank you, James,” I said.  “It's very nice.”  I tipped him lightly for his trouble, closed the door, and set about a short unpack.  I chose the bed nearest the window, and set my books and things beside it.  I hung my clothes inside the wardrobe, and my toiletries upon the marble wash stand.
I dare say that if you, the reader, found yourself with Holmes's backside at your disposal, you might not stop either; and I am a man who finds temptation somewhat difficult.
“Pay them no mind,” my friend said pleasantly.  “Now, it is true I have no knowledge of the tarot, as you say.  If my name was not discussed, then I wish you might expound upon your theory.  Otherwise it's wild conjecture, as I'm sure you would agree.”
His face roiled in a horror.  “Good lord, no.  I work with Scotland Yard quite often, and with private clients rather more.  I am,” he said, with some degree of pride, “a consulting detective.”
I offered the plate.  He snatched one at random and bit into it sharply.  I waited while he chewed, until his brows relaxed their tangle.
I rallied, finally.  On the seventh day I took a bath and shaved, and dressed myself and went downstairs to face the morning and my friend, should he not be
“I can't exactly join you at the window, John, so you'll have to theorise alone.  Is he looking up?”
“You are very welcome.”  The old man rose up from his stool and, clutching a dust-cloth, limped across to a glass cabinet and set to polishing its front.
I moved across.  I jutted up against him, teasing, promising, but immotile.  “You will have to do better than that.  You will beg.”
I gulped for air, and I had never known a torture to be so fine or more exquisite, as we stood there on the rug, entwined and merging into one.
“But that is not all,” my friend continued.  “It all appears a little strange.  But Victor has gabbled on so as regards his late aunt, that I am unsure how wholly embellished or precisely bizarre this affair stands to be.”
“If there were any possibility of that, his tarot reader would have told him.  Ha!  Well, that's enough.  Don't look so mournful, John.  Oh, for goodness sake, don't tell me that the subject interests you?”
.  In fact, I hope some day to make my record of the two and of my friend's ingenious brain-work to bring the guilty to the bar.
He laughed.  “Well, I recall I said the same not long ago; yet here we are.”  He cocked his head.  “I want to know.”
I couldn't last; did he expect me to?  A dozen hip-tight thrusts into his core, and I was roaring my release as he came juddering beneath me.
“Well then, now I shall be honest, as you asked, and tell my story,” he replied.  “And heaven help the pair of us.”  He leaned forward in his chair then, and I did the same in mine, and we were but just two feet apart and yet a world away.
.  This is what I have discovered.  Mrs. Barker is a widow.  Her late husband passed away five years ago from a liver complaint, whereupon the lady, in her loneliness, moved back into her rooms here at Peregrine Way.  Mr. Talmadge was happy to have her, she informs me.  She retains no close family, only a remote cousin by the name of Eugene Dawkins, of whom she had little enough to say.  Regarding the names in Talmadge's address book, she was able to tell me a little about each of the men.  Regrettably, Mrs. Barker was unable to suggest which of the four – if any – might have visited that night.  I must make my own enquiries in that direction.  She does not know if there was a third key that existed for the study.  Talmadge had no intimate acquaintance that she knew of.  He was retired, but was writing an historical novel – his first.  Mrs. Barker, as it transpires, appears afraid of the jasper skull, saying it 'gives her the willies' just to look at it.  What a dreadful phrase.  She has no idea as to its value.  At which point in the interview, alas, she began to weep again and simply would not shut up.  So I extended my condolences and made a swift exit.  And so, Watson, here we are.”
“We are staying at the Burroughs' gables,” said my friend conversationally.  “How beautiful the gardens are these days!  I don't suppose that you know the name of the fellow who worked there?”
.  The looping script at once familiar; a cavalcade of memory.  I turned them over in my hands.  I looked at Holmes.
He interrupted me a second time.  “I'm equally at fault.  I should know better than to fling myself around upon the carpet.  I've alarmed more people than I'd like upon that score.  I remember once at college--”
“I really am very sorry,” he said.  “I say things without thinking.”  His face was flushed a dark red.
Sunday morning, with a blue sky and pale sunshine, crisp and clear.  I hurried breakfast, put a lead onto my dog, and set off walking in the general direction of the park.  The air was bracing, and it helped to clear my head of all the thoughts that had so clogged it in the night: the confrontation with Tobias, and the epiphany with Holmes.  The latter made me smile; the former less so.  How might I prove my new intent to Holmes?  How would he be receptive?  Would he appreciate my subtlety, or better I be frank?  We were grown men, not gawky lads, all thumbs and elbows.  “Come on now, Max,” I said, “let's detour; he'll be home, he has to be.”
The lady's mouth was in a tremor; her chin in pucker as if she might once more return to her lament.
The maid blinked, surprised, at her name being recalled.  A shy smile overtook her, although the bottom lip quivered.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes,” my friend said, smiling, “and this man here is Dr. John Watson, who has already spent half his wallet here this morning and now returns for a second bout.”  To appreciative laughter, Holmes continued: “You all seem very taken with this emporium.  Might I ask what holds you here?”
“I feel we should be honest with each other,” I said slowly, “if we are to live together in close quarters such as this.  I also feel that I can trust you, as Stamford spoke so highly of you, and I should hope you might afford me the same confidence in time.”  I hesitated, for Holmes's brows had knit, and his mouth had downturned into a strange grimace that alarmed me.  “Perhaps I say too much,” I added softly, in embarrassment.
Holmes drew a breath.  “There is no reason.”  He shook his head clear of a thought.  He reached a hand towards me, and I drew the closer to him, propping an elbow on the counterpane.  I grazed and nibbled at his lips.  I smoothed the crease out of his brow.  He sighed and squirmed into the mattress.
It turned out, in fact, we had.  Our nearest rivals had been Uncle Rufus and Aunt Rufina, who carried nine.
We drank coffee, milky sweet, then left the dining room to smoke a pipe or two outside again.  Mycroft was heading down the staircase as we did so.  He regarded us with something fair akin to broad amusement – but then his face snapped straight again, and he was greeting us good morning.  He disappeared into the dining room for breakfast.
“Impressive,” I said honestly.  “I'd say you have a genius for detail.  It was wonderful to watch you.”
I told him something of my own youth, not painting over my more dubious adventures.  For although they were now firmly in the past, I felt that Holmes would want to know; to arbitrate that I was honest and sincere.  He listened patiently, attentive to my rambling.  “I like your hands,” he said.  I stopped, looked down, examined them, confused.  “They're strong and capable,” said he.  “They should be smaller, for the size of you.”
Holmes smoothed his hair back from his forehead in a nervous, fractious gesture.  “In a manner of speaking.
“I knew it,” he said, smiling.  “From your bearing, and your jacket cuffs.  They're frayed,” he added, helpfully.  “As are the laces on your boots.”
“I suppose the rug will be replaced,” I said.  “It's covered with acid burns.  And the lampshade is full of dents.”  I looked at Holmes sternly.  “Your fault.”
And, of course, to have each other when we liked and how we liked, and quite as loudly as we wanted.
Watson, madam,” I said, nodding, with a smile.  “And I suppose we might?  I really could not tell you?”
The cold and bitter morning woke us well before six-thirty.  We wrapped our blankets high and heavy, and smoked a cigarette together.
But now – the day – ahead of us.  And groaning, we roll out and off and up, clean up the havoc, and proceed towards the stairs.
to borrow it in the first instance.  At least the constable has gone, but now I wonder where Lestrade is?”
“We might have made some story up, I don't know what, some fabrication.  But it was too late, and Martha sickened worse, and then... and then, you know what happened, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, sir.”
Spencer pulled the front door smartly shut.  We watched him as he fumbled with his key, and then start to stride away towards the town.  He looked back and snapped his fingers in impatience.  He whistled loudly.
“Well, he's engaging, at the very least,” said Stamford with a grin.  “He clams up tight at Bart's.  Ha!  If he wasn't so damned
He had thrown himself back into his chair.  “Why, yes,” he said airily, “it has wrapped up very nicely.  And all thanks to Mr. Dawkins and his pendant.  Lestrade was grateful.  And so he should be.”
We looked into each other's eyes, and found our truth.  My head swam with the joy of it; I couldn't care a tuppence for the past, for we were here now, in the present, and the future seemed a most exciting thing.
There are at least a dozen things that I wish to do to him this minute.  Ten of which involve my tongue.
The seagulls spinning circles, landing soft upon the shingle.  The cresting waves striking the shore, the smell, the sound, the bracing atmosphere.  I wished that Holmes might have been with me to enjoy this special moment.  I dug my hands into my pockets, burrowed down into my scarf, and watched the grey sea dance its waltz and listened to it sing its song.
Happy New Year to you all, I hope 2019 is kind to you and brings you lots of great times and quality Johnlock fic!
An urgent knocking disrupts his panic. He opens the door to find a three-piece suit holding together a breathless man.
Leaving Sherlock with the case file, Lestrade stomped down the stairs, hoping he’s at least helped a little. Sherlock hadn’t let him stay for a drink, becoming scornful at the idea, and demanding to be left alone. A lonely evening at home for the police detective, then.
Writing the texting section of this chapter was one of those dream experiences you have as a writer, when the words write themselves and you’re just the one hitting the keys. I only planned for them to exchange a couple of texts, but the boys had other ideas and didn’t want the conversation to end.
Sherlock’s face was glowing with pride, and he grinned at John, a silent thanks for his help. He couldn’t see how this had happened, but somehow he was useful to this incredibly intelligent man. As a team they solved cases twice as fast, with John being a more cooperative assistant than Sherlock seemed to be used to, a sounding-board for his astonishing thought processes. And the way Sherlock smiled at him when he’d helped solve a case… that was more than enough reward. With Sherlock, his heart pounded, his throat went dry and he found it hard not to laugh out loud - and Sherlock, too, seemed to share this dizzying happiness. They made an excellent team and revelled in the warm glow of their successes together, and John had to admit, though he was surrounded by gruesome murders most of the time, it was the happiest he’d ever felt.
“Hmm. I hope so. He suffers more than he shows. He always has.” They share a look. Their mutual affection for the detective sat alone upstairs is obvious. Lestrade hasn’t really felt like he could talk to anyone about Sherlock; the force always mocked him, and though John was always there, the daft idiot never realised he was in love with the man which made it difficult for them to have an unbiassed discussion.
Wait. That didn’t tally with Sherlock’s deductions. “More? John, I… I want you to stay. You’re my only friend, better than a friend. I’ll be sorry to see you go.”
He pushed open the battered door of the greasy all-night café. A high pitched bell tinkled somewhere above his head.
They finally drew apart as John’s phone began to ping angrily. He pulled the phone from his pocket, reluctant to take his eyes of Sherlock’s face, which carried a loving heat directed at John.
His sentence was punctuated by a punch in the stomach, by the leader of the group, Charlie. “Don’t you dare call my mum mental! What the hell is wrong with you?!” His face, this time. His vision blurred and he staggered backwards.
So, this man. Sherlock Holmes. He’d met him once, googled his name, read his website - but basically, a complete stranger. On the other hand, he’d definitely made an impression on John, he couldn’t deny that. He’d replayed their conversation over and over in his mind, and those extraordinary powers of mind-reading, or whatever that trick was, astonished him every time. Not only that; he was unable to stop thinking about the way the man had held himself with such confidence, his calm, logical, yet ridiculous way of speaking, and his charming manner. He gazed, he smiled, he winked - at John, the old man with the limp! He had no idea what to expect from Sherlock next, and found this uncertainty through a rush of excitement somewhere deep within him.
They passed down a few more streets, towards Hackney. Another break-in site. Sighing with exasperation, Sherlock showed him on a map where the crime scenes were, marked with red crosses across east London.
He was so absorbed in this cheerful prospect that he almost bumped right into Mycroft on the pavement outside 221B, getting out of an obscenely posh car.
Night was falling outside the bedroom window. Sherlock sat at his computer, John vaguely to his left. As he scrolled through various sites, a new wave of boredom hit him, making him swivel around on his desk chair in restlessness.
“Why wouldn’t I avoid you, Charlie? Whenever I come near you, you get your friends to attack me. I would think that the logical course of action would be to stay away. Plus there’s your frankly awful smell of body odour. Maybe your mother should’ve told
Not expecting a reply, he switches his phone off and spends the rest of the wait trying to get some sleep.
“You’re a bloody idiot, Sherlock. You just throw yourself into danger without thinking. You’ll end up killing yourself!”
“In… in love? So, you aren’t moving out because you’ve had enough of me, but because you are… you have… feelings?” Sherlock blinked. He’d stopped dead in his tracks, and his mind was spinning. “Who are you falling in love with? Why haven’t I met her?” John wasn’t seeing anyone, that he knew of. Was he now hiding his girlfriends from Sherlock, the world’s only consulting cockblock?
He did want John to be happy though, above everything. So he was doing his best not to be… himself. He tried to give them their space and let their relationship give John the fulfilment that Sherlock could never show him. If Mary made John happy, Sherlock would let them be happy. He just couldn’t watch it happening. Not when he was so helplessly miserable.
The bell rang, signalling the end of the school day. Sherlock grabbed his things and shoved them into his messy backpack. It was easier to get away if he was quick.
Sherlock Holmes is used to standing out like a sore thumb, but it’s usually because he’s covered in pig’s blood or smells of methane. He doesn’t mind being noticeable when his appearance is unusual for the setting. Here, however, he stands out merely because of his age, and the absence of a MacBook and expensive non-prescription glasses. Perhaps he isn’t as groomed at put together as he usually is, but does coffee really necessitate clean clothes and tidy hair? Ridiculous.
Sherlock was sulking. Nothing new there. John wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that he was actually a little hurt by Sherlock’s lack of interest in the fact that he was leaving the country for a week, but he had to admit to himself that it hurt. It wasn’t really a surprise; Sherlock had been very distant since his and Mary’s wedding last weekend. His texts hadn’t been answered, and Sherlock had been out the couple of times he’d called round to Baker Street. It seemed like now John was settled in a marriage, Sherlock had decided that he was too old, or to boring to be included in his wild, exciting life. He wouldn’t even meet John’s eye as he and Mary said fond goodbyes to Mrs Hudson and discussed the weather in the south of France at this time of year and where they were staying and their flight arrangements. Sherlock was tuning it all out, John knew him well enough to know that. He was in his mind palace, off thinking something through, in some memory or strand of reasoning. Sherlock had stopped even pretending to listen, his back to John and Mary, looking out onto the street below. His shoulders were stiff.
Charlie's name is inspired by Charles Augustus Magnussen, because I couldn't think of a name and so I thought I'd take one from canon, although their characters aren't really similar.
With a slight growl, the knife-wielder pounced. The darkness was an advantage to Sherlock, which he desperately needed, as his bluff would be revealed if she hit her target and seriously wounded the boy. He dodged her first blow, receiving a scratch to his forearm instead of the intended chest wound.
“Good to meet you in person. Although if you’re here to see Sherlock, I don’t think he’s gonna have the same response. He’s… not in the mood for visitors.”
Towering blocks of council flats surrounded the boy now, but he was tall and not afraid. He wasn’t alone, not when he had John. And anyway, these days Sherlock felt he had very little to lose, so he had no cause for fear. He was safe from anything hurting him as long as he kept everything locked up in his head. Any feelings he had were shared only with John.
“Please, tell me you’re joking.” Mycroft passes a hand over his face. “That’s where the Watsons are having dinner.”
John feels deflated, embarrassed by his outburst. It betrayed too much, showed too clearly how Sherlock still reigned powerful in his thoughts. He has to be more careful, that was a dangerous mistake. If this is going to work between them, he must try harder. “I’m sorry Mary, my love. You’re right, as usual. I think I might just be tired. I was just thinking about Sherlock because he texted me earlier.”
“I’m happy for you boys, finally sorting things out! Let me get you some tea, shall I?” She smiles at him optimistically, hoping they’ve reached some sort of delicate truce.
“Government cars busy. Speed essential.” Mycroft’s breath is returning as he takes a seat on Lestrade’s sofa. “Answer question. Nice case or
“At the point you nearly impale me on your umbrella, you’ve earned the right to call me Greg,” Lestrade replied with a chuckle.
“And their right to privacy…? Ah, screw it, it’s not like Sherlock worries about that shit with me and the force. What are they both doing tomorrow?”
“Coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Something pulls those two together, no matter how far they splinter away. A thread of fate links them. I have no doubt they will return to eachother in the end.”
In a couple of minutes he could see Angelo’s across the street, and allowed himself to slow a little to catch his breath.
John glanced out of the window again, and saw them pass the famous advertising screens and cherub statue of Piccadilly Circus roundabout. The gentle turning motion of the cab caused the sleeping detective to fall against his shoulder. The familiarity of London and the man gently resting on his shoulder gave him all the warmth and comfort of a home he hadn’t realised he’d been seeking. Sherlock trusted John totally in that moment, and John finally understood what should have been obvious all along.
Lestrade had let himself in when his knocks weren’t answered, and sat down on the sofa, putting the case file on the coffee table. Sherlock knows he’s there to give him a case, yet doesn’t show any of the usual signs of interest, replying only in grunts. He does perk up a bit when Lestrade begins to outline the details of the case;
“You are even more of an idiot than I ever could have suspected, John Watson.” And then Sherlock kissed him. It was just a nervous touch of lips, quick, unsure. But the moment their lips parted it seemed as natural as breathing to bring them back together, learning the geography of eachothers’ mouths, their lips blossoming with warmth after being exposed for so long to the cold winter breeze.
Darkness falling outside the bedroom window, he sat in his mind palace for a little while, sorting out memories of John. He tried to forget every detail he could about the wedding and the sex holiday and their flat full of new kitchen appliances and clean tabletops. He shook his head. Only insignificant details like dates and locations could be deleted; his head still drowns in the memory of John’s tender eyes on Mary in her dress, his hand on Sherlock’s knee in the drunken haze of the stag night,
Sherlock wandered along the dark street, barely noticing the cold. He spouted deductions about passers-by to John as he walked, enjoying the feeling of freedom from the captivity of his small suburban home. Angelo’s all-night café was in a much rougher area of the city – much more interesting to Sherlock. Criminals crawled the Greenwood estate’s streets at night. His parents didn’t like him going over there, but they always had been a touch overprotective. His snoozing, upmarket estate, Welford, was much safer. Much more
“It is when I don’t have one, because I spend all my bloody time worrying about what you might do next. You have no idea!”
The taxi passed through Mile End as the two passengers sat in silence, Sherlock deep in thought, John watching the city pass by out of the window.
Lestrade hasn’t had a great day, and the idea of a pint on his sofa with some crap telly is the only thing that’s kept him sane the last few hours. Sighing with relief at the familiar feeling of leather supporting his tired body, he pulls out his phone for a quick scroll through Facebook. Two cousins of his seem to be having a heated political debate in the comments of some article -
John turned to Sherlock, to see what he made of the scene - no doubt he had a head full of deductions from the scene he would love to unburden on an impressed listener. But a surprise met John’s eyes; Sherlock was silent and still, his head nodding, his eyelids drooping. They had been on a stake-out for hours, and of course, Sherlock hadn’t slept before, in case it slowed down his mental processes. Mental being the correct word for him, probably, John thought, shaking his head.
“Have you… have you ever wanted to..? With a man?” It was barely a whisper. Sherlock was sure John hadn’t heard him until he got a reply.
John’s teasing tone was really starting to get on Sherlock’s nerves. He had no interest in Molly, the timid forensic science first year, but she certainly seemed to have an interest in him. She always just happened to be in the morgue when he was there, trying to think. He had no patience with her. She slowed things down.
The door tinkled softly open, and Sherlock looked round, suddenly alert. Why was this man following him?
“Of course! And you may use it as much as you like, my dearest Sherlock! And any food or drink, on the house!” Sherlock followed Angelo behind the counter to a small sink. He could still see the customers from here. He could still see the blonde man.
Bundled in a hundred layers on a bitingly cold morning in early December, John felt the rumble of an unnatural monster beneath his thighs propelling him towards an ominous fate. The rumble, of course, was a cab, and the ominous fate a week-long pre-Christmas family gathering at his parents’ house. He’d hailed the cab from outside 221B after an hour spent trying to appease a grouchy Sherlock, before he’d given it up as a lost cause. The man was indecipherable more often than not, and the cause of today’s miserable mood remained an enigma to John.
“That’s bang out of order mate, that’s the guy’s mum!” Sherlock was on the floor, and he couldn’t see a way out. There were too many here. He would just have to wait until they got bored and left him alone. He tried to distract himself from the attack, deducing the models of passing cars by the noises of their engines, but it was difficult; Charlie seemed to know exactly where to hit to cause most pain. A Ford Focus, a Peugeot 308, and this… was a bus, it was stopping at the shelter, and… a Citroen…? A different voice… who… how… The scene around him faded.
The scene that awaits them is gruesome to say the least and John was a doctor in the damn army for crying out loud. There is a man lying on the ground, or at least what they assume pieces of a man to be. The killer obviously didn’t do the killing here, since there isn’t even one speck of blood anywhere, Sherlock is sure of it. The whole room is covered in plastic wrap and a thrill is washing over his body because this is someone who is clever. John is kneeling next to the body pieces examining them with a cool mask of indifference on his face that would surely fool anyone but Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock continues to take in the room trying to deduce anything about the location that might be of note. It is a small flat in a vacant townhouse, a place so cheap that only a student or someone with a very limited income would even consider living in it. Still it could hold sentimental value to their suspect so while he waits for John to finish his own deductions, he researches the history of the property on his phone. Apparently it used to be one great big Victorian house, complete with a servants staircase, a small ballroom, and no less than ten bedrooms. But it seems that the family that owned it, had no choice but to sell due to the most recent recession. After that it was bought by a rather small company that remodeled it into small flats. They never really took off however, and the property has been vacant for at least six months.
“Mycroft if Lestrade wants our damn statements so bad he can bloody well come here himself. Rather than sending his recent conquest, alright?”
He can’t help but shake his head in disbelief at himself. He never used to care about worrying someone a few years ago - hell he didn’t care about worrying John. But the fall has changed all that, when he saw the effect that his ‘death’ had on John, well it made him realize that he couldn’t just treat his body as transport all the time. He can still remember the chasm of despair that chiseled open that day at the grave when he heard John beg in that broken voice, “Don’t be dead.” That’s the moment Sherlock realized what all those horrific writers were going on about when they said that it’s possible for your heart to break, or at least he thought that is what happened. It wasn’t until he returned and found John with Mary that his heart crumbled apart in his chest.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and slumps down into the chair again. “Mycroft. Why does Mycroft want me there?”
Usually when Sherlock was wrong about something, he was full of irritation, and fell into a terrible mood. Yet as he shouted about this failure, and he was grinning broadly at John, who blatantly had no idea what was going on.
The large window burns bright with Mediterranean sun as Sherlock assembles the evidence into reasonable order and assembles comprehensive background research on the victims. Next, he turns his attention to the gunshot wounds - he’s unsure what kind of gun was used for the murders, and his usual sources are yielding nothing. This is one of the parts of his mind palace that he’d let rust and decay, and eventually he’d deleted altogether; John would tell him the answer before he’d even begun to access the information, and it was a waste of space to store information on both their hard drives. John has detailed knowledge of weaponry, medical biochemistry and popular culture, so Sherlock has very little detail on these subjects. This, of course, has now become a problem, since the time came when he was no longer able to consult his knitted-jumper-wearing external hard drive.
Sorry this is a little late! In my defence I’ve been in and out of hospital the last couple of days. (This is another bid for sympathy kudos. Don’t give in. Only give me deserved kudos.) Follow my Tumblr if you want to know way too much about what’s happening in my life and see me reblog some great Johnlock memes (and for fic updates) @thejohnlockoutlet. Enjoy :)
Dinner is booked for 8 o’clock at Le Negresco Hotel. John buttons himself into his shirt and puts on a brave face.
I also know nothing about cars, but these are all real cars because I looked them up online. I'm very dedicated to this fic.
“I wasn’t even there long enough to have an argument! Why can’t I have anyone in my life that plays a more significant role than you?!”
Mary keeps speaking to him from her position by the door, her voice soft but firm. “John, walking away from our disagreements won’t solve them, you know that.”
However inscrutable he was, though, he felt an unexpected pang at leaving the home he had built with Sherlock over the last month. With Christmas drawing closer, the prospect of sharing the season with his unusual found family in Baker Street had been a thought of comfort to John. He had never particularly enjoyed painfully forced socialisation with his blood relatives and so usually was filled with dread from the first time he heard Mariah Carey sing “All I Want For Christmas Is You” each year. But this December, no such feeling had surfaced; the only similar emotion he had experienced was that which he was feeling now, speeding through bleak streets towards the south London suburb where his parents lived.
The memory of their first adventure together puts a warm smile on his face he can’t seem to hide. He slides his phone out of his pocket, and before he knows it, he’s fired off a text which is perhaps more affectionate than he would’ve written in the presence of his wife. Since Sherlock’s return, she has always been careful that they don’t have too much time alone together. John tries to find this jealousy sweet.
” Sherlock’s face lit up with a glow of excitement that only a really good case could give him. “The canals! The robberies in Mile End, Hackney and Stratford were all buildings which backed onto the Hertford Union Canal! And of course, the junction in the canal meant he had to change direction - he went north-west towards the Hackney Cut, and stopped in Clapton on the way to perform another quick job, and that’s the one that went wrong.” He grabbed his phone and slammed in some numbers. “Lestrade? Lestrade?! Canal boats! Look for the killer on a canal boat, he’ll be somewhere north-west of the Hackney Cut by now and the weapon and blood-stained clothes should be in the water, I presume. I can’t believe you didn’t get this one, I solved it in the taxi, hadn’t even arrived at the scene!”
The evening is stilted after that. The conversation topics stick strictly to how pleasant the food is, and how nice the weather has been so far, and what they might do with the rainy day forecast for tomorrow. He isn’t sure why, but he gets some level of vindictive satisfaction in the emotional distance between them. The unavoidable fact is that he married her out of compromise, out of a need for normality, and it’s easier to keep the facade that he’s a normal man suitable for this normal life if he remains an emotional six feet away. When he lets his emotions near the surface, they seem to misdirect.
John wonders whether he’s going too far, too much, too fast, but his subconscious is miles ahead and guiding his hands over places he’s never been able to touch before and it’s
Sherlock watched the second hand of the plain clock on the classroom wall tick round. 5 minutes and 14 seconds to go…
“It’s a special trick courtesy of Dr John Watson, Shhherlock, and as always,” he stops for a gleeful giggle he cannot contain, “you see but you do not
It should be noted that especially from this point, Mary’s characterisation leaves the realms of canon.
I’m also sorry that it’s very sad most of the way through this story! I needed to write myself out of the sadness of this part of canon and give it a much swifter and simpler happy ending than we will ever get in the show itself, but I must admit that there’s still a lot to work through and deal with before we get there in this fic. I’m suffering too, but I promise we’ll escape this sadness and it will be all worth it in the end!
“I also know that you still live at home, and that you came here after a particularly disastrous date.”
He hadn’t realised, until the wedding itself, that this was really happening. It had been a game, a task of organisation. He’d enjoyed the mental exercise, figuring out the little details of the day John would like. Completely ignoring the emotional significance the day could hold. But it had cemented in Sherlock’s mind, in the small country church decorated in blooms he himself had chosen. The ceremony. Those words. Those promises.
? Mess is an understatement and a half! But no, it’s not about that. Although you can buy me a new set of soup bowls. This is about…us. You and me. Us living together, solving cases together. Our… situation. Working as a team, living as friends, or partners, I don’t know what. I can’t carry on with things as they are. My feelings - my feelings have changed towards you.”
John watches a pinprick-sized plane cross the bright blue sky, and wishes he knew what the detective was currently occupying his mind with.
Leaving Mary discussing her wedding dress with Mrs Hudson - for about the hundredth time - John approached Sherlock, placing a hand on his shoulder. He remained tense under John’s touch. Sherlock had never been receptive to this sort of contact with other people.
“Trevor is blackmailing the Secret Service… She has information and wants protection from the French legal system. Puts us in a damn difficult position if she's guilty, so we need to know as soon as possible if she's guilty or not. Mycroft needs it sorted. He knows you’ll do the job best.” Lestrade sighed. “There are other cases for you, if you don’t want this one, but I just thought… a change of scene?”
What feels like hours later, Lestrade closes the door of 221B. It hasn’t been as he had expected at all. Sherlock was almost entirely non-responsive, but not because his mind was busy, as it often was when he tuned Lestrade out. Even when the detective was still, there was always a sense of movement about him, as if he was always ready to jump up at a moment’s notice. The outside was often still, but behind the eyes you could sense the furious movement, turning over facts and ideas and connecting clues to form answers. Not so today. Sherlock had been truly still, his eyes closed, curled in his armchair, and honestly, looking a mess. Sherlock was often dishevelled, but he did take pride in keeping smart, and his appearance going downhill was a reliable mirror of how he was feeling inside.
The classrooms were boring, the teachers were boring, and the other students were boring. He was just deciding which explosives might blow up this school in the most impressive way - and how he would make sure that the act was blamed on Mycroft – when unbidden thoughts entered his head, in the voice of John.
The outrageously expensive cafe is a necessary evil, however. His hotel room’s wifi is painfully slow, and Sherlock is not a man blessed with patience. Luckily his work, at least, is not seen as unusual here - the room is full of twenty-somethings with random notes and papers, writing the screenplays which he has no doubt will
Those poor souls seated near him also overheard extracts of muttering, “…bloody brother… a budget airline… has three private jets… petty gesture … wait till he finds out what I put in his sugar…”
“John, I never brought up Sherlock, or- I would never! It was just a turn of phrase, I didn’t mean to-” Mary came into the living room as if entering the cage of a particularly vicious lion. Her nervous expression melted John’s anger, replacing his surface emotions with concern. “I know it’s been tricky for you John, it’s alright. Your friendship will get better, in time.”
"Sherlock! It’s been a while. Don’t say you’ve been avoiding us.” Raucous laughter. Sherlock’s heart sank. He’d left the school grounds, and was now in a quiet suburban street. A bus stop sheltered a collection of teenagers in disheveled school uniform, with malicious grins stretched across their faces. They gathered around Sherlock, leaving no room for escape.
John’s hands have taken no such precautions. One slides up his back and one up his chest, and Sherlock is sure that even John can make a deduction from how fast the heartbeat he found there is racing. His mouth still working the neck area, one hand slides up his back and into his hair, and it is glorious but the alcohol is still in his system and it is all fuzzy round the edges and if only he was sober enough to be able to get as much data on this as possible to store and process and-
“You, John Watson! Always full of surprises. I can never full figure you out. I thought you were telling me you’d got fed up of me and wanted to move out, possibly even stop being friends. But am I right in saying that this hypothesis was incorrect?”
“I know this friendship is important to you, Sherlock. It is to me, too. If we both work together, we can get past this and remain friends. I’m sorry to have put this bump in the road for us, but you don’t choose who you fall in love with, do you?”
“That wound really looks bad. I could look at it if you like, clean it up so it doesn’t get infected.” This was too much. This must be some sort of very vivid dream, or an elaborate prank by Mycroft. He couldn’t take this. He ducked out from behind the counter and ran out of the door.
John Watson was in a black cab, crawling painfully slowly through jammed London streets to an address he’d heard on the lips of a stranger. This was truly mad.
Sherlock is feeling warm and fuzzy all over, his fingers and toes pleasantly numb. It’s hard to see a reason to argue with John, so he lets him have his way and lets himself bask in the glow of happy John, so close he can feel the heat from his body.
The boys finally talk to eachother about their feelings. But this is Johnlock, so naturally there’s miscommunication.
This chapter is dedicated to the motivational forces of ThePersianSlipper, TodayWeAreSoldiers and SherlockedCarmilla/CarmillaCarmine for telling me to stop sleeping and write this damn thing! This fic literally would not exist without them.
“No, we mustn’t tell John he’s there. My intelligence suggests that he shouldn’t be near Sherlock at present. His current state is volatile. It seems he’s not a big fan of seaside holidays. If only Mary had let Sherlock plan the honeymoon as well as the wedding…”
brownish expanses of grass that made up Regent’s Park. They were heading to Lestrade’s house for Boxing Day dinner and drinks, with Sherlock only having been convinced to go when he’d been promised they would be discussing important casework somewhere between the traditions and social niceties of the festive season.
Sherlock closes the gap between them roughly, pushing their lips together in an outpour of pent-up feeling. The floodgates have opened and their mouths press together, tongues sliding in a sloppy mess of release.
, he thinks. A colleague on the force having a good moan about the lady that serves the dinners in the canteen, a video of a cat in a cardboard box - why is he on this stupid site anyway? Ah, that’s something he’s interested in, a selfie of John and Mary on their honeymoon, sweet. A beach holiday, how nice for them… nice-
John is not really sure what to do. At least doing nothing won’t make things worse, right? Sherlock is still too, at least until John decides he really does have to breathe, and exhales through his nose onto the exposed skin. Sherlock’s irrepressible shiver awakes a thought in him which he’s too drunk to choose not to say.
Sherlock raced down a maze of corridors and staircases, and burst out of a dented door on the side of the concrete cube of a school he’d been imprisoned in for the last few hours. Although it was muddy, cutting across the school field was safer than using the main gate to go home. It was an annoying but necessary precaution to avoid the idiots who went to this school, those who Sherlock had accidentally offended during his few years there.
“Look *hic* what *hic* you’ve gone and *hic* done!” Sherlock can’t stop giggling, the smile immovable from his lips as he looks down at John, a pathetic heap on the floor at his feet. He’s caught the giggles too and is rolling around. Sherlock has never seen any sight more that filled him with so much joy.
The laughter eventually dies away, and Lestrade struggles to regain control of his breathing. “Weird coincidence, though, the two of them ending up in the same place like that. Only Sherlock and John, huh?”
Relieved by the unexpected moment of solitude, he checks his phone, out of habit. Nothing. Not that he expected there to be anything… but maybe Sherlock might have needed his opinion on a case, or something. He didn’t want to leave his friend in the lurch.
Clumsily, Sherlock leans forward. John leans in to meet him, one hand still in his hair. They pause, noses brushing, and take the moment to feel short breaths on hot skin. Sherlock places a cautious palm on John’s cheek. John licks his lips.
It’s disgustingly grandiose and ornate, faded decor from a bygone age, before minimalism became a sign of wealth. Mary is clearly overjoyed with the appearance of the place, though, which makes the whole experience bearable for John. She gives away the fact that they don’t belong here in her every action: snapping photos on her phone, getting excited over the velour menus, and vocalising her amazement and the length of the wine list. John tries to play along. He’s doing well, until he sees the price of the wine she’s chosen.
However, at the age of 18, he had started to run out of psychological explanations for why he still needed his imaginary companion. He could only imagine the merciless teasing he would get from his older brother Mycroft for indulging in something so illogical and sentimental. As such, Sherlock’s only friend remained a secret.
So I watched him while he ate his cake, and then I wondered as he smiled behind his pipe exactly what he might be smiling at.  The secret would reveal itself in time, I thought, and so resolved to think no more about it.
Holmes noted this, but to his credit he said nothing; curved a smile and bit his lip.  “I still want more of you,” he said.  “It's this spring weather.  I'm in flux.”
“It's how I am,” I said, “for better or for worse.”  I plucked my courage with both hands.  “What do you think of me?”
“No,” I agreed.  “You hoard things here.  And that is why this room's a mess.”  He looked so stately, fine and graceful, standing there in just his shirt-sleeves, hands perched neatly on his hips, his legs apart and primed for battle.  I had loved him for a long time; ever patient, ever silent, ever hoping. And yet my hope dwindled a little more each day, as dust or sand might renegotiate its place within the heart.  “Where should we start?”
“It's all her fault,” he wailed.  “Everything, and all of it.  I'm surprised I haven't been sick eight times already.”
After dinner, in the sitting-room, we sipped at brandy, smoked cigars, and played at dominoes in pairs.  I exchanged looks with Holmes.  We smouldered at each other for the longest while, until at last the straw was too much for the camel's back, and we rose up as one.  How it must have looked, I do not know, but we both made our poor excuses to the company, and so retired to bed, with overstated yawning.
“What you may say and what is fact are two quite separate things,” said Holmes.  He motioned to Lestrade that we'd prefer to be alone, and closed the door to shut the puffing fellow out into the hall.  “Oh, what a bumbler he is,” my companion complained.  “And he's the best of a bad lot – which doesn't say much for the rest of them.”
, where any man might call on point of business.  I declare that this family will be the death of me.  First Ulysses' terrible deed, and now this.”  Mycroft stopped himself abruptly.  “I mean to say, of course, that all families have their trouble.  I shall take the necessary steps.  Would you care to have some lunch here?  I can arrange a table for you if you desire it.”
“He told you that much, eh?  It's true.  For yes, he's living as a man now, and has done for many years.”  Adams looked at me.  “Not shocked, eh, Watson?  Ah, old chum, I didn't think you would be.”
Victor insisted that the Bruces stay for dinner.  We sat six around the table and we jostled for potatoes and we argued over vegetables.  The roast goose was very fine indeed.  If our guests found it unusual that the house was plagued by bachelors, then they were polite enough to make no mention of it.  We spoke of England: of her traditions and her weather, our fond nostalgia and our hope.  We talked and we made merry, and all spent a most delightful summer evening.
“What?  The...?  Why, yes, I believe so.”  Burroughs scratched at his head, a sharp, nervous movement.  “But what have you found?  What was it you wrote in your notebook?  Mr. Holmes!”  His voice rose at the last.
“It would be as well to.  I must send another telegram in any case.  The pieces of the puzzle are quite opaque, still, John.  But at least we have a name to play with now.”
Holmes said nothing, but his grey eyes shone bright.  The faintest curl played at his lip.  I attributed this to little more than gas or quiet placation, and paid no mind.  My thoughts were now upon my speech, what I should say, and how so humble and indeed grateful I would appear while I was saying it.
“Well, John,” said my old friend, “if you could wait a few more minutes then you might walk with Isobel to her Aunt Jessica's.  She has been asked to spend the night there, as my sister has been feeling quite unwell these past few days.”  He shook his head.  “Her heart, we think.  Some solidarity and company, it does the power of good.  I would have walked with Isobel myself, of course, but as you're on your way...?”
And at eight sharp, we sat to dinner, and we spoke yet more of everything and nothing.  Mrs. Hudson was so kind to make a lentil stew; I coaxed my friend to take a bowl.  He did so, at my chafing, and he liked it well enough.  Our talk was merry, with the wine, and I neglected all the voices in my head that asked me
“Perhaps it is not such a waste,” he replied.  “Even if they itch, my legs look lovely with no hair on them.”  He sat back in his chair, and turned attention to his breakfast.
He rose, and towered above me – or so it seemed, for I confess I had my eyes strictly averted – then he gathered up his jacket, and progressed towards the door.
is why I'm sitting here, amazed, amused, what have you.”  Adams lit a cigarette, and sucked it, chuckling away.  “I fell in love, you know, and told him.  He replied in the same vein, and then confessed to his great secret.”
“I have seen her several times from these windows,” Victor replied.  “Dressed in black, with an odd hooded cape.  But by the time that I open the front door, she has gone.  It is as if she is a phantom.”
“Tracking down lost kittens, I suppose, and mislaid wedding rings.”  I smiled to show that I was jesting, but his face became a pucker, and he sniffed and looked away.  “I didn't mean it,” I added hastily.  “Good lord, you're sensitive.”
“It is a valuable antique, Mr. Holmes.  I want it near me, you understand, so that if my house is burglarised at night, well, it won't be so likely to be taken.  I am a bachelor and I live alone, save for my old housekeeper who keeps a back room.  I do have a safe-box, but it is small and it is full of my papers and deeds, and Bugalugs simply wouldn't fit.”
“I want my breakfast,” I said firmly.  “Will we need to pack our bags again?  The twelve-thirty will be perfect.”
Being shorter, I remained within our rooms at Baker Street, with the windows flung wide open and the air from this grand height infinitely cooler and far preferable.  Seated on the sill and looking out, therefore, I was feeling quite content until the maelstrom returned home from who knew where.
The afternoon was spent unpacking and arranging our possessions.  There was more space than the either of us knew quite what to do with, and that pleased us both immensely.  We had arranged that Mrs. Oaks pay us a visit before five, so that we might become acquainted.  As the time of the meeting drew near we took breath, and retired to the front to look out on the path.
“His life had been so full of promise,” I replied, my voice flat, toneless.  “But life did not turn out the way he wanted it.  The damned drink,” I added.  “It took him in the end.  I miss how he was.  When we were both boys.  I grieve what he could have become but did not.”
“You mustn't go to the barber,” said Holmes with finality.  “You must grow your hair.  I want to see what happens next.”
We conversed pleasantly for just a little while.  At some point, pots of tea and plates of sandwiches were brought into the garden and presented on a trestle.  I circulated with the other guests.  I noted darkly that Miss Cooper still had not returned.  At length, I made excuses and retired up to the Green Room, where I hoped to read awhile in peace before the dinner gong.
My speech was tucked secure inside my wallet.  I had peeped at the top lines of it a dozen times this morning, to practice tone and pace and sentiment.  I felt confident – triumphant!
“Yes, Holmes,” I said, as the door of Scotland Yard clicked shut behind us, “you must be careful.”  I looked to left and right.  “Please don't tell me that we are going to that filthy fellow's home?”
tempted the other.  The window display was crammed with oddities.  I peered through, fascinated.  There were sea-faring relics: scrimshaw bones and fierce teeth.  Ornate kerosene lamps in rich, vibrant colours.  Pewter goblets and dishes, gold boxes, brass bowls.  I found it all enthralling and magnificent.
I tensed then, straightened up.  From a window, just ajar upon the upper floor, there came a dreadful sound.  The sound of weeping, harsh and bitter.  A man was weeping there, as if his very heart was in the act of breaking.
And such is the way with naps, I awoke a good while later with a crick inside my neck and my waistcoat creased and crumpled.
“I'm not sure myself.”  I nestled, a little.  I felt him relax.  But it felt different now, and I didn't know why.  “We just talked.”
We took the downstairs rooms to task: the cabinets and cupboards and the mantels, where odd envelopes and documents might lurk.  Pencilled shopping lists,
Very obviously conflicted, he turned and left the room.  If my reaction had been slower then I believe he might have headed for the stairs and the front door.  As it was, I caught his wrist and pulled him back.  He resisted with some force.
“Just look at you,” I breathed.  “You are so beautiful.”  I kneeled upon the bed and stroked his skin.  “This is so different,” I said.  I kissed his stomach, and the tight buds on his chest, and touched the hot flush of his prick for the first time.  He inhaled sharply.  “
Back at the Yard, I glumly went about my business.  Lestrade was piping like a bird about his new success, his brains and ingenuity in the solving of the murder of the Hon. Cole Ramsey.  I rolled my eyes behind the safety of my door, for I knew better, still it turned my thoughts back to that dashing fellow lodged at Baker Street.  I wondered if we'd meet again.  I felt a curling of despair inside my gut, which was quite rudely interrupted by a knock upon the glass, and the small figure of our mailboy as he slid into the room.  “Excuse me, sir, you have a letter,” said the lad, as he deposited a small handwritten envelope, no postmark, on my desk.  I did not recognise the writing.  As I picked it up to take a closer look, first Toby's head, and then the rest of him, peeked through the office door.  To my dismay, he took a chair and sat there rigidly in front of me.
Holmes was sitting by the fire, his knees drawn up.  It looked most uncomfortable a perch.  He was smoking his black clay; the plume was filling half the room.  I waved a hand to clear the fug as I stepped in and now towards him.
And, well!  He was a fine one to be talking!  I looked around, and spied a violin propped up against one wall.  “You play the violin,” I said in awe.  (How I wished that I had spotted it before.)
Holmes's expression turned sour.  “It is nothing specific,” he said.  “He is one of the more able Inspectors of the Yard.  But a little of him goes a very long way.”
I stood over my friend as he sat at his desk with his pen in his hand, his tongue sticking out as he pouted in thought.
I shuffled closer and touched his shoulder with my fingertips.  I curled my arm beneath the sheet and placed a hand upon his hip.  The jut of bone, the warm and soft, inviting skin.  I left my hand to rest there while my lips sought out his mouth, to steal a brief and furtive kiss.
The next morning brought the first of them: a parcel, small, and square, wrapped in brown paper, tied with twine.  Stamped with a local postmark, our address in high block capitals, and 'Strictly Private, for the attention of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Esq.'
I had fallen asleep once again, after all.  When I opened my eyes, it was past eight o'clock and I was alone in our bed.  I washed and dressed quickly, and descended to the sitting-room.  Holmes was cross-legged on the rug and in the process of restringing his violin.
I hastened down to Mrs. Hudson to request a pot of tea.  When I returned, my friend was frowning at the mantelpiece, a finger to his lips.
Holmes bowed but very slightly; he gestured to a padded armchair.  The woman sat, all of a fidget, shooting anxious looks to her companion who remained standing.
“I received a letter yesterday,” I continued conversationally, relieved and happy now the torture had concluded.  “From an old friend of mine, Anstruther, who has a practice newly opened up on Crawford Street.  He has invited me to join him.  I'm currently considering.”
“Remind me of the fellow, what he did, and why he might bear such a grudge after this time,” I said.
“Tell me how I shall be remembered over a hundred years from now,” he said, eager and encouraging.  “Go on, Watson.”
Holmes declined to reply.  “Lestrade almost threw the lamp at me again.  I don't know how he thinks this case is
“Yes, Mr.... Holmes.  But however did you know that?  Research?  What for, when it is not any of your business?  Where is Mrs. Burroughs, now?”
I stepped into the room.  The fellow moved towards the fireplace.  “I lit a fire,” he said self-consciously, as if half seeking my approval.
the memory, expostulations, feeling wretched.  I knew whatever else might happen, that there'd be no means of functioning as usual today.  I washed and dressed, and hastened down to find Miss Marsh, if she was in.  Her desk was empty, so I penned a scribbled note that I was unavailable for practice, and if she might please ask Dr. Anstruther next door if he could deal with all my patients for the day.  I drank a cup of tea.  I left the surgery, and headed off to 221B Baker Street.
I jettisoned the paper.  My soup was good; alas, the pumpkin dish was merely edible.  I waved away dessert and paid my bill, and made for home.  So that was Sunday, done and dusted.  The lurching promise of another week ahead of me.  Something had to happen.  Anything at all.
These theories subdued me.  “I do not believe that Mrs. Barker could be capable of such a vicious crime,” I said, rubbing my chin.  “She seems such a gentle soul.  And, why, anyone can see that she has become a nervous wreck.  I suspect Dawkins.  He is the one with the skull, after all.”  I paused to think.  “But I can't think why the lady would cover for her cousin, when she speaks of him so dismissively.  Oh!  Holmes!  Do you think it is blackmail?”
“I am so deeply, incredibly sorry, Mr. Holmes,” our guest returned.  “I meant you no harm by my charging towards you.  I am not a violent man.  I was so caught up with the urgency to warn you of the danger.  For if anything should happen, well, I don't think I could bear it, with the knowledge that I might well have prevented the atrocity!”
“That's right,” I said.  I straightened up, on the alert in case he made a fuss.  It seemed that he might not.  He nodded civilly, and edged his way into the room.  He hesitated, then:
“You're not making the slightest bit of sense,” I informed him.  “Come over here and have breakfast.”
I laughed.  “I wish you luck with that,” I said.  “He seems the toughest nut; I doubt that you will crack him.”
A handful of each other, and my teeth upon his neck.  His hips to mine, through cloth, it made no matter, as we wrestled on the bed.  Endearments whispered in the other's ear; teasing a moan, a sense of urgency, and hands, caressing, pulling, hot and feverish, the taste of his saliva, and the scent of his damp skin.
Isn't it so pleasant, though, to have someone with whom to talk this way?  A love, to yammer nonsense with, to share your egg and cress, your beef and mustard, and all the rest of it.
As you might well appreciate, I had barely breath to speak or even gasp.  I moaned and thrashed and all but kneed him in the face.  “You might have asked me rather sooner,” I said, a-croak.  “I'm almost
As Dawkins himself was 'unusual' enough, I informed my friend that the notion had not registered particularly.  “It is just a piece of jewellery,” I said – and yawned.  It had been a long and tiring morning, with a large and sating lunch.  I felt in need of a nap.
Mr. Oaks looked up.  “I need the money desperate,” said he.  “That's why I'm still dressed up and talking like a fool.  I guessed I'd carry on until I found a job elsewhere to suit my trade or otherwise.  I didn't mean no harm, sirs.  I really meant no harm at all.  And I don't know how you found me out, but I hope you aren't so angry.”
Gregson thumbed in my direction.  “You want to borrow him?”  This to the fellow Holmes, who nodded shortly.  “Some field work for you then, John, if you like.  Might be of interest.”
He followed me, all discontent and pique, up the hall stairs and down the landing to the Green Room.  He would not tolerate my wry attempts at humour on the way; he huffed and grunted, and indeed did not utter another word until we entered, whereupon he flung his duffle on the empty bed and followed it thereafter.  He lay there on his back, his hands behind his head, his eyes fixed hard upon me as I dithered at the wardrobe.
I refused to return home, however.  I told my friend that he should find me in the establishment across the road – I pointed – and to meet me there the minute he was able.
“If the worst comes to the worst,” I said, “we can cook our own meal, and we can light our own fires.  A temporary situation,” I added then, as I saw Holmes's flinch in horror.
The calming effect from the hug had quite vanished.  I was aching to know all the detail – of Dawkins, the skull, and of poor Mrs. Barker.
I shut the window firmly.  I smoothed my hair down once again, as it had indeed been blown awry.  Turning crossly to face my friend, I observed the change upon his face; a subtle change at first, and then not quite so.
John is always uncomfortable eating at expensive restaurants. Remnants from his simple upbringing, he supposes; he hates the unnecessary pomp and ceremony over what is essentially just fuelling your body for another day. It seems ridiculous that at one point in his life he ate sparse rations in the Afghan desert, hoping only to survive until their next portion, and yet several worlds away people were worrying about which fork to eat their fish course with.
Frustrated, he considers his options. Mycroft would love Sherlock to come to him for help, and the thought of his smug smile rules out his assistance immediately. The police would take days to respond, and this case is potentially time sensitive. The internet is being little help, and the search is tedious. There’s only one option, and although it feels like some sort of line crossed, Sherlock can’t bring himself to worry too much.
“The Watsons have dinner reservations but no firm plans for the day. Sherlock is visiting the crime scene - a hotel, I believe, was where the last victim was found?”
ex-pat Carlson Murphy has been murdered in his home, a gunshot to the head from considerable distance, the fourth in a series of such murders. High society escort Victoire Trevor is suspected of the murder - all the victims were her clients, several of whom had left money to her in their will. Local police can’t find sufficient evidence to convict, and doubts have been placed on Trevor’s ability to make such accurate, long-distance shots.
That struck a nerve. John coughed, and made to get out of the room, anywhere. He ended up in the small living room, surrounded by chairs and cushions and cozy decoration. He didn’t sit down.
Sherlock blinks. John is drunk, even more stupid that usual, and yet incredibly, he’s right. How did he notice this before Sherlock did? He must be more drunk than he thought. He feels something soft against his cheek and realises he’s tilted over and the side of his face is resting on the seat of his armchair. John seems to feel this was a wise move, and imitates him. John doesn’t seem to have thought this through however, as he goes to plant his face in the seat of Sherlock’s chair, finds his way obstructed by Sherlock himself. The result of this is that John finds his face resting on the expanse of pale neck revealed by the tilt of Sherlock’s head.
“I hope they do. It’ll stop them eyeing you up in the street, hopefully, if they know you’re unavailable,” John grinned. “Hurry up now. I can’t wait to tell Lestrade why we’re late! He’ll have a fit, I’m pretty sure he’s had bets on us from the start. Him and half of Scotland Yard.”
“All surrounded by parks? Maybe they hide in the bushes, no CCTV to observe them, and break in that way?”
“Tut, Sherlock, the neighbours!” Mrs Hudson remarked automatically. “He’s very unsettled by the change, and of course, he will miss you both, but once you’re back and there’s a routine he understands in place, he will be back to his normal self again.” John highly doubted this, but saying so would do no good to anybody. The relationship he and Sherlock had once had seemed irreparably changed; they hadn’t been right since he had been dead - or not, as it turned out - for two years, and with Mary now in the picture, their friendship was more strained than it ever had been. This was a fact that John was doing his best to optimistically ignore. He wasn’t succeeding.
“In my pocket, coat soaked up the worst of it. The emergency responders must have inadvertently jostled it out when they carted me away. Worked out nicely for you. Here. Wear it a bit longer, until a better offer comes along, at least. You never know what I will get up to next. Might stretch your fifteen minutes of infamy, if I can swing a few more scandals for your coffers.  The parents will have to wait until after Christmas. My own parents insist on my presence. Tell yours it’s a matter of my inheritance. I’m sure they will understand if they’re anything like the precious daughter they raised.”
She leaned in and kissed him, slowly and sweetly. He closed his eyes and kissed her back. He sighed with annoyance when he heard the click of her phone taking a picture.
John mumbles under his breath, speaking to the invisible legends of fate in his last probable one-sided conversation, pretty sure he's about to learn all the answers of man's quest to look beyond the veil. "Yeah, I get it, God. Death by Holmes is my, set in stone, fate. Try not to make it hurt, and I promise God, the next suicide note, I will take much more seriously. No jokes, I swear. Okay. Well, I do hate this by the way, just in case you care."
But, she'd seen the havoc one slip had wrought. She had arched a blacksmith's hammer with unskilled hope and brought down ruin upon the delicate molten sword. Molly Hooper would have every justification to hurt Sherlock and even if she were not born with the blood of Satan himself, she had no need to ever be loyal to Sherlock again.
Eloise Wheatley moans, "Oh God, you didn't? Do you know how hard it is to get anyone to come here for dinner? They all want to leave before the sun goes down. You and your blasted foolery, Harper. And recruiting young Sherlock – God knows what will be said now. We'll be haunted next thing you know!"
John opened his eyes. "I think that explains where I thought we were. Don't worry though Sherlock, just delete it. It wasn't important."
Rat looks down at John and his eyes dance with emotion.  John doesn’t know how to react.  He watches Ford’s eyes return to elsewhere as if he’s no longer in the room.  John’s jaw clenches less as he waits out the silence.
"That is because it is. What a simple Never, Never Land you have made London in your mind. A place in which you have made yourself, Peter and all you must do with your life is go on adventures, match your wits against the evil Captain Hook and fly around Big Ben bombed out on pixy dust and pout in you Jim jams and dressing gown. Oh Sherlock. You have forgotten who read you those stories and who has always stood the cost of your antics. I'm sorry Peter Pan. Your Watson Darling is in trouble. I'm afraid you're going to have to grow up to save him." Mycroft smiles and his face is actually soft with pure fondness.
“Well, that’s refreshing. I shall draw a list of questions to which I have long hoped to be blessed with that response,” Mycroft said with a deep sigh as he lowered himself into Sherlock’s chair. “ Good god, what is that you are permeated with? The sillage is more overwhelming than your signature, Ode du Mortuary.”
"Oh. I don't remember meeting you," she says carefully knowing she would have remembered that incredibly deep purr of a voice.
"Then it wasn't unloaded. Physically it was, but not in your mind. I have seen him kill. Molly, I should never have asked this of you. I should have done so many things differently. You have lost something. I ruined you, but I knew that long ago. I am always right." His hands roam up to her neck and he blindly caresses her cheek.
John didn't do it to be important or even for the thrill and he certainly would never need worry about the handsome fees paid for his silence. John had no idea how wealthy Sherlock and Mycroft had been. He never had any need to be bothered with acquiring things. Mycroft kept him abreast of the details but even that held no allure to make social contact with Sherlock's brother.
Sherlock smiles up at Mr. Wheatley with genuine affection all forgiven now that Mycroft was the crazy one and says gently, "Of course, sir. You would have tanned my tatties if I had skived off." He replied using Mr. Wheatley's old phrase from when Sherlock had been here as a child.
Ten heartbeats of silence were broken by hysterical female laughter.  Mycroft smiled as if he were in pain and rolled his eyes.
John opened a gift of slippers from Molly and nodded his thanks.  He blew out his candles and Lestrade asked him what he wished for.  John’s eyes found their target, locking onto Sherlock.
He’d rushed to safe-haven and then made for London as if he were a common fellow with an actual identity and mundane life.  He went in disguise, of course, but at the moment, he’d honestly believed his youngest son had followed the path he himself had not actually taken.
"I beg your pardon. I do. I have every right. Until I determine the deterioration of his mental capacity, you have no further say in the fate of John Watson. I don't even have to do more than set him free at this point. He will be retired by his own former colleagues. That is out of my hands. He has been deemed a loose cannon and I have to agree with them. Push me, and I will let his problems resolve themselves in the manner he signed up for long ago."
“Fairs fair, Mycroft. You sold me to both Jim and Aunt Liz. To save my life. Then to extract me, you left the ship without its rudder and returned to discover it overrun with pirates. You knew what the underground terrorist cell was up to all along. You didn’t need me. But you do now and instead of admitting it, you are being stubborn. I can help you, and you know it.” Sherlock said confidently to the ceiling.
“Already…goddit,” John enunciated slowly and carefully.  Sherlock didn’t have to tell a single person in the room what John had said or what he meant.
He could see some of the points made on the website, though many seemed so farfetched he had shaken his head at such boasts as being able to tell if a person was guilty by eye movement in a particular direction or if someone was a pilot by looking at their left thumb. John had seen his demonstration of observance, which was amazing, yet he also noticed how Sherlock did not observe as many equally important things as he did pick up.
"It seems my babies have been fishing and they got snagged in a rather large drag net. You can start by explaining your association with Sherlock Holmes and clarify to me why he pretended to be dead to keep you alive?" The Rat said with pleasant concern as if inquiring about John's favorite restaurant.
He’d left John to his fate after that, too ashamed of his actions and too afraid John would repeat his own to stay.  It seemed ok.  John had left him no death threats.  Ford lay low but John sat in his flat at night and Ford couldn’t stand to watch John give his hi-power mouth to mouth each night.
Over the years he'd done things for her unexpectedly. Sherlock would breeze into the morgue and drop off a box of herbal tea meant to prevent migraines. She sometimes found a box of chocolate, opened and two or three bitten or missing, with a note that he hated them and could she throw them away. One winter she'd sprained her ankle and every morning and afternoon for three weeks, a taxi waited at her door to take her to work. There would be another waiting when her shift was over. They were all paid for and the driver would not even accept a tip. Sherlock never admitted he'd arranged this, but he hadn't denied it either. He would text Molly that she needed to stay away from the tube for the next two weeks, hinting without saying that he knew of some reason it could put her in danger. Once she'd met Mycroft, she had a better idea of the source of his information.
Thanks for reading.  Chapter 2 will be posted soon but my spellcheck has taken a powder so if you see a mistake please let me know.   It does get better or at least fluffier.
He sat by the fire after the afternoon nurse left and before the night shift woman would arrive.  This was the best time of day for Sherlock.
Sherlock could out think anything. Never mind he'd taken his pulse, held his dead hand, seen the height from which he'd sustained the injuries, gone to his funeral, visited his grave, and seen his dead eyes with mismatched pupils. John still had hope. He didn't get rid of Sherlock's belongings. He didn't spend his money. He waited. He watched strangers carefully for the signs of disguise. He waited for a balding old man or an awkwardly tall house frau to fall into step with him and reveal that it had all been just a magic trick like he'd said that day. He trusted. He believed. He could not exist without this self-deceptive little mirage.
If you own the world, what is left to want? Sherlock was something Jim could not have. Then John showed up, older, damaged, boring and yet Sherlock loved him.
Now it was Mycroft's turn to display mirth though on the bespoke clad man of mystery on the other side of the phone, that came across as more snide than joyful.  "I honestly thought you were more clever than you appear.  I abhor being proved wrong.  I would think the answer to that question could be solved, well, by anyone who has spent five minutes in your proximity.  Do try harder, John, that scenario is yet to be completely abandoned, but I do have confidence that you will catch up to the class before I have to implement such measures.  Do ring me if you need anything."
“Nope. He could write all the silly songs he wants and I don’t see why anyone would need to kill him.  Over songs.  Which we probably would not even be able to hear…”John reasons, confusion marked on the forehead and brows of the doctor’s face. “I mean research does show that music can, in some cases, aid healing in trauma patients.  Stimulate brain activity in those who have lapsed into coma.  Is that what you mean?”
"No. Thank you. I must get back. Terribly bad timing with the cholera and riots in Conakry, but you don't need to know about that. Miss Hooper, I request that you see me to my car?" he asks pleasantly.
John ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "It meant that I was not staging a marriage to hide my inability to be seen as in love with a man. It meant it was not my thing to begin with and it showed me that only you crossed that boundary for me. I was not disappointed with that answer, but I needed to know."
The darkness was lifted from John's heart.  Forgiveness flooded him and no matter what, Sherlock would never die unloved.  It was a burden lifted and even Sherlock's laughter could not spoil it.
Sherlock nodded, refusing to look at John, his jaw working angrily was the only indication that he was not flitting off to his mind palace. Janine stood slowly and took a hesitant step toward John, then stopped. “I really am sorry. I didn’t…”
He knew Sherlock would be watching, so he’d sent John across town with a puzzle. He was not surprised that John had taken his bait.  He’d followed him in another taxi and then bought coffee as if he’d been awaiting his arrival.
He didn’t take kindly to John having invaded his territory and despite the obvious care the man had just received; he belligerently demanded that this was not a place for amateur medics.   John backed off rather than make a scene.  He had no idea how Rat had arranged this rescue and the crisis was over and as always, John’s adrenaline began to crash alarmingly.   He collapsed in a chair in the hallway and was sound asleep when Rat touched his arm.
“You killed me for the most part and made a bloody joke of me on the night I was going to propose and finally find the strength to let you go. I had finally decided to live, or at least stop being mostly dead and that was when you interrupted to discuss facial hair. You made fun of me. Then in the carriage with the bomb, you faked tears to make me forgive you and then we didn’t die. I loved you most. More than any of the ones who got to know you were alive and that hurt. I suffered long after the press quit hounding me and long after I stopped falling apart every time somebody said something horrible about you and even when they all announced that I had been right about you all along and they all started pointing fingers and wanting me to say things that I wished by then had actually happened – I didn’t get to be put out of my misery. You left me and never looked back. She was the one who picked up the broken foolish man who didn’t have a reason to not top himself. She said I was good enough. She didn’t love you or hate you. I got to tell her my stories and the Sherlock she knew was the one I painted. She didn’t care that you were tall or cool or a bloody lunatic and it meant there was someone who got it. I asked her not to read anything, about you. I wanted her to understand my Sherlock, not theirs, not the Reichenbach hero, but mine.” John said his breathing hard and his voice raspy.
We hear both Mary and Sherlock say that John picked her Because she was 'like that' This is my take on the back story of --what if he did?
: John and Molly would never have noticed each other if he were not dead. The thing is, Molly knows he isn't and she never expected things to get this complicated. John is off on his next great adventure and there are secrets that bind him to Sherlock in ways even consulting detectives can't imagine. Welcome back to Part two, If you thought the first part was complicated, well you are in for a bit more. Please keep your hands inside the compartment at all times.
"Because at the time, nobody else loved you. Greg cared, but you didn't really have anyone else. You hadn't moved to Baker Street yet. You had a thousand acquaintances from the Queen herself to Stinky-Sam living in the sewers, but nobody…loved you. It broke my heart."
She had always thought older ladies to be a bit more like Mrs. Brewerton, sweet but painfully inexperienced when it came to matters outside the realm of polite social standards of their own girlhood. Mrs. Brewerton had referred to John and Sherlock being alluded to as a couple in the papers as 'that silly gossipy business' and had taken care to explain that her boyfriend is 'all man', as if John could not love a woman if he'd ever actually been with a man. It had befuddled Molly to contemplate that if John had been with Sherlock openly, that Mrs. Brewerton would have changed how she viewed John.
“I knew given enough time, that you would be successful. I honestly had no idea that you were not…compromised by what I read in the papers. My husband’s position is quickly deteriorating and I wanted to give him some resolution in the hope that, well he isn’t as strong as he once was,” She explained carefully.
John kept pace with him and said clearly but in a much lower tone, "But, I also learned that they hide things from you because they don't want to look bad in your eyes. And that leads to a lot of stupid delays and mistakes while everyone rushes around passing blame instead of doing their job. That's stressful for you and you have every right to yell, but it just makes them all act that way more."
"You may be right, partially. But if you were not a bloody egotistical idiot, and you did decide to kill yourself, without incentive. Would you pick something that horrible? Hell, the aneurism wouldn't have been that bad. Awful headache, but not hours of writhing gut wrenching agony. He wanted to watch it happen to you, Sherlock. People, like him, like to watch. They are afraid of death and they think they will see some magical epiphany that will make it okay for them. You have no idea how many there are out there, exactly like him. You were with him when he died. Was he calm, serene? Or was he terrified?"
Her face cooled and she scolded him, forcing him to look her in the eye and pulling no punches. “You won’t, you mean. There are other living options all around you, just in case you didn’t notice. I didn’t see you as the sniveling, coward type. I am usually a much better judge of people. We have all lost people we love. You move on. You talk to someone and you forgive the dead, and then you pick yourself up and you move on. Wallowing in self-pity has become who you are because it’s what you want. You are surrounded by people who genuinely like you, John. Anyone here would be delighted if you would take a little notice and let them in. This sadness and pain is a choice and you are embracing it and keeping yourself apart just so you don’t have to face reality.”
"Go to hell, John. I am not willing to live without you. How you seem to always miss this one glaring fact of my personality never fails to…"
With her, he never said things with the intention of cruelty, which didn't take the sting away from his comments, but she had learned to accept his scrutiny as flattery. Other people making fun of him only reinforced her protectiveness. She understood that what they said did hurt his feelings, though there was never a twitch of evidence it was true, unless he was buzzed.
“He offered to help me and said I would not shoot him. But he just kept coming. He should have just stood still. I was out of practice, horrified that he had followed me, and emotionally compromised. I have never been caught. I didn’t have time to think it through. All I could think of was how terrified I was that this, right here, between us, that this would happen. I panicked. It was too many years of training stacking up against some very new emotional conflicts. I am truly sorry. Will you ostracize the child because of me?” She spoke with a direct dignified calm.
Mr. Wheatley looks about the kitchen in innocence as his wife glares at him. "Think I'm on for a spot of tea," he announced without offering it to anyone else.
John was a man of science. He never believed in a real hell or eternal damnation. He did have hope for heaven or at least something that could let him one day again be near the spirit of Sherlock. He didn't deserve it. He deserved Perdition. Good intentions could make that place real, but hurtful intentions made John walk boldly under the sign. Sherlock hung the sign that welcomed him to hell.
She has no idea how much time passes but he suddenly looks around fully alert and he grabs her hand and begins leading her down mews and through pass-ways. She is lost and exhausted by this sudden burst of exercise. Jolted, afraid and unable to run any further, she is wheezing by the time he shoves her through a doorway into total darkness.
In the first weeks, John faked it. He opened his eyes and parroted the things that he was expected to say. He closed his eyes and sobbed into Sherlock's pillow, begging. John offered any entity his very soul just for a year, a month, a week, a chance, a single fucking day to spend with him. So much needed saying and he'd never get the chance.
John walked out of the shower, feeling slightly better but still as if the world had ended and he was the only person who realised it. He found Mary sitting with tears ruining her mascara and he smiled at her.  She had been the strong one the past few weeks, but now that it was all over, she would cry.
He’d worked for months by her side. It was only after she’d caught him sneaking the code to the med cart and stopped him before he did anything stupid that he ever really spoke to her. She had assumed that he was stealing them to sell, but it dawned on her that John was not nervous even when she caught him. He’d looked like she’s taken his last hope.
"I am not dead. I am very much alive which I will be forced to prove if you don't put down that syringe. Now, John. Do this for me, then get over here and punch me or yell or throw me out, but I will not have you become lost to me in this way."
"I know their work too. They are all different, puzzles, fascinating, brilliant and stupid. They all think they will get away with it. They all think they are smarter than everyone. But they aren't smarter than me. They murder people and I stop them. I solve their puzzles and follow all the details and it always leads me right to the solution. I love the clever ones as much as I want to make them stop the cleverness. There's the rub. I play the game and by winning, I lose. I have to wait for another clever opponent to randomly show up before I can play again. Oh, but there is nothing like the hunt. I live for it. Well sometimes, when the idiot system will let me. Right now I'm on the rough a bit, because my friend at Scotland Yard is being a selfish tosser. Won't let me in the crime lab."
“Yes. Read about your…ummm. Expertise, in the tabloids. I don’t think I could ever live up to…urrmm. Right. Any plans to be engaged a little more privately? Any time soon? To someone else, perhaps?” John stammered with discomfort.
Sherlock made his first transport adjustment in the cab on the way. The rush of clarity and relief made him shiver.
Sherlock stood holding his violin, plunking strings and adjusting things, obviously displeased at the state of his beloved instrument.
Mycroft’s breath hitched and he was stunned by the implication.  “But, Sherlock, he’s still human.  How can you even consider.  We have no idea his awareness level.  I can’t allow it.  That you would torture him, of all people.  I don’t know what to say to you.”
“Oh, Sheryl. Bless your cold little heart. I can’t use this against you. Because it’s not a lie. That was the whole point. Teaching you not to lie to me.” She sits down carefully and takes his hand.
He growled again and with enough force to move her six inches, he impaled her on his flesh. She cried out in surprise and a little pain, but this unquenched desire she's had forever is swiftly washed in grief and urgency. Molly wrapped her legs around him and encouraged his manic lust. It was not gentle or sweet or a fantasy. Instead it was greedy and nearly silent and edges on violence, yet the thought of him for so many years brought her to the brink and she doesn't fight it. She smiled and then she stopped breathing and closed her eyes, shuddering beneath him, and when she finally breathes it came out with an animalistic energy she can't contain.
"I solved the case. I caught his killers. It was all I lived for. I had a rough time once they were all punished, once the job was over, but it helped. I could breathe again. I felt this pleasure, like maybe he was pleased. It was almost like he was proud of me. And I met the Missus and settled down to a house and kids and normal. If you can find one thing that matters. It might keep you from your constant dwelling on fault long enough to get you past the worst of it. I can't lie to you. It won't ever go away all the way. But, it gets more manageable. "
He'd seen John angry only a few times but the quiet control of it concerned him. He always wondered what would happen if John actually lost control. He wondered if the most lethal player was John or James. He'd concluded it was James. John had too many chivalrous notions of fair to beat James.
He knew he had treated her abominably, and he knew she would never forgive him. She would not tell on him either. She would not play the woman scorned and reveal he was alive to anyone ever again. It would probably cross her mind, and if Sherlock were the only thing betrayal would render of consequence, at this point, she might tend her bitter stew long enough to seek revenge.
His smile faltered, then his face fell and he had to sit down to keep from falling. This couldn't be. Why? Sherlock couldn't make out the words swimming and blurring before him. It was a mistake, he had to have read this wrong.
Ford's eyes narrow as if it's just dawned on him that John is possibly filtering his comments. "Not what you said two days ago. Why has your tune changed? Is it just because he's my son, or did you bribe an angel for a task of penance while you were checked out on me?" Ford asked. "You don't have to speak kindly of him for my sake. "
John returned a few minutes later with the note in his hand. Rat has disappeared, but before John has had time to process all the bad things an unattended Rat might cause, he reappears in the sitting room and takes a seat in Sherlock's chair. His cloths are freshly pressed and dry, having hung in Sherlock's closet for the last year.
“He’s coming round. If you want to…try not to upset him?” John informed Mycroft as he stood on the steps of the plane. John ducked back inside and Mycroft followed.
Mary folded her hands and looked at John sheepishly, as if she found something charming in his words. “You are not looking at it the right way. I can’t answer why he did it. It’s not always a simple thing as you probably know right this minute. But look at the three most important things there. You were the last person he ever spoke to and that means you were all that mattered in his darkest moment of life.”
He walked away, no longer able to imagine his voice and unable to admit that no matter how close he held him, no matter how he grew like him, John knew he was losing him. He would forget him someday and it hurt that bits of the man he loved could slip.
"Look. It isn't the end. I know what he thinks, and what he's told you, but I have only stayed because you are here," John told him this quietly and tried to get Sherlock to raise his head and look at him.
John takes a step forward. "You want me to train him. That was his first lesson. Successfully executed, I might add."
The picture of that image made him squirm in the chair slightly, his knob casting its vote on the matter with out hesitancy.    He lifted his leg slightly and opened his eyes, to see nurse Vanderhorn standing over him.
“Mary was never freelance. She called herself that to protect her employer because she was trusted with delicate situations far too sensitive to have a paper trail back to anyone in an official capacity. During her employment, against most directives and displaying spectacularly poor common sense, Mary and the person responsible for her, became friends. She and Mary connected, if you will. Both very lonely and living lives of extraordinary power, I am sure that somehow together they could be girls, so to speak. A friendship so deep that one would do almost anything to protect the other.” Sherlock said carefully.
"This isn't how I meant for this to turn out. I wanted him to know, he'd made a mistake, leaving me behind. I did prove the point. I could have helped."
Molly stood with her mouth open then burst into tears. "He passed away, four weeks ago." She managed to say with some small amount of dignity. She sat down next to him and he watched her cry. He sat up and pulled his feet in toward his body, perching like a gargoyle watching a wedding, and rested his head on his knees and stared at her. He made no comment, nor any move to comfort her. She appreciated the fact he didn't give her any sympathy. People feeling sorry for her just made it harder to stop crying and she hated to cry in public. She got herself under control and looked down at the sandwich in her hand. "Sorry. Want half?" she offered.
Sherlock pulls the syringe from John's hand and throws it, then smiles and sighs in relief. "I believe you mentioned my ability to be impossible at least once a week, thus proving my factual and obvious proof of what I just said. I am here. You are here. We are both alive. I am unable to fathom what could be going on in that funny little head of yours that you would, after all this time, choose now to become sodden in despair and force me to reveal that you have frightened me enough for one evening and I am simply thankful that your little subterfuge did not go unobserved. Now shall we have a chat, or must I restrain you until we sort this out?"
“John?” He hears his own voice crack on the words and winces. He doesn’t think he has ever been so uncomposed in John’s presence before, at least not like this. John walks towards him crouching down just a few feet away and he doesn’t say anything, barley even breathes. He has solider face on and Sherlock struggles to deduce what could be so important he would leave his own reception for unless… oh fucking hell he is going to kill Mycroft.
He presses his fingers into his temples with a force almost hard enough to hurt. He is starting to get a headache and the last thing he needs right now is something else to keep him from focusing on the work. And there it is again the reason why he never allowed whatever had almost happened that first night between him and John. The damn work. Oh Sherlock loves it, always has and always will. But at the moment he wishes vehemently that the work could move to another plane existence. Just until he figures out what to do about John, because at the rate they are going one of them is going to end up against a wall. Whether they're being kissed or hit by the other, well that depends on everything else.
