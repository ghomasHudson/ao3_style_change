“He’s a consulting detective who is amazing with his deductions but so rude to everyone except his flatmate,” Phil told John. “I would definitely want to be friends with the bloke if it weren’t for all his rude comments.” John froze, not sure how to respond. How would Philip know his flatmate? It didn’t make sense.
?” Before John could really get into a full-on angry speech against Mycroft, there was another knock on the door. Confused, John opened it to reveal an ordinary delivery man carrying a box the size of a small suitcase. Before John could tell the delivery man that he had the wrong flat, the delivery man spoke.
Ian Watson stopped hunting after his wife’s passing, heart-stricken with the pain of having to off his own wife, and he banned hunting for his remaining two children. When he wasn’t working as a moving real estate agent, he was home wallowing in sorrow. Harry Watson avoided her father and remaining brother like the plague, staying late at friends houses and going to parties just for an excuse to stay out of their quiet, too large empty house. When she wasn’t partying or drinking, Harry hunted, defying her father. Searching the woods at night and hiking the mountains with a set of knives and a loaded gun in her backpack. Countless times, John had packed his own bags, ready to set out with her. But Ian always caught him by the scruff of his neck, tossing him back into his room with a rough hand. Years went by like this and the home grew darker as time went on.
They took things from the poolside to the pool house. Then they took it to their bedroom. For the rest of the afternoon and evening they went at it, taking short naps and gaps between rounds and continuing again.
“But then…. Sherlock please wait, we can talk about this. There is something you ought to know please, give me……”
There was nothing Sherlock could refuse at that point to John and soon he dropped his clothes, standing as naked as the other man, flushed pink all over and biting down on his bottom lip. The look of appraisal in his eyes was mirrored by a similar look of admiration in John’s and Sherlock felt both proud and relieved. He felt validated in some way!
“Well, it will be if I tell John the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God,” Sebastian raised his right hand in the manner of taking an oath.
He started a video on his phone and John watched over his shoulder. It was an old video, at least ten years old, because Greg Lestrade looked mighty young in that one. He was speaking, which was the first part, then two actors enacted a scene with Greg’s voice on a narrator mode in the background. John listened and watched carefully.
“Good grief, what’s wrong with these animals,” said the man as he gave them an apologetic smile, “Dumb they are at times, sorry sir, usually it’s not like that…..”
But Jim popped up and stopped him. Behind Jim were John and Mary, both giving him meaningful glances. “Okay don’t say anything,” he began, in a low whisper so nobody but those four heard him, “Let me guess…. Or actually, give my verdict. That priceless ring was never meant to sit on her finger. You removed it before she could even bring up the engagement topic. That explains why the ring box is still in your pocket but the ring is not. You intend to re-propose to your wife as she and you divorced in a hurry and regretted it in leisure. You also want to compensate Irene for her loss and her trouble tonight. I think her payment is sitting there in that corner.”
John smiled a genuine smile but Sherlock shivered at the mere implication behind those words. He rose to his feet swiftly and gestured at the door, “Alright, shall we?”
“I would have,” Sherlock snapped at him, “If one answer was enough for you. But it apparently isn’t. You need to hear it several times from me or maybe you just don’t wanna believe me but want me to keep repeating it. So here goes, one more time, we are doing The Right Thing.”
- Trend continued with John ordering in meals and Mrs. Hudson supplying the rest. I guess my husband loves me very much and doesn't want me to work on a Sunday. But late into the evening we were hungry as we watched television. We had stayed in bed and gone for three rounds around noon, resulting in oversleeping due to post-coital laziness, which had led to a missed lunch.
When he stepped back into the room, ten minutes later, she was already in her embroidered silk robe and nursing a cup of coffee. “Yours,” she said, handing him a mug, vapors still rising from it. He took it awkwardly and put it on the nightstand, choosing to wear his clothes first. For some reason he felt very naked and exposed. He had expected she would fall asleep and he would quietly sneak out…..
I got up. Then I heard suckling sounds and grinned. One little chance at teasing him which I was reluctant to give up on, especially it was such a rare and hard-to-find opportunity. “Yes I suppose we should. But does this mean you will keep fellating the candy cane all along?”
Sherlock nodded and tried to kiss John but the man pulled back abruptly, gently putting his hands on Sherlock’s chest to keep him at an arm’s length. When Sherlock gave him a startled look he whispered, “Don’t get me wrong baby. I really want to kiss you but I don’t feel very good doing that when…. When I am like this, a drifter, dirty and smelly and haggard.” He saw how Sherlock began to protest that and stopped him with a finger on those bow shape lips, “Nah, don’t even try to lie to me. I can see myself in the mirror over there. I look horrible, I could be a stand-in for Jack the Ripper in some film, Mr. Hyde in that novel or some monster in a cartoon series.”
Sherlock jumped down and the knife slashed part of his hairs and, missing him by a whisker, landed straight on the main lines. The electricity crackled, sparks flew and suddenly the place was plunged into darkness.
But I have no bloody idea how the murder was committed. In the absence of the murder weapon the culprit will go scot-free Jawn!”
Mycroft nodded, realizing that was the untold truth of Jim’s life. Having lost his folks at age twelve, he had inherited a sizeable estate from them and tons of loneliness and solitude. Being the only child all the family he had was an eccentric and mentally ill aunt who kept moving between normalcy and mania and Jim had to be packed off to boarding school to avoid getting bruised by her ‘less than pleasant’ phases.
It was her jewelry and art room. Aside from a wall spanning safe with a combination lock, there were locked glass showcases covering one half of the room and at least a dozen paintings and sculptures hung on the wall or placed on pedestals and shelved in the other half. The younger man realized that the paintings were quite pricey. He saw the signatures of artists, mostly from the fifties to the nineties, in the upper or lower corners of the canvas or glass.
Fifteen minutes later, as the two men sat on their bed, Sherlock nibbling on the cookies and sipping the milk and John having some tea, the doctor couldn’t help but ask that burning question. “Why did you tell Claire to give up on her love just so she can lead a….an easy life. Her brother is trying to kill her just because she wants to live with a woman and….you actually took up for her brother?! This is….so last century, so medieval…..was that a test of some sort, some way to understand her better?”
“No, I just meant to say…..” she was taken aback and fumbled for the right words, “That-that it’s not good for your image and if I were to go back home with you tonight, it would be an awkward situation with another man present there, that’s all.”
“You be here….um, I need to….erm….go to Mrs. Hudson’s for a bit…..see if she needs anything for tonight’s dinner.”
“Sherl please,” John said in a tight voice, turning his head sharply to one side, he grabbed Sherlock by his hairs and pulled him up, bringing him right at his face level, “I really need to do this and do you hard! May I?”
Mrs. Hudson was tending to the herb garden next to the kitchen, a part of the kitchen as well as the conservatory, acting like a separator at one point. There were many herbs there which she grew and nurtured with her own hands every single day and the produce was used prodigiously in the kitchen. From rosemary, thyme and sage to mint, cilantro and parsley, Chinese herbs like spring onions and Italian herbs like basil, even some rare types like borage and anise hyssop. As she put down her little shovel and reached for an anti-fly spray, someone handed it to her.
Sebastian frowned and stepped forward, “I am afraid I don’t like riddles very much my good sir. Please be clear as to what you wanna say and that would save both of us some precious time. We will be played? By whom? Is it about the murders and attacks and stalking we have heard of in this village of late?”
“I apologize, yes I should have. But you must understand, for a month I have been looking for a way to talk to you but couldn’t find a single way to spend a few minutes alone with you. Either your brother or your father blocked my way.”
John steered the car through the London traffic which was predictably worse just before Christmas. Next to him Sherlock was quite annoyed and agitated.
While John had enjoyed the evening it had also been too heavy for him. All the information download about Sebastian, Jim, Mycroft and later about him, Sherlock and Mary, he was dumbstruck and also a bit brain-drained. His head felt light, his gut heavy, his limbs were fidgety as if something needed to be done to release the tension contained in them. Eventually the conversation had veered towards army days, old colleagues and funny stories but the remnants of the earlier topic lingered on in his mind.
The priest looked around and grinned, obviously noticing Sherlock’s discomfiture and the fumbling and mumbling. “Yes you, there aren’t any other people around here is it?” His tone was jocular, “You just need to hold the ladder, that’s it. Game?”
“Ohhhnnnn,” Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut, grimacing beautifully with the need to cum, “Oh yeah, don’t stop.”
He heard a soft sound of disgruntlement and for the first time his nerves faltered, albeit slightly.
A howl came out of Sherlock and the next moment he almost went into some sort of seizure. He went taut as a bow, drool dripped from the corner of his mouth, his arse clenched near painfully around John and he exploded with the might of a nuclear weapon. It was an experience like nothing else and as he went down on the mattress, taking John down with him, it was a hard time for the older man to stay inside as the detective babbled and screamed and shook like a fish out of water.
“My clever little cookie,” John giggled and they kissed again, irrespective of their growling stomachs the first attention was given to the morning wood that each man was sporting down below. Sherlock began to hump John and John had just started to thrust up, bringing their straining erections delectable friction by constant rubbing and frottage, when the door opened and in walked Mary with a trolley heaped with various food items. She gasped, screamed and turned around, then scuttled out like a frightened rabbit without even a backwards glance. Before the door closed she called out ‘Next time lock the door you shameless insatiable men’.
“I thought you didn’t want to hear my voice or see my face. Is it about what happened in the store room/ safe room last afternoon?”
John looked up and smiled at the enthusiastic young man. He was exercising in the gym a couple of days later when Sherlock paid him a surprise visit, with Mike Stamford right on his heels. “Guess what, that fellow Aaron Lockhart has been cheating and swindling you of several million,” Sherlock spoke animatedly, “For the past seven years he has been doing this, giving you details of multiple deposits but all made to the same account. He has been using some names as a cover, then from the backend he’d transfer it to his wife’s name or that of his daughter.”
The next to find out was Mrs. Hudson, who John found out is a witch who specializes in healing remedies. John and Mrs. Hudson decided to keep each other’s secret pasts from the rest of London, including Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson knew John would know Latin but she never knew how much he knew until she walked in on her boys talking to each other in Latin. Sherlock was completely focused on a particularly difficult case when Mrs. Hudson walked in with tea. John got up from his chair to allow their landlady to sit comfortably. Sherlock was muttering to himself and not paying any attention when John gave Mrs. Hudson a mischievous look, holding a figure to his lips. John started talking to Sherlock in Latin, telling the consulting detective to take a break and drink some tea. Mrs. Hudson had to hold back her giggles as Sherlock was oblivious to the exchange. She loved listening to her boys speak Latin, even if she doesn’t hear it often.
“I’m not gay!” John shouted at the criminal, never noticing the quick sorrowful look Sherlock shot his way.
“If there is, then someone will have to sacrifice their life,” John groans, hating this topic. Mrs. Hudson, John knew, was the only witch he would ever trust.
He thought he was ready, after all, he’d been preparing, training his whole life, it seemed. But he wasn’t, nothing could have prepared him for the smell, for the sight, for the sound of bodies at varying states of decay, being torn into by jagged fangs. He managed but escaped by luck alone. John spent a good portion of that night retching into a bush, and sewing up gashes on his arms, legs, and chest. When he finally returned home, he was scolded nonstop by his father and nursed back to health by a disgruntled Harry.
A couple weeks later, John was visited by one of Choronzon’s lackeys while Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson was away. The demon offered to break the curse on John in exchange for his soul. The good doctor hesitated for a moment before refusing wholeheartedly. He refused to allow a demon to help him break an unbreakable curse. Mrs. Hudson later comforted the poor doctor.
His first boyfriend nearly committed suicide because of failing grades before John talked it over with him and decided they needed time apart. John’s next girlfriend cheated on him for money. Then John and his first boyfriend got back together and John was too late to save him from suicide. John’s next relationship was with a girl who ended up being addicted to drugs and was later expelled when a teacher overheard her trying to get John to try drugs. Then there was the boyfriend who got cancer and died after. To finish off his University years, John dated a girl who cut everyone out of her life shortly after her parents died.
Other than that, John excelled in school and found an informant named Philip that John would go to during hunts for information. Philip, or Phil, and John never physically met or give each other their last names but they did talk over the phone regularly and soon became friends. John made sure he was always at the top of his class and decided to go into the Military with his medical degree. Thus meeting his next boyfriend, a fellow Sargent who went insane during training one day. At this point, John decided to wait on finding a relationship until he returned home. That lasted shortly before he was promoted Captain and he met Sholto. Then Sholto’s accident happened and John could no longer have him.
“Foeda omnia velis curam rerum articulo mortis passuri. Qui curat nisi pariter possit resistere morte solvatur maledictio.”
“Phil, there is only one consulting detective in the world. How do you know my flatmate?” John asked, hoping Phil isn’t possessed by a demon. Philip was quiet for a long time before he finally spoke.
“You possessed Jim Moriarty,” John growled out, backing up to make sure he had the option to run up the stairs to his room if needed. Mycroft would usually butt in about now except he was too busy gaping at the black eyes of the delivery man.
John took a deep breath and decided to take charge of things. “Mrs. Hudson, call your boy gang to clean this up,” he said gently pushing her out of the room, “And lower that gun, I doubt if it still works.” She complained about Sherlock being so rude and violent and destroying the wallpaper to which John said he would draw something with spray paint around those bullet holes and make it look like a smiley face. “I won’t let it stand out in an ugly manner, don’t you worry, let’s get creative,” he soothed her, “As for him, I think it’s hunger pangs plus anger due to being at home all the time. He is ‘hangry’.”
Sherlock looked rather hurt and confused at that sudden, loud question. “Why are you so agitated?” He asked in a small voice, “Tell me James, why are you so eager to see your own man sleep with another one?”
John had always identified as a straight man but that didn’t mean he didn’t appreciate the natural beauty or appeal in a man. He was not from the spectrum of toxic masculinity where it was a taboo to even talk about beauty or elegance, unless one was commenting on a woman’s breasts or her revealing outfit.
Where the hell did he go off? What could have been so important? Jim can be such a cavalier in his ways at times, damn! Sebastian was a courageous former soldier and generally a very brave and adventurous man but when it came to the man he loved, he was like anyone else weakened by his heart and emotions. He began to assume some doomsday scenarios even as his rational mind told him Jim knew these parts and was perfectly safe here, safer than he was in fact! As he jumped from rock to rock, almost slipping into the water once, he kept calling out to Jim constantly. Thankfully for him, before he had really started to panic, he heard a response to his calls finally.
Jim began to laugh. An offended Sherlock snarled, “What’s so funny? My accusation that you are a dominating alpha? Well, that you are….”
“As we were returning and we crossed Hope Hill, we saw a similar creature in the woods, mourning. That was when we knew something was wrong, the evil that had attacked us was not gone yet.”
Jim gave him a wistful glance, “Luck isn’t a word that we have ever known to be on our side Sherlylocks. We have to do the best with whatever we got, which is our brains and each other.”
, with the dirt-cheap accommodation, the well-paid job, the disability assistance sum sitting pretty in his bank and the average but decent pension amount also hitting his account every month.
“In my case there was no one left to make it up to. Hence I chose strangers. The first case was quite okay actually. An old man of about sixty six lived with me here for three months until he felt better both in body and mind, learned how to operate a computer and then got a work-from-home job in accountancy. He even met a woman around the same age and she moved in with him, sharing the household chores and expenses as she was also earning, she used to bake and sell from home. A happy ending if I may put it that way.”
“Yes sure,” John said and walked back into the flat. He spent an agonizing night, awake and wondering whatever the hell was going on, repeatedly trying Sherlock’s number and reaching his voice mail every single time. He thought about leaving a message but knowing Sherlock it would only annoy the detective more, so he held back. Whatever they had to discuss was best done face to face.
“I’d do one thing though, in addition to two steps I have already taken, I’ll take out restraining orders against them,” John added as Sherlock luxuriantly stretched out on top of him like a second layer of blanket, “I have legally disowned Sebastian as a cousin and relative, depriving him from any claims whatsoever in the future. I have also changed lockers, pass codes and every other security details and physical location of assets that they could try and steal.”
“Yes of course,” John replied, “The one where we had no chances of winning and yet you felt we shouldn’t give up our claim? What about it? The case was supposed to go on for six months to a year, isn’t it?”
“Sherlock,” John hissed as they hid behind two cars while the psychopathic, out of control assassin prowled around looking for them, “Let’s leave. We can get out that way. We will have to do this another day. He is armed.” He saw Sherlock point with his eyes at John’s pistol and sighed, “I know I have a gun too but we aren’t murderers. We have all the evidence, now the French police will have to do their job. Sherlock, he’s getting closer, before he shuts off the exit we need to make a move.”
Irene closed her eyes and prepared for death. She was facing one of the beasts who was approaching her while snarling intermittently, not a sound coming from the steps it took, it’s soft treading belying the danger it signaled.
“That’s enough, please shut up now,” Sherlock pushed past him, feeling queasy in the stomach. Would John really do something like that? “I am sure if I say ‘no’, John will back off. He is the roses and champagne, ring and dinner date kinda man. Not a man-whore.”
We got there every month you know. Just to be there for a few days. We don’t go there because we want to remember because nothing is forgotten. The memories are as fresh as they were a year ago. I don’t think we will ever forget. I am not trying to make our loss seem extra special. People lose partners all over the world, some even prematurely so. Sometimes tragically too. But in our case it was something different, something out of the ordinary, pretty much like what our men were. Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, the most amazing man I have ever met in my life. I am sure Sebastian would say the same about Jim and only I know how he feels.
“Yes, I do actually. Don’t worry, it’s fine. We will meet tomorrow. I won’t come back there I guess, right?”
Except that, right as the two men had showered, shaved and dressed for the day and were about to leave, two women showed up at the flat at the same time, both bearing gifts for John Watson. As the startled John recognized them as cousins whom he had met at a party months ago and then had separate short flings with, the two women seemed just as surprised to see each other there. “Janet, what are
Sherlock sucked insistently and by the time John managed to pull back he had already begun to cum. He had lasted barely a minute and while he was disappointed, he was also relieved. It felt like a huge weight had lifted from his lower torso and he could move without agony.
“You can check my house, my bags and my bank balance, you’ll see that I have neither the cash nor the necklace,” Sherlock moved closer to John but the man pulled back with such hatred in his eyes that the younger man stopped in his tracks, his heart clenching painfully in his chest. He wanted to cry but couldn’t. He just felt dizzy and it was difficult for him to breathe.
From that moment John thought his life had taken a definite turn for the better. Speak of the unexpected! It turned out that Sherlock’s colleague, another young professor by the name Victor, had purposefully put the idea in the minds of the Board that their founder should be gifted something extra special for his seventieth birthday and since he was a Lego lover, a life size statue of himself in Lego would be the best. The birthday was two months away, so they better get on with it. He had also convinced them to put Sherlock on the job and make him place the order in person with Magnussen, Stamford & Watson Private Limited.
“You deliberately parked the car so close to mine that I couldn’t even open my door properly, I had to get out the other side. Just a few more inches and people could get by a lot easier.”
“Are you out of your mind Dyson? Waste this awesome leaf….. They call it the first flush of autumn, a very rare blend of sweetness and slight wood and vanilla taste….. If you’re not drinking it then I am. I am thirsty. I missed this tea…..”
John remembered at that point about Moriarty’s gift and quickly reached out for it. It was on the floor at that point but fortunately, within reach. Otherwise John didn’t have the strength to get out of bed right now. He tore at it clumsily, his movements still not coordinated, and found a large, curved and most spectacular looking toy. Purple in color, ribbed for maximum satisfaction and with a small device to make it vibrate against the prostate, it was indeed something guaranteed to spice up anyone’s sex life as long as they didn’t mind the size and intrusion that came with it. “Look at this,” he showed it to Sherlock, “I am sorry….I was so excited to see you I didn’t even check on this at all. Maybe we can try it on you later baby, I promise. Right now I am useless at anything, I can’t even try if I wished to.”
He found Mrs. Hudson’s flat locked. Scratching and tugging at his T shirt and pants he stepped out and walked into the café beneath their flat and bought two portions of Weekend Brunch specials. Egg and bacon sandwiches, sweet cream filled pastries, a tumbler of Mimosa, sausages and mash and gravy and a quiche and slaw on the side. He brought it back to the flat, poured them into dishes and bowls and glasses, placed them on a tray and took it to the bedroom.
As an answer he felt cum spurt out between his bodies, over his fingers, a stray shot hitting Sherlock’s chest.
Mrs. Hudson had tears in her eyes. Sherlock felt his heart break. Even the normally staid Haines seemed surprised at how little this man expected in terms of hospitality. “No,” it was Ben who spoke surprisingly, “You will be given a guest room sir. I am taking your bag up there, to your room upstairs on the first floor.”
Then there was The Great Game and all of the bombings. Nearly dying at the pool only to be saved by a phone call. Next was meeting The Woman, the dominatrix, and her false death. John was in for a shock when she asked John to find her son and even signed over custody to John to protect her son. Unfortunately, John still hadn’t found said missing boy but was surprised to find that the boy’s name was Henry Isaac Moriarty.
When they had first met Jim at the pool, John had a feeling that Moriarty was more dangerous than he seemed. He didn’t realize it then but it was his hunter instincts screaming at him to notice the demon. Now it was too late to save Sherlock. There was no questioning it. John was going to avenge Sherlock even if it kills him.
before the war. Though, I have to admit,” said the demon, almost coyly. “It was a shame to put a stop to such an
“Hello again, Johnny Boy,” he says, eyes going black. “It’s nice to see you without Sherlock nearby.” John is confused before he realizes, his hands curling into fists as understanding overtook him.
During one of John’s hunts, he ends up meeting a colony of vampires. It was half a year after John met the Winchesters and he was taking a summer trip alone before he started his senior year of high school. John traveled away from London and headed for Nottingham, defeating any monsters he came across along the way. The Alpha, Martin Nassir, managed to pull John to the side and explain that his family feed off of the blood back and wild animals. John did stay skeptical until he met the other hunters that were in town. Once he learned more about the hunters he decided to help save the vampires, who thanked him by adopting him into their family. They even decided to help support John through college as he started working to a medical degree a year later.
John and Sherlock had been chasing a criminal around London all day. Just a petty thief that was difficult to catch. Sherlock and John watched as the criminal was shoved into the police car, the criminal grumbling about getting caught by ‘Sherlock and his boyfriend’.
The last to find out was Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade. The DI had come to the flat to get the information Sherlock was gathering while the consulting detective was being a prat. Sherlock was completely focused on the case and John was getting annoyed with Sherlock and Greg’s bickering. So John took Lestrade’s side and told Sherlock to stop being annoying. Surprising Greg when he heard another language come out of John’s mouth. Later, Lestrade pulled John aside and asked where he had learned that from.
I have returned to this story but the chapters will be infrequent still. I'm going to update the current chapters before posting more.
Mrs. Hudson showered him with sorrows the moment John walked through the door. The doctor comforted his landlady until her sobs subsided. He then told her about the sulfur and how he is planning to go after Moriarty. She encouraged him before John sent her to her flat, promising to have a cup of tea with her shortly, just as they heard a knock on the front door. He walked over to the door, his shoulders never relaxing since Bart’s, and opened the door to see Mycroft standing there. The two gave each other wary greetings before John allowed the elder Holmes to enter. The two stood by the stairs as they talked.
on repeat. He had kept his distance. He had made sure Sherlock didn’t know about the curse. He had tried to tamp down his love for Sherlock. He had hoped the curse wouldn’t react to his love for Sherlock. Now Sherlock was dead.
“Um… mmm. You… you told me once that you weren’t a hero. Umm… there were times I didn’t even think you were human, but let me tell you this: you were the best man, and the most human… human being that I’ve ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, and so… There.” John lets out a breath, refusing to admit that it was a whimper as he steps closer to the headstone and places his fingers on top of it. “I was so alone, and I owe you so much. Okay.” John started to turn away when his gut told him to stay. That there was someone nearby, listening. He surveyed the land and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. John then stared at the headstone in front of him and a thought occurred to him.
One day, Sherlock was being especially annoying and John was venting about it to Phil. Soon enough, John found out that Phil knows a similar person who sounded just as bad as his flatmate.
John quickly grabs the elder Holmes’ wrist and proceeds to drag Mycroft out of harm’s way and up to his room. Mycroft was shouting the whole way up and asking John what Choronzon is and what is going on. Once at the top of the stairs, John fumbles with his key before quickly thrusting it into his bedroom lock. John and Mycroft barely make it into the room before Choronzon catches up to them. John dives for his hunting bag but it flies out of his hands due to Choronzon’s power just before the demon unknowingly steps into the Devil’s Trap, making John smirk and break Mycroft’s brain further.
As time went on, John’s family wasn’t the only one affected. John found out that his girlfriend of one and a half years moved across seas and could no longer stay in contact with John. Then his next girlfriend turned out to be psychotic and murdered any girl she saw as a threat. Thankfully she was placed in an asylum shortly after John broke up with her. When the young soon-to-be doctor started his years at Bart’s University, he realized that he was bisexual and started going out with guys as well as girls. However, his luck with relationships seemed to stick with him.
“No…” John tried to crush the hope that was slowly rising in his chest. He was sure it wasn’t possible. The hunter surveyed the area again and still didn’t see anything. “Please, there’s just one more thing, mate. One more thing, one more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don’t… be…” John takes a breath and feels it quiver. “Dead. Would you do…?” He takes another breath, beginning to feel ridiculous. “Just for me, just stop it. Stop this.” John then turns away to head back to the flat with Mrs. Hudson, never seeing the one and only consulting detective shed a tear for his friend. Never seeing the longing to just walk over and hug his doctor. Never seeing the sadness in Sherlock’s eyes.
Over the next two weeks, the trio would get to know each other and quickly become friends. They exchanged numbers so they could still contact each other when the Winchesters finally went back to America.They even managed to send a few letters to each other and would help each other out when they needed it. The trio continued hunting in their separate countries over the many years that the boys knew each other.
“Paranoid little human, aren’t you?” Choronzon teases as he studies the almost decorative lines cleverly hidden.
John took a cab home and Mrs. Hudson rushed to him, finger to her mouth to keep him quiet. She ushered him into her kitchen to get his patch work done and told him Sherlock was home looking for clues on the case. The two, as they wait for the soother to finish, talk about random things, eventually leading back to John’s curse. John had only told his friends that already knew about the supernatural world about his curse and each one was sure John could find a way to break it.
Not long after John turned 17, he and his classmates were invited on a field trip to a local museum, which had been known for electrifying deaths in the basement. No one knew how the victims keep dying so they ensured the basement was blocked off at all times. It was this day that John met Sam and Dean Winchester, who were 10 and 14 respectively. Sam and Dean were spending their free time trying to sneak into the basement to hunt the ghost when John caught them.
During his time as an army doctor, John would help war ghosts move on while also fighting off the enemy and patching up his comrades. He was a very busy doctor. There was one ghost that refused to move on and helped John get other ghosts to move on. The two were fast friends and even told John that one time the good doctor accidentally, miraculously, killed a reaper that was going after one of his mates while John was busy patching up another soldier. It scared the reaper’s student half to death and he fled. This friendly ghost even knew a little bit of Latin and helped Watson carry out longer conversations, although he was still very shaky when he talked.
“Sulfur,” John whispered, eyes widening. This was a demon’s doing. A growl escaped his throat as he stood and swiftly left the roof before anyone could see him. John muttered and cursed himself all the way back to Baker Street. Moriarty was still alive and Sherlock was dead. John knew he wasn’t clever enough against Moriarty but he was and is a hunter. He can hunt the demon down.
The doctor nods before walking out again and taking a cab until he was a couple blocks away from the murder site, the lights of the police cars lighting up the nightly river. John made sure to stay out of sight from everyone, including Sherlock. The doctor then snatched his phone out of his pocket and texted Phil. He watched from a distance as Anderson suddenly excused himself and walked over to where John was hiding.
“I’ll help.” John lifted an eyebrow at the government man. “I’ll get you all the supplies you need but you have to work with a partner of my choosing.” The army doctor thought about it for a bit before agreeing, thinking that having the supplies needed will be more helpful than hustling pool. He then searches for some paper and a pen to write down his supplies before handing it over to Mycroft.
“And?” John just looks confused. “Come now, we met when you were merely seven,” the demon teased. John gasps, tensing as recognition sets in.
“Ah, but you are. You and Sherly were simply meant to be~” Choronzon singsonged. “Had to physically stop you two from meeting a few times over the years.” John stiffens, not believing his ears. “Oh yes, I had to stop you two from meeting in kindergarten, in middle school, in high school, even a couple of times when you were at the University. Luckily, by college Sherlock was so deep into drugs that he ended up doing most of the work for me. Although I did have to put little Harriet in jail so that you wouldn’t meet his overdosed state a few times.” John was horrified. He was supposed to meet his best friend sooner before he was cursed. Vaguely, John thought that maybe if he had met Sherlock before the witches, maybe he wouldn’t have been cursed. “I warned him, didn’t I? That I would burn the heart out of him? Although it was absolutely wonderful to hear that you had destroyed your own chances with that little…
It didn’t take much longer after that for John to find and stop the vampire male from going after another one of Sherlock’s homeless. The vampire and John battled for quite a while, the homeless staring wide-eyed in the background, before John finally used his machete to cut its head off and then tossing it into the trash to burn the body. John clutched his bleeding side, texting Mrs. Hudson to tell her he needed a patch up when he got home and convinced the homeless not to tell Sherlock what happened.
John’s fighting spirit could be blamed on his father, Ian, who was a warrior in his own right, a hunter that could rival the Winchester and Campbell name. Or the fact that the Watsons have been fighting for longer than they had been called Watsons. Or, it could be blamed on Leah and Daniel Watson, John’s mother and younger brother, on the way that John, at the tender age of seven, had to watch helplessly as his mother was murdered by his own father and his brother devoured by their mother. Some may even say that John’s fighting spirit comes from the hatred he held for the demon, Choronzon, that had initiated his mother’s change.
,’ John thought before turning his gaze up to Bart’s roof. John set his shoulders and marched inside the building, making his way up to the roof. When he finally got to the top, he saw Moriarty’s body, blood still dripping out from the hole in his head. The army doctor glared and marched over to kick the corpse for good measure when he saw it. A powdering dust on the edge of Jim’s lips. John swiped a finger across it and sniffed.
“Vampire. Definitely a vampire,” Anderson whispered once he reached John’s hiding spot. “How do you plan to kill it without Sherlock noticing? If his homeless network sees you they’ll tell him.”
John scratched his head and grinned sheepishly as he took the string from his know-it-all lover. Hard to keep secrets from the great Sherlock Holmes but as long as Sherlock played along, who really cared?!
“You’re right Jimmy. I think we have made mistakes. Inside a man there is always a tussle between human and beast, the good and the evil, the propensity to be kind or cruel. We indulged ourselves according to our own feelings, needs, urges, didn’t we?”
“No son or daughter of mine is a bloody queer, with sickening tendencies. You should be sent to a correction facility.”
“Pardon us, we didn’t mean to be rude,” Greg played good cop, “But your husband, he didn’t lose the watch did he?”
John reacted, “What do you mean simple? It is not. I am in quite a situation here. You see, there is also this woman, a very bright and nice woman, who I am sort of dating for nearly eight and half months.”
Sherlock blew the candles out in a single effort and amidst John’s cheerful ‘happy birthday to you’ song, cut a slice of cake and fed a mouthful to John before tasting it himself. “Pineapple and chocolate,” he called out in a delighted tone, “Just what I love. How did you know?”
“Oh, I am sorry. I wish I could offer the same sympathy that many do, like saying ‘she is in a better place’ and all that. But the truth is, we don’t know what happens when a person passes. For me, whatever I am able to do while I am still alive and breathing is what’s important. It’s the only life we lead and the only legacy we leave behind.”
As they left the chambers and walked down the hallway and up the steps to the first floor where all the head trauma patients and accident victims were treated, Mary kept giving him information about the man. He was a fit and healthy man, his wounds had healed almost completely, he would be released in another two or three weeks, he was an educated man with a quick and sharp mind and ready wit and he was fairly good looking too.
“Yes, who else will help when we have a walk-in customer requesting for a special Lego gift for an eminent citizen? You are not only the best Lego artist in Europe but also the art director for our business. You can have as many assistants as you wish for in order to complete this assignment. The timelines are not aggressive so you can always start a month later, after you’ve finished your current assignments. What say?”
Yes John is blind and also in denial. Sherlock is dorky and unable to express. These things don't get cured overnight. Be a bit patient with the boys. It's a slow burn!
“Then it’s a purely one-sided attraction. Best course of action and medicine for this malady – Drop it.”
Instead of stopping the younger man he pushed backwards, fucking himself on that invading muscles, encouraging his gorgeous lover to do more, delve deeper, give it to him harder and faster. He even twisted and turned and pushed back repeatedly, seeking to be brushed deep inside, that sweet spot that he wanted to stoke again and again. Sherlock, despite his inexperience, obliged him pretty well, locating that coveted spot several times. Each time his cock dragged over it, John heard himself let out animalistic yowls and hisses, the tip of his cock on fire and ice at the same time. He had become a passenger in his own body, flowing along the turbulent river of sensations, sliding down rapids and clashing with rocks.
I put in my purple shirt and John’s white shirt. I also put in my pink boxers, a gift from John, along with his grey boxers. After the wash the purple shirt and pink boxers remained the same, but the white shirt and grey boxers came out a lovely shade of mauve and violet respectively. I called John to tell him this but one of the senior nurse assistants took the message. When she heard this she started feeling unwell. Must be
“Hey you don’t need to talk to him,” he caught up with Mycroft again, “John was very clear we don’t need to engage him anymore, not even in a conversation…. He is a conman and a thief, he could blackmail John and cause him more stress…..”
Sherlock looked at John meaningfully and right at that moment both men knew it was a very good idea. John was a man who missed an element of danger in his life, Sherlock was a man who had lived on his own for too long and missed having someone around him who could be a satellite, someone who orbited around him but also had his own identity, and John seemed like the perfect candidate.
But he somehow proved himself wrong. Shortly afterwards he fell asleep again, once again without realizing when he had slipped off. This time he didn’t dream of anything, instead enjoying a deep and dreamless rest that left him refreshed and very cheerful when his eyes opened next. He felt reborn, he felt rejuvenated, he felt nice and warm and cozy.
“So it is about her, isn’t it? I knew it, I just knew it! What….what is your problem really? Sherlock, please tell me, have I ever told you I won’t date women, won’t marry, that my entire life is devoted to you and the cases we get? Did I ever promise anything even close to that?”
Jim looked at Sherlock with some surprise. He was usually the more aggressive and evil-loving of the two but that evening there was a change in Sherlock’s eyes and tone, he could sense the man was as desperate as he was. Sherlock was afraid, clearly he was, and it made him afraid too! “You are right,” he murmured, slipping into the darkness along with his best buddy, “We must do what it takes to hold on to our men and our happiness.”
He saw a man wearing jeans, sneakers and a hoodie. Even in the darkness he was wearing oversized glasses. One could hardly make out what he looked like, much less who he was. Greg spotted a French beard and nothing else. “Well Baker, I am a policeman after all so I get all kinds of visitors. Grant him access to the building. I shall answer the door only when I see he’s got real business with me. If I ask him to leave and he refuses, I’ll deal with him.”
Sherlock stood at the bus stop, staring listlessly at the bleak, gray surroundings. It had been pissing down with rain since the night before and if the weather was not depressing enough, he had just heard more depressing news. Henry, his only friend, was going away for a fortnight for work. Victor, the only colleague he got along and sometimes lunched with had also sent him a message stating he was taking some time off. He was getting engaged to his Eva.
For two hours they had been at it. Then Sherlock had literally passed out after four gigantic orgasms. But even though he had three rather huge ones himself, sleep was as far from John’s eyes as the desert was from rain. Once the mad lust had been taken care of, his brain had begun to function again.
“Care to explain what’s going on in that head of yours?” John couldn’t control his temper as he blocked his lover’s path, “You’ve been acting like a total arse for the past few days. If you’re upset with me then you need to spell out your grievance or anger, tell me what went wrong. I am no fucking mind reader. I can’t deduce like you do fuck me to hell, I need to hear it in clear, simple English.”
“Get up you lazy-arse,” the shift in charge yelled, then gave him a vicious push that made him nearly topple off the chair, “Breaking into free bread, downing bowl after bowl of soup, you third-grade freeloader, get up and do your work. Earn your fucking keep.”
They were both on the train that day, the usual one, speeding towards Sherlock college. As always Sherlock would alight two stops before John’s, John would accompany him and walk till the college gates, then take a cab or a bus and go to his office.
Sherlock turned and his expression was priceless. All his feelings summarized in just a look of disdain. “You have never heard of pemmican? Really? It is like jerky but not jerky, made of elk, moose or bison meat and berries or other flavoring agents and rendered fat, best if grass fed bison kidney fat is used. Very portable and nourishing, keeps for decades and very, very popular amongst a certain group!!”
He had called Sherlock’s number instantly but the number was unreachable. He called the next alternative number, Mycroft’s private number, but the man texted back saying he was in an important meeting with the Queen and it would take him some time to return the call. John cursed himself for not keeping Jim Moriarty’s number before it occurred to him that maybe Sherlock was at Mrs. Hudson’s. So he had rushed over to her place, ignoring the late hour, and knocked on the door. To his surprise there was no response. Frustrated, John was about to turn back to his own flat when he saw a rather startled Mrs. Hudson walking out of the elevator, eyes on him.
“No one would really keep a friend’s pic there. It’s someone who is more than a friend, at least to me he is. But I’m afraid he doesn’t feel the same way about me.”
John had to count backwards from ten to control his temper. Trust Sherlock, believe in Sherlock Holmes, have faith on your man, he counseled himself again and again but his faith evaporated and his trust failed miserably. He braced himself for a horrific evening, disappointed guests and general mockery of their household as he reluctantly began to brew some tea. But from the kitchen he could hear Sherlock as he made the first phone call.
“Yes. But more than me, it’s something that will affect Sherlock so it’s a question to be directed to him Greg.”
Honestly I am not a revolutionary or something but I find the excesses of our aristocracy a bit too affected and wasteful. I mean, he isn’t even a Duke or…..”
John pushed inside smoothly in a long and hard thrust, both men groaning out aloud at the sensations that were sparked by getting bodily joined to each other. While Sherlock lifted his legs higher in the air, John bore down harder and began to saw in and out.
“This about Sherlock and I need to talk to you right now,” Mrs. Hudson said, keeping her voice low and her room door closed as she made that phone call, “You told me to report how things are going at home with the new house guest we have at Hilltop Maison, and I have been doing so faithfully and diligently every week. Not because I am a snitch but because I adore you both equally and I know ego prevents you from addressing this directly with Sherlock, so I am happy to be a bridge. But there’s something I must let you know, something that you should perhaps be aware of and tell me if this should go on any further.
. I mean John Doe, who is he really…. But there’s always a chance they don’t have his real identity either! Anyways, we know now that Sherlock’s life might be in danger and we gotta take some quick measures to secure him.” Phil shook his head, “I don’t understand boss, how the hell are we supposed to do that? He gets irritated if we try to warn him. That man has made it very clear he doesn’t want us to interfere and naturally he will not want any of our people to be stationed there. And in case we try some trick or force and wrench that fellow away from him he’ll be far more annoyed and upset with you than he already is.”
“Two years, a little more than that really,” Jim answered, the sugary politeness in his honeyed voice making Sherlock cringe.
The next moment he was on his back on a cane lounge chair with Jim straddling him, his hands lodged around Sherlock’s throat. “Don’t you fucking talk to me like that ever again,” he warned.
Sherlock was walking back from the highway to the property, a distance of half a mile. He didn’t want to wait for Jim or Mycroft to finish their work and ride back with them, so he had taken a cab. But the cabbie was not willing to get off the highway and into a detour. “Some murder happened there,” he said, looking so scared that one would be forgiven for thinking the murderer was out for this particular cabbie’s life, “I am not going there sir.”
A blush rose up Sherlock’s cheeks and suddenly he squirmed underneath John. “Jawn, please, I need to use the bathroom.”
Sherlock being Sherlock, he started to get restless, listless and bored from the end of the very first week. He had been discharged from the hospital on the third day, morning time, and precisely three more days later he had a meltdown. John came home from work to find a room trashed, Mrs. Hudson angrily telling Sherlock to surrender his firearm whilst holding an old and barely usable shotgun in her own hands, and neighbors complaining about all the noise. “What are those things,” John asked as he stepped into the room, “You actually shot those bullet holes in the wall???”
“Unless our friends decide to take advantage of the empty house too,” Jim giggled, driving on at full speed, “Since Sherlock’s elder brother will be at home, he won’t have his house all to himself. I asked him to come over to mine with John, in case it came down to that. We have two very comfortable guest rooms for them to…. ahem….. utilize.”
Sherlock really wished he knew what was on here but, for the lack of a better option, he simply chose to carry on his investigations and not pay any heed to the playful Jim or the jokester John who were distinctly non-cooperative that evening.
“Mike might act all high and mighty and sometimes come across as downright arrogant and aggressive,” Eugenia answered evenly, “But he does have an excellent insight into people. He is a good judge of characters. He will never start something he cannot give a good conclusion to. I think we should have faith on him. As for our James being a criminal, you do know that everyone has been a criminal at some point of their lives. We have all broken or bent rules.”
“Yes, he gave me the watch and I pawned it off to get him the money. In fact he got more money than what was required for the ring so he had kept it on the side, to pay for half the wedding costs and perhaps your honeymoon. He is compromised by his memory loss but it’s a rich and sophisticated man you’re marrying Sherlock, not to mention one with a golden heart that beats exclusively for you. He could have been offended by your tactless statement but he forgave you instantly, putting it as ‘something even I would have done in his place’. Yes, those were the exact words he told me a little while ago. I was not even supposed to tell you all this but I am breaking a promise for a good reason – I don’t want you to doubt a good man. That would be a criminal offense….. in matters of the heart, that is.”
However when he came out, he got the shock of a lifetime when he found Sherlock poring over a list of ‘possible’ dishes.
“Don’t be too harsh on him, that’s all I ask. It’s not something to be shared, proudly or otherwise, and I truly believed that your company and presence has moved him quantum leaps away from that habit of his. He was clean for years and I’d expected things to remain that way.”
Moments later he came, deep down my throat, howling and growling in his usual manner. It made me so impossibly hurt I started to hurt down there but…. Something prevented me from a spontaneous orgasm. He had successfully ejaculated into my mouth, all of his juices. I didn’t mind fellating him but swallowing was not my thing. It took me some effort to not gag and keep it all down. But down I kept it and managed to plunge inside.
“Jimmy?” Sebastian was beside himself with joy when he saw his boyfriend outside his door, “Is that really you? I had dropped you home half hour ago and thought I wouldn’t see you anytime before tomorrow morning……” He was cut off by his young boyfriend who advanced on him more like a predator than prey, a suggestive smile on his expressive visage. “I hope that is not a complaint or I might just change my mind and go back,,” said the Irishman in his lilting voice, his head slightly tilted to one side and an aura of sensuality and obscenely hot appeal oozing off him like juice from a ripe fruit.
The sounds of laughter and banter filled the room as Sherlock chased the smaller man around, trying to get his cell phone back, calling him by fond nicknames and mild expletives. “Come back here you rascal, you little spider, Jimmy, Jim-Jam, stop it, I have to go back, give it back to me, no, no, not the gun. What do I need a gun for?”
Something snapped inside John and every little bit of frustration, fear and folly combined together and pushed him into making a monumental mistake. He raised his hand and struck Sherlock across the face.
“Give it a rest doc,” Mrs. Hudson called out, “There is no need to deny something that is as conspicuous as a pink elephant in the corner of a board room. Not looking at it wouldn’t make it go away, you know. Now come on, let’s help Sherlock to the bathroom. He won’t use the thing here on the bed.”
When it was all over and they were lying there, entangled and smiling and caressing each other, they felt the sunlight suddenly invade their room. At the same time somewhere in the vicinity they heard a clock strike half past seven.
“Nah,” John shook his head, “That used to be your mum, your dad. I am aware you’re not like that really.”
John literally had tears of joy in his eyes as he dropped the ‘toy’ and took Sherlock in his arms, kissing him deeply. Sherlock made a soft purring sound and whispered, “I’d still prefer to be your man though, nothing against women but I don’t think I can do this everyday.”
to share a room. Sherlock’s room had to be re-painted and some furniture rearranged and polished, since that was the very room the frustrated detective had trashed. John offered to take the couch for one night to which Sherlock asked ‘Why, when we have a double bed’.
, the one over there,” Sherlock said innocently, pointing at the huge built-in refrigerator in one corner of the modular kitchen, his expression completely neutral. He behaved as if it was the most natural thing to do, put cadavers and eyeballs in the fridge. John’s face went to pale first, then it became heated and red and finally grew almost purple with rage. “Sherlock Holmes, I don’t have many rules for cohabiting with you but three things are a total no-no. You will do
He had returned to Baker Street, worried out of his mind, hoping Sherlock was okay and had not concealed some wound he had incurred. Though he was somewhat relieved to find his Sherlock in the flat, sitting there as if nothing was wrong, as if they hadn't had a life-threatening moment an hour and half ago, as if everything was as normal as they could be on a summer evening, he was riled all over again by the way Sherlock tried to get up and walk away the moment he stepped inside.
“No, I am serious. I was doing an animal profiling. Jim is a spider, can also pass off as a fox. Sebastian is a tiger, sometimes a panther. You are a wolf at times and a hedgehog the next. Mycroft of course is a panda, no two words about that…..”
“Good luck Sherlock. I always knew you two would go well together. Sort of like Yin to Yang and also like milk and sugar. Different, yet similar, just enough differences to be interesting but enough commonalities to be the best of soulmates.”
Sherlock squirmed with embarrassment, not sure he deserved such praise or such broad hints of a sustained and established relationship with so wealthy and influential a man. But John stumped him even further with his next statement. “That’s why I thought this is a good time for you to meet him. Like you once said, ‘If you like them, put a ring on them’.”
“I have booked a suite for us at the Royal Retreat and their famous restaurant Badeaux’s will serve is a five course meal which would leave the most experienced gourmand reeling with gastronomical delight!!! We can celebrate my success and of course our relationship in mind-blowing luxury this evening. How about I send you a limousine around six and you get driven to the property? Like a prince!”
Sensing that they were winning the battle Anthea also pitched in. “I am staying in your house, I am your guest. If I can’t come to you for protection where else should I go, who else can I talk to Mrs. H?”
They exchanged a one-arm hug before Mike’s expression grew a bit serious. He looked down at John’s leg and the support he walked with and asked, “Hey, how bad is it really?” John shrugged and replied honestly, “Healing, but taking its time. Sometimes I have this shudder in my arm and right side, but it seems that’s psychosomatic. Have been visiting a shrink and she says I just need to get back into action, work and all that, which is why I am here. In terms of medical clearance and ability to do my job here, I have the necessary endorsements.”
“Myc,” he said gently, “Pull yourself together. We have to face facts. Your brothers are the miscreants behind all these incidents. They are the ones pretending to be some predatory animal and they are scaring the Bejesus out of people, especially tourists. Maybe we can counsel them and they will listen, if they promise they’ll never to do this again we can find a way to do some damage control here, mitigate the circumstances somehow.”
John watched as Sherlock’s bloody body was taken away from the scene. He felt like he was having an out of body experience as he stared after Sherlock’s body. The only thing he could think of was
John grabbed a machete, a small jar of dead man’s blood, and a lighter before racing out the door. He’s worked too hard to keep Sherlock out of the supernatural world to let it go to waste now. The doctor stopped dead in his tracks, just remembering the Mycroft’s cameras and the fact that he didn’t know where the killings were happening. John walked back inside and could see Mrs. Hudson coming down the stairs.
“No, apparently you like trickster demigods,” John teased right back. The doctor chuckled when he heard a quiet curse over the phone.
Around the middle of high school, John finally managed to break away from his father, away, even, from his sister. With only the vaguest idea of what he was doing, John caught a bus that carried him miles away from the familiar scenery of his home, and he followed a trail of gruesome, unsolved crimes through a distant countryside.
‘Get it together, Watson,’ John thought before turning his gaze up to Bart’s roof. John set his shoulders and marched inside the building, making his way up to the roof. When he finally got to the top, he saw Moriarty’s body, blood still dripping out from the hole in his head. The army doctor glared and marched over to kick the corpse for good measure when he saw it. A powdering dust on the edge of Jim’s lips. John swiped a finger across it and sniffed.
Doctor John H Watson has been fighting for longer than he could remember. He fought the doctors who helped his mother while she was in labor as John fisted his tiny hands around his cord and refused to budge. He fought his big sister Harry when she tried to dress him up like a doll. He fought his fellow preschoolers when they teased him for being so tiny. He fought his peers in elementary school when they teased him for being so tiny. He fought older, larger boys in high school when they taunted him about his (lack of) height. He even fought his father’s rules and snuck out of the house. So it was to the surprise of no one that John eventually went and joined the military later in his life.
“Choronzon,” he whispers as the demon gives a sickly sweet smile that grows into a Cheshire like grin. Choronzon then drops the box, making it fall open and revealing the butcher knives as they tumble out.
“Yeah, from what I got from Dean’s point of view, you were really hitting it off with the Trickster.” There was another curse from Sam’s end before the two men laughed and joked around for a little bit, talking about various hunts and whether Sam and Dean would be able to catch up with the demon that killed their parents. Their conversation then turns to complaining about Sherlock and Dean, as per usual. Once the two complained and laughed to their heart's’ content they signed off.
