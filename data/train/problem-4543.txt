Jesse turned out to be a regular dude. Castiel almost struggled with how to act. He was so used to it being just him and Dean that he almost forgot he should have a filter. He was glad Dean reminded him that he didn’t want to kill innocent people. Jesse didn’t deserve to die, even if he

Checkpoints for the vaccine would be all over every town by 7am and everyone would be scheduled to return to their normal duties the following day. This was good news, so why did it make Cas feel nauseous?
“You have been a good boy. You deserve a reward but if this… beautiful mouth…” Dean slid his thumb into Cas’ parted lips, “annoys me in any way, I will stop and you will not be permitted to come. Nod if you understand.” Cas nodded, no way his mouth would ruin
Cas thought as he made his way back to the shelter.
John laughed loudly and a few people turned, but Dean didn't care, he was busy getting betrayed by his own dad. “I do, and in the eighth grade you had an Eli Manning wallpaper on your phone.”
I think this chapter requires both a preemptive "I'm sorry," and a "you're welcome."
He’s there.
Cas’ happiness is evident in his smile and he leans down to kiss him again, this time much more promising. “It’s okay. We’re doing it now.”
Castiel can hear Dean was in the kitchen and snuck in his backpack, pulling out his pencil case and then the napkin inside of it. Cas used his pocket knife to cut the few pills in half, swallowed a half of each and then hid the rest back inside his backpack, before pacing the room, wishing he railed them instead.
“Hmmm…” Dean contemplated and Cas forced his mouth shut to let him think.

Dean rubbed his stomach, “Hey a man’s gotta eat, Jo.” He approached the bar and leaned against it. “Can I get three burger meals to go?”

noise. “Shit. I’m sorry.”
They made their way to the North side of town, searching for an exit, only to find a checkpoint. “Oh fuck.” Cas reached over and gripped Dean’s hand. Whatever was about to happen, would happen to them together.
Nick stared at the text and wondered if he should say anything else. Meddling wasn’t his thing, especially when it came to Cas, but maybe a gentle little nudge wouldn’t hurt.
Cas froze, missing his cue to swing. The thought of having Dean’s hands on him shouldn’t be as enticing as it actually was, but Cas blamed the tequila. Heat pooled in his gut and he bit his lip, releasing it slowly. “You can’t do both. Pick one; help me or try to beat me.”
He stifled his laugh by clamping his teeth on Cas’ chest. “Dramatic, much?” But the truth was that Dean felt the same. It was a tangible thing, his need for Cas. It sat in his core like a neutron star, dense and powerful and bright, the remnants of a fucking supernova.
“Wait, let me out. I want to go up there.” Cas attempted to open the door but it was locked. “Unlock it, Dean. Are these child locks??”
Cas stares up at America’s ass in disbelief. He already wants to hurt every person in this room that started clapping, but the sheer joy on the face of the man wearing the costume reminds him of one, very important thing: Dean Winchester truly believes that Steve Rogers
Cas pouts, but puts everything back on except for the hat. “If you can go without the mask, I can leave the hat behind.”
“He has two Superbowl rings.”
Cas didn’t know if he should laugh or flip shit over that joke. The thought of being caught made him want to puke, but at the same time. How else would
Let’s check in with our Cas...
He places soft kisses on every inch of skin he can reach without exiting him, and Cas turns his head to catch him in a real one soon enough. It’s all tongue and tugged hair and
“Mmmmm.” Cas hummed as he slid Dean down his throat, loving how he had to contract around his thick cock. Hearing Dean say that had him stroking himself faster.
Charlie raised her eyebrows with an amused expression. “I’m kidding, Dean. We started drinking over an hour ago. Come on in, Cas is... you’ll see.” She moved out of the way to let him in, and Cas was in the living room trying to play golf on Charlie’s Wii. He was half bent over, shaking his ass and holding the controller like a baseball bat instead of a golf club.
Dean’s cock pulsed at the sound of those words and he chuckled low, striking the skin again and again. “Want it harder, Cas? Think you can handle it?” He watched the globe of that beautiful ass shake and bounce under the force of the next hit, focused in the same spot.

“Nothing, Dean here is friends with the owner so we got a deal. I’m just proud of you for earning some legit money, motivated me to find a real job too, so this is our little celebration. I start on Monday.”
Cas already knew, a smile forming. “Winchester huh?” It clicked in Nick’s mind when Cas said the name. “You wouldn’t happen to know a very pretty officer that shares that name would you?” Cas shook his hand, staring up at him.
“Where at?” Cas asked with a smile, genuinely happy for Nick.
“Eat first. I’m going to shower and I’ll make breakfast in the morning.”
Thirty minutes later, they were lost.

Cas glanced down, “Oh shit, I was too focused on you.” Cas sat up and pulled himself out and began to stroke himself. “You wanted to see this?” He bit his lip.
Cas huffed a laugh, “I’m unfortunately, allergic to cats too, and yes, he is very cute. I just got over the virus, so I’m watching him closely. My apartment doesn’t allow dogs either, but the landlord happens to be my cousin, Gabriel. Sort of lucked out there. Balthazar is like my kid.”
The possibilities flipped quickly through Cas’ mind, from taking him slow and sweet to fulfilling his initial promise and fucking him so hard, he’d feel it for a week. Part of him wanted to go with the former, but if Dean was going to learn to trust him, he needed to be able to take Cas at his word.
Dean grabbed a pair of clean shorts from Cas' bag and made a mental note that they needed to do laundry again. He gave Cas quiet, whispered instructions as he slid the shorts onto his angel's body and then he turned around, scratching the back of his head. He was grasping at straws and didn't know what else to do, but he was thirsty so he figured Cas might be too. He grabbed them each a Gatorade and went back to the bed. “Orange, right?”

“What the fuck?” Dean leaned in and grabbed his face, checking out his pupils. “What the fuck!” He repeated, “you forgetting my dad is a fucking cop? Did you bring that shit here?”
“It’s just random words. Top, bottom, straight, vers. Oh, wait is this a sex thing?” Dean stared at the board and noticed all the words were in different colors… colors that matched the cups. “Bottom?! Orange is bottom?” He glanced again,

Dean swallowed his pride and sent Cas a text before he could back out.

Cas smiled back. He flashed his irresistible cerulean eyes at the man, “I’d like that.”
The top in the video bends the bottom nearly in half, and Cas shudders as his own hips leave the couch to chase his fist. He watches Dean from the corner of his eye, and the moan he releases has Cas regretting their agreement not to touch each other.

patients which proved to be helpful with his victims. He’d learned from his little adventure with Castiel that he enjoyed marking his victims, so he’d brought in a pot belly stove and an iron poker. But his crowning decoration was the cross he’d taken from the hospital’s old chapel. It rose in the corner like a totem, a reminder of everything he’d nearly sacrificed when he met his own personal angel on earth. He hoped that one day, he’d see his angel crucified on it.
“She made me.” Cas looked at him and did that friggin head tilt. “Thought you sucked at names?”
“They just didn’t see what I see in you, Dean. You’re fucking adorable.” He grinned and started singing along to the music. Everything seemed to be working out for them and Cas couldn’t help but feel hopeful for the first time in his life.
He kept his steps controlled and he smiled at her, offering a ‘thanks’ for the computer use and walking swiftly out of the library and back to the safety of his car. He called Cas’ phone repeatedly until he woke up and answered, told him to pack the rest of the shit and be out front in ten minutes, and then stepped on the gas. He had no idea if she’d told anyone or not, or if she did... how much time they had before the fucking SWAT teams descended. They needed to get out of town like

“Damn right I don't, cause I’m awesome.” He could feel himself getting sleepy, but he wasn’t ready to hang up yet. “Can I call you sometimes, Cas? Your voice is soothing.” His eyes fluttered closed, and the chance of him remembering most of their conversation was slim.
Castiel bit back a grin, happy Dean didn’t fight him on this. He reached over and put on some Zeppelin to help Dean’s mood and grabbed his hand. “You’re kinda cute too, you know.”
It was weird to be talking about it so nonchalantly, but Dean made it as easy as breathing. When the kiss ended, Cas gripped the back of Dean’s shirt to hold him close and ignored the furious blush in his cheeks as he tried to join in, saying, “Challenge accepted.”
Dean’s grip around his neck had Cas struggling to breathe, which of course, had him coming so hard you wouldn’t believe it was his third orgasm in a couple hours... had it even been an hour? Cas didn’t care, because it felt even better than the last two.
Cas gave up trying to eat his food and was biting his lip so hard it bled. He sucked at it, breathing deeply as Dean spoke. He didn’t trust his voice in that second, so he nodded, took a breath and leaned forward.
angel as his. It was frustrating in ways sex shouldn’t frustrate him.
Dean grunted, reaching down with his other hand to wrap around Cas’ cock. They hadn’t bothered with clothes since returning to the bunker, and now Dean was grateful for it. He stroked slowly, his eyes half narrowed at his angel as he closed Cas’ mouth again and began pumping his thumb. “Gonna come for me just like this?”
Dean walked over to the bed and sat down next to him. “Thought you might’ve ducked out the window or some shit.”

could.
He turned, and forced a smile. “Hello, Dean. Have a nice orgasm?” It was laced with sarcasm, but whatever. He didn’t have to be happy about it.
He packed up his things and drove back to Cas’ town without giving it much thought. He stayed in a different motel, but set up the same church. He had no idea if he’d be able to follow through this time, but it almost didn’t matter. One way or the other, he needed to look into those eyes again. It took three days of him driving past the bar where they’d met to finally see his car there. He pulled in, avoiding the cameras again, and sat in the parking lot until he finally convinced himself to actually go in.
Cas was tempted to tell
“So… I don’t think I did anything, but Jack… sorry I didn’t mean to use his name.” She waved it off and he continued. “But the student believes I helped, therefore I

Cas slid Dean inside his mouth, knowing this was about to drive him crazy. He bobbed and hummed, pulling out all of his tricks to get a reaction out of Dean, so when they finally found a spot to pull over he would be so turned on he would fuck Cas’ ass

theme to play on a loop. “It’s on now, Padawan.”
“I do Nick, and like I said, he isn’t in trouble. If anything, it’s the opposite.” Dean tried to show his sincerity so Nick would trust he was only trying to help.
He doesn’t have to specify, Cas knows what he means. “Of course. And whatever the damage is… you’ll get through it. In the meantime… take my bed.”
“Maybe it looks like he’s trying to be street but really, this is all we know, Dean.” Nick walked over to Cas and slapped the bag out of his hand he

Michael but Dean knew otherwise.
Dean pulled him in for a kiss, showing him with his lips just how much he meant to him. By the time they parted, they were both breathless, but Dean could tell Cas still wanted a real answer. “Not just as roommates, Cas. I want to live with you. I want to be your boyfriend, and maybe one day... your husband. If that isn’t where you see this goin’, tell me now.”
“Pour me some.” Dean nods at the bottle and disappears into the bathroom to piss. By the time he walks back out, Cas is on the couch with his glass against his lips and Dean’s glass on the table next to him. “Thanks.” He tosses it back and then goes to grab the bottle.
Cas frowned at him. “Are you and Nick friends now?” Since when did anyone else care about his sleep. “I didn’t count the hours okay. I’m a little distracted, they want this done for some event next Wednesday.” Cas’ tone was slightly defensive.
Cas ran a hand through his hair.
As they walked in, Dean’s eyes swept the small, dimly lit bar and clocked the jukebox in the corner. He ventured over there first, sliding a few coins into the outdated machine and selecting a playlist that he hoped would keep him calm. Cas went straight to the bar and ordered drinks, nothing too strong but strong enough that some of their rougher antisocial tendencies would be smoothed over. Cas left Dean’s drink on the corner of the bar where he could see it and made his way toward a couple of guys seated at a table. Dean unclenched his jaw as the beginning notes to Billy Squier’s

“Hero? What kinda
They eventually pulled into a sketchy looking truck stop. Dean knew from experience that these usually had showers and industrial sized dumpsters, so he parked the car out of sight from the road and grabbed some clean clothes from his bag. While Dean was inside showering, Cas grabbed some napkins and water from the bag of stuff he’d gotten at the gas station and started trying to scrub the blood from the steering wheel and door handle. It wasn’t perfect and certainly wouldn’t protect them if anyone came looking for traces, but at least Dean didn’t have to see it when he got back into the car.
If Cas picked up on that, he didn’t say it. He squirmed under Dean, greedily trying to take his fingers in deeper. He whispered, “If you don’t fuck me soon, we might as

Cas whimpered when Dean dug into the cut, it fucking stung and he had to close his eyes tightly to fight off his impending tears.
“Soothing?” Cas was quiet for much too long, Dean was nearly asleep when he spoke again. “Yes, Dean. you can call me sometimes.”
“Yes,” Cas whispers. “Absolutely.”
“Nah. Not at all, Cas. Who needs Santa’s Lay when I got the best thing that’s ever happened to me?” He laces their fingers together and sings along to
Castiel sat on his couch staring at the black tv screen.
Cas fucking nipped his hip and pulled away, back to that predatory stance above Dean. “Are you sure you want me to wait?”
“That could work... if your imagination is better than mine, anyway. I meant... together. But not together,” he clarifies quickly. “Just... next to each other.”
Castiel hummed again. “I’m wrapping my hand around your cock. You’re so wet for me, gorgeous. We might not even need that lube.”
Cas nodded and spit out the window, “Good.” He pushed in Dean’s cassette tape so they could hear some music as they drove out of town.
Dean looked down at the blade and dropped it in his lap. "Don't give up on me just yet, Cas. Don't give up on Baby, either." Even as he said the words, he knew it was over. They'd never stop looking for them even if they managed to get away, and every single cop in the US would be looking for the Impala. They'd had a good run, he and Cas. Maybe it was time to go out on

Dean licked his lips and leaned in, ungracefully pulling Cas’ dick into his mouth with his tongue as he added a second finger. It was mainly to stop himself from saying something stupid, but Cas could take it however he wanted to. He sucked slowly as he pumped his fingers.
David tried again to squirm away from Cas but couldn’t get far. His wrists were starting to chafe, and he’d been on his tiptoes trying to alleviate the pressure but the blood spilling onto the floor made him slip.

All Cas could do was groan, no words were worthy in this moment of bliss. He rode Dean like it was their last time because
Dean watches them both with raised eyebrows. Honestly, if he didn’t meet Cas on an Improv class forum, he’d believe he actually knew him.
He radioed in that he was bringing in two taggers before turning on the engine. “Any chance you guys want to tell me your names?” Dean asked knowing the answer.
“Soon, baby.” Dean’s hands snaked their way around Cas’ flushed body and pulled him up until his back was arching against Dean’s torso. He bit his angel’s shoulder hard enough to draw tiny little droplets of blood and then kissed his neck, the gesture incredibly tender by comparison. “I want you to bleed for me first.” Dean’s tongue flicked out to wipe the tears from Cas’ cheek as his hands parted ways, one gliding up to squeeze his lover’s neck and the other heading down to his leaking cock.
Dean frowned nonetheless, “No! Why would you think that??”
Cas was already close, he craved this for days and now he could feel this first round was going to be quicker than either of them wanted. He broke the kiss, “Dean... fuck... close.”
Dean got his wish.
He gallic shrugged, but couldn’t stop the sated, stupid smile on his face. “Yeah, you could say that. I dunno if it was you, or the... whole thing, but that was... hot. Real hot.”

It was the best he’d ever felt in his life.
Cas shivered and followed Dean to his beautiful black Impala and watched him climb inside. As soon as he closed the door behind him, he instantly reached for Dean like a fiend. “Just a taste. Need that cock.”
“You have teeth, don’t you?” Cas raised an eyebrow and tilted his head to the side as he moved his hand and toyed with his waistband.
“Mmhmm.” Cas shoved him to the back of his tongue and sucked the come right out of Dean’s cock, milking him for every drop.
“Keep talkin’ like that and you’re gonna have to stay in here... forever,” he jokes, his eyes closing of their own accord.
“Course you are.” He walked over, pulling Cas to him and running his thumb over Cas’ lip. “Do me a favor?”
“Give it to me, Dean. Come on my cock, come for me.” He strokes himself faster, lifting his hips up and biting his lip hard.
off, there was no way he couldn’t get something better somewhere else. Dean had questions, and he knew they’d eat him alive if he didn’t get answers soon.
when Dean was buried deep inside him, placing soft kisses and nips to the nape of his neck. It was a stark contrast to the violent nature of the actual sex, but it was exactly what Cas needed.
One way or the other, he needed to take his life back. The cops had been on a rampage trying to find him and although he’d been more careful than ever, he was starting to get paranoid. He needed to stop hunting dark haired, blue eyed men but the only way he knew how to do it was to get back to Cas.
“Good.” Cas shivers, loving the fact that Dean is marking him. “I’ll wear them for you whenever you want, I wasn’t sure if you would.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “No, not at all. You just need to use the big brother card in better circumstances, you’re making us look bad.”
Dean muttered something about David being a gullible, stupid idiot and started driving back to the motel. When Cas was off the phone, Dean spoke. “It’s late. We sleep on it, and tomorrow... we take them both.”
Castiel shushed him and gripped his hips. “Relax... let me take care of you this time baby.” His voice was low and deep from arousal.
The words settled into Dean’s chest like they’d always belonged there. Like his
“No no, it’s just… I’ve been using your WiFi since I moved in. If your internet is out… mine is out. M’sorry… how about I pull out some of

I thought you said you still wanted this?”
Dean nodded. "Hell yeah, ain't like I'm goin' anywhere." He put some condiments on the table with their food and plopped his ass down, watching Cas. "So uh... you blew Carmen's boyfriend in high school, huh?"
“Why the fuck are you?” He stood up and nearly ripped Dean’s sweats off, followed by his own, then grabbed the lube and jumped back on Dean’s lap. Cas rubbed his cock against Dean’s and moaned. “Look at how fucking hard we are for each other.” He wrapped a hand around both of their cocks and started stroking, adding lube after a few seconds.
Cas wasn’t sure what to think about all that, or about how well they all worked together for the scavenger hunt. Cole was sober, and although he dragged his feet, he wasn’t as bad as Cas expected him to be.
Dean was tickled fucking pink between the waiter’s reaction to the marks

“Shut the fuck up.” Nick whispered, knowing Cas’ mouth would get them in more trouble like it always did.
The waiter gave Cas a flirty smile. “You got it handsome.” He turned and walked away.
When Dean was finished pumping gas, he drove the rest of the way to Sioux Falls. He had no idea where Cas actually lived, but he knew his hangouts. He tried the bar and the diner they’d gone to and came up empty. He drove past apartment buildings looking for his car, remembering that Cas mentioned a studio one time. Still, nothing. He searched the town for hours and wasn’t any closer to finding his angel and he had no way to contact him, so he finally decided to give into his hunger and started looking for a place to get a meal. Not a half a mile later, he spotted Castiel's car in the parking lot of a coffee shop.
is this, David?!” He snarled.
Cas stares at Dean across the table with a soft smile. He can still feel him, and every slight movement reminds him of how good it felt to be with Dean like that. "So, did you say anything you actually meant during our session, or was it all improv?"
talking to you. I just needed some time to process. I’m sorry if I let you down with the safe word.” Cas averted his gaze.
“Thanks.” Dean said awkwardly, still caught off guard by how blue this man’s eyes were. Charlie made a loud noise and he glanced over. “She’s really excited. I’ll go get you a new drink, anything specific?”
“No, you’re a bratty boy. Now get upstairs before I spank you against this random Corolla.” Dean was joking but Cas’ breath still hitched in his throat.
He pulled out a card from his suit jacket and slid it over. “Call me when you’re ready to be a good boy.” He stood up, tossed a five on the table, and walked out.
Cas would have come again at those words, if it was possible. “Get the blade,” he said breathlessly.
Dean’s goal… sort of. He wanted the brothers to work it out but he didn’t want Cas to leave and as soon as they made up, Cas was in his room packing up all his shit.
“You know it, angel. We’ll have the whole place to ourselves in no time, I bet between the two of us we could kill the
Cas went home to get his scalpel to smooth out some edges. He couldn’t help but look over his shoulder constantly, even though he had his legal paperwork folded in his back pocket and ended up staying there all night, making sure the wall was perfect before he started.
He’s answered with a slight nod, then Cas takes him all the way in, gagging slightly around the intrusion. His hips jerk like he’s nearly there himself.
He went and took a quick glance around before facing Dean. “Or something, actually. I work from home, I take care of the finance reports for a company ca—” He cleared his throat and then continued. “Sorry, I tend to overshare. Anyway, my internet is out and the damn place won’t come out until Monday to fix it. Is there anyway I can borrow your internet for the night? It would only take a few moments to submit the report and then I could log back out forever. Promise.”

Cas really wasn’t in the bathroom. He walked to the hallway and waited...
“Hey Cas, got a minute?” He asked, in a small nervous tone.
Cas nodded when he understood. “Alright, that’s smart. I’ll go.” He pulled Dean in for another kiss.
“I got it.” Dean made his way over and grabbed their oversized mugs. “Thanks.” He walked back slower than he needed to, but with each passing second, his butterflies had more and more friggin babies.
Cas took another Adderall and got back to work.
Dean bit his lip and flicked his eyes toward the door again, then closed the messages and set her phone back where he found it. He pulled up a text thread on his own phone and input Cas’ number, then stared at the damn screen not knowing what to say.
Charlie cleared her throat and made some awkward exit to the bedroom, but they hardly glanced her way.

Cas clasped his shoulder and stared into his eyes again. “Until next time, David.” And then he walked out the door, knowing Dean would follow soon.
“I don’t get it.” She stated firmly. “You met when you
“Uh, sorry Chuckles. Talk later!” Dean rushed out of her apartment without listening for a response.
Charlie instantly ran over with a huge smile but kept her hands to herself, “Hey there Cas! I see you know the way to this dude’s heart.” She held out her hands to take the pie and he handed it to her.
A few people eyed his cup, as he made his way back outside to Cas… Charlie, back to Charlie.
Nick groaned, “I swear, if you get arrested tonight, I’m
“Why would I? There’s nothing out there for me.” He looked at Dean and smiled. “Can I sleep in here? Or would you prefer to sleep alone?”
“Hello, Cas. You just do that so we can get some alone time?” Dean grinned and placed his forehead against Cas’.
Cas watched Dean come apart and his own cock leaked. “You’re so beautiful.
“How’d you know it was me?” Dean grinned.
eyes. The release felt good, and the power balance in his life returning to normal felt even better. But this time, the hunger returned almost instantly. Everything about that felt muted, weak,
Dean’s taunts turned into jaw-clenching grunts as his angel split him open. It hurt like hell, probably more than any organic pleasure he was getting from it, but that was the point. In the absence of hurting others, maybe
Jo shrugged, “What’s it like being with someone with the same parts?”
Cas hummed and lifted up again. “You like that... there it is.” He chuckled a deep throaty laugh and licked the slit of Dean’s cock. “How are you so delicious?” Before he could answer, Cas finally slid him in his mouth.
After a few beers, Dean opened up about Cas, he’ll definitely regret this tomorrow and to top it off, Charlie
“You don’t question the mind of an artist,
"It's a project for our improv class. He thought this was a good idea, and put an ad out that I answered." Cas glances at their hands with a raised eyebrow, but realizes it really does feel... right. He meets Dean's eyes with a playful smirk. "So I don't get a say in this now?"
He screams when he comes, knowing too well that everyone in that house just heard him. Unfortunately, he has no idea if he moaned Dean’s name or Steve, and those continued, brutal thrusts make it hard to think about anything at all.
Cas didn’t look at him twice, because Dean sitting in a diner booth took his breath away. He still couldn’t picture Dean doing anything as mundane as eating in the diner. Cas really needed to get a grip, he was putting Dean up on some pedestal because the sex was good. He shook the thoughts away and slid into the booth. “What’s with the scowl?” Cas chugged his glass of water.
would notice if he disappeared.” He scanned the bar and was beginning to think they were out of luck when a man walked in by himself. He kept his gaze on the way he walked, as if he was trying to remain invisible. He had a simple grey shirt on and jeans that looked like they’d been around for too many years.
swoon when you call him your boyfriend.” She fake swooned and batted her eyes.
“May I touch you?” Michael asked boldly. “I really want to do a scene with you Castiel.”
Satisfied, Dean gripped those beautiful hips and pounded into Cas until he was coming with a series of low, cut-off grunts, his fingertips leaving tiny bruises in his skin. “Come for me, sweetheart.”
The fact that this church already had a lantern should have stirred something inside Cas. Something to let him know this wasn’t some spur of the moment decision like Dean made him believe. This church had been prepared for
Dean leaned in, tightening his grip on Cas’ cock but finally letting go of his neck. He bit him softly at first, barely grazing his teeth over the skin. He was salty, like Dean’s mere presence made him sweat. He loved it and bit a little harder, trapped skin between his teeth and his tongue flicked over it. The third time he bit down, he broke the skin, pressing his body against Cas’ and pinning him to the car. He did it again, just above the first bite until he could taste blood, and only then did he pull back. He was fully hard now, his cock pressing against his jeans as he yanked his shirt over his head.
“I lived in this apartment for one year but before that, I wasn’t far from here. I work down the street.”
Even as the thoughts cross his mind, he knows Dean will struggle. No letter will help fill the hole his heart is bound to have once Castiel is gone. Tears spill down his cheeks, because
They hung out for about 10 minutes, just the right amount of time to smoke the small amount of weed they had and then left for work, leaving the brothers alone again. Nick picked up two empty cans Cas had tossed and was looking for somewhere to dump them when the officer spoke.
It was amazing how things shifted once they opened up about how they felt. Watching movies with everyone else found them holding hands under the blanket or messing with each other by trying to see who could give the other a boner first without anyone noticing. He’d skipped the group sex for the very first time in favor of laying in bed with Dean, his head on those gorgeous abs, listening to their favorite songs. They snuck out for another drive - and that time, no one mentioned going back home until they’d fogged up every window of that car
Dean followed him out, shutting the door behind him. “His shoes and stuff are still on, I was going to help him out of those but got distracted by his art.” Dean sat at the table with Nick.
Dean kept leaning over to kiss his temple and finally said, “hey, I uh… I got you a present.”
“C’mere, Bumblebee.” Dean pats his lap and motions grabby hands at his lover.
one. He wondered how he could get the man to notice him without being too obvious.
Dean blinked at the photo but didn’t miss a beat at Cas’ story. He poked the picture of Cas, “Look at that, the eyes are all wrong. And his bags are in the trunk, if you don’t believe him. I’m trying to get him outta the city.”
Dean shook his head and sat down. “Nah, just can’t sleep. Kinda feels like the walls are closing in, y’know? I want this shit to be over.”
Cas attempted to pull his arm back but couldn’t, Dean’s grip was painfully tight. “Not you.
drunk. Just like a small amount of drunk.”
marathon (because honestly, can you ever really get sick of watching a certain little shit choke on some dry ass pie? The answer is no.) Cas starts looking up human rights of passage on the internet. Thanks again Sam.
“I can stay longer, I don’t have anywhere to be.”
An animalistic growl ripped from his chest as he fucked Cas into the side of his car. He could feel that little ring of muscle opened up by Dean’s fingers constricting again, fighting back against the thick, throbbing mass of Dean’s cock and it drove him fucking
Dean’s mouth went completely dry. His heart was slamming against his rib cage and he was absolutely going to pass out if he didn’t sit the fuck down immediately.
threw
“You look drunk.” Dean stared into Cas’ eyes, allowing himself to get lost for a moment before he realized how dilated they are and had to look away. “And high.”
He caught it and set the game up. “Come on, player one.” Dean moved a mere two inches away and was staring at Cas competitively. “No pressure, don’t mind me.”
“Ass is mine.” Dean fucks harder, their skin slapping together noisily. Cas turns his head to catch Dean in a kiss as he comes with a groan, all over the counter in front of him.
“Dean.” Cas crossed his arms and held up his chin. “I’m a good boy.”
When he woke up, he laid there awhile, trying to piece together that weird ass dream he’d just had. Was it a wolf? Some kinda dog? He couldn’t remember, he just remembered he was supposed to follow it… and it had these crazy blue eyes.
Dean laughed, “Well I hate to burst your bubble, but I have different parts. Can’t really answer that for you, check out some lez porn.” Dean shrugged, earning himself another slap. “What lesbian porn is almost as hot as dude porn Jo.”
Isn’t she amazing?! 🥰
“I have a better idea, i’ll go for a walk, and you can fuck off.” He said with nearly no emotion before turning and walking away, it wasn’t long before he was sprinting. He felt like he could finally breathe, even
because he lost all their money was motivation enough for him to flirt right back.
“Um, yeah.” Cas turned to look at her finally. “I thought this would be a bigger deal,” he admitted.
Dean grabbed a knife and climbed back on top of Eric, his jaw clenched in jealousy he wouldn’t let himself verbalize. He might not have been able to bring himself to say it, but he could
Dean:
He sat on the porch until the sun rose, thinking about how to fix this shitstorm he had created and by the time he heard movement in the house, he had decided on his course. First, he would call his old therapist. Yeah, he had moved away since the last he saw him, but maybe he could give a reference of someone closer to Cas? It was worth a shot. Secondly, he would fix this with Dean. How? Well, he hadn’t gotten that far yet, but he had to try. Dean was the only one Cas could see himself getting over all of this bullshit with. Maybe he could never stand the touch of a stranger, but Dean wasn’t a stranger. He had only known him less than four weeks and yet he felt closer to
One of the men was instantly interested in Cas’ company, so he made himself comfortable and started friendly conversation. He wasn’t in the mood, but he could fake it for a bit while Dean got to work. The bar was filled with mostly men so there weren’t many purses around for easy targets. Cas hoped Dean could hustle enough money to tide them over.
Dean’s eyes widened and Cas blushed furiously. “Go away... it’s my birthday!” he joked, and kissed Cas one more time before climbing off the bed. “Cole interrupts everything.”
“Does it make you feel good?” Cas moved to look into Dean’s eyes. “Does it make you think of all the things you wanted to do to me?” He asked, genuinely curious.
and once again wondered what
have.”
As always, his prayer goes unanswered and eventually he stands up and makes his way inside.
They still haven’t talked about it. Cas isn’t surprised, and he’s also not complaining. While he’s accidentally, absolutely fallen head over heels for his supposedly-straight best friend, he’ll take what he can get. As it turns out, that includes — but isn’t limited to — multiple orgasms a day.
it already felt better than just about anything he’d ever experienced.
“Right…Uh, you all comin’ to the party tonight? It’s at Michael’s.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck.
He tilted his head to kiss her cheek and let out a breath.
beautiful. Even his voice was softer, but the tone sent a bitter chill up his own spine,
He pushed Cas’ panties down to the middle of his thighs and lightly smacked his ass before bending him over the counter and kicking his legs apart. Dean kept one palm flat between his shoulder blades while the other teased Cas’ already-fucked open hole. “You gonna be a good boy for me now, or should we stop?”
Inviting Cas to hang out after the blowjob was probably a stupid idea, but Dean had never really been known for making good decisions post mind-blowing orgasms. Besides, he
“I don’t know either. I’m amazing. So amazing, I already have burgers on the way.” Dean’s entire face lights up and Cas laughs. “Best thing about 2020 is all the food delivery places now.”
Dean stared down at the phone a moment,
The flinch was absolutely noticeable, and he tried to cover it up but his words just came out defensive. “Seems a little sudden, doesn’t it? You’re here most of the time as it is... don’t you like having your own space?”
After dinner, Cas realized the sun had begun to set and stood up. “Shit it’s getting late, I have to go.” Jesse jumped up to walk him out and when Cas looked down on his phone he saw it was dead.
Sorry, had to take a break. When the angel comes a knockin… uh, you get it. (Insert winky face)
Their lips meet again and Cas rolls his hips, huffing through his nose at how deeply he truly loves Dean. “You need to let me go, I'm going to burn the meat for the next round of nachos.”
“Yes, but... I don’t personally recommend it... despite Leonardo DiCaprio’s good looks.” He blushed the second he said it, then cleared his throat. “Not that I think he’s good looking.”
noise that definitely didn’t help. “Yes.”
weeks of Cas feeling more depressed than he ever had before. There were moments he felt okay, but he ended up Googling drops and how long they normally lasted before he decided this wasn’t even a
He mocks the lightsaber noise and stalks forward, but realizes quickly this is kinda weird without the lights off. He flips the switch and Jask cackles when he sees their cocks glowing green, and the next thing Dean knows, Jask’s luminescent dick is bouncing in the air as he runs at him.
“I think my mouth got you to like me. Now I want you to keep liking me. And I’m hungry.” Cas sat up and walked towards the door. “I’ll cook in only these, and yes to the bacon.”
ran out of prank ideas for the time being. Do you hear me people!? THE TRICKSTER. RUNNING OUT OF PRANK IDEAS! This is serious shit. So in the middle of our third (yes you heard me right. Third)
Cas grinned and got up to go take a piss. When he came back, Dean had put some music on and Castiel decided to look around, pushing all the negative thoughts about the future out of his mind. So,
“Thank fuck, because I want you too. Picturing you fucking your hand, getting off to something I was doing…” Cas moaned softly as he spoke. “I don’t think my cock has ever leaked this much.”
Cas looked over and huffed a laughed. “Yeah, well, I needed to mark what’s mine too. We’re about to be apart, don’t want anyone else touching
card, Dean snatched the box back from Nick. “Cas gets it just for that lame older brother card usage.” Dean handed Cas the box with a smile.
She took it, but shoved it in her pocket. “Maybe. I have to ask him first. I can't just give out his number without permission.”
Dean opens without hesitation and his hands slide to grip Cas’ ass as he ruts up into him with a moan.
Cas looked down at where Nick is holding his arm before speaking. “I told him to meet me somewhere.”
“Yes, can we get going, Lumberjack?” Cas teased and met Dean’s eyes.
But that wasn’t how it happened.
pulled off and started stroking the guy, his tongue out, as he eagerly awaited his release. “Ah shit…” Dean moved even faster, his laptop shaking on his mattress next to him. “Cas…”
“Good.” Dean pushes in two fingers and moans, a pleased look overtaking his features, but it ends almost as quickly as it begins and he’s moving to hover over him. Dean strokes, slicking his long, thick cock and then nudging at Cas’ hole. “I didn’t hear a please… c’mon, Castiel. Let me hear you beg.”
“Uh, yeah. Why didn’t you call?” Dean couldn’t help but ask. Cas just shrugged so Dean moved on. “Here, look at these emails.” Dean pulled up the screenshots and handed Cas the phone, joining him on the couch.
didn’t exist.
He doesn't find him until he forces himself out of bed and to the kitchen, where the angel is swearing quietly at a pan full of what smells like burning bacon.
He’d noticed the security camera when he pulled in and had made a point to park on its other side. No one would see her get in, the cameras would catch nothing. No one noticed either of them leaving. They exchanged a few casual pleasantries when she’d walked willingly into his trap, but he cut her words off quickly with a kiss that would make an
Castiel frowned and took another drink. “Alright… I’m named after an angel, though I'm anything
Cas was completely frozen, and his eyes were wide from shock. “Dean…” He whispered once it all ended and he kneeled next to Dean on the floor. “Look at me…”
Food tastes different.
“What?” Cas’ face lights up with hope. “You're serious? What about the rules or whatever, that we don't date within the group?”
Cas began his walk home with only one thing on his mind, Dean.
lost my cool. All you were trying to do was be a decent human and I fucked it up for you.” Dean leaned into Cas’ touch and suddenly realized that he turned Cas into a murderer. He closed his eyes, trying to stop the growing swell of voices in his mind.
Cas was smiling.
And fuck… it was beautiful.
He noticed Cas mumble something in his sleep and turned the TV off completely to listen. Dean walked over to kneel next to Cas’ head, none of it was audible but it sounded like he was calling to someone.
Cas moaned Dean’s name and arched his back. “You’re fucking incredible!” He reached down and gripped Dean’s short hair. “How are you even real?”
“Damnit,” Cas mumbles, trying and failing to keep his mouth shut — he laughs loudly, swatting Dean’s hand away and shooting an apologetic shrug to Cordelia.
Cas moaned at the return of Dean’s fingers. “Yours. Only yours Dean.” He slid slightly so the rope tightened on his neck and groaned in pleasure.
Cas watched his ass he walked away, wishing he wasn’t a cop. It took a slap upside the head to snap him out of it. “What are you playing at Cas? That’s a
and Cas still moving had his dick already making feeble attempts to wake up again.
“I do. Every damn day if I could.” Cas back peddled and pulled Dean towards his room. His bed was made and he pushed Dean down onto his soft comforter. “Is that okay with you?”
“I—” Ares is completely speechless. He definitely
Cas was nervous, “um yeah, this is Dean.”
to do to him.
I think Satan is wearing my little brother’s meat suit again. Buckle up kiddies, it’s story time.
Meg finally showed emotion, “Just oxy, we smoked it but I think he snorted some before we smoked. I was just letting him sleep it off.”
"You know this is an unowned building." Dean called out as he walked up. "I can file for the city's permission to let you paint it."
beg again.
“Fuck off, Balt. I... fucked up.” Cas laid his head back with a sigh.
Cas was lifting a fry to his mouth and paused, tilting his head. “What else would you do?” He asked curiously, trying and failing to hide the excitement in his voice.
“What’s up your ass?” Cas could feel the tension radiating off his brother.
He gripped the handle of the door and turned it slowly, but not to muffle the sound. He wanted this bastard to know he was coming, wanted him to put up a fight. He was going to drag this one out. When he pushed open the door, Cas was nowhere to be found and the monster that had touched what was
They cuddled a while, because sex like
“Yes, I am.” Cas grinned and sat back as well.
coordinating. “Dean... are you asking me to go steady?”
Dean wanted to fight him, to tell him to stay behind but Cas’ words from long ago rang in his mind,
Cas was happy she always had good music and riding with the windows down was a given. Fall weather had just begun so they needed to enjoy the warmth while they could. Night Moves started just as they parked in the student lot and they decided to wait the song out before heading inside.
aspects of his life, so Dean’s eyes were glued to the loner in the corner very clearly trying to appear invisible. Cas was talking to him, but he missed the words entirely. “Sorry,
this, and Cas wanted to help. This man deserved to die, in the worst possible way, and they were the ones that got to put out his light.
“No, it wasn't.” Cas is relieved to hear he wasn't the only one that failed to act in there, but he wants to set one thing straight. “I don't need you to be vocal about everything, Dean. Just tell me if I upset you and maybe… don't be shy about the things you like. I don't expect you to tell me every thought that runs through your head. I just want to be able to do the things you like more often, and the things you don't like… less often.”
“You could say that.” He relaxed in his seat a little and turned his body slightly toward Cas. “I... don’t get out much.”
He spends the next several minutes undressing Dean and asking questions to set boundaries. By the time he's sucking that thick, beautiful cock into his mouth, he's mad at himself for wasting any time at all.
Dean watched Cas eat with a smile. He was worried he’d be too high to eat actual food but he was
okay with the blood, would Dean have killed him months ago? Or would Dean kill him tomorrow if he decided he wasn’t on board for one of his kinks? Would he just get bored one day and kill him? Did he even care about Castiel? Dean carved his initials into Cas’ chest and he still had no idea what Dean’s last name even was. Was
Cas and Charlie’s comments had Dean checking out people’s cups. It seemed there was a decent variety in the place, lot’s of purple, a little less orange, red was pretty common but black was few and far between… he knew he should have chosen black. He talked to Cas again for a while but he kept getting pulled away by friends. And Dean could see why, the guy was kinda awesome.
“Thanks for bringing him home and not, arresting him. You do that hickey?” Nick asked, there was no judgement in his voice, only curiosity.
you do. I don’t care, just like
“I think my love of meat has been proven.” He smiled his first real smile. “Thanks.”
“You'll get your pie.” Cas quiets the sound of the engine so they won't be found out, and once they're safely away, he leans over and pops the button on Dean’s jeans. “Relax for me. I want to taste you before we get there.”
“Yes. I deserved worse.” Cas let him take his hand but didn’t look his way.
Cas laughed quietly, leaning back in his seat. “You know, I hadn’t even considered that. You make a very good point. I’d have picked something like the Patronus Charm. I know Dementors don’t actually exist, but if they make you feel happy anyway, it would be a handy thing to have around. Not to mention, I feel like a Patronus would be a little bit like a Pokémon, and who doesn’t want one of those?”
Dean’s brain was shorting out, he had no fucking idea what was happening but his dick had never been more on board with anything in his whole life. He moaned as Cas started moving, fucking up into his own hand and dragging their lengths against each other.
Dean grinned. “Then tomorrow. We go on a real date.”
“Ditto?” He grinned, “Isn’t that from some movie?”
A stupid, insane idea comes to Cas’ mind, and then leaves his lips before he can gather enough good sense to stop it. “We could watch together.”
in his dream and it isn’t until he wakes up with his hand around his cock that he realizes how bad he wants it... no,
He lets out a strangled groan and tugs on Dean’s hair as he humps his face, coming in hot, delicious spurts down his throat. “Oh, my g—”
Dean’s smile quickly faded and he looked down at the map with a frown. Cas would have felt bad, but again, he needed food for that. He held up the map and looked at the moon, Charlie looped her arm with Cas’, and Cole was still up in the damn tree. Dean cleared his throat, “uh, it says we should make our way that way and we should just walk until we see the bridge but we don’t cross it, we hook left and follow the dirt trail to camp.”
That's what gets him. Above the hand, the cock, the freckles on Dean's face — it's that single move that has Cas moaning almost embarrassingly loud and letting go, spurting hot come onto Dean's shirt and tongue.
“Don’t pull away, stay with me.”
Dean relaxed slightly but the jealous knot in his stomach sure didn’t go away. Part of him wanted it to be him, but then again… he’d never done that before, and why the hell would someone like Cas even want a virgin? He glanced up at Carmen and took a deep breath, reminding himself he was in a relationship and it was probably best that Cas met someone else and they put a stop to things before they got out of hand.
“Don’t be adorable. You’ll get it later.” Dean walked towards his room and Cas followed.
patient. He's never in his life wanted someone for this long without being able to have them.
could make him come this way and his legs nearly gave out as he slumped forward over the hood of Dean’s beautiful car. “Fuck. I want to make you feel this good, too,” Cas whispered breathlessly.
Once he does, Cas bites his lip and pivots on the couch to face Dean instead of the tv. “Is this okay?”
with a whimper.
He grimaced a little at Cas’ tone. “Yeah, guess so. Maybe just... don’t be alone with him. Go to dinner, then you guys meet me at the bar?”
“We fucked before class, so... I’m open, too.” Ares chuckles as they round their floor and looks at Cas when they can hear music coming from the cracks.
“Roll over, I want you to fuck my throat.”
over and over again.
One day, when Cas was sitting alone at lunch, Dean took it as an opportunity. He told his friends he’d see them later and slid in the chair across from him, a huge grin on his face. “Hi.”
Cas took a deep breath and stood, watching her walk around the desk. “I feel like it gets easier every time.”
He’s dressed up somewhat, just like Dean, and his blue dress shirt brings out the most beautiful blue eyes he’s ever seen. He lets his own eyes check Castiel out for a moment, and then makes his way over, talking low so the receptionist doesn’t hear: “Please tell me
Cas didn’t go out out that night looking for a dom, but he
Cas kept his hand there and pulled him in for a heated kiss. He was still turned on from what they’d done. “Let me ride you, you’ll slide right in baby. Still have your come in me.”
The rest of the night was more of the same, except a few hours later, Dean disappeared with that girl. Cas couldn’t help but be disappointed. He kinda hoped to see Dean with a guy. Don’t ask why, don’t look too deep into it… Cas wasn’t about to.
When Dean saw the blood, he released into Castiel’s throat so hard he almost choked on it and the blood... the
“No, Cas. Not this time. When did you start smoking oxy?” Dean asked, clearly over Cas’ bullshit.
Thank you to everyone who stuck around to the end. This was a harder fic for me to write. Addiction is something I grew up with in my family, so finding that line between talking about it and glamorizing it was hard. It was therapeutic to write about regardless, even though most situations were changed. I hope I did them justice. ❤️
lands in my coffee. I wipe away the first and second degree burns and look up. Cas is standing there giving me the stink eye and said, “Here’s the wiener you didn’t get last night.”
With a rushed goodbye to the Lafitte’s, Cordelia closes the door to her office and slides into her desk chair, anxious to read back over the file she has sitting innocently to her left. This is it. This is the appointment she’s been waiting for with no small amount of amusement and curiosity for just over six months.
The sound of their come mixing together around their cocks is so obscene it has Dean’s back arching off the bed and his hands squeezing Cas’ hips. “Sonofabitch.” Dean gasps, collapsing back on the bed with a sated smile. “Shoulda… done that years ago.”
that, hmm?” Meg was taunting them, standing there in her fucking underwear, trying to give the impression that her and Cas had slept together.
Dean nearly shit his pants.
me, goddamnit.”
They talked for hours, about everything and nothing. Dean ate the coldest burger he’s ever had but it still tasted good and even if it didn’t, nothing could have wiped the grin from his lips.
He says it isn’t a problem but I don’t fucking know anymore, I mean he hasn’t been fidgeting around all the time like he used to.”
percent straight. I’m... pansexual. I like... people for people, and... I have a... boyfriend... kinda.”
“Watched porn while thinking about us fuckin’ and suckin’ each other? Yeah. A lot actually,” he confessed.
Cas pass anyone?
It was a fitting moment because Krum happened to be on the screen. “You’re much more handsome though.” He added with a head tilt, hoping Dean would blush and flash him some freckles. He was wearing his glasses and could probably count every one from this distance. Cas turned back to the tv, wondering to himself if he just granted Dean permission for their knees to touch, or more... probably more.
Cas answered with a sharp intake of breath and a smooth hand carded in his hair. “I trust you, Dean.”
“Cas our city is ugly. Art brings beauty to a city and it brings customers to businesses. I think your art is worth more than a thousand but you have to start somewhere.” Dean fought the urge to reach for Cas’ hand.
Cas growls but knows exactly why Dean said it — so for once, he simply plays along. He fucks up harder until he physically has to hold Dean down to stop him from flying off, then swaps their positions with a blink and fucks him into the hood. “Go ahead, Dean. You know no one will ever fill you up like I do.”
Nick looked over at Dean, surprised, “What? Why are you asking like that?”
Cas chuckled at that, “Did you prefer the fun, doped out me better?”
Cas huffed a laugh, “I… next week will be two weeks since I had it. I could maybe…”
Dean’s eyes traveled over the stained glass windows that were barely visible in the edges of the light the lantern cast off. He’d been called it all, pretty, beautiful, handsome, perfect... the words had lost all meaning long ago. And yet, the reminder that Castiel wanted this was welcome. He listened closely so the sound of Castiel’s pants pooling on the ground and smiled, looking back toward the cross. “Are you hard, thinking about all the things I’m going to do to you? All the things you
Dean stares at him with what he’s sure are heart eyes as he sits back on the seat to stroke his hard aching cock. “For the record, I now believe in love at first sight.”
“Are you two done yet?!”
involving Castiel. He rooted through the fridge and cupboards until he found what he needed to make a sandwich and threw one together quickly. It didn't occur to him to make one for Cas, so he didn't. He took a large bite and groaned at how good it felt to swallow something real again, then turned to lean backward against the counter.
“Like he’s loaded Nick. Like he hasn’t slept in days. Like he isn’t eating. Should I keep going?” Dean knew he sounded harsh, but Nick needed to hear this. “What are you bringing him to eat a
How many times do I gotta tell you that your light is
“Strugglin’ a little there, grower?” Dean rushes out of his pants and has to do the same to get it hard, no way these condoms will stay on a soft cock. “Fuck... we’re gonna have to have time-outs to wank it. Gotta keep these battle ready.”
“Is that so?” Cas nodded over to where Dean was wrestling with Michael again and forced his eyes away.
“Mmm. See, now
was clear, but just in case it wasn’t... “Fuck me, Cas.”
After awhile of watching, Dean walked over to the ladder, “Hey Cas!” He yelled, seeing the earbuds in Cas’ ears.
“Sweetheart, you cooked breakfast with your boxers on your head this morning and presented your cock to me on a plate,” Cas replies, but he's barely containing a smile. “I don't know if I'd consider that good.”
Not like they
It helps that all their friends are at the very least bi and attractive, so as Dean slides on his Captain America tights, he doesn’t have any worries about who he will be fucking tonight. Dude, chick, doesn’t matter, everyone knows Dean is a top and Charlie wouldn’t pair him with someone incompatible. Even still, he hopes it’s Cas.
“Why did that stupid tent take so damn long? I’m fucking starving!” Dean complained, rubbing his belly.
Dean reached forward with bound hands and gave Cas’ hair an experimental tug. It wasn’t as comfortable or fluid of a movement as he might make had he not been semi-restrained, but he still felt in control. He nodded. “Yeah, angel. Trust you.”
I’ve never been this sticky before in my entire life. And this includes the time I… never mind that one. I have champagne covering every inch of my body and Cas won’t let me shower yet, something about a tongue bath? I don’t know what that means, but we all know I have to figure it out.
Instantly, Cas is bending down to lick it up, then swipes up the bit he couldn’t reach and leans back. He sucks it off his fingers as his hips snap forward, and the groan he lets out from the taste is fucking sinful. His fingertips dig into Dean’s skin as his movements become erratic. “Such a good boy, Dean... fuck, you’re mine. I’m yours... I—”
"Do you guys want to call a lawyer or do you need one appointed to you?" The officer asked, crossing his arms.
Jack believe he helped at all? “I don’t understand why.”
pathetic sobs into his pillow.
Cas couldn’t count how many times he’d said the word
Cas looked over lazily. “Thoughts?” He tilted his head. “And what exactly am I thinking Officer?” Cas walked closer, entering Dean’s space with a smirk.
going to make it until Friday.
It fucking stung, and Castiel? He
“Good... then nap. I’ll just do it again when you wake up.”
“Have you done this before?”
His hand absentmindedly reached for the spot where Cas’ head had been and felt nothing but dry skin, which made him frown. How long had he been out? He got up and dressed in a hurry, hastily packing the rest of his things and returning the pull-out bed to its original state. He gave the room a cursory glance and after confirming he had all of his belongings and he was leaving Cas’ office more or less in the state that he found it, he slung his bag over his shoulder and made his way downstairs.
that he blames his bad decisions on and Cas was
Dean raised his eyebrows, that was not what he’d expected from this conversation. “That’s an honor I’ve never allowed
Dean knows he can’t hear anything at all, so when he wants to speak to Cas, he does exactly that.
Cas eyed him, “Present? It isn’t my birthday or anything.”
Dean tilted his head curiously at the man.
is he? You wanna try again to address him properly, or should Cas continue to prove himself to both of us?”
The invitation alone has Dean gripping both of his hands behind his back with one of his and the other naturally resting on his hip. “Don’t come back up without one, sweetheart.” To motivate him further, Dean tugs him back a little to press his crotch against Cas’ amazing, tight ass, and then he helps him bend more. “Also, don’t drown.”
Cas climbed off and pulled off his pants, his cock hardening at the blood he could still see. He helped Dean out of his pants and climbed back on, sinking down slowly and wrapping his hand back around Dean’s neck. “Fuck I love your cock.”
was raw devotion.
The knowledge that he was gonna have a dick in his mouth right after he came only seemed to push him closer to the edge. He had a weird, twisty feeling in his gut that couldn’t seem to decide if it was excitement or anxiety, but with every flick of Cas’ tongue or bob of his head - Dean didn’t give a shit which one it was. There was no emotion that would stop him from making Cas feel every bit as good as Cas was making him feel.
Cas almost protested the photo, it was another thing he didn’t allow. But he didn’t have the willpower to give a fuck right now. He stayed there, not posing in anyway as Dean took the photo. It was creepy, in a sense, that this stranger wanted a photo of him on his knees but it also cemented for Cas that
“In your— fuck!” That doesn’t help him in the slightest. Dean grips Cas’ messy hair and starts fucking into his mouth. He starts much more gentle than he wants to, but all it takes is one look in Cas’ eyes to tell him he wants more, and within seconds, he’s barreling into the back of his throat. “Ca— fuck... gonna come!” The sound Dean makes seems to manifest from deep inside his soul, and he comes so hard he’s absolutely sure Cas got some in his lungs.
“Cas, no one is going to prison, okay? We’re gonna get out of the country, somewhere with no extradition.” Dean kissed his forehead. “And if it comes to it, I’ll kill you myself. I won’t let anyone take you from me.”
“Don’t get all high and mighty Nick, you don’t know how it feels to be fucking fidgeting all the damn time. People stare at you like your crazy or-or on fucking drugs. They help me feel normal. I’ve been trying to take less addys, and these help.” Castiel stood up to walk away, done with this conversation.
at the sight of Dean.
It had been a few weeks since Cas fucked someone he
Dean slowly blinks awake, stretching out his spine with a loud pop. “Fuck,” he groans, sitting up and blinking around the room. There’s no sunlight in the bunker but the ceiling lights in the hall still shine through around the door frame. He rubs his eyes with the back of his palms and stands, wondering where Cas is.
Dean bit his lip as he watched the intense expression on Cas’ face. He knew the sight between his legs was probably phenomenal - Cas had some of the best hands he’d ever
Cas nodded quickly, “So fucking full, baby.” He moaned around Dean’s thumb, using all his willpower to stay still.
“I think we’re gonna need to lay off the murder for a little bit, Cas.” Dean reached a hand up to cup his angel’s face. “We need to lay low.”
He didn't even realize he had fallen asleep until Charlie was back, making him drink some water. “I called Cas. He’s awake, and he said you can have his number. I already put it in your phone. You should pick a more complicated passcode. 1-2-3-4 is amature hour.”
Dean curled his fingers in a circle and dug his nails into the raw flesh. “Is that how you ask for things?”
Dean put his number in Nick’s phone and then called himself so he’d have Nick’s number as well. “Talk soon.” Dean stood up and let himself out, leaving the pills behind, his mind reeling.
He gripped the sheets below him, tears forming in his eyes.
“Wanna go for a run?”
Dean gasped and wrinkled his nose, “You still talk to her?”
Dean had suspected as much and even though it sent a jealous spike into his groin, he didn’t comment. “You gonna fuck David?”
“And Charlie, if you wanted.” He blushed and scratched the back of his head.
end? And if that were the case, why not joke about it. So he laughed.
Cas kissed back as if he was a starved animal, he
His eyes nearly rolled out of his head, and he scoffed quietly. “It wasn’t a mistake, Car. And I don’t blame you for smackin’ the shit out of me, I deserved it. But no, I don’t think lunch is a great idea.”
Dean nodded and smiled like an idiot. "I vote we play a little game. You kiss me every time someone mentions Voldemort in any capacity, or Hermione does something smart."
more than it feels good, but he needed to know, needed to find the limit. He
“Hey, Charlie?” Cas called out from her floor. “Think Dean’s in trouble? He was pretty drunk.”
“Shut-up, asshat. Take a damn bite and tell me how good it is.”
“Fuck, I need you too, Cas… shit!” Castiel sinks down, moaning out in pleasure as Dean’s thick shaft splits him open. His eyes tear as he relishes the burn and when he finally bottoms out, Cas tosses his head back with a deep laugh.
instead of getting ready for dinner." Cas rolls his eyes as he pushes open the door, then stops dead when he sees nothing but two vibrantly green dicks shining through their dark apartment.
“Thank you so much for the help. I was hoping you could stay later so I could thank you properly.” Jesse said when they reached the door.
“Yeah, suck that dick, Cas.” Dean bit his lip and sped up, adding a second hand since this guy was flush against the other’s pelvis. The dude sucked and sucked, without giving any indication he was getting tired. It was like he
Dean almost smiled, he's happy Cas is alive and relatively surprised to get a response before sunset but the jealousy in his gut is unexpected. Before Dean can respond Cas texts again.
“This’a mighty nice car you got there, boy. We been on the lookout for one’a these.” The cop pointed the beam of blinding light right at Dean’s face, but he barely flinched. The cop continued, “Witha driver looks a lot like you, if this here police sketch is anything to go by.” He stood straighter then, pulling a crinkled piece of paper from his pocket and attempting to smooth it out while still holding his flashlight. “Yep, I’m no Picasso, but let’s see that Mona Lisa smile for the camera, shall we?”
“Of course. I thought you said we’d never talk about it?”
The silence was thick and it was obvious Cas had a million questions for Carmen, but not nearly as fucking many as Dean did.
one and hated how he could never sit still. He didn’t care about the side effects, just as long as it could keep Cas still. Chuck was embarrassed by Cas and blamed his mom for dropping him as a baby. Cas knew it had nothing to do with that, he just had trouble concentrating.
She tosses him one quickly as water drips down Cas’ gorgeous skin. “How big is it, Cas?”
“You’re perfect, Dean. Everything about you is perfect for me,” Cas says between gentle kisses. “Tell me we can be together.”
“Ready for this babe?” Cas asked with a grin. “I want to chop his dick off, that’s what all rapists deserve.” Cas didn’t count what Dean did to him as rape, because he wanted it. He was sure the 13 year old girl from this crime didn’t.
but this was how Dean coped. “And you just get to decide for me huh? This is Castiel’s world, and
it to goddamn happen!” Dean’s adrenaline was coursing through his veins and making him lightheaded as he sped out of town, his eyes half glued to the rapidly sinking needle on the gas gauge.

“Yeah... I dunno if I loved that because I love bottoming, or just because I love you. But that felt amazing... definitely want to try everything with you, Cas.”
Sliding out was a travesty. “Yes, the sooner the better.” Cas tied off the condom and looked around awkwardly for the trash can, locating it quickly and disposing of it. “Are you alright?”
“Hey... Cas.” He pointed at him, looking proud of himself for actually remembering Cas’ name. “Happy birthday.”
“Sure thing.” He shook his head and walked home, slightly annoyed that he suddenly got the urge to draw,
He nodded like a bobble head, arching his back as he thrust up weakly into the air. “Yes, it’s - I didn’t expect it to feel this good.”
“Um, yeah... and also... uh, my boyfriend.” Cas blushed and awaited whatever was about to be thrown his way.
And yes, we're aware we're going to hell. It's fine.
“Cheers.”
Cas couldn’t hear what was being said but he could read their body language, and he instantly
Dean relaxed a little at the words. “Yeah, she’s the only nice thing I’ve ever owned.”
“I didn’t know this damn year could get worse. Two days left of it and my whole life just burned to the ground. I don’t even know how it started.” Thinking about the fire has his stomach in knots again, but Cas holds his hand tighter, taking deep calming breaths with him.
The only problem with reaching the finish line is just that — it’s the finish line, and he doesn’t want Cas to be finished with him yet. He needs more... so much more. “Cas... fuck...”
In class the following day, Dean got paired with Cas in chemistry. He knew the kid was smart - at least smarter than him - so he wasn’t worried about the project; he was more worried about the awkwardness.
Dean was only 6 days out from his last kill and was feeling much more relaxed than their first encounter. Or, at least, he would have been if that handsy fucking
much he has to grip the base of his own cock as he hums around Cas. Once he’s calmed himself down he brings that hand up to cup Cas’ balls and slides off, diving back before Cas can catch his breath.
Cas got dressed quickly and ran out after Dean. He started down the stairs just as Dean slammed his trunk. Cas’ heart was pounding when he climbed into Dean’s car. “It’s on the other side of town.”
a wizard, which spell would you learn first?”
He kept his eyes on Cas’ face as he slowly unbuttoned his jeans and released his throbbing cock. He ran a bloody hand over the shaft and circled his palm over the head, his voice laced with lust. “Don’t stop till he begs you, Cas. And when he finally does - they
Dean snorted at the line of questioning. "Well, thank you, the name is Dean, and I don't want what you're offering. This is all for your

Cas drowns in the pleasure and pain, his body relaxed completely except for the fingers scratching at Dean’s shirt and tugging on the fabric to try and keep himself afloat. “Per-perfect, Dean… oh my god.”
Shame and terror worked their way through Dean. After all this time, he
“I mean, it’s not an ideal situation, but... if it gives us both what we want, I’ll give it a try. But babe, you better not have been kidding about bein’ involved. I’m not doin’ this shit without you.”
Dean eyed the blanket and scooted over to get underneath it. Their knees brushed together as they settled, and Dean’s eyes widened. “Shit, man. I’m sorry, it was an accident.”
Cas leaned over, “Not to me. And this man is my hero.”
“Thank you, Castiel. Not so bad yourself. Can you slide down those pajamas for me?” He grinned cockily and licked his lips.
He frowned, because that was the opposite of what he wanted. “Hell, if I’m gonna do it, might as well go all in, right? Whatever your normal bet is, I’m in.”
conversation they have after ends with them both laughing about how late that conversation is.
down. We’re gonna find a way outta this mess. I promise.”
When Dean’s eyes finally looked up at Cas’ face, he was smiling.
Dean hissed, then let out a laugh. “Damnit, be nice.” He nudged him again, part of him hoping it would dissolve into a stupid play fight that would give him an excuse to get Cas on top of him.
And thus begins the slow, winding descent.
He grabbed Cas’ hand and put it over his crotch, where he was still soft. “Not much for you to taste yet.” He let go of Cas’ hand and wondered if the whole
Dean stood quickly, swearing under his breath. “Carmen! Wait, just... wait a damn minute. I did, okay? I fucked Cas. I’m sorry, shit got way out of hand but you’re right, I’m a piece of shit that should care about more than sex and I shouldn’t have done it.”
“I’m sorry. Mine died when I was fifteen.” Cas reached for Dean’s hand. “She was the lullaby type when I was young but not so much after I turned eight. She picked up a drug habit… go figure right?”
Dean’s eyes widened and he swallowed his candy. “Fucking same for the exact same reason. Don’t want none of that responsibility. I don’t even wanna be team captain.”
“Good, no one will hear him scream.” Dean blinked up the house, the rage on his face slowly melting into a mask of calm. His fingers closed around the zipper of his bag and he got out of the car, turning toward the house. “Get us inside, I’ll handle it from there.”
“I don’t normally, I just felt restless and wanted to feel it quicker. It isn’t a big deal Nick, not like it’s actual coke.” Cas brushed it off as always. “Let’s go home, you reek.” He joked, shoving Nick playfully.
. Dean doesn’t text back this time.
Cole laughs at the awkward situation and clasps his shoulder. “And don’t worry, we all go
Sam laughed, “Don’t call yourself that. It doesn’t mean what you think it means.”
Cas jumped up and walked over, a crazed look in his eyes. “Hands off what isn’t yours,
The pressure feels amazing, and Cas starts using both hands to fit them better. “So don’t use your imagination anymore. I’m always around... always want it.”
He was fully hard in seconds, stroking himself in sync with Cas’... wait, not Cas, with the
Michael and Dean were close in height, but Michael had him beat by an inch or two, so the quarterback was able to put Dean in a headlock without issue. Luckily, Dean was stronger, he broke out with ease and tried to pin Michael. It was all fun and games, but apparently teachers didn’t like fun. They ran out to break up what they thought was a real fight, and scolded them for playing violently. After a threat or two, they all moved on and went to the cafeteria for lunch.
He started making the journey back to Cas’ town and stopped to get gas in his Impala. When he was inside paying, he caught a snippet of a news story on the small tv above the register.
——————-
“You stay here.” He says plainly, still holding onto his hand.
Dean just looked at him, so Cas stood up and walked closer to see what he was reading. As he approached, he saw a photo of someone that
It took Cas forever to come out of that damn bathroom, and by the time he did, Dean was half ready to spill his guts all over the floor about how it wasn’t just sex, it was Cas’ eyes, his humor, his taste in music and movies and pie and that stupid, incredibly hot thing he did with his eyebrows - but all he managed to get out was, “Hi.”
Dean gasped, the sound coming out as more of a gurgle. He swallowed with difficulty and moved his hands in front of him for balance. “Yeah.”
There’ll be murder. I’m going to murder them all. After I see what that honey do… then murder!
Cas looked up, contemplating whether he should say anything, “She overdosed on heroin. That’s why I refused to try it, although I've had plenty of opportunities to.”
“Oh shit, I didn't know, sorry.”
out of you.” He smirked because that’s honestly what he was planning on doing. “And now you’re complaining about being treated in exactly the manner you’ve presented yourself. Seems to me you don’t know what you want, Castiel. Maybe I should come back once you do?”
He was tempted to ignore it - he was still buried inside of Cas and had everything he needed in his arms, but in the off chance it was important, he reached over and grabbed it. He didn’t bother looking before he answered, holding Cas close. “Better be a damn emergency.”
Cas blinks at Dean's response, then clears his throat and tries to cover it up. "What I meant is that it
“Yeah... the other thing, asshat.” Dean chuckles and scoots over. “I know you said you loved everyone, but we know you meant me more.” He straddles him and nods at the door. “Mojo us to the hood.”
“Not now. Not tomorrow. Not until you are my very
“If I found out that he touched you again after I explicitly warned him against doing such a dumbass thing?” He glanced at the ceiling, letting his mind wander to what he’d do to someone -
***********
“Fuck you, you’re in my house, Chere.” Benny walked over and put Dean in a headlock. They wrestled until one of them spilled a beer all over the carpet and then they all banded together to clean the mess. They always did come together when it mattered.
He picked up his phone and called Danny. He wasn’t a drug dealer by any means, but he was always the one with the pills.
Turned out that the project was much harder than anticipated. Dean was never known for having a gentle hand, and when it came to measuring shit for science, he was horrible. Cas had the softest hands he’d ever felt - not that he was paying attention to that - and he measured the liquids like a pro.
“Nah... don’t need it.” Dean pulls his own out and grabs the lube. “Just gonna watch you.”
He and Sam become best friends while the world moves on, because no matter what happens, neither of them
“Uhh…”
Cas frowned and stood up. “Okay, guess there’s no need.” He turned to grab his bag and disappeared into the bathroom.
that occasionally sucked him off?
Dean’s eyes glinted but he didn’t look at Castiel. He instead lowered his arm to Cas’ waist and dug his fingertips into him, knowing once upon a time, Dean had left bruises there. “Fine, if you don’t wanna bow out like a gentleman, I’ll let the angel tell you to fuck off. Castiel?”
Despite the fact that what he was asking for was absolutely cheating, Dean hadn’t really ever given any thought to fucking a dude. He was grateful Carmen seemed occupied while he had a fucking internal crisis, because the more he thought about sinking balls deep inside of Cas, the harder his dick became.
The phone slipped out of his hand and clattered to the carpet, and he picked it up quickly.
Cas grinned, “So if they were
“No.” Charlie sat up and leaned over to see him. “He has to have a connection with you first, he has to be attracted. He just cares more about the inside than what’s between your legs. ‘Hearts not parts’, that’s their motto.”
He asked concerned. They really needed that fucking money.
Dean does that adorable shrug he does that makes Cas want to simultaneously slap him and kiss him, but he can’t help but smile.
They let their mouths experiment while grinding into each other slowly. The kiss started slow and hesitant before becoming more heated by the second. Cas moaned into Dean's mouth again, and for the first time in his life, he considered bottoming. When Dean kissed down his neck Cas bared his neck, “I’ll bottom. I don’t care, but for the love of god, please tell me we’re fucking.”
“No actually, the burgers were your idea, I’m too full to walk now. You’re driving.” Nick began enjoying his pie.
“Fuck, me too.” Cas rocked up, wiggling his hips and clutching onto the pillow above his head.
"Am I allowed to? I didn't stick around last year to find out what happens after." Cas reaches up to brush Dean's cheek with his finger. "I'll stay as long as you'll let me."
Cas groaned, a huge grin on his face. “Sorry Dean. I’ll be a good boy.”
things.” Cas plopped on the couch. “Have you thought about it?” He changed the subject, and Dean was annoyed he knew exactly what Cas was talking about, though he wouldn’t show that.
They’d spent the night in Missouri, and when Dean woke up to the sunrise he found Cas still sleeping soundly. They needed to go on a supply run, they were out of nearly everything and they’d already been out of clean clothes for a couple of days, but he didn’t want to disturb his angel. Dean smiled fondly down at his healed initials permanently scarred into Cas’ chest and got dressed quietly, gathering the clothes and heading out to his car.
“Yes, Dean. Bacon. I bet there isn’t enough for everyone, seems like a first come first serve kinda deal.” Cas heard rustling, chuckling to himself at the fact that
Hannah continued to set the table. “I don’t believe I’ve met our dinner guest tonight.”
this was different.
So he reached out to wipe it off with his thumb, it was as if his hand had a mind of its own. “You’re a mess.” He teased, eyes locked with Cas’.
“Yeah?” Dean bucked up harder, staying with Cas’ pace as he reached down to wrap his fist around Cas’ leaking cock. “Gonna fuck you into this mattress later on.”
And maybe they weren't... maybe it wasn’t fair to lump them all into one box, especially whe- Dean smacked a girl's ass.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed, taking in every inch of Cas’ body but not being able to get over those damn eyes. “And here’s me, thinkin’ you were just a chick with a deep voice.”
“Hello, Dean. Can I still use my hands?”
Dean grips the base of his cock and bites his lip. “Can I taste you first?”
biting his cheek to keep from talking.
He rocks his hips, rolling to feel Dean’s cock moving inside of him as the space between them lessens. “Does this mean I can come now?” he rushes out, but the responding “no” comes too fast as Dean buries his face in Cas’ neck and bottoms out. Breathing becomes difficult as all the attention he has turns on Dean. He wraps his legs around that strong body and gets lost there — in the scent of him, the size of him, the sheer possession in each rough thrust that follows until he’s nearly screaming with the need to let go.
Cas frowned, “Wait, are you helping in the kitchen?”
John loved Dean. He would never deny that, but there were times he was hard on him and Dean didn't know if this would be one of those things. He was happy his dad wasn’t religious or he may have never found the courage to come out, but after being with Cas and realizing he was the one for him, Dean needed to share this with his dad.
“Alright, Cas. You can buy my coffee, but after that I wanna hear about this cow. I’ll get us some seats.” He winks and walks away before Cas can answer, but it doesn’t matter. Of course he’ll have coffee with Dean. His meeting can wait. The world can wait.
He didn’t care who he killed. His father had taught him enough about the overlays between hunting and law enforcement in his first few formative years that Dean was an expert at not only choosing victims that wouldn’t be missed, but covering his tracks so thoroughly that if he waited long enough, not even
He pulls off carefully, cleaning him off as he does. “Dean…” He glances down to wear his own length is nearly splitting his pants, then looks back up to meet Dean’s eyes. “I—”
Dean chuckled quietly as his breathing started to even out. "Sorry, Cas. You said I get to fuck
Nick sighed, “Dammit, Cassie.” Nick’s voice was small. “So, he isn’t under arrest? Why?”
Dean would have said no, because they’re
control of his entire body. He was panting and squirming and writhing beneath Cas, and a single tug to his balls had him coming down his angel’s throat with a roar that threatened to split his chest open.
Dean nodded, his body relaxing because this was going to be easier than he thought. “I was just here to ask some questions, I’d actually clocked off for the day... “ he nodded his head toward the Impala which was visible in the fading light of day, “but if you wanna press charges I’d be happy to take you back to the station.”
Dean’s eyes shoot up. “Nah, we’re still drinking and Charlie has games lined up and all that. Lisa just has to be patient.”
“Yeah? I’m glad to hear it.” The guinea pig squeaked and Cas’ eyes immediately pinned themselves to the cage.
“Good, so you can like
Castiel grinned, “See that just made me so hard.” He adjusted himself in his jeans.
Cas cursed loudly as he came, multiple hot spurts of white painting over Dean’s torso. He slowed, and leaned forward into Dean’s neck, feeling sated and full.
“Man… Should we just go to Vegas and get married then, or wait a while?” Dean’s joking but Cas is tempted to say yes.
That made Cas laugh out loud, “You know, I tried to cancel my membership but as it turns out, it was a lifetime commitment.”
and that realization turned Cas on.
“Pass the black, assbutt.” Cas reached for the can, not turning to see if Nick was complying.
Dean opened and closed his mouth about twelve times, unsure how exactly he was supposed to respond to that. He was straight, Carmen knew that, so the entire thing was fucking ludicrous… right?
Dean ran his hands over Cas’ body and leaned in to kiss his chest. “So, we’re good?”
And he’d be damned if he wasn’t going to get some revenge. Hell, he was damned anyway. Dean pushed himself to his feet, letting out a guttural snarl as he pulled the blade from Cas’ chest and turned, screaming, “You took him from me!”
The weekend with Dean was absolutely the best weekend Cas had had in a long time. He planned on staying one night, but when Saturday evening rolled around, they still couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Dean gave Cas some clothes to wear after a steamy shower together, and Cas ended up staying until the very last minute on Sunday. They both had work in the morning, and neither were ready to say goodbye, but Cas forced himself to walk out the door.
“Yeah, you were.” Dean turned his head to kiss Cas’ palm. “No one was more surprised than me, but the thought of actually following through with it made me nauseous.”
Cas looked up at Dean, “How did I lie?”
“What?” Dean can tell through the phone Nick already regrets his text.
He hit send, then when Carmen quit giving him that 'what are you up to' look and turned away, he looked back at the screen and was mortified by the typos.
Cas came
He squeezed his hand tighter, lifting Dean up slightly.
” broke through the silence.
“Because Charlie asked me if you could have my number about three minutes ago, and now my phone is ringing. It was an educated guess. You’re drunk.”
He dug his back into the pew behind him and braced his feet, his hands tightening around Cas’ waist to lift him up. He bit his lip and looked down, watching Cas’ cock bounce as he drilled into him. “You look so fuckin’ good like this, Cas. Covered in blood and riding my cock.”
Dean was fucking torn, on one hand, he didn’t want to say
blood. “Bite me harder next time baby, or maybe I can just bite you and taste your blood while I ride you against this raggedy cross.” Cas rutted up against Dean. “You gonna let me up?”
It was hot and strange and overwhelming, and he tried halfheartedly to squirm away.
- the control this was about to bring him. He didn’t care if Cas gave up that control willingly or not. He climbed up onto the bed with the rope between his teeth and handcuffed Cas’ wrists together behind his back. He laid Cas down, fashioning a type of noose around his neck and securing it to the headboard. With anyone else, he’d have continued without a word. But this was Cas, and
Seriously, feel.” Cas reached out and took Dean’s hand, bringing it to the bare skin of Cas’ stomach. “So, yes. It makes me want to be
Dean shuddered, leaning in to lick a line down Cas’ throat. “Fucking tease.”
“Grip that pretty cock, but don’t move your fist.” Dean never slowed down or sped up, he hit Cas’ prostate perfectly with each thrust and once again, Cas did as told. He gripped his leaking cock and let Dean’s thrusts keep all control.
Dean wasn’t sure how to respond. He had a time not long ago, where he followed in John’s footsteps with the bottle so he definitely wasn’t judging Cas for falling down a familiar path of addiction. Dean thought about how Nick had been reacting to Cas these past couple months and realized how good of a brother he was. He never mentioned their mother, but it made sense why Nick took a chance with a cop. He cared more about Cas’ survival than whether Cas would ever talk to him again, and it made Dean want to help bring them back together.
Nick’s jaw dropped. “Let me get this straight. My little brother reached out asking for a ride, which we both know he
"What makes you think you're not a real criminal?”
Cas thrusts up, burying himself deep in that tight, hot throat. It doesn't take him long at all to be shaking and babbling praises, guiding Dean’s head almost uselessly because he's doing such a damn good job on his own. “Dean, I—”
how he normally looked after a kill. Which makes sense, because this wasn’t a kill. He’d failed, and for what? Because some broken little whore managed to hang on long enough to make him come? He smacked the lamp on the bedside table so hard it shattered against the wall. With a feral growl he upended the dresser with the tv still on it, the plug separating from the outlet with such force that the cord came back and snapped him. He fumbled in his bag for the knife he’d planned on using to kill Castiel and dragged the tip of the blade across his arm. The pain leveled his nerves and the blood quickly coating his hand quieted the voices. They weren’t gone, not this time, but they were better. He laid down on the bed, curling in on himself and holding pressure to his self-inflicted wound until he finally quit shaking enough to fall asleep.
“Cas is already a nickname. Should be easy enough to remember.”
something I like to think about.
Cas was completely surprised but not about to argue with Dean. He climbed inside and took a moment to check out his split knuckles. “David has texted me multiple times, apologizing. I haven’t responded.”

“Cole? Why?” He isn’t the
He should have gotten into his car and drove home. But instead, he sat back down with a grunt, thinking of everything that had just happened and everything he allowed this
“Merry Christmas, angel. You’re proof that miracles happen… and I can’t friggin wait to spend every damn Christmas by your side.”
Cas takes his time working his way back down Dean’s body, kissing, biting and marking just about every inch. “You’re more than I ever thought I could have, Dean. I won’t take this for granted.”
He had been teased more than a few times for being too punctual, and was trying not to be so damn predictable. Cas had planned on pressing the submit button at 4:59pm on the dot, just to see if anyone would notice, and now here he was staring down at his
“Thanks but I just wanted to help. No need to thank me.”
Cas hopped off the counter and turned off the flame, he didn’t have a clue what Dean was trying to cook so he didn’t attempt to help, just walked over to take more pills and then sat on the couch.
“Mmmm.” Cas pushed back and then rolled over, a sleepy smile across his lips. He moved to straddle Dean and rutted against him, letting him feel how hard he was, too. “Fuck me, let me ride this dick.”
“You promise?” Cas asked, staring into Dean’s eyes. There was a time Cas found Dean’s eyes intimidating. Maybe because they were like jade flames, and he was just a helpless moth, or maybe it was simply the intensity behind them. Either way, from the very beginning, he saw what was behind those eyes, and he was instantly addicted. “Promise me,
“Don’t be shy now, Cas. Tell me what you want.”
“Okay… yeah.” Dean moaned at the first contact with his dick and he
He said
Cole was drinking - of course - and acting weird. Guys always got weird with booze and he thought it was a good idea to climb the tree to look for the campsite.
Carmen smiled widely at Dean’s face and shook her head. “I’m an awesome girlfriend.”
Dean pulled the towel off the cage. “Dunno, angel. You all of a sudden scared of rodents?”
yeah fuck into me.”
He groaned when Dean slid in his fingers and closed his eyes, giving Dean all control.
He clears his throat and sits up, licking some of the mess off his hand. “I... honestly prefer feeling it. But yes, it’s still incredibly hot.”
The funeral is packed with Dean’s loved ones and he listens to stories about him for hours, each story making him fall more and more in love with someone that is already gone.
Dean drove over,
Cas takes a bite, nodding in agreement a second later. “It sure is.”
“Okay, but hear me out. A bag of sugar is less than three dollars, Dean. Have you ever wondered why your internet is so good?” Cas wasn’t mad in the slightest, but this was definitely the most entertaining conversation he’d had in months… maybe years.
Rose flattened her palm against Dean’s chest and stood on her tiptoes. “I’ve decided you’re
“Shit, seriously?” Dean looked back at the TV as though he thought Cas was lying, and his blush deepened. “I knew that. Was just... making sure
he’d have to worry about her. Sure, Cas might occasionally fuck chicks for money, he didn’t know the details and didn’t care to - but it was overly obvious what his angel’s preferences were. She smiled back at him looking a little unnerved, and after she left their table he popped a fry in his mouth. “Good. Don’t give me a reason to do more than scare him, yeah?”
Dean smiled, “Who’s askin?” Jo smacked his arm. “I’m kidding. She’s at work like most adults we know. I’ll tell her you asked.”
Cas used the towels to clean up the blood and then wrapped Dean in a blanket. He grabbed their kit and put a bandage on the cuts so they could lay together. “You okay baby?” Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Cas climbed in the backseat with a groan and shut the door. Dean opened his door and saw Cas in the backseat, “You’re just so used to being back there huh?” Dean climbed in the driver's seat and turned on the car.
“Nothing. Although he did have a compelling argument for weed. I... we thought it was best if he got completely sober first. Spoiler alert, he’s still a snarky asshat.” Dean was happy no one could see his dumb grin. “Have you tried to reach out?”
.” Cas put a finger under the man’s chin and tilted his gaze up to meet his. Cas examined his mouth, once again, wrong. This wasn’t
“It’s okay, Dean. You don’t have to say it back, there’s no rush or anything. But one of the things I’ve been working on is how to effectively communicate what I
Dean groans as his grip tightens around his cock. He was already close, but Cas telling him to come
“Your air quotes are adorable, you know that?” Dean visibly checked him out and Cas forced his gaze away. He was sure Dean had a girlfriend.
“You tryna get a New Years Kiss, Cas?” Dean tries to grin cockily but he knows he just looks like an idiot.
Charlie and Cas made their way back a while later — after a few more purple cup dudes took a shot — and sat down next to Dean. Charlie had a purple cup… so there was no way purple automatically meant douchebag. Another friend of hers had a red cup and the other, another purple. Cas and Dean were the only orange.
about how close he was in case Cas tried to edge him again, but on the other hand... he still wasn’t the type of guy to come down someone’s throat without a warning. His thoughts were jumbled and he could barely speak, but he tried. “Come, gonna - can I - fuck, lemme come!”
He huffed a laugh as he shrugged on a red, long sleeved flannel over a black t-shirt and bent over to tie his boots. “Might have to chop down a tree, Chuckles. Don’t hate.”

surprised, not in the slightest, but he still has no words. He flicks on the light, and both of their boyfriends have to shield their eyes from the brightness, giving Castiel and Ares great views of their glorious cocks. “I was going to ask how the hell they convinced us to date them, but... I mean, I see the bright green appeal.”
time to discover he had a panty kink. That’s what it was, right? It was the lace blue thong disappearing between two perfect cheeks and no doubt barely containing a leaking, straining cock...
He had just the right amount of liquor inside him to not give a fuck. He wasn’t drunk by any means, but he was buzzed just enough to have no self preservation. “What if I prefer the dark, Dean?” He asked with his back turned. “What if the light is just a reminder of what‘s missing inside? It’s the darkness that gets my dick hard...
Suddenly, Cas grunts and starts moving a little faster, carefully fucking Dean’s face. “I’m close, do you — shit, do you want me to let you go?”
was about as easy of a target as Dean had ever found. He preferred men, but... she would have to do. He slid off the barstool and caught her gaze. He could tell she recognized him by the way her lips turned up in a smile, and he couldn’t help but wonder if she’d sound prettier gagging on his cock, or on her own blood. Guess he’d just have to find out. He motioned for her to join him outside after making sure no one else would see the movement. She hesitated for a moment, but a quick sweep of her eyes over his broad shoulders and chiseled jaw had her asking the bartender to close her tab. He was out waiting by his car when she finally came out.
And when Cas undid his pants, Dean didn’t stop him. “Open your eyes. I want you to look at me when you answer me.” He squeezed and released his neck but kept his hand there. “Did you prep tonight?”
“You look cold, Novak.” Dean ruffled the snow out of his messy hair.
“You’re alive. Miracle is alive. Everything else was just stuff. And I know it might not feel that way right now but you being alive is what matters. If something happened to you— that’s not the point. I won’t make this about me. Let’s not think about it for a while. Sniff the air.”
“Not right now, listen Cas, you have two choices okay, you can sign yourself up for detox or you can come to my house and do it.” Dean refused to give Cas another option.
Dean slid off just as he pressed his first finger to Cas’ hole. “I’m glad you wanted to bottom, baby.” He didn’t know what he would do if Cas wanted to top, but he probably would have caved.
Cas whimpers as he shoves his jeans and boxers down and takes his first look at Dean’s throbbing member. “Fuck…” he laps at the tip, his eyes closing in bliss and he suddenly can’t decide what he wants. He wants to suck every drop of come from Dean’s balls until he’s shoving him away but he also wants to bounce on this long thick cock until he’s coming all over Dean’s stomach untouched. He dives in, unable to hold back anymore.
want. And I... want you to know that I love you.” Cas’ bright blue eyes were warm and fixed on Dean’s as his hand brushed Dean’s cheek. “Nut is just another reason on an already very long list.”
, Dean never responded.
Nick pulled Cas away, against his wishes before he could talk again. He was interested in this Winchester man but Nick was adamant he kept his mouth shut. Any time Cas walked close to Dean, Nick was there to pull him away.
Cas chuckled, everything was making sense now. “Dean, did they all have purple cups? All these people you
“Dean.” He stared in awe as he caught his breath. “There is no way that was your first time sucking a dick. That was incredible!”
Ready to head out?” No one had ever really wanted to hang out before they fucked, it was just what was expected, why draw it out? “My studio is two blocks from here.”
Which was precisely the problem. Dean would give up all the little things he loved doing, just to appease Cas. That wasn’t fucking fair.
Dean kept a rough grip on Castiel’s hair as he guided his length over the man’s bottom lip, spreading the precum over the pink, chapped skin. He pulled his cock just out of reach. Finally back in control, he was no longer in such a hurry. “Lick your lips. Tell me how I taste.”
“No. Not yet… but take it out.” Dean could hear shuffling on Cas’ end, and wondered if he was doing the same. Before he could ask, Cas spoke again. “Mine is out. If that helps.”
kill. He flagged down their waitress and got their food boxed up, paid in cash, and they walked out to the Impala with their heads down. Dean threw the boxes in the back seat and relaxed his shoulders once they were back on the road - but his hands were wrapped tight around the wheel.
“My turn? Alright.” Dean grabs Cas’ laptop and searches for a good video. It doesn’t take long to find one and he hands it back to Cas to work his magic and get it on the bigger screen.
to make Dean bleed.
beautiful. But Dean also knew this didn’t look good. Cas
Besides feeling disgusting, Cas had to huff a laugh at that and hoped the guy lost sleep over it.
Cas didn’t bother to look at the men, he kept his hand over his eyes, blocking out the sunlight.
They could hear the sirens off  in the distance, and Dean had to hope he’d kept up with Baby’s engine enough that she could still outrun a couple of backwoods police cruisers. He pulled onto the highway and within moments, his rear view mirror was lit up red and blue. He glanced at Cas. “Together?”
“Alright I have two apple and one cherry, fight it amongst yourselves, I’m not pie picky.”
Sorta? Hmph.
But no one bothered them.
He felt like he failed, except there was no
She always stays inside for the sunrise. He never let her read that letter. He couldn’t let anyone read it, but he didn’t have to. Charlie just somehow… knew. She knew those few moments each morning — along with that letter — were for Dean and Cas, and she never once tried to insert herself into those. Dean would never be able to thank her enough.
he’d run for the damn hills if I showed up. It’s been too long since I actually had to lure someone in like that.” Dean took a sip of the whiskey and relished the burn in his throat. “You think you're ready for your first solo kill?”
Cas followed him, lost in his own thoughts.
Cas chuckled and shook his hand. “Hello, Dean. Nice to meet you.” He pulled him in and straddled him again. “You’re valid to me.”
“Fuck,” Cas gasped, pushing Dean back far enough that Cas could grip his cock and start stroking quickly. Dean was fucking him so well Cas was seeing stars - and he was way too far gone to deny himself the orgasm that was mounting so quickly it was insane. He clenched around Dean as he rolled his hips to fuck his fist and grunted. “I - I can’t - hold - I’m gon -” Cas came so hard he was surprised his soul stayed in his body, and Dean just kept fucking him, pounding into him harder until Cas was drained and boneless, covered in his own spend.
He takes the condom and rolls it on, huffing a laugh at how ridiculous he looks. But one glance at Ares tells him he's not alone, and the second the lights are off again and the music is back on, Cas smacks Dean’s length with his own.
I’d swallow your load in two minutes
Dean’s eyes gave his thoughts away.
Dean pushed back with a deep laugh. “Fuck, yeah... own me, Castiel.”
And there it was, Nick’s wall became sound. “Woah, you really think I would rat on my brother?” Dean could see the anger on Nick’s face. “He isn’t a drug addict okay. Can I close the door now?” If Dean wasn’t a cop, Nick would have slammed the door a long time ago.
he was still setting an unforgiving pace as he fucked Castiel into the floor in front of the cross. But his focus, all of it, was on those blue eyes. Even as Castiel’s face started to redden and swell from the lack of blood or oxygen to his head, the light
Dean grunts and fights the urge to throw his head back in pleasure, but he
“Better not. I get it, I played football too, son. I know the parties are all a part of the lifestyle, but you gotta be smart. One of my colleagues shows up next time, I’m letting them take you to the drunk tank.”
Cas got up to use the bathroom and when he returned, he sat even closer so their arms were against each other. He glanced over and looked like he wanted to say something, but before Dean could ask, he spoke. “Pretty soon, your shirt won’t have any room for your amazing qualities.”
More… aggravating. You know how sometimes it snows, and your skin becomes dry and sensitive and can even be itchy?” She nodded. “Sort of like that.” Hannah grabbed his hand unexpectedly, surely to test him and released it the second she saw his eyes widen and his body tense.

“Course. I kinda liked you watchin’ me last time,” he admits with a blush and then starts sliding down his basketball shorts. “Was it okay I watched you, too?”
“You know that isn’t what I meant. You’ll still eat the entire pie, so does it really matter?”

Dean exhaled a deep breath and walked inside.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t call, my phone was dead and by the time I got done speaking to the police, I just wanted to get here.” He handed Dean his iphone, “Can I borrow your charger? I realized all too late I forgot mine.” His eyes widened at the box on the dining table, “Pizza.” Cas handed Dean his phone, rushing to wash his hands to grab a slice, not even bothering with a plate.
for a ride, even in the rain. Yet, he asked
Their simultaneous “no’s” are enough to make the others turn and watch, but Cas refuses to be embarrassed. “No objections here.”
Cas enjoyed the
Dean smiled a little bit. "Yeah, I get it's hard for you to see yourself. You'll get there." He patted his shoulder and called for everyone to get back to work. Dean couldn’t help but notice Cas looked...
“Nice to meet you, Castiel. You get a drink already?” Dean nods toward the kitchen and starts to make his way over, pleased when Cas follows.

a picture of him to remember him by, so he walked over to grab the Polaroid he’d set by the lantern. When he turned to snap the picture, his breath caught in his lungs. The angle was perfect, something he wouldn’t have even thought to stage - on his knees, Castiel’s body blocked out that of the angel on the stained glass window behind him. The wings of the angel rose up on either side of Cas...
“I fucking missed you.” Cas nearly jumped into Dean’s arms, slamming their mouths together.
“Shut up. One thing at a time, big boy.” Dean turned to make his way to the living room.
“Nah,” he says. “It’s fine. Don’t need my head today.” It’s a joke, but it helps Cas’ conscience, and when they lock eyes for the first time, Castiel is lost in a sea of green.

Dean,

to slap the shit out of Cas too but he still felt protective of him.
Not even my girlfriend, who also thinks that asshole walks on water. I open up and tell you and you go radio silence on the other end, like he’s more important to you than he is to me. It’s
“Fuck off, Red!” Dean barks, but he pulls back and takes Cas’ hand anyway. “Come on, she’s lucky I’m thirsty.”
That was what it finally took for him to realize he spent the entirety of the night nearly crying over a fuck. It was
“Right. Dean likes all desserts, but hasn’t fucked them all. Got it.”
“Why would I watch it if you have already given me the play by play?” Cas instantly walked into Dean’s arms and inhaled his comforting scent. Suddenly all was right in the world.
"A good wall to tag." Dean wasn't fazed in the least, gazing at him. "This time isn't counting towards your hours you know.”
When he started feeling pressure on the back of his throat, he had a brief moment of panic because he barely felt like he’d taken any of him - but he’d had enough experiences chugging beers that he knew how to open his damn throat. He did, closing his eyes at the tight squeeze and forcing his head down further - belatedly remembering he had hands that worked. Dean’s fist closed around the shaft and he worked them together, sucking as he twisted and pumped until his muscles got used to the stretch.
Cas was taken by surprise when Dean fucked his throat so hard it caused them both pain. Tears leaked from Cas’ eyes but he didn't pull away. He was just as curious about his own limits as Dean but more importantly, Castiel
Dean let him rant and unfortunately didn’t have an answer. “No, you’re right I’m sorry. I was just taking a moment to process. I didn’t realize it was that bad.”
He was beautiful in a way things in Dean’s life never were. It wasn’t blood or gore or pain that made him hold Dean’s attention, it was his face. The eyes he could swear were bluer than oceans even in the low light, still several feet away. The defiance in his eyes that in this case, made Dean want to break him
Not like warm apple pie, or fresh brewed coffee, or that damned delicious cologne that Cas has never smelled on another man and his brain has already linked to Dean Winchester. The love of his life.
rest, they’d never make it. Dean nodded and squeezed Cas’ knee. “Yeah. C’mon.”
. I just want to help. I want to
The next thing he knows, Cas is pushing him down and climbing into his lap, grinding down and kissing him heatedly again. "Let me ride you."
Dean heard a clicking of a tongue and a low, deep laugh, before he was sliding back inside of Cas’ sinful mouth.
When he woke up the next morning, Cas had already texted and not only that, he sent a photo.
When Dean pulled into the driveway he put the car in park and turned to face Cas, his leg up on the seat. He started mumbling some bullshit on how proud he is of Cas for sticking to legal walls and
“You were picturing me? You looked for me?”
“So fucking hot.” Dean bit down where Cas’ neck meets his shoulder and buried himself inside of him as he released.
Derek instantly punched him in the face, but Cas was only staggering for a second before he swung back and Anthony ran over to help his brother.
It’s better than anything Dean’s ever felt before and he breaks the kiss to watch. “Cas…” he moans, rutting into his hand and gripping the sheets in pleasure.
would do?” He said, making his way behind David, whose body convulsed in fear.
Cas chuckled. “I was going to ask you why Harry, but it makes sense. You’re absolutely a Gryffindor.”
Cas rolled his eyes as he stood up and made his way toward the door. “You should know me better than that. It was a midget with giant feet and a red nose,” Cas almost said
Cas laid awake that night, entirely unable to sleep. He knew that sooner or later, he’d have to come up with a better excuse than “I’m not in the mood to scene” for Michael at least, but probably Balt and Cole as well. But the truth was, he didn’t have one. At least, not one he was willing to share with the others. Dean’s words kept replaying in his head every time he thought about scening:
was where his devil was when he wasn’t
They arrived there a few moments later and Cas pointed out the house. “He lives alone and has a damn sex dungeon downstairs. It’s even soundproof.” Cas added, ignoring the thrill that traveled up his spine.
By the time Dean returned, the sun was setting and Cas had already packed up and was sliding on his backpack, ready to start his walk home. He smiled widely and climbed in the front seat of Baby.
“Fucking hell, Cas. Shit, you sound so good. You’re not overstepping even a little,” he rushed out, struggling to form words that weren’t directly related to
“What are you talking about? Everyone got off last time, Dean. And honestly I don’t think you even need me. I feel like it was distracting for you to be pulled in two different directions. I don’t mind stepping out.” She continued cleaning the kitchen like they were talking about the damn weather.
for?”
he wanted seconds.”
It actually catches Cas so off guard he’s the one blushing now, and Dean feels like he won that round as he takes a bite of his own, moaning and pounding his fist on the counter dramatically. “Now that’s a fucking sandwich.”
Michael huffs a laugh. “Oh, I'm sure you'll have some stories of your own after tonight. This is easily the best night of the year for those.”
“I’ll take a beer, but I gotta drive in a bit so no whiskey. Want a beer, too?”
spiel and it worked. He gave the address without question.
He laughed again, the uneasiness ebbing away. “Better bring your appetite for more than pie.”
“Fuck, you’re perfect just like
Dean reached around and squeezed Cas’ cock, barreling into him. “Come for me, angel.”
Cas smiled gently and kissed his cheek. “I love you too, Dean. Happy birthday. Maybe for Valentine’s Day we can go traumatize
Cas chuckled and shrugged. “You can’t give good head if you don’t enjoy giving head. It’s impossible. She dumped him after I told her.”

His scowl deepened. “If he was hesitant about

Michael pulled off Cas’ cock and Cas didn’t even glance down. He considered it, but he wasn’t about to lose this battle.

Cas bit back a laugh at the
“Order up, orange cup as per request.” He held up his cup for a cheers and Cas’ entire face fell. It was only a split second and if Dean wasn’t already watching him so closely, he would have missed it.
“Hey...” She plopped on his lap. “I missed you this week. You seem... distant.”
"No, but now that you're stripping..." Jask waddles over to the table and grabs another condom, shoving it at Ares. "Join us, babe. My boner isn't going away anytime soon."
more time over at Dean and Charlie’s apartment since he’d had that conversation with the others. They’d all been cool about it, and no one had heard from Michael in a couple of months, so now the only obstacle to their happiness… was them.
“I don’t?!” She looked offended but brushed it off. “Fine, one of my best friends loves giving head. Want me to call them? I don’t mind if it’s just an occasional BJ. It’s not actual sex, so it doesn’t even count. Just... no kissing.”
Just as David was taking Cas out of his jeans, he saw Dean’s head round the corner and grinned. Cas could see the pure jealousy in Dean’s eyes and blew him a challenging kiss.
Dean visibly relaxes and brings their cups together, then takes it with a grin. “Fuck, I thought you were for a second there. When you said you didn’t know how you felt, I th— never mind. More drink or you wanna go bob for dongs?”
Dean pulled off, standing up quickly to kiss him. “Not yet, angel. Fix your jeans, we weren’t done with Mr. Jones.”
Dean growled at the sight, wanting to leave a hundred more. “Beautiful, babe. Beautiful.” He slammed up, grunting and moaning at how good his ass felt as he fisted Cas’ cock faster. “Gonna come on me again? Loved how that felt last night.”
it to be a one-time deal… almost needed it to be. He’d spent the last five days thinking about that damn blowjob almost constantly. It bothered the hell out of him that Cas didn’t get off, and also that he’d enjoyed it way more than he thought he would. “Wait, you seriously want to do it again?”
Carmen was wearing his favorite lace one piece with her breasts exposed and she bit her lip. “Lay down, handsome.” She helped him lay back, kissing along his neck and brought up her blindfold. “I just heard the front door... put this on.”
“Good.” Cas ran his hand along Dean’s chest. Staring down at his body, it felt like Cas admired every single inch of Dean. “I don’t want to hold back.” He reached and tweaked Dean’s nipple.
“Oh, it’s that time, huh? Get ready, bitches. Time to Bob for Dongs. And remember, if you catch it in your mouth, it’s yours to keep. Winner probably just gets laid first.”
judgement.” She held out her bottle to cheer and he did. “Let’s not focus on that, how about we put some smiles on our faces before Cas walks through that door. You know he’s sensitive after sessions and anything can trigger whether that makes for a really good day, or a shitty one.”
Cas moaned and nodded, “Please let me come.” But before Dean could answer, Castiel came.
to wink, but Cas has never winked very well, and walked back inside to work before he got caught.
this mysterious Cas doppelgänger also has a similar name.
Dean froze, his heart breaking for Cas, but also relieved he wasn’t reliving some traumatic life event. It made him wonder what kind of mom Cas had and if she was anything like Mary - the type to sing to their children at night.
Dean pulls him up, insisting on helping him prep and after the way he kisses Cas like he’s chasing his own flavor, Cas is unable to deny him.

“Wow… That was fast.” Cas smiled over at him, surprisingly impressed.
of blowjobs in his life, but was there ever really a good time? Dean liked to think he was pretty generous in the sack, he always made sure Carmen got off at least twice before he did, and he never shied away from weird shit she wanted to try. So, why the hell was she looking at him like he’d asked for something ridiculous when all he wanted was a little quid-pro-quo?
As if he wasn’t pretty otherwise. And what if he
They both want it. They’ve wanted it for years, so what the hell is holding them back? Deciding to go for it, Dean starts to roll and face Cas and when his eyes lock with those bluer than blues, he loses himself in them for only a moment before he kisses him.
“Thank you.” Cas smiled. He didn’t ask why Dean was proud or try to convince him it wasn’t a big deal, and even that was progress with Cas.
Dean narrowed his eyes and stayed right where he was. “Why?”
“You okay?”
“I thought you were a top?” Dean attempted to tease but it was very obvious Cas wasn’t in the mood.
Dean heard their room door close, that damn deep chuckle, and the familiar sound of a zipper, all before the bed moved. He could feel Cas looming over him and then suddenly he felt that ridiculous tongue, not on his cock, but on his hip.
Cas nodded. “You’re right. What will we do for money? I want to contribute in some way but I suck at pool. Is there a way I could help?”
I will go to your house and punch your bitchass face. Got it?! Tell me what he took so
“Put more of your hand in there.” Dean’s cock twitched, but he hesitated a moment.
Nick slapped his cheek affectionately. “Shut your mouth, Cassie.”
“Oh.” Nick actually looked sad for him and it made Cas feel even worse about it. “Well… When you do, we’d love to meet them.”
since he’d come without copious amounts of blood. The second he reminded himself of this, the creeping threat of orgasm retreated. When he felt Cas twitch under him he pulled out, impressed with how long he handled Dean’s all out assault but also not wanting to actually kill him yet. He kept his hand in Cas’ hair and jerked his head up to look into those insanely blue eyes. “Take your plug out. Now.”
He pumped gas, filled up a few spare cans of gas, got snacks and then headed back to the hotel. “Stay here, we don’t want his DNA anywhere near our hotel room.” Cas ran upstairs and got all of their clothes packed and made a couple trips down with their stuff, packing up the car and then climbing back inside. “Okay, drive somewhere secluded so you can change.”
The tears in Cas’ eyes only egged him on until he realized he was actually close to orgasming in his throat... and there was hardly any blood. Only the small bite mark on Castiel’s shoulder and it had been
“Sorry. Sorry.
His spank bank needed the material.

Several hours later, Dean woke up. Cas was snoring quietly, his hair messy and sticking up at odd angles and his chest was rising softly. He looked so perfect like this it was almost painful to look at. Dean smiled and closed his eyes again, letting his mind wander to all of the things they could have been if their lives had been different. If

“I uh- no. I was going to call... or text. Would it be better if I just went over? Or is that creepy?”

“Life never stops hurting when we’re alive and when it does, we’re dead.” Beating around the bush has never been one of Dean’s strong points.
“We’ll be taking a...

Cas’ name rolled off Dean’s tongue before he could stop it, and it just kept coming, he whispered and moaned that name like a prayer as he came, buried balls deep in that tight, glorious ass and then Cas reached behind him and pulled him in even closer.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Yeah, not gonna happen, Cas.”
“Hey, son, what were you doing with that girl? Are you using protection?”
came inside of a victim, with or without protection. Sex was too messy, too violent, to unpredictable to trust that he wouldn’t leave anything behind. His pulse pounded in his ears as he realized he couldn’t kill Castiel
Jesse felt a cold chill go down his spine, “I... I kissed him but he pulled away.”
Cas huffs a bitter laugh and grabs a bottle of whiskey from the cupboard. “I don’t think you want me to answer that.”
Can you make a trip to Hell during a quarantine?
Not only did he just realize he was actually gay as hell, he’d kissed a boy. Not just any boy, Dean Winchester. Dean could have anyone he wanted. Why the hell was he suddenly interested in Cas? Cas wasn’t ‘ugly’ by any standards, but he still never stood out on anyone’s radar, especially someone as attractive as Dean. He was nerdy, completely uncoordinated, his humor was dry, and he carried himself like he was just done with everyone’s shit… because he was.
He backed up and bumped the wall. “Oops. I’ll just…” He pointed to walk away, but Charlie grabbed his arm with a worried expression.
Benny moved in Michael’s spot, along with Cole, they made out and sucked Dean’s gorgeous cock but Cas couldn’t watch that anymore. Michael always gave him more attention than anyone else and was laying him back on the couch and sucking his way down to his cock, mouthing at the panties.

him. He hated the bond Cas and I shared.”
“Nope. Love my cock too much for that. You made it real hard to sneak out now.” He chuckled and fixed his jeans.
Cas looked down at the map and started discussing their route.
Cas cried out happily and nodded, “Yes, Dean. Please.”
He ran his hand over Cas’ leg and leaned forward again, continuing his quest to kiss and touch and
He feels Cas before he can open his eyes and he’s almost positive he’s already awake… his dick sure is and Dean is just too damn sleepy to fight what he’s wanted for too damn long. He pushes back, biting his lip and he feels all of Cas’ length, making his own cock twitch.
Everything was looking good, and going smoothly, so when Cas woke up in one of his moods,it caught
He shoved the front of Cas’ panties down and started stroking him, continuing his quest to mark the hell out of Cas’ neck. “Good. Keep cookin’.”
“I actually want to freakin’ nap. My period is coming.”
“No. But I bet if I did invite her over Facebook and told her Dean Winchester would be there, she would come.” She picked up her phone for good measure.
“I wasn’t lying. That’s probably against the law,
When Dean rejected him, yet again, Cas moved on to another
“Fucking asshole!” Dean tossed his phone, and hoped he didn’t crack his screen, but he was too angry to care.
For Dean, Saturday was hardly any different than a Wednesday. There wasn’t school - obviously - but he was still surrounded by idiots.
Dean was tempted, hell if Nick wasn’t here he probably would have. “Nah, enjoy Cas. You earned it.”
He knew he was gay from a young age. Back when it wasn’t “okay” to be gay or different. They prayed for him to change, even set him up on dates. Nothing worked. It wasn’t a phase, it was who he was.
Cas’ legs tightened as he gripped the couch, his plump, bottom lip was tight between his teeth. He didn’t say anything, but Dean could feel he was pleased.
“Yeah, please do.” Dean kissed him, his hands wrapping around the small of his back as his tongue slipped inside Cas’ mouth for the first time.
orgasm every time you move. There’s more, but I can’t describe those feelings with words.”
He snorts a little, but nods his agreement and forces himself to take a step back. “It’s a good thing we have multiple bathrooms, hm?”
Dean watched him go with a small smile playing across his lips. He wasn’t convinced he was going to let it happen, but if Cas looked
“Uh… never mind.”

David slipped in the blood covering the ground and his wrist broke with a loud
Leave this town and start fresh - again. Because it was easier to leave than be left and he was sure everyone here was sick and tired of his shit.
He didn't know why it bothered him so damn much, but it did. Not seeing Cas again after just finding him seemed like putting down a book before the end of the first chapter, or quitting a movie trilogy halfway through the first one.
“Bossy, hmm?” Cas grabbed his backpack and walked over to the couch, sitting with a plop. “All yours.”
“I didn’t try. I laid back and then woke up to you coming home. Don’t remember anything in between.” He shrugged and took a long drink.
Nick stood up and walked outside motioning for Dean to follow, “Are these really our
Nick rolled his eyes, “The way you act when your high as shit Cas. I’m not stupid.” Nick needed to find out what else Cas was using. “You’re also acting like you want

The atmosphere in the kitchen was light and joyous as he entered the room, which was a much needed change after the last several days. “Morning, assholes! Party’s over, huh?” Dean grinned and swiped a piece of bacon from the plate.
People sucked. Cas knew that and anyone who denied it was kidding themselves. Dean walked around like things were fine, like the world wasn't going to shit around them and it was borderline infuriating.
Online classes are pretty lame, but there’s something about online improv that Dean enjoys. If you ask him, he’s pretty damn awesome at improvising, but he's phenomenal when it’s over a screen. Now they have to actually meet up with a classmate. He’s a little nervous when he types up his partner search ad, but he thinks it’ll be fun.
Jesse stepped forward, worried for Cas, he felt this man was violent. “Do you need me to call the cops Castiel?”
“I’m actually getting that on a shirt. How’d you know?” He grinned. “One more, thanks.”
Dean nods feverishly, his cock already throbbing in anticipation. He cants his hips so Cas can lower his jeans, biting his lip at how hungrily Cas stares at his exposed length. “Love how you love suckin’ me off.”
Side note: Carol Baskins DEFINITELY killed her husband.
Cas chuckled and handed him a purple cup. “Now you see why I had hoped you wouldn’t get orange.” He held up his own cup and shook it slightly.
They hadn’t talked about college yet, and it was probably time to do that, but not today. Today was all about burgers and cake.
Dean inside of him. He moaned loudly after the slap. “Oh fuck, please, fuck me.” Did he just beg?
He'd have dropped his phone again if he wasn't clutching it so damn tightly already. That sounded stupidly, unbelievably hot, and he already knew he'd be actually taking that shower now just to rub one out at the thought.

Cas did. Without hesitation, and he could feel the pleased energy radiating off of Dean. He held his wrist behind his back, focused his eyes on the floor and waited… and waited… until finally... “Please.”
But Dean didn't give a shit about the room, his eyes followed Cas the entire way. He thought he caught a glimpse of angry, reddened skin when he removed his jacket but he wasn't sure. He stepped closer and grabbed Cas' wrist, inspecting it. Sure enough, it looked like someone had tied him up, something Dean himself hadn't even been able to do yet. His face contorted in anger. “Who the hell did this to you?!”
hurt Cas. “I thought you were on the - it’s probably not him - side?”
“He is strange, huh? Probably why we get along.” She joked and interlocked their arms. “You see how much cupcake fit in his mouth? That’s skill.”
The thought had his dick pulsing in Cas’ mouth and he suddenly wished the guy
Whether he sent Benny downstairs or not, Cas didn’t know, but he got about two sips of his dark liquid gold before
Castiel paced his apartment, wondering how the hell he was going to make this deadline. All he had to do was click submit on his reports and the damn Wifi cut out completely. After an hour on hold with the damn internet company, he hung up more annoyed than before.
“Jesus, Dean.” Cas pulled out and slammed back in, bottoming out. “Fuck!” He started fucking into Dean, feeling like he was in a damn dream. “Bite me, so I know I’m awake.”
“Castiel’s magnificent blowjob services, how may I help you?”
came from Dean's little show. “Oh fuck, so good. So fucking good.” Cole praised, “Gad, you have to try him next baby.”
“Oh.” Cas seemed as though he didn't know how to take that. “Well, everyone should have someone to talk to, but you
Dean growls a low satisfied laugh, his hand raking through Castiel’s messy onyx locks. “Really, really huh? Me too, Cas. I’ve never had to wait three dates before, but now I see the appeal. I want you so bad I’m fucking leaking.”
Jo smacked him again, “Don’t you dare!”
**********
Cas thought about that for a moment. “I think those are the necessities but we also need a pie.”
“No, I was looking for his key and found them. What are they Nick? Adderall
do since this shit show is finally over. Sam said no, but Gabriel got some anyway and I was just happy to get outside of the damn bunker so I was all for it.
“Sounds like a date.” Cas smiled and turned towards the tv.
“Alright, see you tonight.” Dean nodded, before making his way back by his friends and inhaling his lunch.
“Charlie! My drink!” His orange cup tumbled to the floor. “Assbutt!” When he finally looked over at Dean, he grinned. “Don’t think we’ve met before, I’m Castiel.” He held out his hand, basically devouring Dean’s body with his eyes.
Dean’s eyes widened with desire and he leaned in to mouth at Cas’ clothed crotch. He bit the waistband and pulled back as he reached down to palm himself.
Cas raised his eyebrows and took off his jacket - completely forgetting about his bruises - and walked over to plop down on the couch, giving Dean space to look around the room.
Cas didn’t have a chance to question how Gabe knew it was a boyfriend and not a girlfriend, but they always were the closest out of everyone.
Of course, he had no clue the things Dean had done, but something inside of him told him Dean had done some dark things and instead of it causing the urge to run, it made Castiel want
“Oh... you please me just fine, babe.” Dean winks at Cas, trying to get back into playful territory. Not that therapy should be playful but... isn’t improv supposed to be fun?
“My week was incredibly mundane.” But he knew she wanted more than that. “A student of mine came out this week. He came up to me and thanked me for helping him feel confident in his sexuality but I didn’t feel I deserved it.”
He needed to stop thinking about Dean and focus.
- if he was being honest - but it was still nice to experience.
Nick shook his head a little and tried to sound nonchalant, but the truth was that the last several days had killed him not being able to talk to his brother. “Nah, figured he’d have a better shot if I wasn’t up his ass, and I guess I was right.” Another silence. “Maybe I should though. He know you called me?”
He worked him open quickly, noting every sound and shift of Dean’s body and filed it away for the future. By the time he was sure he was ready, Cas was leaking down his own thigh and shaking with need. “Tell me you want me, Dean. Tell me you want me inside of you.”
The look in Dean’s eyes was completely unreadable, and Cas had a moment where he wasn’t sure if Dean would just call it a night. He looked down at his glass and twirled it around in his fingers, but when Dean finally spoke, Cas was taken aback. “My ex was… my dom.”
Cas eyed him suspiciously. “Are you trying to turn me on right now? Because it’s working.” Humor was always a safe escape from compliments. Cas didn’t know how to respond to those.
They all look at him like he's nuts, but Cas reaches out to take his hand. “Come on. I have… something of a special gift for you.”
Nick grabbed the cherry, “I’m the older brother, I pick the cherry.”
He slept better than he had in ages, but his dick was so hard when he opened his eyes that he groaned out loud. Cas was still plastered to him but had rolled over at some point in the night, meaning his ass was
“Mmm.” Dean hums, pulling back with a soft smile. “You’re the best Christmas gift in the world.”
It would've been awesome if Dean could've picked his jaw up off the floor long enough to say something clever back, but by the time he thought of something even close... Cas was gone.
, he was on him. Kissing him sloppily before sucking on his neck as he unbuttoned Cas’ jeans. Cas was sure there would be a hickey but he didn’t care, he was single.
(See the end of the chapter for
by putting as much distance between us and Sioux Falls as we can.” Dean slowly lifted Cas, frowning when he finally slid out. “Let’s get some sleep, we’ll take a look at my kill map in the morning and figure out a safe place to hide out for awhile.”
Cas didn’t want to hear about how fucking good Dean was right now, Michael was good. He always took care of Cas and this would be their first solo fuck. He pushed Dean from his mind and focused on Michael’s strong arms.
One more tonight... go on, click next. You earned it.
“Don’t change the subject.” Cas was smiling but he was anything but relaxed. His leg was shaking and his hand was tapping the arm of the couch as he eyed Dean.
“Too much sass in one tent man, shit might implode.” Dean teased as he finished up securing the tent.
Dean opened his eyes. “No, Cas. It makes you a guy that was shunned by his entire fucking family simply for likin’ dick. It’s actually kinda textbook that you get off on the idea of someone actually giving a damn about you.”
“Hell yeah, for as long as he’ll let me.” Dean walked into the kitchen with a beautiful grin, his eyes instantly glued to Cas.
With a gurgled
It gets a little messy before Cas finally pulls back. "It's not over, either. One more time jump and you'll be back in the kitchen, and then you'll spend the day with Sam and Mary."
Dean barely caught his footing, but when he did he lifted his palms in surrender. Something like hurt flashed across his face, which only served to piss Cas off even more. Dean swallowed. "C'mon, Cas. It's me, okay? I won't touch you if you don't want me to, you know that. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have grabbed you. I just don't want you walking around outside, okay? Can you just come back inside? I'll talk to Benny, this was just a misunderstanding, right?"
Dean slid his fingers deep, twisting them as he bent over to lick the broken skin on Cas’ back. He bit him again, hard enough to draw blood. He moved his hand, using his body weight to keep Cas pinned down as he reached below him and curled his fingers around Cas’ throbbing cock. “You want me to fuck you, angel? I want you to paint my pretty car white first.” Dean hit his prostate again and twisted his hand
Dean’s cock was hard and neglected, so he pulled his hand from Cas’ length and lifted his angel’s hips. “I want you to sink down on my cock, but don’t move. Do you understand?”
But the one thing that frustrated him is they could never get their hands on the guys.
The world feels imbalanced.
to go to waste.” He took another small sip.
“Will do pretty. You should know, your tab will need to be paid soon,
making love? He wouldn’t know, and also wasn’t sure it mattered.
Dean growled into it and bit Cas’ lip hard. “I’ve been ready. I’ll meet you there, okay?
gave up control. He would push back into them, tell them how inadequate they were so they would fuck him harder and
A while later, Dean’s panic subsided enough that concern for Cas set in. He reached over and took his hand. “Is your head gonna be okay?”
“I think our situation has put us past formal, shoot.” Cas grabbed the bottle and took a long slow sip, one eyebrow arched.
He must have taken too long.
The man smiles widely for the first time and it was that exact moment Cas knew he wanted to see that smile for the rest of his life. “Just a coffee. I’m Dean.” He holds out his big rough hand and Cas takes it in his, practically melting to the touch.
Though that doesn't sound right, Cas isn't going to complain. He steps away to finish getting ready, then kisses him again before they get in the car and head over to Charlie’s. “Is it rude of me that I'm excited to see Lisa’s face?”
Dean blinked in surprise. “That’s not a half bad idea, actually.” He gave directions to the church and told Cas to park in the hotel parking lot just down the street.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean bites back his grin and squirms in anticipation. “How many times did you imagine doin’ this? Before we ever did anything, I mean.”
Charlie checks her out and nods at Michael who instantly agrees but Dean is just confused. “Wait, why threesome. Cas hasn’t got someone.”
Dean watched with Rose at his side as Derek took his turn, and then Dean finally had another chance to win. He looked down at Rose, “Wish me luck, sweetheart.”
He made a loop around the room to search for cameras, but came up short.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t hear what was being said, but they looked his way with smiles on their faces.
“Dean... Dean... get on your fucking back!” Cas flipped them in seconds and straddled Dean’s lap. “Lube up your cock.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed as he watched Cas take him with a blissed out fucking look on his face. Dean wasn’t small, he could feel the way Cas’ throat tightened in an effort to push him out right before he forced the head of his cock to dip down past his tongue. It felt fucking amazing, but there was an emptiness in him from the lack of a struggle that had him pulling back to snap his hips so hard and fast it hurt
swallowed him down, Cas moaned, letting his head fall against the window.

“There is nothing special about me, Dean. I know how to draw, that’s it. That is the only thing worth a damn about me and even
As soon as Nick followed Castiel’s gaze he ran up behind him, “What are you doing? Let’s go!” He stopped a few feet behind, watching Cas’ every move.
Cas jerked up, looking around as if he had no idea where he was. “Oh shit, morning.” Cas ran a hand down his face. “I didn’t mean to crash on your couch.”
Dean huffed a laugh and stood, if he didn’t leave now, who knows what he would do with Castiel. “Anyways, sorry to interrupt your mind porn about some pretty cop. Take care Cas.” Dean called out as he walked towards the door, a sly smile upon his lips as he exited.
heard him last night, then. He nodded once, adjusting the strap of his bag that was digging into his shoulder. “Yeah, I do.”
Their mouths find each other again, and the kiss they share is the best Dean has ever had. It’s so unbelievably all-consuming, he loses himself in it, and he’d be happy if he was never found again.
“Don’t plan on it, Cas. I’m with you to the end of the line.”
He should have stopped… but he couldn’t. The second his brain took in Cas’ features, he came.
Dean could still feel his hesitation, “Have you taken any today?”
Cas spotted a man in a red flannel across the bar and couldn’t help but wonder what was in his jeans. He felt a thrill at the thought of

Cas licked his lips and turned to Charlie. “That was strange.”
“Nope. You?” Dean asked, not even bothering to ask Cas if he was gay — not that it was a secret. Dean wasn’t the first person to guess right about Cas.
“I can hear you too. Keep going, match my strokes, gorgeous.” He released a moan that had Dean embarrassingly already feeling close.
Dean pinched his tongue between his teeth as he leaned forward, driving himself further inside of Cas as he started carving. He made sure not to cut too deep, but he made a single horizontal line underneath Cas’ left peck and then started back at the top of it, curving out and bringing it down to the bottom.
Thank you all for loving this story the way that we did. I hope this finale was as satisfying for you as it was bittersweet for us, but we knew from the start that there was only one way this was going to end. But now, our boys can be together in murderous harmony for the rest of time itself, and what more could we possibly ask for?
dom Dean… one day.
“First time you’re gonna see my dick and it’s not even hard. Ugh, fine, but only because I’m impressed with how big-of-a load you just dragged outta me,” Dean laughed. “You deserve to see what you did to me.”
Alec looked between them both and stood, touching Cas’ shoulder. “Okay, just be careful Castiel.” He went back to work.
Dean shrugged even though no one could see him, “Don’t mention it. You’re right, he is unforgettable. I’m happy I was able to help and that he was even open to it.”
Castiel held out his hand, “Walk with me?”
Cas pulled down his pants and bent over as told, his lacey black panties on display for Dean.
Cas frowned. He actually liked apple pie all the same but he just didn’t want Nick to get it, before he can pull the

and embarrassed the hell out of himself, but he was relieved he caught that slip as he shut himself inside her bathroom to pee.
Dean came harder than he had in ages, emptying completely into Cas’ mouth with a loud moan that matched Cas’ as he swallowed, and this time... Dean could feel exactly when he came, too. It sent a shudder right down Dean’s spine and he finally released Cas’ hair, going limp against the bed. “Jesus, that was hot.”
