safe, when he could really believe that at least the worst was behind him - moments when he was very aware of how much better that was…
And being excited that someone liked him was too much for him to ever hope for – far,
“You look tired,” he observed gently, noting the heavy slump of Tony’s shoulders and the shadows under his eyes. Tony gave an indignant smirk.
Their first appointment was scheduled for a few nights later, on what turned out to be a pretty dismal Monday evening. By the time Steve and Bucky arrived the rain was running down the lab windows in sheets, and the room was filled with a vaguely comforting drumming sound.
“Hm? Oh… I just… Wonder how long they’re going to keep us waiting,” he shrugged, barely listening to his own answer. Actually, he had no idea how long they had been waiting. It just sounded like a reasonable response.
If it would’ve kept Steve talking about this.
Because, whatever this was, in the moment it was just… Nice.

And then he let his head fall forward, and looked at Steve, and-
he wanted – all he’d ever wanted. That he already understood it, and felt it, and needed it.
“Uh, about eighteen months?”
Smiling, he knelt down beside the box and very delicately pulled it free-
He was vaguely aware of how unnaturally the body behind it collapsed in on itself.
“Tony, I know,” Steve told him, firmly. “Really, I was never worried about that…”
And he thought back to his emotional enlightenment a few moments ago, how
Suddenly Tony was thrusting into him in a deep, brutal rhythm, his hands pinning Steve under him, his breathing growling roughly from the bottom of his chest.
“Here, you might as well finish this” Tony told him – loud enough for Maribelle to hear it – as he handed Steve his glass. “I’m going to get us something different.”
Before he was swiftly distracted by the huge bouquet of roses that the concierge was holding.
Tony felt it like a kick in the gut.
“Good morning, Sir,” JARVIS announced in a cheerful voice. “You requested that I remind you in time for the next team update.”
It wasn’t exactly encouraging, was it?
But… it was a different need this time…

But he remembered some of it.
He grabbed Tony by the waist, pulling Tony against him, burying himself deep inside him
“Maybe I will,” Bucky teased.
“What?” He asked, eventually. And Vanessa sighed.
But Tony couldn’t help
At first, he didn’t think anything of the fact that he could hear Bucky’s voice. It was simply something that was familiar, and far away - like everything else. By the time it occurred to him to look up, Bucky was already striding purposefully towards him, Sam trailing behind, trying in vain to get Bucky’s attention…

“But, for what it’s worth, I really
A feeling like all of this was
“Oh, Tony,” Steve moaned, his voice low and pleading, his hips rolling up to meet Tony’s grip-
Steve jerked his head up, aware only of the sudden loss of him-
Something about having screwed it up and needed to cover his tracks and wanting so desperately to pursue it-
He stroked a hand over the inside of Tony’s thigh, parting his legs, delighting in how easily Tony responded to him. He felt Tony’s breath catch… heard it echo in the air around them, as a hush fell over the garden like a heavy blanket. Steve could feel that anticipation everywhere.
“Tony-”

“Oh, yeah,” Tony nodded, “and you kept asking her why she didn’t do that before…. Which is a good question, actually…”
“We promise” Tony assured, softly “As long as this thing works, he’s out of here.”
Tony actually let go of a wistful little sigh, as his thoughts drifted away from Dimitri and Ottilie and onto thoughts of Steve, as they always did-
If Tony was ‘going with it’, then it was very easy to go with this one - truthfully, he wanted to be able to daydream about it, without all the collateral noise…
“At this stage, no.” He conceded “
incredible, you always look beautiful,” Tony replied, entirely seriously, dropping his head to nip at Steve’s earlobe… and then kiss that sensitive spot at the back of his ear, very softly… Steve shivered, tugging at Tony’s hair as he began to work his way down the column of Steve’s throat-
Ordinarily, that was the sort of thing that might vaguely annoy Steve. He’d always been slightly defensive about people taking it upon themselves to help him, especially if they managed to do it without him knowing. There always seemed to be something presumptive in things like that, something that nagged at a particular vulnerability. However grateful he told himself to be, however well-intentioned the other person was, there was always a part of Steve that felt caught out, or trapped, or something. The effects of his perilous childhood, or a by-product of his natural stubbornness, probably.
And then Tony pulled his teeth free in one swift, clean motion.
But, little by little, there were more moments when he could feel the relief and security of being

“It’s okay baby, I know you are, it’s alright, I’m sorry too, I’m sorry…”
“Like I’d really like to know what you’re feeling,” Steve admitted eventually.
Because it wasn’t that he could see things that weren’t there… he didn’t think it was that, anyway.
He would have liked to carry on with this discussion.
…This
3:43am. Still no update.
“Hi,” Steve beamed, full of hope and excitement, and maybe just a few nerves of his own. The burst of affection Tony felt for him was strong enough to push all of his concerns aside, at least for the moment.
...After all the confusion and compromise of the last half an hour, Steve felt like he had finally reached a solution that he had absolutely no problem with.
But his head was swimming from the cocktail of drugs he was on, and his whole being was still reeling from Steve’s outburst, and-

“You don’t think there’s a chance someone is going to recognise us?” Tony snarked, jumping right to the point.
They wouldn’t pay any attention to the security pleb they were barking at. They wouldn’t even notice if one of them was on an unscheduled break, or having a nap. Steve knew, as soon as their jet landed at a secure SHIELD facility, they would let their guard down. They’d allow a minimum wage, barely reference-checked employee to wait, all alone, with such important cargo, because they felt like they were home-

A dip in his stomach, like you feel at the crest of a rollercoaster, as he felt Tony take the weight of the case.

“Actually, I was going to start with the blood work,” Tony answered, looking between Steve and Bucky as he spoke. “You probably aren’t going to feel like doing that after the spinal tap. C’mon.” And he stood up in a fluid motion, and nodded toward the elevator again, “There is a med lab on the next floor up. If we’re drawing blood we should go somewhere cleaner than this.”
Which shocked Tony’s mind quiet for a second.
When he saw Steve like this, Tony could only feel a soft swell of affection and a deep sense of comfort, however hard he tried to force a more appropriate reaction. And even though he knew that there were other things he should be thinking about, that he should obviously be

“But would it change your mind about anything?” Tony went on, fluidly “To find that the people of Anni Vara
“Oh, I’m in no rush,” Bucky assured them, brightly. “And, hey, I want to know if we’re getting
And Tony knew, normally, this would be the moment he leapt in there. It just felt like that point in the conversation where he’d raise his voice slightly, or start to speak more quickly… He couldn’t say how he knew that, exactly. He could just so easily imagine himself on the defensive right now. Trying to make the case for his idea even before he was sure of it, because he wanted to convince Steve….sounded very silly now, but still.

“Has anyone asked you to… do anything, since we got here?” He mused, turning to Rhodey.

There was the oddest drop of disappointment as he realised - Tony wasn’t angry over the secret. He couldn’t be. It hadn’t happened to him.

“I said-”
Like his thoughts were separating from one another, sliding over the top of one another like oil on water.
And then he felt Tony rock into him, slow and deep, and then again, and again… And Steve just let his eyes fall shut again, let his whole body fall open to this, simply letting Tony fuck into him, over and over… He’d lost all sense of time, or perspective. He’d stopped thinking in actual words. He just relaxed into this easy, endless pleasure, this wonderful feeling of simple, aimless bliss.

And then let it fall into Steve, throwing his arms around him, burying his face into Steve’s neck.

He forced himself to look up, trying to blink – struggling to breathe over the physical panic overwhelming him.
“You don’t have a dishwasher?” Steve observed, mindlessly.
He thought of Tony being lost and lonely.
“I love you,” he said, as though it were the answer to everything.
I wanted to like me…”
Steve saw Stape swallow hard, and pinch his lips, the

Then maybe they’d respect him, and us. She thinks the humans are going to mean the difference between us all going to prison, and us running the world.”

Three days later, and Tony was off somewhere getting ready for his undercover mission.
Lying on his side a few inches from Steve, sleeping soundly, his face completely relaxed and perfectly still-

Unthinkingly, Tony took a sip of his drink – and then pulled a sour face at it, and set it aside. Somehow, it was both fierce and flavourless in his mouth, a bitter heat that pooled unpleasantly under his tongue…

Because Tony was irresponsible - said the man who’d threatened to taser a terminally ill person with a serious heart condition.
Which was probably the wrong answer. Tony knew he should probably push ahead with the project, try to avoid any lulls that could lead to actual thought or personal conversation-
Tony ran the washcloth over Steve’s back without really thinking about it… simply enjoying the way Steve sighed. Liking the idea of Steve being comfortable, and happy – just that. Tony gently caressed the cloth over Steve’s shoulders, down along his spine, washing away the flecks of congealed blood that were the only evidence of how desperately Tony had clawed at him, thanks to the healing potential of the serum. He worked his way down to Steve’s hips, over another collection of scratches, over his ass and between his legs… It felt intimate, and caring, and romantic even. But entirely without agenda. The kisses they shared were soft, and unhurried, and tasted of fresh water. The way Steve held him was permanent and solid and

“Well, I guess that’s the gamble I’m taking, pushing this idea on you,” Rhodey conceded. “But I gotta tell you, I think the odds are in my favour here.”
He felt Tony elbow his ribs softly, and took the glass from his lips to look.
Steve’s chest seized as he opened the text, every muscle tensing in general preparation - and then he read the message.
Steve looked up at him, his eyes glinting under the light, a soft smile on his lips.
“I love you too,” Tony answered - swooning at how nice it felt.
. Someone that
“...Probably,” Steve laughed, softly.
And he couldn’t quite seem to talk himself out of it. It was almost like his mood was entirely disconnected from him, like this physical discomfort and emotional misery had arrived independent of anything he’d been thinking at the time. He just felt heavier, and more irritable, and more hard-done-by, as the day wore on. And no amount of thinking would loosen it, because he hadn’t thought his way into it in the first place. He tried giving himself a stern talking to, reminding himself why he wasn’t hard done by… but it just didn’t touch the sides. If anything, it added genuine guilt and regret to the cocktail of displaced emotions.
And then his ribs started to ache, and he had to think about this breathing, and the laugher began to ease off – out of physical necessity, at first…
In the months after that, Steve had learned that the Legend of Captain America had been a big part of Tony’s childhood - that Howard had made an ‘issue’ of it. But, until this very moment, Steve had never really thought about it. He’d just blindly accepted that it somehow explained Tony’s animosity towards him at the beginning and made a mental note not to mention Howard much… and that was that. He’d never had reason to ask himself what that issue really was, or where it came from, or what it meant. Especially after Tony seemed to get over it so quickly...
Something in Tony’s voice reached Steve.
Tony stood at the end of that opulent, king sized bed, and watched as Steve stretched out on the soft, clean sheets, and he knew-
that that.

Steve knew Tony was awake by six that morning.

“There
whether he’d smiled, or swallowed, or licked his lips-
He didn’t know how to –
“It’s not that it’s hard to be around you,” he promised,
“Guards.”
Tony’s breath hitched, as Steve’s hands reached his waist and worked their way under his shirt. The thrill of his touch on Tony’s bare skin was so intense it almost burned, like all of Tony’s blood was rushing to meet Steve’s palms. His cock throbbed petulantly, tugging a low ache from low in his groin - but the urge to lift his arms was greater. The impulse to help Steve undress him, to feel Steve’s body pressed against him, drove Tony to lift his shoulders rather than his hips… That compulsive ache coiling the whole time, like a panicked reminder to hurry.
“You know, there is only one dream that is really worth having.” The man carried on, in the same wise, unhurried tone. “To be happy every day for the rest of your life.” And he looked at each of them in turn, with the same benevolent smile. “And you seem so happy, at the moment – and yet your instinct is to stop?”
Steve felt his heart skip, his breath coming to a burning halt in his lungs. A sudden thickness in his throat, a pounding in his ears.
Steve had just realised that he was
When Rocket gave Steve the short-hand version of Quill’s family tree, it had unsettled him just a little. The concept of a being that was also a planet who was also a God was far outside Steve’s frame of reference, even as they were trying to build a time machine… But that was okay, because it just

that it was as lovely as Steve had ever looked – although the sight of Steve spread open and naked on his bed, flushed and sweaty and still making pleading little noises as he gulped for air, was certainly part of the overall effect…
And Tony realised that, more than anything he’d wanted from Steve – and, okay, there were a lot of things he’d wanted from Steve, over the years… But more than anything, he’d just wanted this. A moment that wasn’t ‘about’ anything, that wasn’t compromised by, or effected by, or intended to rectify, any of their issues. A moment that he didn’t have to make the most of, or put into context, or try not to get carried away with. A moment when Steve would just hold him, and kiss him, because Tony was his and because he wanted to and because they
Steve smiled.
To claim him, to-
“Well, I was,” Tony answered honestly. “But then I nearly set the house on fire again, so I’m taking a break.”
Sam and Bucky shared a knowing glance, which Steve resolved to ignore.
And, as he took Tony’s hand and led them both from this room, him half dressed and Tony still giggling and both of them just a little unsteady on their feet, Steve began to appreciate what it was not to care.

And grabbed his hand.
There was a niceness to it…
“Well, I did warn you this might lead to more drugs in the air” He joked, gesturing the makeshift Bunsen burner that was now cooling on the edge of his mat. And Steve just breathed a little laugh, because he knew it wasn’t that. “Although, actually, if there are any excess drugs in the air right now, they should just mean you
“Yeah, you’re right. That’s better.”
...Finding that his resolve faded, as soon as he laid eyes on them.
And yet, for all that - and far scarier than all of that - there was the horrible feeling that he already knew exactly what this meant…
“Someone does,” Bucky said again, just as coldly. Stape stuttered to a stop, his eyes flashing with a helpless sort of alarm.
“I meant everything I said, Steve,” he assured. “It’s just the other stuff. The things that make the stuff I did say… more complicated, in real life…”

“Not really,” she admitted, “But I still have to go, so. All the latest reports have been uploaded to your server… Do you have anything you want to ask about?”

But… well, maybe one day.
Steve had nothing to do with any of this, by the way.
Steve glanced over his shoulder to see Tony strolling away from the villa, a glass in each hand. Steve’s contented smile broke into a broad grin, as he ran his eyes over Tony’s body…
He thought about having Steve in his bed, not worried about what he might find there, not thinking he didn’t belong. Steve, naked and relaxed and
Oddly...floaty…

Tony threw the weapons down and pushed the two front guards aside, a flat palm to the centre of each of their chests, brushing them up against the wall as though they were cardboard standees.
“What if it turns out that Zan’s Dad was doing research to end a horrible plague” Tony carried on in the same philosophical tone. “And it
“But did you hear the crowd though?” Nat enthused. And Tony nodded in agreement, because she had a point on that one - even though he didn’t understand the rules of this competition, and he had no idea what marked a good performance out from a bad one, it was certainly true that the crowd had gone nuts for Bruce. Which only made Tony smile more…
He just couldn’t manage it in time.
And then Tony looked at Steve, just as Steve turned away from the frame… and looked right at him. Tony

“Yeah,” Steve gulped, even though he was a few minutes short of being back to normal.
And then Rogers spoke.
And then Steve nudged the door open,
“So good for me…”
“Look, I know I don’t have any right to have this conversation,” Steve went on, more cautiously. “I just… realised I never had the right to take this conversation away from you, I guess. That it should’ve been your choice… So, if you just don’t want to hear this, that’s fine – I know this is the most inconvenient, awkward way I could have done this, but I
And, with that, he was thinking about all the things Tony had said to him last night.
He’d forgotten anything would happen next – there was only
“Thank you,” Steve whispered again, subconsciously gathering the robe against his chest. When he glanced up, he saw Tony beaming with a selfless joy at how much Steve liked his gift - and he loved him for it.
enough to be worthy of it.
He took once last glance at the computer – at that post-it in particular… and then he left, gently closing the door behind him.
“He likes you too,” Bucky sighed, before Steve could get out of the car.
He couldn’t call it ‘hope’.

That was the first time he’d ever actually
And then Tony appeared at the top of the stairs, like a burst of light.
“And I should expect nothing less,” Tony answered theatrically, reaching out to take Steve’s empty bowl. And then he turned to throw both of them into the sink with the pans.

“Thanks for that,” Tony muttered, mindlessly. Rhodey just smiled.

And then Bucky looks back at the chamber behind him, and he wonders… Not with any real urgency, but still, he asks-

been entertaining ideas of lying Steve out like this and doting on him completely – an idea that flared again for a moment, as he watched Steve writhe gently against the bed. He knew that it must’ve been so long since Steve got to be somewhere safe and clean and comfortable, that he must be so weary and achy and bruised. There was still a lot of appeal in the thought of wrapping Steve in blankets, carefully soothing every inch of him…
Tony…
...He needed a better look.
“Good night.” Steve repeated, as he retreated into the bedroom.
words to say that he felt something too…
Without any further prompting, Steve sat up enough to pull his own shirt over his head and toss it aside. And then, before Tony could grab for him, his hands were unfastening Tony’s belt, his fingers curling over Tony’s waistband.
Which was easy, today.
There was too much light, for one thing. Every available surface seemed to be glowing with illuminated images and colourful displays… Everything is a soft neon pallet of rose pink and sky blue and bright, brilliant white. As his eyes adjusted, Tony was able to pick out the holograms shimmering in the air… far more advanced than anything he’d ever seen before...
They heard a little
“Not nearly as strong as Eden” She soothed, handing a glass to Steve first-
“You can remember pi to, what was it, 100 digits?” Steve snorted.
And then Steve dropped his head and took the head of Tony’s cock in his mouth, sucking softly. He felt Tony tense, a tiny, pleading whine escaping him as Steve took the length of him very slowly, right to the back of his throat. And then Tony’s voice broke into a low,
...But obviously, that was a terrible thought.
“The world has been so unkind to you,” Tony sighed.
And, already, Steve knew something was wrong. He could hear it, in those two little syllables – something was different, or…
“Why, what did he want?” He demanded.
He felt uncomfortable about it, regretful even – but not
much about making Steve happy…
“The place is rigged to gas intruders – it has to be someone who doesn’t have to breathe,” Tony replied.
And the worst part of it all was that few minutes in the middle. That strange time when they both absolutely

“Are you going to make us forget we were ever here?” Tony outright asked, his voice pulled tight, his eyes fixed ahead of him.
All of it would only define and celebrate the thing they were starting right
Tony’s own response was somewhat harder to quantify. He suspected that the attraction itself

This was what Tony was meant to do-

they would, because he’d studied this moment so carefully. Across multiple timelines. He’d watched the security footage of his own recovery before he left 2023, and read every report that anyone had ever written about it. He’d even used one of his remaining Pym Particles to watch the whole thing play out, before he finally came to settle in 2011.
So he waited, hidden away at the bottom of those ominous alien mountains, far away from Natashas final moments. He stayed there until long after that sinister boom had rocked the sky.
- that you thought you saw someone breaking into the tower?”
Tony was overwhelmed with such sadness for Steve, such pain to think what he’d been through – in that moment he’d have promised Steve anything. He’d have told him Bucky could move into the compound, if it would’ve helped.
as that trembling was threatening to break through Steve’s control, Tony sat up and pulled Steve hard against his chest, so that he could whisper close,
Steve kept having to stop himself in the middle of wistful daydreams to remind himself that they weren’t wistful anymore. He had to pause and check his own logic, whenever an imagined potential future seemed too good to be true. He was still having to convince himself that his own memories were real-

nothing beyond being good for Tony. Right now, that was all Steve wanted, all he was meant for, the only purpose that existed…
Because Steve was- because they were-
“I was waiting for him,” he answered, honestly – already stalking into the building.
…He wasn’t sure about the anxiety, though.
When he finally sat up, rubbing his face and blinking against the light, his sluggishness was entirely genuine. It took a few seconds for his head to clear, his vision coming back into focus…
Some terrible joke about the crappy flip phone that Steve had left for him, and a reassurance that the phone

“Bucky-”
He has no idea what any of those details are, and he doesn’t think to look for them - but he is aware that they must exist.
“Oh, God, Tony…” Steve gasped, trying to rock back against him now.
And Tony didn’t have to think about Wesley right now - he wasn’t here anymore.

And that was...Okay.
Something about… looking for something, or running from something… He couldn’t remember. And then JARVIS, talking to him-
That voice again.
Tony shot it a sceptical look. It struck him as immediately eerie, that it should ring just then.
And then there was a second of total silence… And then his ears started ringing…

. The fact that he had Tony pressed up against a wall in exactly the same way as any other couple in this place, the way thousands of couples got to share intimate, exciting, romantic moments every single day –
“But it’s not something we can just blow up.”
“Why, what’s the best part?” Tony beamed, as Steve screwed his face up in preparation.

“Shhh,” Tony smiled kindly, tugging Steve’s hand,

someone’s blood, it’s always a mixture of everything… and I never know that person – and it’s not like I’m ever going to pass anyone in the street, so who knows if… y’know, I’d know, or they’d know…”
Tony loved the thought of Steve being that desperate for him – but not as much as the thought of giving him everything he wanted.
But the thought that, if he’d just kissed Tony weeks ago, Tony might’ve kissed him back-
just tell me, Steve.”
“Hey,” Tony said again – and this time Steve was just about able to raise his head, to find that Tony was standing right there next to his side of the bed. Steve began some pointless attempt to shuffle over, to give Tony more room-
have shown more restraint than that…
And then Steve had just stopped bothering with them.

“Oh, like noticing all the details in the different flowers?” Steve suggested, in a burst of enlightenment.
“It was a stupid plan to stop an imaginary threat, and the whole thing was very unfair to Tony,” he continued, recognising the strange lightness that had bubbled up in his voice. “And when I look back, it's really obvious that we should have just told him, and that he probably would have fixed things better than we did, and I think were were all really stupid about the whole thing from start to finish,” he finished by throwing Scott a smug smile,
“Oh, hi,” Tony breathed, breaking into a grin, his entire body relaxing as though he’d just been hit by a blow dart. Just the sound of Steve’s voice, just those two little words, was like a balm. It knocked all of the guilt and anxiety out of Tony in a single bold swing, dragging him into this moment and leaving everything else behind… “How are you?”
Tony didn’t know what to say.
And then, without warning, Tony just broke. His climax seemed to surge from every part of his body, every muscle tightening and then shivering with release as he came hard across the front of Steve’s uniform.
“Er, right, thanks” Tony muttered – because this was, in fact, the third time she’d mentioned drugs “I’d tip you, but…”
“You know, I’m pretty sure that works by making your own cells hydrate themselves better…” Tony mused, putting the vial into a little rack and taking out another. “And if that’s true, then the medical research potential of that would be worth…well, billions, if you think of where you could go from there…” And Steve could see him, thinking of all the different avenues he could explore from that one finding…all the different diseases and injuries it might heal… all the people he could help… all just snapping through his mind, a chain of sparks, while he carried on a casual conversation about something else…. “I’m just saying, they’ve dismissed a lot of things here that could’ve made them rich without much more effort.” He finished with a shrug.
experiment, at least. But nowhere in any of the files was there any reference to an overall project. Which, okay, might’ve meant that Zan was just making that up… But Tony didn’t think so.
Steve felt anxious.
“Bucky?” He heard himself ask.

And Steve paused mid-step, just so that he could get the pose right, waiting for Rhodey to look at him before he leant forward and said,

To find two out-of-shape security guards, both fixing him with the same unimpressed expression, and Sam standing awkwardly between them.
He should probably have left a few more minutes in between jolting awake in that armchair and bolting for the door - or, seeing as that idea was still unbearable, he could at least have paused for a few moments during his power walk along the beach, just to clear his head.
He was glad of the excuse to watch Tony smile…
“Where have you been?” Pepper demanded - in much the same tone, but at least she was entitled to it.

“Hey,” Steve replied, on auto pilot. “How’re you feeling?”
Steve’s blood flared up to the surface of his skin as he let that sentence run through his head again… For some reason, it struck him as the most intimate thing that he’d ever heard Tony say.
...And that’s
That he’d have liked to talk to him about so many things, over the years… That he’d have been interested, that he’d have enjoyed the company…
“And they did all of this to you, and there was a whole timeline where I knew that and I never said a thing about it,” he sighed. “A whole timeline where I just… Wasn’t thinking about it, and that was that… But, you know, if you’re crazy for thinking that SHIELD might be watching you, then we both are. And honestly, I don’t think it is us - I think the people breaking into houses and bugging people are the crazy ones, personally.”
That need to plan for every eventuality, risk assess every situation - leave as many options open as he could…
And Steve felt an immediate and organic instinct to open himself to Tony completely, to let Tony see every part of him, to answer any question Tony put to him honestly and without hesitation.
? Why were you going to apologise for that?”
.” Tony finished. “Also, if we get time today,
Along with a high pitched warning, sounding over and over again like a siren -
“Did you have anything particular in mind, Sir?” JARVIS enquired, like he understood.
Steve didn’t even remember bolting for the front door. He only knew that he appeared to be standing right there when Tony knocked.
Steve just lent into it, letting that wordless sense of security engulf him, until it felt as though he was floating through it…
He knew, if he pushed it, Tony would try to dismiss the gesture - he would, as ever, remind Steve that he could afford these things, as though the expense was the only overwhelming thing about it…
And Steve smiled, that same poignant sadness in his eyes, and placed his hand over Tony’s.
Because in that moment, Tony really
Someone the already knew.
, somehow. As though there were some greater significance to what Steve had just said, some second meaning, something Tony had to
He still had to deal with this overwhelming love for a man he couldn’t possibly keep.
“No, stop, I’m going to die,” Tony panted helplessly, laughing without sound now, one hand pressed tenderly to his rib.
“I’m sorry?”
“Yeah, you could say that…”
The desperate, pleading sound Tony was making-
, if you didn’t like what I thought.”
So unsubtly, in fact, that the woman saw her do it, and looked up expectantly.
Could he really let that go?
it began to burn itself out, petering off into a low inconsistent snickering. By then, Steve’s sides ached, his throat was sore, and his whole body felt weak-
Tony’s heart gave a confused clench.
“And?” Tony asked. Steve hesitated, a questioning frown creasing his brow. “What did you find out, when you looked it up?” Tony clarified. Steve’s shoulders slumped again.
“That’s fair,” he accepted.
“No, I’m okay,” he managed, over gasps and swallows.
Tony flipped the page over, hoping to find some additional clues - but, again, there was nothing. So far, only the somewhat kinky sketch had any readable notes. Tony couldn’t even tell what date most of the pages were from, although if the state of decay was any indicator, it was quite a wide time frame…

“You wear this?” Steve inquired, looking up at Tony.

, Tony could have simply been star-struck, and not even felt bad about it.
Of course, he knew it should be the mission - at the very least, he should probably figure out exactly what the mission was-
And then Bucky dropped his head, and buried his face against Steve’s neck-
… It feels like permission not to think about those horrible memories for a moment. He likes that.
“No,” she reassured him, daring to take a little step closer. “No, the allies won, largely thanks to you-”
And then that low, dragging pleasure, as Tony began to suck the blood from his throat.
It helped that he’d finally had the chance to talk to someone about Bucky. A chance to revive those memories and reconnect with those feelings. A conversation about Bucky in the future tense, that brought the idea of him out of Steve’s own head and put it into the universe…
Tony Stark was alive, and real, and lying on Steve’s couch right now…
So, I hope this doesn't come over as flippant or frivolous, but I know this *is* a sensitive or uncomfortable topic for some people, so, fair warning - this chapter does include *some* discussion of The Accords. It's really not all that political, but, If you'd prefer to know gets talked about before you read, please see the end notes. If you prefer not to engage with any of the political stuff in any way, all you really need to know is that Steve and Tony talk while waiting for their next mark - and then skip to the chapter break to go straight to the plot.
The way he’d gasped for air…
And then he heard the gently click of the front door unlocking, his breath catching in his chest as he reached up to push it open-
He could see the guy trying to blink himself awake, his face already contorted in pain, his body trying to curl away from the visible dent in his shoulder.
A second too late, Tony realised how ridiculous his contribution was. That
And again-
to tell Tony he was sorry…
Because Tony had always thought that, accepting you may one day have to bend the rules didn’t mean you couldn’t want the rules to exist. Just because he’d wanted it stated, in advance, what the punishments would be, didn’t mean he’d never be prepared to risk them. And he still thought The Accords were the best of the available options, flawed though they may be. He still though the best way was to work on them, and start creating a fair set of rules for everyone. And, yes, he still thought – on this occasion – the safest hands were still their own. None of
that…
… And Tony’s heart clenched hard in his chest.
And – casual as you like – she walked them both right into an orgy.
“Okay,” Tony smiled, his eyes still fixed on Steve’s mouth. “But, just so you know, I’m
…But it
He couldn’t believe Tony didn’t
A hundred frantic observations shouted for attention in his head-
Steve smiled, in spite of himself – but only briefly. That’s how it worked, these days. Even the things about Tony that made him smile made him sad. He thought back to that short period in his life, when he might’ve been able to tease Tony for that. When Tony would’ve teased him back, for being awkward and embarrassed and flustered – but without malice. With a certain sort of affection, sometimes… those few warm moments that had filled him with so much hope –
Steve still didn’t know whether Tony had been joking when he referred to the villa as a ‘nice little place by the beach’. For a start, it certainly wasn’t little. Each of the four bedrooms was bigger than Steve’s old apartment, and it was set in at least an acre of perfectly manicured gardens. Open plan and clean and minimally decorated, to Steve it seemed like an absolute abundance of
Suddenly he realised… he’d been avoiding the whole issue of being attracted to Tony. He hadn’t even known he was doing it – but in all the many, rambling conversations they’d had about Tony, Steve had never once mentioned how pretty Tony was. He’d never shared any of
How immediately he’d known the answer.
“So, for a start… I’m basically certain that we have no idea when Loki is coming, or even
And it occurred to him, that one issue would be enough to fill a hundred evenings of anxious self-analysis. He could talk to Rhodey for hours, just about the fact that he was foolish enough to fall in love. That was without everything else-
If there was any anxiety or animosity in Steve’s tone right now… well, there was a time when Tony would simply have assumed that it was aimed at him.
“Oh, Jesus Tony, I love you, I love you,” Steve gasped in between ragged breaths, even as he was still trembling through the aftershocks.
But then Steve smiled at him.
And he’d thought of so many things it might really be about.
Anyway, enjoy!
Something vast and different and more than human, something that Steve didn’t have the words for yet… But he knew this feeling. He recognised it. He
…But Tony wasn’t dead.
“So, why haven’t you?” Tony went on in that same interested tone, taking another little step forward.
“I don’t think there is another door – but that might be better,” Steve added, already trying to plan the route in his head. “Means the staff are less likely to be heading that way.”
“What is all this, anyway?”

before he was pulling Tony in to kiss him.
“What the hell do you know about my family?” Clint demanded, all pretences dropped. Steve made sure to soften his expression, and answer kindly,

“You are so good, Steve,” Tony purred, like a lullaby, stroking his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You are perfect. Beautiful, and kind, and strong. And you deserve to be happy.”
“Thanks,” he smiled, “But I think I want my own bed. For, maybe, ten hours…” Oh, it was hard to sit up, to even
God, there weren’t even any pictures of him-
The way Steve looked at him, when it happened-
He’d watched himself wake up a thousand times, from every angle, in two different timelines - but never once had he spotted a reference to Nat being there. In fairness, Steve hadn’t been looking for her. He’d never considered that she might have been there, because he didn’t already know that she was. It had never occurred to him that she might’ve been…
It was hard enough to even listen to what Belle was saying. Analysing any of it could fuck right off.
. Tony knew it was terrible to hope that Rhodey had a point, to hope that his life could be a little bit better – he knew it would hurt all the more when it was crushed. And he knew it would be even worse, if he admitted that hope now. If he actually told Rhodey that he was, for a moment, considering whether he maybe had a point… it would mean
So, expecting a token gift from the conference organisers, or one of the sponsors - or, if it was an especially nice surprise, something from Rhodey or Pepper - Tony stood up and called, casually,
A little giggle bubbled over Bucky’s lips… and carried on going
that something more could happen between them, on nights like that, if nights like that existed…
Steve was forced to stop then. He was overwhelmed by such a powerful affection for him that it made his legs feel weak.
Many things about Steve’s relationship with Tony were still unnerving and uncomfortable; the ominous prospect of
He wanted to make it better.
“I can’t think now what we thought they were doing. We knew things that the people didn’t, obviously – all these reports that I think I just assumed was all Hydra, I don’t know. We knew what Hitler’s politics were, we thought… I think… I don’t know, anymore. I just know we weren’t expecting
And Tony just raised his eyebrows, expectantly.
“Yeah, probably, I’m already ten minutes late,” Steve sighed, shuffling aside to let Tony walk by him.
Oh, but Steve didn’t need an apology for that, especially not instead of being able to crawl back into that bed with Tony – he’d

little side project to feel anxious and confused over, too - but for the moment, he couldn’t concentrate enough to remember the thread of it. Only that he had all these theories and hastily considered experiments rolling around his head, and a whole raft of documents on their way from Fury, and a lot of work to do in figuring out why any of it mattered...
Well, obviously. Should have seen that one coming.
“I mean… We never actually talked about
Without that practiced mantra of self control and self sacrifice, there was nothing standing between Steve and his darker thoughts. Nothing to pull him back from being furious over every injustice he’d ever suffered through. All at once, he was so angry at so many people, angry at hundreds of thousands of people that he’d never even known, angry at the whole damn world.
He felt the dull thud of the floor hitting his knees, the distant echo of Tony calling his name.
He knew that sadness would never go away. No matter how great a world he built here, no matter how happy he was with his choices, no matter how much better he could do by another, equally valid Bucky, still, there would always be those questions in there somewhere.
It took Steve a second to realise that Tony had shifted to a new point entirely.
Wakanda… But even then, it would be such a huge risk to have these deadly, dangerous people out there just waiting to be triggered into doing something terrible. And I have no idea what awful things might have happened if Zemo hadn’t killed them the first time around…”
And there was Tony.
“I don’t know it’s just…” Steve started, and then paused to frown at Tony,

, and be there every day…
“Still no comment,” Steve sighed, pulling a carton of yesterday’s Chinese takeout from the back of the fridge.
Knowing that he, Steve Rogers, never wanted to discount anyone’s pain, that
And then there was a long, eerily empty silence… and Steve began to wonder if, when he raised his head, Tony would have disappeared completely.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony muttered, a prickle of resistance running up the back of his neck. Another remembered behaviour, probably. His ‘usual’ response to Rhodey’s endless attempts to help him.
And, yeah, he’d just wanted to say that too-
He’d just spent so long being
with this before he let Steve in, and everything just seemed right again. Because he knew that Steve had an extraordinary – for all Tony knew,
“And you should tidy this place up,”
Tony froze under the intensity of Steve’s gaze. That one second stretched out between them, the rest of the world fading out of existence as Tony surrendered to his most basic instincts. His ribs seized, his throat tightened – if he didn’t know better, he’d swear he could feel his heart racing.
“I promise you; it really wasn’t like that. It

So, still somewhat uneasy, Steve asked,
softness of him and the impossible solidness of him and the thrill of the conflict between the two. Tony ran his palms over the smooth expanses of Steve’s chest, he pressed his fingertips into the dense flesh of his shoulders and back, he caressed his hands over Steve’s stomach and hips. And Steve writhed against him, and arched up into him, his heavy panting breaking down into sighs and whimpers and whispered
By the time he’d drifted into sleep, he was somewhere between wishing they’d never come to this place and wishing he’d never been born. His deepest regrets and most painful memories melted into his dreams, until he was trapped in a world built of his own anxiety. The images of Germany and Siberia, The Tower and The Compound, all blended together. The angry words they’d shouted at each other echoing in the background, out of context, or over the wrong scenes.

point,” Steve carried on with a weary sigh. “I know we’re going to have to deal with them… And, honestly…” And he took one final glance at that kind look in Tony’s eyes, gearing himself up for this next little step. “And I know this is going to sound bad, however I say it…”
, it was that there was no point in defending himself on a point of principle.
“You didn’t,” the man assures, confidently. Like a doctor explaining a routine procedure - acknowledging Bucky’s fear without allowing it any credence.

Oh, and then a little spark of hope crept up on him… because he was suddenly pretty sure Steve

What he would really have liked to say was,

“You just aren’t sure about all this, huh.” Tony smiled, deliberately keeping his voice friendly. And Steve winced a little smile back at him – like he’d been caught out. Clearly, one night of kinky sex and drug fucked conversation hadn’t completely cured that deep-rooted anxiety of his…
Because, if he didn’t, he just

And, now that he was clean, and comfortable, he could let his mind drift to the idea of curling up in his own bed, and letting his eyes just fall shut…
,” Steve corrected. Bucky snorted a laugh.
But the other issue wasn’t as easy to outrun. The other question just kept echoing in his head as he tried to chit chat with…he was gonna guess Trish? He hadn’t been listening when either of them introduced themselves… He’d been too busy thinking back to breakfast.
This whole exchange with Rhodey, for the last twenty years?
Tony could be okay, what mechanism had protected Tony from harm… and protected Bucky from hurting him. He’d already made a few drowsy enquiries, as Steve and Tony had helped him to his feet last night – and Tony had just smiled, and said that everything was fine, and that Steve would explain it later…
But, oh, he knew it had been
But the second it was about
… Steve wouldn’t actually feel better for it. Tony might feel better, the way he hoped Rhodey and Pepper did, when he relented and threw them a bone for their efforts. But really Steve would be uncomfortable in what he was saying, selecting the least awkward topic to sacrifice, thinking about the reaction he should be showing rather than the one he was really having. He’d be having the whole conversation through that prism of shame and judgement and doubt…

more, period. I’d try to explain a bit better, I’d try explaining what I would do instead, I’d… Yeah, talk about it all a lot more.”
Steve knelt down beside him, and went back to the sinister smile.
He’d gone straight to Bucky’s room, and not even bothered to say ‘hi’ when Bucky answered the door. Steve just grabbed him by the arms, and kissed him as desperately as he ever had – and Bucky, bless his soul, had caught on immediately. He didn’t just

That he couldn’t even have a vulnerable moment alone in a hotel room anymore.
No other guilt or anxiety still nagging in the background?
He didn’t really have the energy to wash his mug right now either, but certain habits were hard to break. Wearily, he turned on the tap, and waited for the water to heat up.
He realised that not showing ‘weakness’, and not corrupting Tony’s faith in him as a perfect hero, and not losing Tony’s support, had all been such a big part of him not speaking up… but not the only part.
In that instant, Steve understood what was really happening here. Something so terrible that it pushed everything else out of his head –
And Steve just allowed it to wash over him, wave after wave of euphoria, a dreamy smile on his face as Tony fucked harder and faster.
It was
“I’m so glad you’re here,” Steve said, with no attempt to hide the sincerity and emotion in his voice - how could there be? He hadn’t known he was going to say it.
. But for Tony to even think about that much, he’d have to think about what he
And screw it, close enough.
And Steve fell into it so
But she
But after an endless moment Tony felt that first drop of blood spread over his lifeless tongue-
“Everything I said, before…” Steve clarified, increasingly anxious. “And… I don’t know, what you want to happen now…”

shaken by something that got said. And, in the spirit of being honest…
He was already getting to his feet when he looked up at the clock, finding that it wasn’t yet five…
Steve felt his stomach turn over again, that same instinct to claw his own skin off out of sheer embarrassment. He didn’t even know what he’d done… But, Jesus, what if it
Steve forced his eyes open, just as Tony landed heavily on his knees beside him.
Ah. But Tony knew what it
He followed comfortably as Tony led the way outside, to where Happy would be waiting for them, looking unduly enthused about being in the driver's seat, for once. Steve still found it odd that Tony hired a chauffeur and then almost always insisted on driving for himself, but these days it was filed away as a charming eccentricity rather than a frustrating misnomer.
“Yeah - on the condition that I can also ask lots of questions about digital tape brain guy,” Tony added brightly.
“Don’t worry JARVIS. You know how I deal with impossible.”

Already at rock bottom.

Steve grinned, and stood up – suddenly imbued with too much energy to stay still. He was barely aware that he’d started pacing, as let himself get completely carried away with this idea.
It hit Tony even harder now than it had the last time he’d seen him. Perhaps it was that hopeful flash of defiance in his eyes, or that courageous fragility in the way he held himself… or the fact that he did look especially pretty, in the moment…

Thankfully, Steve seemed to understand what he was getting at - because Tony was still far too shaky and uncoordinated to actually undress Steve himself.
It took Steve a second to comply with that one, simply because his body was so overwhelmed. But he clawed himself onto his stomach just as soon as he was physically able – rewarded by what was either a sharp pleasure or a dull pain when his still-sensitive cock was pressed against the sheets.
Which meant, really, he should get up right now without giving it another thought. He should pointedly refuse to acknowledge the real issue, or plan what he was going to think about later, because he knew that would only lead to nagging worries about it now…
...The moment he first recognised what he really wanted - what it really meant to be

But every time he thought of Tony looking up at him and asking,

“Well, I can’t run a comprehensive scan with this” Tony gestured subtly to his watch – the most high-tech piece of equipment they’d risked smuggling in “But I’m pretty sure they just have regular old security cameras.

it’s going to take weeks. So, no, I’m not done with this yet. Unless you can think of any way for me to weasel out of it?” He glanced back at Rhodey, hopefully.
That there was a time when Tony had understood that impulse completely, when it had made more sense than anything. A moment in which Tony knew absolutely everything about it, and didn’t even think it was odd that he knew it – a moment in which Tony was the preeminent expert, entirely confident in himself.
“Sorry,” he muttered… already thinking of another thing he meant to mention… Bucky rolled his eyes affectionately and put his phone away, sitting up to look at Steve when he asked,
The idea of

I mean, I might not
And Tony felt him tense, his grip tightening as he buried himself into Tony, making
“Then it might as well be us.” Steve finished for him.
That there could be just one more happy moment between them, before the end.
. That was it. That was about all Tony knew about Steve, the only reason he could possibly want to keep Steve around… and wasn’t that sad? That Tony was already prepared to upend his whole life and lie to his actual girlfriend for some pretty stranger who’d flattered him? Wasn’t that the exact tactic scammers used on lonely widows and insecure middle-aged men? Was Tony really this desperate for any sort of validation-
And Tony
Twenty years of putting his every human impulse into a box labelled ‘for later’, all these unspoken, unquestioned rules about what was really important… Somewhere along the line, Steve had lost sight of what he was putting off. He’d been so sure for so long that his personal preferences weren’t the priority, that his own hopes and ambitions would have to wait, that he had no choice but to sacrifice what he wanted… He hadn’t even realised that he’d forgotten what it was.
And then, above all of it, the unmistakable sound of Tony bursting out into fits of laughter, just beside him.
Steve was still grinning at this little detail he’d stumbled upon, and the happy mental image that was starting to form around it.
The enormity of what had just happened –
why it was unreasonable – he didn’t even know what point he’d been using that as a bad example of,
“So, what’s the plan?” Bucky asked, as Steve finally forced himself to his feet.
...And everything he’d already felt for himself
And he
It was all too much.
- and for how long.
Maybe all of this was just a symptom of Tony’s madness, rather than anything to do with Steve-
But his thoughts were too sluggish right now to push that train of thought out of the station. So, Tony let it dissolve into nothing, and tried instead to think about how to answer that text…
That was a genuinely nice feeling – even without drugs to enhance it.
“No, of course not,” Pierce replied - in what wasn’t quite his normal voice, but a reasonable approximation of it. “I was hoping you would say that you were building some real relationships here in the 21st Century…”
And, maybe, if he’d had more than a second to process the situation, it would have occurred to Tony that he had to save Bucky for
“Wouldn’t matter if I did. It’s a serum thing. I can’t drink enough to get drunk, usually.” Steve explained, fluidly – which brought Tony’s attention back to the conversation. He made a quick tally of how much of their backstory was public knowledge, and how much he’d have to step in to stop Steve blabbing about.
And then Sam noticed, and looked up at Tony.
As Tony was talking he was walking back towards the door, and Steve just followed him like a puppy. And then Tony took his position, about a foot to the left of the door frame, and gestured to Steve,
“You just called Natasha Romanov,” she said, or possibly asked, her voice completely dazed.
At first, Steve simply assumed that Bucky was calling him a bad friend, and he felt all the unprocessed pain that came with that-
, that taste-
“Don’t be sorry, really.” Tony assured her, helping her to her feet “I love meeting new people.”
“Oh, God-” was cut off by a startled, choking cry as that sensation coiled tight in his hips, his thighs still burning under Steve’s fingertips. His mind blanked completely, ceding everything over to his body as Steve began to work him open with the tip of his tongue. Tony keened, and writhed into it as much as he could, the deep, satisfying friction of Steve’s grip on his legs throbbing into the teasing, needy pleasure that was building under Steve’s lips.
But Tony moved too quickly, pushed him back too forcefully, and suddenly Steve found himself pinned flat to the mattress under one of Tony’s hands, held hard against his shoulder.
Well, obviously. That didn’t make Tony feel any better, because he’d never worried about that in the first place. And, more to the point, he didn’t care about that anyway. The idea of
But still, he’d expected that thought to reappear at this moment. That this reunion might well be coloured by the sadness of all the mistakes he couldn’t unmake and things he’d lost forever…
Steve looked away immediately – he literally looked at the floor, the way he would have if he’d walked in on something obscene. And as soon as he did it, he knew it was wrong. That it was obvious, and awkward, and probably seemed rude… But it was just an instinct. His only thought was

Which meant that the biggest dangers they were actually faced with were, firstly, the people who might slip through the net, and go on the run. The people who might steal physical files or equipment on the way out the door. The people who might have some cell phone numbers memorised, or know which directors to run to, and might therefore be able to start their own tiny splinter cells at some point in the future.

If everything went as badly as it possibly could - if Hydra knew exactly who had attacked their base in Siberia, and had figured out that their cover was blown, and had managed to mobilise their entire organisation earlier that evening - then Steve already knew exactly which measures Tony had put in place to conceal and protect the house, and the various ways in which they could escape, and the hundreds of pre-approved locations they could run to. And, as of fifteen minutes ago, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill, and even Clint and Natasha, had received the packs of carefully selected data and contact details. No more than Steve wanted any of them to know, but enough that they’d be able to mount an immediate defence, whilst Steve focused on
Oh, and there was Steve-

And then he felt Bucky’s hands caress roughly over his hips, pulling Steve into him again, and again, setting that deep, pounding rhythm that
Steve felt his balls tighten painfully, his cock weeping steadily against his stomach as he listened to the reaction murmur through the crowd. He grabbed Tony by the hips, trying to disperse some of that desperation, sucking harder against Tony’s skin.
And then, just as he walked through to the living room, he heard,
“Yes, Tony.”
“How’re you feeling?” Janine enquired brightly, maybe picking up on some change in Tony’s posture.
And he didn’t care.
“Ladies and gentlemen!” A familiar voice boomed from the back of the room. Steve looked up to see Scaramouche - who, from this distance, seemed to be covered from head-to-toe in gold glitter - addressing the guests. “We hope you have all enjoyed your meal this evening. When you are ready, we would like to invite you to join us in the Grand Hall for this evening’s

That hopeless feeling, that all of the courage and strength of character in the world were of no use without the power to see it through.

Steve’s smile still lingered, even as he planned his next few words - words he didn’t want to say, about a topic he never wanted to revisit…

Steve gave up on any pretence that he was going to stop thinking about it, as he turned off the office light, and locked the door behind him. He was somewhat reassured by the thought that it might not be anything about Tony Stark, per se. That maybe it was simply because Stark was attractive, and Steve was currently in a place where

The sound of approaching footsteps caught Steve’s attention before he could spiral again. He looked up at the door of the gym, thinking that this might be actually be a welcome distraction-
But now he realised that they were here for a reason. That they had a cover story to maintain… that he really
Suddenly, Steve saw that he wanted Tony to
“Don’t worry about being sorry, just, let’s just get you fixed up, okay?” Tony replied, pointedly, dragging Wesley’s focus back to him. Wesley winced as he nodded.
“So, just to summarise.” Steve exhaled, wearily “We have a family of potentially evil aliens, with one potentially less evil member, who enslaved another group of aliens, with the help of some other probably-not-evil-but-certainly-complicit aliens. They partnered up with a coloniser named Adam, who might have been evil, or might’ve just been cold hearted, but who is probably now mentally ill.

This was a pure and simple hatred, sparked by Adam and now drawing everything else into it like a black hole.
And, actually the sharp edges on her tone
“An alien?” Tony frowned, interested. Steve felt his gut tighten. After all these hours –
He knew he still had a long way to go. But, at the very least, he’d worked out that he couldn’t forego a chance to make the entire world better, simply because he might cost an old man a job that he didn’t like, and wasn’t very good at. He couldn’t set aside everything he wanted, everything he knew was important, just because someone might not like it. Steve couldn’t spend the rest of his life feeling guilty over every minor inconvenience that he couldn’t avoid for someone…
“…A thing?” Tony prompted, a warm sort of intrigue in his voice.
Actually, it felt a lot like being in the sun used to feel, back when he could just get regular old sunburn…
Out of nowhere, Tony found himself glancing over at the little mobile work desk, currently set up
And Tony simply nodded.
Wesley lived in a rundown little house on Staten Island, with weather-worn wainscotting and a rusted flagpole out front. One lonely window glowed in the encroaching darkness, flickering intermittently with the rhythm of a television screen. Immediately, Tony got the impression of a sad and solitary life.
“No, it’s okay, you can keep talking” Tony whispered, immediately. Instinctively. It took him a few seconds to realise what Steve was even apologising

He didn’t wonder why, he didn’t ask himself what happened next. He just let Tony undress him, obligingly shrugging his way out of his T-Shirt and stepping free of his jeans, blissfully free of all control.

There was the question of whether Steve could be forgiven. Whether, objectively speaking, his mistakes were too large, or his motivations too unsympathetic, or his remorse too insignificant or insincere. Whether Steve deserved any professional consideration, whether Tony could understand his mistakes, whether Tony could move past it, for himself.
And Steve actually had his hand balled into a fist, that time. But again Adam pre-empted him,

Tony gave a low groan in response, his fingers flexing against Steve’s skin. His touch was just a bit rougher when he carried on caressing his way up along Steve’s leg, until he was stroking his hand along the curve of Steve’s ass - Steve arching his back again, to let him.

it now. Another very human feeling, another thing he hadn’t felt in twenty years… and still felt so perfectly natural…
Initially, Steve had tried to explain his objection to eating unfamiliar foods on a planet where everything conspired to get them high… But he’d given up when everyone got too high to listen to him. Now, he was in that wearily familiar position of being the only sober one at the party, getting increasingly irritated by how ridiculous everyone else was being and hating himself for it…

Steve could hear himself saying Tony’s name over and over again, like a prayer - and he honestly had no idea if he was doing it out loud. He could barely hear it over the rush of his pulse in his ears, and the frantic pitch of his breathing. He tried his best to push Tony deeper, but Tony wouldn’t be hurried, dragging every possible sensation out of him as he twisted two fingers into him. At last he felt Tony’s fingertips brush against his prostate, like they were teasing at that limit,
the idea of the anticipation, the waiting - without anything to complicate it.
Steve didn’t miss a beat.
Tony took another step closer – and Steve actually backed away. He saw Tony’s eyes widen as he settled back into his feet, obviously recognising that Steve
And at that exact moment, Tony’s stomach gave a loud and painful rumble – as though it was trying to be spiteful. Reminding him of exactly what he was.
And there
He would have liked the chance to say goodbye.
“...Why are you wearing a toga?” He asked. Bucky groaned heavily, throwing his arms out as he visibly struggled to find a response-

“Of course,” Steve answered, easily… and then realised it actually

little part of him was still kinda thrilled by the idea of Steve being drunk…
Steve moved to pepper teasing little kisses along his jaw, Tony lifting his chin obligingly, letting Steve guide him – offering every inch of himself. Steve felt it burn through him, the pressure tightening as he worked his way down Tony’s throat, Tony pushing himself up against him. Steve kissed his way down Tony’s chest, lifting him by the hips so that he could get to more of him. He tasted of lemonade and suntan lotion.

close to what Steve needed, holding him in this state of impossible desperation. Tony pushed another finger into him, curling his knuckles against Steve’s rim as he began to lick the blood away.

And the hardest part about it was having to put enough distance between them to get their clothes off in the first place-
My sincere apologies that this update is late - after 20 weeks of making the update schedule, I can't tell you how annoyed I was to have missed this deadline. The honest answer is that, as well as it being Steve's birthday, it was also my birthday - and my family couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery. I lost four days to trying to arrange the one small meet up, and as a result ended up somewhat behind.
It wasn’t simply an artificial confidence, a blood-induced

was cut off by a cry, as Steve forced him back into the tight heat of his throat. The sensation was so intense that it bordered on pain, jolting up through that thick, throbbing pleasure, tensing every muscle in his body. He could feel every nerve screaming as Steve pulled back again, dragging those beautiful lips the length of his cock. And then he heard Steve groan – a low, wanton sound that was without question the hottest thing Tony had ever heard in his life. There was a sudden increase in the pressure in his hips, an obvious sharpening in the friction grinding through him-
And the impossible power of Steve’s arms, pulled tight around him,
“Tony, I-”
“An excellent idea!” Scaramouche announced, gleefully. “You do all look as though you could use some rest, before the festivities begin in earnest.”
And, maybe it was just that he hadn’t been brave enough to really think of this, before. Back when he’d been so in love with Steve, and so sure that it could only be bad for him – when he hadn’t wanted to ask himself if he should walk away, because he thought he knew the answer, and he knew he wouldn’t like it…
“They
Wondering if it would matter if he went to bed at seven twenty.
He didn’t
Tony began to realise that he was straying into a topic too deep for the moment. That this was in fact the root of a whole host of things he had to say to Steve – things that he should put some serious thought into first. Because Steve deserved that too. This was something he would have to say properly, another time… But, right now, he really wanted Steve to know,
“Well, thank you,” he murmured - just as Steve’s phone beeped. Steve rolled his eyes as he fished it out of his pocket, frowning before he’d even looked at the screen. “Expecting bad news?” Tony asked lightly.
“Pepper bullied me into it,” Tony began with a sigh, and then flopped on to the other end of the couch.
“So, we just need to find a computer, connect that thing, and then get out?”
But if he did, what then?
“...Sounds like you came up with a better plan than I did, water or not,” he replied, quietly.
“I carried your dad home drunk.” Steve slurred, like he was remembering out loud “Twice.”
…Just by how deeply he’d
His painstaking consideration of all the risk factors suggested that, actually, there wasn’t much that Steve could do to shatter the fabric of reality… But disrupting the actions of any Avengers on a time heist
The others were already waiting for them, seated around a long wooden picnic table. Clint was at one end of it, sitting in a canvas deckchair, keeping his eye on the BBQ - Steve was faintly relieved to see that Laura and the kids had decided to sit this one out. Wanda, Thor and Scott were on one of the benches, Bruce, Rhodey and Bucky on the other, none of them looking especially comfortable.

“I love you,” Steve breathed, pressing a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead. Tony snuggled closer and brought his hand to rest on Steve’s chest.
by the idea of making Tony happy, and spending all those years with him in a much better world - and all the things he never would have had the chance to do, if they’d actually beaten Thanos the first time.
“What, you want to make sure
And Steve could see all of that, and therefore Steve was nervous for him. Anxious for Bucky’s ordeal to be over, willing this to go as smoothly as possible-
So, he popped the little pill free of its paper packaging, his hand still concealed in his pocket, and then swallowed it as discretely as he could. And then he closed his eyes and tried to count to ten.
