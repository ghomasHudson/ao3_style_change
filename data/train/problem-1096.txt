“Can we abandon the pretense that anything about this situation is voluntary on my part?” Sherlock had forced himself to use just half his remaining bag, so as to have a top-up in reserve in case none was immediately forthcoming from Jim; six hours had passed since then, and Jim’s routine was wearing thin.
He was always careful to watch from under his lashes, because it was best to assume that Jim's surveillance ran to low-light cameras.
At this Jim’s face sharpened, as if a veiling had fallen aside, and something with foul breath showed itself for an instant before being put away again. Sherlock could not help himself: he took a step backward. Jim smiled. “Not friends? Okay then! Will, meet your new boss” — and he touched two fingers to the center of his own chest, lightly. His right canine had caught in his lower lip but as his smile grew wider the flesh was freed.
Sherlock’s legs wrap themselves around John’s back; John brings his left hand down behind Sherlock’s thigh to stroke him and braces himself on his right elbow; “Come on, then,” he says, “I want to see.” Sherlock leaves off clutching at the blanket and latches on to John’s arms, opens his eyes to gaze directly into John’s face, only for a moment: he twists up and muffles a long cry against John’s neck. His fingers are going to leave bruises. John is savagely glad about this. He raises himself to wipe some of the come scattered on Sherlock’s belly and slick his own cock with it. Sherlock can be a selfish prat but, give him his due, he seems to regard sex as something that ought to be done at least as well as chemistry, or detection, or the wearing of closely tailored suits, so he’s deadly alert to everything John likes: with both hands, he reaches behind John to spread him and push against his hole, because there’s something about that combination of fucking into his own hand while his arse is held open, that feeling of being made visible front and back, that sends John flying wild faster than anything. It works on him now the way it always works, until he falls groaning into Sherlock’s arms.
ETA: It turns out that posting a work in progress ... doesn't work for me, in that it just about paralyzes me with self-consciousness. I am not abandoning "Guilty," but I won't post more until the whole thing's done. Hopefully, that plan will enable me to finish sooner than I could if I went on posting chapter by chapter. If you've read this far, I apologize for leaving you hanging, and I promise a happy ending.
“Bang in the Uncanny Valley, yes?” Sherlock says. “There were better ones, of course, but the overall standard was not high.”
The new guards’ suits, identical to those of the previous pair — so whoever had had Sherlock kidnapped liked his henchmen in uniform — were reasonably good, if not bespoke, but a touch flashy: the blue a shade too light, the fabric a glimmer too shiny. Conclusion: someone showy, dramatic, and fussy about detail was in charge of a prospering but not (not yet?) top-line criminal organization; additional conclusion: the man who had supervised Sherlock’s removal from the flat where he’d shot up was said drama-loving leader of a criminal organization; additional conclusion: said drama-loving leader of a criminal organization not only wished to make use of Sherlock’s skills but also took a personal interest in him. This last was troubling.
John was looking at an elegant spell to make legible traces of DNA that had degraded seemingly beyond hope of recovery. That was a feat in itself — but more astonishing yet was the spell’s structure, for it directly incorporated mundane science. Such a thing should have been impossible. He knew what expression of amazement he must have worn.
“If you wish to gain information, you must never interrupt the person from whom you wish to gain it. I was going to say, just before, ‘But if I am to employ you, then we must first discuss the conditions under which you are to be employed.’”
” Still on the tightrope. Feisty Vassals were loyal to their feudal lords, were they not? Their very feistiness demonstrated their allegiance; their affection, even.
“You don’t think that’s laying it on rather thick?” Sherlock said of this last, through a wave of nausea of whose source he felt unsure. Under the street-side window was, inevitably, a low table of pale wood on which were arranged three smooth black stones and a narrow glass vase with some bare black branches in.
Duane Oliphant made a second appointment. He thanked Sherlock; he turned the handle of the office door; he stepped out onto the pavement, dropped into the stream of people, and walked toward whatever destination he desired.
insincere. Every facial expression, every posture, every turn of phrase — they are all consciously learnt, with the aim of presenting myself as what I am not.”
To speak was nearly to capitulate, alas, but Mycroft wanted very much to see the back of the man. “Do bear in mind, Mr. Hareton, that if not for the attributes you cite, you would not even be aware that the threat existed.”
Sherlock reminded himself that he was covered in cold sweat already: so there was nothing for Jim to notice. “I was struck by a cyclist on the Tottenham Court Road. There’s an NHS clinic nearby, so — ” He retched. The nausea was also real.
Sherlock was dying to fix. “I’m going to be away for a while. A few weeks, I can’t be sure,” he said.
When John tired of evenings spent wondering what had become of his life, he walked. From one of the crumbling warrens where the poorest lived, and the smells of rotten cabbage, river water, night soil crowded the air because the streets were never cleaned, you could pass in the space of a few minutes to a quarter busy with louche establishments — places where the sap of poppies could be bought, or women, or for that matter men — and thence, in a few minutes more, to a grandly lighted boulevard along which sleek horses bore their even sleeker riders toward entertainments John could only imagine, as he could never afford to attend them: formal balls, with velvet-and-silk-clad dancers cutting geometrical figures over polished marble floors; performances by esteemed instrumentalists, the audience silent in awe; sumptuous meals, course after course after course of terrapin and lark and suckling pig —
The Warren Street tube station is on the Northern and Victoria lines, which are partially automated and
he had begun, and in response Sherlock began blathering in comedic-lofty vein about the utility of milk-spoilage chronologies in estimating how long a flat had been empty, supposing the tenant had embezzled vast sums from the charitable organization that employed her and then fled the UK . . . Sherlock kept up this stream of preposterousness for so long that John started to laugh, and put up his hands to signify
But what I now relate is not precisely the story of a case. My friend had just concluded the investigation whose particulars may be found among my papers, as “The Adventure of the Seventh Oyster.” The puzzle had been rather more entertaining than significant, and at its conclusion Holmes and I both found ourselves in high spirits. We betook ourselves to Simpson’s and then attended a violin-concert, pleasant though not memorable.
He was never going to get away, and the best he could hope for was that when Jim was done with him the end would come with him kneeling somewhere anonymous with his hands tied behind his back, and a bullet to the brain: perhaps Jim had that much sentiment. Perhaps. It was much too easy to imagine quite different scenarios, most of which ended with himself as the subject of one of Jim’s home movies.
before he left. Sherlock barely heard it. He had his cotton, his candle, his tourniquet, and his spoon all ready, so there was no delay.
John spends a few nights on Mike Stamford’s couch while he files the paperwork to register as magically disabled. The intake worker can’t conceal her dismay when she comes to the space on his Work Capability Assessment indicating what extent of magical ability the claimant has left; well, that’s all right, John thinks, since he can barely conceal his dismay either.
The thaumatology consultant had, as promised, enrolled John in a first-phase clinical trial of a new means of delivering TKDT that, it’s hoped, will enable it to cross the blood–brain barrier. Every day he takes twenty milliliters of a tasteless pale-pink liquid that may or may not be a suspension of TKDT, and once a week he visits the neurothaumatology lab at UCLH, high in the glass-walled biomedical research tower, where he repeats the imaging and function tests done at A&E the day of his accident. Prince Charles probably hates the tower, but its structure, two shallow curves of wing separated by a central column, reminds John of the architecture of a human skeleton, as no doubt it’s supposed to do; he finds it elegant. Graceful, even.
There were three reasons why he had not yet escaped: The difficulty of getting heroin. The wish to avoid starring in one of Jim’s videos. The evidence implicating him in Niall’s murder. Three reasons: so he had thought; it hadn’t occurred to him that with the gaoler holding open the door of his cell and bowing him out, a prisoner might hold fast to the thought of enclosure, the thought of how he might fold himself up with his arms wrapped around his legs and, as long as he did what he was told, he would be safe.
“To cast Animatio,” Sherlock says, sounding personally offended by the information, “is not difficult. Yes, yes: the creation of life or at least its semblance” — a barely audible pause here — “weightiest implications of magical practice; humility in the face of same, et cetera. But the spell depends on the identical principles, somewhat elaborated, as the basic spell for establishing an electrical charge that is taught in secondary school physics. It’s
If he were caught jumping the gate it would probably get back to Jim, but Sherlock’s mind’s eye showed him the crowded ticket hall, the Oyster card machines, the brevity of the wait to spot someone unwary whose card he could pilfer without the attendant’s noticing; the task, he now saw, had never really been
to be signed, as if John might have had no idea who had picked the lock on his flat and come in without permission to —
“Oh,” Sherlock says, only that. He gets up and crosses the small space of floor between his chair and John’s. John’s heart clamors; he stands up into Sherlock’s space, still looking at him, trying to send out toward Sherlock each grain and every atom of his wordless love, and as Sherlock studies his face John sees his own emotions mirrored there, fear desire admiration tenderness yearning delight, in sequence, in combination after combination, one blending into another until finally Sherlock has learnt all of them and they resolve into joy — and Sherlock, who from the first moment John saw him has been working magic that no one else can do, says, “Yes. Of course, yes,” and John kisses him.
Willis went loose at the knees and would have staggered, but O’Malley and Bewick held him firmly by the upper arms. “In my flat,” Willis said. “Taped to the pipe under the kitchen sink. There's a locker key for a health club in Marylebone. There's a phone in the locker, it's got one contact in it, his name's Jenkins, I was working for him. He's the one you want, I’m just his errand boy, I'm nobody, please, just check the phone . . .”
Sherlock smiled. “She saves most of the money you give her for clothes — she’s worked out that though your own tailoring is bespoke, you haven’t a clue about women’s attire, she knows her position with you is a temporary one, and she’s thinking ahead, building up a nest egg for the weary days of middle age.”
She had chosen the spot that gave her the best vantage of the waiting room as a whole. But instead of watching the door through which W. S. S. Holmes, Spiritual and Practical Counselor, would emerge, as one might expect of a prospective client curious about the person she was about to pay, she had trained her gaze, and with it her full attention, on the street door. She had been chewing her lip; at the sound of Sherlock’s voice she shot halfway out of the chair.
“It would have been such a waste, last night. Cutting and running, I mean. But you didn’t do it, and that makes me think we can call the job permanent now.”
in every face he passed that evening; he sat looking out of his window for a while, trying to think how he might find Sherlock again, and at last laid himself heartsore to sleep.
I could continue reciting the benefits of his presence at Baker Street, but the fact is that at the date of which I write he had most inconveniently learned of the existence of an adult cousin, a married woman living in Hertfordshire, and had gone haring off to visit her, wittering on about how glad he was to have discovered he had living family and so on and so forth. It was tiresome, the more so because the season was late winter and the flat was cold.
To the woman whose mother had died of Alzheimer’s three years past without their ever being reconciled: “She’s free of pain now,” Sherlock told her sincerely, “and it’s as if the dementia had never been.” Where was the lie? The dead didn’t suffer, being dead, and all the suffering they experienced in life evanesced with that life, had been less than smoke long before the body cooled. The lies could come later, having accreted plausibility to themselves thanks to that slippery not-untruth.
The law could deal with Smith, that was the thing. There would have been a way. Evidence. There could have been surveillance on patients in Smith’s hospital. Mycroft could have arranged that.
I had opened my hands in assent — assent also to the revelations now inevitable — when, to my vast relief, Holmes raised a finger admonishing me to silence: he had heard Lestrade’s foot upon the stair.
I sent him, in some irritation. There was, it transpired, little of interest to be said concerning the fungi of Aberdeen.
he thought as he awoke. That afternoon he felt a little better than he had in some time, so he asked one of the kind women for an envelope in which to put the blue-black feather he had found underneath his pillow. He put the envelope in his rucksack and, his energies exhausted, went back to bed.
He retched again, and as he straightened, wiping away the reflexive tears and the string of thin bile-tasting spittle that depended from his mouth, the door opened. The guards had been alert, before; now their eyes widened, their posture stiffened; the one to the left side of the door tightened his mouth and glanced sideways, toward the man who had just come in — who gave Sherlock a finger waggle and said, “Wide awake, I see!”
to which it was not possible to return any answer that would not lead to our immediate arrests, so I laid out the pieces of the puzzle so far and returned to the thermite reaction.
There was a bag of coffee in the refrigerator. He rinsed out the French press, made himself a cup, and fixed at the kitchen table while it brewed. Seb, or whatever his name was, hadn’t blown a vein, at least, but all the same it was high time to develop genuine ambidexterity, a useful skill in many contexts . . .
“If they died suddenly, like this one,” Sally Donovan says, unexpectedly, “they turned all at once, right? But if they died slowly, like of a disease, did it — creep up on them? Part of them stone and part of them not?”
“It’s such a relief,” Delia Smithson went on, “that you can see it. My aura, I mean. It feels — just gray to me. He’s everywhere I go, Mr. Holmes. Showing his face just for a moment and then he’s gone. Around a corner or in a crowd . . . It’s worst in the tube; nobody notices one extra figure. I’ve even asked people standing near him to get hold of him, you know, so I could confront him, because I would, but of course he’s a disembodied
. Blast, I am doing it again. Very well: Holmes and I had, about a year prior to that memorable September day, become lovers — Labouchère Amendment and Society for the Suppression of Vice be damned.
A crescent moon hung in John’s window, and someone had spoken his name. “You — Where did you go?” he said, winding his fist in Sherlock’s hair. He rolled Sherlock over and straddled him. “Where?”
“As I have said,” Mycroft resumed, “the logical next step is to provoke outright civil disorder in as many of the NATO states as possible. What we lack, thanks to what I might call either the colossal failures of our intelligence services” — here the JIO chairman rolled his eyes; he really was not bad at the double act — “or the stupendous success of the Russians’, is any inkling of how they intend to proceed toward it.
Mr Wing was naturally perplexed by these events; I told him that Wiggins was my apprentice, and he was satisfied. One so often has occasion to observe how many people are willing to accept, as an explanation for unusual behavior, a statement which is nothing of the sort.
suited to it. And now . . . ” The man gazes into John. “Well. You might as well wear a placard bearing the words ‘I am desperately bored.’”
I sent him away with a shilling or two and retained the bellows, as our old one was showing signs of wear. Watson had been complaining about it.
That had been in a pamphlet; Sherlock read it more than once during those white days, because more than occasionally there was absolutely nothing else to do.
useful for understanding Russian anxieties about NATO and the desire for a buffer zone against the West.
“Think of my life when I met him, then. What do you imagine the days of a lady’s maid are like? They are all ‘Yes, ma’am,’ ‘No, ma’am,’ ‘Right away, ma’am.’ ‘That dress looks most fetching on you, ma’am.’ Days — weeks — sometimes months — went by when no one asked my real opinion of anything, or noticed when my feet were sore, or drew my attention to a picture or a flower that might please me.”
A crumb of sorrow in John’s heart also lifts its wings and rises, waveringly, higher and higher; and higher yet; and then it is gone.
What was left! Nothing that John could use, surely. He unwrapped the scrap of bandage that held the serpent’s scale, and turned it over and over. Sherlock’s breathing was labored; a week ago he had whispered, “You see, it’s just as I knew it would be,” and since then John had not heard him speak.
And what of those seemingly unguarded moments like the one at the Ladies’ Bathing Pond, the moments when Sherlock, looking at the remains of what had once been alive and had suffered, could say “it”?
And this was why Holmes’s innocent question put me in some difficulty. For to answer it would be to divulge my connection with the booksellers of Holywell Street, and that line of conversation led, in turn, directly to the matter of my sexual tastes. Therefore, “It’s nothing, Holmes,” I said.
Coburne refuses legal counsel. He refuses to discuss his motives. He pleads guilty to casting Animatio and to manslaughter — it is felt that a charge of murder will not stick — and otherwise keeps silence until finally, pressed by the judge at sentencing, he makes this statement:
Rockham hadn’t moved his gaze, hadn’t pointed, hadn’t — Oh, he was a clever man, clever indeed. He had, of course, picked the one person in the room whom he could be almost entirely confident Sherlock didn’t already know. Precisely: the blonde.
When Sherlock looked behind himself again, Jim was gone. Sherlock watched the police for a little longer, but the crowd had already begun to thin some minutes ago, when the van bearing Niall’s corpse pulled away; soon lingering would make him conspicuous, so he walked home again.
He was required to eat two meals a day. He could heat one of the prepared meals supplied to him, or order takeaway from his choice of five restaurants where Jim’s organization had accounts. They were good restaurants and delivery was always swift.
But it is barren. There is no cuttlefish. There is no bell to ring. There is no climbing chain or food-puzzle toy. There is not even a mirror. There is a perch, and there is a bowl of food, and there is a bowl of fresh water. Sherlock wishes he could unmake his promise not to steal Beakley, a winged sociable creature of trees and plains who exists in a desert of boredom. Beakley would probably become a cocaine addict at once if given the opportunity. His feathers are shabby and all in all he looks much the way John’s voice sounded when he told the story.
He knew where the microphones and cameras were; there was no reason for Jim to bother to hide them. Still holding the syringe, Sherlock made a survey of the flat. All the red lights on all the devices had gone dark. Jim hadn’t planned for this.
“You want me to run cons — specifically, you’re thinking that a psychic would usefully diversify your business.”
Miss Winter had barely set foot in the flat when she spotted it; she froze in the act of removing her gloves.
“Oh! This is too much, it really is too much!” He was looking positively ferocious now; the bees might go as far as the Antipodes. I went to his side and took the paper from him.
People who phoned for appointments arrived, as it were, pre-convinced, even more thoroughly than those who had just spotted the sign and rung the bell on impulse. Sherlock shook their hands and told them how very welcome they were and how very glad he was to be able to offer his services.
Sherlock vacillated briefly between Latin and a purpose-invented gobbledygook for the words of the ritual, but opted for Latin because he had learned it in primary school, and why get creative when the Catholics had done the job for him already? “Sage, asafetida, a censer, a dozen twelve-inch beeswax candles and two candelabra to hold them. Matches. A shallow glass bowl six inches in diameter and black ink sufficient to fill it. Two handbells,” he told the air when he had finished his choreography. A box with a manifest including every item on his list arrived the next morning, brought by the same indifferent blank man who delivered the food. Sherlock arranged them in his office, rehearsed once, and that evening sent Delia Smithson home, entirely exorcised, just before eight. If her bank account had been a tin can, she could have held it to her ear to enjoy the clinking of the coin or two within.
If the world were perfect, Beakley could go to live on the African plains where his relatives must once have lived, but he would not know how to conduct himself there. A wild baby lovebird learns how to be a wild grown-up lovebird. Beakley never got these lessons. If he must be a lovebird in a cage, then at least he can be a lovebird in an immense and interesting cage with some bird friends. What might the first item be, on Beakley’s list of “Things I would like in a friend”?
The night of the quarter moon, Sherlock cried out in his delirium; wide-eyed, he gripped John’s shoulder and whispered, “You see, it’s just as I knew it would be,” then fell back, panting like an animal pursued.
Which reminds him that Sherlock had let them into their room, before, and that he isn’t quite sure where he put his key card. He pats down every pocket, pats them all down again, digs to the bottom seam and corners of each one, even of the bloody coin pocket of his bloody trousers which is too small to possibly fit a key card, even if you folded said key card into fourths which you can’t do, God damn it, and finally has to concede that the bloody fucking thing has vanished.
“Fine words butter no parsnips, Wiggins,” I told him. I meant to review the fundamentals of careful observation, but we were interrupted by the arrival of a telegram from Watson, and by the time I had read it and written out a reply, Wiggins had absconded.
“Time off! And plenty of it. No more Monday counseling service, Tuesday counseling service, Wednesday counseling service. Thursdays, Fridays, and weekends only. And pretty soon we’re going to be adding some variety to your weekend nights.”
Sherlock waited — Yes, there was the bright expressionless gaze. If you looked carefully at Jim’s face when he wore that look you could see right down into the pit.
“Interesting,” Sherlock said. “This may be the first time I have ever attracted a hiring director. Tell me, what is it you think you’re hiring me for?”
Sherlock shakes his head. “I saw the block of marble he planned to carve her from, and then, of course . . . ” He opens his hand to hold empty air. “But, John, you still haven’t said why you went. I thought for some time that it was on account of Galatea, because you’d worked out the truth of what I am, but it seems the revelation came to you more slowly than I surmised.” A false smile, and John is suddenly aware that he recognizes it: it’s the one meant to conceal uncertainty. “Additionally, I understood, of course, that you were in great distress over the loss of your magic, and I’m familiar with the phenomenon by which anger stands in, as it were, for grief and fear, but beyond that . . . I found your motivations opaque.” He looks down at his hands again.
is always terrific, but with this chapter she went above and beyond. To the extent that you find you're not reading two thousand words of info-dump, thank her!
knocking, lightly, under his skin. Once he was clean it became more obvious how very bad indeed he must have smelled to Jim and the suit-clad henchmen. Perhaps he ought to do some laundry.
Jim squatted, to shout directly into Sherlock’s face. His breath was minty. Sherlock forced himself not to lean away. “Cute, Will.
So there was nothing for it. Perhaps the imaginings I had written down and put into print would appall him; he might even leave me. But that was a
Sherlock withdrew his attention from the shouty Lycra Lout and looked down. How had he not noticed? The new arrival was quite right: the fabric on the distal side of his left thigh was torn and bloody, revealing a long laceration beneath, and a small pool of blood had formed under him. Well, that explained the pain in his leg.
he had asked; the answer, half heard, was drifting into vapor, but he snatched at the memory, and caught.
Outside the pet supply store where the tired mother buys lovebird food, there appears a table laden with information about Greater London Lovebird Rescue. The table is set up and run by a young woman who used to be part of Sherlock’s Homeless Network and who now, being no longer Homeless, is simply part of his Network. Mysteriously, she and it manifest themselves about an hour before the tired mother goes lovebird-food shopping, and then unmanifest themselves a few minutes after the tired mother has bought the lovebird food and left the shop, having been offered, and having eagerly taken, a flyer:
I was preparing to resume work on my monograph concerning the beetles of the Thames estuary when Mrs Hudson brought in my breakfast; on removing the lid from my bacon I found myself in possession of
Later, what Sherlock remembered most strongly about the first day of the W. S. S. Holmes (J. Moriarty) counseling business was the quiet. It was even quieter than his last days of liberty — of something like liberty — had been. He sat at his desk in the consulting room, hands folded in front of him, watching the CCTV feed from the front door. At four, he locked up, climbed the stairs, and sat on the couch with his hands on his knees. It was far too soon for withdrawal to have set in, but he soon found himself scratching at his forearms anyway. To distract himself and pass the time he closed his eyes, listening to the muffled street sounds, thinking:
He tried to watch till dawn, but he fell asleep for a moment or maybe only looked away, and when he turned back, with the morning all around him, Sherlock was gone.
Before 1906 was out, Miss Winter had become Holmes’s acknowledged apprentice — acknowledged among us, that is. She had taken the surname Emerson, but even so it was necessary to keep her out of the public eye: during her trial, her name had been on every scandal-monger’s lips, and the sensation-papers, whose readers would have been thrilled to hear of the “Female Holmes,” would have swarmed her and soon uncovered her past. Holmes’s wish to retire a few years later presented a conundrum, for neither of us liked to see him withdraw his aegis and leave her without a means of earning her keep; fortunately, his brother Mycroft stepped in. He had connexions in Boston; armed with letters of introduction to them, Miss Katherine Emerson and her friend removed to that city, where she set up a consultancy of her own. She and Sherlock continued to correspond, from time to time also exchanging telegrams when she sought his advice on a case.
John tries to think of it like this: there was the time after the army and before Sherlock; he had been alone during those months. Then Sherlock cured his limp and, for a while, standing, eating, sleeping beside all that imperious beauty, John had felt whole and important again. He’d been wrong, it turned out, about the importance, but for as long as that feeling had lasted — as long as that silk cord had seemed to run between himself and Sherlock — it had been ...
At “I can’t blame them,” the soldier had smiled fleetingly. Rapport was everything. Sherlock said, “You read through the instructions on the website?” The soldier had. “And you’ve brought something of his with you?”
Between patients at the clinic, John tells himself he ought to cut his losses. While he waits for whatever takeaway he is bringing home of a Friday night, he tells himself he ought to cut his losses. While he and Sherlock are fucking, John thinks
Though I interrogated him closely, I could not discover that Wiggins had observed anything of moment. He hung his head and swore to do better, “because you been doing your best to train up all us Irregulars, Mr Holmes, and we always want to do our best in return, like.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. He laid his palm against John Watson’s cheek and kissed him into the morning.
“Ssh,” Sherlock says. He even puts a finger to John’s lips. The door at the far end of the aviary room is opening to reveal the director of Greater London Lovebird Rescue, the tired mother, and the five children, whose sad faces brighten when they see the airy room and the joyful birds cheeping and twittering throughout. The mother is carrying Beakley in his too-small cage. Even from this distance John can see him raise his head at the sound of the other birds, and begin to look about him.
“To be my plus-one at social events with Rockham. Of course,” Sherlock said, nodding, setting off another round of retching. “Yes, I can see it. He provides cover, making me look even more innocuous” — he was mimicking Jim’s wide-eyed look rather well, he thought, given the unfavorable circumstances — “than I am.”
— No. “Stupid stupid stupid,” he repeated, until the word stopped meaning anything. He put his right hand in his jacket pocket and rubbed his thumb against the side of his forefinger, and eventually the meaningless sound and the rubbing combined to enable him to think further.
John is laying Tranquilium for a patient who presents with migraine. In the form he’s using, Tranquilium downregulates production of the neurotransmitter triskaidekotonin, TKDT, high levels of which are implicated in migraine and normal levels of which mediate neocortical activity associated with the exercise of magic.
The dead animate’s face had been contorted in terror and pain, but Sherlock had called her “it.” Of all those present at that scene, it was Sherlock, dropping his history lesson and his bored deductions, Sherlock empty of pity, who seemed least human.
The upstairs room that had been John’s is his and Rosie’s now; it has been repapered in blue stripes and furnished out of John’s flat, except that when it came to moving the bed he had slept in with Mary and then, as a widower, alone, John had found himself on the phone with a charity shop. It’s a good bed and someone will get years of use from it, but that person is not John; he sees it off into the shop’s pickup van without allowing his thoughts to form themselves into words. If he did think the words, they would go something like this: He loved Mary, in spite of everything; their bed doesn’t belong in the flat he will share again with Sherlock. As the words are not to be thought, so the reasons are not to be examined.
“We have a prosecution for using Animatio, anyhow,” says Lestrade, “assuming we can find the practitioner who did it. And meanwhile, we’re investigating this as a murder, so if the prosecutors decide it is one, we can make the case.”
But John has finally caught up. “No, wait, I’m not apologizing for turning you in — not that I’ve got the first idea who I’d turn you in to anyway, but that’s —
Sherlock did not trouble to watch him pedal away, but instead took hold of the lanyard around the short authoritative man’s neck and turned the badge to read it.
“Because,” Sherlock said, fascinated now, “the movements of your left hand as you tie off the suture are coarser than the movements of the right, as one would expect if you were right-handed. Yet the deliberation with which you use your right hand to insert the suturing needle and draw it through suggests that that hand is not naturally dominant. A doctor with your years of experience would not normally have to give such careful conscious attention to an everyday task when using his dominant hand. Finally, not only is your motor control deficient on the left side, but on close scrutiny it becomes obvious that the shoulder is stiff.
Sherlock’s luck was in, if you discounted the abdominal cramps and the sweating: he found Niall in a “Tibetan handicrafts” stall in Camden Market, eyeing up the girl who worked the till. Meaning the girl’s luck was in, too, because the only thing Niall liked more than pestering girls who weren’t in a position to give him the bird and kick him in the bollocks was doing junkies a bad deal on heroin. “Yeah,” Niall said, “Shezza. What’s hangin’?” and Sherlock was in a cold sweat all over so he didn’t roll his eyes. He bought three bags and a set of works at what was, for Niall, a not-terrible price and stumbled into the nearest Boots for rubbing alcohol which he poured over the works in the Camden High Street Gentlemen’s Public Convenience before he fixed. When the sheer bliss of relief had subsided enough that he could make himself stand up again, he bought some fish and chips and went home.
When Sherlock awoke, at four in the morning, Jim was seated across the table, thumb-thumb-thumbing his phone. “Full marks for communication skills,” Jim said. Sherlock looked at the laptop between them and thought about whether he could safely reach for it.
but thinking, through his own distraction, that Sherlock must be something else entirely, a practitioner not just more powerful than others but of some different matter altogether.
He had no coin to toss but he could follow first one walker, then another, then another. Choose by the color spectrum, why not? Red garment, then orange garment, then yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. It was as good a way to randomize as any other. He would end who knew where — that, it struck him, made a neat summation of his prospects in general. In rehab someone would have asked, with that sweet-toned sympathy that made him feel as though he had just bitten down on a piece of aluminium foil,
Or was “objects” the right word? Sherlock had found himself in front of a triptych. The artist — her name was Jill Rosenzweig — had gathered thousands and thousands of leaves and sorted them from green to driest brown, then laid them out, overlapped like scales, to make a ribbon of color, with high summer at one end and cold oncoming at the other. Rosenzweig had photographed the result of her labors early on, then again at the halfway point, and last when she had finished. There was no photo showing the ribbon complete, because at each stage some of the leaves had already blown away. It was — incomprehensible, really. The gathering and sorting alone must have taken days, and the ribbon of fading color, meticulous, why make such an ephemeral thing at all? Sherlock had read over all the art-press coverage of Rosenzweig’s earlier work and he had a vocabulary ready to impress Rockham with, if it proved useful to turn the conversation that way, but now he found himself inventorying the species she had used and gauging the wind speed and direction from the disturbances in the leaves. He moved on to the next photo, and was rooted to the spot.
the promised luxury accommodations,” and he does laugh. But, John has to admit, very moderately indeed.
As Sherlock asleep is different from Sherlock waking, so Sherlock naked is different from Sherlock clad. To see Sherlock dressed, you would think he was made of smooth cream all over. In fact he is much scarred. He had been relatively careful about needles but the cocaine time was long, and then long again, plenty of opportunity for missteps, so faded purple clusters mark the crooks of his elbows, and his forearms are trailed with purple. Both his elbows and both his forearms, because Sherlock in his thoroughness taught himself to be ambidextrous. He was stabbed in the thigh once, when he was twenty-six, and then again in Switzerland by one of Moriarty’s people, while he was away. Astonishingly, no one had thought to break his fingers, but he has been burned with cigarettes: Serbia. There is a flat white splash of acid burn on the inside of his left wrist: Cambridge. White threads crisscross his back: Serbia again.
Sherlock says: “I thought perhaps the potion was such a gesture as might make that clear.” A pause. “Before you left . . . At the scene with Galatea, I saw at once, from your reaction in particular, that I had misstepped. It was because of the revulsion, you see, that all the histories take such care to mention. I thought it best to make plain how remote from myself I found her. I, human;
“Do you still think of him, then?” It was an extraordinarily intimate question, and I don’t know what made me ask it: perhaps the state of the flat suggested a relaxation of normal constraints, or perhaps it was simply that we were soon to have an ocean between us, most likely forever.
because why not, it was exactly the sort of thing he’d find amusing, in a small way, not as much as shooting someone in the kneecaps, of course, or the less sensuous but more intellectually satisfying project of building a criminal empire, still one takes one’s pleasures where one finds them, and by the time Sherlock’s doorbell rang, twelve minutes and approximately thirty-nine seconds late by the laptop clock, he was trembling and had barely a cuticle to his name.
She spoke with entire conviction; I was too appalled to do more than gasp. As for Holmes, he actually drew back his lip in scorn. “I should have thought blackmail beneath you,” he said.
The soldier produced a small book, flimsy, printed on cheap paper and stapled together by hand. “This’ll do, yeah? Fadil gave it to me, but it’s his, I mean he wrote it. — Poetry,” he said heavily. “I don’t know Arabic, but he wrote in some of the translations for me.”
“I can read and write and do my sums, but who’ll hire me to teach? I can sew, but my mother went blind sewing. I can whore” — I was irrationally shocked to hear the word spoken in our sitting-room — “but . . . I couldn’t make it pay enough, anyhow.” I thought, with a pang of conscience, that neither I nor Holmes had considered how Miss Winter must have earned her bread after Gruner abandoned her. It is one thing to be a Liane de Pougy, however notorious, another to ply the streets of the West End.
Mycroft had said that to him, or he had said it to Mycroft; curiously, Sherlock could no longer remember which.
O’Malley nodded to Bewick. They zip-tied Willis’s hands behind his back, and then Bewick took out his garrote.
And all their voices, quiet or laughing, from time to time sharp with annoyance, often eager with explanation, almost always warm.
Sherlock says, “And everything I have learnt about human demeanor and behavior suggests that you are telling the truth.”
, because that wasn’t right. A raven, a fox, a serpent. Not a man, at all. Not a man — “How do you know I suspect it’s dull?” he said.
The empty vial of counterpotion rests in the inner breast pocket of John’s donkey jacket. He hadn’t taken the jacket off when he sat down, since he had no idea how long he might be staying. It’s bunched up uncomfortably behind him, but he’s still unsure whether he can presume so far as to take it off and hang it up —
He tried to keep himself awake for a while at night, after he fixed. Between the fear and the lack of exercise, this was less difficult than one might have expected. His bed stood under the window and the nearby buildings were taller than the place he inhabited; if he fought sleep long enough, and if any of the people who lived in those buildings were still up by the time he lay down, he could watch the lights in their windows go out one by one. Sometimes human figures were visible, moving or standing, passing in and out of the lit rooms, silent and untouchable as the stars, which from this angle Sherlock couldn't see at all and which, though he thought of them from time to time, he did not miss.
He gathered up the crumpled loo paper from the floor and flushed it away. There was a package of four rolls under the bathroom sink but he had gone through one entire roll, wiping his eyes and nose and mouth, already. He tried to consider the question whether Jim would be suspicious if he asked for an extra package this week; how long was the runny nose meant to last? He couldn’t remember that from rehab, probably because once the cramps and the trots started they subsumed awareness of everything else. Another thing to consider: If the cramps started soon, would they end sooner, or would an early start only mean a longer bout of cramps?
Mycroft never paced, nor did he stoop to such expedients as picking his cuticles. He did not shout. He did not watch cat videos on YouTube or ITV detective shows set in especially scenic portions of the British Isles. When he needed a respite from thinking about one subject, he thought about another. Unfortunate that at present all paths led back to the question of what the Russians intended and the meagerness of the means available to prevent it.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. Of course he had worked this out, or Mycroft had sent him Artie Watson’s form.
Holmes read for some time, half reclined in the bed, while I sat beside him, forcing myself to remain quiet — not to explain, not to excuse, not to snatch the book from his hands and implore him to expunge every word from his mind; not to
“You know, of course, that during my medical studies I was always short of money.” For all the inheritance I had was my father’s fine watch, with its fob containing a lock of my mother’s hair, and these I would not sell.
Sherlock says, again in that tone John has never heard from him before; “and then, so to speak, its reversal.” There’s something almost tender in his expression, John decides: this might be what Sherlock looks like when he’s genuinely impressed.
On his way out he reached as if to pat Sherlock on the shoulder, then drew back just before contact would have been made, with a look of distaste. Sherlock couldn’t tell whether the look was real. He lay down and refrained from rubbing at the place on his shoulder where the touch would have come.
is gone, no, the time for hiding had never been. He takes his hands away and forces himself to meet Sherlock’s gaze, meets it with all the frightened, naked feeling he had been too cowardly to expose.
Jim had not been wrong to say that the work suited his talents well. Sherlock made a game for himself, of drawing the clients in without actually lying. This was child's play when the subject of the inquiry was unavailable for comment.
Superglue includes neither lavender nor clove but it smells, not quite pleasantly, like a combination of the two. It’s unmistakable. John has time to think how funny it is that just this once, his train of thought should be as fast as Sherlock’s, and then he feels sick to his stomach, and also as if he might faint.
It had been a shock to discover, when Jim left him back at the shop after that casual friendly mentoring-rich stroll, that he was tired out. Partly that was because Jim’s company, Jim’s attention, was — well, it was best faced with every sense attuned to all signals that might come one’s way; perhaps that was how one might most clearly put the case — anyway, fifteen minutes of Jim in certain moods was enough to leave one sweating and trembling. He was spending more time with Sherlock now, what with the shopping for Will Holmes’s suits, shirts, shoes, what with the need to decide how Will might present himself the better to become indispensable to Andy Rockham. It was bad. It was . . . very bad, Sherlock admitted to himself. And Jim hadn’t even been in one of
“Looking for this?” Jim said, and dropped it on the table in front of Sherlock. He was quick, so quick; when had he got to the tubing?
A breath drawn in. Needle in, needle through, needle out. Tie. Then another pause, longer than the first.
John grabs at the arms of his chair. Perhaps he hasn’t spoken the words “Oh, God” out loud, because Sherlock only frowns;
a client, and Holmes had learned to more or less enjoy a few days’ leisure without resort to the contents of his morocco-leather case, so I at least was not best pleased at the interruption. Still, those who came to Holmes were often enough in desperate straits — besides, my friend
If I’m right, we’ll make a great team. And if I’m wrong, well — ” He set his index finger pointing upward under Sherlock’s jaw. “So it goes.”
Night after night John stood beside the avenue where Sherlock had first spoken in his ear; he watched the carriages and the velvet-clad riders pass by, and through the cries of the footmen, the ringing of hooves against cobblestones, the ceaseless tumult of the homeward crowds that jostled him, he listened and listened for that voice.
; he would put this understanding together with the sense that something was, from my point of view, amiss in our intimate relations; and so a distance would grow, made of my silence, his hurt, the loss of ease between us here, in our bed, where (law or no law, church or no church) we sanctified our love.
Setting the needle at his left forearm one day, right forearm the next, meticulous to preserve his veins:
“Mr. Holmes,” said Cyril de la Pole, sounding desperate. The Prime Minister’s secretary had spent most of his career preparing briefing papers and thus remained touchingly naïve, to the extent that he believed himself well suited to the role of skeptic. “Mr. Holmes. Surely you overstate the threat.”
Watson shrugged, but his hand remained steady on Sherlock’s arm. “You did say I crave danger, didn’t you? So, I’ll take the risk that nobody doing inventory notices one unaccounted-for suture kit and a local.” They walked on a few more paces; then: “As long as we’re being unofficial, I’m John.”
Getting Sherlock to swear is always a win. John takes his mouth off his cock to reply, “Hard as a rock, though, aren’t you,” and presses his knuckles into Sherlock’s taint, with the entirely intentional side effect of another, somewhat gentler, tug on his balls that makes him groan and throw his head back on the mattress. It wouldn’t take much more to bring him off, but suddenly John wants to feel Sherlock’s hot skin under him, wants to lick at the patch of sweat that always forms on his neck when he’s close to coming; he climbs onto the bed and crawls up Sherlock’s body to kiss him and suck at his mouth and nip at the base of his throat.
“I was fixing just when the lights went out,” Sherlock said. “Wound up losing the whole dose.” He was leaning some of his weight against the doorjamb; he thought his face was probably gray. His upper lip was wet but he resisted the urge to wipe it.
— needle up and out; tie. John Watson stepped away, discarded the remains of the suture kit, and cleared his throat.
The disguises, the feints, the sob stories, the misdirections and the plausible smiles: they were the trouble. John felt always on him the chill of
Again the black empty road shining. John realized with a start that in his waking life, weeks — but how many weeks? — had passed since he last saw the moon. Full, new, crescent: he had no idea. He watched, shifting from foot to foot; for the first time, he felt the cold, as if the year were declining even in this place where the moon didn’t change. He shivered; his teeth chattered, and the chattering became the distant sound of hooves, till once more the Wild Hunt drove toward him. The hounds bayed, their red eyes intent on the ground ahead; the flame-eyed horses shook the untouched earth, and the hooded riders turned —
So now John could clean, stitch, dress, and bandage a wound. It was not nothing — he was useful, and also the physician began to pay him more. But sometimes he sat at the window in his smallish darkish room, remembering the war — but it was good that the war was over — and the dreams that had come to him with his fevers. He began to think that the raven’s feather, the fox’s whisker, and the serpent’s scale had come to him by earthly chance, not from that other world. Nevertheless, he kept them.
“That is remarkable,” Holmes owned, after a moment. His interest was up, I saw — indeed, he was practically vibrating.
It’s difficult to believe that Sherlock sees anything different, but Sherlock has always understood John otherwise than John understands himself. When they first met, at a time when John believed that there was only a dying ember inside him, Sherlock had breathed on the ember and brought him blazing into life. John makes a hash of their friendship, of marriage, he thinks he makes a hash of fatherhood as well, but Sherlock is steadfast. Over and over he has shown that he will stop at nothing to shield that flame. Therefore John goes on.
“But you won’t find that,” Sherlock put in, “because we’re not. Here’s my card; do your worst.” He nodded toward not-Melinda, and then toward Rockham, and turned to go.
(Once, in an unguarded moment when he had just fixed, Sherlock had told Wiggins: “You do realize I’m not slumming anymore.”
There was no way reliably to die by jumping from a first-floor window, not even if he flew headfirst.
They were mortifying. On the first was a photographic portrait of her: her hair was down, and she lounged across the arms of a wing chair, en négligée. She was very lovely but the photograph might as well have been a French postcard. Worse yet was the letter attached to the second page, by comparison with which the portrait might have been that of a cloistered nun. The letter was written in Miss Winter’s hand.
. . . On exhibit were twenty-four photographs. Sherlock had seen most of them before, or rather had seen images of them, as part of his education in Rockham’s collecting habits.
Don’t start feeling sorry for the small fry, gorgeous: they’re practice and if you don’t practice hard enough, you fail. Ten thousand hours of practice to become an expert, isn’t that what they say?”
The soldier wanted to know what had happened to his friend in Iraq. The friend hadn’t been a soldier, he had been an Iraqi civilian, a translator, and they had met in Mosul; the soldier stared at the wall of Sherlock’s office and said, “And we, we —” and “I understand,” Sherlock said, it was essential to sound neutral, the soldier would be out the door like a shot (ha) if he found himself in tears —
Accidents with Superglue are unusual, but not rare, and they tend to be catastrophic; there are always research teams working on ways to reverse its effects. Triskaidekotonin itself is also the subject of intensive research, like the trial John’s thaumatologist got him enrolled in. A fair few experimental potions have gotten as far as clinical trials, and all have failed. It’s ridiculous to imagine that Sherlock Holmes, working alone, should in the space of five months have succeeded where experts,
The hounds of the Wild Hunt snarled and bayed, and the horses drove fast behind them, shaking the earth. The cloaked riders sought their prey.
Watson, that miscreant, stole a march on me: his telegram arrived before Wiggins, before breakfast, even before I had had time to absorb myself in Jean-Pierre Mégnin’s fascinating work on cadaveric entomology:
“A world of possibilities thus opens before us. Perhaps they will arm one of our more rabid racialist organizations. But with conventional weapons? Or, perhaps, with a biological weapon. Or a dirty bomb. They might mount a series of terrorist attacks purportedly by adherents of the group pleased to call itself the Islamic State, for example. Or they might facilitate a series of actual such attacks.
Two more rings and the call would go to voicemail. Sherlock swiped Answer. “Hello, Mr. Holmes,” said Andrew Rockham.
“Oh, no!” Jim put his hands up to his face, making a stretched-out, wide-eyed expression. Then he took his hands down again and smiled. “You had to give them a name,” he pointed out, pleasantly.
“And suspicions will be high on the Russian end just now,” Mycroft said. “Try not to lose anyone too valuable, will you?”
Normally the minion didn’t react to Sherlock in any way, but this morning the power was still out, so he gave a contemptuous little
What, then, if he pretended to accede? Sherlock had never been able to hold a job, never really tried, but this wasn’t quite a job; it was more in the nature of a consultancy, surely, and one well matched to Sherlock’s talents, at that.
So Watson had suborned not only the chiefest of my Irregulars but also our landlady. There was one possible means of retaliation, and that was to pre-empt his telegram. Accordingly, I sent, express,
There’s a good pub across the road, thankfully, so even if the client-provided accommodations are not all that might have been hoped for, at least John and Sherlock are adequately fed and watered. In John’s case, this is for the value of “watered” that equals “pleasantly just more than tipsy,” because whether or not Sherlock is going to ridicule him, John feels ridiculous, and by God he’s going to have some analgesia on board for whatever happens once they’re back upstairs.
It should have been fine — the loss of his magic should have been temporary, the triskaidekotonin replenishing itself over the course of a week or two. It means a holiday; even in John’s startlement, part of his attention turns to that, a few days in Sicily perhaps, somewhere with olive groves and orange trees . . . He explains the difficulty to Ms. Walthamstow, opens the door of his consulting room to see her out and tell the receptionist she needs to see one of the other doctors, that same afternoon if at all possible, and, turned toward his patient as he walks, he smacks into the rolling cart a tech is pushing down the hall.
Besides: a condition of the deal would be Jim’s supplying him with heroin. Not that heroin in itself was a problem for Sherlock — on the contrary — but getting hold of heroin was. The need to make money was a constant annoyance, taking up time and putting him at risk of arrest. But when he had heroin, he was fine. Better than fine. His thoughts calmed. Certain responses to himself that he had never been able to regard with the equanimity they deserved faded into blessed insignificance. Now, with the problem of reliable supply solved, he would be able to do — well, anything. He would revive his subscriptions to
Wiggins was weighing out powder and tipping it into glassine bags, which he held open awkwardly between the pinky and thumb of his right hand because the forefinger and middle finger had been splinted. The air in his flat smelled of antiseptic from A&E. “Ah,” Wiggins said when Sherlock let himself in, “you fuck off out of here, man.” Both Wiggins’s parents taught at Cambridge, but he liked to affect working-class authenticity around Sherlock, to emphasize that Sherlock was slumming.
A sense of painful inevitability nevertheless settles in. For, as John well knows, a person can sometimes threaten Sherlock into not talking, but nothing on this earth will ever induce him to stop thinking. And when he has reached the furthest end of his thinking, the talking will unstoppably resume.
was a post-WWI right-wing German narrative, false of course, that the German military hadn’t lost the war but had been betrayed by German civilians, specifically republicans (the lower-case kind) and Jews. Needless to say, the Nazis ate up and exploited the “stab in the back.” It's interesting to note the myth's
He doesn’t, yet, think about the other question, of what he is meant to say to Sherlock, either now or once
John puts up a hand. “No, let me — let me say this. I — First, I saw you practicing, facial expressions and so on, trying to learn, I guess, and I thought, I thought that meant you were just faking all the — the feelings that those expressions came with.
?” — superimposed, naturally, on a photograph of the animate’s contorted face. The Director of Public Prosecutions holds a press conference at which she announces that what she calls the “shocking event” will be treated as a homicide. The same day’s evening newscasts lead with video of the sculptor Andreas Coburne turning himself in.
“Very nearly ideal,” Sherlock assured the soldier; “few things have a closer connection to a person than words handwritten by him.” He looked through the book carefully for something evocative.
led me to a certain volume of literature, a particular favorite of ours. I felt sure Watson could be referring to nothing else, and while I remembered what word appeared on page 53 — appeared quite alone, owing to the poor quality of the book’s printing — I thought it best to check.
Sherlock’s hair was as black and soft as the feathers on a raven’s breast, his eyes as bright as a fox’s eyes; he was as clever as a serpent, and he was tricky (like raven, like fox, like serpent). His kisses laid a trail of fever over John’s skin and he offered himself up shameless to John’s hands and John’s prick. He pressed John to himself and fucked him slowly, and under Sherlock John whimpered. John hid his face in Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock hushed him and poured kisses over him like water. John rested against Sherlock and thought
— making Oliphant stifle a sob. His hair had been well cut, but the cut had grown out to shapelessness: “It hasn’t been long, has it,” and then “So young!,” because it wasn’t a divorce (the ring) and it wasn’t a dead pet (no hair on the clothes) and it
He was named Duane Oliphant. He was in his mid-thirties, he wore a wedding ring, his face was drawn and gray. “You have had a loss,” Sherlock said gently —
Mycroft beamed at him. “Exactly so, Mr. Hareton.” The only pleasure to be had in any council that included the Foreign Secretary was that of making him think he had said the opposite of what he meant. As what Hareton meant was usually idiotic, this had the knock-on effect of improving the quality of the discussion. “I think we can all cite many examples of colonies geographically remote from the motherland.”
He had left the prepped syringe on the kitchen table. The laptop had gone to sleep so he touched a key to wake it. In the screen’s light, the syringe cast a low ominous shadow as if in an old-fashioned anti-drug movie — except no laptops in those, of course. Sherlock held the syringe over the sink and depressed the plunger; then he lay down on the bed to wait.
“I’m so sorry,” the thaumatologist says. Her expression is kind. John thinks he can see fear in it, too, or maybe that’s just his own fear reflected back at him.
“It” proved to be a meticulously painted wooden model of the eye, made in accordance with the most recent discoveries. The usual slip of paper (“my fourth,”
Sherlock thought, approximately, that under other circumstances he would be worried about being taken by people he didn’t know to a destination he hadn’t been apprised of, but the great gift of the poppy was the sure knowledge that
“It’s a puzzle,” Sherlock explains. “For you. To give you something to do, for a few minutes at least. You see, you push the paper aside to get your food out from under it. After you’ve eaten, you can tear the paper to bits and fling it about. Or you can do that for a break between courses, if you like. It’s to stop you going mad in your cage. Although perhaps you already have. I don’t know whether I can fix that, but I’m going to try.”
In John’s last memory of Baker Street, Sherlock has taken a step backward and brought his steepled fingers to his mouth, just as he does when he is thinking. John throws the flat door open and bangs down the stairs and out; from Sherlock, he hears not another word.
When he woke up, it was already noon, and the power was back on. He was very tired. He took a cup of coffee downstairs with him when he opened the shop.
Rockham looked interrogatively at O’Malley. O’Malley scoffed. “We went through the flat with a fine-toothed comb, Mr. Rockham. Found a locker key for a health club, sure, right on the hall table where you’d expect. Nothing in the locker. And nothing under the kitchen sink, for Christ’s sake, of course we checked.” He gave Willis a shake. “Inside the loo tank, too, you little wanker, in case you were thinking of sending us there next.”
In the weeks after the discovery of the dead animate, John concludes that there’s no longer even any ambiguity. Sherlock’s bright smiles are gimcrack with the gloss peeling off; John can’t understand how even the dimmest client is fooled, and as for himself — how on earth had he fallen for such counterfeit? How had he set nothing of himself aside, why had he so recklessly given everything over, how had he not perceived the swindle?
“Well,” Rockham said, after a moment. “That’s ... reasonably astute, if it turns out to be true. And — again, if it turns out to be true — I can see why your skills might prove useful. Not easy to verify claims about the inside of her head, though, is it.”
“Poor boy,” Holmes remarked to me when we had said good night to “Roger” (for so he, excruciatingly, called himself), “he must be very new to the life of the streets if he doesn’t even know to look for custom in Piccadilly.”
More and more often the front door chimed. The clients thought, as they told Sherlock when they stepped through,
, who read this chapter, identified exactly what was wrong, and uttered magical incantations that enabled me to fix it. *Gazes at Sylve in mingled awe and gratitude*
“And as we all have learned over the past year, the Americans can no longer be trusted with our intelligence nor relied on to share theirs. Have our friends the French and the Germans anything to offer, Mr. Macdermid?”
“Sorry?” But Jim’s meaning was obvious, of course, and Sherlock should have seen this coming: he could hardly play aide-de-camp to Andrew Rockham while absenting himself at scheduled intervals to shoot up. The relief of fixing evaporated, but he managed a nod and a shrug. “Needs must.”
did you pick it for yourself. It doesn’t sound like you. It doesn’t look like you. I guess if it had a smell it would smell like you, phew, but anyhow I’m going to call you Will. Oh, and
But no matter how he struggled, sleep always came for him before the dawn; in the morning, Sherlock was always gone. And every night he seemed less substantial than the night before.
Not a day goes by that John doesn’t think he ought to leave Sherlock. On mornings when he wakes alone in their bed he turns his face into Sherlock’s pillow and tells himself to cut his losses.
“But I’m not sure he’s happy.” The tired mother shows the second-youngest, the middle, and the two oldest Sherlock’s brochure, with its color photos taken from the lovebird rescue group’s files. Lovebirds make merry in trees, on perches, on wooden ladders, in the air. Lovebirds chew sticks. Lovebirds roll balls along the aviary floor. “Look at the birds in these pictures, and look at Beakley. What do you think?”
wash through him. But when he got home he found that Sherlock had left the milk out all day to spoil.
John set the fox down on the moon-tipped grass of the roadside and looked at him. The fox rested on his haunches and looked back at John. Fox grin. The blood had vanished; the fox’s untorn flanks were smooth. John turned his hands over and over: they should have been sticky with blood, but they were as clean as the fox’s black-tipped coat. He reached down and stroked the fox along his back. Along his right side. Along his left side. The fox sat up, lifting his lip —
An hour ago they had all, even Ellis Macdermid the JIO chairman, been reluctant to believe; but now Saundra Zardari’s poker face had failed her, Walter Hareton had put his pen down and moved on to rubbing his lip, and Alastair Skeffings the Defence Secretary was staring at the table. Macdermid had tucked his chin into his chest. De la Pole looked at them, and looked at Mycroft, and then the air went out of him.
“Second question first: tonight, because this is a public event so I had a hope of approaching you without your bodyguard grinding my face into the pavement and kicking my ribs in. First question second: you, because I have researched you, and I know that you sometimes do business with persons who can’t be properly background checked. Therefore another avenue of insight would be worth a great deal to you. Even a fraction of that great deal, directed my way, equals a lot of money. I like my face, I like my ribs, and I like money. Will those answers serve?”
For an otherworldly being, Sherlock weighed a great deal. His heart beat solidly. But blood had left a trail behind him and now it began to soak John’s bed. John wrapped his thigh with a rag to stanch the wound, and considered what to do next. He had nothing but his needle and coarse thread: no proper bandages, nothing with which to ease the pain of stitching . . .
“Shit,” said Rockham, and took a moment to work out the implications. Willis was probably telling the truth when he said he didn’t know what had happened to the inventory. If he had been working for himself, he wouldn’t have diverted it on purpose: there was no percentage in pissing Andrew Rockham off. The same went if he had been working for someone else, except that the disappearance of the goods smelled like a setup: Willis was a pawn, someone had sacrificed him to get hold of two hundred thousand pounds’ worth of Sierra Leone diamonds with beautiful certificates declaring them conflict free. “All right,” Rockham said, “make sure he gets found someplace touristy. I want him to make the news, in case anybody’s out there paying attention.”
But it was not. He sat and watched until he felt the ache in his bones that meant the fever was coming on.
Sherlock thought. He let his hand drop and said: “Actually, I’m looking for a job, and I think you’ve got the job that I should fill.”
Learn a language in childhood and you can speak it without conscious thought; but it doesn’t follow that someone who carefully and awkwardly speaks a second language, learnt for the purpose of communicating in the land to which he has immigrated or been exiled, is therefore lying. “I thought I was like a pet to you,” John makes himself say. “Or, not even a pet. A toy. And then the toy got broken.”
“Yeah,” John says, and, a little taunting, “You get what you asked for”; he takes a grip of Sherlock’s balls to remind him to stay in place and brings his mouth down over his cock, down, all the way down till the head hits the back of his throat; comes back up till he’s covering just the head, dips his tongue into the slit and pushes at it; Sherlock’s hips hitch, earning his balls a yank from John’s motionless hand wrapped around them—“Bloody
“Okay,” he says again, and opens the cabinet anyway. There’s a 500ml graduated cylinder on the shelf next to his mug. Of course there is. “Why didn’t you just leave it on the table with the potion?” he asks the air. He was forever tidying up after Sherlock’s experiments, at ho—
“Electrician,” Sherlock said; then his long-overtaxed governor failed, so that what he heard himself say next was “Obviously, and not one of your direct reports but an employee of a firm whose owner you control. I take it there will be no more power outages.”
Interested, inquisitive even, though Holmes is about everything, and cunning questioner though he was, when a case called for it, it has never been his way to push or pry at me. I could have said nothing; I could have hummed, and turned my gaze aside; in a moment, he would have apologized, and the subject would never have been mentioned between us again.
One evening in March there was a late snow. Sherlock — casually, so casually — left open the door of the consulting room; from his desk, he had a line of sight to the front windows.
