That was enough to spark John into his own climax, moaning freely against Sherlock’s chest and kissing every bit of pale skin he could reach almost worshipfully, whispering his name.
She laughed “Oh Sherlock. Fine, I’ll leave you to it then. Let me know if you get hungry later, I’ll make you some casserole.” She smiled at him and closed the door behind her as she left.
“Muggleborn? No. Both my parents have magic. Ath does my horrid big brother”. He waved a hand dismissively as if that was the most natural thing in the world, to be born with a sibling and parents that were not just aware but part of the magical world. Who understood everything from the customs to the mechanics of magic and could actually perform spells and could use wands as everyday objects. John couldn’t even think of a place to start on questions he had for Sherlock.
it warmer Sherlock!” John cried for what felt like the billionth time. “You do realise I've had magic for all of 3 days and I can’t control it!”
He was just on the way to put his hand back in his pocket, courage freezing over when Sherlock suddenly took him by the wrist and pulled him towards the ice-covered lake. “Come along, John! Do you think the ice is thick enough to support our weight?” Sherlock wondered aloud.
But John just remained by his side, talking about his potions essay and moaning about not being able to go out to practice if he wanted to finish it tonight.
“That…was” John paused. Sherlock braced himself, “Absolutely brilliant!” John exclaimed. Sherlock beamed back at him instantly, feeling warm all of a sudden. “How did you know his neighbour was her lover?!”
John standing on the front steps of the buses, smiling down at Sherlock as sun rays bounced off his golden hair and lightened the deep blue of his eyes by two shades. He recalled his soft cotton shirt stretching across his expanse chest and one of his legs, poised on the step above as if ready but unwilling to turn away and leave into the depths of the bus.
Sherlock hummed in agreement, feeling himself sinking down into sleep. Before he could his warmth and the arms around him were suddenly gone, cold air in their place. He blinked sleepily, trying to figure out what had happened.
“Oh!” He quickly let go of Sherlock’s arse cheek, clearly noticing perhaps this wasn’t the most appropriate time to be doing that. Not that Sherlock particularly minded. “I’m… I’m sorry, Sherlock. I… I don’t-” he looked at Sherlock now.
In the years John had known Sherlock he had never seen him so unsure.. looking so small and afraid. The urge to comfort... what’s more.. to PROTECT rushed fiercely to John’s heart.
The boy stood straight again, his smile returning “Of courthe not!” he scoffed “I thimply obtherved. Something people often forget to.” He sniffed and pouted his lips slightly before he turned to John again, unsure “You didn’t…. think it wath weird?”
Sherlock’s heart stopped, his arm yanked out into the air, trying mindlessly to catch the boy as he fell unconscious from his broom. Sherlock watched helplessly as the Gryffindor boy fell further and further from him and closer to the ground.
There it was. Sherlock braced himself for the inevitable goodbye that would most definitely follow. Sure they’d had a nice greeting. but surely John would want to go back to his shift? Or his life, now that Sherlock was not really a part of it. He couldn’t just expect John to pick up their friendship where Sherlock had left it as if nothing had ever happened. Sure they might “catch up” sometime, but things were most certainly never going to be-
Sherlock’s eyes were wide and nervous. “Okay.. okay.. the more we move the tighter it's gonna get”. He took the clippers with his other hand and did her best to cut them free, but the dark plant limb seemed to hiss and tightened around them.
Soon enough John was gently rocking them together, holding the man he cared so much for in his arms tightly and feeling him hold him just so in return. The pace steadily picked up, no rush but after long loving moments John was snapping his hips forward onto Sherlock, burying himself deep and loving the low groans and gasps he drew from the artist, the low ‘more’s the high yesses, the breathless ‘John’s.
John was overcome by a flurry of several emotions. Joy, at having Sherlock agree to take him to the restricted section and thus providing an opportunity for them to spend more time together. Bemusement, at Sherlock’s formality and even slight detachment. And finally irrational jealousy, over his acknowledgement that he missed Gladstone. As if he hadn’t seen him several times over the years and ignored him, left him to go back to John empty of responses. How was it so easy to admit to missing an OWL but not his
Then it had to be… oh. The age difference of course. John was, as Sherlock had calculated around 25 years of age and Mary was still a freshman college student, a young one at that being only barely 18. So clearly John was not bothered by the attention of a female, he was just bothered by the age difference.
“I’ve got you”, the words were exhaled into the hollow of his collarbone. He felt John press his weight on top of him and he sighed, feeling every inch of John press against him skin to skin and reveling in it. “What do you want love?” John kissed down his chest, taking one of his peaked nipples into his mouth and sucking it gently. Sherlock cried out, surprised by the intensity of the feeling.
“12 inches, unicorn tail hair, Ash” he grinned. “I didn’t know what to expect but…” he picked up his wand. “It’s perfect.”
And perhaps Sherlock was still doubtful whether John was just pretending to have forgiven him… and perhaps John was still unsure as to whether Sherlock was just being polite. But the strongest emotion they both felt, was the happiness that even after all these years… they fell back into step with each other as if they had never been apart at all.
“Hah! You wish Holmes! But hey, I seriously have to go write that essay. But tomorrow after school. You. Me. Quidditch.” He looked at Sherlock pointedly as he stood up, potion books cradled under his arm.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest but John just shook his head “Nope. Come on”. The dragged out the biggest mattress they could find, one they usually used for their pirate games and placed in below the tree house. John then surrounded it with as many falling leaves as he could, just in case Sherlock rolled off. They climbed to the highest point, Sherlock’s heart beating loudly against his ribs.
I'll answer last chapter's comments tomorrow morning. I just needed to post this asap. Because.... reasons. Exciting reasons. You'll see ;)    I hope you enjoy this long chapter! (Seriously long. It's about 2 and a half times the size of my normal chapters- hence the long wait for it) <3<3
Thank you so much for reading!! It means a lot to me that you guys are liking this fic and leaving such sweet comments<3! They really do encourage me to write faster <3<3
He then turned towards his friend again but the fragile moment they had had shattered, although it lingered in the background, a soft promise of later.
He would… but Sherlock just couldn’t figure out how to just tell John he had been helping Irene retrieve some compromising photographs of her and Mary (incidentally John’s ex-girlfriend) from the Slytherin Sebastian Moran (who had taken them from Irene’s bag to get back at her for stealing his own...sensitive photographs with that other kid Jim Mori-something) without John asking why he was helping her so willingly. As usually there was a case or some sort of experiment behind Sherlock's reason for help, with the exception of when the one in need of help was John. And Sherlock knew that under the pressure of those damn blue eyes John had he would break and tell him the truth. That he helped Irene to stop her telling him Sherlock was being affected by… Sentiment.
“Hi, you,” he whispered. And quickly leant in to place another soft kiss on Sherlock’s parted, equally kissed-red and wet lips. “Was this… okay?”
He looked up and their eyes met. Time stopped for about a second as John tried to convince his heart to stop hammering, convinces Sherlock could feel it through his palm.
Some kids had snuck off to the back towards one of the smallest baby hippogriff and were attempting to tear off its barely forming silver feathers. John had immediately shot up and run across the field to go in defense of the harmless baby animal, stepping up in front of the kids. A single glare from a steaming John had been enough for the kids to apologize and scatter away. John had taken the small fluffy animal in his arms and brought him back to its enraged mother who Hagrid was trying desperately to tame. The fearless look in John’s eye as he approached the mother with the happy squawking baby in his arms had taken Sherlock’s breath away and he watched, heart pounding, as the elder hippogriff calmed, took in John’s approaching figure, accepted the stolen baby and bowed so low its beak touched the floor in reverence to one brave John Watson.
The Gryffindor watched him walk away, smiling softly to himself, the sneering of the Slytherin team seeming muted and far away. He looked back towards his team and caught Greg’s eye, who smiled and motioned with his head towards Sherlock’s retreating figure and looked back to his Captain, smiling knowingly. “You guys…. got something going on?”.
He began playing. Slow soft notes resounded through the small living room, reverberating in Sherlock’s chest and heartbeat. He didn’t play a song he knew by heart. He played notes as he felt them, sweet and tingling across the space between himself and John Watson. He thought about John. About the pink colour of his lips, the blue of his eyes, the tanned gold of his skin. He thought about his hands, the rough callouses on his fingers and how they might feel against the skin of his neck. He thought about how they had run across the streets side by side and it had felt completely natural. As if they had been doing it their entire lives. He thought about how John had looked at him when Sherlock had deduced the killer to an inch of his life, the widened mouth in an awestruck smile. But above all, he thought about John’s laugh. Above
John laughed “True. Nice reference, by the way. And you said you wouldn’t like muggle movies and they were a waste of time”. He laid down beside him, both of them staring at the ceiling.
John hummed at Molly’s answer “Just curious”, he shrugged. He still couldn’t place the memory... but he’d definitely heard that name somewhere.
of his student in the class had passed the course, a first for him, and most of them had actually managed to receive rather high grades. Eventually, they had to leave the students to mingle around, as Sherlock had to give out the usual interviews and pose for photographs.
The next thing he knew, he had been carrying a half-conscious complaining second year Ravenclaw to the hospital wing part-concerned and part-amused as the poor boy mumbled deductions about John’s shoes. They had been inseparable since.
“Hey” he smiled hesitantly “You alright?”, he glanced at Dimmock, who was just now realizing that Sherlock had not heard a single word he had said and was huffing in frustration and turning around to leave with a loud “Whatever, freak!”.
John shushed him gently with a longer graze of their lips, capturing Sherlock’s sweet mouth and working it gently with his own until Sherlock was soothed once more.
John was staring at him wide eyed, mouth gaping open and eyebrows completely risen. His pose, however, had not changed a bit. Sherlock quickly surveyed his body, stance and expression.
“It's only logical, John. Besides. You wanted him the moment you saw him” he nodded towards the small bird, who was currently inspecting the outside of the shop and his surroundings with avid curiosity.
Sherlock stretched over to see what it was, and as soon as he caught sight of the red mark he flew out of his chair, almost dropping it and falling over himself in the process. John just sat there, heart thumping almost painfully in his chest, nerves tingling all over his body. He remembered seeing that red seal in an envelope held by his sister all those years ago.
Sherlock tried not to look but his eyes shifted to his left where he could see slivers of John’s skin through the thin gaps between the wooden plates of the screen. ‘
John stopped in his tracks as he heard the angry shout in the corridors. It wasn’t a voice he recognised but there was no doubt in him that it meant trouble. And if the little nudge in his gut was anything to go by… he knew exactly who ‘trouble’ was currently picking on.
The memory of it was suddenly vivid in Sherlock’s mind. He had done his best not to stare or pay attention to it. After all, by teaching figure drawing Sherlock saw naked bodies every week. As many female bodies and male. It wasn’t like himself to get in any way moved or aroused by them. This had never happened before and yet…
“Sherlock! Oh shit! Are you okay?!” John sat up, rubbing his hip and wincing but looking at Sherlock with concern.
Danger. Maybe that was what Sherlock’s heart was trying so desperately to communicate to him. Sherlock tried to figure out why. It was definitely the thrill of a correct deduction. But it was so much more than that… John’s smile and numerous praises had burst small bubbles of elation inside Sherlock. He wanted to see that smile again. He never wanted to see John not smiling. Or limping again. Sherlock stood there watching the bus retreat in the far distance swallowing hard, and not knowing what to do with all these emotions or how to make sense of them. But there
He lowered himself onto the bed, pulling John on top of himself until they were pressed skin to skin, still immersed in their kisses. Sherlock moaned freely when John’s lips slowly roamed down to his neck and chest and finally attached themselves onto one of his peaked dusty pink nipples. He tangled his fingers in the golden strands of John’s hair and pulled teasingly, as John nibbled gently on the pebbled pink skin. “John” he breathed.
John frowned, “just because you don’t get hungry it doesn’t mean your body doesn’t need it. Come on, you’re heaving breakfast with me tomorrow”. Sherlock froze as he turned the page on his book, but tried to play it off as he cleared his throat and kept reading in feigned fascination. “A-alright”, he agreed softly.
John started walking towards the door, followed closely by Sherlock.“Wait!” John stopped short, so abruptly in front of a startled Sherlock that almost ran into his back. “Have you had breakfast?” he asked seriously.
John finally rose himself onto his elbows and crawled back up Sherlock’s body, peppering him with kisses and soothing words all the way up until he could kiss him, Sherlock’s legs instinctively wrapped around his waist and he tipped his body up offering himself fully to the model.
John was so glad for the cold weather for a moment, as it masked his full body shiver when Sherlock reached for both of his hands and began to skate backwards, pulling John with him. “That’s pretty good, one foot after another, but bend your knees a little bit to balance the weight. Since we don’t have normal skates you have to keep your feet perfectly flat when you bear down, or they’ll wobble.” He turned, John following hips tilting as he bent his body to follow Sherlock’s swerving movements.
“Hmm,” Trevor hummed. “So... you painted all of these in the room correct?” he looked around, seeming mildly interested.
At nightfall, they went back to the store. The company of this new boy seeming so natural. So familiar, it was kind of bizarre to think they’d only met earlier that afternoon.
“However by observing the wounds on the woman’s body, I deduced that they had been inflicted by someone extremely strong but inexperienced in body combat. The only thing the attacker had had for leverage on her had been his body mass. So, the only person that fit the profile and had a motive was her lover, the next door neighbour.”
Somehow he unknowingly closed the foot of distance apart and he and Sherlock were much much closer than he’d anticipated. Sherlock looked up from the ground and met his eyes, also seeming shocked at how close together they had somehow ended up “I’ll see you… soon then” he murmured, not knowing what else to say but wanting to believe his words were true.
As he walked away John also turned to watch him leave, as if unable to be satisfied until this man is completely out of their sights. Victor’s head was turned, shamelessly staring lustfully after Sherlock’s back and arse.
“No, I’ve never taught in this classroom." he replied "I used to study in this university. I had my painting classes here” he smiled wistfully at the memory, looking around the room at the scattered easels and canvases on the almost pristine wooden floors and clearly reliving all his memories of this place.
Epilogue will be posted late next week <3!! Thank you so much for reading, commenting and leaving kudos <3<3!!!!!!
They had met during their second school year. John had, of course, seen Sherlock since their first year when he had been called for sorting. He had stepped up the stage and announced loudly he would be in Ravenclaw without even putting the hat on, to which McGonagall had started to protest but the hat had silenced her immediately by saying “He’s right”, a shrug apparent in his tone of voice.
Sherlock looked up at him, sadly. “I wanted to… But your letter’s had stopped and I was afraid that.. that you really HAD forgotten about me”.
Sherlock sighed as ticked the boxes next to both their names. He looked around as everyone finished up setting up for the day and then glanced at his watch. 6:58. Any minute now. He took a swig from his cup of coffee and relished in the relative silence of the class before the day began and the students built up their energy for the day.
John stopped to listen, feeling suddenly trapped and unable to move. He wanted to leave… but curiosity took the better of him. It seemed like they were in the middle of an argument, Eliza’s voice came now and then but the prominent one was Sheringford, angrily whispering and hissing. He took a couple of steps forwards trying to make out whatever he was saying.
Sherlock tuned off the voice of the interviewer, knowing the questions he would ask and having the answers prepared in the tip of his tongue as he focused more on the people around. In the distance Sherlock saw his brother, who he reluctantly admitted to himself was at least a little pleased to see. And at the very back he spotted Irene and Kate.
He blinked a couple of times and felt the sharp sting of dryness. He really should put little reminders in his mind palace to blink once in awhile when he got lost in there, he thought. He looked back at the woman in the painting one last time just to check it had not magically figured itself out while he was relaxing. Nope. Same mint green jumper. Same inky black hair down to her waist. The military tags around her neck were still engraved with the name of her deceased brother, the slight rust on the edges betraying her often clutch of it to relieve her anxiousness and grief. The eyes and mouth, however, said nothing. He frowned at them, willing them to betray her distrust in every other family member and their disrespect for her sexual orientation and her choice of career. Sherlock had caught a glimpse of her only for a moment when he had been walking down the street to buy some cigarettes but the single glimpse of the fast walking woman and the quarter of a second eye contact were enough to send Sherlock flying back to his studio and sketchbook. Something was missing from his painting, though. Although it was a fascinating subject, it still did not do enough to fill Sherlock’s mind.
“And what do you need me there for?” John asked, still puzzled. But Sherlock could see a glimmer of delight glinting behind his ocean blue eyes. There was no doubt that he was at least intrigued by the thought of sneaking in somewhere after hours when they were already supposed to be in their own dormitories... and every passing second would make it harder for them to sneak past Filch and Peeves. Not to mention, the later it was… the larger the punishment would be if they were caught. John looked like he’d just been
John’s gaze flickered over Sherlock one last time as he realised they hadn’t said anything in about a minute and the bus driver had coughed politely to get John’s attention at least twice. John tore his gaze away from the raven haired professor and cleared his throat, opening his mouth to say something but the door began to close in front of him and instead he only exclaimed “See you next week then?” and Sherlock, still seeming pretty stunned just nodded.
At this point they had been dating for about 5 months and living together 3 of those. John had kept modelling for Sherlock both in and out of school, less in school now that the students knew about them and neither wanted to be accidentally caught in any sort of compromising position again. The transition into living together had been quite simple, they just… fit. And with every passing day John was more and more sure about one thing…
Why would he even be thinking about him? That made no sense whatsoever. So what if he had a socially deemed “good” body? That did not mean that Sherlock had to be attracted to him, he thought. Sherlock’s hands, however, were now caressing his chest, inching down slowly. But no, the fact that John was attractive most certainly did not mean that Sherlock would in any way be affected by the way he talked, smiled or moved his body effortlessly. And… Sherlock licked his lips, trying his best not to go down that path… so what if John’s cock was… significantly above average in size? That made absolutely no difference whatsoever.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It’s... it’s all fine”. He refused to acknowledge how choked out his voice sounded when he spoke and started to walk away again. Even just the sight of Sherlock was making his guy churn with so many emotions he didn’t even know where or how to start sorting them out.
But just as John was building himself up to say something, anything really, Sherlock tugged and they were running again towards the door under the vines. The Beauxbatons tugged it open and they were out of the room, running in the darkened stone hallways away from Filch as fast as they could manage, holding on tight.
Sherlock looked up, raising his head from John’s chest to meet his eyes. If anything, just the fact that he was holding John in his arms right now was, to him, ultimate proof that anything could get better. That his eternal belief in his fate for loneliness was wrong and if something as wonderful as John could happen to him… great things could happen to anyone. And John of all people deserved only good things.
“John!” Sherlock giggled, his hands rose up to the blonde's nape and pulled him down, urging their mouths to lock again, grinning. The other man just laughed smugly, their kiss more of a pressing of giddy grins but neither caring too much. Sherlock ground himself as best as he could against John, delighted to feel an answering bulge just beneath the single layer of clothing.
“Take a seat, mate,” Greg said, motioning towards the empty space on the bench across from them with a smile.
“Okay,” Sherlock said quickly. He hadn’t meant to be so abrupt but he couldn’t pass up the chance. He had actually been considering staying for the winter break anyway… wanting to stay in Hogwarts for as long as he possibly could before the Beauxbatons castle was inevitably rid of the infestation of spiders. He wasn’t looking forwards to going back there. And a full month here… with John. How could anyone, WHY would anyone pass up on that opportunity?
The fell into comfortable silence, John joined their fingers, linking them together as they both looked up into the night sky.
But now I feel so motivated to give these two the loving ending they deserve. As far as I'm concerned Johnlock is canon. They're in love, and we know it. And if the show won't- WE can give them the ending they deserve <3<3
John took Sherlock to the room of requirement, which he found in his second year at Hogwarts when he’d been home sick (Sherlock’s house was home, right?) and had somehow found a room with a working TV and a collection of his favourite movies. How these items even worked was a mystery. Electricity and technology, in general, went haywire when in Hogwarts. It was something about there being too much magical energy. But within this room… everything worked. Well, it did glitch every few minutes, but it worked pretty well aside from that.
I will be taking out the spaces later on today-- but I just couldnt wait to post the chapter any longer <3<3
Sherlock sighed, draping his arm across John’s chest and holding him close. “Goodnight, John”, he said softly and let sleep drift him off away in his now-lover’s arms.
“I’m fine” John assured him. “They’re just ghost pains now. I’ve had them before... not my first fall in a match I’m ashamed to admit”. He tried to laugh but stopped mid-way with a grimace. “So…How bad was it?”
John bit his lip and nodded slowly, feeling a little out of place. He didn’t know that. He wasn’t even sure if the wands made the magic or the wizards and witches did. He was sure the boy in front of him knew exactly what Quidditch was and suddenly, he felt utterly lost.
He took a deep breath and resumed talking, just as quickly. “This of course for the wife to sneak into the hotel after the lover left, sneak in poison into her husband’s drink and then after he had collapsed left a staged set where it would look like her husband had killed himself. The police are then, of course, befuddled and pay far less attention to the crime scene and more to the tapes. Thus, completely miss the evidence that ruled out suicide completely and incriminated her instead. There. Solved it.”
Countless of “It’s not what it looks like” and “We can explain” resounded from all of them, until a horrified Sherlock raised his hand for silence and asked directly “What’s going on?”
Sherlock could not help the shy smile that pulled at his lips “You really think so?”. He wished he didn’t sound so insecure but he rarely had people critique his work. Ever. He knew he was good. The scholarship, the approving looks of his professors, the jealous stares of his peers and Mrs Hudson’s praises were enough evidence to come to that conclusion, but that was nothing like the way John was looking at him now. Like Sherlock had magically conjured some amazing spectacle all by himself.
Rounding the table to come stand next to the professor John leant over the desk to be able to see his drawing better. Sherlock tensed as he could faintly feel John’s body heat emanating from beneath the single layer of fabric draped over his naked body onto Sherlock’s side. He expelled a nervous breath as John peered even closer to the drawing. Biting his lip and suddenly doubting his artistic ability entirely beneath the deep blue eyes of John Watson.
“Hey you!” John turned to Sherlock and laid a sloppy wet kiss on the side of the rapidly blushing Beauxbaton’s neck.
Sherlock had booked him for this class, a little nervous as to whether John would be okay with that but convincing himself to book him anyway. The blonde sure seemed okay to be here class again, all smug eyes and dazzling grins. He walked over to the changing screen and the professor instantly looked down to his paper, heart beating fast.
Sherlock had slowly gone from smug to frustrated with every passing goal. And John increasingly amused, as had Sherlock, really, but he was determined not to show it.
John’s hand instantly lowered to cover it, squeezing possessively and glaring at Victor as he finally disappeared behind a corner. Sherlock yelped in part surprise and part giddiness as John’s hand squeezed, feeling so absolutely dazed by the over show of dominance on John’s part. It made his blood boil hot for an entirely new reason. Much more interesting reason. His John. Jealous over him.
Sally looked at him, mouth slightly agape and Sherlock froze, afraid he’s somehow let the secret out, accidentally confessed to being shagged by the model into the mattress repeatedly.
“Simple?” John’s eyebrows rose. He looked away from Sherlock’s walking figure and onto the back wall to avoid turning his head and moving from his pose. “Well, you must be pretty smart then," he smiled.
“It’s fine but” he chuckled “Your shirt is covered in green and blue paint ha hah” he tucked his head beside John’s neck, muffling his giggles and on a brave whim started peppering wet kisses on the golden skin.
Sherlock came first, long and hard clutching John so tightly he was sure he would leave bruises but John didn’t seem to care. He felt the pleasure build from deep within his groin and erupt feverishly. He saw white beneath his eyelids as he tensed, leaving him shattered in the consuming aftershocks.  John followed not much later with a groan, shivering as Sherlock’s body had tensed around him and made everything so much tighter, so much more real.
John climbed onto the platform, already knowing where to place the lights and turning them on before Sherlock turned off the main ones in the room. He fiddled with the belt of his robe, making sure to catch Sherlock’s eye before he slipped it off his body. Sherlock gulped audibly, trying his best not to stare at the model's body too blatantly. Obviously, he HAD to watch him as to be able to choose the best pose for the first hour but... he would have to make sure he remained calm and collected.
John had quickly hidden behind the care of magical creatures bookshelf, curious as to what Irene wanted and what Sherlock would do in the face of this clearly romantic approach. He had wondered about his best friend’s sexuality more often than a supposedly straight guy should, but John didn’t like to dwell much upon that. Even if Sherlock were...not straight... John was sure he most certainly wouldn’t be interested in him. John was shorter than the average 16-year-old. He was, although well built, still soft and he hated to admit it… rather cuddly. Sherlock, on the other hand, was the very definition of beauty and grace. With his sharp cheekbones, rosebud of a mouth and those clear gray eyes that changed color with the sunlight and his endless legs and...
“Mate, I’ve known you were head over heels for this guy since the first time you told me about him.”
Reaching for his hand John led them away from Zonko’s joke shop and off the main road and towards a place he hadn’t been in quite a while.
An idea then popped into his mind, “Could I try?” he whispered into Sherlock’s mouth in between heated kisses. “Could I try to draw you?”
The utter confusion in John’s face faded into surprised realization before melting into pained understanding. “Oh...” he gasped “Oh.. Sherlock.”
Gladstone flapped his wings in what seemed to be a shrug and took the letter with him, back into the night, where Sherlock waited in front of his own bedroom window, anxiously.
“Oh god yes” he panted, turning to take John’s earlobe between his teeth and tugging. He instantly started unbuttoning John’s shirt with shaking clumsy fingers as fast as he could.
Sherlock nodded slowly, his chin rubbing gently against John’s short soft hair. “Okay... okay. Thank you”
The model greeted her, grinning as the rest of the class agreed and welcomed him enthusiastically.Sherlock smiled, the fact that his class liked John and hadn’t even questioned having him here again making him sigh in relief. He caught Molly’s eye, she was smiling straight at him. Sherlock frowned, confused but made nothing of it and gave her a bemused smile back.
“Finish it fast. If you don’t practice you won’t stand a chance against me, John.” John gasped dramatically and nudged Sherlock’s shoulder teasingly, Sherlock felt his cheeks heat. Maybe the school’s heating problem also affected the library? Why else would he be so susceptible to blushing so frequently nowadays?
“I’m perfectly fine” he snapped, pulling away from the model. If there was one thing he couldn’t handle was John calling him ‘love’ when he was obviously not so. When they were having sex he could handle it, knowing John was obviously just experiencing attachment due to the physical connection and the release of hormones but
“I knew it!” John cried joyously and proceeded to tickle Sherlock on the ribs as best as he could with his glove-covered hands.  Sherlock squirmed and squirmed under him, squealing with a higher pitched laugh than John thought Sherlock could have. He tried to bat John away between giggles but to no avail. John tore off his gloves and just poked and prodded at Sherlock’s sides and armpits and neck.
Sherlock wondered to himself, frowning. John had no reason to contact him, even after the cane incident. He would probably just forget about everything by next week.
John reached into the large box of… jelly beans? And took one out before popping it into his mouth. “No, wait!” Sherlock exclaimed just as John started chewing.
“John…” Sherlock whispered. He stared at him, silently asking, begging for a kiss without the courage of asking for one. He licked his lips, his breath hitching as he watched John observe the path of his tongue across his bottom pouting lip and bite his own in response.
But then again, maybe the best part of the night had been reaching for books behind Sherlock, purposefully pushing his chest against him, or brushing their hips or arms or whatever limbs were closer together in an intimate caress. Everything in the darkness was heightened to the point where even a tiny shared look, stolen as they both lost their focus on the actual words on the papers and grew more focused on each other, felt loud and immense in the still unbroken quiet of the night.
John tried to take a step back but stumbled upon one of the many small tables Sherlock had lying around with paint palettes and paintbrushes. John staggered back, pulling Sherlock with him and they fell in one tangled heap onto the ground, clutching each other in surprise.
That startled John into a laugh. The tension broke completely as John’s entire body shook with laughter. Sherlock giggled back, not sure if he’s glad for the rupture of the fragile tension they'd been enveloped in or not.
“As much as I’d love to sleep... we have to clean up. ‘Less you want to wake up all sticky and uh…” John furrowed his brow trying to find a proper way to say it.
“Of course. My flat is larger and closer to the school, and you clearly disliked your flat to a certain level judging by the slight scrunch of your nose and stutter in step every time we walk into it and the soft frustrated sighs whenever the hot water malfunctions, yet again. The creases in your shirts are also telltale; ready to pack for whenever you’re staying over. You dislike staying at your own place” he shrugged.
“Oh uh… yeah” John shrugged. He took a seat next to his friend and tried not to seem distracted or disappointed as he started loading pancakes and scrambled eggs onto his plate.
“Sherlock” he whispered “Sher-”  he observed the painting closely, blinking slowly as if trying to assimilate, to understand.
Soon enough, it was just him and John in the room, Sherlock facing away from him as he heard John hobble behind the changing screen and begin changing. A couple minutes passed and Sherlock was now definitely pushing it, placing one pencil at a time carefully onto the zipper in his bag.
He’d slid out of bed and slipping on his boxer briefs he padded down to Sherlock’s studio, the only source of light in the dark apartment. Squinting against the brightness he had peered into the room. Sherlock had been sitting in front of his newest painting, staring at it intently. It wasn’t the kind of stare that betrayed the artist’s loss at how to continue, how to convey what he most wanted his painting to. It was a dazed stare. The new painting of John was of the day he had moved into 221b, after he had carried all his bags up the long flight of stairs and had collapsed on the couch, shirt open and panting. Now that John recalled it, Sherlock had stared at him for long moments that day, memorizing John’s figure splayed on his couch.
John quirked his head bemusedly “Me? I’m a struggling ex-army doctor with a limp” he huffed a humourless laugh.
“Keeps poking his massive nose in my business. Since my father left us he took it upon himself to be my “guardian”. He’s bloody awful at it too.”
Though.. now that they had grown up and now that John was allowed to feel more than just platonic feelings towards his Beauxbatons friend…. He definitely could appreciate the view when Sherlock bent to look at some of the fake wands in the bottom shelf. He appreciated it even
Sherlock just hummed and ducked to kiss John, not bothering with pleasantries and dipping his tongue into John’s mouth delicately. John didn’t hesitate, he wrapped Sherlock up in his arms and opened his mouth for Sherlock’s gently explorations, lowering his hands to the small of Sherlock’s back and easing them ever so slowly down and down.
“MUMMY. NO.” The panic rose to dangerous levels in his voice and John just laughed, stood up from his chair, snatched the phone from Sherlock’s hand and clicked off speaker so Sherlock couldn’t interrupt in indignation. Sherlock did his best anyway.
“JOHN” Sherlock barked. Of all things for John to focus on, that was NOT one he needed to explain right this moment.
Sherlock was sitting on the Ravenclaw stands reading a book, cradling it with his long pale fingers. Just as John peered at him from the distance Sherlock looked up from the pages and their eyes met for a split second before the Beauxbatons looked back down as fast as possible. John could just distinguish a slight pink tint on his face.
Instead of acting offended, however, John just chuckled and stood up onto the platform “Aye aye!” he said cheerily, untying his robe and letting it fall to the ground. He shifted a couple of times, testing out poses before he picked one where he was leaning onto his more stable leg, bending one arm behind his band as if in an armlock and twisting the other one upwards into his hair.
“More than okay, but it’s so early. Why don’t you come back here with me?” he opened his arms, still not opening his eyes.
“Oh god.. yes. Yes, please J-John I.. I” he couldn’t finish his thought before john was licking a broad stripe against his puckering entrance enthusiastically. They both groaned in unison, the reverberations from John’s throat to his mouth and into Sherlock’s body prompting the latter to gasp even more harshly.
He saw the boy look at him closely, eyes shifting and taking everything in before exclaiming “Oh! You’re muggle born!”
“Oh right. That guy. Isn’t that him over there?” he pointed somewhere into the mob of curious people that were trying to get the gossip on what had happened inside the innocent looking hotel. Sherlock’s eyes instantly followed to where the DI was pointing and finally… there was John. He seemed to still be in the process of spotting Sherlock himself, looking a little lost before he rose his cell phone up and started typing something on in.
“No..” he murmurs, truthfully. After everything that had happened Sherlock had absolutely no idea how John could’ve forgiven him so easily. How he would’ve put his safety in harm's way just for him! Why would anyone do that? And it wasn’t the first time he’d done it either! John had saved him from Anderson just a couple of months ago!
John stirred, Sherlock didn’t stop sketching but slowed, watching John’s eyes drowsily blink open and look confused for a couple of moments before they caught sight of Sherlock. “Hello, you” he slurred out, voice slow with sleep but coated with honey.
“Sorry! Sorry!” John babbled, trying to dry the front of the Beauxbatons uniform with a couple of spells, though his smug grin kind of ruined the effect.
He turned to watch his friend work. His wild curls fanned over his face as he crouched over the biggest padlock on the heavy chains. His lips moved swiftly, murmuring incantation after incantation. John licked his own lips, watching him raptly. Feeling bold, he came close to his friend, not exactly pressing himself onto him but definitely much closer than necessary. Close enough to feel his friend's body warmth radiate into him.
The painting of the woman, now completely finished, hung beside him on the wall next to his collection of paintings for his upcoming solo gallery. It wasn’t an enormous event but it
She sniffed, wiping her eyes quickly and raising herself to her usual height. “So dear, are you boys hungry? I made lunch a while ago but I’m sure it’s still warm.”
“Mr.Holmes, could you come to the front of the class?” He smiled encouraging, clearly purposely ignoring John’s insults and pretending he’d heard nothing.
But something was lingering in the back of his mind “But… Why?” he whispered in awe under his breath. How could someone as gorgeous as Sherlock want to paint someone as broken as himself?
Clearing his throat to dismiss the thought, Sherlock stood from his seat and started circling the room.
Sherlock refused to stop trying. As soon as one experiment proved fruitless he would just scribble out the option on his list and move on to the next. But as the days passed the list became shorter and shorter. John determination to have Sherlock’s magic spark was if anything, becoming more rapacious.
He leafed through his drawings from last night. Some he remembered drawing. Most… he didn’t. The majority of them were detailed renderings of parts of John’s body whilst only a few showed him in full view. Even with the colossal amount of drawings he had already made, instantly Sherlock felt the itch to make more. The thought surprised him. Even when he had interesting subjects the most he ever did was dedicate them a few drawings, a painting even, if they were lucky. But once an idea was through he never revisited a subject. The only time that had ever happened was with his mother, but sentiment was a clear factor in that; why should he want to draw… better not think about it. He felt oddly calm. The buzzing that was constantly in his head dulled to a soothed buzz after drawing last night.
From the back of the room Molly and Mike, who had been listening to the entire conversation looked at each other and conspiratorially, grinned.
Thy were walking down the road towards the bus stop, the late sun afternoon was reflecting from John’s golden hair in a series of glinting colours Sherlock was trying his best to memorize to exact detail so he could later immortalize in a painting.
He smiled. Thinking about how familiar this all seemed now, 2 years later. He closed his eyes, listening to Sherlock murmur something about an experiment next to him and thought about that very first summer
Sherlock had looked away first, feeling his entire body heating up faster than he thought was even possible. And when he’d looked back John had been gazing into the lake, a small smug smile on his face. The Beauxbatons had been sure John had known Sherlock was staring at him but for some reason… he’d let him look.
Sherlock kept looking at him, watching emotion after emotion flash across his eyes. But now… it was almost as if there was some joy in there too….
.  Eliza looked shocked herself. She took her husband by the arm and tried to pull him towards her. “Darling. Please…”
“That took you quite a while mate” Greg grinned. John rolled his eyes and they both took off to the sound of the whistle blowing, signaling the start of the match.
They gathered all the spicy ingredients they could find from Eliza’s cupboard as well as the potion ingredients she kept hidden under the kitchen sink and behind some pots and bowls. “Are you sure these are safe to eat Sherlock?” John had asked bemusedly, reading the labels with slight concern.
Sherlock whimpered nails digging into John’s back, needing something to ground him, needing John to ground him. Soft little groans escaped him as he felt the weight of John’s cock dragging wetly against his hip, panting against Sherlock’s neck. “Sher-” the blonde purred.
“No,” Sherlock murmured. It must’ve been John’s reflection on the crystal. Why would he see John in his future, anyway? “You?” he asked.
“Well, that was the easiest part” Sherlock scoffed, and began his series of deductions. Starting with one case only led to him telling John about another and then another and on and on. The hours passed as Sherlock regaled stories of some of his various cases to an astounded John and a speechless class. He always started by describing the crime scene as he had found it, silently challenging John to think about what had happened for himself, surprisingly John’s comments were oddly insightful about the cases. Even when they were wrong (most of the time) they managed to make Sherlock think back to the cases and wonder if he would have come to the correct conclusion faster if someone had made those comments to him then.
“We..” John started, grinning shyly and looking down at their joined hands in the center of the table. “We’re… together right? Like… Boyfriends?”
At last, Sherringford turned towards Eliza and stormed out of the room. Eliza looked at both boys in worry and apology before following him out of the room. The door closed behind them with a soft click.
Slughorn was completely paralyzed as John leaned in close to check for Sherlock’s soft and steady breathing and took his pulse by the wrist.
“That’s bollocks!” exclaimed Dimmock “How could you possibly know he was having affairs? That he didn’t overdose on pills?”
“Oh my goodness Sherlock! You made so much progress! This new painting is amazing!” she suddenly gushed, walking rapidly over to the painting of John getting into the bus. “This one is so different than the others… all your paintings feel alive but this one. This one is something else” She came closer, examining it from all angles and distances. “It’s wonderful Sherlock. What a handsome man, isn’t he?”, she smiled.
“Broken arm. 3 broken ribs. Concussion. I’m afraid that whilst I did stop the fall I might’ve smashed us both into the bottom of the Ravenclaw post…” Sherlock said with a weak smile.
“Mmmmno,” the other man mumbled. His voice was muffled against what he was pretty certain was the very center of a warm naked chest. Wisps of air he processed as quiet laughter blew against his hair, lightly ruffling its wild strands.
“Oh… my… God” John face split into a grin, his hand unclenching from his tight grip around the struggling Snitch. It rolled from his palm and fluttered delicately around John, and into the air above them. Both boys too distracted in grinning to notice it drift into the air, and above.
“Well, you know... always in the office but happy overall. She certainly knows how to keep me happy anyway” she winked, laughing. A couple of the students laughed with her. Kate, Irene’s girlfriend, used to be a figure model as well until she decided she wanted to pursue a career in law, instead.
He barely heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath before he blindingly closed the distance between them and pressed his lips against Sherlock’s and they were kissing fiercely. John’s heart was bursting. He didn’t know how to feel. On one hand, he felt furious for the way Sherrinford had continued to treat his family all those years, it was
John giggled “I’m really excited to meet her, I know how important she is to you.” He pressed his cheek against the artist’s nape, the later feeling the warm exhalation of breath trickle down beneath the thin silk of his dressing gown. “I just can’t believe I didn’t know about bumble-bee” John giggled, tickling Sherlock’s sides softly.
Sherlock tried to stop the words from sputtering out but the potion was making him dizzy, the enchanting and wonderful smells kept drawing him in for another whiff. He couldn’t breathe clean air, couldn’t think straight. All he could think of was…
Not that he hadn’t wanted to, of course. In that moment John had not been able to think about anything other than pushing Sherlock against a wall and claiming his mouth for hours and hours on end. But Sherlock… had not kissed back. Truthfully John had only started kissing him but he had felt the suddenness of the tension in Sherlock’s body. Almost as if he had never been kissed before. And John had just thrown himself at him without any kind of permission on Sherlock’s part. John. His model. How inappropriate! He groaned, trying his best to remember the breathing pattern to slow down his heart rate.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, one of the hands clutching at John’s jacket loosened and came up to cup John’s face. He opened his eyes and looked at his friend, his best friend whom he had just
The artist grinned, flushing deeply at the compliment “Something like that... But real life is much harder than school. And making my name as an artist... well. It’s taking its time.”
As soon as the students began to leave Sherlock expected John to do so as well, as the models usually did, scamper off as quickly as he possibly could to change into his normal clothes and stalk out of the room without a word to Sherlock. John, however, only sank into the chair Sherlock had set out for the second half of the day and massaged his shoulder whilst he sighed in relief at being able to relax his muscles properly for the first time in hours and scrolled through his phone while everyone else vacated the room.
“So you’re telling me… there are 200 different types of unicorn hair but only 3 are good for wand power?”
“No no. Even without the wound, it was plain to see. I knew from the moment you walked into class. Obvious really. From the manner in which you hold yourself, from the difference in tan in your face and arms onto where the skin shifted in the neckline, plus the psychosomatic limp”
“How did you-? Nevermind. What do you mean it’s not her? I’ve seen you around her all the time lately”
John grinned as the Gryffindor team all rushed towards him and surrounded him in an inescapable and overly enthusiastic hug. The captain laughed, the euphoria of winning to Slytherin effortlessly meant he would be in the final match against Ravenclaw. But above all..
After a couple of moments, Sherlock suddenly said: “I met a gentleman with psychosomatic pain in his arm a couple years ago.”
Lestrade looked confused by Sherlock’s request but nodded, turning to motion the other policemen taking samples off to give both Sherlock and John some room to work in.
“Well, class today we’re going to observe the effects of a very common but highly potent potion. Can anyone tell me what potion created powerful effects on infatuation or obsession on the drinker?”
John stayed glued to his chair. Every nerve in his body begged him to go after Sherlock. To say… something, anything. But he couldn’t move. “Eliza… I… How?”
John giggled, stopping in place and turning to Sherlock. He looked up at him, pride shining in his eyes at having people finally recognizing how tremendously talented the man before him was. And this was just the start of it. He could see Sherlock’s career stretched before them. The galleries and event he’d get to have. The people they’d get to meet. He was so overjoyed at how Sherlock’s hard work was paying off, how even if the artist denied it he LOVED being here, in his first solo gallery. How in this moment, he loved being Sherlock Holmes.
“I wonder,” Trevor said “If perhaps you could paint me sometime. I could… pose for you for hours. I’m sure you’d do a splendorous job” he started walking slowly around the room, Sherlock forced to follow, swallowing down his perplexed replies but Trevor just continued talking.
He forced the most natural smiles he could to the reporters and answered some of their predictable and boring questions, tuning out most of his own answer and answering automatically. It wasn’t as if he hated the gallery, he was in fact quite excited to show his work to the public and the turn-out had been rather good. But he disliked the overwhelming amount of attention, the inane questions and the necessary interaction with people, the necessity to be… liked.
“BECAUSE JOHN DOESN’T LOVE ME!” Sherlock exclaimed throwing his arms in the air. He looked around but no one had done anything more than spare him a sideways glance. Sherlock sighed. “He doesn’t love me. And he’s my best friend. If I told him how I feel- How I’ve always felt and he didn’t feel the same…he’d leave me. I’d be all alone again”.
He shot up swiftly into the sky, momentarily forgetting everything around him as the air caressed his blond hair familiarly and he basked in the smooth feel of his Firebolts’ take-off. But as soon he blew the whistle and practice started he kept losing his focus, aware of Sherlock slim figure sitting in the stands with an open potions book in his lap, and Irene sitting at his side with her legs crossed while he whispered furiously towards his book clearly talking to her indirectly.
manage to make Sherlock jump, yelp or even fall backwards and topple off a chair in one occasion but alas, no magic burst out of him.
Sherlock closed his sketchbook abruptly and turned toward the other side of the room. His eyes were instantly met by the woman’s eyes. She smirked at him. “Stop it,” he told her, turning away.
“SO! What do we have here, my dears?” Trelawney asked, clutching both hands together and peering excitedly at Sherlock’s and John’s crystals globes. “Have we seen anything interesting yet? Hmm?”
Feeling pleasantly surprised, Sherlock had informed John of the case and so, after the lesson they had both headed down to the crime scene together. Lestrade was waiting for them in front of the yellow police tape, instantly launching into a long explanation of the murder scene and their theories so far. A woman had been found dead in her bathtub, no signs of any sort of known drug in her system and no signs of forced entry. She was just… dead. She had lived with her slightly younger brother who had found her when he arrived home, the neighbors had nothing suspicious to say about her or anyone she knew, as far as they were concerned she was a private and quiet person who took care of her brother.
Silence followed once more. Lestrade and John both looked thoroughly impressed, Dimmock looked incredibly offended and annoyed. In the close distance, the rest of the investigators were all pretending to take notes, obviously eavesdropping and trying not to look too obvious.
Afterwards, they had settled on their sleeping bag (two zipped together to make a single one to keep body heat). Now, hours later they turned to look up at the stars, the lack of tent providing them with a truly spectacular view. Truth be told Sherlock did have his house in literally the middle of nowhere. John had never seen stars like this in his entire life, and judging by the awestruck look on Sherlock’s face he hadn’t made much of an effort to look at them before now.
“The... fumes of the explosion might have made them…. Enlarge dramatically. Their size could not be decreased with magic. ‘The Department of Magical accident and catastrophes’ tried. Several times. But in my defence how could I have expected my formula would be successful to THAT degree?”
John had gained a bit of a reputation in the past couple of years, making conquests in the Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff houses. Girls and boys were delighted, even eager, to be charmed by John. Greg had taken to calling him ‘Three houses Watson’ and unfortunately, the name had stuck. Ravenclaw was the only house he hadn’t dated anyone in... yet anyway. He never dated seriously, preferring the chase, the easy dates and no string attached. Not that he tricked anyone either. He
Sherlock laughed and laughed, tears started to trickle down his face and John could stop the giggles from rising up his throat and joining him.
The woman in the painting kept staring at Sherlock expectantly. His brow furrowed with every passing minute as he stared back. The chime of the clock signaling four in the morning had removed a part of his mind from the trance-like state he had been immersed in and already he could feel his back screaming in protest at being held in this same position for such a long time. The woman stared some more, silently challenging him with her dark brown eyes. He sighed, shattering the tense silence as he straightened up from his crouch with a pained groan. It was hopeless. This painting would not be finished tonight…. well, this morning he supposed.
Sherlock nodded eagerly, wanting nothing more than for things to go back to normal between them. Like when they were kids… but he wasn’t sure how to go about it. “Sure,” he said, smiling back. This, at least, was a start.
Without the dazzling heat of John against his back, Sherlock was able to reboot his brain and focus on the task before him. Just a few minutes later he had the gates open and his face was almost back to its natural pale colour. Almost. But, of course, John noticed.
The door of the classroom flew open and everyone was startled out of their numbed states and turned towards the door. Professor Septima Vector was standing in the doorway, dragging someone behind her. John strained his neck to look past Mary, trying to see who it was but couldn’t make them out from behind the professor.
The GOOD news is: it won't last very long <3<3 AND I added a chapter to my plan- it's pretty much fluff and smut so. I hope that makes up for it .
He ran inside the shop with him and after another few minutes of Sherlock making very good arguments and the shop owner nodding enthusiastically to each and every one of them John walked out of the store and into the rapidly darkening streets of Diagon Alley with the Owl perched on a pearly white cage.
he had not expected. Romance. HIM? What a ridiculous notion. As if anyone in their right mind could possibly entertain the possibility of spending time with him. Let alone love him. How could it happen? When he couldn’t even make friends!
After a few confused second the blonde let out a loud happy laugh “Right. Of course, that’s where you were going with that” he beamed up at the taller man, looking as if he’d never seen anything so wonderful in all his life.
There went John’s chance. Sherlock would, of course, never book him back. He didn’t even have another class to be able to apologize and he could not just simply show up at is classroom unannounced. If you weren’t a student, a teacher or the model assigned you couldn’t just walk into a figure drawing lessons with a nude model. It was in the rules. Dammit.
Sherlock was breathless. He suddenly couldn’t remember who he was, let alone where and what he had been planning on telling John. He slowly and willingly drowned in the deep blue of John’s soft eyes and forgot to hide the surprise and affection from his own expression, suddenly shifting his eyes quickly from John’s eyes to his lips and back.
John looked at Sherlock’s retreating figure curiously, before glancing back at his studio’s door. What could he have in there that he couldn’t let John see? It’s not like John hadn’t seen his art before, he’d seen the drawing he had made earlier that very day. Maybe he had drawings or paintings of other nude models and would rather respect their privacy? The thought of someone, male or female, standing in Sherlock’s studio posing naked for solely him made John twinge with envy momentarily. What would it feel like? Modelling for only him? In a room where there weren’t students all around observing him as well. Would Sherlock let down his guard and look at John for hours, his eyes hooding with every passing second. That lovely blush that would sometimes spread through his cheeks reaching his impossibly long neck and pale chest. Would the room grow too hot and he would have to take off his usual blue scarf? Maybe unbutton his shirt just a little-
“Oh, Sherlock... I’m so sorry” John’s brow furrowed in sadness. He imagined Sherlock as a kid, all bouncing dark curls and big icy eyes, abandoned by his father. He felt the urge to take Sherlock into his arms, hug him and never let go.
and fond smile. The one that reached his eyes and scrunched up his brow. Sherlock was beginning to realise how much he liked that particular smile when it was directed at him.
Sherlock smiled at them, he himself startled with the sincerity of the joy he felt at the sight of them. After all, the school year was long finished and they wouldn’t be his students anymore. “Hello,” he said. John grinned and approached them quickly, pulling Sherlock alongside him to greet them properly.
“Found it then. You Alright?” John raised himself slightly and kissed his hip, letting go of Sherlock’s cock with a filthy wet pop.
“No! No.. its fine” the boy answered. He was also looking down at his feet, not meeting John’s eyes. His arms were trembling slightly at his sides,
His ‘part time job’ as a crime solver for the incompetents at Scotland Yard such as his usual correspondent ‘G. Lestrade’ helped make the void not seem so empty, and along with drawing he felt almost complete… but not quite. Something was missing. And if Sherlock knew where to find it he would go in a heartbeat.
that they hadn’t been exactly subtle. But maybe there were still some doubts… and Sherlock was most certainly
She kept babbling about materials she needed and John’s parents followed her lead, looking slightly disturbed but mostly completely indifferent to their surroundings, unlike John who was gaping at every passing store and every fascinating passerby. They’d only been here for a couple of hours but their parents were growing impatient. Harry took no notice and keep prattling about the books she needed before she could go hunting for a cauldron and a wand. ‘
“Oh... right,” he cleared his throat and looked away avoiding John’s narrowing gaze. The blonde sat next to Sherlock on the white soft duvet of the bed, carefully avoiding to sit on any of Sherlock’s long slim limbs and opened his mouth to yet again ask why Sherlock had not told John he had a girlfriend or to at least assure him that he would not stand in their way and that he shouldn’t feel bad for John’s pathetic pining, he wasn’t sure which he was going to say yet.
“Shh… it’s okay Sherlock. There are things we need to talk about, definitely. But I’m sure we’ll figure everything out. It’s in the past. And this. This what’s happening between us? It’s our now”. John laid a peck on Sherlock’s cheek softly. “But not here,” he breathed. “Your back must be completely wet and freezing. And I’m not having you catch a cold. Come on,” he rose with difficulty, peeling himself away from Sherlock, who clung onto him, reluctant to let him stand up. But John insisted.
“Oh thank goodness. Merlin knows that boy hardly sleeps.” She started putting some biscuits and sandwiches on a tray together, knowing by know that John was always hungry, even when he denied it. She sniffled again, avoiding his eyes.
“She…” John took a deep breath, composing himself “She relapsed. Of course, she did. I thought I’d learnt to never trust Harry with important moments but she panicked. She’d grown used to both of us being such colossal disappointments that the thought that I was happy… well… I don’t know. I can’t help but think that was it.”
Most of the yard was busy screaming at Sherlock and each other so John, not exactly knowing how to play it was sort of lingering in the sidelines.
John had always been surrounded by many friends, finding social interactions an easy give and take he was familiar with. Plus, it drowned out the quiet of the nothingness at home. However, he’d never been one for actual... conversations? His friends at school only seemed interested in playing hide and seek and shooting at each other with their toy guns and usually, John was more than happy to oblige. But he’d spent all day talking and listening to Sherlock, learning about this new place and it’s rules and wonders and had found himself nothing but utterly captivated.
“This is harder than I thought it would be”, John spoke softly, “I just want to go there with you” his gaze trailed down Sherlock’s body greedily.
As expected John’s parents had let him go without a second thought, barely lifting their gazes from their phones to nod and make an approving sort of hum at John’s request. Soon after, Harry had left for Hogwarts and returned with many tales and descriptions, most of the things she said, however, were things John already knew as he spent that first summer asking everything he could think of to Sherlock and his mother. He had barely seen Sherlock’s father around, it seemed he travelled for work quite a lot and whenever he was there he never seemed to be in a good mood at all. Sherlock shrugged when John asked about this, however. He said it was nothing out of the ordinary but John caught the depth of Sherlock’s indifference as a sign that it was a sore topic he shouldn’t bring up again.
John sighed, and eager to change the topic asked his friend what was going on with them. Molly rambled on enthusiastically about her new project and her plans to make a perfect ‘Felix Felicis’ potion for her final exam with Professor Slughorn. Greg talked about the new Quidditch team trials and absolutely insisted John had to sign him up as the second beater, attempting to show off his strong batting skills with his fork but just ending up splattering Charlie Magnussen’s face at the Slytherin table with scrambled eggs. John chuckled and smiled with his friends and for a moment, he didn’t worry about Sherlock.
“Right,” John said. A few awkward seconds passed before John broke the silence again, determined not to let this ruin how perfectly breakfast was going. “So what’s his name?”
Madam Pomfrey, the smart woman, scattered away sensing the change of the tone in John’s voice when he spoke to Sherlock’s vulnerable figure.
John’s high laugh echoed through the staircase as they approached Sherlock’s flat, Sherlock’s rumbling chuckle right behind it.
Irene turned to see him, grinning widely. She made to approach him but noticed the interviewer and nodded to express they would talk later. She surveyed John by his side and looked him up and down with wide eyes before turning back to Sherlock and winking suggestively, a proud grin pulling at her lips. Sherlock couldn’t help the happy smile he sent her way.
Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat, as it usually did when John looked at him like that. He looked down at his book to hide his blush and hoped John would think it was merely a result from the heat of the fire.
particular summer day John was sitting down under the biggest oak tree he could find in Sherlock’s backyard, browsing through one of Sherlock’s many books on Quidditch tips and history. Even if he knew chances were he could never fly a broom himself the game itself seemed endlessly fascinating to him. Sherlock was lying down in the grass next to him, muttering to himself every now and then about something that suspiciously sounded like “drought of the living death” but John knew better than to ask, lest he wanted to find himself trying to replicate the same potion even when he and Sherlock couldn’t find the exact ingredient and could not use magic. Sherlock was a big believer in finding a way or a loophole even in magical potions. 3 of John’s destroyed jumpers were clear evidence of how far he would go to prove this. John snorted lightly but kept reading.
Greg huffed a laugh, “this is your own welcoming banquet isn’t it, Johnny?”. He grinned “what do we like this year? The girls? The boys?”
he was the only one. And what could be better than that? He resigned to keep himself collected for now. Too ‘woo’ John, per say... into being his.
“Really?!” John beamed.  “That’d be so great! Let me just… find my mum to ask. She’s probably around the counter checking her messages” with one parting grin John ran outside to find his mother.
Sherlock shook his head “It’s fine, John. I should’ve trusted you. I suppose I’m still getting used to-” he paused and motioned with his free hand between the both of them “This. I- I’ve never done anything of this sort before. My brother always said sentiment was a weakness. A human error”.
Sherlock quickly looked around the room, almost every student was staring dazedly at John’s hobbling figure towards the left side of the room. So clearly Sherlock was just having a natural reaction to John’s strong presence. Clearly.
He had never seen John like this, then again no one had ever made such a direct move on to him. John was always around and most people they met instantly assumed (correctly, of course) that they were together. But this reaction was rather… stimulating. He knew now, of course, that they were in an exclusive relationship but hearing him actually say the word boyfriend in reference to himself... it
John tilted his head further, perfecting the lock of their lips as he gently kissed those plush pink lips over and over and over again, just as he’d been dreaming of doing for months and months. Sherlock groaned softly into John’s mouth as the latter pulled his lower lip between his lips and sucked softly, dragging it tenderly with his teeth in a way that Sherlock swore could make him combust with that alone. Who knew kissing could feel like this? If Sherlock had known earlier… well, he probably would’ve kissed John a lot sooner. John was gentle, but possessive. Sweet, but dominating. He pushed himself into Sherlock’s space and absolutely
The Beauxbaton rolled his eyes. “You only won because you cheated. With your 3 meter jumping and all. There’s absolutely no way you could possibly win now.” He had to admit, though, John’s enthusiasm was quite contagious and he found himself beaming back at the Gryffindor.
“Hey,” John spoke softly, seeming a little cautious for interrupting Sherlock’s drawing. Sherlock felt a small glimmer of warmth. “Hello John, your leg is feeling alright I assume?” he winced internally, cringing at the fact that he had so quickly jumped to a safe conversation instead of being like any normal human being and asking actual questions and being interesting himself. He kept his eyes on the page, pretending to keep highlighting shadows and half hoping John would say something or ask something just so Sherlock wouldn’t have to embarrass himself again.
Sherlock sighed dramatically, throwing his arms up in the air “Have you lot even looked at the evidence? The video clearly shows him getting into and out of the hotel and his hand is bare!” he pointed to the body “See? Wedding ring! Dirty wedding ring as Mr. Watson kindly pointed out for you. State of the marriage right there. Now look at the bed sheets- he checked in on the same day he left so why on earth would the bed be unmade if he hadn’t been accompanied? And don’t give me ‘he took a nap’- who on earth leaves the bed looking like that after a nap?”
As soon as the Beauxbatons students began taking seats the empty silver plates at the centre of the tables suddenly flourished and filled up with servings of any dish you could possibly think of. With a cry of joy Greg tucked in unselfconsciously, and rolling his eyes to his friend John turned around from the still entering students and did the same.
Forcing himself to think about nothing at all Sherlock finished himself as fast as he could. Denying absolutely that as he came that he pictured John’s pink lips pressed against the back of his neck and moaning out Sherlock’s name.
“And look, John’s arm is braced behind him and is clearly very obviously much larger than this. FEEL the roundness of the bicep. FEEL the way his body leans towards his left leg and the weight settles on his lower back. You’re not observing Anderson. You’re lying to me. Stop lying to me”. He handed Anderson his pencil back brusquely.
. Sherlock spasmed against him, wailing loudly in equal parts surprise and pleasure as John pulled him out of his pants and into his rough calloused fingers. Turning his face up again to swallow Sherlock’s groans into his mouth and soothe them with his tongue, John aligned both of their erections together and began to stroke. The wetness gathered from both of their dripping slits was enough to make them slick. “Christ Sherlock, you’re so beautiful…”
John’s hand paused when Sherlock blurted out his question, surprised for a couple of seconds before he resumed. “Move in here? Really?” he sounded pleased.
“Yeah... much better now. Now that we can do this” he rose on his tiptoes and laid a kiss on the artist’s lips. Sherlock responded instantly, arms wrapping possessively around John’s neck and tilting his head for better access. This had to be a good sign. The blonde clearly needed comfort from him so the cause of his sadness was most likely not connected to them. They still needed to talk. Sherlock needed to know. He wanted to keep seeing John no matter if he was the only one or not, but he couldn’t keep the pretense of not knowing the model was seeing or wanted to see other people too.
“Excuse me” a familiar voice now resounded right behind Sherlock, instantly calming his boiling blood and angry words rising in his throat. “I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m John, the model in the paintings. Sherlock’s
when he rose slowly, the back of his blue school robe all but sticking to the gentle curve of his arse.
Moments later, after John had led him into the studio and had gently positioned Sherlock in the middle of the room, he had settled behind an easel, with a large sheet of off-white paper stuck onto a drawing board, as he was used to seeing students draw him on. He turned a small lamp from the desk on to light one side of Sherlock’s body, providing a lovely contrast with the paleness of his creamy skin and the darkness of the night shadows around them. Sherlock took a deep breath and pulled down his briefs, laying them a little bit away on the ground and facing the light.
?” Sherlock whispered, his voice cracking. He removed his hands from his mother’s shoulders, his eyes widening in shock. “I….no…..
John looked absolutely dumbstruck as if the possibility that Sherlock could have thought that had never even crossed his mind “What?” his eyebrows rose. He opened his mouth a couple of times before he rushed out “No! She only gave me restaurant recommendations. Mentioned you are quite fond of Italian- and she… pointed one out for us” his voice softened with every word, trying desperately to understand what was going on in the professors reeling mind.
“Without further ado,” the headmistress said, “let us welcome the student and staff from the Beauxbatons Academy!”. The Great Hall gates opened with a swish of her wand and instantly a flurry of blue robed student began trickling in.
However, as logical as Sherlock’s plan had seemed at first John couldn’t help but find himself doubting the science of it. Especially today.
The unanticipated movement caused John’s foot to get caught in a small crack on the ice and his foot twisted slightly, he wavered dangerously. “Oh!”
He opened his mouth, trying to find something to say and knowing if he didn’t.. he would definitely make this irreparable.
“Fine. But you come back here for the game. I actually secretly hate these things. Nothing interesting EVER happens.” She sighed
The artist stopped in the middle of the room and sank down on the ground, sitting on the wooden panels and looking up at John, motioning him to do the same. the blonde complied, crossing his legs under himself and leaning down onto his arms stretched behind him. The sunset was finally upon them, its orange, red and yellow hues in stretching beams of light, blending together and draping over both of their figures, casting long lazy shadows into the space behind them.  The soft deep purples in the bottom of the sky slowly loomed over the city. John turned to look at Sherlock bathed in all these lights, looking awe-struck and wondering, and couldn’t help but raise his hand, tuck his fingers beneath the man's chin and tip him down, capturing those pink pillowy lips between his.
The urge not to reach for Sherlock’s hand was becoming positively maddening. He clenched his fingers a couple of times, wondering how his friend would react if he just… If he JUST-
John gave in with a groan, recapturing Sherlock’s lips and pulling the artist in with both hands around the small of his back. With trembling hands, he rubbed Sherlock’s sides gently, feeling the man’s spiking pulse directly against his chest and wanting to soothe him
Said muse was behind him, waiting for the interviews to be done. Sherlock turned to look at him, almost pleading for rescue but john just laughed discretely and shot a fond smile. He then motioned to his empty wine glass and made a questioning tilt of his head to which the artist nodded enthusiastically, much to the model’s amusement. Sherlock turned back to the reporters as John went to get them yet another drink (wine as courtesy from the gallery space, much to Sherlock’s delight as he didn’t believe he could have survived this night without alcohol… and John) and did his best to focus.
The day passed without a hitch. Mary was absent from class today so Sherlock was in a much better mood by the time the afternoon session rolled up. The other students were still quite entranced by John but Sherlock was enjoying the fact that during the breaks John would always send a smile his way.
Sherlock didn’t look quite as enthusiastic. “She never sends letters by themselves. She usually sends them with packages…”. He looked at the seal sceptically before he tore it open and took out the letter. It wasn’t very long, just a single page. Sherlock swept his eyes over it rapidly, his face blanching with every word he read, his lips purse tightly and his fist clenched against the table. Without looking at either John, not Molly he stood from the table, picked up his tiny cauldron with the finished tranquillizer potion and downed it in one gulp and stormed away from the great hall.
John’s eyes widened, sitting up straighter and placing down his teacup carefully “That sounds brilliant!”
Now, hours later, Sherlock bit his lip, marveling at the fact that John had stayed with him, had fallen asleep in his bed and hadn’t let go of Sherlock for hours.
Sherlock caught Molly’s eye again. This time, she looked over at John and back at him and grinned giving one firm nod in approval, almost in pride. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he quickly looked away. He hadn’t been that obvious. had he? Better not think about it.
“Sherlock. Even if you got magic right this second you do realise you wouldn’t be able to control it until you got your wand right?” John shook his head minutely, sighing as he turned to another page in his book.
John didn’t look convinced at his dismissal. His eyebrows scrunched together in worry and the artist leaned forward and kissed his brow gently. His eyes still stung from unshed tears. The memory of that woman flirting with John was painstakingly vivid in his mind. Her fingers curling around her long red hair and the model’s laughter directed solely at her. The artist’s lower lip gave a tiny sad wobble he hoped the blonde couldn’t perceive in the darkening light. The memory of the sunset they’d watched together stabbed at Sherlock’s insides, and he wished with all his heart that he was still there.
“SHERLOCK! JOHN! We have to run! Potions starts in 2 minutes and you know Slughorn hates it when we’re late.” Mike cried running towards them. He stopped and looked between the two teenagers, instantly sensing the mood of the conversation “Oh. Uhh.. I… I’ll just go then yeah?”
“I could give you a full school tour in the dark!” Sherlock grinned, pulling up the keys in front of John.
“Uh... I” Sherlock stumbled over words for the first time in his life and he could see John worried, yet intrigued, leaning closer towards Sherlock from his seat.
He knew he should have been paying more attention, but he couldn’t. Irene was now looking intently at Sherlock and slowly closing the book in his hands to put it aside. Her slender body was turning completely towards him and he could see her talking
It was clear that his class was bracing themselves too, everyone trying to be 100% focused on their drawing and gaining momentum in their graphite strokes on the paper. Even Anderson had granted Sherlock the honour of tearing his gaze away from Sally’s waist and was squinting at his drawing as if willing it to look exactly like John.
“Molly” Molly turned around, a little nervous, “This is a pretty good start. Keep going.” Molly only smiled and nodded, knowing Sherlock was not expecting a thank you but a continuation of effort and work.
Sherlock handed him his tea and motioned towards the open door with his head, leading they way. He let of a long breath quietly, knowing that however he and John’s relationship was going to progress was going to be narrowed down to however the next few minutes. He bit his lip and opened the door the rest of the way, John stepped into the dark room and Sherlock closed his eyes, braced himself and turned on the light.
“Oh! Um... I don’t know? Are you planning on having us walk on it or something?” he was far too focused on the pressure of Sherlock’s gloved fingers around his wrist to really put much thought into anything else, let alone the thickness of the ice.
John thought. He shoved Anderson against the wall and leant close to his face, his eyes darkening in anger. “Try me,” he hissed.
And he, of course, just decided to wear his very best suit because it was the last class of the week and It was a nice way to end the week before his long weekend. Of course. Nothing of this had to do with John of course. It not like John would be wearing anything anyway!
Flashes of John’s body yesterday passed through his mind. What would it feel like to touch his strong arms? Course a hand through his short blonde hair when wet? Observe water droplets running down his muscular form and getting caught in the crevices of his abdominal muscles…Glancing down Sherlock stared at his forming erection in shock. Well, that was unexpected. Rolling his eyes he did his best to ignore it. After all, it was just transport.
Once Sherlock finished dressing himself to the nines he headed down to the school, shoulder bag in hand with his art materials and notebook to make further notes of John if necessary. He also took his sketchbook filled with drawings of John, just in case he decided to draw with his class throughout the day.
John beamed at him, his eyes still worried but trying not to pry. He took hold of Sherlock’s cold hand and laced their fingers together, pulling him back onto the street gently to call a cab to his home.
“This was great! I can’t believe you go on cases like this all the time!” John said as soon as they stepped outside onto the street. He raised his hand to a cab some way down the road.
“Are you ogling me, Watson?” Sherlock smirked, looking over his shoulder and directly at John, catching him in the act.
John walked out of the changing screen. “Everything alright?” he asked, seeing how fast Sherlock was packing up all his things into his bag, rushed but still managing to be careful of his most precious pencils and drawing charcoal.
Sherlock slammed his hands against the table loudly. “Enough! What’s going on?” he shouted. His face had turned angry, something had finally snapped. John saw the pain in his clenched hands, his anxiousness. But enough was enough. It couldn’t go unspoken anymore. Whatever it was they had to know. They had to.
Sherlock was pacing rapidly around the room, while John sat on his chair reading the paper. Even after months of living together Sherlock marveled at the fact that it was now ‘John’s’. If he was being honest, though, it had been from the moment John had walked into the flat months and months ago that first time, really.
He closed his eyes, knowing that whatever he was feeling was probably heightened by finally seeing Sherlock’s handwriting on a paper, after all these years of waiting for it. He opted to answer anyway, regardless of however upset he was feeling. He reached for another piece of empty parchment from his bedside table and scribbled a response.
She smiled menacingly and leaned as close as she could “Very good. And I'm not blackmailing Sherly… just looking for protection. Anyway, you'll help me”. She concluded
Sherlock stared down at his phone. He wasn’t sure what John’s signals meant at all. He wanted this woman… but he wanted Sherlock too? Maybe Sherlock could share... if it meant keeping him. But the thought of the blonde touching someone else, calling someone else ‘gorgeous’ or ‘love’ as he sometimes did him in the heat of the moment... it physically burnt to even consider. But what choice did he have? After all, moping around was not going to help him in any way. If there was even the slightest chance that he could convince John to stay, he was going to try.
“That’s not fair!” Sherlock bellowed, eyes wild and hair damp and sticking out in all directions. He coursed his fingers through it, frustrated, but only managed to make it look more like it belonged to a crazed scientist.
“You don’t have to thank me, sweetheart.” John kissed his temple, unaware of Sherlock obsessing over the word
Lestrade stammered out the address, startled by the artist’s urgency and Sherlock jotted it on the blank page in front of him. He hadn’t been able to draw anything at all during the last couple of hours. No wonder Irene had been concerned. He finished scribbling down the address and promptly hung up on Lestrade before he could say anything else.
The class was drawing faster than ever, better than ever. Even Anderson was hanging on to Sherlock’s every word. The professor had never revealed that he had another job, let alone one as interesting as a consulting detective that went on to crime scenes and caught criminals red handed.
Sherlock finally looked up “You’re not interested in men, Irene. Why would my love life be of any importance? Not that there is any of which to discuss, anyway” he said, trying not to sound bitter as Irene’s eyes lit up with surprise.
“I see you’ve drawn this particular man quite a lot. He seems to be the very center of the… show.” He snorted and stopped walking, Sherlock almost walking into him. Victor Trevor turned around, looking smug and predatory and stepping closer. “Is he… your cousin or something?”
John’s heart stopped. Sherlock had told him a couple of weeks ago how just short of a year ago his father had run off with a younger woman he met at one of his business trips. It wasn’t his first affair with another woman, as Sherlock and Mycroft had known, but it was the first his mother had found out about. And she had been absolutely crushed.
“It means that whenever the police are out of their depth I help them. Which is pretty often, to be honest. And to answer your previous question I knew because they suspected him due to his PTSD and habit of having nightmares related to his time in the war. He had been going to therapy for a couple of years but it had not seemed to help and thus they pinned it on him.” Sherlock took a deep breath and went on, the speed of his speech doubling but each word still perfectly enunciated.
“Right. Well. I have much work to do. It’s been… a pleasure” he rose a brow, turning back to Sherlock and quickly surveying his form once more. “Mr. Holmes” he purred, nodding and licking a slippery pointy tongue to the edge of his teeth. John’s hold on Sherlock’s waist tightened even further.
Momentarily storing away the gorgeous memory of John calling him ‘love’, Sherlock smiled. This boy.. this man… cared so much about him. And Sherlock knew the chances of getting his father away from his family and finally get rid of him for good were slim but somehow- he believed John. He beamed at this impossible boy in front of him and knew he trusted him… he trusted him when he said everything would be okay.
John smiled. “Anyway...what are you reading so thoroughly? I thought Beauxbatons would have similar books as Hogwarts”.
“What?” John momentarily looked even more confused but then he follows Sherlock’s gaze down to his legs and then to his hand, clutching nothing but thin air. He blinked in astonishment, realizing he hadn’t even thought about the pain in his leg, or his limp, or the lack of cane in the entire time Sherlock had been talking about his cases. His gaze snapped back up as he looked back into Sherlock’s eyes and grinned, almost maniacally. “You amazing madman!” he laughed “How did you even.. how did you know?”
Good. Solid start, solid start. Now what? A question? Help with homework, perhaps? No. Too cold. No Quidditch talk, Molly had said. An invitation? To… hang out? John bit his lip. This really shouldn’t be as hard as it was shaping up to be. Okay. Focus Watson. It’s just Sherlock.
As soon as the bell rang Sherlock stood from his seat as if he was in a race. He started smashing every piece of material he’d gotten out of his bag back into it carelessly.
Irene was a model not like any other. For starters, she didn’t even bother with a modesty robe. Proving this very point, she walked about from behind the changing screen already entirely naked and climbed onto the platform, still surprising the students with her confidence even after being a regularly booked model in the class.
John nodded, the stone in his gut feeling heavier but the fierce need to protect Sherlock burning in his heart “I promise” he said. He meant it, bone deep. But the thought.. even the notion of going to Hogwarts and leaving Sherlock behind threatened to shatter John’s heart into a million pieces.
John stayed off the topic in his friend's presence though, having learned his lesson and not wanting to push Sherlock away. After all, if his friendship was all he was ever going to get he was going to make the best of it. Things always seemed to relax and return to normal whenever John asked about Sherlock's progress with experiments or if he asked him to deduce him the lives of the rest of the students in year 6. (Apparently, Sarah had quite a crush on Mike Stamford). But as soon as the rapid flow of information was squeezed out of Sherlock the tension between them would arise again.
No had one questioned him, everyone, however, looked utterly and completely… unsurprised? Sherlock’s eyes had narrowed. He’d had expected at least some reaction from the class overall. Looking around the only thing out of the ordinary had been Mike and Molly who had been looking at each other with excited grins and raised eyebrows. Molly had looked at Sherlock quickly, and back to Mike. Sherlock got the impression that they were sharing the same train of thought, whatever it was, Sherlock had no idea. Molly looked oddly, proud.
Sherlock stared at his drawing, a funny feeling growing inside his stomach. Nerves? Why on earth was he feeling nervous?
“Goodbye! Thanks again” John called out after him, before closing the door with a wide grin on his face. How did Sherlock even know where he lived? John laughed. Of COURSE Sherlock Holmes knew where he lives. He probably knew John’s cellphone number and laptop password already too. John chuckled again, clutching his cane but marveling at the fact that he was standing on his own two feet, cane raised up on one of his hands, no longer feeling like a floatation device in John’s ocean but a mere object in his hand. There was almost no pain in his leg. Only the slight sting of soreness and disuse but it no longer cramped and complained where John balanced his weight onto it.
Well, this took FAR longer than I thought it would. To be completely honest.. life got in the way and I received my very first mean comment in a fic (not this one) and ughhhh I underestimated how horrible it would feel. I shook it off and deleted the comment but damn. People can just be real mean.
“You’re not sorry at all” Sherlock chuckled before ducked to kiss John in return. They were the only ones in the Great Hall so neither of them felt judgmental or curious stares as they reexplored each other’s mouths and lips. Sherlock hummed against John’s lips, relishing on the feeling of the blonde’s hands sneaking up to cup his neck and stroke soothing circles with his thumbs.
“Oh John... hehe You have a way with- hahah- words and a way with- pffff-- modelling and much hahah- much more. But John.” he cradled the blonde’s face in between his hands as they grinned stupidly at each other “You can’t draw” he giggled, his nose scrunching up with the peals of joyous laughter.
“Okay, okay” John raised his hands as if in surrender, looking hurt. “Is it… is it the student’s knowing?” he asked softly “Telling the headmaster or something? I’m sure they wouldn’t but Sherlock, I’ll do anything for you not to lose your job over me. I couldn’t do that to you” his face scrunched up in worry, clearly not wanting to overstep but needing to know what was wrong and how he could make it right.
“Excellent observation of the distance between the shoulder blades Janine” he turned his head to another. “Mary, as much as John wished this were true, his abdominal muscles are clearly not as defined and perfectly squared as you drew them here. He has a bit of a pudge down here."
Sherlock paused, putting the golden stained brush back into his solution of turpenoid and picking up a clean one. He observed his painting for a moment and closed his eyes, trying to recall the exact picture he was trying to replicate in as perfect detail as he could.
” he murmured, one of his hands sneaking into the back of John’s neck and scratching his hands teasingly down to the collar of his shirt.
himself and his sister being the magic exceptions in his family was very low. But he was happy to spend time with Sherlock, someone who unlike his sister didn’t act superior because they knew about the magical world. Sherlock had grown up with it and to him, it was second nature to explain how the world worked. “Someday” he would always say “I’m going to get that letter. And I’ll go to Hogwarts” (after 2 years they had finally learnt the proper name for the school and Sherlock had outgrown his lisp).
“I daresay I could tell Mr Watson about your incessant pining over him. OR I figure Anderson and Sally would find it awfully interesting”
Eliza Holmes treated John as if he was one of her own children, taking to cutting his hair herself after Sherlock had attempted to do so (with
“I know it’s fine” Sherlock finally turned and met his eyes. Whatever moment they were about to have however was interrupted as the elevator doors opened and a gasping Lestrade appeared before them.
Sheringford left on another business trip a few days later, much to John’s relief. He could feel the atmosphere in the house lighten up completely when the pressure of the man’s shadow wasn’t eclipsing the summer sun. His gaze was no longer stuck to Sherlock, in expectation of greatness, of a sudden surge of magical ability. And Sherlock, although still anxious, was no longer cowed to a corner in shame.
Afterwards, John had crawled into bed once more, pulled Sherlock against his chest and made sure he was alright, knowing the first sexual experience with a partner could be quite intense. Sherlock had mumbled an affirmation, shyly hiding his face in the crook of John’s neck and pressing his lips against the warm skin, breathing him in. In truth, Sherlock
Hours later Sherlock was staring at the ceiling. John’s place, as promised, was not very large. But it was charming and it was
He leant closer to Sherlock cupping his face with both hands as to avoid him looking anywhere else but directly into John’s eyes. “You are not something temporary to me Sherlock. We are best friends. And we will be best friends forever. You’re amazing. Stop doubting it”.
“That was amazing!” John suddenly exclaimed, grinning from ear to ear “How did you know all that?” his eyes widened. “Was that” John looked around as if someone might be eavesdropping on their conversation “Magic? Are you doing magic without permission?” he whispered.
They played until the sun began to set and the sky was a vibrant mixture of orange and purple. The dark clouds swirled 'round with the fall wind and stirred up the leaves on the trees surrounding the pitch, sending dry leaves flying all around them, disturbed only by their flying and twirling them onto different directions (sometimes each other’s faces).
A couple of seconds passed by until they looked at each other and kick-started their laughter once more. John head softly fell to Sherlock’s shoulder, cushioned by the soft blue scarf, and giggled against his neck. He could feel Sherlock’s laughter vibrating on his chest as it pressed against him. Instinctively, John’s hand raised to Sherlock's hip, meaning to push himself up and away. John had just meant to comment on the cold snow that was most likely sneaking up Sherlock’s back as he raised up his body to Sherlock’s when he suddenly realised the position they had found themselves in.
Sherlock smiled sadly. “I felt it too. I’m afraid my father was ashamed to have a “fag” as he would constantly call me, as a son.”
“Of course you know that without even having me tell you” he smiled. “We should play sometime!” He tried not to let it show how shaken Sherlock’s perfect French accent had left him. He should’ve known that Sherlock spoke French of course, given that Beauxbatons was in France... but just hearing his newly deepened voice in that accent… John didn’t really want to think about the skip his heart had given at the rolled 'R’s and the vibration of Sherlock’s voice at the hollow of his throat.
John’s face last night when he sent the note... but Sherlock thought he’d sounded fine. He definitely hadn’t seemed so... forlorn.  Sherlock bit his lip, trying to find something to say. But John beat him to it.
Just that second a massive flash of lightning ignited the clouds above them, and a groan of thunder startled John into holding his broom with both hands, almost losing his balance.
asked professor Longbottom for a sample. But he had also already asked him for an authorization form. And he’d already filled it out. But it was the only thing he could think of. And… sneaking into the Greenhouse with John held some sort of appeal. Some edge of danger... and something about being alone with the blonde in the darkness of the greenhouse gave him a strange sense of enticement he couldn’t quite place.
“Okay, enough chit-chat now” Sherlock stood from behind his desk. “To work now. We’re 20 minutes behind schedule so I expect you all to make up for it with energy and good drawings. Gestures poses. Go.”
“I still can’t… it's just. You. Magic” Sherlock grinned, the same look he had gotten after he and John had stopped jumping around and screaming with excitement after John’s first sign of magic. “You’ll come to Hogwarts with me” his smile softened.
John grinned right back, excitement bursting in his belly “Sounds like a plausible theory.” He stood up in front of Sherlock, steeling himself for whatever crazy experiments Sherlock was willing to try. “Where do we start?”
Sherlock tore away from the model’s gaze and looked up at him, without letting go of John’s hands. The waiter looked a little embarrassed at haven clearly interrupted, but Sherlock was pleased to see he wasn’t fazed by the clear tenderness in the intimate moment between himself and John. “We’ll both have the lasagna, please”, he said “And your best bottle of wine”, he added with a smirk.
“You. Me. Just.. us. Guess we have to learn to keep our hands to each other in public huh? It’s just so new to me that I can… that I can actually hold you. Touch you. Guess I can't help myself now that I have permission” John said, tightening his hold on Sherlock’s hand.
For full seconds John tried his best not to replay as vividly as possible the moments he had felt Sherlock’s lips against his. So soft and full and just as pillowy as they looked from afar.
“Hi,” he whispered, his voice coming out much higher and softer than he had expected, causing his cheeks to color slightly and to quickly clear his throat.
“You want me to?” John murmured as he looked up at Sherlock under hooded eyes. He could see how flustered Sherlock was getting already, but seeing him become more confident was a huge turn on for him. He wanted Sherlock to know how much John wanted him. How gorgeous he really was.
“Nope. No complaints. Sit down.” John gently pushed Sherlock onto the nearest chair and, coursing a hand through his soft curls on his way, went to prepare him breakfast.
“I said you’re an idiot” John smiled, pain still lingering in the edges, but fondness seeping into every corner.
“Sherlock. Sherlock Holmeth” Sherlock shook his hand tentatively. John’s heart lurched at Sherlock’s inconsistent lisp. The thought that he’d just met someone with magical knowledge didn’t seem so scary anymore, it seemed like the complete opposite. The curiosity to ask Sherlock about everything he didn’t know about the magical world suddenly gnawed at him.
John shook himself out of it. A weird feeling was spreading through his chest. An unwanted memory trying to seep through.
John, impossibly, blushed an even deeper shade of red and shoved Greg with his left shoulder lightly. “Yeah… I think so” he smiled.
Sherlock closed his eyes, he knew he had to ask now. He knew he had to. It was one thing for him to incorrectly presume they were together; it was another thing for other people to make the same mistake in front of John. Sooner or later John would have to correct them. Sherlock kept his arms to himself, selfishly enjoying these last few seconds before John noticed he wasn’t responding. His breath hitched slightly as the blonde licked over his pulse point but he resisted the low groan he would’ve let out.
John looked at the Ravenclaw. And looked. The cheer of the audience was still resounding as he opened his left hand in front of Sherlock letting the small shimmering golden snitch glide away, met by another wave of applause from the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff stands.
Irene walked from behind the screening again, now fully clothed in her siren cut white dress and matching delicate heels. “What is it Holmes? You seem so out of it today. You always nag your students to the ends of the earth and today... nothing? I want to get to shut down your arguments with my incomparable wit-” Sherlock smiled. “What happened today?” she prompted seriously, not concerned eyebrows, no questioning eyes. A demanding no-nonsense inquiry.
To his horror, whatever she said caused John to laugh happily, head thrown back and eyes closed in mirth. She giggled with him, her hand nervously flying onto her hair and twirling it around her finger.
Mary didn’t look convinced but she let it go. “Anyway...” she said, conspiratorially. “You know that kid that just walked in? That’s Sherlock Holmes. Biggest freak in Beauxbatons if you ask me”
“John? Are you alright mate?” Greg asked, yawning, clearly not used to having morning practices yet, standing up and shaking John out of his cyclical mind hoop.
“Looks alright. Just a small cut and some bruising… when we get back we should probably disinfect it and put some ice on it, though.”
It had been a strange feeling receiving his wand. The elderly man that owned the shop (Ollivander, John presumed) had taken a single look at him and rummaged through one of the top shelves behind his desk before handing him the caramel coloured wand. It had intricate patterns at the handle and a dent that was made as if by design to John’s hand. Well, the size was a tiny bit larger but he could tell that with the passing of the years his thumb would mould perfectly.
John hummed, biting down on Sherlock’s sweet collarbone and kissing down his chest. He lightly dipped his tongue into Sherlock’s bellybutton, loving how his chest expanded and contracted up and down, showing off all the gorgeous little love bites John had speckled around the pale white skin. He reached down the V muscles between Sherlock’s hips and caressed the soft beginnings of pubic hair below, shifting down on the bed and watching Sherlock for any signs of hesitation.
“Simple really” Sherlock mumbled, a little overwhelmed. No one had ever responded positively to his deductions. Usually, the models muttered something confirming Sherlock’s observations and then proceeded to avoid his gaze and respond coldly to him for the rest of the day. And here John was on his very first day and Sherlock had just revealed pretty delicate information about him without a second thought and John was… praising him?
Most of his student body, haven been resting their weight onto the solid door, stumbled forwards.  They looked up in alarm at their professor, all of them red in the face and mouths gaping.
John walked with the crowd of kids surrounding him, all wearing black robes down to their ankles and anxious expressions on their faces. John was so afraid. More than he could remember being in a long time. He was alone. No Sherlock to be a comforting presence beside him. No Sherlock to walk down and through those massive wooden gates with. No Sherlock to remind him that he was a part of this world too. Somehow. Miraculously.
Sherlock sat down without question, seeming unsurprised at where John had taken them and John took a seat beside him, resting his back against the scratchy trunk. The cool shade spilled over them, embracing them in a cocoon of soft cold relief from the burning afternoon sun.
Sherlock gently pried John’s mouth open, the blonde’s lips feeling more and more familiar with every shared kiss. He sighed, feeling at peace whenever he was being kissed by John, the butterflies in his stomach making happy swoops and urging him to press himself even closer. He held on to John’s jaw, thumb slowly stroking the slight amount of scratchy stubble.
year Hufflepuff student. “Beauxbatons and Gryffindor are tied! And it looks like Holmes and Astley have spotted the snitch! They’re in pursuit, Beauxbaton’s Holmes on the lead Gryffindor’s Astley not far behind.”
“You alright? You seem… flushed,” he cocked his head and popped a seemingly concerned brow. He suspected Sherlock could see right through it.
“I was very impressed with your work little brother” the elder Holmes continued, completely ignoring the artist. “You seem to have an… interesting subject” it sounded like a question. Mycroft’s eyes now turned to John, calculating and deducing him with a single sweeping if slightly bored look.
“I need to hear you say it love” John murmured, kissing the inside of his thigh and pulling it above his shoulder as he braced himself.
They sat at what had become their usual table for the last couple of weeks, only this time the red mantle on the circular table wasn’t empty. Two crystals globes filled with a swirling pearly white mist stood on opposite sides of the table, where Sherlock and John took their seats. John avoided Sherlock’s eyes as he sat down, trying to calm his anxious breathing and act normal. Of course, he failed miserably.
“I just can’t Irene. I can’t do it.” He heard Sherlock whisper sadly. “And I have never once acted like an animal of any sort” He hissed frowning.
The body belonged to a man not older than 35 years of age, medium length blonde hair and dressed pristinely. He was quite handsome and had a short scruffy stubble that, instead of making him look ragged or dirty had probably made him look edgy and mysterious. A wedding ring glistened in short snaps against the light of the flashing photographs and a bottle of pills lay spilled beside his hand, a phone lay on the other as if he had been clutching it the last moments of his life.
John was not jealous. He didn’t know why exactly he kept assuring himself that he wasn’t and he wouldn’t admit to having feeling a bit… off for the last couple of days. But he was not jealous, he decided as he fiddled aggressively with his firebolt, a birthday gift from Sherlock, as he waited for Greg to finish changing into his red and golden robes before their Quidditch practice...most certainly not thinking about Sherlock. Not one bit.
“Oi! As if! You’re lucky to be in my esteemed company” said John around a mouthful of pancakes, dipping his fork into his yoghurt dish and flicking it at Greg.
With a final clear of his throat, he released John’s face. “Right. Um. Get to work. No gesture drawing today. Just long poses.”
his brain screamed at him. He momentarily panicked internally, wondering whether tackling was still a socially unacceptable move. He quickly ran down a list of possible normal way to distract John before he just squawked “Youcan’tgointhere!”
“I don’t know John…” Eliza finally whispered. “But whatever happens to Sherlock. Whoever he turns out to be… we’ll always be here for him.”
John nodded, feeling a knot tightening in his stomach. He licked his lips, trying his best to focus on. “You never eat breakfast?” he sounded concerned. “You have to eat something! Most important meal of the day and all that”.
He followed John downstairs to get a cab, fingers twitching with the effort of holding himself back from grabbing him and kissing him.
Sherlock huffed in embarrassment and squirmed under John’s teasing fingertips “Childhood nickname…” he paused “I love bees, okay? Sue me”
Unfortunately... this is was important to the story. But it does not end here for John and Sherlock. This was just the beginning. (Yes, I know that doesnt make it better right now. I HATE MYSELF TOO DONT WORRY)
… trembling in his arms, crying out his name. Just that realization triggered his own orgasm and he came deep inside of Sherlock’s body.
Eventually as the ten minutes of the break ticked by the rest of the class trickled back in, all holding half drunk coffee cups in their hands and looking significantly more ready to tackle on their drawings for the rest of the day. John and Mary were still talking, from what Sherlock gathered John was a very friendly and approachable person, laughing at Mary’s jokes and responding politely to everything. Nevertheless, he could also tell that John wasn’t an open person, nothing he said revealed anything personal about himself and he preferred to listen much more than talk. But then again these observations were made by only observing John talk to one individual, one whose interest he was not seeking for.
“Sherl! Be careful hon- you’re going to hurt yourself!” Eliza cried as Sherlock sprinted across the kitchen and towards the sealed envelopes.
“He- uh. He’s the new model for my figure drawing class. I just happened to accompany him to his bus stop.” He answered, still looking into the depths of his steaming cup of tea instead of her.
“I was only angry for a few days. But by then I noticed… I hadn’t received any letters from you. Nothing. I never saw Gladstone and I never heard anything. I waited and waited… thinking perhaps you had fallen ill and were unable to write, but.” Sherlock breath shook. “No letters ever came from you. And just like that it was my worst nightmare come to life. I assumed you had met new people at Hogwarts, better and more interesting people who made you forget all about me. Finally, I went to Beauxbatons Academy and the silence persisted. I found that my peers didn’t… respond well to me. Nor the teachers. I thought about asking someone for their owl so I could reach out to you. I didn’t care if you'd found better friends. If you didn’t care about me anymore. I just- I wanted you back. I wanted my only friend back. Of course, I found no one who was willing to help me out and I admit I was afraid you didn’t even want to hear from me.”
Now-familiar warmth spread across Sherlock’s chest, the butterflies in his stomach deciding to make a swooping motion. He stood up and walked over to the windowsill, picking up his violin. He closed his eyes and brought the violin close to his ear, plucking the strings softly, one by one to make sure that it was perfectly in tune. He then rose the bow and placed the violin under his chin. He looked at John one last time before he held the violin securely with his left hand.
They both tried samples of each ingredient. Sherlock determined to see if John had any magical bursts with the increased stimuli of the spice. John coughed out a tiny ball of fire when presented with some of the potion ingredients, and smoke fizzled out from his ears and into the air.
