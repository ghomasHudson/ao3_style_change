At every creak he worried that Faith would start up, or that he would hear the sound of Danny opening his door, asking loudly for something to drink, but when he made it to the bottom, he was surprised at what he saw.
He was cut off when arms threw themselves around him from behind, holding him snug. Dean blushed and smoothly sputtered something, but Cas could only squeeze him, the Macy’s bags banging and snagging together awkwardly.
“Did you take a spill?” He asks and she nods, mouth still open in little gulping sobs. “Yeah?” He pulls her hand towards his mouth, kissing the angry, pink, skin.
a child. He almost wants to point to himself, to touch his chest and say ‘who me?’ the way they do on television shows. Faith runs through the sprinkler, her face shiny with water, a glaze of joy. Nervously he stands, the porch swing bumping against the back of his legs. He sheds his shirt, left only in his jeans and steps down off the porch to the grass. It itches his bare feet and little shreds stick to his heels, but he starts walking to them, Faith comes running. He swoops her up, kisses her, and then sets her back down and she runs through the sprinkler.  He stands on one side, watching her as the water parts for a split second and then she reemerges, screaming with joy, on the other side and he can feel the faint imprint where her wet naked upper half had been pressed against his chest, her little sun warmed body so close to his heart.  Danny giggles and does the same; the water fans around him and then he’s crossed over.
Some of them made it to this place, stooped and looked at their faces in the watery mirror for the first time in their lives. Others saw what they already knew because it belonged to their ancestors - the chins and noses of mothers and brothers and aunts.
“…till down came the rain and washed the spider out - ” Dean sang lowly, so as not to bother any of the other parents in the room, his hands shimmering down in a fake rainstorm. Danny didn’t really get the concept and just kind of waved his hands in front of him in a vague mirroring of Dean’s motions.
“As true as the day is long!” The bruja laughs, her eyes still sparkling. “It is the truest story you will ever hear.”
Dean breathes in and out, and Cas’s hand lays on his chest and he imagines each cell drowning in the oxygen, pictures the celebration of each groaning tissue as it receives blood and water, and marvels at the intimate mechanics of every atom.
“You get that on anything and Papa’s gonna kill you.” Faith stage whispered from her perch on Dean’s lap. Danny smirked and took a long drink, propping his feet up on the coffee table.
What he remembered, more than the actual song, was a pretty red head in a honky tonk outside of Forth Worth who had pulled him out on the dance floor and told him she was gonna ‘teach them bow legs how to dance if it was the last thing she did’. Dean wasn’t one to argue with girls like her, her pearly smile and sweet-tea personality, especially back then.
, Castiel thought tiredly, salt water seeping into his socks. He knew, of course, that he wouldn’t be here. He wasn’t there the first time. He was beginning to understand that his Father was probably not anywhere at all and that this journey he was taking was becoming less of a directive and more of a distraction.
But then that love settles arms on him like a blanket, and wraps around him as many times as it will fit, holding him like a soul that is trying to get away. Gravity gently reminds him that neither of them are going anywhere, but Dean ties himself around Cas to be sure.
“Oh, Dean, could you get that?” Cas said passively, folding the rest of the bills and slipping them into his pocket with the rest of the coins. Sam, stationed in one of Bobby’s recliners, watched in fascination as Dean nodded and then slipped to the floor. He dug around a bit, and then turned so his back was to them.
“No.” Cas shakes his head, leaning back against his seat. “No, it’s just, I’m going to be gone and I won’t be there to take care of them anymore. Or you.” He doesn’t take a breath, but he pauses, “I don’t care if I die. I’ve died so many times. It doesn’t scare me, but the idea - the thought of me not being there for you or Sam or Daniel or Faith…I can’t.” He presses his fist into his forehead and tries to stop crying because it isn’t helping.
“It still going up?” Dean answers gruffly, taking it from Castiel as he moves to steal the bags from the drugstore haul from Dean’s outstretched arms.
“You can’t take pictures in the dark without the flash on, stupid.” Dean commented, still swiping for the camera. Cas evaded and smacked the persistent hand out of his face, his frown deepening.
“Yeah, well I figured that this would make the day more exciting. I feel bad - I told Danny we’d go to the nature reserve and see the animals, but then the weather happened.” Dean shrugged, stepping back and scooting in between the wall and the chair, laying the hammer and the nails on top of the bookshelf where little hands wouldn’t get them.
A younger couple with an even younger son trying to wrangle him closer to them. Crowds were starting to line the street for the annual Christmas parade, and way far down by the post office Dean could see the congregation of high school marching bands and fire engines.
“Come on, give it a big push!” he says, watching through the view screen and then glancing at his son as he pants and presses his little palms to the carpet. “Come on, you can do it!” Dean encourages, clicking the zoom and then watching as Danny squeals, his legs pitching oddly.
“Magic!” he hisses, wiggling his fingers and Castiel feels a weight that was not there in the pockets of his over coat. He reaches into the pocket and plucks out the round black stone, the bird still fluttering above their heads, searching for an out.
“That was quick, no traffic?” Castiel says it with only half-interest as Dean opens the door, eyes fixed on the thermometer in his pale fingers, displeasure written all over his face.
“Ahh?” Danny’s baby voice crooned and Dean knew Cas nodded like he always did, like he always spoke the secret little language.
last epoch.  It would suffer through the ill-fitted animal pelts for a few more millenia, when they invented tailoring.
“What?” He whispers, shrugging. Dean shrugs himself, drinking his coffee again, but as he goes to sip he makes sure his brother hears him.
Daniel waved him back out of the room and Dean busied himself with making sure they had saltines and other things that Daniel could keep down later. He found a case of ginger ale in the pantry and opened one up, letting it sit on the counter for a few minutes before taking it to his son. When he walked back into the bedroom, he saw that Danny was sprawled on the bed, and though he looked asleep, he opened one eye against the pillow and huffed as Dean set the can down on his messy bedside table.
at it. Shoes and socks and Dean shakes his head at the very notion that at some point in his natural life he’d be putting white shocks and mary janes on a three year old on the way to his eight year old’s school tree trimming extravaganza or what not.
The next day, the star called to the catfish, but it could not hear, for heaven was too far from the earth in those times before all times.
Cas doesn’t respond, moving to rummage through the cabinets, already on auto-pilot. Dean watches for a moment before Faith leans her groggy head back.
“I like the part where Snoopy comes out from the pumpkin and it goes “WOOOOOO!” Daniel explains, crouching in the street and mimicking the sight while emulating the high pitched whistle that accompanies the action. He laughs at himself and Dean does too, ruffling his hair, pushing back the shark hood.
“It’ll be here.” Dean assures him, moving to sit in the row of black chairs right in front of the glass. He frees Faith from the trappings of her stroller before she can get fussy and pulls her up out onto his lap. Seeing this, Daniel, still a tad jealous of his beloved baby sister’s attention-stealing nature, comes to Dean’s side to, climbing up onto a chair before he worms his way onto Dean’s lap too. Faith looks at her brother and blinks before shoving her finger into her mouth and looking with renewed interest at Dean’s hand, turning it over and over and patting it with her own tiny palm.
No, surely she has been at the forefront of every great artistic mind. It simply must have been so. But, then again, Cas might be biased.
, Castiel thought, feeling the wind - the sandpapery cat-tongue lick of the air on every molecule, the UV rays carving canyons in Jimmy Novak’s cells -
“This was a good idea.” He whispers and Dean breathes a laugh and strokes the fine hair at the base of Cas’s skull.  “For everyone.”
“I am no man,” he mutters viciously, and the showman cuts his guffawing off to cock an eyebrow at him and smirk.
The salt knew death was coming for them back then and would be there again soon. It had tasted it before - it remembered the tiger’s tongue lolling into the water to lap and clean its jaws of blood. As far as it was concerned 46,000 years without any trouble seemed like a good time for it to start.
Then, Daniel looks to Mrs. Raven who kneels in the middle aisle and cues the sound guy. All of a sudden, music pours from the speakers and all the kids stand at attention. Dean feels his smile making his cheeks sore as he realizes that they are all wearing  matching white t-shirts with big green painted things on them made from what appears to be their hand prints. Daniel claps his hands in time with the music and the whole class choruses in on ‘Happiest Christmas Tree’, which explains why Daniel has been singing it nonstop for nearly a week.
“Now, you’re going to clean this up, and then I’m going to set up the traps, and then we’re going to go to dinner because you promised.”  Cas told him, and Dean just sagged.
As he brushes he can’t help but love the way the bottom waves and then eventually settles into curls. Then it’s the specific bow Cas put out because they’ve tried to have Dean pick before and he’s
of this act. He needs to see to Sam and Dean; the humiliation of having to please the creature is enough on its own, but now, the thing is toying with him. Making a plaything of him.
“I gotta go eat, but I’ll come back, ok.” She brightens, her mood already lightening. Dean smiles at her from the bed as she continues. “Let’s watch Monsters Inc.!” She suggests and Dean’s smile grows.
“Look, Faith, I’m a fish…” He said, puckering his lips and moving his hands like fins. Faith watched him and then slowly, started to mimic him.
When Cas comes downstairs wearing them in the morning, Dean has to hide his smile in his coffee because Cas shuffles in them or he trips, and the sleeves are constantly having to be pushed up, and he usually has misbuttoned it, causing for some odd angles, but mostly it’s about fifty kinds of adorable.
All three of them were completely asleep and Cas had to chuckle when he saw Danny with his mouth open and his arm flung over his face, not even changed out of his practice uniform, all of his 17 year old body stretched over the couch and his feet hanging off of the end. Then there was Faith, awkwardly turned in towards Dean’s chest, her leg stiffly hanging off the arm of the recliner, her bare toes twitching and her long brown hair caught in her eyelash, Dean’s own head thrown back, gone, his fingers holding Faith’s shoulder loosely.
“I missed you terribly.” Cas replies, kissing Dean again before they start heading for baggage claim.
“No!” Cas says hoarsely into the receiver, “No,” his voice is all congested, “it’s nothing like that, I swear. It’s just…”
An hour and a half later Cas opened the back door and scraped Daniel’s shoes out of the way like he did basically every time he came in. He was astounded at how quiet the house was, but when he entered the living room it was clear why.
“Dean,” Cas says, voice soothing. He pulls him against himself, arms wrapping tightly around Dean’s shoulders, pressing Dean’s head into the crook of his neck. Dean tries to remind himself that he’s safe. That this is okay, and he is alright. He tries to just breathe.
And at the rate things are going right now? Probably. Dean’s not sure he’s getting out of this trunk alive. “You sound like Sam.”
But it was hard to enjoy the world he’d saved when peace and quiet felt more dangerous than anything he’d ever had to face while on the hunt. And it was even harder when his mind wouldn’t calm down for a second, because all he could think of was what Cas had told him, and all he could imagine of his future was what he would say to Cas when he saw him again. Except even after he’d almost been killed by a vampire, Cas hadn’t showed.
“You want me to…?” He rubs an appreciative hand over Dean’s dick through his boxers and Dean shakes his head, grabbing Cas’s hips, feels the press of Cas’s knee between his legs, the softness of the bed. He stares up at him, the muss of his hair and the toned line of his shoulders, the wet on the front of his jockeys slung low on his pelvis.
and Dean doesn’t force him, so he stays. Besides, they are on an abandoned road and Cas isn’t exactly fond of the idea of walking back to Bobby’s in the oppressive heat they face. Dean massages his entire face, the skin making a slight rasping sound over his stubble, exhasperated. Castiel remains quiet as Dean sits back in the seat and inhales.
“Cas, come on, take this.” Dean grunted, shoving one of the many bags into Cas’s limp hands. Cas jerked into reality, snow pillowing down on the street with little flurries and eddies in the wind, some sticking to his hair and the lapels of his coat. It created quite the scene – the main street of their sometimes too perfect town lit up with lights, the main drag’s streetlights brocaded in fat velvet bows and huge garlands of holly. With the snow, it really wasn’t any true wonder that Cas was distracted. He had the sensitivity of a child when it came to stimulus like Christmas.
Cas starts to breathe deep again, and he knows he’s asleep for real this time, and Dean isn’t far behind him. It’s warm and the TV is on and it’s just about as close to bliss as Dean’s ever gotten, he thinks, even when Cas sighs in sleep and his stubble scratches on his collar bone. Even with two sick kids.
“Dean, what are you up to –?” It’s all Cas can get out before Dean takes the wrist he’s holding and pulls it up to shoulder level, his other hand settling on his hip.
“Oh, oh, oh! Hey!” Dean soothes, pulling her up against him, settling her on his hip, inspecting the hurts on her hands. He turns them over and then looks at her knees - scraped but not bleeding, but it will probably bruise on the soft baby skin.He brushes his thumb over her fingers.
He looked past himself, this self, the Jimmy Novak self. The plain clothes white man, completely irrelevant in a crowd of faces. The reflection he saw in department store windows and gas station bathrooms and rear view mirrors. It wasn’t dissimilar to his other form - run of the mill. The compact version of a sedan. His brothers and sisters were mostly correct.
Dean laughs so hard tears roll down his cheeks as the kids gaze up at him in confusion at what the hell he’s doing when he tells them their costumes aren’t at all accurate, or that they have no real validity, or perhaps they should have chosen a more honorable selection for dress. He tells one child he looks heavily like the scientist Louis Pasteur and the kid doesn’t even wait for his candy, but walks away.
“Seems a mystery worth solving.” He adds with a smile and they sink back into silence, touching each other’s feet under the table.
A moment of silence passes and Castiel knows exactly what Inias wants to ask him, because it’s what he asks himself nearly every day.
to see you try to make me do anything,” Cas growled, flipping and racing up the few feet, skidding into the bedroom, Dean hot on his heels.
“What?!” She exclaims, still half bent over the arm of the chair, her hand now resting against his. She grins uncertainly. “What is it?”
“Dean we’ve got to get that comforter in the wash.” Cas said, appearing at the doorway to Danny’s room. Danny was halfway to his bed when he turned.
“DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDY!” Daniel shouts, his voice, long and whining, winding into the hallway and into th bedroom. Dean groans, Cas folding socks, wincing as he rolls a pair together and then tosses it down with the rest of the folded clothes.“DADDY FAITH WON’T STOP!”
“Yeah, I know.” Dean tells Cas, even though he knows that he’s just speaking out loud to remind himself. Cas says something to someone and then focuses on Dean again, and Dean can hear in the background the chatter of parents and children and some kind of distorted Christmas song.
“Let me.” Dean insisted, pulling it off of Cas’s face to put it in the trash can, Faith occupied with the waxy paper she’d peeled off of the back.
“Wave bye bye!” He tells her and she shakes her hand limply up and down and Dean turns to wave to her too, making her shriek with infant joy.
Dean thinks, and he can’t help the smile creeping over his face. Why the hell they butted Cas’s conference up with Thanksgiving Dean could only guess at, but it made the traffic hellish and the wait for Cas to come home even worse.
“T-they h-hurt your foot. The bad guys. They hurt your foot, I’m sorry they hurt your foot, Daddy.” She chokes, kissing him again, “I’ll make it better. I’ll make it better, Daddy.”
“There is nowhere better than here.” Cas remarks, his words scented with absolutes from years ago even when his voice hovers barely above a whisper. The smell of Dean’s shampoo clings to his hair and Dean holds him, fastening his arms over his back like he’s still a star that could shoot off without him, like a soul that could fly away before he could catch it. The Whippoorwill trills again and the lake laps at the bank, coming and going, but always kissing - like two lovers coming home again and again, never growing tired of each other.
“I’m gonna go get you some water with lemon, but you can’t swallow it, ok?” Dean whispered and Daniel nodded vaguely.
, Dean thinks, rolling his eyes as he rephrases, trying to maintain eye contact with his hysterical three year old.
“Can’t see a thing – “ Cas mutters as Dean helps him, steering the neck of the bottle with his finger, smiling. The wine is making Cas’s face flush and it’s making his mouth loose. They go through the bottle as they eat slowly, Cas pecking at Dean’s leftovers when he’s done with his own.
It was like the understudy of the blog pie, or something. Maybe if the blog pie got sick, his pie would enthusiastically leap on stage and reprise the role, even though it wasn’t nearly as pretty.
“COME ON DADDY!” Daniel all but screams, looking at the streams of kids trickling down the streets in the dusky light, most with homemade costumes that speak of late night sewing for their satisfied looking mother’s.
The star was blessed and split, and wings grew from its back. It landed on the shoreline, and what had been two wings became a thousand kingfishers, all flying. The beat of the wings shifted the water and the star gazed down at the riverbed. The star pulled a stone from the river and blessed it, and the stone became a lantern, and the star cast the light over the water.
“Sleep.” He directs again and Dean laughs weakly, flopping back down, throwing an arm over his eyes. Cas runs an appreciative hand over his stomach and then leaves, the door creaking shut and clicking closed.
Blessedly, Danny managed to hold his stomach in until they got home, but as soon as they were though the back door, Danny was racing for the downstairs bathroom and shoving his head in the toilet, Dean following closely at his heels.
He tucks him in properly and kisses him, Danny curling instinctively up around his worn stuffed dog, coughing lightly as Polly crawls up the bed and assumes her usual post tucked into the crook of Danny’s legs.  Dean turns on his moon lamp and closes the door with a creak. He doesn’t want to risk waking Faith, so he passes her door, and continues into he and Cas’s.  He turns the television on low and turns the lights off, twisting tiredly into a thermal and flannel pants. He finds himself just climbing into bed when Cas comes in and immediately sets about brushing his teeth and the rest of his night routine, scratching lazily at his leg for a moment while he takes his clothes off, watching whatever’s on tv. He puts on a sweatshirt and his own pants, knit, and just about collapses beside Dean after a few moments, his legs having given straight out.
He knew what he was getting into when he picked the fight, but god, wouldn’t it have felt good to have landed a hit.
“Ok, come on monkey, into our nice clothes – we got 30 minutes, so cooperate!” He hangs the towel up and she scampers to her room, butt naked and making her parrot noises. He follows and pulls out the clothes that Cas mentioned she should wear and lays them out on the bed as she fiddles with one of her stuffed animals.  “C’mere!” He tells her, sitting on the edge of her bed and moving her clothes to beside him. She skips to him and leans on his knees as she steps into her underwear and then the undershirt he helps her with, her little baby tummy round and sticking out. He blows a raspberry on her cheek and she pushes his faces away, giggling like mad, and then let’s Dean shimmy her into one of her three Christmas dresses. This one is green and red plaid with gold threads that shine when she moves, and a big poufy crinoline skirt underneath. Dean reaches onto her dresser for her brush and turns her around so that she’s leaning between his legs and begins to brush her hair, working from the bottom up the way Cas taught him to get all the tangles out.
“Oh, really now?” Cas remarked, his eyebrows rising, Faith pushing her discarded paper into his hand. He crumpled it and shoved it into his pocket. “Thank you, Faith - That’s a good idea.”
They sway. It’s kind of mind blowing. With the wind and the way the way rain starts to pebble on the window. It’s very quiet, just the whine of the mattress spring and Cas breathing and Dean breathing and the silent parts where they lose their breaths in each other.
“I’d love that.” He smiles. Cas falls asleep almost instantly after that and Dean watches him puff a piece of hair falling over his damp forehead upwards before slicking it back with one heavy hand. His fingers stay there, combing, and Cas moves his head and the hand falls to his neck and eventually over his chest, Dean on his stomach, Cas on his back, their necks curved towards each other.
A few minutes later, Cas emerged, carrying a red faced Faith who was playing with the adhesive on the back of a sticker.
“He is.” Castiel finishes, and he watches the shadows through the window shades darting across the lawn, the sounds of their laughter. He wants to tell Inias what that feels like; to know that they’re there. But he knows Inias wouldn’t really understand.
“Shit, watch the burners – !” Dean slurred, sliding him over so that the levers wouldn’t dig into Cas’s back. Cas doesn’t really hear him though, laughing instead as he fights his hands up Dean’s shirt, untucking it and clawing bluntly at the taught skin of Dean’s back.
He became  caught by his hair as he passed through a thicket, and when they saw him  hanging there, the men of the king killed him.
The truth being that when Cas gets into watching his movies, he becomes so apathetic that Dean can’t resist. All the fight leaves Cas to do
“I’m allowed to call you monkey, right?” Dean said, poking her and Faith smiled, kissing him on the cheek.
“Didn’t Sam give you a manual?” Dean asked, letting his arms drop back to his sides before shoving his hands into his pockets. Cas shook his head, turning his head towards Dean, eye still glued to the camera.
“What happened to the man?” Leticia says after a moment and the bruja finishes her humming, folding her hands delicately on the little table top.
Elohim blessed the man, and his heart split and roared forth. His blood settled into the clay, and the red water ran, and Elohim took his hands and made him a catfish.
It’s the kind of cute that doesn’t make Dean feel like a complete idiot for having a very warm, sleepy, Cas sit on his lap at the kitchen table and look at the crosswords, scratching at his stomach in those striped pj’s, Dean laughing as he picks up the pen out of Dean’s hand and jots something in and then takes a bite of Dean’s toast before standing up to see if the coffee maker is done yet.
“Not yet…not yet…” he mutters and Dean slowly unfolds his hand over Cas’s weeping erection. Dean kisses his temple and inhales against his skin. They stare at each other and Cas pulls Dean’s arm forward, mouthing at the inside of his elbow. Dean doesn’t say anything (coherent at least) as he falls to his side, Cas climbing back on him to reach into the bedside table. He looks down at Dean, sympathetic for a moment.
Leticia squints, skeptical and the bruja hums some old song to herself, touching her little once beautiful cup.
Cas doesn’t respond, moving to rummage through the cabinets, already on auto-pilot. Dean watches for a moment before Faith leans her groggy head back.
The last trick-or-treaters amble away a little past ten thirty, a group of older kids who Dean gives the rest of their candy too, dumping it unevenly into their open bags. They look on in awe as he gets the second bowl and gives it to them too. Cas turns off the porch light and picks up a candy wrapper and the sweettarts off the table as Dean clicks off the TV and then vacuums up the crumbs beside the couch.
“You’ll have huge hands someday. Which is a totally weird thing to think about. Don’t tell your dad that because he’ll probably have a heart attack. I think he’s convinced himself to let you remain fun sized forever.”
He could see the sky spread out over the ground - purple and white clouds and hot yellow sun and the same oily blue sky. It hadn’t changed much either in 46,000 years.
“Well, I guess it’s fine since when you eat it you internalize the message,” Cas explained, chuckling a little.
“You are too fast a learner.” Dean comments, panting and Cas doesn’t say anything but changes their positions so he’s the one leading.
“Thank you, angel.” Cas says in response and Daniel goes back to sorting his candy, only looking up when Dean puts down their food and starts fiddling with the DVD player.
“We tried.” He whispers to the sandwich before picking it up and tossing it into the thicket behind their house.
A sister used her lion’s paw to slash slits in the veil and he pressed one of his great eyes to it -  rolled it over the blue marble spinning in the dark. They knelt at the edge of the plane, like children spying through a keyhole.
“Do you see her Danny? She’s telling the baby bunny to hush because it’s time to go to sleep.” Cas explains, and though Dean can’t see he knows it’s Danny and Cas’s very favorite part of the book and that Cas doesn’t even have to look at the words anymore. He leans his cheek into Danny’s hair, his fingers over Danny’s little baby stomach, warm and soft, gently stroking the fleece of his nightie, the baby quilt curled in Danny’s fat fist and his eyes sleepy and glassy as he stares at the pages of the book.
The hunger that had once been of many became one, and the catfish was quick and clever and was buried in the dark for many ages.
Castiel felt for the seam and slipped underneath the curtain of heaven. He nearly broke his back from the weight of it, but soon he wriggled free, popping out from between the stitches.
Besides, he’s her grandpa. He couldn’t be mad at her for being grumpy later if his life depended on it. So he lets her sleep instead, far past the time she’s supposed to, bundled up in Karen’s wedding quilt on his sagging couch.
“Of course! Cannot have young girls turning into catfish! Young girls are always having such heavy hearts. Young girls and young boys. It is because you want love, and wanting is a very heavy thing.”
She takes her big brothers hand and he lets her lead him to the stairs where they climb down carefully, still gripping each other’s fingers. Dean follows behind them, not bothered it takes them twice as long this way.
“Ok.” He breathes, before stopping, almost reconsidering, but not really. It’s more of a qualifier what he says next. “But she needs a bath – they both do. And we’ll put some of that rub on their chests, and they have got to get out of these clothes…I should have had them change earlier but I was tired and I wasn’t thinking…”
Polly jumped a little at another noise; she was currently draped over his feet and Cas stretched his toes anxiously under her furry stomach before pushing his chair back and standing. She followed him downstairs, her nails clacking, while Cas tiptoed past Danny and Faith’s room, peeping through the cracks to make sure they were still asleep before continuing to the stairs.
“Gotta make a goal and follow through, Cas.” Dean grins, one eye winking open to stare at Cas who blinks at him. He doesn’t smile as he sighs, shaking his head, shoving the remainder of plastic wrappers back into the box.
Which made for a very, very, wrung-out Cas. Most days he slept in the nursery, on the floor next to Faith’s crib in the hopes that he could calm her before her whimpering escalated to full scale wailing.
“Oh, really?” Dean said, pushing his face towards Cas’. Cas nodded, eyes already closing, lips already meeting Dean’s. He had to break away to laugh some more, but Dean pursued his mouth, sliding them together, panting a little as he forced Cas’s mouth open.
“It’s cause you don’t let him fall asleep on his own.” Dean smiles. “You wanna hold him; but you gotta let him learn to go down by himself, without you…he knows that if he starts crying you’ll come, and you won’t leave.” Dean explains, shushing Daniel, and Daniel screams louder than ever, but starts to eventually quiet. Cas just stays collapsed in the glider, It’s true. He doesn’t like shutting the door before Daniel’s asleep.
“MM…” Danny mumbled, rolling back into the couch, pressing his face in the side and twisting the blanket around his body. Cas looked at the ceiling for a moment and then smiled, going into the kitchen to start on said dinner, grabbing the empty powerade bottle on his way.
“These are cool. You always get books with pictures and stuff.” She chews on her lip a little after she stops talking and then swats more long hair out of her face, and Cas chuckles softly at her lack of grace. It’s when he emits that soft laugh that she finally looks up.
Cas tried to show him the picture, but Dean pushed it away, grinning. Once the page was back on the counter, Dean grabbed Cas’s hands and pulled him in, kissing him happily, pecking till Cas gave in and softened under his grip.
“This was a good idea.” He whispers and Dean breathes a laugh and strokes the fine hair at the base of Cas’s skull.  “For everyone.”
“I know sugar.” Dean says gruffly back, looking up at Cas. “You gonna handle her?” He asks and Cas adjusts her in his arms while she hugs his neck, making another miserable sound. Polly watches them from under the kitchen table, her ears pricking in their direction.
“Papa took Danny to his school so he could practice for the recital tonight.” He tells her and she noshes on her chicken and then picks up a piece of squash and eats that too. A thoughtful look comes over her face.
Castiel, instead, while passing out candy, offers them suggestions, receiving blank stares as he does.
“Who says I can’t go where I want?” He replies in time, swiping the pad of his fingers together, flicking it away.
Dean looked at the fort and nodded to himself before glancing at Cas who smiled back, walking to him. He scratched his back lightly and Dean moaned in approval, arching forward so Cas could get better access while his mouth found Dean’s shoulder blade.
“Only a little this time.” Cas acknowledged, patting her fat leg, her bare feet kicking. “I think she’s just tired. I scheduled her for the morning next time so she won’t be so grouchy - ” He was interrupted by her patting the sticker onto his cheek.
Their million eyes cast a wet gleam; they flickered and blinked, indiscernible from the stars against the black.
“Here, I’ll give you some juice after you take it, ok? To get the taste out – Dean, can you get that juice she likes?” Castiel sounds as tired as Faith is, and it makes sense because Dean’s been gone all day doing the whole mechanic thing, and Cas’s been taking care of a sick child.
Cas starts to breathe deep again, and he knows he’s asleep for real this time, and Dean isn’t far behind him. It’s warm and the TV is on and it’s just about as close to bliss as Dean’s ever gotten, he thinks, even when Cas sighs in sleep and his stubble scratches on his collar bone. Even with two sick kids.
“We’ll get it later.” Dean soothed, pulling out onto the main street, heading back to the house. He’d have to call the garage and tell them he had to take off - there was no way he could leave Danny at home by himself and Cas wouldn’t be done until after his office hours.
“Dean, I don’t understand the premise of your costume.” Dean looks up from the newspaper he’s reading and stares at Cas with an expression that clearly reads
Cas, who is constantly moving, working, looking for purpose, to stop and collapse, practically boneless, in their bed at whatever time it happens to be, with his hair sticking up in twenty separate cowlicks and that serious look on his face, like the matter at hand playing on the screen is quite life or death, all while trying to convey this to Dean who doesn’t care, but makes a good show of acting like it.
“Hmm.” Cas hummed in response, moving around the couch to see better, now putting two and two together. Dean had taken chairs from the kitchen and moved them in as well as shoving the couch and Cas’s reading chair over  and moving the coffee table to make room for quite an elaborate blanket fort. The pale green blanket seemed to glow from the inside where Dean had placed a lamp on the floor in the interior and shoved blankets and pillows from all over the house in.
They are sitting in the antique book shop in town, a little place called ‘Ed’s Editions’ that Cas is a regular at. Danny and Dean are down in the cars section while Cas flips through a book with illustrations by Salvador Dali. The pictures are colorful and it’s strange to see such tame drawings coming from such a master of the surreal. Cas has always quietly thought that if anyone were to paint heaven Dali would do it the most justice. He wouldn’t have been afraid of what he saw, he thinks. Or maybe he’s wrong. Cas doesn’t know. He never knew the painter.
Danny whimpered and Dean shook his head and went forward to yank back his covers and help him in bed.
“No, no! Stay here with us!” Dean implores, and Cas pulls a toy out of the milk crate and crackers and fruit and other stuff that he replaced when all Dean attempted to bring was a box of oreos and two bananas.
Dean thinks he could probably watch it forever, the people milling about all around them, the sound of the intercom blasting Christmas music above their heads.
It makes him uneasy. He likes to be sure - so he holds him till he’s asleep. Cas watches as Dean gets Daniel down to little whimpers and squeaks before putting him back down in the crib.
“Anyway.” Cas finished. “You behave?” He said, addressing Danny as they moved to the door. Danny nodded and Dean lifted him up to put him on his shoulders once they were outside.
“I think I sprained something.” Dean says, voice thick. He needs to sleep. He drove all day like an idiot and he’s getting way too old for that. Cas doesn’t reply but helps him drape his arm around his shoulders and helps him up the stairs. He kicks the door shut behind him and Dean looks up just in time to see Danny urging Faith upstairs, his hand on her back.
He’s been fussy for a few weeks and Cas is starting to honestly believe his son hates him. He feels slightly trapped; Dean is at the garage trying to get a car ready for a customer on next-day grounds, and Cas has been trying to get Daniel to settle for at least two hours.
The shades are pulled and the room is dark and cavernous and oppressively warm, and Cas does look kind of zombie-like as he stares at the screen, blinking occasionally with his head so far back in his pillow Dean is convinced it’s going to swallow him and never spit him back out.
“Dean!” Cas yells this time, and Dean laughs. He  laughs, tongue lolling on his split lip, laughs till he has to roll  over, run fingers over his heaving stomach.
“Danny’s right. You did really well. You did so well.” Cas encourages, and Faith just greedily drinks the juice and then shoves it away, looking flushed and upset despite the praise.
She’s overflowing with giggles as he flips her upside down. Cas rolls his eyes at the two of them as she laughs, her face going scarlet, and flops down onto the couch in the living room to re open his paper back. Dean notices that some disney movie is playing on the TV and that the room is scattered with legos - the big kind for little hands.
“Stop saying that!” Dean cries, “THERE’S NOTHING FOR YOU HERE! THERE’S NOTHING! I FUCKED IT UP! DON’T YOU
.” Dean asks, cleverly evading Castiel’s oncoming speech by gesturing to Castiel’s get up while he throws his newspaper to the side, studying the sheet that Castiel has draped over his clothing and the small dot the middle of his forehead.
“I know.” She sighs, looking at her toes. She plays with the edge of the rug in their bedroom and twists her finger in her hair, a nervous habit she’s had since she was small. Dean knows that - it means she’s trying not to cry.
They bought it on a whim at an estate sale forty miles away, Castiel fascinated by its old yellowed keys and the rich tone it produced, teetering indefinitely between in tune and out. He is clumsy, his fingers not complying, and though they’ve never really discussed it, Dean feels as though he was once very proficient when he was an Angel, but now, human and reduced, he sits and plunks out the notes with hesitance that grows into a steady confidence after a while.
ones, Cas had already made sure of that) and some kind of sports coat thing Sam got him last year for his birthday just for things like this. They’re on their way out the door, bundled up, and Faith playing with the end of Dean’s scarf as he hauls her towards the Impala when Dean’s phone buzzes and he pulls it out and slips it in between his ear and shoulder, opening the Impala door while he straps Faith into the car seat in the back.
“…makes teaching Sammy look like a freakin’ sunday drive…” the hunter growls between clenched teeth. Castiel tentatively places his fingers back on the wheel, squeezing it.
“Just went off at 100.” Cas replies, just as Dean reads over the numbers, placing it over by the sink as a little body bumps against him.  “Danny’s too…”
“You heard me.” Dean repeats, staring at his son. “You’re going to make a silly face at your sister or you’re going to get it.”
One time Death swung his bat and sent an asteroid careening towards the lizards, but he missed the little things poking between the hollows of the earth, the places nobody would have bothered to look. They got bigger. Turned into horses and camels and elephants and tigers and peacocks and people.
“You know, I thought you’d like it.” Cas says playfully as Dean follows, pulling his plate towards him. Dean takes a bite and chews thoughtfully. It isn’t half bad, but then again he’s always been handy around a kitchen and meager ingredients have always been part of his vocabulary from a lifetime of hotel rooms. Cas seems impressed as he drinks his wine and cuts his omelet with the side of his fork.
“I could if I didn’t have the towel on me…” Cas grumbled, but he stayed put as Dean came closer, balancing the basket of clean clothes on the back of the couch.
“Daddy, I wanna fly planes!” Daniel nearly shouts as Dean helps him back into his sneakers, all three of them having cleared the x-ray. He glances at Faith and is relieved that she’s playing with his keys in her stroller, quite fascinated by them. Now if he can just keep them in her hands and off of the floor…
“Dean.” Cas says his name so gently that it wipes away any kind of mental preparations he’d made to steel himself for saying it. “You don’t have to say anything, okay? I love you anyway.”
He was answered with silence, just a couple of birds chirping in a nearby tree and the creek burbling undisturbed.
As he hugged Cas back, Dean let out a long, content breath. And found his mind quiet. The creek burbled happily along below them, and the birds chirped obliviously in the trees, which swayed gently in a light breeze, leaves rustling. But his mind was quiet. He closed his eyes, nuzzling his face into Cas’s neck. He wanted to stay like this forever.
“Cas. I know you’re out there and you can hear me. I know Jack pulled you out of the Empty and you’re probably up there with him now. I know because I know him. And I know you. And you’re probably busy with everything, so…… but it’s been a while. And I just- it would be nice to know for sure. Just a sign or something.”
“Yeah,” Dean simply admits. He’s coloring around the words for Cas, and this is part of it. It still feels like being honest is going to kill him, but he’s fought God, upper case G, big man in the sky
Dean really wishes he could tell Cas all about his capital L gay feelings for him, because fuck. He has a lot of them. He didn’t realize a person could have that many feelings, and he really needs to figure out a way to express them, because
Sam doesn’t say anything else and doesn’t give him a hand out either. He just unlocks the back door, grabs the pizzas, and then throws the spare keys to Cas. “We’re starting with dinner as soon as I get back, and we’re not even gonna think about waiting for you two.”
“Dammit, Cas, I taught you how to break into cars, didn’t I? What does it matter that I have the keys?”
“Roger that,” Dean says, briefly stopping his shuffling around to watch his brother walk back to his own car. He doesn’t even understand how he got into the damn trunk in the first place, because he sure as hell can’t see a way out. There’s walls all around him, for god’s sake. They’re not that high but
And fuck this, fuck him, and fuck all of this to hell. Dean’s locked himself in the trunk of his car and now Cas is sitting on top of said trunk and Sammy’s going to be here in a couple of minutes and won’t ever stop making fun of him for this for as long as he lives. So, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain from a little bit of honesty. Might as well, then.
“I don’t know, I think my standard for weird is rather skewed. But I really wish you were kissing me right now.”
!” Cas cried, scrambling off of Dean, putting the tub of chocolate down on the bedside table. Dean groaned and then sat up, trying to placate Cas who was fuming.
“Daddy?” He looks down at her and loosens his grip on her arm, brings his hand up to cup her cheek. She’s only eight, he reminds himself. She doesn’t get it. She blinks at him, confused, and he rubs his thumb on her face, brushes it just under her eye.
Faith climbed onto the recliner, and curled all 5'5" of herself onto Dean’s lap, her head knocking his until she wiggled down,  finally situated on his shoulder.
“Love your laugh.” Dean reflects, Cas arching up again into another drag of Dean’s closed hand. Cas squeezes his forearm.
, and as he looks around he can’t find something very out of place. Dean turns and faces him though and smiles.
By the time she nods off he’s closed his last volume and carries her upstairs, his legs groaning the whole time, not shutting the door till he’s sure the room is safe, that the sigils are still under the rug at the foot of the bed, that - he remembers where he is and bends over to tuck the quilt under her a little more.
Cas stops in the doorway and stares at his son, his arms instinctively tightening under Danny’s legs.
“Try to sleep.” He rumbles, kissing Dean for the first time since he’s gotten home. They kiss for a while, Cas cutting it short to make him lay down.
They stand, at Daniel’s insistence, and it feels like the plane takes a million years to dock itself at the gate and for passengers to start disembarking. Dean puts a hand on Daniel’s head as he jumps up and down – they are strategically placed a few feet back so as not to get run over, but with every person who exits, Dean is pretty willing to bet that Daniel gets closer and closer to lunging for the doorway leading towards the parked jet.
Cas moves and Dean finds himself grounded by two fingers walking over his shoulder that edge and nudge under his ear and around the shell of it, brushing his short hair into place.
Dean looks up from his coffee to see Daniel jumping up and down at the kitchen table, shoveling handfuls of cheerios in his mouth, passing some of them to Faith. Dean smiles and watches as a round little ‘o’ sticks to Faith’s cheek as she looks at him doe-eyed and then back to  Daniel, opening her hand for more cereal.
Dean nodded once, still smiling, his fist curled loosely on the fabric of Cas’s jacket. They settled into silence. Dean rolled his other arm around and turned to Cas.
Cas rolls his hips up to meet each thrust, kissing viciously, earnestly, and Dean reaches between the two of them, fisting around Cas’s dick again.
“The cedars of Lebanon…” He says softly and travels up to his thigh, hairs tickling at his cheek. “…okavango delta…”
Sam stares at Daniel and Daniel stares back, his green eyes huge, occupying an obscene amount of space on his round, fat, face.
Dean remained silent as Cas looked at him, as sincerely and earnestly as he’d ever looked at him in his life.
It all dissolves into a grumbling match and Castiel is still minorly confused, but he makes amends by passing Dean one of his presents and smiling at him. Dean really doesn’t know why he got so annoyed though. Probably because Sam’s right - that kind of shit
They get back to the house and Dean parks the Impala and watches Cas take Faith up to bed where Dean hopes she stays properly knocked out, Danny having woken up when they pulled into the driveway, staggering along, Cas’s arm around his shoulders. Dean sets the alarm while he shrugs out of his jacket and makes sure everything is right before he follows, passing the pot of soup forgotten in the sink. He picks up Polly, even though she grumbles a bit before licking at his chin and wagging her little stumpy tail, and carries her to the second floor. Back upstairs they find Danny halfway on the mattress, having collapsed into the pillow with one foot still touching the floor. Polly wiggles and Dean let’s her gently down on Danny’s bed, where she usually sleeps.
A star threw down its net, pulling in prayers, and as it did it glanced at the valley – it was washed gold with grain and tall trees. It was a peaceful place full of life, and every tree bore fruit. The star sang praises to the fruit of the vine.
“It’s becoming a problem.” Castiel’s voice is low and Dean let’s his throat open up in a groan as Castiel dips his head down. They kiss, and it’s all tugs and tongue and nips, and Dean’s never complained about the sex, but it hasn’t been like this in a good three months. He hasn’t been this worked up, this
And a body ain’t nothin’ but a river and a man’s soul ain’t nothin’ but a catfish. Some believe when you die your soul comes heavin’ outta your mouth so it can be tossed back in the water. But you gotta wonder, how many heartaches does it take to make a catfish outta someone’s soul? How many pains it take to make a soul into somethin’ like that? All blue and gaspin’? Like somethin’ that ain’t workin’ proper. Some poor deprived thing.
“Go to sleep Danny.” He whispered, softer than before, watching his son pout. Dean reached down and picked up Danny’s stuffed puppy dog where it had fallen out of his bed and held it in front of his face.
They trick-or-treat for two hours, going all the way to the back of the neighborhood, and by the end of it, Daniel’s pillowcase is fat with candy and his feet are dragging.
For Dean, it makes Cas’s antics tolerable and all the more endearing. After all, how often does Dean get to see an angel of God standing watch at the front door, clutching a bowl of snickers and waiting in a bed sheet with an expression so serious that he doesn’t even look like he’s having fun? The laughs only increase as Cas starts timing the trick-or-treater’s and begins opening the door before they can ring the bell, making the all scream usually.
She shrieked and Dean shook his head as Faith rocked back and sat on the floor, Cas pulling the towel off of his shoulders to put over her.
A few hours past and Daniel remained quiet. When Cas got home he was naturally frantic, machine gunning questions at Dean about what had happened only to rush upstairs and check for himself that Daniel was indeed alive and not in small pieces everywhere. Once he had assured this he spent the rest of the evening worrying over him while Dean fixed dinner for he and Faith and looked after her.
“OUT CAME THE SUN!” Danny roared, his arms bursting out on either side. Dean had to bite back his chuckle. Danny’s enthusiasm at that part always tickled him.
Cas is arranging donuts on a plate and pulling the cider out of the microwave, dancing on the balls of his feet.
"Come back and I will tell you more!” She calls, taking up her twiggy broom, “And tell your Mama to do what the note says and your brother’s toothache will not be so bad!"
overcome by love for Dean, but in this instance it magnified in a way it had never magnified before. It all seemed to spill out of him and pool at his feet. It manifested in Cas’s shaking hand as it gripped Dean’s forearm suddenly and firmly.
“Just let me lead, it’s easy, you’ll get the hang of it –“ He steps like that girl taught him, and Cas jumps a little, tightening his hand on Dean’s waist, smiling weirdly at Dean before he goes back to looking at their feet.
That is, until he’s putting away the 'good china’ which, believing he’d ever have 'good china’ would be like asking him if he believed in Santa at age fifty, and he hears the sound of Cas dragging out the record player that Bobby gifted to him, and the groan and crackle of the needle on the vinyl.
“Ahh.” Dean responds, putting an arm around the back of Castiel’s chair so he can rub Cas’s shoulder and neck. “So, do we go up with him, like last year?”
Castiel seems to consider this and Faith stirs, whimpering, and Cas can feel his resolve crumbling because he’s exhausted and worried.
Dean gives in, falls to the ground, and rolls, Danny on top of him, still trying to get at the football. Faith watches in concern and then laughs, running a few clumsy steps and giggling, Polly ever the shepherd, making sure she doesn’t stray.
Cas dives into the gesture, nipping at Dean’s bottom lip, his hands sliding up Dean’s ribs, under his flannel over shirt. Their noses bump and then smush together, both of them getting enthusiastic until Dean breaks away and raises his eyebrows, satisfied with the debauched state of Cas’s mouth.
He lies still in the bed, breathing, letting his body catch up, and is surrounded by the faint chords of Cas at the piano.
“Well, your Papa said something about hot cider and donuts earlier, so you think that sounds like a good idea?” They’re halfway back home now and Daniel nods excitedly.
The baby gurlges and reaches for a toy that rattles with some interior bell as he brushes his little fat fingers against it. Dean gently pushes it towards his outstretched hand and smiles when Danny grips it and pulls it to him, already sticking one end in his mouth.
“Fay-Fay did you like it?” Daniel says, staring at his sister who squirms and begs to be let down from Dean’s arms. When he does she goes straight to Daniel and hugs him, hanging on his side.
Cas puts the phone back into the center console, wipes at his face and shakes his hair out. He takes a deep breath, and puts his hands back on the wheel.
! You said you didn’t!” Cas says sternly and with a hint of pathetic sadness to his voice, appearing again in front of the couch. Dean looks at him, the picture of innocence and breaks off half of the cookie sandwiched between his lips.
“I’ll clean it up. Danny wants to watch “The Great Pumpkin” anyway and he can’t do that from the kitchen. It won’t hurt anything, Cas.” Dean puts on his best convincing face and Cas sighs, not able to stand up to it.
“You give em’ the old one-two?” Dean smirks and Cas goes back to the window, nods, and then joins Dean at the table, nibbling on his bagel that’s started to go cold.
“We’ll be there in like, 15.” Dean says as he backs expertly out of the driveway, cranking the heater on full blast. Faith sings something behind him that he can’t make out and Cas laughs, hearing it as well.
The reaction is expected, Castiel’s face goes from irritation to just blank, as if Dean has said something so stupid he can’t be bothered to be even remotely surprised. He just stares at Dean, daring him to continue.  Dean does, with confidence.
“Danny come here so I can give this to you…” Cas says distantly, watching Faith with one eye and measuring out more of the over-the-counter cough syrup with the other, having wasted no time in fishing it out of the plastic bags that Dean has brought in. Its seven o’clock at night and what Dean pushed off as just allergies the day before is a full-fledged
“Ah- Ahhhh!” She cries and that’s all Dean needs before he is rushing for her as she holds her arms up at him, the little palms red and scraped.
wants something. Cas chuffs in annoyance when Dean worms his way near him, and Cas hisses when Dean’s cold feet fidget around, pushing up Cas’s sweats for the warm skin revealed, and Cas snaps at him when he tries to eat part of his Toblerone, but it’s worth it, Dean thinks, to revel in a Cas who smells like their blankets and is trying to watch his movie, but that’s difficult because Dean keeps asking about the plot every ten seconds. Dean’s a born tease, and Cas takes everything literally, and it’s more fun than anything else, sometimes to be childish and stupid and prod at Cas till he lifts his arm and let’s Dean nuzzle into his chest while Dean plays with the foil from the candy bar.
Dean slings her back up and grabs a beer from the fridge before following Cas’s example by wandering towards the singing cartoons on the television. Faith whines to get down and he lets her, watching as she gallops to the legos and sits down, immediately resuming whatever it was. Every few seconds she pauses and watches the movie, her mouth falling open, only to snap back to her legos, talking to herself.
For months this continued with Dean none the wiser (to Castiel’s knowledge), and soon, it came so easily to Cas that he didn’t even realize he was doing it anymore.
They settle into a cycle after a while and Dean stands and goes back to the master bedroom looking triumphant. He’s about to shove his victory in Cas’s face when he realizes that Cas is knocked out - he’s dead asleep, mouth partly open, on Dean’s pillow, a pair of Dean’s socks still in his hand, snoring away.
Dean stands, staggers, and falls into the Kia  before pawing for the phone that he shoves in his pocket. His legs give  out a moment later and he’s back to square one – hands, knees, pavement.
Cas brushed the emotion away and dropped to all fours, climbing in after his family, all five of them sitting under the magic of the fort, spirited away to another place in the middle of their living room.
“GET OFF! GO! GO HOME!” He shouts, waving his arms a little, and Dean snorts into his coffee until Cas gets too cold and comes inside, looking satisfied.
, they sighed in relief, like when wind shook boughs, when Castiel saw whirlpools of blossoms fall about his human head in beautiful mathematical symphonies. He looked out with his great blue eye at them, motes of flowers, and dust, and spinning schools of sardines, and pillars of whales hunting them, and murmurations of starlings, and funneling clouds, and the whirling columns of flamingos in the Laguna Colorada who were the offspring of raptors, and were born gray and turned pink, and Peacocks with perfectly spaced feathers.
Someday someone is going to ask him what this was like and Dean isn’t going to really explain it. He’s probably going to stand there like an idiot. Someday Cas is going to ask him
“Something wrong?” He says, going back to his peeling. A hand suddenly appears in his line of sight, pushing the knife to the cutting board.
Danny grabs Sam’s other hand with one of his own and Sam smiles in a shitty attempt to hide his obvious delight.
“Yeah, of course.” Dean admonished, gruffly, smiling. He hadn’t seen Cas all day – studying for a teaching degree (or at least pretending to because when you are previously a millenniums year old celestial wavelength things seem to come easier in academics) will do that to someone, and Cas was looking especially good in Dean’s old flannel rolled over one of his own growing t-shirt collection. Cas, though, seemed to have other plans as he pushed Dean away from him once he’d stood up, putting the trap back in the bag, successfully stopping Dean’s advances.
“W-wait…just wait.” Cas says, unbuttoning them for Dean, sliding the zipper down, palm raking over the growing bulge in Dean’s boxers. “Impatient…” He kisses Dean again as the jeans kick off the end of Dean’s feet. They kiss for a long time, tongues sliding over one another’s until Dean cants his hips just as Cas does and Cas lifts full off of Dean’s chest, rocking back, spine arched.
“So you don’t forget.” Cas whispered, eyes darkened, but sweet. Dean watched as Cas bent over him, trying not to smudge his work, and drew things on Dean’s cheeks.
“Ok, we’re off!” Cas says, holding the door open as Daniel darts out the door. Dean waves to them from the kitchen table where he is currently trying to coax Faith into eating left over grilled chicken and squash.
“Yeah.” Faith responds, walking straight into Castiel’s waiting arms, Danny waiting to hold Dean’s hand again, snuffling. The house smells like the soup Cas made while Dean was busy playing bath monitor, and only a few lights are on. The four make their way to the Impala, sliding in, and the heater is blasting, the legos in the vents rattling around. Castiel closes the door, one arm around Faith’s back as they settle back into the give of the leather, the other around Danny who is draped halfway onto his lap, leaning on his sister who is too tired to complain. Dean eases her out of the driveway, fishing for a radio station, settling for Christmas Carols because it’s November, and turns the volume down to a low hum. The old-version of Silent Night comes on, and a Bing Crosby number, and out of the corner of his eye Dean can see that Castiel’s eyes are closed too as he bundles Faith against his chest in a huge quilt they’d bought at an antique sale a few months back (yes. They are
"They are.” He says simply before looking back at the shadows he can see past the curtains, chuckling tiredly. “You know, they try to tell you what it will be like when you’re a parent, and you try to understand, but - ” He stops, hearing his little birds laughing, “ - the real thing is really indescribable."
“I meant this whole ‘you love me I love you thing’ we’ve got going on.” He smiles, “You work it well.”
“It was the only thing I could think of…” Cas bit, stifling a noise before he started to really get into it, his sides shaking. Dean laughed too, both of them stupidly staring at each other, Cas’s eyes squeezing shut and his lips curling back over his teeth, grinning into the laugh. He rested the back of his hand against his forehead, to cover his eyes, unable too look at Dean’s chocolate cat face without falling to pieces all over.
“Well? Did I do good?” He asked, putting a hand on Cas’s knee and slipping it up over his thigh. He pinched the knit material of Cas’s pajama shorts in between his fingers and snapped it against Cas’s leg while Cas looked inside the tub and then cautiously stuck his finger in it. Dean impatiently watched as he swiped out some chocolate and then stuck it in his mouth, staring at the side still. He sucked his finger thoughtfully and then licked his lip, lifting his gaze, letting his finger trail against his lower lip
“My poor little birds.” Cas says quietly, sounding equally as miserable as the kids his voice stuffed with worry. Cas lifts Faith up off the counter and starts rubbing her back; she goes limp and still except for the little hiccups and struggling breaths she emits every few seconds. She coughs, and Cas doesn’t even seem to notice, except to wince in pain at the sound. Danny gravitates back to Dean, turning around to lean his back against Dean’s legs, watching Cas rock Faith. He scratches at his stomach under his jammies and Dean strokes the sides of his face and his hot forehead.
said “Sammy, that’s not normal. No one eats freakin’ ketchup on an egg mcmuffin…” and we just cracked up because he was, you know, hunting.” Dean laughs, staring at Cas’s eyes like he’s going to make fun of him. Cas smiles instead.
“See you at home.” Dean repeats, his heart swelling as he looks back down at Faith. He chuckles quietly and bends down to kiss her, smoothing the hair out of her face again. “Monkey…” He says sweetly, her rosy cheek on her shoulder, fast asleep.
“PAPA!” Daniel wails, and Dean watches as his son plows headfirst into Castiel’s stomach, nearly sending him backwards into the lady behind him. Thankfully the woman appreciates Daniel’s enthusiasm and happily goes around, the rest of the exiting passengers following her lead.
. He’s back, and he can hear his voice and watch him move. Watch the tiniest flex of his fingers around Daniel’s, the curve of his mouth as he says:
“Is that accepted behavior? The idea of Halloween is to enjoy the festivities while being something you are not.” Cas deadpans and Dean flips the top of the paper down again, only his green eyes exposed.
Maybe it’s because of all the unnecessary touching that Castiel has been doing since got home – the hands on his arms, on his back, a thigh, a knee here or there – but he’s been formulating a few ideas since dinner that weren’t exactly appropriate for conversation with a two year old. Leave it to Castiel to make everything appear an accident, but Dean knows better. Oh, how he
“What does that mean?” Leticia asks after a moment, because that is such an odd thing to say. The bruja laughs a little more and waves her over, ducking into her house.
“Love.” Castiel looks up at Dean’s eyes. “How it paints a different kind of picture to an individual’s life. Gives them…how do you say it, an different perception of reality. One that is more 'optimistic’.”
“Just went off at 100.” Cas replies, just as Dean reads over the numbers, placing it over by the sink as a little body bumps against him.  “Danny’s too…”
“Make your scariest shark face!” Cas directs and Daniel continues his pout before moving his hands up in claws. Dean laughs into the smile he’s got going for Cas’s Nikon. He’s not sure that’s exactly correct, but Daniel pulls it off well, his face twisted in a sneer, teeth bared.
Dean’s hand falls to his thigh, squeezes appreciatively and pats or rubs a few times in the page-turning hush of Cas thumbing through the weather reports. Rain on Tuesday and it’s going to start getting colder. A shuffle of newspaper.
“C’mere.” Dean whispers, and Cas sits forward. They slide their hands over each other, wet skin slick, and Cas buries himself in Dean’s mouth. Water slips out of the tub onto the floor, but it’s when Dean knocks his knee on the porcelain that they climb out. They trail wet footprints onto the tile and Dean towels Cas’s hair into a frizzy mess, Cas kissing him the whole time. Dean towels at Cas’s shoulders, his back, sighing as Cas kisses his neck, the hollow of his collar bone, the inside of his elbow, his palm. Dean drops the towel and Cas blows out the candles. It’s pitch black in the room and Cas sits on the edge of the bed and holds his arms out
Dean goes to the play room again where Daniel and Faith are speaking some weird kid language and moving hot wheels around the couch cushions, and Dean sits down to join them.
Cas raised the view finder to his eye and clicked the shutter on the sleek silver top experimentally. Dean sighed and reached for it, only to have Cas stop walking and lean back, away from Dean’s grabbing fingers.
From behind the red velvet curtain woman in a tight corset wheels a covered table towards center stage, smiling and waving at the excited audience, bringing the table to a stop beside the showman, between him and Castiel. The spotlight intensifies when the house lights dim, leaving Castiel, the table, and the showman in focus. He rubs his hands together and wiggles his eyebrows at the hushed crowd, cracking his fingers, the brim of his tall hat sliding just a little bit down his forehead.
“You look like a little boy.” He comments and Dean snorts, dumping water on Cas’s head, making Cas close his eyes abruptly. When he opens them he rubs a little at his face, wiping the water away, and Dean gently grabs his wrist and pulls it away.
He palms absently at Cas’s hair and Cas kisses the inside of his elbow, and Dean’s face tenses with unnamed emotion. He feels the broad sweep of sensation when Cas let’s his head stay there, tucked in the crook of his elbow.
the problem was when Sam got back he had handed the change to Cas who had, and Sam had to make sure he wasn’t seeing things, somehow deliberately dropped a quarter which rolled over the hardwood and under the couch where Dean sat. Deliberately because the rest of the coins were balanced easily in his palm, but one had somehow ‘slipped’ from between the cracks of his fingers with a small separation of the digits.
“Cute kid.” Dean commented, watching the family interact as Castiel’s face went from curious to scrutinizing, as if he was trying desperately to find an answer in the way the young family seemed to move as a unit closer to the curb, the mother’s arm linked with the father’s, the little boy – Charlie – perched on his shoulders, looking around in wonder.
"I don’t.” Castiel says, and Inias looks up. Cas shakes his head. “I really don’t. Not even for a second.”
“They back? Already?” Dean says, interested, and Castiel shakes his head in disdain and moves for the door.
A roar of laughter erupts in Castiel’s ears and he instinctively tightens his fingers on the smooth wooden arms of the chair he’s in, looking around. The woman next to him is chuckling behind her gloved hand, smiling, and he can feel the eyes of people all around turned on him.
much and Dean won’t have an answer. They don’t make things big enough to compare what it all is – what this is, this man under him and this skin and those arms and those hands. Cas trails his fingers to Dean’s face absently and Dean kisses them, eyes closing.
It happened after a particularly nice dinner – at Bobby’s house. Sam had to run out to the store for more beer and had borrowed a twenty from Dean. That wasn’t the problem; what
“He’s gone again!” Dean exclaimed as Faith paused her giggling, resuming her big-eyed stare at her other daddy. Dean leaned over the couch and shook his head at her. “Where’d he get to? Where did your silly Papa go?”
For four days it had been this way, and by that Thursday, Cas was at his breaking point and Dean knew that he would need to do something and do it fast or Cas was going to end up throwing the bitch fit of the century.
The airport is, naturally, packed, and Dean has second thoughts about bringing Faith with them as he navigates security with Daniel about to hyperventilate with the excitement of it all. Between the rapid fire questions from Daniel that Dean can’t answer and Faith crooning her strange baby-talk
Cas sings the hymns soft and low and reverent, the ones he must know by heart from millenniums of singing them. Some Dean recognizes, others he doesn’t. Sometimes Cas slips into Hebrew, other times the bits of Enochian that Cas can recall on his best days.
“Ok, we’ll get you home…” Dean whispered, scratching lightly at the short hairs at the base of Daniel’s skull.
They file back to their seats and Dean sits with his children shared between Cas and his laps, watching the rest of the program run its course. Cas leans into him and Daniel moves his arm so Faith can scoot under it and put her thumb in her mouth, watching the rest of the students perform.
Dean twitches a little at how deep Cas’s voice is, eyelids heavy, mind wandering, arms thrown back over his pillow. His knuckles brush the headboard as he shifts a little towards Cas in their bed, trying to entertain Cas’s late-night thought before he passes out entirely.
“You ok by yourself?” Dean asked, and he knew he was hovering but couldn’t really stop the question once he had started to worry. Daniel nodded vacantly struggling to pull off his shirt, not saying anything in protest when Dean helped him before he left, cracking the door so he could hear if anything went wrong. Dean jogged downstairs and fetched a steel pot from the kitchen and brought it back to Daniel’s room and putting it down on the floor beside his bed before pulling the unmade covers back and re arranging the pillows so that the mattress somehow resembled a bed and not the strange tangle of blankets it currently was when Daniel woke up that morning. After straightening the sheets he heard Daniel slosh out of the tub and rummaged through his drawers for clean clothes, setting them right inside on the bathroom counter, Daniel currently sitting on the edge of the tub with a towel around his waist.
“Don’t be stupid.” He rushes, and then pulls Cas’s hand up to his mouth sucking a finger in. Cas jackknifes, hearing the pop of the lid on the lube and then it’s
“You think you are really funny, don’t you.” Cas drawls, giving him one last pointed look before turning around and heading back into the kitchen.
One day, Cas will be gone and he won’t come back. He’ll have to push his little bird out of the nest. But he’ll make sure they can really fly – and if they can’t, he’ll be right there waiting, with arms open, right by Dean, to catch the way he was taught to so many times.
“I know you don’t understand, and that’s alright.” Castiel says reassuringly. “I don’t expect you to."
“You want me to clean you up?” he teased, pushing up with his feet so that he slid up a few inches. Dean stared down at him.
“Cas?” He dipped his finger along the ridge of the of the cup while he did so, testing his tongue on it. He grimaced.
to these things.” Dean didn’t miss the mischievous gleam in Cas’s eyes as he said it, and he nodded in understanding.
Dean gets his kiss too, but it’s quick as Cas goes back to messing with the camera and Dean can look around at the pulled curtain on the stage and the giant, bare, Christmas tree that sits beside it, ready and waiting.
“There you go!” She’d told him, and after wards, after they’d done another dance, one he was more proficient at, she’d kissed his cheek and called him sugar, like good Texas girls did.
Cas closes the book and Dean hears him slide it onto the table next to the rocking chair, but Cas doesn’t stop. He’s holding Daniel and staring at the window over Danny’s crib, watching the stars wink at him from beyond the dark blue curtains, content to hold Danny’s warm, sleeping little form in his arms for as long as he can. He stays that way for a few more moments and then stands, and Dean hears him shift Danny and then move to the crib, rustling the blankets as he slips Danny in among them, the baby noises and little whine as Danny immediately turns onto his stomach and folds his legs up under him.
Cas sighs again and hears Dean go back inside, pulling a chair over to the wall so he can take the batteries out of the alarm.
The blanket they’re using isn’t checkered - it’s really just an old bedspread they forgot they had in their linen closet and it’s not a basket so much as one of Dean’s old milk crates stuffed with food, but it works.
She sobs into his shirt and he wonders what she sees when she thinks bad guys. Maybe bank robbers or the monsters of her imagination; the scary things in books sometimes or on cartoons. Bad people with knives and guns. Who knows. She must imagine them with big claws and sharp teeth digging into his foot, twisting his ankle, swiping at him with their gnarled fingers, punching him with uncaring fists.
Electricity jumps from Cas’s skin and Dean can’t hold on much longer with how intently Cas stares at him, and it will never stop shocking him, when he comes, stuttering below him, silent and his limbs jerking in response as he paints trails of sticky white between them.
“Holy shit!” Dean shoots up off of the couch, his fishing dream cut abruptly short by the horrible screeching he’s now hearing, and knocks the standing lamp over on the way to the kitchen. “CAS!"
“Inside voices, Danny!” He reminds as Faith stands up and toddles to him, collapsing into his lap with brightly colored candy to shove into his hands. “Yes, thank you!” Castiel redirects, taking the candy and putting it back up on the table. Faith sits on his knees and stares at him, still holding more candy to offer and Cas takes it all, eyebrows raising. “Thank you Faith, yes, thank you.”
“Yeah, we’re gonna go drive a little bit. You wanna do that?” He says straightening the sweater a little more. She nods and then pads to Danny’s room, swaying on her feet.
“Fuck, baby.” Dean cries, “Fuck, fuck.” And Cas let’s his hands fall to Dean’s shoulders, squeezing, until one moves down to his thigh where Dean’s own unoccupied hand is positioned for leverage. Cas’s fingers wrap around Dean’s and squeeze in time, and he stares up at Dean’s face, eyes wide. He doesn’t say anything, but his mouth is slack and open and he huffs with Dean, the two of them slamming together.
“Fuuuuuuuck.” He says, long and rumbling, his hand on Dean’s wrist. “Yes.” He opens his eyes, bright blue ringing the thick black of his pupil, locking them on Dean’s. “Mmmm.” He mewls, “Yes, Dean.”
“Don’t you dare!” he said, shoving the fridge door shut, raising an accusing hand. Cas’s lips curled slightly upward and he tensed. Dean pointed at him, grinning, his threat a barked laugh. “Don’t you
Cas takes Daniel’s hands and they meet halfway, Faith registering it’s Cas and starting to squirm and squeal.
with it - something Dean hadn’t been able to provide. Cas had really liked his presents too, but he hadn’t stared at them like he did that record.
some say, if you watch the first rain, a man will step from the shore, and another will carry his lamp for him through the dark.
“THERE YOU ARE! I missed you!” He says and she collapses onto his chest; luckily the towel keeps him from getting too wet.
They tangle together, huffing, and then Cas pushes Dean away, rethinks, grabs him by the collar and kisses him again, and then
“That should hold him for what, all of five seconds?” Dean says, sliding his eyes to Cas who is popping containers of baby food.
“Oh…” Cas groans as Dean rubs his lower back, laughing as Cas arches his neck back and flops his arms uselessly on the rumpled sheets.
“Do you want me to make you some tea?” Cas said, his words muddled, and Daniel shook his head again, taking a step closer. Dean knew what he was doing as soon as he did and Cas seemed to as well, both of them scooting so that there was space in the middle stretched between them. Dean lifted up the cover and Daniel shed his own blanket and climbed over him, knee knocking against Dean’s ribs, but Dean stifled his complaint. Cas pulled the sheets up over Daniel and then Dean lifted the comforter over that, Cas reaching down to pull a pillow off of the floor.
“Oh.” Castiel gasps and Dean does it again, working at his neck, Castiel hissing, shifting around. Dean can almost hear his toes curling on the carpet as he squirms.
Dean goes to him, and they roll down on to the covers, and Cas hold him and brushes his lips over the little spare drops, chases them, and then kisses Dean with a sigh. Dean slides them, moves over him, crouching, and decides he could watch him forever like this – in the dark. His eyes adjust and he makes out the outcrop of Cas’s hair on the grey comforter, the bone-white glow of his skin. Cas arches his arms over Dean’s neck and then down his sides. It’s somewhere in between Cas’s navel and his chest that Dean calls him pretty, and then Cas’s breath hitches and the muscles stutter against Dean’s mouth.
“I should open a massage parlor.” Dean comments offhandedly and Cas doesn’t respond so much as makes some blissed out noise and stretch his legs out till his toes pop. Dean kneads his skin a little more, getting the kinks out, and then Cas shifts, rolling over towards Dean. He pinches Dean’s cheek and sleepily smiles at him, reaching up to comb through the top of his hair, playfully yanking it down over Dean’s forehead.
She passes everyone on the way there and they all seem to know, because everyone always seems to know when you are going to the little adobe house on the edge of town, with the huge cactus in the front and the windows clear in their baked mud frames, and the big twiggy broom leaning on door.
” His voice diminished and he looked appropriately embarrassed, face flushing. His hands dropped away from Dean. “I must have forgotten. I’m so sorry Dean. Really I am.”
“Hey, what are you doing up?” Dean demanded, Cas having scooted downstairs. Danny rubbed at his eyes and stared at his dad with all his four year old face muddled in confusion.
“Dean - what?” Was all Cas could say, trying to unhinge his fingers from Dean’s shirt before it tore. Dean smiled, as if what he’d just done was the most natural reaction to Castiel’s apology, which it certainly
“I don’t know how we’re going to get her down.” Cas whispers. “She hasn’t slept at all today, and you know she didn’t last night either. She was coughing too much, and she wouldn’t settle, even when I went in there.” Dean watches him tiredly press his head on Faith’s, and he unconsciously starts doing it – the swaying thing. Back and forth, whenever he holds her, just twisting his hips side to side, and she huffs in response. It’s true – with Dean working the next day, Cas had gotten up to lay with her, but she had coughed and cried and carried on until morning where she drifted in a stupor for hours, shivery and sick. Dean watches the movement that Cas always does, one undeterred even by his tiredness, before the idea dawns on him.
“Dean.” Castiel croaks, fingers scrambling, raking through Dean’s short hair. Dean digs his nails into Cas’s skin and Castiel rocks forward on his lap, the air hot around them, the TV still casting a blue-white glow on their dim bedroom. Dean knows he couldn’t imagine the stiff drag of something on his stomach if he tried, but he doesn’t have to, and it just turns him up that much more.
“I’m fine.” He kind of sobs, but he doesn’t mean to say that, and the tears are starting to really blur up the view he has out the windshield. He gasps, “I’m fine.”
They shout with joy, and do it again, until he chases and they run; he runs, they follow. Around the yard, Polly up and nipping at his heels, herding her humans, and Cas tripping over his wet jeans that are starting to slide off, soaked with water. When Danny nearly pantses him he’s laughing so hard he can’t breathe - and it’s scary and wonderful to be swallowing the sun instead of staring into it, to be falling and tumbling into the grass, landing on arms that will probably bruise with the impacts but will always get up again. The drops that come to him aren’t pitfalls, they are covered in little hands and legs and fingers in his hair and bright little eyes staring down on him with such happiness and gratefulness that he is there. Another pair of eyes that watch him from the sidelines, eyes that wouldn’t let him get hurt again. Not like before.
Dean knows Cas could boot him easily if he wanted to, but the hand that is starting to stroke his hair is saying otherwise, and as they settle together, and Dean inevitably falls asleep, they both know that Dean will complain to Sammy and Sammy will tell Dean to make Cas stop.
“A star looked on the river, and it saw the beautiful water, and it watched the man’s heart flow across the land. It grew beautiful things - strong trees to make strong houses. The star watched the river for so long, and it came closer and closer, because it had never seen something so beautiful as the water, and it saw light dancing on the surface and it had never seen something so lovely. It got so close to the river it could see the catfish at the bottom, and it fell in love."
Dean shows Daniel the message and this pacifies him for the moment, his eyes scanning the darkened window for Castiel’s plane. A little while later the plane comes into view and Daniel wiggles excitedly, Faith reaching out to tug on his sweatshirt.
The  next moment he’s looking at the shadow of the bookcase where Inias previously stood. Cas waits for a moment, and then goes outside.
Dialing the number is a pain though, and Sam is  probably asleep by now, so Dean opts to lie down in the back of the  Impala, feet on the edge of the window, everything coming loose in one  long unhindered groan. Blinking at the dark ceiling before he slips  away, Dean thinks about what Cas said – what his mind told Cas to say.  It’s not like he ever listened to Cas over other people. Something  aches, something deep down, about that - something that resonates ‘
“Feel that…” Dean tells him, “…fuck I missed you…wanted….” Cas shakes his head when Dean gives a well-timed
“Is it not a good song?” Dean continues, stepping nearer, both of them watching the needle and the record.
Daniel buries himself in Cas’s middle and Cas hugs him back, stooping down to kiss the top of Daniel’s head and smile into his hair.
but if you are not careful, you will be swept away by the current - love can carve canyons, and the love of a star is no different.
“Come on! Keep up!” Cas mocks, and this just makes Dean laugh even harder, their fingers tangling together as the song moves into the bridge.
“Si, si, I have the medicine. It is right where I left it. Your brother will not die of a toothache, and you walked here.” She pauses, and looks at Leticia, her eyes dancing with light, even though the sun is outside, and the house is shady. “You walked here with such a heavy heart. You keep having such a heavy heart and you will turn into a catfish.”
” Cas continues, turning a page. Dean’s heart melts as Danny says something, his words garbled and rough from sleepiness and the shadow moves across the wall again as Cas rocks, back and forth.
“One and two and one and two and…” They shuffle quick and Cas nearly knocks over a bucket full of nails, Dean pulling him out of the way just in time, laughing like an idiot.
“You’re ok.” Cas reminds her, shutting the door as Dean walks to the kitchen, pulling her off of his hip and in front of him, tossing her a little bit. As he walks he brings her stomach up to his mouth and blows on it, which makes her laugh and squirm.
to hide them. You just shoved them back in the box.” Cas gestures at the container, shaking his head at Dean’s stupidity like it’s something to be marveled at, “Dean, you just put the box
“When Sammy was little my Dad would drive him around in the Impala when he wouldn’t go down. Worked like a charm.”
It was then that Dean heard the nearly imperceptible sound of a fork hitting a plate. Dean turned slowly towards Cas and watched as Cas hovered a piece of cherry pie right in front of his mouth.
“Sorry!” Dean snickers between bites, licking his fingers when he’s done. Cas shakes his head and jerks his head towards the living room.
“I know it’s a big decision. I’m sensitive to that – but Dean.” Cas stepped even closer, wrapping a hand around Dean’s shoulder right behind his ear.
“Game still on?” he asked as he strolled into the living room and flung himself onto the couch, untwisting the cap on the blue sport’s drink.
“Ok…” Dean whispers, stroking Daniel’s stomach, “Ok, Papa needs to go to sleep now or he’s going to kill someone, so you just be cool."
Dean’s favorite part is coming up, the part where Cas’s voice gets so soft that it’s like every word is a brush against the air, the most soothing, wonderful, intimate thing, laced with love and gentleness that makes it almost unfathomable that he was a warrior of God for milleniums on end. One who chose to give that up and rock Dean’s baby and read him stories at night.
“What’s wrong? Where are you?” Dean demands, and he can hear him moving into a room with less noise. Cas laughs because  there’s nothing really
"I’ll fix you something,” picking up the pencil to finish his puzzle. A sugar lump of laughter when Cas glances at the Marmaduke - “he looks like Sam…”. It is so nice to be resigned in this way. Resigned to Dean fixing him an egg. A piece of toast. Cold grapes.
“Huh.” Dean says, looking up at Castiel through hooded eyes, steam rising around his face. Cas tips his head in confusion.
“Uh…” Sam starts, putting a cautious hand out towards Daniel’s stomach to pat it the way he’s seen Dean do. “…hi there.” He continues and Daniel blinks at him and kicks again, before craning to look at the massive hand now covering his jersey-cotton clad abdomen. Sam pats his round tummy and Danny flails his hands till they land on top of Sam’s fingers. Sam let’s him pull at them and then lifts his heavy palm off of the baby to bring them to his face. Daniel goes cross eyed and squeezes his fingers, opening and closing his fat hand over Sam’s large knuckles.
“Of course little man.” He says, clicking play on the menu screen, listening to the familiar jazzy piano of the Peanuts gang as the movie starts.
When it’s done, on the way out of the parking lot, Daniel stops Dean before he buckles Faith in and tugs on his jacket.
He can feel the smile through the phone that Dean gives him, knows he’s probably ducked his head, shyly staring at the floor.
“You look like it.” Dean answered and Daniel laughed weakly before clutching his stomach with a whine. Dean touched his shoulder and squeezed it. “Let’s get you upstairs - get you in the tub or something and then I’ll set you up down here, ok?”
Castiel seems to consider this and Faith stirs, whimpering, and Cas can feel his resolve crumbling because he’s exhausted and worried.
Dean dwells on the pain for a while, on the throb  of his head and his bruised hands and the split lip he’s still worrying.  Talking has opened it up, and blood oozes out under the tip of his  tongue as he worries it.
The school’s cafeteria- turned-auditorium is packed with kids and parents, but thankfully Cas is wearing red, so it’s easier to spot him and there, beside him, is an empty chair, seemingly for Dean, Faith to occupy their laps to save room. Cas is messing with the camcorder and looks up when Dean sits down and situates Faith on his knees. Faith gets the first kiss, but she deserves it with how pretty she looks and though Dean is reluctant to let her he allows her to cross over to Cas’s lap and settle there, watching everything with wonder.
people now.).  He rocks, even now, just at his waist, back and forth and she stares at Dean and the landscape out the window with cracked eyes, but as they drive, Dean sees her eyes droop with the lull of the engine and the sound of the wheels. Cas’s other hand is busy smoothing Danny’s cheek and hair over and over in slow circles, and Dean smiles because Danny is already out like a light only ten feet down their street.
Then Dean didn’t really have much time to do much thinking because Cas was laving his tongue over Dean’s skin, erasing his work with more finesse then was probably necessary.
"So, I’m thinking we should fry this turkey…” Dean says conversationally, and he raises his eyebrows at Cas who rolls his eyes and elbows him lightly in the side.
Castiel looked in fascination at his human hand. Not exactly the same thing as it was even a millisecond ago, shedding cells by the millions.
He doesn’t realize he’s crying until he sees the splash over the faint pink of a magic marker heart on the back of his hand, placed there by a girl who is nearly thirteen  years old and wants everyone to know. There are wrappers shoved in the pocket behind the driver’s seat. They are wild berry poptarts because those are the only ones a certain sixteen year old will eat.
“It’s ok monkey, no more medicine.” Danny tells her, his nasally voice trying to be light. He tickles her leg and Faith manages a wet giggle.
“Really?” Cas grumbles before kissing him again, Dean pushing him up on the workbench next to the radio that still spits honky tonk jukebox tunes, Cas’s knees knocking on Dean’s sides.
“What?” He asks, soft. They are at the lake house. The curtains shift with the breeze carrying the sound of the wind chimes on the porch and a dove calls low and sad as the sun dusts twilight over the horizon; the sun spreads out his fingers one last time to the good earth, bathing the bedroom in muted gold. Dean shifts, limp cock catching on the bare skin of Cas’s hip.
“I’m sleepy, Danny. We can play tomorrow.” He said with as much doggish inflection as he could. Danny reached for the toy and tucked it into his elbow, staring at Dean with his eyes half open.
He returns to making toast and thinking about the turkey thawing out in the refrigerator, his leg jiggling against the counter. He’s not going to think of flight delays, even if it is the day before Thanksgiving.
Dean stays quiet, and the frogs start up their chirping drone, the dove keeps singing and the whistle of the train a mile away wails in the distance. The willows whisper to each other about the two men who walk along the lake edge and hold hands and kiss each other like they are young. Who fumble over stones and sit silently and watch the birds, who row out a little boat and fish until they come back rosy pink and smelling like long talks about nothing.
He could see it, and then it became blurry and Dean coughed a laugh because goddammit he was getting sentimental and he was always such an easy crier, and his dad always gave him such shit about it growing up.
“Hey! Watch it! You’ll scuff the paint!” Dean said loudly, grumbling, “Kid’s a bull in a fuckin’ china shop…”
“Hot, hot don’t touch it!” Cas says automatically, putting it on the counter and Dean smiles, pulling a donut off the tray to eat one, thick and cakey and warm.
“I’m sorry you can’t go anywhere you want anymore.” He repeats, throwing one freckled arm over the pillow. The fabric scrunches into a million waves haloed around Dean’s knuckles. Cas stretches a leg against the sheets and watches Dean, reaching out one hand to brush eyelash from the swell of his cheekbone.
“You little fuck!” Dean hissed, his tongue automatically going out to try and get some of the syrup off of him.
"It’s awesome,” Dean repeated against Cas’s mouth before abandoning him for two plates and a knife to cut it with. He stared at the pie. “I feel bad for messing it up!” Dean exclaimed, and Cas laughed, pulling the knife away, making an even slice.
for both of them. Faith sits dazed and uncomfortable on the counter, rubbing her face, her hair matted down her back, sporting the same pj’s she’s worn since yesterday. Danny isn’t in much better shape. He pulls away from Dean and goes to Cas, standing beside him, humming another low whine, scrubbing at his stuffy nose. Faith coughs and it’s wet and nasty and Dean’s heard that cough and knows it’ll take at least a week for it to leave completely.
Dean falls asleep thinking how he’ll kiss Cas in the morning. Kiss him awake, if he’s lucky, and watch his eyes open.
“Kiss me.” He said, tugging, and Cas complied. They kissed for a few minutes, Cas holding the chocolate sauce in one hand, the other on Dean’s shoulder, squeezing it as they rolled their tongues lazily into one another’s mouths.
and it’ll all seem so normal and so ordinary and so quiet, and maybe when he’s old he won’t remember any of it, but he’ll remember Cas’s eyes closing and then opening in the bath tub, by the light of storm candles under the rail of the wind, and how those eyes looked at him, water trailing down his nose, and how he smiled and how he let Dean hold his face in his hands, how in a million ways something could have gone so fucking wrong, but it didn’t. It
“Your love affair with food concerns me.” He offers, voice dripping with sarcasm, looking at Dean sideways, his eyes a lovely mixture of amusement and exasperation at Dean’s antics. Dean grins at him and wiggles his eyebrows.
“Make sure he holds your hand crossing streets,” Cas reminds him, “and go to the door with him, and make sure he doesn’t get any of that unwrapped candy.”
She huffs and rolls her eyes, tossing her head, stray hairs once again stuck to her face. She bats them away and Cas laughs louder.
Mix thoroughly and take of your clothes, spread yourself on the bed, and wait for Cas to finish brushing his damn teeth, and brother, you’ve got yourself one heck of a dessert.
“Classy.” Dean says, cracking eggs and Cas raises his eyebrows, taking a sip, pinky up. Dean shakes his head, smiling deep into the side of his cheek while Cas comes at him with the other glass.
Dean’s arms shake and he eases himself down, holding them together in a white hot press. Cas breathes deeply and evenly, and Dean has to remember to pull out and to roll over onto his stomach, or he’ll probably crush him. He’s exhausted – bone tired and satisfied, but he touches Cas gently.
“Daddy? Can I have a bath? I feel bad.” She croaks and Dean looks down and kisses her gently on the side of the head, carrying her upstairs.
Cas’s voice is thoughtful now, and hushed, probably because he’s pressing small little kisses to Danny’s hair as he speaks, his words only broken as he turns the pages to show Danny the pictures.
Dean pushes back from their kitchen table and Cas settles onto his lap while the coffee maker drums on the counter.
“It’s like this…more, or less.” Cas says softly and Dean listens to the sound of the woman’s voice. He hears it, in the waver of her tone, the melody that is so familiar but not, but more so in the press of Castiel’s body.
“I’m impressed.” Cas admitted, ducking his head under the the blanket, dropping down to look inside. He smiled. There were books and a few stray toys in there as well as  package of animal crackers.
“Hey, watch your mouth!” She chastised, slinging her legs over the arm of the chair, stretching them out.
Today, Dean finds himself mouthing the words along with Cas a song he heard long ago – words he had forgotten.
He sighed and rubbed his eyes, tired from staring at the print, and heard a sudden groan downstairs that was distinct from the thunder rumbling around the house. He let his hand fall back to the desk and glanced at the floor, only to be met by the sharp sound again and another duller movement. Panic rose for a moment - Danny and Faith still had at least fifteen more minutes of nap left, and Cas didn’t think he had the energy to deal with them if they didn’t get enough sleep. They’d been especially hard today: Faith had just recovered from a cold and was still stuck in a fussy phase, and Danny was never-ending energy, having been cooped up for most of the weekend.
“We got it, that’s pretty cool.” He says conversationally, as Cas moans about Baileys and why he is never going to drink it again, and not being able to cleanse his mind of the image of that dead limp mouse.
“Ok.” Daniel sighed, nuzzling into the pillow as Dean patted his back and then stood. He was a step away from the bed when he felt a hand on his wrist and, upon looking  down, saw Daniel holding it with three fingers. He moves his hand down to squeeze Dean’s palm and Dean squeezed it back, the grip comforting.
“Fuck.” He grits, “F-fuck, Cas.” He whispers, and Cas’s eyes flutter at him, hands combing back over his ears.
“Well, I see you two are getting along!” Dean interrupts, going to around the couch to sit down on Danny’s other side. Danny squeals and Dean brushes a fine baby hair out of his face, tickling him and then settling back to reevaluate the score on the baseball game currently playing out on tv.
But the funny thing is that Dean Winchester can’t  lie down – he can’t sleep till the world is safe and there’s no one else  to do it, to clean up the mess, so Dean tries to stand again, lurching  forward into the apparition his mind has conjured for the evening. He  stalks through Castiel’s incorporeal form which doesn’t even flicker but  follows his footsteps to the Impala. Dean fumbles with his keys, nearly  scrapes her sleek black side, and then, after a moment, stops. He can  barely keep his eyes open, and his forehead is so hot against the cool  metal he can almost hear it hiss.
They call her a bruja, but that is not her name. Everyone has forgotten her real name, and Mama says it might have been Christian once, and crosses herself. It does not matter, though, because everyone knows that Leticia is going to the little adobe house, holding her hands behind her so they might look busy, because she is the middle girl and the middle girl gets medicine.
“Sure.” He smiles, and Cas nods, as if he expected this answer, and quickly undoes it and plasters it onto Dean’s elbow, so now there are two there.
) Cas looks up and meets eyes with Dean and smiles that very special, very secret, smile. It’s small – but Dean knows that it conveys way more than it lets on. It says
“Inias.” He says and the angel turns from where he is examining one of Faith’s toys. He sets it back down on the carpet and turns more fully, straightening his suit jacket a little more. Castiel takes the last step down and stands a few feet away, and Inias is still the same as he has always been: waiting for Castiel to say something first.
“Ok. Now, you take the time you need, but there are two teenagers bumming around who would probably like to see you.” He says, and Cas smiles; it’s watery, but strong.
“I don’t need much.” He tells Dean, and Dean can taste that honesty on his mouth and feels it in a sharp spike to his gut. Suddenly he realizes how
Dean, on the other hand, would rather die than sit through another story like “When Andrew Came Home” or that weird one about the Diner Cas can’t get enough of. Unfortunately, winter means the TV in their bedroom is in a constant rotation of these shitty movies.
“Danny?” Cas grumbled, his hair sticking up like the feathers of a cockatoo. Dean focused his eyes and realized it was indeed his son, wrapped in a blanket and looming in the doorway.
His blue eyes stayed glued to the floor, darting around, and as he tried to go around Dean and get the pie and throw it out, Dean put the cup back on the counter as quickly as possible in order to forcefully grab up Castiel’s face. He kissed him hard, quick and dirty, and Castiel gasped as he deepened it before drawing back as fast as he’d started.
“I need a hair cut!” She comments with a sigh and he takes his arm and loops it around her neck, smushing her face against his in one reckless little motion. He bats his eyelashes, she laughs.
He stares at them and the light grey dash board of his car. There is a sweater neglected in the back seat - a, rumpled, yellow, pile that mimics the color of daffodils - that he can see when he glances in the rear view mirror. It’s Faith’s, left over from some trip to the store or to school.
“I’m figuring out how to use the zoom.” He said, smirking, and Dean chuckled and looked straight ahead.
Cas sighs and puts the fruit and knife aside and let’s Dean lead him by the wrist to the garage again. He is confused when he hears the country music station playing where usually there would be ’86.9
Cas lifts his head and plows it into the down, rubbing his face on the ivory fabric as he moves his foot and rakes the blankets upwards to fold over them.
Shaking his head and grabbing the throw off of their window seat, he drapes it on Cas and kisses him gently on the temple before kicking the laundry basket away from the bed and retreating back out of the room, shutting the door as quietly as possible behind him.
“Just me, I’m afraid…” Cas joked, earning a laugh from Dean as he shifted, relishing the pull of he and Dean’s hips against each other in a casual brush. He considered where to go next for a few moments and then leaned forward. “Here…” He said, and he dipped his finger in again and then carefully penned ‘C-A-S’ across Dean’s chest, his finger lingering over where he could feel Dean’s heartbeat and the stretch of his skin as he breathed.
There is a long moment of silence as Cas stands over the crib and marvels before Dean opens his eyes to their dimly lit hallway and hears Cas’s final message to their sleeping son.
my darling, my catfish, you have come from the clay which has come from my dust falling to earth; you are born from my ashes, you were fired in my flames. fine pottery masterpiece, my tears made a river and carved every scale of you. i have hollowed the place where my love will go, i have scooped out your flesh, you won’t need it, for i will fill every hunger you have. my clay bowl, i will drink from you, and you will fill me, and i shall pour into you till you overrun.
Sober enough to feel the hurt, drunk enough to lay  there stupidly, Dean let’s his cheek rest on the pavement, eyes half  lidded. Two years ago he would have kicked the douche bag into next  week, but now…
“I have blessed  you, and so you shall walk beside him and light his lamp,” he breathed into one, and the stone was blessed and split in its joy, and its tears were like many jewels.
“Oh darkness within me! You have touched love and rejoiced for it has bloomed in your palm. I have touched love and despaired for it has withered in my fists.”
“He was great.” Dean answered, “In fact, I think he was good enough that we could definitely stop and get McDonald’s.”
“A stone, ladies and gents, a simple stone, like any stone you’d find in your cobbled street,” he tosses it in his hand. “Do you know the joke about God on the hill? It’s a good joke- God meets Death hill and gives him two rocks! No wonder we all die, right? Shitty gift if you ask me…”
“My best little man.” Dean said, shaking Danny’s legs where the hung off of his shoulders. Danny giggled and rested his chin on Dean’s hair, little fingers playing with the sides of his face as they walked to the car.
“Who’s my best girl? Who’s my best girl, huh?” Dean says loudly as she starts fisting her little hands in his hair. He grabs her hand and play bites at it and she makes that little keen of joy he loves so much.
“The most they have to worry about is how much Sam is going to over feed them, ok? Nothing is going to happen.” And then Cas is pulling away to open the wine with a struggle and, after realizing they have no real wine glasses, shrugs and pours it into two regular ones.
Dean shrugs, pursing his lips, eyes still squeezed shut. He hadn’t really been thinking about it at the time.
And when Cas has his own food he slumps down in his chair at the table and sticks his legs out to put them back on Dean’s knees, munching his granola and yogurt and watching the birds outside, just over Dean’s shoulder, not saying much, still waking up.
“It is hot and you walked here! Rest your feet! Pobrecita!” She insists and Leticia sits because she is tired and it is hot. She takes another drink from her cup and nods to herself.
or will my hunger overwhelm you? for i am nothing but a hunger. i am nothing but a need. i have dug through every soul to quench my thirst but nothing will sate me.
"Stand up, man!” Cas feels himself propelled stiffly up out of his seat, the man on the stage’s eyes narrowing, “It’s your
How it must feel to play them at the piano in the early morning, the light from those bay windows illuminating the blank stand – Cas never uses sheet music.
“Anyway, just a stone, ladies and gents, just a stone, right? Well, God was like me, ladies and gents, he blessed it,” the magician reaches over and cracks the stone hard on the table and Castiel’s eyes widen, the sound ricocheting around the theater, startling many of the people, “and threw it to the heavens!”
God help Dean if he doesn’t record ‘The Librarian’ or Stephen King’s ‘The Stand’ when they dare to make an appearance on the TV guide, because there will be hell to pay. Doesn’t matter how many times Cas has seen it – he has to watch it again, all with the same enthralled expression on his face, like somehow, the ending will turn out different.
The words hang like crooked picture frames in his  head, which is pounding so hard he doesn’t know how he can think in the  first place.
After a moment, Cas leaned his head back against the stairs and smiled at him, the pie plate and fork still held in his hand.
this is shamelessly torn right out of the scene from 'the family man' which you should watch if you haven't cause it's Fucking Great
"But, I owe your Mama a favor.” The bruja dismisses, standing suddenly from her table. She teeters to the kitchen and Leticia cannot see, but she knows she is putting the medicine in a little linen bag for her to take home.
“It’s some heavy shit, Cas, but you know, humans have been dealing with that for a long time, and I think we turn out ok.” Cas listens intently as Dean talks, the weight in his chest starting to lift, though the sadness still remains. “You just have to keep loving the people in your life and you gotta hope that when you’re gone - when you have to leave them - that they have so much of you in them already that it’s like you’re not really gone at all.”
“Not even for a surprise downstairs?” He asked and Danny seemed to perk up at that, sitting up, with a case of bed head for the record books.
Secretly, he knows that she won’t go down later when he tucks  her in with her brother on the guest bed, but that’s ok. Round ten little feet will squeak down his stairs and she’ll come sit up in his lap, quiet as a church mouse. Bobby is far too honest a man to say he doesn’t love it, her tucked up, staring sleepily at the tv while he flips through books and thumbs through research for Sam or whoever else needs it at the time.
He wipes at his eyes, pushing the wet away, and takes another breath, and it sort of stutters out of him. He tries to smile, but finds he can’t really do it. His phone buzzes in the center console and he reaches to grab it, immediately rushing to compose his voice.
“Daniel Johnathan Winchester you get in that bed right now, mister.” Cas hissed, coming forward to take the comforter out of Dean’s arms to dissapear down the hall with it.
He almost doesn’t notice the angel in the room, but when he stalls at the bottom of the stairs, he must look utterly surprised. It doesn’t last, and his face quickly melts into a smile.
An owl hoots across the lake and is answered and the swallows roost in the eves of the cabin. The cattails sing lullabies about the the star and the catfish, the greatest wonder how they ever walked apart from each other.
“My poor little birds.” Cas says quietly, sounding equally as miserable as the kids his voice stuffed with worry. Cas lifts Faith up off the counter and starts rubbing her back; she goes limp and still except for the little hiccups and struggling breaths she emits every few seconds. She coughs, and Cas doesn’t even seem to notice, except to wince in pain at the sound. Danny gravitates back to Dean, turning around to lean his back against Dean’s legs, watching Cas rock Faith. He scratches at his stomach under his jammies and Dean strokes the sides of his face and his hot forehead.
“Dean.” Cas’s appearance isn’t expected, but Dean’s  out of his mind, so giving a shit isn’t high on his list of priorities.  Let him appear wherever the fuck he wants. He’s gone. Something  clenches in Dean’s stomach, a raw nerve rubbed till it spits sparks all  over his insides.
The next batch makes Dean laugh out loud though - Cas’s expertise in the area of the undead is extensive after the apocalypse, so as he puts the candy aside to appraise the children’s obviously amateur makeup with direct scrutiny, Dean has to grin at the absurdity. The poor kids look honestly scared and walk quickly away, throwing wary stares over their shoulders as they go.
for both of them. Faith sits dazed and uncomfortable on the counter, rubbing her face, her hair matted down her back, sporting the same pj’s she’s worn since yesterday. Danny isn’t in much better shape. He pulls away from Dean and goes to Cas, standing beside him, humming another low whine, scrubbing at his stuffy nose. Faith coughs and it’s wet and nasty and Dean’s heard that cough and knows it’ll take at least a week for it to leave completely.
“Look!” Faith interrupts, and both men look up at the TV, following Faith’s finger where it points to two frogs dancing.
“Your dick.” He says harshly and genuinely and Dean has to refrain from rolling his eyes and shaking his head. Dean’s only retaliation is to crook his fingers and Cas sees sparks, but he also starts jamming himself back onto Dean with more than a little insistence.
the backrub, you ass.”  He bites, closing his eyes and yawning. Dean puts his arm over Cas’s stomach and burrows into his own pillow, watching Cas crack an eye to look at him.
Cas pulled the edge of his boxers back and Dean lifted his arm to stare as Cas slowly pulled his tongue from hip bone to hip bone, agonizingly slow.
. He has all his limbs, he’s completely intact, his car is parked in front of the grocery store that they usually go to.
Cas’s hand on his arm anchored him as he felt the world spinning under his feet, his whole body feeling cottony.
Juggling two kids was way harder than Dean ever anticipated and he had the newest appreciation for just how well Cas seemed to manage it when Dean went on the occasional hunt with Sam.
The wonderful thing about the game was that it could be challenging. There were only so many times Cas could say to get him the book off the bottom shelf before Dean caught on, so he had to be creative. That meant putting Dean’s favorite things on high shelves so Cas could see the long line of Dean’s body as it reached, or dropping things on accident while he cooked but always when Cas’s own hands were busied so Dean would be forced to help him out.
Leticia thinks, in that moment, that the cup is beautiful, sitting inside, chipped, because it was loved. It was hand-painted, she could tell. The little flowers were too intricate to not be anything else. The bruja, too, was beautiful, because she loved her little cup. Even as she hunched over and swept her yard.
“You know, I think we’ve got it wrong.” He replies quietly, “I think all the time before we were wearing costumes. Now we are just us.”
“No! No! I wish you could see her face…” he started, breaking into a grin as Faith’s mouth fell open and she stared at Cas, or, more appropriately the towel.
Cas doesn’t look at Dean but tilts his head, expression shifting from serious to a shadow of sorrow.
The star bore witness as the catfish thrashed, and the earth shook, and the catfish opened its eyes and gazed at his fins and remembered that once he had hands. He followed the light and came from the water on firm legs.
“Dean, come on, wait a minute?” Cas pleads, taking the potholders to the glass container of cider to distribute it out in three cups, Faith’s cold and put separately.
Dean kisses Cas who tastes like sweettarts and cider in the kitchen where he sets the rest of the donuts in a plastic bag for tomorrow morning.
It makes Dean lose himself. It makes him want to be loud too, because Cas doesn’t understand conventions like tact or strategy in love. He just
“Hey…” Dean says softly, coming in, and Cas looks up, suddenly alert, like he shouldn’t be caught like this. He starts wiping frantically at his eyes and Dean leans over Daniel and makes Cas stop.
Cas sighed and leaned forward, centering it a little more on the counter, hoping that maybe if it were arranged properly it would look better. It still looked kind of sad. Droopy - but he had tried. He had to keep reminding himself that because it was a good attitude to have and an important one, at that. No one got anywhere by beating themselves down. He’d learned that the hard way.
nice.” Dean laughed, grinning, and Cas’s eyebrows fell as he came closer. He popped the top off of the girly ass packaging and unsealed the container, glancing up at Cas as he did so. Cas had crept closer, hesitating on the edge of the bed with curious eyes before finally slipping forward and taking the container out of Dean’s hand. He tugged the cord on the bedside lamp and read the side quickly, his eyebrows shooting up with every word.
Cas’s arm falls to the covers, gracefully curling in a regal arc beside his head, the knuckles just brushing his splayed dark hair. He vibrates with the force and presses his lips together before the fall open again, the room stifling and hot with the sounds of their breathing and the heater.
“Shit…my truck.” He said, referring to the frame on wheels Bobby had gifted him for his birthday that year.
Something gleamed in the sink and when he took a look he noticed it was the standard measuring cup for cooking. It rested in a mixing bowl alongside a few other things used for baking, but it wasn’t what was there that caused Dean the concern, but rather what was absent that made his stomach drop. He pulled the measuring cup out of the basin with a clatter of utensils and inspected it further - something granulated stuck to the inside.
Danny doesn’t even complain about the prospect of it and as he dumps them both into the tub they both seem too groggy to protest as he helps them wash off all the sick of the day. When he helps them back out they smell heavenly – baby shampoo and that sweet smell of their body wash as he mops water off of them with towels.
It all sounds rightfully fishy to Sam, but when your brother is nearly the dictionary definition for contradiction you learn to let such things be as they are.
“I have blessed you, and so you shall walk beside him and draw water for his jar,” and he breathed into the remaining and the stone was blessed and split in its joy, and its tears were like surging tides.
He doesn’t even know how to pronounce the name of the song on the record let alone heard of it, but Cas had looked so
Dean takes a deep even breath in time with Cas as Cas begins to whisper, Danny surely so close to falling asleep but barely able to keep his eyes open.
Dean looks up from his coffee at Castiel pressed at the kitchen window, his own mug clenched in his hand, and Dean recognizes the severe expression and who it happens to be for.
“It was good.” Dean says, watching Cas as he interacts with Faith, smiling at her with dizzy eyes and she squeals back at him.
“Mouse! Little asshole’s somewhere – I know it!” Dean yelled back, his voice echoing in the cupboard he was buried in. Castiel set down the beer he was carrying and the sack of groceries among some displaced dry pasta and can of Quaker Oats and carefully stepped over the broom Dean had thrown out of his way when raiding the pantry.
Cas nuzzles his head into the pillow and throws his arm over Dean’s chest, smiling briefly as Dean runs his fingers over the ridge of his wrist where it’s settled against his side.
A man’s gotta remember what he is, remember not to let his troubles weigh him down. Body ain’t nothin’ but a river, I tell you boy, and those eyes of god are always watching the river.’”
“Mmmnooo.” Danny gurgled, and Cas laughed, sneaking his hand up to tickle him and brush the hair out of his eyes.
If you don’t the river’s gonna flood and she’s gonna rise up and pull you in. She’s lookin’ for her children, and if your soul’s thrashin’ in you like a catfish, she’s gonna take you right down.
Dean’s not a ‘pajamas’ kind of guy. He’s more like ’t-shirt I am already wearing and probably the underwear I’m already wearing too, maybe some clean underwear, I don’t know, have I showered yet? What the hell let’s ditch the shirt it’s hot’ kind of guy, but Cas, Cas definitely has night rituals. They give him structure, so Dean doesn’t mind so much that he
When Cas had reacted so strongly to the towel being thrown on him she had frozen, and Dean had paused to watch her.
“Daddy? Can I have a bath? I feel bad.” She croaks and Dean looks down and kisses her gently on the side of the head, carrying her upstairs.
Dean rolls his head back, already starting to let the uneasiness go. It’s hard to be worried when Cas is working hands under the hem of his shirt.
“Woah!” He yells, striding quickly to catch up with her. He knew he should have rinsed her plate before letting her out, but it’s almost six and the recital starts at seven thirty.
“Easy, easy…” Dean said as Daniel began to cry against the porcelain, only pausing to heave into the bowl again. Dean dropped to his knees and rubbed his back, pulling his floppy hair out of his face as Daniel panted and then moaned.
“I realized that it isn’t about the words so much.” Cas murmurs, “When she sings I think about you. I know she is singing about love…” He trails off and Dean slips his hands to Cas’s hips, rocking as they turn.
There is thunderous applause and he steps out into the aisle, past the thousands of nameless faces gazing at him, watching him walk briskly down the center carpet and eventually up the steps onto the stage, the spotlight trailing him.
“Oh, damn!” Dean says and he and Cas wait a beat to see her reaction. She stares at the ground and then looks up at Dean crocodile tears already welling up and pouring down her face.
Cas stared down at the pie’s top, trying to tell himself he had done a good job. It would probably taste ok - it just wasn’t the prettiest. They always made it look so easy online on those DIY blogs or whatever they were called. This wasn’t as crisp and perfect looking as the picture, but it would at least pass for a decent stand in.
eat that pie. I was saving it for myself, and if you even think about eating it…CAS!” Dean hissed as Cas slowly began to put the fork in his mouth, sucking the prongs, still staring at Dean. He chewed.
Dean grunted and Cas put his hands over his mouth, wishing the chair he sat in would swallow him whole.
“Come in!” She calls, and Leticia follows, because it is shady inside. The bruja sits down at her small table and drinks from a little tea cup, and Leticia thinks it might have been beautiful once upon a time when the bruja was not a bruja. She keeps smiling and motions for Leticia to sit.
“What are you idjits going on about?” Bobby said, entering with three mugs of coffee. He took one look at Dean and frowned, “What’s he doing under my couch?”
“You want me to fix you something?” a hand creeping under Cas’ shirt, scratching lightly between his shoulder blades. A stifled yawn into the back of his hand and a shake of his head.
“Projecting.” Is all Castiel breathes, and they kiss again, teeth clacking, and Castiel takes his hands out of Dean’s hair long enough to strip himself of the button down, working hands up Dean’s t-shirt. Dean’s breath hitches and Castiel doesn’t stop, clawing and palming over his stomach, his hipbones, his chest. “You act,” He starts, sounding horny and pissed, “like you don’t lie there – !”
Dean groans and thrusts forward. One day he’ll get it across to Cas that you can’t say stuff like that to him, that it unties the little careful strings and everything falls apart. He loses himself in the loudness of Cas. Ages of singing praises doesn’t dissipate because of
“It still going up?” Dean answers gruffly, taking it from Castiel as he moves to steal the bags from the drugstore haul from Dean’s outstretched arms.
Dean leans his head against the wall and imagines the room as Cas says the words, rocking him and Danny in an endless, soothing, rhythm.
Dean shakes his head and rubs his palms on his jeans while Cas walks past where the hunter is staring into the refrigerator blankly, like any minute a three course meal is going to pop into view.
brief because he’s being pushed and his shoulders meet the bed. Cas’s hands slip the t-shirt off and Dean grunts as it works over his head and then flies across the bed, hitting the far wall and out of sight. They don’t talk too much after that, just huffing, and Dean grabs Castiel’s hips now, kneading along the jutting line of his bones. They are both hard and Dean’s starting to get frustrated with his jeans, shimmying under Castiel.
Dean really had to work not to choke on his fork. His eyes widened and his pulse quickened as he sucked the remnants of the pie from the metal and then stared at it like it had personally offended him.
She looks up and claps her hands together. Dean sticks his tongue at her and then goes back to the road, traffic blessedly light for the time of day.
“Watch him!” Cas snaps, and Dean looks up just in time to see Danny making for the grass. Dean walks on his knees and snags him before he can get too far, and Danny shrieks happily, wiggling.
He looked out into the shimmering mirage, the splicing of dimensions over one another, slippery and flaking like mica, and saw that it wasn’t a match in God’s hand, but a baseball. He wound up to make the pitch.
“SHIT!” he hisses, palming his hip as Castiel stares around, hair wild, looking for the source of the bang they just heard. Dean looks to him and then staggers to the pantry, stepping out of his pants to , opening the door so the light clicks on overhead. Cas slides off of the counter and pads beside him, and then Dean is bending down and withdrawing a dead mouse.
“Dinner in an hour.” He calls and Dean straightens his shirt and his hair and laughs and grins stupidly, shaking his head. He considers changing the station and doesn’t, wandering back to the Impala, twirling his wrench.
. Vultures gossiped along its shores with the balding heads of old men, waiting for their turn at the frayed carcass of a
“Because I am right.” The bruja laughs, picking up her maybe pretty cup. “Little children should already know these things, but parents get forgetful and tired and do not tell their little children the stories they should. But they are very true.”
“Dean.” he sighed, taking the plate from him to rinse, adoring the way his hands smoothed over Dean’s fingers with the action. “Of course it worked.”
so comes the dry season, and the catfish will burrow in the mud, sleeping and dreaming, out of sight.
“Look what I found!” He exclaims, coming to stand next to Dean who glances over his shoulder. Cas, who isn’t so good at surprising people, pulls the two bottles of wine out from where it’s hidden and sets them down on the counter. Dean smiles but Cas has this way of telling he’s still worried.
Someday someone is going to ask him and Dean will think back and he’ll remember the hazy hours of February 13
to do? Like breathing? Faith, will you die if you don't  nag me?” Daniel said back, taking another long drink and Faith lurched forward, only stopped by Dean’s arm around her midsection.
When Dean comes upstairs at a little after 11, he can’t help but feel  for the mess he sees in the nursery. Cas has his hand over his eyes, and Daniel is still crying, and Cas looks like he’s about to lose it.
He can see Dean trying to hold a football, which is hard when you have a small child clinging to your arms trying to pry it from you, and if he tilts he can see Faith toddling along with Polly beside her, probably singing to herself as she wades through the grass. Dean holds the football over his head and Danny jumps for it, pawing at the front of Dean’s t-shirt before pushing  him as hard as he can.
Dean straightened back up, still glaring at the place beside the butter where his plastic-wrapped piece of heaven
Sometimes a name, sometimes something else, muffled in a mouth or a neck or the sheets and somewhere in it all Dean tells him he’s never going to love anybody like this ever again, that he’s going to love him like nobody’s loved him and Cas kind of laughs.
Then it was the two dots right under his ribcage, and Dean’s boxers were already getting tight, his arousal pressing against Cas’s belly where he had slid down, snaking himself between Dean’s legs so that he could work more effectively on his torso.
“You think about me?”  He breathes, suddenly needing to know, and Castiel ignores it, kissing, and snakes his tongue around in Dean’s mouth, lips plying over his, and Dean let’s his hands fall down to his ass, gripping in a squeeze and Castiel hikes himself up, his front scraping on Dean’s abs.
She jumps up and down and then the blinds rattle and the curtains flutter as she dissapears. Dean parks the impala in the garage and gets out, ducking under the garage door as it starts to close. Cas stands on the front step, barefoot as Faith comes tearing down the front walk to meet him. Dean crouches down, waiting for impact as she squeals and shrieks, hands already flung out to grab at him.
There’s the creak of the foundation as Cas walks into their living room, and even with his eyes closed Dean can feel the blue eyes mapping over his still body.
“The one and only.” Dean said cheekily, turning back to his work, doing his best to be quiet. Cas frowned.
She had been teetering around by Cas for some time, just wobbling around on her new found legs, and Cas had been holding her hands, watching her to make sure she didn’t try to pull anything off of the coffee table or bump her head.
Dean nearly laughs and then is quiet, the sound he makes stopped short for fear of hurting Cas’s feelings.
“You want me to deal with it?” Dean says, obviously sarcastic, standing up from their bed. Cas glares at him. Dean rolls his shoulders and stares right back. “Then none of that ‘you were too harsh’ crap. They’ve been at it all day and they need to knock it off.”
The next time he pulls, Cas slides right into his arms. Dean really wants to leave this terrible place behind, but at the same time he’s loathe to let go of this moment with Cas. In the end it’s the promise of something better waiting at home that makes him step back and hop behind the wheel -- but not before he kisses Cas’s forehead.
Sam’s face fell, panic taking over. “Okay, okay. Where?” he demanded, already shrugging off his jacket.
“Great.” The car moves, the tail dipping down, if Dean’s sense of direction isn’t completely shot to hell right now. “Did you just sit down on the trunk?”
Cas finally looked up again, the frown dissipating from his face as the realization hit. Dean watched as the knowledge settled, and then, after seemingly forever, Cas said, “You want to open a bar?”
“So much for peace and quiet,” Dean muttered under his breath. Cas grinned and put his arm around him, and Dean pressed a short kiss to his cheek before they set off after the dog.
“I’m fine,” Dean says, his own voice muffled because his face is somewhat squished into his arm and shoulder and there’s a pretty solid sheet of metal between them. “Why do y’all keep asking me that?”
Dean let out a relieved laugh, tension finally bleeding from his shoulders. Cas smile grew bigger, and before either of them could overthink this again, Dean leaned in, kissing him.
“Dude, I’m not throwing that again,” he told the dog as Cas bent down to take the twig. Miracle seemed delighted at having two people to play with. He shot off almost before Cas had thrown his stick, almost tripping over his own feet in his need to give chase, barking excitedly.
“Do I even want to know?” Sam asks, giving him so much shit with just a look it’s impossible. Dean wants a word with whoever taught him that.
Cas looked from him to their hands, then frowned. Dean could almost see the wheels turning in his head, trying to make sense of what he’d just said. And he seemed to come up empty. His frown tightened with every circle Dean’s thumbs rubbed into the backs of his hands in a futile attempt to calm himself down. And he kept staring at their hands.
