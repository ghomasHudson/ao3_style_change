He sucked up and down John’s shaft a few times, licking in to the slit on each up-stroke, tasting the droplets gathered there and enjoying watching John who was almost constantly moaning now.  On the next pass he took a deep breath again and when he reached the base he hummed in his deepest tone and swallowed around John’s shaft.  Before John even had time to pull back and warn him, Sherlock found himself swallowing rapidly as John came straight down his throat, shouting and grabbing his hair as he released.  John’s heels banged against the bed as his legs shuddered as he tried not to thrust his pelvis any further forward as Sherlock already had a mouthful and was taking as much as he could.
I have been trying to remember to eat for you, so please don’t be unhappy about that.  I’ve also been attempting to maintain an adequate sleeping pattern as well to please you, though I must admit that this worry has been keeping me awake more than anything.
“Of course; I’d be lost without my blogger.”
"They may have done, but I didn't."
“You remember what we talked about this morning?”
“Sherlock.  I wanted...”
“Well what?”
“John, is that you?”
Sherlock was not good at waiting but there was nothing else he could do.  He received a few texts from Lestrade who was becoming increasingly worried with each one.  He'd tried to ring as well but Sherlock just let it go to voicemail.  He didn’t want to give Lestrade any false hope by suggesting John was out of surgery to then have to tell him later that John had died.  Better to wait until he knew for definite one way or the other if John was going to wake up.
“Nonsense.  Your leg injury is completely psychosomatic, you’ll manage just fine.”
“Well, that’s what I thought, too, but you were certainly acting drunk on the dance floor.  You tried groping me in front of everyone, and then you proceeded to tell Greg he had nice legs and should be wearing shorts.”
“You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to hear you say that.”
John was still shaking with aftershocks as he revelled in the pull on his neck and the feel of Sherlock drinking his blood.  Sherlock licked his neck to seal the wound, cleaning all round it.  He moved up to capture John's lips in a couple of light presses as John was practically passed out already.  Sherlock got some tissues and cleaned himself and John up and then pulled the cover over them both.  He figured John deserved another kip after being out all night, followed by their more strenuous activities.  John rested his head against Sherlock's shoulder, one arm and leg stretching over his body to keep in as much contact as possible.
John growled again and bared his fangs at Sherlock and Sherlock grinned proudly down at him.  He had to admit to himself that he hadn't imagined it would be such a turn on to see John as a vampire.  He bent forward to capture John's lips and kissed him deeply, slipping his tongue into John's mouth, tasting the blood he'd just swallowed.  John took advantage of Sherlock's momentary preoccupation and he jacked his body, forcing Sherlock's legs to slide outwards.  John used the slip to roll his body and push Sherlock on to the floor.
Sherlock nibbled on John's lip again, piercing it and sucking the blood in to his mouth.  He pushed his tongue into John's mouth to deepen the kiss and felt John instantly pull on his tongue trying to get as much of the blood as he could.  Sherlock looked down at him with a raised eyebrow and John sheepishly shrugged his shoulders.

They tested all the orange and blue cups, but they were all clear of any traces.  Then John remembered what had happened.
tbc...
Sherlock had his mouth open to reply but John just turned away and walked off with Mary, not giving him time to get a word in.  Sherlock’s jaw clicked shut and he clenched his teeth together as the thought of John considering their evening ‘not important’ threatened to burst out and be shouted at John’s retreating form.
John grinned and leaned in to do something he had been thinking about all evening; that was to kiss Sherlock.  For a first kiss it was pretty amazing.  John held Sherlock's head gently in his palms, stroking his thumbs over those sharp cheekbones.  He brushed his lips lightly over Sherlock's own and pressed a soft kiss to  each corner.  John revelled in the little gasp he drew from Sherlock as he slid his tongue along Sherlock’s lower lip and bit down gently on the soft skin.  He pushed gently inside as Sherlock’s lips parted, parrying with Sherlock’s own tongue; enjoying Sherlock’s enthusiasm at experiencing something new.  John knew Sherlock had not done it before but he was a very fast learner and was soon copying all of John’s moves, matching him taste for taste as they explored each other’s mouths.
"I won't have to give up my part, will I?"
Sherlock slid across the bed and rested his hand on John’s waist as John wrapped his own around Sherlock’s neck and brought his face into easy reach.  He leant forward and pressed his lips softly against Sherlock’s own, tasting and nibbling gently as he and Sherlock settled their bodies comfortably against each other.
Stacey was hovering near Jasmine, offering her a tissue, and looking grateful for the chance to be able to help her former friend.  The break-up had definitely been on Jasmine's side only, and Stacey appeared to still miss her friend.  Hannah and Ethan had been backstage, as they had been waiting to come back in to the room.  They had come through the door when they had heard the crash, and both just looked surprised when it had happened, though Hannah was edging nearer to Freddie, trying to be supportive.
“Only a little bit.”  John smiled across at Sherlock and slid his hand across the seat to squeeze Sherlock’s thigh.
Epilogue
John took the lube and coated his shaft in it.  He pulled Sherlock back towards him and slid his cock between Sherlock’s thighs again.  This time it was a lot smoother and slid more easily, so John rocked himself against Sherlock.  He pressed in deeply so that his pelvis hit Sherlock’s arse on each stroke and brushed against the base of Sherlock’s own cock
“Sure, it’ll be great fun.  I used to help Mr Johnson, the woodwork teacher, clean up afterwards when I was taking his class so I’m sure he’d be willing to supply us with some off-cuts and let us use the school equipment for sawing and planing.  I’m quite good at dovetail joints.  Did you ever do woodwork in any of your other schools?”
John burst out laughing and some of the tension went out of Greg at such a normal reaction.
“What?”
I look forward to our next call.  Write soon.
“You should.  Until next time then.”
Mummy was back in time for Sherlock’s birthday and she took them out for a meal in town to celebrate.  Sherlock actually enjoyed it for once, as John was there with him, even though he had to put up with Mycroft’s company, too.  Mycroft was staying overnight as he was going to be driving them back to college the next day.  They packed quickly when they got back from the meal and left everything by the door ready.  They spent their last evening together in bed; knowing that tomorrow night they would, unfortunately, be in their separate dorm rooms again.
“There’s nothing to do.  All the experiments I wanted to start need John’s help.  It really is too bad of him to go away.”
"I shall look forward to some amazing pronouncements when you have recovered then.  As to what happened to you, though, I’m afraid I don't know at this stage.  If you definitely didn't have any alcohol yourself, then it must have been in something you ate or drank."
“Regardless; your doctor has spoken.”
They had operated again as soon as he’d arrived here, but he had been delirious for the last three days and his fever had only broken that morning.  Hence the visit from the doctor and the news that he would never be able to operate again.  They had fixed most of the damage but, even with intensive physiotherapy, there would still be a weakness there which manifested in an occasional tremor.  What had once been the truest and safest hands in his unit, saving countless lives in the field, were now nothing but a liability.  He could not be trusted to perform delicate procedures, leaving him a disappointment to himself and to ‘him’; to Sherlock.
“Wow.  We ought to do something about it then.  That’d be great if they got together because we’d all still be friends.  We can talk to Mike after lunch.  If he hears it from you he’ll be more inclined to believe it.  He’d probably think I was just messing around.”
“I am, indeed, a doctor, Mr Holmes, and I’m afraid you will have to put up with my concern.”
“Yeah, actually that would be good, thanks.”
Thanks again for your letter.  It’s always nice to hear from someone back home.
When they were both ready, and John seemed a little more enlivened, they headed over to the drama rooms.  They were lucky that there was no class going on in there that morning, so they went into the room and looked around.  The others had obviously cleared everything away once John and Sherlock had left, so there was nothing left out to examine.  Sherlock could see where the chairs had all been moved to and from by the dents in the flooring, but there were no marks from anything that hadn’t been there when he had last been in there yesterday, so that told him nothing.
“Yes, John?”  Sherlock’s deep baritone sent a shiver through John and for the third time in as many minutes, John was fighting to articulate a single sentence.  John frowned for a moment, annoyed at himself for his lack of control and at Sherlock for his apparently inadvertent interruptions.  Sherlock smiled to himself but decided to give John a break; he could see how hard he was trying.
“Do you even know me?  I think I might have to re-assess whether I wish to remain in your company?”
“That’s great.  It’ll be good to have someone else in the know in case this fool does something he shouldn’t and I’m not there to cover for him.”
The rest of the holidays passed far too quickly for their liking.  They had enjoyed waking up entangled together on the morning after and had revelled in having the whole day to themselves.  They took the time to experiment with different positions.  When Sherlock had his first chance to be on the receiving end, he enjoyed it just as much as the other way round.  They only briefly ventured out of their room to collect some snacks from Mrs C before returning to their bed and exploring some more.
"Boring."  Sherlock smiled as he said it, but he willingly took John over to the buffet table, and even took some of the petit fours for himself, too.  John gave him a wide smile and tucked in.  It seemed that dealing with bullies gave him a ravenous appetite.  Of course, the delicious orgasms they had both had earlier could have had something to do with it, too.  John didn't mind either way.  He was here with Sherlock and they were both happy; that was all that mattered to him.
He leant his head forward and felt John pressing up against him.  He was imagining that his head was hovering over John’s groin – did he dare push it further – should he go the whole hog and imagine how it would be to taste John’s cock in his mouth?  He usually preferred to respect John’s boundaries – whether it was in real life or in his dreams – as he could never picture John accepting this from he and he liked to always see John as he really was.  Would it hurt this one time, though?  He had been without John for ages and had really enjoyed finally getting to spend an evening with him again.  He decided to risk it, just this once – John would never know what he was dreaming so what would be the harm?
“Come on, you; let’s clear this up and head back.  You really could use a rest after all this exertion.”
Christopher Wren –                    Played by Oliver Gerrard
"As you wish."
John finally allowed himself to close his eyes but his fingers stretched out across the bed and rested themselves in Sherlock’s own, feeling an almost subconscious tightening before letting them just lay there; a part of each other once more.
When Sherlock finally reached the top of John’s legs, the man was a quivering wreck above him.  He had been dragged through so many sensations as Sherlock discovered erogenous zones he never knew he had.  Sherlock rested between John’s legs for a few moments just staring at the hard shaft in front of him.  His upper arms were lying across John’s thighs and his hands were pressed against the skin of his abdomen, surrounding John’s cock within a triangle created from his first fingers and thumbs.  Sherlock watched as each time he pressed down with his fingers, John’s cock would bob in front of him.  The next time it came close to him he stuck his tongue out and flicked the slit as it neared his lips.
“Well, I’d be very proud if you followed in my footsteps.  It’s hard work, mind you, and can be quite tough on occasions; but when you get a good result and put away some very nasty pieces of work, it is very rewarding.”
He wasn’t really aware of anything around him until Mrs Hudson yoo-hoo’d her way into the living room in the late afternoon.  She came bearing a tray with a pot of tea and some of his favourite home-made scones, obviously trying to entice John to eat something.  As she walked to the coffee table in front of him, he snatched up the letter and the translation, not wanting her to put things down on his precious letter; or to even see it at this stage – it was his.  It was his last link to Sherlock; something he had written himself and meant only for John as it was in the secret code that only the two of them shared.
John grinned at Mycroft’s distaste but nodded his head and they sat down with the team to plan out their campaign.
What did it mean? Feelings?  Sherlock said ‘my feelings for you’ – did that mean what he thought it meant?  Of course not, he must mean his feelings as a friend; it couldn’t be anything more than that.  Could it?  Don’t be silly, John; nothing but wishful thinking.  You are projecting your own wishes on to the message.  ‘Always yours’ though?  That surely couldn’t mean anything else, could it?  Too bad that ‘always’ hadn’t seemed to mean the same length of time to Sherlock as it would have to him.
“I will always be available for you in any way you want me.  You don’t need to hold me captive – although, that might be interesting to try, too.”  John grinned at him.
Sherlock leaned forward and moved his hands around John’s back to pull him in close and kissed him deeply.  He wasn’t satisfied to stay in one place for too long though.  He was getting so many signals firing in his brain as it sank in that he was finally allowed to have what he wanted that his fingers and lips just roved all over John’s face and neck as he tried to taste it all at once.
Always yours
“John, please?”
"Thanks, it sounds like you've got most of it covered then.  What do you think about your costume, John?  Did you picture the Major in uniform or just a smart blazer and trousers?"
It didn’t take John long, and when he came back to himself, Sherlock was lying beside him, naked and ready.  His hand was loosely stroking his cock, so John didn’t keep him waiting any longer.  He pulled Sherlock into the middle of the bed and lay down between his legs.  He stroked slowly along Sherlock’s inner thighs, watching him tremble at the gentle touch.  He circled nearer to Sherlock’s cock each time, without actually touching it.  He followed the trails he had made with his tongue and sucked one of Sherlock’s balls into his mouth.  He pulled it down and then did the same to the other.  When Sherlock was clutching the sheets, trying to restrain himself, John knew he’d reached his limit. He took pity on him and took the head into his mouth.  He swirled his tongue up and down the shaft and round the tip, licking the pre-come that quickly gathered.
"If you're sure you can handle it then we'll take King.  He came from the same stable as Mystery.  Come and meet him.”
John had awoken with a start to discover himself still alone in bed, with a dry, vile-tasting mouth and an absolutely pounding headache.  To top matters off he had obviously inadvertently hit snooze on his alarm clock and he now only had ten minutes to get up, dressed, have breakfast and make the forty minute journey to work.  Just great!
“It is my understanding that you intend to speak to my brother this evening about your supposed future together.”
“I do.  It’s great to meet someone so clever and handsome at the same time.”
Sherlock smiled bashfully.  It hadn’t been a one-off.  John had left a whole new message and he had mentioned Sherlock again.  How many of these messages had he recorded that Sherlock had missed out on whilst he’d been away?  He looked up at Mycroft.
“Hmm, well you have been distracting me in that delicious suit all evening, so you could let me take it off you.”
“I know you could just as easily break in, but allow me to minimise your waiting time.”
Sherlock came to with his nose pressed against John’s skin.  He instantly knew where he was but regretted that he had fallen asleep; firstly because it was wasted time when he could have been watching John; and secondly because he hadn’t wanted to rush John or make him feel awkward.  He pulled his head back and looked up at John’s face.  John smiled softly back at him, he didn’t appear to be put out by it so maybe it wouldn’t be too bad.
“Ok, if you remove your own clothes down to the same level as I am at then for the next choice I will let you pick the place to be kissed – anywhere above the waist at this stage – and you can also choose who gets to do the kissing.”
John smirked at him as he finished tidying up the room and made a pot of tea whilst they waited.  John had made sure that he had already had some blood that day so that he wouldn’t be tempted to take too much later and now the pair of them were just awaiting Greg’s arrival.
“If you’re so clever and you’ve been cleared to consult with the Yard then why haven’t I heard about it?”
"I don't mind at all, it gives me a good excuse to have another myself."
John gave Sherlock the two rocks.  “I thought you might have wanted to get your rocks off.”  John burst out laughing.  “The look on your face!  Sorry, I know that was corny but I couldn’t resist.”
Thank you for everything.
Sherlock looked surprised.  He had certainly had comments on his looks before, but people were never interested in his astute comments and his remarks instantly irritated people and put all thoughts of his looks out of their heads.  He took a sip of his drink, hiding the slight blush that darkened his cheeks.
"Yes, why did you?"  Sherlock couldn't stop himself from asking.
"Can't complain; you know me."  Charles chuckled at that.  "Who's your friend?"
“Me too.  We’ll have to see what else we can fix up as soon as we can, but until then it’ll be nice to sit together at lunch and be able to chat.”
John grinned and slid his hand into Sherlock’s hair as Sherlock smiled up at him and moved his mouth to hover over John’s chest.
“Not gonna forget that.  Wanna hear you squeal like a little piggy.”  John started giggling again.
“Hmmm?  John!  Something has happened, but I can’t recall what it is I’ve seen that made me think that.  We need to keep an eye on everyone.  Stay by Jasmine whenever you can, just in case.”
Sherlock shook his head, trying to dislodge all the questions whirling around.  He could do nothing until he was actually home.  He needed to get home right now and it was going to take him forever.  He was in a little, no-name town which didn’t have a station in the middle of Europe.  So he would need to get a taxi to the nearest larger town with a station so he could get a train (which only ran twice a day here) to the capital which contained the nearest airport.  Then he had to decide if he wanted to risk using his current passport.  It was in the name of his latest identity which was the one he had used when working in the factory so it would be on the staff roster that would now be in the hands of Interpol.
John bumped shoulders with Sherlock and gave him such a sweet, blushing smile that Sherlock found himself beaming in delight.  He leaned forward and kissed John on his red cheeks, his nose and then his mouth; putting his arm around him as the kisses got more serious.  Eventually, Sherlock had to reluctantly pull away, after many lingering pauses to snatch just one more kiss each time.
“Nor do I intend to let you; your presence is a great reassurance to me – both to the state of my own well-being and, more importantly, to yours.”
"We thought you might, so we've arranged for you to sit together.  In fact, here she comes now."
“Just let it go, Sherlock.  I’ve got you.”
John pulled Sherlock up and started towing him out of the changing rooms.  He turned out the lights and locked the door and stopped off at the office to hang the key up on his way past.  They headed back towards their halls, holding hands for as long as they were out of sight of the main buildings.
Sherlock angled them slightly around so that they went through the middle, avoiding the other dancers and timing it so they finished their dance very close to the exit.  He led John out of the door and round to the side, passing the next two buildings and coming to rest in a little alcove out of sight of any windows or random passing people.
“Which other guy?”
“I think that’s why he was so miserable, to tell you the truth.  He saw you there and said it was very important that you were safe whilst he couldn’t be here to protect you himself.  He asked me to get the crew to keep an eye out for you because he said he didn’t know what he’d do if anything happened to you.  He was muttering about needing to make a miracle or something.”
"It's a good job you have an end room with only an absent Mike on your other side, I don't think we succeeded in the attempt at keeping everything quiet; you're quite noisy it seems."
“Trains never come in early, Sherlock, you know that.”
“How many do you usually have then?”
The performance was going very well.  Everyone made their entrances on time and delivered their lines perfectly.  The props were all to hand, when needed, and everything was lit exactly right, and the gasp from the audience when they heard the loud gun shot, as the stage was momentarily pitched into darkness, was very satisfying.
“Sure, Greg.  Julian and I can bring you some ideas at our next session on Wednesday and we can go from there.”
John smiled at the shocked expression on Sherlock’s face.  He’d managed to surprise him for once so he made the most of the opportunity at holding Sherlock’s attention and sat down by him.
"I know.  Your eventual goal is to be a doctor, but you are also wavering towards joining the armed forces and so possibly combining the two aspirations.  I suspect you had a family member who was a serving officer."
Knowing Greg had climaxed, and that John should now have ingested as much fresh blood as he needed he pinched a nerve in the side of John's neck which made him yelp in pain and release his fangs from Greg's neck.  When John let go, Sherlock pulled him round so he could see his face and he saw John come back to himself and realise where he was.  John looked at Greg, just lolling euphorically in front of him.  He knew that look.  He looked down at Greg's crotch and saw evidence of what had just happened.  He leant forward to lick Greg's neck, cleaning up the puncture site and sealing it safely.  He looked back over at Sherlock.
John grinned, “How could I tell you if I didn’t know you were missing it?”
“You certainly did that, Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned on the laptop, smirking as he guessed the password to be WelcomeHomeLittleBrother.  He quickly changed it to something more suitable and plugged in the memory stick.  When he opened the single folder he was excited to see it contained a whole screen full of numbered sound files.  A plethora of insights into John’s feelings – this would be good.
“I’m sorry I had to do that, John.  There really was no other way out of the situation in which I found myself.”
“Do you still want us to bite you, Greg?”
“It’s alright, John, the paramedics are coming now, they’ll get you sorted.  You’ve obviously got a dislocated little finger, a swollen, possibly broken nose and probably a couple of ribs, too, judging by the way you’re holding yourself.  It doesn’t sound as if it’s punctured your lung though; I can’t detect a perceivable difference in your breathing pattern except for the exertion of being struck, of course.”
In the end John decided that enough was enough and he borrowed one of his dad’s ladders and leant it up against the wall outside Sherlock’s room.  He had seen Sherlock go in from a distance earlier and he was going to have it out with him.  He even came bearing gifts, as he thought Sherlock might be more amenable if there was something in it for him.  He climbed the ladder, having to balance precariously on the top rung to grab hold of the sill of Sherlock’s, fortunately, partially opened window.  Sherlock’s head shot up as he saw a hand pop into view.
John spent the next hour telling Greg everything he had learned from Sherlock and what he had experienced so far, how he was reacting to the changes and how much he still felt exactly like himself but just with a few extra added features.
“You have every say in the matter.  There would never be anyone else.”
What was he to do?  Truth or silence?  He thought about it for a few more moments and decided to hell with it.  He was a soldier.  Sherlock said ‘could be dangerous’ and here he was.  He wouldn’t cop out at this stage when he had the potential of everything he had ever hoped for in front of him.  Whether it was bravery or stupidity (as Mycroft had once suggested) he would risk it all and tell Sherlock how he felt.  He took a deep breath and looked at Sherlock.
“I’m down to only a pint a day and can go longer than that if necessary though it makes it more of a temptation so I’m still working on building up my tolerance with that.”
The rest of their year group had been together more or less all the way through the main school, and continuing on to the sixth form which was part of the same complex.  Having someone new in their ranks was very exciting and she had been the life of the party, much to Sherlock’s chagrin.
"Okay, okay."  John took pity on him and on the next pass downwards he stopped at Sherlock's hole and pressed a soft kiss to it.  He licked all round the entrance, working his way closer in each time.  As Sherlock relaxed into the movements and opened slightly, John pushed his tongue in to the centre, pressing in as far as he could.  He found this was also easier - as the deep-throating had been - without the need to pull back out to breathe.  He was already finding many pleasing side effects to this whole vampire thing.
John smiled; delighted in the ‘we’ in that sentence.  He would like nothing more than to sleep beside Sherlock again.  He allowed Sherlock to gently pull him up and they got themselves ready for bed.
The other boy looked puzzled for a moment.  “Why?”
“I have a contact in that casino and I want to get there before the police so I can work out the suspect and we can catch him before the police interfere.”
I’ve bought us a new big bed.  After our last experiences with that tiny thing in my Uni room I thought we deserved something luxurious, but now I find myself longing even more for your return.  I have Egyptian cotton sheets and all this space and no-one to share it with; on the rare occasions when I do sleep, I feel quite lost.
John laughed as he admitted that but he had noticed the pride and pleasure on Greg’s face when he had said Greg was one of the chosen few.  John had given him plenty more to think about and helped to calm any of his major worries he hoped.  Now it was up to Greg to think everything through and make his decision.
“Me thinks the gentleman doth protest too much.”
"Well, I think Sherlock and I could manage it between us if we had permission to use your machinery please, sir."
“Does Mike like her?”
“We will be achieving learning on a reward basis.”
“I thought you said you had organised the Plus Ones for us.”
“It’s just with the whole Hamlet and Yorick thing?”
Mycroft had arranged a minor situation for Mrs Hudson’s sister – nothing serious, of course, and it would be easily solved after the weekend, but it had necessitated a visit from Mrs Hudson so the house was empty when Sherlock was dropped off outside 221B.  He stroked the knocker fondly, remembering the number of times he had turned it after Mycroft had straightened it.  He did it again now, wondering if it was something John would notice.
So if he did want to continue living with Sherlock what would that mean?  Would Sherlock want to bite him?  Would he be constantly scared for his life?  He supposed it just came down to how he felt about Sherlock.  So how did he feel?  If you’d have asked him before this evening he would have said that he was well on the way to falling in love with the man so with this new information he had to ask himself deep down if his feelings had now changed?  Did he still feel like Sherlock was the only person he could see himself with?  Again, he had to be honest with himself, the answer was still yes.  Ok, so Sherlock was dangerous, but hadn’t he always been?  Even before John had found out about this new side of him, Sherlock had always lived on the edge and that had been exactly what had drawn John to him in the first place.  He loved the risk and the chance of running into danger with Sherlock so wasn’t this just another new aspect of that?  What was really different about their lives from a few hours ago except that Sherlock had revealed a hitherto unknown aspect of his persona?
"More.  Now."  John had turned single minded and monosyllabic in his need, but Sherlock was able to use his more controlled reflexes and years of practice to flip him over and hold him down with one arm across John's throat, the other pinning his hands above his head and his knees pressing down onto John's thighs keeping him immobilised.
It didn’t take too long before John’s fingers would pause momentarily and his voice would slow down as he found himself almost dropping off to sleep.  Each time, Sherlock rubbed up into his hand to restart that motion he was enjoying so much and John would jolt himself awake and begin reading again.  Eventually, though, both of them dropped off and John’s body gradually slumped down across the pillow above Sherlock’s head so that he was almost curled around him.
The main doors were all locked as they weren’t officially open until later in the afternoon, but Sherlock led the way around to a side door and after a complicated series of knocks they were let in.
“Well I haven’t had one before.”
He hadn't really paid much attention to the girls in his classes except for recognising their faces from seeing John smile at them.  They weren't really his area of interest - in fact, no-one was his area of interest except John - so he watched them now.  Kerry and Rachel, it seemed, were best friends and were looking at each other and raising eyebrows and smirking every time Jasmine was made to re-do her lines.  Hmm, it seemed they were not keen on Jasmine either, so it wasn't just people from her own year.  Hannah was sitting near enough to them to be a classroom friend, but was obviously not in their inner coterie.  He could sense an edge of envy in her eyes as she watched the play, but she wasn't focused on Jasmine as much as she was on Freddie.  Interesting.  It looked like Hannah wanted Freddie so the envy must be for Jasmine having him instead of herself.  Sherlock was fascinated and wondered what exactly Jasmine had done to inspire such dislike from so many of her fellow members.
"Oh go on, please?"
Until then, don’t do anything foolish.
“Are you intimating I’m not tactful, John?”
“Y’just said y’wanted me to talk.  Make y’mind up.”
John was up early to catch the coach to the station for his train.  Sherlock was being picked up by Mycroft on his way home from London, unfortunately, as far as he was concerned, so he had longer to wait.  He didn’t think he could bear saying goodbye to John in front of everyone, where he wouldn’t be able to touch him, so he didn’t go down to where the coach was getting ready to leave and, consequently, didn’t see John looking around everywhere for him.
John laughed but kept his arm raised, submitting to Sherlock’s examination.  When Sherlock had finished doing that arm he climbed over John, straddling his hips for a moment.  Unfortunately, as far as John was concerned, he didn’t pause there long enough for any more intimate contact before he climbed off the other side and repeated the whole touching and tasting process on John’s other arm.  He had to be careful of the broken fingers and the wrist burns again and also, this time, he couldn’t lift John’s arm quite as far due to the slightly limited range of movement caused by his shoulder injury but he did his best.
Thank you for your letter.  Our unit was chosen to receive a collection of letters from home and I was lucky enough to get yours so I thank you for the attention you gave to writing it, however, brief that may have been.  Do you really delete things from your brain – how does that even work?
They all ordered a drink - even Sherlock, after a glare from Mycroft and a huge sigh from himself – and sat at a round table in the corner where they had a full view of the room.  John sat by Sherlock against one wall and Greg manoeuvred himself next to Mycroft against the other.
“I suppose I’m meant to show gratitude.  Though if he’s still being bothered by journalists at this stage then it doesn’t say a lot for your success level.”
Stacey, who was in charge of the tech board, doing lights and sound, was also sighing quietly to herself, but her reason looked to be the opposite of Rebecca's.  She wasn't jealous of Jasmine for professional reasons; it seemed that it was definitely personal for her.  If Sherlock had to say anything he would say that she appeared almost wistful as she watched Jasmine.  He would say that they had been friends previously but had had a falling out or, more likely, that Stacey had been dumped by Jasmine; another victim of her popularity.
"Hey, I happen to be one of those idiots."
"Of course I meant it, Sherlock.  I thought you knew that by now."
“You could guess if you wished, or you could just let yourself go and enjoy what happens.”
You looked so thin and tired and your uniform was all torn up showing the dirty bandages underneath.  I was almost too scared to touch you; not wanting to injure you further, but even with that worry, I couldn’t stop myself from shouting your name.  To see the way your face just lit up when you realised I was there was beautiful.  It made all that I had been through worthwhile to know that you were so pleased to see me; that I hadn’t waited for you in vain.
"Aren't we all sitting together?"
“How true, they are all idiots, but putting the obvious aside; the reason I wasn’t interested in other people was because I already had what I wanted right beside me.  You just never noticed.”
“None of those things are a hardship, Sherlock.  I will always accept you for who you are, as you have always accepted me and seen more in me than anyone else ever has.  You saved me just as much as I saved you when we first met and you have not stopped amazing me ever since.  I won’t lie that it wasn’t hard when I thought you were dead but knowing that you did it for me and seeing the suffering that you went through as well means that, of course, I’d forgive you.”
He had never had anyone choose him in that manner before; who put his wishes before their own in so many instances too.  How many times had John walked out on dates, left work, given Sherlock his full attention when he had been involved in his own pursuits?  Even when John complained vociferously and berated Sherlock on his lack of consideration, he still accommodated his needs.  There surely was no man better than John Watson.
“If you were to open your eyes you might be able to see it is real and not a dream.”
“I’m sure you would, dear, but not everyone has your talents.  Is there anyone you would like to make something for?”
Sherlock looked surprised.  “Really?”
“Oh, come off it, it’s not that bad.  So… has Sherlock said something?”
They settled in to watch some crap telly and it wasn’t too long before the exertions of manoeuvring his sore body up all those stairs took its toll on John and he fell asleep.  Sherlock was sitting quite closely beside John on the sofa and was just contemplating whether he ought to escort his friend to slumber more comfortably in bed when John’s head slipped down to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder.
John didn’t exactly like the sound of being thought overwrought; it made him feel like one of the lower formers, over-excited about everything they saw, but he bore it manfully for the cause.
“That’s true enough; he is very generous.  John, can you hear me mate; are you ok?”
Two weeks later and John could tell that Sherlock had just about reached his limit at the enforced restrictions.  They had been increasing their walks every day and had even had a little exploration of the caves as well as following the course of both streams to the very edges of the property.
"Of course you're not, John.  You have already proved yourself above the usual level of school boy incompetence."
“Yes, but you don’t even drink from them.”
"Of course, John.  I am sorry.  Maybe there is something else I could do to help you relax."  Sherlock stroked his arm down John's side and watched as John's breath hitched and his pupils dilated, even though Sherlock could still see the tiredness underlying.  "Why don't you lie back down and let me do this for you then you can just fall back asleep?"
"Well, they've tried twice already and failed both times, I think it unlikely that that would put them off.  Like I said, we can all keep our eyes open to anything untoward happening.  I'm not needed, except for the very start of the play, so I'll stay around backstage and watch what's going on.  We'll catch whoever it is, don't worry."
“I… You… How did you know I was up here?”
“Do you really think a situation would arise whereby you needed to know how my under-arms smelled?”
John was shouting now and had moved closer, pointing his finger in Sherlock’s face.  Sherlock put out an arm and touched John’s wrist.
“Oh yes, Sherlock, that would be amazing.  You have the perfect sort of voice for that.  Will you do it?”
“Sorry, does it still hurt?”
“I think it would be sensible if you slept in my bed tonight, John.  It seems ridiculous to force yourself up another flight of stairs after the way it took it out of you earlier.”
Sherlock smiled at John and nodded his head in acceptance so John let it go, though he vowed to himself that he really would spend more time with Sherlock.
Sherlock pointed out some of the features as they got nearer.
"I bought it on my way to meet you, after I left my brother yesterday.  I got some condoms as well, so we're all prepared."
“Of course, Sherlock.  I will look forward to seeing you later.”
“Heard it so often… in my head… can’t tell what’s real.”
"Same as you, just the opposite end."
“I’ll get my mum to take a photo for you and then you can decide.”
“Come here, love.”  Sherlock blushed at the endearment and John smiled; they hadn’t used them before but John had wanted to try that out to see if it fit.  He liked it; especially if it made Sherlock react like that.
“Have a good look.  Bet you can tell how it happened and who did it an’ everythin’, can’t you.”
"Tedious."
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
“Sherlock.  Please?”
“Have you bitten a human?”
“Just leave it alone, it’s fine.”
By the time Sherlock deemed him ready, Greg, to his own surprise, was almost fully hard again.  He’d never recovered so quickly since his lust filled teens when there wasn’t much that wouldn’t turn him on and get him hard.
“So why did John bite me, then?  What was that all about?”
By the time he was finished he had a tune with which he was quite pleased.  The melody had the thread of the other tune woven through it with his own flairs and twirls added, and the words seemed to capture the allure of his mysterious neighbour.
“You’re not being very clear, John, are you asking for your clothes off or mine?”
They spent the time catching up on each other’s lives during the last ten years.  Sherlock was keen to know what life had been like in the army and John had been fascinated by Sherlock’s new occupation with assisting the police with their investigations.  He even got to meet the DI that Sherlock was working with when Sherlock had told the man that he could bring the recent crime scene photos to him at the hospital as he couldn’t leave at the moment.
“John!  I need…?”
“We discussed so many things this morning; to what specifically are you referring?”
Sherlock pressed his tongue into the pulse and felt the speed of John's blood racing through his excited body.  He extended his fangs and bit down as he pushed deeply into John's body and as he swallowed down a few mouthfuls of blood he felt a quiver around his shaft as John pulsed out his release between them.  That was all it took for Sherlock; he thrust in one more time and he came as he drank, taking from one part as he gave to another.
“I think you may be the only one who would say that, John.  I don’t think anyone else loves that never-ending curiosity.”
“Really?  That would be great.  Oh, but I haven’t brought any swimming gear with me.”
"You see but you do not observe.  That's everyone's problem."
"No, I think I can quite happily say that's the last place I want to be tonight.  Sarah can sort out her own problems.  Let's go."
John lay on his back with his knees bent up, exposing himself to Sherlock.  He blushed again, but Sherlock was having none of that.  He bent forwards and trailed his tongue up John’s shaft, something with which they were both comfortable, and the familiar sensation calmed John down.  Sherlock coated his fingers and, whilst still licking John to distract him, he gently circled John’s hole with one finger.  Sherlock waited until John had relaxed again, after the initial tensing of muscles at the touch, and he timed it so he swallowed down John’s cock and pushed one finger in at the same time.
John grinned at him and crooked his finger to beckon Sherlock nearer.
"I'm having way too much fun."  John laughed and smacked Sherlock's arse again three times in rapid succession.  Sherlock groaned and ground his hips into the pillow, trying to get any kind of friction he could.  "Hey, that's cheating."
John went to his bags where there was a suit bag fastened on to the straps of his back pack.  He had taken it all the way up to Scotland just to make sure that he had it with him ready for the party.  He had been to a family wedding earlier in the year and had bought a smart, new suit for that and, luckily, he hadn’t grown too much over the summer so it still fit him nicely.  Sherlock took it out and headed down to the kitchens, but conveniently, he met a maid on the way.  He gave her John’s suit with strict instructions to treat it very carefully and to bring it back to his room as soon as they were done.
Greg groaned again as he felt darts of pleasure shoot to his cock every time John took a draught from his neck.  He quivered and his hand tightened around John's body.  Sherlock smiled as he watched him unknowingly rubbing himself against John's body, trying to get more friction.  Sherlock stretched his arm round and stroked against Greg's clothed cock a few times then watched him shudder as he came in his trousers, his head falling back and a blissed out look on his face.
John’s rambling came to a halt as he looked at Sherlock through his lowered lashes.
9th July
Sherlock towed him quickly out before his mother thought of something else she wanted to add.  He wanted John to see his rooms; he’d never had anyone else he’d wanted to show around before and he wanted to know John’s opinion.
It's explanation time.  See how Greg takes the news.  Then enjoy a little Sherlock and John fun.
“Fine!  You’re strong enough to carry me, now put me down before you hurt yourself.”
Sherlock groaned and his eyes fell shut.  He grabbed hold of John’s face and pulled him up so that he could reach his mouth.  He kissed him hard and fast, desperate to taste those lips which had been tormenting him.  John opened his mouth and let Sherlock in, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and holding him close.  Sherlock rapidly unfastened John’s buttons, needing to reveal that delectable skin, and unable to wait any longer and tease as he’d been planning.  He pushed the shirt off and leaned forward to trail his lips down John’s body.  He paused for a moment at the nipples, sucking one and tweaking the other, and then he swapped over so that he tasted both.  The angle was a bit steep for him to reach any lower, so he went down on his knees, which put him in a much better position.  He wrapped his arms around John’s back and pulled him close, kissing down his stomach.  John’s hands massaged Sherlock’s head as he held on tight.
John slid his hand up the length of Sherlock's cock then back down again and cupped his balls, pulling them lightly.  Sherlock copied him and on his next pass upwards he gave a little twist of the head of the shaft which made John gasp.  Sherlock brought his finger to his lips as John had done and grinned at him.  Oh, it was definitely on.  Both of them tried their hardest to get the other to make some kind of noise whilst trying to resist the temptation themselves.  Sherlock was biting his lip to keep himself quiet and John resorted to bringing his other hand to his mouth and chewing on a knuckle.
“If I didn’t wish to talk to you, I wouldn’t have come over here.”
Sherlock slicked up his cock and pulled back to allow John to turn over.
“That’s what I thought.  It’s better than those other wishy-washy, made-up shapes.”
"Plus now I have these," John let his fangs drop down, "which you are already intimately acquainted with, I think."
“I don’t care.  I want to be able to see you as you come inside me.”
I certainly don’t plan to toil as a lowly police officer – boring; and just imagine the paperwork!  I have already decided I will be a Consulting Detective.  I follow current police crimes in the newspaper and ring in with information to solve the case as they seem quite incapable of doing so themselves.  I have not had much support so far, though.  They are more concerned about questioning me than following up on my information.  Idiots!
“I live in London.  He spoke to my mother when he asked her for time off and she rang me to let me know.”
"You're very honoured; he doesn't usually let anyone touch him except for myself and Toby, the head groom."
John had more or less decided he was going to ask Sherlock out for a proper date.  He just had to get his nerve up to put his plan into action.  He had a few doubts about going ahead, his main one being that he didn’t want to risk ruining the friendship they already had and his second being why on earth would Sherlock be interested in him of all people when he could have anyone he wanted.
John blinked his eyes open again and mumbled.  “Lov…”
“That’s everything in hand then.  Shall we wheel this over to the studios and we can store it all away ready for when we need it.”  John pushed the trolley towards the door, which Sherlock opened for him, and they took it all over to their rehearsal room and unloaded it on to one of the tables.  Then they took the trolley back to the caretaker and headed back to their common room to relax for the rest of the evening.
He was glad that John had forced his way in to his room and the air seemed to have cleared enough for them to go back to being friends.  In fact, he felt so pleased to see John again that he even refrained from mentioning the fact that the girl had obviously cheated on him to cause him to end things.  It wouldn’t be the last time this happened, he was sure, but Sherlock decided he would play it differently the next time.  He would be better served by monopolising John’s attention not avoiding it.  Happy with this future plan, Sherlock allowed John back into his life and things soon returned to normal.
Sherlock grinned at him, “I’ve always been a fast learner.”
"What services have you rendered unto myself?"
“Yes, you want it, don’t you?”
He shouldn't have listened to Gavin when he set him up for this 'date'.  He didn't go on dates and if he did he wouldn't need to have one set up by Graham.  He only put up with the guy because he was the one vaguely intelligent person in his criminology lectures and that wasn't saying much.  Geoff often asked Sherlock to join him at one of the regular Friday night campus parties.  It was on the one occasion that he had caved to the constant requests when he had apparently been spotted by this so-called-friend who had since asked to meet him.  Sherlock had left too early to meet this person on that occasion as he had more or less walked in to the party, seen what sort of idiots were there, insulted several of them, then turned round and walked out again.
Sherlock dialled John’s number again and pressed the speaker button.  Luckily John didn’t answer, or that would have upset Sherlock’s plans, and they both listened as the answerphone message played again.  Sherlock still couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing and sat staring at the phone until Martin interrupted.
Sherlock sighed again and a puff of flour floated in to the air.
“Considering the number of journalists I have actually stopped from bothering him I would say that the persistent one or two remaining seem to be merely trying their luck for a bit of excitement rather than from any real hope of a genuine story.  Regardless of that, would you just sign these forms for me, please, and I can complete the revivification process.”
“He was rabbiting on about some pass he’d made and all I could think about was the pass I wanted to make – and it wasn’t on the rugby field.”  John winked at him.  “Now, why don’t you come over here?”
Even though John now knew that Sherlock was alive, he still found it hard to talk about.  The emotions he had been going through had been very real and were still so fresh in his mind.
John did, indeed, remember that frog.  It had been his peace offering to Sherlock after that incident when he’d had his first girlfriend.  Now, here it was on Valentine’s Day and Sherlock had sent him a box of cakes and a heart.  What was he to make of that?  Did Sherlock even know what that meant?
John smiled at him.  "I told you they were good.  Do you fancy another; you look as if you haven't eaten all day?"
"Oh, that was just perfect.  Such diction.  You're the ideal radio voice.  Thanks for agreeing to do it."
“Mmmm, you were quite right, John, he does taste delicious.”
“You sleep?”  John clumsily patted the bed.
“It was quite evident, John, but I didn’t consciously put it all together until lunch time today, when I saw Julian’s mother tearfully telling him that they would not be able to pay the fees for Julian to finish another term here at Shaw’s.”
Sherlock went straight over to John, as an armed tactical team followed behind him, easily subduing the other man and taking them both away as Sherlock bent to untie John.  He noticed the empty syringe lying on the floor at John’s feet.
“That was bloody fantastic.  Thank you for the opportunity to experience that with you.”
They were waiting for it all to dry now and then they would just need to varnish it and attach the accessories and it would be done.  Mr Johnson gave John the key to the workshop so that they would be able to come in at the weekend to do the varnishing – he didn’t mind them doing that without him at least being in the building as they was no machinery involved.  It wasn’t that he didn’t trust them to be safe but there were all these health and safety regulations that had to be adhered to around machinery.
The policeman clapped on his handcuffs and radioed in for a car to come and collect the prisoner whilst Sherlock went through his deductions again with John looking on proudly.  The policeman made a note of everything in his book and took Sherlock's details as well.
John blushed at that and gave Sherlock a shy smile.  “Thank you, Sherlock.  I mean it.  Thank you for rescuing me once again, too.  What would I do without you?”
John started laughing and Sherlock quickly joined in.  This was what he had missed; the comfortable camaraderie and honest friendship that John had always offered him.  He had never had that with anyone else and he was perfectly happy with that being a fact.  What did he need anyone else for when he had John?
John chased after Sherlock, thinking he must have dashed off quickly as he couldn’t see him anywhere.  He was suddenly grabbed by an arm sticking out from behind the wall where Sherlock had ducked as soon as he was out of sight and now he pulled John in too, kissing him and chuckling at the surprise on his face.
“I’m a very strong lead, John, you won’t be embarrassed by me, I can assure you.”
"Excellent, John.  Those rugby skills really paid off."
“You may.”
He clicked into his text program and sent a single message to Sherlock before turning off his phone so that he wouldn’t see the, no doubt, countless replies he would receive.  He got undressed and into bed and lay tossing and turning in the dark, until he finally fell asleep in the early hours; trying to convince himself that everything was fine, and it would all work out, and Sherlock would be okay.
The villa was reached by travelling down a winding drive through the property’s own little wood with a babbling brook running alongside.  Sherlock informed John that it joined up with another stream which traversed the other side of the property further down its course and then emptied out into the sea which was a mile and a half walk away with their own private beach.  John was delighted with the prospect of exploring and spending time on the beach, and was determined to get Sherlock to stay long enough for him to be well enough to make that happen.
Backstage:
Of course, I consider you a friend already.  We have exchanged letters and gifts and now photographs as well.  If you haven’t had one before then I shall be honoured to be your first and I certainly won’t tell you to piss off.  I can only assume that those other people didn’t give you a chance to be yourself so it’s their loss.  I’m glad that you were pleased with what I said.  I think if you’ve never heard things like that before then you have every right to enjoy it without being vain.  You really are amazing.
Greg’s knees nearly collapsed at the dual sensations.  It was only the fact that John and Sherlock both had a hand behind his back that kept him up.  His head fell back and he moaned deeply.  John and Sherlock caught each other’s eye and nodded as they seemed to read each other’s minds.  At the same moment they bit down harder on each side and held on tight as a shiver went through Greg in reaction and he almost buckled again.  They eased him backwards and sat him on the end of the bed.  His hands just fell to his sides and he sat there with a glazed look on his face.
“I haven’t really needed to go out and find somebody I was interested in because I already had someone here with whom I wanted to spend my time.  You, in fact.  I want to spend my time with you.  Well, I do spend my time with you, I know.  But I mean I want to spend more time with you and do other things.  Different things.  More… more romantic things.  Hell, I want to do everything with you. Let’s just be done with it and admit it - I love you, Sherlock and I want to be in a relationship with you.  There I’ve said it and if you want me to leave that’s fine, I’ll get packed as soon as I can.”
"Oh yes, could we do that tonight for the party and scare my cousins?"
“I must make my own confession that his last drink also contained a little something the team in the basement has been working on which may have loosened his tongue a little more than usual.  You merely needed to provide him with the right opening and he followed through perfectly.  Well done, John.”
Greg blushed again, this time out of pride at receiving such acknowledgements from his friends.  It was rare indeed for Sherlock to compliment anyone as he knew only too well.
John snuffled against the soft skin in front of him, his lips pressing lightly against Sherlock neck, causing him to instantly tense, before he once more relaxed when John let out a contented hum against him which reverberated through his very pores.
“How do you think?  He-who-knows-everything told me.  I got pizza because I thought even if you were a bit late we could stick it in the oven just to warm through if necessary.  It should still be okay now though.”
“Like my message said that was, unfortunately, a necessary subterfuge – your life was in danger; I had to disappear for a while to keep you safe.”
Sherlock turned back and licked his lips.
John swallowed hard and blinked his eyes rapidly, overcome by the emotion of it all.
“Wow, yeah, sure, I’d love it.  If it’s okay with you guys?  I wouldn’t want to upset your relationship or anything.”
"Ah, now you will see the benefit of the coat I brought with me."
The drama department storage room was quite large and split into four areas.  To one side there were some scenery flats, already painted from previous productions, which they might be able to adapt for their purposes, but they would leave that to the others to sort out and see what was suitable.  There was an area with some larger items of furniture; a sofa and chairs, a couple of tables and some upright dining chairs, which would all be useful for setting the scene.  They could come over as a group and collect these later when they got further into the rehearsal stages.  They ignored the costume area, knowing that other members of the team would be going through the racks to see if there was anything they could adapt for their production.
That didn’t mean they had been entirely innocent in the intervening time, though.  They had been learning each other’s bodies; finding sensitive spots and erogenous zones; testing the taste and texture of skin with fingers and mouths and bringing each other pleasure with delicious regularity.
