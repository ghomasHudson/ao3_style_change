Dean stared at him for a moment, and then exhaled, “Uh… I think so? Well, yeah. I mean, I wanted to know where Natalie is. And I don’t know why I’m so chill in asking you about her right now, but know that I’m probably high as fuck from these meds and-“
Castiel could only nod. Dean stood up and carefully helped him up. Castiel wasn’t hurt. Not physically anyway. He was just tired, his body ached from all of this. “I’m not hurt,” Castiel managed to say as they made their way to the bathroom.
“Want some company?” the question left Alfie’s mouth before Castiel finished his sentence. While the thought was tempting, Castiel needed to have the night to himself. He said so to Alfie, not the first part, who only nodded and went to one of the guest bedrooms. The door shutting behind him softly.
“Here,” Castiel said, as he took off his coat and draped it over her shaking shoulders. She hiccupped and looked at Castiel in mild surprised, before she looked down. “You’re Dean’s Charlie, aren’t you?” he asked, his voice soft. Charlie sniffed again, and looked at him. Slowly, she nodded. Castiel nodded back and said, “I remember seeing you at the garage.”
“I can try, but you’re just too damn hot,” Dean replied. He was shaking, and his voice was slurring a bit, but he still had his cocky smile on his lips that Castiel found infatuating.
Castiel grabbed his phone and saw that he had multiple missed calls. Most of them from Sam. Something tight gripped his windpipe, and he breathed through the clawing panic. He would talk to Sam once they’d reach the hospital. He saw that his recent call was from one of his men that was in Crowley’s team. It was one of his new men, his name was Gadreel. He was a good man. Castiel dialed his number, and tried not to sound so choked up as he told him to find them in here.
, in this case, was Amara."
Not long after, Dean’s eyes started to droop and Castiel moved them around a bit to get more comfortable in bed to sleep. Dean had tucked himself closer and under Castiel’s chin. Castiel had wrapped his arm around Dean’s form, running his hand up and down his spine, feeling how his body shifted as he breathed deeply in and out. Castiel felt himself being lulled to sleep himself, by the calmness that emitted out of Dean.
“I know what you are,” he said and Dean sort of frowned at him.
Castiel was wearing black bulletproof pants, a navy colored button down, the sleeves rolled up, and a black vest on top that hugged his clothes close to his body. He flicked off a dust from his pants, and grabbed the handle of the car door, and opened it. He stepped out of the car and let out a sigh that was a bit shaky. Alfie followed suit and stood beside him, waiting for orders. Castiel gave him a slight look and Alfie got his black coat from the car and draped over his shoulders. Castiel grabbed the edges and moved it forward for a bit as he walked the steps up to the
It took Dean a moment to realize what she was talking about. Feeling unsteady, he stood up. His back screamed with the protest of him moving so quickly, but he ignored it. “Don’t do anything, mistress.”
“Dean,” Castiel rumbled, and closed his eyes. “I wish I knew how to quit you, and how to say
“Sir… I think that shouldn’t be a reason for you to not keep me in the loop,” Dean said slowly. “I think that whatever you say to me, won’t change anything because once they find out about me, they won’t… they won’t keep their distance from me.”
She sighed in an overly dramatic way, and said, “Fine. But you gotta mix up two boxes together.”
Castiel had to drag himself away from the table. He turned to look at his brother, wanting to go to him and get him out of that chair. To take care of him. But he didn’t. He couldn’t. He rubbed a hand over his face and shook his head. It was better to just walk away. He turned around to walk to the doors when Alastair called his name. Castiel stopped, for some goddamn reason he stopped, but he didn’t turn around.
“You did? That’s good. You deserve better.”
Crowley “hmph”ed at him, but didn’t say anything. They both knew there was no point for them to continue about how much Castiel cared about his people. They were, practically, his family. His father had built this from zero. And yes, a lot of men has been changed in time, but they all knew the cost for serving to the Novaks, and they all knew that someday they were going to get killed. But some of them, Samandriel in this case, were way too young to be gone so soon.
“Excuse us,” Dean said to Castiel, and he nodded at him. They went down the hall, away from Castiel and Sam.
“If I have to, I will. Since you’re being lazy,” Dean said with mock-seriousness. But then he cracked and gave Castiel a wink. “C’mon old man, chop chop.”
“Let’s get you cleaned up,” a short lady said with a hard face that looked eerily similar to Crowley’s. She had brown hair and dark brown eyes that seemed to bore into his eyes.
He had called his men on duty, who were assigned to look after Dean to see what was happening. They told him that he was back home at this time of the evening, and hadn’t left the building yet. Castiel relaxed back in his chair and looked at his phone again.
They were silent, looking at one another from a distance between each other. Dean could feel the tension in the air between them. It was suffocating him. He suddenly realized that he didn’t want for Castiel to not be part of his life. He realized that he needed Castiel in his life. Right now. He needed him back into his life. But there was so much that he didn’t know about the man in front of him. And one of the many things was the fact that Castiel wouldn’t allow him to touch him. The way Dean wanted to touch him.
Castiel’s inside turned to cold fury. He had sworn to protect his family, and these assholes thought they could get away with demolishing what he had built in years. Well, fuck those people.
“Hmm… how is it without Lisa?” she asked in a lower voice.
“Dean,” she said.
“I wouldn’t,” Dean whispered out, his voice scratchy. He was completely covered in sweat. Castiel couldn’t help himself; he tilted his head down and licked at Dean’s sweaty neck. Dean turned his head to the side to give more access to Castiel. Castiel lingered there for a second longer, before he pushed back up, placed his hands beside Dean’s waist and started to move his hips.
Castiel walked back around the desk, and situated himself in between Dean’s legs. He grabbed onto Dean’s hips and pulled him over the edge again. “But I have plans,” he said as he pushed Dean’s legs up and towards his chest. He grabbed his dick with his other hand and guided him into Dean.
Castiel made his way to the back of the diner. One of the waiters noticed him there, and he froze; his eyes widened and he tightened his hold on the coffee jar. He nodded at Castiel, before he continued with his job. Castiel noticed that his hands were shaking as he refilled one of the customer’s coffee mug.
“Hands
Dean’s body was glowing under the morning sun. They only left one of the windows open, without covering it with the curtains, but it was enough to give off the light inside. Dean was laying down on his front, his hands clutching the pillow underneath his head, his full lips pouting, his face relaxed. He looked incredible pretty like this and Castiel leaned forward to place a soft kiss to his cheek.
“Hello, Dean,” Mr. Novak said and Dean had to suppress a shudder. It seemed that at the early hours of the morning, Mr. Novak's voice held a deeper tone to it. It was something that Dean had to get used to, and train his body to not react the way it was reacting right now. A full body shudder and his dick straining, even more, on the bed? Yeah, no, he had to control himself.
“A girl?”
“I like your soul. And heart. And everything that is
“I’m okay, I guess, all things considered,” she replied with a small shrug and a smile. “How are you?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean said, his heart beating harder.
“You wanna drag in lawyers and all that jazz?”
Castiel felt the same emotions as before, only ten times worse. But he couldn’t say anything. He didn’t even nod his consent for Dean to do it. Dean just started to wash him. Castiel felt… he felt raw. Naked. Not the physical part, but more emotionally naked than he had ever let anyone see him. He never felt this vulnerable in front of anyone, never let anyone to see him this way.
Dean regained consciousness when he felt prodding in his lower half of his body. He gritted his teeth as he felt something hard and slightly dry go up his anus. He knew what it was and he internally groaned at it.
It happened on a Tuesday morning, 3 days later from that conversation. Castiel and Dean were having breakfast, alone in the kitchen, when Dean’s phone chirped. His phone lit up and Castiel managed to see the name of the text message, but he didn’t get to see what was being said. Dean picked up his phone and unlocked it. He grabbed his mug to take a sip of his coffee, but it slipped from his fingers as he continued to stare at his phone. His hand started to shake, his eyes widened…
Castiel looked at himself in the mirror; he was wearing a black suit, with a navy colored button down shirt. His hair was tamer than usual. He wore his family ring on his point finger. On his way out of the bedroom he grabbed his coat from the hanger, draped it over his arm. Alfie was waiting for him by the door so Castiel gave him the coat to hold. Alfie was going to be close by Castiel tonight for safety. They didn’t know what she had in mind.
“Look, can you come to
“That sounds so cool, though.”
“I don’t give a fuck what you think I should be doing. I need to know where my daughter is.”
“Not a problem,” Castiel said. “How have you been?”
To which they arrived, five minutes later.
…” Dean said, breath tickling Castiel’s neck. His voice low as if he was just talking to himself, but loud enough that made Castiel’s heart soar. Castiel didn’t know what to do, or how to word out whatever he wanted to say, so he just turned his head and placed a small kiss on Dean’s temple.
“It’s a New York, Dean. Everyone has a fancy car,” Jessica said in a matter-of-fact tone.
“Whatever had been his, Dean would’ve told you about this himself,” Sam said. “In time.”
“Where’s your new boy-toy? I haven’t seen much of him.”
Dean tuned on the radio to his favorite station, where they would usually play classic rock.
, haven’t you?”
“Thank you! See, even Eileen knows. And you’re a lawyer too.”
The last 3 days passed by in a blur. They had loads of fun together. Dean took her to the zoo, to the amusement park. They even rented out bicycles to drive around the park, since they didn’t take hers with them. The nights weren’t the easiest, since she would almost always throw a tantrum before bed, and it would take a while to get her to quiet down enough to sleep. But it seemed like she’d never run out of energy. Either way, Dean wouldn’t change the days that he spent with his daughter. He loved her too much to have her any other way.
“Is that why Julie wasn’t so accepting of her?”
His father sounded indifferent. As if he didn’t just kill his cousin in front of his son’s eyes. As if he was just talking about the weather. It was a hard thing to witness, but it was something that made Castiel be stronger in life. To not expect anything less, or more, from people. To demand loyalty and honesty from his people, from his family. To not be afraid to question family… To be able to take the gun in his hand and the life of the person who betrayed his trust.
“Come for me on the third upstroke,” Mr. Novak breathed out into his ear and Dean shuddered at the feeling. He tried to count them, he really did, but it was probably on the second one when he started to let go. He let out a whimper and then cried out, his whole body strung tight. When he was done, he could feel his come all over his chest, cooling.
“I just-I wanted to thank you for your help, the other day? It helped me a lot, and took off some of the pressure from my back.”
“Is that why you’re making your way to the play room?”
Castiel really hoped that he was going to find them well and alive. He didn’t know what he’d do if he didn’t find them. Castiel sat up as his breathing got a bit shorter than before. He closed his eyes and breathed in and out as slowly as he could. He never gotten so bad before. He knew he had depressive tendencies, and his anxiety was always close to the surface, but this was different. This was like a storm that he couldn’t handle with his shaking hands. This was like a tsunami waiting to sweep Castiel up and just leave him hanging.
“Get Charlie here, right now. You go after her.”
"Oh God," she said, her words muffled since she was covering her mouth with her hand. "Is that… is that what I think it is?"
“Hey,” Dean said and then indicated at the time on his phone, to show it to her. “See? 10:00 a.m.”
“What are you doing?”
“Why did they pick these places?” Crowley asked, looking down at the map of the city. Castiel had rounded the places on it which Lucifer gave him a week ago. “I like
He swung it at her face and she went down with a groan. The fourth girl threw several knives at him, but he ducked down. He dropped to the ground and shuffled closer to the girl that he hit with the pan. With his free hand he punched at her windpipe and she wheezed out. She was struggling to breath, but Castiel didn’t stay behind to see her recover. He moved forward some more and pulled the fourth girl’s leg. She went down with a shout, the knife she had in her hand dropping. Castiel lounged for it, just as the girl’s hand covered the tilt. Castiel still grabbed it and as he twisted her arm, her bone snapped in an unnatural way and she cried out in pain. Castiel pushed the knife down into her mouth and she gagged around it. Blood sprout out of her mouth and her eyes bugged with the blood. It wasn’t a pretty sight, but Castiel didn’t stop. He moved her hand up and down, stabbing herself more than once, to make sure she was dead.
“I’ll show you who the old man is,” Castiel grunted as he delivered a particularly hard one. Dean’s moans only ascended in crescendo with each hit.
“I’m going in alone,” Castiel got out of the car. He heard Crowley scrambling up behind him to follow.
“That was generous of you, boss.” One of his men told him, but he didn't answer.
He had Mr. Novak for that.
Leave me your thoughts please~
alive
Once it was done, a piece from the cake was placed in front of him. He took a bite from it and his eyes slipped shut and a small groan left his mouth. The cake literally melted inside his mouth. “What is this? It's amazing.”
Dean sat back up straight and cocked his head to the side, waiting. Mr. Novak drank his whiskey, snapped his fingers and a waiter poured him another glass. “You need to leave your jacket behind.”
“Why not?” she asked, with a frown on her own face.
“Your wish, is my command,” Castiel replied, as he straightened his spine, and stared right back at Dean.
“What do you think?” Crowley arched an eyebrow at him. Castiel sighed. He knew he had to make an arrangement for that, if Dean agreed to stay with him. “Where is Gabriel?”
Few days later, here Dean was, getting ready to leave on a Queen jet that looked incredibly big for being a private flight. Mr. Novak had assured him that the inside was so comfortable looking that Dean wouldn’t even know he was in an airplane, nor that he was flying. Dean had hang on to his words as if he was a drowning man, but now here he was, minutes away from actually flying, and his nerves were kicking in.
Castiel realized that they have reached a territory that he has never been to before. They have reached to a point where feelings had seeped into their work, and it was a feeling that Castiel wasn’t really familiar with. He knew how to keep his emotions at bay. How to keep himself closed off and not feel love or any of those silly things for other human beings. He was okay with caring, but love? No. He refused to love.
Mr. Novak gave him a smirk and pointed at the box on the small table by the armchair. Dean hadn’t noticed it at first, too preoccupied with the furniture and the colors. He made his way to it and picked up the box. He rolled his eyes as he saw the pink ribbon bow on top of it, and turned around to look at Mr. Novak. Dean blushed as he caught Mr. Novak’s eyes flickering up to his face, from his ass. “You were staring,” Dean pointed out, wiggling the box in his hand, trying to figure out what it was.
“What happened to your shoulder?” Castiel asked, taking a small step forward. Dean replied to him by taking one back. Castiel stopped and clenched his jaw.
In this case, Balthazar wouldn’t budge. He knew, because he tried to convince them to go about an hour or two ago, but they simply shook their heads. So he made them coffees and took it out. They were hesitant at first, but then they agreed, with a joke or two, and took the mugs from him.
Much too soon, Mr. Novak pulled back, his breathing ragged, like Dean’s, but his voice was steady as he said. “Dean, I know you’re scared, and that airplanes don’t make sense for you. But please, trust me when I say, you won’t even know you’re in the air.”
“Your family,” Castiel said. “Aside from your brother, the others don’t know about my existence. Or who I am to you.”
He just needed time.
was certainly the one who looked beautiful. There was no argument about it. No questions asked. He was simply beautiful.
In between the re-search, and taking care of his boss and his needs, Balthazar was keeping a close eye to the business. The furniture they were receiving from Africa was in good condition, and the business had blossomed from there and on, but that job didn’t cover their expanses, so they had to move to other stuff. The next best thing were drugs. So they started to get more involved in it. From the start of things, when dealers would bring in drugs into the country, it all went through Castiel's system to be approved of. He never used drugs, but he understood and knew which ones he would allow to his city. So they started to get more involved. Right now, they were the biggest dealers, and they got their drugs from trusted sources. Now that Castiel knew that Dean had been using, Castiel had ordered Balthazar to question his dealers to make sure that none of them were selling their stuff to Dean. People, of course, knew who Dean was for Castiel, and they wouldn’t betray the trust Castiel had for his people.
“The money should already be in your account,” he said instead. “And I hope that we won’t have this type of conversation every month, yeah? It’s one thing for you to divorce me because of a past that I had, and another when you doubt me and belittle me while doing so. I won’t stand for it. Now, is she ready?”
It was a footage from yesterday, around midnight. Castiel recognized the scene as being one of their frequently visited restaurant’s kitchen. It looked like it was a busy night and the chef was working pretty fast trying to get the orders out. He’s working close to the frying pan, and then, out of nowhere, the chef dropped down. Castel looked closely, pulling his phone closer to his face, and waited for him to get up, but then the floor started to get matted with blood. Castiel let his hand fall down on his lap. He felt numb. He didn’t know what to do.
The nurse was staring at him like a hawk. Castiel nodded, once, and she seemed to sigh in relief as she led him into one of the exam rooms. It seemed to close out the noise from the outside and as Castiel sat on the bed, he realized that he had an awful headache. He needed this silence.
“Can I talk to you? In private?” Dean asked, as he stared at the others. There was a young boy, that was sitting close to the table. He looked young enough to be a teenager. And Dean had no idea what Castiel had been thinking to recruit this person. But it wasn’t his place to ask such things. So he just ended up glaring at the boy, who quickly turned his stare away, and directed it at the table. Good. Maybe he’ll learn his place.
PS: The chapters were/are being updated weekly, but I'm afraid that there'll come a time when it'll take a bit longer to update them. Thank you for your patience!
“Dean…” he took a small step towards Dean.
Sorry for the late post, guys. Life is a busy thing for me these days :)
“Dude, I just finished editing your book.”
“Mr. Novak-“
At 10:00 a.m. sharp, Dean knocked on the door and waited as it was pulled open. Lisa hadn’t changed at all. She was tanned, her white teeth shone as she gave Dean a forced smile, and there were bags under her eyes. She looked tired, and yet, she still managed to look presentable.
The table was silent. The only sound there was, was of the squelching the blood would make as it would leave the meat. And the clattering of the silverware as he cut the meat. It was disgusting. Castiel didn’t know how he was going to be able to eat his meal, but he was going to try anyway. Castiel stared at Alastair as he placed the meat in his mouth and let out a hum of content, his eyes fluttering shut, and then re-opening again. His eyes landed on Castiel as he swallowed, and said.
“Not in the next 10 minutes,” she replied. “So, what are you going to do about this whole thing?”
“In my line of work, some things happen without us having control over it. Some things leave scars. Permanent scars. Be it your skin, or be it in ink. I have both of them. Some scars are bigger than the others. Some scars hold more than I can explain. I can’t promise you that I can tell you everything that you will see on my body today. Maybe in time, if you will still want to be with me after this,” Castiel said, lifting his hands up and gripping the front of his shirt. “I want you to be vocal with me, okay?”
There. Right across the street from him, stood Dean Winchester. His eyes wide and his cheeks full of red blush. His hair wild, as if he had run his hands through them more than once. He was talking on the phone with someone. Castiel wouldn’t know who he was talking to, or who would make him look so at ease. Maybe his brother? But then Castiel remembered that Dean hadn’t spoken to his brother for years now. Or Charlie said so.
“Strip.”
“I was hoping we'd have dinner together before I'll give you the tour of the house,” Mr. Novak said as he indicated to the table. But Dean's attention was snatched by the gorgeous scene outside. The big windows were something that Mr. Novak seemed to love, and it was worth it. The windows were looking out at the backyard which seemed to be endless. The setting sun was visible from here and it painted a great view, shadowing over the tall trees.
So he did the only thing that he could do right now; he ran.
“So, Dean, tell me more about yourself. What do you do for living?” Mr. Novak asked as he delicately cut through his meat. Dean, absentmindedly noticed how long and delicate his fingers were.
“He is. He so is,” there was a dreamy sigh from one of them. And Dean let himself smirk. “It’s another shame though.”
Castiel smiled thinly at the windows, but stayed quiet. He didn’t know what to say. He felt Dean shuffle at his side; he was restless. His hands wringing and his leg kept bouncing. Castiel once again wanted to reach out and place his hand over Dean’s leg to stop, but he didn’t. Instead, he turned his head and looked at Dean’s profile.
He quickly rinsed and stepped out of the shower. He grabbed the towel off the rail and started to dry himself up. He put his underwear on, and hesitated only for a moment, before he grabbed his clothes in his hands and walked out. Thankfully, the only person that was in the room was still the nurse. She eyeballed him for a moment, before she turned her head and started arranging her tray by the bed.
“Hm?”
Crowley looked up from his phone with a raise eyebrow. “You’re still on it?”
“Yes. For 3 more days.”
Dean went limp as soon as he was done. His whole chest was covered in sweat and spunk. He let out a soft whimper when Mr. Novak held him up with one arm and released Dean's arms from the rails and rested them over his shoulders, the handcuffs still on. Dean quickly snuggled closer to him, and Mr. Novak enveloped him in a tight hug.
“Go and rest in one of the guest bedrooms,” Castiel replied. “There’s bathroom and a shower. I’m positive there might be some change of clothes there too.”
There was warmness that was all over Castiel’s body. The heat from Dean’s bare body on his back, and the sun glaring from the outside on his front. He let out a sigh of sleepiness and scratched at his arm. He tried to go back to sleep, but he felt the feeling of being watched. As far as he was concerned, Dean was fast asleep. He was also certain that Dean had drooled on his back during the night.
“Knock on wood, sister. I’m not ready to lose him yet,” Castiel said as he took another sip of his coffee. He grabbed his sunglasses from the table and placed them on his nose, to shield him from the glare of the sun. Or not to look into his sister’s eyes.
When Dean slipped inside, he thought that they were gone to sleep. He was just about to cross through the living room when Sam walked out of the kitchen, two bottle of waters in his hand. The brothers stared at one another. They didn’t say anything to each other; they didn’t need to. Sam just walked up to Dean and gave him a firm hug.
Castiel clenched his jaw and hesitated. He knew he wasn’t going to be able to go and see Dean right now. He looked down the hall, and noticed that most of his men were being treated to gunshot wounds. No one seemed to be injured heavily. Castiel had a tickle of pride in him as he noticed this, because this meant that his men were truly well trained.
“Sir?” It was Kayla at the door.
“We will get to the bottom of this sooner or later, Castiel. I cannot stand this type of behavior at my own birthplace.”
“Let me know when you do.”
Dean promptly snorted out the drink through his nose and onto the papers. He looked up at her, horrified, and at the table. “Shit,” he said and started to wipe at them with his fingers. “Shit. I’m so sorry.”
“Jared will take care of your car. Have you brought clothes with you for the week?” he asked and his eyes seemed to pore into Dean's eyes. It took Dean a moment to find his voice.
“Of course I have! Why wouldn’t I think of that?”
Castiel shook his head and walked out of the bedroom to walk to the bathroom. He went in and was greeted by an average looking bathroom with a shower, and a sink and a toilet. He washed his hands in the sink and splashed some water on his face. When he looked himself in the mirror, he was reminded, once again, just how old he actually was. There were tired circles under his eyes, and they were way too many wrinkles on his face. He turned his head to the side and saw how much gray hair he had.
A nasty smile made its way over Azazel’s lips, and Castiel knew that it wasn’t good. “Gordon has her.”
“Look, if you don’t want to help me get out of there, I won’t… I won’t hold it against you.”
“Dean,” Castiel breathed out. Almost collapsing in his haste to get to the men on the pipes that looked like a cross. Castiel stood up before the man that he loved, the man that he did all of this for… Dean looked so different. He was bloodied, and he didn’t open his eyes even when Castiel touched his cheek. He didn’t even say anything. His breathing was hard and heavy. It didn’t sound like a healthy breath.
“What, baby girl?” he asked, if his voice sounded thicker with relief, then it was no one’s business than his.
“Come for me, baby boy,” Mr. Novak grunted into his ear and Dean shivered from the roughness. If it were possible, his voice had gone lower than it had been few minutes ago. “Come for me, baby. That’s it, come on…”
“H-How would you know?” Castiel asked. The water was beating down his back, making the aching muscles relax.
Dean clenched his jaw as he was once again reminded of the sadistic bastard that was Alastair. He liked torturing Dean to the point where he'd bring blood to the surface and wouldn't stop even when Dean begged him to... or even when he safe worded out. That landed him a way more severe punishment than Dean was able to handle.
The soft sunlight that cascaded through the windows and the curtains were breaking the harsh glare of it. Castiel looked at the windows for a moment, then he heard the bathroom door being open. Castiel turned his head to the bathroom and he licked his lips at the sight of Dean. He was still wet from the shower, his hair damp on his forehead, and water sliding down his body. He had a towel wrapped around his waist and Castiel licked his lips again.
Castiel nodded and said, “Yeah.”
The tremors in his left arm weren't helping the matter either. He'd see his own doctor about twice a week now. And every time his doctor would give him more medicine to take care of the tremors. They both knew what it meant, and he had to go through in order to stop it, but he couldn't afford that distraction. He had more important things to take care of.
“So, Dean, how have you been?” Jessica asked as they sat down comfortably on the couch. She leaned her back to the armchair, stacked up with pillows and her feet were crossed close to her body.
Dean really ought to get a raise from this, Castiel thought. He was very well… endowed when it came to his member. So, really, Dean was going to get a raise, because this felt incredible. “I could cum like this,” Castiel grunted as he eased himself out of Dean’s mouth; who let out a distressed sound, and looked up at Castiel.
There was a pause, where Castiel curled and uncurled his fists, trying to calm down. He knew the exact reason he was feeling frustrated, but he’d be damned to let her know that she was right in what she was saying.
“Boss?”
Mr. Novak didn’t disappoint.
“Listen, man. No disrespect,” Dean paused, his face frowned with anger and disgust, turned to look at Gordon, who was still staring at the kids as if they were ice creams. “Actually, yeah, disrespect; you’re fucking creepy, and I suggest you leave this park immediately and never come back. Before I’ll drag your ass out of here myself, I swear.” Dean’s heart was beating so hard in his chest he was sure it was gonna beat out of there at any given time.
Another person came in, and the next couple of hours were filled with meeting people for some problems. Some of them had more interesting problems, than the others. But to keep up his reputation, Castiel had to sit there and listen to them and give them advice.
“Nothing.”
“Mm… beautiful. You’ve a very beautiful daughter.”
“Uh, yeah?”
Castiel sat up in his bed and stared blankly at the wall.
A man came in with a personal problem; his wife was cheating on him with the gardener and he wanted that gardener gone. Castiel stared at him so long that he had to run out of the office. “We don't get rid of people just because they're sleeping with your wife. Call a lawyer and get a divorce.”
They continued talking until there was a squeak from the doorway, and Dean looked in the direction. Eileen was hugging someone that Dean didn’t recognize. Until they pulled apart and he could see the face. It was the man from the airport that spilled his coffee everywhere. Dean was completely distracted by the man. It wasn’t because he was an attractive man, but because he was the opposite of what he saw at the airport. He wasn’t clumsy or in disarray. He was so well put together that Dean didn’t realize it was the same man.
“Your favorite person in the whole world is responsible for this.”
What a ride this has been...
“Я не хотел этого делать. Я не знал, что он был твоим мужчиной. Если бы я знал, я бы этого не сделал. Я бы не стал продавать ему наркотики. Пожалуйста, сэр, (
Castiel’s eyes fluttered open and he blankly stared at the ceiling. This was something that he had forgotten. He was 9 when he witnessed that meeting. Barth was the head of the Italian mob family then. He was Alastair and Amara’s father.
“Dean?” he asked in a low voice. He didn’t move at first. Thirty seconds passed and Dean’s head emerged from under the blankets and when he turned around to look at Castiel… Castiel’s heart broke at the sight. “Oh, Dean…” his eyes were red-rimmed, there were tear tracks on his cheeks, and his lips were red, and bleeding, from biting on them so hard.
“I shouldn’t have touched her,” Castiel said, shaking his head. “Not in this way. Not when my hands aren’t clean.”
Castiel let out the breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding back. His hands were shaking. His heart was hammering in his chest so fast he was sure that Alastair heard it. These people were his family. These people were Lucifer’s family.
, Novak.”
His sister was the hardest one to talk to, out of all of them. She had cried and called him names, and even threatened to cut him off from her life. But Castiel talked to her for hours on the phone, telling her what happened and why he did what he did. He wasn’t going to risk it again. He wasn’t going to risk his life just because it was his brother. Anna had calmed down, considerably, and even laughed when he asked her about the wedding and how the preparations were going. She had brightened up, until they had to end the call because she had to go and attend a function for children’s hospital.
“I don’t know what happened at the Italians that night,” Bobby said. “And why things happened the way they did. But all I can say is that, Castiel would’ve done everything in his power to prevent that from happening. He sacrificed his life, and his family, and his men to come and rescue you. I don’t think if he were a liar or a bad person, he would’ve done something like this for just one man.”
The silence that followed was defeating.
Dean swallowed hard and looked away.
“Sir,” Dean whispered after a few seconds of silence.
He missed Dean.
“Enough.”
Dean sighed and dropped whatever he had been holding in his hands and moved to the bed. Castiel lifted his hand and waited for Dean to grab it. Dean toed off his shoes first, and then he grabbed Castiel’s hand. When he did, Castiel pulled him up the bed and close to him. Dean laid down on top of him, with his clothes still on. He was a soothing height on top of Castiel.
Grabbing the handle, he pushed it down and pushed the door open. He walked inside and stopped; the room was big. As big as the first floor was. All of the walls were covered in shelves which held way too many books. Books that looked like they were hundred years old. Some of them were even in a language that he was unfamiliar with. He briefly wondered if Mr. Novak could read them. He walked further in and thought that he walked into a replica of the library in
“Stealing from a private property, sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel huffed out a laugh and they made their way down the hallway and to the ballroom, where the charity was being held.
know what you’re hiding underneath all of your clothes?” Castiel looked at her then, really looked at her. She seemed to be mature enough to understand whatever that was happening on his body had come from all these years of being a mob boss in this country. She didn’t look like a woman who could be messed with. She meant business and she looked smart enough to work out who Dean was to him. Maybe it was in the glance that Castiel threw at Dean. Maybe it was in the way that Dean had clutched at his hand when they pulled him away and took him to the emergency room. Or maybe because everyone knew that he was gay.
He dropped her down and she ran to Castiel; he in turn, moved to her. The hallway wasn’t a long one, but it felt too short for her little legs to carry her to him in time. He knew what was happening even before he reached to her. It all happened so fast. Castiel looked at her terrified face, her dirty hair bouncing over her frame. In the background he saw Alastair lift up his gun, and he aimed it at them.
“Mr. Novak,” Kevin’s voice brought back Castiel to present and he turned around to see the young man walking to him. He was wearing black jeans and a black t-shirt. His hair used to be long, but now it was cut and beautifully styled on his head.
They went back to the kitchen where Castiel sat by the table and Dean dropped a kiss on top of her daughter’s head, before he went on to make them pancakes. He grabbed the bowl with the ruined pancake and frowned down at it. “Do I wanna know?” he asked, looking up at Castiel, tilting the bowl at his direction.
“I’m sorry, what?” Castiel asked, snapping back to reality.
“Don’t leave,” Castiel mumbled, his hand moving closer to Dean’s body. He seemed hesitant. So Dean met him halfway. He placed his hand over Castiel’s, just to hold his.
Gentle fingers lifted his head up by his chin. Clear green eyes looked down at him, an understanding nature in them. Dean licked his lips, and after a moment of gazing at each other, he said, “Being vulnerable, and showing it to the right people… it… it isn’t always a bad thing, sir. It does take time, and had I known all you needed was time, I’d take this… ah, separation, a bit less emotionally scarring then I already have. You didn’t talk to me about it and I didn’t know what to do anymore…” Dean shook his head; he moved his hand to the back of Castiel’s neck and continued. “So I need us to communicate more. If something is triggering for you, which is what happened to you when I tried to… I need you to tell me to stop, instead of pushing me back that way, yeah? Because it’s harming me as well.”
The doors opened and the smell of sex and alcohol was almost suffocating to Castiel. But he walked in with confident strides. “What the-“ The exclamation came from the blonde chick, who was only wearing her panties, her hands on the shoulders of the man sitting at the chair. A black haired girl could be seen under the desk.
“Hold your breath for me. Come on. Do it.”
“Okay, if you say so,” Mr. Novak said, backing away from Dean. “I'll see you later.”
His attention was drawn back to his daughter, when they stopped by his car. Shaking his head, he opened the car’s doors for Jessica and Natalie, got them in safely, turned around the car and got inside himself. He started the engine and peeled off the parking lot towards the diner, his mind not at ease, but definitely less loud than before. He was tempted to call Mr. Novak and ask about the men and women in the park, but he didn’t. Today, and the next 2 days also, was about his daughter. If he could keep himself from calling Mr. Novak until later on during the night hours, that would be great for him.
Samandriel's lips twitched into a half smile, which vanished quickly. “I'm sorry,” he blurted out. “I didn't mean to get shot at. And I did finish up my round, and I really was on my way to the car, but then I don't know from where I had been shot. And then the next thing I know I’m being rushed to the hospital. We see these stuff in movies and they really do downplay just how much this shit hurts. Being shot, I mean. Like, really? And here I thought it wouldn’t be this bad. But Mr. Novak, sir, that doesn’t matter because I swear I did finish my round and I’m really so-“
Soon the music started and the majority of the party started to dance to it. Dean’s face split up into a wide grin when he noticed that Anna was dancing away to the music as well, with her bridesmaids. Emilio was still sitting at their table, but he was staring at her with a fond gaze. It made something warm, in Dean’s chest, clench at the sight of these two. Their love looked pure.
Castiel sighed and got up from the bed. He checked the time on his bedside table before he made his way to the bathroom. It was 6 am already, and knowing Castiel, he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep. So he went to the bathroom to pee and then shower. He had to get ready for the day.
“We know who’s behind the attack,” Castiel said and Gabriel paled. “We also know our suspicions as to
Dean melted down on the mattress, puffs of air leaving his lips. Castiel slowly pulled out, and Dean shuddered with a wince. Castiel worried and asked, “Did I hurt you? I’m sorry.”
“Then what is it? What's so great about this?” Sam asked. He did sound like he didn't want to yell at Dean for this, and wanted to understand this as much as he could. So Dean thought that it was better to be true about this whole thing.
The Winchester boys never showed any emotion to one another, but at the end of the day, they were still brothers who cared for one another. And they showed it as much as they could, without exclusively using the words. Dean was grateful for his brother’s compassionate nature towards everything. He squeezed his little brother to him even tighter, before releasing him.
“Can we check it?” Dean asked as he started to eat his cake.
Castiel placed his hands inside his coat’s pockets and walked around the park for a bit. His eyes were looking out for the familiar body, when he spotted him. He was sitting about 10 benches away from where Castiel was standing at, and he was finishing up his pretzel, though he still had his coffee, it seemed.
Crowley never looked so pale to him. He never looked so inhumane as he did at this moment. His face was unrecognizable. It was covered in blood. His eyes, it seemed, had been stabbed, or punched in, Castiel wasn’t sure. What he was sure about was the fact that he didn’t have eyes anymore. And he was most certainly dead.
“Hi,” Dean breathed out. They squeezed each other close for a moment and then they released their hold. They pulled back, but not too far from each other. “So, tell me what’s been going on with you, and why do you look like you need more than a day’s worth of sleep.”
“Yes, please, sir. I’d like to,” Dean replied in a rush. Castiel sat more comfortably on the chair and helped Dean to place them over his shoulders.
Castiel paused for a second, making a thoughtful sound. After a moment, he nodded and said, “Clean up the mess. I have to leave.”
He felt aroused just as sharply as he felt the stab in his heart earlier in the evening. “I want you,” he growled and with the sudden strength that came out of nowhere, he pulled Dean up to his bed.
“We are leaving in an hour,” Balthazar said as he poured himself a mug of coffee.
“Oh I will, don’t worry about it. You’ll get your precious little girl,” Alastair said and he sounded annoyed. “There is a scene that I really loved. I’m going to recreate it here, right now… Little girl, you’re going to run to your fake daddy. Don’t let the bad guy catch you though.”
He needed to be sure that the places she pointed before were deserted before he'd go with that final plan.
“Hmm… Are you okay? Do you need me to…?”
Dean was staring at his hands with a blank expression. Castiel was frozen in time, it seemed. This was so out of his comfort zone that he was unsure as to what he was supposed to do. He dropped his hands back onto his lap, and Dean’s eyes looked up into his. There was something in Dean’s eyes that Castiel didn’t know how to interpret. He opened his mouth to apologize-
“Dean,” Castiel said. Everyone shifted as he said his name. Castiel swallowed and continued, trying not to look at them. “I got him this phone for emergencies, years ago when he was still…” Castiel frowned, looking down at the map. “I told him to send me a blank message when there was something dangerous that was going to happen, and he needed to warn me about it.” Castiel shrugged, and finally, he looked up at his family. They were staring at him with blank expressions; the only person that was showing a sign of emotion was Lora, but Castiel chose to ignore that for now. “So that’s what he did. He sent me a blank message from that phone yesterday. Which I saw after the attack.”
“Sir?” the bartender looked confused. He looked young, probably in his twenties. He was handsome and Castiel could see why people would find him attractive; the looks that he was receiving from the patrons didn’t go unnoticed by Castiel. He didn’t want any of these people to suffer, if it got out of hand.
“Castiel,” Dean said and Castiel had to close his eyes because of the emotions he was feeling when Dean said his name like that. Dean rested his forehead against Castiel’s. He took Castiel’s hands in his from his waist, and brought them up to his chest. Castiel could feel the steady rhythm of Dean’s heart thumping underneath his open palm. “Look at me. Please.”
Dean didn’t say anything else, as he accepted the bottle and started to drink from it. He went to the half of the bottle, before he placed it down to the floor again. He sighed and sat back and waited for more instructions from Mr. Novak. He pulled Dean’s jeans all the way off, and placed them on the armchair where he sat before. He pulled at Dean’s shirt. Dean started to unbutton it, but then Mr. Novak knelt before him, pushed his legs apart settling between them, and batted Dean’s hands away. He leaned forward as he started to unbutton, and placed soft kisses on the exposed skin.
Drink in hand, Dean pushed back from the bar. He gave one more look at the table, finding no sign of Mr. Novak again, and headed to the house to use the bathroom.
Dean knew he was closing in on hysteria, but he couldn’t help it. This man, the gorgeous, sex on legs man, the Russian mob boss, wanted
Dean froze, and a shudder ran through his spine. “Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.”
“I can fix any car I can get my hands on. Although my favorites are the old ones.”
Dean stared at himself in the mirror, walked away from it, came back to it, and stared some more. He was wearing a suit that was a brand. A real brand. For the first time in his life, he was wearing an Armani suit. And it was made just for him. Mr. Novak took him to the tailor that he visited whenever he needed a new suit in Spain. They knew exactly what he wanted, - bulletproof, light, and classic design to it, -and Dean went along with it. He ran his fingers at the tip of his suit jacket, feeling the rich material underneath his fingertips.
They walked back to Dean’s bedroom soon after. Castiel took off his jeans and boots, and got in bed with only his T-shirt and boxer briefs. Once he settled in, Dean moved to him and Castiel wrapped his arm around his bare back.
Anna had ginger hair, wide green eyes and a smile that blinded Dean for half a second. She was wearing a black summer dress with heels that looked almost impossible to walk on. She had a soft tinkling laugh and her eyes sparkled whenever she’d speak about how excited she was about her wedding.
When they got into a part of town where the night clubs where at, Mr. Novak suggested they turn into another way. Dean nodded and they turned sharp right as another street opened up for them. When they were walking down here, the streets were slightly older than what they saw before. And it was a bit darker than the main streets. They’d been silent for the most part of the night, but neither of them felt the need to fill in the silence.
Dean looked down at it, then shook his head. “It don’t matter. I want you to be okay now, alright? I also want to be here.”
“-cious, but he does need his rest, Mr. Milton.”
“Since Mr. Novak gets to have lots of guests over from time to time, he loves to have everything at an arm's reach. So in the mansion you can find a small club-”
“Tell who what?” Dean asked looking surprised.
“You speak of cars as if they have feelings,” Mr. Novak noted. His eyes were serious, but they held a small amount of amusement to them.
When Dean felt like he wasn’t going to collapse he closed his eyes and rested his head against Mr. Novak’s. “Are you okay?” Mr. Novak asked him, and Dean nodded.
“Is that a hot coco?” Castiel asked, grabbing the mug and inspecting it himself.
“Oh.”
Castiel took short cuts to the hospital and Dean was making phone calls on their way there. He spoke to someone named Ellen, and someone named Ash, and then there was a light hearted argument between him and a girl called Jo. They were about five minutes away from the hospital when Castiel realized that he was probably going to meet the whole clan of the Winchesters. Or everyone that had any sort of connection
with Dean. Which was something that Dean had done before, but from what he understood Mr. Novak never done it before. When he said he had done the act, he meant the sex part of it, where his dick was inside another person’s body. Not the
“I don’t like! I want to go to Castiel!” Natalie screamed at Alastair, and she started to cry. “Castiel is nice!”
He didn’t care that his body was being sliced open whenever they felt like they were bored. He didn’t care that he was going to get more scars than he had before. He just wanted to know where Natalie was and if she was alive and well. He just needed to know that his daughter wasn’t suffering because of her father. He just needed to know that his lifestyle wasn’t going to cost him his daughter’s life…
“Because I’m trying to enjoy a day, one day with my family without worrying about other stuff. I know, I should never stop worrying because I’m a father of a four year old, but just…” Dean drowned his beer in one go.
“Always am.”
“W-“ Dean cleared his throat and tried again. “What should I do next?”
He didn’t know why he was crying anymore. He didn’t know why he got drunk in the first place. He just loved feeling the relief that he was feeling at this moment. Just this moment where he was getting rid of the bad feelings and emotions in himself, he felt relief like nothing else. He was talking. He was saying something, but he didn’t know what it was. He was just so tired.
Castiel looked up Balthazar blankly, “What?”
It didn’t take Dean long to shower and wash away the come from his chest and mouth. When he got back to the bedroom, still gloriously naked, the bed had new sheets on them and the food he made for them was by the edge of the bed, warmed up and ready to be eaten. There was two glasses of orange juice by the plates and his cheese sticks looked amazing, and Dean touched them again, warm.
So they got Natalie. He got Natalie. The small bundle of joy in his arms that he spent sleepless nights to hold, while Lisa slept through the night because she was exhausted.
Mr. Novak didn't say anything but his lips twitched. Dean's heart swelled at the silent amusement.
“He has no sense of respect for the dead, does he?”
“Mhmm,” she replied with a nod. “He doesn’t have any of them. His best friend is me and my uncle Sammy. And aunt Jess. He’s not living with my mommy anymore because they don’t like each other anymore.”
“We got Charlie at the warehouse,” Balthazar said. “Ready to head out in 10.”
“What happened is that my kid died because I couldn’t keep my personal life separate from my job.”
Balthazar, who was placing a tie over a suit that was on his bed, didn’t even look startled to be caught. “I’m getting your outfit ready for tonight.”
Here's a warning for this and the next chapter: EXPLICIT VIOLENT CONTENT!
Castiel shook his head, trying to clean up his bloodied gun. “I need a new gun.”
“Come here,” Castiel said. He was an idiot. He hadn’t realized his behavior was going to affect his boy too. He clearly wasn’t thinking as he shut himself away from everyone else around him.
“They got Sam Winchester.”
“I have no idea how they managed to get in, unless they killed Vladimir and his idiots. And I bet my white ass that these were
Anna smiled widely and nodded, “I'm guessing you'd love to have a piece of a cake?”
“Don’t you think this is too much?” Castiel asked as he walked to the car waiting for him with the door open.
He could feel his body gravitating towards Mr. Novak's, but he didn't do anything to stop the move. He wanted nothing more than to get fucked right here and now, so his head would stop spinning with negative thoughts, but he knew he had to sit tight and wait for them to get back to the mansion.
“I love it,” Castiel turned to look at Dean, who smiled at him with a self-satisfaction that meant getting Castiel’s approval of his living situation was the highest compliment in his life.
And well, how could Dean answer to this, but to sob even harder into his phone?
Dean snorted out a laugh and closed the sliding door after them. They threw up their hands in defeat and Dean picked up his phone from his jeans pockets. He still hadn’t change from today’s clothes. He probably smelled really bad right now.
Castiel tightened his hold on Azazel, forcing his head over the shattered glass. Azazel winced in pain. “Where exactly?”
“There’s nothing to talk about Bobby.”
“I’m sorry to bother you at this hour.”
But now… now he was trusting this young man, who was his
Dean’s face was tucked in close to his neck and every time he exhaled, Castiel’s neck tickled pleasantly. Castiel turned his head to the side and kissed Dean’s cheek. He felt Dean’s cheeks move up in a small smile and it made his heartbeat slowly go down into a reasonable rhythm. Dean didn’t say anything. There really wasn’t much to say. Castiel needed the silent support, and Dean was giving it to him without question.
Mr. Novak looked sheepish. He sighed, as if he didn’t want to get caught. His hand lingered on Dean’s hips as he pulled away and sat back down on his chair. Dean noticed that he was wearing sweat pants to go with his T-shirt, and he was also barefoot. Dean suddenly felt overdressed. He didn’t linger on that thought though, because soon enough Mr. Novak tugged him down onto his lap. Dean went willingly, though he didn’t put much pressure on Mr. Novak’s leg.
“I need at least a few days off. At the start of the month.”
“Who does he work for?” Castiel asked as he snapped his fingers and one of the many men that accompanied him here, presented him with a gun.
He cleared his throat, his eyes unwavering as he stared right back into Mr. Novak’s blue ones. “You look very handsome, sir.”
“What’s next?”
He went down the stairs and when he was about to go to the office to talk to his men, he heard a sniffle. He turned around and saw Lora standing close to the wall, her shoulders shaking with silent tears. Castiel frowned and walked to her. When she noticed him she straightened up and wiped at her eyes with the back of her hands.
Dean took a sip from his tea and thought about it. Eventually, he shook his head and said, “No. I wouldn’t want to live in a house when it was never really mine, you know?”
“It’s okay,” Castiel said softly, frowning at her as she shook her head again.
“Hm,” Castiel looked up at the building and then back at Dean. He didn’t know what Castiel was looking for in his face, but whatever he found, made him smile. “Sure. Let’s go.”
“Before you start going all starry eyed on me, you still haven’t told me what it is that you do.”
Natalie was staring at Alastair with a blank expression. Even though Castiel knew that she was only 5 years old, and wouldn’t really remember any of this, he still didn’t want to have this conversation in front of her.
“Castiel, forgive me, but I forgot to tell you something else,” Alastair said. His gravelly voice was making Castiel’s skin prickle with unease. “In Spain, when it was your lovely sister’s wedding… I, well not personally me, but someone from my side of the world, made a little visit with
“So, ah, it seems that we have a mutual friend? Or, friends?” the man said, grabbing the wine from the cooler.
“Why?” Castiel asked. He looked at Balthazar, feeling confused.
“Okay. Deal.”
“It’s Mr. Novak. Asking if I’m ready to leave,” Dean mumbled. “Do you need anything else?”
“I used to watch a lot of Food network with my mom, back in the day,” he said. “It was something that we used to do together. It just stuck on me, you know?”
Castiel draped himself over Dean’s body and gave him a hard kiss. He then continued down his body; he stopped to lick and suck on Dean’s nipples, earning him a loud cry, before he moved down. He paused when he reached Dean’s dick. Pulling back, he grabbed his chair and pushed it closer to the desk. He sat on and pulled himself closer to the desk. Once he was in a right position, he took Dean into his mouth, without hesitation. Dean let out a surprised cry and Castiel looked up to check Dean’s reaction. And it was an amazing sight to see. Dean’s eyes were blazing, his pupils were dilated with arousal, and his cheeks were red from it. His lips were parted as he panted out, and his blush was steadily spreading down his chest.
. Dean and Lisa exchanged a glance over her shoulder and they both sighed in relief. Crisis was averted, for now.
“You look extremely delicious, Dean,” Mr. Novak said at the same time. Dean thought that if they weren’t getting ready to leave for the wedding, they would be at each other in a matter of seconds. But since they had to leave, Dean just simply smiled at him, and made himself move forward, Mr. Novak met him halfway.
He had been focusing on the people more for the last couple of years. And that was probably because he didn’t have anything else to do with his free time. But… he wasn’t ever not present when he had Dean in his life, right? He still did good things back then as well… right?
Dean bit down on his lower lip and quirked up an eyebrow. “I'd love to, sir.”
“Sir, let me help you.”
“Nope,” both Castiel and she answered. Dean stared at them both, and then shook his head, and went back to work. Castiel stared at his back, and then looked at her. “You know, you never said what your name is.”
Castiel took his time with his answer. He didn't want to tell Dean about his sickness. A part of his mind didn't want for Dean to know and another part of him knew that Dean would start worrying about him. Obsessively worry about him. Castiel turned away from the door and looked at Dean, who was leaning against the wall, five feet away from him. He was wearing sweats and a green t-shirt. He looked soft in the afternoon light. It was raining nonstop from the night before. "I see my doctors more these days than I used to."
Dean rolled his eyes, and said, “Don’t be so silly. It was only for three days.”
“Please,” came the muffled
He closed his eyes and lifted his head up, letting the water hit his face. Unbidden, the image of Crowley, lying down on the ground, looking so…
Dean blushed a bit while Sam laughed. “Shut up,” Dean said. “This is Castiel. Castiel, Jessica, my pain in the ass sister-in-law.”
Enjoy~
Dean was gone.
He placed his phone on his stomach and waited for the reply, which would come soon. Mr. Novak didn’t like replying to his messages late. And just as the thought passed through his head, his phone lit up with a new message.
Castiel stopped when he was out of bullets. Alastair had been on the ground for a while now, maybe after his fifth shot. Castiel stopped counting long ago. He dropped his gun down and hugged the little body closer to his body. He turned his head to her hair, and exhaled. His face contorted in pain, as he tried not to let him cry. But he couldn’t help but give in to the pain. To give in to the feeling of this grief. He couldn’t do anything, but to hold on to her.
It made Castiel feel better about himself, and about what he had to do.
Soon they were pulling up by the mansion and Castiel got out of the car, without waiting for anyone. He went up the stairs quickly, and went to his bedroom. He snapped the door shut after him and started to undress with quick jerky movements. He just needed to get out of these clothes and wear something else before he left. He hadn’t even called Dean to ask if it was okay to come over. He didn’t even know where he lived…
Castiel stared at his sister, as she packed up her pancakes on top of one another. She layered each one of them with ice cream, and fruits. At the end of the small ministration, the stack was so high, Castiel was sure she wasn’t going to be able to finish it all. But then, knowing her, Castiel was sure that she’d manage it. “I love the taste of it,” Anna moaned around a mouthful of food.
Dean sighed and looked up at the ceiling of the car. Mr. Novak and his meetings and his rules and his stupidly blue eyes that were staring right into the car and right at Dean. “Jesus Christ, warn a man next time,” Dean sort of squeaked out as he looked back at Mr. Novak, who had an eyebrow raised and an amused smile on his face.
to Spain in the first place.
“It’s not a mess, Mr. Novak,” Dean told him, moving his hand up to kneed at the back of Castiel’s neck. “How many times do I have to tell you that we’re in this together? As long as you’ll have me around, I’m with you here.”
Dean was an extremely great distraction for him. But he couldn’t afford that distraction today. He had a job to take care of. He sighed and leaned his forehead against the window. He closed his eyes, and took a deep steadying breath, letting the quietness of the room lull him into a deep mindset…
“It's pleasing to see a man so passionate about cars.”
But Castiel didn’t care about it. His mind started to fill up with thoughts. “How do you know?” he asked.
“Yes, sir,” Samandriel said with a nod.
Dean did as he was told and tried not to drag his feet, but it was nearly impossible. The thought of meeting more puppies and then the Alpha of the pack was unsettling. He swallowed hard and walked behind Mr. Novak. “Hello, Silver,” Mr. Novak said and Dean peeked to see how he was going to approach Silver. He held out his hand and the puppy sniffed at it, once and then yipped recognizing who it was. Mr. Novak let go of Dean’s hand and Dean made an aborted move to hold his hand again, but curled his hand into a fist so as to not reach out. He let Mr. Novak have his moment with his puppy. He petted Silver couple of time before he hugged him up in his arms and turned to look at Dean again.
)” she sobbed, tears streaming down her face. “I don’t want to die. I don’t want to fucking die! Не оставляй меня
Castiel didn’t stay in the room for long, after Dean’s departure. Just long enough to get his breathing back to normal. He took steadying breaths and closed his eyes, counted to ten to calm down his racing heart. Once he was satisfied with his state, he walked to the door.
“Yeah. He is. He is Batman, did you know?” she said enthusiastically, and went on a story about how he was Batman last year for Halloween. She had a way with words that Castiel couldn’t help but laugh at her. She was adorable and Castiel wanted to spend as much time as he could with her.
Shrugging he answered the phone.
“He came in to check and see how I was doing. Told me that he had paid for my hospital bill.”
Is that the best you can do? Tell me how to come in here, and then tell me to not talk to you this way, just because, what?
“I know. I got you, Dean,” he said and then Mr. Novak was there. His hands moved over his ass and it was too sensitive for the touch but then his hands moved down to the back of his thighs and Dean's only warning was the tightening of his hands on them, before he was being lifted up. Dean grabbed on to the railings and wrapped his legs around Mr. Novak's waist.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean dropped to his knees without a second thought. It hadn’t taken long for her to break him. Even when he had tried to resist her, she gave him a cruel little smile that didn’t warm her eyes at all. She had continued talking to him as if he didn’t even utter a single word.
Charlie shrugged and sighed, “Alright. I’ll stop playing a matchmaker.”
Essentially, Dean wanted to spend an hour or so here, and go back home to do what he originally planned on doing. But he soon found out that he was having a good time. He learned some more about Castiel; he loved traveling. He had been in Bulgaria twice, and Italy 4 times. He preferred classical music, over jazz, even though the bar they were at was playing jazz. He was much older than Eileen. When Dean found out that Castiel was in his 50’s, Dean made a mental note of their age-differences. He was going to be 37 in March. As much as Dean pushed him to know how old he was, Castiel adamantly stayed with, “I’m in my 50’s, Dean. That’s all you need to know.”
“Castiel,” Azazel mocked him. “I won’t ever give away where he is.”
“Oh,” Dean said and he was surprised to hear the disappointment in his voice. “Oh, it’s alright. We can try it some other time. I don’t mind. Really.”
Somebody said in a panicked voice. And it took Castiel a moment to realize that it was his voice. He didn’t realize it was his voice until now.
“Dean, I need you to calm down,” Castiel said, looking sternly at Dean. He was fine with Dean talking to him however way he wanted when there was only the two of them in a room. But now, they were not alone.
“Child trafficking is not something that I like. Let’s burn those fuckers down and destroy everything in this city that they represent,” Castiel said, looking down the hallway. There were some patients walking around, and some nurses walking with them. “I want this city clean.”
Finally, one of them nodded once at Mr. Novak and Dean felt his body relax minutely beside him. Mr. Novak nodded back and everything seemed to go back to normal. Their drinks were placed on the bar and they grabbed them. Mr. Novak turned his head and held Dean’s gaze, and he lifted up his glass of rum to drown it in one go. Dean did the same. He licked his lips and nodded, “Not bad.”
“Yes, what? What is it?” Castiel asked, wanting nothing more than to take Dean; right here and now.
His phone vibrated again with another message. Castiel stared at the picture a bit longer then he went to check the message. It was from Lucifer. He swallowed, licked his lips and clicked on the message icon to read it.
Dean parked in front of Sam's firm, cut off the engine and waited for Sam to talk. When Dean realized that Sam wasn't going to say anything, he tried. “Sam-”
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Oh I know, alright. Tell her to take it easy.”
Dean walked out of there and found Lora still standing by the door, waiting patiently for him. “I love this bedroom.”
“It does,” Sam opened his mouth to ask what Dean already knew, but Dean cut him off. “And no, you can’t know what or whose books I’m working on right now.”
“Wow, this is… this is actually pretty amazing,” Emilio said and Dean swallowed in relief. “I have some vintage cars in the garage that need some working on. Do you think you can take a look at them while you’re here?”
“It is a big deal.”
’,” Castiel pointed. As he started to take off his shirt.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Castiel asked, turning back to the table to stare down at Alastair.
“You went through my box.”
Emilio shook his head and said, “They found his body at an alleyway close to where you were. My men can’t identify him because his face had been brutalized.”
The decorations of the kitchen and living room were similar; it was in a tasty brown and beige coloring, wooden floors and wooden, comfortable furniture. Upstairs, the house held three bedrooms; one master bedroom, one guest room, and another smaller room that they redecorated for their future baby.
Well, Mr. Novak was right. Dean didn’t feel like he was in a plane at all. It was wide, extremely well furnished, there was even a bar at one of the far side of the plane. There was a sitting area and as Dean walked in more, released Mr. Novak’s hand from his clutches, he realized that one of the sofas could be turned into a bed. Dean licked his lips and turned around to inspect the area more. The colors were in soft tones of different shades of grey. Some accessories, and the pillows, were in red.
“You’re gonna boss me around now?” Castiel asked, though there was no heat behind his words.
It was taken from afar; There was Jess in a park, her hair up in a ponytail. She seemed to be helping two kids to make a snowman. It looked like the local park from where they lived, but he wasn’t sure.
“I didn't know you had company,” the man said with a British accent.
“If y-If you want me to, sir,” Dean stuttered out. Mr. Novak gave him a smile that reached his eyes. Dean quickly memorized how his face looked at this very moment. He didn’t think he was going to see this side of Mr. Novak much.
“I would offer you something to eat,” Azazel said, chewing on another piece of pizza.
At once, Castiel walked to the couch and looked for the phone. He found it on the ground and walked to take it from the ground. He held it in the palm of his hand and extended his arm toward Dean. “Unlock it, please.”
Castiel’s hands were shaking. He couldn’t seem to stop shaking. The car’s windows were tinted, but he was sure that Dean knew he was there. Castiel stared at his fingers, twisting them together to calm down a bit, then he looked up and was caught by the beauty that was Dean with his daughter. He was laughing and chasing his daughter who was wearing a pink flowery dress. Her hair was up into a bun and her smile was contagious enough for Castiel to smile at the scene. Dean was wearing an old T-shirt and jeans, with boots. His cheeks were flushed as he caught his daughter and tickled her. She shrieked with laughter and said something that Castiel couldn’t hear.
Castiel could hear Dean before he burst into the bedroom. Dean looked alert, but Castiel could see that he had been sleeping. He was wearing a deep grey t-shirt and boxers. His feet were bare, and his legs were muscular. He looked incredibly hot. Castiel was lucky to have him in his life. He didn’t want to bother Dean with this; he could’ve easily taken a shower, taken some medicines to calm down his nerves, sleep it off, and see Dean in the morning as if nothing happened. But he had promised Dean that he would try to let Dean in more, that they would communicate more, and that he would allow Dean to take care of him.
“And what’s that?” she asked, prompting him gently to say the words. It was like she knew he was trying to avoid saying the words out loud.
“And why would I do that?” Lucifer asked, perching his head over his hand on the table and staring right at Castiel.
Castiel wondered if he would ever get to see Dean's face like this in here. He did look relaxed enough around here, but it also looked like an act. An act to please Castiel. He sighed and swiped to the next picture. This one had Dean leaning up against a car, and drinking from a bottle of water. He looked a bit greased up by now, his face was covered in sweat, his shirt damp enough to be glued to his chest. And Castiel wanted nothing more than to tie Dean up and have his way with him right now.
Dean sat on his bed, the next afternoon, reading through the papers that Sam came up with in the morning. He sent the copy to Dean via email, and Dean printed it out. The list wasn't long, but it wasn't short either. It held their limits along with Dean's consent on anything that could happen. And if there was a certain kink that they'd like to explore and both agree on, which wouldn’t be on the list in the first place, was okay with Dean. On the second paper was the agreement whereas, if there was anything that would happen with Dean, while he was with Castiel, which would land him to the hospital, Castiel Novak had to take full responsibility for that.
He didn’t know what Mr. Novak was upset about. He certainly didn’t know if it was connected with him, or not. What if it was? What if he had done something to upset Mr. Novak? But what could it be? Was it because they didn’t have kinky sex since they got here? Was it because Dean fell asleep earlier than usual? Or was it because he had a small meeting with Anna? The questions were unlimited, and they kept on piling up and up in his head. He didn’t know which one to ask, nor did he know
But he still felt like punishing Dean for it. And by the looks of it, Dean was enjoying himself. Despite having a cock ring on, he was steadily leaking on the floor. The sight made Castiel even harder. With his free hand he adjusted his dick and Dean’s eyes landed on his hand movement. Dean made an aborted move to get closer to him, but Castiel grabbed Dean’s hair and pulled at it, hard enough that Dean’s whole back arched up. He let out the prettiest moan that Castiel has ever heard. Dean’s lips gasped open and his eyes bore into Castiel’s.
And sitting beside her was Dean. Castiel’s heart seized and his throat tightened. He had a hard time with trying to draw in a breath at that moment, because this could be impossible, right? The universe couldn’t be this bad toward him. Right?
“Is this Dean Winchester?” an unfamiliar voice said to him with an accent, and Dean sat up a bit straighter.
Anna had looked at him with softness in her eyes, and Dean felt like she knew he was hiding something from her, but she didn’t press. Instead, she continued with making the sauce for the dip. Few minutes later, Dean placed the garlic bread into the oven and started on the pie. Lora came back in again and grabbed herself a cup of water. Once she was done drinking it, she asked, “Are you gonna share some of that with us too?”
“Using.”
There was no decision to be made. Dean had to stay for this job. Even if it meant that he would, probably, never get out of it alive.
“Hey,” Dean said as the blue-eyed stranger,- not so stranger?- came to the kitchen for a snack.
“Yeah. Didn't realize how long I was kneeling until now. But I'm good to go.”
“Nice,” he said. “Cheers.”
With his free hand he slapped Dean’s cheek and watched as Dean’s eyes fluttered at that. “You like this, don’t you, my baby boy?”
But his face… his eyes… those told him something different. Told a different story.
“Is the city on fire?” murmured Castiel.
“Change of product?”
They kissed again, with tongue this time. Dean moaned low in his neck, wanting to kiss this man as long as he could. He was starting to get hard in his pants and he wanted to rut his hips against Mr. Novak’s but he couldn’t. He wasn’t allowed to.
“When?” Castiel tensed. They were outside by now as they waited for the cars. It looked like he wasn't going to take his own car. It would be too dangerous at the moment, it seemed.
She looked up when Castiel walked further into the living room, and she was going to go back to reading, when she noticed the person standing next to him. She froze, her eyes wide, as she assessed the situation. Dean was standing close to him, their hands holding, and in Castiel’s other hand, was a small carry on, which held some of Dean’s clothes.
Dean shook his head, flapping his hand about, “Nah. Don’t apologize. I’m just glad it was you and not somebody else.”
Mr. Novaks grabbed onto his hips and started to move his hips into Dean. They were short and shallow thrusts. Dean wanted, needed more. So he tightened his muscles around Mr. Novak; who in turn hissed and tightened his hold on Dean’s hips.
“So. What brings you out of the woods?” Gabriel asked, taking another sip. His eyes sharply swiping over the crowd.
“You know, this is the first time you’ve touched me since that night?” Dean said, his voice calm, and low. The tone that he used seconds before, all but vanished with the act. Castiel looked up at Dean and then he had to look down again; Dean’s face wasn’t blank anymore. He was hurt by Castiel. It tore at Castiel’s heart. “Do you know how hard it is to go from a week to having you around me all the time, touching me, playing with me, making me feel…things, pleasurable things? And then a week after that, you pull back and there’s nothing to feel? At all?  Do you understand what it means to me?” he didn’t wait for Castiel to come up with an answer. “It feels worse than a rejection. Worse than the feeling I felt when you told me to leave you in your bedroom, covered in food and looking so pale that your white shirt looked gray in comparison. Do you know how hard it was for me to walk away from that scene?”
Castiel stood up, pushing the chair back with his legs, making it scratch on the ground with a loud screech. He had to go. He looked at the message again and then checked the time. Almost two hours had passed since he had left Dean alone like that. How did he go on for so long without even making a sound, was beyond Castiel. And it was making him feel uneasy. Dean not only endangered his health, he also denied a direct order from Castiel.
Mr. Novak’s hand brushed up against his again.
The mansion was huge. Two story tall, modern style that had floor to ceiling windows. Dean couldn't wait to see what the inside looked like. He stopped his car in front of the front door and got out. There was already a valet waiting for him. Did people actually have valets? It seemed like Mr. Novak had them.
Dean looked down at her feet as he kept massaging them. He was sure that Sam had already told her about his life, but she would pretend that she didn’t know anything about it. Just to be sure that Dean could trust her anyway.
“We’re gonna go to eat ice cream. And if I’m good I get to play with Ray. So let’s go now so I can play with Ray, yeah?”
“We’re going to go in together,” Dean said and Castiel sighed in relief as he grabbed Dean’s hand and led the way into the hospital.
“You haven’t told me where we are going, so I’m allowed to be ‘
This person had been stealing from Castiel for months now. And it took them a while to find out exactly where the person was hacking from, breaching into Castiel’s vault and nicking out money that soon made a reasonably wide dent in the same vault that Castiel couldn’t ignore any more. Now that they were here, Castiel needed some answers.
Castiel cared, with everything he had, but he didn’t catch feelings. Because it would be unwise of him to drag in someone else, and make him look weak in front of the enemy. Even though Dean had barged into his life, and made an almost permanent existence somewhere within his chest, he could still push Dean away. But just the thought of that made him feel uneasy. Just then his phone rang with multiple messages.
So he did just that, he dipped down, and licked at his spine. His face got close to Dean’s hands. Dean unraveled his hands and tried to grab Castiel’s face, but he pulled back quickly and hit Dean again. “Behave,” Castiel said in a growl.
When he bid goodbye to Emilio, he didn’t go back to the living room, he just went up the stairs and into his bedroom. He shut the door after him, but didn’t lock it. He got in and started to change out of his clothes and into more comfortable ones. He was just about to pull his T-shirt over his head when he heard a knock on the door. Panic seized up his chest so fast and hard that he got stuck in his T-shirt. He knew that Dean wasn’t going to come in just like that, until Castiel would tell him so, but he couldn’t help the panicked feeling at the mere thought of Dean seeing him like this.
“You’ll be fine, sir,” he said. “Now, it’s time to see how my Jess is doing.”
Dean knew that he had an idiotic smile on his face as he turned around and looked at Mr. Novak only to find him already staring at his face. He had a soft look to him that Dean had seen in the private of their bedroom when he was almost asleep, and he’d see Mr. Novak giving him this look. Dean’s smile only grew as he said, “I wanna go there and dance with them. Can we?”
, you went ahead from the plan!”
“I sent out a word through an... Acquaintance. He'll get back to me by the end of the day.”
“What am I here for exactly?” Dean asked instead.
“I have something to tell you…”
“Are you ready to get spanked?”
"Wouldn't lie if I wanted to."
“Daddy doesn’t have any friends,” she said with a shrug.
“I’m… I don’t want to hide from you. Not anymore.” And just like that, the coco in his mouth turned into ash, and his body seized up. This was out of nowhere. This was so out of nowhere that he didn’t know what to make of it. “But, I can’t exactly leave her.”
“No, no, it’s not okay, Mr. Novak,” she said. “This was never okay to begin with. You were happier.” She said and she took couple of steps to him. “You were so happy when he was in your life. I have never seen you like that before.”
“Yesterday, you asked me to get you out of the life you were living. Today, you’re up and about and acting like we have all personally offended you.” Dean twitched a bit but didn’t reply. He knew what was happening to him, but he wasn’t going to crack. “What happened?”
“At the hospital, sir.”
He heard the wet pop Castiel’s mouth made when he released Dean
I'm so sorry it took me so long to write the last chapter. My life has been a mess... I don't want to go into much details, but the American dream for me, for now, is just a dream. I'm hoping that my life will take a turn soon. Anyway, thank you for being patient with me. Here's the last chapter.
Dean let out a cry and his hands snaked up to Castiel’s hair, to grab onto them. Castiel growled at the feeling and he started to work on Dean’s jeans. He pushed them down his legs and Dean let out a whimper as he shifted his weight to get them off of him, boots and socks with them. Castiel dropped down to his knees, mouthing along Dean’s harness and nipping at the top. He’d been leaking steadily, it seemed, because Castiel could taste him through his underwear. Castiel took it off of him and took Dean into his mouth, sucking on the head, to the point of Dean bending forward and letting out a choked off sound.
“What do you mean?” Jessica asked. Dean could hear the frown in her voice, even without looking at her to see it on her face as well. “What happened, Dean?”
“You don’t have to thank me,” Castiel said, not letting the overwhelming emotions lace his words.
Castiel didn’t wait for an answer. He just bolted out of the room, and leaned against the wall outside of the door, which clicked shut after him. He breathed heavily in and out. This was going to be complicated and awful. He was going to tell Dean everything. He slid down the wall and sighed out. He placed his arms over his bent knee and closed his eyes. He was pretty sure that Dean was going to kick him out. He was going to break things off and he was going to tell Castiel to never contact him again.
“Jesus,” Dean muttered. He let out a frustrated sigh and he rolled out from under the car. Bobby looked down at Dean with a bored face; his hands deep inside his jeans pockets. “What?” Dean barked at him.
, they turned on the street and the car stopped with another screech. Dean was waiting for him by the curb already. Castiel’s hands shook as he opened the car door and scooted to the side to let Dean in. Once Dean was inside, the door shut after him, locked and the car was moving again, Castiel grabbed Dean by the back of his neck and pulled him in for a rough kiss.
“Sir?” a sleepy, grumpy voice said from his right. Castiel looked down at Dean, who fell asleep on his chest, after having hours and hours of play time together. He looked rumpled in the best way possible. His biceps tensed as he moved, his back muscles rippling with his movement. He was blessedly naked, while Castiel wore his PJ’s to bed. Castiel locked his phone, and placed it back on the bed side table. He’d think about it more in the morning, right now, he needed to hold Dean close to him and get him back to sleep.
“I don’t know why you’re here, though?” Castiel asked, frowning. There was a headache working itself up to the front of his head. His face was starting to feel numb from it.
Castiel woke up with tears already falling down his eyes and the need to draw in a breath. He curled up even further in himself and took a deep, shaky breath. Squeezing his eyes shut, he tried to stop the tears and tried to breathe.
“I… you… Jesus.” Dean muttered and shook his head. “Honey, no. Once we get to Sam’s office, the tablet isn’t going to work, do you understand?”
“Really?”
“Ah,” Dean said with a laugh. He watched the fog leave his mouth on an exhale and sniffed. It was cold, and it was starting to snow again. The roads were a bit slushy, but thankfully, some of the owners of the stores on the street managed to clean the walkway. “I don’t know if you know much about me, but I have served a couple of years back.”
“I can’t do this now,” Dean spoke, cutting through Castiel’s thoughts.
“Yeah, like what?” Dean snapped. “I don't have a proper education. I can't sit in an office. I can do the dirty jobs well, but I don't make enough money. Sam, this way, I can set a limit to my payment. And if I get a good boss, a rich one who doesn't care about his money more than his pleasure, I can make it. I can take care of Natalie.”
He looked down at the address again, and he made a right turn to get on the street. He passed by few cars, and read the numbers on the buildings, but then he spotted the Impala and he knew that he was getting close. There was a free spot after it, so Castiel parked it before it. He cut off the engine and looked up at the building. The lights were all off. Castiel was sure that Dean was fast asleep, and he was really an idiot for doing this to Dean, but he had to. He needed Dean.
“Sorry. I’ll be quick. Hello?” he answered and Castiel heard a female’s voice coming through the speaker. Something zinged through his body that he would easily describe as jealousy, but he didn’t want to. Because he had nothing to be jealous of. Maybe it was Dean’s sister, but then he had said that he only had a brother… maybe a mother? Or an aunt? Or maybe a girlfriend? It wouldn’t be first time for an escort to be in a relationship…
“Dean, I’m glad you could make it. Here,” the people around the table shuffled around a bit and there was a free chair right next to Castiel. “What are you having?”
“Get your man, and do as I say,” Castiel got into the car and shut the door after him.
“Of course,” he replied, with a slight bow, just as the front doors opened. Dean had to remind himself to breathe.
“Yeah, thanks,” Dean said with a smile. Robert started to make Dean’s order for him quickly, already knowing the right amount of sugar he took in his coffee and what type of pretzel he liked best.
“I know about the whole not seeing, not touching rule. Don’t worry about it,” Dean, now naked, hunched forward a bit so he could look straight in Castiel’s eyes. “Now, do you trust me?”
“Natalie…” Castiel breathed out, his hands shaking. He clenched his hand around his gun as he tried to regain control over himself.
“I do,” Castiel admitted in a soft voice. Sam didn’t say anything back, but Castiel could see the way he relaxed.
“Let me get a cloth and clean you up, before sleep. You don’t want to wake up all sticky,” Castiel said as he got off the bed.
Mr. Novak placed his book on the table by the desk, his glasses on top of it. He turned around again and cupped Dean’s face in his hand, his thumb caressing his cheek. “You don’t ever have to apologize to me for expressing any sort of emotion, okay?”
“Give me what I want, and nobody will suffer. I promise you,” Castiel's heart was jumping up and down in his chest so hard he was surprised that no one in the room could hear it.
Now, it was night time, and Castiel made his way through the club; grinding hot bodies surrounding him, but his men made a small barricade around him so he could walk through the people without any of them touching him. Castiel walked up to the bar and the bartender immediately walked to him.
“We take what we can, Alastair,” Castiel said, taking a step forward. “You know it.”
“Is it dangerous?” Dean asked, trying not to let the fear of what Mr. Novak was saying get the best of his emotions.
“It’s fine,” Castiel said. He heaved out a sigh and said, “Actually, it’s not even close to being
Dean snorted as he tried to track down a nurse, “This was literally nothing, Mr. Novak. You haven’t even seen them when they’re not behaving, and there’s also Jo, Ellen and Ash added to the mix.”
“Your birthday suit.”
They stood up when Dean received another message from him saying he was outside. Anna hugged him again, as a goodbye by the front door. When they pulled back, she cupped his cheek and smiled at him. “Everything’s going to be okay.”
Dean looked into Mr. Novak’s eyes and he could see the struggle in them. These people knew who he was, of course they knew. But Dean had a feeling that these people wouldn’t hurt him, or throw stuff at him, be it verbally or physically.  Though it didn’t take long for Mr. Novak to just sigh and nod his consent. Dean’s smile grew as he grabbed Mr. Novak’s hand and tugged him to get close.
“Sir?” Kayla's voice floated back into his head and he blinked couple of times, before looking up.
Her eyes were sharp and nonjudgmental as they settled on him. Dean felt like he was being interrogated, and trapped. The only thing that was keeping him sane and not bolting out of this room was the hand squeezed in his. Mr. Novak’s thumb was caressing his knuckle; it was soothing.
“Get on with it,” Castiel said, trying not to sound impatient.
Eventually they parted and Dean pushed back to stand up. Before he left, he leaned in again and gave another chaste kiss to Castiel and started to walk away. “Hey, Dean,” Castiel said and Dean turned around to look at him. His lips were red and his cheeks still had a rosy blush to them, and his eyes were so bright that it took a moment for Castiel to find his voice. “You look good today,” he finally said, not even close to anything that he really wanted to say.
“I got caught up. When do they want to meet?” Castiel asked his hand petting Dean’s hair. If Dean was a cat, by this point he would probably start to purr. But then Castiel moved his hand down to Dean’s cheek and to his lips, and Dean tongued Castiel’s thumb into his mouth and started to suck on it. Castiel barely managed to contain a loud gasp, because the feeling went straight to his dick.
“Y-Yes,” he replied, feeling hesitant. There was a twitch from Dean, but Castiel didn’t look at him.
“I can help you out,” Lora said taking a step in the bedroom, but Dean shook his head.
"He's with me," was Castiel's only reply.
“Why not, sir?” Dean asked in a low voice. “I want to see you.”
Charlie worked her ass off, for couple of hours, but in the end she was satisfied with the final results so she gave Castiel’s men the coordination where the image was sent from. But it wasn’t easy.
“I know, I know! It’s been years, I should let this go. Hell, I should’ve already forgotten about it, but I can’t. I have tried. So many times, but I just… I can’t, okay?” Lora’s eyes teared up and Castiel’s face turned one of sadness.
Castiel froze. He wasn’t supposed to be here at this hour. He was supposed to be have gone home by the time the kid would wake up. He made this small promise to himself just before they fell asleep last night. But here he was, staring at the kid. She was staring at him with indifference and Castiel just noticed, she had a bunny in her hand that had definitely seen better days.
“Yes,” Castiel said shaking his head. “It was a voice recording, or something, because it sounded like an automatic voice. He said that whatever information I have on the events are false. I need you to contact Lucifer as fast as you can and demand answers. If you have to, drag him in for questioning. Beat him up. I don’t give a
Dean’s eyes widened in surprise, his mouth hanging open in a gasp. “Sir…”
“Yup.”
The moon wasn’t visible any more.
an ordinary looking guy, Dean Winchester, meet wolves. Actual live wolves. The gorgeous man was crazy.
She shrugged and said, “We have literally nothing to do. There’s still about a good twenty minutes to go until Sam will be home. So… talk.”
She flashed him a smile and at that moment, Mr. Novak turned around and beckoned her forward. “Can you please escort these men down to the entertainment room?” Lora nodded and Mr. Novak squeezed her shoulder in a thanks. “I'll be down in a minute.”
Castiel stared at him a bit longer, and then nodded. He quickly left the garden and into his car, barking orders at his men to hurry up. He was an idiot to leave Dean like that alone.
“Let’s go then.”
“I see how you look at yourself in the mirror,” Dean said, just as Castiel closed his eyes. So it was that one. “I saw how you were looking at yourself just now.”
“Take care of the bills,” Castiel finally said. He kept staring at Balthazar to gauge his reaction to what Castiel was telling him to do. Maybe he’d get it without having Castiel tell him about it explicitly. “Make sure that the guys get at least a week off. Let them go and do whatever they want. Only for a week. When they’re back, we have work to do. We still need to take care of a lot of stuff that has been left behind Alastair and Gordon.”
, Dean.”
“I need details. Specific details. Where he goes what he eats, who he sees, who he looks at. Where he fucking lives. I need to know everything at exact minute of the day,” he said, barely controlling his anger. “I need to learn his pattern.”
He clawed at his neck and tried to… He didn’t know what he was trying to do anymore. He just knew that he needed to relax and just take a deep breath. And then they came. The memories. The first time he had a panic attack and there were hands on him and there were worried green eyes staring at him. The eyes that belonged to a beautiful face, and an equally beautiful man. The lips that shaped the words
The guy suddenly thumped his head back on the seat, closed his eyes and gripped the wheel tightly in his hand. His lips opened up in a silent gasp, and Castiel frowned, his hold on the wheel tightening. Few seconds later, a guy sat back on the seat next to him and ran the back of his hand over his mouth. Castiel raised his eyebrows as he realized just what he witnessed, and then seconds later, the guy pressed down on the gas and drove off. Castiel sighed and shook his head. He pressed on the car with more force than it was necessary and he was off like a rocket, heading home.
“Is he ever going to?”
“Jesus, Dean,” Castiel turned around only to be faced by a timid looking Dean. “I’m not mad. I don’t think I can ever be mad at you. But you gotta understand; I’m just… I don’t know. I feel relieved, because that’s what I wanted to do from the minute I knew about this whole thing. But I also wasn’t counting on your agreement. I didn’t think of this… further. More than an offer, that is. I didn’t think you’d want to.”
Balthazar stared at him for a moment before he sighed. “Ah, shit.” He walked to the bar and poured himself a tumblr of rom. He took a sip from his drink and said, “He’s back to the scene.”
“Dean Winchester, sir.”
It took Dean couple of minutes to relax, but once he did, his weight was a comforting blanket on Castiel. “Sir,” he said again. “I know I’m probably going to sound out of line here, but… I gotta tell you something else.”
And then he hit him with the pad. The pain was dull, and Dean uttered the numbers as loudly as he could. He could feel his ass being reddened, by the minute, he could feel the warmth from the burn. What made this even more pleasant was the vibration in his ass. Every time the pad connected with his ass, the vibrator kept pushing up in his ass and the feeling was overwhelming. His dick was steadily leaking by now. It was so hard that a slight touch was going to make him cum in a second.
“Who?” Dean asked stepping forward into the bedroom some more.
Castiel didn’t grab Dean’s dick in his hand. No, he moved his point and middle finger up and down his length, resting against his belly, in the same rhythm as his hip movement. He was going to come like this.
Castiel made his way to him, trying to keep his breathing steady. He stopped when he was a bench away from Dean.
“Are you going to feed them to me?” Mr. Novak asked and Dean stared into his eyes. For a moment, they did just that. Dean swallowed as Mr. Novak’s eyes darkened. Dean took a steadying breath and then said, “As you wish, sir.”
Mr. Novak rolled his eyes and gave Dean a smile. Dean’s heart escalated a bit, which had nothing to do with the idea of meeting the pack. “Don’t be ridiculous. They’re sweethearts. You’re going to meet the puppies.”
“Yeah, I know. Any news?”
“Because of this… this whole mess that is your life, man. I mean, you were born into this. It wasn’t a choice that you consciously made. It was something that was thrust upon you from the minute you were conceived. And now…” Dean snorted and shook his head, leaning away from Mr. Novak’s body. Mr. Novak started to rub his hand up and down Dean’s back again. It was torturously slow caress, which were leaving electrifying feelings behind them. Dean shuddered at the touch and closed his eyes.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked him, in a carefully blank voice. Castiel would know this, because he knew Dean from inside out.
Dean was alone in the park, with only his coffee to keep him company.
Enjoy~
“Hey, no need to apologize. You did say they were Mr. Novak's favorite rooms.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel whispered.
"Okay. Is he okay?"
He remembered how he felt when Dean grazed his lips on Castiel’s neck. How it raised goosebumps and how they curled up behind his teeth in order to sink into Castiel’s skin as Castiel fucked him into the mattress. Those moments happened outside of bedroom as well; hugging each other and Dean would turn his head and kiss his neck. Sitting on a couch to watch a movie, Dean cuddling close to Castiel, his head laying down on his shoulder, and he would turn his head a bit and kiss Castiel’s neck. Too many simple moments had passed between them, but those were the moments that Castiel remembered.
Dean drove behind the building where he found a free spot right next to spiffy looking cars. His car was still the best one out of them all. Feeling confident, he strolled his way up the already gathered people outside of the club. Gabriel told him to go to the bouncer and tell him he was there to see
Balthazar nodded and walked out of the apartment to get their men. Lora excused herself to her bedroom, not wanting to witness the display that was going to take place soon. Castiel sighed and sat properly on the chair. He was tired. He was too old for this already and he was tired. He had been trying to be a better boss for them, and to maintain a personal life, and to keep afloat even when everything was falling apart, but now, he was sure of it, he couldn't have one thing while the other was in crumbles.
She turned her back on him and he stared at her back. She was wearing a red dress today, the length of it kissing the floor as she slowly walked away from him. Her back was rigid and he could see the tension there. She leaned forward on the table, the whip dangling from her hand. They were in her office and Dean stared as a drop of blood hit the ground. So he was right. His skin did break. This was going to be a pain to recover from. But then he was being punished for something he hasn’t done, right?
The party moved onto the reception area, and Dean breathed out a sigh of relief when he saw that it was exactly like Anna had wanted it to be. The evening sun was starting to set, and Dean knew that in about 10 or so minutes, the lights were going to be turned on and the party would really start.
Slowly, Dean stood up in his full height. His face was a mask of indifference. It was unnerving to see how every wall Dean had put down was starting to come back up on his face. In the end, Dean stood there and looked at Castiel. And then, Dean’s face transformed into something that Castiel never seen before; Dean gave him a flirtatious smirk, and his eyes darkened a bit.
"You gotta be shitting me… I thought he was out."
Another blow landed right on Gabriel’s neck, and he gasped for air.
Dean’s strangled up cries left his lips without a problem. He gritted his teeth and tried not to fuck back onto Mr. Novak’s fingers. He panted with the rhythm of the movements and then the feeling was gone. Dean turned around to glare at Mr. Novak only to see him lubing up the plug. Dean’s eyes went down his body and his mouth watered as he saw how really excited Mr. Novak was about this.
“Of course,” Castiel replied. “Go with casual clothes. You don’t have to be so uh… formal.”
“Dean is leaving the premises in his car. I need at least two of your men to keep an eye on him.”
“Good. Me too,” Castiel said, smiling. “Everyone this is Dean. Dean, this is, well, everyone.”
Emilio left soon after they spoke some more on the matter, and they promised that they’ll be in touch. All of this happened, while Dean sat silently beside him, not moving, nor even making a sound. Castiel wasn’t exactly ignoring him, but he wasn’t talking to him either. He wasn’t sure why he was doing it exactly, but… he was just keeping his distance for now…
That simple family dinner consisted of lots of people who looked intimidating even when they were laughing and talking amongst each other like normal people. He took a drink from his red wine and tried not to show just how uncomfortable he was feeling.
“What’s wrong?” he asked in a low tone, the vibration of his voice going through Dean’s body, and the feeling was so comforting, so familiar, that Dean twisted around a bit and threw both of his arms around Mr. Novak to hug him closer. He shuffled down a bit and buried his face at the crook of Mr. Novak’s neck and started to breathe in his scent. Mr. Novak still smelled like watermelon and it was starting to become something that Dean would never forget. He was going to become obsessed to this scent and it wouldn’t even bother Dean at all.
“Of course,” Castiel said.
Castiel sighed and said, “Lora, I know you have stuff that you have wanted to tell me since-“
“When did you lose him?” she asked. Her voice sounded soothing.
“Castiel,” Crowley said again. Castiel looked up at him. He knew his face was blank, and his eyes were still ice cold. But he didn’t have it in him to show it on his face. He wanted to find Dean. He had a single minded mission in his head, and it was that.
“Do you wanna talk about it?”
“He betrayed me…” Castiel whispered. “He betrayed
Dean froze up and his smile vanished from his face. He stopped breathing and a little sound escaped his lips, “Uhh… I was trying to take comfort? You said I could take it out on you.”
Maybe someday he’d be able to share his body with Dean…
“Take my phone number,” Castiel said holding his hand out for his card. Balthazar placed one in his hand, with a look that Castiel completely ignored. “Text me the amount you’ll need and your account number. Personal account number,” Charlie gave him a nervous smile, nodding. “I’ll send it out the second you’ll write me.”
“The time that he landed me in the hospital, Sam had already graduated and had a normal life and had a job, and Jess on his arm,” Dean said, remembering the whole thing vividly. “I was half-dead, and I don’t really know what Sam actually did, but he got all lawyer-y on the whole thing. He helped out. Got me into therapy. I got myself back up together. Met Lisa, got married, and then we just broke because she didn’t know about my past. Then she found out about it, and well… here I am.”
When they were done everyone clapped for them, and the lights started to turn back on. Dean stood up from his table and walked to the bar to get a new drink. He waited for his turn, since there were some other people there to get their drinks. He looked around again, trying to find Mr. Novak but there was still no sign of him. When it was his turn, he ordered scotch and waited to be served.
“I was traveling the world. So I couldn’t come to the wedding.”
There he was, Lucifer, bound to the chair. His face was unrecognizable with the bruising and the swelling that he received from all of the beatings he got on his face. He was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants, and he was barefeet. They got him from his own house. They killed Lucifer’s family, and they were going to kill Lucifer too. In front of Castiel.
“Hmm...” Dean nodded and then he looked hesitant. Castiel regarded him for a moment, it looked like Dean wanted to tell him something but he didn't know how to do it in front of so many people. So Castiel snapped his fingers, dismissed his men with a flicker of his fingers, and one by one everyone left the office. The door shut behind them and Dean looked at him with bright eyes.
“Daddy, do you know what we’re gonna do?” Natalie asked, looking at Dean with childlike happiness shining from her heart. Dean’s heart warmed at her face.
On with the chapter we go.
“Mr. Novak, as you can see, I'm not making enough to be able to give you back... Business isn't thriving as it used to.”
“Okay,” she squeaked out, nodding her head vigorously. “Not like you were going to do exactly that, but yeah, okay. I get it. Okay.” Castiel nodded, and stood up. He offered his hand to her and she grabbed it, Castiel pulling her up to stand. Castiel jerked in surprise as she wrapped her arms around him in a hug, and squeezed him close. Castiel patted her back and they pulled back few seconds later.
Castiel had frowned down at the message, and then paled. Instantly, he knew who she meant. Julie sniffed at his hand, letting out a low growl in her chest. Castiel dropped his hand on top of her head, petting her fur, relaxing a bit as he felt the smoothness of it in between his fingers.
Castiel, for his part, picked up a manila file and opened it. Dean Winchester’s face was at the top of the file. Castiel’s heart twisted a bit before he started to go through them all and it took him only a second to realize that the file was filled with pictures of Dean.
“You should know!” Dean yelled at him. “You should fucking know! If something happens to him. If even a hair falls out of his head…”
Dean knew that she was right. There was no argument against the words that she spoke. There was no doubt in it. He knew what Mr. Novak was capable of, but he wasn’t sure where he himself was at on his list of priorities. Hearing Anna tell him that he was important for Mr. Novak was something he never realized that he needed to hear.
“Seems like it…” Charlie said. She looked just as shaken as Castiel was feeling.
“That’s alright. I’ll show and teach you,” Dean said, as he turned Mr. Novak around and pulled him flush to his body. Their chests were pressed up so close to each other, that Dean could feel Mr. Novak’s heartbeat against his. The music kept on playing, and Dean lifted Mr. Novak’s hands to wrap around his neck, while he placed his hands around Mr. Novak’s waist. “It’s just like sex, Mr. Novak,” Dean said, his voice low, their foreheads now rested on each other’s. Dean moved their hips together, as he continued. “You don’t let your brain move you, though. Let your body take control.”
“What other choice do I have?”
Emilio ended his call and shook his head, as he sat opposite Castiel. “I was on the phone with my network, and they say they can’t track down the call because it was a burner phone. Which they had planted it with an explosive.”
“Dean,” Mr. Novak said again. Dean pried his eyes away from Silver to look at Mr. Novak. “Can you let my arms go? I think it’s going to bruise if you will squeeze a bit harder.”
“Gabriel.”
“Oh?”
“Dean, I’m starving. Is the meal almost ready?” he asked in a deep, scratchy voice, which zinged through Dean’s body like a knife.
“I’m fairly certain my brain cells are still intact, and I haven’t gone mad with time,” Castiel replied coolly.
Dean nodded and they walked back to the bedroom. Castiel sat on the bed as Dean started to rummage through his drawers for underwear, pants and a t-shirt. He grabbed them and walked back to Castiel. He placed them by Castiel’s hip and took a step back. “Uh… I’m gonna go to the bathroom and get changed. You okay to do this yourself?”
“Mr. Novak… sir…”
“You will, before we get to Sam’s job,” he said, trying to not snap at her. She loved being whiny. “Now, behave. Please.”
“You still feel the need to… to talk to him,” Amara said, her face clearing. “You still need him. Just like he needs you.”
“Of course I will. But I know that I can handle it. I loved what we did. Trust me,” Dean said, as he finished cuffing the buttons of sleeves back into their place. “It felt more like a reward than anything else.”
Dean walked passed it, and passed the closed doors of the kitchen and some bedrooms that he wasn’t allowed to step into either. He walked a bit further down the hallway and stopped right in front of the office door. He knocked once, and there was a hummed reply. Assuming that she had agreed for him to come inside, he opened the door and stepped inside.
He looked irresistible. Intrigued, Castiel wrote back to Gabriel.
At the park, Dean sat by the bench while Natalie went wild on the slides there. She took turns on the various slides, then she hang herself from the ropes, smiling and giggling with the kids, then she was on the swings. One of the older boys there helped her out and started to push her. He looked like a nice kid, so Dean didn’t mind it much.
he found Dean. He wasn’t here for that. “So,” Castiel said, changing the subject. He drowned his glass in a big gulp. He didn’t place his glass on the desk. Instead he held it in his hand; with a vice like grip, staring at it.
“I'm not gonna go after her just because of-of some money issue. This... this isn't war, Sam. And if it was, I'd still lose.”
“Uh… I don’t wanna intrude. I actually didn’t think about all of this in a reasonable manner.”
Castiel nodded at him and helped him to gather up his papers. He thanked Castiel one more time and then left.
He went up to his bedroom and got dressed. He went for casual. He wore black jeans, and a black sweater. He ran his hands through his hair and looked at himself in the mirror for a moment, before he deemed himself acceptable to go out. He has gotten old, for sure. There were more gray hair in his hair than it had been before, and there were more wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes.
He started on the pancakes soon after. And he was pretty sure that they shouldn’t have looked this… “Gooey. They look extremely gooey.” She said as she looked into the bowl. She was shuffling her feet on one another and she was standing close to Castiel.
Dean fluttered his eyes open and then closed them again. The sunlight was too bright in this place. His lips were parted and they were dry, so he closed his mouth and smacked his lips together. It helped to gain consciousness into them for a bit, but he needed to drink some water. His body felt heavy and his back had an uncomfortable feeling to it. Maybe he slept in one position all night long. Judging by the way he was still on his stomach, he probably has.
He lifted his left arm up swiftly and shot, right in the middle of his forehead, bullet leaving from the back of his head. One shot. That's all it took.
“I don’t have booze around,” Dean said as he walked to his kitchen, Castiel following behind him. “I have orange juice though, if you want.”
As if he could read his mind, Mr. Novak stepped out of the bathroom and Dean swiveled around to look at him. And what a beautiful sight it was. Mr. Novak, as usual, donned a black suit, from head to toe. He had a slim tie on, and everything fit him as a glove. His hair was styled up in a way that made Dean want to run his fingers through them. Mr. Novak ran his hands over the front of the jacket and looked up at Dean. His eyes went down his body and slowly, very, very slowly, glided up his body and unto his face. By the time he got there, Dean was feeling flustered and tense, and a little bit hard in his pants. He could feel his face burning from a blush.
Castiel didn’t know how to respond to it, but to kiss Dean on the lips. Dean was quick to respond to him. He opened up his lips and Castiel let his tongue roam around in Dean’s mouth. He was grabbing Dean’s neck with his hand, as his thumb gently caressed Dean’s jawline. Their lips moved together as one.
, went through the past few years… He was covered in scars, and Castiel didn’t know anything about it. He didn’t know what Dean’s body looked like these days. And what it looked like today, right at this moment. He wanted to help. He wanted to cradle Dean up in his arms and protect him from everyone and everything. He wanted nothing more than to just take Dean and leave everything behind, and hide him away. But he couldn’t do that. Not now. And he didn’t know if he’d ever be able to do that either.
“Hey, Abby,” he received kisses and hugs from her.
Dean quickly complied. He bent forward, and rested his arms over the table. Mr. Novak placed his hand over Dean's back, close to his shoulder blades and grabbed the lube from the table. His hand moved down Dean's spine and rested lightly over Dean's ass. Dean heard the lube's bottle being opened and then heard the unmistakable sound of it being squirted over Mr. Novak's fingers. He then felt Mr. Novak move his ass cheek to the side and then slowly move his fingers over the tight rim of his anus. It didn't take Mr. Novak long before Dean relaxed his muscles and Mr. Novak's finger entered him. Dean gasped at the intrusion and he grabbed the edge of the table. His lips parted as the fingers started to move in and out of him. Not long after that, Mr. Novak tried to go in with two fingers and Dean's body welcomed it at once.
“Don’t I know it,” she said seriously, but she shot him a smirk and a wink. Castiel relaxed further.
“What the fuck do I see?” Dean stepped forward into the bathroom and Castiel’s whole body tensed up. “You’re not only drunk off your ass, you’re also- you look so fucking broken. You look like you’re… you’re in pain. In so much pain. And I can’t do anything about it, because I don’t know what’s wrong. I don’t know why you’re that way. And I don’t know how to… how to help you out.” Dean was two feet away from Castiel. And Castiel was shaking from head to toe. He could feel the sweat on his back, on his day old and dirty clothes that still smelled like whiskey. “Do you realize how helpless I felt?” Dean whispered, his hands clenched at his sides.
Castiel, not trusting his voice, nodded. He opened his eyes and looked down on the floor as Dean started to move around him. He took the towels off the bed and got the blankets down to the bottom of the bed. He helped Castiel to get into bed, and then walked to the bathroom to place the towels there. Dean walked back to the bed. Before he got in, he took off his shirt, dropped it by the bed, and got in.
“Sure thing, boss.”
Leave me your thoughts!
“Wow. How come I haven’t seen you at the wedding?” Dean said, leaning against the counter.
“I’m already on it, boss,” Balthazar said, and he sounded serious and stressed enough. So Castiel knew he was taking this seriously. “And for the Winchester brother?”
Not wanting to look like a slob, Dean ironed his white button down shirt. His dark blue jeans were a little rough on the edges but it looked clean to wear. He grabbed his best looking boots and his favorite belt. Once he was done wearing his clothes, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt while staring at himself in the mirror. He looked nice. His hair was a bit windswept, which was the best he could come up with. Not like it could get any better than that, but he still looked nice. Okay he looked real good. He took a steadying breath as he checked the time and it was already 9:30. He was supposed to meet with Gabriel at his club by 10.
Castiel looked at her. Her young face was lined with worry lines and she looked tired, and stressed. Castiel felt for her and he understood her, so maybe it was why he found himself blurting out, “He won’t talk to me. He told me not to talk to him all those years ago. I’m not going to-I won’t talk to him. I won’t break that promise.”
“Dean?” Mr. Novak's voice cut through his wandering thoughts and he was back to present.
“What year?” Emilio asked, looking interested. The conversation picked back up around him again, but it didn’t disrupt their ongoing one.
Dean carefully made his way down the stairs and walked to the kitchen, seeing Jessica pouring them ice tea to cool off. She placed them by the counter and tried to get the chips from the tall shelf, but she couldn’t reach them. Dean walked up and got them down himself. “You’d think your brother would want for our boy to eat whatever he wanted, but no. He has to make things difficult.”
“I believe that you don’t get to ask questions,” Alastair said and his voice was carrying an edge to it. Normally, that would’ve made Dean tense up. But not today.
Castiel placed the ring on his right hand’s ring finger. He didn’t feel any different from what he felt from moments ago, but there was this sense of ease in his body and he started to breathe a bit more easily. There was this calmness that descended on him as he made his way out of the bedroom and walked down the stairs.
“Gordon,” Castiel said, feeling the heavy weight of his word. He needed to find them. Both of them. Castiel didn’t know how many more times he had to tell himself those words before he’d get sick of them.
“Everything okay? You looked worried,” Dean asked, perching himself up on his hand and looking up at Castiel. The bedroom was dark, there was only a small light spilling through the windows. The moon was high up in the sky tonight.
He ended the call, and a foggy breath left his mouth. Castiel wasn’t sure what he was doing around this area, but all he knew that nothing else mattered at this moment but Dean. He looked good. He was wearing black jeans, with black boots. He had a beige coat on that came short to his thighs. It was unbuttoned and Castiel could see him wearing a white button down. He always looked perfect with a button down.
“Can you add more syrup to my pancakes?” the question was so out of the blue and so not the question that Castiel was expecting her to ask, that he closed his eyes, hung his head forward, and shook it in disbelief.
“How did he…?”
Castiel had decided to go for casual clothes. A dark grey turtleneck with black jeans and boots. He had his coat on as well. He bit down on his lower lip, as he willed his arms to move and to remove his leather gloves, at the very least. Since they still refused to knock. So now that he was done with that, it wouldn’t be that hard to just knock on the door. What could happen? He would open the door, Castiel would step inside, and then… and then, Castiel didn’t know. There was only one way to find out the unanswered questions, wasn’t there?
"Damn it," Balthazar sighed and rubbed at his chin. "How did it get here?"
“I’m sorry,” he said as he tried to touch Dean, but he left his hand to himself. He wasn’t about to try and touch Dean.
“He has a big library in here too,” she continued. “It's one of his favorite place to be, really.”
There was a dull ache somewhere between his shoulder blades; he was sure he was bleeding out from somewhere around his lower back. There certainly was a headache that he couldn’t seem to shake off. His wrists have stopped hurting so much as they did hours ago. He was sure that he had cut the skin there. He was naked. Completely, butt, naked. He was bounded to this giant X like pillars.
One of the many things that Castiel didn’t like doing was waiting. He could be patient, incredibly so when it came to stuff that would give him pleasure. But right now, he was at a snapping point. He clenched and unclenched his hands as he looked at the map on the table. He had the whole thing memorized, into the last detail, in his head, and he was ready to go. But he still couldn’t move.
“Don’t lie to me. I know you kn-“
“No,” Dean groaned out. He tugged on his chains, but they wouldn’t budge. “No,” he whispered again just as he was gagged. He bit down on the cloth and tugged on his chains again. His skin started to burn from it, but he didn’t care.
loud about his emotions, but Castiel surprised him.
Castiel quirked up an eyebrow and looked back at Balthazar. “Footage shows otherwise.”
. Castiel had no idea how this man managed to get a seat reservation for them there, but dinner was at 7.
“Cas-“
Dean stared at Castiel’s back and then quickly unlocked his phone to see what he saw that made Castiel look that way. He sighed as he saw the older messages he had to share with her. Mostly on the explicit content, the toys she wanted to use on him when he’d have to go to her… a pic or two of him in a compromising position that she wanted to see. For someone who didn’t care about Dean and his wellbeing, she asked a lot of photo evidences of him being naked.
“It’s all wet,” he mumbled, running his hands through the wet stuff on the floor. He didn’t know what it was, maybe there was a pipe that got blown off. That would’ve been funny. For some reason, the thought made him giggle.
Dean tried to relax, but he couldn’t. His skin was buzzing and he felt clammy, and he really just wanted to take a shower. “Please,” he whispered, finally finding his voice. “Please, just let me shower first.”
“Yeah?” the voice was sleepy. It was past midnight after all.
Castiel didn't know what to reply to her, so he kept his mouth shut. Moved beyond words by what she said. He didn't know what he could do to make it better with his men… He didn't want them to hate him, or endanger anyone's lives while they were supposed to protect them. He turned to Balthazar and said, "Please, bring them here."
He quickly got another bullet in the bazooka and got in position. He looked through the hole to see if there was anything left of them, when he saw some of the men limping their way to the other SUV that was a little bit way off where they had originally stood at. They were close to the car, when Castiel didn’t even think twice as he aimed his next shot at the car. This time he was ready for the impact and Castiel looked upon them as the car exploded and several men had blasted right fuck off the sight.
So he did just that. He gathered Dean up in his arms, and despite Dean being so heavy, Castiel loved feeling the stretch in his arms as he pulled him up. He slowly made his way to the couch. He laid Dean down there, who licked his lips and got into a deeper slumber. Castiel took off his suit jacket and placed it on the table. And then he took off his shoes and placed them by the table.
Castiel’s blood ran cold. His limbs turned numb and his face cleared of all emotions. “What.”
Dean blinked and said, “Sorry.”
“Oh, come on,” Dean said, while Castiel replied, “I brought him in yesterday.”
Gabriel's face was stern and serious. He wanted for Dean to understand the importance of his plans and decisions. Dean looked at Gabriel and after a minute of staring by both parties, Dean nodded his consent. Gabriel tilted his glass up and Dean returned the gesture. It was time to negotiate.
“I didn’t want to tell you,” Castiel mumbled. “Didn’t wanna drag you in this mess.”
“I know you’re an escort.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, as he replied with an affirmative message. Then he looked up at Anna, hesitated, and then asked. “You won’t tell him any of this, right?”
“Dean?”
PS: I have no idea when the next update will be :(
Castiel looked away and stared at the painting on the wall. It was a painting by Paul Cezanne,
“Dean-“
“I will end you,” Castiel said coldly. His voice broke no argument. He had never been this serious in his life. Knowing the threat that was hanging over his… his Dean, he had to do something about it.
He jumped in surprise when Dean enveloped him in a hug. He stood there, frozen, his eyes trained at the door. Slowly, he lifted his arms up and wrapped them around Dean. He felt puzzled and bewildered by the sudden display of affection, but he was going to soak himself in it, and hold on as much as he could.
Dean banged the door shut after him, and walked towards the desk. Dean looked… he looked angry, furious, his eyes blazing, his lips pursed, and Castiel realized that he had missed Dean terribly. “Well, I don’t know,
“I know, Sammy. Damn it, I know.”
I'm having a mini-panic attack cos I'm hitting a heavy writer's block :(
“Успокойся (
“Sammy?” she asked instead.
He has left the house about 40 minutes ago. Balthazar had asked him where he was going, and then demanded Alfie to go with him, but Castiel refused to budge. So then he went and gotten his car from the garage and left the building in a record time. The streets weren’t icy, but the snow kept on coming. It seemed that it didn’t stop coming since it had started to snow yesterday. And by now the sidewalks and such were filled with snow.
)” Dmitry started to yell louder and louder. Castiel looked at him in surprise. He looked at Balthazar for a moment, who had rolled his eyes in annoyance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, tell me about it,” Castiel replied in a low voice, and shook his head.
