chuckled and shook his head. “I’m sure he’s fine, but he did leave me with his meat stick, so who knows.”
He's becoming more human everyday maybe his appetite will return too. Dean grabbed a couple beers out of the fridge and balanced the plates on his arms as he walked back towards the pool house. Sam met him at the door with wide eyes and a bright smile spread across his face.
Dean sighed heavily behind the steering wheel of the Impala. He nervously wiped his palms on the top of his thighs as the pulsating neon lights of the bar—no, gay bar–danced across Baby’s hood.
Chuck timidly walked up to Castiel. “I believe in you, son. If anyone can get through to her, it’s you. I’d like you to take this.” He handed Castiel a long chain with a pendant attached to it. “It was your mothers.”
Castiel relinquished his grip and slipped his hand inside Dean's boxers, finally getting a proper grip on him. He stroked him hard and fast, tongue flicking out to lick Dean's lips.
"Almost my whole life, ma'am. We met in first grade and have been joined at the hip ever since." He stumbled a little bit but straightened himself.
Hell. Fire. Chains gouged through his skin to keep him suspended over the flames beneath him. Blood dripping down to his elbows with a piece of someones liver in his hand. The smell of burning...well, everything. Black eyes and a broken heart.
His heart was so heavy that he wanted to reach inside his vessel and rip it out. It wasn’t doing him any favors anyway. It’s what got him into this mess.
Dean took another huge bite, making his cheeks pop out like a chipmunk and smiled. "I ain't scared'a your germs, Cas." He winked and swallowed before popping each finger in his mouth to lick them clean. Castiel pressed his lips together as his face flushed and turned on his heel, pretending to check the times on the coffee carafes. He heard Dean chuckle behind him. "Alright, Cas, I'll get outta your hair. Hey, you comin' over tonight? Jess is makin' sloppy joes."
"They weren't even really talking about me, Dean. Lucifer was doing what he always does, tearing people down." Castiel tightened his grip on Dean's hand. "Just, don't let him get to you," he pleaded, looking up into Dean's eyes. "As much as I'd love to see him knocked down a peg or two, he's not worth it."
He didn't remember closing the distance between himself and Lucifer. He didn't remember the crunch of his knuckles across Lucifer's cheek. He didn't know Lucifer had landed a punch right on his nose. He didn't realize Gabriel and Cain were trying to pull him back until he heard Castiel's voice.
“It’s alright. Father wont stop sending them until I agree. It’s better to just go now and get it over with.” Castiel held up his hand and signaled the soldiers to wait as he walked back into the hut. He opened a small door and pulled out two shirts and a pair of pants. “Sam hasn’t returned with your things yet. Would you like to borrow this for now?” He held out the shirt and pants to the familiar.
Dean dragged the garbage and old furniture out into the yard and onto a tarp. With all the rain last night, the pool was over flowing onto the tiles, so Dean used a push broom to sweep the black, smelly water outside. He also removed the raccoon using a rake and thick rubber gloves. He hauled in a pressure hose from the garage and sprayed down the vines and caked on dirt that clung to the walls, revealing a giant mural. Once the room was de-cluttered and completely swept out, Dean stood back and admired his work.
She gave Dean a curt nod and turned her attention back to her brother. “Why have you stayed away for so long? We’ve missed you.”
"Don't even get me started, Castiel!" he shouter, alerting the rest of the family. "You've always been a disappointment but I
"So, Dean," Balthazar pulled a measuring tape out of his waistcoat, "have you ever been fitted for a suit before?"
"He's a nerd," Dean snorted. "Always loved readin' and learnin' new stuff. There were more books than toys in his room when we were little."
When he was satisfied, he dropped the lifeless demon onto the ground and stalked over to Gabriel with a wicked grin.
Ellen pulled away and held Dean by the shoulders. "Ain't nothin' to be scared of. If he can't deal with this," she grabbed Deans gloved hand and squeezed it lightly, "then he isn't the one for you anyway. It's
"For appearances sake," Castiel pleaded. Dean reached out his trembling hand and wiped at his face with the other, trying to make it look like he didn't just witness a murder. They walked in silence through the house until they reached Michelle's office. Castiel didn't bother to knock, instead he shoved the door open and dragged Dean in behind him.
“Shut up.” Amara waved her arm out to the side. Dean’s body flew through the air and landed hard against a rock. He squawked in pain and tried to flap his wing but cried out in pain. She laughed out loud and snapped her fingers in Dean’s direction. Castiel watched as Dean’s body slowly and painfully shifted back into his human form. “Sorry, Castiel. It’ll take twice as long for your pet to heal in his human form. Looks like it’s just you and me now.”
Castiel stepped off the porch, eyes burning a hole into the witch in front of him. "She deserved everything she got," he growled. "If I could go back I'd do it all again, only this time I'd make her suffering last twice as long."
Castiel’s hands tremble as he reaches up and cups the sides of Dean’s neck. Instead of responding, he lifts Dean’s face to meet his and kisses him gently. He feels Dean’s tongue swipe at his bottom lip and lets his mouth fall open. His breath comes out in ragged pants as he grips the back of Dean’s neck and squeezes.
Bobby and Ellen shared a look. "Last I checked, Sam was a grown ass man and can make his own decisions," Ellen said. "He's real smart, quick learner. He'd be of some real use around here." Sam beamed at Ellen who winked at him. "And is this really the right time to be bitching about your brothers extracurricular activities? There's a coven of witches lookin' for your boy right now." Ellen craned her head towards the bathroom before jabbing her pointer finger into the table. "Four people have already died in this town," Ellen whispered, "our job is to find em and stop em. Now are you gonna stand here all night and gripe or are we gonna get to work?"
The witch blushed and walked over to the table. “You certainly came prepared,” he said, changing the subject.
Castiel tossed the bowl of glass into a hollowed out stump by the sink. “Have—have you ever been away from Lucy for a long period of time?”
He could still hear Dean shivering and rubbing his hands over his flannel to help warm up. He tossed and turned in the bed as Castiel tried in vain to warm himself.
Dean’s eyes went wide as his roommate held him still and slithered his mostly naked body against his own. Their sweat slicked chests rubbing together made goosebumps rise on Dean’s skin.
“I think it needs more bruisewort. What do you think?” He looked up past the drying herbs hanging from the ceiling to his only companions.
"M-maybe we can circle back to Adam after we find out who's all working with Alistair?" Dean offered. "As fun as it would be go to in guns blazing, we need to get intel on who's doing what and with who. Cas is right, Adam
Charlie sat down on the foot of Dean’s bed and watched Sam take a seat in the corner. “I thought maybe we should have this conversation face to face,” she explained, wiping her hands nervously down her dress.
“I’m starting to,” the witch hissed. “Why didn’t you help her? Teach her to control her powers, not lock her away in a cell!” His eyes flared with orange and Dean felt a river of fear and hatred run through his mark.
Dean took a long drink and set the mug down with shaky hands before running a hand down his face. "Only about fifty," he sighed. He wrapped his fingers around the mug, letting the heat thaw his frozen fingers. "So," he swallowed thickly, "my house is the sight of a mass murder?"
They fumbled with ties and buttons as they peeled each other out of their clothes. Once the sheets were the only fabric covering them, Castiel grazed his fingers down Deans stomach and circled his hipbones. He felt the familiar shiver underneath him.
Dean covered his grin with a hand and shook his head. "You're gonna be the death of me," he whispered to himself. They stared at each other for a long minute before Dean cleared his throat and broke the spell. "I'm gonna go check the pool. It's gotta be empty by now and I'll clean it out and start filling it with water for you, alright?" Dean reached for the doorknob just as Castiel made a gargling sound in the back of his throat.
"Oh fuck," Alfie sighed, lowering his head. His hands shook so hard the chair rattled and his eyes brimmed with tears.
he thought to himself. Because an angel, his best friend, and the guy he’s been in love with for-fucking-ever was sitting next to him looking like pure sin.
Dean huffed a laugh as he snuffed out his cigarette and stood, letting the blanket fall to his feet. He walked up behind Castiel and let his hands glide up the mans torso until his fingertips brushed against Cas' tie. Hooking his chin over Cas' shoulder, he straightened it and patted his chest before kissing the side of his neck. "You did say you were looking forward to--what was it?-- 'eradicating my innocence'?" Dean let his hand fall to Cas' belt as he nipped the skin on the back of Cas' neck.
"I've never seen anything like this," Charlie whispered. She looked to Gabriel with a soft smile. "Human form," she whispered and gestured to herself.
Cas turned and headed towards the door before stopping. “For what it’s worth, those were the best weeks of my life. I meant what I said, Dean. I love you.” He continued out the door and down the hallway.
Dean half collapsed against the office wall and slid down until he was sitting on his haunches. "So he's just been---what---alone all this time? Why don't you guys---I dunno, go keep him company or something? He can't just be left alone, Ellen!"
"I ain't sad," Dean held the hand against his face lightly. "I just don't look good in blue," he winked, trying to lighten the mood.
Dean bit back a smile as he took the last drink of his beer. “Just for tonight, actually. You still livin’ around here?”
"What happened? I can't remember anything after---" A flash of Dean pulling the witch in close. His mouth pressing against his own.
Sam frowned and ran a hand through his hair. "Dean, you were going nowhere back home and you know it. You were suffocating in that apartment and hated your job. You only stayed because of me. I can't---I won't let you live a miserable life just because you think you have to be within arms length of me my whole life. I love you, Dean, I do. But you---you
Dean started at the black liquid in his cup before shrugging and taking a drink. He sighed and leaned his head against the soft headboard. "Ok."
“I can’t!” Castiel shouted. “I’m not—” more lightning cracked over head but never touched down, “I’m not strong enough!”
The demons eyes watered as he gasped. His tiptoes swayed and swiped at the ground beneath him, trying desperately to find a grip.
"Take a picture, Cas. It'll last longer," Dean winked before reaching down. "I uh, grabbed your bag by accident," he explained as he picked up his bag. "Want me leave yours in there?" He hooked his thumb over his shoulder towards the bathroom.
Dean looked up to Castiel who pressed his lips together and nodded. "She uh---came up to me at the bar while you 'n Cas were having your meeting." He cleared his throat and narrowed his eyes, thinking back. "I thought it was Cas comin' up behind me so I turned around and she started flirting with me. Said she'd never seen anyone with Cas at these parties before," he looked up again and offered Cas a weak smile. "Asked for my name and said he hoped to see me around, and that was it. She didn't even drink the beer she ordered," he added as an after thought.
Castiel dug his toes into the dirt nervously. “As soon as I touched him I could feel it. He hates flying,” he chuckled. “He was feeling very ill so I made a potion to cure it.”
“I take it back,” Castiel whispered as he ran a thumb over Dean’s bottom lip. “I love the taste of champagne.”
The creatures eyes narrowed into tiny slits. A black and green fist raised out of the water near its head, slowly spreading long fingers mimicking Dean's gesture.
Castiel turned and smiled up at the heads. “That’s Flox, Pital, and Badler. I accidentally cursed them when I was twelve.” The witch shook his head and raised an eyebrow. “Gabriel said it was be irresponsible to pawn them off on someone else, so they’ve been with me ever since. They’re a handful but you’ll learn to love them.” He smiled and turned back to Dean who was staring at the witch with an unreadable expression. “I mean, what I meant to say was–”
“Ok fine, it’s not just a crush. I’ve basically liked him since I laid eyes on him. Either he’s completely out of touch with how flirting works, or he just doesn’t like me because we’ve known each other for two years and he’s never reciprocated.”
"I don't know what to tell you man, I guess they just like me better," Sam joked taking the book back. "There's a lot of cool stuff in here about sirens. I don't think that's exactly what Cas is but they kind of look alike." Sam flipped a few pages and pointed at a black and white picture to Dean. There was a male and a female half human climbed up onto a rock talking to a sailor that was hanging over the side of a boat.
Dylan huffed a laugh. He stood at the glass door, hopping from one foot to another before he psyched himself up enough to shove the door open and look both ways before darting across the street. Dean watched as he shook his long floppy hair at his mom who put her hands up in protest and shoved his shoulder playfully.
"Who the hell else would it be?" he asked with a huff. He plopped down in his recliner, setting his beer on a stack of magazines. He peeled his gloves off and stuffed them in his pockets noticing his brother eyeing his hands. "They ain't blue yet, Sammy," he grunted.
"What can I say," Michelle smiled, ashing her cigarette. "Things are going well for us. Bringing on new people--the best of the best. Dick," she waved a hand towards the men, "meet Dean Winchester."
Castiel licked his lips as he watched Dean wink. "I must say, I'm absolutely obsessed with watching you slip so easily into the lifestyle." He ran a finger along Dean's jawline. "It's fascinating."
Fifteen very loud minutes of banging around in the kitchen later, Dean sets a steaming mug of tea down in front of Rowena and parks himself across from her. He watches as she wipes away dust from the table and pulls the mug closer, blowing on the surface. He took a scalding drink, ignoring the fact that his tongue was blistering, of his coffee and closed his eyes.
"Yeah ok, good. That's good. Can't wait to see you man." He frowned slightly. He hadn't realized how much he actually missed his brother until he heard his voice. "But uh, I'll let you go---study or whatever. Good luck on your finals."
They sat there quietly eating their breakfast as the coffee bubbled. Dean watched the witch eat a forkful of eggs and moaned around the bite. He bit his lip and felt his mark pulse. Castiel looked at the familiar out of the corner of his eye before licking his lips and setting his fork down.
Dean sighed and ran a hand over his mouth. "I uh," he cleared his throat, "I was wonderin' if---could you tell me more 'bout--" He closed his eyes as his chest tightened.
"Yeah, yeah, of course, Cas. I'm just gonna be out there," he hooked a thumb over his shoulder, "researching while Crowley and Rowena are off looking for something to remove the mark. You need
The other man sighed and looked at his watch. "We really have to be going," was all he said before grabbing Deans hand and pulling him along behind him. He dragged Dean out the door and into a dark blue car that almost matched his suit. He sat down with a huff, straightening his suit jacket then nodded to to driver. He pressed a button on the door of the car and a black divider climbed it's way up to the roof of the car, leaving the men in the backseat their privacy.
"Dean!" Sam's footsteps pounded down the stairs and through the hallway until he rounded the corner into the living room. His shoulders were tense and his eyes were wild. "Why the hell aren't you answering your phone? Bobby's been tryin' to call you."
“Holy shit,” Dean gasped as he stared at his phone number under the name Zep. “HolyshitholyshitholySHIT!” He quickly pressed ‘NO’, turning to run to Castiel’s room. He opened the door and threw the phone on his bed, hearing it bounce off and land on the floor as he slammed the door.
“I can work with this,” Dean said smiling. “Why don’t you go start the fire and I’ll see what I can come up with?”
Sam stood, hauling Gabriel to his feet with him as he watched as Castiel struggled to stop his familiars attack.
Castiel dropped his wares and his arms instinctively shot out just in time for a large red tailed hawk to fall awkwardly into his arms.
Ellen beamed as she tucked the phone away under the bar. "My husband owns the only shop in town and Dean here is the best at repairing cars."
When Sam gives him a too long and too healthy grocery list and he complains that he can't, in fact, cook a goddamn thing with kale and beets.
Hey everyone! This is my first attempt at something out of the normal Destiel box. I've never written anything like this before but I have read a lot of creature Dean/Cas stories and to be honest, they're some of my favorites! I hope you enjoy :)
Sam stood there shaking, staring at his brother. "I love you, Dean. I'm sorry." He turned his back and nodded to Rowena and Eileen.
" Dean chuckled darkly. He scooped up a handful of snow and was forming a ball when he was hit in the face with a snowball. "You little shit! Get over here!" he yelled, stumbling his way towards Gabriel.
Dean grabbed one off the rack and passed it to him, then leaned a hip against the sink and crossed his arms. "Yeah man what was up with that? She
Ellen's jaw clenched as he stared at Dean. She took a deep breath and sighed, looking back towards Castiel. "Doesn't seem like anything's wrong with him, 'sides from the shedding. How long's he been talking?"
"Ain't nothin' wrong with it, really. Just has a long history s'all. No one's lived here in almost fifty years. Last owner," Bobby trailed off and glanced towards the pool house.
“Iterate interdum haec verba: Haud equidem tali me, avertam oculos meos, et vidi cum viridi caeruleo per eam!” He tossed a lit match into the bowl and it immediately erupted in a green smoke. “Dean, look.”
Dean hopped to the edge of the cell quickly and peered inside. A woman with long, matted brown hair sat in the middle of the cell. Her black frock was ripped and covered in dirt, her skin covered in bruises and caked mud. She looked up to the familiar with dark brown eyes and smiled.
Castiel stood and inspected the bin next to the fire place, pulling a blanket off an old crushed velvet couch that smelled like mothballs. A bed was pushed to the back corner next to a nightstand covered in dust.
"I don't know," Castiel confessed. "Can't feel this." He flapped his tail weakly and tried to move his fin.
There was a large bed pushed against the right side of the room covered in blue blankets and fur throws. A dusty desk sat in the corner covered in old books and loose papers. Dean walked inside the room and up to a bookshelf stuffed with wooden toys and more books. There were simple drawings of bugs and flowers pinned to the wall and a small burn mark in the center of the floor.
Dean pressed his lips together and adjusted his glasses. “You’re just a little thing aren’t ya?” He slid his pointer finger through the bars and wiggled it.
It rose slowly, inch by inch, until Dean could make out the shape. A human head was now visibly rising out of the water, ice blue eyes already open and glaring at Dean. Its black hair was covering most of its face. Mossy green scales were spattered around the cheeks and forehead. The most concerning? Its lips were curled into a snarl revealing long, sharp fangs.
"Yeah, ok." Dean turned around to the shelf and grabbed the most expensive bottle. He looked up into the mirrors behind the shelf to see Castiel's eyes raking over his body.
Dean bit his lip. “Fuck. Ok, I’m sorry,” he mumbled, tossing the book onto the bed with a sigh. “I–I found your diary–”
"Yeah, 24. No, that didn't sell worth a damn, I gotta cancel that one." Ellen eyed Dean's foot and sighed. She pulled open a drawer on her desk and pulled out a pink stinky note and handed it out to Dean. "Just a sec, Ash," she said, covering the receiver with her palm. "Just missed him," she whispered.
,” Castiel sighed. “Is that your name, little one?” Sam watched in awe as his brother nuzzled against Castiel’s chest, squawking softly.
“So,” Gabriel cleared his throat, “there wasn’t exactly a good time to introduce myself at the time. I’m Gabriel, and this is my brother Castiel.”
Castiel nodded. “That would be helpful. Not all of us have incredible eyesight at night and I’m tired of branches scratching my face.”
Dean let out a long breath and closed his eyes. "Thanks, he sighed in relief. "If you're set on staying you can take one of the rooms upstairs. I gotta go into town later and----"
Michelle leaned forward on the desk and laced her fingers. "What is so important that I needed to send away my anniversary present?"
"From what we gathered, the Novaks were hunters like us. Apparently he killed a bunch'a the covens witches and they retaliated. Long story short, the coven started a war that ended in your backyard. Them poor babies---" Bobby cleared his throat and blinked rapidly, "they killed 'em and their mamma and cursed Castiel for what he done."
Sam nodded and sat down on the bed. "It is, Cas. And I'm sorry for what I have to tell you." He took a deep breath and looked at the angel. "We put Dean in hell. In a cage." He held up his hands in defense when the angel bristled. "He's safe. He thinks he's with you. Rowena, Eileen and Crowley worked a spell to keep him in a kind of trance. He'll believe he is with you, doing----whatever it is he wants to do until we find an actual cure. He can't hurt you or anyone else while he's there. It's---it's the best of a bad situation, Cas."
“Listen, Cas. I don’t know you and you certainly don’t know me. I don’t care how long you’ve been waiting, I’m not going to be some witch’s
He heard Charlie sigh on the other end of the line. “Well maybe you need to tell him that because he’s in his room packing.”
Dean suddenly can't form words or remember how to be a functioning human, so he does the next best thing.
"Yeah? Like I said, there were these weird fuckin' carvings on the sides of the doors, wanted to make sure some kids didn't get in there and completely ruin the place with their damn graffiti. Just what I need is more work. The hell is so special about the pool? Oh, God, did someone die in there, too?" Dean covered his face and groaned into his palms.
Castiel chuckled and tore a chunk off the end of the bread and handed it to Dean. “Funny. Sam said the same about you.” He dipped his bread into his bowl and took a bite as he watched Dean smile.
Castiel dug in his pocket before pulling out a wire. "I figured," he shrugged as he handed it to Dean.
“It was never my intention to hurt you, Dean. My mission is to keep you safe but you—you’re just so—” The angel swallowed hard and stood. “I’ve healed you of your injuries. Please, Dean, go home. The war is over.”
The merchant shook her head. “No, sorry sir I haven’t. Are you—” she shook her head. “Can you feel that magic as well? I thought me and the other men were the only ones.”
"Who told ya that," Dean asked, instantly jealous. He followed Castiel into the living room and sat next to him on the couch.
Dean nodded slowly and ran a hand down his face to wipe the water away. "Yeah ok, I guess I deserved that," he chuckled. "I uh, I talked to Bobby and Ellen today. You know them, right? Surly sons'a bitches that check in on you from time to time?" Castiel hummed as he lowered his tail into the water. "They uh---told me bout what happened. With your family and everything."
Sam pressed 'END' and scrolled through his contact list, double checking anyone he may have overlooked. His finger stopped suddenly on one of the names.
Sam stopped in his tracks when he felt a blast of power ripple under his feet. He looked up to Charlie who was cowering on a branch above his head.
Dean relaxed and ran his thumb over the other mans knuckles. "Fine," he snapped. "But tone it down man, I made like five hundred bucks on a good week. He's gonna know somethin's up if you keep sending him that much."
John's eyes flew open as his grip tightened on the wheel, jerking it to the right just in time to miss an oncoming car blaring its horn. They ended up sideways in a ditch. Sammy's small body was contorted in the back, his knee had shattered through the window and was bleeding out into the white snow. John was unconscious and bleeding from a large cut in his head. Dean always thought that was the scariest day of his life.
“I’m gonna find that witch and burn her to absolute ashes,” Sam muttered, stomping down the hallway.
“Not that it’s any of your business,” Dean squared his shoulders, “but my brother is deaf. The amount of help that’s out there for kids like him is minimal.”
"Well would you look at that," Lucifer said as he walked in the room holding a crystal glass half full of whiskey. "Gabriel is home."
Hi *waves* remember me? I know, it's been like....way too fucking long right? I haven't forgotten about this story.
"So what did this guy do?" Dean asked, slinking down in his seat. The tiny Camry had nothing on the Impalas bench seat, but it didn't exactly blend in so he was forced to ride in this piece of crap.
“No plans tonight. I thought I could,” Cas cleared his throat and turned his chair towards Dean,” –I could help you study.”
"Oh so you finished the roof? No shingles then I guess." Ellen crossed her arms and leaned against the door jam.
Dean's eyebrows shot up as he looked over to Castiel. "And you thought bringing me along this year was a good idea?"
Dean's eyes flew up to Charlies. "Bullshit. No. That's---that shit's only in fairytales and stories. It can't---" He turned to Castiel who was frowning at the ground and pointed at him. "We are
Dean closed his eyes and chuckled while wiping his cheek off on his shoulder. He held the ice pick in one hand, pressing down and balled his other hand. He lifted his fist above his head and slammed it down on the ice picks handle, piercing through Alfie's finger.
"Thank you, I like it out here." Castiel smiled and stared at Dean. "You look very nice." he rubbed the back of his neck nervously as he looked down at his disheveled tie.
"Dean, you're my brother and I love you. But I can't take this anymore. I can't imagine what it's like for you, but for me, it's literal torture."
"It was gettin' pretty hot and heavy over there!" Gabriel yelled. "Thought I'd help you two cool down!"
Gabriel's head was in the blonde guys lap. He popped off and licked his lips. "I figured once I hooked you and Cassie up that'd be curtains for you. That's why I hired Max. Oh, my bad. Dean, Max. Max, Dean."
Dean tossed his keys in a ceramic bowl as he kicked his door shut behind him. His eyelids were heavy and his feet were sore. Working til three am most mornings took its toll.
“Yeah, buddy, I know. Thanks.” Dean stood up and walked over to Cas, patting his shoulder as he passed. “I’m just gonna hit the hay. Night.”
. He lowered it into the black water, still rotating it as Dean leaned in closer to watch. Nothing. Not even a speck of color could be seen.
Ignoring the ripped screen in the back door, Dean makes his way down the back steps and follows the beaten path towards the pool house. The grass is about three feet high and there's a tree the size of the Chrysler building taking up a good chunk of the yard, but he pointedly ignores all that and trudges towards the sweet promise of cool water and a much needed break.
Castiel's eyes were fully black when Dean sunk down slowly. His mouth hung open, dragging in air as he felt Dean fully seat himself on his cock. "Dean," he huffed against the man's chest, thrusting up gently. His talons sunk into Dean's back and growled.
She threw her hands up with a sigh. "Fine. Anything for you, my sweet. By the way," Rowena looked down at her shoes, "that menace of a brother owes me $875."
And goddamn if Sam said the words Dean couldn't come up with. It made him a little (ok alot) jealous that he didn't say those comforting things to Castiel, but at least someone did. He bumped his knee against Sam's and mouthed
"Rigescunt indutae!" a familiar voice called out. The ball of energy fizzled and dissipated into thin air. Olivette's jaw clenched and her eyes narrowed as she turned. Rowena stood to the side of the coven, holding her fists in front of her chest. "Don't. You. Touch. My boys," the redhead swarned.
"Wonderful," Michelle said clapping her hands together. "I've taken up enough of your time tonight, gentlemen. Walk me out."
“I can—” the mans unfairly blue eyes looked to Dean, gesturing towards the door with a dripping sleeve.
"You can't----Cas, hey, lookit me man." He reached out and tilted the creatures face towards his own. His eyes were back to their normal, ridiculously unfair blue. "You can't go around attacking people. That's my brother. He's my family."
“You cooked, I’ll clean up,” the witch said quietly before turning to his half eaten dinner. “It was delicious, by the way. Thank you.”
"What's the matter, angel," Dean raised his free hand to smooth Castiels hair. As he did so, Castiel flinched and pinched his eyes shut, waiting for the usual pain to radiate across his face.
Dean turned the lever on the tub and watched the water through hazy eyes. He mindlessly tore towels off the rack next to the medicine cabinet and tossed them on the floor, kicking them around to mop up the water. He ran a hand down his face and sighed heavily.
"So, what are you?" Dean asked as he watched water drip from the mess of hair on his head. "I mean---was that rude? Sorry, I've just never---I've never seen---" he gestured towards the creatures body.
Castiel's eyes darkened as he stepped up to Dean, their noses bumping. "And when you shoot someone? When they start bleeding out, begging you to spare their life, what then?"
"What the hell, man? They let you keep one?" Dean plucked it out of Sams hand and looked at the cover. There was an engraved symbol on the front of the book with different colored sticky tabs popping out of the book.
"Yeah, guess we should get some shut eye." Dean climbed in next to Castiel and fluffed his pillow before stuffing an arm under it with a sigh. "Far as hotel beds go, these aren't half bad." He heard Castiel hum in agreement as he shifted to his side, facing away from him. "Remember the one we stayed in when my dad took us to the Grand Canyon? God I swear I can still smell the toilet," he chuckled.
"Cas, c'mere," Sam held out his hand. "It's ok. We're just trying to help Dean. You want that right? To help him?"
Sam nodded and braced himself against the table. "He'd never admit it, but yeah no shit. Everyone knew that just by looking at them."
Dean was elbow deep in a Honda when his phone rang. He wiped his hands off on a rag before digging into his pocket.
Her gentle fingers ran over the scales on his shoulder and brushed away stray ones that were still shedding.
"In it for the long haul," Dean nodded, scratching the back of his neck. "Don't plan on making it a habit of fixing up houses here and flippin' em if that's what you're worried about."
Castiel nodded and poured himself a cup. “I have a hive out back and the queen hasn’t been letting any of the drones in, which is obviously cutting back on my honey supply. I bought everything I needed from the market the other day but wasn’t able to try and brew it yet.”
Castiel reached his hand out and gripped Dean's thigh gently. "Yes," he answered in a rumbling gargle.
“You have the most gorgeous eyes I’ve ever seen,” Lucy purred. “Gabriel, isn’t she just darling?” Charlie swallowed hard and flushed immediately.
Dean’s body flushed at the sound. His feet carried him forward, directly into Cas’ space. His fingertips skimmed across the top of the towel, dipping one inside.
“Better make that forty-five,” Dean growled, grabbing Castiels hand and dragging him out of the gym.
He wrenched the phone away from his ear as Charlie all out screamed into the receiver. "You're kidding me! Oh my God, Castiel this is just like something out of a romance novel!"
"Gabe," Dean knocked on the door before opening it. "Gotta talk to you about---Jesus fuck, Gabe! Lock the fucking door next time!" He closed the door enough that he couldn't see what was going on in the office, but open enough that he could hear his boss clearly.
Dean took the stairs two at a time up to his bedroom. He peeled off his wet pajamas and switched into a black t-shirt and jeans before bounding back down the stairs and peeking his head in to check on Castiel once more. Little bubbles popped across the surface of the water and he smiled before closing the door.
Dick leveled a look at the man and smashed his fist on the table. "Answer me honestly, Adam or so help me---"
Dean pressed his lips together and tipped his head back, sighing. "Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me," he whispered to himself.
Castiel bit the side of his cheek when Michelle rolled her eyes. He pulled a cigarette out and lit it.
The drive to Castiel's was about twenty minutes long and he'd be lying if he said he wasn't nervous. He pulled up to an enormous wrought iron gate with the initials C.N. woven into the center. There was a speaker box to the left with a red button in the center. Dean rolled down his window and pressed it.
She chuckled and patted Deans hand. "That's one word for it, I suppose. Money changes people. He wasn't always like this," she said sadly as she sniffed. "Anyway, what about you? What do you do? I'm afraid I was a tad inebriated when you first arrived," she confessed with a shy smile.
Deans gaze pulled from the floor to Castiels confused eyes. He tipped his head back and took a deep breath. "Meet cute. It's uh--it's what you tell people when they ask how we met." He reached out and tapped Cas' cheek with the pad of his finger. "That head thing you do is cute," he huffed with a grin. He turned and walked out of the room. Before the bell even chimed over the door Charlie was skipping towards Castiel. She came to a stop in front of him with her hands clasped together on her chest.
Dean shook his head and closed the door. He rounded the bar one last time to grab his jacket. Waving goodbye to Chuck, he gave the place a once over before pushing the door open and stepping out onto the sidewalk.
"Can I?" Dean asked, hesitantly moving his hand towards Cas'. When Castiel nodded, Dean pressed down lightly on his left side and slid his hand towards the middle of his body. It wasn't as thick or hard as it usually was. Where muscle used to be was now soft and fleshy. Dean gasped when his finger sunk in between where Castiel's knee should be. "Did that hurt?" Castiel shrugged and frowned. He continued trailing down his tail, feeling the scale and skin getting thinner and thinner until he reached his fin. Dean frowned when he saw the thin, tattered remains of it. "Cas, what's happening to you?"
"I said OPEN," Dean growled, shoving the blade hard against the soft spot in the angels collar bone.
After hanging out in the pool house for a while, Sam and Dean let Castiel have the place to himself while they went to eat. Castiel rolled his eyes when Dean asked him if he wanted a goldfish from the local pet store to munch on while they were out, earning him a soaked shirt.
Cassandra smiled and patted Dean’s arm. “No, I’m not. But you might after I show you what Sam and I were talking about.”
The blizzard hit suddenly after the salt and burn, leaving them little time to make their way back to the Impala. Dean, being the self proclaimed navigator, convinced Castiel to follow him into the woods.
"First of all, you aren't going," Bobby said. He rested his elbow on the table and pointed at the bathroom door. "Someone needs to stay with Castiel. He can't be left alone. The three of us'll go."
Dean turned around with a huge grin spread across his face. "Balance of Terror, man! Don't you remember watching this when I had my tonsils out? We must've seen it like--"
Once the tub was drained and refilled and the water was mopped from the floor, Dean laid out his sleeping bag next to the tub. He lifted a hand over the edge and tapped until Castiel laced his fingers through his.
Michelle kissed their cheeks and said goodnight before walking to her car. Castiel leaned against one of the large pillars and watched as she climbed into her car.
Dean scoffed and pushed his chair back before standing. “I’m serious, Sam. We met an’ it’s like— I dunno man. I’m just–I’m fucking happy for the first time. She makes me pies, for Christ sake! And she’s got this truck,” he whistled through his teeth, “she’s the whole package. Tight little–”
Sam stared at the angel in complete disbelief. "Y-yeah. Ok, Cas. Sorry. Um, I was just coming in here to get some shut eye. I'm pretty exhausted so," he gestured towards the door.
“Uh–yeah. I guess. Sure.” Dean took the offered clothing and stood there awkwardly. “Is there a place I can change or—”
Dean sulks down the hallway, confused and upset with himself. He shuts his door behind him and sat on his bed. Unfolding the top paper, he smooths over the creases and reads.
Castiel glared at Dean, holding back a shiver as he stepped into his personal space. “Nothing’s up my ass Dean,” he growled.
Castiel smiled as he looked at Dean, his cheeks red from the cold. "What?" Dean asked, still smiling from defeating Gabriel.
"Shh-shh, don't worry," Dean tugged a little harder on Castiels hair, "I'm not gonna fuck up your best friend, Cas. Just gonna ask him to stop hunting me. Politely." He walked behind the angel and dug in his pocket, pulling out a key ring.
"Poor Cassie," Charlie walked over and slumped over Cas' back, hugging him awkwardly. "Forgot about New Years?"
with him. And if you are, I'll support you one hundred percent, you know I will. But there's a lot to consider going into this."
The first time it was a mistake. Truly. Dean walked into Cas’ room looking for any laundry that needed doing. Bending over and grumbling about a ‘messy ass roommate’ not putting his clothes in the provided hamper, something caught his eye. There’s a brown leather book sticking out from under the mattress.
"M'ready. Just---let's get this over with," he mumbled. He walked over and sat back down in Cas' chair, roughly pulling the folder in front of him. He flipped the picture of his dad over and slid it to the side. There were papers detailing most aspects of what John's job entailed, the hits he was ordered to make, and a list of something called a DNH. Deans finger slid over the abbreviation.
"Dean," Castiel breathed. He ripped the door of the cage off it's hinges and walked up to Dean, cutting the restraints that held him in place.
Dean huffed and shut his door before rounding the hood of his car. "Tell whoever you're workin' for they need to learn to blend in. That kinda car sticks out like a sore thumb to guys like me." He looked Castiel in the eye and raised an eyebrow. "Government?"
Dean hummed his approval and kissed Castiel's chest lightly before lifting off Cas' lap. "Gonna need to drain this water," he grimaced. Castiel looked down and scrunched his nose.
of them," Michelle said, waving a hand in the air. "Just Alistair and his closest confidants. Adam may need to be dealt with."
The drive back was even more awkward. Castiel was obviously curious about Dean pulling away from him and Dean was trying his hardest to not stare at Cas the whole time. He sighed heavily as they pulled into the garage, thankful to be somewhere familiar.
Castiel frowned and shook his head. He pulled himself up over the ledge of the pool (Dean definitely didn't almost accidentally look at the creatures ass to see what he was workin' with. You know, for science.) and squinted his eyes as he looked out into the yard. He beamed a smile and pointed a talon towards the house as his tail swished in the pool. Dean walked over to the door and poked his head out, looking in the direction Castiel was pointing. A laugh bubbled up and out of his mouth as he nodded.
“Seriously Dean, what the hell is going on?” She pulled Dean by the arm until they were in front of the couch and made him sit. “Did you finally tell him how you feel? Did he reject you?”
Sam ran both hands down his face. "You're fucking kidding me," he whispered to himself. "It's HELL, Crowley. How can you have nothing?"
“Never what?” Dean whispered, leaning close enough to the witch’s mouth that he could feel his staggered breaths against his lips.
Dean scoffed. “You don’t even know the guy, Cas. I wouldn’t have made it if it wasn’t for him.” He rubbed the back of his neck nervously.
They whistle and cat-call to each other as someone bumps into Cas’ head from above the couch. He turns his head over his shoulder and looks up just as Ruby leans her elbows down, sinking in close enough that he can smell the alcohol on her breath.
The hell hound stood slowly, raising it’s nose and sniffing the air. It huffed and slowly approached the front of the cage.
Ellen reached down over and pulled her bag in front of her while Sam cleared her plate. "These here are witch killing bullets." She pulled out a magazine filled with silver bullets, ejected one of them and handed it to Dean. "It'll stop those bitches dead in their tracks. No comin' back from that."
He looked down to the hawk and frowned, petting his head softly. “Yes. I—” the light in his eyes softened until it was completely gone. “I felt something–pulling inside me. I felt sick and then,” he smiled fondly as he ran a finger through the birds feathers. “He found me.” He looked up to Sam with sad eyes. “I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. I never wanted to hurt—”
to stretch my legs. I can barely stand up in here and my knees are sore from kneeling. Would you mind coming closer?”
He felt something run across his cheek. It was warm and soft as it traced down his jawline. He leaned into the touch, sighing as he pinched his eyes shut. He could feel Castiel's breath on his face as his body involuntarily moved him forward.
She leads the way up the front steps (well, step) and carefully maneuvers around the holes that have rotted through the porch. The front door groans in protest as it's forced open and she steps inside with a sigh. "Home sweet home," she smiles, holding out her coffee cup hand and gestures to the front room.
Dean nodded along, still watching the couple across the street. "Then she touched your cheek, it turned blue and you lived happily ever after," Dean bobbed his head back and forth, rolling his eyes. Bobby smacked him upside the head and clicked his tongue.
“About yesterday,” he rubbed the back of his head nervously. “I uh, don’t know why I freaked out like that. M’sorry.”
Dean let his hand drop to his side with a slap, looking down at the creature. His hair was disheveled and there were bruises forming where Sam had his fingers dug into his shoulders
An amused grunt rumbled in the creatures chest as he glanced at Dean out of the corner of his eye. He seemed to think about his answer before raising a hand to his throat. Two long fingers tapped the dip between his collar bones as he frowned.
The man looked over to Dean, his eyes sparkling in the neon lights. "Could you---I don't want to bother you. I could always wait until morning but---"
Sam rolled his eyes and patted his leg, gesturing for Charlie to follow him. “He’d eat you alive, like most of his food,” he joked. Charlie trotted along side her witch as they started to leave the market.
He pulled his phone out from under his pillow and prayed to whoever was listening that he got cell service all the way out here. He punched his address into Google and wiggled his leg in anticipation as the page slowly loaded.
"Actually," Dean craned his head back and rested it on the couch, looking up at Castiel, "I was interrogating him," he confessed with a smile.
Castiel nodded, not able to form words yet. He'd seen Dean like this many times, but not recently. His eyes roamed over Dean's tanned skin, the small scar on his left hipbone from when they were climbing over a barbed wire fence when they were 14.
Without thinking, he reached up and pulled Gabriel in by the back of his neck. Craning his head, he turned around and kissed the angel. His tongue swept over Gabriels lower lip, causing him to groan.
Castiel tilted his head, eyebrows pulling together. "Of course." He held up his hand for Dean to lead the way.
Dean whipped his head around to see his brother waving from across the room, Charlie hopping up and down next to him.
Castiel moved close to Dean, keeping his hands firmly planted on his thighs. "Look at me, Dean." He lowered his head and caught Dean's eye line with a stern look on his face. "I get to decide who I waste my time with, just like you get to decide who to touch and who touches you. I don't care about the gloves, I don't care if I ever find my soulmate. I like you, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you like me too."
“Damn it, Cas, just stop!” Dean took two more steps. “I—I need you, ok? I’ve always fucking needed you.” He reached the step just below the one Castiel was on, reaching out his hand to grab the angels. He held it gently and rubbed circles with his thumb on the Castiels palm. “M’no good at this, but I can’t lose ya, Cas.”
Castiel led Dean through a small woven curtain into a carved out hole in the back of the hut. There were shelves dug into the walls and a small rug laying in the back.
He watched as Castiel seemed to contemplate his offer, looking around the pool at the leaves and gunk that had built up over the years. With a smile, Castiel nodded his head. "Really? Oh man, Cas, you're gonna love it." Dean stood and walked over to the pump and kicked it into the water. "Wait." Dean turned and faced Castiel with a worried look. "Can you survive without bein' in water for a while? I don't---I have no idea how that works. The pool will be empty for a while before I can fill it."
Dean opened his mouth but was interrupted. “Let’s not bombard him with questions,” Chuck said as he ran a hand through his hair. “He probably was just too far away from Castiel, right?”
They didn't get to talk. After Dean had the single most amazing orgasm of his life, Gabriel knocked on their door and demanded that they meet him downstairs to "Check out Lucy's fucked up face".
The light dissipated as Castiel turned to the hawk and gently picked it up, cradling it against his chest. “It’s alright little one, I have you.”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Kinda sounds like a wedding ceremony. I’m uh, I just met your son. Don’t think I’m ready to tie the knot just yet.”
to you, the first person in over fifty years including myself. He began losing his scales and his shimmer after your first---what shall we call it?---romantic interaction. Not to mention his fin and then his entire tail completely dissolved overnight. Come now, Dean. I know you're more than just a pretty face. Use that brain of yours and tell me why the curse lifted as soon as you came into the picture."
Her eyes sparkled as she looked him up and down. "Dean," she hummed, "hope to see you around more often." She left her beer on the bar as she slid off the seat and sauntered away.
Dean sat up in his makeshift bed and scrubbed his hands over the stubble on his face. Bobby's words still rang in his head along with the storm.
"Your man, huh?" Castiel pressed himself tight against Dean's side. He snaked his arm up Deans chest and ran his fingers through his friends hair.
vaguely wondering if the movie was based on a true fucking story. The creature watched Dean intently as it lowered its hand back into the water.
Castiel took a step forward and raised his hands. “My name is Castiel. That’s my brother Gabriel,” he tilted his head towards his half asleep brother.
The sound is wonderful and makes Castiel smile wide. “Truthfully, I’m not sure they even work. But it was worth a shot.”
The old gym was decorated in streamers and disco balls. Laser lights cast different geometric shapes against the walls and pulsed in time with the horrible music blasting from the DJ booth on stage.
"I'm surprised Castiel let you out of his sight, let alone going to the Romans' alone." Michelle swirled her glass and glanced at Castiel out of the corner of her eye. "Tell me, Dean, who gave you permission to set up a meeting with Dick?"
"I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke in here," Dick said, coming around to sit in his chair. "Michelle has some leeway here but I assure you, Dean Winchester, you do not."
"Dean stop pacing," Castiel picked at his blanket absentmindedly. "If--if you're so worried about it, why don't," he swallowed hard as the words stuck in his throat. "You should come with me."
"Not at all, just getting settled in." Dean rose from the bed and stuck out his hand. "I'm Dean, Cas' boyfriend."
Castiel bit his lip and smiled. Dean watched as his teeth slid across it leaving it slick and slightly redder. “I did,” he confessed with a grin. Their faces were close in this position. Castiel could see the freckles spattered over the familiars nose and cheeks. He wanted to count every single one of them. They started to flush which just made them even more beautiful.
Dean pulled out and stuffed himself back into his jeans. Castiel closed his eyes and slumped back, wincing when his knees popped. The gag shifted around his neck and he let out a small sob.
"Oh, Dean," Castiel sighed. Dean felt Castiel's fingers rake through his hair as he let out a sigh. He leaned into the touch, a completely brand new sensation. "Open your eyes."
"I understand, Sam. I think---I think I need to be alone for a while. I'll contact you if I find anything of import."
There was a loud crash and screaming from the next room. The sounds of metal-on-metal and bodies being dropped to the floor.
“Happy New Year, Sam,” Castiel smiled, clinking his bottle against Sams. He turned to Dean who was already chugging his drink and watched as it dribbled down his chin.
Gravel flew as he pulled into the parking lot and skidded to a stop. He burst through the doors, glancing around before heading straight past the bar and into the kitchen.
Castiel ran a hand through his hair before he knocked on Dean's door. He shifted a six pack in one arm as he tried to balance a large box of pastries on top of it. The door flew open just as the box started to slide off.
"Goddamn it boy if you don't clean your shit up I'ma kick your skinny ass," Bobby complained. He huffed as he bent over and picked up the crust and tossed it into the garbage can. "The hell's the matter with you today?" He scratched the side of his face where a blue hand print was burned into his skin.
"Would you get the fuck outta here? I'm tryin' to get tips and you're scarin' off all the customers with your weird ass." Dean flicked the wet rag at the other man and ushered him out from behind the bar.
"Gods, Castiel," Dean panted. Reaching up, Dean let his hand trace over Castiel's bonding mark. It's magic floated out and intertwined with his fingers, sending shock waves down his arm.
Sam and Charlie quickly followed the merchants directions. He’d heard of a man living in the woods but people rarely saw him. He was rumored to have the purest form of magic in his bloodline, but that was most likely just stories made up by children.
“After the coalescence ceremony we are to stay in the castle for one week. It’s tradition. Everything we will need is provided.” Castiel gave Dean an apologetic look. “Of course we can tell father we can’t stay—”
“So, Castiel wasn’t with you when we met at the gates. Does that mean you can be further apart now?” Sam set little glass bottles on the table and held out his hand for Charlie to hand him the other bag.
Dean parked Baby outside the garage and sat in the car for a long time. He surveyed the land carefully and looked in all the windows for any movement behind them before actually getting out of the car. All the information he learned last night (this morning) was still swimming in his head, making him cautious about entering his own damn house. Well, not the house specifically.
"C-Cas, I c-can't feel my fingers." Dean's teeth chattered so hard they felt like they were going to crack. He stuffed his hands under his armpits and hugged himself tight, squinting his eyes as his face was pelted with snow.
Castiel's hands lowered into the water and grazed his hips and thighs down to where his knees would be. "It aches."
Castiel’s breath caught in his throat as their lips crashed together for the first time. He gripped Dean by the back of the neck and pulled him in closer, drinking in his power.
“Jesus you feel that, Mr. Winchester?” The teenager with a Nirvana t-shirt stopped strumming and looked up at the blinking lights.
the curse. The newspapers called it a cult, but what really happened was a coven of witches killed the Novaks and cursed Castiel. Turned him into what you saw today."
His heart pounded in his chest as he waited for a reply. He wiped a hand over his mouth and jiggled his foot on the floor board.
fucking hard to block out what he remembers of Hell, but that's something he just can't do. Can't cut it out with a knife or cover it in salt and incinerate it. His mind conjures up shit that would make a lesser man want to be locked up in a padded room for the rest of his life. He hopes the nightmares are just things he's made up. That he didn't actually use a razor blade to pop off each and every fingernail of a politician. That he didn't carve out a serial killers lung and feed it to him. And that's just the light stuff. The other stuff...he can't bring himself to admit. He just can't. He can barely live with himself as it is.
Castiel's blue eyes were rimmed with red and watering. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry you're involved in this."
Max hooked his chin over his shoulder and smiled, batting his lashes. "Thanks for the job," he winked before gripping Gabriel's hair and shoving his head back down.
family rips yours apart, just like you did mine." Olivette squirmed against him and tried to scream, only to have her windpipe close off by Castiel's fingertips.
"Alright," Dean grunted as he stood, looking back at Castiel who nodded. Dean plucked the ice pick out of the man's finger and placed it on his ring finger in the same spot. Fist raised, he started swinging it down.
Castiel's breath hitched in his throat as he ran a hand through Dean's sweat soaked hair. "You didn't. This has nothing to do with you, I promise. Everything will be ok." He shifted under Dean's weight and pulled him upright, grimacing when Dean let out a pained moan. He cradled Dean's head in his hands and softly kissed his split lip before resting their foreheads together.
“No,” Castiel said sternly. He had his backpack on with a duffle bag in his hand. He brushed past Dean, knocking his shoulder in the process.
“Yeah, poor thing. That’s before she knew I was gay. Once that cat was out of the bag we became best friends. Can’t seem to get rid of her,” Castiel said loudly, looking over his shoulder.
Castiel placed his hands on Dean's and gripped them lightly to stop his rambling. "Dean, it doesn't hurt," he assured him. He pulled Dean forward so he was seated on his lap. "I promise," he whispered before running his hands through Dean's hair and guided him in for a kiss. Dean's breath caught in his throat when he felt Castiel's tongue glide over his bottom lip.
"I've been doin' this for what, a week? Cas, I got no idea what to do here. I'm just along for the ride. Where you go, I go." Dean sipped his coffee and watched Castiel's face drop. "What," Dean cocked his head. "What'd I say?"
Dean blinked and nodded quickly. "Yeah, no totally. I get it. I uh--" he hooked a thumb over his shoulder and narrowed his eyes, "I'll let you get dressed." He walked out of the bathroom and sat on the bed with his head in his hands. "What the
Dean frowned as he counted out the money. “Shower. And he ain’t my lover boy.” He took the boxes and handed her the money.
Sam smiled at the blond witch before turning to his brother. “Castiel, I can—I’ll try to talk to him. Dean is—he’s complicated.”
“Dean,” Castiel said quietly, “I would never mistreat you. I’d be honored if you were my familiar. I’ve been waiting so long—”
be a serial killer on the loose judging by the shriek that came out of his mouth. Dean likes thinking back on those days. When he's stressed out he can see it so clearly in his mind, almost feel the cool water from the lake drying on his overheated skin. It's his happy place.
“I’ve been away for so long that I forgot.” He looked at Dean with his eyebrows knit together. “This is our coalescence ceremony.”
Castiel snorted. “I’ve never wanted to live like that. Michael and Anna took their money as soon as they turned sixteen and left.” He turned to Dean, his expression very serious. “Did you know I made this hut by hand? Everything in here,” he gestured vaguely. “I dug the root cellar with my bare hands and carved the wood for shelves myself.”
"Did I hurt you?" Dean asked, watching Cas' knuckles grow white. Castiel shook his head and let out a long breath, leaning back into the touch. His hair was brushing against Dean's cheek now, tiny droplets of water transferring to the mans two day stubble. Dean grinned and dug his fingers into the side of Cas' neck, eliciting a groan from the creature. "Feel good?" Dean whispered, leaning forward so his breath ghosted across Castiel's ear. Panic and excitement ricocheted inside Dean's veins as he felt Castiel nod and lay his other hand against the nape of his neck, sending water trickling down the back of his shirt. Talons pressed ever so slightly against his flushed skin as he continued working harder over Castiel's muscular back, lowering his hands until they were sunk below the water.
Shaking his head, Castiel looked down and tapped the tip of his skate into the ice. "Nothing, I just---" he looked up into Dean's eyes and realized he was seconds away from saying something he knew he shouldn't.
"Respect is earned," Dean simply stated. "Alistair is going to overthrow you and your whole operation. He started with Alfie, getting mass amounts of weapons from a kid who was too scared to stand up for himself and the family. Now we're down resources and money. I'm having a hard time believing you'd be ok with something like that. Alistair on the other hand--" Dean trailed off, shrugging.
"No I don't suppose you would. She left when we were in second grade." His memory was flooded with memories of the day Naomi made her grand exit. She revealed on Christmas Eve that she was leaving Lebanon, and her entire family, for a man in New York. They'd met on one of her many work trips and had been seeing each other for over a year. Castiel shuddered at the memory of his father smashing every dish in the house as Naomi packed her things. "She's very direct. Not one to beat around the bush with sensitive subjects." He shifted in his seat, turning slightly towards Dean. "She'll want to know everything about you, and I'm warning you now, if you don't have some sort of doctorate or degree she will be utterly disappointed."
He removed his fingers and stroked his own cock a few times before lining up to Dean. He pushed inside with a grunt, setting a hard and fast rhythm.
“She killed herself because of what father did to me. She couldn’t bear knowing her daughter was just below her feet and not do something about it. And then the only person I ever cared about left.”
"Point is, love comes outta nowhere son, and when you least expect it." Bobby braced his hands on his knees and pushed himself off the couch. "Give this Cas-teal a chance."
Castiel skated up to Dean as he watched his mother and brother fly around the corner together. "So?"
The witch nodded and walked up to a shabby table and began setting out her supplies. Eileen rubbed Sam's back gently before joining the witch, laying her book out on the table and leafing through the pages.
Dean felt the creatures breath hitch as his wandering fingers pressed where skin met scale at Castiel's hips. His grip tightened on Dean's neck and a low moan filled the bathroom.
Castiel’s eyes flamed with power as he watched Dean struggle to say above the ground. He ran towards his sister with a hand outreached. Orange magic poured from his palm and reached to the witch, leaping over the growing crevasse.
Dean licked and sucked gently at the witch’s neck as his arm wrapped tightly around Cas’ waist, pulling him onto his lap. He rutted his growing erection into the witch’s ass and bit down harder.
"Really wish you could talk," Dean sighed. "Ok, uh, sandwiches?" Castiel shook his head. "Pizza?" That earned him an eye roll. "Ok, well what about a nice juicy fish?" If looks could kill, Dean would be pushing daisies or more accurately, drown in a tub. He barked a laugh and raised his hands in surrender. "Alright, I guess you don't eat. I'm gonna go back to work. Just---splash if you need anything alright?"
Castiel thanked a waiter after taking two flutes of champagne off his silver tray. "My boss." He handed Dean a glass and clinked his against it in a small 'cheers'. "Technically," he said after swallowing, "my boss' boss' boss."
"Fucking stop, Castiel!" He gripped the creatures face and held it tight, staring into his black unfocused eyes. "It's Sam! My brother! He isn't going to hurt you but I will if you don't back the fuck off!"
"Ah. Got another one, huh?" Bobby sat down with a groan next to Dean and eyed his gloves. "Y'know, might be easier to find someone if you took those damn things off."
"This ain't funny, Cas!" he yelled. "I'll do it! I'll come out there naked as hell! Who's gonna want to eat with all this," Dean shook his lower half in the water, making it swirl and splash, "hangin' out?"
Gabriel coughed and spit blood on the demons shoes. He grinned wide, showing off his red stained teeth before letting out a sigh.
Dean felt himself moving closer to the witch. He finished his glass and reached over with a questioning look.
"Right. Ok. One thing at a time," Dean hisses to the bird. He turns on his heel and marches out of the pool house, slamming the door behind him.
(If I haven't made it clear, Cas knows and has grown up with Dean's family. Dean has had limited contact with Cas' side)
He opened his eyes slowly, focusing on Castiel's blue eyes and his flushed cheeks. He watched as Castiel lowered his eyes to his chest, moving his shirt out of the way.
Dean shot him a glare and turned his attention to a customer at the bar. "What can I ge--" The words got caught in his throat when he looked at the man in front of him.
Castiel groaned loudly, gripping Dean roughly on either side of his neck and digging his fingers into the tender skin there. He pulled Dean off his lips and bit down the mans jaw, sucking little red marks along the way. Dean gripped Cas' jacket tight, panting and moaning as the other man assaulted his neck.
Dean licked his lips and sat up slightly. He picked up Cas' hand with his still gloved hand and hovered it over his heart. Castiel smiled as he scooted up so Dean was sitting on his lap.
Together, they turned down the path that lead home. Dean stopped abruptly and looked down at Charlie. “Wait—did you say he was petting me?!”
Dean piled their bowls full and carried them over to the couch, placing one in front of the witch. “Your brother seems like a piece of work,” he said before taking a bite.
"I wouldn't miss it," Castiel answered, turning his head over his shoulder. Dean smiled brightly and offered a small wave as he headed out the door. The little bell chimed as he watched Dean jog across the street to Bobby's shop. He sighed as he poured himself a styrofoam cup of tea.
Dean shrugged. "You're off to a good start." He grabbed a waffle and bit into it, ripping it in half.
Castiel lifted the other mans chin so they were eye level. "No, never actually." He slid his finger off the tip of Deans chin and reached for his glass, never breaking eye contact. "I have a vested interest in you, Dean. You make me---," he shook his head with a grin before swallowing the rest of his drink. He cleared his throat and stood up, pulling out his wallet.
Castiel bit back a smile and lowered his gaze from the mirror. “And to think, a few days ago you were dead set on not being my familiar.”
Castiel raised an eyebrow and cocked his head, looking over to Dean. "Yes, practice makes perfect, wouldn't you say Dean?"
Castiel chucked as he ran the towel over his hair, cocking his head to the side and baring his neck. He shivered as he ran the damp towel over his chest, scrubbing it gently.
Sam said journaling would help me with conflicting feelings about becoming human. Now that I don’t have my wings or powers, things are very uncomfortable.”
And that's where he finds himself now. Standing outside the worse-for-wear home he's sinking his life savings (and every loan he can possibly get his hands on) into, waiting for the pretty real estate agent with the sparkling brown eyes. The photos didn't do the place justice- it's even more terrible in person, but Dean can see the potential in it. With a coat of paint, some new carpet, and about a million other tweaks, it could pass as livable. Probably. Maybe.
His voice quiet and a little breathless from running down the hallway. His heart pounding. The last two weeks led up to this important moment.
Castiel pulled his eyebrows together. “Why does a new year mean you have to start doing something new? Why can’t you just—start doing it any day you want?”
associates, Michelle?" he interrupted, turning his head over to scoff at Michelle. The other men at the table snickered as they watched Dean stuff his hands into his pockets.
“Yep. Try living with her,” Castiel sighed. “So, you in town for a while or just the night,” he asked while dumping the ice in a tub.
Castiel flopped down on the couch and pulled a pillow under his head. “I’ll make you a perch tomorrow,” he muttered into the pillow.
"That's exactly what I told him," Dean chuckled then hissed when her fingers prodded a little too hard.
“Dean, sorry for the surprise. I thought Castiel would have remembered the coalescence tradition. I hope we didn’t overwhelm you.”
week, not next. Do you not understand what I'll do to you if----good. Glad were finally on the same page."
Dean woke up to the smell of coffee and the sun shining through the yellow motel curtains. He stretched his arms over his head and groaned, smiling to himself. Whenever Cas woke up first, which was almost always, he'd have coffee ready. Dean is half convinced that's why he started a bakery/coffee shop. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and rubbed at his eyes when his mind was flooded with memories of last night. He smiled and ran his hand down his face before standing up.
