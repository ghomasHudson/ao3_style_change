Slow and sure, Dean sank down onto Cas, letting the other man fill him bit by bit. It took a few passes, going deeper each time until Cas was buried to the hilt. Both of them let out a sigh mixed with a groan and Dean finally opened his eyes. He looked down at Cas beneath him and liked what he saw.
“You could say I’m feeling lazy now.”
When the pilot didn’t pull his hand away, Dean risked a sidelong glance at him and saw the slight curve of a smile on Novak’s lips. The smile was followed by the brush of his fingers against the back of Dean’s hand and Dean smiled in return. He wasn’t misreading. Subtlety was a necessity for men like them, especially in the armed forces, where being caught out could get you a dishonorable discharge.
“Yes,” Sam said after a drink of water. “I just started last year. It’s been great so far.”
“I train those who want to fly how to keep themselves alive.” Castiel said with a tilt of his head, his eyes unfocused, as if seeing past the people on the street.
Unfortunately, all the festivities of the day were marred by more bad news. They weren’t going to get out of October without another casualty of war. Near Iceland again, another US destroyer was attacked, the
Benny’s eyes turned back to Dean for confirmation. Cas never mentioned what his living quarters on the ship were like, so he just shrugged. “Beats me.”
Hitching one of Castiel’s legs up over his shoulder and urging the other leg to the side, Dean settled on his knees between them as he started to bob his head, taking Castiel’s cock into his mouth over and over again. He kept one hand wrapped possessively around the thigh at his shoulder and the other hand pressed against Cas’s pelvis, holding him against the bed.
Anna laughed and pointed at the photograph in Cas’s hand. “Wouldn’t mind if he looked like Dean! Say, do you think he’s interested in girls, too?”
Dean shrugged, “I know, but you said you liked those.”
“Thinkin’ you two might want to shut your mouths before I shut ‘em for you,” Dean waved a fist at them, though everyone knew it was an empty threat.
When the trail ran out, it diverged on a path towards one last beach or back towards the city. Nearly two hours had passed on their leisurely walk after they left first beach and the sun was beating down from the middle of the sky. With no hope of shade, the pair took refuge in a restaurant for lunch. Over a light meal, they shared stories from training. Dean talked about the trouble Ash got into trying to sneak beers when he wasn’t allowed. Castiel spoke of missions with his squadron and tricks Gabriel liked to pull in the air. Though Cas wasn’t overly expressive, the small, fond smile he wore when talking about the men he flew with was ever present. It might have made Dean the slightest bit jealous if the entire meal hadn’t been coupled with the not-exactly-accidental colliding of their feet beneath the table.
“There’s a trail here, they call it the Lakefront Trail, it begins here at Navy Pier and goes on for miles north.” Castiel explained.
“Do Lieutenants?”
“Late Monday morning. It’s a long ride to California from here and Hawaii is a long way off the coast, as well.”
“I’ll be sure to keep an eye out for news reports of a wayward girl on a crime spree in Kansas City or Topeka,” Dean teased.
“I don’t believe that. Sam is certainly very bright. He got into law school, but you’re no fool, Dean.”
“I suppose. I haven’t got any problem with teaching, I just--”
“Then expect me to lament my bed at home for about a month’s worth of letters.” Dean smirked at Cas.
He let the rumors circulate, because it was easier to let people assume he was a playboy than to try to convince them otherwise and risk being caught in his real secret. It was nice to be himself with at least one person, and even though he played at being annoyed by the questioning; it was the one moment he could be like any other guy.
Negotiations were over. Any proposal offered by Japan was declined. The Japanese government had set a deadline for November 29th and if nothing was settled by then, things were going to happen. The government knew that war was imminent, and they would be drawn into battle within a matter of days. An attack by Japan was assumed, but no one knew where or when it would happen.
He sat down on the edge of his bed and just admired the look of Dean’s face. His hard jawline, his open and friendly smile. The black and white photo didn’t really do him justice, seeing the color of his eyes or hair or lips might have helped more, too. Sighing, Cas fell back on his bed and closed his eyes. The both of them would need to get a grip and fast if they were going to survive being separated. Other men and women managed, they could, too. The only problem was, other men and women were allowed to be open about missing each other.
Opening his eyes, Castiel saw the relaxed and happy look Dean wore and kissed his cheek, then his temple and his brow. The kisses were soft and tender and made Dean tighten his hold on Castiel once more. Hands started at the small of Cas’s back and eased their way up his body. When they reached the backs of the pilot’s shoulders, Dean on held firmly, tipped his head and kissed Castiel. The kiss was deep and slow and all consuming. He rolled Castiel onto his back, keeping their bodies closely slotted together.
He looked up at her. “Yes. I love it, thank you.”
“The feeling is mutual,” Cas laughed. The signal was spotty at best, considering how far it had to travel between them. Dean’s voice crackled over the line and surely his did the same, but it was better than a letter, and the next best thing to being in person. “I hadn’t realized how much...”
“Damn, Cas...” Dean breathed out, barely above a whisper, despite not needing to be quiet. He circled a thumb over one of Cas’s nipples.
As these thoughts ran through Castiel’s head, he couldn’t help but wonder when he became so poetic -- and a bad poet, at that. Then he wondered if this is what love did to a man, if these wistful, youthful thoughts that he would never think of saying aloud could be attributed to love? And if so, did that mean he was in love with Dean Winchester? And was Dean in love with him?
The mood shifted as the pair left Cas’s bedroom and went down to meet one or both of their parents. It was time to put on the show as good, obedient children. The irony of their lives was that, despite being constantly taught to behave, Anna and Cas both grew up wanting to break the rules their parents and society made for them. One day their parents would understand that Anna didn’t want to grow up to be a housewife taking care of the manor and Cas wouldn’t grow up to marry some pretty young woman he met on shore leave, but for now they smiled and did their duty.
“No, but I think she hopes to change that somehow.”
“On occasion.”
“He’s farther away.”
She shrugged, looking bashful for once. “It isn’t much but I thought you might appreciate the effort. And hey, maybe you’ll get a change soon.”
“I guess Lawrence has always felt like home to me... I don’t know if I want to live all my life here, though. I guess I haven’t spent much time thinking about the future, you know? Just have to get through each day and see where the wind takes you.”
“No, just on the ship. Carriers have just about everything you need on them, including doctors, dentists, barbers. We even have a small shop or two with petty things like candy and cigarettes.”
“Well, it ain’t all sunshine and roses,” Dean reminded him. “But I think I get what you’re saying.”
Cas smiled fondly and set the letter aside. He got up from his desk and rifled through his belongings until he found the half torn photo strip with the two pictures of himself and Dean. He didn’t take it out too often and it was still crisp and flat, just raggedy along the bottom edge where it had been torn. For the first time since they had the pictures taken, Cas wished he had given Dean the top half and kept the bottom half with their kiss for himself. Maybe one day they could find another photobooth and take the pictures over again. It would be nice to have another one.
“So, go ask her to dance.” Ash nudged him.
“Damn, it’s cold tonight!”
John looked up, “That time?”
“This certainly has nothing to do with you fancying Errol Flynn...” Castiel gave him a sly grin.
“Gorgeous, sexy, beautiful,” were among the words Dean used. Had they come from anyone else, Castiel might have balked at the choices. From Dean, they were meaningful, they were real and honest, because he believed them to be true. From Dean, the words had power. In that moment, Castiel would have given him anything. Shocking as it was, Castiel knew it was true. And he said the only word as powerful and as meaningful as he could think of.
“Then we must, I suppose,” Castiel shrugged helplessly.
“Nah, Benny’s already taken. He’s head over heels for a gal named Andrea. And I’m taken, too. By a fantastic guy named Cas.”
“Yeah, and this has been good. I’m glad I could visit.”
“Frightened how?” Jo tilted her head to the side.
“Cary Grant,” Dean repeated, a smile on his face. That’s the one. I get to be Cary Grant.”
“No, I have a better idea for candy after the movie.” Though Dean gave him a curious look, Castiel didn’t explain. “Just popcorn for now.”
Landing a new plane wasn’t much different from any other plane, on most occasions. Cas came around and looked for the Landing Signal Officer -- another pilot, dressed in white, standing where he could be easily seen with flags in hand -- to tell him that he was cleared for landing. It was the LSO’s job to let pilots know if they were on the right trajectory to land properly, since the margin of error was very, very small.
The man glanced between the two of them, then pointed down the road, “Down two blocks that way, then hook a right, another three blocks and you should find it.”
Dean stroked a hand over Cas’s back as he rode his own climax out. They were both sweaty and out of breath when they finally laid back down. Dean carefully lifted himself up, off of Cas and settled back down at his side. His legs felt weak and wobbly and his arms heavy, but Dean felt better than he had in years.
“He had rather high expectations, yes.”
“Are we still speaking of the same thing?” Cas slid his hands around Dean’s waist, letting one travel up his back.
“I’m alright,” Gabe replied and Cas could tell he wore his mischievous grin as he said it.
“Dean, great.” The smile in Castiel’s voice was clear through the phone. “Which hotel?”
“Dean, I have to go.”
“Do you think it will happen? That we will go to war?” His family had been asking at home, but Dean had no answers for them.
“Typically, it’s considered a compliment to be asked to train, because they want the new pilots to learn from the best.”
Dean waited, rocking on his feet, nodding his head and chewing on his lip. He glanced around the hotel lobby, tapped his finger against the phone and waited. He took a slow breath, tried to remain calm, and waited.
“Well, last I heard she was wanting to join the navy as a pilot, because she knows how to fly and doesn’t think it’s right that girls can’t serve.”
“To Sam and Jessica.” They all toasted their glasses and drank. Sam wrapped his arm around Jess, who kept staring at her ring and smiling like everything in her world was perfect. And right now, it was. Right now, everything was perfect for all of them, a happy Christmas feast, rounded out with the proposal everyone was waiting for. And though Cas couldn’t be here to share it with them, just knowing that he was out there somewhere, and knowing that something real existed between them was enough.
“Eh, I might be a wise ass, but Sammy got all the smart genes.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded in agreement.
“We’ve been through worse.” Cas observed.
“Oh, you think I’m kidding?” he asked, flashing a grin even as he rocked back from that shove.
“The wrong impression?”
Time passed slowly but surely. While Cas stayed in Virginia, he managed to convince his mother to let Anna visit while she had a break from school. They spent time sightseeing and catching up on each other’s life. She was quite taken with the idea of Cas visiting Dean’s family for the wedding. Many jokes were made about him “meeting the parents.” Although he insisted that it wasn’t like that, she wouldn’t relent.
Releasing a held breath, Cas relaxed as both hands went to the controls and he turned the plane to the side. A smile spread across his face as he looked out over the open ocean. Not much beat that view. Though there wasn’t much to see except water, nothing near as breathtaking as the Grand Canyon or a mountain range, there was something nostalgic about being out over the water in a plane, and Cas liked that.
“Yeah, but why?”
So instead, he folded the letter, still shaking his head, and put it in the envelope, addressed it to Castiel and put it into his trunk at the end of the bed. Tomorrow he would mail it off.
“What?”
“I-- He’s...” Dean flustered and clenched his teeth for a moment. “I’m not gonna-- He’s nice to be around, okay? He’s good looking and kinda different.”
“Like the view, soldier?” Castiel wiped his razor on a cloth and glanced over his shoulder at Dean, before drawing the blade carefully over his chin again.
“Or were the captain, maybe.”
“You have a photograph of him?” Anna’s eyes went wide with excitement, her smile grew double in size.
“Lieutenant Novak.”
“Well, it was good to be here, you know I always miss you guys.”
“Yes!” Cas beamed a smile. “It is wonderful to not have biplanes anymore. Not that I get to go back to sea for a bit.”
“Come then,” Castiel began, going in to kiss him.
There was something maddening about Dean. He always wanted to answer the man’s call, to be there with him. Thinking about his face, his smile, his hands or body made everything worse. Cas
Cas considered that and how to respond. Luckily, their meal arrived and he didn’t have to speak right away. They thanked their waitress for the food and then began eating. Anna stared at Cas as she chewed and he took his time.
“‘Til then...” Castiel responded, wishing he could reach out to Dean one last time. Instead, he held tight to the half strip of photographs and prayed for the best. Only once Dean was out of sight did he enter the train station, to wait for his train to come in. He would write, Castiel decided and he hoped Dean would as well. There was something there, something between them. Perhaps it was fate, or perhaps it was something as foolish as love at first sight. Castiel didn’t know, nor did he especially care to figure it out. He just didn’t want to let it go.
“I see,” Cas nodded, wondering if trying to balance John’s questions against Mary’s wishes would be a challenge. “Please, ask what you want to know. And you’re all welcome to call me Cas.”
After the vows were exchanged, Dean handed Sam the ring and he placed it on Jessica’s finger. Her hand trembled slightly and she laughed and then they were told to kiss. Sam brought both his hands up to hold Jess’s face, then kissed her sweetly. They smiled together, then turned to face their guests. Everyone clapped and a few cheered as the pianist began playing music and the newly wed couple made their way back up the aisle. Dean and Jessica’s cousin came together and followed them out. As he walked past, Dean smiled at the people he knew on the groom’s side. When he caught sight of Cas, he winked, smiled broadly, and then looked forward as he walked out.
“I do insist.” Cas glanced away, it was fun making him shy like this. “So what else?”
Shaking these dire thoughts from his head, Cas read over Dean’s letter again. He got caught up on the line about Ozzie Nelson and stopped, not sure what song Dean was talking about. He would have been a teenager in the early ‘30s, but Cas was already well into military training by then. He set Dean’s letter aside, hidden safely away in his desk, and left his small apartment on the base to go find some of the other folks in the recreational areas.
“Well, I don’t imagine you and I could both find excuses to surprise him in North Carolina.”
Castiel was undone shamefully quick, reduced to short, panting breaths at the expertly fast way Dean was sucking him. He presumed the soldier was used to clandestine sexual acts up against walls in the shadowy alleys of nearby clubs. Quick was the way of it in those cases, as much pleasure as one could get before being caught. There was something thrilling about it all, the frisson of excitement that spread through a man’s body could heighten the pleasure and even become addictive. Castiel was no stranger to those activities in his teenage years.
“Getting a bit routine, huh?” Gabe laughed. “These storms are getting a bit too routine for my tastes.”
“Yes,” Castiel nodded and smiled fondly. “She was complaining recently about how it is unfair that women can’t enlist.”
“I’ve got quite the desire to bathe and you seem to have gotten lazy during your week away from training,” Castiel teased over his shoulder as he strolled, unabashedly buck naked, towards the bathroom.
“Oh yeah, Benny, how’s Andrea doing?” Dean figured changing the subject to someone else’s love life was safer.
“Goodnight, Dean.” He murmured into the man’s bare chest.
“I’m glad you’re here...” Dean admitted, whispering into Cas’s collarbone.
“Think you’ll ever tell them?” Dean toyed with the phone cord.
“Nah, I’m probably going to turn in about now, I have to be up pretty early tomorrow.”
“But does it stop you from taking off?”
“We have to be quiet,” Dean whispered.
The tender, an older fellow -- probably too old to serve in the armed forces -- poured the drink and set it on the counter for Dean. He picked it up, nodded his thanks to the old man and to Ash, then turned to lean back against the counter and check out the venue. It was full of people, but not crowded. Men and women alike were happily dancing to the music, played by a jive band. Skirts were twirling around women’s legs as their partners spun them about. Feet kicked in beat with the music and arms flung about above them. Laughter and delighted calls paired with the band nicely, making the entire atmosphere more fun.
“Yeah, it was, wasn’t it,” Dean nodded, pursing his lips. “I haven’t been to many weddings.”
As the sun rose Monday morning, Dean laid in bed with Cas snug against his side. He tightened his arms around the pilot and tipped his head down into the soft mess of Cas’s hair. Cas nuzzled into the crook of Dean’s neck, kissing his collarbone. These last few days, falling asleep with Cas every night and waking up with him every morning, was something Dean didn’t want to end. But Cas was leaving today, regardless of what Dean wanted. Both of them had stations to return to and they had to wake up from this dream eventually.
“I don’t wonder, no.” Cas said, smiling softly.
“Yeah, Sammy, I will,” Dean nodded, smiling back. He squeezed Sam’s hand then pulled away, going up to bed. It was going to be long night of anticipation and Dean hoped he would be able to fall asleep. Tomorrow he would see Castiel again.
He elongated the words ‘nice’ and ‘slow’ in a way that was overtly sexual and Dean held up a hand to stop him, “Alright, that’s enough! I got it!”
Returning 23 May 1941
“I will! Definitely. So, how, uh, how are you?”
By the end of the night, they were both happy and Cas stopped pretending he didn’t know how to skate. Dean flashed him a smile, “You’re doing better, Cas!”
Testing new planes was fun, too. A pilot had to keep on his toes with these because there was no one to tell you their little quirks and oddities. That would be their job, to find out what you could do with them, find their limits, their hidden talents and their shortcomings. Pilots could -- and would -- write essays about the planes, what to tell the manufacturers to do differently the next go and what the kids in training needed to know about them. But reading it in an aviation journal didn’t have anything on discovering it all yourself.
Now it was Dean’s turn to cut Castiel off, doing so by instantly resuming their broken kiss. He held Castiel’s face, kissing him with great fervor. Castiel moaned into it, eyes closed and mouth more than willing. The kiss was hard, desperate, and Dean pressed Castiel into the bed. Crushed between Dean’s body and the mattress was exactly where Cas wanted to be. His fingers clung to Dean wherever they could find purchase, one at the side of Dean’s face and the other at the back of his shoulder.
Everyone was a little more on edge during the tour of the North Atlantic than Cas had expected. It all came about when they first got news of an event that happened in early April. While the United States had not formally entered the war, they were still fairly clearly on the side of the Allies. The neutrality patrols that the crew of the
In the midst of all the movement, John snagged Mary around the waist and pulled her close to kiss her cheek. He whispered a Merry Christmas to her and Dean smiled at the way her eyes softened as she looked at her husband. Their relationship wasn’t perfect, they fought sometimes, and sometimes John drank too much when he spent too much time thinking about the First World War, but they never stopped loving each other; It was in moments like these that Dean realized how lucky he was to have a loving family.
“We grow accustomed to early nights,” Castiel concurred.
Castiel shook his head, “I don’t know.” He did though, he just didn’t want to admit what it was. Castiel didn’t fully understand it because he’d never felt quite this way about another person before, but it felt right. It felt like something he never believed he would feel.
“Best paint a picture in your mind instead, then.”
The dinner was delicious, as was the cake. Speeches were made by the father of the bride, the Maid of Honor and Dean, as the Best Man. During his speech, Dean was funny, charming and even sweet and sentimental. The amount of pride and emotion in his voice at times proved just how much he cared for his little brother. The love and admiration in Sam’s eyes as he watched Dean give the more meaningful parts of his speech showed he cared just as much for Dean. Cas caught sight of Jess dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief once or twice, when she wasn’t laughing at his jokes.
“What, Anna?”
Anna narrowed her eyes at him and tried not to smile.
Castiel grinned, lips pressed against Dean’s neck, teeth brushing against the supple skin, where small beads of sweat began to form. He teased, “With age comes experience.”
“This world we live in is full of pain.” Dean looked at Cas as if he was crazy, but Castiel pressed on, “Two wars of worldwide proportions, the Depression, the Dust Bowl, all within one lifetime. With so much suffering and so many hardships, why shouldn’t we smile as often as we can? I’m loath to give up something that makes me feel this way... The way I feel around you.”
“It’s kind of personal.”
Dean shrugged.
“No, I think I know a place,” Novak interrupted. “Blues is more the thing here, but jazz goes hand in hand with it.”
Dean’s eyes flashed open and he grinned broadly before stealing command of the kiss, pressing Cas into the bed. “I believe you already did that.”
Jessica laughed at something Sam said, then spotted Dean leaning there watching. “Well, mister, are you being a fly on the wall, there?”
“If you get sent out to sea, you know, on assignment.” Dean looked down at his plate, focusing on cutting some meat rather than looking at Cas’s reaction.
The words echoed in Cas’s mind, the memory of Dean, half asleep in the bed, saying them before he left the hotel last month.
“Well, you know, when they die and you inherit everything because you’re a man --”
“Cas!” She said and hurried over to him. He held out both arms and pulled her into a warm embrace when she was near.
Dean scanned down to number 7, to find Glenn Miller’s name next to the song The Nearness of You. “Do you have this one?”
“I should think so.”
At 9:30 in the morning, Cas caught the train out of Great Lakes heading for Chicago to meet his little sister, who was coming up from Pontiac. She had a longer trip to make than he did, but Cas wanted to get there early and meet her at the station. They always went to the same restaurant whenever they met up for a meal in Chicago. It was a little family owned place called Emmanuel’s that wasn’t especially fancy, but felt homey and comfortable in a way they both liked.
Confused, Dean picked up the receiver off the hall table. “This is Dean.”
“Don’t come yet...” Cas murmured in a gravel voice.
“What’s the grin all about, Castiel?” Bal’s tone showed he was needling at something.
After a low moan, Castiel chuckled, “I’m no God...”
“Now I want you...” Cas gasped out. “Now I want you to come for me.”
“I want a photograph,” Dean said, still smiling and pulled change from his pocket to push into the slot.
“I’m grand! Come on in,” Sam chuckled, smiling brightly. He picked up Dean’s bag to carry it for him and dragged Dean into the kitchen, where his mother, Mary, was baking and his father, John, sat at the table, reading a newspaper. “Look who’s home.”
“Hey, hey, Sammy!” Dean smacked Sam’s shoulder a few times, then stepped back and looked him over. “How you doing? Not still growing are you? You’re already taller than me, you giant.”
“Hawaii.” Cas smirked at Dean.
Cas laughed and shook his head. “I’m not nearly as attractive as him. He’s a movie star.”
After eating, they paid and left the restaurant, walking out into the pleasant night air. On the street, Dean turned to Cas with a huge grin and tugged on his jacket sleeve, “You know what we should do?”
As the plane went up, it wobbled and Cas held his breath until it was clear. The next plane taxied into place. Men on the ground ran about hooking it up to the catapult and readying the craft for launch. It went up with a wobble as well and Cas frowned as he moved his own plane into place next. A bad take off didn’t ever bode well, but soon it would be his turn to try. One of the less than ideal features about the new planes was the landing gear, which shouldn’t seem to be a problem on take off, except that it was manually lowered and retracted, which meant winding a crank with one hand.
Jess brought her hands to her lips and tears welled in her eyes, but she was smiling as bright as Dean had ever seen. She nodded before she managed to speak and held out one trembling hand to Sam.
“Where do you think the pirates sailed?” Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean.
“That went very well,” he said.
When Cas gave up, Dean was there, grinning at him. Cas tipped his head curiously and opened his mouth to ask what Dean was grinning at, but Dean held up a hand to wave it off. He murmured a quiet, “Later.”
“It’s funnier if you know him, I guess...” Dean shrugged and thought to himself,
“You’ve been here before?” the pilot turned to fully face Dean, no longer splitting his attention between the army man and the dancers.
“If you insist.”
“They are.” Castiel laughed warmly and ate one as Dean finished his. “Anna gets really mad if I visit without bringing her some. She says I’m fortunate that I can get these any time I want, and I suppose I am, but I rarely buy them.”
“Are you embarrassed?” Dean’s question broke Castiel from his reverie.
“That is not fair, Cas.”
Castiel smiled before he answered, “Very good at the moment. I admit, I wasn’t so sure I should call, but then I decided to just ... go for it.”
“It’s good, real good. They give us a lot of work, so reading and studying takes up most of my time.”
Eventually they found a place to eat, both agreeing that anything looked good. The restaurant was full of people not much younger than themselves, and it was small enough to feel comfortable, not overly fancy. There was no lounge singer and the waiters didn’t look like they belonged in the Ritz Carlton, letting them both relax through the meal. They kept the conversation easy and Castiel kept it mostly focused on Dean. The man spoke of his home and childhood, games he played with Sam and the friends he had there. Dean’s love for his family was endearing and something Castiel envied a little, but he was too happy to know that Dean’s life had been a good one for the envy to be more than a fleeting thought.
“If you insist...” As they walked, Dean released Castiel’s jacket and slid his hands into his pockets. Castiel watched him and the way Dean couldn’t stop grinning. It was heartwarming. Though Dean was only about five years younger than him, Castiel saw a youthful spirit in the man that made him feel young again as well. It was a breath of fresh air as compared to the way his students made him feel much older.
“Comin’ right up,” She flashed a smile at Dean, then turned to fill two small boxes of candies, placing a little paper cup-shaped wrapper under each truffle.
“Careful?” Castiel tipped his head, confused.
“Well, you know, you can be all hypothetical, you know. Say, for instance,
“I’ll win the ones with my fists.”
John nodded to this. “Have you seen any action out there yet?”
“You only get them when you visit her, huh?”
Sam let go and Dean went back to the kitchen, where his mother had a small plate of food set out. Rubbing his hands together, Dean took a seat in front of the plate.
He laughed as well and hugged her about the shoulders. “You know that even if they never support you, I always will.”
“Oh, I bet you do,” Dean said, then cast a worried glance at Cas. “Maybe we shouldn’t let them meet.”
“Hey.”
“The small town of Lawrence, Kansas,” Dean said. “I followed in my dad’s footsteps, joining the army. He served in the last war. It’s kinda the family business. Except for my brother, well, never mind that.”
“Ow!” Cas made a face at her and leaned down to rub his shin. “Yes.”
“My sister,” Castiel nodded, laughing. “She sends me letters.”
“Morning,” Dean said as he poured himself a bowl of cereal. “Am I the last one up?”
It was involuntary action when Castiel’s hips lifted slightly. It was less involuntary when his hand guided Dean towards his cock, “If you want to eat some part of me, I’ve got one for you right here.”
“Something tells me you’re not particularly interested in me.” Tessa smiled, not appearing offended by this fact.
The plane’s cockpit didn’t offer as much visibility as he would have liked, unfortunately, and it had clearly been taken into account. There were windows at the bottom of the cockpit so he could peer down beneath him, which could prove useful in a fight if the pilots lost sight of the enemy. Considering that, it was odd that visibility wasn’t great. All the same, the plane handled very well and as Cas turned his plane around, testing its ability, he caught sight of Gabe in a plane near him. The other pilot signaled a thumbs up and Cas laughed, returning the sign.
“Well, you can always write to me from the train.” For a brief moment, Dean reached out and took Cas’s hand, giving it a little squeeze, before letting go, just in case someone spotted them. Cas barely had time to squeeze Dean’s hand back before he lost contact. The gesture was understood, all the same.
“After dinner, before we went skating, you laughed but you wouldn’t tell me why.”
“Uh, well...” Dean really should have seen that assumption coming.
“Yeah, Cas?” He could feel Dean grinning against his pelvis. His tongue darted out to lick a trail along the line of his hip, dipping down but not quite reaching his cock.
He wrote to Dean and Anna that night -- he even wrote to his parents -- sending the letters off first thing the next morning. Things were going to get worse, more likely sooner than later.
“No, one just eats ice cream on the beach with his shoes in his hand and pants rolled up.”
“That must be a wonderful feeling.”
“What is it you want to say?” Ash asked.
As if chasing that contact, Dean bumped his shoulder into Cas’s while they continued walking down the street. “When do you leave?”
Taking a deep breath and shaking his head, Cas turned to Gabe. “I guess I’ll head down to the cabin now.”
“You have me, Dean.” Castiel murmured into his hair. His heart pounded in his chest as random thoughts surfaced in his mind. The subtle touch of hands in the ballroom, the stolen kiss in the photobooth, the first letter signed “yours,” a smile, a laugh, a moan of passion. All these things that were Dean, and now him, here, saying he needed Cas, was almost more than the pilot could handle. Castiel’s voice was hoarse when he added, “I’m yours.”
Finally, she asked him, “So?”
Cas nodded and they walked on quietly for a few blocks, just enjoying each other’s company. One thing Dean loved about being with Cas was that the silence could be so comfortable between them. It never felt like they needed to fill it with pointless words.
He leaned back slightly, bracing one hand on Cas’s leg and lifted himself up, then lowered down again. He found a steady rhythm, watching Cas’s face as he took the man into himself over and over.
“One conversation with Anna and she would be. Most people would be. She makes very compelling arguments.”
“You two can stop now.” Dean said, purposefully not looking at them. He tried to scowl, but it wasn’t working.
“And now I have one of my own. You know you won’t win a pillow fight against me, sister.”
Dean looked thoughtful, then asked, “Why do you fight, Cas?”
“Hi! Yes, hi! I’m looking for Lieutenant Novak? He’s a fighter pilot, training new recruits?”
“Eventful day, huh?” Gabe asked, once they were done and left standing in the hangar.
Cas looked up at him with half-lidded eyes, a small grin on his lips. “We’ve waited so long for this...” He bucked his hips up slightly.
Castiel held Dean’s gaze for a moment, smiled slowly and gave a nod. “Good. That’s good.”
“Great Lakes naval base, please. I’m trying to reach a Lieutenant Novak.”
“I just hope that when it does present itself, we aren’t going to regret how long we waited.” Dean scowled.
“You are, aren’t you?” Dean set his hands in his pockets and practically strutted, swinging his legs out with each step, chest out and cocky.
“Heya, Cas. Come on in.” Dean stepped back and held the door open, gesturing for the pilot to enter the hotel. A sort of giddy feeling rose in his stomach, causing a smile that couldn’t be wiped off his face if he tried. “Closet’s right there, if you want to hang up your stuff.”
“Glad to help!” The girl rang up the Ozzie Nelson record for him and Cas paid.
“Merry Christmas! Winchester residence.” He wore a beaming smile as he spoke into the phone, spirits high.
“And now, a special report on the war. On this day, exactly one year since Poland surrendered to Nazi Germany in Warsaw, the nations of Germany, Italy and Japan gathered together to sign a pact now known to us as the Tripartite Pact. Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, representative from Germany, Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano of Italy and Ambassador Saburo Kurusu of Japan signed the pact for their respective countries. Also in attendance, Foreign Minister Count Stephen Csáky, signing on behalf of Hungary. It is reported that Adolf Hitler was not present at the meeting.
“That’s a nice beach,” Dean commented idly.
“Eat your ice cream, Cas.” Dean rolled his eyes and turned away to eat his own ice cream, watching children playing in the water. He could feel Cas’s eyes on him and with a sidelong glance saw the man smiling.
“What do you want me to say?”
“You callin’ me funny?” There was no anger in Dean’s voice, only a playfulness.
“Yeah, not something you know a whole lot about either,” Dean said, shifting his weight to one arm so he could shove Sam with the other.
He had no intention of buying the record when he came in, but now it seemed rude to come in and listen to it without purchasing anything. So he nodded to her and slipped the record back into its sleeve and brought it over to the counter.
Cas laughed silently. “Yes. Always. I don’t want to forget this.”
“Our fair city’s citizens are not without fault.” Castiel frowned.
John and Dean both stood up to shake Sam’s hand and give him a hug.
“Those are Vals! Dive bombers!” He shouted, grabbing the sleeve of the nearest pilot to pull him back. “Take cover!”
He had to come up with some explanation to get out of this. “I’m trying to ... give my brother advice, but I can’t say it outright, in case our parents happen to read it, you know what I mean?”
Her smile shifted to a smirk. “I like the sound of that.”
“I don’t know, what kind of personality does he have? Is he fun or boring? Does he get along with his family? Is he smart? That kind of thing.” Anna wasn’t going to give up and there was no getting out of it. Cas wondered if Dean had to go through this with his little brother.
“Thin walls, I imagine?” Cas said, kissing a path to Dean’s ear.
Cas ran over to Inias’s plane, Gabe and Bal on their way behind him. The younger pilot had his cockpit open and was climbing down when they got there. His hands were shaking visibly, but otherwise seemed fine. The plane would need some repairs.
“Of... us?” Castiel blinked, surprised.
“Yeah,” Dean rolled his sleeves down, buttoning the cuffs before putting on his coat and fedora. He grabbed both room keys, handed one over to Cas and led them out of the room. Apart from the occasional, and not entirely accidental, brush of hands or arms against one another, they acted as any two men would together.
“Dean,” he said. Over and over again, Castiel whispered the name, his voice full of wanting, need, desire and, god-help-him, full of love. Castiel’s hand slid down the length of Dean’s back, feeling the flex of his muscles with each thrust of his hips. His fingers dug into the hard muscles there and his grip made Dean bite at his neck. He wrapped a leg around one of Dean’s, then reached lower, taking a firm hold of the man’s ass.
“So, what, I should be more understanding of her? Allow her to tell me I need a man?”
“It is. Carriers are unlike any other ship in an armada.”
Castiel chuckled, rich and deep, and shook his head. He pulled Dean the rest of the way to the bed and pushed his jacket off. They stopped at the end of the bed, less than a foot apart from each other. Castiel’s hands worked open the buttons on Dean’s shirt, from throat to waist, then pulled the tails out from his pants. Fingers hooked under Dean’s suspenders, sliding up to his shoulders and tugged them off as well, to hang at his hips.
Castiel nodded and stood, only to have Dean catch his hand when he rose as well. He tugged Castiel in for one more kiss, shorter this time, than the last. They both smiled into it, like school boys kissing behind the bleachers, and pulled away laughing.
“Been a long day for you, huh?” Dean said, catching the yawn.
“Dean...” Castiel nearly cried out the name, breathless from these simple actions, heady with emotions he wasn’t used to.
They shifted their way up to the head of the bed, laughing when they bumped noses, trying to keep the kiss going during the move. Finally, they settled, with Castiel on his back and Dean straddling his hips, leaning over and continuing to kiss the planes of Castiel’s torso. Cas’s hands found purchase in Dean’s hair, pulling at those short strands as he arched his back in response to Dean’s lips.
Just as he expected, the Vals swooped down, dropping bombs on the hangars. The explosions were immediate as planes blew up. Castiel and his pilots were blown back, thrown by the force of the blast. Flames exploded from the hangar and the world went bizarrely quiet, like Castiel’s ears were filled with cotton, moments before he slammed into the tarmac and the world went black.
“Yeah, okay.” Sam walked away, still grinning at Dean’s expense.
A devious smile crossed Castiel’s lips and he reached up to grab at Dean’s dogtags, using them to pull him in closer and crushing their lips together in another kiss. Dean liked the way Castiel wasn’t afraid to take charge and held Castiel’s face between his hands as he returned that kiss. Everything about this moment was more than Dean could have asked for. He wanted Castiel more than he ever had during those months apart.
Cas kissed his temple. “I’m here, Dean.”
, the first attack on an American warship. US neutrality in the war became all the more tenuous. President Roosevelt ordered Navy to protect convoys, telling them to shoot on sight if a ship or convoy is threatened. By the end of September, the US Naval Command ordered an all out war on any Axis ship in American waters.

“Too bad! Should have waited to give them to me!” She bit the first one in half and kept the second in the box, which she stored in her purse for after lunch. “Want half?”
That statement wiped the smile off Dean’s face and replaced it with startled confusion. “What? Why?”
“So are we going to walk the trail?”
Sunday before Christmas was a special kind of torture. Cas and Anna were forced to go to church first thing that morning for mass, which lasted an hour. They both had to wear their Sunday Best, which for Anna meant a brand new dress that her mother had picked out, modest and clean and uncomfortable. Cas got off easy, because he was able to wear his best formal naval uniform, but his mother and father were worse than any Admiral doing uniform inspections. If so much as a piece of lint dusted his pristine white uniform, he would receive a disapproving scowl from his father. As if Cas put that lint there specifically to offend him.
“En garde!” Cas struck a pose and mimed fighting with a sword the way Errol Flynn might.
He combed his hair, making sure each strand was perfectly placed, checked his teeth with a broad smile and gave an approving nod. From there, he headed to the ballroom. Women on the street smiled when they saw him. Men tipped their hats. With the uniform came respect and Dean liked that. He was no more than a grunt on the Army line, but he fought for their country. Before long, he would certainly be fighting on the front. It was the thought in the back of many people’s minds, but everyone smiled tonight, still filled with post-holiday cheer and the hope that came with the start of a new year.
Dean crooked a smile and ran a hand down Castiel’s body, letting it rest on his ass. “Is that so...”
Here’s notes from that scene:
“It is,” Novak nodded.
“Yeah, think so...”
She tried to keep a straight face, but it eventually dissolved into laughter. She shoved him by the shoulder, pushing him away. “You’re ridiculous. Just for that, I’m not showing you until after lunch.”
It was nearly 8:00 pm when Dean arrived at the bus stop in Lawrence, Kansas on Saturday. Home was only a few blocks away, so shouldering his pack, he made way to the house where he grew up. A cool breeze and the dry air were a welcome change as he walked along, filling him with nostalgia for home. Careless summer nights of his childhood were spent with his brother Sammy, wandering town, causing trouble or meeting up with other boys in the neighborhood. Those nights were long gone, after life caught up to them, making men of them both.
Still, it was nice to be back and as he walked in the front door and smelled the fresh aroma of cherry pie greeted him instantly. He dropped his bag in the hall and called out, “I’m home!”
Dean couldn’t help but smile, “I’ll be sure to pass the message along.”
“Sure you wouldn’t rather be doing a crossword?” Dean teased.
“At least the army is generous for holidays. How have you been?”
“Love?” Anna supplied the word neither he nor Dean had said out loud.
“Sure,” Ash shrugged, as did Benny, and they followed Dean inside. Both men wandered aimlessly into the aisles to look at the records while Dean went straight for the counter. The shop was busy with local teenagers, all free from school for the day. Music was playing and they danced around, chatting about how they liked this song or that and the girls said how dreamy some of the singers were.
“Couldn’t agree more,” Dean gave Castiel one more hard kiss, then lifted himself off the smaller man. His hands went quickly to pulling Castiel’s trousers open and down over his hips, socks and shoes and whatever else covered him would follow suit. Castiel leaned back on his elbows and watched as Dean removed the rest of his own clothing, everything was tossed aside with little care. Now free of clothing, Dean took a place beside Castiel, one hand on his stomach, leaning in to kiss at Castiel’s neck. “How’s this?”
“You leave today...” He tried his best to keep the emotion light in those words.
“The second night after we met in January. Just before we said goodbye.”
“Thanks,” Cas said, hauling his bag up onto a shoulder. He turned to Dean, “Ready to go?”
The second they’re alone and feel safe, it’s going to be dramatic.
“Little bit cramped in here,” Bal’s voice came over the radio.
“That’s a nice thought.” Castiel said.
They laughed and carried on eating. Anna gave him the updates about what she was doing with her time, briefly spoke of how their parents were fairing and general news from town. After the meal, Anna ordered a slice of cake for each of them for dessert, insisting that he get cake for his birthday, but sparing him the song. As they ate, she pulled a small box from her purse, wrapped in brown paper and handed it over.
“Then we have the house to ourselves for a bit.” Cas offered her a smile. They went to the kitchen to steal a snack before supper, then retreated to Anna’s bedroom to talk. Together, they sat on the edge of her bed munching on some sweet bread.
Jo shrugged, “Just getting out of the house for a while. Say, maybe we can get lunch one day while you’re home. Catch up on each other’s lives.”
Eventually a ranking officer gave orders over the ship’s PA system and they all had work to do and tasks to complete. The ship had set sail, aiming south towards the tropics and away from the chilly shores of Virginia.
“When it matters, I believe you would do what’s right.”
Dean nodded, but didn’t speak. When Cas looked over to see his face in the dim light of the street lamps, his expression seemed thoughtful. He wanted to ask what Dean was thinking, but decided to just wait for him to be ready. After they walked a little over a block, Dean spoke up.
When Dean nodded this time, he said nothing. In his mind, he repeated words that would become his mantra.
“Different how?” Sam drew his brows together.
By the time they pulled apart, Dean and Castiel were both panting mouths agape and staring into one another’s eyes. Dean grinned, brushing his thumb along Castiel’s jaw and the pilot mirrored his expression, leaning into that hand slightly.
“I’m heading down to Fort Bragg from here, getting trained more than doing the training, though.” Dean hoped he wasn’t out of his league here, but then, that never really stopped him from making friends before.
“Sated, cocky,” he hummed in thought, then leaned down to brush his lips against Castiel’s. “Kissable.”
Benny considered that, then nodded and chuckled. “Yeah, okay, I see.” He kicked back on his bunk again. “That’s Cas, right?”
They went into the house and Dean took Cas’s bags and set them down in the front room, then led him to the kitchen. As he entered, Dean called out, “I’m back!”
“There’s a lounge upstairs, if you want to check that out? They might serve food up there. Did you want a shower or to change or anything before eating?”
“Yeah, shut up.”
Castiel chuckled, “I take it you really like her.”
“Shouldn’t we maybe let him take his stuff upstairs and get settled in first?” Dean asked.
“Indeed,” Cas nodded.
“I did. I know you’re sick of those Grumman biplanes they had you flying on tour. I can’t very well make the Navy give you a mono, so I got you one myself.”
It was Tuesday night, just after dinner time and while the officers who did training were allowed to leave, they were too far from anywhere to go out and still get a decent night’s sleep. Anyone who wanted to socialize and have some fun ended up in a lounge where they could listen to music, play ping pong or pool, or chat with each other. Cas really wasn’t close to any of the officers here, but he talked to them socially every so often.
“Would you like to hear it?”
With the ice cream consumed, Dean and Castiel continued their trek up the beach, dodging children playing games and building sand castles. When the sand finally receded, they walked through the grass to clean their feet before donning socks and shoes once more to continue on the trail.
“I guess we have to let go now.” Dean didn’t move a muscle, neither did Cas, but he sighed.
“Cadet Bass.... Aaron. What can I do for you?”
Cas huffed a laugh. “They don’t say that one ‘cusses like a sailor’ for no reason.”
“There are several on the lake, that one is rather popular, though.” Safe again from public eye, this time Castiel took Dean’s hand, stroking the back of it with his thumb as they strolled northward. They passed harbors and parks, strayed away from and back towards Lake Shore Drive. There were great landscaped areas and centers for recreation as well as areas where not a soul was in sight. Dean wasn’t exactly reclusive, but he preferred the times when there was no one around them. Call him selfish, but he wanted Cas to himself as much as possible.
“Darn, that’s a shame. Now that Jess has gone and gotten herself hitched, I’m going to need a new partner in crime. Dean-o here is never home, so he’s out.” She thumbed in his direction.
“Dean,” Sam mocked. “Come on, I’m your brother. I spent my whole life looking up to you, I know all your expressions. Who is it?”
“Thank you,” Cas kissed his cheek and smiled. Dean wondered if he was as amused by how domestic they were being.
Mary continued to frown at him, but it was clear she was trying to hide a smile. “Well I could use a new set of pot holders. And a new spatula.”
“Every single day.” Benny replied without a second thought.
The hotel room was nice: two beds separated by a nightstand, a small table and chair, and a bathroom with vanity. He dumped his duffle bag on one of the beds and laid out his clothes. His suits had gotten creased on the journey, but that was expected and fortunately the small closet by the bathroom contained a courtesy ironing board and several hangers. After picking what he would wear for the night, he headed to the bathroom.
“Just once. Just. Once. I would like to have a meal without mother trying to insist I am nothing without a man at my side.” She paced around in a circle.
“As you say,” Castiel smiled, looking away.
“Me either. Have you found the others yet?”
“Dean, no name calling at Christmas,” Mary scolded.
Cas laughed. “Tenderfoot. I spent a lifetime training to stand through long functions in uncomfortable shoes. This is nothing.”
Dean grinned at Cas, then settled back in his chair to enjoy the rest of the show. Sonny Boy sang another dozen or so songs and the whole audience cheered for every song, Dean and Cas included. When their night at the blues club was over, it was dark outside, despite the long daylight hours of summer. Outside, Dean and Cas walked a few blocks before hailing a cab to take them back to their hotel. Dean almost didn’t want to get there, because he didn’t want the night to end.
“Oh yeah?” Dean leaned over Castiel’s shoulder to see the mint meltaways. “I think I’ll give those a try.”
“Right, yeah.” Dean nodded, trying to avoid an awkward silence, but failing at it because he didn’t know what else to say. He really wasn’t accustomed to worrying about people that weren’t his family. What did that make Cas, then?
“And you can thank the Lake Effect for that, come along,” Castiel nodded down the street in the direction from which Dean had come. “The club is a few blocks this way.”
“You should keep me up to date on how things are going with them.”
“That it?”
“About damn time, Sammy,” Dean laughed and patted him on the back. “I’m real happy for you.”
“You want to go roller skating.” Though Castiel meant it as a question, the phrase came out more like a statement of disbelief.
“He’s a man, first of all. Not a boy.” Cas corrected and instantly regretted it, because of the teasing look on Anna’s face. So he pressed on. “His name is Dean, he is from Kansas and is in infantry training at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.”
“It’s easier to get through each day when you know that your life could be the one that keeps them safe.” Dean nodded to the little girl and her family.
“Anna has the sweet tooth and so I’ve sampled many chocolatiers to find the best for her. Now every time I go home I have to bring her a box.”
“He might still be alright, brother. There’s still hope for him. You always make friends with the smartest folks, so he’s gotta be smart, too. Smart guys, they’re survivors. He’s gonna be okay. You’ll see.”
“It was,” He wiped his hands over his face.
“That bad? Even at Christmas?”
She waved him off. “You know what I mean. Outside of working conditions. Is there someone you’re sweet on?”
“You might have said the same thing the night that photo was taken.” She pointed at it. “And yet, it’s a year from then, isn’t it?”
Both men removed the last of the clothing, all but their boxers, before climbing into the bed. Cas stretched out on his back and Dean straddled his waist. He ran his hands over that nicely tanned and muscular chest.
“Wow... That is a hell of a way to wake up,” he said, his chest heaving for air in the aftermath.
“Errol Flynn! He’s grand.”
“It was a lucky break that my last tour was so brief.”
“We still hold the upper hand,” One of the men in the Navy uniforms said, good-naturedly, giving the army man a swat on the chest with the back of his hand.
“Guess I won’t ever meet her, then. But if you get a chance, tell her I said to keep fighting for it.”
“So you joined the Navy to follow in your father’s footsteps?” John asked, changing the subject back to the armed forces.
“I’ll see you again, sometime soon.” He cupped Dean’s cheek one last time and forced a smile as he stood from the edge of the bed.
“Nah, I’m sure Sam’s right,” Dean grinned. “If I had time in the morning before my train, I’d stop by your bank just to see you in action.”
The train ride to Lawrence from Norfolk was very long. Cas spent much of it reading, writing a letter to Anna, or staring out the window. On long trips like this, he often looked at the sky and wished he could be flying rather than riding. Commercial flights were not much of an option in the US, not like they were overseas. After the last war, there were a lot of spare planes going unused, which made it relatively easy for his father to acquire planes and teach Castiel and Anna how to fly them.
Unblinking, Dean nodded again, slowly. “Best friends.” More. More than best friends. Boyfriends. More than boyfriends. More than lovers. But Dean was giving automatic, trained responses.
“Same place as always?” She asked, chipper again.
Cas shook his head, “No, they’re yours.”
Those butterflies started their fluttering all over again. Cas wondered if Dean’s stomach ever did flips and turns in these moments or if he just caused them. “I think so, too.”
“Is that why you were laughing last night?”
“Shit, Cas, we’ve created a monster!” Dean looked over at Cas with comical fear in his eyes. Or, perhaps it was true fear, Cas wasn’t entirely certain.
It had been two months since Castiel last saw Anna and two months since he had given himself permission to fall in love with Dean. A month from Tuesday would mark one year since he met Dean Winchester at the Aragon Ballroom. Cas often thought back on that night, how he had been drawn in by Dean’s charming smile and easygoing manner. He liked the way Dean had joined the conversation without being intimidated by the high ranking officers; that confidence was attractive.
“I don’t think I could stop my sister from doing what she wants... She would probably just borrow one of Father’s planes and fly here herself if I tried.”
“Jess, Sammy, I’d like to introduce you to my friend, Cas.” Dean gestured to Cas as the pair of them neared.
Castiel leaned in a little closer, lifting one wet hand to hold the side of Dean’s face. He kissed the soldier properly, fully and deeply. Their lips lingered in that kiss and Castiel could tell that even though he made a joke, Dean liked this feeling just as much as he did. The kiss wasn’t fevered and passionate, it was slow and soothing: a kiss of great care and affection. Perhaps what had blossomed between them was love, perhaps it was something less than that, time would tell if they were lucky. What mattered is that there was something there, something very deep and worthwhile.
Walking back to the hotel didn’t take long but by the time they arrived at their room, Castiel could already feel his eyelids growing heavy. The warm laugh from Dean told him the infantryman had noticed. Dean pressed a kiss to his temple from his place standing behind Cas and slid hands over his shoulders, hooking fingers under the collar of his coat and pulling it down off his shoulders.
“Y’all are just being rude now,” Ash shook his head and both Dean and Benny laughed.
When the service ended and his family was done mingling with members of the congregation, they all went out for brunch. It was a small talk nightmare during which Castiel tried to avoid participating in the conversation. There were always guests, acquaintances of the family whom his parents wanted to impress or associate with. His father would always eventually talk business and one of the women would chastise him because it was Christmas. One of the men would try and rope Cas in, asking him about taking over the business from his father one day.
“Sounds like confirmation to me,” Ash joked and climbed up to his bunk.
Dean’s hands busied themselves with getting Castiel out of his shirt, so he could have more skin to touch and taste. As he stripped Castiel of one more layer, Dean spread his hands across Castiel’s chest and down to the hem of his undershirt. He slipped his fingers under and slowly pulled it up and off, causing Cas’s perfectly combed hair to dishevel a little. Castiel was tanned, his chest and arms made of lean muscles and his stomach was smooth. His own dogtags hung at the center of his chest. It took a moment for Dean to realize he was staring, but when he looked up he caught Castiel grinning at him.
“Well, yeah, you’ve been sitting the whole time.” Dean playfully punched Cas’s shoulder.
Anyone, except for Cas’s squadron, that is. They had done patrol flights the previous day and all had gone just fine until they landed and were stowing the planes. No one could find Balthazar. He and Inias had gotten separated at some point and no one had a location on him. They called him over the radio on the planes, but got no answer. Best case scenario meant he was out of range, worst case scenario, he crashed. Either way, it put everyone involved on edge. Their commanding officer wasn’t particularly pleased, either.
“That’s very forward-thinking of him,” Mary agreed.
“Not really. I’m sure I’ll cross paths with some of them. I might run into town today or tomorrow.”
“Sounds like.”
“Good to know.” The amused smile on Castiel’s lips told Dean that the man noticed the awkwardness between them as well, but wasn’t fazed by it.
was patrolling. Cas and the others ate up any news they could get of what was happening, but were only privy to what the US Navy intelligence could access and provide to them. That, and of course, whatever was printed in the news. Stories of Luftwaffe bombings in Liverpool and Nottingham, RAF bombings of Hamburg and Berlin, convoys sunk at sea all across the Atlantic. It was hard to say who was winning at this point, and that was just news from Europe. The war had spread much further than that, across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Even Canada had joined the war, and had been part of it since 1939.

He scanned the room to find people milling about, chit chatting with one another in idle conversation. A woman held the arm of a man, laughing brightly at something he said, flirting. Elsewhere, men joked and jostled one another, drinking amber liquors out of tumblers with ice. Most men were dressed in fine three piece suits, the woman in fancy cocktail dresses. Dean waded through the crowds towards the bar, ordering a drink to sip on while he watched the dancers and tapped his foot to the music.
“Okay, maybe they aren’t the same thing exactly, but they’re tops. Come on, let’s see it.”
“Nah, not yet. You’ve still got some fight left in you.” Dean grinned. John might give him a hard time and might ask too much of him, but he was still Dean’s dad and still his hero in a lot of ways.
“She can, yes,” Cas nodded to both Jessica and Mary. “We were very fortunate to have the opportunity. And I believe my sister may have had fits if she couldn’t learn to fly, as well.”
Cas survived the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But he broke his arm in the attack. He spends a little while in the medical unit where he meets Meg as a nurse. She writes a letter for him to his family, and one to Dean.
“I’m 31, soldier.”
“If we fight in this war, if we win, will it ever be over? Or will we find the children of this generation are just fighting in another after us?”
He always gave noncommittal answers, that his father was still fully capable of running things, that he was in service to the United States Navy, and that took precedence in his life right now. They were the canned answers he always gave, avoiding insult to his father, maintaining his patriotism, things that no one could really argue against. The only person at the table he ever worried about disappointing was Anna, because she was trapped here, too, and had more questions to answer. There was constant pressure on her to find a man and get married and the holiday season always made that worse. Another year gone by and comments like “you aren’t getting any younger, Anna dear,” made both of them cringe.
“Yeah, please.”
“Oh, you haven’t heard whining.” Dean chuckled and shot Ash a grin. “Let’s just enjoy the music and the drinks, alright?”
“That’s a long haul to travel for an attack. Surely we would notice them before they got to us.”
So yeah, passionate sex and stuff.
The first line caught Cas off guard, and he thought, surely, Dean wasn’t being intentional with his message. The line said “Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper I love you.” They hadn’t said such a thing out loud to one another, or even began to discuss it. He listened on and discovered the rest of the song had more of the message that Cas had expected. Lines like, “While I’m alone as blue as can be, dream a little dream of me.” Or, “Stars fading but I linger on dear, still craving your kiss.”
“No?” Novak tipped his head to the side curiously.
“The U-boats, German submarines, are one of their strongest weapons.”
“You really are tired, aren’t you?” Dean laughed and hugged him before he could finish undressing Castiel.
As it was, Dean Winchester had time to spare on his way to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and a couple nights in the bustling city of Chicago was just what he wanted. Who knew when he would get another chance to walk the streets of the Windy City if they did, in fact, get plunged into war? He didn’t bother packing anything other than uniforms and dress blues and so it was that he strolled along the streets in his casual uniform, the one between combat and dress blues.
