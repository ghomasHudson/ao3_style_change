They caught up, perching uncomfortably on the curb to eat their sandwiches and swap stories of their hunts. The girls had just taken care of a nest of vampires up this way, a mobile group that was operating out of summer rental homes and snatching drunken teenagers from Beach Week parties. A lot of the hunts Claire had begged Kaia to agree to were vampire hunts lately. Dean didn’t press, but he was pretty sure he knew why. At one time, he would’ve felt the need to have the revenge talk with her, but he knew Kaia was making sure she kept both feet on the ground.
“That’s cool!” Dylan said. It made enough sense to him, to this little kid who’d just seen more murder and violence and blood than any kid should ever see in their lifetime. But this boy was too young to ever know the monsters under the bed weren’t
, alright!” Dean laughed, shoving a palm against Cas’s mouth to shut him up. “You made your poi— Jesus
“Okay.” Cas just blinked with annoyance before tightening his grip around Dean and trying to settle back into sleep. It was tempting to follow him back down.
“Turn here,” Sam said, pointing out his window to a gap in the trees. There wasn’t so much a road off to the right than an overgrown path. It looked like it used to be gravel, but the years had not been kind to what men had once built, and the road had sunk back into the dirt and brush it had once smothered.
Thorny tendrils of vengeful darkness curled around Dean’s wrists and ankles and sides, pressing deep blistering cuts into his skin. Dean could feel the sores opening on every inch of flesh as the Empty gnashed and ripped and tore into him. The pain was blinding, but Dean was laughing.
Sam opened the glove compartment to rifle through the scattered sheets of lore they’d left in there from previous hunts, looking for anything that could help them. But he knew he’d come up empty. This was unlike anything they’d faced before.
“Mm. Maybe,” she mused. “Normally we stalk a family, find one with just one kid. Minimal damage. We only
They flipped a coin and, since they didn’t have God writing luck into their cards anymore, did exactly the opposite of what the coin toss decided.
He slung a heavy arm out from under his pillow with a groan, pawing at the damn thing to shut it up. After a few unsuccessful smacks, and almost knocking the clock off the nightstand in the process, Dean reluctantly sat up.
He couldn’t believe it. He could, but also couldn’t – this wasn’t the first time he’d crawled out of the ground to find Sam had douched up Baby with a freakin’ iPod. And a silver one at that. Didn’t even match Baby’s paint.
Bobby hummed in agreement. “You were. But you’re human. You got a soul. I still get final say. And when you kicked it an’ I saw where your ticket was punched,” he shook his head. “I ripped up Billie’s plan.”
Dean turned to stare out the window, but it was well after sunset and too dark to see anything but his own reflection.
“Life’s only precious because it ends,” Dean mused, recalling a quote from a book he’d once read to Jack, back when the kid was struggling to define the line of morality and where he stood on it.
“Wow,” Dean whispered. He wasn’t just stargazing – he was marveling at the spattering of stars above. No— not marveling. Staring in awe. In
Cas hadn’t asked then. He’d only wrapped Dean up in his arms and guided him out to Baby’s backseat. For a while, that was the only place Dean felt safe. And now, months later, Cas still hadn’t pried. Deep down, Cas knew why. But even deeper down, Dean desperately wished he’d ask.
Dean’s hand closed around the gearshift and he yanked down hard, slamming the gas pedal to the floor. The Impala shuddered forward, the back end fishtailing out as the tires squealed against the pavement that was now slick with oil.
“The dead we feel guilty over,” Jenny said, finally pulling her hands away from her face. “It got so bad, I left Luther and the others. Thought that’d fix it. I ran halfway across the country, but when I made it to West Virginia, I started seeing her in my dreams again.”
And still, they weren’t fully sure what they were dealing with. Well, Dean was. The vampire mime theory was a damn good one, and he stood by it.
But Sam and Dean were strangers to this land. They didn’t know the significance of this particular spot in the Midwest, one that was born of the blood of men sacrificed to war, to commerce, to steel. Men sacrificed for causes far too eager to trade their lives for strips of paper; men sent to die for causes stained with the oily residue of a callous greed. It was a gruesome mixture of exploitation and needless sacrifice that was too tantalizing for an Old God – one of the oldest there was – to ignore.
Dean felt electricity bolt into his chest, felt it race through his veins, only to fizzle out. It wasn’t catching. A resigned sense of calm seeped in where, in another time, there would’ve been panic.
Bobby pulled two bottles out of the ice, and wrenched the caps off with the blade of his scythe. Dean stifled a small smile at that – Billie would’ve
“These wings are … yours,” Cas said, glancing up at the wing Dean had loosely wrapped over him. The dark feathers shimmered their blue-green iridescence even under here, concealed from direct light. Cas reached up and, with a ginger touch as light as his feathers, softly stroked his fingers down the vein of a crooked feather and smoothed it back into place. The motion sent a slight shiver down Dean’s spine.
Jack smiled. “Fake it ‘til I make it,” he repeated, as though he were filing the advice away for safekeeping in his mind.
.” She shoved her hands away from their necks and slumped back in her seat. “We need to go back to the barn.”
The drive out to the potential nest was quiet, save for Deep Purple drifting out through the speakers and Sam telling Dean where to turn. Dean gripped the wheel and hummed along to “Smoke on the Water” to both calm his nerves and get his head in the game for the hunt.
A small, somber half-smile tugged at the corner of his lips. How right his mom had been, even if she hadn’t truly believed it herself. Even in the moments Dean hadn’t believed, either.
He whispered a quiet prayer to Cas’s grace as he flew. Dean didn’t know which way was up – or if there even
There’s an entire world humans couldn’t see, and celestials never cared enough to look for. A realm that exists in all the empty spaces – in every crack in ice and stone, in the hollow of every root and vein, in every unused crevice inside the structures carved and erected by that so-called
note, the one he’d found inexplicably tucked into his pocket after he’d burned Dean’s lifeless body – the note he now kept on his desk.
Meat and teeth – the house, the trees, the rake the other Dean was holding, all of it was meat and teeth and gristle and bone all tangled together into one.
Don’t,” he choked on the word. “Don’t throw that away like I did... with Cas.” He felt some relief as the truth tumbled out of him. There were no secrets in death.
“You can drill into my head, Naomi, but you cannot make me hurt him,” Cas said, his voice steady, defiant as he stared down the barrel of the vine like a challenge.
Cas shifted and rolled over, careful not to tug on the feathers of the wing he was pillowed on. Dean could feel Cas’s breath hitch – or may be that was his own breath – from the sudden closeness of their faces. This was suddenly so much more intimate than holding Cas close to escape. That was necessary. That was survival. This was … vulnerable.
“Shut up,” Dean snapped. “I’d like to see you do any better if you sprouted two new freakin’ limbs all of a sudden.”
“I don’t … I don’t know,” Dean said. It was the truth. He hadn’t quite realized something sinister was pulling his strings until now. His head throbbed in tune with his injured hand, but the static was gone. He felt in control again. “Whatever the son of a bitch is, it’s out of me.”
Jenny just narrowed her eyes at him, contemplating the distance between the two of them and wondering if it was worth the pain in her knee to get into another fight.
“Shit, shit shit,” Dean muttered, lifting his foot up and throwing Baby into reverse to see if they could gain traction that way.
He raised his arm, the blade glinting in the light, and slashed through the vine in front of Cas’s face. The weapon sliced through it effortlessly, the chunk of darkness falling to the floor and writhing on the concrete. The other half of the vine snapped up toward the ceiling with a hiss.
Dean didn’t acknowledge Sam’s question with a response, but the way he stiffened his jaw and avoided Sam’s eyes was still a clear answer.
It stretched out, unfurling its parasitic vines toward every decaying corpse, cultivating its precious, endless garden of guilt and silence and rot. It began to reach, reaching toward its latest prey; the obstinate angel who’d refused to give in. Who’d caused the Empty so much pain.
“Hey,” he mumbled, breaking away and pulling up Cas’s hand to gently press his lips to Cas’s palm. He rolled his shoulders, and there was a soft crackle as his wings shimmered into view. “How about one last flight?”
Dean realized his arms were still wrapped around Cas, and with a surge of nerves he hadn’t felt since he was 16, he suddenly didn’t know where his hands should be.
By August, they’d made their way over to Niagara Falls, taking the scenic route on a trip to go visit Garth, Bess and the kids in Wisconsin. It was about time Castiel met his namesake. Dean couldn’t wait to see how much they’d grown.
It was a place for those with nowhere to go. For lost souls with no one to claim them, to waste away in an eternal dark slumber until there was nothing left. Unlike Heaven, or Hell, or Purgatory with its infinite torturous cycle of death and rebirth, there was no eternity here.
, now and always, grace notwithstanding – squinted in thought over whether to choose coconut cream or black raspberry. His eyes fell to the vial around Cas’s neck, one that glowed with swirls of golden grace, and absently touched the matching vial of blue that hung around his own neck.
He had to know. Had to know for certain it meant what he already knew it did. Cas was here. He could reach him, somehow. And this vampire was his first lead. His
But after everything, some small part of him had dreamt of apple pie and domesticity, and hoped it wasn’t true.
By the time October rolled around, they’d put a few thousand miles on Baby’s engine, and a few thousand more between them and their memories of the Empty.
And really, despite the uneventful night proving his nightmare was nothing more than a harmless dream, this motel room made every hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
They dropped the kids off at their grandmother’s house with no incidents, though Dean had to check the floor of the backseat twice to make sure Dylan didn’t try to take the machete with him. Dean would’ve let the kid take it, but he was fairly certain the boy’s grandmother would’ve had a heart attack at the sight of her grandson brandishing a giant blood-stained knife on her porch in the middle of the night.
The Empty’s demeanor inverted on a dime as it felt its grip loosening on Dean’s mind. The jovial mockery in its posture and tone snapped into a sinister rage, its sneer melting into a snarl. It was a sudden shift in temper Dean knew all too well from growing up on the wrong side of John’s fist. The Empty sprang forward, sinking its fingertips into Dean’s temples, burrowing down with its jagged nails.
Dean took another sip of beer, the lukewarm liquid tasting like a bag of stale, forgotten tortilla chips left under the seat of the Impala. It really was shit. But it was what they’d always drank at Bobby’s way back when. Back when Dean would sneak one out of the fridge as a teenager and Bobby would pretend not to notice, back when Dean would drink his frustrations away, back when Bobby would hand him a bottle on the back porch and just sit there in silence when he knew somehow that Dean just needed someone to
They know there’s an odd feeling around these parts. They know how the darkness creeps in further than it should, often winning out against any meager attempt to light your way. It’s silent save for the footsteps and breath of any unlucky stranger who wanders too close. A lone cricket will hesitantly chirp every now and then. But otherwise, it’s empty. You hear everything, and nothing. Just the inexplicable static of silence that’s somehow loud enough to drown out everything else.
He wouldn’t be silenced anymore. Dean’s hand loosened and fell from his lips, followed by a breathy “
Dean got better, over time. With each passing mile, each highway sign flying by the windows, Dean’s grip loosened on the wheel. His shoulders relaxed more. And finally, he felt safe enough to stay in real beds again, knowing he’d wake up with Cas’s heavy arm slung around him and his breath warm on his neck.
It grew brighter and brighter as he drew closer until the sheer sight of it scorched the void around it away.
“Cas!” Dean shouted, interrupting the Empty’s venomous retort. “Everything you’ve done, you’ve done because you believed it was right!” The words just tumbled out of him as he rushed to speak before the Empty could lash out again. “You sacrifice yourself over and over for everyone else.”
“Hm,” Sam mumbled, massaging his sore hand while he considered it. “What’s so special about the barn?”
The dog just tilted his head at Dean in confusion, in an oddly familiar way that sent a pang of grief right through his chest.
“What did it mean, ‘the crux of my guilt is still alive?’” Sam mused. “It can only manifest as the dead?”
An anxious hope flared through every nerve in Dean’s body. This could be it, this could be the first step in getting Cas back, could be his only hope to finding him, to undoing the damage he’d done, to finally telling him that he—
Richmond Hill, Georgia (seriously the worst motel I’ve ever stayed in, the doors didn’t lock and I slept with a knife under my pillow. But part of this fic was written in the middle of the night there, so I wanted to at least slide in a mention)
It became a daily ritual. Sleeping in late, coaxing Cas out with the promise of caffeine. He helped Sam, and soon Eileen, organize hunts and run dispatch for a growing network of hunters – first in the Midwest, then branching out further toward the coasts.
“Oh. Would this work?” Dean reached down into the collar of his undershirt and pulled out a long chain. A small vial dangled on the end, and inside it swirled a luminous blue substance that somehow straddled the line between liquid and light. It glowed a soft blue, and Dean could feel his palm tingle as his own blue light rose to the surface of his skin, as though it was drawn to the vial like a magnet.
“You’re not alone,” Dean stressed. “You have Jody and the girls, you have other universe Bobby and Charlie and all of those hunters
Dean couldn’t help the soft, reluctant smile that pulled at the corner of his mouth. Bobby looked just as he always did – clad in old flannel and a fishing vest, his face framed by a scruffy beard, and that old trucker’s hat Dean swore was older than he was perched on his head. The only difference now, was the long scythe Bobby leaned on like he’d always had it, like it was a part of himself, and Death’s large white ring around his finger.
“Okay,” Sam swallowed, shifting his weight nervously. He shook the small syringe they’d scrounged up out of a half-forgotten bag in Baby’s trunk, sloshing the meager amount of liquid around inside. It had been nestled in between the last few drops of holy oil and a congealed brew from fermented African Dream Root (or, root beer as Dean had once jokingly called it before taking a swig). It was in the Bag of Last Resorts, though neither of them would acknowledge that out loud. “Hopefully this is enough now.”
Not-Cas tipped its head back in laughter. It already knew the answer. It had taunted Dean once in a dream, dangling the truth of it just out of reach.
Sam punched the dash in fury. And again. And again. Dean knew if he weren’t driving, it may have been his face beneath Sam’s fist.
“You are broken,” it hissed from behind Cas’s face, the voice now coming from inside Dean’s mind as the Empty wrestled for control of his thoughts. “
not. He only had to figure out how to explain becoming an angel, going into the Empty alone, somehow rescuing Cas, and also not being strictly into, well,
Dean blinked hard through the dust and the specks of darkness starting to web in the edges of his vision. He clawed at the arm on his throat, but the vampire held firm. With every half-breath Dean gulped in, he felt his strength fade a little more.
Dean stepped off the patio and padded into the grass, giving himself enough space to examine the … wings.
It laughed, a humorless, hollow, chilling noise like bones rattling in a tinderbox, a noise that should never come out of a human body. Then, suddenly, its explanation came not as words, but as a knowing in their minds.
“I died, now I’m back,” Dean said, taking what he hoped seemed like a casual sip from his beer. “It’s all good.”
Where his wings had once felt like hope, like a promise to set things right, to rescue Cas, they now felt like a burden. His wings weighed heavy on his shoulders in more ways than one.
maneuver when he’d realized he was about to crash. Of course he’d break something on his first time in the air – he knew he just wasn’t meant to fly.
“Morning, sunshine,” Sam smirked, nodding over his shoulder in greeting. He’d probably been up for hours already. The kid was always raring to go at the crack of dawn. A trait Dean neither understood nor envied.
“The Winchesters killed Reid, you know that,” Derek said as his eyes watered. “Reid’s dead. I wish I never hung up the phone.”
“Thank you. I do really like it a lot myself,” Castiel said as he put his shirt back on. “What tattoo would you get if you ever got one?”
Dean froze when he saw Jack and Peter handcuffed together. He tried to hide his smirk as he put the boxes of pizza on the table.
“You should rest, sweetie pie. Teleporting and using your powers like this is exhausting,” Rowena said after noticing Cas getting up from the table.
I hope you liked the story though!!! I did enjoy writing it until the ending stressed me out. But it was fun to write regardless.
“Being touched again after…after him…it took some getting used to,” Peter admitted. “But I can be touched now, so that’s some progress. He did…Skip did…handcuff me…once. I can’t…not again.”
“I brought you a few books,” Sam said as he turned around in his chair to grab the books from the table.
“Are you really bisexual or was that a lie meant to distract him like you said we were doing?” Castiel asked.
“And he did,” Rowena said before she looked at Cas. “But sweetie, I could have gotten here quickly.”
Reid got jolted out of his thoughts about the Winchesters when he got pushed into a room. Reid stumbled and caught his footing before he looked around the room. The room was big. It had mats all over the floor too.
Reid felt his stomach turn as he thought of the fact that he was now one of their victims. He tried to take a deep breath to calm down but struggled because of the gag. Nothing dangerous or life threatening, but between the gag and the air quality in the room he was trapped in, along with the anxiety that he was dealing with, he was gonna have a difficult time breathing. And he was gonna have a difficult time calming down.
“Oh my god, I’ve been texting bees for a day,” Dean said before he ran his hand through his hair. “I gotta sit down.”
Derek wanted to know who Sam was. At least if they knew who this Sam girl was, then she could maybe answer the questions. Why did Reid leave and not respond to texts or calls? What was going on?
“Dean and I are not dating, I assure you of that. And no, I’m not skipping school. I’ve never found the point in skipping school because when you miss one day of school, you miss quite a lot and that can get overwhelming,” Castiel said.
made me bring him all around the world on a month long vacation,” Castiel said as he glared at Dean.
“Listen, I really do care about your exhaustion and I would usually drag your ass to your room so I would force you to sleep, but we need to talk right now,” Dean said.
Dean pulled out his phone and called one of the numbers. He impatiently waited for the ringing to stop.
Reid’s anxiety screamed again. He couldn’t see what was Sam doing. He heard something clatter on the table. Reid’s mind automatically went to a table filled with torture devices and knives and guns. He didn’t know what to expect.
Reid’s limbs kept shaking the colder it got in the room. He tried to look around for any details about the room but only got met with darkness. He saw the vague outline of a symbol on the floor but couldn’t make out what it was. He felt his stomach turn again when he noticed that there were chains hanging on the wall.
“Yes,” Dean said, his tone full of annoyance. “What is this, 20 questions? Stop asking me questions.”
“No,” Sam said with a glare. “Just…Poughkeepsie. That’ll be the code word. If we text you Poughkeepsie, it means we’re fine.”
This made Sam stop in his tracks. The truth spell made sure Dean couldn’t tell a lie. And since Dean was currently telling him that it’s okay to have these feelings, it meant that he hadn’t inherited their father’s homophobic beliefs.
“Dizzy, probably from stress,” Dean said before he sat on the floor and noticed a pair of handcuffs on the floor. “God, this whole place is…”
The most Reid could do right now was eat the breakfast he was given. It smelled good. And he was starving. And dehydrated.
“Well you still got a few minutes before we hit the university so take that nap if you want,” Dean said.
“Of course. I do have quite a habit of coming back from the dead,” Castiel said before smiling at Dean.
“Yes, I’m aware of that since Dean just said that, but…you consider Jack your son?” Castiel asked Dean.
“He’s locked himself in his room a lot,” Dean said sadly. “I keep checking on him. He’s researching something on his laptop.”
Jack nodded and left the kitchen. He headed upstairs to his room and walked inside. Peter was on the bed and wiping away his tears.
Dean glanced at Sam holding Reid’s hand. He didn’t say anything. He wanted to talk to Sam about him coming out last night but never got the chance before Sam bolted out of the kitchen and hid in his room all night.
“Why do you have handcuffs?” Peter asked awkwardly as he stopped looking through random drawers in Jack’s house.
Sam and Dean made their way to the basement door and opened it. They slowly walked down the stairs and went towards the wall. Sam pulled the coat hook and watched the wall click open.
If the Winchesters believed this symbol stopped possession, then that could mean they want Reid safe. That could also mean that they wouldn’t hurt Reid.
“This has to be the witch’s curse messing with his head. Even my brother wouldn’t have this bad of an idea,” Sam said to himself.
“The second thing,” Dean said before running his hand through his hair. “I just…I…I like Cas and he certainly likes me, I think. Crap now I’m doubting it. Anyway, what do I do?”
and when I say extremely I mean extremely, detailed explanation of how honeybees work. If that wasn’t a red flag, I don’t know what is. And it ended up talking about bears at one point, which is fucking weird. And it talked about pollinating flowers for like 3 hours. Like this was the weirdest shit I’ve ever seen, and trust me, I’ve seen some weird shit on the internet. But this has to be in the top 3,” Dean said.
“My phone wouldn’t be in the basement if you hadn’t pushed me. And it also wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t break into the basement, so you’re getting it,” Sam said.
Reid put his phone in his pocket. He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath, him breathing in the chilled air.
Reid went to say something but decided not to risk it. He didn’t want to piss Dean off, or risk getting locked in that room again. He hated that room.
Reid got brought back to the situation at hand when he heard Dean opening a door. Reid got pushed inside the room before the light turned on.
Hotch froze as Garcia started typing on her tablet. He knew the name. Sam Winchester. Serial killer. Legally died after him and his brother went on a killing spree and died in police custody. They we’re going to investigate the case but they never got the chance. After the Winchesters died, they still had open cases with actual alive unsubs. So they never looked into it.
“Um…I don’t know,” Castiel said awkwardly. “Sam, I know we’re best friends but that’s a weird question, even for you.”
“He’s added to the list. Anything else, darling?” Crowley asked. “Want to be his warden or something?”
“I don’t like answering questions while under a truth spell,” Dean snapped before realizing what he had said.
“How can I not?” Reid asked into the phone. “Our John Doe was found holding a machete over six bodies. My brain keeps on trying to piece everything together and nothing is making sense.”
Dean had immediately gone into Sam’s room once he heard the entire story and said ‘want to help me kill someone’ to which Sam replied with ‘did they hurt anyone?’ Dean didn’t want to spread Peter’s trauma around so he just mentioned that the guy they were going after hurts kids. That got Sam’s attention pretty quickly. Sam agreed almost instantly.
“Alright then. I gotta take out the trash,” Bobby said as he left his office and went into the kitchen, Sam running after him.
“Plus any awkwardness would be chalked up to you being around Cas so I think this is a good idea,” Sam said.
Sam got pulled out of his thoughts when they walked into a room in the bunker. Sam felt Reid twitch and tightened his grip slightly to make sure Reid didn’t run away.
Dean nodded. He got up from the chair, Sam doing the same. Sam stumbled and held onto the table, Dean’s protective older brother instincts kicking in.
Sam didn’t seem upset or angry or pissed off. He seemed like he cared about Reid. And the part of Reid’s brain that did care for Sam hated this. If Sam didn’t like Reid, maybe Reid’s brain wouldn’t be like this. Maybe he wouldn’t be in love with-
Sam groaned. Why was he awake right now? Sam usually slept through the night. It’s not like he hadn’t gone to bed not even an hour ago so he shouldn’t be awake.
“Damn you have some lungs on you,” Dean said after twitching from the yell. “Yes, dumbass, we’re in California. I told you we were going.”
“It’s just a question. How about you, Bobby? What would your M.O be?” Sam asked, Dean’s body tensing up.
Reid noticed Dean’s reaction. Dean was getting pissed off. Reid dreaded annoying the Winchester but he needed information, so he had to keep pushing.
“Their uncle has a secret torture room in the basement of their house so Sam and Dean were wondering if he was a serial killer,” Castiel said.
“Next time, tell me when you’re going to leave and go kill someone. I’d like to know so I’m not surprised,” Castiel said.
Sam went to say something but stopped himself. He realized why Reid was asking him this question. Sam had looked into Reid’s file and saw the previous drug addiction note. He felt bad for Reid, he really did. Sam had struggled with addiction before too, with the demon blood. They were more alike than he realized.
“Hey, I got a question. Do you still have that position available?” Sam asked into the phone. “Is or something easy, like you can’t screw it up no matter how hard you try?”
Reid sat up. He was covered in blankets. The last thing he remembered was being in the bathroom. He remembers the heat of the water from the sink. And then…lights out.
Sam wanted this whole situation to be over as soon as possible. He was tired of it. So he agreed to take the easy way out. Which would be a big mistake.
Reid often studied cases when he couldn’t sleep. He found his mind going back to the Winchesters quite a few times. He found their story interesting to say the least. The best story he could come up with was that after their mother died, their father snapped, probably aided by PTSD from being a marine. And he raised Sam and Dean into killing. Or maybe he abused them and then they both snapped and killed him. Reid often got a headache from reading their case file.
“No, he didn’t. His wife died and his daughter ran away at a young age. We were all he had,” CAS said.
Dean fumbled for his phone from his pocket, him struggling a lot due to the handcuffs. He stumbled and dropped his cellphone, along with falling on the floor and knocking himself out.
“Look, I panicked,” Dean said. “And now we’re training him to be a hunter. Can you help with the tattoo or not? It’s not exactly like we can take him to a real tattoo place.”
Dean made his way down the hallway. He opened the door and saw Reid scrambling away from him and bumping into the wall.
“Hey, Cas, what’s…what’s up?” Dean asked as he tried to hide the fact that he was washing blood off of his hands.
Peter knew how that sounded to someone who hasn’t caught the full conversation. He smiled at that. That would definitely be awkward to explain.
Sam mumbled something as he woke up. He blinked his eyes and jumped slightly when he realized he wasn’t anywhere familiar.
Dean woke up slowly to a beeping noise. He blinked his eyes and saw Sam sitting next to him in a chair.
“One in a lifetime because we’re lucky to be alive,” Dean retorted. “And also, being locked in there and handcuffed isn’t fun, Sammy, trust me on that.”
“Yeah, you are,” Morgan reassured. “Listen…you’re dehydrated a little bit and there’s bruises on your wrists and ankles.”
Reid nearly jumped out of his skin when Dean had walked in. He was already on edge and Dean bursting into the room like he just did didn’t help at all.
“Well anyway,” Sam said awkwardly. “Yellow Eyes was a serial killer who kidnapped and tortured women mostly. It was his thing. He was never caught though. He actually owned this house. Isn’t it amazing that we found his actual torture room? That’s like…a once in a lifetime opportunity.”
“Did something happen, with handcuffs?” Jack asked hesitantly. “It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.”
“I get that, Dean,” Sam said with a smile. “I mean why are we in the impala and where are we going?”
Peter rubbed his eyes and sniffled again. He closed his eyes as the memories of Skip flooded back to him.
Sam started snickering. As much as Cas’ zero filter policy was a hit to the chest at times, it was definitely amusing to watch. Especially when Cas was talking to Dean.
Reid liked how brains forgot for a split second about a situation when they first wake up. It was almost like a sense of peace. You forget about an injury you have, or something incredibly stressful. Or in this case, you forget you’ve been kidnapped by two serial killers who are probably going to torture you for an extended period of time.
“He was looking through drawers and found the handcuffs. And then we both grabbed them and they locked onto us,” Jack explained.
Reid frantically looked around the room he was in as he struggled against the restraints. He quickly gave up as he realized he was chained up and not tied with rope or tape, which he probably could have managed to get out of.
“I wanna see a body,” Dean said as his eyes watered. “It’s the only way I’ll believe my son is dead.”
“Alright, idjits, I got the paperwork and the person who owned the house before your parents was…Jack Vaughan,” Bobby said as he walked back into the room.
Sam held out his hand. Reid slowly grabbed it and instantly felt a wave of…calmness. It was weird. Holding Sam’s hand made him feel calm.
“Agent Rossi. It’s Dr. Smith, the coroner. You said to call if any more information came up on Jack’s body,” he said.
“Are you okay?” Reid hesitantly asked Dean, who did a double take. “Losing a…losing a kid…is difficult.”
Reid looked up at Sam, his eyes puffy. Reid had been crying. Sam didn’t blame him. Reid seemed like the type to cry when stressed. And this definitely was a stressful situation.
Sam got blinded by the sunlight, it providing enough of a distraction for him to get dragged out of the trunk without any trouble. Sam looked at the car and froze.
“It’s going fine, I assure you,” Castiel said. “I was surprised that you invited me over because whenever I try to talk to you, you end up running into the nearest wall. I was wondering if your field of vision was damaged after a few walls because you’re very clumsy.”
Sam heard Reid mumble something. He slowly blinked his eyes open and froze when he saw Sam sitting there.
Sam escorted Reid out of the room, mostly by pulling his arm. Sam could feel how numb Reid’s arm was. Restraints did that. He pulled Reid out of the dungeon and into the storage room.
Sam saw the two men whisper something to each other. He couldn’t hear what they said but he felt his heart drop when one of them smiled at him.
“Well I was handcuffed to a bed at one point. And his brother, Dean, did hit me and dislocate my wrist. But I’m fine,” Reid said before smiling. “Other than that, I spent most of my time locked in a room. But Sam did give me a few books so that was nice. The encyclopedia on the Loch Ness monster was interesting.”
“Maybe they…Stockholm syndrome maybe,” Derek whispered before he looked at Reid with a worried expression.
“Great. I’m gonna have a monster movie marathon if you and Jack wanna join in,” Dean said with a smile.
“Sweetie, it’s perfectly alright to care and be protective of someone,” Rowena said. “And it’s perfectly normal to doubt yourself after something happened.”
Reid looked at the plate from the bed. Waffles? He hadn’t expected to be fed. But then again, if the Winchesters wanted to prolonge this, they had to keep him alive. And being alive meant you needed food. Reid also noticed the water bottle next to the plate.
Dean went to say something but got cut off by his phone going off. He slowly read through the long text and froze.
Castiel and Crowley climbed out of the car and walked to the door. They knocked before Bobby opened it.
Reid rubbed his eyes and blinked them. He tried to push away the thoughts and feelings for Sam that he had but he couldn’t help it. Reid threw it off as Stockholm syndrome. Sam was nice to Reid. He was far nicer than Dean was. Sam cared about him. Reid’s brain did have feelings for him.
Reid didn’t know whether to be honest or not. He decided to lie. Reid nodded to tell he was fine. His mind was still working up the courage to talk again.
I’m so sorry to end the story like this. Like I literally couldn’t come up with another idea in my head tbh. And it was kinda stressing me out too because I just wanted to finish the story but this was the only ending I could think of.
“I wanted to spend time with yo-” Dean said before he quickly covered his mouth to stop himself from talking.
“Because it’s a nice color,” Bobby said slowly. “Are you okay, kid? You’ve been acting weird ever since I got home.”
“It’s perfectly fine, as long as it’s supervised by someone who knows what their doing, like me,” Rowena said. “I need a few more ingredients.”
“Why would I?” Sam asked. “It’s your life. Your coming out. And besides, if I did say anything, I’d risk dad overhearing and…I couldn’t risk that, Dean.”
Sam knew Reid was lying. Who would be fine after being kidnapped? No one. Sam got up from the chair he sat down in and walked over to the table.
“Everything’s blurry,” Dean said tiredly. “Definitely another concussion. At least I didn’t get it walking into the wall after seeing you.”
“Look, I’m okay. The witch’s curse messed with me but I’m good now,” Dean said. “It’s fine. I’ll tell a lie. Um…I hate cheeseburgers. See? I can lie. I’m all good.”
Dean didn’t want to bother Sam because he knew how hard that was, to keep something so hidden from everyone. So he just let Sam be in his room. He’d talk to Dean when he was ready. Whether that be in an hour or a month, when Sam was ready, he would talk to Dean.
But he couldn’t think about that right now. He needed to answer Sam’s question. Was he okay? Reid didn’t even know how to answer that if he was being honest with himself. He was kidnapped, but…Sam was…
Reid made his way inside and anxiously grabbed the handle on the sink. He turned the water on and felt the warm water hit his body. His hands were freezing. He needed to warm them up.
“Man, I hate having conversations with you when you’re sleep deprived. You don’t remember a thing,” Dean said to himself before rubbing his eyes. “Look. The bot is alive or something, so we’re going to check it out. I already talked to Jimmy about it and he’s fine with us stopping by.”
Sam hung up the phone. Dean kept on tapping his leg as Sam typed on his phone. He stared at his screen before putting his phone back in his pocket.
“His name is…CAS-TL. What the f…” Dean said to himself before he rubbed his eyes. “Whatever. Money is money.”
Reid noticed Sam often asked if he was okay. He wondered why that was. What Reid would probably never figure out is that the reason why Sam was doing that is because Sam knows how bad anxiety is. And he doesn’t want Reid dealing with that too. Sam has been through enough mental health issues in his life. No one deserves that. So he was checking in with Reid to make sure he was okay.
Jack looked at Dean with a confused expression. Dean reciprocated before going back to unlocking the handcuffs.
“The bees talk to the computer and the computer tells me what they’re saying. So now I’m talking to you,” Jimmy said. “Hello, Dean. It’s nice to meet you. I have quite enjoyed our talks. Thank you for letting me talk about honey. No one seems to care.”
“Sammy. Sam went upstairs for a paper clip last night and never came back,” Dean said as Cas and Crowley helped him off the floor.
“I can’t believe this,” Castiel said as he glared at Dean. “Actually I can because of Winchester stupidity.”
He hadn’t expected to be asked that. Maybe that was apart of the Winchesters tactics. Be nice. And then the torture. Maybe they liked creating a Stockholm effect in their victims before they killed them. Reid dreaded being a victim of the Winchesters, especially one who’s succumbed to Stockholm syndrome.
As much as Sam looked up to his brother, which he would never admit to anyone, Dean was a dumbass at times. Sam rubbed his eyes to try and wake himself up more, and to try and get rid of the stress headache he was currently getting.
“I started to realize the limitations of communicating through chat. So I created this headset,” Jimmy said before grabbing an earpiece and putting it on.
Dean stared at Sam, who was staring at his computer while sitting at the table. He snapped his fingers to get Sam’s attention but failed.
Sam blinked his eyes and jumped when he realized he was in the trunk of a car. He struggled against the ropes around his wrists.
“Because I have to communicate with this thing, Sammy,” Dean said. “I kinda wanna know what exactly I’m communicating with.”
Sam and Dean quickly ran out of the room. Dean closed the door as Sam ran up the stairs. Dean ran after his brother and into the kitchen.
“Do you think Sam Winchester could have…stolen the body?” Emily asked as she tried to keep herself composed.
“It’s okay. It’s okay,” Sam said calmly after noticing Reid’s reaction. “It’s okay. I only handcuffed you to make sure that you stayed in bed all night. Trust me when I tell you I’ve had my fair share of passing out and I didn’t want you walking around the room and possibly hurting yourself even more.”
Peter had been too anxious and focused on not trying to break down crying to notice that Dean was right by the door. Peter probably would have cried more if he knew Dean had overheard. Skip had messed with his head and said if anyone knew, that he would be called ‘disgusting’ and ‘a whore’ and everything in between. The only reason he could actually talk about it was because it was Jack that he was with. Peter had always been comfortable around Jack, so he was comfortable talking about his trauma with him.
At least, that was until he noticed all the bodies were laying in the same direction. As if … they were pointing to something. They’d seemed haphazardly strewn around the warehouse at first, but the deeper he moved into the room, the more clear the picture became. They were
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, and he meant it. He meant it with every fiber of his being. He wished it could’ve been different.
. Dean nodded and set his empty bottle down gently on the patio’s stained wooden planks. That made sense. His whole life had been a mission – it’s what drove him, gave him purpose. Now, there was none of that.
to hear it. But it was too much, all at once. It felt almost painful, like coming in from the cold and sticking your hands into hot water. It burned rather than soothed.
He knelt there next to Sam, knowing his final moments with his brother were quickly ticking away. Waiting for his reaper felt both excruciatingly slow (
, it screamed into their thoughts, and the sound raked across Dean’s nerves like shards of glass scraping down metal.
Dean shrugged, the heat of embarrassment crawling up his back. “Kid had trouble sleeping.” He scrubbed a hand across the back of his neck. “It worked with Sam when he was little.”
Dean fought to breathe, fought to scream, to yell, to curse, to bite – but the hand sealed his mouth shut and locked his voice away. Dean was silenced.
Dean wished he had a book to throw at Sam’s head. He opened his mouth to reply, but Cas beat him to it.
The next few hours were painfully, thankfully, uneventful. Dean had punched the stereo back on, and Sam had started sifting through Dad’s journal and some other texts he’d brought along to get a head start on the case.
When he’d lost Lisa, it was though he’d been punched in the heart. When he’d lost Cas, it was though his heart had crumpled and turned to dust, with particles so fine it could never be pieced back together.
Annoyance trickled into his senses. Whoever it was, they were slamming the door so hard it sent a jolt through his body.
He watched Bobby lean the scythe up against the outside of Harvelle’s Roadhouse with an uncharacteristic quiet.
By September, as the heavy humid summer nights slipped into the crisp cool air of fall, they’d finished their first hunt in a long time. It had been weeks since the hunter network Sam and Eileen were running had put out a bulletin nearby. Dean found he wasn’t seeking out hunts anymore, but if one came their way, they grabbed it.
The sudden brightness of it was blinding. He landed hard on a neatly manicured lawn on a sunny weekday afternoon, surrounded by the charred corpses of dead angels. Dean sprang to his feet. He didn’t take time to examine the scene. This illusion wasn’t meant for him – it wouldn’t last long. As soon as he broke into this memory, the timer was set, and the seconds ticked down to a gory reveal he sure as hell didn’t want to see.
Back then, Dean had hoped there had been more meaning behind the gesture than just a war tactic. Turns out, he was right.
. Where he’d been used to seeing a black sky with just a few pinpricks of light, here he couldn’t count the stars if he tried. The sky was marbled with hues of deep purples and pinks and blues and specked with brilliant yellows and whites. The Milky Way stretched across the sky like a scar, but a beautiful one. Like a scar the world chose to bear, and show only to those who cared enough to look.
On a whim, he pressed his foot on the corpse’s leg, and felt the same pressure on his own leg – right in the same spot.
It only took about an hour of being in that motel room – one that smelled faintly of mold and mildew – for panic to rise and crash down over him like a wave. Cas had stepped into the room after grabbing their bags out of the Impala to find Dean kneeling in front of the bathroom sink, his hands thrust under the freezing water from the faucet in a desperate attempt to ground himself.
There was one name that had briefly given it pause as it had stalked through the tangled undergrowth behind neatly manicured lawns in the deep south, stolen land once soaked in gore, now watered with greed.
“Hey, boy,” he said as he leaned down to ruffle the fur behind the dog’s ears. “Were you checkin’ up on me?” At least
If Sam looked like he was struggling to process the absolute onslaught of information before, now he looked like he’d completely stopped functioning.
The boy looked down at the machete like he’d just realized what he’d been holding this whole time. “I did what you said,” he said, his voice eerily calm and quiet as he stared unblinking at the blade. Poor kid had already been through hell, and now he had to live with
, man?” Dean spitting and wiping the water out of his eyes. “How many times do we gotta go through this?”
“Shut up,” Dean grumbled, rolling his shoulders again to tuck his wings fully out of sight. He swore he could see a flicker of disappointment flash across Cas’s face. “And pick up some of these books. You really let this place go while I was gone.”
Sam’s steeled defiance shifted to something uncertain. Sam didn’t know who – or what – she was referring to. He couldn’t hear anything but Dean. He eyed his older brother with a new wariness and distrust that, in any other scenario, would’ve cut Dean to his core.
Dean was wrong about this room. This, while certainly one of Cas’s most hurtful and troubling memories, wasn’t his greatest regret. It was simply another device meant to torture him, an appetizer for the main course.
“Jack rewrote the rules,” Bobby continued on, still sitting casually in the patio chair. Concern wrinkled in the lines around his eyes, but he didn’t intervene. He couldn’t if he tried. This was far above his pay grade. “Said it wasn’t fair that only God could create angels. How’d he put it?” Bobby tapped the armrest of his chair in thought. “'The most righteous souls, the most loving, the most
“It’s all me,” Dean said. “Courtesy of Jack, I guess. Kid went all Tolstoy on the rules. God’s not the one creating angels anymore. It’s sorta left up to us. All of us. People, I mean.”
“Mn… no,” Dean managed grit out between his teeth. Cas was running on almost zero angel mojo. He didn’t want him wasting a single drop of what little grace he had left on this—on something he could now heal himself. Dean gripped Cas’s wrist and squeezed, then closed his eyes and focused. He felt a calm warmth rise from where his palm was pressed against his cheek, a comforting heat as the shards of splintered bone in his jaw fused back together.
, Dean’s wings burst out from where he’d tucked them out of sight in the ether, and before he could blink, he was at Cas’s side.
How Cas should’ve just let Billie take him right there and then. Going out in a blaze of glory after mortally wounding Death herself. Fitting, right? That’s how Dean was always supposed to go out: locked in battle, still swinging, throwing his broken body on the sword just to save a world that wouldn’t do the same for him in return.
Bobby just looked at the vial, then to Dean, and back again. A fondness spread across his face, and he chuckled as he pieced together what exactly Dean had been wearing around his neck for God knows how long. He should’ve known. He
-Cas – speak. The Winchesters had probably killed more monsters over the years than any other pair of hunters and yet – this vampire was so scared of whatever was haunting this place she damn near volunteered to be their prisoner.
Jenny froze, her eyes blown wide. She stared at Dean, her jaw falling slack, her fangs retracting involuntarily over her teeth. She said nothing, but Dean suddenly knew the truth of what had just happened deep in his bones.
They were still frozen, still standing there hunched over, their arms dangling in the air, unmoving. As if… as if the Empty could only consciously control one of Cas’s regrets at a time. Dean reached up and touched the hinge of his jaw – the spot that had been shattered just moments ago, the spot where a deep blue-black bruise bloomed on every copy of himself around him – and a plan flickered into his thoughts.
All of the corpses were arranged in a massive spiral, a collection of macabre arrows all pointing to a chair in the center of the room.
He ducked down one of the bunker’s many hallways, half-drifting around the turn as his boots lost traction on the slippery tile, and suddenly he wasn’t in the bunker anymore.
There was a power in that, in unwavering truth. A power the Empty could not fathom. Castiel took solace in that knowledge as the Empty convulsed into a frenzy of needles and knives and claws.
Except he didn’t fully believe the whole strong bravado façade anymore. His false confidence had been shattered. He didn’t feel whole. It felt like a piece of himself had been permanently damaged the second the Empty came through that wall. All because Castiel had confessed to Dean that he loved him.
“Those kids?” Dean asked, shutting his eyes for a moment. The words stung bitter on his tongue. His job was about saving people, and that meant everyone – and while he wasn’t a father, there was something about monsters who hurt kids that made him so angry his teeth ached.
“Your way in? Yep,” Bobby said, pulling a wad of folded paper out of his vest pocket. “I took the liberty of lifting Sam’s notes from the Impala before I picked you up at the barn. That’s what took me so long. Thought they’d come in handy, an’ they did.” He glanced down at Sam’s scribbled writing, which was organized at first before being messily annotated in the margins with three different colored inks. The kid was detailed, all right, albeit disorganized. “Says here the Empty lures people in by manipulatin’ silence. So it only made sense to me that speakin’ truth would do the opposite.”
A strong arm wrapped firmly around Dean’s torso, pulling him just out of reach of his phone. “Hey,” Dean scolded softly.
Cas reached into the bag to pull out a rainbow-colored wristband; in Dean’s bag, there was one striped with pink and purple and blue.
It was soft, at first. Still a little hesitant. He pressed his lips lightly against Cas’s, and he could feel his heart hammering against his ribs as he deepened the kiss. It only took a moment for that brief panic of ‘
As Dean lifted his foot off the gas to give up, Not-Cas’s arm bent backwards at the elbow, and it raised its hand in a sickening, broken wave.
He barely had time to swear under his breath as he fumbled for the gearshift, shoving his uninjured left hand awkwardly under the wheel to reach it. Something wet suddenly slapped against the back passenger window Jenny had been transfixed on. Two hands, loose skin pocked with blisters, pressed into the glass and smeared it with blackened pus.
This was the life he’d always thought he’d wanted, but it was hollow without Sam. Without Cas, as fledgling as their relationship had been back then, it felt empty.
Sam finished bandaging Dean’s hand and whirled around, his face scrunched up with anger. “Tell me what you know,” Sam snarled. “Or you’ll end up like the rest of your nest.” He tilted his head toward the bodies strewn across the barn.
He shifted around some more before giving up on sleep altogether – he didn’t feel tired anyway. He didn’t feel much of anything, really, except his joints screamed every time he moved.
“That actually makes sense,” Jenny said, rubbing her forehead from where she’d been thrown face first into the back of their seats. “I don’t feel guilty for offing her – that bitch had it coming – but when Luther started freaking out … when it started to tear apart my nest – my
The routine continued as the months went by. Dean went on a few hunts at first, swooping in to kick the shit out of a few wayward demons and lay a few ghosts to rest. He had wings, but still insisted on driving for days – a decision Sam didn’t get, but Cas didn’t mind, since it meant a lot of time nestled close to Dean on the Impala’s front bench seat (and more often than not, the backseat too).
He couldn’t see Sam – the barn had fuzzed out of his vision as the Empty’s poisonous ooze seared into his corneas.
“I burned your body,” Sam said, jabbing Dean in the chest with the pan. Sam scowled when nothing happened.
“Come now,” he heard Cas rasp. It wasn’t coming from the phone anymore, but from right outside the door.
By June, Dean and Cas met up with Claire and Kaia for lunch at a tiny red hut somewhere near the coast of Maine in a town Dean didn’t dare try to pronounce. Cas had seemed suspicious about eating shellfish out of what he’d referred to as a glorified fisherman’s shack, but the noise he made during that first bite of buttery lobster roll was damn near pornographic.
“We just passed the exits for Dayton, so…” Sam bobbed his head as he worked out the math. “About three hours.”
Bobby waved a hand dismissively. “S’fine. Thanks for rescuin’ other me outta Apocalypse World. I’m just glad you stopped at there bein’ two of me. That’s more’n enough.”
Bobby wheezed, lifting his hat and wiping the tears from his face with the back of his hand. He grinned at Dean. “Fair ‘nough.”
It was here that Cas insisted they had to go to freakin’ Canada to see the falls, because: “Dean, the pamphlet says that side is better.”
The grace around his neck burned as a warning as the thing grew closer. Dean winced, raising his hands and ready to cut his fists on the teeth of this thing’s jawline, when the necklace suddenly seemed to pull his attention elsewhere.
“Fuck, no, just let me…” He took in another deep breath to ground himself. “I’ve gone too long without saying it.”
Dean didn’t answer. He kept his eyes on the road in front of him, the knuckles of his hand turning white as he squeezed the steering wheel until he thought it would crack.
The soul began to flicker far more than usual, its light wavering, struggling against the encroaching dark.
But the universe had never been that kind to him. Dean’s heart pounded in his chest. He forced himself to open his eyes, and came face to face with the lifeless husk of himself.
He felt Cas’s shoulder flex, followed by a growl of frustration. Dean shot a look over his shoulder, and caught Cas looking down at an empty hand.
He caught his balance, quick to heal his broken hand and bruised knee. There was probably a much better, less painful way to test his theory. But it was too late for that.
Dean flexed his hand, and felt the cool metal of his angel blade slide down into his grip. This was the first chance he really got to look at it. The blade looked like it was carved from obsidian. The weapon was a deep, inky black, but when he turned it in his hands, it caught the light from the warehouse’s harsh fluorescents and shimmered streaks of teals and purples and golds as though it contained galaxies of its own.
.” Dylan waved his hand in front of his brother’s face. After a moment, Tommy looked up at his little brother, his eyes struggling to focus. “Where does Nana live?”
“I forget how weak and stupid you humans are,” she mused, curling her lip up in disdain. “A vampire never forgets a scent, though I doubt even a dumb mangy ‘wolf could forget a Winchester stench.”
“Oh my god, Dean, they’re bees!” Sam said loudly with an almost dumbfounded look on his face. “Are you fucking dumb?”
The dungeon was freezing. It was incredibly freezing. This room though, it was warm. There was a bed with thick blankets on it. And there was another door in the room.
“Hey, we’re back,” Dean called out as he walked into the kitchen. “Sam ditched me for the library so he’s not eating dinner. I’ll bring him food later since he tends to forget to eat food when he goes all nerd.”
“My phone isn’t in my pocket,” Sam said as he felt his pants. “Oh my god, it probably fell out when I fell in the basement.”
“Great. Yeah. My brother needs a job,” Sam said. “Yeah that brother. No, not the one who lives down south with his two roommates, but the one who…yeah that one. I’ll give you his contact information. Thanks.”
“Relax, no need to worry about that. I had Cas make sure you were okay,” Sam said. “How are you feeling?”
Peter sniffled and took a deep breath. His breathing was still a little shaky, but he wasn’t full on hyperventilating anymore so that was progress.
Reid stayed silent. Maybe Sam has been at the receiving end of Dean’s anger before and gotten desensitized to it.
“This argument isn’t dumb or ass,” Castiel retorted before he looked at Dean. “Dean, in his infinite wisdom, kidnapped someone.”
Sam nodded in response. Sam was exhausted. He was exhausted physically. He was exhausted mentally. He was tired of the witch’s curse and he was tired of stressing about the whole Reid situation. Sam rubbed his eyes.
Reid moved as far away from Sam as he possibly could. Reid was still on the bed, but the bed was against the wall. So he couldn’t move very far.
When Sam had explained the hex bag to Dean, Dean froze for a second. Sam had asked him what was wrong, and thankfully because of the truth spell Dean answered honestly. The answer wasn’t what Sam had expected though. Dean asked if he liked Reid. And Sam…Sam couldn’t answer that.
Reid blinked his eyes and saw bright lights all around him. He jumped before hearing a familiar voice.
“Dean’s resting. The potion does take quite a lot out of you so he’ll be tired for a few days,” Rowena said.
Thankfully, the way the dungeon was designed, the chair was bolted to the floor so whoever was tied to it was facing the wall. That wasn’t a positive for the person in the chair, not knowing who was behind you, but it provided a way for Sam to mentally prepare himself without getting stared at.
“JJ, talk to Jack and see if you can get any information about the Winchesters from him. Who knows, maybe he’ll tell us something.”
“Reid’s told me about the Winchesters before, Hotch. He says that he hasn’t found any M.O or consistency,” Derek said. “He’s studied their case files before when he’s bored.”
Cas glanced at Jack and Peter as they walked into the kitchen. He turned back to Dean and noticed the blood.
Dean grabbed the key and unlocked the handcuffs on Peter’s wrist. Before he could even get to unlock Jack from the handcuffs, Peter had run out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
Sam rolled his eyes before Dean pushed him out of the way. Sam stumbled and bumped into the wall. He grabbed the coat hook on the wall and fell on the floor when it moved.
“Sweetie, I’ve been seeing auras for years. Yours is quite obvious that you’re in love,” Rowena said.
“Reid? Is everything okay?” Hotch asked. “You didn’t show up for work. Morgan was going to stop by your apartment but we figured you were sleeping.”
“Is that good? I think that’s good,” Dean said to himself quietly. “God, this is so freaking weird.”
Reid flinched when the door unlocked and opened. He was still covered in blankets, which was kind of a blessing in his opinion. The Winchesters would have to rip off the blankets to get to him.
Dean glanced over at his phone and saw the notes he quickly typed up during his texting with Sam’s friend that hooked him up with the job.
“No, you’re not. Rowena said to take it easy. This plus your anxiety, you’re not going in that room. I’ll be calling his team,” Dean said.
“No, don’t-” Sam said before getting cut off by Reid jolting awake. “That’s what’ll happen if you burn it.”
But Reid couldn’t exactly say no. He could, but the Winchesters wouldn’t listen. They’d probably just tie him down and knock him out. Or maybe they wouldn’t even knock him out. Maybe they’d enjoy watching Reid suffer through the pain.
Dean closed the door and saw Sam whisper something. He noticed the symbol on the door glow before fading.
He slowly walked closer to the hostage and saw them twitch and mumble something through the gag. Sam sighed.
Sam glared at Dean. Of course he locked their now hostage in the dungeon. Why didn’t Dean put him anywhere nicer? The dungeon is freezing. Sam definitely planned on moving him out of there, if not for their hostages benefit, then for Sam’s. If Sam would have to keep going in there, and he probably would, Sam would be dreading getting a PTSD flashback to the cage because of the cold. Sam twitched at the thought.
Reid felt his heart drop. They were keeping him. For how long? Reid’s anxiety told him that would be forever.
“No, he can’t. Because someone outside of this house needs to know that we’re doing this. So Cas, go home. If we don’t text you or call saying we’re fine, then get help because then we’re probably dead. Okay?”
“What? I’m not an idiot, Dean. I saw the way you looked at some guys in high school. It was the same way you looked at girls,” Sam said.
Reid turned back and stared as he watched the shelf get closed up. Even if anyone did find this place, they wouldn’t find Reid there. Their own perfect torture room. Reid never wanted to go in there again. Sam gently grabbed Reid’s wrist again and pulled him out of the room.
“I wanted to yell at the tv and no one pisses me off like Dora. I gotta let out some of that anxiety about finals,” Dean said as he walked into the kitchen with a bag of chips.
Reid slowly made his way to the other the door in the room. He hesitantly grabbed the doorknob. The feeling in his hand hadn’t fully returned yet but it was enough that he could grab the handle. He opened it and saw it was a bathroom.
“Both,” Sam said. “Neither. I don’t know. I just…look, we won’t know anything if we don’t investigate.”
“Yeah,” Sam said tiredly. “I had to stay late. A multiple car pile up happened and I got stuck at the hospital.”
“Fine,” Dean said. “But we obviously can’t break into the basement now with Bobby in the kitchen. We’ll do it after dinner.”
Dean immediately choked on his beer and started coughing. Sam and Rowena froze and stared at Jack as Cas healed Dean.
As Reid’s mind filled with questions for their mystery John Doe, he didn’t hear the footsteps behind him. He got startled when he got locked in a chokehold from behind, a hand covering his mouth too.
Reid felt something put into his pocket, his vision now blurred and unfocused. He lost all of his strength practically instantly. Reid went to talk as he got dragged towards a car but only a low mumble came out.
“I’m good. I’m good,” Dean said as he rubbed his eyes. “I’m good. It’s just bees. I’m taking to bees. I’m having an actual fucking conversation with a hive of bees. What the hell has my life come to now? God, I wanna go back to hustling pool.”
“Why are you in the basement?” Bobby asked as he walked towards the basement door, Cas and Crowley following.
As much as his reassurance was for Dean, it was also for his own benefit. He hated thinking about his time in the cage.
“I was a teenager. My dad wasn’t the best guy, like ever. He’d leave us with barely any money. When that got low, I’d have to come up with…creative ways to get money. People go for teenagers,” Dean said before staring at the floor. “Some guys just don’t take no for an answer, or stop.”
“Those are probably from when I was restrained,” Reid said quietly before looking at Derek. “What happened?”
“What?!” Dean yelled before seeing Sam visibly shaking. “Hey, hey, listen to me. You’re gonna be fine. Because all of our friends are dead and we’re fine now.”
Reid didn’t even flinch when Sam touched him. This was definitely a bad sign. He was becoming more comfortable with Sam, which was bad. He wanted so bad to stop flinching but him stopping flinching meant he was getting used to everything.
“Come on, we don’t have much time,” one of his kidnappers said to the other as he got pushed into the trunk.
“My father always said I was an angel, so I decided to get a tattoo of wings,” Castiel said. “Plus it looks nice.”
Reid felt his body lock up and freeze as the thought of Dean Winchester being behind him filled his mind.
Dean bit his tongue to stop himself from talking before glaring at Reid. This glare was far more intense than any of the glares he’s ever gotten from Dean before.
Reid never wanted to turn his back to either of the Winchester brothers. He was too terrified that they would come up behind him and slit his throat. Well, he was more worried that Dean would do that. With the tiny amount of time he spent around Sam, he didn’t think Sam would hurt him, not unless he set him off.
Sam glanced over at Reid and watched his chest move up and down. He almost found it calming watching someone breathing. It was so relaxing. The breathing had a pattern to it too. Breathe in. Breathe out. Repeat. It was relaxing to watch. With how bad Sam’s anxiety got, he often found small things that helped him calm down. And this seemed like one of them.
Everyone stared at each other as they all waited for someone to respond. The conference room was filled with quiet before Garcia burst into tears. JJ instinctively comforted her with a hug.
“Okay, cool, because I’m probably gonna get pissed off and hurt him,” Dean said before he covered his mouth again. “Son of a bitch. I hate this truth spell!”
“Jack passed away yesterday,” Hotch said, Dean freezing. “The coroner couldn’t come up with an answer as to why but…Jack’s dead.”
Peter had walked in on one too many weird conversations with the Winchesters. He talked to Ned about it, and Ned suggested they were in the mafia. Peter thought that was absolutely stupid, but Ned wasn’t standing in the same room where Dean was just casually washing blood off of him. Now Peter was starting to agree with Ned’s crazy theory.
Dean slumped into the chair across from Sam and plunked his beer down on the table. Sam glanced at the bottle, and Dean could tell he was weighing the pros and cons of nagging him about using a coaster. Luckily, Sam just pressed on.
“Sam. It’s okay,” he murmured, though he knew Sam couldn’t hear him. He was behind the veil now, one foot between future vengeful spirit and the other toward whatever waited for him beyond this. Hell
His head ached. His whole body ached. He couldn’t get comfortable – a spring from the mattress dug painfully into his hip no matter how he laid.
there for him in a way his old man never was. The beer itself was cheap and badly brewed, but it tasted like memories, and good ones at that.
The morning couldn’t come soon enough. For once, Dean had gotten up before Sam, and was ready to walk out the door before Sam had even finished waking up. He wanted this case to be over quickly so he could grab some pie, and then go back to wasting away in the bunker in peace.
Cas and Jack chatted about Heaven, about the changes Jack had implemented, about the systems of all the other universes he’d rebuilt. Cas took a particular interest in a world where the honeybees were lilac instead of gold, and where the grass grew a powder blue. Other universes weren’t so lucky. Jack described his struggle with whether to bring back a reality that had been in the throes of a devastating pandemic, but he ultimately didn’t feel it was right to snuff it out. He watched that world for a while, observing. It was rallying. A story of perseverance. He left knowing that despite it all, they were going to be okay.
Cas wrestled himself out of his shirt and jacket in a race with Dean’s lips and teeth and hands that were hell-bent on exploring every inch of skin. Cas tucked his hands underneath the hem of Dean’s shirt, dragging a feather-light touch down his stomach before digging his thumbs into Dean’s hipbones. Dean groaned and ground his hips against Cas in response.
and won for fuck’s sake. This was just a bunch of lowly monsters, something he’d taken out time and time again for decades.
Castiel drifted toward the soul, arm outstretched, a small smile and a single name on his lips. Except –
“Before your puny God and all of his noisy creations. And in all of my eons of existence, all that time enduring the horrible cacophony you call
He couldn’t hear, couldn’t think, and the next few movements didn’t quite feel like they were entirely his own.
There’s a single moment every day where grief simply does not exist. A moment that somehow hangs in the air despite its brevity; a moment incomprehensibly trapped between states of being.
“I hear the Amish here make excellent pies.” Cas carefully lowered himself onto the blanket next to Dean, balancing several slices in his hands. “I wasn’t certain which one you would prefer, so I purchased several.”
“What is this, some kind of freaky foreplay?” he raised his eyebrows and elbowed Sam playfully, who shot him a look mixed with a special blend of astonished exasperation and fear. “Don’t tell me you’re not just
Thanks for coming along for the ride so far, y'all are amazing and every comment and kudos literally puts me on cloud nine.
Sam stood next to him, tensed and with his machete raised. Dean reached around his back and rested his hand on the grip of his Colt. The smooth, well-worn ivory had a cold familiarity in his hand. It normally felt like power, like survival.
“Tommy,” Dylan said, still quiet. Tommy just drew his knees up into his chest and fixed a blank stare at his shoes. “
What had just looked like mildew stains and wet, weathered wood from a distance had started to take a much different shape as they drew closer. A dark, viscous liquid seeped out from between every gap in the planks, every eye in the wood, thick and slow like oil. The ooze pulsed and squirmed as though it had a heartbeat of its own.
He instinctively reached out to cup the soul gingerly in his hands. Ah, hands. There they were. He would have marveled at the first sight of his corporeal form since … (since he entered this place?) but he was too transfixed by the shimmering ball of light to care.
Dean continued his momentum around Sam, making sure nothing was behind them before re-emerging on his brother’s other side. He fired at a vamp, hitting them right in the heart with a dead man’s blood bullet and dropping them to the floor.
“Usually,” Jenny said, hesitantly. Dean felt anger coiling his hand into a fist again. He gripped the wheel tighter and slowed the car, looking for the turn off the road up to the barn. “Look, I—kids are off-menu, alright? Feeding on adults is one thing. But this…” She trailed off. “You’ve felt it. That kind of fear makes you desperate. It takes advantage of that.”
This soul, despite its jagged cracks, was still the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. And its hopelessness tore at his heart with claws serrated with empty promises and shattered reverie.
“Vampire. Mimes.” Sam spoke slowly, like he was clearly struggling to wrap his head around the idea.
The thought snagged Castiel’s attention away from where he drifted through a familiar, cold darkness. Something nudged at the edges of his consciousness – something bright and burning and brimming with promise – something that reminded him of the sun.
Jenny nodded slowly. “Yeah, now that you say it, that’s exactly what it felt like.” She pulled her arms – still bound at the wrists – close against her ribs and squeezed as she replayed the memory in her head. “I thought of it more like ‘The Thing’ impersonating her, just really badly.”
Dean gulped in air that smelled like the aging pages of books, like various herbs for spellwork, like the hint of dust on the large oak tables. Air that smelled a little musty, though comforting. Air that smelled like home.
But the blood and dents Sam’s anger left behind in the Impala’s dash ached in his chest by proxy. A damage to their home, to their past, to their hearts.
Cas surged forward to catch Dean’s lips before he could plant another teasing kiss that was anywhere but Cas’s mouth. Dean laughed against Cas’s lips before deepening the kiss, running his hands down Cas’s chest.
is, but trust me – it’s fucking horrifying.” She threw out her hands. “And I’m saying this as someone who basically eats people.”
That’s what this had been about. Not his delusional reveries of Cas being alive. Dean leaned back against one of the posts and slid down to the ground, careful to avoid getting snagged on any nails or splinters jutting out from the wood. Anger and self-loathing bubbled up in the back of his throat, and he could taste the sting of it on his tongue. How could he be so selfish? He knew why. He’d always been this way. Just a killer with no empathy or remorse. A killer who didn’t deserve love from someone like Cas. A killer who deserved to die dirty and alone and broken in a fight he finally couldn’t win.
“You have Eileen, Sam,” Dean said. “You have the chance to really live. With someone who gets it, who gets the life. You have someone to live
The trees melted into a blur as he sprinted through them. Darkness fuzzed around the edges of his vision as the bright makeshift sun behind him began to melt into something sinister. He swore he could see things moving in between the trees, like vines snaking toward him through the undergrowth, but he refused to look. He just ran, focusing on every step. Every step that brought him closer to Cas.
like the Castiel he knew from a distance. It was … Cas-shaped, but little more than a blurred silhouette. It shuffled around awkwardly to face him – though
He leaned against Cas as they perched on a steep cliff along the bank of the northern half of the Mississippi River, absently running his fingers through Cas’s hair. They took in the sights, watching fish jump from the water and listening to a group of high teenagers beat a broken rhythm on a hand drum and make up light-hearted songs about passersby.
Dean could practically hear the questions racing through Sam’s brain as a myriad of emotions flicked across his face. “Alright, alright,” Dean said. “That’s unrelated. Well, sort of.”
Sam looked down at his bloodied fist, now matching with Dean’s mangled hand. Dean just narrowed his eyes at Jenny in the mirror as a challenge.
“You sure?” He rasped, low and hesitant, to the vial, watching as the malignant creature of meat and bone came within just feet of him. He gagged on its scent, one that carried a sickly sweet tang of decay that scraped up his sinuses. Just one more step, and it’d be upon him.
The beauty of it was enrapturing. But before he could learn to speak again, to call out to it, to hold it close, it was wrenched from his grasp by a swarm of a thousand thorny hooks and he was drowned by darkness once more.
“Wh-“ Dean gasped. “Who are you?” He dragged out his words a little longer than he needed to, buying some time. He no longer had his machete, or his gun, and he couldn’t hear Sam behind him anymore. He didn’t want to think about what that meant.
And so they traveled from hunt to hunt, with their journeys slowly fading from ‘trying to track down any trace of the Empty’ into more of ‘any excuse to see family.’ Over time, they spent more time in Baby than in any one place – and this time, it wasn’t the Impala that felt like home. Dean stole lingering looks at Cas on particularly flat stretches of road, and Cas, each time, met his eyes and smiled back. Dean dropped his hand to where Cas’s rested on his leg, and twined their fingers together.
“I, uh.” Dean cleared his throat, pressing a sob back down into his chest before it could rip free. “I didn’t get to say goodbye.”
Not-Cas didn’t seem to hear them over its hysterics. The laugh sounded like Cas at the surface, but was also somehow
He couldn’t do this. Suddenly his appetite had tilted sideways and his palms itched to feel the familiar curve of a beer bottle. He hadn’t even realized he’d stood up, the sound of his chair clattering to the ground barely registered in his ears.
Sam walked behind Jenny, keeping his machete pointed at her back to remind her not to try anything. But she didn’t – she limped quietly toward the Impala with an air of boredom more than anything else.
Dean just stared down into the neck of his beer bottle at that, watching the bubbles in his drink fight their way to the surface. Deep down, he was relieved, but it came tainted with the disappointment that now he and Cas were forever a universe apart.
The static around Dean – the one he’d mistaken for a harmless breeze rustling in the trees – started to form whispers of encouragement in a cacophony of clashing languages he didn’t know, yet still understood. They spoke them in a thousand stolen tongues, with words swollen with betrayal and loss. And yet, every single one of them was urging him to pull the trigger.
“Dean!” Sam shouted, lunging forward to Dean’s side. He grabbed Dean’s shoulders, but Dean wouldn’t look up.
sooner than anyone here expected, right after the blip when everyone vanished and then sorta came back?” Jenny said, uncertainty tipping the edges of her voice. Sam and Dean exchanged a glance.
“Yep. It’s all one big Heaven now. A real life after life.” Bobby passed one of the bottles to Dean. “You boys raised him right.”
, exactly?” They were in the center of the room with no wall to back up against. They were absolutely surrounded. Dean spun to guard Cas’s back, his blade instinctively slipping down his arm and into his hand.
Dean had first used the hunts as an excuse to track down the Empty, because while he’d insist to Sam’s face that no, of course he trusted that purification spell worked, he was scared shitless the Empty would return. That he’d step into a motel room covered in fungus and rot, that the pavement beneath Baby’s wheels would turn slick with blood, that the grass beneath his feet would crunch into shards of bone.
Cas hummed. “They say every story comes down to just one word,” he said, dropping his hand from Dean’s hair and tracing his fingers lightly up and down Dean’s arm, his fingers grazing the handprint on his shoulder. “Redemption. Forgiveness. Defiance.”
The skin of Cas’s shoulder wasn’t smooth here – it felt puckered and rough, almost like—almost like a scar. Dean blinked open his eyes, squinting down at where his palm was pressed into Cas’s bare shoulder. Sure enough, beneath his fingers lay the burnt scorch marks of his own hand, a brand from where he’d held tightly on to Cas before he hit the angelic eject button to rocket them out of the Empty.
“That was a gift,” Cas said, his face softening as that small half-smile returned. “You keep those.”
he’d said. Words Cas clearly had never planned to say, and ones Dean had never expected to hear. Just admitting it was – what had Cas called it? A moment of true happiness for him?
Well, almost. Dean swayed, unsteady and woozy on his feet. In this moment, his resolve was stronger than his body.
“It’s solid,” Dean interjected, cutting her off. “But when… man, I don’t know, I don’t think it likes being touched? When I…” he cleared his throat. “When I grabbed it, it had some kind of defense mechanism.”
“I’m not leaving you this time,” he said softly, swiping his thumbs across Cas’s cheeks. “I’m not letting you stay behind like a fucking martyr.” Dean leaned forward, pressing his forehead against Cas’s. He took a shaky breath. “We’re either both getting out, or we’re both staying.”
face, which sagged and slid around on the skull beneath it as the Thing That Wasn’t Cas tilted its head in a hauntingly familiar way. Its eyes were closed, but Dean could feel its stare burrowing into his brain nonetheless, like the tendrils of fungus burrowing into the walls around him. The same dank-smelling thick liquid bubbled out of Not-Cas’s mouth and nose and dripped from beneath his eyelids.
And Dean’s rage reveled in the hurt he was inflicting on Sam, because it ricocheted right back at himself tenfold.
“You’re safe now,” Dean said, trying his best to sound comforting. He tapped into a vein of knowledge he hadn’t had to access since the day Sam turned 16 and started shutting both him, and their dad, out. “We’re gonna get you out of here.”
Sam immediately changed course. “Tiiiired. Jenny’s all tired, so she’s sleeping in the back?” He was trying, Dean’d give him that. But it sounded so freakin’ stupid.
Exhaustion crashed over him like a wave. He didn’t know what day it was, or how long he’d waded through the Empty’s murky and hellish depths. All he knew was that wherever they’d been spit out was dark, but safe. It seemed like a clearing of some sort. A cool summer night’s breeze drifted over them, and Dean stole a glance at the spattering of stars overhead. It felt late – and after days of fighting and running, fueled only by fear and little sleep, he was crashing.
Dean met Bobby’s eyes, trying not to let the sudden hope he felt rising in his chest get the better of him.
But he knew Sam was there the moment he felt the long needle of that syringe bury itself into his chest. Sam pressed down hard on the plunger, shooting the last few drops of serum straight into his heart.
know what it felt like to have it torment and control him, to force him to (nearly) take the life of someone he loved. His anger at Jenny drained away. The tension receded from his shoulders and loosened his grip on the wheel. Jenny was a killer on paper, sure, but by some shallow definitions, so was Dean. They were both forced into this life by blood, yet shuffled into different categories by the whims of coincidence and circumstance.
Dean scrambled backward, realizing with a deepening dread that the dead leaves crunching beneath his feet
“Cas is family, Dean. We don’t just give up on family,” his voice wavered. “You’re not the only one who’s hurting.”
