Bucky laughed as he continued to finish off his own first plate. The two started refilling the emptiness before eating at a slower pace. "Wanna know something funny? Steve taught me how to cook. Well, started me off anyways. With much practice, I just got better than the teacher." He laughed.
Laughing, Peter wrapped his arms around the slightly taller guy. "I missed you too, Uncle Bucky. Merry Christmas." He said before letting go and pointed to the food he had brought. "Mashed potatoes, gravy, and stuffing. Couldn't get my hands on any cranberry sauce."
Peter nodded quickly, guiding her hands to new spots on the camera. “This is to set the mode. This is to shut on and off the flash. And this is to take the picture.” He let her go and took a few steps back. “Angle however you want and take the picture when you feel it’s right.”
Peter rolled his eyes and opened his textbook. His father’s words flashed through his mind at that moment, and maybe today he would give the bully a run for his money. Grabbing one of the crumpled paper balls, he set to doing the problems; not only wrong, but the even numbers instead. He doubted Flash was paying attention enough to know they were supposed to do only odd. Actually he doubted Flash even knew the difference between the two.
Steve was quiet for a second on the other line before chuckling. "That man will do everything I say not to do when he's mad at me. But I'm glad you like the dog, Peter. What else did you do?" He asked calmly.
“Okay! Whoa!” Peter dropped his own fork and pushed his chair back away from the table. “Where is this going?” He held up his arms close to his ears, ready to cover them in any moments need.
Peter looked at the time and closed the door quickly. It was one minute to seven and he decided the last minute shouldn’t matter. He pressed the call button and placed the phone to his ear, taking a seat on his bed. His leg continued to shake as the phone rang and Peter had to hold it down. It stopped ringing and he heard her soft voice on the other end. “Hello?” She answered and Peter was stuck for a moment.
The footsteps continued and there was a soft laugh. “Those will have a lot of meaning behind them.” A soft voice said.
“Nope, ate it all up.” Bucky placed the phone between his ear and shoulder, continuing to play the game with his nephew. “On your way?”
"Yeah. Of course." He said. The two hung up and Peter grabbed his coat, keys, and the scarf Gwen had lend him before leaving the house.
Walking downstairs, Peter entered the kitchen where he found Tony over the stove, an apron over his suit minus the jacket, and Steve at the counter dicing up tomatoes in his own uniform minus the jacket. He didn’t speak as he watched them for a moment. There was no memory of these two ever cooking at the same time and as of late years, either of them cooking at all. Especially not dinner. Crossing his arms, Peter leaned against the wall and cleared his throat, grabbing both of the male’s attention. Tony smiled and motioned to the cabinets. “Care to set the table.” It wasn’t a question but more of a do-this-now demand.
His phone started buzzing on the desk as his inexpensive ringtone played. The little Spider-Man jingle always made him smile, but right now he was reluctant to get up and answer. When the culprit on the other line seemed to hold strong that he would answer or would leave a message, Peter rolled off the bed and hopped over to his phone.
Gwen grabbed another soup dumpling as she thought about it for a moment. “Oxford is probably  my top choice, even though it’s abroad. But really I’d be happy if any of them granted me an interview.”
“Sure.” Peter skipped over to the kitchen to grab the bag. Taking in the moment, Peter watched as his dad’s helped each other look their best. Brushing off lint on blazers, putting stray hairs back in their place. It all seemed so normal. With a content sigh, Peter decided that what he was looking at is normal. That maybe one day, society would understand their family is just as strong as any other.
The smile that spread across Gwen’s face was the brightest he’d had ever seen. “Peter Rogers-Stark, are you asking me out on a date?” She dropped her head a bit and looked up at him from under her eyelashes.
“Why? Why now? Why didn’t you support me last year, instead of throwing me under the bus?!” Peter yelled. “You blamed me for what you pressured me to do! You told your dad I made you do it! We had such a great night and you left me in that cell and…” His words were lost as the tears began once more.
Peter shook his head before noticing Tony had left his coffee cup. Finishing up his breakfast, he poured some food into Jarvis’s bowl before grabbing the coffee cup and heading upstairs. He stopped just short of the last step, catching a hint of an odd smell. Bringing the cup up to his nose, the scent of whisky hit his senses. With an agitated sigh, Peter angrily walked the rest of the way and knocked hard on the door.
Peter flustered and stammered over his words, deciding just to nod in response. The elevator tried to close, but he held the door open and looked down to the floor. “I guess I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Laughing, Peter took another bite from his own pizza. “Oven baked really gets the flavor in it.” He felt accomplished that Gwen liked the pizza. This was a good thing. She had fun taking pictures and now she was enjoying dinner. Yes, this was really good. They spoke as they ate their pizzas and once they finished Peter pulled over the bag of Zeppole. “These treats are simple but awesome. They are messy though.” He handed one to Gwen and took one for himself.
They transferred trains and then rode the second one for a while. Peter stood awake while Gwen fell asleep on his shoulder. He thought the day through and just kept feeling like the luckiest guy in the world. Here he was with the girl he’s been crushing on for four years trusting him. Spending a night out with him and sleeping on his shoulder as he took her home. Never in a million years did Peter think this would happen to him. But it is happening. Right here, right now, and he figured he literally was the luckiest guy in the world. If not luckiest, then damn sure he was the happiest. They were rounding her stop and Peter lightly shook her, calling her name softly.
Once more Peter went to say something but nothing came out, his eyebrows raised. He took a deep breath and smiled, shaking his head a bit but not enough to say no. “I didn’t--I mean if you want…or there, so--it’s up to you really--that place is really nice.” He leaned off the lockers and swayed on his heels.
Of course, Bucky wasn't Peter's real uncle. But he was close enough to the real deal. Steve and Bucky, real name James, had grown up together in Brooklyn and both had joined the army once they were of age. The two had remained close friends even though their respected MOS were different. Tony knew Peter's real parents well and so when Peter was adopted by Steve and Tony after his real parents put him up for adoption, Bucky had helped the then newly married couple settle and would often babysit Peter. Everything had gone smoothly with the adoption, though Tony never likes to talk about it. When Peter started school, it was often Bucky who picked him up and helped him with his homework. His job in the military didn't demand his immediate attention. But when it did, Uncle Bucky would be gone for months at a time without a single word. Not even Steve knew where James would go or for how long. His orders came from farther up. As a kid, Peter swore his uncle was a super-secret spy. He still stands by that to this day.
Together they bit into their Zeppole, each getting the white powdered sugar all over their fingers and lips. They laughed as they wiped their mouths with napkins. “It really is delicious.” Gwen commented, taking another bite.
“Oscorp? Why wouldn’t you go to Stark Industries? I mean, after what happened, is that the best place to go?” Bucky asked, turning a little to Peter.
"What's wrong?" Peter asked immediately. A sense of protectiveness overcoming him and he was already putting on his winter boots.
Peter nodded and thanked Gwen a million times over in his mind for helping him heal faster. “You know the one I’m always talking about? Flash? Well, he did this.”
That lovely sound of her laughter touched Peter’s heart and he just stood there with a smile on his face. An idea hit him and his hands flew out of his pockets. “Hey, I’m going out snapping pictures of the holiday decorations tonight. Do you--” He stopped, his voice suddenly catching in his throat. Was he really just about to ask Gwen Stacy out? What if she rejected him? His face would turn beet red and then he’ll be way too embarrassed to even meet her eye to eye.
The truck came to a stop at a red light and Steve turned to look at Peter. “Like what?” Peter gave a shrug and Steve shook his head. “Not good enough. Peter look at me when I’m talking to you.”
There was a split second where Peter fights on the impulse to pretend he didn’t hear his father call him and just run down the block. But if interrogated about it later, he knew he would crumble. So he opened the door and took a step in, smiling at his father. “Morning, sir.” He said with his usual sheepish smile.
“Good, at least one of us does.” Peter said, furious that Tony seemed to not think that his health was at risk. “You know what, dad? I can’t anymore. You do this to yourself! You pour this out. I’m going out, and if something happens, don’t call me.” With that, Peter left the room and rushed out of the house.
With the ceremony finally over, Peter found his dads and Harry, giving them all a hug as well. “Here, this is for you. Hang it up, put it in a bin in the attic, I don’t care.” Peter joked as he handed his diploma and awards to Steve.
Peter felt his stomach sink. There goes another L on his attendance mark and his loving military father was going to have a fit. He opened his textbook to the assigned page and laid his head down, suddenly not caring about the lesson. This teacher had it out for him. Ever since that time Peter corrected him on a math problem which the teacher was positive was his way or no way. But Peter was smart and knew the teacher was wrong. So in front of everyone, he proved the teacher wrong. Ever since then, the teacher has grabbed any little excuse to get Peter into trouble.
Peter could hardly hear the words coming out his mouth, but he understood them. Even the cheers from the crowd seemed distant. “You…are an idiot…Flash.” Peter managed to choke out.
Peter quickly looked back up at her and nodded in response, giving a sheepish smile. “Yeah.” He managed to choke out of his throat. “Thanks.” He added in a rush.
Goosebumps traveled up Peter’s arms and he nodded his head with a crooked smile, taking his camera from around his neck and handing it to Gwen. He faced her toward the house and stood behind her, guiding her hands on the camera and glad she couldn’t see the blush on his face, because he knew he was redder than a beet. “You twist this here to zoom in. Twist the second one to get it into focus.” He spoke right next to her ear lowly. Peter doesn’t know what was coming over him, but he felt this boost of confidence to be this comfortable with Gwen.
Gwen smiled and then continued to flip through the pictures, laughing at the ones with both of them making funny faces. She stood a bit too long on the one of him and her smiling. “It looks so natural.” She stated. “Our smiles, you know. Not staged in front of a camera. But natural.” She looked up at him.
Still in a stunned state, Peter just stared at her. He caught himself and shook his head, attempting to clear it and looked down. “I--” He began but didn’t know what else to say. Well, he did, he wanted to thank her for stopping Flash, for helping him clean up, for taking care of him when everyone else just stood around and watched. This Gwen Stacy was something else. And he knew her. Not exactly know her, but knew her. He’s seen her around school. He shares three classes with her. He knows she’s on the debate team and that she’s super smart. He knows that she’s very beautiful and that he’s had a crush on her since the first time he ever lay eyes on her back in freshman year. He also knows until today, he’s never spoken to her before. And now she knows him as the wimp who got beat up by Flash. Again.
Good head start, and he wasn't going to slow down for a minute. Peter ran through the hallways and down the stairs to his next class. Today he wanted to go to all his classes. Especially since he had his next one with Gwen. Peter arrived to the classroom safe and sound, though he realized he'd have to try and avoid the big idiot for the rest of the day. But all that didn't seem to matter as Gwen entered the room and smiled at him. She walked over to his table and sat next to him. "Hi." He said and cleared his throat.
"Really, Gwen, nothing to apologize for. I'm quite used to it actually." Peter finished off his ice cream and tossed the empty cup into the nearest trash can. "Besides, you have every right to be upset. It's better to let it out rather than keep it all bottled up. Trust me."
Peter felt his face heat up for the millionth time that night as he walked over to Gwen. They stood close together as he held the camera out in front of them and snapped a picture. They shared a laugh and took a few more on Gwen’s command. A funny face picture, a cheesy smile one, a serious one. After that, Peter began leading Gwen to the pizzeria. “Thanks for coming with me. It was really fun.” Peter said as he shut off his camera.
The steam from the pizza could be seen and they had a fun moment blowing the steam at one another. Finally when the pizza had cooled down a bit, he and Gwen took a bite. “Oh gosh!” Gwen boasted. “You’re right, this pizza is good!”
"Damn, Uncle Bucky! I don't understand how you can cook this good. I mean, other people cook and it's great. But this?" Peter dramatically pointed to the piece of turkey currently stabbed into his fork. "It just amazing. My dad's are okay at cooking, but they can't even come close to you." Peter boasted and quickly finished off his first plate.
Another boot to his ribs. These were going to stay bruised for a long time if they weren’t already broken. He sure did feel the pain as if they were. Flash continued his questions, Peter coming to at the last one. “Are you that pathetic? Fag fathers, no friends, no life. Are you a faggot too? Huh?!”
When he noticed Flash push through the now formed circle, Peter scrambled to his feet and made to get away. Flash was quick to grab Peter’s backpack and yank him back. Peter turned quickly to face Flash in hopes of blocking what he knew would be a hurtful blow. Not quick enough. Flash’s fist hit Peter hard on the corner of his left eye. Before Peter could come back from that blow, there was another fist hitting him hard in his stomach. Doubling over did nothing as Flash pulled Peter upright once more and hit him in the face, this time Peter was so dazed he didn’t exactly know where he was hit.
Looking up, Peter held back his most inner thought. She said the last few weeks. That means she noticed him. Watched him. Probably not as much as he watched her, but she noticed and that was enough to make Peter smile a mile wide at her. “I got my camera back.” He felt sheepish as the words came out his mouth. He gave a small laugh and fingered the camera a bit. “Uh, I mean I didn’t lose it or anything. I just hadn’t really had the muse to take photos lately.” He bit his bottom lip.
The place was packed when they arrived with ten minutes to spare. After finding a parking, Peter gave his dads a hug and Harry one last kiss before separating to join his classmates in the student section. He walked over to a teacher for his seating arrangement. Since he had two last names, they would be putting him in the R section since Rogers was first.
“Do you like pizza?” Peter asked in a rush. The words escaped his mouth before he could catch them. This definitely wasn’t him. Something must have taken over his body to speak so boldly, so clear. Maybe Flash’s punches unscrewed something in his head. Gwen nodded and Peter smirked. “There’s this great oven baked pizzeria on Second Avenue. We could swing by there after if you wish.” The words came out slow and low, but he knew they were even so he felt proud of himself.
“Me too.” He cursed himself under his breath for answering too fast. Looking around, he noticed the student body beginning to build up. “Well, I’ll see you later.” He waved quickly and rushed into the school. Peter gathered what he needed from his locker, his camera still around his neck as he rushed to class.
With a smile, Harry kissed Peter back before pulling away. “Sorry, I still get a little nervous around your dads.” He said in a whisper.
Gwen shook her head as she walked up to where Peter stood in front of a blue lit house. “How to be a photographer for the night.” She spoke in a whisper.
Pushing his shirt back down, he scooped up his backpack and walked with his head down out of the bathroom. He didn’t want to go back to class. Not after everyone had seen what happened. Not after no teacher came out into the hallway to help him. Not after Gwen had been so kind and he felt just so stupid. Running to his locker, he grabbed his coat and scarf, shoved his books into his locker, and left the building. He knew he could go home right now and not get into any trouble. His father’s worked long hours. It was rare if he got to see them come home at all. Most nights he spent eating dinner by himself.
Gwen seemed to not have noticed, or maybe she did but kept her thoughts about it to herself. "Good then. I'm holding you to that. So! Where are you going for Christmas dinner?" She asked just as they were freed from the festive area.
"Kinda the same old stuff." Gwen said as she dunked the small spoon into her cup of ice cream. Despite the cold weather, she and Peter had stopped at one of the many stands out on Union Square and got ice cream. Every year around the holidays, the place by the park would fill up with lights and booths selling holiday gifts. And some treats for the shoppers. She ate the chocolate ice cream as she spoke. "Ever since I was a kid I worried if my dad would come home or not." Gwen said before looking up at Peter; searching for understanding.
Thank you to everyone who has stuck with this story despite my long waited updates. The story has come to an end, and I am grateful for everyone who has given kudos, commented, bookmarked, or even just clicked on this story and read it.
The future is and should be bright, but, like our brief four years in high school, what makes life valuable is that it doesn’t last forever, what makes it precious is that it ends. I know that now more than ever. And I say it today of all days to remind us that time is luck. So don’t waste it living someone else’s life, make yours count for something. Fight for what matters to you, no matter what. Because even if you fall short, what better way is there to live?
"Alright. Make something better than canned soup to eat. Goodnight, Peter. I love you." Tony said before hanging up.
“It’s a piece of shit.” Tony said as he descended the stairs. He made his way into the kitchen and started making coffee. “I keep telling you to buy a new one.”
Rolling his eyes, Peter started eating his cereal. "It's Christmas vacation dad. Anyways, I'm going out tonight." Peter looked down at Jarvis who was waiting for something to fall from the table.
“Oh gosh pops, please don’t.” Peter knew that Steve wasn’t afraid to teach a person a lesson or two. He’s done it before.
Sighing, Peter slowly rose up into a sitting position. He rested his chin in his palm and stared at the board. All this was easy. Peter had his father, Tony, to thank for teaching him a bunch of complicated stuff early on. He grew a love of science thanks to Tony. So math seemed to come naturally to him since it shared a link with science so often. Peter felt a rough nudge on his back and he sighed, turning around slightly to see his school bully smirking at him. Peter rolled his eyes and turned back around.
Once the table was set, Peter went over to the stove and grabbed the dishes that were ready to be served. He placed them as neatly on the table as he could. The aroma that filled the house made Peter's mouth water and his stomach grumble. Due to Bucky living alone, he had to learn how to cook for himself. He had told Peter before, the way he saw it, just because he cooked for one didn't mean it had to be half assed. All in all, the man could cook. Peter was certain his fathers would be jealous after their failed attempt at making pasta not too long ago.
Pouting, Tony crossed his arms. “It was just one. Your less cool father said you were going out to take pictures?” When Peter nodded his head, Tony moved into the living room and motioned for Peter to follow. Taking a seat, Tony crossed his arms and eyed his son. “I know it’s not by yourself. It’s not with him, is it?”
Peter quickly shook his head and pulled together all the energy he could muster and stood up. He hated school nurses. Not only did they never know what they were doing, but they would call someone to come and pick him up or inform them of what happened and the last thing he needed was either one of his father’s coming down here. Especially Steve. Peter had been humiliated enough for one day. “No, I’m okay really. Just late to class. And I made you late. I’m so sorry.” The words came out in a rush, stumbling over one another that he’s not sure if Gwen even heard them all.
“No, we don’t. I’m home now. You can go back to work.” Peter unlocked the door and made his way up the stairs.
“I’d love too.” Gwen said softly. She looked around and noticed more people had arrived, the front doors now open. “Come on, let’s get out of this cold.” She intertwined her arm with Peter’s and they began walking toward the school.
Peter’s phone buzzed in his pocket and he dug for it. His uncle’s picture popped up on the screen and he automatically answered it. “Excuse me a moment.” He said to Gwen as he stood up and walked a few paces away. “Hey Uncle Bucky. What’s up?”
“Everyone, please be seated so we can get started!” The principle said, pointing at people to sit down.
Tony walked over to where Peter stood and smiled at him. “Be careful out there.” He said, taking a sip from his beer bottle.
The school yard was empty again upon his arrival. This made him smile. He shoved the remainder of his pop tart into his mouth, smacking his hands against his jeans to get the crumbs off. Leaning against the building wall, Peter watched as students began to arrive in the lot. His eyes were scanning the area, searching, and finally stopped on who he was looking for. Pushing off the wall, he gave a small wave as Gwen spotted him. She waved in return, walking straight up to him. “Morning.” He said with a smile.
"It's not drugs, dad. It's this horrible thing called school." Peter joked as he pulled up an internet browser and pulled his keyboard forward. Even if he was lying about why he left early, he actually did have some homework to do. Peter decided early on he would finish all the Christmas break homework tonight. And having a computer in his room was the most helpful thing his parents could have ever gotten him. "Anyways, I'll see you later? " Peter asked.
Harry sighed and leaned into her embrace a bit, relieved to be out of the spotlight from Tony. He soon turned to give her a proper hug and congratulate her. “So, how about that position at Oscorp? Felicia could use some help.”
Keeping silent for a moment, Tony stirred his coffee with his finger as he sulked down in the chair. "Last night should have been a ‘get lucky’ kind of night. And every married couple got lucky. Except for me." Tony whined.
Unable to help it, Gwen laughed and took a few steps closer. “It’s no problem. But I wasn’t talking about the bruises. You look better. Happier than I’ve seen you in the last few weeks.” She came to a stop just in front of him now.
Bucky had gone to get them something to eat as it seemed they would be there for a while. So Peter sat alone, people in the waiting area looking at him every now and again as the TV showed the news and his father’s story being broadcasted. He hated this. Why was everyone in Tony’s business? It wasn’t as though they actually cared. It wasn’t as though they would cry if it came to the worse.
The sound of the lenses capturing the picture made Peter smile. It had been such a long time since he snapped a picture and it delighted him. But this was just the day time, Peter longed for the sun to set so the holiday lights would come on and he could snap pictures of that. It was warming and he loved the way the lights from the decorations danced in the final outcome of the pictures. Some he kept original, when they were brighter than the sun. He let his camera hang on its strap around his neck as he continued walking the rest of the way to school. This morning he had been up bright and early, eager to get out and catch a few morning pictures before the morning buzz filled and blocked the sights.
“No, Peter, I never told my dad that. I told him that it was all my idea and that I pressured you into drinking his bottle with me. I would have never...but you didn’t return my text. And you blocked my number. I tried to come and see you, but your dads wouldn’t let me. My dad had then transferred me to a different school and...I stopped trying.” Harry looked up at Peter now, his eyes red and shining as he fought back his own tears. “I loved you, Peter. And you abandoned me.”
The teacher gave them a set of problems to do and then sat at his desk. Peter set to doing the work in his notebook quickly, wanting to complete them so he could nap the rest of the track. Another nudge on his back told him this was going to be anything but a smooth class today. Peter turned around once more. “What, Flash?” He asked just above a whisper.
He paid for the item and walked back outside. Good thing about going to areas after Christmas is the rush was a lot calmer. Peter spotted Gwen crossing the street under the bridge and rushed over to meet her. “Hey.” He said, his breath visible in the cold air. Gwen looked chilled to the bone. “Come on, let’s go inside. The food court upstairs has a place we can get hot chocolate at.”
The two spoke in idle conversation. Talking about how much they ate for dinner last night and what they got from their parents. Gwen laughed when she heard the dog's name and nodded in approval. Peter was happy to hear that she had a good Christmas despite how upset she was the other day that her father wasn’t going to be able to join the family. Peter took a moment to wonder about Tony and hoped Steve called him. Lately there was such a strain on their little family. Maybe he should talk to his parents. Make sure everything was okay between them.
"Hi." Gwen responded as she took out her notebook and the folder Peter had given her earlier. "So I looked over the pictures some more. These are incredible. Have you ever thought about going pro?" She asked as she opened the folder again and started going through the pictures.
Gwen looked a bit nervous, but she smiled anyways and kept her head held high. She took a moment to take in the clear sky, sun shining down on a perfect day. “It’s easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today, but there will be dark days ahead of us too, and there’ll be days where you feel all alone, and that’s when hope is needed most. Keep it alive.
Peter blinked a few times, not realizing his eyes were closed in the first place. He looked around to the empty hallways and then up at the person sitting beside him. “Gwen…Stacy?” He asked, attempting to sit up but feeling his head spin like crazy and lay back down.
With a light shove to his shoulder, Gwen smiled and held her ice cream cup with both hands as if warming them despite the cold. "You always seem to know the right thing to say, Peter. And I'm sorry. That was selfish of me." She said as she looked down into the cup. "Here I am saying how angry I am that my father calls and says he won't be home Christmas night for dinner. But he is going to be there in the morning. Your dad though...he won't be home until way past Christmas. And..." Her words had begun to trail off as Peter gave off a chuckle.
“Yeah, that place.” Gwen giggled. She took out a piece of paper and started scribbling something on it and then handing it to Peter. “Here is my number. Give me a call after school around seven and we’ll meet up.”
Bucky stuttered into the speaker for a moment. “Listen, take a taxi. I’ll pay for it when you get here.” The sound of sirens sounded through the receiver. “Hurry up.” With that the call was dropped.
"I may have taken those pictures. But it's because you showed me how. So it's your good eye that caught the image." Gwen was satisfied with her side of the argument and turned to face Peter, a whole new topic on her mind. "We go on Christmas vacation tomorrow. Do you want to maybe come over to my house for dinner? Not Christmas dinner. You have that with your family of course. But um, the day after. If you want that is." Her words were a bit rushed, but Gwen was overall happy.
Glaring a bit at the other man and crossing his arms, Steve continued to bicker. “My sauce is awesome. You love my sauce.”
Peter’s heart sank immediately. Did something happen to Steve? Was Tony okay? Who was hurt? What was wrong? All the questions flooded his mind, one right after the other. “Is everything okay? Where’s dad?” He asked, really asking about both his father’s.
“Hey, we are all gonna hang out, I’ll see you at home?” Peter said, handing his blazer and tie to Steve who put them neatly in the bag.
By the time class finished, Peter knew more about Gwen then the topic the whole class just discussed. Gathering up his books, Peter stood up and made to leave the room. Gwen caught up to him quickly, walking along beside him with a smile. "But you showed me how." She said to him without looking directly at him.
The place was hot compared to the outside freezing air so the two took off their coats and scarves. Peter gave Gwen a quick up and down look. She wore her usual knee high boots and tight dark blue jeans with a gorgeous emerald green blouse. His voice caught in his throat and he held his breath for a moment. Finally catching himself, he cleared his throat and smiled when Gwen looked up at him. “You look amazing.” He said in a half whisper. Peter cursed himself in his mind, he wanted to say that clear and loud to really let her know. Not to let her know that he was too breath-taken away. He chewed on his bottom lip and looked down, feeling like a wimp.
Steve signed on the other line. "Yeah, he's pretty mad at me. I'll give him a call. Have a good day son. I'll be home for New Years."
Bucky watched until Harry was completely out of sight before he turned to Peter. “Are you okay?” When Peter nodded, Bucky relaxed and grabbed the bag of food. “I got burgers.”
“Yes, he is.” Gwen said, as she surprise hugged Harry from behind. “He doesn’t have a choice. We are all going.”
Gwen said her goodbye, Peter waved, and she left the bathroom. Peter hung back for a bit, relishing in the kindness of this girl whom he never thought would give him the time of day in any situation. Also in hopes that by standing here the swelling in his face would go down. Placing his backpack on the floor, Peter lifted his shirt to see his ribs and parts of his stomach were bandaged. His face grew hot and he felt embarrassed all over again. Gwen had patched him up while he was unconscious. Or maybe he was awake, he just couldn’t remember. The point is she had seen him practically shirtless. Peter felt a large amount of hate for himself at that moment.
Shaking his head, Peter remembered he was on the phone as he began typing away on the keyboard. "No, vacation starts tomorrow, remember?" He asked a bit irritated but quickly brushed it off. "Anyways, I'll just make myself some canned soup or something."
A doctor came out and walked over to the duo. “Peter? James?” The doctor asked as he watched the two quickly jump out of their seats.
It was like a dream come true. Her number in his phone and his in hers. It just all seemed so cereal. “Um, are we still on?” He found it easier to talk to her on the phone rather than in person where he had to keep himself from blushing.
Peter arrived to school on time thanks to his father’s crazy fast driving. He shoved his winter coat and scarf into his locker and pulled out all the books he’ll be needing for his morning classes. Slamming his locker shut, he ran down the halls, sliding a few times on the melted snow filled floors. He barged into the classroom just as the bell rang, getting the attention from the teacher and all of his classmates. Quickly feeling his face go red, he looked down and made his way to his seat. Sitting down, he didn’t bother to look up at the teacher who he knew was still watching him.
Either way, Peter chose not to go home. Instead he ventured to the subway and made his way to Times Square. He listened to a few street performers play their homemade instruments and tossed a few bucks into the hat that was on the floor in front of them. Then he walked around the crowded streets and sat on the TKTS red stairs.
Gwen looked shocked at the fact he had gotten her something. With a warm smile, she took the bag from him and waved away his worried words. Taking out the scarf, Gwen let out a small gasp and smiled brightly. “Peter, it’s beautiful. Thank you!” She reached across the table and pulled him into a hug.
Bucky seemed unhappy with the short replies to his questions, but decided not to get into it. Peter was always open to him so if there was something, Bucky would let Peter decide when and how he wants to tell him. After all, the last time something happened, Peter came straight to him even before going to his parents. So he turned the subject a bit back to school topics. “Any science fairs coming up?” He asked as he pressed the buttons on the controller a bit harder as the game intensified.
When it opened, Peter held the door as she got out and turned to him. “That’s me down there.” She pointed to her door and then looked back at him. “Will I get to see all those pictures?” She asked with a smile.
But he could feel the lump in his throat and no longer felt the grand desire to finish his homework early on. Getting up from his desk, Peter made his way over to his twin sized bed and dropped flat onto it. He wished he had grabbed his iPod from the table but didn't feel like getting up to grab it. Instead he pulled his pillow close to his chest and tried hard to breath evenly. There was no doubt Peter was going to cry. And why shouldn't he? He'd thought his fathers had learned from the many missed Christmas mornings and birthdays and school plays. But the older he got the less those things seemed to matter.
With a smile, Gwen followed him inside. “Guess this wasn’t too smart of a place. Literally at the waterfront.” She laughed as they rode the escalators up to the last floor.
Peter took the money and thanked his father before leaving the house and speed walking to the train. He didn’t want Gwen to get there before him and have to wait in the cold and the dark, plus he needed to cool off before getting there. He was lucky to catch the F train just as he swiped his metrocard and took a seat. Fiddling with his camera, Peter made sure all the settings were correct and snapped a few pictures of the practically empty train. He’ll edit the people’s faces later.
Tony gagged behind them. “Alright, move it along, before Steve starts cadencing us out the front door.”
Peter looked at the box and smiled as he tore the wrapper off. Inside was a small tag in the shape of a bone. Peter looked at it with his brows knitted until he realized it was a dog tag. “Wait…are you serious?!” He asked and turned to look at his father.
Flash tossed his notebook at Peter and sat back in his seat. “Do the problems for me.” He looked to his little goon friend sitting next to him and smiled.
Steve pulled back and looked at him, then said, “You’re so perceptive and thoughtful. Thank you, it means so much to me,” and he kissed him on the forehead before saying,
“And here I thought I was doing you a favor,” Obadiah sneers. The gun follows Tony as he moves away from the desk. “Since your cowardly father tried so damn hard to keep you alive, I thought it would be a shame to let all that work go to waste. But now I’m of the opinion that I should have sold you for parts. It would have saved me a lot of trouble.”
The thing is, Tony never thought it was something that would ever be said to him. It hadn’t ever before, so he figured he was never going to hear those specific words said for him only. There had been plenty of opportunities, with his parents, or Rhodey, or Pepper. Somehow, he decided, the universe had mandated that Tony Stark wasn’t someone to love.
Clint nods at Natasha’s bent head. “Tash has a contact, used to be Anthony Stark’s personal assistant. She’s a senior V.P. now, but she still slums it with the admin assistants when she’s in the mood. Pepper, I think. Nice lady, great rack.” He hisses and jerks away from where she got him in the ribs. “What? I’m allowed to look.”
Tony sighs. “You’re right, but I figured making you laugh would be easier than talking about our feelings.”
him, and because I had to shove my hand into his chest and cause him massive amounts of pain to make sure he didn't die. And because Tony has been through absolute hell today, and the last thing he needs right now is me hanging around like an infection that won’t go away.”
Steve has no words to express the wave of gratitude he feels for his team at that moment, so he nods and leads the way out of the bunkroom.
And that's it! I'm so sorry for the long break, moving took more out of me than I thought it would, and it took me a while to come back to this. I hope this ending is at least semi-realistic, and if not, well, it's fanfiction. Believe me, there is a lot of therapy in everyone's future, but I think they're all better for it.
“Good. Open this.” He pushes the prototype towards Steve, and it’s almost laughable how easily Steve pops open the cap, twisting and pushing at the same time. Tony wishes he had the breath left to sigh dramatically. “Now, put this in there.”
There’s a shove to his shoulder, and he tips with it, more for effect than anything. “Would have been better if someone had, then we wouldn’t have you collapsing in the middle of my fucking lab.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” It appears Tony has finally reached his limit, and Pepper acquiesces the podium to him with a practiced sidestep and a sigh.
“Another folder in the archives was found, marked ‘Backup Plans’. Do you want me to scan and sort it like the others? I could also, perhaps, send some to Mr. Yinsen for him to look over?”
“Yeah, Tony. Thanks.” He shakes himself and maneuvers up onto the couch, head in his hands. The old springs in the couch squeak again, and there’s a warm weight pressed against Steve’s side.
“Well, probably not the kind you want. Those too, of course. But mainly, I wish I had punched Howard when I had the chance.”
(It was fine, he will tell himself later, because he didn’t want to interact with the masses anyway. And really, who needs a drunk for a father, he’ll say as he pours a drink.)
To look at her, Steve never would have guessed that Pepper had shot a man dead only hours before. Perfectly pressed and poised, she looks as if she had stepped up to the podium from the pages of a fashion magazine. Or he assumes, anyway. Steve doesn’t read a lot of fashion magazines.
“No! No, Clint, of course not.” And Phil just looks so hurt, shit, he just wants to crawl back in his bunk and forget this conversation ever happened. “We’re going to figure this out, we have some time. We’ll talk to the rest of the team and some contacts I have.” He inches closer and Clint tries to stay cool but fairly collapses against him. For all he was convinced Phil was sent to make him disappear, he’s never felt safer than when Phil’s arms are around him.
Steve doesn’t know what to do with his hands, with his body, he’s got too much nervous energy, so he gets up and starts pacing across the small patch of grass where they sit. “No, Tony, I wouldn’t. You didn’t ask for any of that. What your father did, what Obadiah did, none of that could have been your fault. I don’t think you can be made to answer for their crimes, especially not for what they made you do as a fucking child. They kept you in a cage, which is a crime in itself, and forced you to be their golden goose, using your health to keep you contained. You had no choice, you were just trying to stay alive.”
He throws his helmet against the bank of lockers and sinks to the floor against them. He presses the call button on his wrist cuff, letting the rest of the team and Phil, as their handler, know where he is, and that something’s gone wrong. He settles in to sit and wait, to spend some quality time with the ache in his chest.
Steve looks to Coulson and receives a brisk nod before following Tony out, placing himself between Tony and the rows of reporters shouting for his attention. He feels naked without his shield, but Pepper felt that the sleek black suits they’re all sporting, rather than their old gear, would send a better message. He follows Tony into the elevator, and as the doors close Tony releases a tense sigh.
Something moves in the alley behind him, a slight shifting of shadows, but it is enough to send our young man into a panic and he falls to the ground, scrambling away from the specter. He corners himself behind a dumpster, and that’s when he starts begging.
Steve stares at the card, grumbles about traitors and betrayals of years of friendship and gets up from the booth. He returns Bucky flipping him the bird in kind and walks towards the bar, shoulders hunched. Even after all these years, he still feels like he should only be five foot four.
” Tony shouts, slamming fists down on the console, and then flinching as the word leaves his mouth. On the screen, the shield ricochets off of the wall and glances against Yinsen’s temple, a softened blow that still leaves him slumped over the table.
“Okay?” Steve frowns a little and crosses his arms right back. “We’ve been getting to know each other. That’s not a crime, last time I checked.”
“Good morning and thank you all for coming on such short notice. We have some announcements to make about the future of Stark Industries. There will be a press release once we’re finished here, but we wanted to present some changes in person.”
“We will now take a few questions.” As the hands fly into the air, Pepper gestures gracefully to a young reporter.
For once, Tony’s completely silent, pacing back and forth in front of the couch with the manic energy that infuses everything he does, but it’s turned inward, dampened somehow, and Steve doesn’t like it. It magnifies the uneasy feeling he’s had since he laid eyes on the chair, like everything had tilted slightly out of balance.
“You’re too good to me. Anything you could want, you have it. You want an island? I’m pretty sure I have the capital to get you an island.”
to talk about it. I am a friend-type-person, and I have been informed that that’s something friends do for one another, listening.”
“And two,” Once they’re in the elevator, Tony can catch his breath again and finish his epic speech, “If you walk me into a hospital, you’re going to spend an hour explaining to people how I can possibly be alive, and the next three trying to find someone who can understand the fucked up mechanics I’ve got going on in my body. And you’re not gong to be able to find anyone because the only person-“ Tony stops, closing his eyes against the momentary wave of anguish. “The only person who knew how to treat me was just shot.”
His team learns to adjust as well. Some stay on at Stark Industries, and some disappear into the shadows. The archer becomes a landlord and guards his tenants like family. His bureaucrat boyfriend loves their home away from the Tower and enjoys a more equal work-life balance.
Tony laughs. “Steve. Steve, can’t you see? If you can’t blame me for those things, how can I blame you for the contracts you and your incredibly vulnerable friends were trapped into?”
Steve snorts. “Didn’t even realize you knew what the sun was, being shut up in your workshop so much.”
way) He’s loud, boisterous, basically a golden retriever in human form. But he tries to help however he can, and he’s always the first to rush into a fight. The amount of hits he’s taken for all of them is ridiculous, and Tony would offer to upgrade his armor in thanks if he didn’t think it would grievously offend him.
Quiet footsteps approach, barely audible until they’re just outside the door. It slides open, and Tony holds his breath for the few seconds it takes the monster to cross the threshold. In a quick, reflexive movement, Tony brings the fire extinguisher up over his head, and down on to the back of the Repossession Man’s skull.
“As I’m ever going to be.” Even braced for the pain, electricity still lances white-hot in his veins as the reactor slides into place. When it settles into place with a solid click, Tony is paralyzed with the amount of power ricocheting through his system. He blinks white spots out of his eyes and looks up into the face he’s spent afternoons trying not to memorize, breathing more deeply. “Well? Did I die?”
Steve scrolls through the notice, mostly legalese he doesn’t have the focus to decipher. “What does it mean?” he asks absently.
“Jarvis, full work up please, and cross reference the prototype scan with the current connection sites in the reactor port. Generate a plan for modifying the current prototype to best fit with ports and configure the ports for highest power conservation.”
I would have still looked twice at you. Because you still would have that smile. And those eyes. And all – you.” The spell breaks again, and Tony looks away, the tips of his ears turning pink. “If we’d met before all that, I’d still have noticed you.”
Whenever they both have a free moment, he’s up in the lab or they’re in the rooftop garden together. They’re not
It’s time to shed a little light, Dear Reader, on some events of the recent past of which you might not be aware.  You see, Obadiah Stane was not who Howard Stark had intended to inherit his pride and joy. No, that honor fell to the heir apparent, his son Anthony.
James Rhodes, once he puts a name to the comforting back rub, is the first person who ends up sticking around. He even sticks around to endure the abuse of a massively hungover Tony, begging for coffee and death by turn. He sticks around because he can remember how it felt to be the new kid, and every time he looks at Tony he can see himself, bouncing around from school to school as a military brat. He can remember how lonely it is to have no one in your corner, and knows how easily lost and lonely people can self-destruct. So James stays, awkwardly declines the offer of a thank you blowjob from this probably still drunk kid, (and decides not to think too hard about why a kid only sixteen offers blowjobs so easily) and earns himself a place by Tony Stark, current wunderkind and future genius.
“No, hey, if you’re back, you’re coming out with us.” Bucky swings his legs over the side of the bed and levers himself up to standing with the help of a gleaming metal arm. He stretches and reaches for his battered bomber jacket. “Tasha and Clint found a speakeasy nearby, and we’ve barely seen you all week. I’ll drag you if I have to.”
curious about Tony?” Natasha steps forward so they’re almost toe to toe, and Steve feels the strength of her stare like a physical push. “From what you’ve said, he rarely leaves his lab, he never leaves work, you don’t know where he lives. Isn’t that a little strange to you?”
“Sure, it is.” Steve looks down at his hands. “You’ve always been able to make me laugh, Tony. I’ve never felt more like myself, or less like a monster, than when I’m with you.”
“Firstly, Obadiah Stane has taken an unexpected leave of absence from his position as CEO. He left the office some time last night, and we haven’t heard from him since. Once the requisite 48 hours have passed, we will be filing a police report. We hope all is well and that he returns safely. In the meantime, I will be taking over as interim CEO.”
He lets out a sigh of relief, and a little of disappointment. He doesn’t want to have to explain himself, but dammit, he also doesn’t want her pity, Jesus. “Jarvis, warm up the chair please.”
Steve’s long eyelashes flutter, like he’s waking up from an afternoon nap rather than blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Tony’s heart clenches at how beautiful he is, even in the black trappings of a killer.
“Yes, sir. In Ms. Potts’ office. In times like these I have been programmed to contact the authorities, but something is blocking my signal and I can’t access any communication device outside of the company network. I am attempting to find a solution, but I would recommend hurrying, sir, as I don’t see this situation ending particularly well.”
“Yeah, sure. That’s why they have me alone, ‘cause I don’t play well with others.” He knows his smile is more of a baring of teeth than an expression of happiness, but this hits too close to home. He’s not proud of who he was, and he’s barely started to become someone he actually likes, he doesn’t really want to be reminded that he’s still being punished for who his dad was. He turns his head quickly, startled out of the thought, at the gentle touch of fingers to his cheek.
This could only mean one thing. The school called his parents and now one of them was calling to see where he was. If it’s Steve, it’s a loud phone call. If it’s Tony, it’s a calm but serious phone call. Pulling out his cell, he looked at the screen and cursed himself as a picture of Steve showed on the screen. He had to pick it up but he didn’t want to. In truth he was a bit scared. Sliding the green bar over, he placed the phone to his ear. “Hey dad.” He said, trying to keep the fear out of his voice.
"No, he won't. He's not coming home until after Christmas. He called me already. Said he has to stay at the base." Peter stopped typing as he thought of what this Christmas was going to be like. He had all the love in the world for his father's. But they both worked too damn much. And it's always been that way. He shouldn't be angry about it now.
By the time the two got outside, the quiet Queens street was a little less quiet. Kids enjoying the days off school were bustling about in the snow. And so was Jarvis. Peter knew huskies enjoyed the cold weather and smiled as his puppy hopped into the huge mounds on the side of the street. He walked the dog a little further than he intended before turning back and heading to the house. "A little extra since I won't be home until late tonight." Peter said to the dog as they went up the stairs together.
Giggling, Gwen finished her ice cream and tossed the cup into the trash. "No, no. It was very inspiring. Practically poetic. Ever thought about writing, Mr. I-Don't-Want-To-Be-A-Photographer?" She told him with a smile.
Peter felt his heart fall into the pit of his stomach and frowned. “Wait...you guys never said anything about being grounded. You said to do the dishes.” He quickly tried to come to his own defense, but anything against Steve was futile.
But Peter had frozen on the spot. Heart medicine? When and why was Tony taking a heart medicine? Did Steve know? Was Tony going to be alright?
“Oh, I got you something.” Peter boasted and reached into his coat inside pocket. He pulled out a plastic bag and smiled sheepishly, mentally hating himself for not buying a gift bag. “Sorry I couldn’t wrap it or anything...I, uh, hope you like it even so.” He stumbled over his words a bit, quickly clearing his throat.
The smile that spewed across his features was immaculate. Peter let out a small laugh as he took the picture from her hands and looked at it carefully. "Except for one thing." He said, looking up to see her waiting expectantly. Turning the picture over, he held it out to Gwen so she could take it back. "You took this picture, Gwen. Not me."
Steve acted as though he were seriously considering the argument before shrugging and looked around the room. “What’s all the noise up here anyway?” Steve finally asked, leaning against the doorframe.
Slowly, the fireworks became less until they stopped and the cart door opened for them to exit. The train rides home were peaceful for the time of night. First they took Gwen home. Then Peter insisted on getting Harry back to his place safely. Now on the train alone, Peter felt at peace.
Nodding, Peter spoke of the first time his father’s took him there when he was smaller. Afterwards they would go to the movie theater across the street and Tony would always insist on bringing a pack of Zeppole from the pizzeria in as a snack. Gwen listened and laughed. Peter felt more comfortable than he did earlier with all of his negative thoughts. She was really cool. Way cooler than he had thought. And he was really liking her. Once they made it to the place, Peter ordered two oven baked slices and four Zeppole before he and Gwen took a seat. He felt happy that he could pay for the meal. It showed Gwen, he hoped, that he was a gentlemen and would never let a woman pay for a meal.
Gwen immediately heard the worry in his voice. She placed her hot chocolate down on the table softly and stood up. “It’s okay, Peter. I understand. Come on.” She took his hand softly as to reassure him and led them out of the building.
"Merry Christmas, pop." Peter smiled into the receiver as he leaned to pull on his pants. "Dad got me a puppy! A husky! His name is Jarvis." At the mention of his name, Jarvis jumped off the bed and rushed over to Peter's legs.
With a smile, Peter put his phone on the charger and headed off to bed. He was excited to spend the summer with his girlfriend and boyfriend, with both of his dad’s home and safe, it was going to be an exciting summer vacation.
"Yeah, we did. The soldiers were happy. It's better than the normal DFac food. And they had pie so I was happy. Had my good ol' American apple pie!" Steve boasted with a laugh.
He didn’t wait for a response before opening the door. Tony lay on the bed under the covers flipping through the channels. Looking confused, he noticed the cup in his son's hand and sighed. Peter placed the mug a bit harshly down on the bedside table and crossed his arms, ignoring the splash of coffee that spilled. “Really? What part of you shouldn’t be drinking for a while, did you not understand when the doctor told you?” He hated sounding like the parent in situations with his parents, but this was a serious ordeal.
“Who?” Steve demanded. Shaking his head, Peter made his way into the dining area and took a seat, letting out a yelp of pain, regretting it as soon as his father walked in, demanding once more to know where else he was in pain. Peter lifted his shirt to show the bandaged up areas. Steve peeled off the bandages to reveal several dark bruises, though they seemed to be healing up quickly and evenly. Nothing broken. “At least you patched them up expertly.” Steve complimented.
He finally met her eyes, his heart practically stopping. It was unconsciously, or so he figured, as his feet angled themselves so that he was facing Gwen directly. His eyes must have been playing tricks on him, or so he thought, because it seemed as if she was getting closer to him. Everything kicked back into his mind when he felt his hand grab hers, their faces mere inches apart. Peter took a deep breath and quickly took the pictures from her hands. “Anyways, these are yours to keep.” He nodded, taking a few steps back and placing the pictures back in the folder.
Peter gave a soft nod. “It’s okay, it will take them getting used to. When I brought up the conversation after we had agreed to start dating again, I had to explain to them what a polyamorous relationship was. Especially Steve. He’s extremely old school.”
“I need you to get home. Now. I’m here with your dad. Just...come home.” Bucky spoke into the receiver, obviously trying to stay calm.
A bit hesitant, Harry walked into the foyer and was quickly approached by the Husky. “Hey Jarvis. You’re getting too big.” He smiled as he pet the massive pup.
Internally, Peter was thankful she didn't look up at him. If she had, he would have not been able to turn down the offer. There was something about to her house and meeting her family on such an intimate holiday that scared him from the prospect of saying yes. "That's very nice of you, Gwen. Thank you...but I'll have to decline. I have prior engagements." Which wasn't a lie, he did have prior engagements. He didn't even have to call beforehand. This was more routine than anything.
Tony made to leave, but then turned back. “Hey, Peter. Next time, give that kid a run for his money.” When Peter looked up at him, Tony winked and then closed the door.
Peter closed his mouth as tears quickly overtook him once more and his chest heaved with sobs. “Harry!” He got up and rushed over, quickly throwing his arms around Harry who met him with a tight embrace.
Waving his hand nonchalantly as if to brush it off, Tony continued flipping through the channels. “I didn’t put in a lot. Just a hint to help my mood. Relax. You’re starting to sound like Steve.”
It took Peter a moment longer before he was able to peel his feet from the ground and rush off to class.
"Hey." Gwen responded on the other end. The first thing Peter noticed was that she didn't sound like her chipper self. Her voice cracked a bit and was horsed deeply.
Looking back and forth, Tony placed his fork back into the spaghetti and shrugged, looking to Peter. “Steve made the sauce.” He accused.
“Well, I am happy you were able to ease them into it.” Harry said before pulling Peter into another kiss.
“Give me that, smart ass.” Steve laughed as he took the stuff and put it into his bag. “I’m proud of you son. Congratulations.”
He let Gwen take a few more pictures, she even took some of him which he didn’t mind but he wasn’t one for being in pictures. He half smiled in almost all of them and shied away on a few. Gwen stopped in front of a house that had a tree decorated and called Peter over. “Let’s take a picture together.”
Peter was shaking his head already. “No one. I mean, she is someone--but no one that I--we’ve never even-- until today but.” He took a breath, hating himself for answering that first question in the worst possible way. His face felt as hot as it was probably red and he looked down at his knees.
“Not any that I know of. Even so, I’m tired of entering science fairs. There’s never any good competition.” Peter joked as he pulled his controller closer to his chest. “Though I was thinking of maybe going to Oscorp for an internship. Teachers been talking about their science programs. Think it’s worth looking into?”
Smiling, Gwen took the folder and placed it in her backpack. “Thank you, Peter. I had a really great time yesterday.”
Peter quickly got out and rushed over to the back of the truck. A tall man tried to stop him, but Peter shoved past him and climbed into the back. “That’s my father! Dad?!” Peter quickly grabbed onto Tony’s hand. His eyes were shut and he had an oxygen mask attached. “What’s going on? What happened?!” Peter looked to the emergency response team as they climbed into the truck and started closing the back doors.
