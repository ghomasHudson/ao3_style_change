invited. In fact, if I see him anywhere near this house or Jack again after you leave tomorrow, I will get an official restraining order. Do I make myself clear?"
"Thank you, my Alpha. Can you stand up?"
Dean smiled. “Sounds good to me.”
"Nah. I'm cheaper." The man flashed a smile that had probably melted the hearts of women all over Texas. "Come on. My car's right outside."
"Mmm." Dean stepped in close and slipped an arm around Castiel's waist. "Good thing I'm not planning to hurt you then."
Cas perched on the one free corner of the bed and watched the brotherly bickering with an amused/contented smile on his face.
Castiel felt a momentary twist of pain in his chest as he watched the good natured brotherly bickering. He vaguely remembered a time when he and Jimmy had been able to argue without actually arguing, back when their lives had been … Well, not happy, but full of simple, familiar miseries that they endured side by side. He dragged his attention back to the present before he could get sucked too deep into the quicksand of memories, and he realized Sam was talking to him now.
Dean took a moment to breathe and let his heart climb out of his stomach before asking, "So what happened?"
Dean led the way back into the bedroom and gestured Cas towards the pile on the floor. "You choose," he said shyly.
"Okay. Thank you for telling me, Alpha. You can come this time. Whenever you're ready." Castiel wasn't sure he could have lasted much longer himself anyway.
"Well, with kids it's less about quality than it is about familiarity. What's she used to?"
"Yeah, it's better if he doesn't see this one. I got something else to give you inside." He handed Dean a small, flat square wrapped in silver paper.
"A little after midnight. Did you have trouble getting her to sleep? I'm sorry. I should have told you it was all right to call me if she was scared."
It was getting easier to breathe again, but he kept acting like he couldn't. If she thought he was no threat, maybe he could move fast enough to get that blade away from her.
Castiel sighed. If he didn't deserve to be happy, why had the universe given him Dean Winchester? It seemed incredibly unfair. "Yes. I hear you," he said which was true. He didn't say anything about believing it.
He told Benny everything, from their plan to convince Cas' family that they were courting, and the "fake" claiming bite, to Michael's attitude towards Dean and Dean's growing suspicion that Michael had no intention of ever giving back custody no matter what Cas did. The only part he left out were his very real feelings for Cas. Benny had scened with them a few times, and he was a perceptive man, so he had likely noticed Dean's utter devotion to his Dom. While Dean obviously enjoyed watching Benny fuck Cas, he had never allowed anyone other than Cas to touch him during a scene, and Benny had tactfully never mentioned it.
Castiel didn't think he could take much more of this conversation without blurting out the truth, so without opening his eyes, he tilted his head to the side, baring his scent gland to Dean in a silent invitation.
"Fair point."
After a little more quiet cuddling, Dean said, "You want to finish the movie?"
"No. I, um… I want to. You want to go first and I'll follow in a couple minutes or…"
"Her. My apologies. Force of habit. I'm seeing
. Castiel wondered what the real April was like and why she had chosen to let an angel possess her. "No one has to get hurt."
Castiel frowned in confusion. "Of course not. I love you, Dean. I don't want anyone else."
“Yeah, but it’s … unexpected, I guess. I don’t normally trust people this fast.”
"No, no, no, no." Dean tripped over his words as he rushed to explain and soothe Cas's fears. "I still want to have sex with you, but I want you … I mean I want us to be
Dean opened his mouth, probably to object to the adorable part, but Castiel clenched his ass hard, effectively shutting him up.
Castiel gave a watery laugh. "Maybe. A little."
He re-slicked his cock one more time. When he pushed back into Dean, the alpha gave a contented sigh, completely surrendering to the pleasure now that he knew he didn't have to hold back or control himself anymore.
Dean tensed, but only a little, and the animal wariness that always came into his eyes when he thought Castiel was about to get mad at him was far less pronounced than it would have been a month ago. Castiel was glad to see that Dean was growing more confident in their relationship, trusting that even when they disagreed, they could talk things out without it turning into a fight.
Naomi's expression was sympathetic which was even more unnerving than the politeness. "Maybe not on purpose, but I've known men like him before. They have short attention spans. When the next fascinating new thing comes along …"
With every word Cas let his hand slide a little closer to Dean's cock, and Dean's eyes followed its progress in the mirror, mesmerized. When Cas finally cupped him through the panties and squeezed firmly, Dean's head fell back onto Cas's shoulder and his mouth opened in a groan of pure ecstasy. "Ohhhh, Cas."
And when they weren't fucking or sleeping, Dean focused his energy on minimizing Castiel's discomfort any way he could — keeping him clean, making sure he drank enough water, and massaging his back and legs so the muscles wouldn't seize up from the contorted positions he had to spend most of his time in. If Castiel hadn't already been in love with Dean, he would have been well on his way to it by the time he finally woke with no twinging pains in his gut and no burning desire between his legs.
Dean closed his eyes and counted to ten, reminding himself that his brother didn’t mean the words to be hurtful. He just didn’t understand. “I
“Well, maybe if you met someone between now and the wed—”
Suddenly Castiel couldn't bear one more moment of this strange new distance that had sprung up between him and Dean in the past couple days. Before he could second guess himself, he crossed the room and wrapped his arms around Dean from behind, pressing his nose into the alpha's neck. Dean relaxed into him without hesitation, one hand coming up to card through Castiel's hair while he tilted his head to give the omega better access to his scent gland. Although he hadn't meant to initiate anything but a little cuddling and scenting for comfort, Castiel couldn't help the thrill of arousal that raced through him as he felt the alpha go pliant and trusting in his arms. Dean caught the scent of thunderstorms in the air, and his own scent quickly turned rich and spicy in response.
"What's the snowman song?" Dean asked.
~o0o~
"Just the only one I want to fuck," Dean said, adding a second finger.
"No, but you're here, and you've been nice to me. I just … I don't want to be alone right now."
Castiel had to stifle a scream as he came harder than he ever had in his life. Dean wasn't far behind, and Castiel thought that the feeling of Dean spilling inside him without a condom might have actually triggered a second orgasm. It certainly seemed like a long time passed before he even started to come down.
"Mmm. That sounds promising. Maybe I should have held out a little longer."
Sitting at that table with Dean's hand resting comfortably on his knee, passing burgers and salads back and forth, joining in the conversation when his mouth wasn't full of delicious homemade food, Cas didn't feel at all out of place. He felt like he had come home.
A Novak family specialty. The implied
~o0o~
"Right," Cas said slowly. "I was planning to drive out tomorrow and spend the night so I could be with Jack for Christmas morning. Is that all right?"
The next several days were a torment worse than his ten thousand years of solitude. Every time Dean stood a little closer to him than usual or looked at him in silence for a long moment, Castiel's heart beat faster and he was sure that Dean was about to say it. But his hopes were always dashed as Dean blushed and moved away or lowered his eyes.
To his surprise, after staring at him contemplatively for a moment, she dragged her pillow to the middle of the bed and snuggled up against his shoulder, her cat smushed between them. She had been distant with him so far. He'd attributed it to her not knowing him very well and maybe a fear that showing him affection would be a betrayal of her father. He tentatively stroked her hair. She sighed contentedly and let her eyes drift closed.
"No probs," Charlie said. "I'm kind of between jobs right now, so … lots of free time." There was something off about the way she said it, a hint of sadness behind her too bright smile, but before Dean could ask about it, her eyes slid past him to where Cas was standing a little uncertainly nearby. "You guys got a new roommate?"
Jack closed his eyes and burrowed down into his soft flannel sheets. Castiel watched the rise and fall of his shoulders starting to slow, and sat on the edge of the bed, stroking his son's hair and wondering at how much he loved this person who wouldn't exist if not for some bad suppressants and a stupid, impulsive decision made by a scared, nineteen-year-old omega.
Then his feet were up off the floor for the third time that night, Dean's tongue was thrusting possessively into his mouth, and that salty, musky taste was
The question was so lost, so bewildered, and Dean's inner alpha howled and whimpered and begged him to open the door, take Cas in his arms, kiss away the pain that
"Castiel, I'd like to go over the new menu if you have a minute." As usual the polite phrasing did not disguise the fact that this was an order.
“Yeah,” Gabriel said, and for a moment he let the devil-may-care mask fall away, his true self showing through, raw and fragile and a much better person than most people realized. “Yeah, me too.” Then he reached his quota of emotional vulnerability for the time being and shrugged off Cas’s hand. “But enough about me. You were about to tell me if your supermodel grease monkey boyfriend is any good between the sheets.”
He tried to work on the new menu, but after an hour he still hadn't made even the tiniest bit of progress, and his eyes kept drifting to his phone. Just one quick call, just to hear his voice. It was Monday. They wouldn't see each other until tomorrow night which had seemed like a minor annoyance before his conversation with Principal Mills. Now it seemed unbearable. He wrestled with temptation, knowing all along that he was going to break.
: NSFW
“Yep.”
"I second that."
Dean turned off the engine and got out. Castiel followed suit, and they stood side by side, waiting. Birds chirped, squirrels chattered, and a warm breeze rustled the leaves on the trees. "Maybe he didn't see you make the turn," Castiel said when they had been waiting almost ten minutes. "Maybe we lost him."
They had agreed to sleep in separate rooms for the time being. Firstly because their bodies might not recover at the same speed, and this way no one would feel pressured to take care of anyone else's needs before they were ready. And secondly, a little distance would help the pseudo mating bond that formed between an alpha and an omega during a heat cycle to fade faster which would make it easier for Dean to keep his territorial instincts in check.
"We should probably take this inside," Dean groaned as Cas wriggled under him, not trying to reverse their positions, just seeking some relief from the increasingly urgent situation in his pants. "Before poor old Mrs. Reynolds comes out to water her flowers and finds out way more than she ever wanted to know about the mechanics of gay sex."
Dean kept silent.
“Cassie,” Gabe countered, deadpan, then immediately switched to a pleading tone. “Come on. Let me live vicariously. My sex life is nonexistent at the moment.”
Instead of trying to come up with words that would inevitably fail to do justice to how amazing he felt right now, Dean hooked a hand behind Cas's neck and pulled him into a kiss. It was less urgent than before, their need taken care of and only want remaining, but Dean found that his desire for this man had not diminished in the slightest. The sex had only sated one hunger. He still craved Cas's presence, the sound of his voice and the taste of his mouth, the warm, encircling safety of his arms. That had never happened before. Once the sex was over, he usually wanted his own space again. He didn't do cuddling.
He closed the door very quietly and let the towel fall to the floor. Then he carefully climbed onto the bed, grateful once again for his memory foam mattress which didn't bounce or squeak. He laid down on his side, face to face with Cas, and reached out to stroke the omega's cheek, feeling the prickle of stubble under his palm. Cas hated shaving, finding it a tedious and uncomfortable process, but he also disliked having a beard, saying it itched (although Dean thought he looked damn sexy with a beard), so he compromised by shaving as infrequently as possible, maintaining a permanent five o'clock shadow (which was also pretty damn sexy in Dean's opinion).
route since Cas could clearly smell that that wasn't true. Instead he said, "It's not your fault, Cas. You didn't do anything wrong, but you need to go. I need you to go."
Cas thought about it for a moment. He hadn’t missed the way Dean slipped in a mention of his sister’s
"It might actually be worse than that," Castiel said. "The Rit Zien may not be able to distinguish between true depression and someone who's just … having a bad day. The ebb and flow of human emotions is bewildering even to me, and I've been on Earth for years. To an angel still wounded and traumatized from the fall it must be completely overwhelming."

disappointed. Do you understand?"
"Seems fair," the man said. He thought for a minute.
Dean opened Cas' pants, and Cas lifted his ass off the bed so Dean could pull them off along with his underwear. Cas' cock stood out proudly between his strong thighs, flushed with blood and already dripping pre-come. He might be an omega, but he was very definitely a
. "Cas, I … I don't want us to be friends who have sex."
Castiel laughed, and Dean shuddered and moaned.
He saw Dean frown occasionally, but the man never said anything beyond the occasional teasing comment about what an adorable child Castiel had been. And Castiel knew that even after this, if Castiel still didn't want to tell the whole story, Dean wouldn't push.
be the one to jinx it.
This time Castiel held the book more carefully, stroking its cover as reverently as Dean had. It was the first thing he had ever owned.
Cas sighed with relief and rested his head against Dean’s. “Well, you could start by taking me back to bed.”
"Just talk to him, Dean," Sam said gently. "Tell him how you feel. And like I said, don't make any assumptions."
Castiel was only dimly aware of an argument taking place above his head. A restaurant employee had come over and was telling the woman to leave. The woman was protesting that she was a paying customer, and the employee was explaining less than patiently that that didn't give her the right to harass the other paying customers and frighten their children. But between Claire's screaming and his own mounting panic as he tried and failed to calm her down, Castiel had no attention to spare for anything else.
Castiel could feel the blood pounding in his ears, but this time it was anger, not panic. "It seems you've left me no choice," he said flatly, knowing that Michael in his arrogance would interpret that as surrender.
They both burst out laughing. "That … Oh, God, that was corny," Cas said between fits of giggles.
either. You certainly don't owe me any favors."
About halfway through this little speech, Castiel had lifted his head to look at Dean, and he was immediately mesmerized by the fire in those green eyes. When Dean had finished making his point, Castiel kissed him softly on the lips. "I love you," he murmured, "and I promise that if the McLeods or anyone else ever cross a line, I won't let Naomi bully me into letting it slide. I will tell you before I even bothered discussing it with her, and we will decide how to handle it together."
Cas smiled like a cat that got the cream. "Then you may prep yourself while you wait. You may give yourself as much pleasure as you wish while doing so, but you may not come. And I give you fair warning," he raised one eyebrow in that way of his that always made Dean's blood boil, "I'm not going to go easy on you tonight, and if you come before I tell you to, I will be
Like Cas with his bees, Dean didn’t need much encouragement to talk about cars. He told Cas about a ‘73 Dodge Charger that he was rebuilding practically from scrap. “The guy thought she just needed new spark plugs, but when we opened her up the battery was rusted, the fuel line was leaking, and about a dozen other things. It’s a miracle she didn’t go up in flames…” The next time he happened to glance at the alarm clock on the bedside table, it was after ten. “God. Sorry. I’m probably putting you to sleep.”
"I love Moana!" Jack crowed excitedly.
"Not because it was good," Dean hurried to reassure him. "I knew that if you were even half as good at sex as you are at kissing, it was gonna make my top three, and did I mention best sex of my life?"
While his body was still healing, it was easy for Castiel to justify not leaving the bunker. But the stitches had come out weeks ago, the bruises were almost invisible, and he had even gained a little weight thanks to Dean practically force feeding him homemade, protein rich soups and stews. He felt better than he had in a very long time. Not just strong and healthy, but happy too. (The frequent and extremely satisfying sex might have had something to do with that.) So he had no choice but to admit that the reason he hadn't been outside in almost a month had nothing to do with illness or exhaustion or even depression.
Castiel raised an imperious eyebrow. He had let Dean off the hook once already tonight. He couldn't be
“Yes, I’d love to.”
"If I still had any doubts about that, I don't after today. If all you wanted was sex, you would never have risked telling me about your brother."
. This is non-negotiable."
Dean snorted and said what he always said to that. "Pretty sure I'm the lucky one."
"Where's Claire?"
"So," Dean said as he carefully secured the butterfly bandage to Cas's head, "in high school there was this girl. Rhonda Hurley. We weren't exactly friends, but she was a cheerleader and I was on the football team, so we hung out a lot, and in senior year she asked me out. I didn't really like her all that much. She was kind of a bully and she had the most annoying laugh I have ever heard, but she was drop dead gorgeous and no straight teenage boy in his right mind would have said no to her, and I really needed people to think I was straight."
"I know you will." Castiel cupped his cheek and thumbed another tear away. "I know that, Dean. That's why I'm comfortable letting you have full parental rights to Jack. Can we talk to Sam about making it legal? Not to be morbid, but if something happened to me, I don't want Michael getting back custody or, heaven forbid, foster care. I know he will always be safe with you."
"That you've learned something a lot of parents never figure out. Kids ain't supposed to be well behaved all the time. They're not little angels. They're human beings with feelings and opinions." She reached up and patted his cheek, and even though he usually didn't like to be touched by strangers, this felt as natural as if she was his own grandmother. "She'll come back to herself eventually, sugar, and when she does, you remember to thank the Lord for every sulk and every slammed door."
Cas sat up slowly, relieved when the room didn’t tilt and spin around him, but he still kept one hand on Grace’s back while they walked to the bathroom. He was much more prone to fainting early in the morning when his body was still adjusting to consciousness. Grace kept pace with him perfectly and watched him carefully while he went through his morning routine, alert for any sign of unsteadiness.
"Oh, there were sparks." His gaze drifted down to Dean's mouth as he remembered how perfect those lips had felt on his, how utterly gorgeous they looked all pink and swollen and wet with Castiel's saliva. Alone in his bed after Dean had gone, he'd gotten himself off to the image of those lips doing things far less innocent than a little kissing. He wondered if Dean had done the same.
The flash of light blinded Castiel for a moment, and while he was still blinking away the afterimages, a foot connected with his ribs hard enough to knock the breath out of him. He hit the ground sideways, gravel cutting into his cheek. His lungs didn't seem to be working very well, and he gasped uselessly like a beached fish. A pair of feet came into his line of sight, and then the girl who wasn't April crouched down in front of his face.
He half smiled and nodded. He didn't need to ask how she'd known exactly what he was thinking. She was an omega too.
Sam took a deep, calming breath through his mouth and said, "You're right. I'm sorry." He even tipped his head back a little, baring his throat to Dean.

was causing. He gripped the sink harder, using the cold and the ache in his fingers to ground him, distract him from his burning need.
Castiel was becoming more fluent in Dean Winchester every day, and he knew that what he was really saying was,
"Okay," Castiel said, and his breathlessness and racing heart were only partly from the thorough kissing he'd just been given. "So tell me … tell me how you feel about me." He wasn't going to ask for anything more specific than that. The words had to be Dean's own, not spoon fed to him.
"Got ants in your pants, Winchester?" Charlie said quietly under the high pitched chatter of the kids gossiping about what Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa presents they were hoping to get.
"Yes, I love you too, dumbass. I've been in love with you basically since the day I met you."
“Best I’ve ever had,” Cas said with a shit eating grin. “And that’s all I have to say on the subject.”
“She, and yes, Grace likes most people.”
"Mmm. I love you too."
"So, um … what now?" the man asked.
His jumping around had finally taken him a little too close to the edge of the bed, and both Dean and Cas dove to catch him. Dean managed to grab Jack around the waist before he tipped over, but Jack was too excited to notice the close call and immediately started wriggling out of Dean's arms and onto the floor. The little alpha danced out of the room, singing happily to himself, "Presents, presents, Christmas presents," while Dean was still trying to calm his racing heart. Kids wake you up faster than coffee for sure.
"It's not funny. I'm just … happy. I don't know what I did to deserve you."
Sam's mouth twitched. "I notice you didn't say anything about it being too soon."
In December Anna gave birth to a healthy baby girl, and Dean officially stepped into the role of sous chef at
Dean was just on the other side of the hall. Castiel could go to him right now, wake him with a soft kiss, whisper to him in the dark.
Dean swallowed down the lump in his throat. "There is nothing wrong with me." He even believed it. At least for that moment.
Sam sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. He hadn’t slept well last night, his mind subconsciously waiting for the familiar rumble of the Impala and Dean’s footsteps on the stairs. “You’re right. I do. I’m sorry. I just can’t figure out why you suddenly feel the need to sneak around. You know I have no problem with you liking guys.” A thought occurred to him. “It
"Yeah." Dean pressed their foreheads together, tasting Cas's breath warm and sweet on his own lips when he said, "Are you sure? Like really,
"What was that for?" Cas asked with a bemused smile when they parted.
He had almost slipped up. No, he
"Money," Cas said promptly. "Photography is a business like any other, and it takes time to get established and turn a profit. How am I supposed to live in the meantime?"
“My father died last night.”
Dean sat there a moment longer, thinking about the package currently hidden in his suitcase. He had already resigned himself that it wouldn't be there in time when the FedEx truck pulled up just as he was putting their bags in the car yesterday. It was probably sacrilegious to count that as a Christmas miracle, especially considering what the package contained (and the use to which Dean intended to put it), but he was very relieved that it wouldn't be sitting on his front steps for two days, at risk of water damage and thieves.
"Up here, babe," Dean called back. "In Sam's room."
"A few months."
Dean stroked his hair, realizing (though not for the first time) that he would never really understand how it worked inside Cas's head. Cas was so naive about some things, it was like talking to a child, except Cas
"I'm on my way."
There was something odd about that answer. It didn't quite ring true, but Castiel didn't think Dean was outright lying. It was more like he was trying to convince himself.
"But you wish he was," the girl said with certainty. "Why don't you make a move?"
He laughed but resisted the urge to continue trading emojis with his boyfriend to see who could be more sickeningly affectionate. Instead he quickly saved the picture of Claire before tucking the phone back in his pocket and returning to his pies.
Several thousand miles away, Sam winced. “Well, it certainly doesn’t seem like you’ve been lonely this weekend.”
Dean reached up to cup Castiel's cheek, and Castiel couldn't help but to lean into the touch. "You know you're the only person who can say shit like that to me and actually make me believe it," Dean said with a soft smile.
"Sounds perfect," Dean said, and his smile was genuine even though there was worry lurking behind his eyes.
"Leave and see if he follows." Dean didn't seem completely unaffected by their little charade either. His pupils were more dilated than the brightly lit store warranted, and his scent was getting stronger, earthier.
Once the last shuddering, blissful spasm had passed, Dean very carefully sat up and scooted them back towards the headboard so that Cas could rest his weight against Dean's chest while they came down. The omega immediately buried his face in Dean's neck and breathed deep, and Dean needed no encouragement to do the same. He loved the way Cas smelled after sex. He loved the way Cas smelled
Also, Claire is the name of Cas's cat. I only mentioned her once before and one of my beta readers got confused, so I thought I should remind you.
"Why? All the pornographic parts are covered."
Castiel had thought that Dean was a big man. Sam Winchester was bigger. Even sitting down he looked tall, and the cafe's signature oversized coffee mugs looked like part of a child's tea set in his huge hands. But while Dean took on the world with a grin and a wink, projecting confidence no matter what he was feeling on the inside, Sam held himself cautiously, arms pulled in close, shoulders a little hunched, trying to make himself small. Castiel wondered if that was a defense mechanism he'd learned in prison or if he'd always been that way.
Dean finally came all the way into the room and sat down across from Sam. “Yeah. I mean, I think so, and I’m pretty sure he thinks so. I don’t know how long it’s gonna last, but it’s definitely more than a fling.”
"It's a
should move in with you after the wedding,” Sam said, only half joking.
He felt Dean shift beside him. "You were twins?"
"And this little cutie is Tasha." Max reached down to ruffle his daughter's hair. She resembled both her fathers with Max's dark skin and black hair and Aaron's big brown puppy eyes. "You want to say hi, Tash?" Max asked gently. He looked directly into the little girl's face as he talked to her, and Castiel realized he was making sure she could read his lips.
Castiel's own raging erection, still trapped in his jeans, gave a warning throb. This was going to send him over the edge just as fast as it was sending Dean. He pulled off but stayed close, laying soft, reassuring kisses on the insides of Dean's thighs until the other man came down enough to raise his head and look at Castiel with a mixture of frustrated confusion and awe.
"And is there a reason for all of them?" Cas nuzzled a little bluebird on Dean's ribs. The curve of the branch it was sitting on said,
"I've never wanted anyone else," Cas said as though explaining that the sky was blue and water was wet.
Claire looked back and forth between the brothers, and for a moment Castiel was afraid that she thought they were really arguing, but then she put down her fork and pulled out her little notepad and pencil.
"Hey. What was that all about?" Dean said gently. "You're not usually squeamish."
With a tremendous effort, Dean lifted his head again and looked into Cas's eyes just as wet, slightly sticky warmth flooded between their stomachs. Cas gave a low, wrecked moan that barely sounded human, but his eyes stayed locked on Dean's even as he shuddered and writhed under him. Only once his body went limp with exhaustion and satiation did he let his head fall back and his eyes slip closed.
"I said we couldn't scene tonight. I never said," Castiel leaned forward until his lips brushed Dean's, "we couldn't fuck."
Cas' expression hardened. "You mean he thinks you allow me too much independence."
Sam felt a grin spread over his face and heard himself say before he could bite back the words, "Well, no friggin duh."
Dean shrugged. "He's a good friend. He's easy to talk to and… very calming to be around. And yeah, maybe there used to be something more there. Was a time when I could even see myself settling down with him, get married, adopt some kids who needed a good home. But then…"
"Dude, I get that you're worried about him, but can you please get your scent under control? It reeks in here."
"Dean?" Castiel knelt down in front of him but didn't touch him. "Do you … Do you not want me here?" His inner omega keened in distress. He needed to be here. He needed to help his alpha. But he would not force himself on Dean. Dean would never do that to him under any circumstances.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fall asleep."
"I'm angry at him," Castiel whispered, admitting it to himself for the first time. "I'm angry at him for leaving me to raise Claire all by myself, and I feel guilty for being angry because it wasn't his fault, and I know he would never have chosen to leave her, not like —"
"Your big Sasquatch hands are probably mashing all the buttons at once. How can you even see what you're doing?"
"So now we're getting married?" Dean chuckled, clearly trying to lighten the mood. "Kinda fast, don't you think?"
"Good point."
"Love you too," Dean chuckled when he could talk again. "Where am I putting this stuff?"
"Make my own lube? No, but there's artificial stuff you can buy. How do you think gay beta guys do it?" (Or alphas who liked other alphas. Dean had only once let an alpha knot him. He hadn't been able to walk or sit normally for almost a week.) "Or we could just use yours," he said, sliding a finger into Cas, smooth and easy as a kiss. "Looks like you've got plenty to spare."
"He'll be fine with it," Dean said with certainty, thinking of Cas's trusting smile, his parting words.
her grandmother had died. She just cuddled a little closer to Castiel and patted his arm. It took him a moment to realize she was comforting him. In her own wordless way she was telling him,
Naomi gave him a glare that would have incinerated a lesser man, but she didn't want to cause any more of a scene than they already had, so she followed him back to the kitchen before starting in on him. "How many times, Castiel? You cannot throw a tantrum every time someone doesn't like your food. He's the customer, so if he says the foie gras isn't done, it's not done. End of story."
Jodi gave him the warmest, most motherly hug he'd experienced since his own mother was alive to hug him, and said, "Welcome to the family," with such sincerity that he had to blink away tears.
Dean headed for the closed in porch at the back of the house that Cas had converted into a photography studio. That was only one of many changes that Cas's little house had undergone in the last year. The best change, of course, had occurred four months ago when Dean officially moved in.
Watching Dean take clothes from his drawer in Castiel's dresser almost made up for the fact that he was covering up all that gorgeous, golden, freckled skin. Castiel really wanted to just ask him to officially move in already, but it was probably too soon for that. He knew Dean was enjoying sharing an apartment with Sam after eight years separated by prison bars, so he had offered up space in his closet instead which Dean had happily accepted.
"Good. Let me know if that changes." Castiel climbed off Dean's chest and grabbed one of the other pillows. "Lift your hips."
"Missionary," Castiel decided, rolling onto his back. "And go slow. Make it last."
The class they chose was specifically geared towards families with deaf and/or mute children, and Castiel was relieved to see that he and Dean weren't the only same sex couple there. There were two other men with a five or six year old girl. They also relaxed visibly when they saw Dean and Castiel among all the straight couples. Castiel made a mental note to say hello later.
Dean's inner alpha preened.
The day room wasn't crowded since most people visited their loved ones  on Christmas Day. In the far corner stood a tree which the staff had decorated with both store-bought ornaments and ones the residents had made. Colorful paper chains were strung in random droops across the ceiling, and someone had painted festive designs on the edges of the windows. All in all, they'd managed to impose a homey holiday feel on the institutional room. John Winchester had parked his wheelchair in front of the TV and was ignoring everything around him.
Doris hesitated a moment, and then she crouched down next to them and smiled kindly at Claire. "Hey, sweetheart, what's your name?"
"No," Castiel said, but he said it gently.
I apologize for the unannounced hiatus. I haven't been having a great month, and mental health needs to come before fanfictioning. Updates might be irregular for a while, but I promise I am not giving up on this story. I will finish it come hell or high water. It just might take me a little longer than usual.
"Of course, baby," Castiel said again, tucking the blankets snugly around his son.
"Toast is fine," she said. "And I don't mind if it's a little burnt." She didn't want to put him to any extra trouble when he had already delayed his own breakfast to take care of Cas.
"That you let me take control like that. I guess I thought you'd be more …"
Cas was true to his word. Dean felt no pain, only a slightly uncomfortable stretch which he immediately forgot when Cas’s fingertip skated over his prostate. He moaned shamelessly, his head tipping back into the pillows and his back arching off the bed. He’d almost forgotten how good that could feel.
They were about halfway to Michael's, and holiday traffic was making the relatively short trip take three times longer than usual. The occasional snowflake drifting past the windshield had them both looking apprehensively at the dirty white sky. The last thing they needed was a storm blowing in while they were driving.
"A guy who really needs to get fucked right fucking
“She also used to starve me and lock me in the coat closet for days at a time. I’m claustrophobic because of that, and I have panic attacks and nightmares. I’m not telling you because I want pity. I’m telling you because you deserve to know exactly what you’re getting into with me.”
, his inner omega purred contentedly.
"You didn't expect it to be that easy, did you?" Cas said breathlessly when his tongue was free for talking again.
Those thoughts fled as Jack leapt into his arms, squealing, "Daddy! Daddy, it's snowing! Did you see, Daddy?" as though Castiel might have somehow missed it. There was no room in his heart for guilt or sadness when he was finally holding Jack and breathing in his son's sweet peaches and cream scent. The young alpha scented his father too, and pulled back with a puzzled frown. "You smell different."
They drank tea (well, Castiel did; Dean had beer) and ate crackers with hummus. At first they didn't talk, but the silence was comfortable, companionable. Finally Dean said, "So how long were you stuck in there?"
(See the end of the chapter for
gonna li—"
The three of them looked up. Castiel was expecting that a restaurant employee had come to tell them they were making too much of a disturbance although they weren't being particularly loud, and there were several other families with far more rambunctious children. But the middle-aged woman standing beside their table wore a smart, wool suit, not an apron. Castiel's eyes caught on the small silver cross around her neck before rising to take in the disgusted expression on her face, and all the happiness of the moment vanished, leaving only the dizzying sensation of the fight or flight adrenaline rush.
that was when Sam came back with the first aid kit.
"Jack," Castiel said as he was drying the little boy off and wrapping him in his dinosaur bathrobe, "you know how we've talked about you maybe coming to live at my house someday? Permanently, I mean, not just for a weekend?"
"You gave Cas a key?" Sam wasn't uncomfortable with the idea, just surprised. Clearly the relationship was out of the getting-to-know-each-other stage and moving deeper into long term commitment territory by the day. He hoped that was a good thing and not a sign that Dean was letting his impulsive nature get the better of him.
"Charlie —"
Dean's stomach did a back flip, but he put the bacon in his mouth anyway to buy some time. Grace, who had been watching its progress avidly, sighed.
He chose his words carefully, not wanting to make promises he wasn't sure he could keep. "I'm working on it, but I want to know… Are you sure you really want to? It would mean a lot of changes. You'll be farther away from all your friends." Castiel paused a moment to gather himself. "If you would rather stay here with Uncle Michael and Aunt Hannah, that would be okay. I just want you to be happy."
Dean braced his feet on the bed and let Castiel slide the pillow under his lower back. The smoky scent of his arousal mingled with Castiel's own thunderstorm scent like a warm, cozy fireplace on a wild and wet night.
"This is… incredibly hot," Castiel said hoarsely.
Warnings: Discussion of homophobia and a semi-graphic fight scene.
When they were forced to come up for air, they sat for a moment, their foreheads resting together, their breath warming each other's lips.
He made sure to look at Eileen when he began speaking. From the corner of his eye he saw Sam's hands moving, translating his words in case she missed anything.
Dean rested his chin on Cas’s shoulder, pressing their cheeks together. “How old were you when she …”
As white hot pleasure gradually receded into a warm, golden afterglow, Dean began gently licking the renewed claiming bite and lavishing it with kisses. Castiel melted, his whole being suffused with safety and happiness. This time there was no need to pretend. This time his dreams really had come true.
"Honey, this is what babysitters are for. We'll have to schedule ahead, so our scenes will be even less spontaneous than usual, and we'll probably have to cut back to once or twice a month until he's older, but I don't see any reason why we should have to give it up entirely."
When Bobby went to man the grill, Cas wandered into the Singers' book filled living room. (Dean hadn't been exaggerating about that. It was like a library minus the organizational system.) He could hear chatter and laughter coming from the kitchen, but Dean had gone out to buy more ice, and Cas couldn't quite find the courage to join in on his own. Besides, it sounded like the conversation was currently revolving around the upcoming wedding. He would have nothing to contribute and would feel distinctly out of place.
So now that I have appeased you with smut and pie, you forgive me for the long wait, yes? Good because you're probably in for another one. This story has not been and will not be abandoned, but I want to finish my other WIP, "Home For Christmas", first since that one was written for a gift exchange and is already a couple months late for the posting deadline. As soon as that's finished, I will be coming back to this. Pinky promise.
The whole world seemed to go still and quiet. “Oh,” Dean said. “Oh, Cas, I’m so sorry.”
When they had done their final cleanup and everyone was putting on their coats and wishing each other good night, Dean handed Castiel a piece of paper with a name and a phone number.
"Wh-why not now?" Dean asked, trying and failing to keep the whine out of his voice.
“Yep. You’re good to go.” He found the right key on the row of hooks behind the desk and handed it over, enjoying the brief brush of warm fingers against his. Hard, smooth callouses indicated that Mr. Novak worked with those hands. There was dirt under his nails too, and even in the dim, windowless office Dean could see that the man’s skin was beautifully tanned. Outdoor work then, in the hot sun, sweaty and possibly shirtless …
He pressed a soft kiss to Dean's slack mouth.
This wasn't just about helping Cas out anymore, and it definitely wasn't about indulging his selfish fantasies of claiming Cas as his mate. They had to get Jack out of this house and away from Michael's toxic influence before the 'proper' alpha broke the sweet, innocent boy the same way John Winchester had tried to break Dean.
Dean's inner alpha was suddenly going fucking nuts. Even more so than before.
"You're not back already, are you?" Castiel asked as she released him. "It's barely been three weeks."
Cas liked small houses. Not one-room-shack small, but small enough that you didn’t feel dwarfed by all the space. The house where he had grown up was enormous, which had probably made sense when there were twenty two Novaks plus hired help all living under one roof, but as the Novak children grew up and one by one moved on with their lives, the place had begun to feel less and less like a home and more and more like a mausoleum.
"She does have quite the bug up her ass about you and Dean," Gabe said, his deft hands never pausing in their work, the napkins almost seeming to dance into shape all by themselves while he hardly paid attention to what he was doing. "Personally I don't see why she objects. You're much more pleasant to work with when you're getting laid regularly."
"It's not the end of the world," Sam hurried to reassure him. "There's plenty of legal precedent for honoring handshake deals. Plus, you're the biological parent. The court is automatically leaning in your favor as long as Michael can't produce any evidence that you're unfit."
Castiel turned to face Dean, then looked left out of the corner of his eye. There was a scruffy man in a leather jacket standing by a rack of boots, but he wasn't paying Dean and Castiel any attention. "What makes you think he's following us?"
"You promise?"
“I feel like a teenager,” Cas chuckled. “Making out in my boyfriend’s bedroom.”
Dean made a sleepy sound of pleasure.
"I changed my mind."
Dean kissed him back for only a moment before pulling away, green eyes suddenly wide and fearful. "Wait, wait. What if… what if something happens to both of us? I mean, we're together a lot of the time. If there was a car accident or a fire at the restaurant, the odds that we'd both be there are—"
"You weren't winning anyway," laughed another voice, but the video game music in the background stopped.
"I want to have sex with you." Castiel realized how that might sound and quickly clarified, "Not right this minute. In a few days when we've both recovered. I want … I'd like to know what it feels like to do that purely for the pleasure of it."
“Here.” Dean put a paper cup in Cas’s hand. “Drink.”
"You're giving me a funny look."
He stood up so fast he bumped the table, making the dishes rattle, mumbled something about the bathroom and fled. He heard laughter behind him, but he didn't care. Let them think it was a silly male phobia of babies. He wished it was that simple.
Cas pushed himself up on his elbow and looked down at Dean. "I take it that was good for you too," he said, his voice still rough as sandpaper.
They managed to stop staring into each other's eyes long enough to look at the menu and place their orders. The waiter gave them a you're-too-adorable-for-words kind of look and made no comment.
The day after New Year's, Castiel was standing in his bedroom, trying to decide what to wear for his first date with Dean. A suit was too formal for where they were going, but should he do jeans or slacks? T-shirt or button down? It was a cold day. Would a sweater look too nerdy? He had a really nice long sleeved cashmere blend that hugged his shoulders and biceps flatteringly without being uncomfortably tight, and it was a soft gray-blue that he'd been told brought out his eyes. In fact that and a pair of dark wash jeans was his go to first date outfit, and he'd taken it out of his closet twenty minutes ago before he started second guessing himself.
"That will be Missouri," Castiel sighed, loath to leave Dean's arms and get ready for work.
He sat on the lid of the toilet, staring at the blue and white pattern of the floor tiles and counting how many times it repeated. It was easier this time to calm his breathing, easier to keep the shame and self-doubt at bay. All he had to do was focus on the anger boiling up in his gut, the same righteous anger he'd felt last year when he had noticed finger shaped bruises on the neck of a little girl in his class.
"Excuse me," Castiel said, snatching the plate from Naomi and inspecting it critically. "There's nothing wrong with this. It's precisely comme il faut."
"Shut up," Dean groaned, but he was shaking with laughter, and it made his cock move just right inside Castiel.
"I think we should give you two a minute to figure this out in private," Eileen said after a moment of horribly awkward silence, and she practically dragged Sam out of his own office, the door clicking closed behind them. Dean
"Cas," Dean whined as he thought of sucking that cock, the same one currently pushing relentlessly into his prostate. It would be coated in Cas' slick too. He loved the taste of Cas' sli— "Ahhhh. Uh, uh, unguhhh." His vision whited out as his orgasm overtook him, and for a few seconds he was only aware of spine melting, toe curling pleasure radiating out from his cock and his prostate to every inch of his body.
"Sometimes when I talk about the wedding, you get this weird look on your face. You look sad or … or scared. What's that about?"
"Yes," Dean and Castiel said in unison.
"I'll show you the website," Dean laughed. "You can pick out which ones you think would look good on me."
Their waitress reappeared with much better timing than before. "Hey, guys. How's everything?"
Castiel often wished that there was a recipe for life with step by step instructions telling you exactly what to do to achieve the desired results. In the kitchen he was master, his every move confident and assured. Out in the real world it was a different story.
"Daaaad!"
“It’s nothing. It’s stupid.”
"Mmm. So perfect, Dean. So beautiful." With his other hand Cas opened his jeans and pulled his fully erect cock out of his boxers to rut against the silk covered swell of Dean's ass. The first thrust made him gasp and convulsively bite Dean's neck.
"So, Sam," Castiel said in his most innocent tone, "do you have any embarrassing stories from Dean's childhood you'd like to share?"
Dean wasn't normally one to make comparisons while he was in bed with someone. He might rank the experience later, but in the moment he preferred to just enjoy it for what it was. Still, he couldn't help thinking that he had never been kissed like this before. Cas seemed to be trying to climb inside him and breathe the air directly out of his lungs. With what little presence of mind he had left, he fumbled with the fly of Cas's jeans and was inordinately proud of himself when he managed to get it open while still being kissed senseless.
"Well, she'll probably be placed in a temporary foster home until you can make arrangements."
object to me sleeping with Dean?"
Dean turned to Hannah. "You have a beautiful home. Thanks for inviting me."
man's presence. Dean's hands and mouth on every inch of him, claiming him and worshiping him, making him feel good and right and not alone.
Suddenly he felt teeth on his neck, right over his scent gland. It wasn't quite hard enough to break skin, but it was more than a playful nip. Castiel went still, or at least as still as was possible with a rut crazed alpha fucking him wild. Would Dean stop if Castiel asked him to, or was he too far gone, in the grip of ancient instincts that predated civilized concepts like consent?
"What about this one?"
"He can have more children.
"Not necessarily."
The deputy agreed and sounded glad that Castiel was taking such an immediate interest in his niece's wellbeing. Castiel thanked him by rote and hung up the phone. Then he just stood there, staring at his blurred reflection in a gleaming copper stockpot.
"The third one," Castiel said, part question, part warning.
"God, I will never get over how gorgeous you are," Castiel breathed. "You're the most beautiful man I've ever seen. I can't believe I'm lucky enough to … Are you blushing?"
"Don't worry about it." Dean slid his hand down Cas's side, ghosting lightly over his bruised ribs before settling on his hip. "You managed to seduce me pretty thoroughly even while unconscious. You're just that good."
Cas decided that it was time for a change of subject. “So you’re a mechanic.”
But this one is mostly fluff and smut.
"You're sure?" Cas stroked his cheek. "You don't have to do it just for me. I have never had any complaints about our sex life. I don't need the kinky stuff to make it exciting. Every time with you is the best sex I ever had no matter what we do."
"Was it a religious issue," Dean asked, "or just his own personal feelings?"
"She's probably told Michael by now," Cas said, looking at the door like it led to the gallows. He looked at Dean again, and there was panic in his eyes, the panic of a cornered animal. "Will you come with me? I don't… I don't think I can face them alone."
Dean took a deep breath and got his scent under control before he knocked on the door of Cas's room. A gravelly voice called out, "Come in."
"Hmmm. Thought we weren't supposed to get distracted," Dean said even as he kissed back.
"What did you teach her?" Cas asked.
"I don't think that's necessary," Naomi started to say, but Castiel spoke over her.
Gabe was going past with a tray of food at that moment, and he stopped so fast that only many years of experience saved him from spilling something. "Wait," he said in tones of confusion. "That's not a secret anymore?"
"Very nice," Max agreed. "Would you guys want to exchange numbers, get together some time? Trade gay parenting tips?" He laughed a little as he said it, but it was still clearly a serious offer.
"They can be a little overwhelming the first time," she said, nodding towards the kitchen where it sounded like every member of the extended Singer-Winchester-Bradbury clan was talking at once.
"I always want," Dean said, and Castiel's heart twisted painfully. Of course this was just sex for Dean. Castiel was just the most convenient option.
"Cas," Dean whispered, reaching out to cup his cheek.
"There are other good schools. I'm… I don't know what more Michael wants from me. I have a house. I have a job. I have health insurance and a decent savings account. I have…"
liked her. If Sam wasn't dating her, then he should be.
Usually Cas would have let it go at that, but now he put his hands on Dean's hips (fuck, that silk gliding under his palms, shaping itself so perfectly to the strong, masculine body beneath; it was the most decadent pleasure ever) and turned him to face the full length mirror on the back of the bedroom door. "You think? Look at that. That sexy man is
Again Dean just nodded like an idiot. Five years he'd been dreaming of saying the words out loud, and now he couldn't remember how talking worked. Fortunately for him, Cas had better uses for Dean's mouth.
"Night."
Castiel shot out of his seat, pushing past the woman so forcefully that she stumbled into another table. He crouched down to pull Claire into his arms, and she clambered out of her chair to wrap herself around him like an octopus, clinging on tightly. He tried to murmur soothing words to her, "It's okay, honey. You're safe. No one is going to take you away. I promise," but his words were mostly drowned out by her sobs. She hadn't made this much noise in months, and it was terrifying him.
a child. He was ancient and powerful. He had seen the creation of the universe. He had commanded armies in battle. How frustrating and humiliating must it be for him to suddenly be so lost and helpless. Maybe what he really needed right now wasn't protection but control.
Dean was rutting mindlessly against Castiel's hip as well, so Castiel took them both in hand, stroking them together with quick, deft movements until their orgasms hit them almost simultaneously.
best interest and everything to do with what's in theirs…"
~o0o~
Castiel shrugged. "Among other things. It
"It's not that I don't trust you. I do," Castiel hurried to reassure him. "I just—"
They stirred themselves enough to clean up, then snuggled up under the blankets and kissed lazily for a while, hands exploring each other's bodies, learning every sharp, masculine line and finding the soft, sensitive places that even the toughest man had. They were in no hurry to get to round two (or four if you were counting from last night). This quiet in between time was just as intimate and just as enjoyable.
"What about it? Does it hurt?" Could it be infected? Dean had been very careful not to break the skin since that would turn it from a claiming bite into a mating bite.
my Christmas present, I do think it should be properly wrapped." He flicked his gaze pointedly down to Dean's cock. "May I?"
Castiel blinked at Dean in mild surprise again. "You did?"
Dean gave a bark of laughter. "I am far from selfless."
Dean startled and looked up, a blush tingeing his freckled cheeks. He opened his mouth, closed it again, and then wordlessly held out the tie.
Dean gritted his teeth. "Yes, Dad. He's an omega."
be unhappy, or he'll say no but he'll feel bad for saying no. Either way, I'm not putting him in that position."
“Not really,” Gabriel said, “but none of us hate each other quite as much as Mike and Nick do. Believe it or not, they used to be best friends. They had a falling out not long after our mother died, and now they’re like those divorced couples who can’t be in the same room for more than five minutes without going nuclear.”
Castiel chuckled and tilted his head to nip at Dean's jaw, stubble tickling the tip of his tongue. "Yeah, you do. You love that I'm a man, and I know exactly what to do with a cock when I've got one in my hand." He thumbed over both their slits, smearing the pre-come from one to the other.
She nodded.
Cas lifted his head and met Sam's eyes. "I should be thanking
Dean came out of the bathroom and immediately caught the sour note of unhappiness in Castiel's scent. "Hey. What's wrong?" he said, his own scent flooding with
*dives for cover again*
The waiter came back with their food at that moment, and they both hastily plastered on polite smiles and thanked her, but once she was gone, they ignored the tantalizing smells rising from the dishes.
"I …" It would be simpler to just say yes, but it wouldn't be honest, so he did his best to explain. "I don't know. This is another way that real life is different from Disney. Sometimes you need to spend a lot of time with someone so you can figure out if you're in love with them or not. Right now I just know that I like him. He's kind and funny and …"
the sun.
"Okay. All set. He says we can come by his office tomorrow around noon, and he's giving you the friends and family discount which is Sammy-speak for pro bono."
Dean walked back around the bed and laid down behind Cas, pressing up against him so that Cas was sandwiched between Dean and Grace. “I don’t scare that easy,” he said.
From her place on the floor, Claire tugged on Dean's pant leg, then pointed insistently at the game board.
"Yeah. He was actually the first person I ever came out to, and he's always been really supportive. I don't think I could have handled all the shit if I hadn't had Sammy on my side. Especially my dad's reaction. He hit the roof, tried to kick me out, but Sam said that if I had to leave, then he was going with me, and Dad could either take both of us as we were or lose us both."
"Is that so?" Castiel chuckled. His eyes flickered down to the strip of exposed skin where Dean's shirt had ridden up. His freckled belly was definitely a little more prominent than usual, and Castiel longed to push his face into that softness, kiss over the warm flesh and revel in the fact that
"Cas?" Dean suddenly cut her off, and this time he didn't bother to hide his worry. "Cas, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."
"Yeah, yeah," Dean said gruffly. "Don't go all fangirl on me now, or I might change my mind about letting you move in." But he quite obviously didn't mean it. He couldn't keep the goofy grin off his face.
Cas thought, but he kept the thought to himself for now.
He tore his eyes away from the play of muscles in Dean's back as the man pulled a shirt over his head and forced himself to pay attention to his own clothes before he put his pants on inside out again. "You have the directions to Claire's school, right?"
Dean shrugged one shoulder, the movement making him look even more like a big cat. "I just love you."
"A few years. I started when I was eighteen."
bleed first. But savage displays of possessiveness wouldn't heal Cas's wounds. Cas didn't need an alpha right now. He needed Dean.
a sin? Did you allow
, Cas. My baby is not an it.
Cas looked up when Dean put a plate with a turkey sandwich in front of him. He blinked, coming back from wherever he had gone in his head, and said softly, "Thank you, Dean."
"Sam?" He held out his hand, palm up, and Sam put a small box in it, wrapped in the same silver paper he had used for Dean's gift card. Dean passed it to John who wordlessly put it in the pocket of his bathrobe. He would either open it later or throw it away depending on his mood. One year they had tried pretending that both gifts were from Dean, but John had known the truth and had spitefully thrown them both away right in front of his sons. Dean hoped Sam hadn't spent too much on the bastard, but knowing Sam, it was probably solid silver cuff links or something.
He wasn't sure how long he stood there with the crisp, pale blue button down getting wrinkled as he crushed it to his nose. He breathed in deeply, seeking out every trace of that fresh rain and green leaf scent. Gradually his heart rate slowed, the invisible weight on his chest eased up, and the buzzing in his head receded. He took a few more deep sniffs of the shirt, then, feeling suddenly ashamed of himself, shook it out and hung it back up, doing his best to smooth out the wrinkles. He prayed that Cas wouldn't notice.
"Because she doesn't talk. Not at the moment anyway."
"You didn't hurt me, Dean. I promise you this. It never made me jealous when I thought you were sleeping with Benny. You came home calm and happy, and that was all that mattered to me."
to come. His vision whited out as he finally allowed himself the blessed relief of spilling inside Dean.
"Happy Valentine's Day, baby," Dean said when he remembered how to speak.
"Wow," Castiel said in a voice as dry as desert sands. "You're quick. What gave it away?"
~o0o~
"Good," Cas sighed, already half asleep. "Good alpha. Feel so much better."
Sam lit up. "Yeah. Sounds great."
"And at work I have to be professional, and at home I have to keep it together for Claire's sake, and by the time I have a minute to myself I'm too tired to do anything but sleep. I'm just so tired all the time." The words poured out just like the tears, raw and uncontrollable.
Dean chuckled at the absolute Cas-ness of the statement. He could practically hear the angel's puzzled little frown. "It's not literal, Cas. It's in your head. You imagine a whole lot of sheep, and you start counting them, and then … I don't know. I guess you fall asleep from sheer boredom. That's never worked for me."
Claire's eyes went wide, and she pointed to the woman in white.
Castiel thought about how much it would hurt to see Dean, watch him play with Claire and make her laugh, but know that Dean wasn't his anymore. Then he thought about telling Claire that Dean was gone and never coming back. "Yes. If we had to. But I really don't want to have to."
Dean beamed.
He paused, considering the best way to phrase this so it couldn't be misunderstood. Finally he said, "I can be more dominant if that's something you like. I draw the line at actually hurting you, but short of that I'll do anything that makes you feel good, and I will never judge you or lose respect for you because of your sexual preferences. But you should know that for myself I don't find power games at all arousing. At work I may be your superior, but everywhere else we are equals, and especially in this bed. I have absolutely no desire to dominate you. I just want to be allowed to touch you. And I don't want you to call me sir. I just want to hear you say my name."
Castiel took it. He knew Dean often had trouble asking for what he wanted, especially when it was the exact opposite of what he'd been taught an alpha was supposed to want, so Castiel didn't insist on a formal request, merely asked, "What is your safe word?"
“She stabbed you.”
Dean nods, swallowing, “See you, Cas.”
By the look on Cas’s face, he definitely caught what Dean slipped out, his mouth slightly open when it catches him off guard.
They pull up to the street, and Dean recognizes instantly where they are, when he hops out of the truck. There isn’t anything to recognize really, it’s the building he lives in.
It’s half past ten, when Dean parks the impala at the front yard. He turns the key in the lock and opens the front door as quietly as he can, in case Jack is already sleeping. He’s probably not, the way he was fighting with Cas when Dean left, but he’s hopeful anyway.
He quickly matches his face with Dean’s, “Now nothing”, he grunts, “Keep those clothes separate from the laundry basket, I don’t want oil on our clothes”, he lectures, before promptly walking back up, leaving Dean downstairs.
are.” He opens the fridge to grab something to eat, “He threw a toy car at me this morning, because he got mad about the clothes, that
“When?” she asks softly.
Cas is sure Dean’s not capable of having feelings in general. The man is all casual hookups and flashing easy smiles, thinking only about himself and what he wants.
Dean just shakes his head a bit, chuckling again, “Nothing.” He opens his eyes, “Just keep kissing me.”
“Coffee, yeah, yeah I know”, Dean rolls his eyes and nods towards the coffee maker that luckily isn’t completely empty, “Take some while I’ll fix us some eggs.”
“Did you have fun with Cas?” Dean asks quietly.
He’s sounding nonchalant. He is.
Dean clears his throat and fills the silence from Cas’s side of the conversation now that he’s on a roll, “It wasn’t until later that I finally realized that for sure, but yeah.”
“I don’t wanna talk about it.”
There’s something about Benny that seems to sour Cas’s mood for the rest of the evening. Ever since he arrived, Benny and Dean have been geeking out over the grill together, smiling and standing close to each other, like they’re in their own little bubble and the rest of the crowd doesn’t exist anymore.
But thinking that he could just sleep with Cas and be okay with it the morning after takes the cake by far, because never in his life has he been
“What happened?” Dean asks softly, turning his body more towards Cas as he does, speaking on instinct more than on actual thinking.
This kid literally rules their household back at the apartment, but now when he looks up at Dean, he looks like he wants to climb up to his lap and never let go.
He grabs the kid and follows Sam to the kitchen.
It takes Dean a bit longer to arrive back home than anticipated, which Jack starts to get anxious over, because making a deal about being home in time to put him to bed is as serious as making a blood oath. Cas makes the mistake of telling Jack it’s bedtime soon, bringing on an emotional storm about why
hope you've enjoyed so far! leave a comment or come say hi on
“No, it’s not that, the room’s fine”, Dean answers, confused by the question, “but we–”
“I’m sure Dean takes them off whenever he showers as well.” Cas pats the edge of the sink. “We’ll put it here, and you’ll get it back the second we’re done.”
That gets a laugh out of Dean, “Trust me, he has the devil in him when he’s in the mood for it.”
say anything?”
All of Dean’s friends are working on Friday, or have other plans already, so he was going to stay at home anyway. But now that Cas is going out, it somehow pisses him off that he can’t, if there’s an opportunity coming up.
or leave a comment <3 your feedback always makes my day, i cherish each and every one!!
The amount of stories Dean’s heard even if he’s met these women three times is crazy.
“It’s my birthday!” Jack exclaims, beaming at the both of them, and they try their best to smile through the tiredness. Cas notices Dean scooting over to the other side of the bed, and he takes that as a permission to sit on the edge of the bed instead of awkwardly standing there.
“You left it in the car?”
Dean takes the plate with the two pieces of bread ready, and hands it over before he can stop himself. “Here.”
“Do you want to make the pharmacy run?” Cas asks while he fastens his own seat belt. He turns to look at Dean when the man doesn’t start the engine. “Dean?”
“Jack!” Cas calls down the hallway, “Come here for a moment!”
Sam gives them a moment, before he starts the teasing, “We didn’t need to call 911, thank you very much.”
“I don’t understand toys with removable parts”, he says to Dean when the kid has left, “I get that it gives variability to the toy, but it’s pointless if the removal always requires an adult.”
pasta sauce Jack actually likes – even if one would think that they all taste the same – and Cas is supposed to buy that, but he has no memory of which one it is.
Dean’s fear must be painted all over his face, because suddenly there’s a warm hand holding his, and he turns his attention to the gentle look on Cas’s face.
Cas refuses to look at Kelly’s parents, and when the doctor guides Mr. and Mrs. Kline to sit down on the bench next to the wall, sympathetic but professional, Cas snaps himself into action, leaving before she tries to confront him as well.
Dean turns to Bobby for support, but his uncle just chuckles at their helpless expressions.
“Everything’s fine, I just—” he starts, “Would you mind if I stayed over? I know it’s your turn to be with Jack, and I do have to get some work done tomorrow, but I planned to do it from home anyway.”
“Aren’t you one beautiful thing”, she continues, gesturing at Dean.
Seriously, they should’ve just hooked up last night, they were both up for it, it would’ve been casual and fun, but no, Dean has to be so stupidly in love with the man he couldn’t do it, because he wants it to be right.
“My—"
“I’m not”, Dean rolls his eyes, folding the fabric in half, “I’m just curious. You never go on dates.”
Lisa glances briefly behind her, at Cas’s direction, before smiling to herself, eyes down at her feet. “Figured”, she chuckles like she’s not surprised at all, shaking her head a bit. “The girls wouldn’t leave me alone if I didn’t at least ask.”
Sam suggests they should get a picture, and Dean tries to get Jack to stand still in front of the cake table. Sam has a different idea.
she instructs. Her ability to read Dean reaches through the phone too, apparently:
Jack’s lack of sleep makes him cranky for the whole day, and nothing Dean does seems to please him. Dean packs them lunch and takes the kid to the park, hoping that fresh air would lighten up their mood.
It’s just that he usually gives some, but now he just walks out of his bedroom and leaves the house in his running gear without even glancing at Dean’s direction.
There was a time when Dean met his friends mostly late at night, in a crowded bar or at someone’s house with a beer in his hands.
“I think—” he starts, “that we could order some pizza now and eat the sauce tomorrow, if you want.”
“Let’s just play the game”, Dean grunts, turning towards the screen to put an end to the conversation. Charlie stares at him for a beat before sighing and pressing play.
“I have faith in me and Jack, I say we make it out of there in four.”
Sam lifts his brows at his brother, “Do you realize your bedroom is
“Awesome job”, he praises and holds a hand out for Jack, and the kid actually slaps his tiny hand against Dean’s, just like he’s taught him.
“How do you know?”
“What?” Dean frowns and opens a jar of peanut butter.
Like Jody said: it’s not bad parenting, it’s treating yourself for a change.
“How would you know that?” Cas tilts his head, looking slightly amused, “Maybe I’m not as vocal about it as you are.”
“No, he doesn’t”, Cas argues and frowns when Meg’s face lights up with victory.
above the kitchen?” he points a finger towards the ceiling to make a point of it, “Maybe don’t have sex if you know we are all in the kitchen.”
Dean likes his new station a lot. He’s been working there only for a couple of months, but he’s already making friends with his coworkers, there has been enough action to keep them going, but nothing that they couldn’t handle, and at the end of the day, no one has died, so it has been great.
Somehow, it’s quite hot, actually.
the bitchface without even looking at his brother, “Payback’s coming on lunchtime, I have some of
Cas shifts closer, and Dean holds his breath as the man hooks his foot around his ankle. He should wake them up. Cas presses his nose against Dean’s shoulder, and he can feel the warm huffs of breath through the fabric.
Cas gives him a sarcastic smile, pretending to understand, “Oh good, because actually talking to me would’ve been highly uncharacteristic for you.”
The door of the room that Jack’s in opens, and Dean turns around to see Cas stepping out.
“It’s complicated”, he states, “My life right now. It’s—complicated”, he finishes lamely, but fortunately Mick seems to be content with that answer. “But I
Dean points a knowing finger at the man glaring at him, “You wouldn't say
“Yeah”, Dean nods, “The food’s great.”
“It’s cool, but good thing we ran into each other now”, she smiles, “Are you free this Friday? We could go out.”
“What the
“It’s only for about an hour”, Dean says on the phone, “He knows you the best out of everyone, and he’s probably sleeping anyway. Kid’s a chick magnet, so you should invite Eileen.”
“Thank you for your help”, the man says and Dean gives him space to pay for the wash.
There’s a toddler running into his arms the second Dean steps into the apartment. He grabs Jack mid run and holds him high above his head, before letting him drop for a second only to grab him and hold him close, as the toddler giggles from the adrenaline rush.
“Don’t give him any ideas”, Kelly smirks, speaking under her breath like she’s afraid the baby will hear her. She hooks her arm on Dean’s, guiding him across the yard and towards the back door, instead of the barbeque he was waiting for. “I have something important to talk to you about.”
“Of course, wouldn’t miss it”, he says as he holds her close. He glances at her baby bump when they let go of each other. Her stomach looks bigger than before, even if they saw each other just a few days ago, “Sure he’s not gonna suddenly join the party?”
doing?” Dean counters, pushing himself off the door frame he’s leaning against, “I thought we agreed not to meet with some random hookups at the house.”
It sets something free in Dean, but not in a good way.
Cas nods, “At first she made it seem unintentional, but after a while she dropped her overnight bag at my place before heading out.” He remembers rolling his eyes at her every time she did, but he was really happy to know she had a place to crash safely, since Cas lived closer to the city at the time. “She was always so hungover when she woke up, but still had this happy look on her face.”
“Okay”, Benny says, and Dean can’t really read the look on his face.
The whole week has been a pain in the ass, and this Friday seems to be the cherry on top.
Sam’s cheerful voice asks,
Mick offers to drive him home, and after trying to insist on taking a cab to be polite, Cas agrees, and they get into the car.
Cas frowns his confused frown.
Cas tells himself he’s not disappointed. He’s glad Dean snapped him out of it, before he did something stupid in his half asleep state.
Jack gets more medication in his system to get the fever down, and a prescription for antibiotics for the otitis, and they’re free to leave. The kid gladly climbs into Cas’s arms when he steps closer to pick him up from the bed while the doctor gives them more instructions.
“You’re the one who just gave me the ‘this was fun’ talk”, Dean shoots back as he starts to search for his clothes from the floor, the familiar tone of a fight starting in his words.
The only answer he gets is the silence around him.
“I’m very happy about that”, Cas says, smile in his tone.
Jo doesn’t seem to notice anything weird in the way his voice falters a bit, and just points at the other two ladies sitting at the table. “The other blondie is Donna, the one on the other side of the table is Jody”, she names, as the two smile at them when they notice them looking, “They’re intrigued by you and I got sick of it.”
Cas tries to lure him out as well, but Jack does what he always does if he’s angry but doesn’t bother to argue: he ignores them.
Dean smiles at the memory of that horrible, ugly golden continental Castiel used to drive.
Dean awkwardly waits for him to go through whatever it is he’s thinking.
Cas says the thing Dean’s wanted to say since they started this review in turns, his wide, drunken smile turning into almost a shy one.
Cas laughs softly at the memory Dean shared, and the man turns to look at Cas.
”, Dean repeats, and points a finger at Sam, “Just because you need
“You catching a cold, or something?” Benny asks, when Dean rubs his itchy nose again, sniffing.
The walk from the kitchen to the bedroom is messy and it takes time, because they can’t stop making out like a couple of horny teenagers. When Cas almost pushes him against the hallway wall the second time, Dean takes his own head out of the horny cloud long enough to grab Cas by the arms, promptly pulling him towards the room they’re headed to.
thinking about how
Dean opens it and reads through the colorful cardboard inside. “You know, you can also just text people to invite them over to get drunk and give you presents?”
“What?” Dean says defensively, “I’m tired.”
Cas rubs a tired hand over his face, “Are you seriously judging my skills in the kitchen?”
Cas pushes down any further arguments when he hears Jack running back to the living room already.
“Yeah”, Dean agrees, “And when you love someone you don’t mind sharing your room with them”, he adds, giving Cas’s hand a squeeze.
He doesn’t realize his eyes are glued to the exposed skin, soft stomach and the waistband of Dean’s boxers, visible from his jeans, until he’s feeling hot too, and it doesn’t feel like it’s the temperature of the garage that’s burning inside him.
“I’m Dean.”
“It’s that
Cas laughs aloud and turns to his stomach. He struggles with it a bit with all the alcohol still in his system but manages to turn anyway. “Am I banned now too? From pie baking”, he clarifies when Dean’s brain doesn’t follow.
He walks downstairs and to the living room, tiredly thinking about the uncooked steak and the pie recipe he found a week ago and wanted to make for Cas, who’s not even home yet. Cas, who currently works a god-knows-how-many-hours long shift, who he wanted to surprise tonight with a good meal and some pie.
Cas had seen the list of ideas Jack had come up with, and it had been interesting and surprisingly detailed.
Dean really needs to stop staring, but Cas
Cas browses through his emails on his phone, awkwardly trying to ignore the way Meg takes her time to flirt with the waitress. He looks up when she leaves, seeing Meg shamelessly stare after her when she walks away with their order.
for that?”
Dean pushes himself to sit, bringing his hands to Cas’s belt buckle, hastily working it open, which fortunately is much easier to work with, “Cas, take the shirt off, and I’ll show you motor skills, alright?”
The game freezes on the screen as Charlie instantly hits pause, “You
“It’s, you know, easier to moan when you’re drunk and not sure who you’re sleeping with”, Dean grins, adding an exaggerated wink that’s sure to earn a proper eye roll from Cas, and to hide the fact that he would definitely use pet names for real,
Dean chuckles, “Well, thanks for the invitation”, he says, carefully putting the cardboard back into the envelope, “I have to check Cas’s schedule, if he could be with Jack.”
The man watches Dean’s movements with such intensity Dean can feel his gaze on him as he asks which program the man wanted.
The way Cas looks at him, his expression somehow neutral but still filled with so much emotion from maybe sadness to insecurity, Dean wants to reach over and wrap his arms around the man.
“Delicious”, he grits through his teeth, and Cas chuckles softly.
“Are you not?” he asks with a knowing look and Dean has to give in, shoulder slumping as he lets out a sigh.
“What up, dads?” she greets them with a beer in her hand. She’s wearing a costume that looks so not hers, the way she’s tugging at the hem constantly, it’s clear it’s from Charlie’s closet.
Eventually though, after a long battle of evening routines of brushing teeth, changing into pajamas and choosing the bedtime story, and countless toilet breaks during it, the kids are asleep, and Dean closes the bedroom door behind him as quietly as he can.
Eileen, who is cutting some vegetables, places down the knife and gives a warm smile to the two of them. She has thick brown hair up in a ponytail and she’s wearing Sam’s hoodie based on how big it is on her. Dean thinks she’s cute, and probably way too good for his nerdy brother.
Dean is using all his willpower to not grab the glass of orange juice on the tray and pour it on Cas’s head.
“You must be Charlie”, he says, trying to look serious and scary.
Someone appears on the kitchen door, asking quickly for Kelly, and she leaves the two alone.
“There’s at least two hundreds of them”, Jack tells the others.
“He didn’t”, Charlie says, tone firm, “He’s gonna be fine. He’ll have a hell of a headache, but as he himself said, the headache of you worrying will be worse.”
Cas leans towards Meg to whisper something to her and Dean can’t look away. Whatever Cas says makes Meg laugh. Cas is funny as hell, so it’s no surprise she’s laughing, but it’s making the jealousy louder in Dean’s head, because she’s yet another reminder to Dean that there’s a whole side of Cas’s life he’s not a part of no matter how badly he would want to be.
Cas is already on the couch, channel surfing while he waits for Dean. Dean crosses the room, and without thinking about it, joins Cas on the couch, because he hates watching a movie from a chair. It always gets uncomfortable, and his back is not made for it.
“What was that?” Sam asks suspiciously, eyeing the door and his brother, "If I didn't know better I'd say you two are starting to get along."
Surprisingly enough, Jack obeys right away, and Cas turns his attention back to the sauce cans on the shelf. There’s exactly
The others are laughing, and that’s the last straw, if they’re having fake fights in this fake relationship, he’s not going to be the one to fake lose them.
The back door of the garage makes a loud sound as Cas pushes it open. The three of them turn to look, when he crosses the yard.
“Can you sing the song?” Jack asks Dean.
“You do realize I have to leave for work at eight, right?” he asks for the hundredth time that evening.
The man hums an absentminded answer, and walks over, sitting down on the armchair next to the couch, a thoughtful expression on his face.
Cas is almost pulling him in for a kiss but stops mid movement when he notices Dean grinning.
“It’s like this every year”, Jo tells Charlie, Eileen and Cas, who follow the ongoing decoration from the couch. “I don’t understand why we let him be part of this process at all.”
Dean laughs and pushes the cart further down the aisle, “Okay, sweetheart, let’s get you that fish.”
Dean looks down at the hand, his gaze following along his arm and eventually to his eyes. Cas is smiling a little.
Cas thinks it’s probably Dean who forgot his keys or something, so he’s surprised when he opens the door to Mick, who’s holding a paper bag in his hands.
The woman takes it as the joke Dean intended it to be, chuckling a bit, “I remember when me and my husband were as young as you two”, she muses, “Oh, he drove me crazy.”
Dean can feel his dick twitching against the fabric of his boxers when Cas tells him to lift his hips. He obeys, and the man on the floor pulls both his jeans and boxers down in one go. He gasps quietly when he feels a hand grabbing him, stroking him slowly, and he braces himself on his elbow just in time to see Cas tear the condom open with his teeth, spitting the piece of plastic to the floor.
He can’t stop touching the man, running a hand up and down his arm to assure himself he’s really awake.
Jack instantly curls up against his side when they get to bed. Cas looks down at him, how fragile and tiny the curled-up kid looks, and how not like himself at all, the energy drained out of him.
“I know”, Cas says, almost too quiet for him to hear even though the man is standing right in front of him, “I know how you feel.”
“Cas”, Dean tries to whisper, attempting to wake him up without waking up the kid, but the man doesn’t react at all. He shakes the ankle Cas has his foot wrapped around,
She takes a deep breath in, before she starts, “You know how you two are my best friends, and I love you more than anything—”
They are out of breath again when they part, just like after the fight.
“Now, you two”, Sam says pointedly to get the other two men’s attention from wherever they’re trying to glance after Jack, “You don’t have to worry about him. Go have fun.”
Dean points at the kid on the floor, “Week ago, this one threw his spaghetti at me right before I left, and then I spent two days wondering how he’s doing, only to get more food thrown at me when I came back.”
Dean checks the time from his watch, but it’s not even midnight. He finds himself chuckling about the fact that the date probably wasn’t a good one, if Cas is home already. He doesn’t really get why it makes him this happy, but it beats being pissed off at staying at home all evening.
"I didn't actually."
"How do you take your coffee?" Hannah asked, breaking into his thoughts. Her voice was steady and her scent even again.
"No, we're good," Dean said, and he put his arm around Castiel as though to prove it.
The song mentioned is by Jethro Tull.
They cuddled in comfortable silence for a while, and Dean gave in to his inner alpha's desire to lick Cas "clean". They would need a shower to actually get clean and to wash off the smell of sex. Sam complained that they always smelled like sex these days (but there was a twinkle in his eyes when he said it, so Dean knew he was happy for them).
"Did you leave him alone with Claire?" Castiel cut her off, his voice very steady and very cold.
Castiel laughed. This was without a doubt the best Christmas present he'd ever had.
"Then I met another girl. Ruby. She was the complete opposite of Jess, and calling it a romantic relationship would be way too generous. She was a dealer, and she liked me enough to let me pay with sex instead of money. I was running out of money by then. After a while she started using me for other things too. I would, um … encourage people to pay their debts. I didn't enjoy it. I had to get high to do it, and even then it made me sick, but it was that or Ruby would cut me off, and I was an addict. Getting cut off from my supply was the worst thing I could imagine.
"Yeah?" The bunker suddenly felt much warmer than usual. "And how were you gonna do that, omega?"
"Between fifteen and twenty depending on the year. This year I have eighteen."
"Hey. It's not going to." Dean was out of his seat in an instant and kneeling in front of Cas, squeezing his hands, looking intently into his eyes and willing him to believe. "Haven't you figured it out yet, baby? I'm in this for the long haul. I am never gonna get bored of you. You're … You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and … Shit. I'm doing this all wrong. I meant to wait until after dinner, and I had this whole speech planned, but hey, spontaneous has always kind of been our thing."
Dean grinned triumphantly and massaged his prostate until Castiel's flagging erection was standing proud again and drooling pre-come on Dean's thigh. Castiel gave in to the urge to rut against the warm skin.
It took Castiel a moment to remember what the first thing on the list had been. "Oh. Yes. Monogamy." He sat up and retrieved the pad from between the sofa cushions. "Is that something you want? Something you need? Please be completely honest. No more telling me what you think I want to hear."
. It was just like Christmas only better because Dean had his arm around Castiel, and Castiel was allowed to rest his head on Dean's shoulder. He could hardly believe things had changed so much in only a month.
"I don't want to talk about it," Cas cut him off gently but firmly. "Not yet. As Dean said, it's complicated."
Dean wasn't sure exactly when his own orgasm had hit. The sex had been so intense from start to finish that his climax barely registered in comparison. He rolled off Cas, trembling from head to toe, and stared up at the unfamiliar ceiling.
Dean's smile put the sun, moon, and stars combined to shame.
Dean pulled back and looked at him, his gaze scorching hot and hungry. Castiel wanted to start begging right then, but he kept his cool, at least on the outside. "Lube?" Dean said.
She was looking rather pointedly at Castiel as she said that last part. He, equally pointedly, put his hand over Dean's on the table in plain view and lightly caressed Dean's knuckles with his thumb. The quality of their work hadn't suffered in the slightest since their relationship changed. She couldn't use that as an excuse to come between them whatever her personal opinions about workplace romance.
"We don't have to use them if you don't want to," Castiel said, setting the box in front of her but leaving it closed. "But I thought you might like to see them up there with everything else. Make it feel more like home. It's up to you."
The same affectionate smile Dean has on his face spreads on Cas’s, when he spots the kid in the vehicle. Looking at Cas smiling lifts Dean’s mood almost as much as Jack’s joy.
Dean wipes his stained hands to his jeans, “Why, you saying I need more beauty sleep?”
He presses a soft kiss to Jack’s hair. He’s about to step away from the picture, but then Jack opens his mouth again. His voice is hesitant, like he’s testing the words in his mouth when he whispers them in the quiet kitchen, resting his head back against Dean’s shoulder:
The next time they met at the laundromat, Castiel made a comment about knowing now to choose another machine, thanks to Dean.
Cas is out of work for the weekend, but he’s behind on some deadlines. Fortunately, Jack takes a longer nap than he usually does, so he’s able to finish some of it while he sleeps.
“This is a library”, he states to Jack who looks around curiously, “We can borrow books to read at home.”
So he has to choose better.
“Can I ask you something?” he asks, when he digs into his meal.
Dean was as much responsible about it as he was, so he doesn’t understand why he would get that pissed off about it.
“Where is he?” Cas looks around the room, trying to spot the taller Winchester.
“Fine”, he mutters, and Dean drops his gaze from him.
“Yeah”, Dean answers, like it’s the easiest question in the world. Which is kinda terrifying considering the next part that slips out of his mouth without him catching, “but does Cas?”
Dean takes a deep breath, and hates how much he has to hold himself back from screaming at the child.
Cas shoves his hands in his pockets instead, nodding towards the ugly seats inside that you could see through the window.
He gives Cas’s hand a squeeze, and Cas hides his face against the back of Dean’s neck, breathing him in.
He’d fallen asleep before he made his way to his own bed. Jack must’ve climbed on top of him during the night, and Cas has occupied the empty space, the space that is against Dean’s side as he lays there on his back.
Dean hates undercover cases, but he loves the food in this one. There are waiters walking around with silver trays in their hands, stacked with all kinds of small foods, and Dean’s determined to taste all of them during the evening.
The date has been nice. Cas has enjoyed himself and he’s feeling comfortable and relaxed, Mick has been a lovely date all evening. He’s been a gentleman and even though Cas fell into his thoughts too many times, he was always smiling and at least didn’t show he noticed how Cas spaced out into his own shit a few times.
The kisses get more urgent and Dean pushes Cas gently on his back, throwing a leg over him, straddling him. The man under him lifts his head and Dean takes it as an invitation and places his lips on Cas’s neck, just below his ear, where he starts a trail of wet, hot kisses down the skin of Cas’s throat.
in everything, and apparently, he expects Dean to be like that too. He sure likes to point out all his flaws, had the nerve to comment on his climbing skills earlier today at today’s activity they were holding for the younger group, rubbing his own
“Could ask you the same thing”, Dean says, leaning casually against the bar. It’s not unusual for them to run into each other when they’re working jobs, but it’s always just as annoying, “We got this.”
Even though it’s too late and he knows it, Dean still thinks if it was possible to cancel the Christmas plans and drive back home, lock himself inside his apartment and just stay there, drink beer and binge watch a series until the holidays are over and it’s time to go back to college.
“Fuck, Cas, I’ve wanted to do this for so long”, he pants as he trails kisses down his neck. There’s a hand moving all the way down, and Cas can’t hold in any sounds when Dean works his hand on him, the heat of it building in him fast as Dean whispers stuff in his ear, and he’s almost there, but someone’s banging at the door—
Cas just lifts his hands in surrender, not saying anything, amused by how defensively Dean opens the beer and takes a sip.
Cas is trapped against the opposite wall, sitting down, head hanging, but the same invisible force keeping him pinned there. They’re alone in the room.
Cas had been with Jack last night, and Dean had felt weird hanging around avoiding the two. He had gone to his apartment instead, had nothing to do there, so he went out and got drunk.
This slightly odd trio that somehow, after all that mess and fights and sleepless nights, had shifted into a surprisingly functional team.
Cas turns to look at him from where he’s kneeling on the floor, “You take your jewelry off before showering, right?”
“Okay”, his uncle pretends to buy into it before grimacing, “And don’t pretend you couldn't use some beauty sleep, you ain’t that pretty.”
“We’ll obviously consider all possibilities, but Jack is very young”, Bevell says, “and taking care of a growing toddler requires a lot, we consider them unfit for the position based on age alone.”
He shoots an angry glance at the dark haired boy in question, who stands next to him, holding two paint brushes.
The beer is warm, and to be honest not even that good, but still so perfect.
“Smile a bit, would you?” Dean says, tugging at Cas’s hand, “Your murderous look will give away our bad intentions.”
“Dean–”
Cas checks the weight of the fish, and drops it to the cart, “I can’t see you as a pet name person in general.”
“What the fuck happened?”
he had been.
Cas doesn’t say anything right away, there’s sounds of something cooking on the stove on his end of the line, Jack’s sound is distant in the background.
There’s a smile in Cas’s thanks, but Dean can’t risk looking up at it.
Dean drops his eyes, shaking his head, “I’ve really started to see the similarities”, he argues weakly.
Jo and Charlie share one of their looks, before staring at him again.
", Dean barks, "because—"
“Which is why you are my plus one at all my art shows at the new gallery.”
Cas wakes up with a terrible headache.
“That’s too bad”, Cas smiles.
Jack walks around the thing, peeking in from the small windows Dean’s made, making approving sounds. Cas keeps his eyes strictly on the child. Just for his safety, and not because Dean’s standing so much closer now than when he was sitting on the grass by the castle.
Bevell smiles a bit, “The situation is good because Jack has only just turned three. Finding a family for a child so young is always easier than with the older children.”
Dean can’t stop himself. He brushes a gentle finger over Cas’s paint stained cheekbone. He manages to get a little bit of paint on the same exact spot every time he’s working on something. “Don’t worry about it, I’m just damn happy you’re okay”, he says around the lump back in his throat, “Got me worried for a second.”
, Charlie points out, disapprovingly glancing at Dean before looking at Cas, “and he’s dragged you down with him, I see.”
“Cas”, he whispers, when he starts feeling too creepy about the staring, “Hey, Cas”, he repeats a bit louder when the man doesn’t react. He gently shakes Cas from the blanket covered shoulder,
“I know you hate those chairs.”
“I wasn’t speaking very politely about you either, and I apologize”, Cas adds, lowering his gaze to his hands.
his brother asks when he doesn’t answer right away.
“What is that?” Cas asks suspiciously like Dean’s holding a dead squirrel and not a cowboy hat.
“Actually”, Charlie starts, and pulls another envelope out of her bag, “Could you give this to him?”
Jack seems like he’s had a secret stash of sugar in his bedroom and while they slept, he’s emptied it all.
It’s Dean’s fault. While he didn’t light the cigarette between his lips, he was an ass enough to make Cas light it. Thinking about Dean makes Cas pick up his pace, even if his legs are burning already for the lack of a proper warm up. He knows he broke the rule by inviting Mick in, but Dean was still an asshole about it. He called Mick his random hookup, even if they haven’t even had sex, especially not at the house.
Cas gets to leave home on the promise of someone picking him up and staying with him, and Dean gets out of his shift just in time. He drives up to the hospital to pick him up, and he has a day off tomorrow, so it’s all settled.
“Still, you’re a dick”, Dean huffs, ignoring the thought.
the point of this chapter was to give me an opportunity to write bed sharing, a very treat myself trope. i love you all reading this story and leaving kudos and comments, so if you want, share your thoughts with me! <3
“It’s a
“What?”
“You barely did. Have fun.” And then he’s out, closing the front door after himself.
They could do that, easily, if it wasn’t for the full nights sleep waiting for them.
They get to buy some candy, because it’s Friday, and Jack starts crying because the store has run out of the nougat he loves.
“What’s eating you, Donna?” Jody asks when she notices the unusual mood on her.
“Jack”, Dean sighs and drops his head, “I have to get to work.”
“Clever”, Charlie smiles, “You just gotta let him do his thing and when he’s done, he’s usually in a better mood.”
“Yeah, well, we’re not watching shit like
Jack looks at them like he recognizes them, when they enter the room where he’s waiting for them with someone who looks like a shrink. She’s wearing a cardigan and a colorful key chain around her neck, everything about her screaming warm and welcoming to listen. She has to be a shrink.
He considers for a moment if he should text Cas, since he’s Jack’s godparent as well, but decides against it, for two reasons.
But the end of this is inevitable, and wallowing in his hopes is just stupid, so Cas forces himself to throw his legs to the side and reach towards the floor to grab any clothes from there, knowing his movements will probably wake Dean up.
“If I’m being completely honest, I am afraid of the cake I ordered”, he jokes, walking over to the fridge to grab something from there. “So, in case we have to burn it with holy fire, I thought pie makes a good back up.”
“I’m asking you to be my boyfriend”, Dean blurts out, “or–something?”
one of the best things about writing this story has been the amount of new things i've learned about peppa pig and paw patrol while i've done my research
Jack takes a firm hold of the steering wheel, knuckles white when he holds it like his life depends on it, “No!”
A sick feeling hits his stomach instantly as he lifts his phone back to his ear.
“Right”, Dean glances down at the dripping wet brush in his hand and gets an idea.
or when Sam jokes the same way with Cas as Dean does with Eileen.
“Don’t be a wuss, Dean”, Sam teases.
Mr. Kline looks empty and hopeless, but Dean, he’s all but empty, something hot boiling somewhere deep inside of him. It only comes out in the angry steps and crossed arms as he keeps walking around the hallway, only stopping whenever the hospital staff join them.
Now that the game is paused, Charlie takes the time to change the settings she had complained about before, “How did Cas take it?”
Mick walks past Dean, giving him a polite smile, saying it was nice to meet him, but Dean’s too busy quietly fuming to react with anything other than a nod.
Dean considers the shots with an unsure look on his face. He doesn’t feel like it. Like, at all. His mind is still stuck on the two at home.
“Dean?”
Dean smiles as well.
Life with a toddler was phases after phases after phases. At first, Jack was content with playing just about any toys they had around the house, but as time goes on, he’s starting to express preferences and voicing his opinions - very strong opinions one might add - on things like food, clothes or the choice of toys for a play.
“Not like this, not while we’re drunk”, Dean finally finishes. “I can’t— but if you still want, later—"
“What’s that?” Sam asks as Dean walks into the kitchen, the paper in his hand.
“And we should do that too”, Dean says firmly, raising his cup, “So what do you say we toast to some kid free time and get on with the plan?”
Dean is staring at somewhere in the distance, chewing the inside of his cheek, and Cas is scared he said something too much, mentioning her too suddenly, but eventually Dean chuckles as well.
“You feeling better already, kid?” he asks, not really expecting an answer from a half asleep toddler, but filling the silence anyway, “Had us worried for a second, but the doctor said you’ll be fine”, he stops his hand for a second to put his palm against Jack’s forehead, checking the temperature.
The list of movies stops moving on the screen as Cas stops scrolling down, turning to level him with a look.
“Dean.”
Cas brings his hands up, holding Dean by the arms, and for a moment they’re just kind of holding each other silently, and it should be awkward, but it’s not.
“When that tiny sunshine gets angry you can hear it through the whole house”, he explains, pointing at the kid, when the others frown at his reaction.
“It doesn’t hurt at all”, Cas assures from the bedroom door, where he’s following all this go down, “It wouldn’t fall on your face all the time if it’s a bit shorter.”
He looks at the redhead from head to toe, and after hugging Ellen and Jo, he holds out his hand.
He breaks the silence they've fallen into. Or the pain killers do, probably, because what he hears himself say is:
“Your favorite birthday present”, Dean helps as he notices Cas is totally out of their conversation. The man looks thoughtful for a moment.
“Trouble in paradise?” someone asks, and they snap their attention to an older woman who’s talking to them, eyeing them slightly amused.
Benny hums and nods in a way that makes Dean want to ask him what he means with that.
either”, Dean says, turning the volume down a bit as a car explodes on the screen, and the kid’s already asleep.
He looks like he’s holding back a smile as well, though.
: what he wanted to eat, what he wanted to wear, how many episodes of Paw Patrol he wanted to watch in a row.
“Now, I hear there were wee thieves at my charity event”, she starts, looking at them both in turns. She hooks a finger on the necklace she has on, pulling it from underneath her dress.
“No”, Mrs. Kline’s voice is quiet and weak, but the relief of the answer doesn’t last long when she continues, “but you should still come here quickly.”
Dean answers with one look.
He snaps into reality and turns around from the window. “Yes, I am. Sorry.”
“No, what?” Cas frowns.
“Don’t be silly, I know who you are, hunters”, she spits the word out like saying it would burn her tongue, “All it took to confirm it was a little eavesdropping at the charity event, some magic”, she explains, “Little nudging you to the right direction, and you dumb little things walked right into my trap, like ducklings.”
Jack hides himself behind the shower curtain, only his little toes visible from underneath it.
The guard has a slightly doubtful look on his face, as he eyes them both, and this has got to be the stupidest
The man arrives at the bathroom door, popping his head in. “Yeah?”
There’s a car honking behind him and he realizes that the traffic is moving forwards, and snaps his mind out of it, trying to focus on the workday ahead.
“God, you’re a nerd”, Dean mocks, rolling his eyes.
Charlie sits down on the couch next to him, nudging a foot against his.
, Novak?” he manages. Before the other boy can answer anything though, Dean strikes back on reflex, painting a white line across the shirt he already stained a bit.
When Jack is on his nap, Dean leaves Cas alone at home and heads to the store, and an hour later Cas watches from the kitchen window as the man empties the car, making endless rounds to the backyard to get all the stuff there. He gets back to his computer when Dean’s done and starts working in the backyard.
She puts the controller on the coffee table, throwing her feet next to it as she leans back on the couch, “Good to see you smiling so much.”
Considering how Cas is walking down the hallway he assumed right, and the kid’s just gone under.
The man in front of him is biting his bottom lip a bit from keeping himself from smiling, because he knows what Dean’s asking, or desperately trying to ask, and it’s already lifting some of the tension off Dean’s chest.
Jack walks up to the two, a hand full of something he’s carefully carrying. He reveals a tiny handful of small rocks, looking up at Dean, “Can I take these with me so I can see if these are smaller than the small rocks we found at the sand box?”
“We love you too”, Cas reacts first, still looking at Dean before dropping his eyes on Jack.
“I once hid the last one of these on the top shelf and told Jack we didn’t have any. I drank it while he was sleeping.”
Cas made the pie from scratch. He hates baking.
“Garth was even worse than me, why are you not bitching to him?”
It looks like a life put on pause. There’re toys on the floor, an empty coffee mug on the table in front of the couch, pillows on the armchair pressed like someone’s just been sitting there.
“Jack’s a bit shy but he’s getting along.”
“What? It’s a costume party”, Dean explains, forcing Cas to take the hat to grab another one from the backseat, similar to the one Cas is holding.
He realizes he’s holding Cas by his shoulders and he wants to shake the horrible, unsure look away from his face. He seriously can’t think that he’s not good at this.
It’s a warm Saturday afternoon, and the driveway is already packed with cars when Dean arrives at Kelly’s house. He parks the Impala further away from the house, behind some grey Prius. He takes a quick peek at himself from the rearview mirror, but there’s not much he can do about his appearance, since he’s coming straight from work. Reaching towards the leg space of the passenger side, he grabs the orange flowers he got for Kelly before getting out of the car.
“Yeah”, he smiles, glancing at the meat on the shelves for support, “I’ve been busy.”
focusing on it, and I can tell you are not doing it properly.”
“It’ll be a few hours, tops.” He almost jumps when Dean arrives at the kitchen door, giving a quick nod at the man before he disappears again, the sound of the front door letting him know that he left.
The man slumps down at the kitchen table, picking up a piece of paper, where he’d listed Jack’s requests for the cake, “That wasn’t everything”, he continues, sounding sorry for himself and for the bakery staff person.
“I’m already scared what happens when we put sugar in this system”, Dean says, swaying a little when Jack next to him jumps.
“Okay, where Bobby keeps his booze?”
“I do hate the chairs”, he gives Cas his best charmer smile, “Do you happen to know a place with better seats?”
voice, “We have to, we—we owe her that.”
Cas repeats with an emphasis on the word, nodding towards the lump behind the curtain, and Dean finally understands what it’s about.
Benny chuckles at that, “That’s too bad, you were such a great cat whisperer.”
Charlie clears her throat to get everyone’s attention, stating that she’s never made out with a man, and that fortunately makes them both drink and stop with the staring.
Jack watches carefully as Cas takes off his watch and hands it over.
Cas can’t help but glance to the living room from the kitchen door, a fond smile tugging at his lips when he sees Jack crawl out of the fort and into Dean’s arms, the man closing his eyes as the small boy climbs into his lap, tiny arms around his neck. Dean presses a kiss into Jack’s hair, and Cas has to look away, doing his best to focus back on the dishes.
“We can just have a barbecue now”, Cas compromises, “And have a birthday party for you in January, if you’re so eager to have one.”
Cas looks up, his defeated look shifting into a confused one.
And they’re cuddling, again. Dean considers waking Cas up, but it would be cruel, the man is clearly tired as fuck to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position. His fingers start absentmindedly drawing figures on Cas’s shoulder as he pretends to focus on the movie.
There had been some disagreements about when to go to sleep all week, and it seems it’s not getting better just yet.
“Ability to draw dogs is a good quality”, Cas nods.
, it’s just been forever since Cas’s been out on a date, and his body is taking it out on him, because he’s attractive and always around. Mick sounds like a nice person based on what Anna has told Cas, he’s clearly interested if he hasn’t told Anna to shut up already, and Cas has no desire to try to find a date on his own.
I am–asking you to–” Dean lets out a frustrated sound, “at least to eat before you go.”
Jo waits for exactly one second after her mom’s disappeared behind the corner, before she gets up and rubs her hands together, and like a teenager, she asks:
“You got here okay?”
The man turns back to face him, his shoulders relaxing a bit as he lets out a breath, “Figured as much, when I dropped you off.”
Cas returns the expression. Maybe this really isn’t about something holding him back, maybe it’s just the atmosphere of the date, which is good and comfortable, but maybe not heated in a way it should be. Mick seems sweet and if Cas would date him, maybe taking it slow is the right thing to do.
Dean tries to ignore the way Cas removes his own hands from the belt buckle when he sees Dean step closer, blue eyes watching him, waiting and inviting. He opens the buckle and the zipper as nonchalantly as he can, before taking a hold of Cas’s wrists and pulling him to a seated position.
“Did you just yawn?” Dean asks in between the kisses they’re trying to keep on having, but it becomes impossible when it catches Dean who, just as tired as Cas, yawns as well.
It works really well, but it has one huge con.
Dean thinks about handing Jack over to someone who is not him or Cas, for a whole night. He doesn’t like the thought.
“I do make mistakes outside of camp, too”, he points out, shrugging and some of the sadness of Novak’s eyes wash away when he frowns.
Dean sits down on the edge of the coffee table to be on the same level with Jack, which according to Cas’s research is important when you have serious conversations with children. Cas squeezes to the tiny space left next to him.
“I suggest we figure out the work hours, and use this to generally book time away”, Cas continues, “I know it seems stupid, but we have to do something about this.”
“Look at you”, he praises, and gives him another spoonful of soup, “You’re living the life, watching TV and having someone feed you. You good under the blanket with Cas?”
The door swings open, “You can drop the marriage act already.”
“We’re gonna have a great night, us three”, Dean mutters to himself before following the kid.
“I have to fix her before I drive to work tomorrow.” There’s more clattering as Dean is trying to find the next tool he needs. Cas thinks it’s either that or he just rummages to make as much noise as he can.
Dean leans over as well, lowering his voice that Jack won’t hear him that well.
The light changes before he has to come up with an answer. What he comes up with is more questions. Cas thinks back to the date night. The kiss on the front porch was nice. But that’s all it was, a nice kiss.
Then again, the person walking past them is the only other person he sees there, so he lets Jack browse through the pages in peace. While he waits for him to finish, he goes through the children’s books on the shelf next to Jack, picking up the ones that he’d think Jack would like.
When the silence eventually starts to become unbearable, Cas starts to say something. He’s only able to suck in a breath before Dean snaps.
“Whatever”, Dean mutters, but Charlie is already moving on from their bickering.
Eventually, he settles on a green band-aid that has yellow kittens on it.
Fortunately, Charlie has some personal gossip to share, and it overpowers whatever her brain is trying to figure out about Cas, and she drops it quickly. They fall into a conversation about whatever Charlie talked about with Jo, and it works as a good distraction for Cas to not think about how Benny now seems less annoying than he did a few minutes ago.
“The only thing that’s stopping me from texting Sam about how they’re doing is the amount of shit he would give me”, he admits, but Cas doesn’t mock him for it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can you read the bedtime story?” he turns to ask Dean, before he could wish him goodnight and leave.
Cas scoffs. He knew it wouldn’t be easy to go through with this, but at least he thought Dean wouldn’t be an asshole about it. It’s hard enough without Dean making him spell it out for him, but if he really wants it that way, fine.
“I think that’s his way of telling you to go and chat with her”, Cas adds, and puts the cutlery over the pile of plates.
Dean’s adding more food in the grill to cook, when he spots Jody walking to the backyard, looking around to see a familiar face. She’s with a tall man Dean’s never seen before but assumes to be Sean, Jody’s husband.
“It would have to be a really good breakfast.”
“She thought I’m dating Cas.”
Because he’s avoiding it in case Cas has second thoughts. Because Cas hasn’t said anything either, and don’t get him wrong, everything is great, and Cas has said he loves him a couple of times, and Dean’s said it too, but it doesn’t prove anything, does it?
Dean can’t concentrate on what the other man is explaining, Jack’s choice of words ringing in his head, “He called you dad.”
“What the fuck were
Dean lets out a shaky breath, chuckling in relief. He kneels on the floor, taking Cas’s hand, the relief of him being conscious making all Dean’s guards drop. “Hey”, he can’t not smile, giving Cas’s hand a squeeze. “Don’t get up, you’ve hit your head.”
Cas cuts her off, “No.”
Cas looks like he belongs here. Dean’s surprised by how
Dean bites his lip to keep himself from laughing. Cas doesn’t say anything, but the look he shoots at Dean is louder than his loudest
He just has to get Cas out of the kitchen before he ruins everything.
“Only awesome things, I assume”, Dean shoots a quick glance at Jo, “I’ve heard quite a few things about you too. Didn’t know you were joining us, though.”
”, she argues, “I pay taxes, I do good things. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a little power and immortality on the side.”
Cas once again gets home from work so late that Dean’s already putting Jack to bed when he arrives at the apartment. He drops his bag to the kitchen table to grab himself something to eat before he has to go through the rest of the emails left from today.
