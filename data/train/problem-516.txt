“Nothing to it,” Sherlock huffed. John heard the rustle of fabric and the creaking of joints as Sherlock lowered himself into a crouch and then dropped backwards with a soft “
Suddenly, John had the strangest feeling. He remembered Molly’s almost-words,
Mary didn’t question that odd statement, but frowned. “He got away from the hospital, it seems.“
“We need to relocate you somewhere safe within reasonable distance of London.”
At that moment, John shuffled a bit and made a rather adorable sound in his sleep. Sherlock felt a warm smile grow on his face... and then he froze. He was aware of seeing everything very clearly. John's delicate eyelashes on his cheeks, his hands clasped on his chest, resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder. He suddenly felt protective of him, and that was certainly something he hadn't felt for anyone in years.
They were crammed into the small office at the back of the house. Mycroft was going through a pile of print-outs at a side desk, giving Sherlock and John the occasional glance, eyebrow raised. This was probably due to the slightly unorthodox method the two of them employed in their search. John was reclining in a desk chair, his legs propped up on the large mahogany corner desk, the computer on his lap showing a large, detailed spreadsheet. Sherlock was sitting on the floor next to him, sandwiched between two archive boxes, reading out names.
“He informed me that MI6 is now officially involved and looking for Moriarty. There’s a lead, apparently, and Mycroft assured me they’re making progress.”
that lovers were supposed to adhere to and he, Sherlock Holmes, had never bothered to learn it? He felt like he was back at the hospital, staring holes into a sleeping John Watson
John was stunned, again. He knew how Sherlock loved the challenge. It was quite the concession he was making. “Tell you what,” John said, smiling. “You’re right, he will be back. If you’re telling me that you’re not seeking him out or taunting him unnecessarily, that’s all I need to know. So thank you.” Sherlock looked relieved at that. “But if he does show up again, I’m with you all the way. If you have a plan, let me know. Don’t keep me in the dark because you think it’ll protect me. That didn’t work out last time. I’d rather help.”
are,” Mary emphasised, stepping further around the table. John couldn’t see her gun anymore and it made all of his danger senses tingle. He slowly reached for his pocket, only to find it empty. His eyes flitted to Sherlock. Of course, the bloody git was holding John’s gun concealed behind his back.
John slowly felt the haze in his mind recede as he became aware of his surroundings. He remembered where he was, but wasn’t sure how much time had passed since he’d woken up last.  Something had roused him, but he still felt foggy and disoriented. Strong painkillers, probably morphine, he noted, that explained the feeling of having his head wrapped in cotton wool. A bandage on his shoulder, his left arm (goddammit, not again) bound tightly against his torso. The faint beeping of hospital machinery. Very quiet snoring close to his ears. Wait,
and that you’re
“No.”
John’s humour abated a little. “Oh.”
“Probably,” John conceded with a fond smile. “What are you up to?”
, pure and simple. So…, well, we’re attracted to each other.” He sniffed, sounding cornered. “Why does everybody make such a fuss about this? We could—“
“Huh,” John huffed a pained laugh. “Getting dumped and losing my job in the same day? Nice.”
Sherlock got up and gave his father a thorough once-over. “Your back’s been acting up again. You’re fetching firewood, but would be happy if I took over chopping some more.”
John’s eyes widened in recognition. “Oh…!” he mouthed and he turned his head to Sherlock with a surprised smile, then back to where the woman had disappeared in the crowd. “That was
“I already deduced all of those things you said about him from the state of his tea cups and his bathroom mirror.”
Sherlock grabbed his coat and practically ran back to the house.
A large hand grabbed his neck and slammed him into the wall so heavily that his head spun. His vision went blurry and he staggered, completely disoriented. He couldn’t defend himself, he’d probably just acquired a rather nasty concussion and he didn’t know where up or down was, let alone the bloody fire escape. He muttered “Mary…!” and desperately tried to regain his balance, when the large hands grabbed his throat.
He heard his gruff voice then, quietly beyond the trees. “Ah, fuck.” There was a faint thud, like a kick, and some rustling of leaves.
John let out an annoyed huff and waved his phone. “Haven’t really had a chance to go into it,” he said.
Sherlock felt John twitch next to him. He wondered if he’d say something. But John was staring ahead, resolutely pressing his lips together, and walking on to the stairs. Pissed off, but not rising to the bait.
Moran pushed them to the back of the van, nodding for the armed man to follow. He pulled the handle and levered open the two back doors with the other, his gun hand momentarily busy. Sherlock felt his heart speed up and adrenaline kick in.
He sighed. “I just wanted to say…”
“For the sixth time since you returned from the dead, I am sure,” John responded, glancing up over the paper. A small smile tugged at his lips. He had missed Sherlock’s sulking.
In a small section at the side of the page was a picture of him and John, dancing at the MI5 fundraiser. Sherlock blinked and felt a hint of annoyance. He wasn’t upset about the picture being there; it was just… it was a very good photograph. It wasn’t too grainy, and you could clearly see their facial expressions. John was leading him through the waltz, their bodies so close together that he had tilted his head back to smile at Sherlock. And my goodness,
, and... The last thing Sherlock remembered was them collapsing in the hall downstairs. Somehow they must have gotten into bed, and for some reason, John had decided to stay. Lestrade’s words suddenly came back to him as he regarded John’s arm effectively trapping him safely in bed.
Mycroft’s eyebrows went up. He was surprised that she agreed so readily. He’d expected her to snap at him and walk away, angry for his intrusive comments.
He sighed. For the first time in quite a while, he felt truly conflicted. He was mentally scoffing at John’s awkwardness – so there was a physical attraction, big deal.
Sherlock, perhaps John had gotten closer to it than anyone had before?
before, how demeaning and distracting—whereas now, he welcomed the distraction most enthusiastically. Nothing about pleasuring John had felt demeaning, quite the contrary, in fact; and everything about him seemed entirely and utterly
Sherlock scoffed. “Yes, yes, don’t we all. Now can we get on with it?”
He felt a rumble in Sherlock’s chest. “I was right,” Sherlock mumbled happily.
“Sherlock—“ John muttered between heavy breaths. “Sherlock, wait.”
Sherlock gave him a frustrated look. He studied John’s face a moment, then shook his head, looking confused. He hummed, making a bored noise in his throat, shoving the matter aside, and went back to his acid vials. And with a sudden jolt, John’s brain caught up with him and recognized that look on Sherlock’s face: he
Sherlock cocked his head and gave John a quick glance. “Exactly.”
“For example, you would not have gone into such a situation without backup or an exit plan, and probably not without consulting me,” Sherlock continued.
it was, Sherlock thought. This came too easy to him now. He was clearly a goner. Because all of the abhorring things that people did in relationships suddenly didn’t seem so terrible anymore. And committing to John really wasn’t an issue as he had no intentions of ever committing to anyone else
“—however,” Sherlock began and John groaned.
“Thank you.” He felt calm now, his curiosity satisfied and a feeling of contentment and safety settled in his chest. Sherlock would have done the same. Sherlock perhaps felt the same. Well, that was good enough for now. He felt his eyes close, and the last thing he remembered before falling asleep was his head dropping to a shoulder next to him, and a nose softly nudging his head.
Sherlock didn’t seem to mind, in fact, he actually leaned in a little. John felt his voice vibrate through his torso every time he spoke. It made him feel warm and comfortable. Everything felt simply… lovely. He couldn’t recall why he’d been so gloomy all day. All that
? Moriarty
John, to his mortification, couldn’t stop a small laugh that escaped from his hand-barrier. “Sorry,” he quickly mumbled. “Sorry.” He tried to school his features into seriousness, but failed miserably, of course.
John nearly choked on a breath, coughing. “I see,” he said pointedly.
“You haven’t moved since I came in and look like you’ve seen a ghost.” John laughed a little. “Tired?”
“He caught up with me,” Mary said. “I was hiding, getting a plan together how to get out of here so he wouldn’t find me again. I wanted to disappear,” she added, her voice a little sad. “I still need a few things from the flat, but that’s where he was waiting. He knew me too well and I was careless.”
Sherlock was radiating.
John felt a bit trapped and opted for deflection. “Uh... we put you in a taxi. Did you get home all right?”
“Yes, I understand.”
She inquired after his head and they had a brief, somewhat professional chat about the state of the concussion; she also checked the marks of choking on his neck and announced that he was going to be all right.
He heard a sigh on the other end. “John, a friend of mine works at St. Bart’s.”
Sherlock Holmes, but that he had, in fact, promised them a small press statement in a few minutes’ time.
“Come on; let’s time how long it takes for Anderson to make a pass at her.”
Mycroft laughed softly, still reclining in his armchair, his eyes close and his hands folded on his chest. “Hardly,” he murmured. “I lowered my expectations years ago.”
more so than he’d thought before.
John made some kind of unintelligible noise, staring at Sherlock.
.” Sherlock’s voice took on a pleading tone. John stared at them both.
By the time evening rolled around, John was frantic with worry. No replies to his messages, no note and no information to be gotten from Lestrade. John felt caged in by his injury and inability to move around properly. If he was able to, he’d have been halfway across London by now, looking for his impossible flatmate. As it was, he paced the flat a lot, watched TV and made himself some food, all the while thinking about what Sherlock could possibly be up to.
“Because…
“We’re not slaves to our bodies, John.” Sherlock’s voice was almost a whisper. He sounded mortified to even say it.
John chuckled and didn’t say anything, but that fond look didn’t leave his face.
John clenched his jaw and felt his heartbeat quicken. He crossed his arms and braced himself for whatever altercation was to come. Sherlock looked up and met his eyes with an unfathomable expression. They stood there frozen for a moment.
And why was that? Sherlock was reminded of a conversation long ago.
There was a crunch of dead leaves and sticks at the edge of the trees and a heavy thud. John’s throat constricted at the silence that followed.
A pause. John felt a growing sense of panic build in his chest, and it wasn’t helping with the stampede in his head. The arms felt familiar. The scent was familiar. He couldn’t understand it at all.
-	Everyone’s respective age
Sherlock heaved a sigh and sank down in one of the armchairs again. He stared into the dying embers of the fire. After a few minutes in thought, he shook his head. His mind was conjuring up the same images again and again: John nestled closely against his chest. John looking up at him with that so very fond look that softened his eyes. John, exasperated, evidently wrecked by such weighty sentiment that he was shouting, talking of regret.
“Right,” John said, and ran a hand through his hair. He leaned back. He sighed. Mary waited. John took another deep breath. She waited some more. Then she finally said, “I used to work as a… special ops agent.”
Mary huffed. “Yeah, I got lucky. That asshole turned out to be a terrible shot and missed all the major organs. I just lost a lot of blood. Or so the doctors tell me,” she allowed.
“Right,” John grinned back. “Next time you call me an idiot, I’ll remind you of that!”
Lestrade was watching them with some amusement. “Huh,” he huffed, drawing his own conclusions, no doubt. And for once, they’d be correct, John remembered.
. I bet they’re still working out whether she even lives in this country. I’m way ahead of them.”
Sherlock blinked. John had spoken incredibly quietly and serious. He detected a slight tremor in his voice. Sherlock was about to answer him, but then stopped himself. Perhaps this wasn’t a good time to bring up a certain shelf full of questions yet.
“Believe me, Doctor, I do not
He thought of some of the things Mycroft had told him. “Sherlock,” he said very quietly, gripping the hand a bit tighter. “I’m with
Sherlock just smiled for an answer. He was enjoying this… flirtatious banter more than he should. More than he thought he would. He felt the weight of that shelf of unanswered questions resting uncomfortably on his shoulders. He had been meaning to deal with all of it, but instead, he chose the blissful route of just going with whatever felt all right at the time. He felt himself drifting closer, and John did not seem to mind.
“No,” Sherlock simply answered. “But if I were, better that I freeze to death than you bleed to death.”
“I’ll have those,” Vivian Norbury said and nodded to Sherlock’s (
. Mrs Hudson. John was entirely unable to comprehend what she was doing in his bedroom at this time. He wasn’t sure what time it was, but it felt way too early to be woken up.
. At Sherlock.
Mycroft shifted in his chair and John thought he heard him mutter, “should have never come along.”
Once again, he wondered when he had begun changing his mind. Perhaps it was having nothing but John on his mind during his absence, representative of all he missed at home. Perhaps it was the shock of seeing John again, being back at Baker Street, having all these feelings suddenly rush in to fill the void of the past six months. Yes, that was a likely explanation. He would get used to it and then he would think no more of
“I said that I would have done the same. It was a hypothetical statement at the time.” Sherlock paused and pursed his lips briefly. “I guess I was right.”
“Oh, Anderson is going to have a field day with this one. You’re his pet project, can you believe it? ‘I believe in Sherlock Holmes’ and all that.” Greg shook his head, still looking bemused and utterly relieved. “How? No scratch that, I’ve heard enough theories. Why?“ Greg said, waving his arms at Sherlock, who stood there, calmly sipping the terrible hospital coffee, considering how he would seek out Anderson to find out how he could humiliate him a little bit.
he thought.
"Facts?" Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him.
Sherlock had stood by his side immediately and grabbed his hand. “John?”
Sherlock looked at him for a while, the tapping on his phone interrupted.
John thought he saw Mycroft give him a look, yet this time it was something that approximated a smile. He decided he must have imagined it.
“John—“ Sherlock frowned, annoyed.
“Except…” Mary mused, seeming to catch on.
? John had just
Sherlock frowned. He wasn’t quite sure what John’s exact relationship with the woman was, and he hadn’t made a point in finding out; from his estimate of their respective personalities, he knew it couldn’t last long.
Her brunette friend steadied her, but she was not giving up yet. She raked her eyes over John once again. Apparently, she liked what she saw. A suggestive smirk settled on her lips. “Well… I don’t suppose you two would be up for—”
Sherlock sighed and stood up. “Yes, I imagine we will.”
On the day of the party, Sherlock punished him for it by variously sulking or complaining. “I mean it, John. You are overly sentimental and I know you will try something.”
In his absorption, Sherlock completely missed the next surprise for Christmas until it was standing right in front of him. Mycroft had arrived, and for some reason he’d brought Mary.
What either of them hadn’t calculated on was how drunk they still were. John felt sure that he was imagining the shift in gravity due to the fact that his gorgeous friend was kissing him senseless; however, he had to concede he was wrong when Sherlock and he crashed painfully into the stairs.
Sherlock was silent, processing this. Mycroft, likely as not, somehow knew the whole story. He certainly knew about him and John. So perhaps, just this once…
and nobody had ever looked at him like that. And that was why he couldn’t stop himself, he simply had to say it all, embarrassment or not.
They broke the water’s surface just as the exlosion hit. Blinding light and noise erupted from around them. Underwater, John instinctively clung to Sherlock as both of them were swept backwards by a powerful shockwave. He faintly registered that his friend had wrapped his arms around him, cradling his head to his chest. A second later, they slammed into the wall of the pool, Sherlock’s arms taking the brunt of the impact that would have surely cracked John’s skull.
“Because if she was dead or harmed, she would have turned up by now. Your would-be assassins wanted to make a statement. Why else try to kill her on her date, in public? He could have shot her in her sleep if he wanted. So… as long as she’s nowhere to be found, she’s probably safe.”
However, there was one difference to consider: those images contained a happy, relaxed and confident John. He looked at John, and it occurred to him that he had looked completely lost in the bathroom earlier, and Sherlock wanted to ask
He blinked and even as he thought it, John must have seen it in his eyes. His gaze dropped to Sherlock’s lips for a second. He flattened his hand against Sherlock’s chest. Warmth spread through his skin, surrounding his rapidly accelerating heart. Sherlock, because he could, because there was nothing stopping him, leaned down and gently pressed his lips to John’s, feeling the body in his arms melt against him.
“Yes. Bed. We need sleep,” Sherlock mumbled into his stomach. “Keep our wits on… around… about us, John. Murdering old lady on the loose, remember?”
With a few long strides, Sherlock was over by the ambulance. John saw him and got up. He gestured to the rescue blanket on his shoulders. “They keep insisting on these bloody blankets,” he joked. “But at least they help with the drying.” As if to illustrate, he rubbed the blanket through his damp hair a little more before settling it back on his shoulders.
Time slowed down to a crawl. John heard another couple of shots go off as the snipers around them reacted. There was a piercing sting and then pain spread outwards from his shoulder. He grunted and clenched his teeth.
John was just going to sit in his chair and drink his tea. He managed two steps into the room before he froze and realised what it was that made Sherlock look so smug. His head snapped to the sofa and its occupant, and he was instantly completely awake.
“You figured that out yesterday, didn’t you?” John asked.
Sherlock sighed. “Molly knows.”
Sherlock was momentarily distracted. John hadn’t really laughed much since he returned. The wrinkles next to John’s eyes were fascinating to look at. “Hm? Oh, just… dirt from the window,” he replied.
mind you, and you sent me four texts demanding to know where I was,” Sherlock mumbled before he could stop himself.
Helen considered this. “But—he, this Moriarty, he would wait, he said so! He’d wait until I was feeling complacent and happy and then one day— he’d tear it all apart,” Helen cried.
“Actually, yes,” Mycroft answered truthfully.
“And nothing? Everything’s fine, everything is... normal,” John tried, sounding anything but normal.
“What about your bed?” John asked, amused.
“Alive?” Her eyes flickered to Sherlock. “As far as I can guess, four people. And that includes both of you.”
Lestrade ignored that, too. “I don’t know how you do it. He barely can stand being in the same room with other people because he thinks they’re idiots.”
“Men?”
“Hmmm?” John arranged his arms around Sherlock’s back inside the coat, gently stroking the fabric.
“I tried that. She’s not at her flat and called in sick at work.” Mycroft left no doubt that Mary was probably the picture of health. “I thought you might be spoon-feeding her chicken soup,” he added derisively. “Or are the two of you no longer a
), John’s stalwart support and admiration.
They wove their way to the bar where they found Sherlock studying the barkeep intently. He was just about to open his mouth when John stepped up next to him, slapping him on the shoulder unnecessarily hard. “What are you having? Scotland Yard is buying.”
“Thanks.” They shared another smile. Sherlock took a moment to brush the tiny debris from his shirt and catch his breath. John was right there; he wasn’t thousands of miles away, in another country… he was just here, in Sherlock’s home, at
“No, a lifeline,” John said, galled. “Moriarty would have killed her anyway, regardless whether she talked. She knew something. It was her last chance to use it.”
For his own sanity, he left the sentence unfinished.
“Sherlock?”
John finally beat down his overactive hormones and tried to focus on the case. It turned out a fairly obvious situation, once they knew what to look for, really. Margaret Fletcher was, in fact, Helens’ mother, and a visit to certain
“I’m surprised you know the, uh, other side of the steps so well.” John’s voice sounded hesitant.
“Your compassion is touching.”
?” John felt warmth creeping up his cheeks, his heart doing a little backflip over every single implication this produced.
John decided he had to calm down or he’d probably throw up, and that would mean he’d have to leave the bed. So he simply looked at Sherlock for a long while, focussing on his breathing, thinking of nothing but the face in front of him, waiting for his heart to slow down. The body underneath his fingers was warm and familiar, and a quiet happiness stole over him. John let out a long breath and finally relaxed his muscles. What was it yesterday Lestrade had said? That he was an idiot. John glanced at the shocking reality that was Sherlock in his arms. Yes, he really was an idiot.
John sputtered in his tea. Then he laughed a bit awkwardly and glanced at Sherlock. “Now who’s asking the inappropriate questions?”
Sherlock gave him a lazy chuckle. “True.” They reached the side of the room and Sherlock picked one of the tables to stand by. A man in a waiter’s uniform appeared at their elbows immediately. “Champagne?”
No, the only option was to try and continue as they had before. He’d pretend everything was normal and ordinary, and if John wanted to try and repeat certain experiments, he was definitely open to that; but he wouldn’t push anything, in case he was mistaken about John’s...
He pulled himself together and went back to Mary. She was sitting on the bench in front of a large picture of a landscape. He sat down and they regarded the painting for a while. Finally, Mary said, “I don’t get it.”
Sherlock gave him a look. “Now that would be telling. You already spill too many of my secrets in your blog. Let’s not ruin all the mysteries. Also, I imagine you’re quite good at it, too.”
“You’ve got questions,” he said.
“Mycroft?”
“Oh God,” John whispered when he saw the blood.
“Even you aren’t that cruel. Or perhaps I have underestimated you,” he bit out, his breathing becoming agitated.
!) and Sherlock (
. He bore no visible scars from the supposed fall, but there were dark shadows under his eyes and his cheeks looked more gaunt than before.
The door fell heavily into its lock. For a moment, silence descended on them in the unlit hallway. John took a deep breath and leaned against the wall. After a moment, he saw that Sherlock was standing by the door, very still, almost like a statue in his heavy coat. John let his gaze fall to the ground again. Sherlock had retreated for his sake. He was always observant, yet usually, he didn’t act on it like this.
“What, Inspector?” Sherlock said dismissively. “You know I put more stock in honesty than in socially acceptable behaviour. Don’t worry about offending me. If I didn’t want to hear what you thought I wouldn’t have asked.”
At that moment, the image cut to a live feed of Baker Street. Mycroft saw about a dozen people crowding around the familiar black door. And true enough, it opened a moment later to reveal Sherlock, dramatically sweeping onto the scene in his long coat and –
John followed. “The ones at the hospital? How?”
However, despite Sherlock’s reclusiveness, the silence in the room finally became more relaxed. Somehow, sitting together like this in front of the fire made John feel like he was part of the family. Even Mycroft seemed comfortable, and John saw him raise his glass to Mary with an acknowledging nod. Mary smiled back and winked. Mycroft rolled his eyes and John was reminded strongly of Sherlock when he did. Small conversations ebbed and flowed, every-day moments and forgotten acquaintances and it was all still pretty meaningless but it didn’t feel as tired as before anymore. John sank back further into the cushions, propped up his legs on the smaller sofa, which he had to himself, and relaxed. When Margaret topped up their drinks, he didn’t protest.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John again. They locked eyes and John knew that Sherlock understood.
Sherlock snorted a little at hearing their mother’s endearment and he caught Mary lowering her chin to hide a smile. Mycroft only smiled genially. “Wonderful.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” He finally asked, his voice a little higher than usual.
“Yes,” Sherlock said quietly and smiled briefly, which, he was grateful to note, stopped John short again. But before things got even sappier, he pulled a few clothes from his dresser and made his way to the bathroom.
“I don’t prance—“ Sherlock interrupted, but it was no use.
Sherlock simply shook his head. Mycroft had definitely gone barmy with age.
you need a partner.”
Sherlock took in his tight posture, stress settling in his shoulders, and he felt that he should probably reassure John that nobody was going to mess with his life again if he could help it. Perhaps he should show him in one of the wholly new ways that were now open to him. He glanced over John’s face briefly and felt a small smile on his lips.
“OH! John, it’s you. Good.” He spun around and grabbed John’s shoulder. He gave him a conspiratorial wink. “You can help.”
He had, of course. And he knew she was right. So why wasn’t he admitting it?
, his conscience muttered. “I live recklessly, because that’s how I like it,” he growled. “And I don’t need you, or my brother, or anyone breathing down my neck with all of their
Something in his voice seemed to give off the wrong impression, however. He felt the hand on his back slip away and the warmth of John’s body recede a little. John cleared his throat. “Um, yes, sorry, I—was just—“ he stammered, drawing back.
. It went a long way, Sherlock felt, to ease the gulf that sometimes appeared between them still.
John felt a little flustered from his tone. “Well, it’s not like anybody would believe me,” he said. “When I write about you coming back to life it will only confirm their belief that you are, in fact, a secret agent. That’s much more interesting.” He gestured at their attire. “And now we even look the part. Perhaps we should take a photo for the blog,” he added, musingly.
“Yes, I can relate,” he said, pointedly not bothering to soften his blunt tone. Sherlock glanced down and then quickly away again. But probably long enough to imagine the scene John had caused at Mycroft’s bloody club of silence a few days after the funeral. There had been a lot of resentment to go around.
“Wakey, wakey, my darlin’s,” he crooned, an ugly smile on his lips. “Aww, have you been cuddling?”
By the time they reached Baker Street, John was pretty sure he had progressed beyond conscious thought and now consisted only of needs: get warm, get dry, be close to Sherlock. They shuffled along the pavement and stepped inside 221B, and John took a moment to let the warm comfort of home wash over him. They went up to their flat, John’s tiredness ever so gently evaporating the last of his defences. Once they were upstairs, Sherlock carefully closed the door and removed his coat and sodden jacket.
, he wondered idly.
John held up a hand diplomatically. “Freddy, I don’t know what they told you, but we know the gist of it. We were on the boat. Now where’s Helen?”
Warning: sappiness and fluff to follow!
“Stop it, just stop. I can hardly breathe for all the sentiment you spew,” Sherlock bit out.
John mentally shook himself.
He tied the towel around his waist and caught Sherlock staring at him, still not saying a word. They stood close, their towel-wrapped hips almost touching, and John marvelled at the fact that they’d been so intimate and yet it didn’t take away anything from the mystery this man was to him. Sherlock’s eyes wandered over John’s features, dissecting him for information. His expression was unreadable, and John wished he would just smile and say
And then he’d botched it up again by asking such a ridiculously loaded question; in public no less. They were actually on a case right now, and John pestered Sherlock with innuendos. What the hell was wrong with him?
Sherlock couldn’t say how much time passed, in the darkness of the cellar. He was cold and his entire body was aching uncomfortably. His arms and hands had become numb from the bindings, his legs cramped in the small space. The only thing that made up for it was John’s reassuring presence in front of him, the head on his shoulder, slightly dozing. He could detect that familiar smell of home on him, of Baker Street, mixed with the older, more grounded smell of the Holmes house. It was both warm and familiar, a point of comfort.
Sherlock felt a slight wave of panic. This was unacceptable.
somehow missed something? Was there a
that he could picture the exact sort of sheepish face Sherlock made when—
John stared ahead of him for a while, trying to go through it one more time. In only a few short days, he found out Sherlock wasn’t dead, got nearly strangled to death, broke up with his sort-of-girlfriend whilst confronting that he was probably harbouring feelings for his best friend; he dreamed about both strangling and snogging him whilst still coming to terms with his death; now finding said flatmate had spent all night in his bed, holding his hand to hold the nightmares at bay… things had rarely been so complicated at Baker Street.
Sherlock couldn’t speak. What was he supposed to say to that? Of course he wasn’t
“Uh. I just texted you the address,” Sherlock said, still sounding a little stunned.
“Fun,” Sherlock replied truthfully.
John let out a little laugh and glanced back, catching Sherlock’s eye. “There are different kinds of safety,” he said quietly. What he really wanted to say was,
Sherlock walked over to his bed and picked up the hospital chart to hand to John. Their eyes met. “You nearly died,” Sherlock stated as matter-of-factly as he could. He tried to refrain from letting a tremor creep into his voice. Going by John’s suddenly pitying look he’d failed.
“That’s nice of him,” John said, eyes widened a little in surprise. He looked touched, something that was, Sherlock had to admit to himself, rather endearing. God, there it was again. He was becoming sentimental. He turned away and returned to staring out of the window, suddenly unsure what to say.
Almost as if his eyes strayed to follow his thoughts, Sherlock looked up. He saw the kitchen window from where he stood, and he saw John, looking out at him. He was holding a mug, and if Sherlock’s eyes were not deceiving him entirely, he appeared rather
“Oh?” was all he said.
“You think that’s it?” Sherlock asked, incredulously.
“So no matter what you want or what you decide to do, I’m not going anywhere. Not with Mary, or anyone else, so get that out of your system for good, all right?”
Sherlock scoffed, or it sounded something like it anyway. He let John pull him to his feet, overbalancing again so that he landed straight in his arms. John smiled, his heart full, and peeled off the sticky notes from his and Sherlock’s foreheads, discarding them without further thought. Then he began manoeuvring Sherlock into the corridor, keeping him firmly in his arms.
“Ingrates,” Mycroft added as aristocratically as he could, and sipped his wine. As he had predicted, Mary broke out in a fit of very un-ladylike laughter.
choices.
, he thought quickly. He suddenly felt madly out of his depth. John never needed to know about his little crisis of faith here in the hospital, about his thoughts and changes of mind about certain things. That would be better, yes. Decidedly safer, too, for both of them.
The rain continued to drum against the windows. The fire popped. Sherlock thought for a moment, then cleared his throat again. “Um. Are you hungry? I was going to order some take out.”
Mary calmly stroked her palms down her knees, smoothing her dark trousers. “Rosamund.”
"Missing a comma there," Sherlock almost purred, still possessively holding on to John.
Mary sighed. “So what happens now? Are you going back to London?”
, John cursed. Sherlock’s eyes became unfocussed and closed; his lips parted, relaeasing the last of their shared air into the water. He began sinking back down. John felt a panic grip him, spurring him on, even as unconsciousness threatened to overwhelm him. Adrenaline coursed through his veins and he gripped Sherlock in his arms despite the pain in his shoulder. He kicked upwards with one more shove. Just as he felt his vision blacken, his head broke the surface.
Phew, another one of those chapters that I've been writing in my head for ages. Also one of the longest. FINALLY! Nearly done, now. :-)
John chuckled. “Let me help you get out of your clothes. You’ll appreciate it later.”
“Oh, don’t act surprised,” Greg scoffed. “It’s the least we can do after all the grief he gives everyone.”
“We were both so loyal, you and I, and look how they left us. What does a pet do without his master?” Moran’s voice was a shadowy snarl and John felt the darkness encroach on his vision.
“Quite. Now. I need to talk to Mary again, about the incident,” Mycroft came to the point immediately. “She’s not returning my calls. Is she… there with you, by any chance?”
John felt more likely to be a hindrance than a help, but nodded. He took a few deep breaths and very slowly got to his feet. Thankfully, the nausea kept quiet for now, but he decided he needed to lie down again as soon as possible. Which right now seemed to mean: as soon as Sherlock was up the stairs.
in bed and who made people
“That’s all right,” Lestrade called back. “I hear that’s not so permanent these days!” He laughed as he turned the corner.
” He looked his brother up and down. “Whatever happened to
Afraid to break the spell if he moved too quickly, he plucked one of Sherlock’s hands from his hip and interlaced their fingers. He drew his face back, missing the contact already. Sherlock opened his eyes, frowning a little, his pupils blown wide in the semi-darkness. John smiled and nudged their noses together one more time. “
“We can’t just arrest her for changing
) before quickly licking his lips (
. The fake policewoman was already struggling to get to her feet.
“Never.” Sherlock coughed. “Pretty violent for just a ‘breath’”, he gasped, laughing.
Finally grasping the kettle, John moved over to the cups on the table and filled them quickly. When he put down the kettle, he noticed the slightest of tremors in his hand. And so, of course, did Sherlock.
John was still smiling.
them to be a couple? Oh dear. John becoming sentimental about it might lead to him expecting all sorts of things from him, which Sherlock would be unable to provide. Then John would be upset that Sherlock didn’t play by the mysterious relationship rulebook that John had learned by heart at some point. And he’d be disappointed and...
, indeed.
Sherlock grazed his thumb gently over John’s skin, his other hand continuing to brush through the short hair. John was taking entirely too long to wake up from such attentions, Sherlock decided. Especially for an ex-army man. He decided to help things along a bit. He leaned in and began to place very light kisses on John’s neck, breathing his smell of shower, pyjamas and just something
I apologize for the delay - I had to work a lot and my significant other is graduating tomorrow, so I helped with studying rather than indulging in writing. But from next week onwards I'll be on holiday and have loads more time to get on with it - I am really loving writing this story! Thank you for the lovely encouragement so far!
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice softened a bit. “You knew he was under surveillance. I told you as much. You knew what you would find. Why did you look?”
or whatever you want to call it,” he explained.
But Sherlock said nothing and behaved fairly normally all day.
John murmured in his sleep and Sherlock let his hand wander upwards to caress the hair at the back of his neck. He felt a pleasant tingle in his fingertips and noticed that goose bumps had risen on John’s skin.
, until he realised that there wasn’t actually a lot of space left between them. John’s eyes looked impossibly dark in the low light and Sherlock was suddenly assaulted with memories of John lying on his lap, bleeding out; John keeping close to him to keep warm, getting paler and paler. A strange feeling gripped Sherlock’s heart, a feeling that was both pride and protectiveness, because he had gotten shot
“John is… going to be fine,” Sherlock said, believing that to be the most honest answer. He thought for a moment, pressed his lips together and lowered his chin. “Thank you for sorting things out,” he added. “For us. And Mary. I know he appreciates it. Probably more than I do.”
A much-needed talk.
John sighed, praying to keep his head, and leaned against the metal, which was surprisingly warm at his back. The confines of their little seating arrangement meant that John’s arm was brushing up against Sherlock’s. John tried to freeze himself in space. He didn’t want Sherlock thinking he was using the situation to touch him. Or that he was coming on to him in any shape or form. He didn’t want him to be annoyed and affronted that John could possibly think of
The DI grinned. “Oh, that’s fine. I spend enough time with that lot every day.” He leaned in a bit and lowered his voice. “Can’t stand some of them personally, to be honest, but they’re a good team.” He nodded at John. “Besides, it’s good to hang out with you two outside of a crime scene, for once. That skews your perspective.”
There was Mrs Hudson, of course, and her ginger biscuits were excellent; they reminded him of his grandmother, whom he had been quite fond of as a child. He was always surprised how much Sherlock let her treat him like a mother, while he hardly let their actual mother do as much. It was quite amusing watching her fuss over him and Sherlock trying to keep a balance between seeming annoyed and actually enjoying it.
. Perhaps this whole relationship thing wouldn’t be so boring if he could
Suddenly, he heard a sound and looked up sharply.
John took a deep breath and looked up. And then he smiled as he took in Sherlock’s worried expression. “Yeah, I’m all right,” he said, and he meant it.
Lestrade chuckled and shook his head at John. After a long moment, he grabbed his drink again. “Sometimes I think he’s right.”
“That explains the empty street,” John mused. He took in the almost manicured garden, the bright front windows and expensive car in the driveway.
“Mori—who?”
“Sherlock. That was… exceptional.”
Sherlock slammed his laptop shut and shoved it onto the couch table. His fingers were itching to do something, anything, to distract him from this new intrusion into the already complicated situation. He could really do with a smoke. Or perhaps a little axe murder to lighten things up. He knew John had brought his gun, but it wouldn’t do to waste the bullets shooting the walls no matter how irritated he was. (Also, Mummy would kill him if he damaged her wallpaper.) Finally, he went and fetched his coat, pulled on his gloves, and went to the garden. He walked briskly across the lawn, the frozen grass crunching underfoot, until he reached the shed. He plonked himself noisily down on the bench in front of it, looking out over the field that stretched beyond the house, and simply breathed in the cold air for a while. He knew he had no cigarettes in any pockets (constant vigilance on John’s part ensured it) but he rummaged through them anyway, just to give his hands something to do.
He held his gaze for a moment, feeling the anger bubble in himself to match. “Moriarty.”
Sherlock looked amused. “Nice right hook,” he said and grinned at John.
John smiled, looked at his feet and briefly rocked back and forth on his heels. “Couldn’t be happier,” he said quietly as he looked back at the reporter. Mycroft let out a surprised chuckle. Well, wasn’t that a surprise? If Mycroft was a betting man, he’d have given the doctor weeks, if not months, to figure out exactly why he
John let go of him then and threw up his arms. “Oh shut up, genius, you deduced that last week when you overheard me talking to Helen!”
“Hey,” he said quietly, the smile still colouring his voice.
“No,” he said. He thought of John with his girl – or boy, it didn’t matter – behind the gym. He thought of Sarah, who had broken it off and how John had not been too bothered. He thought of the nurse and all of the women who didn’t mind if John
Something softened in Sherlock’s eyes. His mouth twitched. “Some of them will break it off within the month. Some of them will not go home together anyway. Some will, only to find it was a mistake in the morning; is it so terrible to hasten these things?”
! What a
“But then her sister said that the dog was gone and she’d assumed Caroline had taken it,” John continued to summarise. “So she was lying.”
He smoothly appeared at John’s side and offered his hand. “I’m so sorry to intrude, and I’m sure Dr Watson will forever reprimand me for this, but he did promise me a dance. I am much obliged,” he quickly added to stop the old man from replying. “I’m sure you understand. So sorry. Do excuse us.” Luckily, John didn’t question this excuse in the slightest. He just took his hand, made his apologies and got up to leave with Sherlock.
“I’ve been missing this,” John murmured, not even sure what he was saying. “’s like I knew it already, just so I could miss it.”
John took a deep breath and released it slowly. “Um… do you want to come over for coffee?”
A few hours later saw John, Sherlock and Mycroft seated in something that
Sherlock sent him a triumphant look. “Not one of your pop stars then,” he said smugly, and John found it hard to breathe now from laughing. Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile. “Your turn,” he said to Mary, and she giggled. The game was back on.
and yet here he was again, putting himself in danger for one of their cases. Something righted itself in his chest
“Margaret Fletcher is dead,” he announced in a voice like steel.
, especially when he could touch and
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice sounded steady, but perhaps a little quieter and more controlled. “But I don’t spend three hours folding and re-folding every item of clothing I own, John. So I will still be finished before you.”
“That’s not true, actually,” John said. Sherlock frowned.
When they arrived, Sherlock gave his hand a small squeeze, and John returned it before they let go and left the cab. Sherlock looked at him and nodded. “Battle stations,” he said, and John nodded grimly as they made their way towards the house.
John let out a laugh. “Not tomorrow I’m not.”
“Oh, thanks,” John scoffed sarcastically.
. Over and done with. Now, he might need this kind of attention to detail again. If they went on cases again… Would they?
“Of course not, his girlfriend is missing. And a criminal.”
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured, but it wasn’t just the answer to John’s question. It was the answer to
By the time they were finished, a different black car was waiting for them, Anthea having vanished with the first one. Under protests from Lestrade to be kept in the loop, thank you very much, they left, and Sherlock said ‘yes, yes’ whilst having no intention to go to any extra lengths. However, he remembered how John had looked at him earlier and felt slightly chastised – evidently, in his absence, Lestrade and John had somehow come to an understanding, and perhaps he shouldn’t piss off the former if he wanted to stay in good graces with the latter.
“Positive.”
“No, no,” he waved her off. “It’ll do me good to walk around a bit, and it’s not exactly noisy or strenuous, so I think I can manage.” He gave her a brave smile. Anything to get out of the house a bit, to stop him and Sherlock simply staring at each other, not knowing what to do with themselves.
.” There was a pause. “
Sherlock waved that away. “Oh, don’t worry, I went to Mycroft’s tailor and put it on his bill. It’s his investigation, so it makes sense for him to outfit you as required.” His smirk spoke volumes.
Yes, still in hospital, still thinking about the feels.
– had a pink tint hovering over each cheekbone, looking remarkably amused at this turn of events. He had deduced John’s very unimaginative ‘
He bounced backwards off the bed in one fluid motion. In a few long strides, he was in their suite’s sitting room. His bare feet made no sound on the plush carpets. The exquisite apartment was furnished with lavish mahogany furniture, art pieces and a marble fireplace on one side. Sherlock wasn’t sure if all the expense was for his benefit or for Mycroft’s or if his brother simply got these kinds of accommodations as a matter of course without really thinking about it. Sherlock had always been used to money, of course, but even he thought this was excessive. Perhaps being stuck in hideouts in the middle of bloody nowhere for months rearranged your priorities. At this point, he would trade all the shiny mahogany in this suite for his chair back at Baker Street.
Sherlock was quiet. Well, there was at least the fact that Mycroft had – apparently – sent Mary ahead, though the precise circumstances of that were still a bit unclear to him. Perhaps not a good subject to raise with Sherlock at the moment.
They stood for a moment in silence, watching John. Lestrade finally sighed. “Sherlock, it’s obvious from the way he looks at you. God knows why, but he’s mad about you.”
“Go on then.” Sherlock whisked his phone out and sent a quick text to Molly, warning her that they’d stop by. He hadn’t seen her yet since his return, and hoped she wouldn’t mind that the first time he’d show up it would be on a case.
. No Mycroft anywhere. He couldn’t hear Sherlock or Mary; both might be—
. He flashed Mycroft his cockiest grin. “I think I will, yeah.”
“Come on,” Sherlock said softly. “Let’s have a cup of tea. Make them wait.”
After dinner, they retired to the living room and glasses of good Scotch were passed around. John fulfilled Mummy’s wish and told them a bit more of their past cases, but the closer he got to Moriarty and the Fall, the less amused and the more sombre he became. Mummy seemed to realise that, but she gently pressed him a bit more until John reluctantly told them how he had helped clear Sherlock’s name after his ‘death’.
Sherlock swallowed, but his throat was too dry all of a sudden. “Oh,” he whispered, feeling supremely dumb for a moment. So
“Cheer up,” Sherlock said. “I’ve already spoken to Mycroft. There’s another safe house we could go to, smaller, with less people cooped up there. If you’re amenable.” He sounded casual, but John’s ears perked up.
John stared at him. “Wow, that’s a silly codename,” he observed. “What’s Mycroft’s?”
“Not getting into trouble, are we?” Mycroft asked, getting straight to the point. “Let me guess: you felt the charitable spirit of Christmas and decided to attend a random fundraising event you could find at short notice?”
They went in together to conduct the impromptu interview, Lestrade tactfully remaining in the background. To John’s intense surprise – this day seemed full of surprises – Sherlock actually behaved like a human being.
Mycroft inclined his head. “I would argue that you have done all you can here,” he allowed. “We’ve got the names and can follow them up with several teams. You’re not an agent, Sherlock, nor did you ever want to be one. You’re a detective. And just one man.” Sherlock straightened a little and his chin twisted upwards with a little of the familiar pride – it made him look more like himself than he probably had in months.
It was bad enough that he was usually three steps behind Sherlock in everything without anyone keeping any secrets.
Sherlock,
After a moment of searching each other’s eyes, Sherlock finally spoke again. "If you will allow me to point out... You always were quite adamant that you were not interested in men."
And then the image shifted and Sherlock stood on the graveyard, watching John.
Tea, long-overdue conversations, and finally, a bed ;-)
She stopped when they both realised that John had gone a bit quiet. Mary cocked her head. “John?”
Sherlock gaped for a moment, his jaw working a few times up and down before he managed his next words. "
Before he had made up his mind, however, John returned. He brought the smell of the shower with him, and he was rubbing a towel through his hair. Closing the door behind him he threw the towel over the chair, his hair now sticking up at all angles. He didn’t catch Sherlock’s eye, but threw himself on the bed again, his pyjama bottoms sticking to his damp skin, brushing alongside Sherlock’s arm at his side. He sighed, but it sounded just a bit ill and not actually romantically motivated.
“He told me at the pub. Said we owed him, actually,” John said casually, sipping his tea.
Harry was prattling on about how she could handle the drink so much better these days. About how she hoped to hear from Clara tomorrow, who she was phoning more often these days. John had heard that story before, but he didn’t comment on it. Let at least one of them labour under happy delusions for a while longer.
. God, he had to get a grip on himself. He’d only just managed to get out of the shed before John… no, before
They stepped into the room and the door clicked shut behind them. John breathed out, the stillness sinking around him like a blanket. The privacy of the room calmed him down. He turned around, swaying on his feet, and Sherlock steadied him.
“Christ. Don’t have to tell me twice,” he mumbled and made his way to the door. Sherlock thought he could make out ‘
John looked at him in surprise. “What did I miss this time?”
John huffed out one of his delightful little laughs that always conveyed equal parts amusement and disbelief. “No,” he insisted. “No, I grant you that she was a very respectable woman, but
A moment of silence elapsed, broken only by the sound of John’s steps as he slowly came down the stairs and joined them. He was dressed in jeans and a shirt now, but still looked every bit like someone rudely awakened not too long ago. “Morning,” he said carefully, looking between them as if he’d entered a war council. Perhaps that was an accurate image.
” he sneered. “And you brought the whole merry team, how convenient.” He laughed once, like a bark. He walked closer, brandishing a handful of cable binders. John began to back away, but Norbury’s gun flicked from him back to Sherlock. “Now, Doctor Watson,” she admonished. “Please let’s not cause any trouble. I’d hate to have to rip out the carpets so soon after moving in.”
He heard sirens and other voices. One sounded like the crisp, posh accent of Mycroft, but he couldn’t be sure. What would he be doing there? John felt himself lowered onto soft bedding. Someone began examining him. Something was odd and John couldn’t put his finger on it at first, but then he heard someone say, a bit urgently,
Sarah sighed and thought about this for a moment. “John, this…
Sherlock awoke some hours later. How late, he wasn’t quite sure, but it was daytime. The first thing he noticed was a dull headache and his dry tongue. He hated hangovers; that’s why he rarely got drunk. He didn’t like how that dulled the senses. He backtracked through the evening in his mind and wondered why he hadn’t stopped the drinking earlier, after having been tricked to go to the pub in the first place… oh.
“Please,” Sherlock mocked, “you don’t expect me to believe you’re working for Mycroft, are you?”
“He’s a
, or whatever you need to do, and eventually you’ll get your brain back.”
Sherlock spun and kneeled on the couch, his blue dressing gown twisting around his body. He read out the text. “
Sherlock took an automatic step backwards and suddenly, things seemed to move in slow motion. The man reached behind him and pulled out a gun. John didn’t think, he just reacted. He hooked a leg around Sherlock’s, buckling his knees and bringing him to the ground, making space. He pushed the hand with the gun away before the man could even move and rammed the palm of his hand squarely into his nose. He felt bone crunch and blood spurt. He quickly used the man’s disorientation to disarm him, and finally conked him in the head with the butt of his gun, knocking him to the ground, out cold.
"John. There’s an experiment I need to do before we … pass out," Sherlock drawled, his voice impossibly low and almost growling. He was so close now that John felt his chest vibrate when he spoke.
John found himself simply sitting to one side; Molly was perched on a stool next to him, watching, a stack of papers forgotten on her lap. At first, he wasn’t even thinking about it, he just
“Oh. And Moran?”
A few days after the case of the two dogs, John had to go back to hospital to get his wound seen to. When John returned with a less cumbersome sling, they celebrated by ordering food and inviting Mrs. Hudson to join them. She kept giving Sherlock dangerously meaningful glares whenever John wasn’t looking, and just grinned whenever Sherlock glared back. After watching a crappy movie with them, their landlady thanked them and wished them a good night.
Sherlock huffed again. “His orders may have been to follow us here, but I doubt your little
“Which part, exactly - the boring dinner or the breaking into MI5?”
“You just didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of asking for it, did you?”
Sherlock made an annoyed sound again. “What about you?”
Surprisingly, Sherlock seemed to really enjoy himself. He began laughing along more and more, the tension easing from his shoulders like it had from John’s. He was exasperated at not being able to guess his persona, which made John laugh, which in turn seemed to please Sherlock. John had to remember to thank Mary later – she’d certainly turned the evening around. Margaret had put on a CD with some classical music that felt vaguely Christmassy without being obnoxious. The atmosphere was contented, Mycroft was beginning to doze off over a book and Sherlock and John were together, safe, among friends. Regardless of all the other things unsolved between them, John was happier than he thought he’d ever be again.
John looked up, directly at Sherlock. “You’re going to be fine, right? I mean… there will be consequences, I get that, but…” There was a seriousness in his voice that left no doubt as to what he meant.
John swallowed. He had to get this off his chest before Sherlock derailed him completely with his shifting attitudes. He was trying to say,
It wasn’t comfortable in the tight space and John’s arms ached from being tied back, but this one point of contact made everything else fade away. Sherlock’s lips were warm and soft; John had almost forgotten the feel of them; hadn’t allowed himself to dwell on it. Now it all came back to him. Images and feelings from their drunken tussle and the half-awake snog the morning after floated through his mind. He wondered if it would always come down to extraordinary situations like these for them to actually have a go at this. He gently pressed closer into Sherlock and wondered if there would ever be any
“How long did you wait after your burden of a husband passed? Three months, was it? Four?” He tutted in mock-sympathy. “And he never got to enjoy all that lovely
John was, for lack of a better expression, walking on a cloud. Being home with Sherlock without a job or a case would, not too long ago, have been his definition of a nightmare. Now, either Sherlock was still making an effort to be nice because of his injury, or he was on some drug John wasn’t aware of. It wasn’t the occasional cup of tea or the comfortable afternoons reading; it was the talking that surprised John. He’d never talked so much to his friend, at least not about non-case-related things.
“New house, remember?”
“Let’s give the fire door a try first, shall we?” Mary’s eyes widened a bit as he lifted his lock picks. He swiftly ducked across the alley. “Keep a lookout,” he whispered and went to work on the lock.
,” he accused.
Sorry for the last minute angst ;-)
He felt John chuckle silently. “No.”
Sherlock grinned and raised his glass.
“Not thrilling enough to risk John, it would seem,” Mycroft said.
John let himself fall back onto the pillow. “Because I can. I’m still officially sick and we’re not required to run around London right at this moment, so I thought I’d have a lie in. You should try it sometime.” He flashed Sherlock a quick glance, fondly remembering the previous night.
As he undressed and unpacked the suit, a memory came suddenly to his mind, something that seemed ages ago. Irene Adler, wrapped in nothing but Sherlock’s coat, escaping through a back window in her house.
“Mind-numbing? Depressing? Dismal?”
Sherlock glared at him. “As deceptions go, it wasn’t very creative.”
He absently noted that the IV drip on his arm was long empty and he ripped the needle out of his arm. He pressed the heel of his hand on his elbow, stopping the bleeding, and ripped his arm free of the taped tube. He contemplated simply removing his hand immediately, but he’d probably bleed all over the white hospital bed. In his mind, he heard John’s voice point out that that was
“Strangulation,” he pronounced as he confirmed his first suspicion. “Very little congestion or cyanosis, hardly any skin damage,” he continued. “So… very
John looked between them like some kind of tennis match. They were hissing at each other like angry cats. “Will you two keep it down,” he whispered, but neither of them paid any attention.
John absent-mindedly patted Abby’s head in his lap. She was lying on the couch between him and Sherlock, looking up with sad eyes as if to emphasise
“Sounds great,” John smiled. “Looking forward to it.”
John gave her a rueful smile. “I honestly don’t know.” He sighed and looked back at the painting for a bit.
“No, actually. I have far better things to do.” He lifted his chin a little. “Like travelling to the middle of nowhere to see if my dear brother is still in one piece.”
His head was aching fiercely, but he forced it onwards. So his body instinctively reacted to John. And John to him, it seemed. The kissing had certainly worked out surprisingly
That evening, John collapsed into one of the beds in their tiny guest room with an audible groan. He and Sherlock were sharing one on the second floor. The room smelled dusty and old, and reminded him too much of bedsits and hospital recovery wards to really be comfortable.
“You don’t… have to come with me,” Sherlock added hesitantly, “But… I’d rather be accompanied by... well, the one person who believed in me.” He smiled gently.
“Shot went wide,” Sherlock rasped, and John nodded. “Good.”
John wondered in his hazy mind,
Sherlock at first couldn’t understand why he felt panicked at the thought. Was this just another thing in his mind that wasn’t wired the way it was supposed to? But the more he thought about it, the more he slowly unravelled it. John made him feel like he’d finally found his way to some kind of home. He’d begun to understand and with understanding came the wanting. He pictured their life together with this new element thrown in and it seemed really… good. He wanted that. And wanting it meant he was now afraid of losing it.
“Yes, dear, I think I will. My sister’s for Christmas, I think,” she mused, flexing her arm a little.
Sherlock paused a moment and then looked up. He turned around on his chair a little. “What were you and Molly crying about?”
Mummy looked up and her eyes grew wide, then she suddenly laughed loudly, and was quickly joined by her husband. Mary snorted into her wine glass. Sherlock looked annoyed and glared at John. “Oh what nonsense did you come up with now?”
Danby’s, the auction house connected to the disappearance of the objects, was facing bankruptcy, this much was evident from fairly public sources. In the afternoon, when John was hastily eating a very late lunch at a coffee shop, Sherlock finally phoned Lestrade. After a bit of swearing that John could hear through the phone all the way on the other side of the table, he consented to drag his hungover self out to meet them and coordinate at Scotland Yard. Sherlock was smirking all the way over in the cab, seemingly pleased with having caused their friend undue stress. Before Sherlock could leave the cab at the Yard, John grabbed his sleeve and held him back. “One moment.”
“He was never told, but it seems that the ambassador and her staff had been
“I’ll try but… I’m feeling a little self-conscious, to be honest.” He gave him a little nervous smile. Sherlock relished the fact that he didn’t flinch away from his touch. Ever since he’d used the excuse of helping John with his stupid cufflinks he was looking for further openings to be close or touch him. It was ridiculous in the extreme, and nothing if not a little too obvious, but Sherlock had a hard time stopping himself when John didn’t even seem to mind.
“I am,” John said, regardless, and flipped a page in the morning paper.
Mycroft sighed. “You know what, let’s just… stop with the bickering and the stupid games for a moment,” he rubbed a hand down his face and dropped into a chair.
“So, if you’re not using that large bed of yours, any chance I could—?”
John kept his hold on him. “Now before you run, you listen to me, all right? It’s Greg’s birthday today, I just remembered when I saw the pub. He’s my friend, so I’m going to have a drink with him. He was your friend long before I even knew him, therefore I think you should definitely have a drink with him.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and waited.
“But it wasn’t our fault. We were betrayed,” Mary said, balling a fist.
“Oh. Yes. It’s okay, really. Good move. Better than getting shot,” John said unsteadily, his façade crumbling a little.
“What? What do I
Mary handed John a cup of tea, then sat down next to him on the sofa. “Are you sure you don’t want me to stay?” she asked for the third time.
John finally relaxed and slowly let out a breath. He manoeuvred his arm around Sherlock and gently wrapped it around his shoulder, pulling him a little closer. John heard a faint content sigh from the area of his shoulder and smiled. This was good. This was fine. They were both alive. And the sudden lightness John was feeling and the amazing man currently wrapped around him made him think, for the first time, that things were perhaps better than fine. They were rather brilliant, really.
“It seems I have to make a phone call.” Mycroft pulled out his mobile. “Not something I do lightly, you understand.”
that Irene Adler had basically wanted to shag him blind. He was a little obsessed with her at the time, but whenever it came to flirting, he looked mildly puzzled or, at best, disinterested. It was hard to tell, with Sherlock. John had been wildly jealous, he’d realised in hindsight.
She sounded nonchalant, but there was a serious undertone in her words. “Oh Christ, he’s not… you know...
“Well, yes, actually,” John huffed a laugh. “You said you were miles ahead of them, I thought—“
“That surprises you?”
“Not… at the moment. But thank you. I will.” Sherlock hated how insecure his voice suddenly sounded. But then again, John’s genuine satisfaction at that statement amply made up for it.
. His voice came out a soft murmur. “So what is this, then? This thing… that’s happening?”
“I am perfectly all right, I tell you, you should go and see how John and Sherlock—“
And there it was again. John looked incredibly touched. His mouth opened as if to say something, but he shut it again with a click, smiling at Sherlock instead. In response, Sherlock’s heart attempted to launch itself into his throat. It was that odd smile of John’s, the one that conveyed pages upon pages of conversation distilled. It was quite a fascinating skill of his. Sherlock only wished he could control his body’s reactions to it a bit more. It was getting embarrassing.
. John believed him, of course. He narrowed his eyes now and leaned a bit closer. “Is this the empathy talking, John?” he deadpanned, and was rewarded with another,  more amused laugh. His lips snaked into a smile. “We should have that looked at.”
They looked out of the window a bit longer. “It’s like living inside a theatre performance,” he finally added. “But as long as it keeps us all safe…”
Data was the issue. Sherlock needed more input, more information. He very much recognized the irony of the fact that these infuriating questions seemed to only occur to him when John slept. Earlier, in the bathroom… well. At first he was thoroughly distracted by John for obvious reasons, and that had been good, that had been rather excellent, in fact. After, there had been a moment when he could have asked, but there was something in John’s eyes when he looked at him that had stunned him into terrified silence.
“This is becoming a bad habit.” Sherlock managed a smile, and John laughed with a desperate and befuddled look on his face; he was leaning heavily on one arm, but threw the other around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him closer for a brief, fierce hug before they were caught up in the police bustle around them.
“Yeah,” John said. “But it wasn’t the only time. He usually had an excuse related to a case or some other emergency. His timing was, of course, infallible.”
John snickered and followed him up the path to the house.
“I got them all, in the end,” Sherlock continued, his voice taking on an edge. “I made the connections I was there to make and when I was done, Mycroft fetched me home and sent in his nitwits to clean up the rest. And that’s all.” Sherlock poked at his own food, which was probably cold by now.
“Ah. Yes. Well, it was worth a try,” he added, and John could picture his sheepish face very well.
“It doesn’t matter if I’m
“You know, you should really come out,” he said, and before she could rebuke him, added, “there’s only so much puppy dog eyes a man can stand.”
Sherlock quirked a brief smile. “I love a good auction, don’t you?”
John winced and then laughed a little. He nervously rubbed his hand down his neck. Sherlock frowned. What was so awkward about losing your job? When John didn’t immediately reply, he tried a different strategy. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of, John, it’s just a job. If it makes you feel any better, I value your medical opinion when I’m working on a case.”
“Well,” he cleared his throat and broke the awkward stare he was locked in. “I am… flattered, John. And it seems you were successful.”
He sounded genuine, but John knew him better. There was definitely something he wasn’t aware of, and Sherlock was making sure John knew that. “So… what do you know about her?” he asked with a completely innocent expression that would have fooled anyone but John.
“Where were you going to look?” Sherlock finally asked.
He could feel Sherlock’s breath in warm, fast huffs against his skin, as Sherlock nudged him with his nose. John swallowed heavily, his fingers curling into Sherlock’s shirt on his shoulders, trying to calm his frantic heartbeat. But then Sherlock’s lips found his again in a brief nibble and John knew he had to stop and get them off the stairs now before he forgot himself.
“He is?” she said, looking deflated, but then her eyes narrowed. “How do you know?” She sounded indignant, the alcohol making her rather blunt.
“So, Lestrade was here?”
And something stilled inside him at the contact. He didn’t know what would happen after, but he suddenly felt calm, knowing that it was not all in his head; there was something between them, and it felt magnificent and they would figure it out soon enough. There were a million questions in his mind, but they could wait. He smiled and Sherlock opened his eyes and smiled back. Yes, definitely, absolutely magnificent.
John raised an eyebrow. “You do know I live with
Sherlock was quiet, but he looked like he was quickly running through his options in his mind.
Sherlock’s eyes darted back and forth between John’s, as if he was trying to figure out something. “Your chances of finding a specific person in London at this time of night with hardly any clues to go on are infinitesimal. You’re recovering from a recent injury and still require rest.” He glanced at John’s arm, which was still protectively bandaged against his torso. “You had trouble getting dressed and you are still in pain. You are tired but you didn’t go to bed.” He paused. “You were really worried,” he concluded.
Sherlock turned around to see Mycroft sitting comfortably in John’s chair, whilst Mary was sitting rather primly on the only other chair in the room besides his own.
And Sherlock suddenly remembered their drunken conversation from what seemed ages ago now. When he told John that that’s what he was there for: to talk and to empathise with people. He’d always thought John was just a clever actor, but now he knew better. The worry lines on John’s face bore witness to how much John wanted this young woman to live.
John grinned. “Well, yes. I made conversation, perhaps threw in a lewd joke at Greg’s expense, and gave him… lots of money.”
“Not to worry,” he said quickly, jumping to his feet. John flinched a little at the abruptness. “Thanks for your help. I’ll—uh. I’ll find something to eat, so there’s no need to fuss. I’ll be—fine.”
“Not just some nutter,” Sherlock said quietly. “The most dangerous nutter in London. He was Moriarty’s right-hand man.” His eyes strayed to John’s and he felt that flash of fear and anger again that he had felt on the roof with Moriarty when he taunted him about his friends.
. And I thought that Mycroft…”
a moment ago.
outside. “I had to learn that again, when I began my new life here. I had to study the other girls at work and remember to push my hair behind my ears and to giggle and straighten my blouse and things like that.” She smiled at Sherlock. “And you know what gets me? I like it. It’s not as boring as I thought it might be. Here I am, having a wonderful time being Mary Morstan – who would have thought?” She looked self-possessed and calm, but Sherlock detected a hint of sadness in her voice.
It broke the spell and John pulled back hastily out of the bubble they had created around them, his face feeling warm.
John finished pulling on his gloves. “I do,” he said and opened the door. “And if I could just find a way to explain that to everybody else, we’d have such an easier time at crime scenes.”
After about two hours of intense study, Sherlock’s eyes finally lit up. “Ah,” he sighed with that predatory grin of his.
Sherlock sighed. “I’m not getting out of this one, am I?”
“John.” His own voice sounded broken. Something was trying to claw his heart to pieces.
In the hospital, Sherlock had indulged in being close to him when he joined his bed. He had felt the need to make sure John was alright, that he wasn’t going anywhere. Again, John hadn’t
John bristled predictably. He turned his head, his rejoinder coming out in a snappy whisper. “It’s not the same, Sherlock!”
…! This sent thrills of danger down his spine and wrenched his heart in his chest. It made him feel more alive than he had for months, and it felt so bloody good that he wanted to laugh or cry or both. Most of all, he wanted to throw himself at the man in front of him, any previous conflicts about his sexuality forgotten, and lose himself in this feeling.
“I believe I could make you happy, too,” she said. “I think we’re not a bad pair.”
John came back into the room and eyed Sherlock, who looked like a kid on Christmas morning. They hadn’t had a real, grizzly case in a while. He grinned. “Well, I suppose I can always sleep afterwards,” he said indulgently, to which Sherlock bounded off the couch and quickly over to John. In his enthusiasm, he grasped his friend’s arms. John thought for a second he’d go in for a hug, but Sherlock seemed a little startled by his own reaction and let go quickly. He darted into his bedroom to change, and John shook his head, smiling.
“He sent me after you.”
He sighed and tried to put other people out of his mind for now. Mary was fine, Sherlock was apparently kissing him again; he felt heavy and exhausted with relief.
. Of course he had to end up dancing with Sherlock Holmes and of course it was messing with his head.
They heard footsteps. John cursed himself for leaving Moran’s gun where it was. Through the seats, he locked eyes with Sherlock in the front. The helicopter noise was growing louder. “It’s over, Vivian,” Sherlock called against the din.
Sherlock sighed and regarded her with narrowed eyes for a moment. “No, I think I see your point. Your husband would not have asked your opinion if he hadn’t thought you’d provide some insight.”
“Are you
They rested there a little longer, not speaking, simply soaking in everything the new morning currently had to offer. Sherlock found his thoughts drifting, not settling on any one thing; the only thing tethering him to the passage of time was his hand resting on John’s back, feeling the slow breathing under his palm. Memories of the hospital after the assault on John came back to him, when he’d finally been able to touch him, to reassure himself that he was alive and well.
“Oh, don’t worry.” Sherlock shrugged carelessly. “I’m sure there’s bigger fish here than us.”
“Freddy wasn’t happy.”
John was mildly surprised that he didn’t break the front doors as he ran out. A few startled officers moved as if to stop him, but Lestrade’s shouts from behind made sure he could pass. He sprinted around the right side of the building, turned the corner and connected sharply with the fake constable. She looked a bit roughed up, her hat was missing and she had a few scrapes. Without thinking, John simply decked her in the face. She had seemed to know what she was doing earlier, but she had certainly not seen this coming. John realised that if he had delayed by mere seconds, the woman would have blended into the crowd again and easily disappeared. She was dazed, but still tried to run. John mercilessly struck out his legs at just the right moment and grabbed her arm, tripping her up, rendering her unable to reach for her gun. He heard Lestrade’s shouts then, and a group of Met officers including him and Sally came running around the corner. John swirled around and he unceremoniously shoved the woman in their general direction. She protested, claimed it was all a mistake, but John wasn’t listening any more, his attention riveted on the figure ahead.
. Yes, it was definitely good not to be dead.
so… immediately?”
, John had no idea he could have that kind of effect on anybody,
John giggled as Sherlock actually pulled out his phone to use as a stop watch. They both stuck close to the wall, leaning around in intervals, commenting in murmurs as if on a sports match. John felt like he was ten years old again.
tumbled from his lips, “—if one of us is cynical as hell.”
Sherlock looked away. “Well… I’d say I outgrew ballet, and unfortunately, for
Greg had the decency to look embarrassed at that.
“You said,” John replied after thinking for a moment, “that I shouldn’t make people into heroes... but you’re not a hero, Sherlock. You’re my friend. And friends...” John cut off, leaving the sentence hanging. He seemed unsure of what exactly friends were or did that related to whatever the hell he had done. Sherlock knew the feeling.
Sherlock’s lips curling at the sight, he decided to join the conversation. “Well. Ideally, you left the bees enough honey in the first place. But you can add more if it’s not enough.”
’ that he thought was the same for everyone. Even if the sex wasn’t spectacular, even if he and the girl weren’t in love – it was still sex and that usually made people happy and relaxed. He understood the biological and chemical aspect of this, of course, so even if this was
Sherlock was standing by the window, absentmindedly playing something. He had no idea what it was; he just let his mind drift and his fingers and bow arm continued pretty much on their own. He heard John come in at some point. Then he heard John’s soft breathing even out as he fell asleep on the sofa. He didn’t even turn around. He would never admit it, but he wasn’t sure how to act toward John now. He was rather in the middle of working that out, as it were.
John argued, and he felt anger pulsing through him suddenly.
“Dull?!”
, so it may have just been his normal, every-day disregard for personal boundaries? On the other hand…
His face flushed a little and he looked away, regretting bringing it up. Sherlock had decided to pretend nothing was the matter
Greg laughed. “You’re a marvel, Doctor,” he brought out and took another sip of his beer.
John groaned a little. He quickly assessed his options. He didn’t fancy slinking past a client, coming from Sherlock’s bedroom, looking as ruffled as he did in last night’s clothes – people already talked, didn’t they? He may not mind, but it was still a bit too much out of his comfort zone. Perhaps a shower was a better idea for the moment. John sneaked into the bathroom and was immediately assaulted by the smell of Sherlock having had a shower before him.
John nodded again. It would be much easier to apprehend them in the middle of the river with all of the goods securely in one place – if the police came sweeping in now, the thieves had too many opportunities to flee the scene.
He looked at the text. It didn’t really convey what he needed it to, but for now he left it. He managed to keep away from his phone for about 2 hours before he’d convinced himself that Sherlock couldn’t possibly understand what he was saying with just one text.
Mycroft hastily took another sip of champagne. “I beg your—“
“Oh, don’t gimme that look,” Lestrade smiled wryly. “I’ve known you long enough. You may not be aware of it but you’re practically wearing your heart on your sleeve.”
in their eyes, so she tried to make it up by parading Mycroft and myself around in suits and boasting with our accomplishments.”
“Yes.” Sherlock’s voice was a deep rumble next to him.
“Yes. I was in the
Ten minutes later, they were in a cab, headed towards an address that seemed familiar to John. He was wrecking his brain trying to figure out why he knew where the crime scene was.
“Excellent deduction, genius,” he smirked, but his voice was full of fondness. “Come on, let’s get him into a cab. He’s better off sleeping I off at home.”
“Hm.” A small smile was threatening to break the sulky expression already.
“Oh yeah,” Mary wriggled her eyebrows. She cocked her head a moment. “Ah, speak of the devil.”
“Well, um. I better... be going, then,” Lestrade said. He stepped out into the corridor again.
John took the chance to take charge of the conversation. He asked Freddy everything about his girlfriend’s habits, her address, her hobbies and so on, and took careful notes. “So you’ve been together almost five years, and you never moved in together?” John asked after a while.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and he glanced at John. His lips quirked up in a smile. “Mycroft,” he simply said. “I told him to turn on the TV.”
the discussion and John’s input. Sometimes he was getting almost giddy, which was something he’d never admit outside of a serial murder case.
John laughed and suddenly roped his arm through Sherlock’s as they walked.
He held up a bottle of prescription pills. “From the medicine cabinet.
“Yes,” John grinned. He decided the confused look on Sherlock’s face was more than enough reason not to mention the fact that he’d just stated the obvious.
Sherlock picked up his phone again. “Sorry, doctor,” he said, his casual words not quite able to disguise the panic in his voice. “It’s not the best for this purpose, but needs must,” he said. John realised what he was doing when he wrapped his damp shirt around John’s shoulder in a tourniquet, pressing the phone down onto the wound. John flinched from the pain and clenched his teeth. “Got nothing for the back, I’m afraid, but I’ll try to put pressure on it,” Sherlock said, his voice hoarse. “Just a moment,” he added.
Mary squeezed his arm again. “That’s really special, you know. Seeing the things everyone else misses. You must have loved working with him.”
Sherlock twisted around so that he was on his side, leaning on his elbow, one of his legs slung possessively over John’s, and he began lazily tracing lines on John’s arm. John hummed contentedly in his pillow.
“I wanted to leave that life behind me. Completely. I like being Mary Morstan.”
Occasionally, Mycroft had observed and acted unseen in the background if it was necessary, hoping to spare John some unpleasantness. He never let him know he was involved, but sometimes, John would stand by the window of 221B and stare out, directly at the camera in the building opposite, looking like he knew. The resignation on his face had been hard to bear, even for someone as composed as Mycroft.
Sherlock frowned. "Why?"
,” Sherlock repeated her words.
“What? I—sorry, I—must have—it’s been a long day,” he stammered, feeling even more of an idiot.
Sherlock went ahead downstairs, where Mary was waiting for them with some of the team. Sherlock heard voices from the downstairs flat. He dropped his bag at the bottom of the stairs and marched straight to Mrs Hudson’s, following the sound of
“Good,” John rasped, sitting up. His eyes never left Sherlock’s as he gripped his hips with both hands. Sherlock felt his breath catch. Apparently there was no doubt about how John liked to be woken up. He felt anticipation rush through him and a small smile quirked on his lips. John mirrored it, and the desperate sincerity of last night was suddenly replaced with a kind of playfulness. John’s fingers dug into the towel and slowly peeled it away from his body, drawing him back into bed.
John gently raised Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissed the inside of his wrist. As soon as he made contact with the sensitive skin, Sherlock let out a breath and shivered, goose bumps rising. A similar shudder immediately tore through John as his arousal flared to life, demanding, driving him on. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, feeling Sherlock’s pulse racing through his lips. He heard Sherlock sigh heavily, the sound making him bold. He slowly parted his lips and kissed Sherlock’s wrist again, harder.
Sherlock let out a little laugh as he considered John. “Yes. You are.
“What do you mean?” Mary asked.
. Things would return to normal. And perhaps, then, he could examine his newfound feelings for John a bit closer, perhaps he could find a middle ground between the two extreme possibilities? He lowered the axe and wiped his forehead with his sleeve.
. Practise. That. The dancing, I mean. With other guys, in the, uh, lessons?”
John was already packing both their laptops and their passports. He handed Sherlock his phone, which he must have dug out of the remains of the desk, judging by the state of it. His hand lingered a moment to exchange a quiet “are you okay?
John said, tentatively brushing his fingers over the fake gravestone. And then Sherlock was there with him, wrapping his arms around him from behind, telling him the truth then and there because it was unbearable to see John mourn. And John leaned into him and sighed and murmured
Of course, John was pragmatic and had never tried again after that blunt rejection. He once thought that Sherlock was pining after Irene Adler, and the memory of the sudden bouts of possessiveness this had engendered in him made Sherlock smile. Irene herself had proclaimed them to be a couple, and they kind of had been, back then; in almost all ways but the one that most people considered of defining importance.
Unhelpfully, the taxi driver turned in his seat. “Cat’s out of the bag now, it seems,” he chuckled. “Mind you,” he raised his eyebrows mockingly, “you didn’t exactly keep a low profile, did you?”
John gave him a look. “That you’re alive, you tit,” he chided fondly. “Before we go in there… Molly?”
Sherlock looked at him again. In the dim light, all he could really make out was the barest hint of a smile over John’s lips. Sherlock thought about what he said, but after a brief moment he gave up trying to understand it. “Why? Was going on stakeouts a hobby of yours before you joined the army?”
“Our client’s girlfriend disappeared; I suspect she’s involved in a series of robberies Lestrade hasn’t managed to solve so far, so…” he gave John a non-committal shrug. “Thought it might be interesting.” His voice belied absolutely no interest in anything whatsoever. John frowned a little. This didn’t sound at all like Sherlock when he was on a case.
“P-posh git,” her voice broke off as she dragged in another pained breath, and John let out a watery chuckle. He briefly rested his forehead against hers and smoothed back her hair. “He is, isn’t he?”
“Widow found him this morning,” he said. “When she called us, it must have immediately triggered something in your brother’s office, wherever that is. He swooped in almost at the same time we got here and orchestrated everything.” Lestrade sounded exasperated, but also a little impressed.
“Perhaps it was a good idea of your husband not to tell you any details,” John said, softly.
Mary laughed. “You were playing Cupid, too? I don’t believe it,” she grinned.
A few drunk people were waiting for buses or catching taxis, carrying each other home. Normally, the whole scenario would prompt John to make some humorous observation or other. Sherlock enjoyed these kinds of comments far more than he would if they came from anyone else. Now, John was only silent and didn’t even question their route, their preparation, nothing. Sherlock wished he could explain how brilliantly the inane conversation that afternoon had sparked the final, the required, idea! But it seemed impossible to make a sound now that John had effectively gone mute as some kind of recompense for accompanying him.
“I don’t know. I guess I’ve just been taking notice of people. You know, remembering how someone walks or dresses or how they behave in specific moments. Unimportant stuff,” he added and looked around at the people milling in front of the paintings.
“Were you ever going to tell me?” John looked into her eyes for a moment. Suddenly, he was very aware that they were having this conversation right in front of Sherlock, and there were perhaps a few things he should have cleared up with him by now. Such as Mary having broken up with him. He lowered his voice a bit, his cheeks heating. “I mean… that thought we had. That idea, how good things could have been… did that picture include you telling me this?”
Sherlock kept himself busy on his laptop. Since this afternoon, he’d developed a certain manic energy, not even looking up when John briefly rested his hand on his shoulder.
“And since when do you not bother to check your phone?”
John began to kiss back, slowly, carefully, placing his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders to steady them. Sherlock’s hands came to rest weightlessly against his hips as he silently kissed back, the motion a bit clumsy but becoming steadier and more insistent. There was nothing John could do but to finally let go, everything beyond these few connecting points rapidly evaporating from his reality. His tipsy mind was circling around the same thought over and over.
He was cradled against a chest, another pair of arms positioned beneath his body to hold him up. The next few minutes John felt swaying, constant moving, downstairs, out of the building, barely holding on to consciousness. He let himself be enveloped by the smell, the warmth of two people carrying him to safety, knowing that it was bad, but that he’d live, he’d be fine, and then he would stop bloody hallucinating.
Sherlock’s eye-roll said. John gave him a pointed look. He leaned over and carefully pushed at a large sliding window. The boat had these all around the front part for the tourists to look out of, but there was a larger closed-off part in the back of the ship where they assumed the goods would be stored. Thankfully the window slid open without a sound and they snuck inside. They cowered between two rows of benches, half hidden by a low table. Sherlock held up a hand,
Mycroft still didn’t know what to say. There was simply no choice but to pull him out when he heard about what was happening.
“Why did you—“ he tried to gather his thoughts. “You weren’t sure yesterday that this was what you wanted. So why did you—“ he couldn’t say it, but he didn’t have to. He was sure that under different circumstances, Sherlock would have mocked him for his supposed prudery; but that wasn’t even it. John just didn’t know exactly what to call what had happened between them – it was more than just sex, that much he knew.
“Yeah well,” Sherlock pulled a face. “I may have changed my mind on that.” He glanced down at John and once again smiled that private smile that he reserved just for him. It wouldn’t do to smile at anyone else like that (not that he ever had reason to); they would just think he was high or something. But John knew him and he understood.
,” Mycroft began. “But we have reason to believe that there is someone who does not approve of Miss Morstan’s new life. She is being followed.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait, what did you just order?” John scanned the menu to look for it and finally found the cocktail – and its ingredient list, comprised only of strong liquors. “Blimey,” he muttered, looking a bit worried.
, John thought.
not this time.”
Having only treated Sherlock for shock and the after-effects of his ordeal, the doctor ordered more rest as well, at which Sherlock merely rolled his eyes. The doctor smirked. She turned to John and lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “My husband is exactly the same. No consideration for his own well-being. Make sure he eats and drinks enough.”
He straightened and took a sharp breath through his nose. “All right. Well. If we broke one of these jars, we could probably cut the bindings.”
Helen nodded, and together they went back upstairs, Abby bouncing happily around them. Helen immediately went towards the kitchen, where John could indeed hear Freddy talk to what he assumed was police. She didn’t look back and John was glad; suddenly, the entire morning caught up with him and he felt himself be weighed down with everything to the point where he couldn’t take another step.
Sherlock huffed. Either he didn't believe Mycroft or his brain couldn't accept the fact that John had no choice but to try and cope. He deliberately hadn't told Sherlock how his best friend had ‘coped’ by simply sitting in his chair for hours every day, staring at Sherlock’s empty one. Nor had he mentioned the more self-destructive tendencies John displayed for a time after that when he was trying to finish some of Sherlock’s unsolved cases. It had not been a satisfying experience, to say the least.
After a shower that was perhaps a bit longer than usual, John tentatively snuck back through the corridor, wrapped in a towel. He was still dripping a little, but he simply wanted to get to his room as quickly as possible. The flat was silent. It seemed he was in luck - the client was gone. Knowing Sherlock, though, John suspected he was lying on the couch or sitting in his chair completely motionless, thinking about the case. So John opted to skip the sitting room and moved quickly through the kitchen door to the landing.
“I agree,” John said.
Mycroft allowed himself a small, amused smile and gave his umbrella a twirl. He stepped back into the room with the two sleeping men and carefully closed the door. He sat down on one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs. And waited.
He didn’t say anything for a long time after Sherlock had finished. Eventually, he got up and dumped his almost empty box and Sherlock’s full take out container in the bins. He mechanically prepared some more tea. He had to remember to get two cups out of the cupboard again. With a stab of pain he realised that that meant he had actually gotten used to being on his own.
With that, she bustled back, waving at them to follow, and John exchanged a happy little smile with Sherlock, who seemed glad to be home after all. In the hall, they dropped their bags and Sherlock indicated a coat rack. John took off his jacket and gave Sherlock a look, suddenly frowning in thought. “Sherlock…” he asked quietly. “The night Mary and I were attacked… that was the day you’d come back to London, wasn’t it?”
Sherlock spent the night by John's bed, watching him sleep and occasionally fade in and out of consciousness. Whenever his friend stirred restlessly, he briefly placed his hand over John's until he calmed down again. He studied him, the lines of exhaustion and general strain evident on his ashen face; Sherlock was reminded of the grainy black-and-white pictures from the surveillance cameras. John looked like he'd been through hell.
“—very well, excellent shot, excellent doctor, excellent questions, altogether a pretty excellent chap,” Sherlock finished.
, John thought. “We knew hat there was someone behind the scenes who doubted my death and wanted revenge for Moriarty,” Sherlock continued. “People were commissioned to spy on you, to see if you met me somewhere in secret; especially when you continued with the cases. We were able to track the commission to the source.” He did not elaborate. But then he smiled slowly at John from under his downcast eyes. “So you were helping me, even if you didn’t know it at the time,” he said and his voice had dropped another notch. He sounded… proud. John felt his heart beat faster and forced himself to focus on the remains of his dinner.
He looked over his shoulder to make out the vague form of Moran gaining on them, but then John reached the trees and was flinging himself between them. Then there was the sound of boots on frozen grass, finding purchase, stopping, and
“Proof. The mole is not Lady Smallwood, it’s her PA, Vivian Norbury.”
It was hard to make out, but John looked a bit exasperated. He glanced up from under his lashes, and there was something in his eyes, and he briefly chewed on his lower lip in that way that he did and… “
They sneaked along the edge of the law, trying to keep in the cover of the trees as long as possible, and then passing on next to a small hedge. Everything around the cottage seemed quiet, as if nobody was home. There was no light anywhere.
my life. And I
“Oh yes. I forgot. British Government,” Mycroft said, in a throwaway voice in which other people might mention a casual hobby. “I have my ways.”
A memory played through his mind. Sherlock, sitting on the back of the ambulance, seeing John and realizing
“Do you?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow but kept his eyes on the road. “I’d rather you didn’t.”
“You’re thinking too loud.”
That evening, the mood was tense in the Holmes household. John couldn’t help feeling a little gloomy after Sherlock’s hasty retreat earlier in the shed. Once again, he’d come so close, only to miss his chance again. The problem was that he wasn’t one hundred percent sure what he should do. He dithered between too close and too far away; he didn’t know which was more advisable – should he simply jump Sherlock, profess his undying love to him, snog him senseless and risk putting him off? Or should he give him more time, more space… and risk letting him drift away? Either way, it all felt wrong. Everything between them was off-kilter, unnatural, out of balance. This thing, this decision, stood between them like a massive wall, barring them from returning to some semblance of normalcy until it was resolved.
“You’re not losing it, just… take some time and figure out what you want.” Sarah grimaced and quickly sipped her coffee. “Are you okay with that?”
Sherlock had the grace to smirk. “I don’t know what you mean,” he said, and John had to chuckle.
Finally, Mary said, “okay, I’ve thought about it, but I simply cannot think of a better way to say this.” She took a breath. “John, I would really like to be friends with you.”
They found Sherlock pacing in front of a small library. Through the open door, they saw what had to be Mrs Blanchard sitting erect on a sofa, staring into space. Sherlock gave John a look that said
Not more than a few seconds could have passed since they dove into the water, but the adrenaline pumping through him made every moment pass incredibly slowly. Sherlock’s stare became more intense as his eyes flashed. He had an idea. Raising his hand between them, he tapped two fingers to his lips, then pointed at John’s.
John had made sure to give Abby another affectionate cuddle before they left, assuring Freddy to call him with any news. Sherlock watched his antics with a fond eye roll. When they were back in a cab, he kept his eyes fixed outside the window.
“B-but it would only—I’m a criminal!”
Sherlock followed his gaze to the laptop that rested on the desk. Or rather, what was attached to it.
“Why then, by all means, order take out,” John said.
; I don’t see why you need my input on it.”
John felt flattered in the extreme. His friend liked to show off, but he hardly took the time to really explain one of his solved cases to anyone, except to John. Let alone that he enjoyed it this much. He’d stayed in hospital with John, even though he hated hospitals and was probably bored out of his mind. On top of that, he knew Sherlock never really slept much, so the fact that he felt willing to rest
John arrived at the client’s place about an hour later. After getting dressed and having breakfast, he vaguely felt like a human being again, albeit a bit tired. The house was a nice suburban place, not too shabby from the looks of it. He went up to the gate, rang the doorbell that said
were on his friend’s mind, Anderson finally succumbed to whatever Sherlock had drugged him with.
Sherlock was staring back, his lips slightly parted in surprise. Slowly, almost forcibly, his eyes dropped to the towel slung around John’s waist. His eyes widened, and then travelled unbearably slowly up John’s torso, finally meeting John’s gaze once more. John blinked and tried to take in the widened pupils, to understand the flush that tinged Sherlock’s cheeks, mirroring his own.
“But can you imagine… being with someone and always wondering: what if that other person hadn’t gone away? Would he still have chosen me?”
“You’re welcome,” she said.
Sherlock was slightly miffed that John was frowning and sounding annoyed. Perhaps he should not have brought up the injury. Yes, he was sure that, had it been someone else, John would not have brought it up. Part of him screamed that that was incredibly irrelevant and that a person was either shot or wasn’t and they’d better acknowledge the facts and move on. Sentimental traipsing around the topic wasn’t helping anyone.
Mycroft sighed. “No need to be like this, Sherlock. I wanted to inform you that as of this morning, I am officially on James Moriarty’s trail. We’ve traced one of his contacts. A plan has been formulated as to how to apprehend him.”
A most unnecessarily high, cheerful voice rang through the room and immediately grated on Sherlock’s nerves. A nurse he vaguely recognized came striding in backwards with a cart in tow. “Good morning,” she nodded brightly at Sherlock, then turned her attention to John. “And how are we today?”
). Sherlock gave him a small smile.
you weren’t serious. I
“People who love me?” Sherlock asked with a gentle smirk.
A sudden frustrated groan escaped his lips and he rubbed his hands over his face and rubbed them through his curls for what seemed the hundredth time that night. The image of John and him clung together underwater, sharing their breath, was seared into his brain, pushing away most other things. It was certainly the most intimate thing they’d ever done, and, come to think of it, the most intimate thing
“I mean… Obviously after the whole Chinese Circus thing I knew you were involved in dangerous affairs… but… wow. I had no idea this was such a regular thing with you.”
He had just picked up his jacket and stuffed the gun in the pocket when he heard the door. He froze. Through the open living room door he saw Sherlock’s lanky form ascending the stairs, taking two steps at a time. The man looked up from underneath his curly fringe and spotted John. His eyes travelled over him, taking in his state.
After a few moments, Sherlock stiffened. He looked over at John and narrowed his eyes. “You’re watching me.”
“I’d like to stay friends with you, too. You’re about the only person who has made me laugh recently.” He could tell that she really wanted to say,
The TV was still on, but John had turned the sound off as the next film began. He was picking at the remainder of their snacks and offered some to Sherlock, who began absently munching on a prawn cracker. He’d had another acceptable day, he mused, but something was off. Something had been bothering him all day and he couldn’t quite figure it...
However, as John neared the Holmes’ house again, a new sense of unease was waiting for him in the shape of a large, black Sedan. He walked through the garden gate and saw Sherlock conferring with Mycroft on the front step. Something about the image niggled at his brain. He knew something about it was off, but couldn’t put his finger on it.

simply talking to John at least once today.
She simply pushed away a pile of Sherlock’s things and plonked down on his (unused) bed. “So.”
“Only a matter of time, now.”
“Absolutely not.”
; his whole world had just been upended by a few choice deductions he was forced to make about himself. It would take time to think this through. But perhaps John needed a bit of reassurance at this point. He looked down again and smiled; for a moment, he dropped any kind of façade he might usually employ. He let John
Sherlock scoffed a laugh, but it was without humour. “You just feel the need to discuss it because you—you—“ he waved his hands. “You obviously haven’t been confronted with your bisexuality. Big deal. Perhaps you should think about it some more before we—“
So John had finally gotten to him last night; and with a bit of liquid courage on either side, their last remaining doubts had summarily been whisked away by an overwhelming longing.
“I do not!” Sherlock pulled himself up, indignant, but for some reason, John laughed even more at that.
“Well yes, it’s only a week or so away, isn’t it?” There was some humour in her voice now.
John was stepping closer, regarding him with a fond, yet almost pained expression. Sherlock took a moment to recognize it as
“Nope.”
It wasn’t until two hours later that Sherlock finally ushered their guests (in various states of inebriation) into taxis and Mrs Hudson downstairs to bed. John was lounging in his armchair half asleep, and Sherlock stood by the window, holding on to the only New Year’s tradition he stuck with; quietly playing
There was a short silence and he counted her breathing. “No dear… I don’t think you do,” she finally said, a smile in her voice. There was something that was different from usual, John noticed. She was usually teasing them – a lot, actually – but she was always playing their supposed relationship more as a joke. This time, it clearly wasn’t.
“Oh,” John grinned crookedly. “Don’t worry. Nothing like that. But you’ll be more comfortable.”
“Huh. I wonder what happened to the people who do live here,” John mused, studying the man in the garden. They sure did look convincing to the naked eye, he had to give Mycroft credit for that.
Greg cocked a smile and got up, shaking his head. Back to normal then. With a few exceptions, he thought, glancing at John. He gathered up the folder and his jacket and made for the door. When he was almost through the door, he held it open for a moment and looked back, unable to keep quiet one last thought.
John didn’t know what to say to that, really. Definitely uncharted territory, right there. After a moment’s silence, he managed, “to be honest with you, neither am I, right now.” And then he shivered some more and sniffed.
So he closed the distance between them and hugged her. It seemed like the right thing to do. “Stop it,” he said, and finally, feeling a little pathetic, he added, “I forgive you, okay?” It wasn’t really his place to forgive anything, he wasn’t even mad at her, how could he? But it seemed to help. He rubbed her back a little. Everything smelled of coffee.
Quietly, he snuck out from under the covers and stretched. It was still dark out, and he decided to leave the lights off to let John sleep more. Silly waste of time to sleep so much, really, he thought, but after the ordeal of the previous night, perhaps they’d earned it. Sherlock proceeded to take a long, hot shower, wondering if John would object being woken up in a fashion reminiscent of last night. He hoped he wouldn’t prefer to sleep even more. Surely that could wait.
John gathered his clothes for the day and went downstairs, faintly noticing that Sherlock was now engrossed at John’s laptop. John smiled, shook his head and headed to the bathroom for a long, hot bath.
John laughed. “Maybe,” he conceded and glanced at Sherlock, smiling at him fondly. “But perhaps we should make it worth your while.”
“Sherlock,” John whispered. “I think she’s telling the truth.”
“Seriously though, Sherlock, I would appreciate a little heads-up next time. We are working on the same case, are we not?”
Sherlock sighed like a condemned man and shrugged. “Suit yourself. But don’t say I didn’t warn you,” he added darkly.
Another laugh. “It might do you some good! But no, I meant that you underestimate Greg.”
John found himself studying the face reclining next to him and thinking back to some of Sarah’s words. He’d basically been willing to sacrifice himself for his friend, and you didn’t just do that for anyone, did you? In the army, there had been situations of course; but what he’d done there had been a doctor sacrificing things for Queen, country and his fellow soldiers. This time it was just John Watson making a decision. He wondered if Sherlock had guessed the true nature of what he’d told him.
,” he added a little quieter, slowly shaking his head. John was barely able to make out his eyes, but he sounded full of disbelief. “Why you would… I don’t really…” he broke off. Long fingers were rubbing soothing circles on John’s neck, and he let his eyes fall closed and just listened to Sherlock’s breathing. After a moment it helped slow his own down and he managed to feel more himself again.
“You’re quite fond of your brother, aren’t you?” Mary asked.
John shifted and caught Sherlock’s eye. And there it was again, that spark that seemed to ignite the veins and tendons throughout his body. And this time, John didn’t hesitate. He rolled over, his head still pillowed on one arm, the other hand gently carding into Sherlock’s hair. He leaned in and a moment later they were kissing again. There was a strength and intent behind it now that made Sherlock’s knees weak. He felt his thoughts derail and he let them, just feeling the need to keep going burn in his chest, letting that take over for a moment. It would just be for a little while… He pulled on John’s hips and kissed him back insistently. John shuddered as Sherlock’s fingers curled around his skin and took a sharp breath through his nose when their hips connected.
, and her, safe and sound and
“You feel sorry for Mr. Rodney. You wish that my deduction was wrong, that his girlfriend isn’t involved with anything criminal. But she is. I am right, and you will be disappointed.”
“I do so enjoy doing it,” John grinned back, butterflies in his stomach.
“Just me and Abby now,” he said.
John darted around the car to grab his bag from the trunk. He locked eyes with their stern-faced, government-issued driver, having beaten him to it. There was much John Watson was prepared to endure at Mycroft’s behest, but he didn’t like to be waited on like this. To his pride, the driver actually quirked a smile and simply nodded before heaving out Sherlock’s travel bag and carrying it to the house.
"John," Mary urged, ripping her arm free of his iron grip.
“Ah. And what about nursing?”
between them? Would it get worse? One could only imagine the horror that would be life in an actual relationship with John. Sherlock would constantly be distracted, forgetful, unobservant…
“And I knew—I
John had made a quick trip to the restrooms, and when he came back, he immediately ran into Sherlock. The detective was pressed up against the wall on the corner of the small corridor, clandestinely peering back to the main pub. He was sans his jacket, the top button of his shirt undone. For someone who was far beyond just being tipsy, he looked graceful as ever – at least if the situation hadn’t looked so ridiculous in the first place.
“How do you do it?” he asked.
is SO sweet!” This revelation apparently affected her so much she barely managed to stay upright.
“Technically, that was you,” she allowed. “But don’t bother. The hospitals there aren’t much more interesting. I’ll be fine in a few days anyway. If you could get me a laptop or something, that would be grand.”
. John sighed. “All right, have it your way.”
Greg smiled a little. “Yeah, I thought so, mate.”
“Mycroft’s got it covered,” Mary added rather hastily, her jaw set.
“Uh, thank you,” John mumbled. “That’s… good to know, I guess?” He sighed. “Actually, Sarah found out about me getting shot and I completely forgot to call her. So she heard it from a friend, a nurse at St. Bart’s. She was worried and… well it had completely slipped my mind. She came over to see how I was, and took the opportunity to sack me and dump me at the same time.” John had spoken quickly and closed his eyes, looking embarrassed.
“—uuh, excellent medical knowledge, I think you’ll find –“ John interrupted, raising one admonishing index finger, poking Sherlock in the chest.
Sherlock whirled around, an incredulous look on his face. “She manipulated you! Made a nice show of leaving you. She’s making sure she’s safe, and then all she’s got to do is deliver me back into Moran’s waiting hands. And everything will be back the way it should have been. Me out of the way, you, grieving and
“There was no motive behind her death,” Sherlock conceded with a nod. “There is now.”
Mycroft regarded him warily. Sherlock was impulsive. He needed to tread carefully with this. "As I said, he has begun to readjust to life without you. He's... seeing someone."
“Sherlock, I know you’re not drunk enough to really listen, but I’m gonna try anyway. A’right?”
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed. “This isn’t so bad. Stay like this.”
John vaguely noticed she was pulling off Sherlock’s shoes. Feeling embarrassed, John quickly kicked his own off by himself. His movement didn’t go entirely unnoticed; Sherlock murmured something inaudible and his hand gripped the front of John’s shirt. He pulled his legs up further to his body, sliding one leg over John’s, effectively catching John in an inescapable, Sherlock-shaped trap.
Mary was sitting on the couch, her feet propped up. She was dressed in practical black jeans and a dark jumper. Something that looked like combat gear was lying on the coffee table, amongst it a gun and a black beanie, casually tossed aside. Mary’s left arm was bleeding through her jumper, and she was holding it with her right. Her face was pale and sweat was pearling on her forehead. She hadn’t been here long, there hadn’t been time to patch herself up or for the blood to dry on her clothes.
“Never would have crossed my mind,” he said, and grinned happily at John.
John began stacking his load neatly by the wall and chuckled. “That’s what you get for doing physical labour on an empty stomach.”
Sherlock killed the lights and the car bounced over rocks and slid through mud as they advanced through the field. John gripped the handle over the door tightly with one hand, his seat with the other, staring into the darkness. He hoped Sherlock knew where they were going. “Oh God, why do I let you do this,” he said.
“Ooh,” he winced. “I’ve got to work on my superhero landing. I think I sprained my wrist there.”
Sherlock smiled. He probably should have told him before. “I’ve narrowed down Mrs Norbury’s possible properties to a few small towns in Cornwall. Every cross-check I do with something we know about her eliminates another location.”
“Where’s its owner?”
There was a beat. His chest was heaving and he didn’t dare look over. And then, John laughed. He laughed freely and sounded more amused and carefree than ever.
of Mrs Blanchard. There was definitely a story there, and he wondered if he would ever hear it.
you for something… is he?” He had no idea what was in that file on Mary, he realised. She’d probably done some fairly off-the-records things. She’d probably killed a few people. But then again, so had John.
She didn’t ask about the explosion. But she seemed to read his mind. “John?”
John looked back up, a smile tugging at his mouth. He cleared his throat again. “You know, I wasn’t fishing,” he met Sherlock’s eyes steadily. “But it sure is nice to hear you say these things. Thank you.”
“Most probably, yes.” Sherlock allowed another small smile. If they could re-bond over anything it must surely be this case.
Finally, John felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder. In the distance, he heard the sound of a helicopter. “They’re here.”
John frowned. The sudden honesty actually surprised him more than the impromptu bed-sharing. He turned to his side. He could barely see Sherlock’s face in the hints of streetlight from the window. “What about?” His voice was almost a whisper.
, John thought with a warm feeling. If he wasn’t such a mess and not so drunk, he’d probably have kissed her some more.
Mary’s face was grim. “Ajay thinks that I betrayed A.G.R.A. I’m pretty sure  he doesn’t know about any moles.”
John leaned back again, his head resting sideways on the pillow, and just listened. Sherlock was entirely in his element recounting Lestrade’s case and how he’d solved it. He described all the clues on the different photographs and in the statements to John in great detail, to the extent that John felt as if he’d been at the crime scene himself. It was mesmerizing.
Lestrade shook his head, bemused. “But—you’re in a public hospital! Surely somebody will have seen you by now?”
John returned their empty glasses and ordered three fresh pints. He realized that he couldn’t just keep buying drinks whenever he began feeling awkward or they’d be crawling home. As he was waiting to be served, he noticed two pretty girls standing next to him, having a hushed conversation. They were scantily dressed and cast their eyes over the patrons, clearly on the prowl. Suddenly, he caught snatches of their giggling tête-à-tête.
“I said, ‘very well’. Did the concussion affect your hearing?”
“What are you planning?” John found his own voice sounded a tad too curious and entertained by this. Not good.
Suddenly, search lights cut through the fog and moved over the car, blinding John, so he closed his eyes.
and all that bollocks his therapist told him to do. Unfortunately, now that his defences were down, Mary reduced him to a sobbing mess in minutes after she’d asked her question. Always resourceful, she pulled him into the next best bar, got a few strong drinks, and he told her everything.
He gave them a little bow, wished them happiness, and glided away like a dark, mysterious Cupid.
He spent some time exploring the corridors around the bathrooms. Ostentatiously, he was simply standing there with his phone, typing away, but surreptitiously he took note of where the emergency exits were, where people went for smokes, how the security teams behaved. Ricardo passed him a few times.
He wasn’t sure how long he remained sitting there, pondering. In the end, he gently lowered John to the cushions and covered him with a blanket. He hesitated for a moment, then lightly ran his fingers over John’s head. He allowed himself another long, pensieve look before he prodded away towards his bedroom.
“I wanted to see how he was,” Sherlock said, truthfully.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. He only has one mistress, and she can’t have any—“
“What?”
“My goons did a pretty good job protecting you back in Serbia, I remind you.”
“Something on your mind?” John glanced up.
Sherlock went back inside. “Meddlesome snake,” he muttered.
“John.” Mummy was the first to find her voice. “Even if you weren’t a doctor, we hope you know how much it means to us that you… that there’s someone.”
However, Sherlock did not oblige him this time. “Do you like dogs then?” he asked.
The laptop rested on the sofa table before him. “Ah,” said Mycroft.
a case. You might be the only one.”
“Well?” Sherlock managed, narrowing his eyes back at Mycroft.
“Well done,” rumbled Sherlock’s voice against his chest. “I told you, you’re good at this.”
. But as soon as he’d approached Sherlock in the shed, the infuriating man had bolted. At this point, frantic longing and frustration were warring in John’s chest for dominance.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair, looking surprised. Hardly anyone ever asked him that, Lestrade mused. Perhaps John did. Usually, he’d bite someone’s head off for it. “What’s the matter with what?” he asked, sounding a little irritated.
“Any news?”
John put his cup down on the bedside table and studied his face a moment. Was this Sherlock being
Sherlock tilted his head. “I think she was the one who ordered the extraction mission in Tbilisi. That doesn’t mean she sabotaged it as well.”
idiot to not have tried this before.
“John Watson,” the man beamed at him and gripped his hand tightly. “Don’t worry, Mr. Holmes told me you were coming as well. So good to meet you, Dr Watson. And please call me Freddy. I love your blog.”
Mycroft inclined his head. “You’ve just answered your own question. I am not that cruel.”
Sherlock searched his face, his eyes twinkling. “Oh, there’s no need to tell you. You figured it all out with your
“Vivian!” Lady Smallwood looked genuinely amused. “No!”
He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and shoved the memory away. He was beginning to get better at it. However, as he finally finished his beer, Harry looked at him with concern again. “John, you need to—“ she broke off.
John blinked. A hundred questions immediately sprung to mind, but all he managed was a hushed “Mary, what the hell?”
Lestrade had approached the room warily, as if afraid Sherlock might bite him, and then shown surprise and amusement that he had let a nurse treat him without biting
“Injured, but alive. They’re on their way to the hospital, sir.”
Helen gave a little watery laugh, still sounding weak. He held out his hand. “Come on, I think the police must be here by now. We should talk this all over and we’ll figure something out, yeah?”
Sherlock nodded. He closed his eyes and began drawing forth the details he’d collected.
Sherlock sighed. The jazz song came to a halt and the CD stopped playing. There was a shaky breath in the silence. “But why now,” Sherlock whispered, sounding miserable and worried.
, what a waste of time.
Pre-Christmas days spent with the Holmes Family
!) after she learned a brief, edited version of what had happened. Sherlock’s parents had shown up as well and brought their things from the house (John finally charged his phone) and fussed over them some more; Margaret in particular picked up on the changed nature of their relationship rather quickly and seemed pretty chuffed about it, winking and smirking at John whenever she got the chance. Richard shook John’s hand with both of his and told him a quiet thanks, something that warmed John to his core.
A sudden throb of pain went through him. He’d had to concede a while ago that these somewhat distracting feelings for his flatmate existed and had put them on a shelf for further study. A puzzle to work on in time. Now he was out of time. Somehow, this upset him more than he would have admitted.
“Observing,” Sherlock pointed out.
He saw the same and more in his eyes now. And suddenly, there was only one answer to quiet the confusion in his mind.
“Hm?” Sherlock found he was still studying John’s eyes, not sure how to get out of the conversation – or the room.
After sitting with John for a while – thankfully without any annoying small talk – Sherlock reluctantly stepped out to find some actually drinkable coffee somewhere in the hospital. When he returned, he heard a new voice in the room. As he came closer, he realised it was DI Lestrade talking to Mary. Sherlock was surprised to find a small flutter go through his chest, but couldn’t quite place the feeling. He wondered what Lestrade’s position was currently; had he gotten into trouble over that whole Moriarty business six months ago? He had never bothered to ask Mycroft about that, preoccupied as he was with the whole John situation.
Sherlock frowned a little, and John could see him processing it. “You… were insecure because I didn’t say anything?”
Now Sherlock was the one to laugh. As if Mycroft would be able to stop them from leaving if they felt like it. “What are you going to do, defend us with your little sword if Moran comes looking?”
Strangely, the most unnerving detail of all was that John was close enough to Sherlock to smell his unique and weirdly specific scent; a mixture of freshly laundered shirts, bow rosin and chemicals. He smelled of home and safety and excitement and it was absolutely irresistible. John felt like a fly caught in a very personalised flytrap.
John shifted uncomfortably. Wouldn’t this be a perfect chance to tell him about the break-up? Why was it so hard? Sherlock hardly cared why, right?
When they arrived in Greenwich, as John had predicted, Sherlock immediately went ahead with being himself. He jumped out of the car without a word and strode towards the house. Luckily, Lestrade met them on the curb.
Sherlock shrugged. “Got a bit dizzy. My doctor tells me I shouldn’t have skipped breakfast.” Even as he said it almost automatically, Sherlock felt a smile steal onto his face when he thought
“Yes,” Mary mused. “I think you’re right.”
The light of the fire flickered and shimmered on Sherlock’s cheeks and was reflected in his eyes. The doctor’s trained eye recognized exhaustion following near-drowning, cheeks flushed with the effort of dragging John, and compromised breathing, but no apparent further injuries. His strained face was wet and sooty, dark curls flattened against his forehead. John felt a stab of pride and fondness for his friend. They’d gotten each other out of there, and Sherlock was very much alive. That was good. His eyes locked onto John’s and he was slightly surprised to note that he’d never seen Sherlock looking so worried.
“And how do
I don't know what to say except... thank you all for the wait and the lovely reviews so far. Here's a little something soft and some much-needed feels for you, you're welcome <3
you to be right. But I think you are,” he said. He didn’t want to talk about it, but he had to at least be honest.
Okay, thank you for your time. Now, on with the story.
John, he had to acknowledge, was about the only thing he couldn’t really work out, and so he had put everything to do with John aside for a while, in its own little room, and never looked at it. Perhaps he did look a lot more during his exile; whenever he felt particularly homesick. There was something so
“At what?”
, he thought, but then Sherlock’s hand wandered upwards and he threaded his fingers into John’s hair. “But you were here, and somehow you talked her out of it,” he commented, sounding pleased. “Jim Moriarty continues to underestimate John Watson.” Sherlock sounded incredibly proud at that, as if John was something he had that Moriarty didn’t. And John supposed, well, that was kind of the truth. He felt a pleasant flush creep into his cheeks at the praise, bringing him back to his senses a little.
“Down!” Mary cried and Sherlock saw her bolting towards him, changing direction in the second it took Moran to shoot. Another loud crack split the air around them, the sound immediately swallowed by the thick fog.
She placed a hand softly on his other arm. “How are you feeling?”
In one brief glance, John felt as if his stomach had decided to ignore gravity today and a warmth rose through his chest and neck all the way to his face. He quickly made sure his mouth was clamped shut, as staring slack-jawed at Sherlock was surely a bit not good.
“I would never!” Sherlock exclaimed, scandalized, and dragged John along with him, arm still around his shoulder.
He shrugged and smiled. “Suit yourself,” he said as casually as he could and climbed into bed. Sherlock was sitting at the foot, his back against the wall, his legs propped up. John wriggled a little to get the blanket free of its current occupant and squeezed his legs past Sherlock’s lanky form.
"He is... coping. I believe," Mycroft said, carefully sitting down on a rickety wooden chair. The tiny shed did not offer much in the way of amenities, but it worked as a safe hiding spot for Sherlock for now. He’d been here for several days, and Mycroft felt a little relieved to see empty food cans on a counter; at least his brother was not sulking himself into starvation.
“Well, you’ll get what’s coming to you now, the both of you.”
“What? Peaceful retirement in Hampshire, you told me – and here we are. I’m not missing this for the world.” John thought it sounded rather as if he had simply been invited over for Christmas by the Holmes family – he wished it was true, and the circumstances less dire.
Sherlock raised his arm lazily towards the street in front of Scotland Yard and got into the first taxi that materialized at the curb. He told the driver to wait a moment so that John could catch up. Sherlock scooted through to the next seat and watched as John almost ran down the steps. He quirked a smile. He felt curiously weightless again. Happy. He’d enjoyed watching John deduce. And the look of satisfaction on his face was definitely worth foregoing the bragging on his part this time.
“That he is, too,” Sherlock replied truthfully. “Too good for me certainly, but he doesn’t want to admit it to himself”, he added, then grabbed a few biscuits from a plate (the ones that John had helped make), gave his father a nod and wandered on before he could reply. John would probably come in soon, so Sherlock kept on his coat and went out the front door. To his surprise, he found Mycroft there, standing on the path, looking out over the meadow. He had his back to him, but the small stream of smoke rising over his shoulder could still be seen from the door.
Sherlock was close, holding on to him with one arm as they broke the surface. The detective managed to pull in a rasping breath before his eyes went wide, glancing up. John was about to turn around to see what his friend had seen, but before he could take a second breath, he felt Sherlock’s arm tighten around his torso and another arm push him under again.
John pouted a little. “There aren’t always fireworks, are there. And I do have a concussion,” he felt the need to point out.
The long coat settled on Sherlock's shoulders with its reassuring weight, and for the first time, he felt like he was really back. Their private plane had taken them back to London two days ago, yet Sherlock had been confined to Mycroft’s bloody club since then ‘for security reasons’. Mycroft’s impeccable assistant had seen to it that he was clothed and fed and had everything he needed, except that had yet to return to 221B Baker Street. He had thought it best if he didn’t show up there looking like an emaciated homeless person, shocking John even more than necessary.
“Why?” Sherlock was truly at a loss.
She ground her teeth together and nodded. He gently rolled her shoulders forward. “Help me,” he told Sherlock, who knelt by her legs. Together, they managed to get her on her uninjured side, lying on the jacket.
All the way back to Baker Street, still fighting his body into submission, he couldn’t stop thinking that Harry had never been more wrong about anything in her life.
And then there was Sherlock himself. The facts were laid out in front of him: The warmth that flooded his chest when John said something kind or flattering. The way his thinking got clouded and confused whenever John was concerned. The fear he had felt when John was injured. The guilt he still felt over not telling him that he was alive, knowing how much it affected him.
John gave a dry chuckle. “That’s right,” he confirmed.
sense whatsoever.
?” He laughed a little, and Sherlock could see the laugh lines beside his eyes, revelled in the mirth he saw in the dark blue irises, drinking it in.
“I guess,” she sniffled.
Sherlock put his phone away and turned a little, regarding John with a narrowed glance. He was stubborn as ever. But had he always been so insistent when Sherlock was avoiding his questions? His voice was steadier than he remembered, something of the
Sherlock’s eyes were riveted to John’s face. He didn't pay too much attention to the conversations between Mary and Mycroft beside him, but they seemed to be coming to certain agreements. The injured man was transferred to an ambulance, his companion was held by the police. Sherlock remained by John's side, uninterested in anything else. He reluctantly shrugged out of his long coat when it became clear that John wasn't letting go of it any time soon, even whilst mostly unconscious. He also insisted on riding with him in the ambulance, leaving Mycroft's team to clean up behind them and to handle whatever he was planning to do about Mary. Her eyes followed him as he jumped into the ambulance, still frowning in shock. She stood there in her glaringly red coat, looking like she wanted to say something. But the ambulance left before she did.
“Yes, thank you I’d grasped the lesson,” Sherlock snapped, somehow irritated that he’d come to the same, boring conclusion. He stepped over to the sink in the room and quickly washed the blood of his hands.
John’s eyes widened. The medical part of his brain immediately recognized this as a viable solution. The rest of it saw fit to shorten out. Yet there was no time to think about it. They needed to breathe. So they could either risk the firey debris and smoke on the surface, they could drown, or they could try to share their air as long as they managed, buying some time. He nodded.
“True.”
John spoke slowly now. “Sarah heard from her friend that someone who sounded a lot like me – being watched over by someone who sounded a lot like you – was in hospital, after barely surviving being shot. She was worried about me. I’d called in sick at work but of course I hadn’t actually informed them what happened. She’d tried to call me twice and sent a text and I still hadn’t replied, so she was shocked to find out it had actually been me in the hospital. She must have thought her friend was mistaken.” John took a deep breath. “I think the implication is that if I’d been serious about her, I would have called her at once. Therefore that influenced her decision to stop dating.”
“Night,” Sherlock said. He looked through his microscope again, listening to John’s steps fading on the stairs. At some point he blinked; he didn’t know how long it took him to see that he’d forgotten to put the next slide in.
. I know how I feel about you, goddammit, and nothing you can say will make me think otherwise!” His anger was bubbling dangerously close to the surface now.
Sherlock went to retrieve his coat from their stakeout spot. He was glad to have at least one dry piece of clothing. When he came back to the police scene, he spotted John sitting on the back of an ambulance. He had taken off his soaked jumper and t-shirt and had one of those odious orange blankets thrown over his shoulders. He was answering questions from a paramedic who was checking his lungs with a stethoscope. For a moment, Sherlock just stood there, watching, letting his brain process and catch up with the last few hours.
John felt a lot better the next day. His dizziness had dissipated completely and apart from a bit of tenderness where his head had collided with the wall and a mild headache, he felt okay. He lay in bed, his mind slowly rummaging through the conversation of the night before. He had said a few things that perhaps ought to have remained unsaid, but he had been tired and on painkillers and pretty damn emotional so it seemed good to say them at the time. Sherlock had certainly shown more openness than ever before and that was weird enough; so John guessed he was entitled to his own confessions. Their friendship at least seemed to be able to handle it, even after six months.
didn’t know. And he didn’t care enough to ask again.
John managed to get up. “You too. Merry Christmas. And keep an eye on Mycroft.”
, how tedious;
The man turned half-way, acknowledging him with a smile. John was startled, for a moment, because that was Sherlock’s smile he saw, though mellowed with age and full of kindness. “It’s good to see somebody real,” he said, his deep voice crinkled with amusement. He peered out of the window again.
“Spying on someone?” John sidled up to him, grinning.
Sherlock swallowed. “Cleverer than he looks,” he allowed himself a small smirk.
Sherlock wanted to tell him that he never looked at his own back and didn’t care. He wanted to tell him to stop talking and start kissing. He wanted to slap himself for even suggesting that to himself. He wanted John to stop looking at him like he hoped to look at Sherlock’s back more often in the future. He never wanted John to look at him like that.
“Sherlock,” he called out as he came walking across the lawn, rubbing his gloved hands together. “You got some time to help me?”
“Well,” Sherlock bristled and put his tea down with more force than was necessary. He looked away. “You have been on six dates with Mary so far, and yet you still haven’t... It never usually takes you this long.”
Hours later, John was now peacefully sleeping off his injuries instead of being unconscious, and Sherlock was still by his side, watching his favourite face become less strained over time.
John got up and moved to his armchair, drank his tea, and decided that for now he’d simply listen to the sounds that suddenly filled the flat again.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and winced as Moran strapped his wrists together. “As tiresome as killing a good civil servant like Mr Blanchard just on the off-chance he might remember a bunch of tapes he watched five years ago? Turning another woman into a widow?”
; so what was it about her that you
Sherlock’s voice was quiet when he spoke. “My mother’s family was quite…
Sherlock suddenly moved, rummaging in his coat pocket. It was dark, they hadn’t encountered many cars at this time of night, and he was only illuminated by the instruments on the dashboard that cast an otherworldly orange-blue glow on his face and hands. Finally, there was a rustling sound and Sherlock, without looking, held out a small parcel of some kind to John. John took it and raised his eyebrows. Sherlock glanced over and caught his eye with a tentative smile. Somehow, that small contact sent a tendril of warmth down John’s spine and helped loosen his tensed shoulders.
, judging from Sherlock’s expression.
“No, just… the bees,” Sherlock repeated, feeling a little put upon.
John let him. In fact, John hadn’t so much as approached him all day; a feat of great personal willpower if the longing looks he sent Sherlock were any indication. It was somewhat distracting, but Sherlock was glad that he kept himself back. It would be even more distracting to fully occupy himself with the recent changes in their relationship. He had to stay on track. It was probably for the best if he kept his distance a little until all of this was over. He ignored the uncomfortable feeling that thought suddenly produced in his belly.
He stared at the bed some more, trying to make up his mind. There was another bed, of course. But it was cold and uninviting in comparison. John was smaller and didn’t need that much space. A soft feeling rushed through his stomach as he contemplated how fond he was of his friend’s general proportions. Absurd notion. What had his friend’s body type (
John swallowed. “All the same, I wish I could take it back.”
“Don’t need one,” Sherlock gave an exaggerated shrug, which nearly drove them off course again. With a quick pull on his arm, John steered them out of the path of an oncoming lamp post.
“Yes, well, I just had a feeling you were about to deduce his 3 mistresses and 15 illegitimate children and get us thrown out before we even had a toast.”
, Sherlock thought. He pressed his lips together in determination. And decided to stop agonizing about their relationship for now. First, he had to get his John back.
“You make me sound like a voyeur,” Mycroft bristled a little, one eyebrow raising a fraction.
“Yes, I know,” Sherlock said quietly.
. “What about the auction house,” he asked. “Hasn’t she been in for work?” John noticed that Sherlock gave him a look, but he ignored it for now.
His mind became a broad wall of white noise. John was
care before. About… you know. Another person,” she said quietly, before she could stop herself. When John looked back at her, her face relaxed a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
However, John started awake again and managed to pull himself up a little. His head rolled sideways and he looked up at Sherlock, smiling stupidly. Sherlock felt absurdly fond of his blogger that very moment. He gently nudged John’s head with his nose. “Come on.”
John felt a bit of anger bubbling up. “No, she’s not.”
, Helen.” Freddy looked at his lap, embarrassed. “I inherited this house and some money, and I have a good job. I am reasonably well off and could easily provide for the two of us. The house is too big for me, and she lives in such a small flat.” His hands began fidgeting nervously as he looked up at John. “We even discussed children and I told her that I didn’t expect her to turn into a housewife. She could keep her job; I’d have no problems staying at home for a while myself. It’s all
“Well, she doesn’t seem to have heard it before,” John remarked, seeing how the blonde sergeant giggled.
A touchy subject
“Mary,” he said.
John was still smiling as they put on their jackets, a warm happiness in his chest. He was following Sherlock down the stairs when finally, what Sherlock said finally properly registered in John’s mind, and he found himself smiling even more during the entire taxi ride to the fundraiser.
He was interrupted by a friendly, gruff voice from down the corridor. “Looking for a fix?”
“Where are we going?”
“Somewhere in France.”
He remembered the conversation he’d had that afternoon with Mycroft. He’d moved his things to Sherlock’s room, awkwardly making a space for himself, placing some toiletries on the dresser next to Sherlock’s things.
“Investigating, of course,” Sherlock said with a flash of determination in his eyes.
Sherlock turned on the car and cranked up the heating. Tepid air began slowly seeping into them from the vents. Mary was shivering and the air took way too long to warm up. “Hang in there,” John whispered.
“I understand,” he said slowly, but with emphasis. “I do. Mycroft was right. I hate it, and I wish he wasn’t, but that doesn’t change the facts. Nobody was… as close to you as I was.” John tried not to put too much emphasis on the past tense. “If anyone looked… they would have seen what—well, what they saw.” He looked at the dying embers of their fire for a moment. “Did it work, at least?” he asked quietly.
Sherlock pulled away a little to turn and look at him. John released his iron grip, keeping his arms around his lanky friend. “Are you sure
something to make sure this was not just a one-off, a drunken joke... The memory was all too blurry and marred by fuzzy inebriation to be very reassuring as to what it
“Oh God,” John murmured, catching his breath. “We’re actually breaking into MI5, aren’t we?”
Suddenly, two, then three red stains began blooming on Moran’s chest, one just over his heart. His eyes went wide and he half-turned, then staggered and slumped with a heavy thud into the dead leaves.
He held Sherlock back before he could leave the car. “Sherlock, wait a moment. Who else knows?”
He was satisfied to see that that shut him up. Sherlock began pacing again, as much as the space allowed. Finally, he stopped, turned, and gave Mycroft another searching glare. And then, to Mycroft’s immense relief, he dropped the subject. He would have hated to spell it out for him, and he feared that if he did, Sherlock would refuse to go back simply to be
“No thank you, that’s quite all right,” Sherlock answered in the same voice and immediately turned away, as to not show familiarity. He suspected that Mycroft was doing his own reconnaissance as usual on functions of this kind. Ricardo was probably there to work for more than one reason. He left to do his rounds and Sherlock quickly slipped the small key card Ricardo had passed him into his pocket. He toasted John and they had a sip of their drinks. “We’ll have to wait until after dinner. During the dancing it will be much easier to slip away.”
He still felt the impact of the words long after they were said. For the rest of the drive, he replayed the conversation and he finally decided that it hadn’t sounded like an ending. He allowed himself to hope, once again, that maybe this whole
John was warm and soft and strangely familiar, as if they’d been doing this forever. An involuntary sigh escaped his nose and with that, the hand around his back tightened its hold. John kissed him back carefully, not too insistent; but his fingers curled into the fabric of Sherlock’s jacket, holding on with a certain desperation. Sherlock was drowning in it. John smelled of home and antiseptic, of danger and gunpowder, and he tried to catalogue the sensations of this scent enveloping him, of moving lips, breath, skin, yielding, pressing, slowly taking—but they were soon pattering on his mind like rain, quieting his thoughts.
his brain volunteered helpfully) to do with anything? He scoffed again but made up his mind.
. He dreaded to think what his own face was betraying to John. His heart hammered in his chest and heat rose to his cheeks.
Mycroft frowned. He looked back at his previous message. What the hell was Sherlock on about now? He put the phone down, rolling his eyes at it. He was not going to play cat and mouse with Sherlock again today, he simply didn’t have the time. So he refused to take the bait and ignored the telly.
Sherlock smirked evilly. “Third cup already, Lestrade? I thought you slept enough last night. Or were the tables at the King’s Head not to your liking?”
“Oh, all right, but if you make her cry, you’re out.”
he expected at least some of the oxytocin and endorphins to get through to him.
Sherlock let out a shuddering breath, and then glanced at John again. The man in his arms greeted him with an endearing smile. “Good morning.” His voice was hushed, rough from sleep.
. What a goddamn awful life you lead,
“Yes, well. I don’t usually socialize.”
. It was very unlike Sherlock, and it brought back unpleasant memories. A shiver went through John. He was silent. Then he spoke, his voice controlled, quietly. “No it wouldn’t. That’s no longer good enough, Sherlock.”
Sherlock waited, really patiently he felt, but nothing more was forthcoming, which irritated him a little. “So then why?”
, messing with his head.
“Five.” Sherlock finally spoke, his voice utterly detached and clipped. “Five people know. The fifth person who knows… he shot you.”
Another text followed with the precise address. Sherlock tossed John his jacket. “And you’d think he’d be pleased to be working with us again,” he said, sounding offended.
The smirk had now slipped off Mary’s face entirely. “Freelancing is what got me into this mess. I’ve had enough of it.”
And Sherlock, so determined never to let feelings interfere, had gotten attached right back. Suddenly, all of the small, unimportant moments of the last few weeks just came together, one after the other, into a big, inevitable puzzle. Sherlock wasn’t quite sure what the final picture would be yet, but he’d seen glimpses of it. But there was John, who had gone from merely tolerating him to kissing him to making him wild with his
John raised an eyebrow. “Well, what do you…” he trailed off, at a loss. Was there a need?
John was halfway up the stairs, and Sherlock followed in a daze, feeling as if someone had doused him in ice water. He couldn’t begin to process how close he had been to completely ruining
, but thanks for letting me back in on the action.”
he thought. He usually never fell asleep if he could help it.
Sherlock frowned. That was not at all...
John turned tail and fled into the kitchen. He put the kettle on and busied himself with mugs and teabags for a moment, trying to regain a sense of calm. He slammed the sugar pot down on the counter with a little too much vigour and the clattering noise startled him.
She smiled and placed a hand on his thigh. “Yes, it is good,” she agreed. “It wasn’t the same without you.” She paused. “
Sherlock looked away for a moment. “There’s probably something you should know,” he began. “On the last morning in the hospital, my brother paid us a visit.” John’s mind went back to the scene in his head and his ears flushed with heat as he remembered the position he’d woken up in. Had Mycroft seen that?
John (reluctantly) disentangled himself from Sherlock’s arms. He turned his back to the door to see better in the orange glow of the street light. He patted his jacket for his keys even as he suddenly felt something imperceptibly shift in the air. Faster than he had any right to be, Sherlock stepped closer and gently pinned John against the door. His fumbling hands froze. Sherlock leaned over him, one arm outstretched past John’s head, steadying himself on the door. He tried to take a breath, but his lungs no longer cooperated.
“Not at all,” Sherlock said. “I assure you, I’ve never had to put more effort into something in my life.”
Just when John was about to take a deep dive into uncharted waters and ask exactly what kind of
Sherlock dragged and pulled and kicked his feet with abandon, trying to reach the surface. He hadn’t thought where they were standing, he had only seen John and a gun levelled straight at his chest and something had simply shortened out in his brain; and now they were under the sodding water
. He raised an eyebrow at her and clicked his tongue. “Apparently so.”
John pressed his lips together, studying him from the side. Sherlock had to suppress a laugh; it was rather endearing how obviously strained John looked when he tried to work something out.
“John, I know you were…. But he was only a friend, right?” she said quietly, with a worried, somewhat frightened half-smile, like someone bringing up a painful truth that nobody wanted to talk about. And under different circumstances, John would have laughed. Trust his bloody sister to be the only person who got it right and didn’t assume they’d been a couple.
John Watson sat in his chair, his bare feet curled into the carpet, lost to his thoughts. He stared unblinking out of the window. The summer heat of the day was finally fading, the sun had long dipped behind the tall London buildings. John had no idea how long he had been sitting still. He hadn’t yet bothered to turn on the light, so he sat in the slowly growing darkness, staring at the empty chair in front of him. The silence in the flat pressed heavily on his ears.
“Sherlock—“ John began, but was once again cut out of the conversation.
Sherlock’s report was quick and to the point. He informed him of at least two more bodies in the garden shed, handed over Mary’s A.G.R.A. stick without a single word and then seemed to want nothing more to do with the whole thing. He was a little pale. Somehow, the ordeal of that night, or perhaps something else, had really shaken him. Mycroft decided to leave the gloating for another day.
– everyone would be safe –
. But he didn’t seem like he regretted it. Rather the opposite, thankfully. Just thinking about the few kisses John could coherently remember made him feel warm and happy. He couldn’t wait to repeat that entire night with zero alcohol in him and all his faculties focussed on Sherlock.
“Has it occurred to you that John did it because he likes you? I believe he considers you his best friend,” Lestrade began cautiously.
. It’s somewhat amusing how in awe your poor Doctor is with it. Doesn’t exactly reassure me of the average intellect of our nation’s doctors. I find your so-called
Sherlock gave that some thought. He guessed she had a point.
!” His voice had become forced.
John let out a breath. “For a while there I forgot that the media circus around your return was only a week or so ago,” he said to Sherlock, who shrugged.
He knew they couldn’t get out before the guard passed the door. They were flat against the wall behind the cabinet, and would be entirely obscured by the door if it opened. They stood motionless, Sherlock holding on to John’s wrist, and they listened to the footsteps coming closer.
John smiled in surprise, feeling pleased. “Uh, thank you. And it’s John,” he added amicably. At least someone today was polite and normal, he thought. It made for a relaxing change.
“He helped,” Sherlock merely said, and John thought he looked a bit miffed that his own substantial intellect, which no doubt had contributed a lot to whatever crazy plan they had pulled, was so belittled. John dangled his legs over the side of the bed and tried to determine whether he was still feeling dizzy.
Sherlock remembered their conversation from the hospital. He couldn’t get over his first mistake; she was a very, very good liar. She could have told them –
Mycroft gave him a look that effectively shut him up even though he didn’t even know what Mycroft was trying to tell him. All he knew was that he felt like a clueless parent and Sherlock was the child that was being got to a nice place for Christmas by a clever application of reverse psychology. It was bewildering in the extreme, being looked at by Mycroft as if they were on the same level. The level where they both had somehow been landed with the responsibility of caring for Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock was on his laptop, idly listening in on their conversations as he worked. He didn’t anticipate the break-through when it came. Father was telling John and Mary about the time when they bought their house; it was one of those generally safe subjects to discuss. They’d already told all the embarrassing childhood stories, Father had mildly quizzed John about the army and his (and Mary’s) surgery and politely inquired about them working on cases again. And now houses. Sherlock had vaguely noted that both John and Mary looked a little bored, but were too polite to say so. Sherlock had never had such qualms.
Mycroft gave him an almost fond smile. “Just… think about it.” He huffed a laugh. “Seeing as it’s Christmas?”
Mary steadied herself as she turned towards the bed. She let her shoulders slump a bit; she had been standing straight when talking to Sherlock, alert and watchful. Now was reverting back to being
The next day, John woke up and took some time to simply process things. He was still not due back at the clinic; he was supposed to recuperate after the concussion for the rest of the week. And seeing as the previous day didn’t really qualify as ‘recuperating’, he decided to just stay in bed for a bit.
“John,” he said.
. There was a certain air of expectancy. John knew that, from where they were, they would eventually end up at Baker Street if he steered them there, and Mary seemed to be not uninterested in joining him for a nightcap. She could also call a cab, of course, and invite him over. Or he could simply say goodnight after she’d walked him home.
,” Sherlock mumbled, before he leaned in.
Suddenly, his eyes widened a bit, and Sherlock wondered what was
“So what happened tonight?” Sherlock asked quietly. John assumed he already knew.
Greg stepped forward and instantly understood the slightly knowing look on the other man’s face.
It was the same question he’d asked two weeks ago, his wrists still bloodied from the chains, his back hastily covered in bandages.
John grinned. “Beekeeping terms! You got me at a disadvantage there, Richard.”
But John simply smiled, ate his croissant and didn’t say anything, and Sherlock was profoundly grateful. For a few minutes, they simply shared the same space, looked out into the garden and had breakfast. Finally, John grabbed his empty plate and turned in the direction of the dishwasher. He took a step towards Sherlock, to move past him, but then paused; he leaned a bit closer and said, “one step at a time, yes?”
Sherlock began pouring the tea. When he was finished, he brought the tea in, put their cups on the sofa table and settled with his own in his armchair, watching John perform delicate stiches on Mary’s wound. Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on John. His brain was still stuck on an endless loop of
John shook his head sadly. “He doesn’t know that. And I mean, he was unhappy before. You usually deduce everything about everyone; didn’t you see what kind of a man he was? I met quite a few unhappy ones like him in the army. He wanted to
“Okay, possessiveness, I get that,” Sherlock huffed with a little laugh. Suddenly, he gripped John around the waist, deftly hooked one of his legs around him and flipped them over. John grinned, absolutely captivated by the sudden glint in Sherlock’s pale eyes.
“Once, he basically suggested I should take a date to this circus, simply because it was a lead in a case. We got kidnapped,” he added, with an eye-roll. It seemed like ages ago.
“So have you two… talked?” she asked.
“So glad you worked out your differences,” someone said from the doorway. John’s head snapped up to follow the voice; it sounded like a kind, older woman, yet it was laced with icy steel.
He gently tilted his head to deepen the kiss, and Sherlock seemed to instinctively understand. His head turned the other way so their lips slotted together even more snugly. John felt Sherlock’s mouth give under his, lips sliding against each other boldly and it set John’s nerve endings on fire. Sherlock suddenly let out a quiet little moan in his throat and the sound went straight to John’s groin. He took a deep breath and broke the kiss, panting heavily as he leaned his forehead to Sherlock’s.
For the first time since the previous night, John allowed himself to really
Sherlock stood by the window for a while after that, staring out at the people on the streets. His thoughts turned round and round, trying to figure out the case that wasn’t really a case yet—his return and John being in trouble somehow had turned into this new situation. Instinctively, Sherlock knew there was no going back to how things way before, no matter what happened next.
Sherlock got out of the car and John followed. He noticed that, standing on the pavement, he was subconsciously straightening, bracing himself.  He waited as Sherlock told the driver to go. He said he didn’t know how long they’d be. The air was cold, and some of the morning’s sunshine was now hidden behind thick clouds. The car drove away.
“Rupal, Naresh.”
“Why?”
“No need.” Sherlock gave a slight wave of the hand and then cocked his head. John recognized his ‘deduction’ face. The widow remained more poised under his glare than most people would. “You were used to him coming home and leaving his work at the office. You never discussed what he does, because you both knew it was safer that way. You took pride in being married to a civil servant – but you are happily employed in a different field, no, wait, don’t tell me,” he glanced at the bookshelves, then back at her. “I’m thinking university professor, something scientific like biology or chemistry. I recognize a kindred spirit.” His lips quirked in a genuine smile for a moment.
Sherlock sat down on the side of the bed, facing his friend. John raised his hand, letting it rest heavily on Sherlock’s shoulder; for a moment, they just looked at each other. And then John’s face slowly changed, his features hardened, his eyes boring like fire into Sherlock. His jaw tensed and he inhaled a sharp breath.
“I’m afraid not.” Mycroft smiled politely. “Do enjoy your evening,” he said glibly, and didn’t that sound suggestive as hell when he accompanied it with
“Oh,” he said, and cleared his throat. “Good. That’s good.”
“So, an exciting night then,” John said, wiggling his eyebrows, and then he yawned. “I’m going to bed, my head is still a bit woozy. Good night.”
They managed to get into Thames House without trouble, their names having correctly been added to the guest list. Past the large stony gates of the huge building, they entered a fancy foyer filled with bar tables. The entrance hall of the headquarters had been transformed into a reception area, and waiters were mingling between the small groups, handing out drinks. Everything was decked out in tasteful Christmas decorations, with golden and silver candle holders and the occasional holly twig. In the background, faint classical Christmas music was playing.
In addition, Sherlock had deduced that John was embarrassed; either because he was entrapped in an outdated and impractical understanding of sexual orientation (so restrictive, really) or because he felt uncomfortable about being so obviously affected. Sherlock had often noted that people did not like to be seen as obvious, even though they always were.
The detective was leaning against the counter, one hand on the countertop, the other on his hip. He must have literally sneaked up on John. “Unlikely,” he said, a smirk curling on his lips. His voice seemed to have dropped even lower than usual. “Alright?”
But he had no time to process that thought.
“Why aren’t you telling me what you really think?” she asked. “I mean, you’re not an idiot and you’ve dated other women.” She shrugged. “Also I have a thing for blunt honesty. Come on, I can tell you’ve been thinking about this, too.”
“Good,” she said, and seemed to take his cue. “Fancy getting a late snack and a pint somewhere?”
“No, they can’t,” Mycroft sighed. “However, I have discussed the situation, and it is clear you can’t stay here indefinitely. There are too many people here, it’s too risky; and we can’t keep you locked up forever,” he said with a deliberate nod to John.
Sherlock's eyebrow quirked upwards. "Sherlock Holmes," he said and shook her hand. His eyes flitted over her face and posture, taking in all the little details. He catalogued her smile, her eyes, her hair, the quirk of her lips – and came to the startling conclusion that, all things considered, she seemed
John nibbled on his croissant and Sherlock had to force himself not to look at John’s lips. The last time he’d felt so preoccupied with something that wasn’t a case, it had come in a syringe.
Sherlock looked at him, narrowing his eyes. After a moment, he nodded.
?” Sherlock barely whispered into Mary’s ear. She hesitated, then shook her head. Sherlock nodded. Moran wasn’t going anywhere. Much better to let their backup handle this.
“The best,” he grinned and, feeling positively buoyant, gave Mrs Hudson a peck on the other cheek. She laughed and swatted at him as he quickly followed Sherlock out the door.
Lestrade was staring at him with a slightly slack-jawed, completely amused expression. He was half smiling half gaping, and his eyes travelled up and down John, taking in his dishevelled state, and then flickered to the kitchen doorway.
John managed a weak smile. “Can’t get enough, can you?” He managed. “Buy me a drink fi...” he was interrupted by another shiver and a coughing fit. He felt the cold from the clothes, the floor and the wind bite into his bones.
“You’d definitely botch it up somehow, because you’re always so nervous,” she said with a laugh.
“Oh well,” Sherlock said with a heavy sigh. “That’s what I have you for!”
“That would be... an interesting experiment,” he conceded, with a genuine smile this time.
“Not even possible then. She must be missing her brain.”
