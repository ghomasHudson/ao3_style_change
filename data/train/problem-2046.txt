All he ever felt was dread, sorrow, and remorse. Pushing Sherlock away had lost him a key part of his central being. After he had returned home from the war, he was not himself. After losing Sherlock, he was not himself.  When he and Sherlock were together, then and only then was he whole, happy, and alive.
Looking around, the violet-haired found most of the attendees backing away, huddled next to the great mosaic at the bow of the ship; unable to cross towards the bridge. The royal party stood behind him, John just a few paces away, drenched to the bone, as he waited for Eurus to deliver her demands. She was ready to strike when the violet-haired boy closed a fist and caused fire-like bursts of magic to knock her down several feet away.
scientific equipment he had stuffed in there. “Are you feeling sort of weird about this?” Lestrade asked, running a hand through his messy hair. “I mean,” He continued. “It’s not so bad here, you know?” He said as he eyed the group of leaders of cheer that was passing by in front of them.
But this time, his phone remained silent. Not a single text the whole day. And John wasn’t going to pretend he wasn’t constantly checking his phone. He absolutely was and he hated himself for it. Who was he to think that Sherlock would keep him up to date on his cases when he had flat out refused to go with him for no reason whatsoever.
The white curtains danced gracefully in the night breeze, and the old, wooden ceiling creaked low and steady. The moonlight projected the shadows of tree branches all over the walls in crisscrossing patterns, and John didn’t know where to look.  After tossing and turning for at least an hour, he just closed his eyes and tried to ignore it all.
John couldn’t help but remember the dance lessons Sherlock gave him in the weeks leading up to his wedding. Surely he remembered a thing or two. God, that felt so long ago.
After digging through the sheets and blankets she’d stuffed in there as an extra layer of protection, she finally reached –
“No, John. Not quite.” Sherlock smiled at him in that unsettling way of his when a particularly clever serial killer had captured his interest. He lowered his voice and continued.
“The woman over there.” He subtly gestured to a stunningly attractive lady in a violet dress. “She secretly does prostitute work behind her boyfriend’s back. But he found out when she accidentally serviced his cousin who she’d never met. He told on her and now she’s here single.”
Sherlock looked down and his hands in his lap. John was so deeply disappointed in him that he wasn't coming. John's anger, he could deal with. John yelling at him was fine. It was the profound disappointment in John's eyes when he called him an 'inhuman machine' that cut to his core and left a throbbing ache in his chest.
John nearly choked on his water. Whereas a moment ago his heart pattered with love for this friend, it how raced in a panicky fit.
Several armed members of his crew followed up. Victor, Jackson, and Bolt, all weak at the knees, put their arms up in surrender. Moriarty slowly stalked around them all, taking everything in, eyes lingering on everyone in turn.
His feelings for Sherlock had not diminished in the slightest over the past few weeks, but his mental stability sure had.  Being a part of Sherlock’s life and without actually being with him how he’d want to be had taken a toll on him. With a heavy weight settling into his chest, he finally and fully understood that he was in for a torturous life. There was no end in sight to this. And now, not even was any chance of a romance with Sherlock gone for good, but their friendship was at stake. Just hanging by a thread.
They wormed their way into the dancing crowd, squeezing between bodies and bumping into people. The colorful dots of light roamed the crowd as they struggled to find space. Eventually, they found a cleared area near the top corner by the bar.
“No!” he screamed and dove to the ground, beating her to him. He pulled Sherlock into his chest, cradling his bleeding head in one arm and wrapping the other around his torso. “Don’t touch him.” He hissed quietly, anger warping his voice into something low and feral. “Don’t you ever fucking touch him
“If you hadn’t called me the day after I moved in threatening to kill Sherlock if we ever got together, none of that would have happened.” Sherlock’s head turned towards him in surprise, his eyes wide and wounded.
“What . . . job?” he asked, desperately scrambling to change the subject. He hated his voice for finally cracking, giving him away.
John met his eyes at his direct mention of the previous night. They had shared a bed on countless cases before but never talked about it. It was one of those things they silently agreed to keep safely hidden in the intimate darkness of the night time.
Sherlock released him and moved down to suckle his balls. He mouthed eagerly at his most intimate parts, dipping lower to poke his tongue into his hole. After placing a full, open-mouthed kiss right on it, he pulled back and swiped his finger up his entire damp crack.
John lifted Sherlock’s splintered hands, breathed onto them, and rubbed them together between his own. Sherlock let him, sighing in appreciation at the burst of warmth. He reciprocated afterwards by wrapping his arms around John and rubbing circulation back into his arms.
The menacing clouds rolled in smoothly sweeping away every last bit of sunlight on the entire ship. The entire crew seized working and gazed upwards in collective silence. John and Molly exchanged concerned glances as the rest of the crew looked to Sherlock for guidance.
“Don’t bother. You’re going nowhere unless I allow it,” said a somewhat distant voice. Victor Trevor approached the three of them from the hallway that lead them there.
John reached one hand up and clutched the back of his collar like he’d be damned if he ever let him slip through his fingers again. He realized John had almost just lost him for the
Victor was kneeling with his hands above his head, shaking and cowering. Moriarty strolled over and kneeled to look him right in the eye. “Please,” Victor sniveled. Moriarty smirked in return.
I'm really sorry if you were hoping for a more detailed description of their night together! I tried really hard to write something smuttier, but I just... couldn't do it. I know, I'm a terrible person. Maybe when I write my next fan fiction I'll be less self conscious :P
She let out a nervous chuckle. “Yes, well… he’s a halfway decent guy, isn’t he? No, sorry! I just meant- I mean not that he isn’t…Anyway,” She shook her head at herself and moved on.
“You're the one that I want! You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey! The one that I want! You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey.”
He gasped in a sharp breath as Sherlock sucked a hickey where his neck met his shoulder. He pulled back momentarily, shifting so he was positioned right over his scar.
He gripped his knees and breathed in heavily through his nose. Closing his eyes and exhaling through his mouth, he tried to calm himself down.
He couldn’t tell Sherlock about Mary. He couldn’t. She would know. And she would kill him. He blinked away the hot tears in his eyes but remained silent.
John awoke with a pounding headache. He recalled the events from last night all too quickly as panic overcame him. He looked down cautiously, unsure of what to find. He still had his clothes, on him and undisturbed. He was not harmed in any way.
Sherlock simply pouted at the floor like a child being scolded by his parents. Since he remained silent, John continued. He knew he was somewhat channeling his anger at Mary towards him, but he didn’t care at the moment.
“John?” came a familiar, deep voice right outside the door. A voice he had never been more relieved to hear. A voice that meant comfort, safety, home.
And of course, the evening they spent together just a few nights ago. The one he replayed in his mind over and over in the dead hours of the night wondering if it was real or if he’d just imagined it. The one where Sherlock had cupped his neck and pulled him into his chest, resting atop his head. The one where he had sobbed openly into his shirt and Sherlock didn’t mind one bit.
John’s eyes grew wide. Sherlock Holmes? THE Sherlock Holmes? The infamous pirate he had heard endless tales about? No. Way.
He withdrew his hand and positioned himself at the widened opening. As he slid himself in, Sherlock sighed beautifully beneath him and fluttered his eyes shut. John surged forward and slotted their lips together once more, kissing him hungrily and rolling his hips.
“I just thought about it and… felt it was best.” John tried not to feel disappointed that he didn’t trust him enough to tell him what all was going on. Whatever that meeting was last night was obviously none of his business, and not in his place to ask.
He held him there, hovering nearly horizontal above the ground, their noses touching and their eyes still locked.
Settled in the back of the cab, John sized up Sherlock’s condition. He had just run through a burning building shirtless and was now consequently covered in scrapes and cuts. John immediately removed his jumper and wrestled it onto him.
John cupped Sherlock’s face and pulled him in further. The kiss remained soft and tender, but still burned with a fiery passion at the same time.
The boy’s mates roared in amusement as they shoved him forward. He laughed and put his hands up in mock-defense, but inevitably received the same treatment of being pulled unwillingly to the stage. He climbed up and took his position by the microphone next to Sherlock.
He made a bit of an extra effort today as he prepared himself to arrive on deck- smoothing out his shirt, running a hand through his hair, and whatnot. He would have done more, but Molly's cheeky glances pushed him to give up and leave to avoid her inevitable teasing. Speaking of, he wondered what happened between her and Greg last night. He didn't remember hearing her return to their cabin before he fell asleep, but she definitely spent the night here. So they just must have spent a late night "out" together. He made a mental note to ask her about it later, and headed up to the deck.
“You’re a liar,” John spat, completely disgusted at her suggestion that Sherlock would ever intentionally hurt him. Or any of their friends. As for hurting himself, he now knew Sherlock had sacrificed himself to save him, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. Mary knew it, too.  He knew she did. She was just trying to get a rise out of him. Or possibly plant doubt in his mind about what kind of person Sherlock actually was.
John simply continued to stare into the fire. He knew if he didn’t, his eyes would travel up to the painting of Gina, and he couldn’t stand to look at her.
John cast his forearm over his head. No one had ever treated him like this before. No one had ever taken this much time exploring every inch of his body in such detail. Worshipping it, loving it. No one had ever found his scars beautiful. No one had ever treated him so tenderly, so softly, so carefully. Like he was a treasure. One of a kind. He was almost overwhelmed.
“The rope you used to to save me when I fell overboard during that storm. You threw it in the water but never reeled it back in. It was still tied to the mast and hanging over the edge into the water. I simply stayed under long enough to convince everyone, including you, that I had drowned. And then I swam over as discreetly as I could and grabbed hold of the rope. I climbed up and broke into a window leading into one of the lower levels. I acquired a gun, all while steering clear of the looters. And then I simply had to wait until Moriarty was alone so I could kill him without getting the rest of you or myself killed.”
John stepped closer and fully took Sherlock's hand in his own. The man's intense gaze bore down directly into his eyes once more, as if trying to read him. He didn't flinch away or take his hand in return. He just remained still. With the air around them electrified, John's heart began to pound in his stomach.
John looked down at the water, now at level with his hips. The deafening roar of the thick pouring stream echoed off the circular walls as the splash sprayed a sharp, cold mist everywhere.
“I will find you,” he managed to stutter before repeating with more conviction, “John. Hold on. I will find you.”
Sherlock hushed him and pulled him in closer to his own jumper. Huddled in a cocoon of arms and dwindling body heat, they fell asleep and remained so until the cab screeched to a halt in front of 221B Baker Street.
“Do you want it or not?” John chuckled and reached out through the bars. Sherlock handed off the disappointingly cold bowl with a satisfied smile. As John began to eat, he found himself wanting to ask about the man who was supposedly his lover, or…. Something.
John felt frozen in his seat. He thought about how his dream was once to work at that hospital, to wear the white coat and the stethoscope and be a hero to all those he could help. But he clamped his mouth shut and shook his head.
And of course, thanks to each and every single person who took a chance on this fic and read it! I'm so happy this is finished and I hope you guys enjoyed the ups and downs of this journey as much as I have. Take care, I love you all! xo
John woke up to a blast of thunder so powerful it shook the room. He glanced at the clock on his nightstand, squinting in the dark. It was only 3:30 in the morning. With a groan, his head fell back on the pillow. If he was going to be woken up by thunder, why couldn’t it have been at a more decent hour? He rolled over and reached out to spoon Sherlock close to him. Only he couldn’t. Because the other half of the bed was empty.
He pondered, as they moved through people’s legs. Suddenly, the rebel bumped into a pair of very familiar shoes, an atrocity that could not be hidden no matter how long the hem of the wearer’s dress was. Perhaps he had helped Molly with her hair but her fashion sense still needed a lot of work. And ironically, it was at that moment when the answer came to him, stemmed by that mundane notion. He ran his hands through his bright purple hair and gasped in the revelation it provided, smirking when he saw the resolution staining his left hand.
When I started this project I never really believed it was going to end up being so long or different, but I had a lot of fun writing it.
“For a society that considers it outdated, you seem to rely heavily on magic.” Commented Sherlock once they entered the main hall of the bright castle and they noticed the moving paintings on the ceiling. John couldn’t really remember having told them that magical abilities had been monitored, restricted and essentially ignored for cycles, but he supposed it could have been obvious for an outsider in some way. “What happened with all the spells and cauldrons?” He asked. “The wands?” He sounded like a curious child in search for information, his coat whirling behind him giving him a strange amalgamated appearance between dramatic and innocent.
a siren?” Greg commented as they climbed up the stairs two at a time. “Seems a bit excessive.” He laughed.
“Got it?” Irene asked, handing him the last make-shift sack of colourful liquid to place on the bag. The others sporting varying shades and sizes, ready to launch and attack. Sherlock had thrown in a few of ill-smelling chemicals on some of them —mainly the green ones— and some that produced a bright explosion for emergencies. All in all, they were as prepared as they would ever be to face E. and her crew of idiot pirates.
She said, and Sherlock let go of the railing, slowly taking a step back from the edge as her words sunk in. “Thank you, it was
“We don’t know.” John answered; another wave hitting them and causing him to reel backwards. His hand never leaving Sherlock’s and the rebel’s wet curls jerked back and forth as he examined the restless water.
At this, the others were approaching again, probably to figure out the expression over their faces. Irene frowned when she saw him, but the other three just appeared amused at his utter gloom. Janine placed an arm around Molly’s shoulders in camaraderie. Her big grin loaded with a wistful quality. “With that enthusiasm, I can hardly wait to see how you’ll be when your wedding comes around, Sherlock.” She said, as a collective halting silence descended upon the group.
Sally smirked, “Thanks,” She said, turning to watch them all in turn. Philip was standing, his sword still at his side and a snide expression over his face. The dark skinned girl placed her hands on her hips and waited, an eyebrow arching in expectation. Anderson sighed, and reluctantly presented his sword forward. Sally smiled and nodded, while she placed the whistle between her lips. “Now down and give me twenty!” She ordered. The others instinctively turned to Greg, looking for guidance, to which the rebel only gestured to listen to their captain and quickly dropped to the floor in demonstration.
“Wonderful.” Lady Hudson beamed and placed an oblivious hand over her arm, covered with a sparkly soft jumper in white which matched the big ribbon bow covering most of her head and hiding her pink roots.
James turned around again, eyeing Sherlock in expectation. Focusing his gaze at the other’s expression to recognise what was going on inside his head. The boy’s hand retreated, just a little, but for the older man it was all the proof he required.
“I said: no.” Sherlock started. “The exam is almost over and she clearly didn’t have it with her, so she can’t have been cheating, now could she?” The boy stated, his tone dripping condescendence; he crossed his arms over his chest and arched an eyebrow in defiance. Irene looked on bewildered, her friend had always been ruthless, but lately he did things like this with a new passion that she had never seen before. “Is this the height of intellect the school is used to when its teachers are concerned?” Sherlock asked, his vicious smile cutting through the air quickly.
He tried not to panic, but the situation was not exactly inducing a lot of calming thoughts into his mind. A sudden splash propelled water rushing towards him, colliding with them and sending them both underwater, the royal barely able to keep the rebel in his hold as they were jostled and twirled inside the wave. A feeling of pause rushed inside of him as they both were suspended in the water’s domain, allowing him to catch a glimpse at the bottom of the ship, covered in darkness as thick as ink but with no sight of any form of body around it as he had previously thought; the limbs seeming to spring from the depths of the ocean itself. John swam to the surface, breaking and inhaling a great burst of air as it rushed inside his lungs when he realised what had caused the angry tides: one fallen tentacle was dissipating in the water as dust, while an opening in between the ones gripping the ship appeared. The winged beast surprisingly appeared to be making progress.
“Shut up, dad!” The sentence was out, and angry, and clearly not intended, as he wilted right after finishing; but it was enough to draw a gasp out of the crowd. Eurus grinned when her gaze met silver eyes. Sherlock had seen John like this before; one of his most vivid moments in Auradon was on a sports field under the summer sun all those moon cycles ago. Perhaps the boy had never been more honest with John than when he was lying to him to steal the wand; but the royal was another matter altogether. The racing brain quickly unraveled it from there and found the reason to be exactly the same as to why his coat felt lighter than it should.
and the violet-haired’s cheeks warmed at the thought of the other regarding him in that way, when he, in no sense of the truth, deserved it. “No,” John assured, taking the ring he had recovered earlier on deck and sliding it on the rebel’s slender finger. “You weren’t.” He said.
what our John needs.” She declared, even if Sherlock was not exactly sure about the validation of said statement. Reciprocity had never been a rule of the universe.
His eyes kept shifting between his imminent demise before him, and the blonde boy behind the looming figure. His kind and worried gaze was stripping him of every other thought he possessed. The expression he found in the other was almost enough to soften his resolve, but he was not allowed to falter now. He needed the monster, and monsters were not allowed that which he wanted. Muttering a silent goodbye, Sherlock felt cold run through his limbs, colder than he had felt in cycles, but he shrugged it off, not having time to dwell on it. Moriarty was ready to attack, and the boy could recognise this time there would be no dancing around the issue. If he didn’t act now, he would never get the chance again. He had to do it: this atrocity he was born to do.
“I hate to keep bothering you,” She said, as she anxiously fidgeted with the pen and smiled apologetically. “But the decorating committee needs more answers, and I know you must be very busy, but this will only take a bit and as much as I-” She babbled. Causing the boy to have flashbacks on that afternoon where she had talked for thirty seven minutes straight, with no prompting on his part, and him only managing to hear
She seemed confused, specially when he steepled his hands under his chin and slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them, her expression hadn’t changed, but something else had. Her hair was no longer styled back in a plain ponytail; now it cascaded around her face in soft waves with a very low side-parting which concealed most of the pink on the roots, and since it was magical she will have trouble
Greg Lestrade was standing in the middle of the field, wearing the right uniform and crossing his arms in an expression of dubious disinterest. John approached him and waved, to which he only got a half-hearted scrunched of eyebrows in return. They were fun —these kids from the isle. “This is Lestrade,” The tall man said, waving the papers he was holding in obvious sign of its official state. “And he will be joining us at regular practices from now on.” He announced, and both Greg and John looked around for the second head that should be among the players. “Where’s Sherlock?” The blonde boy asked, raising his sight up to the coach in wait for information.
“Nothing?” He questioned. However, she appeared unbothered, raising her eyebrows in indifference as she returned her attention to images of Sherlock frowning at the camera.
He couldn’t stop. No matter how much he wanted to, the effects had been set in motion and he was powerless to stop them. Falling deeper and deeper into an unknown, scary territory of which he failed to determine whether he actually wanted to get out in the first place. Every plan of attack he could be thinking would be useless, no one could help him, nobody would be able to tell him why he suddenly felt as if every decision he had taken had been lived by a different person. Someone that he had never been. The blood pumping quickly through his veins felt like liquid fire under his skin, he wondered how could he be such an idiot as to allow this to happen?
“And that’s Thursday.” Sherlock commented, breaking him out of his pondering. John turned with a questioning frown at his boyfriend’s dismissal.
“Like it?” John asked, his expression open and completely blissed out. “I-” He started, his words slow and smooth as he approached to reach past Sherlock and grab another small dumpling; his face coming close to the other’s as he popped the food inside his mouth with a big grin. “…
The precious little heroes seemed to have forgotten about a minuscule detail: happiness is as treacherous and misleading as an evil genie, and no amount of their good-wishes and wizardly-forged barriers would be able to hold the most evil minds of the land, at least not for long. Every mortal or mythical being had to know that they would eventually find a way to break out. They only had to await an opportune possibility and the kings and queens will never see them coming —the morons.
“Listen, I’ve gotta go.” He said, hurriedly moving as she stayed behind and finally gave up on getting to him. “Later!” Came the exclamation, as he heard the slapping of his heavy boots over the pavement while she grew smaller by the distance.
I had a lot of fun writing this and I really hope you liked it and would like to know what you thought of it. I'm planning the third (and final) part of the series and should come out in the future so be on the look out!
“Are you using again?” Greg went straight to the punch; they had all lately faced scarier things than Sherlock in one of his
“It’s all fine,” The blonde said. Smiling sadly at him like the first time John had realised just how different things back at The Isle were. A mixture between a deep sadness and determination, like he would never give up until he saw it fixed. Sherlock would catalogue the look, were he not busy having the equivalent of a cornered-animal reaction.
“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” He said, turning his gaze away from the other’s face and grabbing the front of the stupid jumper the king was wearing underneath the jacket. Presenting the wand with the remaining hand.
, but because he truly couldn’t fathom the idea why she wanted it, and what she hoped he would find.
“No, but-” Irene tried to interject, but the rushing speech of the other trampled over her words as she continued with not a care or sign of having heard her.
Sherlock’s frame shook in his arms, “We need to get you out of the water,” The blonde whispered, not stopping one second as he looked around for a way to get back up. Eurus’ pull on the tides under them was still perceivable and it worried him, even if John had no actual visual of her. To him, having her out of sight was worse.
The brunette girl stopped and turned back around, her eyes fire bottled up. “And by the way,” She said. “This is exactly why we broke up, Anderson.” With that, Donovan left the arena and walked away.
“Super.” Sherlock answered in what seemed to the prince a highly sarcastic tone. The blonde believed he was never going to understand what was going on with this boy; whether if he was just playing him, or if he genuinely was that moody and rude; or both at the same time. He supposed he would just have to know him better to be able to tell.
Sherlock could barely register John was a bit outraged at his accusation, showing that nerve the rebel had always liked about him. “I may be an idiot, but I know a lot more about this than you do.” The blonde demanded, not ready to be dismissed as Sherlock intended. “I was five when the war started, remember?” He asked. “I’ve seen bad people. I know what that hatred looks like,” Revealing the fact of which the genius had been previously unaware. Of course he could do the simple math, but he had never stopped to think about John actually witnessing anything like he did. “And you may have her eyes but you are
“They’re here!” Sebastian exclaimed, climbing down from the mast where he was perched up. The rest of the pirates cheered, excited cries raining down as the four of them approached the platform to the deck.
Lestrade sighed but still brought forward all that he had stolen through the morning, giving it up for inspection by his greedy progenitor; Sherlock just slouched more in his seat and anxiously waited for them to be over with their tedious affairs so he could retire to his room and finish his experiment in the rate of deathly poisons.
Thursday.” He said, only to be met with a blank stare and confused grimace. Both of which were quite rare to see on his boyfriend’s face separately, let alone at the same time.
“I tried,” Mycroft responded, a dangerous edge to his voice, and if daring the other to imply he hadn’t tried hard enough. “However a magical dome is beyond even my mortal capacity.” His hands shifted over the handle of his umbrella, and his shoulders were back as in defiance. Holmes’ never took too well at admitting personal shortcomings; Mycroft being a mortal with no magic, clearly believed he had many of those. Sherlock could see the sincerity in his eyes, and in turn nodded in acceptance, letting go of things which he couldn’t change.
“Yes, we-” He started, ready to explain in length what had happened, but he halted once Sherlock’s door came into view and he saw light filtering out from the room. “Why is Sherlock’s door open?” Greg asked, as he watched Mike frown and walk faster towards it. Greg pushed the door all the way, only to be greeted by Anderson’s back. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He exclaimed, crossing his muscular arms.
“My brother is a category of his own, I’m afraid.” The ginger responded, a lighter tone weaved through the words, amused by the undeniable truth he was verbalising.
“You can go ahead and keep waiting for that too.” Sherlock responded. His back straight and his slender form towering over the others despite being shorter than one of them.
had been, could surely not reach him on dry land, could it? The boy scrambled away from the lapping waves and rolled over until he was sitting on the shore.
The tides were crashing at the rocks on the beach again, the sea awake once more; yet the suffocating atmosphere was not able to leave them. There was an unrelenting frown on the toddler’s face, as he looked back at the water from which he was escaping; because whatever that
His eyes took on a mixture of enraged with an edge of confusion. No matter whether he understood it or not, this is how his mother used to be and how he was going to grow up to be; the usual satisfying taste he got at such a thought turned just slightly sour at the scene in front of his eyes, as if the task seemed daunting all of a sudden.
“No!” The violet-haired boy exclaimed, rushing to his side, Irene and Lestrade closely behind him. Sherlock bent down and checked the older man over, worried lines appearing on his young face when he realised he had no way of knowing wether it would be possible to bring him back. Rage surged through his system at the pain, the terrifying sadness he felt at losing him so soon after finding him.
Next to him, Irene was scrawling something on her notebook but completely ignoring the lesson and the teacher; the boy didn’t blame her, he was clearly not qualified to give this course. The fact that they had to share the lesson with Philip Anderson didn’t seem to help either.
Molly chose that moment to finally step forward and break the tension, impatiently running to the king and wrapping him between thin arms as she hugged him with relief in her expression. “John!” She exclaimed. “I’m so glad you’re okay.” Her hair in the high ponytail too perfect for the situation, only making her appear younger as she beamed at him.
“Oh, for God’s sake!” Anderson bemoaned loudly, causing the others to stare at him with even more alarm than that of the fact they now had a female captain. The team clapped, hesitantly at first but then gained volume and some enthusiasm. They presented swords, —as was accustomed to do for their commander, and Greg soon joined in the gesture.
Wilkes face grew red from anger, and his uncovered arms flexed into battle stance. However, he stayed put, not wanting to act out against his leader’s orders. E. payed him no mind and observed Sherlock; said boy just leaned back and arched an eyebrow at her staring. “Look at me.” She said, tilting her head as her teal eyes made sure he did as she asked.
suited for this, specially since every other kid in the field was mildly-to-very afraid of him. You didn’t have to be a genius at deduction to notice.
“Thanks, mum.” He mumbled, trying to escape from her dotting grip. “By the way,” He said, trying to pose for the camera and look princely while breaking the news to his parents. “I brought someone.” He said, and his dad’s face broke out into a big grin; he, above anyone else, wished to see him married and with a proper family a few cycles after ascending to the throne ‘
“And never, ever smile.” Lestrade added at his apologetic expression. “Unless you’re torturing something.”
“Hello, Moriarty.” Sherlock acknowledged; he stood up and placed his shaking hands inside the pockets of the coat that he was now wearing. He failed to know whether what he was doing was a good idea or a grave mistake, but he had run out of other options.
“A crown doesn’t make you a king.” The blue-eyed was quick to disagree. Running a hand through his hair to mess up some strands. Giving him an air of nonchalance that Sherlock just found pleasing. After living between snobby royals for weeks long, the break was much appreciated.
The truth was that in situations such as this, the rebel often tended to over-experience details, and that —on top of everything else— was yet another reason to overwhelm him. The soft yellow blanket under them was scratching the sliver of skin that peeked out from his trouser legs, and the glow of the light reflecting on the lake felt horribly blinding. Thankfully, blocking part of his view and most of the light was John; sitting in front of him with that shit-eating grin on his face. Happily munching on the fourth appetiser of the afternoon.
Sherlock remained perched over the railing, away from the crowd, for quite some time. Somehow entranced by the view of the tranquil waves lapping at the side of the ship. The rebel had always found water a very great source of discomfort, specially in such an endless form as this. Avoiding it as much as he could even when he knew it was absurd. He now found knowing the reason for his aversion didn’t really ease the feeling as he had once thought it would; appearing to enhance it actually. The undeniable reality was that deep waters, specially vast oceans, hid too many unsolvable mysteries in which he would forever be snared by the very same doubts he was trying to escape.
“Very well,” The man relented, not seemingly fazed at the continued rejection. He adjusted his glasses and took a moment to scratch his blonde beard. “Moriarty requires your presence at the castle immediately.” He declared, to which the younger man could only frown in confusion, that usually meant he was going to have to spend the afternoon doing some sort of special errand. Well, at least it would certainly occupy his intellect for an hour or two. “He said to bring your gang of punks.”
“Look at me!” She screamed, yanking his royal blue-clad shoulder around and securing a frantic hand over his shoulder. “You love me, remember?” Her tone left no space for argument. Conveying a false sweetness as she covered his hand with hers and eyed him sternly. As if John were just a dazed kid speaking nonsense.
“Thank you, but no, thank you.” The blonde was quick to reply. “The last girl you set up ended up with that pervert from the Enchanted Meadows.” The boy recalled that perfectly, it had been a rare source of amusement for him for hours.
“I’m sure every kid in Auradon knows that.” Sherlock continued, while he fidgeted with the bag. John needed to find a way to fix this, the last thing he wanted was to make him think he was scared of him, because that couldn’t be further from the truth.
“No.” John answered in seriousness; catching the expressive silver eyes with his own and motioning his boyfriend over to them. “
“At least I don’t see a picture of me with horns and missing teeth.” The king said, and Sherlock jumped and turned around so fast he almost tripped off the platform on which he was standing. John was not in the mood to enjoy the fact of finally having startled him.
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer, but Lady Hudson was quicker wrapping her thoughts into a coherent sentence. “He used the reversal incantation to lock Moriarty inside his own mind.” She explained, and there was a pregnant silence in the room for a few moments. All of them astonished at the news of what he had unwittingly accomplished. The first to recover was, surprisingly, the new king who quickly approached the violet-haired boy once more, and, in a fit of spontaneous affection, wrapped his sturdy arms around his waist and hoisted him up in the air in celebration. “John!” The rebel complained in disgust, patting the blonde’s shoulder to get him to put him back on the ground once more, where he belonged. John laughed that honest laugh as Irene and Lestrade chuckled in amusement behind them. Sherlock shot them both a nasty, murderous look; but once his sight reached the royal, his eyes turned slightly more charmed and the glare lost some of its heated intensity.
“His girlfriend.” Mary finished. Her face was amiable, but her smile was not entirely sincere. John knew the princess was not exactly pleased with the situation; not because she had anything against the kids in particular, but she believed he was deluding himself into thinking they would ever be able to function in their society. The prince was set on proving her wrong.
John laughed as the violet-haired tried to lick clean the skin surrounding his mouth. “You just got a-” The blonde said as he reached his hand towards the other’s face, only for the other to flinch back and avoid any sort of contact. John retreated his arm, yet he didn’t seem confused or angry, just accepting, and Sherlock thought it would have been less frustrating if he had yelled at him. “Do this.” John demonstrated, licking and smacking his lips, then smiling.
Inside the room, Sherlock was grinning again, and the other two looked on in anticipation. Every time he looked determined like that, everyone knew he was brewing trouble. “Irene,” He said, prancing across the room and stopping at his desk once more.
He pushed the wooden, rotten swinging doors, and placed one foot in the establishment, the inside equally as disappointing as the outside was. The several tables were crammed with idiots and low-rate criminals, and the bar hosted the most insufferable characters —the ones likely to find themselves the world’s lost wonder. Sherlock pursed his lips in disgust and placed his pale hands inside his pockets to avoid unwanted contact.
“Christ,” John exclaimed in a very royal way. “That’s almost worse.” It was the violet-haired boy’s time to feign offense.
“No, no no.” Molly shook her head as an answer to his unvoiced question. “I’ve seen it.” She explained, suddenly ready to defend him; all he had done is fix her poor attempts at hiding rose-coloured hair, for evil’s sake! And that had been completely in his selfish interests. “He’s good at people problems.”
at me.” She ordered, and Sherlock felt compelled to oblige, not because he was susceptible to be roped in by her so called
The athlete then chose to ignore the heavy knot inside his throat and bravely stepped forward. Taking care to inspect the other quite detailedly. “What!?” Sherlock asked at the face of the scrutiny. “What!?” He repeated, when no explanation seemed forthcoming; apparently his —normally meagre to begin with— patience was gone too.
to have it that way in the future. Everything else aside —compared to her previous atrocity— Sherlock believed he inadvertently did the world a favour.
Lestrade seemed to contemplate this, mulling over the concept before turning around and arching an eyebrow at him. “Can I be the fist?” He asked, as he halted. A wicked stance as the prince retraced his steps.
“Don’t,” was all he managed to grunt before the rod was pressed in the hollow of his throat. This time, he did scream.
He took in the patterned, spray painted wall paper, the cluttered bookshelves and table, the skull up on the mantelpiece, and finally, their plush, welcoming chairs. Just how they always were. His heart tugged at the comfort and familiarity of it all.
“We both came without dates tonight and were looking for some company. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”
She had to figure out what that meant for her before she was thrown unprepared into whatever scheme he had planned.
“Yes,” he replied, pulling out a large bag from under a counter. “Here you are. John, I am truly, very sorry.”
There was a heated silence as they all waited for his reply. After several moments, he very quietly said, "No."
The inevitable question of ‘Now what?’ hung in the air. They couldn’t beat around what had happened between them in the mansion forever.
John listened to it all without saying a word. He cried when Sherlock cried. Hugged him close. Held onto his hands to stop him from scratching at his forearms. There was nothing he could say to make it better. He couldn’t tell Sherlock it wasn’t his fault, that there was nothing he could’ve done. He knew those would be empty words to his ears. All he could do was be there for him. And he was.
John’s blood boiled in his ears. His face went scarlet red as he gritted his teeth furiously. But when Sherlock flicked his angry, challenging gaze back to John and broke away from Julia, he finally snapped.
Panic spiked through his gut as he saw the time stamps. One right after another. All just about an hour ago. Possibilities of all the dreadful things that could have happened flashed through his mind at top speed.
“Shh, keep your voice down!” John huffed as they calmed down. They giggled and imagined their lives with a child in the picture.
John only had to look at Sherlock's soft, hurt face to know why he had called them off. He may have developed more of a moral compass since John had shown his disapproval, but he could see that this was eating the man up inside. He decided to dive in and ask the one question that had been bothering him the most.
Beppo had killed his boyfriend Pierto after a heated argument, and then pushed the penknife into the clay of a drying Thatcher sculpture. He confessed to the murder when Sherlock and John caught him breaking into various houses to find the sculpture with his knife so he could destroy it.
Several long moments of Sherlock staring into his hands, taking deep breaths, and swallowing, he began.
I'm sorry that the boys are apart for this whole chapter, but just hold out a tiny bit longer ;)  They'll be together soon.
Nearly a month after Mycroft had made his initial offer, John called him back and said he’d like to reconnect with his sister. He had expected a phone call or video chat to be arranged. He hadn’t expected Harry to pull up to 221B in a cab within a few days. Their reunion was tearful, awkward, and complicated, as expected. Turns out Harry had always missed John. After she moved to Scotland with her girlfriend, life was good for a while. But they broke up after a year, and Harry’s life fell apart once again. But she thought John would be upset with her for leaving and didn’t want to burden him again. And as the years went on, it became easier and easier to maintain the silence between them. She got back on her feet after some time and got a job at a bakery. Now a pastry chef, she’s famous among the locals in her town for her cakes. After flying to London, she stayed with John and Sherlock for a week before going home. She and John had maintained contact ever since. Their broken relationship was pieced back together, slowly but surely.
“He was obviously going to ask her out eventually. I just did him a favor and sped up the process. Made things easier.”
“Alright. Sherlock,” he began as gently and cautiously as possible. “I think it’s time we entertain the possibility of something paranormal being at work here, yes?”
She tilted his chin up with the tip of the gun. “Always ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for you,” she said inspecting his face. Sherlock closed his eyes and winced as she stretched his head back with the gun far too much to be comfortable.
Without thinking twice, he moved in and gently brushed his lips against Sherlock's. It was tentative and shy, as if testing the waters. Sherlock's lips were much softer and warmer than he expected. The other man didn't move or react, just stood there frozen, as if a single movement could shatter this entire moment.  John lingered for a moment, their lips barely touching, before he came to his senses and pulled back apologetically.
When Sherlock shifted his hips slightly more to the center and thrust in a particularly gratifying way, he threw his head back again.
He ran his fingers delicately over the intricate, hand-carved design, and then over the wicked, gleaming blade that jutted out of it. On the side of the wooden handle were the initials ‘B.R.’
Sherlock stood at his bedside, hair mussed and wearing only his pajama pants. He held a lamp in his hand as his chest heaved.
Sherlock was going to come home, and they were finally going to talk. John would confess to him everything Mary had forced him into. He would explain why he had pushed him away so many times. Sherlock would take it to Mycroft and they would get it all sorted out. John would be freed from her control, and he would restart his life with Sherlock.
He wiped the blood off his hand before running the tips of his fingers down in between the gashes. This touch wasn’t clinical at all. He just needed to feel the warmth of his skin and the thump of his heart underneath.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his expression. “Yes, the one from all your ridiculous stories. God, it’s physically painful watching you think. LESTRADE!” A fit man with short, dark gray hair approached them. “Take him down to the brig. Let him rest up. I’ll talk to him later.” As Sherlock removed his boot from John’s chest, the man called Lestrade bent down and offered him his hand.
Please know next chapter will take a bit more than usual to arrive, but I promise it will arrive within two weeks.
“I’ll stay here and help.” The girl offered. She moved her head aside in an obvious attempt to see what he was writing.
This time he wasn’t able to even try to fight off feeling like a terrible fraud or ignore the growing disease he felt inside him. His own guts chocking and leaving him gasping for air as he silently sobbed, with only half a mind to let none of the stray tears fall into the mix. Well, none but one.
“But your date!” Irene yelled after him as he walked carelessly out of the door and into the hallway. Strutting down the corridor and paying no attention to his surroundings in favour of staring at the fateful mobile phone.
There was no point in denying it, or pretending it wasn’t exactly accurate. “I’m not coming back.” The silver-eyed boy responded. The sentence dropping like a bomb inside his ears. A true finality of thoughts when they are voiced out loud.
“I know, Jim.” The curly-haired boy responded, noticing the disappointed expressions the two of his companions were trying to mask. Sherlock never really had any delusions about his role on Moriarty’s life, yet this was actually family for Irene and Greg and it must sting to realise their only true concern was in the wand and their impending power —not that his mother had been better when she was alive, she was definitely worse.
John realised how really unequipped he was to be deciding things about which he knew nothing. If it had been him, he doubted he would have lasted a single day alone in a foreign place, and what about deciding what to do with people that had clearly done something wrong? When was enough
The younger boy smiled, and reached out a slender hand. He curled his fingers over its length and took it out from hiding. “Brilliant.” He whispered as he inspected the most powerful wand in the magical world, its force the only sort of magic that worked underneath the dome, as it was the object that had created it. The bright sparkles it gave almost blinding at the stark contrast against the grey clouds in the sky. Sherlock replaced the wand inside the bag and joined his hands in anticipation. At least he looked satisfied at the inspection with whatever it was the wand required. “Keep it hidden until we get there.” He said to Lestrade, as the other nodded.
The girl behind him stared at him with sympathy in her eyes. Despite being worried herself to lose her friend, she still found it fitting to feel pity for
he said. However, he never realised that, although John cared deeply and honestly for his kingdom, he would marry if and when, —and whom— he wished, whether it was proper for the realm or not.
“God!” Greg exclaimed, running an exasperated hand over his face. He figured that perhaps the direct route would be the best option in his situation, no matter how much he wished to avoid saying the words out loud. “I’m asking you to be my date for Cotillion.” He quickly worded, only to watch hesitant understanding dawn over the other’s face, the conversation on her phone forgotten as her hand gripped the device
.” The word was spoken as a description, in no way underlining the original raw ache that came with it. The silver gaze left her face and turned to regard the blonde, bewildered at how devoted he seemed at the display. “Do you know what that’s like?” She asked, and Sherlock pressed his lips into a thin line in order to attempt to keep the words inside, the answer now more dangerous than he had believed at first.“Like someone
At only seconds left of the game, Greg managed to cover John and the ball by picking up another player by the shirt and using him as a shield, Sherlock laughed at such display. Perhaps Lestrade
The glowing dragon laid struggling on the grown, as if restrained to the floor by invisible chains into the hastily-drawn red circle on the marble. The curse in the boy’s blood was eating away at the other’s incantation like a disease, trying to bind it in the darkness of oblivion for eternity. It would not be able to, obviously, —it wouldn’t even contain it for long— but at least like this he had more time to devise what to do next without being cursed into the next century.
“Oh, I know.” He said, ignoring the previous statement as he dropped the recently deceased fish over the counter, making a nasty squelching sound as they hit the surface. “I brought you a gift.” He rang the bell on the wall-opening signing for the cook as a shameless smirk appeared over his lips.
“But you know him better than I do.” He said as he stuffed his hands inside his coat, no longer in need of being intimidating once that he had obtained what he wanted. And that was the only reason he had backed down, not because the truth of the fact made him oddly sick to his stomach.
little brother.” He said, and Sherlock turned an icy gaze towards his direction. The familiarity of the banter leaving him feeling oddly reassured, and when he saw the other’s expression, he deduced perhaps that was the intention.
“Wait!” Irene yelled back after him. “Where are you going?” Her drenched hair around her face was almost black in the near darkness inside the sea creature’s prison.
A few seconds passed in relative silence —with the other royals still distressed by the events and rushing about to get the cursed people on stretchers and out to get magical aid. All of this, coordinated by the former King and Queen, of course. The rebel wondered why John was not there helping, since his first instinct would have characteristically been to make sure his people were safe, but perhaps now that his parents had taken care of that, he was left staring down in apprehension at Jim, as if making sure there was no way for him to bounce back to life and destroy them.
. The blue-eyed boy ignored him and kept smiling amusedly. The second note of the whistle brought them out of their laughing and into running to the field with helmets and lances, ready to be in joust position.
Molly, however, didn’t seemed to notice much about his exasperation; At least not more than how he usually was, she just carried on with her big eyes and the soft brown hair that she went back into using in a high ponytail. “Right, sorry. So, as much as I hate to-” She stumbled through her words, grimacing when she apparently didn’t find one she liked.
“Anyway, I was a bit freaked to be sure, but soon enough I found myself accepting the situation. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a place where someone was always shouting, or the rules were always changing, but I’m usually pretty good at coming to terms with whatever’s happening at the moment. Maybe that’s why I was such a natural fit for the army.” He pauses and shakes his head. “Sorry, you’re not here for amateur psychoanalysis.”
Mycroft heaves a theatrical sigh and moves towards the exit. “Have it your way, brother mine. But don’t take too long. I’ll be in touch later to check on any…developments.”
"You can make your statement in a couple of ways," she explains, gesturing to the desk. "You can write it longhand, type it out—here," she hits a key and a digital form appears onscreen, "or you can click this red button and do an audio recording if you'd rather.”
“I walked outside and yelled a bit, but my voice sounded the way it does after a heavy snowfall, all muffled and close. I think you could have fired a gun right next to me and it wouldn’t have made much of a noise. The desert had seemed so, so
Molly seems unsurprised by his report. "It's all right, really," she tells him. "These things happen here more than you'd think. Let me just see if Sherlock's free."
dull. I could whip up something to make this more interesting for us. A minefield, perhaps, or a gigantic hound? Something to get you moving.” She brightens with a sudden thought. “I could make you think you had spiders crawling all over you. That would be fun
She pauses, her hand on the knob. "Yes, or listen to it, and we'll do any follow-up we can. Not that there's always much that can be done..." she trails off. "Anyway, I'll leave you to it." And with a flutter of white lab coat and a soft click of the door closing, John is alone.
He had been picturing a run-down storefront with crystals in the window. Instead, he's facing an elegant limestone edifice in Westminster. There's a bronze plaque near the door that reads
“That's about the shape of it,” John agrees. His mouth twists. “I’m aware it doesn't make a lot of sense. This thing...
John scrubs a hand over his face. “You pickpocketed me. And got my address from my wallet. And let yourself in with my keys.”
“And I…what, just bathe in the sink and eat takeaway for the next week? It’s not that I’m not grateful, but—”
Now that he’s actually about to do this, face his fear and hopefully leave this mess behind, John feels oddly calm. He shouldn't be surprised, he supposes—he's always found it easier to focus under pressure.
That’s not one John has ever suffered from. As far as he’s concerned, the dark is a blessing. He sleeps.
dark, he notices. Light from the Archive is streaming in through the small window, limning the edges of shelves and filing cabinets. It's very quiet.
. He doesn’t know where the thought comes from, but he doesn’t question it. He trusts his instincts when it comes to
being so acutely aware of another human being’s presence. Or absence, in this case. Is this what Mycroft is referring to during his grumbled warnings about “sentiment”? Sherlock understands now why Mycroft is so against the concept. It’s a terrible distraction.
Looking at it makes his head spin and he shuts his eyes. But not knowing where it is makes him nervous, so he opens them again. Settles for focusing on the ground at its feet.
“Oh, take your timeline and piss off.” Sherlock looks past his brother’s shoulder, sees John standing in the storage room doorway. “You’re boring me, and John’s awake. See you never, hopefully.”
“Possibly, but…” Sherlock grins. “That’s Mycroft’s personal card. I’d put it to use before he notices it’s gone, if I were you.”
“I don’t know how long that will last. But I’ll explain as much as I can before Mycroft feels the need to interfere.”
Before he can second-guess himself any further, John pushes open the door and approaches the reception desk.
Sherlock looks over at John. “All right?” John nods. He’s still looking a bit shocky but visibly trying to pull himself together. Sherlock will give him the time he needs. He has a hunch that they’re both going to need their wits for whatever comes next.
"All right then, let me just set these down." She puts the tea mugs on the front desk and leads him down a hall lined with several doors. Most of them are ordinary office doors that have signs like “Employee Lounge” or “Storage Room.”
A feeling of vertigo, as though he might trip and fall forever into the endless black. It’s a familiar sight, a familiar feeling by now. But—something’s different.
John meets his eyes, his own face unreadable. He nods decisively, puts his hands on his knees, levers himself to his feet. He turns to the door that's appeared next to the bench, puts his hand on the knob. He looks back and meet Sherlock’s eyes with an expression Sherlock can only describe as determined tenderness, or maybe tender determination. It’s set and soft at the same time, and it breaks Sherlock’s heart a little. Then his face hardens so abruptly Sherlock wonders if he imagined it. He hopes not.
“You’re a lot less interesting than I thought you’d be,” the Spiral says petulantly. “I thought this was going to be fun, but you’re just
“Right,” he says, and John can’t tell which of them he’s talking to. “So those four, and I suppose we can throw the Eye in there as well, since you’re staying here. Actually…” He wrinkles his nose in annoyance. “My stupid brother
“In that case, Irene here will reach inside your pet and cut his heart to ribbons before you can blink. That’s what happens. And then I leave and let you wander around here alone …well, forever.” Jim smiles beatifically, spreads his hands. “You see? Not much of a choice.”
. The Web will continue to function regardless of your petty interference. I’m doing you a favor and giving you and Johnny-boy the chance to get out of the way before you get…snared…yourself.”
He is wandering the empty base in surgical scrubs. He occasionally opens a door or peers behind a building, but he knows it’s futile. That he’s all alone. Alone forever. That’s all right,
John sighs. "Might as well." He can’t very well stay in this oddly charming office with this oddly charming man forever, after all.
“And you started out asking so nicely, too,” John sighs. “I’m fine for awhile yet, but did you say there was a kettle down here?”
The air is cool on his face and he revels in the newfound ease of walking without pain, without that damn cane.
So. A malevolent entity beyond human comprehension has decided to trap John in its maze and make his worst fears come true—or at least, make him
The bars that had jumped in response to Molly's voice are still and flat as he speaks. When he pauses the recording and scrolls back to give it a listen, there’s nothing there but the sound of faint static.
So. John has disappeared, just hours after antagonizing one entity and aligning himself with another. Sherlock reaches out with his mind, tries to Know where John has gone, and gets only an impression of a nauseating swirling blur for his trouble. It doesn’t take a world-class detective
he thinks with savage triumph. Sherlock’s voice unspools smoothly in his head like one of those damned tape recorders.
He looks over on instinct, and there Sherlock stands in the shadow of a nearby building. His hands are in his coat pockets, his collar turned up. He looks unhappy. John starts towards him. “Sherlock, what the
She clicks the button and says, "See these bars here? They move when you talk so you know it's working. Every once in a while it gets a bit glitchy, so let me know if you run into any trouble." She pauses the recording and moves towards the door, tour over. "Take as long as you need and come find me when you've finished."
The tape recorder crouches between them like an elderly pet, humming away to itself. “Do we really need that?” John asks.
The thing hums, idly scrapes a fingernail along the pavement, leaving behind a deep gash in the concrete. “Very well.
Sherlock glances over. The woman waves at them again with her free hand, the one that’s not behind John. Her fingers now resemble spindly knives: cruelly pointed and entirely inhuman.
“Let me make sure I understand,” Ella says slowly. “You think talking about this thing will make you feel better...but you don't want to 'expose' anyone else to it. But you can't just, I don't know, write it down?”
Sherlock beams, oblivious to John’s irritation. “I thought you might want a few things, since it’s not safe to go back yet. Your gun’s in there as well.”
“It does feel that way, a bit. It’s killing me, all right." He unconsciously rolls his shoulder. "Finishing the job the bullet started."
John briefly conducts an internal inventory. “Well, when I was overseas, I always had patients to be getting back to. Not sure that’s what you’re looking for, though.” He pauses. “If I’m being honest with myself, it’s probably something like sheer bloodymindedness. Anything tries to drive me insane or get me to go gentle into that good night, I tell it to sod off.”
. He stops walking, slowly turns in a circle. He hadn’t noticed it before, but he’s the only person in sight. There are sounds of traffic in the distance—aren’t there? He starts walking towards the noise, more briskly this time.
“Nope, not finished.” John takes a deep breath, lets a little Captain Watson seep into his voice. “If you want me to cooperate with you on
last eat? You didn’t eat anything at Angelo’s”—he grimaces at the memory—“or after we came back. Did you have breakfast already?”
I can't help you out with your...spooky mystery shite. Now, you were going to help me out with a place to sleep?”
John isn’t at the restaurant, but Sherlock expected that. He knew John hadn’t made it that far. No, he’s standing here and looking at the upper third of the restaurant’s door handle because what the
He should burn it. Start a fire right here in the Storage Room and wipe his mind of all but the non-essentials. John is a doctor and (now) an archival assistant. He has survived contact with several of the dread powers. His eyes look dark grey in the Archives and vibrant blue in the sunlight.
(It doesn’t occur to John until much later that, despite Sherlock’s deductive skills, there’s no way he could have known John’s rank or regiment without asking. Or his middle initial, for that matter.)
“Oh, I—I didn’t mean to make work for you on your day off,” John says, embarrassed. “If you’d rather—I’ll be fine here ’til Monday.”
And then Sherlock sees it. A door at the back, near the lavatories. An ordinary wooden door with a plain white sign on it that says “Storage Room.”
John feels that itch in the back of his brain, the same as in the kitchen at Angelo's. The same as when Sherlock asked about the other times.
Sherlock’s sitting on the sand nearby, his knees pulled up to his chest. He is observing John intently, his features silver in the starlight. John’s brow creases. “Sher—”
He’s uncomfortably close to Sherlock by now, deliberately invading his personal space. The height difference doesn’t seem to faze him at all. He looks up at Sherlock and smirks. “So, my clever friend, can you guess why you’re here? Why I’ve arranged this little
John has been though a multitude of terrible and awe-inspiring and strange and (yes) spooky things in his almost 40 years on earth, and none of them make him feel the way he does while this man deduces his entire identity, from his relationship with Harry down to the damn psychosomatic limp.
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. “The paranormal rarely operates on a regular timetable, why should I?”
“I didn’t know what to do, so I sat down and pulled my jacket closer around me. The desert gets awfully cold at night, you know. That surprises a lot of people. The sand under me was cold too, although it should have still been warm from the day’s heat. But the sun seemed to have set a long time ago and it was quite dark already. It’s funny - the moon had been almost full the night before, but now the sky was empty. Except for the stars.
John brushes a few last buttery crumbs from his face. “You mentioned that one last night. What does that one do, again?”
It's not the most imposing building on the street, but there's nothing seedy about it. Maybe this wasn't such a terrible idea after all.
Molly leads him back down the hallway, stopping this time at a door with a nameplate reading "Sherlock Holmes, Head Archivist." She taps lightly on the door and pushes it open, ushering John inside.
Sherlock swallows, breaks eye contact, shakes his head as if to clear it. He uncurls at last from his dressing gown nest.
you wouldn't do for those precious Entities of yours.” His voice and hands are as steady as his gaze. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to lead you on a wild goose hunt. Be seeing you.” John turns back to the door, squares his shoulders, and then he's gone.
. He feels like a bug under a magnifying glass. Maybe that should bother him, but he had felt near-invisible since coming back to London. People either look right past him, or (like his therapist) ask him about things he doesn’t have words for. It’s strangely comforting to have his backstory read off without having to
John suspects this isn’t true. He glances at the clock on the wall and is shocked at how late it is. “Is that really the time? Don’t you close up at five?”
John smiles into the darkness. “That makes two of us, then. But maybe we can help each other figure it out. I suppose I can play lab rat a while longer.”
John takes a breath, gathers his nerve. “Would you—stay? I, I know this cot isn’t very big, but I think it might—help. I’ll try not to attack you in my sleep,” he offers, a weak attempt at humor.
John had written up Beppo’s case on his blog a few years ago. ‘The Six Thatchers’ he’d called it. Sherlock kept the knife as a memento. He’d even used it a few times to stab files into the mantelpiece, earning him scoldings from John.
Sherlock swept his thumb over his cheek in return, gazing down at him like he was the sun. “John,” he breathed, his eyes sweeping over every inch of his face.
“Wait, no!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. But it was too late. Sherlock yanked the oven door open, and a large puff of dark smoke erupted into the flat. An alarm blared as the three of them made their ways to to door, coughing into their sleeves.
John did most of the talking, trying to maintain the peace between the three of them. Though no matter how hard they all tried, the conversations would inevitably fade off into a stony silence until someone piped up and restarted the cycle.
“Sherlock… Sherlock…” John repeated in desperate pants as he crawled to the edge of the ship. His heart pounded steady and firm in his ears. Gripping the ledge, he pulled his entire weight up with only his wobbly arms.
John stared in shock as the other man’s face scrunched up in anticipation of rejection. He thought for a moment. He had nothing back home. No friends, no family. Not even a place to live. He wouldn’t really be giving anything up by staying here. Plus, being on this ship has been the most exhilarating adventure he had ever had.
John was stunned into silence. He had never considered that someone like Sherlock actually had a history, and could have been hurt. His heart went out to the man, and he became even more intrigued about his past.
John nodded along. His brain was on overload trying to memorize his each and every word so he could relay it to Sherlock. This was fantastic, he thought. Phil had a much more important role here than he realized.
"Oh, shut up!" She playfully slapped his arm and turned away shyly as John smirked at her. However, it wasn't  long before Molly exploded from excitement and launched into the tale of her evening spent with Greg. John listened patiently to her recounting of walks on the balcony, endless flirting, and laughing together by a cozy fireplace well into the night. He was surprised to hear that she never even got her first kiss with him. He was positive it was heading in that direction. In fact, Molly seemed unsure of whether their little evening was a 'date' of sorts or if Greg saw it as just two friends hanging out on off duty hours.
“God, Sherlock. Warn a man before you just spring something like that on him.” But he softened when he took in Sherlock’s vulnerable, waiting eyes. “Um . . .”
He scanned the club, but his height and the dim lighting made it difficult to see anything. After walking in countless aimless loops, he finally spotted Sherlock chatting with the host in a far off, darkened corner.
The endless uncertainty of Sherlock’s feelings for him chipped away at his sanity day by day, but he never left. He couldn’t face Sherlock again after so long until he had figured things out.
Sherlock blushed a deep crimson shade and accepted, allowing himself to be lifted and led to the center of their floor.
“I’m so happy for you, John!!” Harry cried, squeezing so tight he could hardly breathe. John chuckled and hugged her back for several long seconds.
After cases, they often came home and crashed in their chairs, listening to the crackling fireplace and drinking tea.
John hissed and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck. He was aching for it at this point. His hand joined Sherlock’s and together, they pulled harder and harder. They were both slick and leaking, almost ready to peak. The sounds created from their hands were bordering on obscene. John couldn’t stop his frantic noises, nor could Sherlock. It didn’t take long. Within minutes, hot, sticky, liquid was spurting between their bodies. John groaned into his skin while Sherlock inhaled in shuddering gasps.
"My family was quite well off growing up. Both my parents held impressive government positions and were widely known for their philanthropic and charitable work throughout the whole country. Mycroft and I lived with them and a large number of staff members and servants in our mansion." John grinned slightly at the prospect of Sherlock being a child once, but stopped when he caught Sherlock's expression. The man was still staring down at his hands in his lap, but this tale was clearly not one he was thrilled to be retelling.
On deck the next morning, John attempted to casually ask Sherlock where he was last night, perhaps sounding too casual. He suspiciously squinted down at him for a moment before looking away, his expression changing to sad and guilty. "Busy," was all John got out of him. Sherlock left him and stood up at the bow with Greg, purposefully facing away from John.
“No reason,” she said with a grin. John hated to admit a part of him actually was relieved he and Victor were no longer together.
He said, and the violet-haired boy physically reeled back at the comment, his silver eyes quickly shifting away from John’s after seeking his reaction at his brother’s words. “I calculated it to be unnecessary.” The ginger continued through the boy’s distress.
As the prince passed by the gathered crowd lining up both sides of the trail, his subjects made a vow. Graceful figures clad in the softest of fabrics reverencing down as an expression of loyalty to their new sovereign and coming back up in a strange dance. John approached to the front and grinned at Sherlock, the boy lightly bent his knees with an unwanted smile on his face; but as soon as the prince had passed the moment turned sour. When they started on this mission he had believed glory and a ridiculous amount of fun would be the only things they had in store, he didn’t anticipate the complete devastation John would make of his very insides, and now, the violet-haired boy was left standing as everyone else was still vowing down, a straight
He wondered if Sherlock even remembered everything that had happened last night. He had been way more drunk and was acting perfectly natural at the moment.
Across the room, Sherlock didn’t appear to be doing much better. He stood still as a statue with his flashlight pointed to the ground, like he couldn’t look away. John remembered how he had panicked when Moriarty strapped a bomb to that innocent child. As much as he liked to pretend he was above it all, he knew he cared. Particularly when it came to children. He almost wanted to go and console his friend. It seemed he didn’t even know how to cope with what was in front of him. How to process that someone could commit such inhumane acts.
John had always hoped those nights they shared together huddled close meant something more to Sherlock, like they did for him. That maybe he also enjoyed the intimacy of sharing body heat and discussing the day’s events in tired mumbles over the pillows. And that perhaps they were both unnecessarily taking advantage of these opportunities to be as close as possible.
“Sherlock,” he said, his voice wavering slightly. Sherlock lifted his head. For a moment, he seemed afraid he would be told to stop, but one look told him that was not the case. John gave him his best bedroom eyes, which he returned, and together they smiled from ear to ear.
“Oh, no. I’m as single as it gets,” he said quickly, trying to sound nonchalant when in fact, getting the words out felt like pulling teeth. Even uttering the word “single” had caused a brutal pang in his chest. With a tightening ache in his stomach, he once again pushed the image of Sherlock out of his head.
So when John saw the striped magnifier at some odd booth at a fair, he grabbed it, not even bothering to look at the price. He grinned remembering how Sherlock had lit up like a Christmas tree and starting taking it on every case immediately. John set that one aside. Sherlock would probably want it back.
“Okay, we’ll take it,” Sherlock said with finality. John was shocked, unsure of what detail could have changed his mind so quickly.
A razor-sharp, searing hot pain exploded in his side, as he fell forward. The blazing, fiery sting burned through his whole torso. His vision went black from sheer agony. He couldn’t see. He couldn’t think.
“Oh god,” he breathed, taking his phone out with trembling fingers and dialing Sherlock. “Oh god no. No, no, no.”
“It is my duty as captain to protect members of my crew like family. And seeing as I have failed in that-”
That was all they needed at the moment. Just each other. Each other’s presence. Each other’s arms. Each other’s steady heartbeats.
They both knew he had nothing to “catch up on.” He had spent the whole day watching the news and crap telly, and reading his old blog entries, bored out of his mind.
Sherlock simply stared back in question. No one ever paid him even the slightest bit of attention. Why would the rugby captain, of all people, care to do it? The boy grinned at him once more before returning his attention to his mates.
Even when they had all left, John remained tucked in his corner, his chest heaving as he tried to work out what just happened. What the hell had he just heard? What was the crew going to do now that Sherlock had no plan or objective to lead them on? They surely didn't seem too pleased about it. Even at the end, their suspiciously calm response still gave off a spiteful vibe. And they had called him lover boy, too. He knew most of the crew by now had at least inferred that they were more than friends, but to hear them explicitly state it left John feeling very uneasy.
He tried making his way to his friend, pushing past several people on the sidewalk outside of Bart’s. When they finally parted, he got a full, unobscured view of the dead body in front of him.
Okay, fine. Yeah, he admired Sherlock. Quite a lot, actually. The guy had provided him with the adventure he missed. And he was a pretty fascinating bloke. No one can deny that.
The absurdity of everything they had just been through caught up to them, and they broke out in a fit of adrenaline-fueled giggles.
Sherlock finished the letter, smiling fondly. He placed the letter and photograph up on the mantlepiece, tucked behind his skull. He then picked up his violin and perched it on his shoulder. Standing by the window, he gazed out at Baker Street before closing his eyes and lifting the bow.
This is alright, he told himself. They were just two friends hanging out late in the night and happened to fall asleep. No boundaries were being crossed. None that a certain ex-wife would disapprove of.
For the full experience, reread the dance scene while listening to the song! You won't regret it, I promise ;)
“Where is he? What the hell did you do to him?” he growled low into the phone, sounding much more confident than he was. He was already pulling his coat on and flying out the door.
When Sherlock was practically shaking, he pulled back. Crossing his arms at the bottom of his jumper, he made to remove it. But he moved too quickly, triggering a fiery pain shooting through his side. He winced and gripped his wound.
They both scooted towards the middle until they were pressed together from the shoulders down to their legs. Between the jumper, t-shirt, and their proximity, they managed share enough body heat to at least not get frostbite.
When he turned back around, he found his path blocked by two suited men. He held eye contact with them, waiting for them to move, but their feet remained planted. They stood shoulder to shoulder, blocking off any room for John to maneuver around them.
John sighed and looked away so he wouldn’t have to look into Sherlock’s wide, wounded puppy dog eyes. He was probably hurt that he didn’t want to accept his help. How could he explain to Sherlock what he was feeling?
The two of them sipped on their beers watching in silence. Before long, John had sent Sherlock to fetch two more. Sherlock began criticizing the cliché romantic tropes used in every other scene, huffing and puffing about how predictable and utterly boring it was. John snorted into his bottle hiding a smile.
“I see you were having a daytime drink?” he asked, gesturing to the partially empty beer bottle on the coffee table.
“YES!” Sherlock exclaimed. He turned on John, picked him up from his waist, and spun him in the air. “I am on a ROLL!”
With a suggestive smile, he guided his knees to rest atop his shoulders. Now with his head between his thighs, he gazed up at him adoringly.
Collapsed side by side on the pavement, they caught their breath and listened to the house continue to go up in flames. The soft crackles, the collapsing beams . . .
The corner of Sherlock’s lip quirked up just a bit, though the wetness in his eyes only welled up more.
“Why? I thought you had total faith in me and it was perfectly safe for me to be here.” With every word exchanged between them, his blood pressure rose and his suppressed anger at Sherlock boiled higher to the surface.
“Well at least I didn’t turn down a perfectly good opportunity for a shag because I’m ‘married to my work.’ I mean, what kind of pathetic excuse was that?”
“Aw, look at you two,” Mary taunted, looking down at Sherlock. “You know you can speak right? Or are you too enamored with your knight in shining armor?”
It doesn’t make sense!”  John refrained from telling him that there indeed was an explanation for everything, but not one Sherlock wanted to acknowledge.
His memory unhelpfully flooded his mind with images of them pressed against a wall in the dark room, thrusting against each other’s thighs. Sherlock kissing his neck, and him stupidly letting that word slip out of his mouth without a second thought.
John could tell that was all he was going to tell him for now. It wasn’t everything, but at this point he trusted that he would be filled in as they went along.
Behind them, Lestrade gave a hearty cheer and Molly giggled. John pushed deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, indifferent to their audience. Sherlock broke the tight seal of their lips and pulled back with much difficulty. “John,” he gasped.
“I liked having you sleep in my bed. That first night I was back. I slept better than I had in years.”
Jim threw his head back and laughed, startling her. “I made you into Mary Morstan. Don’t tell me you actually thought you could become her. I once was your life. And I still am and always will be.” He took her hands in his, dipping his head slightly to look into her eyes. “Remember what we once had, Annie?”
John sat and waited, but all he got for several moments was a prolonged stare. “I, um, wanted to… That thing that you did when I fell, that was um, good.”
Evening rolled around and Sherlock wasn’t home. But John wasn’t worried. He had probably just underestimated how long a case like this would take. In the excitement of it all, he wouldn’t be surprised if he had forgotten to text him.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to meet John’s, his pupils blown wide, his gaze pinning him to the spot. John realized he was waiting for him to make the next move. His devilish eyes dared him to break away, escape from between his arms, to reply to Mary.
Victor, Jackson, and Bolt, now clearly marked as enemies, proceeded to ambush their own ship.  Sherlock yelled over the shots for John, Molly, and Greg to run. Greg pulled Molly’s arm as they ducked for cover and ran together. John’s eyes lingered on Sherlock for a moment. After he screamed at him to leave him and run again, with much more ferocity this time, he obeyed.
Over the past several months, he had truly convinced himself he could rebuild his life with Mary. Forget her past. Raise their child. Move on. If he was stuck with her, might as well at least try to be happy.
“Bloody BASTARD!” John reluctantly lied down when his head was spinning too much to remain upright and slowly slipped out of consciousness.
John turned a corner, and a man bumped into him, making him stumble backwards. He whirled around, both catching his balance and trying to catch a glimpse of the man, but he had already passed without even a muttered apology.
Looking back through the hole, the smoke was almost too thick to see through, and fire was beginning to catch at the edges of the door.
Placing each one on a cut, he took the opportunity to run his hands down his chest again, making sure the gauze was secure. When the third one was covered, he pointedly didn’t remove his hands.
“John?” said the concerned voice softly. But he couldn’t reply. He continued to rub his face in an attempt to contain the tears. Maybe if he just ignored Sherlock he would leave. That’s what he was expecting after the way he treated him today.
At exactly 7 o’clock, John looked himself up and down in the mirror before going downstairs to meet Sherlock in the kitchen. He had shaved his stubble and styled his fringe back ever so slightly. His tuxedo and dress pants were a deep, rich burgundy with black lapels. Underneath the jacket, he wore a crisp, white button-down shirt and a slim, black tie.
He returned his attention to Stacey, gripped her hips firmly, and grinded against her like a teenager. She opened her mouth in surprise, and John smiled wickedly at her before snapping his gaze back up to Sherlock.
“It’s alright, John. You truly had no choice in the matter and you were only doing what you felt was best for the both of us.”
Now, Sherlock stood at the tip of the bow with his hands behind his back watching John mop from across the ship. He longed to explain and make things right with him again, but every time he made a move in his direction, the other man countered. After a few rounds of this silent dance, Sherlock backed off and contented himself with watching John from a distance.
Next was – oh god – John’s gift to Sherlock from their last Christmas together at 221B. A hand-made, yellow and black striped pocket magnifier. John knew he liked bees. He had about six encyclopedias on them as well as a poster up in his room. Not to mention that on the first (and last) time Sherlock was ever allowed to choose the film for movie night, he picked a bee documentary.
He then felt long, slender fingers slip under the hand he had resting on his knee. They interlocked with his fingers and squeezed gently.
“Well I think you should,” Sherlock found himself saying. John’s wandering eyes snapped back to him, and for a moment, he wondered if he’d just made a huge mistake.
He fumbled with it again only to find it miraculously worked again. He looked up into Sherlock’s now illuminated blue eyes and grounded himself in them.
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered, his voice cracking slightly. For a minute, neither of them broke the stomach-churning silence. They could only stare at it, accepting the fact that someone had killed a child and stuffed its body into a wall to decompose.
Sherlock nodded in understanding. Now that Molly and Greg were soon to be married, she had begun moving her things into his flat. That left Sally without a flat mate. Luckily, Sherlock and John knew just the right person in need of a place to stay, now that her criminal boyfriend was in prison.
With an uneasy pang in his chest, he realized that she meant to keep him in a state of eternal longing: allowing him to be with Sherlock but not be with Sherlock. The only alternative being a life without him at all.  It was the worst punishment.
Sherlock recoiled as if he’d been slapped. The rejection both pained and confused him in equal parts. He muttered a soft “no” and reached for the curtain. John waited patiently as he stepped out of the shower, slower than necessary, as though some part of him was waiting for an invitation back in. But the moment never came. Once he was out, John pulled the curtain all the way closed. Sherlock knew it was just for privacy, but it still stung like a cold shoulder.
That night, after night had fallen and the ship was silent, John cautiously tapped on the door to Sherlock's room. He slowly pushed the door open, peeking his head inside.
John groaned and fisted his curls. Sherlock kissed and kissed his nipple with pure adoration, stroking the other one with his thumb. After a minute, he switched and gave the right one the same attention. He licked and plucked at it with his teeth, all while his hands roamed firmly up and down his sides.
After some time, John noticed Sherlock had stopped eating and was staring him expectantly. He realized he’d stopped eating himself and was simply watching him in wonder (for who knows how long) with a stupid, cheesy grin on his face.
Molly joined him after a few moments, chatty and happy as usual. He avoided engaging in conversation with her as much as possible, adding in the occasional "Oh yeah?' or "neat" to her stories when it felt appropriate. But his mind was only on Sherlock avoiding him, and by extension, hiding things from him.
And next year, on the fourth anniversary of Janine’s death, John cleaned the house of all traces of alcohol and was prepared to be there for him in whatever way need be. But all Sherlock needed was a late-night cuddle and a bit of distraction. He had no urges to use and only scratched at his arms once or twice. It was still a dreadful night for him, but it was progress. And any progress was meaningful, no matter how small.
“Actually I, uh, had a pretty bad reaction last time I had Thai. I think I’ve developed some kind of aversion to the nuts in the sauce or something. Or maybe it’s the spices. I’ll just grab dinner somewhere else.”
Mycroft, meanwhile, refused to visit Baker Street without calling in advance several times. Especially after walking in on them one afternoon, John in his chair, Sherlock in his lap, naked from the waist down.
“John, look. I’m willing to let bygones be bygones. Yes, I lied to you. And yes, you quit because you were angry with me and allowed your emotions to lead you, as always. But you were a valuable worker, and I could use your skills where I’m headed. If you agree, I’ll tell you where to meet me, and we’ll leave together. Just the two of us.”
John leaned forward in his chair. “I really don’t appreciate you brushing off both my experiences and Josephine’s as if they didn’t happen.”
John shook himself out of whatever trance he had just entered and remembered the man’s incredible deductions from a moment ago. “That… was amazing.”
There was the first selfie Sherlock took (after John had showed him how), with a body at a crime scene.  Then the two of them celebrating Sherlock’s birthday at Angelo’s. Angelo stood behind them with one hand squeezing either of their shoulders. John was smiling like a normal human being and Sherlock sat with an almost intentional look of indifference. Behind that was a picture John had secretly snapped when Sherlock was laying on the sofa lost in his mind palace. He had looked so ethereal all stretched out in his posh, tailored suit, his pale hands steepled under his pointed chin. He couldn’t resist.
“I bloody hate it, if that’s what you want to know. I hate every damn day of my life I have to go back home to that . . . stranger.”
Once again relieved that they had been spared bringing a child into this world, he made his decision to pack up and leave once Mary had fallen asleep that night.
When John told her about the Magnussen case he and Sherlock were working on, she decided to take things into her own hands. She was astounded that she’d managed to fool Sherlock for this long, but with her information in that snake’s hands, everything could be ruined.
“Sherlock . . .” He blinked slowly, managing to stay awake, but barely. He had to fight for Sherlock . . . couldn’t die . . . not now . . .
He fumbled with the flashlight, but it stayed dead to the world. This was impossible. He had just replaced the batteries before leaving.
He released a single soft sob as quietly as he could, even though he knew his friend standing at his bedside could full well hear him.
“You’re wrong,” he said, practically panting with fury. The heat rose up through his body and reached his face. “And we’re not scared of you or Moriarty. There’s nothing you can do to us.”
What, did he think he was too weak and fragile to attend cases now? Did he think he was too out of practice and would not be able to keep up? Did he think he was so unable to take care of himself that he needed breakfast prepared and served to him on a platter?
A little breather before we jump back into the action! :)  Plus I figured it was time to deliver on the "comfort" part of hurt/comfort :P
John dumped his bags on the bed and headed back downstairs. Once in the living room, he found that Sherlock had prepared two cups of tea and had started the fire.
, he thought. John had shown a glimpse of vulnerability and he dove right in and took advantage of it. John didn't return his feelings. He probably didn't even think before initiating their first kiss. That's probably what he was trying to tell him before Sherlock cut him off. That it was a mistake.
Although John had been upset earlier that his evening out with Sherlock was not going exactly as planned, he decided now that the hunt didn’t matter. He was still spending time with Sherlock, who was still unconditionally enjoying every moment of their outing.
He rose and spoke to John, Molly, and Greg. “I brought you all up here so that you can witness me carry out the ends of my plan. And Sherlock, so you can see me have everything you worked for. While you just sit there. Because you gave up. Tie them up.”
John flipped up the collar of his jacket to protect his face from the wind’s bitter bite. With a quick glance at his watch, he realized he’d arrive home about fifteen minutes later than when he told Sherlock to expect him. Probably due to the fact that he’d missed the bus and had to wait for the next one to come around. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and quickened his pace. Hopefully he could cut that fifteen minutes down to ten or so. He didn’t want Sherlock to worry.
