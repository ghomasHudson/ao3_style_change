“Yes.” Cas says, flat.
The house is shockingly ordinary. It’s modest but inviting, two-up two-down from the looks of it. It’s not the kind of place where a hunter would rest his head, that’s for sure; his older self wasn’t joking about quitting.
Dean gives a thumbs up as his stomach churns and opening his mouth in this moment may just be tempting fate. He can only hope that with Castiel’s angel powers he’s faring slightly better (though he rather suspects that he is not).
“I sent him upstairs,” older Dean replies. “Has he eaten?”
Both pairs of eyes widen in shock, not faltering from their deadlocked stare, even as the keys slip from Dean’s hand and clatter onto the asphalt. Dean watches his own lips purse in a seeming irritation.
Castiel takes a dark green shirt from the hanger, folds it over his arm, then swiftly turns around to face Sam. “Hmm,” he ponders, his face genuinely pensive. “No.”
“Cas, that’s not exactly a combat technique, that’s just flair,” Dean says, haughty.
Castiel’s stomach is empty but he feels sick. Guilt is overwhelmed by responsibility. It doesn’t dull the panic any, but at least, before he, too, disappears from this world, he knows where he ought to go.
“Cool, okay,” Dean says, and raises a hand to the door to leave, only to pause and turn back. “You know, since Jo’s such a big fan o’ yours I don’t wanna make a bad impression. And ‘cause we’re gunna be working together. But, uh, if you don’t wanna talk about your past, that’s fine by me, but you can’t— If we’re supposed to follow you, we gotta trust you. And we gotta know you to trust you. Victor knows you, and I know Victor, so it’s not like you’re a stranger, but— just saying, you gotta let us in at least a little.”
“I got a message from headquarters asking for two of my best for a special assignment. I figure you two fit the bill, you got more exorcisms under your belt than anyone else here.”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Angel expert, huh?” he says, curious more so than impressed.
“Well I’m not gunna say no to that,” she says with a shrug, heading back upstairs to get out of her pyjamas.
Dean loses all concentration at that. The blade drops to the ground and Castiel simply chuckles.
“Both, ideally. Could be a two birds, one stone kind of situation,” older Dean says. “But priority is getting me back before we fuck up the past more than we already have. We can’t assume whoever did this is gunna be considerate enough to put me back.”
to take notes of course. That would be ridiculous. Eventually as the day drifts by into night and the air takes on a chill, Dean takes his leave. Dean seems saddened by their parting, and though Castiel is very possibly reading that wrong, he chooses to believe it to be the case. At least then the feeling’s mutual.
Bobby turns off the lamp as he leaves, leaving Castiel lying alone and wingless in the dark on Bobby Singer’s couch.
“Why? I got plenty of stuff for you to wear - mi closet es su closet, remember?” Dean tries not to sound so upset, especially at something so trivial that really shouldn’t bother him, but he doesn’t have as much control of his vocal cords as he’d like this early in the morning.
Sam enters, cautious not to look around too much lest he see something he’d rather not. He’s carrying a paper bag and a holder with three coffees perched in it, which he sets down on the table. “I got breakfast.”
“I— I don’t know,” he says quickly, raising his hands in innocence. “It’s one of my favourites, I just thought I would try to be nice.”
They arrive at Bobby Singer’s doorstep just after sunset. It’s a rickety old house, a good walk away from the nearest town by some poorly kept back roads. The boys had explained to Castiel on the way over who Bobby was to them— like an uncle or a surrogate father, when he got the chance. He is reliable and trustworthy, and he cares for the Winchesters deeply, which is all Castiel really needed to hear.
Sam crouches down and grabs Dean’s wrists, pulling his hands down and away from his face. “Okay, first of all you need to calm down,” Sam says, firm but gentle. “Take deep breaths, in and out—”
“Really,” Castiel returns, matching Dean’s flirtatious air. “I could show you a technique or two, if you’d like? You think you could manage?”
“That would be great,” Jo muses. “I’d send so many message to my mom.”
“Well those are some…
Dean’s panic drops immediately for indignation. “Finally?”
It’s probably smart on Dean’s part— keep Castiel close to make it harder for him to bolt in the night. He hadn’t yet made the decision to, he doesn’t think, but he’s certainly set a bad precedent for it.
.” Dean dismisses with a firm hand. Sam’s presses his lips together to silence his flowing emotions, but Dean clears his throat, making way for one last thing. “But hey, as long as we’re doing this sappy shit, I’m, uh, I’m really fucking proud of you.” Dean sniffles and clears his throat again. “Yeah, okay, we’re done with this.”
The older Dean clenches his jaw and glares at his younger self, there’s rage bubbling up in his chest and it’s on the tip of his tongue. He can’t, he just
“Are you insane? What the hell are you talking about, I don’t do that. And even if I did it’s not like I’d do it on purpose.” Dean’s voice is raised, his patience for Sam’s weird brand of psychoanalysis is waring thin, if he ever had any at all.
Back at their table Dean’s brightened up and tuned in. He’s giving Cas a taste of his own medicine with surprise thigh grabs that if anything are more violent than romantic since he squeezes with a vice grip every time. Although he does lean more into the romantic when takes a fry from his plate and feeds it directly into Cas’ mouth.
“I just won’t do anything, then.” Dean shrugs.
“Sam?” Dean leans over Sam, tentative. “You awake?”
“Why would you come back here?” Castiel snaps, an uncharacteristic impoliteness born of a shock and frustration.
“You told Jody first,” Cas retorts. “And you agreed that I was right.
anymore.
Sun-up comes early in the summer months, letting blinding light pierce through the gaps in the curtains and irk Dean awake. The awakening is stark, the air not yet warmed after having cooled overnight, the air heavy with hanging moisture.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs.
Dean turns to follow Cas’ eye-line, and lo and behold there’s Sam pulling into the parking lot. “Fuck. Shit.” Dean raises a hand in a signal wave. Cas smiles and waves too.
“Me and Cas?” Dean asks, before swallowing and nodding. “Yeah of course, me and Cas.”
“No,” Cas replies, his voice low and solemn. “I’m backing out.”
“And if he was alive, well, then he must have just left. Finally got sick of me and just left, And I thought, he doesn’t care about me, right, and god knows Sam doesn’t need me. So maybe it’s for the best that I go.”
Dean scoffs as he starts packing away everything back into the box. “Yeah, you never do.” He shuts the box. “It’s late. You should get some sleep.”
“2005,” Dean answers back.
Cas takes Dean by the shoulders and sits him down on the end of the bed. “Where does it hurt?”
you will; yes, they’re really real. I’ve met a helluva lot of ‘em. And they’re dicks. Mostly.”
Once the sigil is carved, Dean finds a stray tarp and lays it over the angel’s corpse, the only respect he can really offer here and now. He slips out and closes the doors behind him, taking a moment to gaze up at the clear sky, take a breath, and let the cool night air wash over him.
Older Dean opens the door and steps over the threshold. Dean follows, feeling a wave of warmth as he enters. He can hear the sound of clinking dishes and sloshing water from the kitchen. His mind instantly pictures a smiling woman in a sundress with pink rubber gloves who’ll come bounding over to plant a kiss on his older self’s cheek and gasp with melodramatic girly shock at baby Dean standing at her door.
Castiel scoffs. “Did you really think that worked? I’m an
“Yeah, that sounds like him.” Dean strolled up to Baby, un-belted Jack and pulled him up into his arms. “You miss me, kid?”
“I can heal you now, if that’s an acceptable amount of contact,” Cas says as he enters, dropping Dean’s duffel, which he had carried in from the car, onto the bed.
Dean brought a hand to his face, haphazardly rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “Yeah.”
Dean licks his lips, slightly perturbed by the statement that he and Cas
“I know,” Dean confesses, watching the steam swirl above his coffee. “I’m sorta in it now though. You can’t tell Cas I told you ‘cause then I owe him three hundred bucks.”
“No, yeah, I, uh… I just wanted to clean this stupid thing,” Dean says with a faux chuckle. He softens his grip with a long exhale.
“Oh, I didn’t say it was less dangerous,” Cas remarks cooly. “It’s just more possible. Trust me, even with the four of us, capturing a commander is not possible. Against an angel like that it’s kill or be killed, no room for third options. And in all likelihood it would be the latter.”
Cas passes Dean a furtive glance. “Yes, I— I have some experience with them.” It’s delightfully vague. Jo presses a palm to table and leans in.
Dean takes in what Victor’s saying, but doesn’t comment. Victor goes on. “I don’t know much about his past beyond that, you know, no one does. He’s never given us a surname, we don’t even know if ‘Cas’ is his real name. But I’ve worked with the guy for a couple years now, and he’s one of the best soldiers and strategists I’ve ever seen. He’s been offered command positions about a hundred times but he never takes ‘em, says he’s ‘not made for leadership’, which I think is a load of crap, but hey, can’t force the guy, right? And he may not seem like it now, but he’s a cool guy once you get to know him.”
“Dean?”
“Wait a sec,” Dean says quickly before Sam makes his exit. “How’d you know we were faking?”
“Okay,” older Dean turns his attention back to his younger self. “I’m gunna get someone to cover here tonight, you can come home with me.”
“Yes, it’s just… it’s nice…” Castiel says, bashful.
Dean looked away and clenched his jaw. Cas recognised his move as the classic ‘Dean Winchester knows he’s wrong but doesn’t want to admit it’.
“Good,” he repeats, making his decision and taking Cas’ face in his hands and kissing him.  There’s a desperate pressure, and an unthinking urgency to it. It’s messy, a little too hard and there’s no room the breathe, not that it matters since both are holding their breath.
If Cas were the same man, or angel, or whatever he is now, as he was years ago, he might have crumbled at this point, or run away, more likely. But whoever this man is, however he came to exist, whatever cruel trick the universe is playing, he cannot let it affect him. Things are bigger than they were then, and there are more lives at stake than just one man and his brother, and as much as Cas wants to curl up, to scream, to cry, he can’t. Because he has a job to do, one he actually gives a damn about.
“Good,” Victor continues. “So then, this,” he slides a sketch of a square tablet onto the table for them to see. “Is the demon tablet. It’s literally the word of God, tells us all sorts of stuff about demons and how to fight them. Only person who can read it is a guy called Kevin; he’s holed up at headquarters. We only got half of the thing, the rest is god knows where.”
“What?”
Dean frowns. This is the first he’s heard of this, for all he knew Sam was on the road to a perfect recovery. “Since when?” Dean asks, folding his arms, his voice tinged with parental concern.
Bobby’s house leads back into a thick brush which provides ample cover from prying eyes, if not a particularly straightforward route. Travelling off the beaten track has more disadvantages than anything, and there’s a reason it’s usually taken up only by the truly desperate. The forests are wild and untempered, messes of nettles and thorns reaching out across the ground in a treacherous web.
Dean looked over at Cas, surprised.
“You good to go? Dean and Jo are all ready.”
The answer is simple now, Castiel thinks. “Because I felt that it was right,” he answers plainly. “Because you deserve to be saved. Each and every one of you.”
Sam nods, a weak nod, his heavy lids already hanging half-closed as he slips into sleep. A deep, heavy sleep that Dean can hardly discern from death save for the sound of Sam’s breaths in and out filling the silent room.
At this Castiel finds his strength, scrambling frantically to lift his weakened and weary form from the blood-stained floor. “No, stop!” he demands. “I am the guilty party; I healed his brother of my own will, I am the one who betrayed my brother and sisters. I— I chose to lie with him. If we as angels cannot show mercy— show forgiveness to the sins of humanity, then we have truly lost our way. Execute me if you must, but let him go free,
Meg merely sighed since, yes, she did know. Her time spent with a much less filtered, and much softer Cas meant that she knew a lot more about the angel than perhaps anybody else.
Dean frowns at his older self, unsure as to whether he’s proud or ashamed. Still, he looks upon his future self with a certain reverence. He reminds him of his father in a way, even as he claims his divergence from John’s approval. Perhaps it’s the confident stance, the steady tone and gravelly timbre of his voice, the seeming assurance of someone who seems to fit into a mould of their own rather than trying to cram themselves into someone else’s. Dean’s shoulders feel heavy under the weight of all that leather, but his older self looks so… unburdened.
Dean chuckles nervously. “Yeah, no problem. It’s just a book, dude.”
“It’s fine, I—”
“Oh,” Cas says. “That’s good.”
Castiel remains baffled. He’d never considered himself a rebel of any sort, more so a defective piece in an otherwise well organised machine. He supposes he could see how Dean might make the comparison considering the characters in all the novels who stand up as a single voice against an unjust authority. However, that assumes that the authority is indeed unjust, and how can the host of heaven be unjust when they are the ones who determine what constitutes justice in the first place? Then Castiel’s opposition is not noble, it is at best misguided, and at worst it places him alongside the abomination, Lucifer.
“Hey, and me!” Sam cuts in. “You were just a lonely little guy.”
“Well, I told him that I had a situation,” older Dean says.
Dean watched the restaurant doors waiting for Cas to return, wondering where Cas really wanted to go that night. Cas was apparently this big romantic who liked stories about big gestures and lame gooey stuff like that. Cas liked to hold hands in public, Cas liked to kiss in public. Maybe Cas liked fancy restaurants too. Maybe he wasn’t doing enough to make sure Cas was happy.
He’s like a broken bone that’s never healed the same, or scar tissue upon scar tissue. His own older self seems kind of like that too, but at least that was something he’d expected to see. But seeing Sam like this is jarring. As much as his heart warmed to see Sam embrace his future self so eagerly, his heart also hangs heavy in his chest as he looks upon the inevitable result of his own selfish neediness.
He gets to it, wrapping his hands around it’s weathered gold bars for the first time. There’s a great weight to it, yet there’s an airy, ethereal feeling. He tugs— there’s a harsh clang. There’s barely an inch of give as the gate rattles in its lock.
“No, dude, it’s fine. You’re still recovering.”
Dean swallows hard, taking in this supposedly divine being who
Dean rubs his eyes lazily and swings his legs over the side of his bed and gently presses his feet into the cool wooden floor, rising silently. He shifts his sheets back into place before padding out of the room.
“What are you wearing?” Dean asked Cas, feeling like an insecure teenage girl going to her first party.
Dean takes a sip of his own drink. “So what’s your plan? Romantic duet at karaoke? Drag me to the men’s room? What’s your play here?”
They make short work unpacking everything, since most of their bags remain in the cart, only bringing out their food and bedding.
Bobby prepares a modest meal for the three of them (after the confirmation that angels don’t eat going something like:
“Not letting you off that easy,” he says.
Uriel is all business, straight-laced and straightforward. Any familiarity he once had with Castiel from their time serving alongside one another in the garrison has long faded, much like the respect of many of his former brothers and sisters in arms.
A wide, empty boardwalk painted amber by the setting sun, slipping over the horizon, basks a 26-year-old Dean Winchester in buttery warm sunlight. The air is cool and calm, a light breeze brushing over his cheeks. Like in a dream where one flits from place to place in a hazy instant; no journey, no decision, only destination; Dean finds himself there in the middle of the road with no clue how he got there.
“Uriel,” Castiel says, startled, his smile falling. “I wasn’t expecting to see you.”
“Still fine?” Dean says, voice a little quieter and breathier than he’d intended.
“So our strategy is to outsmart the angels?” Dean asks, incredulous.
“I can’t believe I never told you boys that story,” Jody says, wiping tears from her eyes as her laughter dies down.
“No,” Dean says, heart racing and mind reeling. He rubs a hand at the back of his neck. “No keep the money. I already lost anyway. I told Jody about the bet, and Sam said he knew we were faking the whole time.”
“Yeah, come in.”
Eventually, at Bobby’s behest, Castiel migrates to the upstairs bedroom. He suspects it’s more to do with Bobby wanting the couch available for him to drunkenly crash on than anything else, but regardless, Castiel obliges.
Eileen raises her eyebrows, but keeps her mouth shut. She turns to Sam and signs something that Dean can’t pick up with his still very limited range of ASL vocabulary (he’s been trying, but he’s not as good at learning stuff as Sam). Sam grimaces and replies with a dramatic shrug. Cas, who’s in the loop by way of his infinite angelic knowledge of language, looks to Dean with a blank expression. He turns to Eileen and signs something else.
Well, he ain’t Dean Winchester if he doesn’t know how to diffuse some tension. He reaches to the back seat and finds the box of cassettes exactly where he’d expect - he swears he sees a teddy bear down on the floor too - he picks out a tape and the rest of the ride is scored by Deep Purple.
“Yeah I heard,” Dean says, nonchalant. “There was an angel in town the other day. Maybe you know him, Azrael or something. Told me to be on the lookout for demons.”
“Hey, uh, Cas, you got a minute,” he murmurs to Cas, whose attention is fixed on a map of the area, pencil poised over the trails he’d been marking.
“Not guilty,” Castiel cuts in. His face feels hot, his blood alive and swimming like rapids through his veins.
Dean leans down off the side of his cot and spies the bottle. “Oh my god, you’re
“This is, uh, good bacon,” Dean notes, quiet, eyes darting tentatively between his plate and Castiel opposite.
“Well I gotta say, probably not your best decision.”
“Yeah well it’s a stupid one, and I’m not gunna let you make it.”
If demons are coming, here’s hoping they at least manage to take a few winged assholes down to damnation with them.
And he let the man go. He watched as the man stumbled away, clambering back towards the forest’s edge in a frantic escape. Now, as the day dawns anew, Castiel’s mind reels wondering where this man is now. This man that he spared, a life that may continue on for years, perhaps spawning new life and on and on, as the cycle of nature permits to lesser beings than he. He wonders what this man may achieve, how his life, allowed to continue on by
Finally, dinner is served. “Worth the wait, I’m sure,” he says gesturing his hands over the simply presented squares of lasagne on plates around the table. There’s homemade garlic bread in the centre of the table, as well as a side salad (ugh) that he made to appease Sam and has no intention of touching.
Dean’s pulse is racing, pumping adrenaline around his body. It’s not like Dean wants Cas to get aroused from sitting on his lap for his own personal gratification. It’s for the bet. But he does
The days eke on by, the late summer sun warm come evening, shining down in yellow gold tones. It’s one of the few things of which Castiel never tires. The comfort of the sunlight, the serene glow of the full moon, the patterns of the stars and the vivid colours of the flowers. They could never become mundane, and with little else to do Castiel spends day and night marvelling at nature’s wonders from this tiny patch of Earth.
“I want to win three hundred dollars.”
Castiel shakes his head fast. “There’s something else. There’s something….
“It’s like I said, he’s—” Dean clears his throat as he tries to talk while it feels like his airway is constricting itself. “He’s different, he’s good. He’s nice, I don’t know. I told him about you and about how you’ve been praying, and he said that he would answer. And he gave me some of his own grace.”
Castiel’s new wardrobe fits him to a tee. There are soft sweaters, occasionally layered atop a collared shirt. There are polo shirts that honestly have no business looking as good as they do considering Dean could never hope of pulling that off. He even has a heavy brown overcoat, like a winter edition of his classic trench.
Dean feels himself deflate, like a plug’s been pulled from him, allowing all the tension drain away, leaving him empty. He watches Cas leave, not able to form the words in his mind to express his disappointment in a way that doesn’t give the wrong idea. It’s not like he
“His name was Efram,” Cas adds, solemn. It’s not quite regret that Dean sees in Cas’ eyes, darkened now in his current state. He wouldn’t even be sure enough to call it guilt, but there’s a pain there that he recognises. Dean’s seen it before, in the eyes of his allies, and in his own eyes too. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d call it grief.
“This is-” Dean began, closing his eyes and smiling, lost for words. “I can’t believe I get to do this with you.”
“If I had to guess,” Castiel really would rather not guess, especially not when all his theories are so deeply terrifying. “I would say that while the blight was in your body, it bound itself to your very being and changed it, irreparably.” Sam’s expression goes from wary to outright horrified. “The change could be harmless, you may not even notice it. I suspect the headaches are as a result of your body adjusting to the change.”
“Dude, what the hell?”
“Aw! So cute! So you’ve been together a while then?”
different,” Castiel presses, turning his body towards Dean to look him in the eyes. Hoping, in his muddled mind, that his closeness and eye-contact conveys his sincerity. “Spending time with you isn’t frivolous.”
“Bobby, hey,” Dean cuts in. “Cas helped us. He
“So,” Victor starts, clearing his throat. “We’re gunna be working together again. I’m looking forward to it.” He turns to Jo. “And looking forward to working with you too.”
The purpose of the angels’ presence on Earth is, supposedly, to suppress the insurgent demonic threat. It seems that defending the lives of any individual human is purely incidental in pursuit of that singular goal. From a human point of view; angels are just kind of around— and they’re dicks and you definitely shouldn’t piss them off or get in their way, because most of them seem to have no qualms about doling out retribution as they see fit.
Dean winces. “Would it make you feel better if I lied and said I wasn’t?”
and he’s
Castiel flushes. “You didn’t have to do that…”
“Of course it does,” Jo says, snatching the blade back. “That doesn’t mean I have to be a dick about it. I just have to trust that if Cas and Victor aren’t telling us something, it’s probably for a good reason.”
Dean scoffs. “Yeah, sure.”
“You know what’s kind of weird?” Dean says, following a thread in his mind that his completely sober self would have cut immediately. “I didn’t feel… I didn’t feel embarrassed or weird about telling her. It was… chill.”
“Wait, but your son’s four?” she continued to work through her thoughts aloud. “Oh, is he from a previous relationship, or?”
“Yes, Sam is an excellent teacher,” Cas replies with a wry smile prompting an eye-roll from Dean.
“Why else would you keep coming back? I mean what could you possibly have to gain from this? You can’t possibly believe you have any hope of getting past me, and I could kill you as easily as breathe. Nothing could make a human take such an insane and stupid risk ad infinitum.”
The female angel, Remiel, pouts, but ultimately obeys. But they don’t leave. She turns back to Sam and presses two fingers to his forehead. In an instant he’s unconscious.
“Oh yeah?” Dean raises an eyebrow.
“It’s fine—”
“Dude,” is all his older self says in response. “We’re meeting Sam at the bunker later, so have something to eat and then we’ll head out.”
“Okay.” Dean presses his lips together into a line, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet for a moment. “Victor said you’re not a fan of personal questions. I get it. So, uh, sorry dude.”
“Did you break it up?”
“As long as you feel up to it, man,” Dean adds after he recounts the details of the case for Castiel. “Wouldn’t wanna put you back in the saddle before you’re ready.”
“What have you done to me?” Castiel laments, slumping against the wall, his wings drooping from his slumped shoulders behind him.
“You seen Cas?” Dean asks as soon as he catches sight of her.
“Morning, Dean,” Cas says, sliding a mug of freshly brewed coffee over the counter to him.
“What? You disagree?”
“Don’t go,” Dean croaks, grabbing onto Cas’ arm, digging his fingers into the fabric of his shirt sleeve, desperate to hold on. “Please.”
Dean pulled back and with a cheeky smile he said,
Dean stops dead, putting down the kettle he’d just picked up. “Ruby? Dude, you sure she wasn’t a hooker? I mean, no offence, but that’s a hooker name.”
“‘Cause we’re friends,” Dean states.
angels get drunk?”
“Hey no problem.” Jody starts picking things up too. “I put you two up in Alex’s room; it was the tidiest.”
He bleeds.
Sam grits his teeth and looks back at his brother, who just nods his head as if to say “Yeah, I know, right?”
“Because I bruised your fragile ego when I accused you of cowardice,” Cas says, sporting a shit-eating grin. “Don’t worry, I don’t expect you’ll be suffering for very long. I expect this is about to be the easiest three hundred dollars I have ever made.”
The next morning dawns not in streaks of glorious golden sunlight peaking over the horizon, but instead with a slow rise from black into grey. Dean awakes to the low pitter patter of the rain outside the cave.
“No, Sam, I didn’t go and make a deal with a demon!” Dean snips back. “Demons are the cause of this fucking problem, I’m not about to invite more of ‘em in, sheesh.”
“What do you know of the angel tablet?” Cas asks, straightforward, ignoring Efram’s derision. Efram’s face visibly twitches. Cas raises an eyebrow. “You know something?”
Dean is silent. He swallows down the lump in his throat. He’s never really thought about Cas in all this. He’s never really given it much thought at all, mostly just running on autopilot with reflexes drilled into him from wherever. But yeah, he’s never thought about Cas. Fuck, he should have been thinking about Cas.
Sara, who was seemingly the most composed of the four, shook her head, snickering at her usually timid and reserved friend openly thirsting for coffee shop guy. Tia was frowning, trying to string together a thought that was forming messily and incoherently in her slightly tipsy mind.
There’s a pause as Dean places a shingle and Missouri watches on with a concerned expression. “How is Sam?” she asks, softly.
“Yeah?” The man pushes himself up, undeterred. “Or what?”
“I already told you, there is no demon!”
about doing.”
“Awesome,” Victor says, stretching. “Then for tonight we can eat and sleep. We gotta have somebody on watch at night due to our location. Lucky for you guys, Cas has volunteered.”
Cas chuckled slightly at the suggestion; it’s the type of wishful thinking Cas had learned to disregard a long time ago.
I would love nothing more than to leave this godforsaken wall behind for an evening and meet your brother. But I
). Today though it’s mostly just something to keep his brain fully focussed and discourage wandering thoughts. Finally he heads to the sink to wash up.
Dean’s eyes widen. No witnesses. He waves his hands frantically in front of Sam to garner his attention. “NO!” he mouths.
“Yeah, this stuff packs a punch,” Dean says, rubbing his eyes lazily.
“When exactly?” Castiel asks, acutely aware that there have been various instances in the last few weeks where Uriel dropping by unexpectedly would have dire consequences.
“Yeah, sure y’are,” Bobby says with a scoff. There’s a sad look in Bobby’s eyes, and he keeps passing furtive glances in Castiel’s direction, making guilt and panic flare up in Castiel’s heart every time. “So…” Bobby begins apprehensively. “What happened? You said— you said Sam and Dean are gone. What, uh, what did you mean?”
Cas meets his worried gaze only for a moment before turning away from it, the way one might turn away from a bright light. “I’m fine,” he says. “We should go.” He pulls away from Dean’s hand and begins to lead them back on course.
Meanwhile Sam greeted Cas with another hug. “You unpack everything yet?”
“Hey, I don’t get a lotta free-time, I don’t have the luxury of fucking around,” she says with a confident shrug.
“Dean, Jo, come on, let’s give Cas some space,” Victor orders calmly, ushering Dean and Jo out of the barn and closing the doors behind him.
Dean blinks at such sincerity, delivered with such exasperation. “Cas, what are you talking about you’re-” His lips start to form another syllable, but all that comes out is air. There’s a million different ways that sentence could end. Cas is amazing, he’s badass, he’s the only person outside Sam that Dean trusts. He’s funny (in his own way), he’s caring, he’s beautiful, he’s ethereal, he’s everything, he’s
“Maybe,” Sam sighs. “I really don’t know. That’s what you did, and that’s really what you wanted. You were tired, I think. Tired of fighting, tired of losing. Thing is, the most important thing to you has always been family. You were always the one trying so hard to keep us all together. For a long time family meant hunting. Then one day, family meant something else. So you stopped.
like an angel. You just look like… a guy.”
“So—” Dean starts after clearing his throat.
Victor is eager to get going that very day, and Cas is in no position to argue. Just this morning Cas too had been all in favour of kicking off this mission as soon as humanly possible. That is, before he was thrown completely for a loop.
Meg shrugged
“Gee thanks, heal the one I couldn’t even feel,” Dean says with an eye roll.
Sam sighed. “Yeah well I don’t know if we’ll get the time.”
“He texted me that they were twenty minutes away, uh…” Dean looked back at his phone, squinting a little due to his slight far-sightedness. “Eighteen minutes ago.”
“Burst water main.”
Castiel hands the first book back to Dean. “I assume then, that you’ll also want this one back?” he asks, sporting a knowing smile.
The walk back from the edge of the angels’ citadel is long. The sun, which had only begun to set as Dean turned tail, has now dipped wholly over the horizon, leaving the world entrenched in darkness under a star speckled night sky.
“Yeah?”
“No, Dean. I could have— I could have tried to resolve the situation. I could have confessed to what I did sooner, absolved you of any crime. Then maybe— maybe they’d only want me.”
“Only thing that can kill an angel. And pretty much anything else for that matter. Notoriously hard to come by, so don’t lose them,” Victor warns, stern. His cautions fall on deaf ears as Jo takes one from the case and holds it gently in her hands, stroking its length with a stunned reverence. “You guys are pretty much here for extra muscle. We need people who can face up against an angel and maybe not die. Cas is here for that too, but he’s also our resident angel expert and second in command. You report to me first, then him.”
Cas sighs. “I just wanted to push your buttons a little bit. I never wanted to cause you genuine distress.” Cas runs his thumb back and forth over the back of Dean’s hand. “We can just quit, forget the money.”
. Just for a few hours?”
“Pfft,” Dean narrows his eyes. “You just have a crush on him.”
Most days at the wall pass the same way. The sun rises in the east and Castiel sits in shadow,  the birds will wake and fill the air with the sounds of their song. As the hours pass, the sun slowly moves him into the light, the forest canopy gleaming in emerald, the butterflies and bees make their rounds, their bodies fluffy with yellow pollen. As the sun begins to drop, its beautiful amber glow filters through the trees casting speckled shadows over the canvas of the wall behind him.
He’s covered in dirt, sweat, and demon blood. He’s exhausted and there’s a cot with thick blankets and his name on it waiting for him just through the mess of tents and cabins. That’s all Dean can think about when he staggers in through the heavy iron gate with Jo in tow close behind.
“Right,” Sam nods. “Does Cas snore, or?”
“Are you the big spoon or the little spoon?”
One glimpse of Cas in his boxers compels Dean to take him by the waist and walk him back until he can fall comfortably back onto the bed. Dean clambers over him, placing a kiss on his lips as appetiser, then his jaw, feeling his stubble rough on his lips. He moves down to his neck, hearing Cas’ breath catch and feeling his throat work as he swallows his excitement. Cas wraps his arms around Dean as he trails kisses down his neck, to his collarbone, his chest, his stomach.
“You want to what?”
Castiel stares back blankly. Dean sighs, frustrated. He places his hands at either side of Castiel’s face and looks him dead on, giving Castiel something to square his focus on. “Cas,
Sam pulls Dean into what feels like a bear hug. He’s not that much smaller than his future self, but in Sam’s hug he feels tiny. He can barely register anything that’s happening, only managing to half raise one of his arms up in a weak attempt to hug back.
Just as Dean sits himself opposite, Sam strides in, a little sweaty from his morning run. He makes a beeline for the sink and begins to fill up his waterbottle, tossing his head round to Dean and Cas as he waits for it to fill. “Oh, Cas, new threads?
“No, no, I just don’t think it should be off limits. But fine,” Cas concedes. “I wouldn’t want to make you
Cas swallows and wipes his eyes. He runs his hand over the cover. “I’ve read this one before,” he says, voice soft and low. “A long time ago. It will be nice to read it again. Thank you, Dean.”
“Rise and shine, Sammy,” Dean says, trying for energetic but landing on limp and dejected. “Have a good night?”
“That was Hunger’s influence.” Cas justified, his hand resting on the top of Jack’s head as Jack clung to his leg. “If Jack gets hurt I’ll heal him.”
If angels could cry, Castiel thinks that he would now as he looks upon Dean’s sleeping form one last time. Gently, so carefully as if he were handling delicate porcelain, he brushes a hand over Dean’s cheek, the rough texture of stubble comforting against his skin. He leans down and places a kiss at Dean’s other cheek. Reluctantly he pulls away, his throat tight and his heart heavy.
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Uh, no, but I think it’s probably too much for
“Okay, Cas,” Sam says, nodding at the collection of ingredients in a silent review of their correctness. “The spell should power you up for twelve hours.”
Cas remains silent, staring the angel down, just waiting. If there’s one thing being an angel taught Cas, it’s patience. It seems many angels have forgotten that in war, where things often move so quickly. Cas may not have his wings or his grace, but he holds the room, and Efram knows it, and if angels could sweat, he would be at this very moment.
Cas opens his mouth briefly, but shuts it again, pressing his lips together, bringing his brows together tight. “More or less, yes.”
“Angel shit?”
Dean shrinks into himself and bites his tongue, eyes focussed down once again. He wants to argue, he feels like he should. But what’s the point?
Cas looked over at Dean, reading his micro-expressions like a book. “I do.” he said firmly, reassuringly.
Dean laughs. “Cas, I’m just teasing,” he says, offering his hand out again and letting Castiel, pouting all the while, lean into it. “‘Sides ’s kinda nice. They’re soft. You got feather conditioner or something?”
“So you’re saying I need to try harder?” Dean nods. “Okay, lemme think on that and I’ll get back to you.” He flicks the excess water from his hands at Cas before walking out to join Sam and Eileen.
The group nod and begin their trek through the dense thicket. It’s an overgrown mess, wild and untempered. There are no paths here, not even those made out by frequent hikers, instead forcing Cas in the lead to be constantly pushing and cutting back branches and weeds.
“You would lower yourself to the likes of humanity, Castiel,” Naomi says, pitiless. “It only seems fitting.”
“Woah, hold on,” Sam holds a hand out to stop Cas as he starts for the door. He presses his lips together and sighs, his brother’s weird fetish be damned. “If you don’t wanna wear Dean’s stuff we can get you something else to wear.”
The citadel is clean and orderly in a way that the outside world is not. The world outside the walls is huge, open and chaotic, and in that way it’s teeming with life and opportunity. The city of angels is, like angels themselves, immortal, eternal, and unchanging. It’s lifeless, dead.
“Angels read many things,” Castiel answers quickly. “We keep extensive records.”
Dean signs
Eventually, he starts to move, stepping forward like he’s pushing through cement with every step. He finds his older self flitting around the kitchen grabbing plates, scooping out cold lasagne from a large dish.
on duty. Right here and now, there’s a man in front of him with green eyes sparkling in the twilight and a smile that draws him in and makes Castiel forget himself and he could say no, easily, but he really doesn’t want to actually.
The two shared a laugh.
“Yes.”
Barnsend is lot more peaceful and friendly than one would expect for a town located where it is. If demons were to attack the citadel, there’s a good chance they’d decimate the place just by passing through. And if the angels ever decided to expand the little bubble of uninhabited, heavily patrolled land they’ve got around the citadel, Barnsend would be first on the chopping block.
“Oh my god, Tia,” Sara shook her head. “Did you know he was married?”
“Watching someone sleep is not as fascinating nor revolutionary as pop culture would have you believe,” Cas snorts. “I heard Jody was awake, so I went to ask if she needed anything.”
Apparently Castiel’s angelic instinct hadn’t been drowned all the way out, as in a moment, Castiel’s hand has a vice grip on Dean’s forearm, in which hand he’s got a hold of Castiel’s keys. Castiel levels a look at Dean. “Did you really think that would work?”
They don’t travel far in the dark, stopping on a forest path just a few towns over. Down a less travelled path they find a small cabin. Dean knows better than to ask who this place belonged to, opting to leave these ghosts undisturbed.
Older Dean raises his eyebrows, like he knows a thing or two, which of course, he does.  His 26th year was quite the whirlwind turning point in his life. It’s not that much of a surprise that if someone or something wanted to meddle with his timeline, they’d pick that year.
“I don’t think so.”
Cas grimaces. “I didn’t say safe for
Dean is, in fact, up in about a minute. He saunters into the kitchen only to stop dead in his tracks with disbelief plastered on his face. “Um, what are you wearing?” he asks, shocked, affronted.
“I want you and your brother to be safe.”
Dean rolls his head to the side, Sam’s blurry figure phasing in and out of focus before settling. “I had half a bottle of Crazy Jim’s,” Dean grumbles, hoping to God he actually said the words he thinks he said. He seems to be experiencing a hangover while still being drunk from the night before. A stellar combination if ever there was any.
“Dean,” Pastor Jim starts, his voice low and earnest. “Your dad put a lot on your plate asking you to look after Sam— I know you practically raised that boy. But Dean, you got to look after
Cas’ face screws up in surprise and bafflement. “What?”
Dean laughs, an honest laugh, as he allows himself to be taken away from his own romantic woes. “Atta boy, Sammy.”
“Hey man, you grabbing something?” he asks as greeting.
Dean inspects his forearms. “Ah crap, looks like I been in a fight with a house cat. Must’ve been the weeds, they were kinda thorny.” Cas takes Dean’s forearms without a word and heals them one at a time. “Thanks, man.”
“Charming,” Dean snorts. Cas catches himself in a snicker, before he remembers himself, and returns to hauling bags over to the spacious kitchen table where he begins laying out a marked up map of the area.
Dean sits silent, taking in every word. There’s no spite in his words, no anger, no regret. “Why?” Dean asks, quiet, almost in a whisper. “Why don’t you hate me?”
“No offence, but you don’t
“I know you know. Look, I’m just saying, you’re sick, so let yourself be sick and focus on getting better.”
Dean is still stood awkwardly by the counter, notably separate from the family unit. He feels like an interloper, like he himself is the elephant in the room, but Cas gestures at him to sit down, so he does.
With that the older Dean is gone. Cas sighs, sending a look of pity Dean’s way before following suit. Dean sits there at the table for a moment longer. So his older self hates him. Well that’s something they do have in common.
Dean huffs out a long breath before he answers, “We don’t really know. We have no idea how or when he actually got blighted— I mean as far as we know he’s never been within six feet of a demon. And for years we knew something was wrong with him but we didn’t know what it was. He started showing more definitive symptoms when he was ten. Didn’t start getting
“So you don’t get your clothes dirty when you’re baking.” Cas answered, his voice genuine and sweet.
They do in fact shower and change, and they do feel better for it. While Cas is still ultimately unenthusiastic about the whole plan, citing the human body’s need for ample recuperation time after strenuous physical activity, he is ultimately convinced by whatever part of him let Dean put him in a cowboy hat the last time he was newly resurrected. Sam is not so easily swayed and outright refuses to come.
“Really?”
“I said don’t watch me sleep,” Dean grumbles, half directed into his pillow.
Jack is left with a neighbour when the three of them head off, with Dean relegated to the back seat as he’s clearly several rungs below Cas in future Dean’s pecking order. The drive is short and leads them to what looks like an empty back road in the middle of nowhere. There’s a door tucked into the side of the road that looks like some kind sewer entrance that workmen might use.
“Angels eat human food or what?”
“Okay,” Dean spoke softly, quietly so that the stars might not overhear. “Just us. And I promise one day we’ll do date night your way.”
Dean gets to work in the kitchen and Cas, with nothing else to do, leans on one of the counters just watching him work. “I missed you this morning,” Dean says without thinking while whisking. Hm. He attempts to rephrase, “I mean I was kinda surprised you weren’t there, watching me sleep like the creep that you are.”
“No, nothing like that,” Castiel hums. “But my wings haven’t gotten much use lately, so they’re practically good as new.”
Sara gasped. “That
There are letters from Bobby, too. The messages are shorter, but he always signs off he same way, with a promise;
“Yes. I bet you a hundred dollars that you couldn’t last two weeks.”
“You know what I want,” Castiel says weakly, unable to meet Dean’s eye.
to scrub it out, could he let that muck stain his psyche ever again.
“Because-” Dean falters, his brain falling short when he needs it most. He
Castiel smiles. “Yes, for the low price of forsaking my duty and betraying my people.”
“It’s just…” Jo dips her head to the side and back. “You seem like you’re in one of your defeatist moods.”
“There’s no need to pore over reports,” Cas says cooly, running his hand over the sheets of paper spread across the table. “I know what we need to do next.”
“Yeah, you too.”
“What compels the two of you to buy so many nearly identical shirts?” Cas asks, pulling a red plaid sleeve towards himself, feeling the rough fabric between his fingers.
They enjoy helping out though, it’s never a chore when it’s for family. Jody pops out every now and again offering Dean a fresh glass of water or something to eat, but for the most part he powers through in the back yard by himself. God, that yard’s been neglected. It’s a good thing Cas didn’t see it before Dean started working on it because he may well have fainted.
Dean mumbles out an approximation of the words ‘thank you’ then drags himself up with great difficulty to take the painkillers. The tonic is syrupy in all the wrong ways, and definitely requires Dean to follow up with
Castiel can’t be sure what he looks like in that moment. Bloody, for sure. But he can barely feel his face, although it’s pretty likely he’s wearing some pathetic distraught expression if the way Bobby’s face twists and sinks is any indication.
Dean works his jaw to try and work his frustration out before he says, “Yeah, well I don’t mind. There’s your proof.”
Dean closes his eyes and swallows, accepting the answer he’d known had been lurking in the back of his mind for god knows how long. “Yeah,” he says. “I want that.”
loved, was the best feeling in the world. While for many years he absolutely couldn’t have admitted it, it was one thing he’d always craved; to be held, to feel someone’s warm skin against his own rather than scratchy, questionably clean motel bedsheets. The safety and comfort that he hungered for, that lead him to sleeping with one hand on the trigger of a gun, now took the form of the angel snoozing beside him.
“Sleeping here tonight?” Dean asks, keeping casual.
They alternate rounds throughout the night. Dean goes up for the next one, waiting with one arm leaning against the bar while the bartender fusses with all the various ingredients for Cas’ horror concoction. He hasn’t started on Dean’s whiskey yet, and a mild alcohol buzz he lets curiosity get the better of his shame. “Hey barkeep, can you make that two and forget the whiskey?”
“I’m not saying I go out there with you, just—” Sam slumps his shoulders. “If there’s anything small, anything you can bring back here, I don’t know.”
Dean presses his lips into a line and nods. “Right,” he says, skeptical. If any of that were true, then Castiel wouldn’t have been so antsy about Dean ‘testing’ him, or whatever crazy thing he convinced himself of. Nor would he have made Dean swear to secrecy when he handed him his grace. Whether he admits it or not, Castiel’s a
Dean sits back down with a small box, pulling out a cloth and dabbing it with some alcohol. “Patching you up.”
Dean stumbles as he finds his footing. His other self strides in after him and pulls out a silver blade. Dean holds up his hands, notably unarmed himself.
In a moment, Meg was struck in awe as a blinding light began to shine from behind Cas. Slowly, she rose from the floor. Noticing this, Cas got up too and turned around to face the light.
Yet when he looks upon the gate yet again, Castiel is gone; the gate is unguarded. Dean’s eyes widen as he slips through the foliage only to spy in the corner of his eye— the overwhelming shadow of black wings beside him, blacking out what little light filters through the canopy.
“Because then you and Sam would be safe.”
“I only woke up a couple of minutes ago,” Sam says, gaze not shifting from the window. “We’re inside the citadel.”
Dean nodded, eyes never drifting from Cas’s. They each pulled their hand away at the same time, eyes still locked, and broke into a soft laughter.
“Yeah, you too,” Dean says, voice low. “Thanks for everything, Bobby.”
benefit from a little angelic strength. Dean’s contracted into weeding duty which is just about the worst job on Jody’s little list, not least for the fact that he doesn’t get to watch Cas carry heaving things around as if they weigh nothing. Which is fun to watch just because it’s cool how strong he is,
“I mean, Cas wears one shirt, washes it, gives it back, then you wear that same shirt,” Sam says, fingers pointing along an invisible line of cause to effect. “Considering the amount of stuff you own- I don’t know it seems like something you’d have to do deliberately.”
Dean abandons the bookshelf and joins Jo deeper in the shop. “What do you mean?”
The flames grow quickly in the presence of the accelerant, and the robes burn easy. It takes only a few minutes for them to blacken, char, and shrink into ash. All the while Castiel watches, transfixed by the flames. He presses the closed lighter into his body, gripping it tight, feeling every scratch in the metal case.
They get into the Impala, which Dean had already brought around front in preparation. Cas doesn’t try anything on the drive there, which is a little foreboding. He also doesn’t tell Dean where they’re going, only giving directions as they drive. Eventually Cas gives the last turn off and they pull into the parking lot of… a bar.
“An actual one? Not just memories or whatever it is you get?”
“It’s where- you know what, never mind. So what, we pretend to be a couple for two weeks or until one of us cracks?”
“Alright, I’m gunna head out and get some grub,” older Dean says, pushing himself up from his seat and grabbing his jacket off the back.
No real warnings for this chapter
Dean takes a moment to process the thought. His gaze drops to his hands as he fumbles with his glass. “Wow, that- that’s… I don’t know.” Dean takes a sip. “Dad okay with that?”
It's date night and Dean is anxiously awaiting whatever Cas has planned for the two of them.
Dean opens his mouth to protest, then sighs. “I dunno,” he shrugs. “Dude, you’re literally always here, don’t you ever go on break?”
“It’s okay,” Dean says again. “I’m sorry I overreacted. Just warn a guy next time, yeah?”
“Yeah, maybe,” Dean sighs. “But, I mean, I’ve already been spoiled on enough of my future, so what’s the harm, right? I dunno, I guess it just seems so far away from the Sammy I know. You wanted out, man. Bad. I really thought that, you know if I even made it this far, that I’d be the one hunting and you wouldn’t want anything to do with me anymore.”
“Dean, it’s been a long ass time,” a familiar voice comes from the doorway. “Good to see you haven’t changed.”
“Azrael and Loriel are confronting them as we speak—” Zachariah continues, joyfully salivating at the thought. Castiel can’t bear to hear the end of it, he shoots off into the air like a bullet, Zachariah’s startled shouts after him a distant murmur in less than a moment.
Dean groans at the sight of the tiny, single-spaced text that lines the pages of the book in front of him. “Cas is an angel, isn’t he supposed to have, like, fifty thousand of them?” Dean retorts.
Dean sighs. “Yeah… I dunno. Something’s just felt… off this whole time. I can’t put my finger on it, just feels weird.” He reaches over to take the letter opener from Jo. “You can’t say that all the secrecy, the way Cas does things, that it doesn’t bother you at all?”
“I dragged you back in, didn’t I?” Dean continues. “Before I got zapped here I- I was thinking about going to Stanford to get you. I did it, didn’t I? I took you away from your normal life and brought you back in and I ruined your life. I don’t get it, how are you so zen about all of this, saying all this crap about helping people. All your life, you wanted out. The whole time. It’s my fault you’re back in it so why don’t you hate me?”
“It’s better than looking like I live at a truck stop,” Cas snips back.
The whole house smells nice, actually. It’s not like it’s scented; it doesn’t smell like flowers or air freshener or candles or anything like that. But the kitchen smells like home cooking, and the living room? Well there’s a scent in the couch cushions that’s enveloping Dean as he snuggles into it. Dean can’t quite put his finger on it, but it smells homely, like, and he feels stupid as hell for even thinking it, but it smells like love, like family. It kinda smells like that Cas guy…
Dean releases Cas’ waist and tuts audibly as he walks back towards Sam. “And you said you weren’t even hungry.”
“No I don’t,” Cas snips back. “What I mean is; you’re good enough as you are. You’re certainly good enough for me, I mean I’m no prize peach.”
“Yes, that does carry some uncomfortable connotations.” Cas agrees with raised eyebrows.
“Yeah,” Dean says, quiet. “It’s cool of you to, you know, be gay and not ashamed or whatever. Makes me look kinda pathetic that I freaked out over just pretending.”
Cas nods slowly, his smile still sly and mischievous. “Okay,” he says, tapping his fingers on the table, nonchalant. After a few more minutes where Dean avoids continuing the conversation by checking his messages from Sam, Lucy returns with their food. “Thank you,” Castiel says with a smile. “Oh, and I just wanted to say, we
“Thank you Sam,” Cas says, picking up the coffee Sam slides towards him. “We definitely worked up an appetite.”
Dean aggressively ruffles Sam’s ridiculously long hair as he passes behind him. “Aw, you take such good care of me.”
Castiel pauses, then answers, “Naomi. The angels.”
“That’s my line,” his clone says flatly. “Get in.” He gestures to the door from whence he’d come. Dean scans the storefront - it’s a bar, an empty one by the looks of it.
he does,” Dean whips out in a derisive tone. Jo rolls her eyes and Dean adds before she can cut in, “I’m not saying he’s not a good soldier, I’m just saying it kinda seems like shit’s been blown way out of proportion.”
“He probably got flustered because he was at
Cas is there at 7:30 on the dot, keeping time immaculately like he’s got some kind of perfect angelic body clock. “Are you ready?” Cas asks, the question loaded.
“Of course,” Castiel says, offering his best smile before retreating up to bed.
fighting a war, you know.”
“Do what you have to,” Dean says, assured but with an air of defeat. “I can’t stop trying.”
“No, no, actually, this is okay, I can work with this,” Dean says, settling down. “You can’t break the rules or your forfeit. So,” Dean crawls over the bed to where Cas is sitting and tugs Cas by the waist until their faces are inches apart. “I just gotta make you really,
Cas almost stumbles back. He grabs onto Dean’s sides to steady himself. He pulls back just a fraction to take a breath, then dives right back in, digging his fingers into Dean like he’s trying to claw even more out of him. They stay there in the laundry room as time surely passes around them in the rest of the world. They wouldn’t know, as the only markers of time gone by is where they position their hands on each other; Dean’s fingers skirt Cas’ jaw, Cas’ hand slips under Dean’s t-shirt running over his skin, Dean’s hands paw at Cas’ waistband, Cas’ hand grabs Dean’s neck to hold him close and steady. Dean’s jacket sits to the side, dry now, long abandoned and holding no real estate in his mind at this time.
“Dude, there’s nobody around. You can drop the pretence.” Dean takes a deep breath shuffles his feet as he repositions himself against his car.
“Okay, so what I’m hearing is that we definitely need to get out of here.” Dean rises, biting his lip and surveying the room. “Sam, grab a weapon, we gotta go. Now.”
Cas tilts his head and squints at him. It’s piercing, like his glacial blue eyes are cutting into his soul. Intense. His older self just looks at him, frowning in confusion.
Jack sniffled then nodded.
Dean sniffs and nods, regaining his composure and raising up typical cool exterior. “I, uh, got you something. Y’know, to say thanks.” Dean’s rubbing one hand against the back of his neck as he sheepishly presents the book to Castiel.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Oh? Uh… how?”
The couch is decidedly softer and more comfortable than any motel bed Dean’s ever slept in. There’s no weird draught, nor is it sweltering hot. The blanket is soft, clean, it smells nice. So much so that Dean can’t help but draw it up to his nose and just breathe it in.
“Dean, please,” Castiel jumps in again. “You and Sam should just get somewhere safe. That’s what matters.”
“Somewhat similar, yes,” Cas admits. “Though angels must obtain their vessel’s consent.”
Cas obliges and first works Dean out of his jeans before freeing him of his boxers. He sheds his own before climbing back over him, continuing the kiss. There’s a pang of pleasure every time Dean brushes against Cas’ thigh, powerful but fleeting, leaving Dean aching for something more substantial.
“What did you intend to do at this point? Was this your whole plan?” Castiel asks, the right corner of his lips tugging upward.
uncomfortable.” Cas smirks a little, looking down at the table, before coyly raising his head to add, “Unless you wanted to make it three hundred dollars”
“Okay,” Jack said, bouncing up off the ground and running toward the door. As Jack ran over the threshold between the grass and the patio, he caught his foot on the side of the stone slab, and with all his momentum came crashing down to the floor.
“No sweat. I’m sure you were super busy with the boys.”
Castiel looks visibly flustered as he stumbles through a justification, “Well, my orders are to remain on watch at this post and protect the citadel from intruders— there’s room for interpretation in such orders… provided I do not allow any non-angel entry into the citadel and I do not leave this post then I
Dean shrugs. “Hey, ditto.”
Dean beams with pride. He’s totally winning ally-of-the-year for being totally on-the-level. He’s also a teensy bit wobbly. “Can we go? These drinks are like… fifteen dollars.”
Demonic blight; an unholy corruption of the soul that spreads through one’s entire being from the inside-out. In some cases it can be purified if it’s caught early, but in an advanced stage such as Sam’s, there’s really no walking it back. Some day, likely in the next year, he will succumb.
The divvying up of the rooms is easy; Cas and Victor will bunk together with Dean and Jo next door. It’ll make a nice change sleeping in an actual bed with a mattress, that’s long enough for Dean’s feet not to dangle off the end (he
Cas stops dead in his tracks, almost resulting in a four-person pile-up. He holds out a hand to signal the others to be ready. Dean flexes his fingers around the hilt of his blade and sets his senses on high alert. Cas raises his hand in a signal to stay put, and he creeps forward alone into the trees. Dean follows him with his eyes, and then he sees the figure.
have a glass,” Cas continued. “That’s what I want. But I don’t
After what for those two is actually a modest-length staring match, much to Cas’ surprise, Dean’s lips curl into a smile. “Hell no,” Dean says finally. There’s a hand at Cas’ waist and Dean’s pulling Cas closer to him, to the point just before their bodies touch. “I just realised, I’m playing this game wrong; I’ve been letting you play every hand.”
“God, Cas,” Dean lifts himself back up. “It’s not that. It’s not like I didn’t already know, at least kinda.” This prompts a squint from Cas. “And I wanted to tell you, I really did, but I never could.”
“So, uh, Garth, what’s this all about?” Dean asks, leg bouncing in anticipation to get out of here before all the beer is gone.
The angel jerks the hand holding Dean’s knife forward, urging him to take it. “Go,” the angel orders, harsh and loud and emphatic. Dean needn’t be told twice. He flees back into the thick wood, his mind a long way from his intended task. He doesn’t dare look back, not even to see again those eyes, ancient and powerful, that looked upon him with a kindness undeserved.
As they finish up, they begin to discuss sleeping arrangements. Bobby only has the one spare room, and since Dean insists that Sam is still recovering, it goes to him, with Dean opting to crash on the couch.
“Yeah.”
The room is already bright, the thin curtains doing little to keep out the morning light. There are the beginnings of a stir upstairs, signifying that whatever quiet peace Dean and Castiel had found for themselves is almost over. Resigning himself to that fact, Dean pulls himself out of Castiel’s grasp and gets upright.
“We’ll run through all this again in more detail and make preparations tomorrow morning. For now, are there any questions?”
Castiel accepts him for all the mess and the struggle and the occasional stupidity. Castiel pulls Dean closer to him in his own wanton desire. The kiss is impatient, Castiel’s hand in Dean’s hair, the other gripping tight at the fabric of his shirt like it’s offended him. Dean can feel from Castiel that he wants more, and he’s certainly not in the mood to deny him.
“To this charge,” Naomi says, drawing out the words as if relishing every moment. “How do you plead, Castiel?”
Bobby had given him a set of tools to clean up and blades to sharpen as a way to keep him busy during the day so that he might make himself useful instead of lying down on the nearest available flat surface, dead to the world. He had done so, finding the monotonous labour somewhat comforting as a distraction from his darkest thoughts and a way to keep the wheels in mind turning.
Once he’s cleaned himself up, Dean tosses the washcloth onto the floor, too exhausted and mind too lost in a swirling sea of bliss to care. He crawls into Cas’ arms and sighs, his head heavy and inviting him to drift off there. Only he doesn’t want to, preferring to be here, in this moment.
sensitive.” Sam shakes his head and continues on eating his soup. “But seriously, you seem happier. Maybe than I’ve ever seen you. So I’m happy, really.”
Missouri’s roof is in dire need of some refurbishment, several tiles having slipped off having been battered by several years of summer storms. Dean gets to work shortly, aiming to get the bulk of the work done before the sun hits it’s peak and starts beating mercilessly down on the unforgiving black tile.
“Yeah, you can say
“Remiel,” the male angel interjects with a pressing authority. “Come, Zachariah will be expecting us.”
“Oh,” Jody’s shoulders slump and she takes a breath. She’s trying to mask it but there’s disappointment in her face, as well as some confusion. “What kind of bet?”
“God, will you shut up about that. I’m asking what you want for
Jo’s eyes widen. She thwacks Dean on the arm. “Dude,” she squees. Dean is less excited. If Cas is involved then what they’re doing must be big; they wouldn’t dream of putting that guy on a milk run.
“How old are you, kid?” the other Dean asks, shockingly calm and conversational.
Castiel definitely doesn’t posses the willpower to resist, so he lets Dean pull him in close. There’s an immediate regret as Dean splutters at the feathers in his face. The two swap and Castiel brings Dean into his arms, holding him tight like he might slip through any moment.
“Yeah, so? I can still trust him.”
“Actually we hadn’t decided,” Castiel adds, harshly.
“What do you think, dumbass?”
Cas looks directly at Dean, a fond recognition in his eyes that makes Dean squirm. “Perhaps.”
“Do you really believe that? Or do you just want to?” Castiel asks, soft, not accusing or judging, just asking.
“You know what, fuck it, I could do with a laugh,” Dean says, putting his burger down as they get to business. “So what is it then, the highest stakes game of ‘gay chicken’ ever?”
“Yes,” Cas says with a taut smile, looking withdrawn and guilty. “I apologise for not staying.”
“Okay,” Dean says, biting his lip. “I— Okay, maybe you should rest up.”
“It’s, uh, really great to meet you. Sir. Thank you so much for, uh, saving my life,” Sam stammers before Castiel. Castiel frowns and tilts his head in an adorable alien-like confusion at Sam’s outstretched hand. Sam clears his throat and pulls it back.
The man opens his mouth to speak—
“Everyone out,” Cas says, voice level and sure.
judge you for it.”
Castiel’s face tightens and his eyes widen as he takes a step back, as if he’d been unaware until that point just how close he’d been standing. “I have never
Bobby’s eyebrows lift in disbelief. “You coulda been killed, you damn fool!” he scolds.
“Oh.” Cas’ lips are held tight, straining to keep his face composed. He’s voice is unsteady as he confesses, “I thought it was nice too. In fact, I should- I should confess that not all of it- it wasn’t as easy for me as I let on. I was- affected at times.”
like you mind.”
“What are you two girls gossiping about?” the older Dean jabs.
“Yeah,” Dean muses. “Yeah, I don’t know, maybe this place ain’t all bad.” He bumps Castiel on the shoulder and Castiel bumps back, not sure of the protocol but just enjoying the moment as it is. “Do you think the other angels could be cool if they spent more time around humans?”
“Apologies,” Cas says. “I just noticed you have several scratches on your arms.”
“Yeah,” Victor says, elongated, a strained look forming in his face. “I’ve been getting the feeling you two don’t get along much.”
“Hey Sam,” he says, looking down at the corner of the pages again. “Is dad dead?”
following my orders. Absolutely.”
“I guess,” Dean says, shrugging and releases his hands from Cas’. “I think I learned that my dad was kinda homophobic. I mean, at least a little bit.”
“Not this guy,” Dean chuckles. “What’s next, don’t tell me you bake too?”
“To this charge how do you plead?” Naomi asks.
He releases his held breath when Dean emerges, but the anxiety doesn’t fade. “Dean, it’s good to see you.”
“No,” Sara shook her head. “Library guy had dark hair, remember.”
Cas was taken aback as his heartfelt, though greatly abridged, tale of self-sacrifice was met with laughter.
Dean pauses, looking at Cas, confused. Neither appears to be on the other’s wavelength as the two lines of conversation run against one another like a transverse geological fault. “How is that different?” Dean asks after some thought.
Jo groans and chucks her pillow at Dean’s head, thankfully not opting for one of the knives laid out in front of her. “You asshole!”
“We’ve got some money left, should we get something for everyone, do you think?” Jo suggests. “Might be nice, I dunno…”
“Oh, hey, by the way,” Sam calls, catching Dean before he goes. “Eileen’s coming over later. We were gunna go out but our reservation got cancelled. Family dinner?”
,” he says— and he doesn’t, not as long as Sam still needs him. “But I don’t want
Cas looked over at Dean with a pained expression. That was the last time he deferred the decision making to Dean.
“Slept bad,” Dean says, swiping his phone from the counter as he moves to leave.
“Right,” Dean says, elongated with a shallow nod. He’s closer to the angel now and the angel seems to have taken notice of his advance, eyeing him warily. Yet the angel does not move to strike, standing so still he’s almost statuesque— his high cheekbones and marble-cut jawline only adding to the illusion.
he really wanted. In all of his millions of years, the universes, the stars and the ages, the one thing. And he never would.
“Oh no,” he said, his brow furrowed as he helped Jack up off the floor. “Dean,” he called. “Get the first-aid things.”
Dean opened up the back and the pair were reminded of the magnitude of the task ahead of them.
Bobby shrugs. “It’s after four.”
Dean doesn’t sleep particularly well that night. He doesn’t sleep that well a fair few nights, so it’s nothing out of the ordinary, but it does fuck up his morning when he finally wakes up proper and really feels the effects of waking up every hour panicked and sweating. He can’t remember exactly what he’d been dreaming about, the visions slipping away as his eyes adjusted to the dark of his room.
“The best thing I can do is to draw the angels’ attention onto myself while you and Sam find somewhere safe to lay low.”
“No, no,” Castiel assures. “It’s sort of like… being petted. It’s very comforting.”
“It was fresh,” his older self says, passing a look over his shoulder. “Yesterday. But it’ll taste just as good day two.”
The fruity abomination is actually… kinda good, Dean must admit. It’s not overly sweet like he was expecting - the pineapple and lime combo actually makes it kinda tangy if anything. It’s also surprisingly strong. Dean had never actually taken the time to read cocktail menus, typically just writing them off as weak shit for wine moms who want to feel adventurous, but cocktails actually have a
“I mean, couldn’t we help? We may not be angels but we can still fight—”
“I know I’ve made many stupid, naïve decisions in my life. Choosing you is one of the few good ones. I don’t regret it, any of it.”
Crazy Jim not to be confused with Pastor Jim.
“I would be lying if I said I was feeling optimistic,” Cas answers, trying to make as much eye-contact as he can stomach, but ultimately gazing down at the bowl of swirling soup before him more than anything. “I will be able to send messages to my contact, but I won’t be able to receive any response, so we’ll have no way of knowing if he’s even agreed to meet with us…”
“Well that’s…” Bobby shakes his head. “That sure is a predicament.”
“Yes.”
It’s been a few days since Dean’s last visit. He’s worked his way through five books total now, and Dean has apparently been taking mental notes on Castiel’s response. The last book he’d read was, according to Dean, ‘not really his thing’, but he was right in thinking that Castiel might like it. It was about a prince who fell for a commoner, and who tried to run away with her to live a simple life. It was, as Dean had put it, ‘sappy and lame’, but Castiel found it sweet. He couldn’t quite put his finger on why, but he liked it a lot.
“Meg, I’m-” Cas started before Meg raised a hand to halt him.
“The guy knows his shit,” Victor says.
“Damn right.” Dean says, and kisses Castiel once more before they take off.
Cas leans down, bringing his face down to Efram’s level. With one hand he grabs Efram’s hair at the back of his skull and pulls his head back, the other hand holding the blade tight to Efram’s exposed neck.
The following morning is an early one. Luckily being in a populated town they were all excused from watch, provided they all kept a weapon within arms reach while they slept, which Dean always does regardless.
Dean means what he says, he turns tail and heads for the door— only to remember that the he needs to remain inside the wards. He curses and turns back in, throwing himself on the couch, still draped in the blankets haphazardly thrown off earlier this morning.
Jo shrugs, a little pouty in the face. “Yeah, I guess.”
“I apologise for not—” Castiel winces as his shoulder brushes against the back of the chair. “For not contacting you sooner. I was called back into the garrison.”
Sam hesitates, like he’s sidestepping around mines with everything he says in this conversation. “Maybe,” is what he settles on. “I think dad pushed us a lot to be like him, and I don’t think either of us ever really wanted to be. I reacted to that by aggressively trying to be everything he wasn’t. And you-” Sam stops himself, realising that he’s not exactly speaking in the past tense with regards to the Dean sitting there in front of him, still carrying all of their father’s expectations on his back. “Either way,” he continues. “I think it’s natural when you get older, to figure yourself out, to really just stop caring what your parents think and do what you feel is right for you.”
“Like possession?”
Cas’ brows furrow and his head tilts a tad. “Is it? Weird?”
“We’re going to headquarters?” Jo’s face lights up. The Men of Letters’ bunker is the pinnacle of comfort; real beds, insulation from the cold and the rain, almost unlimited hot water, and apparently the best food and
“Okay, Cas,” Victor says, sighing and leaning in. “I’m hearing you. But tell me again why this is necessary? I mean, what makes you so sure the angels have any useful intel to begin with?”
Even with his future self out of the game, he seems so focussed and efficient. He reckons he could probably still take on a fair few vamps without breaking a sweat. Not bad for a family man.
“I don’t really know what to be ready for.”
Sam scoffs, big and dramatic. “So… you’re not going to the store today, are you?” Dean grunts in response. “Great. Well, how would you feel if
“Hey, Cas,” Dean returns. “How’s watch treatin’ you?”
“Okay,” Dean murmurs, shuffling under the covers. “Are you staying?”
Dean nods slowly, biting his lip to stifle a chuckle. “Okay, yeah,” he concedes. “So what part of your duty is it to stand here flirting? Aren’t you supposed to kill me?”
“What?” Dean asked.
“You’re such an idiot, you know that?” Meg chastised, semi-seriously. “All the time he has yearned and pined for you like a lovesick puppy and you just didn’t notice that? What, were you staring at his ass the whole time?”
you man. I
trust him?”
Dean rolls his eyes with his fond smile still intact. “One beer, coming up.” He orders for the both of them and sets them up at a table. Cas thanks him and takes a sip, making sure to pace himself as he readjusts to a human alcohol tolerance. “So… first time back in the fray, how d’you feel?”
Cas rifles through. Most of what’s in there is probably relegated here from the main wardrobe for a good reason. There’s stuff that’s torn or stained but not thrown away for whatever reason, some stuff that probably hasn’t fit Dean since he was south of 30 and probably never will again. “Dean,” Cas looks Dean square in the eye, face deadly serious. “This is garbage. Why haven’t you thrown this away?”
“Dean, are you good?”
There’s a silence that falls between them, heavy in the still, sterile air in the cold, white room. There are a million different things they could say to fill it, all the ways two brothers know to say goodbye, but in a lot of ways, there’s nothing more to say.
He tries again; water, detergent, scrub, rinse, repeat. The water runs clear, Castiel’s handprint remains distinct. Dean stares at it and it stares back. His fist balls up the fabric as he draws heavy breaths. His face feels hot as if some empty rage is just under the surface, but it bubbles up then simmers away into nothing.
“I don’t need you to do that, Dean.” Cas said, slipping his fingers in between Dean’s as they sat side by side. “You already do enough for me.”
to. Punch, probably.
“Maybe— I could do something nice for him?” Dean scours his mind for inspiration— then it comes to him. “I know what to do.”
There’s a knock at Dean’s door late in the evening. He can tell who it is by the quality of the knock; it’s soft, a little tentative and patient - definitely Cas.
“I’m sorry, what?”
“That kinda sounds like the guy who fixed my car…” Tia mused, voice a little slurred.
During the day, Castiel’s focus is marred by a phantom static, his thoughts blurred and ill-formed. The forest ahead is just a smudge of green with flecks of brown in the shadow. The wildlife of the forest’s edge are all just vague blobs of motion— no differentiation between squirrel, mouse, vole or hedgehog; they’re all just small and brown.
“I’ll be right here,” Dean assures him. “You just let me know if you need anything.”
,” Dean mocks.
“It’s not like I have your ‘fiction books’ to keep me occupied.”
Castiel smiles, but it’s a solemn smile. “That assumes a level of freedom that is not afforded to angels. We are soldiers; our only purpose is to serve, to follow orders absolutely. There isn’t typically a great deal of room for personal growth in such an existence.”
sick, if the pitying looks and uncharacteristic kindness the people of Lawrence have afforded Dean the last few months are any indication. So if Sam were to suddenly be bouncing around town doing hard manual labour, people may talk.
“And what? Hide? For how long? Forever?”
“No, that would likely be impossible, especially now that the angels will have found Efram’s body. I have a contact I can try to reach out to.”
Castiel smiles, tracing over the scar with the tips of his fingers. “I could heal it if you’d like?”
Castiel has a knife. It’s Dean’s hunting knife; the angels never removed it from his person following the trial. Not that they would have any need to; a simple steel blade poses no threat to an angel. Castiel wonders what threat it poses to him now. For a moment, his mind pressured and hazy, he just stares at it’s gleaming surface. The light doesn’t bounce off it cleanly like it does an angel blade, minuscule imperfections in the material’s surface deflecting and diffusing light in an uneven scatter. The edge is the cleanest part of it, smoothed down into a sharp, precise point. Castiel runs it against the pad of his left index finger. It stings; it’s a sharp spike of burning pain, that quickly decays into a dull feeling.
Sam leans his head forward. “Why not?”
“Yes. He confirmed the existence of the tablet, and that the angels don’t know where it is,” Cas states, sounding weary in a way that sleep can’t fix.
Cas exchanges a look with Victor, who simply looks on with a humoured pity. Without the wherewithal to protest further, Cas lays down and throws the blanket over himself. Dean takes a seat by the window, gazing out into the street with a hand poised at the hilt of his angel blade.
Dean shoots Cas a weary look. “Alright don’t get sassy,” he snips back. “But, uh, yes please.”
“Have you child proofed everything yet?” Sam asked, frowning as he watched Jack nearly collide with the kitchen island.
“I wasn’t going to,” Sam says, pursing his lips. “I’m too tired after waiting up for hours.”
“I understand,” Castiel says with a nod.
Uriel shakes his head. “No. For now we’re taking precautionary measures to monitor the situation. While this post of yours is mostly inactive, we’d like you to keep an eye out as always.”
“Yes,” Cas states plainly. “Now be quiet.”
“It’s just a jacket. I got ten more just like it.” Dean waves his hand in a casual dismissal.
It’s funny how quickly even the lowest of expectations crumble at Dean’s feet. As if he couldn’t even have this, not even on the run and in hiding, even that would be too sweet.
Bobby finds Castiel lying there and asks him what he’s doing. “Listening,” he answers. When Bobby asks “To what?”, Castiel doesn’t answer at first. He takes a moment to hear the wind disturb the grass, the calls of the birds in nearby trees, the buzz of the crickets.
“I know that it’s not been easy for you,” Cas answered, looking down fondly at their intertwined hands. “Restaurants are full of people.”
Dean pushes his laptop off of his lap and gets up to grab them - he’s always one to deal with these kind of things as soon as he can before mess can pile up.
Sam, noticing Cas’s distraction, turned back and saw his brother grinning like he’d never seen.
“So, what are they trying to convince me of now?”
“Everything you did was to try and help my boys. And I— I don’t blame you for what happened. How could I, looking at what they did to you?” Bobby sighs. “Dean cared about you, maybe in a way that he didn’t feel he could tell me yet, but he did. And it’s pretty clear to me that you cared about him too. I mean, hell, the entire time you were here you were arguing for throwing yourself at the angels to keep Sam and Dean safe,
Dean snorts. “Yeah isn’t that how it always is for us ‘round here?”
Jo shrugs seemingly satisfied with having an explanation. They sit down around the table to eat. It’s not the worst field grub Cas has ever eaten, although considering that the act of food consumption is entirely superfluous for him, it’s a little irritating when it’s actively unpleasant.
“That’s true, I suppose. I was going to invite you out on a make-up date, but I suppose it would be more accurate to say that it’s a further opportunity for me to win this bet.” Cas smiles sweetly and presents Dean a rose from behind his back. “Dean, will you accompany me to dinner this evening?”
“Alright well this was a bust,” Dean mumbles, wanting only to break this strange tension. “Until next time, I guess.” Dean gives an awkward two-finger salute in farewell before slipping away.
“Dean Winchester,” the first, a tall brunette man with silvery wings says. “The man who turned the head of an angel. I expected more.”
“You have a cut,” he states.
And yet the sweetness turns salty as he accepts that he must. With slow, smooth movements, Castiel takes care not to rouse Dean as he slips out of bed. He takes a moment to look down at him and he aches to wake him, to look into the green of his eyes and tell him goodbye. But he knows if he sees them, he’d never be able to go.
“This been going on a while?” Bobby asks.
Dean wonders how he’d feel if it were the latter, what that would really mean for he and Cas’ relationship. Their actual one, not this weird make-believe shit but their actual friendship. In this moment, he really doesn’t fucking care.
“Go ahead.” Dean slides the bag over to Cas letting him rummage through. He pulls out a purple plaid shirt. “No, no, hold on,” Dean dips into the bag himself and pulls out a plain navy blue. “This one. Suits you better.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he says, words slurring lazily.
“I’m fine,” Castiel protests, attempting to push himself full upright, and failing miserable. Eventually he lets himself flop back down. There’s a painful sting that spreads through his entire body like a live wire as his back hits the cushion.
“Oh… sure, okay,” Dean said, flustered. “I guess I’m ready, then.”
It’s not what Dean expected. He’d been expecting some stuffy restaurant where they give you wine lists and they have one of those guys whose job is just to be… the wine guy. Dean forgets what they’re called, something French that sounds like ‘smellier’ (the word he’s looking for is ‘sommelier’). But instead they’ve arrived at a bar. It looks like a pretty nice bar, mind, with most of the other cars in the parking lot relatively new and mid-to-high-end makes. But a bar is a bar and that’s definitely somewhere Dean can be in his element, so there’s a wave of relief there.
He leaves Victor to assemble all their supplies before they’re due to head out, while Cas sits, a million thoughts swimming in his head, swirling and crashing like tempestuous waves. Victor doesn’t ask what’s wrong; these kinds of episodes are not unusual for Cas— former angels may not dream but apparently they are tormented by visions and flashbacks during their endless waking hours.
Yeah, if he and Cas actually
Instead, his mind shifts focus to another burning question,
That’s what the innkeeper tells them when she’s debating whether or not to let a group of mysterious strangers stay in her inn. “We don’t want no trouble here,” she warns.
“Good morning, buddy,” he says, cheery even while his voice is gravelly and rough in his morning tiredness.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas sighs. And he is. He places two fingers over Dean’s forehead and his body drops, falling limp into Cas’ arms. He carries him over to the bed and lays him gently down.
“Woah,” she says. “Dean, you used to be kinda cute.” She has a devilish grin that’s instantly likeable. The older Dean shoots her a weary look.
The older Dean grabs his jacket and his keys and makes for the door.
Dean shrugs and takes a swig of beer. “Yeah, I guess I have.”
Sam seems happy too, he’s laughing and joking and teasing again, which naturally is the best thing Dean’s seen in ages, even if he has to put up with his the full brunt of his brother’s sass once again. Sam and Castiel seem to get on, mostly by being on the same kind of weird nerd wavelength; Sam has a billion questions and Castiel apparently has all the answers— like,
“Well I’m supposed to be, but,” older Dean gestures towards his younger self, who still hasn’t moved a muscle or taken his eyes off of Cas.
As his mind reels through blame and guilt at his failure, Castiel almost neglects his duty further. At the last moment, his attention is drawn to the edge of the trees where Dean is already emerging into the open. Castiel feels his chest heat up, and his feathers fluff.
The following day dawns anew and Dean feels like his entire body is tied down with rope and weighed down with rocks. Alcohol doesn’t affect the speed of bruise recovery but when you’re entire body
“To this charge, how do you plead?”
He’s still here, though, alive, and the citadel has not been breached on his watch. A human might say ‘all’s well that ends well’, but to an angel, outcome is of little significance. Castiel’s choices betrayed his duty, he sees this now; his lenience almost cost the security of the citadel.
Dean’s interactions with each debuted look is more or less the same. There’s the initial up and down scan, the first thought that Cas looks really good, the second thought of why was that his first thought, the third thought that maybe this does look better than the flannel though. Castiel doesn’t look like a hunter, and he doesn’t look like a Winchester. If that’s the case then he’s just Cas, who lives in the bunker with them because that’s where he wants to be. But what is there for him here?
Dean clutches the glowing vial tight in his hand as he watches over his brother. He doubts whether or not he’ll be able to sleep, but even in his anxious excitement, he can’t bring himself to wake Sam. He lays down in the bed opposite, watching him sleep for a time, before rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling in the pitch black, waiting for the sun to  rise.
“Tell us the name of the demon you consorted with,” Azrael demands cooly.
Castiel, too, is defeated. He sighs and lowers his sword arm, shaking his head in disappointment. “I can’t…” he mutters. “After everything and I still can’t make myself kill you.”
Dean stops with his mug at his lips, poised to take a sip. “Seriously?” He lowers the mug to the table.
“Don’t you knock?” Dean snaps.
There’s a moment of quiet contemplation as Sam mulls over what his brother has said. There are some things in life that are unsure, some things that are debatable. The mercy of angels is not one of them.
“So what’s going on out there? How bad is it?” Dean asks, focussing on Castiel’s arm, only passing fleeting glances up to his face.
“Sam’s well now, you
“Really, did any of you even mention me once after I was gone?” Meg pushed. “Was there ever even a ‘hey, remember when Meg said this’ or ‘what great times we had with Meg’.”
There are lots of incredibly irritating things about being human. The constant need to urinate is one. Itching is a big one - it just seems so pointless. The ass-ache you get from sitting in place for too long is a disheartening discovery following the discovery of the joys of sitting. Showering is real nice while you’re in there; the steam against the skin, the hot water caressing the curves of the body, the fresh feeling that follows; but it always seems like such a pain to drag your ass in there even though you know you really need to. And that’s another thing - the body just
“I’ll just have whatever you’re having,” Cas says with a shrug. “It’s not like it will affect me anyway.”
“Two weeks. I gotta last two weeks then I win,” Dean explains. “If one of us backs out then we pay up. Oh, and we got two rules; no kissing and no groin touching. Breaking them’s an instant forfeit.”
“Thank you,” Dean says, voice shaky. He exhales and nods, cooling himself and steadying his mind.
It feels like eons since Castiel last stepped inside the city walls, separated from the world and from humanity. In reality it’s been just under fifty years, but watching that post since his demotion has felt like an eternity.
The second after Cas’ hand makes contact with Dean’s shoulder, they’re standing in the middle of some dingy motel room, beer bottles strewn across the floor.
The heat and panic building in Cas’ chest reaches un uncomfortable peak. “Not anymore.” He looks up at Dean’s face, watching him expectantly with wide eyes and softly parted lips and he just can’t. “Excuse me.” Cas shoots up, leaving his empty plate and heading into the cold, dark living room and closing the door behind him.
“No, Dean, I- you’re too proud to lose like that. I knew that about you and I feel as though I exploited it.” Cas sighs and finally meets Dean’s gaze. “I just wanted to- I was frustrated. At the diner, I was annoyed at you because-”
Sam looks down at his hands in his lap. He takes a slow breath in and a long exhale out. “It’s okay, Cas,” he says. He looks up to meet Castiel’s worried gaze. “Maybe I’m just not someone who can be saved. You tried, Dean tried. But it’s okay.”
He rolls onto his side and tugs open the drawer in the wooden side table. The drawer slides open with a rattle, as the only item in there slides along the bottom and bangs against the sides. It’s an old lighter, the metal case is scratched. Cas flicks open the cap, and there’s a click, but no flame. It’s long been empty, the fluid having slowly evaporated into the stale air.
“But if you did—”
“Hey Cas, come here I’m meeting the neighbours,” Dean beckoned Cas closer and placed an arm around his waist. “This is Carol from next-door.”
The sun was hanging low in the sky, dipping down toward the western horizon, when Dean and Castiel were sitting on the floor of the living room of their new home. The room was illuminated by a soft rose and amber glow streaming in through the windows and painting the blank walls with streaks of light. Half-emptied boxes were scattered around the room, with furniture wrapped up in foam and padding lined up against the wall as yet to be arranged.
Victor approaches Dean and holds a hand out. Dean takes it, pulling himself up and letting Victor draw him into a friendly bro-hug. “Good to see you, man.”
Dean pauses, a few metres from Castiel. “Stop me?” Dean leans into the words with a mischievous tone.
Dean is glued to the spot, standing there in the empty entranceway. Sure, Dean hadn’t been sure what he expected, but this is so much further afield from anything he could have ever pictured.
eat other things.”
asshole.”
There’s a moment of pained silence at the table as everyone knows what they have to do next, but nobody wants to make the first move. Bobby is the first. “You boys stay safe,” he says, gruff as he can manage.
“Okay, uh, thanks.” Dean carries his blankets over and sets out a semi-comfortable bedspread.
“I can’t even imagine you drunk enough to puke in a dumpster,” Dean chuckles, feeling the shake of Cas’ body flush beside him as he snickers. “The part about you throwing a guy in there, now that I can picture clear as day.”
Cas pulls away and sits up, running a hand down Dean’s chest. He pauses there, taking him in, with Dean looking up at him doing the same. “You’re beautiful like this,” Cas says, his voice sounding one part gentle and earnest, one part devilish and hungry. Cas’ hand ghosts around Dean’s upper thigh, and area Dean
“Hmm,” Cas presses his lips together into a line, eyes drifting to the side as he blocks his wording carefully. “Well I suppose, also, I don’t really like wearing those shirts. Did you want breakfast?”
“Woah guys, oh my god!” Rachel hissed, patting Yulia’s arm furiously. “The guy, the hot dad, he just walked in. Don’t look, but he’s right by the bar!”
“Sure. Once Dean makes himself presentable I can take you over to the tent.”
be back. And—” Castiel pauses to blow out a long breath, squeezing his eyes shut as he does. “More angels will come. That is if they’re not already on their way.”
Dean scoffs. “Whatever.”
“Thank you,” Cas says, paying their fee and accepting the keys.
Dean looks back at his brother and widens his eyes in a silent signal for him to stop being weird and get the hell over here. Sam complies and steps forward, holding a stiff hand out to Castiel.
“So you keep saying,” Dean jabs back.
The furniture is dusty and the air is stale, but it’s so much easier to breathe in there. He can hear the muffled voice of Victor from the other room, most likely explaining away Cas’ strangeness and idiosyncrasies as he so often does. This is different though; Cas knows he’s probably thrown Victor for a loop as well.
“I told you Cas doesn’t like to talk about his past much,” Victor starts, leaning in a little. “He’s had a rough go of it. He lost someone— someone he loved. Angels killed him. Left him with a pretty heavy vendetta against angels, and a whole heap of trauma that he refuses to talk about until he’s got about a gallon of alcohol in him.”
Dean throws Sam a scornful look, but concedes by handing over the smallest bag. It hardly lightens the load, but it might just shut Sam up which is enough of a weight off Dean’s back.
With both hands Sam pushes himself up from his chair, stumbling slightly as he rises to his feet. In a moment Dean is there with a support under his arm. Sam starts to protest, but opts against it, allowing Dean to walk him slowly over to his bed.
Jo passes Dean a sharp look. The message is clear; get your shit together ASAP. Dean slumps his shoulders and huffs in protest but eventually drags himself up and over to his trust clothes pile to find something that smells like it might be clean. As soon as he’s dressed he steps outside to where Jo and Victor are waiting, and lets Victor lead the two of them over to one of the big tents in the centre of the camp, usually used by commanders for strategy meetings.
Sam’s mouth is perched open, eyed wide. He moves to sit on the side of his bed facing Dean. “Are you— I mean is that really
“Really? You’d put it past the angels to do something like that? Cas pretty much said it himself that they’d execute him if—
In one of the bars that lined the street, a group of early-thirties women gathered together to toast to another week of work behind them. Pushing past their exhaustion was their relief, their ecstatic joy at being free at last, even if only for two days. The ladies sat around a high circular table covered in a rainbow of different fruity cocktails, curly straws, and paper umbrellas. Already the table was littered with empty glasses of drinks long since backed.
It’s jarring then, when Castiel stops abruptly in a small clearing. Around them there’s only trees, shrubs, and sheets of rain. The only sound that of the rain striking the leaves, and the gathered drops splashing heavy onto the leaf-strewn ground.
eager to no longer have to rely on the charity of Missouri and Pastor Jim.
Dean licks his bottom lip, half-shrugging as he plays it down. “Yeah.”
“Hey!” Dean protests. “I did not lose! You’re the one who quit first!”
“Yo, Victor, I got something for you,” Jo calls as soon as she comes in. Dean, meanwhile, peels off over to Cas, not wanting to make too much of a meal over it.
“Six months.” Dean replied honestly without thinking.
That peaceful feeling brings its own kind of worry though. It’s the kind of peace that one might associate with death - the final release. Dean can’t remember dying. There was no fight, no struggle, no panic. But then, he does recall a pang of sadness, a weight in his heart and mind. Maybe he slipped away in his sleep or something. It seems pretty ridiculous when he thinks about it. But this picturesque street offers little in the way of answers.
“Yeah,” Sam agrees, easier than he’s agreed to anything his brother’s suggested before. He settles back into his bed, Dean helping to pull the covers back over him.
“Another one?” Jo asks.
They infiltrate the nest taking it from three sides, creeping through with blades sharp and sure, taking heads clean off shoulders with swift precision. Within minutes they’ve all but cleaned house, with the exception of one remaining vamp, baring it’s fangs and closing in on Dean, who’s ready with a mean look and machete in hand. Dean’s eyes are fixed on the vamp’s, his fingers brace around the blade’s handle, the muscles in his arm readying for a single heavy swing.
out.”
Castiel tenses. “How many? Did they notice you? Speak to you?”
He and Bobby talk very little in that first week. Mostly Bobby keeps to himself when he’s not helping Castiel out with something. Castiel doesn’t walk about much, splitting most of his time between the living room and the kitchen. Bobby, on the other hand, seems to prefer to spend his days locked away in his study. He doesn’t usually start drinking until after dinner, after he’s brought Castiel some soup and redressed his bandages.
Still, Cas can only wish that Bobby could have lived to see the end of this conflict. Although, who knows whether its a blessing or a curse that Bobby was never able to see Dean sitting around his kitchen table once more…
Cas moves his other hand to grip Dean’s, passing a thumb over the cut. With a sharp stinging sensation, followed by a tingling, the cut vanishes. “Well now that won’t get infected. The bruises aren’t exactly life-threatening. I’ll tend to them later.”
want him to.
“I walked up and he, unprompted, was like ‘you’re the girl with a cute little bug, right?’. I was like,” Tia stuck out her chest, letting her cleavage peek out of her tank top in a cartoonish pose, and began to speak with an over-the-top sultry tone.
“I’m going to the library, goodnight-”
Instead, there’s the patter of tiny footsteps as a young boy, no older than 5, dives right for his older self. “Daddy!” his tiny voice calls out with joy as he barrels into older Dean, before older Dean picks him up, allowing the boy to wrap his tiny arms around his neck.
“That’s gunna be a pretty long walk,” Dean remarks, checking in to make sure Castiel understands his very human limits.
Cas sighs as Dean tugs again. He dips down and positions himself with knees either side of Dean’s legs, perched there hovering just above Dean’s lap, both hands still held. “Now what?”
Castiel just meets Dean’s eyes, staring blankly.
This time, Dean’s path is linear. It’s fast and assured, Dean walking right out of the forest and into the light, making a straight path toward Castiel. That’s certainly a different approach.
Typically this would be the moment where panic sets in - for Dean that would present itself in getting instantly into defensive position. The scene is not unlike the first scene in some zombie flick where the unwitting protagonist finds themselves in a deceptively calm and empty street only to get jumped moments later. But there’s something about the air, the temperate, still air, and the clouds painted pink and gold. The panic never manifests, and Dean feels peaceful.
Victor nods. “In theory, yeah, we hope so. Thing is, right now it’s only a rumour. The intel isn’t the most reliable so first thing we gotta do is confirm the thing exists in the first place, then we can go about finding it.”
This evening is different than usual; his frequent flier had made his return. Castiel has somewhat expected this— no man whose reaction to being let off easy is a profound disappointment would be so easily deterred. Castiel cannot be sure whether he ought to admire or fear the man.
“Oh, I’m sorry about your friend,” Carol said, her confusion fading. “But that’s so sweet. Well, I won’t keep you, I’m sure you’ve got tonnes of unpacking to do!”
“I should leave,” Castiel cuts in, a simple statement delivered without hesitation nor emotion.
Sam presses his lips together into a line, making that face Dean recognises as him holding his tongue instead of getting shot down. “What is it?” Dean asks.
Dean searches his mind for any kind of rationale, or at least some further protest to the ridiculousness of the whole thing. He quickly gives in; swallowing his reservations, and answering, “2005.”
“No thank you.”
Dean can’t help but stare, his eyes wide, his jaw clenched and frozen solid. He stares at the man’s ruffled black hair, his piercing blue eyes, his gentle gaze. His wedding band. Oh.
Castiel turns and his mind is returned to the reality of the cool late-autumn afternoon. He hadn’t even realised how heavy his breathing had become. “I— It’s surprisingly calming.”
“Nice to meet you. I’m Castiel.” Cas said, plain and business-like.
Dean frowns. “Is that not what I said?”
“Yeah.”
The worst part of the day by far; having to drag themselves off the other to get out of bed. The two went about their morning dues with the added excitement of everything being so new. New closet to take clothes out of (though with a limited selection since most of them were packed away in still taped-up boxes), new laundry basket to chuck yesterday’s clothes in (and miss, so new floor to leave dirty boxers on too), new shower to share, new stove to cook (and burn) eggs on, new sink to wash dishes in… The newness of some things was arguably less exciting than others.
Cas raises a hand in apology as he notices Sam’s expression. “Oh, no, I don’t think it looks bad on- on
“No idea, they won’t even tell me,” Garth says, taking a long sip of his hot chocolate and sighing in relief. “I’m sure they’ll explain everything tomorrow when they get here.” Garth takes another sip and hums in appreciation. “Anyway, I don’t wanna keep you any longer than I need to. Go enjoy your night.”
“She’s not from here, is she?” Dean asks, the name ringing no bells.
In other ways, he’s lost everything. He’s lost his identity, his power, his faith, and his purpose. And he lost the first and only thing he’s truly cared for in all his millennia-long life.
“Why specifically?”
“You people don’t answer anybody,” Dean snaps.
“How did I-
“Oh, bold. Role-reversal, I like it,” Dean comments.
“Until
“He took out a bunch of picture books and he told me that he’d just moved here recently. He also borrowed some gardening books, which was like,
It’s all consistent with what Cas would expect, but hearing it makes it all the worse. There’s no freak coincidence here, but something, some power or some force at play.
“Then we need to leave,” Sam says, running a hand through his hair. “But we still don’t know where the hell we’re going.”
“God, stop it.” Sara scolded through her laughter.
Some of them are old, the edges of the paper frayed and worn, the white paper yellowed. Some of the oldest are all written in the same handwriting. Whoever wrote them has beautiful handwriting, they’re signed ‘Dad’. Castiel skims through them, they’re autobiographical mostly, detailed accounts of what the boys’ father had been doing. They usually end with some kind of warning or instruction, often along the lines of ‘don’t cause any trouble’ or ‘look out for your brother’.
Sam frowns. “We just ate two hours ago.”
Dean sat on a chair on the patio with a cool glass of lemonade, watching the two like a rerun of his favourite show. He chuckled to himself as Cas, exasperated, tried to get Jack to stop digging around for worms.
“Oh, hey, Cas,” Dean interjects. “I brought you something else.” He reaches into the bottom of the bag and draws out another book. It’s another one of his favourites; a seamstress poses as a member of a foreign royal family and tries to scam her way into the monarchy. It’s filled with hilarity and tension and romance (not that Dean’s interested at all in the romance, of course).
a fruit liqueur in this drink.
“No you don’t ‘get’ anything,” Castiel snaps. “I have existed for longer than humanity, for longer than this very Earth, and throughout all of that time I have been one thing, had one purpose. I wanted freedom from that, yes, but this is not freedom, I’m more trapped now than I have ever been because the one way I could see myself existing outside of being an angel is gone.”
He begins to take shorter, quieter breaths as, for the first time, he feels the weight of real danger. He eschews all his racing thoughts and anxieties for the moment and focuses on taking slow, gentle steps back into the thicket. As soon as he feels he is a safe distance away, he hightails it back to town without a second glance.
“Okay, so who’s gunna relieve you?” Dean asks, giving Cas a pointed look.
Older Dean licks his bottom lip, eyes fixed on the road. “You know what, sometimes you gotta make your own pie. Don’t judge me.”
“Huh,” Dean huffs, frowning as if confused by his own action. He bites his bottom lip and meets Castiel’s bewildered gaze. “No one deserves to die, right?” Castiel reaches out slowly to retake the blade. He doesn’t yet sheathe it, but he holds it low at his side. Dean takes a couple more steps back before turning tail, walking quickly back into the trees. Before stepping into their shadow, he turns his head back for a moment, their eyes meeting briefly once more.
Perhaps it’s for the best that Dean couldn’t hear a thing, because if he’d heard the angel’s screams and cries at Cas’ hand, he might well have stormed in to stop him.
“Oh,” Dean says. He doesn’t say anything else, but walks past the guy carefully avoiding eye contact. If he wasn’t aware of Cas’ hand before he’s very aware of Cas’ hand now, not sure if that awareness makes him want to let go or hold on tighter. There’s a large sum of money on the line, so he opts for the latter.
Sam’s too busy rifling through Dean’s box of cassettes to have noticed any of the thigh-grabbing transpire. He picks one out and leans forward between the two, “Hey put this on for me, will you Cas?”
Dean is taken aback, still on another channel. “Well, it is.”
“Dude, mind your business,” Dean retorts, short and pissy.
“This area is restricted; it’s off limits to humans,” the angel says. The angel keeps a startlingly solid eye-contact throughout. It almost makes Dean itch, desperate to look away, yet paralysed by fear. “The punishment for trespass is death.”
“Yeah,” Sam says, sighing and taking a small sip of his still hot coffee. “I just hate you having to look after me like I’m a kid again.”
Castiel eyes the mysterious unlabelled bottle, stoppered with a cork. “Is it safe for human consumption?”
Cas hums for a moment, trying to find the words. “I suppose I would say… that angels are not stone cold warriors,” Cas says, his voice low and earnest. “They have their own thoughts and emotions, and just like any human, they don’t always want to hurt you. There can be indecision there, and in that moment,” Cas swallows, feeling almost crass saying it. “That’s when it’s best to strike. The only time you really have an advantage over an angel, is when you’ve already decided that you’re going to kill them, and they haven’t yet made up their mind. That said, just like any human, angels don’t want to die.”
“Your first hunt as a human… for the second time,” Dean says, as if it’s an obvious milestone.
“Okay,” Castiel says after a weary sigh. “But if something happens, if another angel catches you, pray to me directly, and I’ll come.”
“Zachariah,” Castiel interrupts, stating his arrival.
“Just that you’ve been arguing and complaining every step of the way,” she says, flipping the blade around in her hand, getting a feel for its weight. “I know you’re always kind of stubborn, but this isn’t like you.”
Dean gives a meek nod. “Uh-huh, yeah. Got it.” Castiel releases him and Dean moves to walk away, but not before adding. “Seriously, thanks Cas.”
“Prayer was never intended to be a two-way line. I can pray to a specific angel to get a message to them, but an angel can’t pray to a non-angel to send any response.”
“Well now I won’t have to bother you all the time,” Cas says with a shrug. “Breakfast?”
Dean huffs. “So how do I get back?”
“Uh, okay. Could you pass me another bulb please, Jack?”
even though the bet was over, you kissed me first, so I think by those counts you lose.”
Jack was sitting on the ground crying as Cas knelt by him looking up at Dean. “I could, but I’m not going to,” he stated.
Dean exhales long and hard through the nose. “Fine,” he says, hard and flat. “It’s a date. I’m not dressing up.”
Sam and Bobby split off upstairs and Dean heads into the living room to start arranging blankets. Castiel follows him into the living room, standing a respectable distance away, hovering in the doorway.
Cas passes a look over in Dean’s direction, checking on him, and Dean stops thinking about it.
Cas was telling the truth; his time with Meg was definitely important to him, not only in that she essentially was his supporter and confidant, but also just in the fond memories he had of her. She was always entertaining with her sass and quick wit and her deadpan snark. But it was also true that he had never, not even once, considered bringing her back. Nor had he ever really desired it, if he was honest. Not because he didn’t want to see her again, because of course he did, but because oftentimes loss is something you just accept. In a life like theirs it’s par for the course; you make friends, they die, you move on. You don’t cry, or beg or bargain, you just say thanks for the good times and you move on. It wasn’t an angel thing either because Cas had witnessed this from the Winchesters too; there were many friends they had lost along the way that they hadn’t broken down any doors fighting to bring back.
“Oh yeah,” Dean replies, steadfast. “Bring it.”
Unfortunately, Castiel found himself to be a tad
“Dean!” Sam yelps as the other angel, male with short blonde curls and pale blue eyes, yanks Sam over to him and holds him at knifepoint.
Cas traces a finger up and down Dean’s side. “If you’d like.”
“Wait I see one.”
He stops before Castiel, face-to-face with barely a foot between them, then reaches a hand out to cup Castiel’s jaw, firm, and pulling their faces closer, and their lips together. Castiel almost reaches for his blade again, but his hand hovers in shock, moving of its own accord to grip Dean’s shirt and pull his body closer.
Castiel’s mania subsides upon hearing the quiet sincerity in Dean’s voice.
The bridge was little more than a simple arch-shape; no walls or railings. Cas sits down with his feet dangling over, almost skimming the trickling water as it flows underneath. Dean followed suit, perching on the edge of this old, tiny stone bridge beside Castiel, eating a burger and watching the stars come out.
Dean can’t help but chuckle a little at that. So he’s hard on himself, yet another thing they have in common.
rituals, man,” Sam says through a laugh. Dean’s face is screwed up as he tries to parse Sam’s sentiment. He kind of knows what Sam’s getting at, but he’s not gunna give him the satisfaction.
“Yeah, me too,” Dean adds. “I always figured I’d die bloody anyway.”
Dean’s eyes are fixed on the old thing. It’s not torn, frayed, or stained. It is worn, a little faded, but then it always was as long as Dean had owned it. “Nah,” Dean says, setting it back down in the box. “I dunno, never really felt like it was mine.”
“No,” Dean cuts in. “Please don’t leave me again.”
Dean’s lips spread into a smile as he fights back a laugh. Like this, even as Dean looks up at Castiel, an angel, almighty and all-powerful, he seems so human and so small. “Jeez, I mean, don’t they let you have books or something?”
he’d mastered, but he really,
Sam’s eyes widen and brows raise in pained agreement. He lets out a big sigh, and stretches his arms with a long blink. “So I’m guessing you’ve been making the most of your time? Introducing Cas to every terrible western ever made.”
He brings his knees to his chest and sits there in a ball for a minute. He knows what he should do but he really doesn’t think he can go and do it. Eventually, the build-up gets the best of him and he’s careening off for the showers. In there he tries so desperately to keep his head clear as he gets it out of his system, but the picture of Cas over him, the memory of the sensation of his body so close, he can’t shake it. And Cas’ name is on his lips as he finishes in his hand, all other rational thought gone in place of a wave of pleasure piercing though him.
Though the summer months are tailing off, the air is still temperate. There’s a sticky humid feeling that makes the air feel heavy and muggy, but the sun is gentler than it is in the height of summer. It’s a relief to take cover in the shade of the forest canopy as Dean drags his brother into the thicket.
“If it gets your ass out of bed, yeah,” Bobby says. Castiel rolls his eyes, but drags himself up out of bed. “What’s with the attitude?” Castiel shrugs. Bobby narrows his eyes. “What are you, a teenager?”
“No- Cas I know what an apron is,” Dean said, humoured as ever by his husband’s earnest insanity. “I mean why did you get the red and white one with the ruffly heart?
“You know why.” Cas replied in earnest.
Dean gets up, sweeping his jacket off the back of his chair. “You never stopped being a kid to me, man. ‘Sides, I’m your big brother, it’s my job to look after you.” Sam rolls his eyes, but doesn’t object. “Except tonight; I’ll be back late, don’t wait up.”
“Scouring reports for leads on the tablet,” Victor replies. He blows out a long breathy sigh and closes his eyes. “We got nothing. We know the thing exists now, but it may as well not since I can’t find mention of the damn thing anywhere.”
“We lead busy lives,” Cas answers simply.
Castiel immediately perks up. “Yes, I did,” he says, energetic. “I liked it very much. I enjoyed the protagonist’s roguish charm and his bravado contrasted with his softness— he reminded me very much of you, actually. I can see why you like this story so much.”
want to make you uncomfortable-”
Cas sits up, rolling his eyes. “You should go to bed.”
Dean’s face, visible now in all it’s hard worn beauty, falls into relief. That is before the hopelessness sinks in, draining the colour from his eyes, distraught expression taking hold. “I’m sorry, Cas, for everything, I—” Dean struggles, his voice shaky and weak.
The guy’s just so preciously naïve it forces a laugh out of Dean. He claps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Cas, buddy, we’re brothers. This is just how we communicate.”
“But if it did then it’s
“It’s a scar,” Dean explains.
“I know you weren’t at the bar.”
Bobby walks in and immediately shoves a knife down into the wood with force, startling all. “One o’ you boys wanna tell me why the
Castiel straightens his back and draws his blade, gripping it firm, refusing to be disarmed by the devilish smile curling at Dean’s lips. “I am an angel,” Castiel asserts, as much a reminder to himself as to Dean. “I ought to have executed you weeks ago. That I did not was my own mistake, don’t assume I’ll make it again.”
Castiel sees Dean. In his face is pain and rage, but there’s desperation in his eyes. Desperation born of a fierce devotion like Castiel has never seen. It’s different from the devout obedience of the angels, but no less impassioned.
He shakes the feeling. “Hey, Cas, you know where we’re going?” he asks, calling past Jo who separates the two in the caravan.
“You sure will, with casserole!” Carol assured before she headed off along the street.
“Any idea what we’re gunna be doing?” Dean asks, voice cool.
“What?” Dean turns his head sharply to Castiel.
“So Cas is really our little angel expert, huh?” Dean remarks.
“No, it’s okay, I’m not mad at all,” Dean says, running a hand through Cas’ hair. “You’re right, you had to do it. It would’ve messed up a lot of stuff if I remembered. But I was thinking about when exactly I think this happened. I know you figured the exact date, but I mean, who remembers what they hell they were doing on a given day fifteen years ago, right? But I think I know what day it was.” Dean swallows.
“Oh Clarence, you died for those brothers
Dean places his beer down on the table with an emphatic thump. “Dude, what? If you knew from the start then why did you play along?” he asks, voice raised.
. He wonders if there’s some kind of inside joke that everyone he knows, and every stranger he encounters, is somehow in on.
“So we still have no idea who sent you back,” Eileen adds, concerned and unsure.
Dean’s heart jumps. He closes his eyes as he curses silently. “Highlight of your day, I’ll bet.”
“Yeah, we should do this more often. Why don’t we?” Dean muses.
Dean sighs and shifts his body up off his pillow. “We gotta go meet ‘em
“Right,” Dean says, getting there. “Well it’s semantics. When’d you become spokesperson for the gay community?”
“The charges lain against you shall now be read before the court,” Naomi announces. On the courtroom floor, a round-faced angel steps before the bench; Esme, Castiel again recognises the name but draws a blank on all surrounding details. “The first charge, please, Esme.”
“Very well,” Naomi says, her face souring at the interruption. “The fifth charge, please, Esme.”
. How do you know he won’t kill you the next time he catches you?”
“It’s actually quite common. When an angel dies, the ground can spawn entire groves. I suspect an archangel could produce an entire forest,” Castiel espouses, placing his own palm flat against the trunk, another spark spreading through Dean from where he’s still in contact with the bark.
Dean balks. “Y-yeah! Of course I would. But I corrected her because we’re
It’s been a while since they’ve had a hunt run so smoothly; Dean feels light, his mind bright and energised. As the three return to the Impala, Dean with a spring in his step, suggests, “Celebratory drinks, whaddya say?”
Dean’s older self steps up to him, take a breath, then hugs him. It’s strange, being hugged by himself. It would be easy for it to feel like an empty gesture, like giving yourself a pat on the back. But it feels full. Full of forgiveness for all the mistakes he’s made, and the ones he’s yet to make; full of acceptance of who he is, even if he can’t admit it yet; full of reassurance that there exists a future where he’s happy, safe, and loved.
Cas takes a breath and meets Dean eye to eye. “I don’t want you to think poorly of me. What I did today— I don’t enjoy it. I didn’t want you to see that side of me, I didn’t want you to think I’m a monster.”
“That’s right,” Cas recalled. “And then I said, ‘but thank you for offering. I’m glad to have you.’.”
“You know I just like to look at you.” Dean replied, his gruff voice soft and quiet.
Dean stands outside the barn, scuffing his boots along the dry dirt. He’s sheathed his blade since it doesn’t seem like he’ll be needing it. He’s pissed to say the least. His big mission and it seems like he’s only here for set decoration, left to stand around like a lemming while the grown ups work.
hasn’t.
“Oh, in that case I’ll drive,” Sam says with a shrug, returning to the last scraps of his salad.
“And the butterflies, and the birds, occasionally.” Castiel’s eyes are wide and strangely innocent.
“Yeah, maybe…” Sam shrugged.
“Sure you are, Cas,” Sam reassures, with a quick pat on the arm. “You’re a brother to us, a Winchester through and through.”
Sara rolled her eyes. “Actually yeah, a really sweet guy came into the library this week with his kid. He’s probably too old for me, and I think he’s married, but he had dark hair and really nice blue eyes,
They walk back to the house in silence. When they enter, Cas seems to have recovered his wits and is sitting at the table with a glass of water. His hands are clean, but his clothes are stained in deep red. As soon as he catches sight of him, Dean’s chest heats up in an indignant rage.
“Do you mind? Privacy?” he says, scolding.
you got me sheltering a goddamn
“The fourth charge, please,” Naomi requests.
“Well then, I’m coming with you.”
It’s a position he’s been in plenty of times, straddled on a sofa, though there’s usually a lot less sarcasm and a lot more interest from the other party. Aside from that though, it doesn’t feel all that different, which is sending all kinds of mixed signals to his brain, among other places.
Castiel’s heart rate spikes, but he retains composure. “What happened?” he asks, masking his panic as a piqued curiosity.
Dean slumps into the passenger seat when they get outside, Cas slipping gracefully into the driver’s seat, completely sober. Dean rests his head lazily against the backrest of the bench seat, slumped down in order to reach it. He just watches Cas drive. Cas has driven Baby before, though on very few occasions. Dean wonders why, since he handles her so well. Cas treats his Baby right, even more so than Sam, who never really had the same reverence for the Impala that Dean does.
“That’s just what I look like.”
, at least…” she adds, her point seeming to lead nowhere fast.
Dean’s mouth is perched open as his brows scrunch together in an affronted frown. “Whatever ‘floats my boat’?”
Dean furrows his brow, his mouth unclosed, like there are words perched right on their edge.
Dean’s almost dropping off when the finally reach Sioux Falls. He’s jerked wide awake when the realisation dawns on him that he now has to put on this horror show for Jody. His stomach drops like a loose elevator from the top floor of a skyscraper.
“From Garth, yes. From Dean…” Victor raises his eyebrows. “Not so much.”
Dean leads Missouri back to the house and in to see Sam, who now has pushed himself to sit upright. She walks to the side of the bed, taking a seat there.
“I’ve been ‘in the muck’ for quite some time, Dean.”
A female angel steps forward, stony faced with a stiff and formal poise. “So the rumours are true,” the angel says, addressing Castiel with a pretentious condescension. “The once righteous Castiel. How you have fallen.” She passes a scornful eye over the Winchesters. “And for humans such as these. I’m disappointed.”
Castiel’s mouth dries up, his throat wants to close. The words that came so easy to him a moment ago now refuse to shift, like dried cement in his chest.
The man closes his eyes tight, cursing his failure, before turning tail and pulling himself through the trees, hands pressed against the sturdy trunks for support.
. What did you do this time?” He shifts himself up in his bed. “No, wait, it’s actually too early for this, don’t tell me.”
Cas releases Efram from his grasp and stands upright. “Thank you, Efram,” he says, sincere. Efram is doubled over on the floor, panting and clutching at his wounds. He’s not used to this, Cas assumes. He doubts whether Efram has seen much combat in his millennia-long life.
“Is it weird that I kinda wish my senior prom was like that?” Sam asks, pouring out another glass for everyone.
Bobby passes his gaze over the three of them before stepping back, relenting and allowing them entry. Castiel enters last, Bobby’s eyes tracking him warily as he crosses the threshold. Castiel follows Dean’s lead here, keeping his hands close to his core and his wings tucked tight to his back. Sam and Dean stop in the kitchen, standing around an old, scratched up wooden table, and wait for Bobby to join them.
Bobby and Castiel pass their attention to Sam, who squirms under the scrutiny. “Yeah, I’m with Dean. I don’t wanna leave Cas behind either, not if there’s a better option.”
“Oh yeah, you can wear that one,” Dean gestures to the shirt in Cas’ hands. “I don’t wear it much; it doesn’t really suit me.”
like he’s already spent enough on drinks in this place to have paid the penalty for losing this stupid bet.
Castiel takes another swig from the mystery bottle. It tastes like what Castiel imagines a headache feels like. “He certainly is.”
“I can see you,” he says, voice deep and steady.
,” he demands. “Come on, you’re a
Finally the light at the edge of the brush is visible. It’s so bright that all that beyond is washed out in a blinding white light. Dean’s face lifts and his pace picks up as they find their way to the wall and the gate, and to Castiel.
“This should be far enough,” he says. “Are you ready?”
The air is a little cooler now as the season shifts gracefully into early autumn, and the forest floor is beginning to take on the beginnings of its leaf-carpet, though they haven’t yet taken on that satisfying crunch. As Dean approaches the end of his self-made path, he slows, wary of the fact that Castiel may not be alone anymore. He lurks as far back as he can, further back than any time Castiel had spotted him previously (in that sense he’s lucky to have had the opportunity for ample practice). He can see the Castiel’s lone figure in front of the blank white backdrop of the stone wall, so he approaches.
“What?” Dean frowns, taking his hand back. “No. What are you talking about?”
“Yeah, I dunno,” Dean shuffles and looks away. He turns back to Cas, his words catching in his throat, but he squeezes them out, “I can’t wait to meet you.”
“Well, it started when Jack, that’s my son, died-”
Dean glances down, as if he’d forgotten he’d put them on. “Uh…”
“Yeah, I’m ‘like, forty’.” older Dean chuckles.
The angels are gone now. It’s unlikely they’d return, Castiel thinks, surmising that he could just stay here, curl up under the covers of the bed that was never his and wait for the lights to go out.
So they begin on foot, opting to take a circuitous route through the woods where they at least have decent cover, and can avoid the angels patrolling all of the roads into the uninhabited zone. That isn’t to say the woods are unpatrolled, as Cas warns the group before the enter. “This path is very dangerous still,” he says, brows furrowed and face steely and serious. “We are warded and have cover here, which gives us a better chance than the heavily guarded main roads. If you see or hear anything that didn’t come from one of us, get ready to fight for your life, and I want all of you to have your blades in your hands at all times.”
“No. It was the most interesting thing I’ve seen all week,” Castiel says with a grimace. “You’ve ruined me, Dean.”
“What?” Dean’s face drops. He should be relieved- scratch that, he should be ecstatic. But instead it feels like a gut punch. It feels like being dumped.
Cas is disturbed by a gentle rap at the closed door. He sits upright and wipes away the tears he hadn’t even noticed he’d shed. “Come in,” he says, voice coming out in a rasp.
As they were about to head back into the kitchen, Jack ambushed Cas, throwing his arms around Cas’ legs.
Dean pushes himself off the ground, shoving Sam away from him in the process. He opens the door to head out.
“And no touchin’ my ass!” Dean adds emphatically.
Cas sucks in a long breath, letting the proceeding exhale drag out and empty his lungs of all the tension held in his chest. “You’re right. And you know me; I’m always on top form.”
Hearing Cas’ voice startles him to the point of dropping his wrench on his face. From such a shallow height it doesn’t really hurt, but his face reddens anyway as he rolls out from under the Impala with the knowledge that Cas would have heard the clattering noise as it fell. “Heya Cas,” he says, voice cool and steady, trying his damnedest not to sound hurt like a jilted lover. “Haven’t seen you since last night.”
Dean’s hand is shaky as he picks up his fork. He’s starving, honestly. He’s not unused to hunger, but it pangs like a bitch when the homely scent of pasta sauce, beef and cheese drifts up a hits him in a blast of warmth.
