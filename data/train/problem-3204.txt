Castiel’s vessel lays sprawled between the shortened cornstalks, and even though Dean knows he’s
like a giant soap bubble, disintegrating and chasing goose bumps over his shoulders and arms as Dean groans into Castiel’s mouth. The sound sets Castiel’s insides to trembling, and he tightens his grip on Dean’s hand, thrilling when he feels the answering squeeze, cool satin still pressed between their palms.
The small creature springs up from his place on the counter, nosing into Dean’s sleeve and scrambling up inside it to poke his face out of the neck of Dean’s hoodie. Cas climbs down into the hood and waits there for a moment before Dean feels the sharp tug of talons in his hair, at odds with the soft puffs of air he feels against his scalp as Cas huffs his way up onto the top of Dean’s head to settle there. Cas’ tail feathers brush back and forth over the nape of Dean’s neck in a way that feels deliberate.
“So close the door,” Castiel shouts reasonably from somewhere in the house. Dean keeps the door propped open because he’s a spoiled brat, and stamps his feet to bring some circulation to his poor, freezing toes. When he looks into his backyard, his breath puffs out into the air, tiny white clouds mingling with slowly falling snow. A dusting covers everything, a clean white blanket over the world, or at least over his little corner of it. He smiles, quietly content.
Dean looks at his brother and as much as he wants to reassure, he fails to find a smile for him. “Nope,” he says, shaking his head at himself. “But I don’t got a choice, so. Let’s get this show on the road.”
“I think,” Cas says after a moment, looking up to meet Dean’s eyes, “a piece of you is still inside of me, as well.” He leans his forehead against Dean’s and closes his eyes. “Oh,” he whispers, “the

Dean looks down at his hands held tightly together in front of him on the table. He looks over at Elieen, back to his hands, then up at Sam. “Just thinking of the number’a times I’ve given you shit about… well, about people like Madison, or Amy,” he mumbles.
“She really is,” Sam agrees dreamily. Dean has to literally bite his own tongue to keep himself from saying something… inappropriate. He does get it. He sees the way Sam lights up like a fucking Christmas tree any time someone even

And Dean… doesn’t even know what to do with that. He’s spent his whole life knowing in his bones he was unlovable, worthless. He can’t wrap his head around Castiel telling him different.

Dean jumps. Can’t help it. He spins to see Cas standing behind him as though summoned. He’s standing too far away. Dean can’t make sense of the feeling that wells up in him, wanting Cas to be closer even though he
Of course he would forgive Jack.
The hole inside Dean is dark and bottomless and it sucks in all sensation, an event horizon. Colors mute. Sounds don’t carry. Dean drifts, the road eaten up under Baby’s tires as she chews her way down the coast. He’s gotta find the right spot. Someplace that croons peace into every atom. He’s certain if fairy rings and alternate universes and Hellmouths exist, good mojo has to accumulate somewhere, too. Right?
. He takes in a deep breath, fills his lungs with the cold night air and the sweet-grass, lightning-crackle smell of Castiel, and says, trembling, “Stay. Remember, Cas? You said you were gonna stay.”
Castiel moans, muffled behind lips pressed tight together, and arches hard against Dean, hips rocking off the bed, chasing the pressure of the other man’s grip.
There was a knock on the door, and then chilly air burst in and interrupted the glorious, steamy warmth swirling around his legs. “Cas?” he heard his sister ask, and all the adrenaline that had pushed him this far suddenly disappeared, leaving him shaky and tearful in the tub.
real –
But he… has.
. He’s glad he’s still alone, with this kind of shit running through his head.
Castiel takes a long moment to respond. While he’s thinking, Dean stews and watches as Castiel twists their entwined fingers to and fro. Dean tries not to fidget or feel worried about what Castiel has to say, but there’s still this niggling doubt in his mind, that this is all somehow a dream or a hallucination, or if not, that Castiel will realize one day that Dean isn’t… isn’t worth anyone’s trouble, and will disappear just as unexpectedly as he had come into Dean’s life.
and Castiel’s had enough; he leaps up from his spot across the table and snatches his book, glaring at Dean before marching out into the hallway.

. You, Cas,” he says firmly.
. He makes sure Cas is securely nestled in the folds of his scarf, the dragon’s body folded in loops and warm and smooth against Dean’s neck. Castiel wriggles around slightly and pushes his head up against Dean’s chin, peering out of his warm cocoon to watch as Dean heads out the back door and into the late autumn morning.
for lunch?”
Cas is definitely not in the bed, though.
Castiel would remain hidden from Dean, but he would be closer to him, in case there was any serious danger. He could handle the temptation of being physically closer to Dean in this wild place. As long as Dean didn’t know he was there, they were both safe.
He’s gently patting the feathers of Castiel’s wings and tail dry when he asks, “You wanna come watch a movie with me, bud?” Cas tilts his head in his questioning way, and Dean shrugs. “Pie’s got a while yet. I can make some popcorn.” As usual, the mention of food sends Cas all aflutter.
When Castiel spots the package of bacon he lights up and he lets out a hungry squeak. Dean looks down at the dragon and smiles at him. “Yeah, I know buddy,” he says, giving Castiel a scratch between the wings before washing his hands at the sink. “You love your bacon just as much as I do, don’tcha.” Cas lets out an affirmative chirp and hops around on his tiny feet.
“The fuck–?” his father growled, disbelief creeping into his voice as the color started to come in.
“Don’t worry about Meg,” Anna said when Castiel was done, and he scoffed. “I’m serious, Cas, don’t worry about her for now. She’ll come around.”
“The good word is, I may have to give Rowena a call,” his brother mutters eventually, casting a frowning glance in Eileen’s direction. Despite the smile on her face only a moment ago, it’s clear she’s very busy ignoring Sam, which makes Dean think Sam’s explained this plan to her and she decidedly Did Not Like It. “From a purely magical perspective, she’s the only other person I can think of who has enough knowledge and experience to have come across something like this before.”
Rather, the barista makes him
He rages inwardly. What kind of bullshit ending would it be for Castiel to be merely a sacrifice? Throwing away a chance for them to be happy
Dean laughs again and pulls Cas close to make good on his promise.
Dean tackles the nest situation with gusto – at first. He initially tries to tempt Castiel with a shoebox, full of loose change. Cas – because
Lee laughed. “Aww, I hit a nerve, Winchester?” he asked, derisive and sickly sweet, before he shoved Dean again, harder this time. Dean warbled, stepped back, and tripped over his bike, twisting as he fell and landing hard on his left shoulder in the dirt and gravel. His skin burned as it tore against the ground, but Dean scrambled back and got to his feet, glaring hard at Lee before launching himself over his fallen bicycle and catching the other boy around the middle, tackling him with a shout. They crashed to the asphalt in a flurry of blows, punching and kicking at each other furiously.
“Meg, I– look–” Castiel stammered, turning towards her so she could see the fresh tattoo.
“Can it, Samantha, it’s bedtime for you, too,” Dean grumbles. He pushes himself to his feet one-handed, carefully cradling Castiel against his chest as he struggles not to tip over once he’s upright. He turns slowly to Sam and offers his brother a hand; how they manage not to go down in a tangle of limbs is beyond Dean.
Around him, the seething of the surface beneath his feet finally settled. It was, suddenly and unexpectedly, completely silent, the strange-yet-familiar background hiss falling away, muffled and then quelled like the whole of the Empty had been smothered. After an interminable amount of time with the steady stream of white noise, the silence felt infinitely more sinister. Castiel, wary, peered into the dark, searching in all directions, finding nothing until it occurred to him to look
“Nah, man,” Dean says, wind taken fully out of his sails now. “I didn’t even — I didn’t even try to find a way to come get you.” He regards Castiel sheepishly, apologies and his own confessions rising to the surface, racing to get out. Dean washes them all down with his whiskey, tossing the last of his drink back to drown them for now. “I knew there had to be a way, but I — ”
“I'm not so sure about that Cas, you are getting tired of his attitude pretty fast”
“Jack Kline Winchester” We decided to keep his last name as a middle name, and add the Winchester. He is my son after all and he needs a legal name. It's not official yet, but we are going to make it soon. “I’m tired of your attitude, Cas warned you about it, and I'm following through with his promise” I start a pattern on his butt, I know that's something to hate. I’m not spanking him hard but this pattern is a killer. I have learned that by first-hand experience. Two to the right cheek ‘SMACK’ ‘SMACK’; Two to the left cheek ‘SMACK’ ‘SMACK’ and One on each sit spot ‘SMACK’ ‘SMACK’, “We don't want to control your life” I start the pattern again “We just want you to be safe” Another cycle of hits “We can talk this like civilized people, but if you don't want to we can do this for as long as you want to”
“OW!, Dean, it hurts!” “I know it hurts, that's why it's a punishment it's supposed to hurt”. “I want to talk to you like civilized people, but I can understand if this is going to help you a little, tell me when you’re ready Jack” Cas decided to start cleaning the kitchen. I don’t stop, he seems like he is getting it.
“What is going in here?” Cas asks as he pours himself a cup of coffee, he can’t really eat but has found some comfort in coffee
“Dad, I’m Sorry” He put a hand back trying to block my work I gave the next ones to his thighs
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
“He doesn't need to know that Cas. I'm going to be firm with him. That's the other reason that I want to join you. I'm just teasing you. I'm getting tired of his attitude too. His schoolwork doesn't bother me that much”
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
“That’s good. Have you seen Sam?”
Sam and Dean understood my reasoning but Jack didn't and he got himself in trouble many times. The only thing that I'm grateful for is that he has never put himself in danger. I don't know how I would react, to be honest.
I’m getting off-topic. They are not being fair. I will stay here till they let me out, but i don't agree with the training thing.
This is the first chapter that contains a full spanking. Dean spanks Jack because he is tired of his attitude. They do have rules and Jack decides to break them. The spanking is not Dean being abusive, it is just the way they handle things.
“Stop worrying love, I’m pretty sure everything is fine and your thoughts are so loud that I can’t block them” he gave my butt a warning tap “and please don't do anything stupid, don't interfere with your brother's life, you will not like the aftermath, I can assure you it's not going to be fun for you”. I moved and hugged Cas
“Cas, I’m…”
“Everyone is gone,” Jack interjects from behind Sam. He looks away from a spot on the floor and darts his eyes between Sam and Dean, a strange expression on his face, as though he’s surprised himself by speaking, but also that he’s certain of what he’s said. “But if Billie is dead, or – in the Empty? – how did she manage to take all those people?” he asks, frown returning.

in the vast nothingness, his mind straining to grasp the absolute lack of anything here. He staggers a step forward and stops, remembering his amber, remembering the feather.
too hard, Dean starts keeping Castiel’s mug on his bedside table.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean says to the empty field. “I’m so sorry. I – I couldn’t…” He cuts himself off and scrubs hands gritty with ash over his face. Dean’s never been good with words, even when –
Finally reaching his brother, they all exchange hugs in greeting before Sam turns his attention back to the booth he and Eileen had been inspecting. Dean looks, too, and sees it’s a little food stall offering delicately iced ginger cookies, hot chocolate, and apple cider.
So. Stand he must. Dean opens his eyes and bites back a groan of pain as he pushes himself upright, hands still clapped firmly over his ears, fat lot of good it’s doing him. He turns in a slow circle, unable to see
“Cas, is, uh. Cas is awake, too.” He glances at Dean briefly before flicking his eyes back to his book. “He’s in the greenhouse.”
In response, Castiel wanders close to Dean’s hand and stands on his hind legs, forelegs reaching out so Cas can grasp Dean’s finger in his tiny claws. He sticks his head forward and snatches the button out of Dean’s grasp with his teeth. Scurry-hopping backward, he turns and brings the button back to his mug and very deliberately drops it inside, then looks over his shoulder at Dean, chirping up at him indignantly.
“Nothing solid yet,” Sam says absently, turning a page in the book he’s poring over. “I just got started.”
he is. He can get his four hours some other time.
“Of course,” Cas says, but Dean still sees wariness written all across his face, in the tight way he’s carrying himself. He doesn’t like it. He’s never liked it when things between him and Cas are weird. It always unbalances him, somehow.
Yeah. Yeah, that’s totally the reason Dean decides it’s okay for the dragon to stay.
Enjoy!
But then, of course Jack is calm.
to but at this point it’s literally all he’s thought about for weeks and he’d be lying to them both if he said he didn’t
Cas opens his mouth, closes it, and thinks for a moment before he replies, “That is not what I was expecting you to say.”
, Cas!” he bites out, annoyed in the split second before he sees Castiel’s face, head down and eyes up in his best impression of a contrite puppy that would put Sam to shame. Dean lets out a sigh. “Dunno how many times I gotta say it, dude,” he mutters as he drapes Cas onto the table. Cas makes a face that, if on a human being, would reasonably be called a pout. “No little dragon feet in my baking space, okay?” Dean turns to the fridge and digs out a couple of strawberries. He gives them a quick rinse and then drops them onto the table with Castiel. “Here, have a snack.”
Heart aflame with frustrated anger, Dean shut his mouth with an audible
Pulling his gloves off, Dean accepts the bracelet back, then reaches for Castiel’s left hand and pulls it into his lap, palm up. He loops the bracelet around Castiel’s wrist and ties it off with steady fingers. Impulsively, he pulls Castiel’s wrist to his mouth and presses a kiss to the tender skin there, eyes on the other man’s face. “You’re somethin’ else, Cas,” he murmurs against Castiel’s skin. “I’m real glad I–,” he swallows, adds thickly, “I’m glad I asked you to stay.”
” Sam is babbling, his hands roaming over Dean as though to reassure himself that Dean is, in fact, sitting right in front of him.
There’s a pleasant twist in his belly when he recalls Cas’ heartfelt confession, and for once, Dean doesn’t push the memory away, allowing a warm weight to settle in his chest as he busies himself with tucking the sheet around Cas’ shoulders. For a long moment, he stands beside the bed, watching Castiel sleep as Cas had once watched him, before giving in to the inexorable pull of his own desires, brushing the hair back from Cas’ brow. Cas turns toward the touch in his sleep, and Dean’s insides melt. He’s confused and thrilled and humbled all at once to think this cosmically powerful being trusts him so much, has pretty much always trusted him, no matter how badly he treated him, how often he pushed him away, how much of a disaster Dean was or is.
, and (b) of all,
Not like Gabe is really going to come down on him hard for being late. Even though Gabe’s his boss, he’s probably the most laid-back boss Dean has ever worked for. Besides, they’re pretty good friends. He knows Gabe will forgive him. Dean doesn’t make a habit of showing up late.

the least Dean can do is make sure he’s sleeping comfortably. It may be useful, especially in their line of work, to be able to fall asleep anywhere and any which way, sure, but they’re taking things slow right now, focusing on the research. Dean can take the time to help Cas get nice and cozy, to do the sleeping thing
“Iced coffee?” Castiel asks, and Dean nods, already reaching for his wallet and pulling out a few bills. Dean pays for his coffee, and Castiel and Charlie seamlessly switch places so Castiel can take care of Dean’s order.
Even so, penance or not –
Dean thinks back to that first morning he had found Castiel in his kitchen, about how when he’d finally gotten a look at Castiel’s face he couldn’t look away. He remembers how his heart had clenched in his chest and thinks it must have recognized something he hadn’t even known he was missing.
“Dean,” Castiel says, a note of tension creeping into his voice now, “do you not… want me here?” He seems to shrink into himself, hugging his leg tighter. A blush rises on his cheeks and Dean suddenly thinks he looks more than tense. Castiel looks… he
This is the fourth time
“Cas?” No. Freaking.
Beyond the physical agony assaulting his every molecule, beyond feeling like his body is turning to ice in this void, Dean feels a seed of warmth in his heart and he focuses on it with a single-mindedness that everyone who knows him would refer to as “stubborn.” He lets the warmth grow and blossom inside him, a seed that had been planted ages ago but he had refused, for what now seem like unimportant reasons, to water. He feels it climb through him, up his throat, out into his fingertips and toes, driving back the chill of the void and consuming him in a cozy heat like a blanket, like a barrier.
before he admitted it out loud, that this is actually really fucking cute.
“You’re welcome, Sam.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, well,” Dean gripes, opening himself to the tugging he can still feel, sure and strong, from the gateway. “He obviously didn’t count on me fuckin’ it up for him,” he says ruefully. He glares at the entity before him and spits out, “But you can’t have him, you son of a bitch. He’s human now, and we don’t belong to you.”
Stupefied, speechless, Dean marvels at how easy it is for Cas to say this stuff to him, and secretly, selfishly, how much it makes his whole damn self feel lit up from the inside out.
Couldn’t Dean simply… let Castiel give him this one thing? The only thing Castiel ever truly had to give Dean in the first place, the only thing sad, well-intentioned Castiel had that wasn’t somehow polluted by his past misdeeds: his own life in exchange for a second chance, a tiny extra burst of time snatched surreptitiously out of God’s grasp for Dean to breathe and plan and act and
and the pleased look in Castiel’s eyes, but he at least manages to be polite. “Good to meet you, man.”
If his soulmate cost him his best friend, he’d never forgive them.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel says, muffled in Dean’s neck. His words land hot on Dean’s skin, making him shiver. “I just wanted to do something nice,” Castiel adds, and his voice sounds so small it breaks Dean’s heart a little.
Dean crouches next to the raspberries, places the mug down in the dewy grass and cups both hands around the tiny creature he’s found. Dropping his hands level with the ground, he tries to slide out from under the dragon’s curled body. It clings to him with its tiny claws, like a kitten. It makes a strange purring chirp that is clearly a sound of distress, and Dean feels a stab of guilt when he finally manages to extricate himself and put his hands on his knees.
Wake up. Zombie-shuffle to kitchen. Flip on lights. Flip on coffee. Find small dragon creature lying curled up in coffee mug. Return small dragon creature to the wild. Repeat.
“They’re–?”
Out of the numb emptiness creeping through his limbs, a sudden familiar sensation flows through Dean: of being held, close and warm, of being protected by an invisible something he can’t define but knows, somehow, down to the atoms that make him up. He wants to sink into it, let it carry him away into blissful oblivion, but it shifts around him. Instead of falling into a welcoming cloud of safety, he’s dragged forcefully back into consciousness.
“Sammy,” Dean says, now looking up at Cas. “You got any idea what’s goin’ on here?”
“It’s still there, inside you,” Castiel murmurs, and Dean’s glad he’s tucked under Cas’ chin because he goes hot from cheek to chest. “I thought for sure the Mark had burned the last of it away.”
A tiny frown crosses the man’s face and he tilts his head to the side curiously, the move eerily reminiscent of…
body, the familiar shape they’ve come to know as
And sits.
“Jesus,” Dean manages, just as Castiel says, “No,” and goes back to leaving a bruising kiss on the hinge of Dean’s jaw.
Struggling to will his hands to stillness, Dean grasps the vial in one hand and carefully presses the tip of the angel blade against the base of Castiel’s throat with the other. He takes in a long, slow breath and draws a short, shallow line across Castiel’s skin. The flesh parts and he bleeds blue, Grace swirling out into the space between them, aimless, eager to dissipate. Dean uncorks his vial and holds it out, doing what he can to coax Castiel’s Grace into it. It feels like it takes forever, and all the while Dean aches and aches and Castiel remains still and silent.
to be to work on time.
, dude!” he manages to eek out, trying to ignore his own reaction to hearing his name said in such a deep register.
Castiel is frozen, regarding Dean with cautious amazement, his blue eyes wide and wondering. Dean’s pulse hammers in his throat, the course of the conversation taking so many forking paths, he’s not sure how they arrived
be a timestamp eventually, but as it stands right now I might just have to turn it into a full-blown sequel because it turns out I can't write porn without plot. ^.^;;; In either case, more of this version of Dean and Cas is forthcoming - sometime. As soon as I can get it out of my head and to my alpha and betas, anyway.
Unsure of how much time had passed since the Empty took him, he wondered if it had finally tired of letting him ruminate on his own. The relentless wall of sound didn’t abate; if anything it grew even more impossible to ignore, closing around Castiel and pressing on him like a lead weight, echoing and whispering in dizzying vacillation.
“I know you don’t want to hear it, but don’t worry about that, either,” Anna said from somewhere near the bathroom sink. “Now let’s see your arm.”
And Dean is speechless because,
could be lost. And Dean wouldn’t risk losing Cas again.
Dean hates how small his voice sounds, how fragile, and he didn’t even know he was gonna say it till it was out, but he’s not making the mistake of letting Cas leave again. By all that is good and holy, he’s learned his lesson, okay? “Please,” he adds, holding tight to the reins of the panic galloping away with him.
Driving to work in the dark of the very early morning, Dean can’t stop smiling like a total idiot. The thought of Castiel walking around the house in Dean’s clothes all day has a warmth blooming inside him that he simply cannot contain, so he doesn’t even try.
He takes a long sip of his coffee.
“Yeah,” Dean says absently, distracted by a whorl of grace that puffs up around Cas’ head, reminiscent of the antlers that Dean had seen in the field. It disintegrates and settles back into Cas just as quickly as it came.
Cas keeps choosing him. And that is worth… everything.
“Dean,” he murmurs, barely moving his mouth away from Dean’s. “Are you…?”
Or maybe he’s breathless because Cas casually tossed his grown-adult ass up onto a table like he weighs no more than a sack of flour, what the fuck? Unreasonable,
too close to actual chick-flick tears to ask Sam for one.
Since a lot of us are hurting and looking for fluffy soft things right now, I have to warn that
“Is it? Your number?” Dean asks again when Castiel doesn’t speak, and he bites his lip before he nods, nerves making the butterflies in his stomach crescendo violently.
Just. Because. Of reasons.
If anything, his father held on harder, squeezing his wrist so hard Dean was sure he could feel the bones grinding together. The edges of the tattoo caught under John’s rough palm, stinging and fierce like a scraped-over sunburn. Dean bit the inside of his cheek, refusing to release the tears that threatened from the pain.
hurts
He thinks, it’s time to make friends with this dark place inside him. He is done with running around trying to save everyone and everything, letting his guard down and the darkness up to overshadow. He thinks, if he stays perfectly still, if he stops gasping for air and closes his eyes and remains unmoving, he can be a shining light, warning others away from the shades of their shame, luminescence leading them into something new.
Dean closes his eyes, shakes his head. “It wasn’t Billie coming after our people,” he tells them. “It was Chuck. It was Chuck all along.”
The man beside him huffs a laugh and slides his dark blue gaze in Dean’s direction. “More like a little bit late,” he says with a voice like gravel. “Haven’t slept yet.”
“I’m saying,” Sam says, clapping Cas on the back as he passes him, “he’s not going to bring this up with you.” Cas’ frown deepens, and Sam shakes his head. These two,
. He’s failed again, but this time he’s fucked up so stupendously he doesn’t know if he’ll ever be able to trust himself. An enormous pit opens up inside him, a well of misery, and Dean has no idea how to keep everything he’s feeling from spilling out.
Castiel’s hands come up to Dean’s, loosely circling his wrists where Dean is still clutching Castiel’s t-shirt. He searches Dean’s face, squeezes his fingers around Dean’s wrists, and tells him quietly, “You don’t have to do this.”
“They mate for life, Dean,” Sam explains, sounding constipated. “The bites are like, the equivalent of putting a ring on it.” He pauses, and Dean senses something weighty in the silence. “I think… I think it means that Cas, uh. Castiel loves you. A lot.”
His thoughts are pulled to a sun-drenched meadow, verdant and bright, windmill slowly spinning in the distance behind the hill. He remembers the way his skin felt so
“What did you mean?” Dean asks, feeling brave. “How did you know?”
Looking back at Cas, chewing his lip, Dean comes to a decision. He cups his hands around his mouth and shouts up to the angel. “Hey, Cas!” He can’t tell if Castiel can even hear him; the colossal creature before them doesn’t react. And hey, Dean gets it — if he were a towering alien being with wings, he probably wouldn’t pay much attention to any little insignificant humans making noises at him. They’re essentially ants to Cas right now. Maybe they always have been, Dean realizes with a sudden chill.
and he’s
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean. If it is within my power to do so, I will
head spin. Two weeks is like,
Somewhere, he hears Sam mock-gagging and backing down the hallway, but Dean doesn’t care. If the big moose is having second thoughts about that “blank check,” well. Sam’s a meddling meddler who meddles, and he deserves exactly what’s coming to him.
Dean, in his usual gruff manner, had pulled Castiel into a fierce hug, fingers digging into the fabric of his trench coat, before pushing him away with a quick smile and stalking off to his car. He’d said nothing of Castiel’s confession, and Castiel, quite used to Dean’s tendency to stew in his own emotional juices, had followed Dean’s lead and kept silent.
Dean fingers the chunk of amber hanging from a leather cord around his neck. The rich golden color of it warms in the candlelight, capturing the flames and sending them winking into the corners of the room. He looks over at Sam and Jack, chewing worriedly on his lower lip.
“Jesus,” Dean breathes. He twists in his seat, laying his book on the desk, before turning back to Castiel and leaning on his elbows. His hands hang between his knees, fingers tangling apart, together, apart, together. He clears his throat, wets his lip. Looks Castiel in the eye. “Sorry, uh. Been thinkin’ about this a lot, but I guess now that you’re here…” He steadies himself, moving fluidly from awkward to confident in a way that makes Castiel’s mouth feel suddenly dry. “Damn, it’s good to see you, Cas,” he finally finishes.
Thanks so much to all of you who followed along and left such lovely comments, to those who followed along silently, for all the kudos, for your support. This story was such a pleasure to write and I'm just delighted that it's resonated with so many folks.
to be brought back. But she had been. And as much as Dean had once coveted his faded childhood memories of Mary Winchester, they were nothing compared to actually having her in their lives. Not even as just their mom. She was a friend, too. Someone who understood him and Sam and… and respected them, loved them. And maybe Dean took that for granted. He knows better than anyone, though, that the people you love can disappear in a puff of smoke if you’re not careful.
!” he accuses.
“Okay,” Dean hears himself saying, and then Cas is everywhere and all Dean can do is hold on. The tension between them feels brand new and electric as Cas crowds in against Dean, pressing them together, and brings his mouth back to Dean’s with a sigh.
Before Dean can finish… whatever it is he thought he was going to say, Sam’s clomping footsteps force his attention to the kitchen door. Castiel pulls away abruptly, clasping his hands in front of himself on the table, casual. As if he hadn’t just shaken Dean to his bones with a simple touch.
What is he gonna do? What is he gonna
After last night's episode, I just wanted to offer everyone some more fluffy nonsense, because seriously, W.T.F.
“Um.” Dean swallows thickly, speechless, still reeling from the sight — the
“What happened to Amara,” Sam asks now, waving his hands in front of himself, clarifying, “when Chuck…?”
“How many times have I died, Cas? Or Sam, or Mom, or Dad, or– or
“Jack–”
At the moment, his ire is directed at this particular witch who has Dean on his knees, finger twitching eagerly on the trigger of his own gun as he fights hard to pull the barrel away from his temple.
Dean glances at Sam again. “Like, permanently?” The knot of fear and worry in his stomach turns into a thousand wriggling snakes.
“Well, I said dragons are a lot like… like bowerbirds, right? They make. Um. They make, you know, um. Oh! Fancy nests, right.” He shifts his weight from side to side, and Dean eyes him warily, wondering if Sam was indeed steady on his feet. “Uh, I maybe should have clarified? They build the fancy nests when they want to. Um. Attract a mate?”
The weirdo, dorky best friend he thinks he might be in love with, too.
“What.” He coughs, clears his throat. “What was that?” he manages, panting. He presses his face to Cas’ chest, grounding himself with the feeling of Cas’ warm body pressed against his own, and realizes Cas is breathing hard, too.
Dean comes back to his own bedroom, Cas’ smile tagging along with him, settling warm and natural and right in his heart. He looks around at the minor destruction he’s wrought and puffs out his cheeks, letting the air out slow like a balloon with a leak.
“I prayed to you,” Dean interrupts, sudden, anger snapping back hot and making Dean’s insides shudder. Fuck making things

Cas without even meaning to, just as he’s done a billion times before. What if Cas decides he’s finally had enough of Dean’s shit?
“If I let a small amount of my grace in at a time,” he says, sounding immeasurably tired, “I may be able to bind myself to this vessel again.”
Before Dean can even think of an answer to that, he hears Sam call his name, voice all small and wobbly. When Dean looks over, guilt surges through him, hot as lava. He’s briefly transported to one of many nights spent alone in some awful motel, watching Sammy — young and wide-eyed and innocent — put on a stoic face when they realized Dad wasn’t coming back tonight, either. The way his eyelashes would clump and his lip would tremble with the effort of holding back his tears, so he could show his big brother that he was brave, too.
“Don’t care about ‘necessary’,” Dean says, sliding his hand down Cas’ arm to tangle their fingers together. He fights down the embarrassment that tries to rise up. Fuck it; if he can kiss the guy, he can damn well hold his hand, too. He gives Cas’ hand a light squeeze and starts walking towards his own room. “I’ve got the comfiest bed in the whole bunker, and I can tell you’re fuckin’ bone tired, man.”
Jack smiles again, bouncing a bit on the balls of his feet. “She’s with me. We’re in … harmony,” he assures them.
Dean gets it now. He gets how important it is that no matter what, against reason, against fate, Cas has chosen him, again and again.
.” Face bright red, he reaches out a hand, not far enough to snatch the panties from Castiel’s grip, but close enough that Castiel could hand them over if he reached out, too.
Even longer since he felt compelled to turn on the charm and actually
Castiel is still on his knees when Dean shakes his head and returns to awareness, dragging his hands up and down Dean’s bare thighs and pressing his face into the crease of Dean’s hip, just nuzzling there, unhurriedly worshipping. Dean is boneless, light, and a thousand times foolish for pushing Cas away for as long as he has.
Here, have this incredibly schmoopy thing that I wrote.
Sam nods, solemn, and hands Dean a small crystal vial, which Dean stuffs carefully into the breast pocket of his jacket. Sam gives him an angel blade next, hilt first, and Dean tucks it away in his sleeve. Finally, Dean watches as Sam hesitates before producing a small, fluffy black feather. He puts it square in Dean’s palm, then closes his fingers over it gently. Dean doesn’t even have to ask; he knows, even though he’s never seen them, this is one of Castiel’s feathers. He wonders how Sam got his hands on it, looking to his brother for any sort of clue.

have to do that. Cas grumps around the bunker for days, and Dean watches him with a heavy, sick sensation in his stomach because honestly, what had Cas expected? Like Dean was ever gonna let the crazy son-of-a-bitch stay gone. Like he wasn’t gonna go after Cas the minute Chuck was in their rear-view. Like it isn’t fucking eating Dean up inside that Cas said he loved him; but selfish, greedy bastard that he is, Dean can’t help wondering if Cas is
Dean can feel a heavy silence brewing and pushes through it. He’s been silent long enough. “I wanna talk to you, Cas,” he says, and he’s proud of himself for keeping his voice so steady. Castiel raises an eyebrow at him, but doesn’t say anything. Which, okay, fair.
“Good morning,” he says, and the dragon blinks grumpily at him. “Thought I’d, uh, let you stay here.” Dean coughs, and does his best to ignore how crazy he probably looks and sounds at the moment, talking to a surly dragon that can’t even answer him.
The interruption brings Dean up short and he turns to Jack, eyebrows raised. “No?” he asks, digging Baby’s keys out of his jacket pocket. He’s surprised by the force of his sudden rush of emotion at the thought of Jack leaving them. He’d figured – hell, he’d figured Jack was family, and family got to stay.
“What?” he asks.
for a change, huh?” Dean interrupts, gruff. Somehow — and frankly, Dean’s not entirely sure how it could be possible, but there it is — Cas looks even more stunned than he did moments ago, after their kiss. He shakes his head. “Look, put the PJs on, dude. Trust me, you’ll be more comfortable.” Cas still looks doubtful, but dutifully reaches for his tie and loosens it.
“I crashed my bike,” he told her as his lip started to tremble with the effort of keeping himself contained. “And I got my first soulmark,” he added, quiet and sad.

, Cas had said.
“Ooookay,” Sam says, rubbing his hands together before running them over his face. “I see I’m in for a real treat on the ride back.”
Cas fumbles for the door handle in the dark and practically falls out of the car in his rush to get out of it. For a whole hot second, Dean thinks he’s going to puke right there next to the rear tires, but then Castiel is continuing into the cornfield like a man on a mission, stumbling every other step as he picks his way through the remains of dry cornstalks poking up through the snow. A horrible memory drifts lazily to the surface of his thoughts: Castiel striding into a lake, releasing the Leviathan back into the world. The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand on end.
A tiny seed of worry takes root in Dean’s chest as he starts looking through the house for Cas. He thinks back to Sam’s joke about always knowing where to look for the dragon, but Cas is definitely too big now to even think about hiding in Dean’s bathrobe pocket anymore. Still, he makes his way down the hall to his bedroom, figuring it’s most likely that Cas has stayed near his hoard. And also where it’s warmest, under the blankets, since it’s getting closer and closer to winter and what Dean assumes will be hibernation time.
“I don’t know, Sam, but we gotta do something!” They just got Cas back. They just got him
But the rest of him.

and pulls away.
“Come
“I know, Sam,” Jack says, voice gentle as he crosses into the room and lays a hand on Sam’s shoulder. He, too, crouches beside Dean, reaching out to cover Sam’s hands, lifting them slowly away. He closes his eyes, stretches out his hand, and lays his palm over Dean’s heart. Buttery light spills out from under Jack’s fingers, soaking into Dean’s clothes. Castiel sees tendrils of glowing gold twist and twitch under Dean’s skin, flaring and receding with a steady pulse-pulse-pulse, and closes his eyes.
He brings a hand to the side of Dean’s face, cradles his cheek. Dean turns into the touch, doesn’t look away as he kisses the center of Castiel’s palm. The space inside Castiel’s heart swells against the confines of his ribs.
She held up a hand and shook her head. “Don’t. Even. Finish. That. Sentence,” she bit out, angry.
“It appears that while most of my grace is unattached, I do require sleep,” Castiel is saying as he takes the seat across from Dean. “But tonight I am finding it… difficult to do so.”
“Yes, by all means,” Castiel agrees readily, deathly serious. “Do what you must.”
Enormous thanks and hugs to

“Hey,” he says, light and neutral, placing the drink carefully on the counter before leaning his elbows there and offering up his sorry-to-be-a-pain-but-at-least-I’m-adorable smile to the blue-eyed, sex-haired, walking-wet-dream currently engaged in topping off some other fancy coffee with a hefty mound of whipped cream.
Dean shuffles around in the kitchen, getting himself together for a long day of holiday baking and shopping. Why he’d agreed for them to meet up with Sam and Eileen – at a craft market,
,” he moans, his thighs already starting to shake. “Oh, o-oh — ”
Warm light from the kitchen spills out into the still morning, illuminating enough of the yard for Dean to navigate it without tripping over himself.  Cool, damp autumn air settles against Dean’s skin as he steps out onto the grass, carefully cradling his coffee mug with both hands. He finds a spot under one of the overgrown raspberry bushes that looks like a good place to set a dragon loose (He guesses? He doesn’t know much about the critter currently interrupting his sacred morning coffee routine). Bunches of browned, shriveled berries hang heavy on the canes of the bush, and Dean reaches down to clear some fallen leaves away from the spot he’s chosen.
He gestures at Cas with the remains of his toast. “What’s that thing on your neck?”
Dean walks for several blocks in silent thought. He can’t explain it, but Cas makes him feel more at ease with himself than he has in… years, if he’s being honest. Castiel feels like an old friend, the sort that, no matter how long it’s been since you’ve seen each other last, you can sit down over a beer or a hot meal and pick up right where you left off. Like they’ve known each other their whole lives instead of a handful of weeks.
Dean blinks. “Hey,” he says, not seeing the downside here, “that’s — that’s great, Cas.”
“I said,” Cas says, voice thin, “we’re ready to complete the spell. Are you — ”
“Shit, man, are you gonna put on some clothes, or–”
“Yeah,” he agrees, leaning his forehead against Castiel’s. “I think you’re right.” Dean inhales the cold wintry air and lets the breath go slowly before he leans back and reaches into his jacket pocket. A sudden nervousness washes over him as he grasps the object inside and he catches his lower lip in his teeth. Castiel looks at Dean curiously, and Dean can feel the tips of his ears growing hot.
Dean finally snaps out of his daze and he takes a quick step back into the hallway. “How did– who are– what the
Wake up. Zombie-shuffle to kitchen. Flip on lights. Flip on coffee. Find small dragon creature lying curled up in coffee mug. Return small dragon creature to the wild. Repeat.
He hopes he can at least give Cas some kind of lasting peace. He deserves that. Hell, they all do, but maybe Cas most of all. Cas, who only ever wanted what was best for the
“I’d like that,” Cas murmurs sleepily, clearly drifting off, and Dean snuggles down into him and closes his eyes on a contented sigh.
Cas finally breaks the kiss and leans his forehead against Dean’s, lashes sweeping across his cheeks, exhaling heavy and warm into the space between them. “That was– you’re–” he tries, gently shaking his head and huffing a laugh before falling silent.
when he realizes Castiel isn’t kissing him back.
“I think we’re off to a good start,” Castiel tells him with a smile. “Though I have little experience with these things, myself,” he adds, smile morphing into a small frown.
Someone is in his bed.
Dean doesn’t say anything about this collection of treasures. They are as inexplicable to him as Castiel’s preference for his very plain, very functional coffee mug, but they are clearly just as important to the little creature. Dean’s touched, actually, that Cas seems to want to completely surround himself with… well, with

come back – then that would be it. All Dean would have left of Castiel, Angel of Thursday, were his memories.
, words that rang more of confession than of invocation. Parts of Castiel laying silent and martyred resurfaced in Purgatory when he heard Dean’s prayer and felt the thread of
“Dammit, Cas, I gotta find you,” Dean went on, crouching low to the ground where three trees came together, sprouting from the forest floor like thick, twisted fingers. “I– I need you, Cas. I need to make sure you’re safe.”
Over time, a small collection of trinkets appears tucked into the bottom of Castiel’s mug, all of them the detritus of Dean’s solitary life: A bottle cap from Dean’s favorite beer. An exceptionally shiny penny that Dean had kept in his jacket pocket, the face worn smooth from many years of rubbing it between thumb and forefinger. The zipper-pull from Dean’s leather jacket, which he’d thought was lost (long before Cas showed up, and anyway, leaving a leather jacket unzipped looks way cooler). A braided leather bracelet that he hadn’t worn since he’d dated Lisa. One of mom’s old baking spoons, standing straight up out of the mug – one that was basically useless since it’s meant to measure a “smidgen,” and everyone knows baking by weight is more accurate, anyway. Bits of green glass, smooth and worn, collected once upon a time along the banks of a river where Sam and Dean spent a summer goofing off and catching crayfish with their bare hands. A twist of dental floss (

bit more than he had – which is to say, not at all – but he thinks it’s probably forgivable in this instance since he was Extremely Busy off saving the world and all. But he also realizes Castiel deserves to hear the truth, so however much it feels like he’s cracking his own ribcage open and baring his insides, Dean fortifies himself and ducks his head to catch Cas’ eye.
Now, even with a perfect 8 hours of sleep at night (HA!), she is Dean Winchester in the mornings. Seriously. Any time you see Dean lamenting mornings and glorifying his first cup of coffee in my fic? I am he, he is me.
Cas raises an eyebrow. “It does appear so, yes.”
Castiel glances down with a shy smile, which is all the answer Dean needs. Who even knows where Castiel is squirreling them away, but Dean isn’t surprised one bit – just because Castiel was in a human body now didn’t mean he’d stopped collecting little things that belonged to Dean and putting them in his mug, still sitting on the nightstand, a permanent reminder of how things had started between them.
“For what?” Castiel wonders, clearly bewildered by the sudden change in direction.
“Ow!” Sam yelps.
“Sam, stop the car,” Cas suddenly grates into the dark interior of the Impala, the first words he’s spoken in hours.
“I don’t know,” Dean murmurs, reaching a tentative hand out to push at Cas’ shoulder. For a moment, nothing happens. Dean looks up at Sam, lost, before turning back to find Castiel blinking up at him, disoriented but awake.
and said
To Dean’s mortified delight, Castiel sighs out an appreciative sound that stabs right through him, hot and sharp, before Cas takes him in hand and draws the tip of his cock into his mouth. Dean doesn’t have time to stop and think about how Cas knows anything about blow jobs, not while liquid heat spreads across Dean’s insides like oozing honey as Cas slides further down, down, down, drawing a long, low groan from deep in Dean’s chest. He threads his fingers into Cas’ hair, tugging, and drops his head back, eyes closed, overwhelmed by the slick slide of Cas’ mouth over his heated flesh.
“Oh, shit. Are
fell in love with him.
Alrite everybody, here we are at the end of the ride!
He flaps his tiny wings, and Dean thinks for sure that Cas is excited about this alternative to the current nesting situation.
“Dean,” Castiel says solemnly, “I’ve somehow come into possession of Eileen’s underwear.” He looks at the skimpy garment and thinks his face is heating again. “I am… unsure of how to return these to her without– Dean?” Castiel stops, his train of thought thoroughly derailed by the look on Dean’s face: cheeks rosy red, mouth agape, eyes wide and… afraid?

“Eileen?” Castiel asks, confused.

“Sure,” Dean agrees, easy, following Sam into the kitchen. He watches as Sam gropes around in the cabinets for two tall glasses, and accepts one brimming over with cold water from the tap. “Thanks, Sammy,” Dean says before taking a sip, careful to hold Cas away from the water spilling over the sides of the glass.

“As you wish,” Cas finally tells him, and Dean is so relieved he nearly fucking faints. And then the words hit his brain, and —
“Yeah,” Sam agrees, watching as Dean tries to carefully sip from the mug that’s been almost entirely commandeered by Cas, “You don’t want him getting fat.”
She’s certainly not giving up on Cas, either; Dean comes into the library to find Eileen and Sam on opposite sides of a mountain of books, combing through for any little thing they might have missed. From this angle, Dean can see Sam’s foot bumping up against Eileen’s under the table, the fond, private smile on her face, and he realizes he may be interrupting something. But he plows forward anyway, too preoccupied with helping Cas to spend much time worrying about… whatever it is he’s walked into.
a morning person.
“I want to stay here,” Castiel says. “With you. You’re my home, Dean.” He lifts his hand to Dean’s cheek and Dean can’t stop himself from leaning into Cas’ palm, pulse loud in his ears. “You.” Cas’ fingers slide around into Dean’s hair, and he pulls Dean in, kissing him with the intensity Dean’s come to expect when Cas takes something seriously.
The poem from which I drew the title:
“For you to make a move, man! For you to kiss me, I don’t fucking know.” He huffs out a weak laugh. “Listen, Cas. I don’t know about all the other stuff,” he admits, licking his lips nervously, “but I do know all I’ve been able to – to even

what you were getting yourself into with me.” He can’t help the cheeky grin that creeps over his face, and opens his eyes to find Cas staring back at him, fond and exasperated and in love.
raised
“You’re welcome, Sam.”
The blunt answer catches Dean by surprise, and while he’s busy flapping his jaw like a fish, Cas leans in closer. His eyes drop down to Dean’s mouth and back up, and Dean can feel a sudden flush creep up into his face.
did Dean have to even think Cas would welcome it? What Dean wanted didn’t matter, always came second or third or six-hundredth in comparison to the more important shit going on in the world, so why had he thought he could reach out for it?

Castiel calms, dropping to all fours on the bed next to Dean but laying the tip of his tail against Dean’s leg. Dean drops his own phone to the nightstand, then inhales sharply through his nose as he eases his t-shirt over his head, smoldering heat blossoming over the numbness in his shoulder and sharpening into something more acute as he moves. He tosses the shirt across the room and, feeling his heart skip a beat, holds his hand out to Cas. For a long moment Cas just stares, and then he’s sliding into Dean’s lap, pressing his paws into Dean’s chest and reaching up to continue his ministrations. Dean’s shoulder throbs with his heartbeat, heavy and slow.
“Nothing, nothing,” Sam says through his chuckling, “I just never thought I’d hear you baby-talk

Thanks again everyone! ^__^
. He knows he is more than this flesh he’s confined to, limited and small. Dean tucks himself under Castiel’s chin and sucks a mark into his throat, and a supernova goes off in Castiel’s gut, a riot of heat and color. He rides it like a wave, soaring and crashing through sine and peaks and troughs, taking time to realize the surprised gasping he can hear is
Dean staring up at the stars and praying to Cas in purgatory (time period between s7 and 8), Cas in the shadows watching, expression full of the pain of not being able to go over to Dean, but also showing how overwhelmed he is that Dean is still praying to him, the quiet hope that gives him for how Dean feels about him.
“Never better,” Dean says, narrowing his eyes. “Spit it out, Sam.”
sure Gabe didn’t dose his coffee this afternoon, but he honestly wouldn’t put it past his boss to slip a psychedelic into Dean’s drink as “payback” for him having to get all the stupid croissants ready to go by himself this morning.
Castiel looks at Dean with a wary expression, and an unexpected pang in his chest has Dean tightening his grip on Cas as he says in a muted voice, “Don’t look at me like that, man. We just got you back. Right now all I care about is getting you safe, okay?” He draws back far enough to press his palm to Cas’ chest and thinks he’s never been more grateful to feel someone’s heart beating beneath his hands.
“An excellent question,” Castiel says grumpily, and Dean is slammed with a wave of affection at his petulant pout.
Ungluing his ass from the chair, Dean moves to follow Castiel from the kitchen. His feet carry him without any real conscious input from his brain, fast. Cas couldn’t have gotten far. And in fact, Dean rounds a corner to find Cas leaning against the wall, his shoulder and hip pressing against it as though he can’t keep himself up otherwise. There is dejection clear in every line of him. Right here, in this moment, Dean can see every argument, every dismissal, every rejection or hateful word he’d ever doled out to Cas. It’s all right there in the muscles and bones of the slumped form in front of him, and Dean is suddenly, furiously angry with himself. He knows what Cas has done for him. If he’s being brutally honest with himself, he knows
“I could do without the emotional whiplash, thanks,” he grumbles, irritable and prickly.
After so many weeks, though, Dean is used to having the dragon in his space. He’s used to talking to him as a… well a
“This actually presents a somewhat unique opportunity,” Castiel says, unflappable, and Dean and Sam turn to him with twin looks of annoyed confusion.
“Nevermind. I’ll see you later, okay?” Dean pulls the phone away from his ear and hangs up on Sam’s spluttering, effectively distracted. He gingerly puts his mug flat on the counter and leans over it, captivated by the rise and fall of the tiny body inside as the dragon breathes evenly in slumber, feathery wings giving the occasional twitch.

“I thought– I just thought I was gonna have more time with her, man.” His voice comes out so much quieter than he intended.
The string stretched between his heart and Dean’s vibrates, intense and pure, imploring Castiel to make the space between them disappear. He reminds himself that the being – the
“Yes, I do believe we’ve established this as fact,” he says, dry as a desert, but his eyes are smiling.
“Have a nice day,” the barista tells him with a smile, and Dean actually manages to murmur a half-brained “You, too,” before escaping from

Dean chews his lip, nods. Okay. That’s — well, that’s something, at least.

“I was surprised, okay? You caught me off guard and I – I dunno, man, I really thought we were gonna die. But I thought we were gonna go
“Sorry, say that again?”
Dean is driving through Louisiana on his way to visit with friends. He stops, as he always does, at Benny’s all-night diner, and that’s the first time he sees Castiel: sitting at the counter, nursing a steaming mug of coffee at three o’clock in the morning and looking for all the world as though he’d just tumbled out of someone else’s bed, thoroughly fucked. His hair, shiny and dark as a bird’s feather, sticks up in every direction, and he gazes into the distance with eyes hooded and sultry, while Dean stands in the doorway staring, totally fucking gobsmacked.
And looks at Cas helplessly because, really? What is he supposed to say? There’s so much between them now. Too much, maybe.
for the very speedy turnaround on this one.
because of him. He knows that the longer people hang around him, the closer they come to realizing it and bailing. Or worse, getting killed. And Cas has been around for a long time, now. Longer than most. Tipping point has to be somewhere right around the corner.
But Meg only shook her head at him again and pushed past him. “I don’t want to talk to you right now, Cas,” she growled as she went by, marching towards the front gate of the rec center. Castiel watched, shaken, as Meg mounted her bike and kicked off, out of sight down the bike path before he could even throw on his t-shirt, much less pack up his own towel and the blanket.
Dean lifts a hand to cut Cas off. He’s tired and achy, and so done with this whole conversation. He wants a shower and his bed and to be unconscious as quickly as possible so he can be done with this whole day, too. He lets his glass rest on the table, dropping his face into his hands and pressing his palms into his eyes as a headache blooms behind them. Yeah. A
“Anyway, this will hopefully make it easier to find him,” Sam murmurs. Both brothers look over at Jack, who smiles at them again and merely nods. It’s not an answer, but it somehow makes Dean feel slightly less like this is the worst idea they’ve had in a while.
but it’s not the Winchester way, so he redoubles his efforts and gets up early on the weekends to make Castiel breakfast. He asks Cas what he’s reading and they talk about books, which leads them to music, which leads them to food. One night Dean springs for the fancy Italian place down in Concordia. Getting desperate and refusing to examine the feeling in too much detail, Dean pulls out a trick that almost always got him laid and drives Cas out into the flat Kansas wilderness to go stargazing.
“Dude,” Dean says, not sure whether to be embarrassed at the reminder or proud of Cas for the reference, “did you just fucking
“Dean,” Cas sighs, his eyes soft and blue as bottle glass, shining. “More poetry?”
Castiel raised his eyes to where he heard this impossible sound, astonished and uneasy as he watched bright lines of red light splinter and spiderweb through the air around him in a dome of red lightning. A deep, vibrating groan rumbled through his feet, agitating the bubbling surface beneath him. He felt pinned, every edge of him, sharp and soft alike, held firm as the vibrations and the accompanying sound grew in intensity. Red light zig-zagged madly through the darkness, until finally, with the unexpected
The man on the bed smiles broadly, eyes alight with pleasure at seeing Dean, who can only stand there, shaken. The man laughs softly, a deep rumbling sound that makes Dean’s already overloaded nerves send a wobbly signal to his knees. He catches a glimpse of a blue-ish tattoo on the man’s chest and stomach before he props himself up on an elbow, laying on his side, casual, and says, “Hello, Dean,” in a voice that sounds like it crawled up through the depths of the earth. “Welcome home.” When Dean still just stands there flapping his jaw like a moron, the man continues: “I missed you while you were away.”
and there, in the air before him, is a stygian black line, a sort of nothingness that bends the eye away from it but draws all of Dean’s attention nonetheless.
animal, but a
Castiel sits on the edge of his bed heavily, like a sack of potatoes someone carelessly dropped, swaying unsteadily in all directions. Dean reaches out a hand to still him and says, “C’mon, Cas. You gotta get your boots off, at least.” Cas’ eyes, clouded and unfocused, slide over to Dean and he nods slowly in understanding, but makes no move to remove them. Dean hesitates for only a second before falling to his knees beside the bed, bending to pull at the heels of Cas’ black boots and slide them off his feet. He reaches back to set them neatly at the foot of the bed, then lays a cautious hand on Cas’ knee, brushing his thumb lightly over the side of Cas’ thigh. Glancing up at him, Dean announces, “Coat, too.”
basically their kid, and certainly the closest Dean would ever get at this point. However much Dean had been responsible for looking after Sam, or even Ben once upon a time, something about Jack made Dean feel… well, like a dad. Or at least how he figured a dad
Sam laughs. “Aren’t you supposed to be feeding him crickets?” he asks, setting his fork down in favor of his coffee mug.
“Told ya,” she says cheerfully. “Totally normal to give a guy your number.”
He’d just had a rough night. Once he and Cas had both calmed down some, Dean had gone into the bathroom, Cas tagging along behind him, to clean the bite mark on his shoulder and wrap it up in some gauze. The numbness had melted away into a low, dull throb that kept waking Dean up just as he drifted off into sleep. At one delirious point in the night he texted Sam to ask if dragons were venomous at all. He was pretty sure they weren’t, but who knows, it wasn’t like there was a ton of information out there on dragons giving
Pulling back, he demands, amused, “Wait. Wait a second, is that – is that where all my shirts went?” He’d noticed his t-shirt drawer wasn’t quite as full but he’d honestly chalked it up to the ever-growing pile of laundry in his – their – bedroom.
“Shit, Sam, watch it–!”
Dean can hear more page-flipping on the other end of the line. “It, uh, it says here that generally, male dragons will have a colored stripe on the underside of their belly,” Sam says eventually, “and that females tend to be less colorful and even smaller than the males.”
Today, said dark-haired, blue-eyed tall-drink-of-water is behind the counter with his usual black apron tied neatly around his hips. He’s sporting a bright, neon pink t-shirt with a faded sunflower on the front, and a pair of well-worn jeans that, when he turns his back, reveal a tiny tear under his left pocket, a flash of – bright orange? – underwear peeking through. Dean’s brain short-circuits before he even gets to the register.
“Any time,” Castiel replies, and watches, heart hopeful, as Dean heads out the door. He watches as his crush turns to walk down the street, and therefore just so happens to see when Dean stops abruptly, leans the entire top half of his body back, and then practically lifts off the sidewalk with the force of what looks to be an
Dean’s face heats up like a fire’s been lit inside him. He steps closer to Cas, cupping his elbows, the vial of grace dangling by its heavy silver chain from Dean’s fingers. “I choose you, too, Cas,” he says, hushed, and it’s an incantation, a vow. “I’m always gonna choose you, ’cause — ’cause I love you, man. I have for a really long time, longer than I even knew, but — ”
Dean’s heart, almost torn in two, knits itself back together, consoled by the earnest, loving look on Castiel’s face.
Castiel sighs and shifts again, and slowly the nest of feathers shifts, too, until his wings are spread out at his sides, the tips falling down on either side of his bed. His shoulders drawn down from his ears, Cas sits in the middle of the mattress, arms around his knees, barefoot but otherwise clothed, looking miserably uncomfortable.
“Cas,” he says, pushing lightly against Cas until he groans in annoyance.
After they’ve all gotten something warm to drink and Castiel has a cookie to nibble on, they start a leisurely walk through the market, cold air nipping at exposed skin. There’s a lightness to Dean’s step as he and Castiel trail behind Sam and Eileen. A feeling of total peace washes over him as he thinks about how, in this moment, his life feels so very… complete.
“When I left this morning you were a dragon!” he says, desperately trying to grab onto a thread of sanity.
). Having to come up with excuse after excuse for why he can’t go
And Castiel comes along for the ride, placid, smiling sometimes when he thinks Dean’s not looking, noticeably not saying anything about Dean’s behavior and continuing to miss all of Dean’s attempts at what could now only be described as –
So, I drew the little picture of Cas in a fit of artistic abundance; I'm not much of a visual artist but I was inspired. ::shrug::
– weaving in and out and around and between all that is and ever was, touching hearts, the ties that bind. Particle to anti-particle, covalent, magnetic, gravitational, even. The whole of existence, cosmos and quantum alike, the fabric of all realities orbit the nexus of his understanding of himself and the love he holds in his heart of hearts.
, but it’s a gesture that before this moment held little meaning for Dean other than the fact that Castiel undressing unaccountably made his head spin sometimes. He suddenly, vividly, remembers that one time he helped Cas get ready for the date-that-wasn’t and what that had done to him — seeing enough of Cas’ exposed collarbones to make his mouth go dry — so it’s no real shock that now it’s making Dean
, followed by
At this, Dean’s confusion disappears and is replaced with an almost bashful smile. He drops his eyes to Castiel’s chin for a moment before looking back up.
Frustrated and embarrassed, Castiel ducks his head and trades places with Charlie at the register again. Which does him exactly zero good, because instead of continuing on his journey to work, Dean marches right back into
It’s what family does, after all.
near-escape from death. It makes the headache beating against the inside of his skull throb even more vigorously.
Dean.
And he watched, stricken, as Dean calmly drew an angel blade from somewhere in his jacket, pressed the tip to his own heart, and drove the blade in to the hilt.
Something in Castiel’s voice sounds so small and terrified. He can barely hear it, but it’s there. Dean swallows again, and then Dean sits.
But first, he’s gotta talk to Cas about him knockin’ out all over the place.
“Cas —” Dean tries to interrupt, but Cas turns back to him, lightning in his eyes.
“Now, Bass I could see bending over, but you?” Lee shook his head before pinning Dean with a knowing look. “You, Dean. What would your daddy say if he knew…?”
Stepping into Dean’s space, Castiel reaches for Dean’s hand and tangles their fingers together, the soft pink panties crushed between their palms. He pushes his other hand into Dean’s hair and strokes a thumb over his cheekbone, watching in fascination as Dean’s gaze drops to his mouth, tongue darting out to wet his lips, before looking back up into Castiel’s eyes, startled but not moving away. Castiel can feel every inch of his skin and it makes him want to fly apart.
It’s sure not the first time Dean’s had such a thought; the crazy thing is, this time he thinks he wants to
. Naomi Novak was an imposing woman, hard in some places and soft in others, but whatever else could be said about her, she loved her children very much, and Castiel knew he could leave his heart in her hands when it was too heavy to carry around himself.
But no. The next morning –
“Yeah,” Aaron agreed, breathless. “I’ll meet you at the lake.”
Shuffling around in search of coffee one particularly chilly morning, Dean stumbles upon Castiel slumped over on the kitchen table like his strings have been cut, wings flopped over like they’re asleep, too. For a second, Dean’s brain goes white with fear, but it hiccups back online pretty quickly, realizing that Cas
; he hears the high-pitched screeching whine of angel radio and the horrifying screams and growls of demons great and small, blending together in an echoing cacophony, reverberating inside him to his core. He puts his hands over his ears and squeezes his eyes shut, grits his teeth against the agony of sound in this place. Shit. How is he going to find Cas if he can’t even fucking stand up?
Dean immediately shakes his head, a familiar spike of anxiety stabbing through him and a staunch denial resting on his lips, ready to fire, but Cas keeps talking. “And, it looks like you’ve already forgotten, but you
can hear you,” Castiel groans, pissy and in pain. He stirs, tries to push himself up, but Dean holds him down with disturbing ease. He slides his hand from Cas’ chest to the side of his neck, thumb brushing over Cas’ pulse absently, an automatic offer of comfort Dean tries to convince himself he would give to anyone with equally little deliberation.
“If I return to Heaven —” Cas stops and looks cautiously at Dean’s face, an apology in his eyes, though Dean has no idea what it’s for. “If I go back, I won’t be permitted to return to Earth. I’ve already broken the rules.”
, Jesus Christ. “Yeah, uh, with milk and sugar.”
He comes back to himself with a gasp, dragging in air and head snapping back before falling forward into Cas, grabbing onto his shoulders and panting heavy. The remains of whatever-that-was and the aftershocks of his orgasm have Dean shaking like a leaf.
“Well, give me a fucking minute here, okay!” Dean blurts out, thoroughly freaked. “You could be wearing a goddamn three-piece suit, I’m still trying to wrap my head around you even
Dean knows he’ll have to talk to Sam eventually, but if he has anything to say about it, it will only be when he’s backed into a corner and so drunk no one could blame him if he breaks down sobbing. Castiel’s absence in the car is already pressing on him; he can’t imagine how bad it’s going to be back at the bunker, seeing Castiel everywhere and knowing he’s never coming back.
But he also knows, now, the unadulterated joy of that same grain of sand, washed over and tumbled about, surrounded, however briefly, by the thing it loves most, knowing the ocean is a constant and its return is guaranteed. Simply existing in such a space, moving through the cycle,
They’d burned him, and if he were a normal person, Dean guesses a burning body would be the thing to stick with him, but no: Dean can’t stop picturing Castiel’s wings burnt into the ground. For every other angel, that’s always spelled The End with big fat capital letters, no extra lives left to use. He can’t get Cas’ wings out of his mind, how their afterimage lay charred and ashy in the dirt, twisted and ruined, an echo of magnificence. Dean can only imagine – he could tell by whatever was left of them they had once been enormous, glorious. Seeing them broken, feathers missing and all askew, made Dean’s heart ache. He’d imagined, once upon a time, someday seeing Cas’ wings, but never in this way, and never with so much pain hitching a ride on the memory.
Dean looks up and his eyes roam over every inch of Castiel’s face, as they often do, now. Like he’s making sure Cas is actually, physically here. Like he’s hoping this isn’t all some fucking fever dream. Castiel isn’t sure himself, sometimes. Right now, he can’t be sure he isn’t imagining the quiet hitch in Dean’s breathing, the hesitant look when their gazes clash, the way his jaw flexes as he swallows nervously.
at Dean sometimes… Dean had wanted to
“Get up, sunshine,” Dean commands, sliding his hand down to Cas’ elbow and giving him an encouraging tug. “Let’s get you to bed, okay?”
Sam came around to stand beside Dean. Put a hand on his shoulder and looked at him. Dean didn’t need to say anything, didn’t need to ask. He knew Sammy was looking at him like it might be the last time he ever laid eyes on his big brother.
Cheeks gone so red Castiel is certain Dean is about to combust, he watches Dean lick his lower lip, his face clouded in thought. After a long moment he meets Castiel’s eyes and says, soft, “Okay, Cas. Yeah, I will.”
He wraps his hand around Dean and gives him a long, slow stroke, and the needy huff of sound that falls from his mouth goes straight through Castiel, making him shudder, an aftershock of pleasure on its heels. He pushes into Dean’s pants, sliding his palm around his sac, rolling it in his fingers. He watches Dean twitch and draws his hand out, dragging light fingertips up his length. Castiel looks at Dean and sees need written all over his face.
Dean looks at Cas, his tired eyes and rounded shoulders, the long, sparkling droop of his wings and the multiple, weirdo glowing spots all over his body, and offers him a smile. “You hungry? I can make you some cinnamon toast.”
But… Dean’s insistence on finding Castiel before he left – on leaving
“Sorry, Cas,” Dean murmurs, reaching for him, but the dragon ducks Dean’s hand and scrambles up on to the nightstand in an impressive series of acrobatic twists. He looks at Dean over his shoulder, then waddles over to his mug and grips the rim, peering inside. His head disappears into the mug for a moment, and when he lifts it back out Cas is holding a long, blue flight feather in his mouth.
Dean swallows visibly, his jaw working as he searches for a response. Castiel waits. Pets a tentative hand down Dean’s side, takes root at his hip. Can’t ignore the pang of lust that shoots through him when Dean darts his tongue over his lips, unconsciously tantalizing.
, but I can also promise that the rest of the chapter (and really this story on the whole) is just domestic and flufftacular.

“Yeah, well, it’s snowing, and according to everything Sam could dig up, you should be hibernating right now, so.” Dean lifts his eyes to Castiel’s and gives one final tug on the scarf, satisfied. “Gotta make sure you stay warm, at least.”
For real, this time.
about this thing with you and Eileen.”
. It’s about fucking time.”
“Man,” he says, addressing the dragon curled up in his scarf, “how come you wanna stay inside with me all the time?” Dean shakes his head as they pass under an old ginko tree, its yellow, fan-shaped leaves drifting down to the sidewalk, getting caught up underfoot. “It’s so freakin’ nice out here in the fall. I’d be outside all day if I could. Sitting around with a beer and a bonfire? Hell yeah.” He laughs softly when Cas chitters up at him in agreement.
“Sorry, Dean–!”
“Don’t worry, Dean,” Castiel interrupts, piercing him with his intense gaze, seeing everything, seeing
“I want this,” Dean says, tone sure and voice steady. He raises his eyes to Castiel’s. “I want
– out of his misery.
“Uh,” he says stupidly. “Um. Yeah. I mean, no, I–” Dean shakes his head and laughs lightly, flustered, and surprised to find himself so. “I could stay a minute,” he finally manages, “if you wanted some company.”
Clearing his throat and hoping his face isn’t on fire, Dean backs out of his own bedroom with his tail between his legs. “Uh,” he says, “gonna go get that coffee now.”
Dean knows he’s poison. He knows everyone that has ever mattered to him –
He’s stopped in front of a potter’s booth and has his bare hands wrapped around a tall, cylindrical mug glazed in white. The very rim is a rich blue color, reminiscent of Castiel’s tattoo. Of his feathers. Dean immediately sees why the mug caught his eye. For a moment, Dean just watches Castiel’s face, looking for any signs of regret there. But all Dean can see is quiet contemplation and a wistfulness that takes his breath away.
Clutching himself tighter, wrapped into a ball of confusion and grief and fury, Dean screams into the empty room.
. I don't post often but it's pretty much my writing plus all the deancas content I can get my grubby hands on.
But… Aaron, with his big, sad brown eyes and his pouty lower lip, and the way he
For a minute Dean is frozen. This gesture seems so much more… intentional that Dean is used to expecting from Cas, more weighty. He’s not entirely sure how to respond, and when he takes too long to do so Cas moves back down onto his chest and noses at the feather itself, pushing it a little bit towards Dean, then looks back up at him with his eyes wide and expectant.
“Yeah, Sammy,” Dean answered, quiet and resigned. Sammy would be looking for reassurance, now, that Dean was okay. “You can come in.”
The pressure against Castiel’s skin finally gives way with a
“That won’t be necessary, Dean. But thank you,” Jack says primly. “I don’t intend to stay for long.”
The fact of the matter was: even before he had laid eyes on Dean Winchester’s soul, he had felt its pull somewhere beyond his understanding of himself. A moth never questioned why it flew to the flame. It only knew it had to go, as Castiel knew, he
To his credit, Sam looks contrite when he says, “Hey, no. Seriously, I’m happy about this.” He smiles, and Dean thinks he can see relief there, too.  “I’m happy for you guys. Please be gross about it. Be as gross as you want. I’ve been watching you both avoid the hell out of this for years now. I thought, maybe, you both just needed a little… push?”
Dean is gazing at him, the ghosts of sadness and regret on his face. Dean lifts a hand and drags his thumb over Castiel’s lower lip, rests it over the split. “I wanna get it right with you,” he says, earnest and open. “I wanna do this right.”
– compared to how badly his heart hurts now.
“Yeah, well. Stupid was kinda all I had left,” Dean mutters to his coffee mug.
Dean swallows. “Well, yeah.  I mean, Mom, too.  But Cas– I watched you die.  Again.  But you didn’t–  you didn’t come back.  I burned you, man.  I lit the pyre, made sure I did right by you.  And it felt–” He cuts himself off abruptly, too close to saying something he’s certain he’ll regret. Castiel is looking at him, not with pity, but with a softness that Dean’s never felt he deserved from anyone, least of all the angel sitting across from him. Just because it had felt like he was burning away any chance at ever being… well, happy… didn’t give him the right to ever ask anything more of Cas, now he was back.
After a couple of weeks of this Dean finds himself tearing his attention away from Castiel’s mouth, endlessly thinking about what it’s gonna feel like when he caves and kisses Dean. Every night when he walks Cas to his room, Dean’s gaze wanders to Cas’ lips without his conscious input, and he catches himself willing Cas more and more fervently to just – just fucking
before he thinks, yeah, okay. Watching Cas make himself a bowl of cereal one morning, Dean decides he’s going to test this theory. He can’t… he can’t outright
“Sorry about that,” he says again as he hands over the coffee. “I must have grabbed the wrong one.”
Coming back to his room, Dean walks in like he’s going to the gallows and closes the door behind him. He drops the six-pack on his desk with a heavy
at the bottom of his cup.
Confused, Castiel pulls his phone from his pocket and hands it over.
The wound on his arm was long, and the part cutting through the meat of his forearm was
Castiel’s frown gets impossibly deeper. “What do you mean?”
He hasn’t thought about it much since he’d had an archangel riding him, but after Michael, Dean is much more wary of angelic…
Sam looks offended but all Dean can do is laugh. It figures that this weird, grumpy little dragon would prefer Dean, card-carrying member of the Last Person On Earth To Own an Animal Companion Club until only a few weeks ago, to Sam, who would adopt every goddamn dog in the state if he had the space to keep them.
Dean shifts on his feet and looks away, which is answer enough. Castiel looks at him levelly and can’t quite stop himself from saying, “And here you were always the one telling
Castiel draws his eyes up Dean’s face, earnestly looking. His gaze pierces something inside of Dean that hasn’t seen the light in a
“Yes, of course,” Castiel answers. He reaches across Dean’s lap to take his hand and twine their fingers together, warm through their gloves.
So it was with no small measure of aggravation that the longer he followed the glowing path beneath his feet, the more Castiel realized there was a familiar quality to this sensation, of walking through labyrinthine corridors hung with shadows and yet knowing precisely which turns to take; he was called, compelled, and he chose to answer this call, moving towards it with purpose, that purpose being to finally shake some sense into Dean Winchester’s thick skull.
gesture.
, but Dean feels like a blushing, fumbling teenager when Cas’ tongue darts out to wet his lip.
“Okay, smartass,” Dean says, calm spreading through his chest, gradually overtaking the thought of losing Cas again that had settled cold and heavy inside him. “What’d that witch do to you?”
For a long minute, nothing happens, the entire field frozen as though in amber, waiting. Then, Castiel’s whole, gigantic body shivers and vibrates, the edges of him blurring and wisping away, ripples of swirling light twisting and coalescing into a thin stream that slowly dances through the air on its way back into Cas’ vessel, still on the ground behind Dean. He lifts his head and watches as Castiel’s true form dissolves into the stream of light, disappearing right out from under Dean’s hands and seeping back into his vessel, imbuing it with the same intense star-bright glow before settling into Cas’ skin and disappearing.
“Doin’ alright up there, Cas?” Dean asks after he pulls a stitch too tight and they’ve both been silent long enough for it to be awkward. “Didn’t pass out on me, didja?”

– feels too jumbled up and raw. He feels like he’s separated from his body, caught up in the endless sweep of emotions that want to carry him away.
“Okay, okay. I know, uh. I know I’m not perfect,” he begins haltingly, “and I know I’ve been– well, I’ve been an asshole about a bunch of things.” He lets out a small self-deprecating laugh. “And I bet you’re super pissed that I– uh, that I ruined your sacrifice and all–”
Overhead, a sound like shattering glass crashed into Castiel’s awareness, something strangely tangible in the evanescent expanse of the Empty, substantial in a way nothing else was or felt.
Re·un·ion
And maybe Dean will never be able to understand him again, but he feels a tiny blossom of pride in his chest, knowing he helped make Jack who he is. Whatever else he may be, Jack is
, Castiel knows
Castiel reaches out.
Looking up, focusing on Castiel’s face, Dean meets his eyes and lets go of another long breath. He rises to the top of his knees and scoots closer to Castiel, almost touching. He looks down at his own shoulder, feels the throb of the bite under his bandages, then turns and tentatively reaches a hand out to Castiel, murmuring, “Can I…?”
“Cas, no offense, but shut up and let me do this, okay?” He smiles to take the sting out of it, but he’s suddenly combating a swarm of butterflies in his stomach like he’s some fresh-faced adolescent with his first crush. He can’t ignore them, so he focuses on Castiel’s eyes, earnest and patient and so, so blue.
An awkward silence falls over them. Sam opens his mouth, closes it, clears his throat. He twists around in his chair to face Cas more fully. “You know… Dean cares about you, right?” he asks, cutting right to the point, however uncomfortable it is for everyone involved.
but he doesn’t want to hurt Cas.
of any of what they’d suffered over the years?
With a shrug, Dean turns on the tap and refills his glass, shutting the water off
it reaches the top, geez, Sam. “Dunno,” he says, turning around and leaning back against the edge of his big kitchen sink. “I always thought it was too plain for a dragon, especially after you made that big deal about the fancy nests, but Cas kept picking it over every other nest I tried to make him, so.”
This chapter is a bit short and I suspect that we are all going to need a pick-me-up one way or another tonight, so I'll probably be posting chapter 4 this evening. After I'm done crying my eyeballs out.
“What–”
to sleep because of this stupid curse — spell —
“Do they make you feel good?” Castiel interrupts, giving the side of Dean’s neck a gentle squeeze.
to Dean, and he is a complete disaster about it.
Sam was acting weird, he left at ungodly hours and came back very late for weeks, I am not the kind of person to intrude on my brother's life but it was weird. Whenever I saw Sam, he seemed happy. I shared those thoughts with Cas one night while we were in bed. Cas doesn't sleep but when there is not a case to work with, he lays down with me at night.
“I don’t know what's on your mind Jack” I start the spanking. I’m not using the pattern that I was doing before. I’m concentrating on his upper cheeks only, faster than before, but without much force. I know he heals faster than a normal human, but the timing is just right.
“You just don't want to give it a chance Cas, you know if you get hooked up with it you will not stop,” He told me while laughing. And I think that his words have some truth behind them. I can be very obsessive with tv shows.
“Jack, drop the attitude I’m warning you, or we are going to have a longer talk that we need to with the help of my spoon” Cas grins at me without Jack noticing. Cas knows how much I hate when he uses that phrase with me.
“Not really D, but it's pretty obvious what's happening with him, but as Char told you, we aren't going to ruin the surprise,” Jo tells me while laughing. I still don't understand what's funny about Sam's behavior.
“Good morning Sammy” He looks up, and smiles.
----------------
And speaking of the brothers, I love them with all my heart. Dean is obvious as he is the love of my life, but Sam is like a kid brother to me. If I could compare the kind of love that I feel for him is just like what I feel for Gabe.  I know that I'll never be at the same level as Dean with him, but I do love him and would move mountains to keep him safe and well.
“Yes, I know baby, but it doesn't hurt being there, as support for both of you. He is my baby you know?” I smiled at his last statement.
“Yes Dean, and that's why we need to make him understand that he needs to be prepared. I can tell you that he thinks that he is invincible because of his powers, but when we started our family we all decided that Jack needed structure in his life. Just like you need it. We all do” He looks at me.
Afterward, I decided to take his hand to mine and spanked him on his sit spot, where he is going to feel it when he sits
Hope you guys like it, and expect another chapter soon.
“I will check your schoolwork Jack, I can tell you that you are doing fine and maybe are ready to do something more advanced '' Sam tells Jack, and Jack bites his lip. I think that's not something he wants to do right now.
“Good morning Dean, why are you awake this early, will you like to go for a run?” I looked at Sam, he really was crazy, I don't know why loves to run, it only takes me back to a place where dad made us run till we threw up. “You know I don't like to run, I don't even know why you do that every morning”
“You know I'm not going to kill him,” I told him with a raised eyebrow.
”We will see Jack after you're finished and eat lunch” Jack rolled his eyes without Cas noticing. Thank God.
Sam has heard what he needed to and thinks that it's better to leave us alone with Jack so he finishes his meal and leaves the kitchen. He does have a say in raising Jack, but I think he sees that we have it. He may give us his opinion later. Jack doesn't like Cas scolding so he decides to throw another tantrum and starts to yell
I'm also trying to teach him how to cook, and some mechanic stuff. I don't let him get near Baby but there are many vehicles here at the bunker that he can get his hands-on, and he loves that. I'm going to help him to be the best mechanic in the world, even if that's the last thing that I will do. He needs something to live from if he ever decides that hunting is not the life he wants. Because let's be honest I don't think that we can get out, but maybe he can do it.
“Celeste is a beautiful name, you know that I'm never going to stop calling you that, Celeste” He teases, he usually calls her Charlie, but right now i think he is in a mood after the Jack situation, he relaxes a little when Jo responds
“You know me baby”
“Okay Dad, I’ll try my best” with that he finishes his meal in silence. I don't know what's wrong with this household, first Sam acting strange and now Jack, being a teenager. It is going to be hard if he keeps that attitude. It even helped me a little to think about Jack, as I worried about him, Sam was out of my thoughts for that moment.
“No thank you, Cas, See you guys later” Sam leaves the kitchen, and Cas looks at me.
Cas and I were happy that's the important thing. We love each other, and we just knew that life without the other was horrible. Both had died more than once, the last time that i lost Cas i just lost it and Jack paid the price. That's something I will always regret, not only because when Cas returned from the Empty he was so disappointed that i took my anger and grieve at him, but right now the kid is my life. Jack was just so lovable and did not deserve the way I treated him those months ago.  Right now we are just a happy family of hunters living day by day as we can.
“Jack, this is your last warning stop interrup--”
He gives me a hug knowing how hard it was for me to discipline Jack so harshly. I kiss him.
“Nothing really, Sammy. We were just checking Jack. He is catching up on his homework”
“Thank you Dads” He leaves the kitchen.
His answer is a surprise for everyone on the table, Cas looks at me a little bit proud, I almost choke on the chicken I was eating and Sam seems excited.
“I know Cas, I just want him to be safe, and he is not ready. I've been hunting for years and I train all the time. I want him to have a normal life too but we know what is out there”
“Well he says that he has not completed his assignments Sam so he is finishing up right now, you know how much I care about his schoolwork,” Cas says.
After finishing my workout I went to take a shower. I was putting on some pants when my phone starts ringing. It’s Charlie.
“Hi Jack, how are you doing”
I woke up, without Cas by my side, I looked at my alarm clock and it was 5:30 AM, I usually wake up at 7, so this is my opportunity to talk with Sam. I stood up and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get dressed, I like to sleep without a shirt because that way I can feel Cas better.
“Don't be like that, I'm serious about this”
I just want him to be happy.
After cleaning the kitchen, I decided to work out, I'm not as lazy as Sam thinks I am, and it may help me to understand what's happening. I started stretching and now I’m going to lift some weights.
“I didn’t think about that Dad. I thought you only wanted to control my every move”. “We just want you safe kiddo. We love you” “I love you too dads” That’s the Jack I know. His attitude is gone and we haven't started his punishment. I think I’m not going to be that hard on him. He doesn't need to know though.
Oh, it's okay Lee, take care of yourself and keep me posted. If there's something we can do to help you know where I am.
“Well let's finish this” “Finish what?” He asks hopefully. “Your punishment of course. When I say I’m doing something you know I’m going to do it, kid”. I stand him up. “Lose the jeans kiddo” He looks at me, then at Cas “Please, Dad your hand hurts enough through the jeans”.
“Young man, listen to me well. We are not going to accept this kind of attitude. We can talk about it like normal people so stop the attitude”
Jack enters the kitchen. We stand up and start our little routine to set the table. Usually, I pour drinks, Sam serves the food and Jack puts everything else on the table. Cas as he doesn't eat he pours himself some tea.
“Another thing you need to understand is that we respect your decisions and wishes, and if you decided to be a hunter we wouldn't want you to miss school. It's something important to learn.  In this world, there is no way that my son is going to be ignorant. Not even Dean decided to not finish school. Options Jack” Cas said from the sink, finishing the dishes.
“WHAT?”Jack asks worriedly. ”Of course Jack, your punishment is going to take place after we talk. Anyway, you’re going to make time to train, it's not going to be all the time. I know that you think that your powers are enough, but you don't control them that well, and even if you did, what happens if they can block them? You’re not going to be helpless because you think you can do it” I think my words are making sense to him. He seems calmer.
“I think you’re handing this good Dean. I support anything you decide” I check my clock and ten minutes have passed. We enter the kitchen.
“Well, I think that you guys called at the right moment, I think that something is wrong with Sam” I stop myself for a moment to think. “Well maybe not something wrong but he is acting weird”
“Celeste and Joanne, How are you?” Cas asks, without waiting for them to guess I pout, and before I can say anything, Charlie responds.
“Dad, please!, I’m ready to talk” I stopped the spanking “Well let's talk”. He tries to stand up. I stop him.  “Are you not letting me up?” “No I think this way, you’re going to be careful of what you say” “Not fair Dad” “Never said it was, tell me, Why are you so against training?”
They’re not acting fair. They want me to be a kid, and I was just having fun. It's not like I'm putting my life in danger. They are really strict, well Dad is, Dean on the other hand lets me get away with things. When Dad came from the empty he decided to give me some rules, and the biggest one is “don't put your life in danger”, and it's not like I'm going to. I’m not stupid.
“How much time till you finish that Jack”
Right now he is laying by my side watching Doctor Sexy. I don't know why he loves that show. I think he has a crush on the protagonist, and I find that humorous. Dean having a crush on a fictional character. The show has no plot, only drama, and sex, so I try to not watch it.
“Your education is important Jack and watch that attitude, I'm not in the mood, ask your father,” Cas says in a no-nonsense tone. My heart always stops when he calls me Jack's father, it's not a bad feeling let me tell you.  “You should take it more seriously, I don't want to hear again that you’re slacking off, you know that I'll take your privileges, such as your cellphone, videogames or laptop if you don't,” He says warning Jack
I just wanted to start writing again, this is a filler chapter. I hope that soon I can post something more exciting. I tried with different POVS. So let me know if it was okay.
“Nothing really, I've just been busy.” “Busy with what?” I ask him like when he was younger and I just caught him taking a cookie from the jar. At that moment Cas enters the kitchen eyeing me with his disapproving look.
“Don't be ridiculous Dean,  he is fine and maybe he is just happy. It's been months since we trapped Lucifer in heaven, maybe Sam just stopped worrying about him and is trying to live his life, for the first time the fullest, you know how much my brother has affected Sam’s psych” I looked at him, and maybe he is right, but something just doesn't add up. Sure, we were having a good streak with hunts after Lucifer was trapped by Gabriel, but Sam is not the kind of guy to just smile all the time and someone that disappears without telling us where he is going. I was lost in my thoughts when I felt his hand on my butt.
“Hi Red, how are my little sisters doing?”
“YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP” They said at the same time, I chuckled. “What's new Dean?”
I took Jack under my wing as I should have done when he was born. I'm going to be honest. At first, I tried to get close to him for Cas, because the kid is Cas' world. Now I would do anything for the kid, and with him, our lives just got better. The kid is like a mini-god with more powers than he can control but we are helping him with that.
-------------
It had been years of them together. At first, it was really hard. He didn’t know what it was. He just wanted it to be Cas. Sam always knew what was going on, and teased him mercilessly.
”Well you’re being unfair!!!!!, I don't want to train I want a normal LIFE!”
”Fine Dad, is there anything I can help you with? You know how easily I get distracted without music” He says respectfully. Jack really is a wonder to me. How after rolling his eyes at Cas, he can be that respectful?
“He is in the kitchen Dean. He is doing lunch” Cas was looking at JAck and decided to sit down next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So what are we going to do Cas, I want to finish what I started, but I know you like to have a final say on this kind of thing” And I do, I’m in charge of the house, but Dean does have a say.
“Dean as you don't understand why I don't watch the show, I don't understand why you watch it,” I tell him. He seems as if he is going to start our typical fight about the show, listing all the good things about the show, but decides not to.
“I thought you never asked Jack. I've been thinking about it, but I didn't want to pressure you about it”
“Yes you were Jack” That was the only thing I needed to say
Remember this is fiction. If this offends you, and you decide to read the chapter or this story after reading the tags, I'm sorry.
“Love you Cas”
“Don't raise your voice at us, we are just tryi--”
“Good,”  He tells him and hugs Jack, then goes to his office with Jacks' phone. There is a locked drawer warded with Enochian symbols for this purpose.
I needed to be in control of my family. I know that sounds possessive, but it's not like that. It's like I can't help them if I don't know what's going on, and I can't protect them from themselves without the rules, and I have to follow them too. So it's not like it's unfair to them.
“OW DAD!, I was rude, and disrespectful to you two.”
“We know that's true sometimes, but let me tell you that I warned him about his attitude too”
Did I mention that I was a control freak?
“Hi Blondie, how is hunting-free life going?” I asked knowing that hunting for her is never going away, but she is trying to distance herself a little bit. They help us with research and intel all the time, but going on a hunt is another story.
Warnings:
“You finished with that, maybe we can do some hand to hand training after lunch kiddo” “Sure Dean”.
“Why not Dean is not like I need it if I’m going to try a normal life” “Don’t interrupt your father Jack, he has a point” Cas reprimands
Having him in our lives has been challenging. We have made lots of rules for him and for us, we don't want him to make mistakes by following ours. Also, we want him to have the life that we didn't have (Sam and I), we spoil him a lot. He has everything that he needs and more. He has been obsessed with Harry Potter and Sam loves that, and to be honest, I love that too, I've always liked Harry Potter, but I was too embarrassed about it, and now I have an excuse to explore that with him.
“But I’m not going to have time for that!,OWWWWWWW!” He yells, and I spank his thighs twice. “Really kid?, I thought you were ready to talk” "I’m ready Dad, I’m sorry”. “Well I’ll let that slide, but start the yelling again, and we will continue our discussion with your bare bottom and then start your punishment”.
“What do you mean? He seems fine to me”
“First of all, we need to get up. Then I’m going to check on Jack. Will you join me? Or are you going to get lunch started
“What kind of weird Dean?”Is Sam Okay?” They ask at the same time
That was just the way they lived, and if Cas made those mistakes too he could punish him too, I know it's strange but Cas never did the kind of things that I do without a good reason. And this structure worked for them as a team, sometimes even Sam had to respond to him too. Their job was dangerous enough to make it easier to get hurt. If Sam, got out of hand and put his life at risk Dean just set him straight, it really didn't happen that much to be honest, but I'm getting off-topic.
“You finished your schoolwork, Jack?” Cas asks
To be honest, I just want something in common with Alex, she is a good friend, and I love everything about her. She told me that people in high school go to parties, do sports, and there are clubs for everything. Maybe here in Lebanon, I can start my own club.
“You better believe it, and I wouldn’t be that lenient, you know that” I remind him with a pat on his butt. He squirms a little.
“Why is that Jack?” Cas asked him, the kid sometimes was oblivious about body language but the tone of Cas' question made him shift on his seat.
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
When our family was only Dean, Sam, and I, it was easier, because there were only rules that regarded our safety. Then Jack came to my life and I tried to keep them, but after I came from the empty I realized that Jack was just a kid in a grown-up body, and he needed structure.
Hi, I decided to post another chapter, I do want to start to post more but real life comes and takes over.
Claire sometimes shows up and even if they appear to be the same age, he needs a lot to learn, so she is like a big sister to him. They have so much fun together and get into trouble but that's how it is with siblings. When she comes, we need to be prepared.  She really is something else, sometimes she brings Kaia too, and really those kids just disappear to do god knows what, but they are not doing anything dangerous so it's fine.
When Cas was out of the kitchen, I looked at Jack and talked to him.
I think I've been lost on my little mind for a little bit because Cas and Sam are talking about something else.
“Jack I want you in that corner, thinking about your attitude, this spanking was just to calm you down, we will tell you when you can come out, it's going to be fifteen minutes” Jack looks at me with fire in his eyes “I wish you cut that attitude, you know that if you don't you're going to lose the privilege of having something to protect your butt for our discussion”.
I think Dean is freaking out because there hasn't been a hunt in weeks. And I'm concerned that Dean is going to do something stupid about it. He is just like that.
“Yes, sometimes I do”
“Cas, I can think about a thing or two we can do with this time” I blink at him, and with that, we start making out on our bed.
Dean spanked Jack. DEAN SPANKED JACK. I can't believe it. If I'm being honest, I was going to do just that, but he did it first. Jack was being rude with that attitude of his. We are his parents, not his friends. I don't blame Sam for leaving. He just knew how this was going to go, I think that I did too, and didn't stop Jack at first, because I thought the warnings were enough.
“So if you warned him too, why are you being like that with me?”
So I decided to post another chapter, the inspiration just kept going and i needed to write. Hope you guys enjoy this.
I think we need to hunt, and as the leader of our little family, I usually try to find things for the family to stay balanced. Normally, Cas takes control of the domestic part of our life, but when hunts are concerned, it's up to Sam or me. Cas is a good fighter, and his heart is in a good place, but we have more experience hunting than him, and even so, Sam looks up to me when we’re hunting.
----------
“I know Cas, I just hate to see him in pain. As you said we are not his friends, we are his parents and we deserve respect, that’s why I spanked him. If I was being unreasonable, and disrespectful to you or Sam, or even him I know that you would spank me” He looks at me again.
Anyway, I think I see a point because I want to go to college, not that they know, but it's not like there is a deadline to finish highschool. I decided to get out my Math books to finish the assignment that was due soon. I wish I had my phone to listen to some music. When I work without music I get distracted pretty easily.
“Everything is going to be fine, and if it's not, I will help you with whatever is happening”.
“Love you Cas”.
I sit down on a chair and pull him over my knee. I start to smack his jean-clad butt. I really am tired of his attitude.
“Hey, guys, what's up?” Sam says
“As I said, you are always welcome here, this is your home too”. At that moment, Cas enters our room and I put my phone on speaker. “Guys guess who just came into my room” He looks at me and I mouth: “Red and Blondie”.
HEEEEEEEEEEY!, What's that supposed to mean?
Also, English is not my first language so be patient. The story doesn't have a Beta. If any grammar/spelling mistakes need to be fixed, I appreciate it if you point them out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry Dad, really” “I know Jack” He doesn't stop the hug so I don't. He is still crying, a little.
“Yes Dad, I did. Sorry about my attitude this morning. Something I just feel strong emotions and I can't control it”
“Yes Sir” Jack's eyes start to water a little and he responds without an attitude
After that text, I decided to get back to the bunker and avoid Dean at all costs. It's not going to be easy, but not impossible.
“Well it's not about school at all, but I think that I'm ready to meet people my age. Claire says that I need a little normal if I'm not really that interested to be a hunter full time”. If I thought that his answer before surprised me this one did. I didn't know that my kid didn't want to be a hunter. I know that we wanted to give him options, but it surprises me. “You don't want to be a hunter kid?”
“What's the point of training if I'm going to be busy with school and social life?” “Excellent question kid, I want you to be prepared for anything. You may not be hunting but you're our son. You’re in danger of anything. You know we all have many enemies out there”
“Okay dads I’m sorry” there are tears on his face. We are getting through him.
“I don't see how this is fair Dad. IF I DECIDE TO NOT HUNT THERE IS NO NEED TO TRAIN. I'm not useless, you know I do have my powers!”
“So you guys just called to check up on big bro then?” I ask grinning
Sam tells Dean that he is keeping a secret from them. Jack finishes his schoolwork and has an idea. Trouble arises.
“So, what are we going to do today? I talked with the girls about Sam, and they seem to think I'm stupid by not knowing whats going on, but they said that its something good”
“I'll try Cas, but you know that when it comes to Sammy, I just act, and I'm telling you something is not right” The truth is that I'm a control freak, and sometimes when things are not as they usually are my mind just goes away with anxiety. I really hope that nothing is wrong with him. Cas knows this, and he just hugs me tighter
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
“Well kid, please try to do your work, and know that if this happens again you’re going to be in trouble with me too” He stares at his plate. He knows that I am on board to punish him when there is something wrong with his attitude or actions.
Sam turns the stove off and covers our lunch. He sits down at the table. We joined him.
“Hi Dean, I’m doing my last assignment.” I smiled and was relieved that he did his work.
“OW,OWWWWWW! DAD!” I can feel him crying.
“Cas, everything okay?” I ask him, he never can hide anything from me, his smile is just because of the conversation with the girls don't let him fool you with that precious smile.
And you may think that he is an abusive bastard as my dad was, but he isn’t. The kind of life that i have lived requires me to not be stupid and put myself in the line more than I need to. That’s the only way of life that I know. That’s the only thing that I learned from my father, I needed that structure, to be taken in hand by someone. At first, it was his father, then Bobby, and now Cas, obviously Cas knew his limits and only gave me what I could take, he never crossed the line as my father did. I have always been following orders and giving them to Sam as second in command but those orders were only made to keep him safe. It really did wonders for him.
“Well, I've been slacking on my homeschool work so I'm trying to make up for the lost time” That was not the answer that I expected when Cas came back from the Empty, he decided that we needed some ground rules, to make Jack's upbringing easier, and one of those rules is to not slack on school work. I looked at Cas, and his demeanor changes, he looks at Jack with his stern, ”you're in trouble face”.
I know I said Claire, she has told me things too, but Claire doesn't know how to live a normal life. She loves hunting, Alex does not, after she went to live with Jody, she decided to go to school and she loves it.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
“I know baby, I think you spoil him”
“You know that we are only joking, we wouldn't dare to put you in that situation bro and maybe we will take you in that offer”. I relax a little
“Yes he is fine, even happy, but that's not normal, it's not a bad thing, but really is just weird. I think that's not my brother” Cas closed his book and started to pay attention to what I was saying, that's what I loved the most about Cas, it didn't matter what I needed to talk about he always listened to me.
Sam homeschools him, he is teaching everything he needs to know to enter college if he ever decides to do that. He has been with us for only six months and he doesn't know that much about our world. The first thing that he taught him was how to spend money, how it worked, and right now he has his own credit card.
“Cas, something is wrong with Sam” Castiel was reading a book about bees in wildlife. He was passionate about those things. He looked up from his book
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
“We are fine Dean, you know we are not little right?” She responds annoyed.
“I don’t know Dad, it just happened, I'm sorry” I hug him harder
“I’m going to start the spanking Jack. I’m not going to lecture you through it, I think you know why you are here. So I’m only asking you this question: Why are you here being punished, Jack?” I start the spanking. His cheeks are a little pink.
I love them so much. When we met Charlie in the “who must not be named case” we really clicked, then she disappeared for a while, and when Jo asked us to help her on a hunt in San Diego, the two of them met, and I can tell you, those girls share a brain. They remind me of my relationship with Cas, both are badass in their own way, and last time I talked with Jo she said that they may get married soon.
I ended the spanking with another cycle of this pattern. I get him to stand up and I take a look at him.  Jack is calmer than before, he tried to get off my lap, but I know he is thinking about what I said. His face is a little red, and he has tears on his face. My heart is breaking, the famous saying, “it hurts me more than you think” is real. I hate to cause him pain, but he needs to understand that I'm not going to tolerate his attitude. I hug him. We both need that hug. “Kid, we are not trying to be unfair, we just want what's best for you, you need to understand that”
I left the kitchen in a hurry, I don't want to answer more questions. Dean knows that I'm hiding something, and you know it's not really that bad.
“We know Dean, Sometimes you need to know everything that happens with the people you care about, but really it is nothing bad”. She tells me and then changes the topic. “So when are you guys coming to visit our new place?, or when are you guys going to let us kidnap Jack?” When they met Jack, they fell in love with him. It's a no brainer really, and Charlie is determined to make him the best gamer out there. They play online all the time, he is becoming obsessed with whatever new game they are playing right now.
Good morning Lee, I hope we can meet today
“Well, first of all, he is smiling more, he seems distracted, he goes away without telling anybody where he is going” I started to list the things that I find strange in Sam's behavior, both stayed silent for a moment and then Jo starts laughing.
“I've been thinking about it Sam, and I think that I’m ready to get into high school, here in Lebanon. I don't see the point to keep doing homeschool if I'm not really allowed to hunt, and even if I was allowed there hasn't been much to hunt, everything seems calm”
“Do it Jack, want me to help you?” I ask him “No I'll do it, dad, it was worth trying.” “It was, but I'm not going to change my mind” He unbuttoned his jeans and I helped him with them. I put him over my knee, and I decide this is a lesson that I don’t want to repeat so I put the boxers down too.
“Well, as I told you before, he is fine. He is going to come to you when he is ready. I don't know what's going with him either so that makes both of us stupid” I smile at that. “What do you want to do before we check on our little miscreant?” He asks, teasing me.
I understand that rule, but the “Finish your chores and schoolwork” I think that's not at the same level. They need to chill.
“I think I will join you Cas. Sam is going to do lunch is his turn after all. I don't want to eat his healthy crap, but you know that's what we agreed on”. He said. I didn't know that today was Sam's turn to do lunch, as I don't eat, I'm not usually into their “shifts”. “And I think that I need to go with you to check up on Jack, so he sees a united front, also so you don't kill him,” He said with a smile.
“We are not trying to force anything on him. You have a point, Dean. He needs to be prepared for anything that can happen. It's not going to be his priority but is one of his responsibilities. If he wants to go to high school he can, but he knows what we expect from him”.
“Well, let's go”
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
At the beginning he had his doubts, after all he has always been with girls. Dean Winchester was known as a womanizer. He didn't settle down with anyone but Casie and Lisa and that didn’t work out with them.
“Don’t roll your eyes at me, Dean, it's rude you know that we are trying to make a better example for Jack” After that he took his seat in front of me
----------------
I'm really happy that you gave this chapter a chance. so what's wrong with Sam? Any guesses? Is Dean right and something is wrong with him? Was Cass too hard?  Is Jack only going through some teenage angst? What do you guys think?
“How was the episode,” I ask Dean
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well dad, don't be like that, it's not that important '' He responds with some attitude and taking off his cellphone, he has a death wish. He only calls Cas Dad, I thought it was really cute. He sometimes calls me dad too, but it was rare, I think that the term only escapes his mouth when he is in trouble with me or when he is having some extreme emotion. I don't mind him calling me by my name.
The first thing that they didn't understand was his job. He was a hunter and they didn't think that it was worth it, of course, he was helping people but for them, it was not worth the risk, but with Cas an angel of the lord he was fine with it. Cas wanted the same things as him, to save people and hunt all evils. Of course, he could just give everything up and have an apple pie life with them but it wasn't fair to everyone else. He was just like that putting others before him. He was just destined to save the world more than once.
“I don't think so baby, he was being rude to both of us” “Yes Cas, but he has a point I can't force him to---”
After a good dozen, he yells
“Good morning Dean, why are you awake?” I stopped myself from rolling my eyes again, I don't want to feel Cas’ hand again. And before I answer him I think about it. When we are hunting free I don't really wake up this early. Jack does sometimes, but that's only when he joins Sam on his run
Cas sometimes tells him how things really happened in history, as we all know, all that is written is not always the truth, Jack loves to hang out with Cas, and learning that stuff. He also taught him how to tie his shoes, or at least he tried to, Jack just can't get his hand on it and has decided to use velcro shoes or we tie them for him. It was funny how Cas tried to teach him, but then Jack just gave up.
“Castiel, you’re no fun, we were going to guess, and you know how much I hate it when people call me Celeste”
“Don't sweat it Sam. You know that I want to know everything, but if you're not ready. I'll respect that, just answer me this, is there something wrong with you?”. I ask and he answers “Not really Dean, just something that is important to me” Maybe I'm really making up a problem where there's none. I trust Sam with my life, sometimes not with his own, but I can tell he is telling the truth.
“Dean I love helping people, but I don't think that hunting is the way I want to live my life. I want normal”
“Jack that's great news, I may not seem excited about it but you just caught me off ward, that doesn't mean that we are going to stop training you-- ”
“Don't look at me like that, there is something bothering Sam” “Dean you're being paranoid, stop trying to intrude in your brother's life, this is your last warning” I rolled my eyes and was surprised when he stood me up and gave me a hard swat on my butt.
Right now there is something with Sam, and Dean is freaking out. I think he is being unreasonable. Sam has the liberty to do as he wants. He is a grown-up man. I think I know what's going on. If my suspicions are correct, he has met someone. So that's why I think Dean is being paranoid for nothing. If I thought that he was doing something dangerous I would be the one putting a stop, but I know there is no need.
“Jack before you go to whatever you are going to go, we are going to postpone training for today”.
“Jack, you can come out of the corner” He turns around and I can see that his attitude is not really that different from before he was in the corner. He seems calmer but not how I want him.
I've been running for like an hour when I came to the decision that it's okay to tell my family about Eileen. She doesn't deserve to be a secret. I'm going to have a talk with her and see what happens. I started a text
Jack stops the hug. Then Cas does something that surprises me. “Here is your phone Jack. I hope you learned your lesson”.
“Thank you Sam for asking but you know I don’t need to do that, but if you want some company I can join you. You know that”
We have had a talk about respect many times, but last time when I came back from the empty, and learned that Dean was disrespectful towards Jack. He didn't sit comfortably for a week. Daily bedtime spankings do wonders for your attitude. We are not going to do that to Jack as this time was just a tantrum, but he can look forward to those if his attitude doesn't change.
“Yes I know, that's why I try to check up on him. Maybe I'm slacking off about it”. Sam says with concern.
I look at Cas, “And you say that I spoil him”
Warnings at the end of the chapter, I don't want to give anything away. Just a reminder that there is a reason for the tags.
I don’t know what's happening with Jack. He seems distracted and has been acting rude. Dean says it's part of being a teenager, but I will not tolerate disrespect or laziness. I'm being fair. When I came back from the empty I decided to reunite with my family and put some ground rules for everyone.
After watching a mini-marathon of Doctor Sexy. We decided to check up on Jack. I’m hoping that he has some work done, it's been hours. When we entered the library he was working on his notebook, so that's something.
“Whatever” at that moment Cas stands up and goes over to Jack and takes his phone. “HEY!, give it back.” He yells at Cas. This is not how I thought this morning was going to be. Cas's eyes change and with ease, he stands Jack up and gives him three rapid swats on his butt. “I’m getting tired of your attitude Jack, take this as a warning, I don't want to hear anything else in that tone of yours. You're getting it back when you catch up with your work, and even then, if I don’t see your attitude improving I'm not going to give it back, take that into consideration. You're on really thin ice, Are we Clear?”
“I hope you’re right Cas” he gave me a kiss on the top of my head and just held me till I fell asleep.
“I don’t have an attitude Dean, you are just being unfair”: He tells me with attitude. “I wanted to have this conversation face to face, but I think you need more help Jack”. I sat down. “Jack please come here and bend over my knee, please” “No”. “No?, you don’t tell me No Jack, and you know that” He decides to back off, looking at me. “Jack, I need you to come here, please, I’m not telling you again”. “You can’t do this Dean. You have no ri--” “Of course I can do it, Jack, I’m your father”. I stand up and take him with me. I bend him over my knee.
I’m in the corner thinking about what just happened. I can't believe they are being like this. Well, I can, but it's not fair. Dean never spanks for attitude, I may have been over the top, but they're not being fair. I want to be normal.
‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’’SMACK’ ‘SMACK’
“Nothing really, I’m going for a run, Wanna come?” Sam responds to Cas' question as he gets up from his chair. He doesn't even finish his cereal.
Cas has a pair of sweats, I didn't realize that he left the kitchen and gave them to Jack. Jack takes them, says a whispered thank you. And goes to Cas.
“I’m SORRRRRY! I’m not doing it againnnnnn” He starts sobbing and it's time to finish up. I’m not going to use the spoon on him. It is breaking my heart, I think he learned his lesson.
“Well, you know that we would love to go to Boston, but we are just getting familiar with our routine. Maybe in a month, or so, but you know that Cas is never going to let you guys kidnap him right?” and if I'm being honest I don't think that I will be okay with that either. “But you know that you're always welcome here, and have your own room too”.
“I can do whatever I want, you may be my dads but I know what I want to do!” He stands up, and I stop him from leaving. Cas is watching us, he stood up too, but I was faster. Many years with Sam gave me lots of experience.
He is sobbing, and I decide to rub his back. Trying to calm him down “It’s over Jack, you learned your lesson I love you” He doesn’t realize that I finished the spanking. It takes a moment before he calms down. I put his underwear on and he hisses. I stand him up and hug him. It is important that he knows that I'm no longer mad at his actions.
“What's going on kid? you don't usually do this. Are you okay?” I ask while hugging my boy. He looks at me
Of course S, you know I'm not like you guys, I always have a plan, and I'm not going to do anything stupid
Jack looks at me surprised I don't usually scold him. I turn him around and bend him over my knee. "I'm tired of it”. I smack his butt once for each word. I think that's enough to calm him but he starts struggling “STOP IT! DEAN, YOU CAN’T DO THI--” So he wants to do this the hard way. I can do that.
Good morning Sam, I'm looking forward to meeting you soon, but I'm on my way to Texas to help some friends hunt a vampire nest. I think it's going to take me 4 days to get back but it may be longer.
I started to clean the kitchen and think about what I was going to do about this situation.
I came to the library where all my school-related things are. I’m annoyed with my parents because I don't understand why it is a big deal. I was going to do my school work, but I lost track of time.  I just got distracted playing Zelda Breath of the Wild, and it was pretty addictive.  I've never played a game that got me like that. I did some research on the saga, and the only thing that I know now is that I want it all.
“It's not your fault Sammy, he is a teenager and has other priorities”
“He is not here Cas” I answered. And at that moment I heard Jack pouring himself a glass of milk and some eggs and bacon. I blushed hard.
We enter the kitchen holding hands. Sam is preparing lunch. He is making some grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and salad. He does this salad with some lettuce and spinach. That's like the base of his famous Sam Salad. He also added strawberries and nuts. I love when he adds fruit to his salads. He also adds a vinaigrette that no one but him knows how to do. That's what makes it special
“Dean, I've been meaning to tell you something, I know you’re worried about me, but I can't do it right now. I'm just telling you this because I don't want you to worry. Give me a week and I will tell you what's going on”. I know he knows that I know that something has been going on and it's worrying me. I hope he is right and there's nothing to worry about.
“Love you too Dean”
I decide to take out a wooden spoon from the counter. I’m not really sure If I’m going to use it, but just in case.
Jack knows the consequences for being rude and we have made it very clear that no one is above those rules here. Yes, we swear a little, we don't mind when he does, but when someone is being rude or disrespectful that's a no-no in our lifestyle. And don't let me get started with what happens when he rolls his eyes at Cas, I sometimes am a big softie with him and there are times that I let it go when I think he is not doing it on purpose, but Cas is another thing. Sometimes Cas says that I spoil him a lot, that's not it, is just that I don't find it that rude.
Cas, of course, understood his relationship with his brother and sometimes he even helped him to help his brother out and there were times that he got in trouble with him for his actions. He has always been that way giving everything for his kid brother that now was a grown man, and his brother would do the same thing for him. When he got in trouble with Cas because of it, he found it worth it, even if his backside didn't agree with him, because, let me tell you Cas was strict as fuck with some things.
The stars are on a full field of velvet blackness and the moon drifts up into the sky to join them, and Dean and Cas huddle together under feathers made of light, glowing serenely. The cold bite of the winter air eventually becomes too much, and Castiel stands, reaching for Dean’s hand to help him up. When Dean is upright Cas tangles their fingers together, and they head back into the bunker hand-in-hand.
Whoops? ^.^; Anyway I hope it still counts.
“And then you asked me to stay, and I — not a shred of me wanted to say ‘no.’ The Heaven Jack has built is magnificent, but it’s not my home.”
. I can’t find Cas.”
“You were dead, Dean. I watched you kill yourself.”
“Actually,” Cas hedges as Dean stands staring, still unable to start the conversation, “I need to tell you something.”
Castiel tips his head back and stares upside-down at Jack, seeming to fill the doorway but looking the same as ever, small frown creasing his brows.
a man,
than he once was. His encounter with Michael’s grace had left the sour taste of old blood and malice in Dean’s mouth. His grace had chafed, been used to bind and torment, to cause harm. It had burned cold against the core of him, frightening Dean beyond anything he’d ever experienced or imagined, anything he’d ever admit to out loud.
Cas pins Dean with the intensity of his stare, grace making his eyes shine in the dimmed lights. Dean opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. His voice sticks in his throat and he tries to swallow it back down, watching as Castiel tracks the motion, his whole body suddenly alight in a way it hasn’t been for years.
“Uh,” he says, scrubbing a hand over the back of his neck and glancing away, “I might have. Dropped them? In your laundry basket?”
Looking thoughtful, Castiel tilts his head and amends: “Well, we
for a smack.
And perhaps it was that spark, that fluttering ember, which prompted Castiel to stand still and let Dean finally catch up to him. That spark, which took all of Castiel’s noble intentions and grand ideas about protecting Dean and ground them to ash.
