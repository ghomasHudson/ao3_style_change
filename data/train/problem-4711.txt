She shrugged. “I like watching beautiful things. And frat house, told you. Now, hurry up before he falls asleep and I die of old age.”
“It’s perfect,” he said quietly, “thank you so much.” He placed it next to Steve and slowly lifted his arms to envelop Steve in a hug. On his part, Steve was still, letting Tony do his thing at his own pace. Once he was sure the man settled, he hugged him back; they stayed like that for a few moments.
Natasha opened the window slightly. “We could… throw our phones, stay here, overthrow  the government, jail all the corrupt politicians. They already like us, Steve wouldn’t let us get too mental, the tv shows aren’t
Tony shrugged. “There’s a Norse god, The Hulk, and two enhanced kids who can kick as - butt! I said butt, Steve!” Tony yelped at the kick in the shin.
Nat picked up a voodoo doll of sorts and the woman hissed in her general direction. “Down,” she ordered quickly. Then she followed up with some Russian, and Nat chuckled before replying. She patted Steve’s shoulder and went to sit in the entrance, where Steve was sure she could still hear everything.
Tony huffed. “Fine, but if you think there are any decorations in this tower, you’re delusional. How are you gonna solve that, huh?” he asked with a smirk.
“You’re beautiful,” Tony said simply. Then he further lowered himself on Steve’s hips and thighs, snaking up in a sinful manner that meant Steve could almost feel the pressure on his dick.
Steve’s mind was reeling with images of sharing Tony with Bucky. Aesthetically, he’d appreciated Bucky’s body since he first felt the tingles of attraction, back when he was young. He’d never acted on those thoughts, but he’d lie if he claimed he’d never entertained them. Sharing Tony was inherently hot, largely because it involved the man currently half-draped over his chest, but also because it would be with Bucky. He didn’t want to share Tony with anyone, though. He wanted the man for himself, naked and panting, moaning as Steve touched him
“Today, Cap! We’re not getting any younger! Well, you’re not getting any older either, but I don’t know, just tell me what to put on Ben!”
The first thing he noticed was that things weren’t familiar. The setting of the room wasn’t familiar, and neither were the sheets he could feel under his back. It was perhaps odd to have such a strong sense of familiarity towards bedding, but Steve was adamant those weren’t his sheets. They were smoother and upon a second look, a baby blue he wasn’t accustomed to.
There were voices rising up again and he moved his hands to signal them to settle. “These are my views. While I trust my teammates with my life, I cannot expect them to back my views up completely. But I am distraught and saddened by the state of affairs we were met with. I am distraught by this spectacle, by bringing a new tv in our accommodation to make us believe things are better. This
On his part, Steve did his best to carve it as neatly as possible. It wasn’t like he had a lot of experience, or any really. Steve didn’t know a lot about a great deal of things. So he stood and tried to remember any circumstance in his life where carving a turkey had been a thing. If he’d known this was going to happen, he would have allocated three minutes to a youtube tutorial, risking the merciless teasing from Tony. In all fairness the scientist had been good with mocking Steve about his searches, but there was a knowing look. Maybe Steve was also paranoid on top of everything else he was discovering about himself.
“No! Please, in my mouth.” He kissed Tony. “You said if I’m good I can get a better reward, right?” He bottomed out, stayed still with Tony’s cock pressing snugly against his prostate. “Please come on my tongue,” he begged, licking at Tony’s lips.
The prime-minister started talking then, and they dimmed the lights to focus on him while servers brought out appetisers which made absolutely no sense because they seemed to be struggling in the half-darkness. The speech was passionate enough to captivate and full of crap enough to make Steve’s upper lip tremble. On his left, Tony seemed engrossed – he could have been asleep, it was a talent. Natasha kept her smile on as she picked at some cold cuts and Steve wished he could go for a run shirtless. In the rain. While the Bee Gees wailed in his earbuds.
Steve laughed, trying to hide the nervousness. A master spy and a nosy curious pain in the ass. Great. “That’s one way of putting it,” he said and settled for a mysterious smile in terms of facial muscles. His jaw ached from the strain of controlling his expressions. Not as much as dream Tony’s must have hurt though. Beautiful, glorious mild pain that was caused by the strong desire to please Steve. Not only was his dick officially stirred, so was the longing in his heart. Excellent. This was going to be a wonderful trip.
Nonetheless, he dives down feet first, kicking the bot’s head with his soles. “Aww, I’m hurt,” he tries for a joke, but he worries Steve can tell anyway.
“Tony said butt!” one of the kids yelled and Steve loved the blush spreading on the scientist’s cheeks more than anything in the world.
“What the fuck are you doing?” he asked, pushing himself away from the desk. But Tony moved with him, his mouth seemingly glued to his cock. He mumbled something that only made everything worse, as he slid further down, and vibrated a little as well. Steve grabbed his hair and pulled him off, standing up in the process.
To say the living room was in chaos was the understatement of the year. Despite their normally good cooperation skills, his teammates were completely lost when it came to uprighting a tree. Natasha was standing on the coffee table, her thumb up in front of her. She was barking orders to Thor and Bucky who were doing their best to place it exactly where she wanted.
“This is so good, Tony. Gimme.” He pointed to the other party hat. It was spray-painted crudely, obviously in a rush. Steve loved it.
Steve’s demons were mostly appeased, he realised. They were trying to fight back against the feeling of being protected; ugly words, nasty thoughts that told him he was going to be mocked by everyone for being this pathetic. They reminded of him all the articles and comments he’d read, and called him names. Told him he was a burden, a weakling,
Steve could smell the alcohol on his breath, he was that close. It was a poignant smell, almost of medicine, mixed with something sweet, perhaps raspberry? “Yeah, they thought that might be too obvious and you’d catch on. Your father came up to me -”
Warm water was amazing; Steve wanted to hide in the shower forever. For multiple reasons, including, but not limited to the water not being frozen (always a great one), the water soothing his muscles, the water helping him get clean, the water helping him buy time before he would have to face people again.
“Yes!” Pietro said and turned to Wanda. The girl gently lifted him up to the top of the tree. He slid the upright branch into the ornament and clapped loudly. The A was truly ugly. Steve loved it more than anything. Wanda lowered Pietro to be at their level.
Natasha snorted and turned to look at the large bird on the table. “Do you take after her side of the family?”
The other journalists there sneered at Jones when he joined them. He tried to start an argument with them, but they were not having it.
“I am fantastic,” Steve said slowly, ridiculously emphasising each word. He was quiet, not wanting for everyone to hear him sarcastically lashing out. “Any more fantastic, and they’ll recruit me as a fifth member. Maybe Johnny’s single this time of the week.”
Tony’s laugh had transcended regular amusement and had turned into ugly guwaffing, which Steve found annoyingly endearing. But he would, the big idiot, because why would he not have a crush on the world’s most
“Tony!” Nat called through her sobs of laughter. Steve was in an identical predicament, holding on to his sides at the man’s rant.
Steve did at once, shifting lower in the seat once more. Tony resumed the kisses, moving on the inside of his thighs, on the curve of his butt cheeks. Steve sighed contentedly. Then Tony pulled him closer, parted his cheeks further, and he was lapping at Steve’s hole. Every now and then he would press his tongue inside before licking the rim. It was sloppy and wet and it felt so good, Steve thought nothing of his shameless moaning.
Steve was panting, shamelessly thrusting his hips in the search for friction. The towel was tantalising, a fleeting touch on his needy dick. “I like any thought that involves you touching me.”
“She says she’d like to tell you about your future,” Nat informed him. “She’s been travelling with her family all her life.”More Russian. “She says she can see something about your love life. It’s unfulfilled and you’re still waiting for someone.” The woman explained something further. “Someone with dark hair and –”
“So, Stevie. Should I get Stark to dance with me as well? It seems to be working tonight,” he said and Steve could
“Oh, god,” Steve moaned deeply, forcing his hips to stay still. “Medical reasons, most likely. Why does it even matter?” he asked, unable to shake the embarrassment.
He felt the cold as his trousers disappeared. It wasn’t his favourite feeling in the world, the cold, but it was soon abated when a hand came to rest on his knee. It moved up on his thigh, scratching lightly. It stopped at his left hip, rubbing at the bone.
“But I fabricated it. In my hyperactive brain that would not let me be.” He regretted the way his tone had taken a sort of finality note.
“You guys are adorable,” Nat coos right before cursing repeatedly in angry Russian. “These things just keep coming,” she adds.
Steve had no idea what the two of them were, but he knew it was definitely good when the young woman in front of him leaned over to kiss Bruce’s cheek and half-whisper, “Yeah, he knows I’ll
“Why do you insist on annoying me so much?” He ignored what sounded like “pigtails” from the other room.
“I’d actually forced myself to come find you even if the idea of facing you made me dizzy after last night, because I’ve made
He thinks perhaps he’s finally losing it when the edges of his vision become reddened, and he’s floating now so maybe he’s only dreaming – a terrible nightmare, cause now he’s out of his suit, unable to – but then chunks of the building start moving out of the way, parting like the Red Sea and Tony remembers religion vaguely, on withered fingertips touching his forehead, his chest, then his shoulders. The softness of the prayer made him mellow and he doubted, as he always did, but he cherished.
“There you go, darling. Oh, look at you, look how good you’re being, opening up for me.” He finally brought the third finger back, stretching Steve again. “I can’t wait to be inside you. I can’t wait to watch you come as I’m fucking you,” he whispered, more to himself.
Tony’s mind is reeling, torn between coming up with a plan and images of Steve’s long blond hair sprawled on his pillow as he rode him. He wasn’t even aware the idea of long-haired Steve would be a turn on. “I promised the exact same thing like an hour ago, do you even listen to me?”
Steve sighed. “Alright, alright, I’m going! But you need to promise not to be so quick to answer the door.” He got up and hugged her. “And you need to come visit me at the tower and meet everyone.”
“From someone who has absolutely no idea what they’re doing to someone who’s conflicted as all hell: just spend some time with her. She’s probably the second kindest person I’ve ever met.” Bruce was too polite to push. “After you, I mean. Bruce, she’d be good for you.”
Endless thanks to Joeybelle, who this entire series is dedicated to (even if I can't remember why I started writing it and Stony isn't exactly her otp.) I'm still alive because you loved me and continue to do so; thank you for putting up with me and pushing me to write. iubmultben
Tony paused. For a second he seemed to want to keep going, but then he answered the question. “Some shithole of a website funded by a subsidiary of Hammer’s. They run aggressive propaganda against me and by extension against all of you. Pepper’s been siking our lawyers on them for years now. Steve—“
Outside, the snow had some fairy tale qualities to it, falling down peacefully with large snowflakes that were sure to stick to everything. Steve wasn’t fond of the snow or the ice, or even the cold really, but it bathed the room (and subsequently Tony) in some dreamy-fairy-crap light and Steve found that he could start liking it.
Steve dives shield first into the bot, making it stagger. He proceeds to bash it repeatedly, ignoring the obvious difference in size . “I don’t know what that means,” he says as he uses the edge of the shield to peel off the plating on the bot’s back.
The man stopped. “Yeah, sorry. I’ll be good, I did say we don’t have to do anything more than kiss.” He moved back up to mouth at Steve’s jaw. “I want you to be comfortable with me, darling.” It was the first time he’d called him that since the change their dynamic occurred. Steve moaned loudly, arms tightening around him. “Oh.”
Steve stalled, because this woman could read him like an open book. Pretty much everyone could, if he was honest. But Marjorie was particularly adept at that. So he sipped his tea and hummed noncommittally. “Yeah, nothing, just a quiet sort of gathering. But it’s really not that big of a deal or anything,” he said and he was perfectly aware he was babbling.
“Yeah, no,” he said and took a drink from the water bottle they provided. His phone was going mental. “Let’s be real here for a second, shall we?” The prime-minister had gone comically red, side-lit as he was. Steve imagined steam coming out of his ears. He was happy to say that with the distinct exception of Tony Stark, he imagined no one else naked. “I was handed this speech this very day by the very prime-minister sitting right here. And the thing is, if this was in any way, shape, or form a correct depiction of why we are here and what has been done so far, I would not have the smallest of problems in reading it. As it happens, I’m always honest. It’s a character flaw, I’m told. They also called me ‘The Star Spangled Man with a Plan’ so I wouldn’t take what they say to heart. Especially since this was horrendously unplanned.”
Never had he taken so much from someone. Steve pulled back before he could come. The journey back out was just as wonderfully torturous. He gave Tony as much time as he needed to come back from the stretch of accommodating his dick.
The man left them then, back to his table of predominantly men. Steve took note of their ties again, the way their chins sprawled over the lazy knots. Still dazed by his wordless exchange with Tony, he made sure his tie sat right. If he fiddled with it as he skimmed the speech, well then it would just have to be seen as a sign of nervousness and he would be chastised by Natasha and potentially Maria Hill later. It was not common knowledge that Hill whipped them all over the place about their mannerisms, but Steve was willing to risk it. The more he read the more he needed some sort of outlet.
They were lured over to one of the shooting stalls. The master, a tall man with a velvet top hat and an impressive moustache. He must have said something funny, because Natasha chuckled again. She explained that he wanted them to grace his stall with their shooting skills and promised it wasn’t even rigged. It was a celebration, he had said, so they were welcome to shoot and pick their prizes should they win.
He touched his shin reverently, then gripped his ankle, pulling it towards his mouth. He placed a kiss on the prominent bone there, then on the tendon connecting his foot and his leg. “I was thinking about you in the shower.”
“Yours,” Steve gasped. His oversensitive cock was trapped between their torsos, the friction almost unbearable. He was full, nothing else existed other than the way Tony’s cock felt buried as deep as it could go. He cupped Tony’s jaw, fingers spread down on his neck. “Look at me,” Steve told him. “Tell me.”
In saying that, I am aware this is overflowing with dialogue, I am aware they are moving too fast, I am aware of Steve's character inconsistencies. These are valid points. Also, fuck 'em. I have explanations for every single one of these issues. And these may not have been on my mind when I wrote them, that is to say they weren't on purpose, but I am using them to my advantage and I am fully excusing them.
“Tony did you forget to tell them?” Pepper’s voice taking a slight shrill quality. “Tony, I sent you thirteen god damned emails and got Friday to sing to you. What did you do, sleep through all of it?” Tony stayed quiet, looking anywhere but ahead of him, where Pepper’s hand shot up to rest on her hip. “You’re an idiot,” she announced and kicked his shin under the table.
“No! It’s great, I don’t wanna stretch it and ruin it,” he said, kind of regretting the size of his frame.
“Whoa, you’d also think you’d be more relaxed,” Bucky counters, the sound of shooting almost drowning him. “And my birthday’s not for another eight months!”
He realised halfway through that he was sketching an office. The office from his dream, to be precise. He froze, looked around. The other two were engrossed in their respective activities, and Steve tried to be rational about it. There was no way any of them could have known about his dream. The office was non-descript as far as he could tell, and even as he remembered it in vivid detail, the entire sequence of events was too surreal and fragmented. Not for the first time he found himself thanking Jesus, Joseph, and Mary that none of his immediate friends - family - was able to read minds. Then he promptly felt guilty about the level of blasphemy reached with that exclamation. Then his guilt escalated as soon as he glanced down at is drawing and he imagined the detailed way in which he would draw Tony’s arched back, his fingers pressing into a roughly sketched Steve Rogers. A man shape, really, because all Steve wanted was to capture the glistening of Tony’s lips, wet around his dick, the glint in his eyes showing he knew exactly what he was doing.
“I’ll try get some sleep, see you in the morning for the rest of this shitshow,” he announced and dragged his luggage into an equally ornate bedroom, complete with four poster bed adorned with cupids and paintings of snowy peaks.
Tony knew, as he always seemed to do. His finger joined his tongue, pressing lightly. Steve whined when he took it away. “Shh, be patient, darling.” Steve could hear the pump of the lube bottle and his pulse spiked. Tony’s finger returned, now covered in extra moisture. He pressed it in slowly, taking one of Steve’s testicles in his mouth again. Then he pushed the finger steadily, making Steve cry out when it was finally all the way in.
“I only tried the first couple of them, wanted to –” He pumped some lube out, pushed it in his needy hole with his finger. The sound was obscene, arousing. The same finger in, out, just a couple of times to warm the lube up, and he made quick work of the first two beads. He clenched his hole on the small thin section, testing how it felt. Not nearly enough, but a start. “More,” he said mostly to himself.
“No! No, don’t worry. I wanna see the magic,” Steve added, trying to fix coming across as too keen. Because he was. The only thing that could be more comforting than wearing Tony’s top, especially after he’d worn it for a bit and it smelled like him - and Steve could swear he was not a creep, he really wasn’t, the man just made his heart’s knees weak - would be draping the man himself over his chest and hold him for a while. And even that had the potential to be not-comforting, given how much tension Steve would be feeling and how much it would affect him. He finally put it on, and sighed in relief, part of his anxiety settling down finally.
Tony jumped up and pulled the cover off Steve completely. “I can’t promise anything, but you won’t know until you try!”
“Christmas was another one,” he panted. “I wanted to give us family time and I wanted to give you a perfect present – ah! Tony,” he whined impatiently.
Tony’s familiar with almost dying. Even before he became Iron Man, he has always been in some sort of danger, whether it was self-inflicted or a consequence of his heritage. And every time he was close to his life finally ending, he experienced flashes of good memories, of bad memories, of random facts that he never got to share with anyone.
“Stark,” came the one-word warning from Natasha, and Tony dropped the attitude. He lifted his hands in surrender.
An official seemed to make a move to escort him off stage but Steve was too deep. So he glared at him and went on. “The Maria Stark Foundation had partnered up with the government and supposedly non-politically backed NGOs to ensure the reduction in domestic violence, as well as to ensure safe spaces for victims. Levels of illiteracy. Percentage of teenage mothers. I was brought up Catholic but I will always stand by the separation of church and state. This grand meal we were offered – statistically how many children go to bed hungry? This is not about back home being better, this is about right here right now being bad. The entire world stood by you and supported a smooth transition from the old regime to a new, humane one. You have been shepherded as gently as possible to avoid a vacuum power and help rebuild. You have done none of the things you promised. This ends now.”
Steve was confused and was about to ask what he was on about when drumrolls flooded the large common room. Clint’s voice could be heard over the noise, belting out Happy Birthday horribly off-key. It was Natasha’s turn to groan. Steve felt almost vindicated.
“It’s new alright,” Tony agreed and peeled the protective film covering the screen in one swift motion.
It was one of those split second things when he saw the red and gold wrapping paper. He had actually shut his door when the thought sunk in, and walked back in to investigate. The second he realised what he was looking at he could have punched himself in the face. The present for Tony, the one he spent ages on was sitting on his desk patiently. Steve was an idiot.
Steve didn’t trust his voice, so he nodded, lowering his head slightly to reach Tony just right. He doubted he would ever get over how everything seemed to right itself and shift into place when they kissed. He hoped there would be many many kisses to test his theory.
“I can’t possibly remember whose birthday is right after mine,” Tony said dismissively — and Steve knew that was bullshit, Tony liked to know
“Shit,” Steve whispers, and he signals Tony to take off by moving his fingers up on the forearm of the suit and holding on tight.
The third time Steve was left speechless by how attractive Tony was, there were lips pressed tightly against his. He thought in hindsight that was as much reason for his lack of verbal response as seeing his stupid crush smile over a room full of people.
Two of Tony’s fingers did not make for an impressive girth, not when Steve was used to the man’s cock. But their weight was better than nothing and he began sucking on them enthusiastically. He let his head fall back, felt the fingers slide further toward his throat, the slight burn as they touched the back of his tongue.
Tony moved his hand to the side to kiss the inside of Steve’s palm. Then he pulled two of his fingers inside his mouth, sucking them lazily. He turned his head to indulge in Steve’s other hand, nuzzling it, then repeating the kissing and licking pattern all the way back to Steve’s hard nipple.
“Please don’t,” Steve said with a smile. “I don’t think the serum was meant to protect me from such things.”
“Not until much later, no,” Clint replied. “Deepthroat competition!” he said and Steve wasn’t even sure who groaned the loudest.
“Oh, thank god!” the man exclaimed. “Steve? Are you okay? What am I saying, of course you’re not okay, otherwise why would you be standing frozen in the middle of my lab? Idiot, Tony! Are you with me?”
The tower was burning down. All over the place fire had broken out. He knocked on doors, trying his best to wake everyone up, shouting their names and telling them to evacuate. He hadn’t been able to find his shield so he left without it, with nothing to protect him from the licking flames. He could feel the heat on his arms, then enveloping him. He ran all the way to Tony’s lab, barefoot on the unbearably hot floors. Once there, he screeched at what he found.
“Damn, was so looking forward to passing laws that say if you’re annoying you have to be silent for three days before you’re allowed to speak again,” he said, pointedly looking at Tony.
“Listen, it’s an important movie that has a good cast and most importantly, Tommy Lee is badass in it,” Pepper defended it.
Getting presents was always an uncomfortable experience for Steve. After his mother died, Bucky was the only one who got him anything, and even that was cut short when he left. So Steve was awkward and a bit uncertain what to do with his hands. He tried to be as normal as possible when he unwrapped them, and he was grateful at everyone’s enthusiasm for not noticing the slight shaking of his fingers. He was amazed at how much thought they’d all put into what they got him. Steve received a new sketchbook, all the Star Wars movies, new pencils and -
He managed a few hours of sleep before dragging himself out of bed. He was just getting dressed for the day when Darcy burst into his room, Bruce in tow. She wasn’t at the meeting he called the day before, and he figured Bruce brought her up to speed.
He suspected he’d passed out. It couldn’t have been long, he gathered. When he opened his eyes and looked up, Tony was watching him affectionately. “Hi,” he said shyly.
Clint was moving around still tender from his wounds. Judging by the sluggishness of his movements, the pain medication he was on was working beautifully. He opened and closed the freezer several times, increasingly more agitated. He went as far as to check the cupboards and the oven.
The music had changed by now, and everyone swapped impressions about their competition while swaying to it. Or at least he thought they were, he didn’t care all that much. Tony was showing Natasha his throat, explaining something about it and Steve’s mind brought back the image of the bulge, and what it treacherously decided to paint as heat in Tony’s eyes. Steve really wanted to get drunk. And yes, it wasn’t his party, but he could cry if he wanted to.
“I have no idea. This woman kissed me, and then I saw… and then I couldn’t breathe, and then it felt like before, and I don’t have a clue,” he said shakingly.
argued that he was Captain America even when he was a scrawny little shit), things were anything but calm. When he danced on stages that trembled under his weight, he was anything but calm. When he was fighting Nazis there was nothing calm, especially not the people around him. When he came back, when they went into battle, nothing shouted calm. Even in the domestic setting of their weird superfamily, calm was a very apparent and relative thing. Someone always had something going on, and they relied on each other too heavily not to empathize.
Steve wanted to punch himself. “It’s just - I think I may have - I think I caused it this time,” he finished lamely.
People were polite; they waved and cheered, but gave them their space to roam freely. Tony was calm and collected, as Tony usually appeared to be regardless of what was happening. Steve was convinced it was coping mechanism after coping mechanism, and he wished he could emulate it. Because his mind was
Steve sighed. He was being silly, he knew that, but the scenarios in which Tony laughed in his face were flooding his mind. He also knew it was unfair to Tony, the man would never do that. “Remember when we got together?”
“What? No, no, this one I actually know. Bruce showed it to me on youtube.” Tony didn’t look convinced. “Really? I’m like… the epitome of honesty!”
“Like what you see?” Tony chuckled, repeating the words he’s said earlier. That morning felt like years before.
Steve hovered over him, nuzzling his chest and pushing the pillow aside with his head. When he finally reached the man’s face, he kissed his cheek sweetly. “And?”
The flight back was uneventful. Natasha took phone calls and emailed Maria Hill and Pepper back and forth. He didn’t mean to pry, but he got up to stretch and accidentally read bits of what it said. There were not-so-nice words from three of the fiercest women he had ever known and he felt guilty – guilt was not an unknown feeling for Steve. He’d felt it every single time someone got hurt, involved in the same battles as him or not. If civilians across the globe got injured, he’d feel guilty. Rationally, he was aware of his inability to protect everyone, but he resented it more than anything. So when he noticed others having to deal with the consequences of his actions, his heart sunk. He would rather get beaten up for days than inconvenience anyone.
“No dirty talk in battle,” Steve tells him and even as voices join the channel, for two seconds Tony can only hear him.
“Fine! I’ll get the tree and do the decoration shopping,” he said, starting to get short with everyone. It was definitely not going according to plan. “In fact, why don’t we scrape the entire thing, and I organise Christmas on my own? You just have to turn up. Or not, whatever you want.” He gathered his markers and the whiteboard, heading for the door.
“Yeah, nothing like imagining sex acts in front of officials we’re meeting in a country that’s still kind of unstable,” Steve quipped.
Moderately appeased, Steve allowed Tony to have an open-mouthed kiss, which he knew was not nearly enough. “I think you can do better than that. Why don’t you tell me what you need?” He closed his lips over the head, pulling backwards to give Tony a show.
Steve turned his upper body to receive the eager man currently licking into his mouth. He held him as they kissed, then ducked slightly under him to kiss his jaw and his neck.
Steve moved lower on the chair, opening his legs as far as they could go. Then he did as Tony said and – “Oh! Yes, fuck!” The sixth bead pushed the others around enough that one of them, Steve really didn’t care which or how, brushed his prostate. He keened loudly, gripping the remaining two beads and the hoop at the end hard and twisting them.
Movie evening - the lighter version of movie night - happened to be the day before his birthday. They had a full house for it. Steve had given in and accepted that they now owned a popcorn maker, the large one they usually had at the cinema. Vision had spent the afternoon personalising it with various Avengers stickers, then proceeded to use it to make enormous amounts of popcorn for them all.
He knows laughing is the wrong thing to do, he also knows that Steve is probably joking despite his impatient tone. He can’t help the guwaffs. “What would you have me call him? Mister Storm? He’s what, 20?”
He washed his dick in the sink, like the savage he was, and put on clean underwear and comfortable tracksuit bottoms. He walked out of his room with a heavy heart and a very loud mind, and even more annoying, more sexually frustrated than he’d been in a long time. Excellent. Christmas couldn’t come and go quick fast enough.
Tony was giddy. It was written all over his face, as well as in his toe wiggling. “You’re perfect. Beautiful, perfect,” he repeated. “Please, I wanna see.”
“God, please! I thought you’d never ask,” Tony breathed out, pulling Steve towards their bedroom. It was so easy, such a casual thing to sit and watch Tony pull his shirt off and rummage for a tee instead.
“I feel like at this point there isn’t any point in even sighing, that’s how far gone you are,” he said and put on a show of struggling to get out of bed. “My age has finally caught up with me, I suppose.”
“Giving me a reason to scowl at you in silence for at least like seven minutes before giving in and kissing you! Shield up!” he instructs. As soon as Steve complies, Tony shoots at it, enjoying the efficiency of the reflected beam as it takes down several bots at once.
“No, it’s just cause you seemed to struggle with the shirt and I didn’t - of course you know how to use cufflinks, I’m sorry -”
Steve was reticent, but the old woman’s eyes were insistent despite the clear lack of focus. It did seem as if she could see through him, inside of him. Her face was wrinkled, a darker hue accentuated by the tan she seemed to be sporting. Steve was compelled to cooperate. He wasn’t certain why, but he felt like some insight into his future, as ridiculous as it might have been was going to help settle the heavy feeling in his stomach. “Yes,” he eventually said and put his hand forward.
“Thank you, I try,” she said and got up for a small curtsey. It looked ridiculous and Steve loved it.
He tried really hard to shut up, but he couldn’t help himself. “You don’t know that,” he said quietly, hugging the goat closer to his chest.
If Steve was a tiny bit honest - and he was! - her headmistress voice was fairly hot. Objectively, like how he always admitted she was a stunning woman with an even better penchant for caring about his sorry ass. “Uh, no?” he answered.
“You just want your name to become a verb. So you can hear people say they would have to ‘Stark’ something.”
There was a chance Clint smashed his phone because every attempt to call him ended up going to voicemail. There was also the loud noise right before the line went dead. Tony had his tablet out in no time.
Tony sweeps down, opening a panel on his suit to retrieve a new comm. “Fairy squadmother!” he proclaims in a sing-song voice.
“Like I’m about to punch at least two people in the face at the same time. Dr. Pavlova,” she proceeded to talk to the doctor in rapid Russian, smiling at her when she got passionate in what she was saying.
So Steve did. It couldn’t have been that long since he’d last pressed his lips to Tony’s, but in hindsight, it felt like an eternity. Once he’d been given this, once his heart settled in his chest as he finally got to touch and hold the man he was in love with, it was incomprehensible that he would ever have to give it up. He pushed the intrusive thought away.
In true leader fashion, he called for a meeting with the available Avengers the evening after Bruce’s birthday. It was leaving things a bit late, he knew, but at the same time he didn’t want to hijack the scientist’s special day. They all gathered round the kitchen island in various stages of hangover – and really, what would the people say if they knew just how many days of the year the Avengers spent suffering from drinking too much? Steve brought out the whiteboard and coloured markers. He’d drawn the chart earlier that day, when everyone was off hiding from the daylight.
His shoulders almost hurt with the tension, and his lower back tingled mercilessly with the unwanted arousal. Yet another cruel aspect of his life, because everyone dying while he was frozen wasn’t enough. Then he thought of Tony rolling his eyes while Steve’s large hand covered his neck, and that was that. With a heavy sigh, thinking it was a bad idea, and it would create a very annoying and persistent precedent, he shoved his hand in his boxers as quickly as he could. He didn’t need to make a spectacle of touching himself, it wasn’t his finest moment, and he didn’t want a visual reminder of it. It was over mercifully quick, and the feeling of shame wasn’t the one he remembered from his teen years, the one drilled in his mind by the church. It was a different kind of shame - Steve felt weak and powerless, and as he spent more time in this fucking mess of a situation (and that did not include the come all over his hand), he felt more like pre-serum and less like Captain America, righteous hero to the defenseless. Steve was a joke, a sham.
“Exactly.” Despite knowing there was no reason for it, Steve was distinctly self-conscious about Tony eyeing him as he looked for a top. He settled on one of the ones Sam gifted him for Christmas, and proceeded to roll his eyes yet again. By the time the trip would be over, he’d surely go blind.
“No, you bumbling buffoon. Everyone was cleared by me, including your sorry ass. Now move,” she said one more and Steve saw her hand clench on his shoulder.
“Don’t underestimate how hard it is for me,” Steve said slyly. Tony kissed him, hard and messy. “This is only making it harder, not gonna lie.”
“Look kids, it’s Captain America! In his glorious tracksuit bottoms and mercifully tight t-shirt, and sans shield but with a present inste - Steve that won’t help in battle,” he said, tickling the two kids on his lap slightly.
Steve snorted. “Goatzilla… genius. I need to shower and pack my shit. You,” he pointed to Natasha, “stop antagonising him, he’s been through some sort of trauma –”
The Winter Soldier catches it in his non-metal arm, something that Tony finds seriously impressive. “Storm doesn’t have your cool metal frisbee, Steve, don’t you worry!”
“Oh.” He moved forward to kiss Steve’s chin sweetly. “Oh, yeah.” He seemed to have achieved the same sort of determination he got when he was working on a project, or when he was trying to come up with a solution to an issue.
“All of it, I don’t know. To you being there for me, I’ll let you,” he whispered. The storm inside his chest was fading, but the aftermath meant that he felt exhausted. Perhaps Tony would let him sleep there for a while. Just this time, so he could get a bit of rest.
“They’re sufficiently entertained,” Tony said in a clipped voice. “Lights and drinks, they’re alright.”
“I’ve been subjected to really bad influences recently. Authority-defying, bratty and whiny people,” he explained.
Steve huffed, trying not to get closer to him. He was leaning on the kitchen island, safe from giving in to his now constant wish of touching the man in any way he could. “I thought you gave me the Star Wars boxset?”
He was unaware of the tight fist he had formed on the table or the fact it was trembling. It wasn’t until something tapped at it repeatedly that he snapped back to look at what was happening. Natasha was scrolling furiously on her phone, her face betraying nothing.
“Till the end of the line, pal” Bucky replied, and for a moment, the world didn’t seem all that bleak.
Steve had seen that same conviction when Tony was in battle or when he was arguing the board of directors down. It was heartwarming, the way he’d become the sole focus of Tony’s attention. It was a change from the usual all-over-the-place attitude with eight different lines of thought and a fidget and potentially fire. And as Tony licked the drops of water from the underside of his jaw, he was so very grateful to be important.
It was just short of embarrassing, but nothing he couldn’t rationalise later when he had the time and inclination. He sat on the armchair, box forgotten for now. Tony’s eyes followed him keenly, far more attentively than Steve had expected, although why it would come as a surprise, he didn’t know. Tony would always do this, focus solely on him, often at the expense of others. One of his hands went back to cupping himself, slowly inching the fabric down until the head of his cock peeked from under the band. He couldn’t help his moan when his thumb circled the head and rubbed gently at the moist slit.
“And I was fucking your throat! Hard!” His hips bucked up, but he couldn’t even find the strength to apologise. He was so hard and his mind was so set on coming again, on Tony making him come again. The heat was gone and he thought he might actually cry.
Steve turned to see the man wearing a fluffy bathrobe held together by a loose sash. His mouth watered as he watched him towel dry his hair. When Tony called his name, he had no idea what he’d been told. “What?”
“What about your suit?” There’s underlying coldness in Steve’s voice, something Tony definitely shouldn’t find as hot as he does. Steve’s negative emotions don’t turn him on, he muses. It’s not that, it’s the layers of care that Tony knows inform the reaction.
The first part of the ride was fine. They went over their schedule, discussed the politics in the Eastern European country they were going to over coffee, and caught up on the others’ missions over breakfast. They left Bruce a message to check on Clint when he woke up, and asked Wanda to update them on her mission in Argentina.
“Funny,” he said cuttingly. “You’re real funny, you know?” There was a fake bite in his voice, and he smiled to chase it away. “What are you willing to do for a ban lift?”
It starts off okay. In hindsight, he wishes for some clairvoyance powers so he knows when to stay the fuck at home, in bed, ideally draped across Steve, and away from anything that threatens his new-found happiness.
“Yeah, yeah okay! You’ve got to be joking,” he whined, “how the fuck do you look like that?” he asked, waving frantically towards Steve.
“Yes!” He reached behind him trying to locate Tony and touch him. He was feeling anchored by too little. Frustrated, he moved forward and flipped on his back once more. “I want to see you.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake. Fine, brace yourself.” Against his better judgement, he speeds up to where Rhodey’s annoying the bot. When he gets close enough, and Steve has his knees up behind the shield as well, he lets go of the man, launching him into the Doombot. “But if you get hurt I get to lock you in the tower, you can grow your hair and beard out and we’ll reenact ‘Tangled’ without the evil witch!”
“It’s okay, Steve. I knew you were lying on the phone. But I’m old and look it - unlike others,” she said and sipped her tea for dramatic effect, “and I’m allowed to be selfish and call a national treasure to come fix my bathroom lights and the stupid boiler.”
Tony sighed. “I’m sorry I overreacted and left you there. And then left you altogether. I don’t deal well with that sort of stress.”
“As if I could think of anything else but your naked body now that I’ve seen it.” He licked along the line of his pecs, carefully avoiding Steve’s nipple. “So, darling,” he said, finally biting the nipple lightly and smirking around it as Steve moaned, “are you going to tell me?”
“Yeah, minor burn, nothing to worry about. Dum-E, listen buddy. This is for Steve, okay? You might not like me, but Cap is your favourite, right?” Steve had to refrain from cooing. The robot whirred in what sounded particularly questioning. “Steve
“Dr Foster definitely would,” Darcy told him. “College was a weird time. Don’t ever look up her arrest record.”
When Steve finally entered the room, he was still on the phone, his shirt wonky and half-buttoned, and his shoes in his other hand. “No, Mrs. Williams - Marjorie, of course. Yes, I know we’re almost the same age. I promise it’s not a problem - no other plans. I’ll start making my way now, yes of course I still have the key. Great, don’t worry, I’ll be with you shortly.”
He watches Steve fall to his death as a Doombot explodes, bringing down half a building on the man Tony loves. He hears Steve’s scream over the comm, outside of the comm, in his very soul. And then the world stops spinning. Time stops moving forward. Tony wishes he could stop existing. But nothing is ever that easy. He vaguely registers Bucky’s panicked shout, and Natasha’s repeated calls for Steve over the comm. He hovers, watching as rubble and dust spread out from the site of the crash. There’s a sort of perverted contentedness lurking in the shallows of his mind, unmitigated proof that he is a failure, just like he’d heard from his father, from Obie, from the fucking journalist who’d accused him of facilitating death. He tries to reject the feeling, but it takes a hold of him nonetheless and his entire being is screaming of his complete and utter defeat.
“One thing, Hammer. I warned you.” She linked arms with Tony and started walking them away. “Asshole.”
Steve kissed him. Hard. His hand lowered to thumb at the man’s hip bone. “You’re perfect. Beautiful,” he said, and traced his nose with his forefinger. Then his brow, the fine lines around his eyes. Tony’s leg curled around his waist, bringing their hips together. They moaned together at the brief contact.
“Shhh, none of that, Steve.” Tony was hugging him tightly. “I wanted you to come, it’s my favourite thing in the world. And down my throat, too, what a treat.”
“So let me get this straight. We went from not even mentioning Tony’s birthday to having a week-long event?”
“Were you naked when you said that?” Steve’s panting is distracting enough without the added visual of his strong arms flexing.
Tony had the uncanny and inimitable ability to light up a room when he entered it. They’d playfully argued about it many times, but Steve would never change his mind. Not when he had seen it, felt it, the way Tony filled a room, larger than life,
“I love you,” Steve repeated. “Thank you.” There was more he wanted to say, but he couldn’t focus. Not in the fog of peace that had settled over him.
“Leave him be, Tony. He’s a hyperactive teenager with special powers and super curious about everything, including but not limited to double-teaming,” Pepper intervened, sipping her wine slowly.
“Hurry up, Stark, we’re not getting any younger here. Well, Steve and I will probably be fine, but I’m not so sure about you…”
The smell of fresh coffee was overwhelming - appealing, but overwhelming. His vision tunneled, not unlike the way it did when he was hit with an anxiety attack, and everything seemed to slow down. He noticed the cupboards, the table, the chairs, the speckles of dust in the sunlight, the mountain of croissants, the smell of maple syrup and bacon, the cinnamon, the shadow of a body on the floor. He looked up.
Steve shrugged the best he could. “I’m a big fan of consent. And I love the way your mouth quirks up here when I do it,” he said, touching a fine line that had formed as the man smiled.
Even through lust-clouded brain, Steve’s heart soared at the tender voice Tony used. Steve had seen what coercion looked like, he had been subjected to it before. But this felt like genuine concern, like Steve being comfortable was important to Tony. He could have cried with the implications. “Yeah,” he whispered. “Please.”
I can't give you a date for the next chapter, my mental health is fucking with me and my writing so it's most likely gonna be a while. Thank you for being patient.
“You’d know if I was,” Tony said, a flirtatious hint in his voice. “Also, well done for deflecting. I think dad just had to sit down to avoid an accident because that’s three things so far.”
“Yeah, I get it,” the doctor told him. She dressed his wounds and gave him a cloth to wipe his face. “You seem to be okay, but you need to get your lungs checked at the hospital. The dressings will need changing tonight and you need to stop running into fires.”
When the chuckles around the room died down, Sam touched his shoulder. “Not to burst your bubble, but I’m with Stark on this one. It’s the 19th of December. Do you have
Steve braced himself. “For how I felt whenever I saw you and realised I could never feel like this for anyone else,” he explained. Then he promptly shut his eyes, ready to feel the bed dip as Tony got up, ready to hear the door shutting behind him, and ready to be left alone.
Maybe Steve was really a teenager, like a very late side effect of the serum. Or maybe it was a being-attracted-to-Tony side effect. Maybe Steve was just dumb as all hell and he couldn’t manage his dumb emotions and his dumb expectations and maybe Steve was just dumb. That could have been it. He took a long hot shower, scalding his skin slightly and feeling it heal, and scalding it again, and feeling it heal. He didn’t know how long he was in there for, and when he emerged he was annoyed that it hadn’t worked. He had half a mind to walk down to the lab and shove Tony into a wall and strangle him, but also kiss him, and was Tony into that?
Later Edit: I remembered to give even more thanks to Joey, as well as credit for bouncing ideas with me on the phone while we're traumatising the intelligence officer I'm sure is listening in on my conversations, shout out to him for staying sane. The nervous speech, unplanned and all came from personal experience - I fucked up a TEDx presentation back in March and it stuck with me so I think I needed to get it out. Thanks for sticking with this guys xx
“Focus, Stark, god damn it,” Bucky urges, running up to where they’re collectively keeping Wanda safe so she can contain the fire. Pietro joins them, creating small air voids that help put out the smaller flames.
“You happy about this, Rhodey?” Then he catches on. “I suppose you also want me to launch you into the fucking thing, don’t you?” He can’t help the way his sigh is equal parts exasperated and amused. Maybe a bit loving as well.
“Yeah, but then you’d be bored. This way we can all think of Steve’s obscene memories and we’ll all be entertained,” he said and reclined his seat, then squirmed until he found a comfortable position.
He was fixing his second cufflink when a hand pulled him to the side. He bristled and relaxed instantly when Pepper’s rosy cheeks lifted in a smile.
Tony relaxed visibly. “Oh. Oh, I can help. Tissues over here in the nightstand, water in the mini fridge on your side of the bed… uh, that side of the bed.” He tried for a subject change. “Starstruck, huh?”
Steve smiled at their easy banter - years of knowing each other, a deep connection did that to people. He wished he had that same easy way of communicating with Tony. The others he’d developed an easy-going relationship with. Perhaps it was in his head, fuelled by the way his heart fluttered whenever Tony and him interacted. It could have very well been the case that he was projecting the entire thing and their relationship wasn’t stunted or fragmented in any way.
“That’s entirely on you,” Steve informed him. He pushed the fabric lower on Tony’s thighs, letting the trousers drop on the floor. “I’m just seeing to your outfittary needs.”
“I was working on a space suit and then I passed out and when I woke up Mr Fantastic was calling me and I just flew out to beat the crap out of a Doombot and to avoid Reed’s annoying voice. And I guess I forgot,” he finished lamely.
–” He grabbed Tony’s hair, conscious of his own strength, much like he’d done in the dream. “And you insisted but –”
So he went. Natasha followed closely after she said something quietly in Russian. Three of the agents followed Tony and the others stood guard outside the stall. The inside was bigger than Steve had expected. It had a vast array of fortune telling paraphernalia, a crystal ball, tarot cards and the like. The woman sat down at the small round table and gestured for Steve to follow through.
“I’m dismissing you, agent,” Steve insisted. “I’m going to text Pepper now and let her know. I promise you’ll still receive the extra pay for working today if you promise to hug your mother and not go too wild with your friends.”
It took the better part of an hour, but they were victorious. After much consideration and measuring, they bought a twelve feet tall monster tree. Steve sighed at Darcy’s suggestion, but snapped a photo of her standing next to it for comparison. He ignored the four hundred something messages and sent the photo. It truly was monstrous. Steve loved it.
“Mhm.” Steve kissed his lips gently, enjoying the way Tony seemed to unravel the more they deepened their kiss.
Steve closed his eyes for the briefest of moments and the bulge of Tony’s throat came to mind so fast he could swear he got whiplash.
Steve couldn’t catch his breath, no matter how much he tried. Almost like asthma, but nowhere near as damning. He focused, one inhale at a time. There was no way he could count, so he did his best to approximate the timing of the gasps. “You’re going to lift the ban, then?” he thought he asked. He couldn’t be sure that it was out loud.
He laughed and gave up trying to dissuade her. He’d just have to find a way out of this one as always. “You’d think there were no more people I can say no to,” he said jokingly.
They let him be, bless them. Back in his room, he realised he could feel his fingers hurting because of the cold. He knew that realistically he was safe and definitely not cold, but he couldn’t help feeling like he was freezing, extremities first. He took a scalding hot shower, teeth chattering even in the steam-filled bathroom. When he got into bed, he made sure he turned the thermostat up, then proceeded to put on sweatpants and a top and bundle himself up in at least three blankets. The cold was unyielding. He fell asleep accompanied by the sound of his own laboured breathing.
“Oh my god,” he whisper-shouted. He couldn’t help but laugh. They were such idiots. “Oh my god, fuck off all of you!”
Vision is carrying an exhausted Wanda away. He feels bad for the kid, but he’s so grateful. Thor’s lightning fall relentlessly. There really seems to be no end to the incoming bots. He wonders where Doom finds the motivation to be so shit. Tony gets bored of things really quickly. Even grudges bore him after a while. Perhaps not this particular grudge that he now has on Doom for ruining his nice time with Steve.
Steve thought it was a joke at first, but then when they finally found Nat, she was casually juggling with a couple of knives. “Hi guys, this is Dmitri.”
“Steve!” he finally heard, and judging by the loudness of the call, it wasn’t the first time it was said. Bucky was by his side, holding what looked like a large metal tripod and a mug of something steaming. “You okay?”
him. They’d come back from bad fights, if this was a delicate situation, they’d navigate it. But Tony was kissing him back, moving his lips fervently over Steve’s, hands up to hold the back of his neck, and Steve’s heart was singing.
Bucky grinned. “But it’s so much fun, Stevie! Besides she looked great, and who was I going to dance with? You? You have eight left feet. You’re like a clumsy spider whenever you even think of a dance floor.” Steve punched him again in the same spot, really hoping it would bruise, at least for a couple of minutes. “You know, when you were just a scrawny kid in Brooklyn and I fought all your fights –"
“What’s wrong?” Steve shook his head, trying to school his face in a neutral expression. “You know you can’t lie to me,” he said with a smile.
“You do. I know for a fact you’ve eaten close to nothing today. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I chose sex over your wellbeing?”
“Here,” Bucky said, and dropped the stand next to the tree. “Lift and to the right. Other right, Stevie, for God’s sake have you never put a tree in a stand before?”
“It’ll be fine, Cap, you worry too much. Here, shopping list. Hide everything in your room, we can’t order online, she’ll know. Thanks!”
“You’re so precious,” Tony whispered. “You’re so precious and so hot and holy shit, I wanna stare at your for hours and do nothing else with my day,” he blurted.
“Cause they’re too dumb to burn down New York,” he deadpanned. “Let’s face it, Bruce and Darcy would elope if they haven’t already, Bucky would go apeshit and start aggressively dancing on the street for some change, and the others I can’t even begin to explain.”
Flying was a big one. He’d tell his mother all about it over dinner, he’d tell Bucky about it when they were children. He’d explain about the planes and the zeppelins and the hot air balloons. Then he’d draw it and imagine how it must feel to be weightless, unaffected by illness. At times, Steve thought about how it would feel to stop existing altogether, how liberating and how beautiful. But as Tony held him tightly, he forced those particular memories out, choosing to focus on the nicer aspects of his experience.
There was some reward in staying sober when no one else did. Steve was certain to remember the moment Darcy Lewis stepped on the steel ledge at the bottom of the bar, leaned over the tall structure, gripped Bruce’s shirt, and pulled him for a kiss. And Steve was lonely and kind of miserable so he watched them because the warmth in his chest was beautiful, and it was so much better than the loudness in his head.
All the Avengers came in to say hi, shepherded by Pepper who brought them cookies and hot chocolate. Jane was a hit with a couple of little girls who wanted to be scientists, and Natasha showed some of them how to get out of a hold before she was rushed away. “I’ll be good,” she shouted, “just let me tell them what not to do when they’re attacked from the side.”
“Ah, well. You see. There was a sort of. You know, I don’t actually know why. Maybe it’s some Christmas miracle -”
“She kissed me, I was busy staring at you and feeling like a train hit me. Again,” he added without thinking.
“But I wanted you to,” Tony explained. “I loved every second of it.” He ground his erection into Steve’s hip. “Loved it this much.”
He didn’t stick around to see if there was any response to his swearing. He switched to airplane mode and shoved it in his coat pocket. He turned to Darcy’s roars of laughter and Bruce biting his lips struggling to contain his.
Clint actually groaned. “Tasha, anything but that! Remember Tijuana?” He shuffled his feet towards the bar where Tony started pouring shots.
Tony scoffed. “You know when you have sixty tabs opened and three of them are singing and one of them is a pop-up telling you that you’ve won –"
“For the last time,” Steve started with a clipped voice, “it’s just in the right light that we even look similar at all. Also, can someone please help me with this, or should I just hold it for the rest of the season?” He tried looking around without jostling the tree too much. “At least then I’d be useful,” he added very quietly. Both his team mates pretended not to hear.
They had started on the baubles when Jane walked in with a box. She placed it on the coffee table and started going through it. “These are all the decorations Darcy and I collected. Some are spectacularly ugly, but I thought maybe you’d want to use some of them.” Steve was moved, and went to thank her, but she was already walking out the room, twisting her hair in a bun and holding it in place with a pen. She stopped, ran up to Thor to kiss him once, and then ran out of the room babbling about formulas and work work work.
Tony leaned on his elbows, bending the jelly dick so he could suck on it and also look straight ahead. His eyes seemed glued to Steve’s thighs. He figured, as a last desperate thought, that the scientist was staring at whatever was in front of him, and at the highest point he could without rolling his eyes. Steve wanted to ignore the way the man’s throat bulged as he relaxed it to accommodate the phallus. He really, really did. But he’d seen the Godfather, and there was a bit there where Michael gets hit by lightning when he falls in love and Steve had no idea why that was where his mind took him, but it damned felt like Thor unleashed his thunder god power right through his spine. Tony swallowed around the thing, and Steve would swear until the end of time that the bottle of tequila he didn’t realise he was holding most definitely
Steve nodded, wiping the drying come from Tony’s skin. “Let me get you clean first.” He wiped his own abdomen, then stretched before moving to climb over Tony to get to
Tony was smiling now, a wide grin that reached his eyes. He turned to Natasha. “I love when he gets all righteous, makes my skin go tingly and my –”
“When we rebuilt this,” he gestured around him, “I put it down with the Avengers as the owners. Then I kept adding people to the list of what the Avengers mean. It’s not a big deal, your name on the papers or not this is your home.” He pushed the turkey symbolically. The bird was huge. “Now carve it and feed us, Captain… Captain? I’ll have to think about it,” he told Steve, and that was the end of it.
“Technically, it was about old white men being unable to capitalise on your speech and taking their frustrations out on me,” Nat replied.
“People just don’t believe I’m me!” He shrugged. “And with my luck, I’d just end up accidentally hooking up with some villain who would kidnap me and I just know I wouldn’t ever live it down. None of you would let me.”
“Real mature,” Tony accused. But he moaned nonetheless as Steve nuzzled his cock through his boxers. “You look good enough to eat, anyway. Who needs dinner?”
“Uhm, yeah I do. I know everything,” he said with a smile. “Please don’t worry, what you did was magnificent. You should have seen their faces.”
“That’s it! That’s it, Steve. Come on darling, come back to me,” he pleaded. Steve couldn’t make out all of the words, but the voice was soothing, and the way the man rubbed his arms up and down was nice so eventually, he managed to see without feeling like he was floating.
Steve laughed. “The only time I won was when they got to that. After being mocked for an entire night, I pulled Jackie to the side and asked her to tell me everything she knew.”
He has to physically bite his tongue to stop from being crude, choosing instead to open his arms so Steve can step in his embrace. Even through the metal, holding Steve feels wonderful. Like how it feels when he settles into bed after a two-day marathon of lab work. Like how it feels to wash away the grime after a battle. Like how it feels to get a solution to a problem. Like home. When they land, he’s nowhere near ready to let go. He quickly opens his faceplate, hovering enough to hide Steve’s face. Then he ducks and presses his lips to the man’s jaw.
Steve fought the snort threatening to escape. Hammer, on the other hand, didn’t look as amused. He took a step towards Tony, but Steve was sober and had the advantage of the serum and was in love with Tony and was just generally angry at everything. So he also took a step forward, essentially shielding the scientist behind him. He could swear there was an actual shadow over Hammer, and the widening, almost fearful eyes that met his made him happy.
Steve could feel the wetness seeping in as his hole throbbed for attention. He grabbed Tony’s hair, rocking back and forth onto the man’s tongue. “That feels so good. You’re so good to me,” he whispered, desperate for more.
The whisper from his childhood, praying for his restlessness to end. The voice of a nanny, he can’t remember her name but he knows the kindness in her eyes. It echoes in his head, undefined, like warmth from a steady fire while it snows and he wants to cry but the tears stop in his throat and he swallows again and again. It’s like having a bone broken slowly, counting fragments of seconds.
, cause he was an immigrant, wasn’t he? And they kept asking to see his birth certificate. They pulled every single public record there was of him, most of which had been made public after they’d decided he was dead. It would have been too much hassle to move them back into classified, so they didn’t. Transparency was a big one, especially after the whole Washington fuck up.
Tony smiled. “Stop being an old man. I hate the attention this is getting. As if the lunch today wasn’t enough,” he said with a sigh.
It was comfortable, working on various things side by side. The plane wasn’t as fast as the quinjet, but this wasn’t an Avengers mission, and they wanted to come across as diplomats. Steve found himself actually wishing they were going into battle, because that required little to no civilian interaction, no small talk, and no forced smiles. And he wouldn’t have to wear a suit.
“I love you,” Tony echoed. “You’re wonderful, so good. So good for me, my love. I got you,” he assured. “Breathe now, Steve, you’ve done so well. Shh, I’ve got you.”
It took weeks to be able to put together the photo album that Tony was currently caressing, apparently afraid of opening. Steve had talked to Peggy and Peggy had directed him to some other old SHIELD members, who then pointed out archives for him. Then he had to physically spend time sifting through papers and reports, then to make more phone calls and pull rank in order to get copies of the photos. A couple he actually stole because there was a limit to his patience, and rude people were not a helping factor.
“Ah, I take it you got it to work?” Steve asked as he sat on one of the armchairs. Tony took the other one.
“You looked like someone was giving you a lap dance,” Natasha joined in without looking up from the papers.
She looked at him. “Who?” Then she turned to Steve who was still soothing the goat. “Oh! Hi bubba, hi sweetheart,” she cooed. “Okay, yeah, I’ll forgive you.”
“Sometimes I think I’ve got you all figured out and then you say something and manage to surprise me.” The silence was less uncomfortable this time. He didn’t have a chance to say anything before Tony spoke again. “I’m not mad at you, I worry about you.”
“General, the last person who used this tone with me ended up eating with a straw for two weeks,” he heard Natasha say on the phone. “Absolutely a threat, sir.” She paused, and Steve could hear indistinct shouting coming from the phone. “Sir, you sound hysterical, is it hormones? Is it that time of the month?” she asked smiling. “We are backing him all the way, one hundred percent.” More shouting on the other end. “We’re not being paid at all, let alone from the taxpayers’ money.” Shouting, then a tone. She put the phone down.
“There we go. Move your hands behind your back. Grab your elbows, push your chest out for me.” He bent to kiss Steve’s forehead, then presented him with the leash’s leather handle. “Open and – good. Now bite.” The leash was long enough that it was just about comfortably taut on Steve’s chest. “Lean your head back until – yeah, isn’t that better?” Steve moaned in response. I’ll be right back, okay? Two minutes. Don’t swallow, don’t let go of the handle, don’t loosen the pull on your cock.”
Tony moved to lick his pulse point, then up behind his ear. “My mind has been full of nothing else but you. I’ve spent hours, nights, trying to figure out how to explain that I am… that I feel so… And in the end, I figured I don’t…” He stopped and chose to trace Steve’s outer shell with his tongue.
“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” He slid down to lick on Steve’s abs. “This is, though,” he said, and rubbed his cheek along the bulge in Steve’s pants.
“Nah, I got this! I can see you laugh, just so you know.” Steve stopped abruptly, tensing at the thought that he’d been rude. “I love it, it’s a welcome change from earlier,” Tony said, giving him a wide grin.
“Yeah,” he had to pause for a yawn, “don’t forget about the charitable baseball game and the Saturday night ball.”
“Yeah, got patched up downstairs,” he said and walked in to plop on Steve’s bed. “Fuck it, I’m too tired.” He reached over and pulled the duvet off Steve, swiftly making a cocoon out of it. He arranged the blanket around his head and sighed happily in his new nest. “Thanks Steve, you’re the best.”
“It’s okay,” he rushed to reassure the man, even though he felt it was not okay and it wouldn’t be for a while. His mind had been busy with the danger, but now it had passed, so Steve was back to hardcore overthinking.
He paused because tongue-in-cheek was one thing and snarky as fuck was something else. His knees were also weak and he wondered once more what exactly the fuck he was doing. He was not a performer, he was not a performer. They strapped him in a suit and had him dancing on shaky stages. But these people deserved better so he inhaled, exhaled, and went on. He wasn’t a speechwriter, but he was passionate and free. “We have been invited to partake in the celebration of development, of responsible economic growth, of investing in the future, of… of… – hold on.” He took the paper out and searched for the paragraph he needed. “Ah, there it is! Of ‘extirpating the evil of cruel intentions’ and whatnot. Stellar speech, but I don’t warp the truth on stages anymore, prime-minister.”
“Steve, after Afghanistan I had Rhodey stay with me every time I napped in the lab. I couldn’t do more than twenty minutes and I had to check he was still there. It took months for me to sleep in a bed again,” Tony told him. “It does help, knowing you’re not alone.”
“Tony,” Steve whined. This right here, this banter, this lighthearted way of interacting. Steve loved it. He kept at drinking his tea to avoid saying something embarrassing.
“Darling. I know when you’re about to come, I know how to get you there. I wanted it,” he reassured.
“Corny, horny, get with the program Stevie, come on! You’d think you were still a blushing virgin with how clueless you are,” Bucky laughs at Steve, and several others join in.
Steve didn’t even know what ‘this’ was. He wasn’t running for office, he was just mad. “The media?” he asked in the same small voice.
Tony’s happy his face is hidden when he watches Steve fight his way to Vision and Thor. He almost flies the same way, ready to throw himself at anything that can endanger Steve. He actually starts towards the corner Steve turns, but the next thing he knows he’s thrown backwards into a wall. He blasts the Doombots surrounding Black Panther and Bucky almost methodically, buying them time to regroup.
Steve rolled his eyes. He didn’t actually remember. His best guess is he was agonizing in a corner about making Peggy like him. He tried not to choke on air when Tony’s hand went up following Rhodes’s. “You are going down. Literally,” he heard the scientist say. Pepper joined them as well, downing her entire champagne flute. Bruce ran his hand down his face.
The new rumble of thunder makes the hair on the back of Tony’s neck stand up. He’s ready when lightning hits him, and he channels it into a beam of pure energy, tearing a hole in the horde of bots.
“I’m fine, thank you for asking. Life is peaceful here on the prairie,” the AI’s voice came back. “How’s your love life, boss? Any luck at all with -”
The National Carnival was massive. It reminded Steve of country funfairs and Coney Island in a field. It was impossible to estimate the magnitude of it without getting to higher ground. And even with how eccentric he proved himself to be, it was a bit much to start climbing on booths to get to the old rollercoaster pillars to get an idea. At least they were out of formalwear and back into jeans and comfortable shoes. They needed it if they were going to get any fun out of the experience.
“No.” He paused. “Maybe?” He threw his free hand up in resignation. “Okay, yeah, I needed to know and neither of you would tell me anything, so…”
He was about to ask them how much more there was to see and do before they could at least go back to their accommodation if not fly back to New York altogether when he felt someone grab his arm. He bristled instantly, their security detail immediately popped up next to him, while Nat produced a knife out of nowhere. Once they assessed the situation, they all mostly stood down.
Steve heard the Polaroid go off. He couldn’t see Tony properly, so he waited, trying to look as enticing as possible. His thoughts were focused solely on the man, on how he was going to execute the rest of his plan. How it would feel to be watched. To be allowed to come. God, to finally come. He felt Tony’s fingers gently prying the handle out of his mouth.
The large man’s body shook in time with his vigorous head shake before she finished. “No, no,” he said, sans accent and as convincing as he could. “Miss Romanova, as beautiful and –”
Cap was distracted by Bruce rolling on the floor with the goat, that was the only reason he didn’t shut up. “That’s not a bad thing, being like Tony,” he said, pouring a cup of coffee. He realised they were all looking at him after a few second of silence. He willed his face to not blush. “What? He’s alright,” he tried to save it.
Darcy grinned and fluttered her lashes. “I guess we’ll find out,” she said and winked at the turkey.
“Jesus, Steve,” Tony gasped, openly ogling him. He made to grab his cock, but stopped himself. “Look at you,” he whispered absently.
. His eyes welled up. Yes, Tony had assured him it had been fine, but what if it hadn’t? He felt arms snake by his sides, behind his shoulder blades, and pulling him close.
“We’re getting to that,” Tony informs him. The street below is flooded with more bots, and he’s so over this fight, especially since his mind is reeling with Steve-scenarios. He wonders briefly if this is what being a writer feels like. He’s ready to be home, cuddled up to Steve’s naked body, watching Tangled. “Thor, get me some power, buddy.”
Steve bottomed out. A tad too quickly, but he couldn’t wait. And the stretch was most welcome. He trembled, impaled on Tony’s cock. The man moved his hips up a fraction. His hands were on Steve’s ass, kneading and caressing, tapping the cheeks playfully, no real sting to it. And Steve lifted himself slowly, clenching as he moved up. “Want you… in me… always.”
Steve was lightly biting along his hips, moving up as he dragged Tony’s top off. He pressed wet kisses onto his chest, licked around his nipples slowly, then dragged his mouth to where the arc reactor was embedded into his chest. That’s when he stopped.
Tony's bed was huge. Tony's fingers were glorious. And Steve was just about having the best birthday ever.
“What are you on about, Buck?” Steve asked around a mouthful of popcorn, still holding the bowl on his lap.
and so, so glorious when Tony moved another finger to join the first one. He was on full display, opening up to Tony more intimately than he ever thought possible. Then Tony began scissoring patiently, dragging his blunt nails on his way out, short-circuiting Steve’s brain mercilessly.
Steve could hear shuffling, then steps. He heard the wheels of a chair being pulled closer, then he felt Tony tapping his shoulder. He opened his eyes, taking a couple of seconds to focus in the bright lights. The first thing he noticed was how close Tony’s face was to his. Then he saw the blue smear on the man’s cheek; it looked like frosting. Which led him to the logical conclusion that he should look down. It took some willpower, but he succeeded. Tony had indeed baked him cupcakes, covered with red, blue, and white frosting; he sat in front of him, biting his lips nervously.
Steve stopped as soon as he disabled the Doombot. “How is flirting with me acceptable in the middle of a battle? I swear if we had a working HR that wasn’t an angry guy who disappeared off the face of the planet when he was inconvenienced…” Steve tried as hard as possible not to hyperventilate as he said the words.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted. He then turned around, back straight and pulled up to his entire height, goat still secure in his arms. He rocked the scared animal in his arms to help it settle down. “Jones, is it? Back off. You’re in the way of the doctors and firefighters. And you’re overstepping all your boundaries.”
Tony snorted. “Steve, I’m joking! I’m a grown ass man, for fuck’s sake. Even if chaperones were still a thing, I’d have… I don’t know, eaten mine by now.”
He stayed quiet about it, kept to himself, smiling at the occasional sound from Bennu. They ended up taking her, of course. What Tony set his mind to do, he did. In a way, Steve wanted to be more like him. More assertive, even if it was a front. Peggy used to tell him all the time he commanded respect because he had this honest face. She used to say that he was stoic. He wondered if she’d shoot at him (again) for being the cause of such a fuck-up. She’d probably shake her head and pour him a drink, then down it when she remembered it had no effect on him.
It wasn’t the silence that was uncomfortable, it was Steve’s remorse at breaking down to that extent. “I wanna tell you. I do.” He slouched down further, feeling like he caved in on himself. “Can I have a blanket or something? I feel like I’m naked.”
“June says she might feel some sort of phantom pain.” Steve’s heart sank. “We’ve got painkillers for her if she shows any signs of distress.”
“Promise? I love watching,” came the reply and Steve was about half a wrong breath away from smacking Tony’s hands with the carving fork.
But it worked. A barely contained shiver moved his hand minutely and Tony missed a shot. “You’re playing dirty, Rogers,” he said with a laugh.
Steve spent hours watching the ceiling after their casual party finally broke up around two in the morning. He got up and tried drawing, but his hands didn’t cooperate - it seemed a common thing these days. He tried reading the new book he got, but he couldn’t focus. He tried doing crosswords, but his mind was loud and eventually he gave up and waited. He could normally fall asleep as soon as he wanted, courtesy of years having to do it in various army settings, but it seemed not even that worked right. Steve was a downright mess.
Steve rolled his eyes, willing the beast that was somersaulting in his stomach to calm the fuck down. “That’s cause you’re rich.”
Steve sighed with contentedness, dropping his forehead to rest on Tony’s shoulder. He felt the small tugs. “Thank you,” he managed in a shaky voice. Then Tony’s hand on his back was maneuvering him, the leash pulled taut but not painfully so. It felt like there was a Steve-shaped slot in the universe and he’d just stepped into it. A mould to fit into, in between Tony’s hand supporting him and Tony’s other hand owning him. He half-fell back on the chair.
The marksman shot at him with what Pepper had explained was a nerf gun, the foam dart hitting him in the leg. He grabbed a chair, swung it around in place to face him, and Steve’s stomach sank when he realised where that was going.
Steve quickly locates his best friend, back to back with Black Panther. They’re caught in between Doombots, working together to keep them away from the escaping civilians. “Status report. Widow come in.”
“Yeah, with your metabolism and all. And I know it’s mostly not recommended for panic and anxiety, but you looked like you could use it.”
“Oh. I…” Tony fondled his balls, licking his nipple at the same time. When his hand moved up to twist around the now-leaking head, he sucked on the hardened bud. “Fuck. Okay, okay. Uhm… the throat thing. Oh, yeah! Natasha’s birthday, you were sucking the jelly dick and at some point you took it really deep and – please, Tony!” When his request garnered no significant change in action, he continued, frustration obvious in his words. “And your throat bulged in the most obscene way. I thought I would go insane thinking about it. That was actually the first time you left me speechless,” he admitted through gritted teeth.
Steve’s eyes flew open. He turned them around almost aggressively, pressing Tony down into the sofa. “Tell me,” Steve growled.
He moved his hand to grip Tony’s cock, then moved lower so he could lick the tiny beads of sweat forming on the side of his neck. When Tony moaned, it came out hoarse, evidence of how much effort had gone into giving Steve pleasure. He managed to rationalise it enough to be able to focus on the task at hand.
“Clint, why?” Natasha’s voice gave away some annoyance, but mostly humour. So at least she liked it somewhat.
Sam sat opposite Bucky, both of them staring at each other. Steve was trying to decide if it was flirting or competing, but he came up short. Fury sat on the side of an armchair, drinking whiskey from the bottle, probably lamenting how much money went into the Avengers Initiative. Steve couldn’t blame the man. His good eye was starting to lose focus, and Steve felt a slight pang of jealousy at the ability.
“You used to be such a nice girl, Pepper,” Tony said, sliding the sweater over his head. He emerged with crazy hair and a scowl. When he rolled it down his torso, the knitted Grinch on it was his spitting image. “What happened?”
The applause started again and this time when the whistling came, Steve saw Tony doing it so there was no doubt. His ears were ringing, his heart pounding. In the brief seconds he walked off stage towards the prime-minister he couldn’t help but think of all the ways he’d fucked up. The man was waiting for him, angry vein pulsating in his temple, sweaty and face tight with rage. Steve slapped the speech on his puffed chest and looked him straight in the eye. “I’m not a dancing monkey anymore, prime-minister. You picked the wrong person.” He walked back to their table and sat down, stiff and afraid. Next to him, both Tony and Natasha were grinning. His phone was going wild again in his pocket.
“I’ll go move some heavy crap out of the way and then I’ll meet you back at the hotel. Thanks doc! And Tony, you’re not taking the goat,” he said and walked away through the crowd to get to the emergency team.
“It’s when you suck on – ah, how to – ” Her inability to not be helpful left her stranded halfway through her sentence not really knowing how to go on. “Tony?”The scientist lifted his hands in a clear sign of not-touching-this-one-it’s-hilarious-to-watch-you-struggle. Pepper looked around some more, her cheeks starting to redden.
“Please,” Steve moaned. He got up, shifted them around until he had Tony sitting on the floor. “Want you inside me.”.
“Think you can take me?” It was a compulsion, Steve gathered, and that was the only explanation he was willing to accept.
Steve smirked as he rummaged through the drawer for tissues. “Yeah, famous cock and all,” he said matter-of-factly, waving in the general direction of Tony’s crotch. The resounding laugh he got was heartwarming. “My side of the bed, huh?”
Tony was quiet for a long time. His other hand joined the effort and together they caressed Steve’s temples and cheekbones. “My mom did that too. When I woke up from nightmares, she would sit next to me on the bed and tell me stories and pat my head. I figured it would help.”
“Tony, it’s five in the morning. I just got in two hours ago, I’m tired, I’m bruised and I’ve been clawed at in the most unsexy way of my life. Please, for the love of everything, shut the fuck up.” He yawned.
“Stark, you and I both know the only reason you’re against it is that you didn’t think of it first.”
The photo op with the ghastly statue (Steve was adamant there was only one they moved around despite both Natasha and Tony telling him there were definitely more than one, Steve just accept it) was shorter than originally planned, Steve was sure. If anything, at least they didn’t have to pose for an hour in the scorching sun.
Drop me a line and let me know how you found it. Remember, if you don't have anything nice to say, make sure it's at least constructive. If it can't be constructive, shove it up your arse. Thanks for reading, much love xx
The rollercoaster gave Steve the jitters. Not because it was scary – a medium sized ride with wooden tracks wasn’t frightening at all. But it looked old and it creaked when it ran, and Tony was out of the suit and not enhanced in any way except for that big brain of his, and what if he couldn’t catch him in time? Steve hated the idea, hated the visuals it brought. But he went on with it, sat behind Natasha and Tony, hands clenching on the metal safety bar, ready to act if something went wrong. Tony seemed to have a good time, all woos and unlikely shrieks and hands in the air. Natasha made sure to film the whole thing and send it to their team back home.
The blonde hair was the first clue, but it wasn’t until she stepped up in between him and Hammer that Steve smelled her perfume and realised it was the same woman who had kissed him earlier. Great. The Red Skull sounded good right about now, please and thanks. She slithered under Hammer’s arm, reaching to fondle Steve’s bicep.
Tony’s therapist apparently sprayed water on him, inspired by the meme Tony felt the need to share with her. Tony loved her dearly for that, he’d said.
Thor bleated once more, hand reaching out to Bennu. She seemed to be hyper aware that someone might understand her.
He must have dozed off because he came to suddenly aware of the clattering sound in the lab. To his horror, he realised the sound was coming from him - his teeth were chattering loudly. The cold hit him all at once, on every inch of his skin and deep under it to his very soul.
“Fine! He downed it and gave her a look. “You’re a mean player, but you are also the most lethal person I ever heard of.”
Steve was presented with a water bottle and he downed it in one go. Then he sighed. “Thank you,” he managed in a small voice.
“Okay. Okay, I’ll let it go for now. But if this keeps happening you come straight to me and we’ll work it out, yeah?” Tony’s hand on his shoulder was so familiar now, Steve was actually surprised when it tightened in what he catalogued as a caring gesture.
“There he goes again. Cap, you should share with us. It might help us survive the full day ahead of us,” Nat said patiently.
He thanked the people for their help, both professionals and the volunteers. They seemed lost for words at first, then shook his hand and thanked him in return. Some of them asked for photos and he indulged them because they were polite and they shared the same dirt and soot and superficial wounds.
Steve couldn’t voice  it. He wanted to, but it seemed that for all the over-sharing he’d done, he couldn’t delve back into it. “The… Uh…”
He took Tony’s glasses off and put them down on the coffee table in front of them. He cupped the man’s cheek and kissed him once more. His brain couldn’t comprehend what was happening. He had dreamt about it for so long; the intimacy was almost painful with how tender and wholesome it was. His other hand snaked under Tony’s t-shirt, touching his waist fleetingly. He stared at the way the arc reactor lit his emblem in the poor light of the room. A strong feeling of possessiveness took over him.
attractive. Problem: he found Tony Stark attractive. Gosh, Steve was well happy no one could actually read his mind. They’d either pass out with the sheer stupidity that floated around, or pass out from laughing too much.
“That’s it, you got this,” Bucky said again. “You okay?” he asked when Steve’s breathing calmed down a bit.
“Don’t swallow. Hold it there,” he told Steve. Then he nodded with a smile. “Very good, darling. That’s all you get for now. If you’re good maybe I can give you a better reward later, yeah?”
“Real head of the family,” Bucky said peeking into a bag. “Ah, yeah! Burgers! See Steve? He remembered!”
There was a long string of rapid one-liners about Mr. Fantastic that Steve had to focus to battle through. “It’s your lost puppy face and the tasteful bulging muscles. If everybody who handed me things looked like you, I’d have less of a problem with it. Oh, he’s being stretched thin!”
“We’re doing nothing of the sort,” he said in what he hoped was a confident voice. “Peter, if you’re gonna… uhm, learn new things, don’t share them with Tony. Just like the rest of us don’t,” he added without thinking.
Familiar bars reached Steve’s ears. Tony started dance-walking around the lab, rummaging for something. “This song,” Steve started.
“So you’re not into feisty brunettes?” Tony asked, now close enough to Steve’s crotch that he pushed the towel up with his nose.
“Seriously? You’re going to load up the dishwasher now? This is deja vu. Why are you doing this to me again?”
Steve could only focus on the bit where Tony wanted to stop him from talking. He snorted bitterly. Of course the man didn’t want anything else. On the bright side, he knew how Tony Stark’s lips felt like on his. On the horrendously dark side, it had been done with a purpose, not at all because he felt like it.
“Hey! I’m romantic! This one time I baked cookies and shit for this guy.” Another pause, where he seemed to realise what he’d said. “Anyway,” he tried, getting up.
“That would be completely inappropriate,” Tony said with a fake grave voice. Steve had no fucking clue anymore. He was an idiot.
“I’d rather you didn’t think of other times you’ve been with someone when you’re in bed with me,” Steve told him in a fake-clipped tone.
Tony pushed in a trolley full of paper bags around the time they were considering stopping and leaving room for their absent team and friends to add to the tree. “Dinner!” he shouted, and everyone rallied around him. “Look at me provide for my family,” he said to all of them, clapping a couple of times in an usual display of self-congratulation.
He decided the best course of action was to open his eye as little as possible and try to make something out in the dark. The very dim blue hue that met him made his heart race even faster, this time with the comfort of its familiarity, as well as with the implications. He opened his eyes fully and stared in its general direction.
“Your feet,” Steve said. When Tony lifted his chin to meet his eyes, he shrugged once more. “What, you have cute toes. They wiggle when you’re excited.”
“We’re on foreign soil, imagine how much crap Hill would have to deal with. On second thought, I’m down if you’re down. Just aim for the leg, I can get sympathetic looks from heart eyed locals. You know, with the limp and everything -”
Steve woke up unexpectedly well rested considering the few hours of sleep he had. He had coffee ready before he knocked on Natasha’s door. Gently. He was sure she could kill him through the wood.
“Oh. I just - I just remembered something from the war,” he lied, trying to conjure a memory of those times.
Steve sighed. “Incoming,” he warned. With a fluid motion, he lifted Tony over his shoulder and carried him out in the kitchen. Unusual, but the close proximity was soothing, and Steve was a glutton for it; and for not being able to have more than stolen touches, it seemed.
“Oooh, not touching that one! Good talk, Stark. I’ll let you get back to it now,” he said, and left quickly, before Steve could have a go at him.
“Just a little more,” he instructed, and Steve got up enough to allow Tony to place the pillow under his head. “Okay?”
The other man paused mid-step at his response. “You, ah - you want some dinner? We’re gonna order something from downstairs.”
Tony chuckled as he shifted to settle in Steve’s arms. “We’ll discuss that, don’t think we won’t. So, Captain Rogers. Ties, deepthroating, maybe a bit of punishment, what else should I know about?” Steve stayed quiet, grateful his head was above Tony’s and he wouldn’t be able to see how hard he was blushing. “Steve?”
“Okay, did I do anything to upset you? Is it the t-shirt? It’s a really comfy t-shirt, you know, and I figured it’s your birthday and all and –”
Then he sees. Steve’s chest is rising. He’s being carefully lifted, shrouded in Wanda red, cradled away from danger. Tony feels himself being moved in the same direction as Steve. Perhaps there’s a chance to join him in whatever life there is. He thinks he’s finally crying.
“And what have we here?” He knew the voice brutally well. “Steve, you should have said something, sweetheart!”
The lobby was busy and he was painfully aware of everyone staring at him. His tie was slightly too tight, and while it would normally bother him, right now it kept him focused. He welcomed the change over the buzzing of the same thoughts over and over again. To further focus on something else, he arranged the car for the drive to the whatever gathering they were to attend – Steve ignored that part of the conversation with surprising ease. In hindsight, it wasn’t typical of him to not know parameters to a mission, regardless of its nature, but this entire thing was different than their usual work.
Extreme temperatures weren’t necessarily debilitating to Steve, but they weren’t exactly comfortable. He couldn’t claim the cold bothered him, but it wasn’t pleasant. This kind of cold was worse, however. He was unable to shake it, despite the June heat. The tower’s central heating system was regulated; the temperature was generally pleasant to be in regardless of the season. But even so, Steve felt cold. He took to turning the heat on at night and he swaddled himself in every blanket he had. The shivering was relentless, and when he did fall asleep, he had nightmares about the ice.
Tony pushed him down then, pulling his fingers out and replacing them with his tongue. He licked sharply around his loosened hole and dipped inside, making Steve clench his fists in the sheets once more. He’d never thought anything could feel as great - and then Tony’s hand gripped his dick. Steve gasped, pushing down into the tightness. Eager for more, he got up on all fours, finally obeying Tony’s instructions.
Jane took a step forward, and Darcy’s hand shot out to catch her shoulder. She tried her best withering glance, but it seemed the good Dr. Foster had gone to the dark side. Steve was proud of his reference, even if he had yet to watch Star Wars. That was a new thing he’d started doing, where he privately googled popular references just so he wouldn’t be lost in conversation. He just hadn’t gotten around to watch everything he missed being frozen, and that made the cheating thought a bit less poignant. Jane nodded at Darcy, and Darcy shook her head, so Jane nodded
