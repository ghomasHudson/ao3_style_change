Dean hisses and turns away when he sees the sight of the smashed Peterbilt. Taking deep breaths doesn’t work; Dean is pissed. His fists clench and his eyes catch sight of his damaged load. The trailer’s metal is crumpled and torn apart, revealing the deliverables inside. Anger peaks.
His footsteps stop near the opening of the alley, right where Dean and Cas are. Cas thinks he’s going to have a legitimate heart attack. Jack calls out once more, “Cas?”
“Something smells good,” Dean’s voice said, much closer.
Cas looks torn, but Dean just has so many questions. He figures that just a few answers now will qualm his racing thoughts. Cas seems to read this on his face, because he relents, “Basically, Luci is a federal fugitive. The other day he showed up in town and tried to hurt Jack.”
“Well, you, on the other hand, you,” Dean checks Cas out with a glimmer in his eyes, “Looking good.”
“I know.”
“Well, then,” Cas moves around the counter, pocketing the paper with his wallet and keys, “Let’s walk down together.”
“Fuck me again,” Cas requests.
Dean looked deep into the reflection then, wondering what everyone else saw.
Dean’s eyes were trailing over Castiel, his voice drenched in emotion, “Yeah.”
Bobby also filled Dean in on why he was all the way in Indiana. He’d moved to Sioux Falls when his wife got sick so she could be near family. The cemetery was nearby a property for sale so he’d moved there permanently. He’d lost his legs a year later after he’d tried to fight off robbers who’d broken into the yard. After exchanging stories, Bobby had asked Dean to come back with him to the salvage yard. He happened to have been keeping John’s old Peterbilt and Impala, and he offered them to Dean as a gift. Dean spent the rest of his time at Bobby’s before he had to return to service, the old man teaching him all he could about mechanics. Their friendship blossomed from there.
Castiel's breath trembled against Dean’s fingers and he finally relaxed into Dean, sighing, “Okay. That’s all that matters.”
Cas storms out of the room, leaving Jack and Dean alone. The kid won’t stop staring at Dean, which makes him squirm as he sends an awkward smile to the person he’d been mindlessly shouting at not even ten minutes ago.
Dean’s words echoed in Castiel’s head. The atmosphere had become tremendously somber. Castiel felt relaxed as he took a deep breath and dared for a tease: “So that’s why you’re not proficient in history?”
He takes a deep breath and looks out into the night again, contemplating throwing his phone as far as he can.
“Shut up,” Cas growls against Dean’s skin. He grabs onto his shirt, manhandling Dean back and then over, flipping their positions.
“Oh,” Cas says, feet fidgeting with a flight response. He huffs out with no trace of friendliness, “Crazy. Well, good to see you again. Safe travels.”
“Please don’t talk like that,” Cas’s heart aches, although his cock reacts to the words and brushes against Dean’s thigh.
Cas approaches casually and asks as if Dean is any other patron in the early morning: “Coffee?”
Dean’s face went red with embarrassment - dick still fairly hard - covering his face with one of his hands as he groaned, “Come on, you can’t blame me.”
He felt Dean shiver against him as he admitted: “I don’t know what to do. I feel different about you and I don’t know what to do about it.”
Castiel takes a deep breath.
. Nonetheless, he uses his larger buttplug and blushes to himself.
“Drink some water. Or rinse your hands, I guess,” Dean suggested. Castiel wordlessly took it from Dean and drank from it before splashing some over his bloody fingers and palms. He heard Dean rifling through his backpack. Castiel set the canteen aside and Dean handed him next a bag of frozen peas. Castiel hesitated in taking this item, eyeing Dean from the side.
“It’s not like that either,” Dean is more heated now too, “Like I said, it’s no big deal.”
Cas glances at Dean in shock, and then with gratitude. He bites his lip and finishes his drink; Dean follows suit. Dean finds Cas’s eyes again and he looks concerned once more. Before Dean can ask him, Cas says, “So... Can you please just tell me what happened to you?”
“Of course,” Castiel replied, “Are you cold?”
“It’s alright,” Cas says with a sigh, turning away from his duties and wiping his hands on a rag at his apron waist as he pushes through the door with a furrowed brow, Jack following. For a second there Jack had Cas thinking someone was choking or something. Although an unhappy customer is never fun.
Cas’s thumbs come to life and righteously types out a block of text that furiously reprimands Dean for not answering, not calling back, for leaving him, for-
Castiel didn’t seem to be listening anymore, eyes drooped half closed as he stared at Dean’s lips. Dean blushed and exhaled nervously at Castiel's silence. The boy moved back into Dean’s space, capturing his lips as his thumbs dug between Dean’s shirt and waistband to press into his skin.
“Well, he’s a trucker-”
Castiel made his way to his locker in the hall. He was about to change his books for the day and go have lunch on the field by himself. But first he was supposed to meet Anna. She had promised to meet him here around this time so he could return her essay.
Dean might as well tell him, so he dives in, “My mom died in a house fire when I was four and my brother was a baby.”
Dean moans start to sound like screams, his heels digging into the mattress wildly. Cas moves his other hand to hold Dean’s thigh in front of him. With the extra stability, Cas starts rocking his ass on Dean’s cock.
“Dean,” Anna’s voice was sudden, but much cheerier than before, “Are you hungry? Do you want a plate?”
“Dean, please take it easy,” Castiel chastised as if he wasn’t the one making him this way.
“Indoor pool, bee-atch!” Ash yelled, “The whole team is there and- oh. Is he dead?”
“Dean?” Castiel asked quietly.
Cas’s blush intensifies… He doesn’t know where Dean is going with this; might even call him out. But Dean’s voice is setting his nerves alight, so he has no other option than the truth, “Y-yeah…”
Castiel dried his hands and began heating another pan on the stove to finish the vegetables. He turned to his sister with a remorseful eye, “I’m sorry, Anna. You’re on your own this time.”
The door closed and Dean was left alone. He immediately began freaking out. No longer under the spell of Castiel’s presence, the situation crashed down on him as if his soul had returned to his body.
Dean collapses onto Castiel. A moment of silence falls over the two bodies; more like a moment of stillness, the only noise or movement from them is that they breathe at the same tempo and weight as the other. They’re bodies are synchronised, but Cas can feel Dean softening inside of him. Soon, Dean swallows his breath and grunts as he pulls out of Cas.
Dean pushes up and moves his body over Cas’s. Cas opens his legs and wraps them around Dean’s waist, feeling the blankets slip over his thighs. Dean’s tongue licks into Cas’s mouth, his hand coming up to grip Cas’s throat above his adam’s apple.
“What was your address again?” Dean asked loudly.
“What makes you say that?”
“I said don’t move,” Castiel warned, looking over to Dean seriously. Dean laid back down obediently. Castiel continued out the door, saying, “I’ll be right back.”
“Go.”
Dean hummed as a response, too swept away in the blissful massage to fight back. The TV clicked on and Dean heard Drex sigh as the other bed beside him rustled. Castiel’s therapeutic massage was successfully holding back the panic Dean had been feeling; it was also good that Drex was in the room as an easy buffer.
An overwhelming fuel of confidence rolls over Cas. He moves his face closer, so much so that he can see the lust fill in Dean’s enlarged pupils as his eyes roam over Cas’s face. He snarls essentially against Dean’s lips, “For the same reason you came.”
Jo had insisted on walking him back, even though she had a long walk away herself and it was late. She tried to flirt with him, but that only served to remind Dean of Castiel and their walk back to his house the night before the Halloween party. It was safe to say that Dean had been almost even more drunk than Jo, his mind completely absorbed in thinking of that tan, lean frame and sharp features. He had ended up walking Jo home instead and then making the journey back to the boys’ house. He rinsed off in Ash’s part of the house before finally flopping into bed with exhaustion. His racing mind had eventually drowned him to sleep.
“So… You’re not mad at me?” Dean whispers in a deep, rumbling tone.
“Jack,” Cas’s voice is gentle, “Are you that nervous?”
Dean thrusts poignantly and Cas moans loudly.
Just as Dean was getting adjusted to Castiel’s temperature, he took it away to mutter, “Dean, uh, will you follow me?”
Dean’s hands snap to Cas’s hips as he moans loudly. Dean’s voice fuels Cas as he pushes down further. But instead of working him in steadily, Cas wants to feel filled by Dean as soon as possible, so he pushes down until he’s fully seated on Dean.
“Nnn! I’m dirty for you Dean!” Cas moans, letting his head be pulled back from Dean’s grip, “I want to feel your cum in me!”
Dean chuckled, “You’ll see.”
Jack nods excitedly. Cas knows that Jack will do all of that, and would have anyway without him saying so. He sighs; he can’t help worrying still.
Jack shakes his head and eats. He turns back to Dean, “Do you?”
Bus fare is getting expensive, or maybe Dean is just really starting to feel the emptying weight of his bank account. The ride had been uncomfortable - he still couldn’t get the smell of baby vomit off him, no matter how many sani wipes the mother had offered him. Anyway, he finally managed to make his way to Indiana. If anything, the journey has reminded him how much life blows when he doesn’t have his own set of wheels. And at least the rain has stopped and the clouds are beginning to clear as the day winds down.
Dean tries to rein in his emotion, “No. I’m, uh, going to see Cas right now, actually.”
Dean can feel himself filling Cas inside, and he hopes Cas can too. They rut together for a moment in shared post-cum glory. The shower water has run cold. Dean won’t stop kissing Cas, doesn’t know if he can. Cas’s saliva tastes spiked.
Dean’s hands fell away as he got up on his knees. Castiel awed as Dean reached over his head and tugged off his henley shirt, exposing his own tanned, youthfully muscular chest.
“Yeah. Was thinking maybe you’d want to help us set up?” Dean asked. Castiel looked over and caught Dean smiling at him expectantly. Castiel quickly looked away; he’d never been to a party, didn’t even know what to expect. But he didn’t want to let Dean down either.
Anna met Castiel right outside his class door to ambush him. He couldn’t get a word in before the ghostly look on her face stopped him. She was pale as she choked out: “Quiz.”
“Can I please sleep now?” Dean asked.
“Stow it, idjit. Y’all ain’t out of the fire yet until we find them key-”
Cas reads those eyes and has to push the air in and out of him. He blinks, looking away as he says as cool as possible while blushing, “You didn’t mean anything to me.”
“Let go,” Cas whips around in Dean’s arms to face him, trying to push him off. Dean stares at him resolutely, just pulling Cas closer more each time Cas attempts to get away. Dean buries his face into the crook of Cas’s neck and holds tight. Cas huffs defeatedly and just lies there in Dean’s arms.
Just then, as Cas is pouring a mug of coffee for a trucker at the bar, she pats him roughly on the back and giggles as he almost spills the coffee, “Ah, thanks for letting me off tonight, Cas! I will definitely try to come in early tomorrow.”
Castiel sighed and supplied: “The student council president, yes.”
“Yeah, it’s just…” Dean started and then stopped. He bit his lip and looked at nothing but the sky. He chuckled before continuing, “Ah, I’m not good at this stuff, dude.”
Just like plugging his dead phone in to charge, Dean nearly immediately falls onto Cas’s couch and rests. There’s a lot to think about - too much. The typhoon of emotions is like a white noise in the back of his head, numbingly drowning him into slumber.
“What?” Cas asks with a straight face.
“I don’t think so,” Dean got in between Asmod and Castiel, still being held by Ash and Al. Castiel could feel Ash shaking beside him, though.
“Is that how it’s gonna be?” Dean asked after a beat of silence.
“Dude. No, c’mon,” Ash gave a skeptical brow, “We’re way more fun than them! And, hey, look-”
Dean’s head shook, “Dammit, Cas, I don’t want to make you cry.”
Cas struggles but manages to do it, not knowing why he’s listening to Dean so simply. But there they are, eyes locked, and both moaning. Dean smirks, “You want to cum at the same time?”
The last thing Dean had asked Cas last night was if he remembered the embankment. But how could Cas forget? At one point, he had wanted to stay there forever with Dean. Cas’s heart panged, feeling like Dean hadn’t felt the same way. But he had asked, and now that lush green hill and bright blue water is the only thing Cas can think about.
Castiel’s eyes found the ground, his worry still not subsided. He shrugged, “Yeah, sure.”
“Dean,” Naomi greeted coldly, “We weren’t expecting you tonight. Did you come here from the school?”
Dean takes a deep breath, pulling the two fingers out but catching Cas’s spasming asshole with his thumb and tugging. He hears Dean huff, “Shit… Okay, okay.”
“Unfair!” Samandriel mimicked.
Cas nods, “Are you sure you’re not hungry?”
Castiel seemed more than fine with kissing instead. They pushed up against each other and Dean held him tight as Castiel shuddered against his chest. The light dimmed again, washing them in deep darkness as crickets screamed nearby. Castiel had even ventured to push his tongue into Dean’s mouth, which Dean licked and sucked carelessly.
Dean nods sleepily, “Alright.”
Castiel pulled him in closer, “Shh! Keep your voice down. It is nearly four in the morning.”
Cas is lost, mind only filled with Dean just as all he can see is Dean’s eyes. He moans unabashedly.
Al shook his head, getting back to his feet, “Thought you were cooler than all this, Dean.”
“Dean!” Ash called in shock. Even Castiel was surprised to see him.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
He’d helped Castiel redress as he did the same, attempting to wipe away the mess of Castiel’s semen. Dean thought he’d successfully subdued a shaking Castiel by kissing him while doing all this. God, kissing Castiel was so good. He’d fooled around with a few girls by then, but none of their mouths or skin had made him cum in front of them. Castiel had that power though, and kissing him sober was a lot more enjoyable than his fuck up that one drunken night that later had sent him into a mental tailspin.
“Then what is it?” Dean’s voice cut through the night.
Dean’s sorry too. He closes his eyes and tries not to hate himself too much. But the hate leads Dean to slip and share with Cas something deeply painful he’d been holding in: “That was my dad’s rig, too, y’know? He didn’t put a scratch on it for twenty years - I have it half the time and total the thing...”
“Hm, yeah?” Dean’s hands roam up and down Cas’s back, “Like what?”
“Ow!” Dean yelped out at the startling pain that shot through his face.
Dean shrugs, still not able to look at Cas. Cas doesn’t reply right away, so Dean just presses on: “If it’ll cheer him up, or something. Just offering…”
“Then I’m your boyfriend,” Dean gently kissed Castiel’s eyelid as it slipped shut, “And you’re my boyfriend. We know that. That’s all that matters.”
Dean’s good arm is feeling all up and down the slick skin of Cas’s back and ass, his other sprained arm resting on Cas’s hip. Their hard cocks are trapped between their bodies as they rut together wantingly, moaning into one another’s mouths.
“What’s your problem tonight?”
Cas blushes, “Why didn’t you let me know you were coming?”
Dean seems to effortlessly maintain eye contact and lets Cas hold him, but he doesn’t respond yet.
Cas trembles, “I… I have to finish closing.”
“To be fair, you do seem slightly more inebriated than me,” Castiel observed.
Castiel nodded, resolving that he’d leave his re-entrance into his house for later. Castiel looked over to Dean who was smiling and looking out over the parking lot. They passed under a lamp and Dean observed aloud, “Doesn’t the school look way different at night?”
Cas's breaths are shallow but heavy in light of Dean’s silence. He looks at the smooth, muscular skin of Cas’s contorted shoulder. Dean wonders numbly how Cas can stay so tan. Sweetly, gently, he kisses that spot. Cas hums, relaxing around him again and tries to push back once more.
Dean is right there in front of him, filling Cas’s vision. He can feel him moving inside of him, catching the waves of pleasure to pool in his pelvis. Dean picks up the pace.
“We just had to read it, Dean, no need to be dramatic,” Castiel chastised, but couldn’t resist smiling over to his friend.
Dean let out a heavy sigh of relief that he masked as being disgruntled as he whispered, “What are you doing?”
The familiar face shakes his head a little, a smile fighting to fit on his lips. Cas resists the temptation to search that face - so much older, yet still so tan and features so defined, even with a heavy scruff that he sports - and keeps his eyes level. A surprised huff of laughter falls out of his lips as he says, “It’s me, Dean. Dean Winchester.”
Although it was cold as fuck, Dean felt heat rise in his pelvis thinking that Castiel had been finding the best place to do something with Dean - it had always felt like he’d been the one chasing Castiel. It was odd for Dean to remember that Castiel had been aware of his queerness for longer than Dean. Dean’s mouth felt as muddled as his mind as heat built up in his pelvis, “Well, what is it?”
But there’s no time to think of that; the road turns suddenly at a decline and the load sways on his bed against a gust of harsh wind. Dean is able to straighten out, but he has to be careful about maneuvering the eighteen wheels under his seat that is zooming at 55 miles per hour - he’s not on the gas. There’s no place he can park to wait it out except in the middle of the road. He considers doing just that as Dean notices through his muddled big brights that the next bit is a windy part, and the heavy load sways again as the rain starts to pound harder.
They all laugh at Dean’s expense, but a heavy cloud has started to hang over Dean that dampens him joining in the joy.
“But, I-”
Castiel walked past Dean and the trees to carefully tread on to the partially shaded grass. Dean walked behind him, setting down Castiel’s bag next to his feet.
“Thanks again for the grub,” Dean took a breath, “You’re a good cook.”
Dean relinquished with a short sigh and folded his arms as he was cornered. He tried to grit and bear it, but Dean hit his limit when Drex’s feet touched his bare foot.
“Dr-Drex was th-the one who was say-saying C-Cas sh-should be captain,” Jervis said.
Jo and Castiel followed Dean to a door Castiel hadn’t noticed at first that had a wooden sign hung on the front. The handmade sign read in messy black paint: “DR. BADASS IS” And then a smaller sign underneath hung with a tiny chain that said, “IN”.
“Ah, Dean-”
Dean gasps, but Cas quickly covers his mouth with his own. Dean breathes deeply through his nose as he grabs at Cas’s back and ass. Cas moves up into him, his own hands going to pet and grab at Dean’s short hair.
Castiel sighed, “That’s it. I’m taking you ba-”
Then he felt the boy’s hand against his that was holding the wipe, “You’re not even getting it! Let me.”
“Oh? That’s all?” Dean thrusts as hard as he can with a grunt. Cas gasps and moans, the thrust knocking him off his hands and on to his elbows.
In his need to escape, Cas walks right out of the kitchen doors that are near the edge of the bar, having a solid plan to bee-line to the back office in the opposite direction.
Castiel’s brow furrowed at his books. Anna was getting mad, “What? Am I not allowed to talk to people now?”
Castiel merely cocked his brow. Dean sighed in submission and slowly rolled over so his aching back wasn’t on the terrible mattress, arms folded under his head.
With less than full surety, he types out: “
She sat back with a shit-eating grin and said mockingly, “I’ll go ahead and get your beer ready.”
“Who are you?” is the only thing Dean’s able to choke out.
Castiel’s hand gently pushed back on Dean’s shoulder, slowly laying him back down on the pillow, “I’m convinced you can’t relax on your own.”
“It’s okay, I want to,” Dean chuckled, taking out a small sewing kit. He threaded a needle with precision and Castiel was too mesmerized by Dean’s sweeping movements to protest further. Dean unzipped Castiel’s backpack, carefully taking out the contents and felt down at the corner to pull the needle through. Dean asked conversationally, “So you have other siblings?”
Cas’s heart pangs as he catches Benny’s endeared smile, sonorous voice answering, “That’d be the polite thing to do.”
“A lot, I suppose… Asmod hates you now and it’s all because of me,” Castiel’s face contorted, “That’s why you shouldn’t have helped… Nobody will like you if you’re with me.”
Dean nearly chokes.
Dean could hear Ash stomping around the room.
“I want to see you again,” Dean persists.
Inside the dark gym, Castiel had said between their sloppy union that he had to go home, so Dean had gathered his things for them while the other boy got some air. But when he met Castiel outside, the moon broke through some clouds and briefly illuminated Castiel. Dean had glanced at his face, seeing that Castiel was about to say something. Dean freaked. He had started kissing Castiel again, because he didn’t have any answers for him, and didn't know how to leave off a night like this. He could have easily gone home with Castiel, since a fake situation could have been explained away to their guardians. But Dean was young and still slow on the uptake; all he did know was that he wanted to kiss Castiel and didn’t want to talk about what had just happened.
“Wait. It’s animated?” Jack is on the edge, even though he’s been sitting on the floor.
Cas gets lost in a memory of him getting very scared of losing Jack when he was very little. Jack had straight walked out of the home and down the street. Jack hadn’t realized what he’d done, only that he was pretending to be a wizard and he needed ingredients for potions.
“Okay,” Castiel choked out.
Cas is finding it more difficult by the second to keep quiet, to hide how much he enjoys feeling Dean’s mouth wrapped around him. He even exhales with gratitude when Dean pulls off his head.
“It was fine. We got our history test back, though, and I got a B.”
different, and Dean just couldn’t bear to sleep with him - no matter how much he really wanted to.
“Sure,” Dean replies, following.
“It’s okay,” Castiel repeated, not caring how he felt about it as long as it would make Dean feel better.
Dean’s body ended up aching even from his teammates' pats on the back. The caravan drive back to the hotel was torture. Just to stumble down the hotel’s long hallway took the rest of Dean’s might. He tore off his jacket as he blindly opened the door to their room. He collapsed face first on the nearest flat surface and felt himself immediately drift into sweet sleep.
“That’s the joke! Gah,” Cas laughs. The laughter really does sail Dean to sleep this time - the best sound in the world.
“Fuck dude,
Dean was so preoccupied watching Castiel’s back muscles ripple while he moved his arms that it nearly startled him when Drex let out a groan of pleasure, “Damn, dude, you got that Midas touch!”
“Dean?”
Castiel looked back up to catch Dean’s soft smile, “I thought we could walk to practice together.”
Cas tries to keep his cool as his wavering voice stutters out, “Just hurry up.”
“Another friend is joining you?” Jody butts in.
He heard Dean’s voice over the other chatter of the passing students in the hall. There was a friendly tone in it, and it made Castiel highly suspicious. Still, he fiddled around in his locker. Then, the voices disappeared in the crowd. He felt a tap on his shoulder. Castiel turned to Anna - she was alone.
Jack blinks but nods solemnly. His lips turn slightly as he blushes and asks, “Oh, um… Could I maybe take the truck tonight please?”
Dean’s tongue slid away and Castiel groaned in protest. Dean’s hand pushed at Castiel’s hair above his brow, making him open his eyes. A beam of moonlight must have broken through the clouds because there was a pale glow that had dimly illuminated the gym through the windows.
Castiel took the opportunity to finish divvying out the rest of the food, back turned to all. He’d gone ahead and made another plate for Dean; he wasn’t sure why, but he’d already done it.
“Earlier th-
It’s because it was with Dean.
Castiel replied to the window, “Constantinople.”
“Calls?”
“Well don’t just stand there like some idjit. Come in, come in!” Bobby rolls back, allowing Dean to pass him into the house before closing the door behind him.
“And it only took you being a total asshole and three extra questions,” Jo rolled her eyes.
“Then you’ll fall into a ditch. I don’t know,” Castiel said, refusing to let up, “Something bad will happen to you.”
Cas bites his lip before catching Dean staring at him. Cas quickly averts his eyes and stifles a sigh. Dean feels bad for him, even though he can’t imagine what it’s like to be the father of a teenage boy on the cusp of beginning life.
“You remind me of someone,” Dean said, “My little brother, Sammy. Not like I think of you as a brother, it’s just… he had these guys on his back all the time at school. It was really hard for him for a while.”
“Oh, goddammit, Cas!” Dean shouts, “Shit, baby, you feel so good. How can anyone feel this good?”
Dean befriending Castiel had made high school a lot more bearable; namely that there were no more bullies to avoid. But another reason Asmod and his gang weren’t tormenting Castiel anymore was that Ash had stopped hanging out with them. Instead, he and Dean had become good friends. The idea had never sat right in Castiel’s gut, but he’d never expressed this to Dean.
“Yeah, this is a heavily trafficked road, you know,” Dean chuckled as they lay in the middle of the lane.
“Yes, please,” Jack says excitedly, “May I have some coffee?”
Cas doesn’t dare cough, no matter how surprised he is at the sudden, rough throat fucking. All he can do is hold on to Dean’s strong legs, squeeze his eyes closed and keep his throat open as drool runs down over his lower lip. Dean grunts above him, and Cas moans around the girth filling his mouth. Dean begins to pant at that, hips stuttering.
Castiel didn’t know what to say. He didn’t want to apologize, because he couldn’t excuse Lucifer’s behavior. But at the same time he was embarrassed. He never wanted Dean to see this side of his life. A sudden pang of worry shot through his heart as he turned back to Dean, wondering if this would push him away even farther.
“Hey! Get out of here! You want detention too?” Mr. Wyatt warned.
“You going to do something about it?” Cas’s rough voice tempts.
Dean hates that he smokes. His mind decides to punish him further by asking what Cas would think if he knew Dean smokes.
Castiel didn’t hear his reply, hurrying to enter the gym. He stood in the back of the rest of the team that was nearer the mats.
Dean doesn’t know how to put his sentiments lightly, but Cas seems to understand anyway. He kisses Dean’s wet earlobe, saying, “I don’t care.”
Then, as Cas was saying goodnight to Jack and about to walk home, a thought struck him to his core: what if Dean didn’t show up.
He looks back at where he had just been next to Dean. He hadn’t realized while they were having sex that they had somehow moved so their heads were at the foot of the bed. He catches Dean’s eyes, staring at him with an unreadable emotion. Cas quickly looks away and stumbles out of the bedroom door.
Dean bites his lip and holds Cas’s eyes. He chuckles and looks down at his coffee, “Alright, you got me. I didn’t come here for a meal… Although, I really did dig that burger from last time.”
Thunder rumbles through the sky to punctuate Cas's statement. Dean feels Cas fidget beside him before he continues, “You sure you’ll be alright on the road?”
Castiel’s refuge was his room; tidy and neat, everything had a place. After taking a shower, he mostly did his homework at his small desk, but he always finished too quickly. Then, he read his library book from that week.
Benny throws her an impatient look, “Is that a problem?”
Ash skipped over, hooking his arm around Castiel’s neck, coaxing, “Cas! Bunk up with the buds!” He laughed, ignorant and carefree. Dean dared to glance at Castiel, whose eyes were firmly planted on the dingy carpeted floor.
“Ah,” Cas moans, “You’re repulsive.”
That pulled a small smile out of Castiel before the boy below him redirected his attention to Dean’s groin. Meanwhile, Dean was doing his best to just stand up straight. He was glad that this tree was behind him, otherwise he’d tumble over at the next passing breeze.
“Aah, Dean!” Cas’s hands clench into fists as he hangs his head, panting in want. Dammit, he’s close to cumming again.
“Some,” Dean admits after swallowing past the lump of food that had gotten stuck.
Dean has to restrain himself from just jumping up, instead trying to be inconspicuous. He gets out from under Cas to investigate, working past the pain in his aching joints. A small clatter comes from the kitchen, grabbing Dean’s attention and making his heart pound. He’s sure this is Luci, breaking in to do his sick psychopathic stuff. Dean peeks over the couch.
“Hm, interesting outlook,” Coach Singer said with a knowing smile. He turned towards the other team, “Castiel. Why don’t you bottom?”
Dean’s voice is serious: “You want it?”
“Sorry about him,” Anna said as Samandriel struggled in her arms, “He’s usually not like this.”
Dean heard footsteps approach the bed and he tried to wriggle away without turning over to face him, “I’m feeling better, really. Great job, Drex. I’m just going to lie here and-”
The last bell rang and Castiel returned to the locker rooms. Nobody on the wrestling team talked to him, but they didn’t make fun of him either. The third member of his tormentor’s, Ash, was on the team though. Although he didn’t actively instigate Castiel while alone, he was known around the school as being the town gossip.
Naomi walked past Dean to make Samandriel’s plate. Castiel was staring at Dean, but Dean’s eyes were following Naomi. Castiel watched Dean swallow and reply defensively, “Yeah, so?”
Cas huffs in agreement, seeming to cool down slightly after the outburst. Dean feels like he’s getting a lot out of Cas, so he digs a little deeper, “And I guess it’s not safe for Jack to stay with your baby mama, or whatever?”
“I’ll be right back,” Anna said after she set her plate down too, hopping back up and walking out.
“Can I see you again?”
But as they started up the dirt drive to the front of Sonny’s, Dean shushed them and grabbed Castiel’s wrist. He pulled them off the road and off to the side. They quietly walked around the back of the house to a smaller, secondary unit connected to the main house by a screened-in walkway.
There’s no more responses, and Dean checks his phone: dead.
Castiel gulped past a gluey saliva, teeth chattering as if he had the chills, “I’ve… I’ve never done anything like this before.”
“Alright then,” Dean said, “See you tomorrow, Cas.”
Castiel smiled and Dean smiled back.
“Yeah, I can feel me inside you,” Dean moans, his hips giving a significant push upwards into the space his palm presses on.
The team exploded in triumph. Not only had they excelled in State and won a trophy for the school - which would be awarded to them at the end of the tournament the next day - but they wouldn’t have to compete in the third and fourth sessions. So tomorrow was just schmoozing college reps (for kids who cared about that stuff, like Castiel) and relaxing - which Dean desperately needed. His performance had come at a hefty price.
Cas wriggles in excitement as he feels Dean’s cock get hooked down between his thigh and perineum, his cock head twitching at his rim.
“Not so fast,” Al hissed, kicking Castiel’s shoulder with his foot. Castiel’s back hit the chain link fence that he had been sitting nearby.
Dean buries his eye sockets into his palms until it’s painful, but he manages to regain his breath. He’s sporting a mean headache and his muscles feel as if he hasn’t rested at all. Dean’s reminded of the sensation of falling into the void as he hides behind the black of his eyelids.
“I didn’t know you served-”
Jo smiled and turned to Castiel expectantly. Castiel came to life and said, “Crowding.”
Asmod, Al, and Ash walked up to him.
Castiel unfolded one of the towels on the bed and poured ice cubes on it. He put another towel on top, explaining, “We don’t have ice packs, so…”
Cas moves past Dean and puts his hands on the wall. Dean moves in behind him, his chest against Cas’s back, hands tugging down Cas’s pants and briefs. Cas feels Dean press his head against the crook of his neck, heavy breath tickling down his shirt collar. Dean ruts his hard, spit slicked cock between the top of his ass to the small of his back. The action feels so lewd his cock twitches in anticipation.
“Here they are,” Castiel hurried back breathlessly.
“I bolted the door. Besides,” Castiel said bluntly, “I don’t think I can stop feeling this way.”
Dean pulled away Castiel’s hand that was rubbing at his eye with the blood dripping in it. Castiel’s eyes follow Dean’s tongue as it snuck out to lick at his thumb. Castiel was surprised when that thumb landed above his own eyelid, wiping back some of the blood dripping there.
“I don’t know, you’re acting,” Dean’s mouth twisted, “Weird.”
Dean doesn’t seem to need any more incentive. Dean leans forward over and slowly pushes fully into Cas. It burns somewhat, but Cas couldn’t care less. Really, he wants more, faster. He’s been so hard for so long, getting off on tasting Dean. But now he wants to feel him too, get filled by him - pummeled.
“Me neither,” Dean replied with too much confidence.
“Y-y-you st-stayed after again?” Jervis asked.
“Ready for tomorrow?” Raul gave Castiel’s shoulder a joshing punch.
He hasn’t even finished fully knocking before Bobby throws it open, “Ah, boy! Is that really you?”
“Well,” Castiel tried to save face, “You have only been here a week.”
“So, Asstiel,” Asmod said to him as if talking to a child, “You’re going to write the essay before Monday, right?”
Cas and Dean both laugh at that. Cas smiles, “Good one.”
“If I can ask you questions,” Jack retorts.
“Oh, Cas!” Dean cries in response. He buries his cock to the hilt inside of Cas.
“You just took two shots,” Dean said, “You’re not even feeling tipsy?”
Cas doesn’t have the strength to reprimand Dean this time. Instead, the old pet name rips a painful moan out of the depths of Cas’s heart. He closes his eyes, not being able to bear the pain. Dean presses his forehead against Cas’s, whispering, “Open your eyes.”
“Let’s go for a round, alright?” Coach Singer said, backing up. Both boys nodded. Coach Singer blew his whistle and the boys collided. Dean got the upper hand, throwing Ash down. He pinned his shoulders and moved over Ash to keep down his scrambling legs.
Dean shrugged and wiped a tear from his eye, “Eh, maybe a little of both.”
Jack pouts and snags his bowl of half eaten cereal, munching on it as he carries it to the bathroom. Cas hasn’t stopped glaring at Dean since he entered, and hardly waits for Jack to exit until he spits out, “What in the actual fuck are you doing here?”
“No,” Dean said. Castiel’s eye leapt to his face. Dean was in front of the canopy overhead, his brow furrowed in concentration as he continued to deftly nurse Castiel’s wound.
He doesn’t dare check his phone until after close, after dinner with Jack, on his walk home. There’s a message from Dean’s number and Cas stops in his tracks. He feverishly gets to his messages and reads: “
Castiel’s consciousness snapped back and rushed over to the sizzling chicken on the stove, going to throw it in the oven to finish.
It rings… Rings… “
“Dean,” Castiel warned, smacking him playfully on the shoulder. He had really given him a fright.
Anna scoffed, “Oh, you did?”
Cas shivers, “I don’t like what you do to me…”
He sniffed harshly and looked at all the faces, “Dean, Cas and Jo. Jo, Cas and Dean.”
Luci pretended like he’s about to hit Castiel. The boy flinched. Luci laughed and pushed at Castiel’s head with his hand, “And you should stop being such a little bitch!”
Dean ferociously struggled for a moment, but Castiel held him down. There was a moment of physical calm as they both caught their breath in heavy, stinging huffs.
Dean can’t help but chuckle at the sad truth, “Yep, pretty much.”
A cup of coffee is simple enough, but he prays that the man orders something else, especially if he’s planning on sticking around. He has plenty of other customers that would like a dry place, table, and food. He’s pouring the coffee quickly and glances back up to see the man getting Jack’s attention. They exchange a few words and Jack comes back around the counter.
The bed’s headboard rhythmically bangs against Cas’s apartment wall.
A beat of silence.
“Name’s Dean Winchester,” he replies for himself.
Cas opens his eyes finally and is relieved that his sight has returned. He looks over his trembling shoulder to Dean, who’s lying with his eyes closed. Cas trepidatiously lowers himself onto the bed, laying on his stomach and burying his face into the crook of his arm, facing away from Dean.
Castiel bit his lip, not expecting the relief that swept through him. To take them off track, Castiel observed, “You are in a sophomore class.”
Castiel wriggled uncomfortably and crossed his arms. His eyes trailed off… Drinking alcohol, possibly getting drunk, with Dean and Ash. Hanging out. It was a lot to process. And even getting there… He’d have to walk in the dark. And he’d never even thought about a curfew before.
“No, I’m fine!” Dean yelled way too loud.
Castiel went to the side of the gym and turned off the lights. The gym was thrown into a deep darkness, and Castiel looked up through the windows. The moon slipped in and out of view through the thicket of moving clouds.
“Really? And he was on a wrestling team?” Jack is distant. Dean looks at him, struck that Cas had never told him that. Jack rests his head on his hand somberly, answering Dean like he read his mind, “He doesn’t talk about school much… When he does he just says he hated it.”
Cas doesn’t say anything, but makes sure to slam the door closed and throws the lock into place wordlessly.
Dean’s brow furrowed, about to get up when his peripheral caught the movement of a shadow. His breath became shallow as he peeked over to the source next to the window. He immediately recognized Castiel’s silhouette.
Still, his nerves refuse to settle.
Al shoved the new kid, Dean, forward from the back of the gang. Dean stumbled forward until he was standing right over Castiel. Castiel looked at Dean’s clenched fist at his side, and then up to those wide, green eyes.
Castiel’s brow cocked, “I thought it was more fun not to care?”
Dean’s hand grabs on tightly to Cas’s cock and strokes the length of him. Cas’s back arches but Dean’s cock pulls away and he’s bending over his waist. Then an entirely other sensation, Dean sucking Cas’s cockhead into his mouth.
Coach Singer instructed Castiel to get on bottom and Dean on top; the whistle blew and as Castiel switched Coach Singer blew the whistle. He came over and told Dean about what Castiel was doing and how the maneuver was accomplished. As he talked about where the hand would land, Castiel instinctually helped by putting his hand on Dean as Coach Singer went through the explanation.
Dean tackled Castiel, but he was obviously expecting it and was able to slide his feet under Dean’s and flip him. They rolled down the hill for a few yards, laughing and yelping as they fought to pin the other one to the ground like two puppies playing.
Despite all the drama and heavy subject matter, Dean figures that their interaction has been pretty therapeutic. He offers a small smile as Cas looks back at him, “I’m glad.”
Castiel looked at his sister for a moment before looking back down at her chemistry homework. He thought about Dean - a junior like himself - being in sophomore chemistry class. He wondered if these rumors were true, but shook himself off that thought. Instead he blinked at the assignment at hand and merely said to Anna, “It’s only a rumor. Anyway, you should just worry about yourself.”
Castiel heard and felt Dean’s movements pause. Castiel gulped and continued, “And I’m sorry.”
Dean walked around so he could face Castiel, the boy completely illuminated by the moon while facing this way. But mostly, Dean was suddenly filled with worry and doubt, fueled by their conversation the night prior. He asked, “You’re not crying again, are you?”
Another deep breath and Cas opens back up his phone to his messenger. He furiously wonders why Dean isn’t answering him. He thinks that he’s done something wrong, pushed a little too hard. And then he questions why he’s even trying; he didn’t even want Dean back in his life in the first place, so how could he make such an impact on Cas’s mind…
Luci ignored Castiel, Samandriel, and Dean, focused on the kitchen as he hissed, “When the hell is food gonna be ready?”
He flicks the ash off and inhales again. He looks at the cigarette between his fingers, burning bright in the deep, dark early morning.
Cas’s hand comes up, his knuckles stroking against Dean’s sharp cheekbone. He sees Dean leaning into his touch, his eyes drooping close, and Cas pulls away, “You shaved.”
Dean suddenly gets the inkling that maybe he
Dean moaned against Castiel’s skin, teeth bumping up against his neck during the thrust. Dean beared down.
“Well, hello! Merry Christmas to you this fine night, Castiel,” Met’s voice cuts through the still night. Cas looks over. Met is at his own door next to Cas’s, dressed in shabby clothes and with an armful of bags.
“Cas-”
Dean could almost laugh, “I get complicated.”
“I want to taste you,” Dean says, his tongue flattening at the underside of Cas's cock. Cas loses his breath and presses his head against the mattress behind him with a choked groan. Dean continues, “You said I forgot a lot, so let me remember.”
Jack’s eyes lit up, “So you understand. You… Miss her too?”
Castiel shivered from embarrassment, looking to the side, searching for meaning to why he was so anxious, “We’re at the school…”
“What about your dad? Or your step-mom?” Dean asked.
Cas is writing on a notepad on the kitchen counter when Dean enters. He smiles at Cas, but the man just clears his throat and moves to put the pen away, “You’re up.”
Castiel cleared the space between them and lightly pressed his lips against Dean’s again. Dean hummed and pressed back. Castiel’s heart wasn’t working properly, but still he felt like all was right. Kissing Dean was better than anything he ever experienced before.
Cas nods and another silence falls. He wonders if this was really all there was to be asked from the man. Cas feels like his time was purposely sabotaged and he can’t wait until this guy becomes the motel caretaker’s problem and not his.
Ash tugged on Dean’s upper arm to his own surprise, continuing, “Dean’s with us!”
“Cas, buddy, you live like two minutes away,” Bart reassures. Cas sucks in his breath. He had been trying to help Jack’s anxiety, but maybe it was himself that needed the help. Another thing to worry about, Cas supposes. Bart continues, “We got it. Go take a breather. Everything will be here by the time you get back.”
He hits the call button and sucks in a breath as he brings the phone to his ear.
Dean chuckles from behind him, his other hand moving from Cas’s shoulder to the plug’s bottom. He starts pulling, and Cas breathes in and out to relax. The ridge is the toughest part, and then his rim slides over the rest, although gaping somewhat at the end. Dean snarls in lust and Cas here’s the plug falling to the floor before a harsh spit and feels it land near his rim. His nerves light up as Dean’s fingers rub into him before he feels the round cock head pressing against him in turn. Cas moans, and Dean asks, “You ready, then?”
“Nah, perfect- ah!” Drex howled, “Mhm, that’s definitely a knot!”
“I don’t know, that she’s liked me for a while? Ha, I think she was ready to head to the janitor’s closet or something,” Dean chuckled.
Castiel’s eyes shot back up to Dean as he spit out, “Busy with Amanda?”
“Oh, shit, Dean,” Ash said through his laughter, “You were right, he
Their matches were numerous and furious. There was a rhythm to their fight, an anticipation built on moves and tactics that he would counter. A flow built through their practice, and Castiel felt lost in their matches.
The trucker stares at him plainly. Cas looks away quickly, a chill running down his spine. There is something about the face, eyes, and demeanor of the trucker that tickles memories that Cas had long ago suppressed, giving him a bad feeling. Some traumatizing experiences in high school and Cas was assigning anyone that looked like his first love with the same rageful thoughts he had of the boy who broke his heart.
Castiel's eyes squinted and he tilted his head in confusion. He didn’t quite follow what Ash was saying, but it sounded good. And it felt nice to be wanted.
He gestured to the boys’ street clothes. Some of them chuckled and they all started heading for the locker room to change as the others trickled in.
Castiel’s fingers seemed to have a newfound conviction, nudging against Dean’s fevered skin until he was laying Dean tenderly back on the bed. Dean couldn’t help but oblige, having Castiel crawl up after him.
“Do it, Dean!” came Asmod’s voice.
,” Dean explains, “
Dean awoke lazily to the sensation of the comforter being pulled back. He was groggy as hell and Ash was snoring loudly. He was wondering what time it was when he felt a body lay next to him.
Castiel sighed and turned to Drex, asking begrudgingly, “Would you like one as well?”
“What’s going on, Jack?” Cas asks urgently. Jack looks as if he’s fit to cry, saying with a shaky tone, “One of the customers wants to talk with you. I don’t recognize him from around here, but  it seemed like he liked his food, I’m so sorry if I messed up, I-”
Cas hears Dean’s breath stop as Cas begins to undo Dean’s pants. Then, a gust of air in the form of words punches out of the man above, “Oh, god yes, Cas.”
He was still getting used to everyone being friendly with him when he felt so awkward inside. The last three nights Castiel had come early to avoid walking with Dean. He had the key, and he thought it would save time to set up beforehand. Because of this, the team also looked to him for structure.
His eyes almost immediately land on a person in the small dining area. Dean is shocked for a moment and halts because... it’s not Cas. The person is in pajamas and eating cereal, holding the bowl in one hand as they stand near the table while facing the television that’s playing a cartoon in the next room. The stranger takes a bite and smiles at Dean.
“Man, I just can’t figure out why you don’t like me,” Dean's voice didn’t seem all too friendly anymore. Good.
“But why?”
He nods with a humble defeat, “Alright, I can close up tonight.”
Cas relaxes as he makes coffee. Jack starts getting out dishes, pans, and ingredients, saying, “I’ll make pancakes! Oh! You have chocolate chips? Chocolate chip pancakes, yes!”
“Dean-“
Cas uses his tender ass to push open the diner’s back door leading to the side alley where the dumpster is, pulling the two full trash cans out after him. The door slams closed and Cas moves over to the dumpster, the rumbling of the trash cans’s wheels against the asphalt booms against the otherwise quiet night.
“Ah, fuck,” Cas couldn’t say anything to that, instead getting lost in the feeling of Dean pulling out his fingers and moving up his body to lick at his nipple. He couldn’t tell if his submissiveness was a mood that would last, or was just a symptom of having a heavy conscience.
All of it happens in a flash: he mistakenly thinks the rumbling is finally a whisper of thunder, but Peterbilt's tall brights illuminate a storm of boulders and rocks that are hurtling down from above the cliffside.
Cas counts quickly as Hannah and Bart come around with their personal belongings. They give one another proverbial pats on the back for a good day’s work and say goodnight. Finally, Cas is alone again. He exhales deeply, glad that he can take his time closing and get lost in methodical work of cleaning.
“Ergh,” Dean grumbled, “Okay, okay. Everybody step aside.”
,” Dean quickly points out, “
Dean bites his lip, “Not exactly… I’m, um, not really working right now.”
“Do you want to stop?” Dean’s voice gently asked.
Castiel’s brow creased and he squinted to the side, “No, Luci is an asshole.”
close. Like, closer than ever.”
Castiel looked up and saw Dean Winchester taking off his shirt. He noticed bruises on the boy’s tan arms and quickly looked away. Castiel pulled on his jacket, minding his own business. He sat down on the bench and trained his eyes on his sneakers as he slipped into them.
going on. You’re imagining things. I’ve just been busy lately, that’s all.”
could.”
He turns off his alarm that he’d set to go off at half past two. Dean isn’t certain, but he thinks schools get out around this time. He supposes that is his cue to high tail it out of here. He grunts and rolls his sore body off the bed, grateful that he was able to at least shower again and get some rest before setting on the road again. At Cas’s behest, he’d rebandaged his wounds and shaved after their shower. And to be with Cas… That is always the best.
The thought of Dean with Amanda, only five days ago, in
The second text under the picture of himself reads: “
“Bravo one-one,” Dean spouts off quickly.
“Castiel,” Coach Singer continued, “You help me with tryouts every season. Why not throw the guy around a little too, huh?”
“Yeah, well,” Cas says spitefully, still looking off, “I guess you’ve forgotten a lot.”
Cas’s anger seems to flare back, and now fully directed at Dean. He feels immediate regret for pushing his limits as Cas snaps at him, “Don’t make your smartass remarks at a situation you don’t understand.”
“Oh? My form is bad, huh?” Dean asked with a cocked brow and spreading smile.
Jack nods, “It’s okay… You want a bowl?”
“Do you think one cup will hurt?” Jack asks, genuinely concerned.
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice was the only thing Dean could hear.
Dean doesn’t care to finish his sentence, instead punctuating it with a string of curses as Cas’s tongue grows bitter and he smells cum from the back of his throat. He squeezes Dean’s ass as the man rolls through his orgasm, supporting a lot of his weight and with Dean’s pulsating dick in his mouth no less. Cas swallows, not in love with the taste but drowned in the sensation of drinking Dean. Cas moans, his own dick so rock hard and still trapped in his clothes.
Cas isn’t quite meeting Dean’s eyes, which are hopeful yet suspicious. Dean doesn’t know how to respond, not wanting to get his heart racing over the thought that Cas may not want him to go quite yet. Cas shrugs nonchalantly, “No offense, but you look like a mess.”
Out of luck, time, and money, Dean stopped at the local VFW post to get a free meal. That’s when he ran into Coach Singer. They’d sat at the folding table and had dinner together as they caught up. It turned out that Bobby used to serve in the marines with Dean’s own dad back in the day. Dean told him about his father’s recent heart attack and passing. Bobby was sorry to hear that, and it made Dean feel better. He asked the man about Cas. He was hesitant, but when he started he didn’t hold back. But really, he didn’t know much about Cas's whereabouts at that time, just told him about the devastation of the boy’s senior year. Dean could hardly bear a word.
He types out and sends: “
Cas lets the water drip down as he looks at himself in the mirror. He almost doesn’t recognize the face that stares back; flushed yet relaxed. He can’t remember the last time he looked this relaxed.
acting weird?”
The two bodies enjoy a shared silence, both sighing with satisfaction.
“His dad came to Sonny’s,” Anna began quietly after a short silence. Castiel looked up at her, she continued with a sigh, “Ash told Robin that he saw Dean and his dad talking. His dad came to tell Dean that he was leaving him at Sonny’s. Then he was just… gone.”
“Nn!” came out of Castiel’s mouth as the open air choked his pulsing member.
“Then it’s time to call the doctor!” Dean said with a smile.
Anna nodded, wordlessly handing over Samandriel, who was already whining and reaching for the snacks in Castiel’s hand.
Castiel looked at him and suppressed a smile. He hadn’t mentioned to Dean that he helped Anna practice cheerleading. But now was as good a time as any to show him.
“Buckle in, boys,” Jo purred.
“You alright?” Dean’s whispering voice called out.
Cas hangs up. He clenches his phone, cursing himself.
There goes their tip, but he wasn’t expecting much to begin with. Still, he bites his lip, knowing that he had let his emotions get the best of him. He puts the order in and looks around the diner for what needs to be done next.
Castiel pushed away from the edge and got up on his unsteady feet. He slowly tiptoed back to his bedroom’s open window and crawled in, sliding the window closed behind him.
“Okay, focus up. Castiel, or Cas, whatever,” Jo slurred, “You’re reigning champ so you go first!”
He sets the glass down to come back to later as he carries his sorry ass and his dufflebag up the dusty stairs. He finds the guest bathroom and quickly takes a shower in the dingy tub, not bothering to turn on the lights. The water never gets very hot and the pressure is shot, but Dean doesn’t care about that either. His mind feels blissfully numb from the alcohol, and he’s soon rifling through his bag for some kind of clean clothing.
Dean can only brace himself. The steep incline and loose treading don’t slow down the Peterbilt as much as Dean wants. He’s still going over 20 miles an hour when the end of the ramp approaches. Dean gets into the best position he can for the collision, but it doesn’t stop the full blow of the impact.
“I own this ‘rundown’ establishment, thank you very much,” Cas replies roughly, turning back to Dean with a new furocity. How dare he judge him for the diner, and Cas will say as much as he retorts, “Who are you to talk anyway, hm? You’re a truck driver.”
Not expecting anyone at this hour, Cas whips around to - Dean motherfucking Winchester. He’s leaning against the building opposite, partially swallowed by the shadows of the overhang.
Dean’s voice is surprisingly even as he demands, “Say I didn’t mean anything to you.”
Then again, that’s not really stopped him before - he can’t help but think about how desperate he was in the back alley of the diner during their first time, raw and all. So all he can do is hold on to Cas and ask, “That what you want? What if it’s, y’know...”
“Hey, ya old man,” Dean says, not holding back a smile as he gingerly bends over to give Bobby a hug in his wheelchair.
“Great try,” Coach Singer said, “But see? Bottom can quickly become an advantage.”
Coach Singer praised them both as they untangled. Dean offered Castiel his hand. Castiel bit his lip and didn’t look at Dean as he got up by himself.
The whistle blew. Castiel held on to Dean and moved his leg away from the reach. But Dean lunged again, getting enough room on Castiel’s grip to grab his leg. He performed the switch, but Castiel reswitched. Dean tried to crowd him, but Castiel pushed his hips up into Dean’s. He took the top again and pinned Dean.
Dean exhales, not being able to be mad while Cas looks so upset. He blames himself; Dean told him before that Cas sets the boundaries of their relationship. Dean had always been afraid to talk to Cas about the past, because it was traumatizing and a lot to reflect on. But more than anything, Dean was afraid to intrude too far and risk losing Cas again. And Cas had always asserted that he wants their relationship to be casual, and this current conversation is riding far into the territory of serious stuff.
“Please,” Cas begs, trying to remind him of his need for Dean to be inside of him.
Cas only reads it over once before sending it. The message delivers. Cas holds his breath.
Castiel looked back down at the line of shots. They weren’t so menacing…
, which is arguably the best,” Dean continues.
Castiel suddenly felt a baseless anger towards Dean. He bit his lip as Anna reentered with glasses full of water and her backpack slung over her shoulder.
“Mm,” Cas presses his body against Dean’s, “Dean…”
They walked in silence for a few minutes. Castiel’s resolved disdain for Dean had begun to wane, and he found himself remorseful of all the rude ways he’d treated Dean. At the end of it all, Castiel just had the problem with himself. He hadn’t deserved Dean’s help and his continued kindness.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean encouraged, “If you match her shots then you both have to chug.”
Cas instantly regrets his decision. Now that it happened, it feels so desperate and sudden, and god! Dean may have a monogamous, significant other and he really might have just wanted to catch up. And it is Cas’s turn to apologize and perhaps go find a hole to live in for the rest of his life.
Dean swallowed, his last words sounding broken. Castiel was listening patiently, his brow furrowing in sympathy. Dean always talked in bits and pieces about his life before coming to Smallville, but Castiel had never pressed him about it.
But Castiel was already walking down the hallway. When he pushed through the double doors and heard them clatter behind him, he started to sprint. He didn’t stop until he was home, face down on his pillow.
“You either have a very active imagination or are very drunk,” Castiel observed.
Dean is looking out at the rain, waiting for his boss to say something. Dean feels pretty busted already - thirty six stitches in total, bruised ribs, sprained forearm, left pinky and ring finger broken, a concussion, countless bruises larger than his hand, and his face looks beat to hell from all the broken glass - but nothing compares to how much he’s beaten himself up. He’s probably financially ruined, and the only bridge that hasn’t completely burned is standing right next to him, and he is not happy.
Castiel had to take a steadying breath. Nobody had ever asked him these questions before, and he never realized how emotional it made him. He replied nonetheless, “Technically, one of my older brothers. But he’s not very good at it. Naomi is so busy with college stuff, Anna’s so young…”
Dean looked back down at him, “Of course. Like, I knew Constintanople was the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Or, rather, Istanbul.”
His head was thrown back as his breath huffed out in puffs of white vapor into the frigid night air. Somehow, there was sweat on his brow. Dean had never thought about moaning before, but he couldn’t help but grunt out in immeasurable pleasure at feeling Castiel tonguing his cock.
The length of Dean’s cock keeps rubbing up into his prostate, getting harder and faster. Cas feels like drool is running out of the side of his mouth, totally in bliss, “Oh, Dean, don’t stop.”
Dean growls, leaning down and catching Cas before he rolls over. He captures Cas’s mouth in his and roughly kisses him. Cas starts to fight, but his eyes sink close and he falls back into tasting Dean’s lips.
Dean’s thumb swiped under Castiel’s eye, pushing those tears away. Castiel looked up at Dean with those liquid blue eyes at last. Dean lost his breath.
,” Dean laughs nervously, “
“Fuck it! Cas, oh I’m-- Damn, I could cum just from your mouth,” Dean moans, kissing and licking desperately at Cas’s hole, fingers digging into Cas’s raw ass cheeks.
“Yeah, really,” Dean replied, trying to make another move impatiently, “So can I just kiss you already?”
Castiel was about to reply when the door they had just come from swung open. A girl with long, straight blonde hair and fair complexion strutted in with armfuls of bags and six packs. It took Castiel only a few moments to recognize her as Jo Harvelle.
Coach Singer stands back up straight, “Alright? We’re going to go about eight to ten yards. Here we go.”
“Cas, it’s okay,” Dean’s voice was ragged, he pushed forward against Castiel’s body. Castiel felt Dean slide something against his own pelvis, right along the length of his cock.
“So, what? You’re going to somehow bend that hunk of metal back into a working vehicle, find
Castiel exhaled deeply and looked at the blade of grass between his fingers. He had learned fairly quickly during his time with Dean that there was little he could hide from him. He shrugged, throwing some grass off down the hill, “I like hanging out with you. I’ll miss you.”
Cas can feel Dean’s body shudder over his. Dean’s hands come up to Cas’s cheek and neck, moving him back towards Dean’s lips. He licks into Cas’s mouth and Cas works his tongue against Dean’s. Their hips are thrusting against one another so much that it begins to burn.
Dean was staring at him with that same confusing expression, but intensified. Castiel lost all his words, just looking at that face. His brows were furrowed, eyes focused yet so distant, but face somehow relaxed in quality.
Castiel turned away and kept walking. He heard Ash and some other teammates’ voices, but he didn’t care. They all wanted to be with Dean, anyway. That was fine by him. He only wished that he could fully disappear and never come back. Instead, he kept his head down and mind far away the rest of the night.
“Yes ma’am,” Benny sips his coffee and looks straight ahead.
Cas is moving with Dean, both of them working together. The heat from Dean’s lower half begins to regain control, and Dean’s thrusts become harder and faster. Cas moans loudly and matches his pace, their thighs wetly slapping against one another.
Castiel’s brow furrowed, a frown pulling at his lips. He looked back down at her homework too, “Yeah, he’s not.”
Cas is completely out of desire now, although still dizzy from the intense orgasm, he swats Dean’s hand away as he stands up and pulls up his pants, back still to Dean. He starts to walk away.
“Ha, not really,” Dean admitted.
Cas shakes his head, “That’s completely different!”
If Dean stops now then he’ll be crushed, so he quickly decides to accelerate and the engine roars aggressively. The biggest part of the landslide misses his cab, but his grip tightens as his rig sways when the pile pummels against the back end of his load.
“Ah, sorry,” Dean started in a shaky, low tone, “I don’t know what got into me. I guess I’ve had a lot to drink after all.”
Castiel drifted down the hallway and nearly missed his classroom door that the teacher had already closed.
Castiel closed his eyes and felt more drunk than he had the entire night. He wondered idly if the exhilaration of having fun was what had kept the inebriation at bay. No matter, he smiled at how Jo and Ash had reacted to him tonight. They seemed to have enjoyed his company, and that was new for Castiel.
Cas ponders Meg’s piece of advice; he wonders if he should try to contact Dean. He takes out his phone and goes to his messages with Dean. He sees the last text he sent: “
Cas steps back and snaps his eyes back at Dean. Oh, shit, he’s still pissed. Cas growls, “That doesn’t matter right now, Dean. Explain, why are you here? It’s only been a week since you last left, and-” Cas seems to lose his propulsion as he looks over Dean, taking in his injuries for the first time, “Um, what happened to you?”
“Why?” Castiel asked with emotion, “Why help me so much? You don’t know me, why everyone hates me…”
Turning around to the other bed he saw Ash and Drex intertwined as well. The image would have been funny if not so cosmically tragic. Perhaps it wasn’t that odd for people to do that, and Dean didn’t think he’d care if anybody else had done what Castiel did. A little strange, sure, but not enough to get out of bed. But Castiel
He takes a sip of his rum. Cas’s eyes trail from Dean’s lips down to his throat. Dean swallows, pursing his lips that exaggerate his upper-lip dimples, and looks back over to Cas. Their eyes meet and Cas’s heart hiccups. A small smile plays on Dean’s lips, “Besides, I already told you, I couldn’t get you out of my head.”
Anna sighed with a pout, “Oh, Castiel, you’re so dull.”
Finally, Cas gives up and looks up into Dean’s eyes. Cas can’t find his breath, totally mesmerized by the look on Dean’s face. Even when Dean sinks forward, their eyes only half close as their lips work together.
Jack sighs, “Some of the kids at school keep making fun of me and I don’t understand why.”
He had to contort and lay on his side to actually fit, but it wasn’t too awful. No... It was terrible. His twisted back was to the rest of the room. From this angle looking up Dean caught a few moonbeams from the bottom of the curtains covering the window above. The sliver of light lulled Dean’s eyes closed as he slipped into sleep at last.
“Happy Holidays, Metatron,” Cas replies indifferently. He turns away from Met, hoping that will be the last of it.
He listens to Ketch’s boots walk away as he sees his last bridge turn to ash.
It had started raining while they were shopping, just like Cas had predicted. After hurriedly unloading groceries back into Cas’s apartment, Cas concedes to Jack that it’s rude for Dean to help them out so much and not offer him a hot meal before he leaves.
Dean tongue yanks out of Cas as Dean calls, “Cas! Ah!”
“Yeah, yeah, I just…” Cas says, not being able to take his eyes off the mug in front of the trucker.
He groans and tosses his phone into the backseat. Just great. The Impala is a beautiful classic, but Dean has never modernized the old auto in keeping with its old school qualities. To be clear, he has no way of charging his phone as he drives.
Castiel sounded meek, “I’m sorry. I didn’t search thoroughly enough before.”
“Hello, Jack,” Cas greets, sipping the steaming liquid with a soft hum of appreciation. He comments, “You’re up early.”
The man’s half smile fades as his eyes bear into Cas’s. Cas wishes he could look away, but finds his gaze anchored as the man asks breathlessly, “This might sound weird, but, um… Are you Castiel Kline?”
Dean blinked, as if coming out of a reverie.
“Pff,” She shrugged, looking down at the paper and poised her pencil as she said as a sad fact, “Why? Dad’s not here.”
“Dean,” Bobby cuts him off from rambling. Dean seals his mouth, knowing that his attempt at changing the subject was pretty obvious.
Castiel was a little taken aback by the sudden turn, but he kept face as he replied, “Chores, probably. Why?”
Cas isn’t laughing. His head is foggy from the alcohol, but his tipsy conscience is holding back his tongue instead of loosening it. He considers pouring another one as he gets the bottle of rum out.
Castiel bit his lip, not wanting to feed into Lucifer’s games. Luci didn’t seem to mind, his eyes shifting over to Dean. His smile turned into a sneer, pulling out a crooked cigarette as he directed to Dean, “What the fuck are you looking at?”
Dean tacked on the last comment quickly, turning back to the backpack. Castiel smiled, “It’s okay, we don’t get along very well.”
“Your older brother’s an asshole, though,” Dean observed.
“Thanks, I guess...” Castiel replied quietly, “It’s not too much?”
An old, painful familiarity… Cas doesn’t chase that train of thought, instead a little confused at the sudden tense silence that falls between them after what was going to be a confrontational experience. The guy is just staring at him, and Cas starts to squirm awkwardly.
“You’re still mad at me,” Dean sounded mad too.
“Wha- huh?!” Ash’s voice shouted from across the room. Dean stiffened and caught his breath, realizing his exclamation must’ve woke him up. There were a few intense seconds of silence as Dean listened intently to the bed behind his back before he heard Ash grumble. A bed whined under the weight of some movement and the snoring resumed. Dean let out his breath gratefully.
Castiel watched the sunset’s lights against the clouds through the narrow, overhead windows of the gym. Thunder had rumbled all day, but no rain fell from the looming overcast sky, making the sunset pale and dark. The mats were placed around Castiel as he stood in the middle of the empty gym, looking up and squinting past the bright fluorescent lights on the ceiling.
Dean blinks at him, “Huh?”
“No,” Dean sighs, not wanting to reveal to Cas how actually financially destitute he is, “Nah, I wasn’t planning on it. I’ll just head back to Indiana, bunk up there.”
The rest of the Christmas day continues with watching cartoon holiday movies together and eating more. Jack and Cas enjoy each other’s company, and Jack has one more cup of hot chocolate before he dozes off to sleep on the couch.
Cas groans to himself. Claire… Despite her not always being the best teamplayer, he’d rather have her than nobody tonight. Still, he knows he’ll get an earful and a half if he effectively lets Jack go to this party and not Claire. Afterall, they are just teenagers just starting their senior year.
Cas opens the cabinet behind him and takes out a washcloth. He turns on the sink again and wets it, avoiding his reflection as he wipes down his cum soaked chest and spent cock. He shivers as he wipes the latter, trembling at the sensitivity. But he works through it, cleaning his tender asshole last.
The days are like seasons; the seasons serve to emphasize the years. Castiel lets the years pass like days as he slowly creeps towards his forties. Another cool early morning of late August in the small town of Bootbock, and Cas falls back into his daily routine.
“Rise and shine, motherfucker!” Ash yelled. A pillow slammed against Dean’s face.
Starting to get worried, Dean carefully swung his legs over the side of the bed and got up. His back was still a little sore, but definitely a whole lot more bearable. He tiptoed to the TV stand and looked around; the bolt was unlocked at the front door. Castiel really wasn’t there. Looking down, Dean noticed the only pair of room keys both lying on the stand’s edge.
Dean pressed his forehead against Castiel’s, and he felt a surge of electricity strike through his body.
“No, h-he bit him!” Jervis piped up, “A-and escaped from his handc-cuffs!”
On the last exhale, Castiel replied, “How you make me feel scares me. But…”
Cas hears the bag of garbage he had dropped on the ground go into the dumpster. The dumpster lid closes and the wheels of the empty garbage cans echo down the space as the back door of the diner opens and closes, and the footsteps and wheels are gone.
Jack pouts but starts to get up, “Okay, you’re right.”
“You don’t know what he did?” Dean asks.
Cas nods.
Dean sighed and moved back over Castiel, his hand coming back to press down on Castiel’s bicep. However, now the bulge against Castiel’s exposed dick was a softer fabric that shielded Dean’s own hard member.
But he is trembling, uncontrollably. Dean holds him tighter and Cas feels loopy by just trying to stop his skin from jumping all over the place.
“Oh,” Castiel chuckled and drank. That was pretty silly of him.
Still dark out, Dean’s low lights illuminate the small, deserted roads of another humble small town in Missouri, tucked away in canopied hills of trees and sinister kudzu vine. He navigates to the on ramp and speeds along the highway.
She tacked on quickly: “Can you edit my essay for tomorrow’s English class too?”
“Ash, come on, show neutral to Dean,” Coach Singer called. Castiel stuck to the back, keeping his head low as he watched.
Cas smiles back and checks out the car, “It is very nice. Jack was admiring it earlier when we left.”
Perhaps Dean could read the worry that had taken over Castiel. He looked to his only true friend and asked, “Do you really think you’ll leave so soon?”
A silence falls and Cas feels a swell of uncertainty in his chest as his limbs go still; he’s glad that had shut up Dean, but Cas is suddenly wishing he’d have some kind of comeback. And then it comes like a bullet in the back: “You’re still hung up about high school, aren’t you?”
Cas cuts himself off and clears his throat. Dean wishes he hadn’t - he wants to hear more about Cas and his life with his son. But Cas looks bashful and shrugs, “Anyway… I guess I’ll be seeing you?”
“Fuck the gutter, grab past it,” Dean started to chuckle.
He types and sends the first thing he thinks of: “
Castiel groaned teasingly.
Cas feels his mouth pool with hot saliva as his eyes flutter open, “Nn, Dean!”
“Cas, can I see you?” Dean repeated.
Dean huffs, “Why would you even say that?”
Cas waits for a moment, staring at his phone screen. No response. Cas huffs a sigh and locks it again. He drags himself to the bathroom, cleaning and getting ready.
Dean’s back slammed against the ground and Castiel heard him groan.
The whistle called from Coach Singer, marking the end of the match.
“I want you to fuck me,” Cas says plainly, eyes boring into Dean’s, “Here. Right now.”
He lived in a full house of his brothers and sisters. Their dad was away on another book tour, and Luci was in charge of his younger siblings. That meant that the house was a wreck.
Castiel nodded. Dean lowered himself another few inches and their lips met.
The sudden chants that interrupted Dean were matched with arms from their teammates wrapping around the shoulders of Castiel, making him give a stunned gasp as they ushered the two into the bus with the funneling team.
Castiel could feel Dean’s eyes on him and he cleared his throat, scooting his shot glass into the middle of the coffee table as he dodged the question, “How about another?”
“Do you have pictures?”
“Sorry for the wait, Cas,” Jody says, taking a seat at the bar with Donna and eyeing Claire. She continues to Cas, “Hit some road bumps on the way here.”
“C’mon, you can ask me this many too.”
Castiel kept a good distance ahead of everybody, especially the three boys who teased him the most. It was easy to stay ahead; Castiel enjoyed athletics and the boys who bullied him just walked and joked around in the back.
“Nobody would let me cool down with them before you came,” Castiel continued suddenly.
A small break of silence. Cas opens his eyes and looks over, even though Dean's face is buried in his neck. He feels Dean shake his head, “I just wanted to know if you remembered.”
Jack directs Dean around the town more than Cas does, pointing out spots and sharing with Dean things he’s done there or what they are. It seems like he really loves Bootbock, like it’s a home for him. Dean wonders what that must feel like, vicariously marveling at the youth’s enthusiasm at a cracked sidewalk where Cas and him watch the Fourth of July parade every year.
Dean bites his lip and flips open the pack; there’s about half left, and his lucky is still flipped. Dean quickly pulls one of them out and stuffs it in his mouth, flicking his zippo alight before he can think twice. The inhale of the sweet, stale tobacco and easy nicotine makes Dean shiver. He takes another sip.
Seeing Dean with Benny today brought up a lot of emotions Cas doesn’t know how to handle.
And down further… Dean’s sight went black, rolling his hips upwards as he pulled Castiel closer to him from his ass. He bit into the closest bit of Castiel’s flesh. Castiel’s slightly chilled hands made contact with Dean’s cock and it took all of Dean’s might to not explode right then and there.
“I know!” Anna called back, already out of sight.
The group chuckled, but Castiel’s eyes were trained on Dean as he lifted the first glass up and then downed it. Dean quickly slammed the empty glass upside down and took the second in line. He drank it, put it on the low table upside down, and took a third. He started drinking it but coughed and set it back down.
“Is that so?”
Dean pulls back slightly to look into Cas’s face. Cas’s eyes are half open, looking back at Dean wrapped in his arms above, eyes blown out with lust as he slowly pushes into Cas.
“Ah!” Jack drops his sandwich.
Jack shrugs, “I was thinking of skipping it. Y’know, like we had a busy day and-”
Castiel’s mouth snapped shut and he peeked up to Dean quickly. Dean seemed absorbed in the sewing, not minding that Castiel had been talking so much. But Castiel had noticed. He didn’t typically indulge in speaking about himself at length. But his words had fallen out as easily as Dean’s needle had moved through Castiel’s backpack strap.
Cas looks up at Dean as he undoes the man’s jeans, “Is there something you have to say?”
Dean’s fingers lost their hold in Castiel’s hair. He didn’t think he’d ever have the energy to open his eyes ever again, could hardly stand on his own two feet.
Dean did his best to keep his cool, attempting at all costs to not let his nerves get the best of him. He decided he’d avoid talking as to not get himself in any more trouble by accidentally revealing what a true wreck he was inside. The keys to the gym dug awkwardly into his thigh through his front pocket, making him walk with purpose.
Cas grumbles in response. The latest he has to start getting ready for his day is in another hour and a half, so Cas is already allowing his hazy mind to drift to sleep.
Cas blushes and his own cock stretches his pants. Yeah, he does just want this. To use and be used, it makes him feel dirty and desperate. He swallows around Dean’s cock in his throat, squeezing it as his head bobs up and down while he sucks and licks.
The soft ambience of the hotel comes back to him; the shitty heater humming, a dim glow of light and the soft chatter from the beat up TV he’d left on. His lungs stop trembling and he sighs defeatedly, rolling onto his side. His feet hit the floor as he sits up, leaning forward to dig his elbows into his knees as he rubs his dry eyes with his fingers.
Castiel met her gaze, “Okay.”
“Asstiel doesn’t want to suck our dicks today,” Al laughed. Castiel finished tying his shoes and closed his locker door.
But Cas’s hesitance is brief, sighing as he fiddles with his tumbler, “It’s complicated, Dean.”
Benny thumbs at Cas and Meg beside him and Rufus takes a quick glance before continuing to make the drink. He says clearly and casually, “I think he should just call him.”
The sun has melted any shred of winter away. Dean had left in the early morning, and Cas hadn’t asked for his key back. But most importantly, he had been there to say goodbye to Dean. He didn’t know how to feel about how good it was to make out with Dean over coffee.
Cas rolls his eyes obviously, saying before lifting a bag out of the trash and tossing it into the dumpster, “Don’t tempt me.”
Dean feels Cas’s fingers at his jawline play with his facial hair there and his spine tingles. Dean loses his smile, looking down at Cas - so close to him now. Cas’s eyes meet Dean’s, and the look Dean sees there is one he’s all too familiar with.
Castiel’s fingers additionally grabbed the waistband of Dean’s boxer-briefs, tugging the thin but soft layered fabric of Dean’s underwear and flannel pajamas over his hard cock. Dean gasped back a moan as his dick fell out and tapped heavily against Cas’s soft cheek.
Jack raises his brow in surprise, “You didn’t?”
Dean tried on a toothy grin that had Castiel’s heart thudding against his chest. Dean’s words had Castiel genuinely concerned for his young health, as the boy asked, “So what you’re saying is you’ll be smiling a lot more often now that I’m around?”
Cas’s moans are choked and so he moans more; he sounds lewd and provokes a response from Dean. His hips thrust into Cas’s, his bare cock already hardened against Cas’s skin. Cas’s weeping dick comes back to life as well.
Rain continues to pelt the now shattered windshield, but it sounds like silence in Dean’s ringing ears. He is helpless as he fades into black unconsciousness.
Jo laughed, “Nice. Dean, it’s all you.”
Dean walked up first and Castiel followed him closely. Dean turned to him and cleared his throat, “Cas. We talked about this. Personal space.”
Cas has especially been going crazy this past week. He finds his heart pounding whenever he spies a patron who even somewhat resembles Dean. Whenever he notices a black cab of a semi-truck pulling into the back from the diner’s windows; he holds his breath until the driver walks in and he sees it’s not Dean.
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice was void of any ecstasy, filled with concern in its place, “Don’t push yourself.”
Dean pushes his fingers in further, until he’s at his bottom knuckles. Cas’s sticky mouth moans, “Dean, you’re torturing me.”
So Dean was then eyeing a shirtless Castiel sitting on the floor between Drex’s legs, who was sitting up at the foot of the bed above him. Dean couldn’t see Castiel’s face from where he was sitting, but his eyes kept landing short of the television and instead watched Castiel’s skin and muscles flex under clumsy fingers.
Castiel bit his lip, knowing it was a lame excuse. Even Anna had expressed to him earlier that week that she wanted to go to the party.
Walking on the shoulder of the road, Castiel didn’t even notice the car that had crept up behind him before a loud, long honk alerted him. Castiel turned and was able to dive off the shoulder of the road as a car skimmed him at a wickedly fast speed, engine revving loudly like a crack of thunder. A group of startled birds took flight from a nearby tree. Castiel’s breath was wild. The car screeched to a stop. Castiel’s back was against the road’s rusted guardrail as he watched Asmod, Al, and Ash get out of the car.
Cas peeks around the diner cautiously, taking a measured sigh of relief at seeing Gadreel waiting tables in the dining area. Cas has to stop this Dean-train before it derails and it’s revealed to all in the diner that Cas is associated with this person.
She wipes away a tear but can’t stop giggling as she points to Dean a couple times, “Wait, hold on. I know you! Yeah, you used to always bunk up at the motel but never stayed in your room.”
Dean was looking at him intensely, and Castiel felt a calm wash over him. There was a feeling Castiel couldn’t put into words, but was roughly a realization that his wanting to run away was directly associated with wanting to be intimate with Dean.
“Are you sleeping with other people?” Dean asks.
Stepping forward, Dean pleads, “Why, Cas? Why would you keep something like this from me?”
Cas plays the B side of Dean’s Led Zeppelin mix tape. He likes this side the most because it has “D’yer Mak’er.”
Dean meets his gaze with an easy eye. Cas hates him for it, for not feeling just as anxious as Cas is.
” Charlie is rightly confused.
“Gross! Hands off!” Jo said, kicking his shin as she walked past to sit on the other side of him, “And you’re welcome.”
“Yes, left on left. Forearm, that’s right,” Coach Singer finished and then stood up, asking, “Okay, now try to maintain control. Got it?”
A light tap at the door. Castiel looked up as little Samandriel waddled in. Castiel set down his book and sat up in his bed, asking, “Hey, you hungry, Alfie?”
Castiel hated this boy, and he tried to translate all his rage through the deep eye contact between them. Dean only stared back at him. A soft tongue came out and licked those generous lips, opening slightly as if to say something.
“No prob-”
Castiel’s eyes snapped open at the realization. He’d liked how Dean leaned into him, liked the feeling of his soft lips against his own.
Cas rolls his eyes, “Yes. He’s all about cars right now. I know he really wants his own-”
Cas smiles, he could tell something was going on. Jack continues before Cas can even begin to respond, “I mean, I can stay if you need me to! There’s just this party- those new friends asked me to go! I said I was working, and they said that was lame, but it was just yesterday so I couldn’t find a cover and so I thought I’d just ask if-”
“Well… I mean, what if something happened to him? It’s not like I would know…”
“Looks like it’s going to rain again,” Cas observes, coming to Dean’s side, “The weather here has been bad lately.”
“Take a seat, Mr. Winchester,” Castiel heard her sternly tell Dean.
“Dean.”
Dean caught himself leaning forward as his fingertips connected with Castiel’s lax jaw - the want to kiss Castiel had briefly overwhelmed his senses. But he couldn’t kiss Castiel while he was sleeping, that was just plain creepy. Still, though, Dean was already touching Castiel’s face.
He nonetheless lost his breath before Castiel was pushing his lips back against Dean’s. Dean slid his tongue against the boy’s as Castiel’s hand snaked away from his cock. Dean’s hands on Castiel’s ass felt the material bunch up, and soon a hot mass was laying against Dean’s dick.
Dean’s mind skids to a halt. He feels a sudden urge to kick himself for not properly preparing for this question. It’s Dean’s turn to look away, “I, uh, fell down some stairs. Face first, bam. Pretty embarrassing.”
The first day of the tournament was challenging, but the fight made the grief of struggling more bearable. Dean only wished he could celebrate their outstanding performance with his teammates, but he was in a ton of pain, and not just of the mental variety. His ill fated night of sleep had messed up his body more than he had originally thought. He wanted to win, though, and competed as if he was in tiptop shape.
Cas opens the door to Dean, leaning against the door jam with his arm all casual and cool; it makes Cas sick. He looks over to Cas, half smile cocked, greeting: “Was starting to think you gave me the wrong address.”
Cas swallows, “Maybe,” he begins with a small moan in between as Dean hits his prostate, “Maybe I did once. But that was a long time ago.”
“Meg! Hi!” Jack is all too excited.
Castiel went on, his thumb working out a particularly difficult knot, “They thought I’d turn them gay.”
Dean turns to him with a smile that isn’t honest, “I’ll be fine.”
Dean lost his breath at the mirroring of words he had been so embarrassed to have spilled out of him earlier. They sounded better coming from Castiel. He could only manage to breathe out: “Oh, Cas-”
Dean is still lying backwards on the bed, his arm covering his face. Cas tosses the towel onto Dean’s body, collapsing on the bed laying the other way. He buries his face into the pillow, hoping beyond reasonability that Dean will quietly clean up and show himself the door.
“Ah, it’s not so bad,” Benny shrugs, “Gas is still a highly valued commodity, after all. Besides, it’s almost always in state.”
“No,” Cas says, rocking his hips against Dean’s rhythm, feeling the distant lump of the buttplug as he moves. He licks at Dean’s neck, moving up to bite his earlobe and whispering back, “I want more.”
Dean tried to adjust, embarrassed at how obvious his body reacted to Castiel. But Castiel stayed strong, moving with Dean so that he didn’t go anywhere.
“Mr. Kline?” the teacher called. Castiel didn’t dare turn to look at her, afraid of also seeing all the other classmates' eyes.
The entire time - on the bus and at the stadium - Dean felt fevered, distant, and exhausted. He smiled along with his friends when he was prompted, but most of his time was spent making sure not to get too close to Castiel. He wasn’t sure how to act around the other boy in front of people now. And also, everytime he was near Dean would get lightheaded. Not a good combo for the competition. But keeping a good distance from Castiel proved more difficult at the opening rather than on the bus, as Coach Singer was calling the two over to him every half hour or so to introduce them to coaches, refs, and sponsors. Dean’s only reprieve was the warm ups and practice rounds, which he threw his all into.
The locker room door opened and Castiel watched as Dean’s details became more clear through the dark the closer he got to him, wearing his henley shirt with his leather jacket and jeans. Castiel started walking away towards the double doors to the outside.
Castiel remained silent, breathing heavily.
Dean leans down, his lips trailing against the skin of Cas’s neck as he mutters with a grin, “Come on. You’re filthier than I am.”
Cas is already opening the door, trying to clear the smile away remembering now to announce himself, “Hey, Jack, wh-”
“I like your jacket.”
“I’ll be right back,” Dean promised, walking to the bank. Castiel opened his mouth to protest, but Dean was already traversing the creek to the other side, hopping precariously from one large, slick rock to the next.
Both Cas and Dean know that he wouldn’t actually hit Dean, but it is a threat Cas is willing to throw out there. Dean laughs in shock, “That’d be a sight, huh? You think we’d get in the local paper?”
“Go, go! Go! Ah!” Lucifer shouted at the television in the living room. The football game was blaring, but Luci’s voice still cut through loud and clear, “What the hell is going on with dinner?!”
Cas huffs, trying to shake off his clenched nerves, “Dean!”
“Ha, just watch!” Raul laughed.
“You have that same look,” Dean began, “That same look from earlier tonight.”
He messages Sam, Bobby, Charlie that he didn’t die on his way to Cas’s, and additionally shoots an email to a guy named Frank - a fixer of sorts for independent truck drivers contracting out. He doesn’t know why he casts that particular bait, but he also feels better after doing it; as if he’s at least working towards something while sitting around twiddling his broken thumbs.
Dean’s form was great, and Castiel knew it. But he nodded solemnly anyway, replying, “Downright atrocious.”
“It didn’t mean anything,” Dean continued, eyes moving to the side, “I really am sorry.”
“Supposed to be a doozy,” Donna continues, taking a bite.
“Cas, um,” Castiel watched Dean lick his lips, “Can I- Can I see you?”
“Dear Dean and I will demonstrate,” Ash replied for Dean, sitting up and rubbing his hands together as Jo came back over to set the other shot glass next to the other four.
Asmod threw that rock at Castiel and hit his hairline. Castiel hissed with pain, but endured it. He felt a trickle of blood running down his forehead and dripping down his brow.
Castiel laughed.
“Okay,” Dean made no sign of leaving, “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
And that’s just what Dean decided he’d let himself believe as he finally relaxed into the mattress, eyes slipping closed at last. This was nice, much better than being crammed between Ash and Drex. Dean had nothing to worry about all along, and he submitted to the need to roll on to his stomach.
The two boys laid there for what felt like an eon. Their skin was sticky with sweat and cum, every nerve alight at the very whisper of a breeze. The two shuddered against one another as their senses returned to them.
He bit his lip, now focusing on the swelling pain in his face. Castiel had really knocked him good, and now Dean had a little more sympathy for Drex’s experience. He lifted up his hand to touch his cheek to sum up the damage. Just as he did, Castiel rolled again, his arm flopping over Dean, awkwardly trapping Dean’s hand against his face.
is back on, but before Jack turns his attention to it, he says wholeheartedly to Dean, “That’s so cool.”
“Ugh! Bad boys always get the girls,” Ash agonized.
“Jesus,” Ketch takes another drag, “And your rig?”
Castiel’s brows raised as a response. It was uncommon to have a new teammate enter tournaments after the season had begun, and even a month of practice was usually considered too soon.
Castiel watched as Coach Singer showed Dean how he’d start with his hands and knees on the mat as Raul came from behind and held him in the referee's position. Coach Singer called for another round; Dean tried to reach over, but Raul moved his leg away and pinned Dean down.
Cas looks uncomfortable, “That this happened to you this week...”
“Well, you’re not
“Cool,” Jack is in awe, “Could you teach me how to fight?”
Cas gulps. The other two read: “
Cas doesn’t reply, moving his hand away after a moment. Dean thinks he’s left and he really starts to fall asleep. He’s shaken from his slipping once more by the sensation of Cas’s body shoving against his side, arm intertwining with Dean’s. He opens one eye to witness that Cas really has cozied up next to him. Dean can’t help but ask, “Aren’t you going to bed?”
From what Cas can tell, the man is pretty intimidating; wearing a heavy, leather coat that’s wet from the rain, hunched over his phone’s map app next to the menu on the tabletop. Cas takes a deep breath and approaches the table, “Hi. Something I can start you off wi-”
Drool connects their tongues as Dean breaks their kiss. Cas half opens his eyes to look at Dean before the man is pushing him around to switch their positions. Cas gasps softly, but turns around quickly when Dean slightly pushes at his shoulder. Cas’s hands are on the kitchen counter now and Dean is directly behind him, pushing his chest and top of his cock against Cas’s back.
Cas sighs with relief, but he sucks it back in as a hand lands his shoulder from behind. Cas spins around, eyes wild with fear. His sigh returns as he sees it’s just Bart, probably returning from his smoke break.
Dean and Castiel typically came to the embankment after wrestling practice nowadays. It had been a couple of weeks since their tournament, and the team had proceeded to the next tournament that would decide if the team would go to state or not.
“Cas!” Dean’s voice calls louder. Cas whips around, and fixes Dean with a murderous gaze. Dean is looking at him, face unreadable but eyes shining.
“Expect some heavy traffic, ‘kay?” Jody lifts her mug to Cas. He sighs. Just great, an unusually busy day to expect and he was closing two members short. The diner was placed just so that it was a few miles away from an exit off the main highway. There were strangers to expect, truck drivers, families on a road trip, and other transients. But when there was a storm, everyone got off the road and seemed to find shelter at the meek diner. Afterall, some people still were of the opinion that these little holes in the wall were better than the convenient McDonald’s or gas station less than a mile away from the exit.
He coughs and bites his lip, hating himself for what he’s done to Cas as it is. Sometimes, in the really lonely stretches of the road, Dean will consider what life would be like with Cas. He even considered it before he’d reunited with Cas. Even when they were teenagers. And back in the marine days, when things were really scary or tough, he’d calm himself by imagining some grown version of Castiel, safe and sound in bed. He imagines kissing that restful brow.
He abandons his empty glass and walks around the counter to where Dean sits. Dean’s body rotates to Cas as he comes closer. Cas accuses: “So this is just convenient for you.”
Castiel leaned against the wall and watched the clouds pass by as he waited.
Cas blinks and looks away, blushing. The first time he ever got drunk was with Dean; even then it had surprised Dean how much Cas could put down.
Castiel couldn’t help glancing over. Dean was facing his own locker, shirt off. Castiel managed to keep his curious eyes away from the bruises on Dean’s arms. He continued, “That’s what I was going to say before.”
Castiel tried to push him away, “Dean-”
“Ah!” a moan rips out of Cas’s throat and he squeezes his eyes closed as the match catches fire.
Castiel got onto his stomach and looked over the edge, whispering back, “Yes, I’m good. Thank you.”
Castiel looked over and caught Dean’s shining eyes. Castiel blushed and turned back to his locker, biting harder on his lip to keep the smile at bay.
Castiel mitigated Dean’s quick crowding, but Castiel switched into a tight box form that locked Dean’s movements from a reswitch. Dean’s shoulders were pinned to the floor. There was a struggle, the hold, and then the quick release in the light of the winner.
This attitude quickly shifts as Cas hears Benny’s rumbling laughter.
“Both are solid names,” Ash said with a nod, as if he had seriously considered the matter, “Very secret agent-y.”
“Folks are already pulling off the road,” Jody adds while lifting her mug.
Cas is so much more attractive with age. Somehow, the lines on his tan face accentuates his sharp jaw and strange beauty. He’s fit as hell, with the same thick, muscular thighs and calves he had in his youth.
“Ah!”
Castiel tried to shrug it off, “I have the keys so I have to lock up anyway.”
“Castiel keeps pushing me off! It’s like he’s wrestling in his sleep. I can’t stand it!”
“An omelette, then.”
“See you later, Asstiel!” Asmod called.
Cas remains silent.
“Nnn!” is the only response that Cas can get out of himself, moaning and panting unabashedly otherwise.
“Good,” Dean moans against Cas’s skin. Cas’s palm presses deeply into his eye socket; he hates having Dean’s validation. Cas can feel one of Dean’s hands move to the buttplug, giving it a teasing tug.
Castiel chuckled nervously, “You were disappointed?”
“Yeah,” Anna replied as she knelt down to him. Castiel didn’t need her help, and Mr. Wyatt knew it. He caught the teacher’s eye, but he turned away again. Castiel began picking up his papers and Anna helped.
The lights were off in his room because everybody was asleep and Castiel had opted to sneak out instead of asking permission from Lucifer. Besides, Luci had already left to go out with his friends for the night. Nonetheless, the more he could avoid his oldest brother, the better. Or anyone in the house, for that matter.
Dean turned back to Castiel, but Castiel merely cocked a sarcastic brow at Dean. Dean huffed a laugh in surprise. He shook his head, “Oh, fuck you, man. I could be good, but that teacher is such a drag.”
Dean felt rejected like a stab to the chest. This was sort of the last thing Dean expected, totally blindsided. He bit his lip, sighing and moving his hands away from Castiel as he replied, “Oh. You know, you could have mentioned you weren’t into me before I went and made a total fool of myself.”
With one last deep breath, he hopped onto the roof’s ledging under his bedroom window. His room was in the back of the house, and the roof wrapped around to also provide a cover for the back porch on the first floor.
“Have you seen Jack?” Cas tries not to sound frantic.
“Look at me, Cas,” Dean whispers. Cas pauses, but does as Dean asks, turning his head and opening his eyes. He’s expecting Dean to do something similar to before, ready to lie straight to Dean’s face. But he doesn’t get the opportunity as Dean leans in and kisses him.
He points to the white paper bag of donut holes next to her plate. Cas’s brow cocks; he never took Dean for having a sweet tooth. Donna and Jody had brought him some of Ms. Mildred’s morning pastries to sell, and Donna always got a bag for herself.
Cas’s brow wrinkles, “What? That’s too far. What’s the rush?”
“Don’t worry, we’ll talk about it on the ride,” Cas says reassuringly. Cas stops in front of Dean and holds up his phone to Dean. It’s unlocked and there’s a picture on the screen. Cas’s voice is deep, low, and more serious than at any other point this morning as he warns Dean: “If you see this man, call the police.”
The entrance’s bell rings behind Cas’s back.
Cas shakes his head.
Castiel took it out of his bag and handed it to her wordlessly. She took it out of his hand but stayed for a while.
Castiel was a little surprised that Dean wanted to do something with Castiel another time. Especially after all that had happened today. He wouldn’t have blamed Dean if he wanted this to be their first and last real interaction. But Castiel couldn’t deny the thought of Dean showing him something was appealing. The idea brought a soft smile to Castiel’s lips, “Okay then.”
“And you have a brother too? A younger one?”
Instead, he just goes for it; his tongue and lips cup Dean’s cock head and then he is pushing further. And further, and further. He opens his throat and takes all of Dean in. Dean is gulping in air and his hand comes clenching down into Cas’s hair. Cas feels satisfied; this is a trick he definitely didn’t have when he was a teenager.
“Thank you,” the teacher replied admiringly. Castiel cringed, but just hoped he flew under the radar.
alright, this chapter is on time, lets hope i manage to keep that up lol
“Well, you sure have a funny way of showing it.” Cas snapped, refusing to pay attention to the stutter in his heart at hearing Dean say he had missed him.
It wasn’t easy to keep Cas at arm’s length, when he desperately wanted to pull him closer. And Cas was not making it any easier by continuing to seek Dean out, no matter how obvious his excuses were. But it was better this way. Dean just wished, Cas would stop trying to talk to him.
Dean did not sleep well that night.
And by the time it had caught up to him, the kid had already left the room, mumbling a quiet “love you” (because he always did that, no matter how angry he was. He was a good kid) and closed the door behind him. Great. Trust Dean to not only hurt his best friend but also manage to make a literally ray of sunshine mad at him. Fuck.
“So, what is going on with you and Dean?”
“I promise.” He didn’t quite believe himself, but it had Jack relaxing against his side, so it must have been the right thing to say. Cas pulled his son closer and they watched Jack's cartoon.
Dean shrugged, “My mom died when I was a kid and Sammy was a baby. Dad’s been a trucker ever since. We just hop from hub town to hub town with him, sticking in motels until Dad finishes his route. And then we’re off to the next town… I don’t have time to join sports or get to know people, right? And I have to look after Sammy… That’s my
“Dean-” Castiel whispered before Dean swallowed his words. Dammit, he couldn’t help himself - Castiel was like a magnet. And Castiel must have felt somewhat similarly, because he was kissing Dean back. Dean cupped Castiel’s face, deepening the kiss as he felt Castiel move his arms around Dean’s topless torso.
“Ugh,” Dean murmured groggily. He’d only just gotten to sleep.
“The other night... I was scared that I’d done that to you,” Castiel’s voice was like a breath.
Cas takes the reins, “Hey Jack, how was your day at school?”
Dean looks away from Cas and chuckles along with Benny.
“I know.”
“Not doing so well since you've lost your boy toy?” Met asks in a mockingly sad voice.
“Well, are you alright?” Cas’s anger seems to transform to concern as he allows the distance to dwindle.
Dean swallowed thickly.
who will hire you, and then keep on truckin’ ‘til ya either keel over like your dad or actually run yourself off the side of a mountain?”
Raul nodded and got on all fours. Castiel gets into position behind him. As usual, Coach Singer didn’t have instructions for Castiel. Coach Singer readied them and then the whistle blew. Raul switched, and Castiel reswitched. He felt Raul try to crowd him - just as Castiel had done to Dean - but Castiel sweeps under Raul with his leg, flipping him over with a push of his hips. Raul was trying to push his hips up to push out of Castiel grip like Coach Singer had told him, but Castiel had Raul’s back on the mat. He was pinned, and Coach Singer called it.
Dean’s wrist burned as it slid against the smooth skin of Castiel’s forearm. Dean was watching his shaking hand, eventually getting it out from between his face and Castiel’s skin. Castiel muttered and sighed at the loss of the mass there. Dean looked from his hand to Castiel to make sure he hadn’t woken up from the movement, but Castiel just buried his face into Dean’s pillow.
Castiel snorted and Dean joined his laughter. They looked at each other, and then Castiel turned his head to look up at the trees above.
Castiel’s voice was louder now, a tear falling down, “To give you space! Because I didn’t want to drive you away… But it feels awful, and I miss you anyway.”
“Why didn’t you cool down?” Castiel cut him off.
He handed a plate to Anna and then took the other over to Dean. Handing it to him, he avoided Dean’s eyes as much as he could as he said, “Come on.”
“Okay, okay, one at a time. I’m game,” Dean exchanges the sandwich for the cereal with Jack. They settle on the countertop to eat as Dean asks, “Why don’t you call Cas ‘dad?’”
Dean had insisted on walking Castiel home once Ash got sick. Jo had made a snuff about it. She’d drunkenly complained that Dean had never wanted to walk her home. But when Ash had offered to take her in Dean’s place, head still draped over the toilet, she’d said she was quite alright by herself.
“I suggest you stuff it, jackass,” Meg replies coolly. Benny looks at her just as evenly. She continues with a smirk, “You really trying to piss off the owner of the only place in town that lets your sorry ass check in? Because you can sleep in your cab tonight. Oh, or are you headed for the tank again, y’think?”
Just as Castiel began to react to Dean’s kiss, Dean jerked away. Castiel gasped and opened his eyes wide to look at Dean’s face, still so close. Castiel stared at the blatant fear drenching Dean’s eyes. Even when Dean finally cracked a smile, trying to laugh it off, and moved his arms away, the fear remained.
Castiel was more than grateful, and a little surprised, not to find Dean in the locker room. He changed methodically. When he entered the gym in his uniform and warm up bottoms, he was even more surprised to find Dean and Coach Singer already there. They turned to him as he entered. Coach Singer greeted him, “Ah, there you are. Come on, let’s hustle. It’s Friday, ain’t it?”
“Oh, no, I thought he had his backpack,” Dean replied calmly.
“He was reserved, but really clever. Strong - we were on the wrestling team together and he was the star player - and really charismatic. Although, I guess he was a little awkward too,” Dean chuckles at the memories, rinsing off the bowls quietly.
Jack turns from the scooter to Cas, his brow furrowed, “It didn’t cost too much, did it?”
Dean pulled the singlet down past Castiel’s midriff, stopped by the sweatpants at his waist… And hooked on Castiel’s bulge. Dean’s hands continued down the muscle lines on Castiel’s pelvis until he was right next to Castiel’s cock, stretching the fabric of his singlet and sweatpants.
Jo chortled, “Holy crap, dude! Are you real?”
The pad of his thumb came up of its own volition and caressed the bottom lip. Dean’s eyes skimmed over the wide ridges and flushed tone through the dark. He was mesmerized over the tender skin, recalling how they had tasted. Castiel sighed against his fingertips.
“Me ordering a burger is going to ruin your life?” Dean asks innocently.
Dean glanced over his shoulder before he leaned down and quickly unzipped a small opening in the most accessible pocket of the bag. He slid the keys from the palm of his hands right into the opening. He zipped it back closed as he stood, slinging his backpack off his shoulder into the pile casually. Everything looked the same, and Dean was about to go join Ash when he heard the coach’s voice call out: “Dean, over here!”
Dean pushes in all the way and his voice croaks. Cas pushes his ass back, wanting nothing more than to have Dean cum in him as deeply as possible. Dean grunts and locks up.
The sun rises on the familiar route. Although his battered body has made it somewhat cumbersome to drive, Dean manages fine. In fact, he’s enjoying himself. Instead of being traumatized from driving ever again since the accident, it’s almost as if he has been craving getting behind the wheel once more. Anticipation slowly was mounting in his gut all along, just for this. Although the Impala isn’t a semi-truck, the classic model still feels better than ever as it cruises along.
Cas huffs a small chuckle, “It’s fine.”
Cas’s eyes bulge and his pulse accelerates. Fuck. It couldn’t be… But Cas already knows it’s true and his throat feels as if it’s being choked by some anonymous force. Cas’s brow relaxes and he tries to play it cool. He replies coldly, “Do I know you?”
