“Great, thanks,” John took the envelope and glanced at Sherlock, anxious to know what he was about to say. Sherlock’s expression was closed off, his eyes turned down toward the table.
I saw the dark circles of fatigue under his eyes, the blood on his shirt. “I think my dad’s a doctor and you're not.”
Maybe it was for the best, the extra time, since they had agreed not to rush things. It was the prudent thing to do, after all. He was well aware that it was a risk to go down this path with John again, his guarded heart wary. And yet… all the caution and reason in the world dissolved into dust when he was near John, his heart suddenly vulnerable and willing.
John sees the storm in Sherlock’s face and places a hand on Sherlock’s knee, trying to steady them both. “Tell me,” he whispers back.
John turned the pen round and round, recognizing the truth in Sherlock's words. He couldn't picture staying in one place, never having a taste of the larger world.
Sherlock rises to his feet and stands behind John, looks at himself in the mirror. He runs his fingers over his face as if testing the smoothness.
Suddenly it was November, a few days before classes dismissed for Thanksgiving break. Although John didn’t really understand the holiday, he was looking forward to a quiet week off.
When John wakes, he is alone in the bed. He wanders to the tiny kitchen and drinks a glass of water, still a bit foggy from the nap. He looks out the window toward the sea and spies a lone figure walking along the beach. He would know that lanky silhouette anywhere.
“Will do,” Hannah calls after him as he leaves. She turns back to Sherlock. “He’s trying so hard, poor thing.”
I didn’t really want a new mom or anything. I had Dad and Aunt Harry, and that was enough. Their parents had died before I was even born, so I didn’t even have grandparents. It’s hard to miss what you’ve never had.
John holds his gaze, gravitating to the shift in Sherlock’s attitude, his courage bolstered. “Smell, sight, sound,” his eyes drop to Sherlock’s mouth, “touch, taste…” He flicks his eyes back to Sherlock’s with a counter challenge. “We’re meant to be sensuous creatures, if you allow it.”
“Consulting work.” He put the cigarette to his lips, not offering any more details. “How long have you been a photographer?”
The faint hiss of the shower running nudged John from his reverie. He stood listening, imagining Sherlock naked, still groggy, stepping under the water, letting it stream over his rumpled hair and into his face, rivulets running down his arms and chest and thighs.
“It’s alcohol. It’s good enough,” John muttered, grabbing another glass as a caterer floated by. He pushed the image of sitting atop Sherlock’s chest out of his mind, fragments of a fantasized wrestling match tormenting him all afternoon. The urge to confront Sherlock physically had never been stronger, and John knew it was stupid, nothing but an immature, inappropriate reaction to a building frustration. He breathed in through his nose, then out. Calm, be calm...
John cups the side of Sherlock’s face to angle their mouths for a deeper kiss. The world narrows to this moment, to their warm breath, the gentle tug and release of Sherlock’s bottom lip, the way that Sherlock hooks his thumb under John’s jaw, pulling him back for more.
By the time I arrived at the door of 221B, I had imagined all sorts of terrible scenarios. Heart attack. Car accident. But why wouldn’t he be in hospital?
He pocketed the mobile and tucked the laptop sheathed in the envelope under his arm. He pushed into the street, automatically framing shots in his head, the promise of New York glowing hotly under his skin.
“Sorry, sorry,” John laughs, pulling the blankets up to their shoulders and tugging Sherlock to his chest. “That was mean.”
He knows Sherlock has not stopped taking risks. He’s seen the scabs on Sherlock's knuckles, the bruises on his ribs, the black eye and lacerations. He knows about the death threats and hate mail.
It wasn't that surprising, I guess. First of all, he was really busy, and second, having your wife leave you would probably ruin the whole idea of girlfriends and marriage.
“When I went shopping, I told the clerk I was looking for something like this.” Sherlock passed his phone over to John.
Sherlock takes his seat and glances at the side table that had fallen over earlier, idly wondering how the trick had been engineered. Then his attention freezes on the Scrabble board. “Did you do this?”
“Ah, there you are.” Sherlock sweeps into the room, sees John standing by the well-stocked table. He frowns, noticing the chill in the room. “Bit cold in here.”
“Of course not. You should know, however, that I play the violin when I'm thinking. And sometimes I don't talk for days.”
John turned onto his side and gazed at Sherlock, wanting to find the answers in his unguarded face. The long lashes and full mouth revealed nothing, their beauty both familiar and unknowable. A pang twisted at John’s heart, but he was unable to put a precise name to it. Regret? Sorrow? Grief?
“Well done.” Irene patted Mike’s arm. She turned back to John and Sherlock. “I’m sure you two will have a productive year, working so closely together.”
They finally arrived at the site -- worn foundations, a set of sunken steps, heaps of rubble that once formed a simple villa and a stable.
John can't resist the pale column of neck, trails his lips from ear to collarbone, backing Sherlock up against the sink so he can reach the sensitive skin. Practically wedged between Sherlock's legs, John can feel Sherlock harden in response through their thin cotton clothing, and his blood quickens.
They shared another private smile, John’s gaze lowering to the temptingly tight buttons of Sherlock’s shirt straining over his well-defined chest, only to be interrupted by a student knocking at the door. “Excuse me, Professor Holmes? Can I talk to you about my grade?”
Sherlock drew back, his mouth hovering above John's, taunting, tantalizing. John found himself straining upwards, lifting on his toes, a thin groan for more slipping from his throat.
“I bet you're hungry,” Dad said, lifting the pack off my back and setting it on a chair. I followed him to the sun-filled kitchen, passing through the sitting room and a makeshift study with two desks. It was obvious which one was Dad’s (neat stacks of papers, laptop closed, everything squared away) and which was Sherlock’s (piles of paper, microscope, something suspended in a jar of liquid). One wall was covered with case notes.
He glanced irritably at the newspaper, wondering what his mother was fussing about. The bold headline on the front page couldn't be missed:
When Sherlock finally surfaced back to the present, Molly was talking about the story that would be in all the papers. “What do you think the headline will say? ‘Man Bashed by Boomerang’?”
“Professor Holmes has a pet theory that the solution to a crime is never twins,” John continued. “Obviously, that’s just not true.”
Sherlock smiles as John squirms in his chair. How is it that he doesn’t know John’s middle name? He knows his laptop password, his slight fluctuations in weight, how he folds his shirts and takes his coffee…
He dipped his mouth to Sherlock’s forehead in a light kiss, breathing in the scent of his hair, closing his eyes, beginning a farewell, letting a few hot tears sting and fall.
“Maybe you and Dad should move in together when you're really old,” I suggested helpfully. “You know, to take care of each other. Because what if I get a job that's far away and Aunt Harry moves or something? I could come visit you both.”
Want. The yearning to touch and be touched, to fold into one another, breath suspended between lips -- sensations he’d experienced long ago, rarely remembered, dormant until John woke something in him, stirred by the soldier’s stance, the doctor’s skill, the writer’s imagination, defying all logic.
John stood awkwardly, then stared at the white envelope again. Something about it bothered him, but he wasn't sure why. He continued to hold it, trying to examine it the way Sherlock would. The handwriting was neat, the strokes confident, maybe a feminine slant to it. The ink was deep black, perhaps from a fountain pen. He lifted the paper to his nose, sniffing the envelope as subtly as he could. Was there a trace of perfume?
We took a taxi back to Sherlock’s flat so Dad could monitor the unwilling patient. It was late, and Dad tucked me into the bed upstairs in the spare room. I knew it used to be his room when he lived here, and that made it feel familiar to me.
Sherlock dove under again, popping up next to John, then dunking him with a swift push. John bobbed up spluttering, his hair dripping into his eyes. “You wanker!”
I didn't blink, my senses seeming to pass through the thin panes. The stifling bedroom would smell musky, their sweat-slicked skin would taste of salt.
Time fell away in an instant, the desire as strong as it had been years ago, rekindled, burning now between them.
It took John a moment to snap back from his thoughts. He shook Dimmock’s hand. “Molly said you’d be coming later.”
Elizabeth gave a quick nod of her head, her eyes still on John, and Sherlock pushed the door shut, perhaps harder than necessary.
Afterward, they laid tangled together in the sheets, their chests rising and falling, shiny with perspiration. Sherlock turned to look at John, a smile forming on his lips, his gaze soft.
He returned to his room, then stepped onto the balcony to breathe in the sweet night air. He looked at John's door out of habit, his heart lurching at the unexpected yellow glow behind the thin curtains. Had he just come back? Or had the lamp been on all this time?
John, with gloriously rumpled hair, was wrapped haphazardly in the white bed sheet, clearly naked underneath. “Oh,” John waved dismissively at his choice of garment, “couldn’t find my dressing gown.” He craned his neck forward, eyeing the food. “Is that for me?”
He slouched into the library and slumped into a chair across from his mother. As she poured him a cup of tea, he grabbed three biscuits from a serving plate, earning a disapproving look.
He knew even Molly's friendship with them raised some eyebrows, people speculating whether he or Sherlock was her boyfriend. At the moment, that honor went to Constable Dimmock. Molly tried to make light of it, knowing that Sherlock didn't think highly of him. They occasionally had a drink as a group, John and Molly trying to keep Sherlock's little digs at Dimmock in check.
Sherlock gasped, his hand desperately working over his shaft. John pressed into his back, playing with his nipples, still undulating his hips, strangely empowered by the knowledge that his come was trickling down the inside of Sherlock's legs.
Maybe it's because they're outdoors, and although it's unlikely the neighbors will see or hear anything, John feels electric, alive, hungrily accepting the kisses that Sherlock bestows on his mouth in between leisurely strokes of their cocks.
Molly was something of an outcast herself. The other kids had whispered that she lived in a haunted house full of dead bodies and ghosts. She never seemed bothered by the taunts, honing a very practical yet quirky outlook on life.
John glanced at Sherlock, looking at his shadowed profile. He had the sudden urge to reach over and put his hand on his thigh, lean his mouth into that long neck. He looked away, trying not to tempt himself with thoughts that might not come true.
John looked up at the sound of the car slowing, his eyes narrowing when Sherlock pulled into the lane and came to a stop. Sherlock waited, the engine idling as John slowly walked toward him.
Sherlock’s eyes are growing heavy, pain medication dulling his wits. “You were never young,” he mutters, attempting a half-hearted insult.
Distracted, John answered as best as he could, his eyes constantly drawn to the masseur’s fingers pressing into Sherlock's flesh, every curve and slope of his body illuminated like a Renaissance painting.
Sherlock smoked, watching John interact, smiling, doling out his attention magnanimously, making everyone feel special. It was like watching a magician work. Only Sherlock suspected there was any sleight of hand involved.
“There was a blow to the back of the head -- right there.” She pointed, and Sherlock peered closer. A deep gash about three inches long matted with hair and blood was evident in the skull.
“No, I just missed it. My mum was always wringing her hands, worried I'd be called up. If it'd gone on another year… who knows? I might not be here.”
Sherlock lowers his phone. He doesn't know what to do. He only knows he can't lose John, and he will ruin it all if he doesn’t tread carefully.
They walked toward the hives, passing the stone fence that was crumbling in spots, and entered a small clearing where six white wooden boxes with pitched roofs stood in a rough circle. A few bees droned around them in the sunlight.
Sherlock takes a breath. “I promise to call you if I need anything,” he says, unable to admit anything more out loud.
Sherlock grasped his shoulders, kissing him back without inhibition, his tongue lapping into John's mouth. Their kisses gradually grew less heated, slowing to nips and nuzzles, fingers brushing down necks and chests.
“I was a consulting detective. Took cases no one else could solve, including Scotland Yard. Shocking, really, how poorly trained forensic units are these days. No observational skills, no ability to make deductions based on the evidence right in front of their noses. I was doing rather well until I cocked it all up.”
I nod obediently, unable to refuse. I start the fire and take a seat in my usual spot, picking up a nearby book and thumbing through it without absorbing a word.
“I don't know how one person can accumulate so much rubbish,” John sighed, discouraged. “She says she wants to clear everything out, but then puts up a fight over tossing anything.”
“Lovely job,” his father said, nodding toward the flowers. “I think we’re done for the day, don’t you?”
Sherlock wrinkles his brow at John, who has been out of sorts all day. Sherlock wonders if he has done something to anger him. He thought John might enjoy this little adventure, ridiculous as it is, looking for ghosts.
John shook his head, laughing with a bit of resignation, marveling at Sherlock's obtuseness. "It's... fine." He stirred, and they watched the rice ever-so-slowly release its starch. "At least make yourself useful, will you? Grate some cheese onto a plate. I've got to keep stirring."
Sherlock tended to avoid the sun, burning in a short time if he was not careful. The burn eventually calmed to a light brown with sprinkles of freckles across his cheeks and arms, which somehow seemed childish compared to John’s bronzed torso.
They really should be out investigating the murder they'd driven halfway across the country for. They were in a tiny village in a tiny room rented from a half-deaf landlady, but the bed was large, covered with soft quilts and pillows. There was probably a razor to be had somewhere within 30 miles, but after three days, it seemed pointless.
“I know it's not the Continent like you wanted,” Mrs. Holmes said quickly. “But a trip to the city might be a nice change before the term starts. Go to some galleries, enjoy the theater.
They were probably going to a dance or the cinema or some nonsense. Nothing he cared about. He smoked the cigarette down to a nub, ignoring the flicker of envy that licked at his ribs.
John regretted the petty insults that he'd hurled in frustration. If he was honest with himself, he could overlook the arrogance (Sherlock was undeniably brilliant), accept the orders (he'd been a soldier, after all), but accusing Sherlock of lacking emotions… that had been a low blow.
John slides his thumb up and down the side of his glass. Sherlock can tell he wants to say something, but is holding back.
When his knees are parted and pushed slowly toward his chest, he understands. His breathing quickens again, his pupils dilating, knowing that John is standing at the edge of the bed while he lies naked before him, his entrance stretched and waiting.
They lay there, silent, basking in the afterglow, the sun setting. Sherlock couldn’t help but imagine what they must look like from a bird’s-eye view. Disheveled, half undressed in a circle of flattened grass, utterly spent. A low laugh shook him.
He was working almost constantly now, both for private clients and for Scotland Yard, and occasionally Mycroft, investigating burglaries, affairs, kidnappings, extortion, murder -- the full gamut of unsavory human behavior.
At that moment, Mrs. Turner appeared with a fresh tea tray. Sherlock pulled a chair closer to the low table, and John followed suit, looking like he might like to pick a fight.
It was just for the summer, he reminded himself, trying to quell the spike of resentment he felt. His mother needed him, he told himself guiltily. His father was finally dead, his sister Harriet was useless, and his mother was an aimless, nervous wreck. She needed someone to look after to give her a sense of purpose, and he needed to look after her.
She begins to explain the characters and storyline, and Sherlock slides deeper into the pillows. Molly’s leg is innocently warm next to his, the bed an island of comfort in a cold blue ocean.
Still, if it made John happy to exchange gifts, he would play along. Sherlock scribbled on the paper and folded it in half.
“And your leg...?” Sherlock doesn’t wait for an answer, quickly realizing that the limp is completely psychosomatic. “Interesting.”
“Right, so,” emboldened, John continues, the storyteller in him taking over. “Vampires lure their victims in with hypnotic charm, drawing their prey closer, their power irresistible as they flatter and seduce. They maneuver their victims to a private place where they won’t be disturbed, dripping honeyed words, brushing their fingertips down a tender neck...”
Mycroft pursed his lips. “You're 27 years old, Sherlock. It's time you grew up.” He opened his mouth, about to say more, then resisted. He shook his head and vanished down the stairs.
The rest of dinner is strained, charged with a strange current of unspoken words. They talk about safe things -- a recent murder case, an opportunity for John to give a guest lecture on emergency medicine at Bart's.
He taps the spoon angrily against the edge of his cup. He failed to protect John, although he managed to get him back to the flat where they could treat the wound and avoid any police involvement.
“I remember thinking I had to stay awake to take care of that boy. But I couldn't do it. I blacked out.” John shook his head slowly. “When I came to, I was back at the post, bandaged up. We lost three men.”
The canopy was partially open, allowing a view of the night skyline. The driver clicked his tongue and they started off, the horse’s hooves clopping steadily as Sherlock draped a blanket over their laps.
John turned his attention to Sherlock's trousers, nimbly undoing the fly, easing the waistband down past sharp hipbones, the taut skin too tempting not to kiss. He eased the black trousers down further, exposing the bulge of Sherlock's erection straining against black pants. John helped remove the trousers, shoving them carelessly down to the foot of the bed.
“There's a dance tonight at the social hall. Aunt Helen and I were asked by the refreshment committee to make some cakes. Would you take them there this evening?”
“Well, that's two people.” He moved several pieces around the board according to our own made-up rules. “Besides, some of us are better off alone.”
Raindrops streaked down the window pane. John's wounded shoulder ached and he turned again, trying to find a more comfortable spot. What had happened to those daring, ambitious young men they had once been? When had they become so jaded, so guarded?
Sherlock’s eyes darken almost imperceptibly, a faint color shading his cheeks. They stand facing each other, cold air swirling off their coats, on the edge of something happening.
He looked at me over the top of his glasses. “Because I've had an inquiry from a publisher, believe it or not. Apparently, someone might want to read about this.”
Sherlock ran a fingertip along the spine of the book he'd been leafing through. “Tropical diseases?”
Sherlock stared at the sky, flooded with uncertainty, wrestling with every ounce of his inexperience. He didn't want to appear foolish or prudish -- but he simply wasn't sure what he wanted, much less what he was supposed to do. When John's head was lingering above his waistband, should he have touched him? And where -- his shoulders, his hair? How should he position his legs? And what about the next part -- who should undo the trouser buttons? What did one do with braces? And managing the drawers -- ?
John paused under the shade of a tree along the shoreline, trying to sort out his thoughts. He'd been instantly smitten before -- a coy smile, a shapely figure, a certain walk -- all had riveted his attention for a few hours or days or weeks. Inevitably, though, the initial infatuation cooled.
“On another subject,” Mrs. Holmes segued, “I wanted to ask if that young man you’re acquainted with might be able to help out with a project.”
“If the weather’s good, we can harvest another batch tomorrow,” Mr. Holmes offered. “You might find it interesting.”
He watched Holmes draw out a cigarette and place it between his shapely lips, the lighter flame illuminating the planes and angles of his face beneath a week’s worth of stubble. His eyes shifted colors in the low light, his lashes long and dark. God, he was stunning.
Sherlock’s eyes flick down, illuminated a beautiful sea blue-green by the screen light. He speaks. “What is something you’ve always wanted to do but were too afraid to?”
“I'm aware of that, Mother.” Sherlock intoned, spinning away from the window in agitation. He caught sight of John and rolled his eyes, shrugging helplessly. “Yes, I know. … Yes, I've already said three times that I'll be there. … Oh God, must we do that again?”
Sherlock looks up into John’s eyes. “I know about restlessness. And loneliness.” He buries his face in John’s neck, not wanting to think about the future, of losing each other again. “We’re cursed, aren’t we?”
Such direct praise from his mother was a rarity, and it caught Sherlock by surprise. “Thank you. But I prefer dabbling with my chemicals.”
Sherlock smiles slightly. “It is Halloween, after all. Isn’t this the type of thing that happens in all those horror movies?”
John sensed that neither one of them wanted to spend the holiday alone, two Englishmen adrift in a foreign land.
“In very simple terms, there are sensory receptors in our mouths that respond to menthol -- but interestingly, these same receptors also respond to low temperatures,” Sherlock explained. “The receptors can’t distinguish between true cold and menthol; they simply signal ‘cold,’ thus making mint feel cold.”
John continued to stare, taking in the sight of Sherlock in jeans and a heavy knitted jumper, the soft folds of the turtleneck framing his sharp jaw, the light color of the yarn contrasting with his dark hair that had been significantly shorn. He looked so different, and still so staggeringly attractive.
John carefully bends back Sherlock’s bad knee, dots a line of slow kisses down his inner thigh, making Sherlock hitch and sigh.
John casts his gaze around while Sherlock goes directly to the chair by the fireplace. Within seconds, he produces the missing phone from between the cushions.
I gripped onto Sherlock's hand, which was strong and boney and giant compared to mine. Dad dabbled on the laptop, kindly pretending not to notice my lack of talent. I practiced doggedly until it started to feel less like an awkward lumbering and more like a fluid dance. Sherlock was an excellent lead, which helped.
John gasped when Sherlock pushed him down onto the sofa. He grunted when Sherlock straddled his lap with one swift move, the dressing gown billowing behind him like a cape, the silk on his shoulder still askew. He sighed when Sherlock leaned down to kiss him, tongue slipping between their lips.
“The hiker’s family will be relieved to know what really happened,” John said as they began walking back to Sherlock’s car.
“It was perfectly civil. His career took him down one road, and I followed another. We parted ways, just like you and I did. History does tend to repeat itself.” He stopped talking, his brain catching up with his rambling mouth. His fingers gripped the cup. “And now I just want to concentrate on
After all these years together, after all the intimate touches and whispered words of passion, the fights and squabbles and shared adventures, there seemed little point in giving each other trinkets. Their devotion was imprinted on each other’s bodies, invisibly tattooed through sex and tears and laughter, hearts racing in danger, feet flying in pursuit, fingers curving around thighs in the middle of the night.
The corner of John's mouth quirked up suggestively. “Quite right… just think of the things those hands might get up to.”
“Well, then, I’m glad I have my nice cozy room downstairs and you have the big bedroom upstairs with that awful stain on the floor.”
He rubs his face, thankful to avoid the Holmes Christmas this year. His parents are on a cruise, a gift from Mycroft. Sherlock smiles wryly, knowing Mycroft deliberately scheduled the trip to fall during the holidays. His big brother occasionally has moments of genius.
“Should you like to repay the compliment…” John hinted, placing a finger on Sherlock's lower lip, “I'd be most obliged.”
“You take it black, if I remember correctly.” Sherlock handed him a mug, then crawled back under the sheets next to John.
As Sherlock paid the bill, John grabbed two peppermint candies from a bowl placed near the door. John handed one to Sherlock and they unwrapped the cellophane, popping the red and white mints into their mouths.
“Well, some traditions have their merit,” Sherlock admits, then glances away. “It’s not the largest tree…”
John licks and fondles and teases, driving Sherlock mad. He bites his bottom lip, groaning half in pleasure, half in frustration. His cock is hard, leaking. He finally can’t bear it anymore.
The white shirt rustled to the floor and John looked hungrily at Sherlock. His bare chest was sculpted in the lamplight, a relief of muscle and veins and sparse coarse hair and dusky pink nipples. The tension mounted tenfold in two heartbeats.
“Yes, John. Even I could use a little vacation now and then.” Sherlock paused. “Unless you have a pressing reason to get back?”
He pushed himself out of his chair and paced around the room, lifting a few objects here and there as if searching for something. As I followed him with my eyes, I noticed things -- the brand of coffee Dad liked tucked onto a kitchen shelf, a pair of Dad’s boots by the door, one of his cardigans hung up on a peg, a stack of his journals on the table. Little signs that led me to believe Dad had been spending quite a bit of time here during my year away.
John looked at the honey, smiling wistfully. “Maddest decision I ever made. Kissing you in that field full of bees.”
It was too much to catalogue, breath mingling, noses touching, eager lips and tips of tongues, a simmering of floral and spice, smooth cheek and rasp of stubbled jaw, hands stroking and sensing.
Sherlock turned back to the case wall. For a few moments, Mycroft's companionship had been almost welcome. It was invigorating to discuss a case with someone else, bouncing off ideas and considering new angles. Maybe having a flatmate wouldn't be so terrible…
The next few hours pass in a blur of strobing blue lights, yellow police tape, a corpse in a black trench coat and Louboutin stilettos, a mad dash across the city pursuing a clue that leads to a loading dock and crates filled with cheap ceramic elephant figurines. Sherlock pockets one to analyze later, then drags John to a several unsavory locations to slip cash and a folded note into the hands of numerous homeless people.
“Sure.” John didn't mind the thought of having him alone for a few minutes. "Follow me." He led his guest to an inner courtyard where the music was muffled to a dull roar.
Sherlock looked closer, trying to read John's reaction, but John disengaged his hand, turning his face away.
The next day they enjoy a late breakfast, walk a bit around the city, browse a bookstore, have a coffee, take a rest to ice Sherlock's knee. In the evening, they dine in a dim restaurant, then find a bar boasting an impressively long list of whiskeys. They can't help but sample several varieties.
John’s gaze drifted to Sherlock's mouth, drawn to their bruised beauty, wanting to taste them again, wanting permission to touch him, to slip his hand around the nape of his neck and pull him close.
Sherlock glides silently across the deep carpet, the smell of wood polish and tea and wool overcoats lingering in the air of the silent club.
Sherlock tracked John's movements as he circled the Vauxhall, skimming his fingers along the curved back fender. “It's a sweet car,” John said with admiration.
“We’re here!” John shouts back. “The door won’t open — the lock’s jammed.” He smooths down his disheveled hair, cursing their bad timing.
Mycroft glances up, surprised to see him awake, then looks ruefully back at his cup. “I doubt I could tell the difference.” He takes another resigned sip and walks over to a chair, sliding it closer to the bed. He sits and folds one leg neatly over the other. “How are you feeling?”
They lie curled together, lost in their own thoughts for several minutes, then John slips from the bed to fetch a damp flannel to clean up with. When he returns to the bedroom, Sherlock is missing, along with the sheet.
“I did, didn't I?” Mycroft mused. “It was sound advice.” He paused, looking down at his feet. “I haven't always offered you the best counsel when it comes to matters of the heart. I'm pleased things have worked out for you.”
John swallows, noticing Sherlock's pale skin stretched tautly over his breastbone, the curved dip of his lower back, the pajama bottoms riding low on his hips. What if, somehow, his own suppressed emotions have fueled this entire situation, leading up to this moment?
He entered the short hallway, passed by the bathroom, walked through the kitchen and into the sitting room. Maybe he would do some unpacking until he got tired.
“Sorry!” John snapped in frustration. He took a deep breath, adjusted his leg, tried again. “Better?”
“Well, then. Get in.” Sherlock swung his legs up and slid over to the passenger seat, acting more confident than he felt.
“What else would you suggest?” Mycroft asks in his most reasonable tone. “Shall we set you free like this, weak as a newborn kitten? You’d be torn to shreds in no time.”
He squints and sees John, who is clearly livid. Sherlock sags back into the pillows, dreading the inevitable conversation that is coming.
“Then you won't mind if I look over there.” Sherlock nods toward a group of shirtless young men passing a football back and forth, their well-defined abs and shoulders flexing with each movement.
John had stolen a few glances at him, trying to get a sense of where they stood after several days of silence. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking, but Sherlock had not told him to go, or that he did not wish to see him. Maybe Sherlock had chosen to pretend the kiss had never happened and just didn't want to discuss it. Despite the strange circumstances, at least they now had a few moments alone together.
There had been soft kisses and hard kisses, dry brushes of lips and wet probes of tongue, licks and laps and nuzzles and bites, fingers tugging and stroking and circling… a universe of sensations. And he had started it all with a simple lean forward and a hungry curiosity, unable to resist a second taste of John's mouth.
But when his eyes fell on Sherlock's tapered fingers, another wave of doubt flooded his system. Leaving Sherlock was going to be difficult, more so than he'd ever imagined. He tamped down the thought, forcing himself to keep things light. “You never bore me.”
Maybe it was foolish, crushed up against the wall, groping, wanting to touch everywhere, kissing breathlessly. Maybe it was a desperate bid to recreate the past, falling into bed, half undressed, John astride him. Maybe it was a hopeful grasp at the future, John’s familiar taste curled on his tongue, their bodies entwined. Or maybe it was just now, just enough, to be tangled together in the sheets again.
Billowy flakes sifted down from the black sky, clinging like cotton on tree branches and stems, melting like silent raindrops on the glass roof.
“What if I were a vampire?” Sherlock murmurs, not sure if he’s teasing or flirting or still caught in the story.
Sherlock tugged his lower lip, staring out the window at the people below. Everybody rushing about, going to lunch, having a smoke, completing errands before returning to their dull jobs selling insurance or running shops or, in John’s case, touching people.
John looks up with a smile as Sherlock enters, his bandaged leg stretched out on the bed. Sherlock hands him a mug and sits on the edge of the mattress.
John watched their reflection in the opposite mirror, the image of their greedy hands and churning hips turning him on even more.
John held Sherlock's face in his hands, gazing into his eyes. “I knew it, the very first day I saw you. You were standing under a tree, all mysterious, dressed in white, smoking. I knew you were something special.”
He looks up quickly, swears he sees a flash of green melting away in a corner, thinks he hears a rustle of stiff silk.
Their eyes meet unexpectedly in the mirror, and they're caught, a glimmer of unguardedness passing between them.
“Souvenir. Might never see you in a jumper again.” John pressed the button, capturing the moment. He paused, admiring the photo: Sherlock, clear eyed, stared boldly into the lens, yet held something back, his fingers brushing a phantom lock of hair from his eyes.
“I mean --” John grips his glass again, trying to get the words out. “I've seen things I can't explain. Not just tonight. In the past.”
“You’re in a good mood these days,” Mike said over the clanking of dishes and hiss of the espresso machine.
“Thanks.” Sherlock ends the call and opens the photo. He gazes at it for a long time. It is, without a doubt, the same young man from the group photo. Dark wavy hair, high cheekbones, haughty expression. William Holmes. It’s like looking into a mirror.
Sherlock nearly choked at the unintentional implication and coughed into his hand, trying to banish all thoughts of kneeling before John's swollen cock bobbing enticingly in front of his mouth.
Dad sometimes had to travel to conferences, so I would stay with Aunt Harry. She had a comfortable couch that I would snuggle into and drift to sleep listening to an old black-and-white movie with the sound turned low. I liked having the TV on in the background; it filled the silence with a comforting murmur.
“And frankly, it pisses me off,” Sherlock continued, sounding more like his usual self. “You’re the last person I expected to be attracted to. It’s insane.”
In the mirror that morning, John had noticed the silver threaded through his hair, the lines along his forehead, the bags under his eyes. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. Nothing you could do about the passing years. He elected to forego shaving, embracing the holiday spirit with a scruffy beard.
“Stop it, both of you.” Sherlock meant to add something rude, but couldn't think of anything clever. He laid his head down on the table instead.
In another ten minutes, they spied a well-trodden area near the stream. Exchanging a look, they agreed that must be where the hiker had been discovered. As they slowly approached, an uneasy heaviness filled John’s stomach. Death carried a weight to it, especially a sudden and violent one like the hiker had experienced.
“Theoretically, about 85. But my parents would disown me if they ever found out I tested that for myself.”
The old pipes rattled and groaned as the hot water splashed into the tub. Sherlock winced at the noise filling the tiny bathroom, his hands fumbling at the buttons of his shirt, fingers clumsy with fatigue.
John held him close. “I'm happy here. The sun, the water…” he touched Sherlock’s bottom lip with a fingertip, “you.”
He ran a hand over his beard and rubbed out the kink in his neck. He'd fallen asleep with his head jammed against the side of the plane, dreaming.
I didn't want to see the film anymore. I didn't want to face my dad or Sherlock. I texted Emma and cancelled our plans, then immediately texted Matthew, a guy I knew from school. He was on the boys’ swim team, and we were friends, maybe a little bit more. We'd messed around a few times, snogging at a party and in an equipment room by the pool.
John’s fingertips crept toward Sherlock's, his own confession spilling out. “I was starting to worry that I wouldn't hear from you again. That you'd disappeared.”
Sherlock flopped into his chair with a groan. “Christmas. The annual family gathering. A week away from London. It's hell.”
They’ve learned things about each other over the past five years of intimacy, things they like, where they're ticklish, what’s pleasurable and what's not.
John glanced up at Holmes, not certain he'd heard him correctly. If he had... well, then, that changed things. His hopes renewed, he locked onto the other man’s gaze, and he felt it again, that spark crackling in the air between them. It was thrilling, the hint of danger that clung to this mysterious stranger’s every move.
He ran his hands over Sherlock's narrow hips, admiring his lean and muscular form, letting his fingers dent into the unexpected plumpness of his arse. Sherlock's cock jutted out, suspended between them like the stamen of an exotic lily.
For any history buffs out there, I did base John's military assignments around actual events and battles (but took a lot of liberties).  And in case you need to see John in his uniform:
John raises his eyes to the damp tendrils of Sherlock’s hair. He’s never wanted anyone so much in his life, every fiber of his being aching to twine and meld with Sherlock’s.
“Should we go down to the dock?” John finally suggested, his limbs warm from the liquor and wanting to move.
Sherlock shrugs. “Not so young, either.” He leans down to fish a smooth rock out of the water and skips it over the waves. “Maybe, some day, I'd like to live by the sea.”
Exactly what a spy would say, John mused. He was British, maybe hired out to the CIA or some sort of intelligence agency. Whatever he did, it was off the radar.
“No!” Sherlock barked out. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice. “Leave the tags on… please.”
Just then the waiter arrived, interrupting their tête-à-tête. Sherlock pulled away to concentrate on the wine, then peppered the waiter with questions about the menu.
“Really?” John’s brows go up in surprise. He was expecting something dark and mysterious like patchouli.
Sherlock slides deeper into his chair, his knees bumping comfortably into John’s. He tries to regain his composure, getting ready for the next question.
Mr. Holmes gave the car one last wipe, then stepped back to admire his work. “Want to take her out for a spin sometime?”
He turned the lighter around in his fingers. “It goes far back, before you were even born. The moment I met your father…” he shook his head distractedly, remembering. “There was something there. I tried to deny it, didn't want it clouding my judgement, interfering with my work… But I felt it anyway. So did your dad.
“John…” Sherlock sighs his name, melting under John’s weight as they sink entangled to the floor, John’s mouth worshiping his neck. He curves a hand over John’s arse, smiling to himself, remembering the tattoo, knowing he’ll see it very, very soon.
He trailed off, but Sherlock could predict what John was trying to say, so he said it for him. “I shouldn't wait for you.”
He closed his eyes, relishing the sensation of being in John, of John being in him, an unbroken circle of fingers and holes and mouths and cocks, giving and taking and giving again.
Sherlock was dubious about this visit, but ventured past the door anyway, closing it behind him. John took a seat in a chair by the table while Sherlock glanced around at the sparse bed sit.
“Something like that,” Sherlock replied vaguely, smiling over at John, who was standing obediently as the tailor measured his back.
Furious at Mycroft, more so at himself, he walked quickly back into the house, blindly heading to his room, slamming the door. He tumbled onto his bed, burying his head under his pillows, wanting to disappear.
John cradles him close, his lips against his temple. “We'll find each other again. We’ll go to all your favorite places in London, just like we promised.”
He sat back slowly and downed the rest of his drink, then stood up. “Meet me on that corner in ten minutes.” He headed to the pharmacy, determined not to change his mind.
The first drops of glistening liquid are cold, soon warming under the friction of their hands. John shifts his weight, guiding Sherlock onto his back. He climbs on top, straddling Sherlock’s hips, bracketing his shoulders with his hands. He slowly rocks his pelvis, dragging his heavy cock and balls back and forth over the length of Sherlock’s thick shaft.
He cleared his throat, then slid the envelope closer with two fingers. He picked it up, glancing into the unsealed contents. Train tickets and a tidy stack of bills. He peered closer and knitted his brow. “There are two sets of tickets.”
In all honesty, he was glad those regimented days were behind him. He didn't regret his service, but the outcome was far from the glorious army career he had envisioned as a young man.
John was 24 and had studied in New York, recently earning a Master of Fine Arts in writing. He had published several successful stories in literary magazines. He was now working on a novel that Sherlock had quickly (and perhaps unfairly) mentally categorized under the ‘‘distant father, angry son” genre. It only occurred to him later that perhaps it was a memoir.
He let Victor to lead him back to bed, his mouth and fingers stroking him into a hazy state, lulling his agitated mind, until he eventually found sleep again.
They inhaled simultaneously, waiting for a hidden signal. It came in the form of breaking glass, some drunk asshole shattering a beer bottle against the stone wall below.
But then he heard a noise, a rhythmic rasping sound that he soon identified as a hand saw cutting through wood. It was coming from the back of the house. Driven by a strange curiosity, he followed the sound, keeping close to the side of the house. Hidden by the branches of a large lilac bush, he peered into the back yard, catching his breath at an unexpected sight.
“There!” Molly exclaims with satisfaction, looking around at the decorated morgue. “I think it’s about done. But maybe just one more thing.”
John is still sometimes awed to find that gorgeous mouth on his, amazed that he's permitted to wend his hand up that long neck and into those waves of dark hair.
His luck finally ran out on the weekend when he stopped into the office to print out a quiz for his class. John stood in the copy room, his mind wandering as he waited for the printer to collate and staple the papers. He didn’t see Sherlock reaching into the supply cabinet behind him until it was too late.
God, he wanted more, but he held back, pulling gently away, hazy, his blood singing. He looked into Sherlock's eyes. “That's what I wanted to tell you.” John’s voice was raspy, unfamiliar to his own ears. “One of us had to say it.”
His father opened the door and peered into the dark room. “Awake? Ah, good. There's a telephone call for you.” Mr. Holmes looked closer. “Are you unwell?”
Standing in the quiet kitchen under the fluorescent light, a sharp pang had pierced Sherlock's chest. John still hadn't texted or called, remaining stubbornly silent.
She hesitates, her lips pressing into a thin line. She glances at the television where a woman is dabbing tears from her eyes as two police officers question her.
John finally settled his scattered thoughts and focused on the strong hands of the masseuse. It felt good being touched. It had been a long time since he'd been physically close with anyone. Somewhere along the way he'd stopped dating, realigning his life to match Sherlock’s. It happened so gradually that he hadn't really noticed how much he'd changed since he moved in with Sherlock.
That he hadn't meant to be so harsh and dismissive? That he wasn't used to thinking about how his actions affected anyone else? That he wished John would come back?
His thoughts drifted back through the years to his family, to school and university, to the summer with Sherlock, to Mary and the years in India. He had loved and lost, and loved and lost again, and he had been tested, tasting success and failure, learning about the darkest corners of his soul. He had, to his sudden surprise, accumulated a life.
In a heartbeat, he decides. John switches off the fire and grabs his coat and scarf, shoving his feet into his shoes. He’s going to find Sherlock at the lab, and they’re going to spend Christmas Eve together.
He wasn't experienced in these matters; it was very likely he was leaping to baseless conclusions. His usual ability to read fine details was compromised, fogged by his own body's primal responses.
“Oh, God… more...” he begged weakly, now turning full control over to John. His hands slid from John’s head onto his own skin, stroking up his torso, fingers playing over his nipples, fueling the fire coursing through his veins.
Behind him, Sherlock also gazes into the night. He accepted long ago that John is always going to keep a thin but impenetrable wall between them. John's need for privacy and separate lives is rooted in concern for Olivia, and Sherlock has always understood that.
The next night it storms, the room snug against the cold rain lashing at the windows. The panes rattle and the eaves groan with gusts of wind.
They had known each other a long time, Dad and Sherlock. They'd worked together, lived together, and still saw each other regularly.
He wanted to flee the room, but was too afraid to place his feet on the floor, fearing something would snatch his bare ankles.
But then I heard a muffled bump coming from Sherlock’s bedroom. The door was closed. I instantly was 12 years old again, transported back to the morning I sneaked downstairs to use the bathroom and heard creaks and sighs coming from his room.
“He was reported missing in late 1918, and eventually presumed dead. However, he resurfaced in England several years later. The trail is murky -- records are missing. He was probably assigned to a special mission, deep infiltration, top secret and all that. Once back in England, he quit the service. Became a recluse, died alone. There’s not much more to tell.”
Sherlock’s hands curve possessively around John's flanks, his thumbs pressing into the sensitive skin of his inner thighs. He’s mesmerized by John's face, the dark lashes, the wrinkle in his furrowed brow, the soft space between his parted lips, a balance of tension and sensuality just before reaching climax.
“Everything’s so far away to Europeans,” John returned with a smile. He lifted the cigarette from Sherlock’s hand again, slower this time, their fingers brushing. “Sometimes things are closer than you think, if you just take a chance.”
They sat in silence, and John looked around Sherlock's boyhood room. Bookshelves lined with novels and textbooks, a wooden model of a sailing ship, seashells, a desk with a study lamp, a microscope, an old, sepia-toned map of London.
“I’ve been here a few months. Just getting resettled.” He didn’t elaborate, not wanting to go into details that would lead to unwanted questions.
John hooks a leg over Sherlock’s thigh, nestling their warmest bits together. “Let me make it up to you.”
They stand awkwardly on the pavement, and Sherlock tries to salvage the situation. “I could do with a bite to eat.” He glances at John. “I'll buy.”
They met in the foyer, pulling on their coats, deciding to slip out to the glasshouse. Their feet crunched across the frosty lawn, the night blissfully quiet, the white clouds of their breath hanging in the air. In the distance, the bees clustered in their hives, waiting for the winter to end.
The moment is crystalline, a delicate filament strung between them, one that John doesn’t want to break. He moves his mouth to Sherlock’s other shoulder, leaving a tender caress before taking a small step back, sliding his hands away.
“This is quite nice,” John said, running his hand over the curved back of a chair. “I’m a bit envious. My flat is so dull.”
John turned up his coat collar against the wind, waiting for Sherlock as he paid the cabbie. It was late, nearly midnight. He stifled a yawn as he fished the key to the flat out of his pocket.
Dun dun duuuunnnnnn. Who could the mysterious man standing behind John be??? Stay tuned for the next exciting installment!
John reached for his Leica, wanting to capture the hazy morning light, mussy hair, full lips, long legs. He stepped onto a chair for a high angle, full body portrait. He shot low: over a rounded shoulder, up a dune of hip, down to the flaccid cock nestled in a dark thatch of hair.
“What else were you planning to do tonight?” John asks, wedging the hand between two chemical bottles on a shelf. “Stay in and read a book?”
As a side note, I finally broke the 50k word mark with this posting, so I'm doing a little "woo hoo I made it!" dance right now. Thank you all for reading along!
He gallantly held out his arm, and after a moment of surprise, Molly took it and he swept her off to the dance floor.
John looked around once more. He owned very little, so was not concerned about the lack of space for his things. “This could do nicely.”
Perhaps he would ride his bike by John's house tomorrow evening. He didn't want to appear too eager, but he didn't want to seem like he was avoiding him, either. How on earth did people manage these things?
Ten minutes later they’re changed into soft pajamas, sitting on the sofa, so close their legs almost touch. On the screen, snow falls on a small town, the details of the story lost as their hips nudge together, their thighs sinking into the same seam between the sofa cushions.
“Relationships aren’t that easy,” Harry continued, seeing the doubt on my face. “Sometimes the timing is all wrong. And sometimes, even when you get it right, you mess it up anyway.”
He watched them ride away, still unnerved at how accurately Sherlock had read him. He pulled his gloves back on roughly and began to yank at weeds, cursing himself for leaving the flask within view. He'd cut back on the drinking, but sometimes he still needed a sip to calm his nerves.
As John gnawed unhappily on his thoughts, he was surprised to hear the distinct sound of an envelope ripping. So Sherlock decided to open the card after all. John held his breath, listening for some sort of reaction. There was, at most, a faint sniff.
John jingles the keys nervously as they make their way down the long, dim hallway, their footsteps echoing off the white walls. No one is around, the day shift over. John checks the number on the key again, then stops in front of a door marked with a brown placket: Storage.
The enticing scent of sausage and bacon drifted up the stairs as John made his way down to the kitchen the next morning.
They couldn't stop time, but they could try to prolong it, ignoring the vast expanse of ocean that would lay between them, the twists and turns of thousands choices and decisions that awaited them, the eventual drifting apart until they were bittersweet memories, eternally youthful faces in photographs that caused a pang of nostalgia for a long ago summer on the coast of Italy.
He flexed his left hand, trying to calm the tremor that rippled through it. London. His new home. Like so many other lost souls, he hadn't known where else to go.
“Put on your coat. I've just heard there's been another murder.” Sherlock, wild-eyed, his hair damp and curling from the rain, was standing by the table holding out John's jacket.
He changed into a white button-down shirt and looped the one tie he owned around his neck. His fingers felt thick as he fumbled with the ends, and he cursed as he undid the knot for the third time. He hated ties.
John laughs despite himself, knowing Sherlock is purposely lightening the mood, giving them a path back to easier territory. He’ll take the opening; there are only so many floods of emotion he can handle in a day. He's still recovering, regaining his footing.
Meanwhile, drop me a note, say hello, tell me what your prediction is for how this will turn out,  prod me to keep going, send chocolate or good gin...
Surprise and warmth flood through my chest. These are the most intimate words Sherlock has ever spoken to me. It’s a confession of his own, if I dare to read it closely enough. Emboldened, I gaze into his eyes. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”
“Neither can I. It's been a long time.” John paused again, a note of uncertainty in his voice. “I hope it's alright, calling you like this.”
For a moment, he's mortified. It seems like they've barely begun, and he's spent already. John pulls back a bit, and Sherlock has the irrational thought that he's getting up to leave, so he clutches at John's back, his body pulsing with a confusing mix of post-orgasmic bliss and sudden fear.
There was a gathering later at the Holmes’ house with many of the same people standing around with drinks and tiny sandwiches. I wandered along the edges of the room, nibbling on a piece of cheese while examining the bookshelves and photographs.
He glanced across the table at John, wondering what he might like as a gift. Leatherbound notebook? Mont Blanc pen? The latest iPhone?
The cushions bear their punishment of pounding hips and gouging knees with determined resiliency, springing back thrust after thrust.
John peered at him across the wooden table, his knees nearly touching Sherlock’s. “You do? What is it?”
Sherlock’s pulse quickens again as the words shift and take shape in his mind’s eye. How can it -- they -- whoever is responsible for this set of tricks possibly know about his closely guarded feelings for John?
Sherlock felt a hot flush creep up his neck. They entered a long, dimly lit building. The lights were thrown on, illuminating the vast space.
Sherlock often visited Molly now that she worked as a pathologist at St. Bart’s. She provided him with various specimens and let him examine corpses for clues, and he had subsequently charmed a few of her colleagues into letting him use the laboratory for some advanced experiments and analyses.
They walk along in a companionable silence, eventually letting the waves lap over their feet with cold, foamy water.
John curves his hands around Sherlock’s plush arse, smooth and downy like a ripe peach. He sinks his fingers into the flesh of his buttocks, enjoying the act of possession while simultaneously giving himself over to Sherlock’s dominating position.
There were books on botany and mathematics, cookbooks and chemistry and Chaucer. A framed faded photo of an Irish Setter puppy.
Sherlock entered the house, preparing himself for the awkward pain of making small talk with John’s mother and Aunt Helen. He'd met them a few times; John's mum seemed quiet and pleasant, but his great aunt glared at him like an angry hawk. He followed John into the kitchen.
Nevertheless, university life offered some degree of freedom and intellectual stimulation. Being forced to return to the family estate under a cloud of disgrace was humiliating.
“You look beautiful in the moonlight,” John murmured, brushing his fingertips over the dusting of freckles on Sherlock's cheekbones.
Sherlock nods innocently, knowing full well what she really may have heard. Part of him wants to tell her about John, to let her in on his extraordinary secret, but caution wins out.
The reassuring words help John focus, and he turns his attention to the task. He takes a breath, places a finger under Sherlock's chin to steady him, then lowers the razor against his left cheek. He finds a starting point and begins, a satisfying rasp rising from the trail the blades cut through the lather.
John paused, crossed his arms awkwardly, shifting his eyes to the side as if he wasn't sure what else to say. “Thanks for coming by.”
He reached out blindly, touching Sherlock’s shoulder, then found himself tugged forward, their faces suddenly very close. They searched each other’s eyes in the low light, reading and evaluating and hoping.
I glanced at the tacked up photos and clippings. “Is he still working on that one case -- the girl who disappeared 20 years ago?”
“The hell with you,” Sherlock whispered half-heartedly at Mycroft, trying to muster bravery as a cold fear slowly crept up his bed.
The semester finally ground to an end. The tests were graded, the final grades submitted, and students had fled campus again, leaving John with time to catch up on housework and mundane errands. Thanks to mutual avoidance, he hadn’t seen Sherlock since his sudden departure from the bar.
Sherlock shifts slightly, one foot extending back toward John. John adjusts his leg, the top of his foot brushing the bottom of Sherlock’s sole. So they’re cold, John thinks hazily. He nestles his feet under Sherlock’s, offering to share their heat.
I grinned into my cup. I loved seeing them together, the little barbs, the bickering, the subtle touches communicating the affection running under it all.
There's something primal about the leather scent hanging in the air. John's fingers brush against Sherlock's as his hand grasps the jacket, the brief contact of their skin sending another current through Sherlock’s body. Some deep part of him doesn't want John to leave. He doesn't let go of the jacket.
He glared as he approached, jabbing one warning finger at me before entering the headmaster’s office. “I had to leave work early. You and I,” he said evenly, “are going to have a talk.”
John stared at the grass, wondering if the dark patch he was looking at was dried blood. Compelled by a morbid curiosity, he crouched down and touched the stain. He turned over his fingertips -- dry. He lifted them to his nose -- no scent. Maybe it was nothing.
“God,” John breathed between kisses, “I was blind, wasn’t I? You’ve been trying to let me know for ages.”
Sherlock clutches at John's shoulder, his head tipping back, lips parted, voiceless until his body shudders and light bursts behind his eyes. John’s hands and mouth stroke him, empty him, soothe him.
Unable to think, John automatically consults his phone. His mouth is dry as he reads the next question aloud, the room seeming to tilt. “Do you currently have feelings for someone?”
Sherlock straightened his back, ran a hand distractedly through his hair. “You're right. I've been a thoughtless dick.” He turned away from John, training his eyes on the fireplace. “I haven't thanked you often enough. I haven't told you…” he faded out, struggling to finish the sentence.
John gazes up at Sherlock, content to be trapped under his lean frame. “Some things got solved, don't you think?”
“No, no,” John answered, trying to sound reassuring. “They’re just friends. And they quibble all the time, haven’t you noticed?”
He was gaining a reputation for solving crimes that had stymied the police, and his name was beginning to appear in the papers, a fact Mrs. Hudson enjoyed pointing out whenever she brought up tea.
It could have been noon or nine or midnight when the door opened with a soft click and creak. John didn't hear it, still fast asleep on his side. He didn't hear the slipping off of shoes, the trickle of the tap, the hushed footsteps across the carpet, the rustle of clothes draped across a chair.
Alarm threaded through Sherlock's chest, a warning that John was pulling away. But why was he acting like this? They still had time, days and days of it.
, only on John's eyes, the sheen of sweat on their bodies, the power of his hips rhythmically lifting and dropping.
He wishes John was here. He’d left that morning before John was even awake, taking the case on short notice. He’d scribbled a note and left it on the kitchen table, then rushed to the airport.
John sinks onto him, slicking their abdomens together, lowering his head into the crook of his shoulder.
John took another step, standing just a bit closer than was proper, the music muffled in the background. “I think we should go test that theory.”
Sherlock knew John was right. They still had bike rides and morning swims, long lunches and lazy afternoons, beaches and ruins, deep kisses and rumpled sheets.
John had to turn around to answer. “Yeah, I enjoy seeing the look of terror on students’ faces when I hand these out.”
“Here you go, dear.” Mrs. Hudson set the water on the bedside table and snugged the blanket around his feet.
At some point they traded places, Sherlock sinking into the mattress under John's weight, their mouths hot and urgent.
“Not in a long time.” The few times John had ever shaved another man was in Afghanistan. He had helped tidy up several wounded soldiers when the infirmary was short-staffed. The men had been grateful, glad to feel clean again. John is nervous suddenly, highly aware of the cramped space, their close proximity, the triple blades gleaming.
The corner of John's mouth quivers and he turns away, hiding the hot tears threatening to spill over. He blinks a few times, leans against the sink, takes a deep breath, overwhelmed by the rush of emotions. Deep down, he knows he wants more, but when, and how, to what degree… he can't yet answer.
John reads the words to himself, listens as Sherlock disjointedly describes their mysterious appearance.
God, this was agony. Here he was, imprisoned back in his childhood home for the next three months instead of traveling like he had planned. Other people his age were touring the continent, indulging in the decadent pleasures of Paris and Pamplona. Not that he had anyone to travel with… Still, he would have gone alone, made his way.
They kiss and stroke and take their time until Sherlock stretches out an arm to find the lube. The slippery liquid is cold at first, a bit of a shock, but Sherlock's hands are warm as he massages the lube onto John's thick cock.
Sherlock pressed his handkerchief against his lip, and they exchanged an agonized look filled with frustration. Sherlock lifted the handkerchief and glanced accusingly at the bright stain.
John shrugs, smiling. “I met some beautiful strange boys…” he trails off, remembering the young man with dark hair and soulful eyes clinging to the tall, square-jawed American. They were drunk, funny, and blatantly flirtatious. He laughs a little. “Maybe I should have gone with them. I might have gotten lucky.”
John applies a local anesthetic to Sherlock’s skin and threads up a suturing needle. He pulls on a fresh pair of gloves before starting. Experience has taught him that chatting helps relax patients, so he tries to think of an innocuous topic. His eyes land on Sherlock’s lower back and a sprinkling of moles dotting his fair skin.
They tread up the creaky steps and John sweeps into the sitting room, glancing around for his coat. Sherlock sees it first. He picks up the black jacket slung over the back of a chair. It's leather, weighty and supple. The rich scent reaches his nostrils as his fingers curl around the buttery collar. He holds it out to John.
He turned onto his side, gazing at the window. He allowed his mind to wander back to that summer long ago, back to the first time he and Sherlock had met. John smiled a little, remembering how ruthlessly Sherlock had assessed his character, instantly annoying and intriguing him.
Sherlock remained silent, knowing John was right but irrationally hating him for saying it out loud. He turned blindly away, unable to move his legs even though he wanted to flee.
They sit in a booth upholstered in burgundy faux leather, discussing the night’s events over savory noodles and crisp vegetables and smoky tea. John is relaxed, smiling more, the conversation turning personal as a single candle throws shadows onto the red tablecloth.
She puts down the knife she’s been using to chop vegetables and wipes her hands on a towel, impatient. “It’s got to be somewhere, hasn’t it?” She stomps off toward the library.
John doesn't want to know what he was jumping off of or why. “Well, your body’s not as young as it used to be.”
Sherlock’s eyes searched his face, and John paused, taking in the heady scent of smoke and sweetness of clover, the dewy beads of perspiration on Sherlock’s upper lip, the dampness of his hair, the hum of bees thrumming in the air.
John absently turned the phone in his hands. “I like the human you. The one in his dressing gown that drinks tea with Mrs. Hudson. The one who talks back to the telly and leaves biscuit crumbs on the table. The one with messy hair on Saturday mornings.”
I was seven-and-a-half years old when I was nearly expelled from school for punching a boy who called me a liar. I was quickly hauled to the headmaster’s office and made to sit on a hard metal chair to await my punishment.
John found his mouth again, delivering a series of soft kisses, enough to taste the salt on Sherlock's skin, feel the warmth of his breath, lingering on the plushness of his lower lip.
What the hell…? The messages were from Sherlock. I sat up and tried calling, but it immediately went into voicemail. I dialed my dad; again, voicemail. What were they thinking, not answering their bloody phones?
“Did l? Oh yes, ripped the knees out on that kidnapping case... pity.” Sherlock plucked a roll from the basket. “What will you do this morning?”
The glow of the colored fairy lights strung around the kitchen window cast a rainbow of mottled light on Sherlock’s bare back, almost as if he’s underwater. John notices this strange effect as he carefully wipes the blood from Sherlock’s shoulder blade with a cotton pad soaked in antiseptic.
John lifted up on his toes to place a lingering kiss on Sherlock’s lips, smiling as he spoke a wicked thought out loud. “This velvet feels so nice… I think you ought to wear it when I have you spread out on our bed tonight.”
The scar. John resisted turning away, trying not to be ashamed of the ugly bullet wound marring his skin. He took a steady breath and let Sherlock look.
“And now we wait,” Sherlock says with satisfaction, leading John down a narrow alley toward a main road. He looks over at John, whose expression has been constantly shifting between awe and befuddlement.
John took a breath and went on. “We leave for India in February. We’ll be posted at a base outside of Bombay. There's a hospital there; I'll be doing more training in surgery. Probably treating some routine stuff too. After a year, if everything goes well, I'll be promoted to captain.”
The contact with Sherlock’s skin seemed to slow John's enthusiasm for getting out of bed, his lips lingering far longer than necessary.
When I crept into my house late the next morning, I mumbled a hello to Dad and locked myself away in my room.
Sherlock had to look away, tempted by the curved muscles in John’s arms, the fuzz on his chest, the way the sheet barely covered his groin. He stood up, conscious of his own nudity, further distracted knowing that John’s eyes were trained on his bare backside.
Sherlock grunted again, an utterance of pleasurable pain. Oh God, he could picture Sherlock's hips tilting back, thighs quivering, slowly taking in more rock-hard cock -- John squeezed his eyes shut, cutting of the enticingly explicit fantasy. The rush of blood to his groin made him bite his lip, trying to keep his erection at bay.
Even if he were miraculously able to find a position near Sherlock's university, there would still be innumerable obstacles to their relationship. And there was no guarantee that what they had would last.
“An old army mate sent me this,” John explains, embarrassed. “It’s from our first post in Afghanistan. Seems like a million years ago…”
could make him nervous and unsure. The knowledge emboldened him to capture Sherlock’s mouth again and slowly slip his tongue between his lips, drawing out a soft moan.
John stared back blankly, then it dawned on him, the weighted possibility of what Sherlock was suggesting. John rose to his feet, his knees weak, his pulse beating faster.
Strains of Mozart threaded through Sherlock's head the next afternoon as he spread a thick layer of mulch in a flower bed. After a long search last night, he’d finally found his violin tucked away in a closet along with numerous folders of sheet music.
He felt himself swaying closer, certain Sherlock was turning toward him, leaning down, his lashes low, the dismal alley fading, their breath uneven, their lips mere centimeters apart.
John reached for Sherlock, sweeping the dressing gown from his shoulders, the blue silk pooling on the red wool rug. Both exposed, there was a silence as John gently touched Sherlock's cheek.
The knife clatters onto the worktop and John snaps his head up. He pushes his chair back and crosses quickly to Sherlock's side. “What happened?”
After that, he barely knew what he was doing. One moment he was flirting with Sherlock by the car, then nearly insulting him, ignoring him, needling him, prying into his private life -- but, God, he wanted to know if there was a girlfriend, or anyone…
By the time we arrived at the emergency department, Sherlock was patched up and looking very disgruntled about the whole situation. He was perched on an exam table with his sleeves rolled up, his left hand cradling his bandaged forearm.
Thanks again for your patience as I slowly post, and here's a thousand roses for you for following along!
It was a smoky blue t-shirt, almost grey, the cotton worn quite thin. The shirt managed to hang both loosely and tightly on Sherlock’s frame, a contradiction that intrigued John over his breakfast. It was loose around the collar and sleeves, tight over his chest and torso, just a tad roomy again at his waist where his striped pajama bottoms were tied low on his hips.
Sherlock warmed to the idea, already knowing that he could convince his parents to pay his way, a last fling before starting university. They might even cover the cost of a fine hotel.
This time a shadow wavered across the window and the drapes drew back. John took in a sharp breath when he recognized the angles of Sherlock’s face. John stepped into the wan light and waved an arm, smiling when he saw the surprise on Sherlock’s face.
Gathering the shreds of his confidence, Sherlock shifted to his side as John relaxed down into the grass. He bent low and found John's mouth, his fingers venturing to John's top button. His technique wasn't as sure as John's -- he'd never undressed anyone before -- but he managed to fumble open the first two buttons of John’s shirt.
Sherlock glowered at Mycroft with all his eight-year-old might, throwing daggers with his eyes. He hated it when their parents went out, leaving Mycroft in charge. And Mycroft knew how much Sherlock hated the cross stitch gift Great Aunt Violet had sent him for his last birthday. Sherlock dimly recalled her boney old fingers and drafty Victorian house that smelled of cat pee and boiled cabbage.
Sherlock knows he’s referring to more than bringing the phone. He places his lips on John's shoulder, hoping to convey something beyond words. He would walk through fire for John, and for Olivia. They are an unlikely triad, with John as the pivot point. “Of course.”
John wants to touch his curls, smooth them back from his forehead. He allows himself to imagine what it would be like to wake up next to Sherlock, to press a sleepy kiss on his shoulder, to turn and gather him in his arms, pulling him against his chest.
John had his thumbs hooked casually through his braces layered over a pale blue shirt. He inclined his head in the barest of greetings. This time Sherlock held out his hand. “Hello, John.”
John agreed to all of Sherlock’s suggestions, not caring what he ate or drank as long as he could stare at Sherlock’s profile, watch the movements of his hands, hear the rich timbre of his voice.
-- it's as if the entire evening was expressly designed to maneuver the two of them into the most intimate of settings for a confession.
He was able to glean little about John’s background. “I’m from the West Coast. Not the sunny part,” John had said cryptically, then changed the subject, asking about Sherlock’s plans of study at Cambridge.
Sherlock glanced up suddenly, bereft at the loss of contact. He stood as well, clumsily gathering the empty bottles in one hand, mentally kicking himself for letting the moment pass.
He chastised himself for burning John's letters. He could remember each one, thrown into the fireplace or curling over the flame of a candle, blackened bits dropping into an ashtray. Their destruction had brought temporary satisfaction, but there was always a lingering question at the back of his mind, wondering what John had written.
Sherlock vanished into the dim interior and the door clanged shut. John stood there, stunned by what had just nearly happened, unable to move. He rubbed his forehead, not knowing if he should stay or go. He finally decided to return to the flat, too confused to be much use to Sherlock.
The books arrived at the villa the following summer, the package addressed to Sherlock’s parents. His mother cut open the tape on the box with a pair of sharp scissors, pulling out two hardcover books and handing one to Sherlock.
She stalked off, leaving John to drift back against the wall to watch Molly and Sherlock glide around the room. Sherlock stood out from the rest of the crowd, his steps quick and elegant, Molly looking up at him, following his lead, her face glowing.
John smooths his hands over Sherlock’s arse, his fingers trailing down the damp cleft. The touch stimulates a new desire in Sherlock, something he doesn’t voice but that John instinctively knows.
John turned back to the stove, peeked at the pasta roiling in the water, his shoulder blades briefly outlined against his white shirt as he stood on tiptoe and leaned toward the pot.
Sherlock shakes off the feeling of emptiness blooming inside his chest, then strides into the kitchen where he disposes of the tea towel deep in the bin under peels and wrappers. He puts on the kettle and is soon back in the library with his steaming mug of tea. He eases into a well-stuffed chair and Hannah, still perched on the sofa, glances up.
Sherlock had chalked up his moodiness to fatigue. John's aunt had tasked him with clearing out the attic so she could sort through the clutter, which led to a back-breaking purging of the cellar, pantry, and long-forgotten boxes in the back of wardrobes.
He scratches a word into the frost with his fingernail, tiny crystals sparkling as they fall. Sherlock gazes at his message, homesick.
Sherlock is struck by her words. She’s right. He needs to acknowledge what he’s experienced, but can’t explain. He’s very close to telling Hannah everything, that he’s seen Captain Watson seated on this very bed, but he can’t bring himself to do it.
Sherlock parked the car a short distance from the funeral home and walked around to the back door where he had dropped off Molly before. He knocked cautiously, relieved when Molly answered the door.
“Notice something?” John asked, buttering a hot roll that had just arrived on the table, expecting to hear about three affairs and one bankruptcy that Sherlock had just deduced.
“True, you’re not clever enough to hack it… Fine. We’ll split the time as you suggested, starting tomorrow.”
Sherlock opens the door, smiles at the sight of their bright faces and matching blue eyes, and is flooded with a sense of well-being. He lets Olivia, perched on her tiptoes, pull him into a hug. He catches John's soft expression looking at them both.
John didn't miss that hint, either. He smirked, not believing how quickly the situation had evolved. Encounters were often accelerated that way, never knowing what the next day might bring. Could be the biggest story of your career, or a stray bullet. It could all be over in a fiery second. Grab what pleasure you could while you were still in one piece.
Sherlock stops on the front step, picking up the scent before he even opens the door. With the keys to the flat dangling in his fingers, he sniffs once, twice, then turns to John.
Sherlock was silent for a few seconds. “Not exactly. It's complicated. But I needed to access your photos from yesterday’s demonstration.”
He poured himself a drink and sank into his chair, stretching out his legs. A lump poked at his bum and he wedged the gloves out of his pocket. He held them for a moment, admiring the high-quality leather and fine stitching. Only the best for Sherlock Holmes.
They shifted and found just enough space in the narrow bed to wrap around each other, an island of comfort in a sea of misery.
Sometimes there are moments of pure light — joyful seconds that seem to glow: Sherlock’s crooked smile, John’s infectious laugh, a lingering gaze in a midnight cab.
At that moment a sudden gust of wind rattles the windows, making them both jump. Nurse Cornish laughs nervously. “See? He’s listening.”
We caught up over tea -- my classes, Aunt Harry’s new girlfriend (who she met in a coffee shop, of all places), Dad’s writing, Sherlock’s cases and new fascination with honey bees.
The mug is moving quickly and he keeps pace into the kitchen, where the cup lands with a slosh in the sink.
"Brunette." Another spoonful of broth went into the pan. "And now, instead of a romantic dinner with Laura, I'm here on a Friday night with you."
“So Molly,” John began, changing the subject, “I saw you go by with more packages and letters this week. I think you have a sweetheart from uni that you’re writing to,” he teased.
“Oh, really? Let me read you your text,” Sherlock takes out his phone with a flourish and swipes to the message. “‘At St. Bart’s with Molly — come quickly. Your help is urgently needed.’”
About halfway back to the flat, Sherlock slowed. “I need to make a quick stop. There's someone I need to see.”
“Oh, right.” She waits while he eases into a sitting position, then hands him the cup and saucer. She settles across from him in a wingback chair, pouring her own tea. She stirs in the sugar, then taps the spoon, her gaze going to the laptop again. “What exactly does a ‘consulting detective’ do?”
“Oh.” John struggled to pull himself back into the present, disappointment filling him again, wondering if he’d just imagined the intimacy of moments ago. “You should go see if it’s there.”
John sat at a table by himself in the corner of the officer’s mess, sipping a cup of bitter tea, staring at the letter he was trying to write. He tapped his cheek with the pen, re-reading what he’d written.
Sherlock bites his lip and nods, his eyes drawn to John’s face in the glass. John’s snakes a hand around Sherlock’s waist and circles his cock. Sherlock whimpers at the touch, rutting lightly into John’s fist.
“Well, imagine that,” Mrs. Hudson remarked lightly, picking up the broken bits of china and placing them in the towel. “In all of London, you two meet again like this. It must be fate.”
John understood the urgency in his body, the request pooled his eyes, the silent question on his parted lips. He held Sherlock's gaze. “Are you sure this is what you want?” he whispered.
Sherlock smiled back, wrapping himself in their shared intimacy, the lulling murmur of the television, the scratch of his mother's pen, the dry whisper of a page turning in his father’s book.
Sherlock feels a hand around his wrist and obediently follows the tugging on his arm to the bedroom. They’re dripping wet, leaving a trail of water droplets on the floor. They stop by the side of the bed, John’s hands guiding Sherlock to a sitting position, then tipping him onto his back.
He swung onto the bicycle and pedaled, enjoying the crunch of the gravel under the wheels. He turned onto the road and pumped his legs faster, finding joy in the speed and movement, a small taste of freedom.
They both said good night to me. I climbed the stairs and returned to the still-warm bed, mystified by adults again.
He’s got to pull himself together. He can’t fuck this up. He opens the door, switches on the foyer light. “It’s just upstairs,” he announces, then mounts the steps, conscious of every creak the wood makes.
Tonight, surprisingly, he feels a twinge of loneliness. His thoughts drift back to Sherlock, wishing he was here to share a glass of wine, maybe play one of those ridiculous board games, maybe watch
That had been nearly two years ago. Now, John is enjoying a much-needed holiday in Spain. He'd started out in Barcelona for several obligatory conference days, then traveled to meet Sherlock in this not-overly-touristy town along the coast.
The discomfort gradually diminished, and Sherlock reached for John, wanting him closer. As they shifted, John slid in deeper, causing Sherlock to catch his breath.
He let out a long sigh, stretching out, thighs sinking under the surface, his head resting against the wall. He closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind, tried to let thoughts ripple by unnoticed, but the argument with John lingered, persistent, replaying in his mind.
John’s own low moan reached his ears as his pace stuttered then stopped, bursting in a hot release, his cock still trapped between Sherlock's legs. John relished the warm stickiness, sliding his cock back and forth in luxurious strokes as his climax wound down.
Sherlock suddenly pressed closer, their pelvises making sharp contact, breath quickening, mouths hungrily seeking more, hands roving, bottles clattering, shattering into the sink --
His voice was hoarse and weary, and for a moment I felt guilty for being at the center of so much grief. But then I rejected that notion. I had nothing to do with the choices that three very damaged people had made long ago. Two of them still had time to put things right.
They strolled along the pavement, making their way to a nearby pub when another storefront caught Sherlock’s eye. They stopped in front of a photography studio, an array of portraits on display in the window with the words ‘R. Smith Photography’ stenciled in gold. He paused, gnawing on an idea, then turned to John.
John's mouth quirked up at the fashionably bored greeting, surprised at the deepness of Sherlock's voice. He noticed that Sherlock hadn't bothered to remove his sunglasses. Rather a rude fellow. He switched his gaze back to Molly. “What are you up to today?”
Sherlock grinned. “You’re mad, throwing rocks at people's windows in the middle of the night.” He was dressed in striped cotton pyjama bottoms, a button-down shirt hastily thrown on, the buttons left undone, his bare feet slipped into leather loafers.
Eyes locked with Sherlock's, John bent down, extended his tongue, and licked. Sherlock inhaled sharply, and sharper again when John's mouth engulfed the head of his cock, a sensation round and silken hot.
“God, your hands are cold.” John shivers under Sherlock’s touch, the bed sheets bunched messily at their feet.
Finally, they did it! I always wanted to write ghost sex, and now I can cross that off the list with great satisfaction. In fact, there just might be more coming in the next update...
He raises his glass in a salute and we take a swallow, letting the whiskey burn a trail down our throats. We fall into silence, staring into our drinks, watching the flames dance in the amber liquid.
The Vauxhall seemed to guide itself toward John's house, Sherlock’s thoughts already turning to the sites and shops he wanted to share with John. His family visited London often, the fast pace and unending variety of the city making it feel more like a true home than Musgrave Hall.
Without questioning, Sherlock follows every cue, a pressure on his knees urging him draw his feet up to the mattress, his toes curling over the edge, knees pointing up to the ceiling.
John smoothed his hands over Sherlock's arse, slotting their hips together, cocks wantonly rubbing. Sherlock nuzzled his ear and John turned his head, his eyes randomly landing on a bottle and rag left on the table.
After an excruciating hour of waiting, they rode back to Musgrave Hall together, stashing John's bicycle out of sight. They entered through the back door into the silent kitchen, pots and pans hanging neatly from their hooks and the tile floor scrubbed clean.
He followed the course of memories to the first time they had kissed near the beehives, recalling the salty taste of Sherlock's lips and uncertainty in his eyes, to their first intimate encounters. How passionate their stolen moments together had been, how vulnerable and tender, how eager and hungry for each other, so young, so in love.
“No, not exactly.” He had that look of not wanting to delve into a complicated story. “My leg’s better now, that's all that matters.”
They had only briefly met Mrs. Holmes when John first arrived. She had greeted him in a civil but distracted way, a pencil tucked behind her ear and notebook in her hand, clearly preoccupied with something else.
Sherlock’s mouth drops open a bit in shock and he quickly seams it shut. He shifts in his chair, both uncomfortable with the conversation and oddly turned on at the thought of John wrapped in a tangle of strange men’s limbs.
I couldn't resist bragging on the playground that I knew Sherlock Holmes. I had stupidly added that I’d even been to his flat and had seen a real human skull on his fireplace mantle.
He checked the window. Snow was still coming down, the streets quiet except for a slow plow rumbling past. He should go home, give Sherlock some time alone in case he didn’t want him hanging around all day. He texted an Uber, standing up when his phone buzzed minutes later.
Sherlock receives John's mouth like a blessing, closing his eyes, cupping John's face in his palms, thanking a god he doesn't believe in for this moment.
“It’s been awhile since I’ve had you on your back,” Sherlock murmurs, grinding his pelvis suggestively against John’s.
No. John’s eyes snapped open and he rubbed his skin harshly with the bar of soap, a reprimand for imagining things he knew were impossible. God, how he sometimes wished he could lock away his desires, tamp down the crude urges of his body.
Much as he tries, he won’t remember every detail; the sheen of sweat, the salty skin, rigid bone and flexing muscle, the crashing wave and sweeping undertow of orgasm, that sound -- that sultry, deep
There were other words Sherlock could say, all futile, so he didn’t let them leave his mouth. What good would it do? They were light-years apart, following different paths. Other small things were said, attempts to dilute the ache lingering between them, ending with platitudes.
The sitting room was dim, the early morning light filtering weakly through the tall windows. I tiptoed past the couch. The pillow and blanket were still sitting there, untouched.
John threw up his hands and walked away from the fireplace. “You know, just once it'd be nice to hear something from you that wasn't an insult.”
“There's only one thing I want to unpack.” John’s hand slid suggestively to Sherlock's crotch, rubbing him through his trousers.
Sherlock allowed John to lead him to his bedroom, Mrs. Hudson following close behind with a glass of water and an an extra blanket.
Sherlock freezes, caught off guard. His cheeks flush, the truth heating his blood. John’s eyes are trained on him, his lips parted expectantly. The wine makes Sherlock’s head spin, lubricating the words that slip from his mouth. “Yes. I have.”
I think Dad missed living in the city, but he never complained about it. We inevitably ended up at Sherlock’s for a visit, and it was nice to have a place to rest our feet and have a bite to eat before heading home.
Sherlock stalled, his gaze traveling down the length of John's body. They came to rest on John's flaccid penis. It was difficult to imagine it had been inside him last night, veined and rigid.
“Um, no. I just — that’s very interesting.” He glanced at Sherlock, subconsciously stroking his beard. When he looked back at Irene, she was smiling mysteriously.
He takes a few quiet steps and peers into the kitchen, spies Sherlock at the sink, the kettle on, two mugs set out for tea. He's wearing a dark blue shirt, black trousers, and, not surprisingly, his rumpled blue dressing gown.
“Thanks.” John turned away from the desk and crossed over to a set of chairs in a quiet corner. He tore open the hefty envelope and out slid a laptop -- his laptop -- and a cheap mobile phone that looked like something a drug dealer would use. He breathed a sigh of relief, but was as mystified as ever.
John looked at him steadily, unamused. “Time and distance change people. Surely you've changed in seven years.”
John smirks in understanding. “Always the adventurer.” He kisses the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and fades away.
Sherlock loiters by the window over the kitchen sink, looking out toward the hives. Maybe he will check them, just to stretch his legs…
“Your mum is sweet,” John said mildly, wandering around the room, touching things here and there. He leaned against the desk and looked at Sherlock knowingly. “I remember that bed. We sneaked up here our last night together before I went off to training.”
Despite being surrounded by sun-soaked beauty and creative minds, Sherlock still felt very much alone. He never knew quite how to break through and engage with the larger world, never quite knew where he belonged.
My father appeared around the corner, his mouth set in a hard line, the shoulders of his jacket askew as if he’d thrown it on in a hurry.
Molly had laid out a tray of sandwiches along with a bowl of first-of-the-season strawberries and a plate of biscuits, and John passed around several bottles of beer. Sherlock realized too late that he should have brought something to share. Social niceties never were his forte.
Somewhere nearby a bird warbled and a breeze ruffled their hair, loosening the lock John had just put back into place. “I suppose I should be getting home.”
“That would be… good.” Sherlock stood watching as John deftly chopped the prosciutto on a cutting board, the knife blade glinting in the light. John's hair gleamed, too, as he moved. Sherlock liked this, watching John chop and slice and stir. He had fine hands for it. Surgical precision balanced with a creative flair.
He watched her more closely, noticing a detail he'd initially missed. He decided to wait to mention it. He opened the door and walked over to her bike. “Hop in. I’ll give you a ride home.”
Ahh, sweet summer kisses... Thanks for sticking with this, lovely readers! Your support means a lot to me.
John was looking around the room, lightly touching the spines of books, the violin case, the sheet music on the stand.
“I thought you were student of chemistry, not psychology,” John countered, taking a bite out of a strawberry.
There were weekends when Dad would text Sherlock to let him know we were in the city and he'd wait for a reply, repeatedly checking his phone. Some days no reply ever came, and I could tell it bothered him.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth crooked up slightly, and he opened the door wider. John stepped in and Sherlock closed the door behind him.
Sherlock smiled. “Now, slow down and ease… in… right… there…. Perfect.” Sherlock sighed, quite satisfied.
They finally paused to devour the spicy red curry and crisp white wine, their faces flushed, their skin warm and yielding when the touching began again. It was still so new, this permission to graze and taste lips and throats and shoulders, to unbutton and unbuckle, to slide hands in private places.
He was cautious with friendships, and utterly finished with romantic relationships. Victor had moved on, the family business taking more and more of his time and attention. The split was amicable and inevitable, but it still left a raw mark. Getting involved was a mistake, just as Mycroft had warned all those years ago. He would never again let his heart rule his head.
John tamped down the sudden surge of emotions that threatened to break through his composure. He couldn't talk about India without getting shaky, couldn't bear to hear the words
I felt like the worst person on earth. Why couldn't they have just told me the damn truth so I didn't have to spy? Deep down, though, I knew I was the one at fault.
They ordered breakfast and sipped at strong coffee, John stealing glances at Sherlock. His gaze was roving around the room, settling briefly on one table then moving to another. Sherlock tapped his fingers on his coffee cup as he contemplated.
Sherlock nodded a goodbye, remembering that he had to follow through on his story about the red ink.
“Let's just say I angered the British government. I was sent away until I earned my way back into its good graces.” Sherlock glanced up again, his expression suddenly dark. “I'm not a good man, John. I'm not selfless like you.”
In fact, he would make a warm breakfast for John. An omelet oozing with cheese, toast glistening with marmalade, coffee swirling with cream. He started cooking, whisking eggs and grating cheese, measuring out coffee, setting out butter, jam, and bread.
The sitting room was cluttered but homey, the shelves lined with an odd mix of artifacts and books. Two inviting chairs faced the fireplace, a bizarre patchwork of photos and papers covered the wall behind the sofa.
All was a haze of skin and bone, thrust and receive, bent knees and gripping hands, relentless cock and filthy moans, sweat and come. Sherlock reveled in it, arching his neck, disintegrating, John's name on his lips.
“I do like your beard,” Sherlock admitted, trailing his fingers along John’s bristly cheek, curling his other immense hand around both of their cocks, stroking them together. “Makes you look distinguished.”
John hesitated, finally pushing the folded note across the table. “I wrote down the one thing that I truly want. A very big thing.”
He looked at his parents, contemplating how they had met and courted. He knew the worn-out story about them meeting at university, his father dazzled by his mother’s brains and beauty, his mother charmed by the handsome and doting young suitor. They had married just a year later. In some ways, Sherlock envied the ease of their relationship.
Two days pass and Sherlock hears nothing from John, and doubt gnaws at his insides. No one really notices, though, he hides it so well behind his usual brusque behavior. Lestrade just thinks he's irritable, short on sleep and patience.
He can’t fathom it, finding John at last, only to lose him so quickly. He sits up in bed, his chest heavy with grief. His gaze goes to the fireplace, then to the floor, his senses so dulled that it barely registers at first — the stain on the floor is gone, the wood unblemished.
John’s trails his fingers over Sherlock’s cheek. “I’ve been roaming this house for a hundred years, feeding off regret and misery. But you gave me a second chance to make things right.” He cups Sherlock’s face, tilting it up, the fire light flickering over his features. “I want to tell you something that I should have said long ago. I love you.”
“I don't believe in it.” He studied his cards. “It's an antiquated institution doomed to fail. Plus, I despise almost everyone. And most people hate me. Hand me the rope.”
There was another long pause, the sound of laughter floating from across the hall, the notes of the piano starting up, Mycroft bowing to demands to play a Christmas carol.
John nestled his chin just behind Sherlock’s shoulder. “I want to.” He pressed his mouth against the curve of his neck. “Besides, you’re the one who took care of me when I came back.” He paused, continuing after a moment. “You gave me a place to live. A reason to live. You saved me.”
At last he exposes the scar on John’s left shoulder and he pauses, struck for a moment by an echo from the past. He gently touches the puckered skin, then sinks to the bed, pulling John after him. He places his lips over the scar, grateful that the injury didn’t steal John away from him this time.
Hannah sits down next to him, her hands in her lap. “I never really believed in ghosts. But now...” she turns up her palms, he shoulders hunched. “I don’t think what’s happening is a prankster. Or even exactly human.”
“The other night…” Sherlock started, then trailed off, working up the courage to say more. “I wanted to.”
John’s fingers trembled and he let his bike drop into the grass, swiftly closing the space between them, grasping Sherlock's head in his hands, catching his mouth in a hard, searing kiss.
Sherlock took a tentative sip and made a small face of displeasure. John glanced at him, noticing he had changed into a different suit, this one dark blue with a light blue shirt underneath, no tie. He never wore ties. He just had to show off that long neck, didn’t he?
He doesn’t know how to process these secret desires, apart from sometimes waking up with a raging boner that he swiftly dispatches with a fistful of fantasies about pale skin, stormy blue eyes, long fingers, and perfect lips wrapped around his —
They quickly picked up John's bicycle outside of Molly's house and loaded it in the back seat, then drove toward the lake, falling into silence again.
“So, what were the highlights of the past year?” John asks while brushing his teeth, glancing at Sherlock in the bathroom mirror. It’s almost midnight on New Year’s Eve and they’re getting ready for bed, already yawning before the clock strikes 12.
rhythm of palm and foreskin and dangling balls. Sherlock’s hands returned to the irresistible curves of John’s arse, caressing and massaging.
Sherlock wavered, then accepted the offer, glad for the distraction. They watched the sunset, nursing their drinks, talking about books and Cambridge and maybe taking the boat out on the weekend. He soon felt much calmer, and realized he missed spending time with his father.
Sherlock looked up at the sound, but John ignored him, pouring out a glass for himself. So. He would make the risotto now. With lemon. And sodding peas.
“A bullet nearly nicked your heart.” Mycroft’s voice is almost gentle. “Good thing they run small in our family.”
Tonight, Sherlock would welcome a deep rest. He tipped a few drops of oil into the bath, then twisted the taps shut, slow drips from the lip of the faucet punctuating the sudden silence.
Sherlock stands on the landing at the top of the stairs and watches them disappear under the arched doorway leading to the front door.
Sherlock's hands curve behind John's back, pulling him up and into the kiss, John now on his tiptoes. Sherlock lets out a soft moan when John sinks his fingers into the dark curls just above his nape.
They made love, Sherlock holding John's hips, entering him from behind, another in their many amorous variations. He caressed John's arse, so round and pale, a peach, and stroked his back. Sherlock loved the tightness around his cock, loved the soft huffing sounds they made as he thrusted, John's head dipping in abandon, his nape exposed.
They wend their way to Baker Street, stumble-grope up the stairs, shedding layers, nuzzling cold skin, falling into bed for more winter games.
Sherlock bristled, but Mycroft pressed on. “He's leaving for the army. You’ll likely never see him again after this summer.”
John threw off the bed sheet and sat up, agitated. There was no way he could sleep. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, scraping his hands through his hair in frustration. He gazed at the open  window, an idea seeping into his mind. It was close to midnight, the house silent. If he were to quietly sneak out, no one would know…
“I’ll take your coat.” Sherlock held out his hand, and John shrugged off his jacket. As Sherlock hung his things up in the closet, John looked around, amazed at the overstuffed furniture, art nouveau-inspired wallpaper, overflowing bookshelves, and crackling fireplace. It was charmingly cozy.
Sherlock avoided John for several days, and it was only when John came to the beach for an afternoon swim that they were forced to talk again. The cove was empty, everyone one else resting in their bedrooms.
When his life was upended and the darkness in him grew, his service revolver a constant tempting offer of escape, he finally stopped the one-sided correspondence, instead writing down desperate ramblings in a private journal.
“In fact, I moved in with him the same day, hardly knowing a thing about him. Just some mad scientist who likes to play the violin.” John holds his breath, wondering if he’d just given away too much.
Mycroft folds the paper, rises, smooths his jacket, and indicates that Sherlock should follow him to a private room where they can speak.
He dropped her off and helped unload her belongings, managing to avoid having to chat with her father or mother. He wasn't ready to return home yet, so he drove aimlessly, not really thinking about where he was going until he recognized the house where John was staying. He slowed, catching sight of John dismounting from his bicycle near the garage.
“Shit,” he muttered, growing more desperate as each second passed. That computer was his livelihood. His photo archives, editing software, his connection to his clients, everything. “Shit, shit, shit!”
“Agreed.” She stands up, her footing a little unsteady, causing a floorboard to squeak as she catches her balance. “I think I need to finish that glass of wine. Calm my nerves. Care to join me?”
He would apologize, it was the only solution. He'd explain that he'd had a lapse in judgement, he'd been swept away by nostalgia, and made a mistake that would not happen again.
They share another small smile, then Sherlock leads the way down the stairs. He waits on the pavement as John pulls the heavy door shut by the brass knocker.
“Oh yes, the rumors. Nearly forgot about that. I’ll have the Yard release a statement announcing your resurrection. Speaking of the dead, any more ghost problems?”
So far, things had gone reasonably well, Sherlock thought as he walked briskly to the house. John and his father had been equally pleasant, chatting easily about cars and the army and the best ratio of nutrients for rose bushes.
John sees Sherlock’s quick inhale, his ribs and muscles visible. Several beats go by, quivering with tension, uncertainty, a mixed desire for something more.
They talked for a few more minutes until Molly's mother beckoned to her from across the room. Molly rolled her eyes. “I better go see what she needs. We should all have a drink at the pub before you go back to the city.”
When his fingers brushed across the book with the red cloth cover, his gut tightened. He lifted the book out gingerly, as if it were a bomb that might detonate with the slightest movement. He held it, his mouth drawn down, his fingertips finding the gap in the pages where the photographs from his summer with John were wedged.
They fall silent, knowing their time is limited. John finally pushes himself up, lifting a corner of the covers. “You must be cold.”
Sherlock stared at the ceiling, losing himself in the patterns of crazed paint that would eventually crack and peel if nothing was done to patch it up. Perhaps he should apologize.
John pressed his leg against Sherlock’s, his hand sliding over the top of his knee. “Then I know what I want to have.”
“Well,” John replied, checking his pulse, “you certainly are now. And no wonder, with the hours you've been keeping.”
There was soup, something gingery and refreshing. John filled Sherlock in about the weeks following the failed coup attempt, the government-imposed curfew, the uneasy calm that lay over the capital.
And if he was honest with himself, he hadn’t been quite ready, either. He had only been with one man that way, someone who was much more experienced and had shown him the ropes, so to speak. He had worried that things wouldn’t go as well with Sherlock, that what should be sensual and pleasurable might end up awkward and unsuccessful.
His eyes are helplessly drawn to John’s face, smiling and handsome and relaxed, beard sprinkled with grey, head tilted, Rosie tugging on his hand. “Please?” John mouths to Sherlock, tipping his head toward Rosie.
“Burning the candle at both ends,” Mrs. Hudson added over her shoulder. “Always dashing in and out, never sleeping.”
Sherlock can hear the shuffle of papers before Mycroft continues. “His unit then accompanied General Maude’s offensive on Baghdad, which fell to the British in March 1917. His unit was eventually reassigned to support the Sinai and Palestine Campaign… He was wounded on September 23, 1918, at the Battle of Megiddo. He was shipped home.” The rasp of papers can be heard again. “He died December 3rd, 1918, at his family’s estate.”
Their eyes locked across the table, faces glowing, endorphins simmering from the spicy heat and alcohol. The music that had been playing low in the background now became audible. Something old school again, strings building, Etta James soulfully belting out the lyrics.
“They’re mysterious, silently appearing from the shadows, a billowy black cloak draped around their shoulders. Some stories say they can turn into bats and fly.”
Once safely outside, John turned to Sherlock, pushing him playfully on the shoulder. “What was that in there? You never told me you were an actor.”
John senses when Sherlock’s legs begin to tire. He moves his hands higher to Sherlock’s back, bends upward, and flips Sherlock over in one swift move. John gathers him in his arms, finds his mouth, lavishing him with passionate kisses. He slips his cock back into the hot sheath of Sherlock’s body, Sherlock’s legs wrapping around his back.
A wave of warmth lapped over Sherlock’s body as he recalled the details of their night together. He laid on his side, processing the fact that he had allowed himself to become so intimate with John, marveling again at how far his carefully constructed defenses had crumbled away over the summer.
Dad had gone into the city in the morning -- or was it yesterday? -- to run a few errands. I hadn’t really listened, my face in my pillow.
I had a few friends at school, and sometimes I’d go over to someone’s house to play or for a sleepover, but I was by and large a loner. I didn’t really mind being alone, which seemed hard for people to understand.
Undeterred, he continues up the steps. Hannah scurries after him, whimpering in between curse words.
They finally pull apart, Sherlock’s bottom lip captured between John's teeth, released. They breathe shallowly, foreheads touching.
He listened to the clock ticking on the bedside table, reality intruding on his train of thought. It wasn’t as simple as he made it sound, any of it. It was unwise, potentially dangerous, and he knew it. Sherlock knew it. But he didn't know if he could stop himself.
John kept his eyes lowered. “My mom understands. She gets it. My dad… he thought it was a waste of time. Funny, coming from a man who screwed up everything he touched. Failed businesses, failed marriage…”
He’s wearing a deep navy blue suit and crisp white shirt that has a subtle pinstripe running through it. His hair gleams in the lamplight, his fingers dance elegantly as he adjusts his cuffs. I swallow, stunned again by the sharpness of his cheekbones, the curve of his lips, the lithesome power of his trim body. I want to tell him that he looks beautiful. I ache to let him know how I feel, that I want him with my heart and body and soul.
“John -- last night was --” he stumbled, regained his footing, “It was special… I make it a rule not to get involved, but I want to see you again.”
Sherlock stares at the ceiling, his hands loosely clasped in his lap, the shakiness much less obvious. John wonders what Sherlock is thinking, how he feels being groomed like this.
“You didn’t have your phones, I guess.” Molly flips the light switch a few times, jogging the bulb back to full power. “There they are,” she smiles upon seeing the skeletons, then attempts a joke. “I bet you were worried that you’d end up like these two, stuck in here forever.”
“Yes, I did. It's like Christmas to him. I thought he'd pee his pants with excitement,” she said dryly, her thumbs busy on the keyboard.
He heard the deep sigh of exhaustion, felt the exhalation tickle his ear. He struggled to say something, to turn and wake for this long awaited moment.
It didn’t mean anything, John told himself sternly, just enjoy it. It's just two friends getting a massage. Sherlock never follows convention, and he probably didn’t even realize how romantic this might appear, so just shut up and relax.
“Eager, aren’t you?” John teases gently, pushing in just a bit deeper. He stops, pulls back, and starts again, slow, shallow thrusts, drinking in Sherlock’s face, how he’s biting his lower lip, sloe-eyed.
In the weeks since that evening on the steps, they’ve graduated from aching kisses in the hallway to snogging on the sofa, rough groping, a hurried handjob. Time, there's never enough time. John slips away to Baker Street when he can -- after work, before a shift, once after the guest lecture at Bart's -- for 30 minutes, an hour, and then he has to go.
He could easily make himself come, but he wants John to climax first, wants to feel the pulse of John’s orgasm inside of him. He clenches John’s cock, words spilling out of his mouth in a filthy, velvety rumble.
Sherlock grasped at John's shoulders, dizzy at the thought. But he had an additional wish, a vivid desire recently discovered. “There's something I'd like to try…”
The train finally came to a stop and the jostling began, everyone eager to be on their way. They emerged onto the platform, pausing for a moment to get their bearings.
“I don’t know anything about that. Useless.” After a moment, curiosity gets the better of him. “Who’s Orion?”
As John's mouth moved to the tender skin under his jaw, Sherlock closed his eyes, desperately recalibrating to accommodate the last few unexpected seconds. He had fantasized about such a moment, always chastising himself for a fool. But now it was happening, John's touch and kiss were real; John wasn't leaving, he wouldn't be alone.
“Who taught you how to do all of this?” Sherlock asked as his father carefully replaced the cover on the last hive.
Once the fire is going, Sherlock stands up and brushes off his knees. “Sit down, John. I’ll have a drink, too. The basement can wait.”
He regarded me for a long moment. “Can't smoke in here. Outside.” He motioned for me to follow him to the kitchen. He slid the window up to reveal a rickety looking metal fire escape. He stepped through the opening with practiced ease and the aid of long limbs. My exit was far less graceful.
John leaned casually against the door, his hair damp, the top buttons of his shirt undone. Recently out of the shower, Sherlock surmised, the fresh scent of soap contrasting with the haze of beekeeping smoke that clung to his own hair and clothes.
The room was warm, the faint sound of traffic floated through the window, a clock tolled the half hour, but they were unaware of time, touching and coaxing, stoking up an increasingly intense desire.
John watched, mesmerized as Sherlock’s luscious mouth and pink tongue resumed their explorations of his cock. His fingers bunched into the canvas as he fought to control his response, but it was a losing battle. Sherlock was a natural at this, agile fingers and velvety mouth finding all the sensitive spots at the right pace.
The second morning, John crept from the room, his body a bit sore from all their exertions. He returned not long after with two tall cups of coffee and warm bagels.
He could hear his parents chatting animatedly on the phone with John, apologizing for calling so early, offering their congratulations, inquiring about his job, inviting him to visit, wishing him well before handing the phone to Sherlock. His father beckoned him over.
The walk back to the hotel after the carriage ride had been quiet, a lit fuse of desire smoldering between them. It took every ounce of self-discipline to stand primly in the lobby, hands folded neatly in front of them as they waited for the lift.
“Thank you,” John replies, clearly moved by Sherlock's gesture. He quickly checks for messages, and finding none, sets the phone carefully on the bedside table. He pulls Sherlock back down to the bed, the white sheet drifting unevenly around them.
“Please. Take me.” The words were strange, old-fashioned, but it was what he felt, the need to be consumed, overwhelmed,
“Really? I thought it might look a tad familiar.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth lifted in a slight smile.
“Walk more. And your grubby little network of informants will just have to accept a lower rate as well. In short, brother dear, adjust your standard of living.”
He knew exactly who had it. He smiled to himself, thinking how incorrigible Sherlock was. He held the phone to his ear one moment more, not wanting to end the call, but knowing precious seconds were ticking by. He said his name one last time. “Sherlock… I’ll see you in New York.”
“For making edits. My mother is writing a book on advanced mathematics, and I'm assisting her this summer.”
“We’d leave first thing Monday, returning Saturday. I imagine Mother’s booked the hotel where my family always stays. It's in a good location.”
John nodded stiffly. They made their way back down the stairs to another door that Mrs. Hudson opened. She entered first, flicking on a lamp in the gathering dusk. John looked around as Mrs. Hudson plumped a pillow and straightened a curtain, then fussed with a little statue of a dog on a bookshelf.
John nodded, not listening. Part of him wanted to chase after Sherlock, but another part felt crushed, unable to move. He stayed slumped in the booth, nursing another beer, dejected. Maybe he’d misread everything and scared Sherlock off. Maybe he just wasn’t interested. Maybe he’d just fucked it up.
“I’m sure the hospital administrators would be thrilled to know that food and alcohol are being served in the morgue.”
When he consulted his watch again, it was time to head back to the hotel to change for dinner. A small knot of nervousness formed in his belly as he began to walk. He tried to ignore it, not quite sure what was bothering him.
Relief flickered across Sherlock's face. “Thank you.” He paused. “I suppose I owe you a favor in return.”
With a final adjustment of his cuffs, he strode to the door and opened it with a flourish, unable to tamp down the urge to preen a little.
Sherlock finally unearthed a pack of cigarettes in the back of a drawer. He held them in his hand as if debating.
John slid his hands up Sherlock's chest. Him, it was him, flesh and blood and bone, willingly here, offering the intimacy of breath and lips and body, accepting John's touch.
I briefly wonder if I’m responsible for his subdued mood, if he saw my silent confession in the mirror and finds it repulsive or pathetic. I turn away and stare out my own window, my stomach twisting.
“Oh, they're lively as ever, if a bit slower. Father still keeps his bees and Mother publishes the occasional article on mathematics.”
“Your father has dreamt up an idea for a proper path into the rose garden. There's a load of flagstones arriving Thursday afternoon that’ll need moving. If you and your friend could help, that'd be lovely. Help save your old dad’s back.”
He stands up, flexes his back, and starts to clean up. It would be nice, he thinks, to go back to the flat and have a bath, stretch out on the sofa, maybe watch some telly. John will have that old movie on, the black and white one, and will have opened that bottle of wine by now.
They fell silent, Sherlock trying to picture his life in five years. He'd be 25, maybe finished with a graduate degree in chemistry. But then what? Where would he live? What would he do for a living? Where would John be? He closed his eyes, not wanting to think about it.
John obliged, both hands cupping Sherlock’s face, infusing the kiss with every hope and fear and yearning he’d had during the last two months. He could feel Sherlock’s response, his fingers clutching into his shoulders, the little shudder when John pulled away to gaze at him again.
Sherlock moved even closer. The heat from the fire licked at the back of John's legs, the crackling flames roaring in his ears. He was burning up, engulfed by Sherlock's gaze.
The dedication -- it’s beautiful, Sherlock finally said. It’s for you, for our summer. I’ll never forget it. Neither will I.
Oh, Sherlock’s mouth felt so good, his long fingers splayed against his back, the skin of his neck fragrant. This impossible moment was happening, their lips roaming, tasting, the phone number printed on John’s hand completely forgotten.
After waking fully, he returned to the bike he had left leaning against the side of the garage. Bending down, he rolled up the cuff of his right trouser leg to prevent it from getting caught in the chain. He then rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt and pulled a pair of dark sunglasses from his pocket.
Sherlock noticed Mycroft's eyes traveling along the wall above the sofa that was covered with maps, notes, clippings, and photographs for a different case he was working on.
Sherlock held his gaze. “I won't either.” He looked down, his emotions churning, tearing at the wall he was struggling to keep in place. “John, I--” he took a breath --
“There's a full kitchen, and the bath is just down the hallway, along with the other bedroom,” she explained.
Sherlock stood gazing out the kitchen window with a tea cup in his hand, a dressing gown tossed over his rumpled clothes from the night before.
A small oil lamp burned by his elbow, the electricity out once again. A moth flitted around the lamp’s glass cover, throwing shadows onto the blank paper.
“You’re lucky to have grown up with this,” John said. “This place, the sea, the history. Your family.”
He finally climbed onto the table, the masseuse draping a sheet over his hips and starting on his shoulders. “You're very tense,” she observed, her thumbs sinking into his muscles.
Sherlock turned to find Molly at his elbow, the tiny crystal beads on her dusky rose dress catching the light.
He swam on, losing track of time, finally tiring himself. He stopped, clinging to the edge of the pool, catching his breath, enjoying how heavy his arms and legs felt.
He misjudged it. He chides himself for thinking John might relax here, that they might have time to talk. Alone, they might finally --
Sherlock twisted to the left, pouring strong coffee into his mug, his hair enticingly rumpled from a late night of analyzing crime scene photos. He turned to look accusingly at John over his shoulder. “Why are you staring?”
John found himself smiling back, unable to resist the mirth in Sherlock's eyes. Disbelief, amazement, and relief collided in his chest, swirled up his throat, and escaped in a ragged laugh.
The words were like a spell, granting John release. He pitched forward with an incoherent grunt, a copious strand of come striping hot across Sherlock’s chest, another slashing across his neck. John coaxed out the last creamy spasms over Sherlock’s open mouth, semen pearling his lower lip, dribbling down his chin.
“Well,” Hannah says. “I hope that’s a good sign.” She glances over at Sherlock. “Do we tell Dimmock about this?”
John held his gaze, his face turning serious. “That summer means more to me than you could possibly know.”
“Are you sure? British, tall, dark hair, quite good looking?” John winced after saying the last part out loud.
Dessert (creme brûlée with fresh raspberries), and they had moved on to parents, siblings, broad strokes of their childhoods. By the last spoonful, they were full -- stuffed with an excellent meal, fine wine, and new details.
They discuss several theories, including the possibility that Dimmock and Nurse Cornish are involved, but Mycroft assures Sherlock that all the staff have met strict security clearances.
And his own reaction to this house, to this ghost story -- he wasn't as immune to it as he thought he was, long-buried memories stirring again.
Although he hides it well, John is nervous, his stomach doing little flips again, his nerves alight but for very different reasons than earlier this evening. Any thought of ghosts has faded, his mind occupied entirely by the flesh and blood man standing before him. And such a beautiful creature he is, pale skin, blue eyes, hard chest, hands that could kill, lips that hint of numerous pleasures.
Sherlock nodded, circling to the other side of the room to pull back the curtains and look down at the street through the window.
Such a strange appendage, exposed and vulnerable, crude and efficient, ridiculous and practical, sometimes inconveniently obvious, capable of giving and receiving so much pleasure...
They finally disentangled themselves from the frames, letting the bikes drop to the ground. Sherlock lowered himself to the soft grass, drawing John down by the wrist to lay next to him. They stared up at the evening sky through the tree branches, hidden by a knee-high wall of gently rustling grass.
John lifted his eyes, his wounded pride fighting with his desire to tell Sherlock everything. He couldn't answer.
“He’d be crazy if he didn’t.” John can’t stop his mouth, his words breathless. “You’re amazing. Brilliant. Gorgeous. My God, he’d be lucky to have you.” He clamps his hand over his mouth, squeezing his eyes shut, kicking himself. Subtle, really subtle, Watson. Rambling like a drunk idiot.
John smiled, weighing his options, deciding on the latter course. The ember glowed brighter as he jauntily descended the stairs and entered the kitchen to put on the kettle. He pulled out two mugs and the tea tin, sugar and spoons.
“Thank you, Thomas. That will be all.” Mrs. Holmes dismissed the gardener, who had carried the other end of the trunk up from the car. He touched his cap and left the room.
John smiled smugly to himself, knowing he had just found another advantage. Could be interesting, this little kink. “Alright, they stay on. But now it's your turn. Strip.”
John grins, running his palm over the muscles of Sherlock's back, down to grasp one firm buttock. “No complaints.” His hand roams, his voice suggestive. “I recommend some bed rest for that knee. How about I examine you tomorrow… Maybe initiate some physical therapy?”
Dimmock gazed at the smooth wood of the boomerang he held in his hands, looking positively delighted at the thought of cracking his first big case as an officer. “I hope to be Detective Inspector someday,” Dimmock admitted. “This will be my start.”
Sherlock couldn’t stop the laugh that rose up from his chest. “It sounded quite natural,” he teased.
“I thought it best to leave all of us out of it,” Sherlock added. “It'd be a bit difficult to explain why we were at the funeral home examining the body.”
“I was hoping… ” John pauses again. “I dunno, it’s Christmas Eve, and I was hoping we might do something.”
Sherlock rode off, stopping first at the tobacco shop, then unable to resist a quick look at the bookstore. He thumbed through a number of titles -- Joyce’s
She was smart, funny, attractive… If he was wise, he'd focus on her for the summer, woo her, see how far he could get.
They had left their coats and overnight bags at the foot of the staircase when they first arrived. A Sig Sauer is safely tucked between John's socks and shirts.
Sherlock's mother was in fine form, telling a story Sherlock had heard dozens of times before but that was new and entertaining to their guests.
Sherlock gnawed at his thumbnail, staring at the blank piece of paper that lay in front of him on the kitchen table. It shouldn’t be so difficult. Tiny children did this all the time. Let’s make lists, John had suggested, of what we each want for Christmas.
The man was paying for a drink, a gin and tonic maybe, long fingers peeling off a few bills that he left on the bar. He dropped a well-worn backpack onto the stool next to him and remained standing as he sipped the drink. He probably had just climbed out of a Land Rover after a long and dusty ride and needed a stretch.
John pinched him on the bum. “You're so modest.” He retrieved his trousers and pulled them on, slipping his shirt and shoes on next. He tramped off toward the boathouse while Sherlock got partially dressed, then gathered their remaining garments.
John smooths Sherlock’s hair. “You have a long life ahead. You need to go live it. My life is done. Resolved.”
John knows he'd love to find something, any shred of evidence that would dismiss the supernatural. John still isn't sure what to make of all that's happened, but at least the room is cozy and feels safe.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth crooked up. He shrugged off his suit jacket and flung it over the chair in his bedroom. When he walked back into the kitchen, there was already a steaming bowl of curry and rice and a cold bottle of beer waiting at his usual place at the table.
John breaks the impasse first, reaching up to cup his hand behind Sherlock’s head, pulling him closer, placing a soft kiss against his lips. A million sensations flood Sherlock’s system, overriding his brain. John’s mouth is warm, vibrant, the kiss stealing the breath from his lungs. He inhales shallowly, trembling a little. This is the moment he’s been living for, a second chance with John — this John who is gruff and flirtatious, complex and damaged and very much alive, his heart beating fiercely under his ribs.
He slipped off the gold ring, holding it in his palm for a few moments, saying a final goodbye to a part of his life that had ended in India. He pulled open the desk drawer and found a box that held an old watch. He placed the ring in the box, then slid the drawer closed again.
Sherlock hesitated, then jogged a few steps, catching John by the shoulder. “Let me give you a ride.”
Sherlock remained motionless. “Thank you,” he replied cautiously, always unsure when she offered compliments.
He crawled into bed to read the letter, his eyes widening at John's intimate confessions, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. The smile wavered as he finished, his head listing against the wall, the letter falling into his lap. Every fiber of his body ached for John.
They cycled through their turns, Miss Smith lightening their moods with her steady chatter and compliments. “Lovely,” she said, finishing Sherlock’s set. “Now, let’s have you stay seated and your friend come stand by the side of the chair.” She ducked behind the camera to check the framing.
It starts out slow, a series of soft kisses, half-lowered lashes, hands slowly roaming from back to neck, shoulder to jaw.
Sherlock smirks and passes John a second string of lights. As he stretches his arm upward, he can’t help but notice that John’s crotch is now at eye level. John’s jeans snug tight as he reaches up to secure the lights, the denim outlining an impressive bulge. Sherlock tries not to look, but he can’t shift his gaze, his mind fixating on the words
He noticed my gaze and ran a finger over the mark. “Your father said so himself.” He looked uncharacteristically guilty.
“Then you’re going to use the map in that amazing head of yours to take us back to the hotel, where I'm going to draw a cool bath, undress you, and join you for a long, lathery soak. I’ll dry you off with those sinfully soft towels, lay you out on that big white bed… and we’ll just see what happens, shall we?”
I hope you enjoyed this summer escape. Go read CMBYN if you haven’t already, and support the film! I can’t wait to see it in January.
“Oh… this… “ she said modestly, plucking at her dress. “I mean, thank you. Did you bring cake? I didn't think you'd come.”
The autumn rain pattered against the window as Sherlock scowled at Mycroft, displeased, his fingers tapping against the arm of the leather chair. Mycroft sat calmly across from him, his hands folded in his lap.
John turned, surprised by how stunning she looked in a pale green dress, her eyes rimmed with kohl and her mouth painted a poppy red. “You look lovely,” he said admiringly.
Sherlock placed the handset back into the cradle, replaying their conversation, wondering what had changed John’s mind. He wove back to his room, exhausted, wanting to sleep until the weekend, missing the weight of John in bed beside him.
They talked more about Sherlock’s upcoming apprenticeship at a museum in Rome and his hopes for securing a permanent position there once he finished his doctoral degree. They then switched to John’s latest project and the buzz surrounding his name for a major literary prize. They ordered another round.
He stepped back into the hallway, checking for Sherlock. Not finding him, John wandered back toward the lobby, passing a juice bar along the way. He glanced in, seeing a smattering of couples and singles at the tables, a woman fussing over a tiny dog in her lap, a tallish bloke in dark jeans and cream-colored jumper standing at the bar.
Satisfied with the knot, he smoothed the black silk tie and inspected his suit: midnight blue wool trousers topped by a deep navy velvet jacket with satin silk shawl lapels, a silk-covered single button fastening, and jetted pockets with silk trim. Beneath that was a matching velvet double-breasted waistcoat with lapels. His favorite details were the waistcoat’s eight silk-covered buttons set in double columns. A tonal navy shirt and patent leather shoes completed the look.
“Good night, Liv. Sorry for spoiling your evening,” he said, pulling the covers up over my shoulder.
He settles into bed, trying to find a comfortable position. The pain is bad tonight, worse than it has been in several days, so he finally gives in and takes a mild painkiller with just enough codeine to take the edge off.
I woke up early, needing to pee. I laid in bed, listening carefully to see if anyone else was up yet.
Two plates littered with crumbs of chocolate cake are set haphazardly on the side table next to John’s chair. A fire is burning low in the grate and Sherlock has opened the evening’s second bottle of wine, now almost gone. Both he and John are a bit drunk, in stocking feet, sunk into their chairs pulled close to the fire, knees poking out at odd angles.
“Isn’t it funny,” Sherlock said softly, reaching across the table to take John’s hand into his own, “that we asked for the same thing?”
blood, he continues to muse, the t-shirt still folded in his hands, what kind of injury would cause that much blood loss? Stomach wound? Chest wound?
“Yes, but it's excellent for crime.” Sherlock put a hand on the door when he heard Molly's voice pipe up.
“It was just a joke.” Sherlock laughs nervously, taking several slow steps backwards, bartering for time. He leaves large footprints in the freshly fallen snow that blankets the small park. It’s midnight, the city sleeping, their confrontation witnessed only by a stray cat.
He stretched and rubbed sleep from his eyes, lured into wakefulness by the smell of coffee. He glanced out the window, delighted by the sight of fat snowflakes drifting down from the sky. He was about to get up when Sherlock came into the bedroom holding two steaming mugs of coffee, a blue dressing gown tied carelessly around his waist.
“Don't forget your shoulder.” Sherlock's voice was muffled, his face lowered through the padded opening of the massage table.
Mycroft smirks. “The doctors say you’re recovering well. Everything went very smoothly. You’re very lucky.”
John shook his head to clear it, not wanting to dwell on those thoughts. He was here, in the same room as Sherlock, so close he could touch him if he took a few steps forward. After years of thinking about him, wondering where he was, what he was doing, who he was with, they were together. He wanted to say something, to reach out and break this awkward silence. He cleared his throat. “It's good to see you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock watches John disappear down the hall, his gait slightly uneven. This had been a foolish idea, Sherlock thinks. As foolish as the feelings he's been harboring for John.
Memories of last night’s dream shimmer over him — the hand on his thigh, the sound of his name, the sense of intimacy, the longing and desire…
John's expression is only mildly puzzled; he's used to cryptic comments from Sherlock, but knows they usually have some deeper meaning. He strokes a hand down the shirt front once more. “I'll be leaving in a bit. Want to come along?”
John faltered, wilting under Sherlock's scrutiny. He pushed on. “I apologize if I offended you. I was caught up in old memories, thinking about how it used to be... and… I may have crossed a line...”
Sherlock was aware of censors and the general lack of privacy in the army. Any hint of scandal discovered in a letter could end John's career. “I understand.”
John's stomach does a little flip of dread. He doesn't want to do it. “Actually, I am feeling a bit peaky. Maybe I'll just… sit down.” He turns and walks back down the hallway to the staircase, wanting nothing more than a strong drink in his hand. He had seen several liquor bottles in the library earlier.
He slowly peels off his coat and gloves, then unwinds his scarf. I loiter by my chair, feeling foolish in my stocking feet, waiting for a chance to duck away.
“So you don't…” John stumbled, apparently not quite done with the subject, “you never see a girl you like… and maybe buy her a drink, take her out?”
I followed him, sulking, to a small room off the hallway where I’d seen them together earlier. I flopped down on the bed and laid there, ignoring him when he came back with my overnight bag. He gave me a long look as I dug out my headphones and turned up my music. Eventually, he just went away.
He tried to tune out the rapid-fire clacking of the keyboard as Sherlock typed, making him aware of his own slow hunt-and-peck style. Dammit, did Sherlock have to do everything better?
Sherlock climbed out of the car, took off his sunglasses, and anchored them just above the top button of his waistcoat. Molly skirted around him, chattering about the picnic she had planned and rummaging for a blanket in the back seat as John sauntered over to them.
Sherlock was beginning to understand John, seeing what others didn’t see. He wondered if John could see through him the same way. If John looked at him closely, he would find someone equally restless and unsettled, uncertain about so many things. But instead of charm, he covered his doubts with brusqueness.
John closed his eyes, his lips meeting Sherlock's as softly as possible, a butterfly on a petal. He felt Sherlock inhale sharply and he shifted back slightly, allowing Sherlock to break away. But he stayed.
John slowly released each button one by one, pausing each time to bestow a blessing of his mouth on the newly bared skin between the open plackets of his shirt. Sherlock squirmed with pleasure, his nerves singing with exquisite sensitivity under John's breath and lips.
Maybe John is sleeping, or working a late shift. Maybe John is ignoring him, wishing that evening had never happened.
Dad nodded. “Lestrade sent up two more cold cases after the holidays. Couldn’t have thought of a better present, really.”
He turned and walked away, already thinking about a stop at the butcher shop, when the door swung open. He stepped aside and nodded briefly at the familiar face. It was Mike Stamford, one of the physicians who allowed him access to the hospital lab. They were on friendly terms, though not precisely friends. “Mike,” he acknowledged.
“Anyway,” she deliberately changes the subject, looking around the room. “Creepy old house, isn’t it? The bloke who drove me up here told me it’s haunted.”
He dressed quickly, not wanting to risk the awkwardness of seeing Sherlock naked again. He headed straight to the bar, ordering a whiskey and tall glass of water. He found a table in the corner, where he drank the water quickly and nursed the drink slowly, running a hand distractedly through his damp hair.
Sherlock doesn’t want him to leave, but doesn’t know how to postpone his departure. “I’ll walk you out.”
The room is still dim and it takes a moment to see the object stashed in the alcove. Sherlock reaches down and draws out a slim book bound in leather. He carefully opens the front cover and is astonished to see handwriting filling the pages.
Sherlock wished he knew what John was thinking. He wasn't able to interpret the mix of emotions flickering across John's face, but it made him feel uneasy -- did John want to stay longer or leave as quickly as possible?
The sounds Sherlock makes are guttural, needy, overwhelmed by the soft pad of John’s tongue, the firmness of his lips, the sheen of saliva and precome under John’s pumping hand. He grips the sheets, a lucious tension building, a wave gathering force, about to spill over
He studies the photo of Captain Watson again, imagining him growing up in this house, standing in this very room, reading, playing cards with his family, laughing, vibrantly alive, then coming back home a wounded man, his life ebbing away on the floor upstairs.
John spun around, adrenaline spiking through his body, prepared to fight. Sherlock stood in the doorway, his long coat making a dramatic silhouette.
They draped the netting over their hats to cover their faces and pulled on long cowhide gloves. Mr. Holmes closed the lid and handed the smoker to Sherlock as they approached the first hive.
This was happening, John thought hazily, it was real, Sherlock’s missing watch just an excuse to get them alone in private. He sighed, suddenly regretting that they’d wasted so much time apart. If only he’d recognized all the signs earlier…
I sprawled out in an armchair and studied him. His hair had gone almost completely silver, his face was more lined, but he was still ingrained with the military discipline to jog several times a week and do push-ups every morning. His right knee hurt sometimes, and he'd massage it after a run, muttering how aging was a cruel bastard.
Sherlock hunched over his plate, absently pushing around bits of egg with his fork. He wasn't hungry, still preoccupied with the afternoon among the hives. The lingering kiss had unfolded several days ago, and he not yet come to a decision about John. Temptation and prudence were tangling inside of him, a clash of want and caution. It was exhausting.
Dimmock’s face reddens. “These old houses, they sometimes have passages leading outside from the cellar. I’ll check it out.”
“I know I’ve made mistakes,” he went on, pacing again. “I haven’t been the best father. But I tried to give you stability, a good home.”
The voice is a tendril of a whisper, causing Sherlock to glance quickly behind him. Nobody is there. His heart races. Almost no one knows his given first name — William — and no one ever uses it. And yet he just heard it. He waits, unsure, tense. Nothing more happens.
I quickly glance out the window, checking for the cab I’d called earlier. It hasn’t arrived yet, but I notice fat snowflakes drifting down from the grey sky. I watch the snow fall for a few moments, wishing we could just stay at home, start a fire, maybe watch an old movie.
Sherlock approached a driver who was wearing a black top hat, negotiated for a minute, and returned to John. “We're all set. In you go.”
John tries not to grin, then grows more serious. He grips Sherlock's hip, gives it a little shake. “Be more careful, will you?” he says earnestly, his eyes searching Sherlock's.
Sherlock straightened his shoulders defensively. Was everyone going to be dropping innuendos all evening? “You're the one who suggested that I should get a flatmate.”
“Er, yes. Breakfast.” Sherlock stared at the sleep-flushed skin of John’s neck and chest, collarbones framed enticingly by the sheet. He managed to set the plate and mug on the table, pushing them towards John.
“We’ve neither confirmed nor denied anything. Only a handful of people know the truth, including our parents, of course. Your attempted assassin might get restless, not knowing if they succeeded. They’re apt to make a blunder. That type always craves attention. So,” Mycroft sits up straighter, smoothing his waistcoat, “you get to recuperate while lying low.”
Sherlock takes an unconscious step forward and John talks on, almost as if to himself. “And then I think, it's crazy. My responsibilities, your work, the risks… God, the press…”
Sherlock smiles, not denying it. Maybe someday he’ll have the chance to tell John the story, to show him the diary and photographs. But for now he drinks in every detail of John’s face, watching him fade into sleep, his lashes dark against his cheek, listening to his breath even out to a slow and steady cadence.
The thought of Sherlock watching him spurred yet another emotion. Self- consciousness? Vanity? “I watched you box for a few minutes, too.” He glanced at Sherlock's mouth. “How's the lip?”
The next day drags on mercilessly. Sherlock paces restlessly or slumps on the sofa watching television, arguing with quiz shows or picking apart crime dramas. Hannah finally finds an excuse to go chat with Dimmock to get away from him for awhile.
John held Sherlock’s gaze. “So what is this?” he asked in a low voice, nodding at the bottle of wine, the dessert plates, the warm glow of the fire.
“Me too.” Sherlock sat up, smoothing back his unruly hair. “C’mon. I’m going to take you to the best Chinese restaurant in the city.”
Always though, their conversations revolved around work. They talked about motives and opportunity, suspects and theories, but not about the past. The most personal exchanges centered on whose turn it was to do the shopping or polite inquiries about how John’s leg was feeling or if Sherlock had slept well.
John settled into the back seat, adrenaline pumping, completely unaware that his cane remained leaning against the kitchen table upstairs.
John tastes of spices and wine, his body is compact, shoulders firm, hands strong. Sherlock wants to be pinned under his weight, caged between his arms, and then, maybe then he'll truly accept that he and John are in this bedroom, free to kiss and tangle, lick and gasp, rut and moan.
“There’s something strange,” Molly continued. “Oh, I'm dying to tell you about it. But not over the telephone. Can you meet me here tonight?”
John closed the door softly and Sherlock slid under the covers, confused and relieved and conflicted, wishing John was next to him, smoothing his forehead gently until he fell asleep.
The sun climbs higher and the town slows with the increasing heat. Sherlock folds the paper closed. “Siesta,” he announces.
John smiled to himself, his good mood influencing the generous tip he gave to the driver. He stepped out into the snow, letting a few flakes fall onto his face. He was looking forward to the evening, and the next day, and the weeks ahead. What happened when they returned to England… it was too soon to tell, but he had a feeling that things would work out. Call it a sprinkle of intuition.
The army had given him what he wanted -- discipline and training, travel and adventure -- and left him with a respectable rank and a small pension, along with a ravaged shoulder and occasional nightmares. Not what his 23-year-old self had dreamed of, he thought wryly.
He wanted to do this for Sherlock, wanted to return an intimate gesture as gratitude for Sherlock's understanding. When Sherlock drew him into that hug, the world was crushing him, breaking him into pieces, and Sherlock held him together. John doesn't know how to repay that kind of debt. He can offer his time, small favors, his friendship, his loyalty. He will be here for Sherlock through thick and thin.
He was spared further criticism when Elizabeth entered the breakfast room. “Pardon me, ma’am, but Mrs. Turner would like to consult with you about this evening’s dinner.”
He grabbed the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, pushing him up against the wall, capturing his mouth. Sugar, mint, sweet lips, cool breath, warm skin, tingly tongues.
Something shifted in John's perspective; a new admiration took root, a tenderness blooming, a feeling of wanting to protect Sherlock from the slings and arrows of the outside world. But something hot unfurled as well -- a desire to be pinned under that intense blue gaze, for those long fingers and shapely mouth to burn across his skin, an urge to mold Sherlock's lithe body against his own and witness the ecstasy of release shimmering across his face.
Sherlock turned his head, lowering his mouth to John's for a slow kiss, lingering over his bottom lip. He drew back, his eyes dropping to John's chin, trying to find the words for what he was feeling. He fingered one of the buttons on John's shirt. “I'm glad we met,” he murmured, knowing it wasn't quite adequate but unsure of what else to say.
“Yeah.” John forced a grin. He didn’t enjoy talking about that part of his life. “Better than Afghanistan.” He changed the subject. “I was wondering if I could have the other desk removed to make some more space.”
“You're right,” Sherlock said stiffly. “You're the expert when it comes to these things. I was foolish to think we might spend our last few days together. Complete waste of time.”
He groaned inwardly. A little voice in his head suggested that a roommate could be pressed into sharing housework and the shopping. Maybe it would be worth exploring the idea…
John gazes down, mesmerized by straining fabric and dark curls and gorgeous hands and soft nape. He often steals moments like these, attracted, conflicted, unsure about what he should do or about what Sherlock feels or doesn’t feel.
He liked books, but he loved music and science more. He had gravitated toward chemistry during the last few years of his schooling, an interest that baffled his parents, though they supported his choice.
His gaze traveled up the black lapels of the driver’s suit to an angular face hidden beneath a chauffeur’s cap and reflective aviator sunglasses. John squinted as he drew closer, sure his sleep-deprived brain was playing tricks on him. But that mouth, that lanky frame, those big hands…
Sherlock had moved into the rented flat several days ago. With Victor’s help, they had carried the heaviest items up a flight of stairs into the partially furnished rooms. Victor had insisted that he set up the bedroom first, which, in hindsight, had been an excellent idea. They had made good use of the large bed despite their aching backs and tired legs, their lean bodies slowly entwining in the shadowy room.
“All of which are useless And did you know this house is supposedly haunted? My nurse is starting to think we have a resident ghost.”
Stamford was now curled at my feet and I rubbed his belly with my foot. “So I have a favor to ask,” I said. “It’s sort of an emergency.”
Sherlock stared at John with a dumbfounded look, then burst out laughing. “Oh, God, you have it all wrong.”
They were a handsome family, based on the few pictures on display. A black and white wedding photo of a beaming Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, a picture of the young Holmes boys playing on a beach somewhere, a few cute baby pictures, a stiff family portrait when Sherlock was maybe 18 and obviously not wanting to be there.
